<HEAD>TO THE KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE History of India is laid, with great humility, at the foot
of the throne. As no inconsiderable part of Hindostan, is now in a manner
comprehended within the circle of the British empire, there is a propriety in
addressing the history of that country to the Sovereign.</P>
<P>The success of your Majesty's arms has laid open the East
to the researches of the curious; and your gracious accept∣ance of this
first, though small specimen of the literature of Asia, will excite men
of greater abilities than the present translator possesses, to
study the annals of a people, remark∣able for their antiquity, civilization,
and the singular cha∣racter of their religion and manners.</P>
<P> <PB REF="5"/> In the history of Hindostan, now offered to your
Majesty, the people of Great-Britain may see a striking contrast of
their own condition; and, whilst they feel for human na∣ture suffering
under despotism, exult at the same time, in that happy liberty, which
they enjoy under the government of a Prince who delights in augmenting the
security and felicity of his subjects.</P>
<P>That your Majesty may long remain a public blessing, and
reign for a series of many years over this happy nation, is the sincere
prayer of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Majesty's most dutiful, most humble, and
most devoted subject and servant, ALEXANDER DOW.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE translator of the following history of the Mahom∣medan
empire in Hindostan, having in a military capacity resided for some time
in the kingdom of Bengal, dedicated the most of his leisure hours to the
study of the oriental languages. The Persian tongue being the most
po∣lite and learned, as well as the most universally understood in
Asia, engaged his principal attention.</P>
<P>The intimate connection which the British nation now have, with
a part of Hindostan, renders the knowledge of the country languages of great
importance to the servants of the public in that part of the world. The
translator, who had extended his views in the way of his profession,
thought it so capital a point for him, that he persevered for some years,
in that dry and difficult study, and incurred a very considerable expence,
in retaining masters, and in procuring manuscripts.</P>
<P>Though to qualify himself for action, and negotiation in India,
was the primary object of the translator, yet in pro∣portion as he advanced
in his studies, other motives for his continuing them arose. He found, that
however different the manner of the eastern writers may be from the correct 
<PB N="ii" REF="11"/> taste of Europe, there are many things in their works
worthy of the attention of literary men. Their poetry it is true is too turgid
and florid, and the diction of their historians too diffuse and verbose.
Yet in the first we meet with some passages truly elegant and
sublime; and amidst the redun∣dancy of the latter, there appears
sometimes a nervousness of expression, and a manliness of
sentiment, which might do honour to any historical genius in the
west.</P>
<P>Locked up in the difficulties of the Persian tongue, the
literature of Asia has been hitherto little known in Europe. From an
ignorance so unpardonable in this investigating age, a very unfavourable
idea has prevailed concerning the learn∣ing, as well as history, of the
eastern nations. Full of pre∣judices so natural to an European, the
translator entered upon the study of the oriental languages. Whatever aid a
knowledge of them might give to his private views, he little hoped to be able
to convert his studies to the amusement or instruction of the public. To
translate some piece of history, was, by his teachers, recommended to him
as a proper exercise in the Persian. The works of Mahummud Casim
Ferishta of Delhi, who flourished in the reign of Jehangire, about the
beginning of the seventeenth century, was put into his hands for that
purpose. As he advanced, a greater field gradually opened before him. He
found, with some degree of astonishment, the minute and authentic
history of a great empire, the name of which had scarcely ever travelled to
Europe.</P>
<P>To open a door to the literary treasures, which lay con∣cealed
in the obscurity of the Persian, the translator resolved to proceed in
his version of Ferishta's history, and to give it <PB N="iii" REF="12"/>
to the public as a small specimen of what men of greater abilities may
hereafter meet with in that language. But before he had fully accomplished
this design, injuries in rank, and other motives, forced him to quit the
company's service, and to return to England. Being, at his departure from
India, possessed only of one volume of the original, he has been
obliged to confine himself to it; and to leave the second volume, which
contains the particular histories of the Decan, Bengal, Guzerat, and
Cashmire, to a more favoura∣ble opportunity, or to the employment of some
other hand. This circumstance has occasioned some chasms in that part
of the history which is now given to the public; and many material
transactions of those nations, of whom Ferishta in his second volume
treats, are only slightly mentioned.</P>
<P>The reigns of the Mogul Emperors, from Akbar, with whom our author
concludes his general history, have been written by different historians.
But so voluminous are those works, that to attempt a translation, would
be a laborious and very tedious task. Since the days of Ferishta, no writer
that has come to our knowledge, has abridged the history of India, and
therefore the translator had formed a design to compile from various
authors that very essential part of the history of the Mogul empire,
which is not comprehended in the following translation.</P>
<P>With a view to accomplish this undertaking, the transla∣tor,
who had been honoured with the particular friendship of the present Mogul,
applied in person to that Prince, for such books, and authentic records, as
were necessary to com∣pleat the History of Hindostan. The King approved
very <PB N="iv" REF="13"/> much of his design, and gave orders to his
secretary to grant his request. But in the mean time the translator
quitted the service, and retired to Calcutta. To revive however his
Majesty's memory upon that subject, he wrote to him; and as the manner of
writing to eastern Princes may afford mat∣ter of some curiosity to the
public, we shall here give a lite∣ral translation of the letter.</P>
<Q> 
<P>To the audience of the admitted into the presence of the
treasury of liberality, and beneficence: To the sage director of the ways
of truth, the Kibla<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The point to which the Mahommedans
turn their faces when they pray.</NOTE> of the world, and the asylum of the
inhabitants of the universe, whose kingdom and re∣nown last for ever, it
is most humbly presented;</P> 
<P>That a servant, nourished by their<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is an invariable custom among the Eastern nations, to
address crowned heads in the third person plural, while the writer
himself always uses the third person in the singular number.</NOTE>
bounty, having, from their splendid presence, obtained leave of departure,
hath now reached the city of Calcutta, where, retired from the noise of
public affairs, he prays for their Majesty's wel∣fare.</P> 
<P>Moved by a grateful remembrance of their royal favour, warmed by
the fame, justice, and glorious exploits and con∣quests of the emperors of
the paradisiacal regions of Hindostan; but more particularly excited by the
renown of the imperial house of Timur<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Timur,
who in Europe is, by corruption, called Tamerlane, has always conferred upon
him the title of Saib Kirren, or lord of the periods. Kirren, of which Kiran is
the plural, signifies a period of thirty years. The long reign of Timur gave
rise to his title.</NOTE>, lord of ages! And also by a desire to gratify 
<PB N="v" REF="14"/> the curiosity of distant nations, with the great
actions of a splen∣did dynasty of Kings, he has dared to aspire to
translate the history of Hindostan, from the best and most authentic
Persian authors, into the English language, now strong, learned and
universal.</P> 
<P>From the first rising of the star of the faith, upon these
paradisiacal plains, unto the end of the glorious reign of ARSH ASTANI
MAHUMMUD AKBAR, King, the history of Empire has been already penned: but,
from that period to the pre∣sent time, materials have been wanting to their
Majesty's servant: he therefore breathes in hope, that their sublime
Majesty will signify their royal pleasure to the RAI RAIAN, chief
secretary of the illustrious presence, to supply their servant with
such books and authentic records, as are neces∣sary to accomplish his
great design. Thus shall the glory of their renown shine forth to
European eyes, with that splendor, which, from the firmament of empire, hath
hi∣therto enlightened the East.</P> </Q>
<P>The government of the presidency of Bengal, have of late, in
some particulars, imbibed the political principles of the East; for all
private correspondence with any of the country powers is strictly
prohibited. The above letter was dispatched by the translator to a friend
at Allahabad, the present residence of the Emperor, with a request to
deliver it in person to that prince. But whether afraid of his su∣periors,
or guilty of an unaccountable neglect, that gen∣tleman returned to Calcutta
without presenting the letter to the Mogul. The translator forwarded it a
second time to Allahabad, but before an answer could be received from so 
<PB N="vi" REF="15"/> great a distance, he was obliged, after having waited
for the last ship in the season, to embark for Europe.</P>
<P>Though our author Mahummud Casim Ferishta has given the title
of the History of Hindostan to his work, yet it is ra∣ther that of the
Mahommedan empire in India, than a gene∣ral account of the affairs of the
Hindoos. What he says concerning India, prior to the first invasion of
the Afgan Mussulmen, is very far from being satisfactory. He collected
his accounts from Persian authors, being altogether unac∣quainted with the
Shanscrita or learned language of the Brahmins, in which the internal
history of India is compre∣hended. We must not therefore, with Ferishta,
consider the Hindoos as destitute of genuine domestic annals, or that
those voluminous records they possess are mere legends framed by the
Brahmins.</P>
<P>The prejudices of the Mahommedans against the follow∣ers of the
Brahmin religion, seldom permits them to speak with common candour of the
Hindoos. It swayed very much with Ferishta when he affirmed, that there is
no his∣tory among the Hindoos of better authority than the Maha∣barit. That
work is a poem and not a history: It was trans∣lated into Persian by the
brother of the great Abul Fazil, rather as a performance of fancy, than as an
authentic account of the ancient dynasties of the Kings of India. But that
there are many hundred volumes in prose in the Shan∣scrita language, which
treat of the ancient Indians, the translator can, from his own knowledge,
aver, and he has great reason to believe, that the Hindoos carry their
authen∣tic history farther back into antiquity, than any other nation now
existing.</P>
<P> <PB N="vii" REF="16"/> The Mahommedans know nothing of the Hindoo
learn∣ing: and had they even any knowledge of the history of the followers of
Brimha, their prejudices in favour of the jewish fictions contained in the
Koran, would make them reject accounts, which tend to subvert the system
of their own faith. The Shanscrita records contain accounts of the affairs of
the western Asia, very different from what any tribe of the Arabians have
transmitted to posterity: and it is more than probable, that upon
examination, the former will appear to bear the marks of more authenticity, and
of greater antiquity than the latter.</P>
<P>But whether the Hindoos possess any true history of
greater antiquity than other nations, must altogether rest upon the
authority of the Brahmins, till we shall become better ac∣quainted with their
records. Their pretensions however are very high, and they confidently
affirm, that the Jewish and Mahommedan religions are heresies, from what is
contained in the Bedas. They give a very particular account of the origin of
the Jewish religion in records of undoubted anti∣quity. Raja Tura, say
they, who is placed in the first ages of the Cal Jug, had a son who
apostatized from the Hindoo faith, for which he was banished by his father
to the West. The apostate fixed his residence in a country called Mohgod,
and propagated the Jewish religion, which the impostor Mahommed further
corrupted. The Cal Jug commenced about 4885 years ago, and whether the whole
story may not relate to Terah and his son Abraham, is a point which we will
leave to others to determine.</P>
<P>There is one circumstance which goes far to prove that there is
some connection between the Brahmin Bedas and the <PB N="viii" REF="17"/>
doctrines contained in the Old Testament. Ever since the promulgation of
the religion of Mahommed, which is founded upon Moses and the Prophets, the
Brahmins have totally rejected their fourth Beda called the Obatar Bah, as the
schism of Mahommed, according to them, has been founded upon that book.
However extraordinary this rea∣son is for rejecting the fourth part of their
religious records, it can scarcely be doubted, as it is in the mouth of every
Brahmin.</P>
<P>Feizi, the brother of Abul Fazil the historian, was the only
Mussulman we ever heard of, who understood the Shanscrita. The
fraudulent means by which he acquired it, will be shewn in another place. He
never translated any of the Indian histories, excepting the Mahabarit,
which, at best, is but an historical poem, in which a great deal of fable
is blended with a little truth. We, upon the whole, cannot much depend upon the
accounts which the followers of Mahommed give of the religion and ancient
history of the Hindoos: Their prejudice makes them misrepresent the
former, and their ignorance in the Shanscrita language, has totally excluded
them from any knowledge of the latter.</P>
<P>The history of Casim Ferishta being an abridgment of a
variety of authors, who wrote distinct accounts of the diffe∣rent reigns of
the Mahommedan Emperors of Hindostan, he, with a view to comprehend in a
small compass, every mate∣rial transaction, has crowded the events too
much together, without interspersing them with those reflections which
give spirit and elegance to works of this kind: This defect seems however
to have proceeded more from a studied brevity, than <PB N="ix" REF="18"/> from
a narrowness of genius in Ferishta. Upon some oc∣casions, especially
in the characters of the princes, he shews a strength of judgment, and a
nervousness and conciseness of expression which would do no
dishonour to the best wri∣ters in the west. What is really remarkable in
this writer is, that he seems as much divested of religious prejudices, as
he is of political flattery or fear. He never passes a good action without
conferring upon it its due reward of praise, nor a bad one, let the
villainous actor be never so high, without stigmatizing it with infamy. In
short, if he does not arrive at the character of a good writer, he certainly
deserves that of a good man.</P>
<P>The brevity which we censure in Ferishta, is by no means a
common fault in the writers of Asia. Redundant and ver∣bose in their
diction, they often regard more the cadence and turn of their sentences, than
the propriety and ele∣gance of their thoughts; leading frequently the reader
into a labyrinth to which he can find no end. This is too much the manner of
the learned Abul Fazil himself. He wrote the history of the reign of Akbar
in two large volumes in folio. The intrigues of the court, and all the secret
motives to action are investigated with the utmost exactness; but the
diction is too diffuse, and the language too florid for the correct taste
of Europe.</P>
<P>It ought here to be remarked, that all the oriental histo∣rians
write, in what they call in Europe, poetical prose. This false taste only
commenced about five centuries ago, when literature declined in Asia, with
the power of the Caliphs. The translator has now in his possession,
books written in the Persian before that period, the diction of 
<PB N="x" REF="19"/> which, is as concise and manly, as that which descended
from Greece and Rome, to the writers of modern Europe. The learned and
celebrated Abul Fazil, instead of correcting this vicious taste, encouraged
it greatly by his florid man∣ner, in his history of the reign of Akbar. But
this great writer has, notwithstanding his circumlocutions, cloathed his
expressions with such beauty and pomp of eloquence, that he seems to
come down upon the astonished reader, like the Ganges in the rainy
season.</P>
<P>The small progress which correctness and elegance of
sen∣timent and diction has made in the East, did not proceed from a want of
encouragement to literature. We shall find in the course of this history,
that no princes in the world patronised men of letters with more generosity
and respect, than the Mahommedan Emperors of Hindostan. A literary genius
was not only the certain means to acquire a degree of wealth which must
astonish Europeans, but an infallible road for rising to the first
offices of the state. The character of the learned, was at the same time
so sacred, that tyrants, who made a pastime of embruing their hands in
the blood of their other subjects, not only abstained from offering
violence to men of genius, but stood in fear of their pens. It is a proverb
in the East, that the Monarchs of Asia were more afraid of the pen of Abul
Fazil, than they were of the sword of Akbar; and, however amazing it may
seem in ab∣solute governments, it is certain that the historians of that
division of the world, have wrote with more freedom con∣cerning persons and
things, than writers have ever dared to do in the West.</P>
<P> <PB N="xi" REF="20"/> The translator, however, being
sensible of the impropriety of poetical diction, in the grave narration of
historical facts, has, in many places, clipped the wings of Ferishta's
turgid expressions, and reduced his metaphors into common language, without
however swerving in the least from the original meaning of the author.</P>
<P>A frequent repetition of proper names is unavoidable in a work of
such brevity, and so much crouded with action. This will perhaps appear the
most glaring defect in the work: but to use the pronouns too often, would
have rendered the sense more perplexed, and the narration less elegant
and distinct. The translator, in short, chose to give the faults of his
author to the public as they stood, rather than by an attempt to a∣mend them,
to substitute perhaps some of his own in their place.</P>
<P>Our author with great propriety begins the history of the Patan
empire in Hindostan, from the commencement of the kingdom of Ghizni. The
Mahommedan govern∣ment, which afterwards extended itself to Hindostan,
rose originally from very small beginnings among the mountains which divide
Persia from India. The Afgans or Patans, a warlike race of men, who had been
subjects of the vast empire of Bochara, revolted under their governor
Abistagi, in the fourth century of the Higera, and laid the foundation of the
empire of Ghizni, known commonly in Europe, by the name of Gazna. Under a
succession of war∣like princes, this empire rose to a surprising
magnitude. We find that in the reign of Musaood, in the beginning of the
fifth century of the Higera, it extended from Ispahan to Bengal, and from the
mouths of the Indus to the banks <PB N="xii" REF="21"/> of the Jaxartes, which
comprehends near half of the great continent of Asia.</P>
<P>Soon after the death of Musaood, the Charizmian empire arose
on the confines of Persia and great Tartary. It ex∣tended itself over
Tartary and the greatest part of the Persian provinces; the Kings of the
Ghiznian Patans were obliged to relinquish their dominions in the north, and
to transfer the seat of their empire to Lahore, and afterwards to Delhi.</P>
<P>When the great conqueror of Asia Zingis Chan, invaded and
subverted the Charizmian empire under Mahummud Shaw, the Patan dominions were
entirely confined within the limits of Hindostan. They possessed
however power suf∣ficient to repel the generals of that great man, though
flushed with victory and the spoils of the East. The whole force of
Zingis, it is true, was never bent against Hindostan, otherwise it is
probable it would have shared the fate of the western Asia, which was
almost depopulated by his sword.</P>
<P>The uncommon strength of the Patan empire in Hindos∣tan at
this period, may be easily accounted for: It was the policy of the adopted
Turkish slaves of the family of Ghor, who then held the kingdom of Delhi,
to keep standing armies of the mountain Afgans, under their respective
chiefs, who were invariably created Omrahs of the empire. This hardy race,
whatever domestic confusions and revo∣lutions they might occasion in
India, were, to use Ferishta's words, a wall of iron against foreign
enemies.</P>
<P> <PB N="xiii" REF="22"/> Our author has not been careful to mark
the extent of the Empire in every reign. We can only form a general idea of it,
from the transactions which he records. The Empire we find sometimes
reduced to a few districts round the capital, and at other times, extending
itself from the bay of Bengal to Persia, and from the Carnatic to the great
mountains of Sewalic. In short, the boundaries of the Pa∣tan imperial
dominions, varied in proportion to the abilities of those princes who
possessed the throne. When the mo∣narchs discovered great parts, the
governors of provinces shrunk back from their independance into their former
sub∣mission; but when a weak Prince sat on the Musnud, his
lieutenants started up into Kings around him.</P>
<P>The history now given to the public, presents us with a
striking picture of the deplorable condition of a people subjected to
arbitrary sway; and of the instability of empire itself, when it is
founded neither upon laws, nor upon the opinions and attachments of mankind.
Hindostan, in every age, was an ample field for private ambition, and for
public tyranny. At one time we see a petty Omrah starting forth, and wading
through an ocean of blood to the crown, or involving many thousands of
indigent adventurers in the ruin which he draws upon his own head. At another
time we meet with Kings, from a lust of power which de∣feats itself,
destroying those subjects over whom they only wished to tyrannize.</P>
<P>In a government like that of India, public spirit is never
seen, and loyalty is a thing unknown. The people permit themselves to be
transferred from one tyrant to another, without murmuring; and individuals look
with unconcern <PB N="xiv" REF="23"/> upon the miseries of others, if they are
capable to screen themselves from the general misfortune. This, however, is
a picture of Hindostan in bad times, and under the worst Kings. As
arbitrary government can inflict the most sudden miseries, so, when in
the hands of good men, it can admi∣nister the most expeditious relief to
the subject. We accord∣ingly find in this history, that the misfortunes of
half an age of tyranny, are removed in a few years, under the mild
administration of a virtuous prince.</P>
<P>It may not be improper in this place, to lay before the public, a
short sketch of the constitution of Hindostan. The Emperor is
absolute and sole arbiter in every thing, and is controlled by no law. The
lives and properties of the great∣est Omrahs are as much at his disposal,
as those of the mean∣est subjects. The former however are often too
powerful to be punished, while the latter are not only slaves to the King,
but to the provincial governors. These governors, distinguished by the
name of Nabobs, have in their respective jurisdictions, the power of life
and death, and are, in every particular, invested with regal authority.</P>
<P>All the lands in India are considered as the property of the
King, except some hereditary districts possessed by Hin∣doo
Princes, for which, when the Empire was in its vigour, they paid annual
tributes, but retained an absolute jurisdiction in their own hands. The
King is the general heir of all his subjects; but when there are children to
inherit, they are seldom deprived of their father's estate, without the
fortune is enormous, and has been amassed in the oppressive govern∣ment
of a province. In a case of this kind, the children, or nearest relations,
are allowed a certain proportion for their <PB N="xv" REF="24"/>
subsistance, at the discretion of the Casy or judge. The for∣tunes of
merchants, tradesmen, and mechanics, are never confiscated by the crown, if
any children or relations remain.</P>
<P>The King has the extraordinary power of nominating his
successor by will. This part of royal prerogative is not pe∣culiar to the
monarchs of Hindostan. We find that our own nation, so remarkable for their
political freedom, were, not above two centuries ago, made over like a private
estate, and that with their own consent, by the will of a Prince, who
neither deserved to be beloved nor admired. Accord∣ing to the opinion of the
Indians, the right of succession is vested in the male heir, but the
last will of the King very often supersedes this idea of justice.
Notwithstanding this prejudice in favour of the first born, there is no
dis∣tinction made between natural children and those born in lawful
wedlock; for every child brought forth in the Ha∣ram, whether by wives or
concubines, are equally legiti∣mate.</P>
<P>The vizier is generally first minister of state. All edicts
and public deeds must pass under his seal, after the royal signet is
affixed to them. The Vizier's office consists of va∣rious departments, in
every one of which all commissions, patents for honorary titles, and grants
for Jagiers, are care∣fully registered. He superintends the royal
exchequer, and, in that capacity, keeps accounts with the Dewans of the
seve∣ral provinces, in every thing which regards the finances.</P>
<P>A Vakiel Mutuluck is sometimes appointed by the King. The power
of this officer is superior to that of the Vizier, for he not only has the
superintendency of civil, but also of <PB N="xvi" REF="25"/> all military
affairs. This last is never any part of the Vizier's office; the Amir ul
Omrah, or Buxshi, being independent captain-general, and paymaster of the
forces. It is not easy to explain to Europeans the full extent of authority
conferred upon the Vakiel Mutuluck; he seems to be an officer to whom the
King for a time delegates his whole power, re∣serving only for himself the
imperial title, and ensigns of royalty.</P>
<P>The Emperor of Hindostan gives public audience twice a day from
the throne. All petitioners, without distinction, are, after having gone
through the usual ceremonies, admitted. They are permitted to present their
written complaints to the Ariz Beg, or lord of the requests, who attends, in
order to present them to the King. The King reads them all him∣self, and
superscribes his pleasure in a few words, with his own hand. Should any
thing in the petition appear doubt∣ful, it is immediately referred to the
Sidder ul Suddur, whose office answers to that of our chief justice, to
be ex∣amined and determined according to law.</P>
<P>The Mahommedans of Hindostan have no written laws, but those
contained in the Koran. There are certain usages founded upon reason, and
immemorial custom, which are also committed to writing. By the latter
some causes are determined, and there are officers appointed by the crown,
under the name of Canongoes, who, for a certain fee, ex∣plain the written
usages to the people. In every district or pergunnah, there is a cutchery,
or court of justice established. These courts are extremely venal, and
even the legal fees for determining a cause concerning property, is one
fourth of <PB N="xvii" REF="26"/> the value of the matter in dispute. Their
decisions were, how∣ever, very expeditious; and through fear of the
displeasure of the King, who invariably punished with the utmost
severity corrupt judges, the Casys were pretty equitable in their
deter∣minations.</P>
<P>In the declining state of the Empire, the provinces were
submitted to the management of Nabobs, or military gover∣nors, who farmed the
revenues at a certain sum, and reser∣ved the overplus for their own use.
Originally the Nabobs were only commanders of the forces, who receiving their
orders from court, through the medium of the Dewan, a civil officer who
collected all the revenues for the King, paid the just expences of the
government of the province, and remitted the surplus to the exchequer. But
the Nabobs having the military power in their hands, despised the
autho∣rity of the Dewans, and purposely fomented divisions, factions, and
insurrections, that they might be indulged with great standing armies, to
make more money pass through their own hands, and to favour their schemes
of independence.</P>
<P>The imbecility of the Empire daily increasing, the nomi∣nal
authority vested in the Dewan, was not sufficient to con∣tend with the real
force in the hands of the Nabob. Conti∣nual altercations subsisted
between these officers in the pro∣vince, and frequent complaints were
transmitted to court. Ministers who preferred present ease to the
future interest of the empire, curtailed the power of the Dewan, and, from
being in a manner the commander in chief of the province, he fell into the
simple superintendency of the collections. <PB N="xviii" REF="27"/> He had,
it is true, the power to prevent new imposts, and innovations in the law.</P>
<P>When the King took the field, the provincial Nabobs, with their
troops, were obliged to repair to the imperial standard. Each Nabob erected
his own standard, and formed a separate camp, subject only to his own
orders. The Na∣bobs every morning attended at the royal pavilion, and re∣ceived
their orders from the Amir ul Omrah<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The
captain-general.</NOTE>, who received his immediately from the King himself.
If we except the army of the great Sultan Baber, there are few traces of real
discipline to be met with among those myriads, with whom the Emperors of
Hindostan often took the field. The forces of Baber were formed on a very
regular and masterly plan. The dispositions of his battles were
excellent; and the sur∣prizing victories he obtained with a handful of men,
over immense armies, are sufficient to convince us, that military
discipline has not always been unknown in Asia.</P>
<P>It may to an European, furnish matter of some surprize, how
Eastern armies of two or three hundred thousand horse, and triple that
number of soldiers and followers, could be supplied with provisions and
forage upon their march, and in their standing camps. To account for this it
is to be ob∣served, that every provincial Nabob, upon his taking the field,
appoints an officer called the Cutwal, whose business it is to
superintend the Bazars or markets, which may belong to his camp. Every
commander of a body of troops obtains at the same time, permission to
hoist a slag for a Bazar, and to appoint a Cutwal of his own, under the
direction of the <PB N="xix" REF="28"/> Cutwal-general. These Cutwals grant
licences to chapmen, sutlers, and corn dealers, who gladly pay a certain tax
for permission to dispose of their various commodities, under the
protection of the different flags.</P>
<P>The sutlers and dealers in corn, being provided with a
sufficient number of camels and oxen, collect provisions from all the
countries in their rear, and supply the wants of the camp. The pay of
soldiers in Hindostan is very great, being from 60 to 200 rupees per month,
to every single trooper. This enables them to give such high prices for
provisions, that the countries round run all hazards for such a great
prospect of gain. The fertility of Hindostan itself, is the great
source of this ready and plentiful supply to the armies; for that country
produces, in most parts two, and sometimes three crops of corn every
year<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Indians sometimes feed their horses
with a kind of vetch called Gram, which they boil. In want of that, they make a
shift with the roots of grass, which they dig up and wash in water. This
they reckon better than hay. They are by this means never in want for forage,
in a country so remarkable for vegetation. The horses al∣ways belong to the
riders, which renders them more assiduous to keep them in proper order, as
their pay depends entirely on the goodness of their horses. But this is
attend∣ed with a bad consequence. A soldier of fortune, who has nothing but
his horse to depend upon, is often afraid to expose him, where he would
perhaps risque his own life.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be expected, that something concerning the
language of the translation, should be said in this place. Employed from
his youth in a profession very different from that of letters, the
translator aspires not to the character of a fine writer. To express his
author's meaning in a plain and unaffected diction, was all his design; and
he expects the public will the more readily overlook any errors he may have
committed, that he neither hopes for much literary reputation, nor wishes for
any advantage from his work.</P>

<PB REF="29"/>
<HEAD>A DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE Customs, Manners, Language,
Religion and Philosophy of the HINDOOS.</HEAD>
<P>THE learned of modern Europe have, with reason, complained that
the writers of Greece and Rome did not extend their enquiries to the religion
and philosophy of the Druids. Posterity will perhaps, in the same manner,
find fault with the British for not investigating the learning and
religious opinions, which prevail in those countries in Asia, into which
either their commerce or their arms have penetrated. The Brahmins of the East
possessed in antient times, some reputation for knowledge, but we
have never had the curiosity to examine whether there was any truth in the
reports of antiquity upon that head.</P>
<P>Excuses, however, may be formed for our ignorance con∣cerning
the learning, religion and philosophy of the Brahmins. Literary inquiries are
by no means a capital <PB N="xxii" REF="30"/> object to many of our adventurers
in Asia. The few who have a turn for researches of that kind, are
discouraged by the very great difficulty in acquiring that language, in which
the learning of the Hindoos is contained; or by that impenetrable veil of
mystery with which the Brahmins in∣dustriously cover their religious
tenets and philosophy.</P>
<P>These circumstances combining together, have opened an ample
field for fiction. Modern travellers have accordingly indulged their talent for
fable, upon the mysterious re∣ligion of Hindostan. Whether the ridiculous
tales they relate, proceed from that common partiality which Euro∣peans, as
well as less enlightened nations, entertain for the religion and philosophy
of their own country, or from a judgment formed upon some external ceremonies
of the Hindoos, is very difficult to determine; but they have prejudiced Europe
against the Brahmins, and by a very un∣fair account, have thrown disgrace
upon a system of re∣ligion and philosophy, which they did by no means
investigate.</P>
<P>The author of this dissertation must own, that he for a long
time, suffered himself to be carried down in this stream of popular
prejudice. The present decline of literature in Hindostan, served to
confirm him in his belief of those legends which he read in Europe,
concerning the Brah∣mins. But conversing by accident, one day, with a noble
and learned Brahmin, he was not a little surprized to find him perfectly
acquainted with those opinions, which, both in ancient and modern Europe,
have employed the pens of the most celebrated moralists. This
circumstance did not fail to excite his curiosity, and in the course of
many sub∣sequent <PB N="xxiii" REF="31"/> conversations, he found that
philosophy and the sciences had, in former ages, made a very considerable
pro∣gress in the East.</P>
<P>Having then no intention to quit India for some time, he
resolved to acquire some knowledge in the Shanscrita lan∣guage; the grand
repository of the religion, philosophy and history of the Hindoos. With
this view, he prevailed upon his noble friend the Brahmin, to procure for him a
Pundit, from the university of Benaris, well versed in the Shanscrita,
and master of all the knowledge of that learned body. But before he had made
any considerable progress in his studies, an unexpected change of affairs
in Bengal, broke off all his literary schemes. He found that the time he had
to remain in India would be too short to acquire the Shanscrita. He
determined therefore, through the medium of the Persian language, and through
the vulgar tongue of the Hindoos, to inform himself as much as possible,
concerning the my∣thology and philosophy of the Brahmins. He, for this
pur∣pose, procured some of the principal SHASTERS, and his Pundit explained
to him, as many passages of those curious books, as served to give him
a general idea of the doctrine which they contain.</P>
<P>It is but justice to the Brahmins to confess that the author
of this dissertation is very sensible of his own inability to
illustrate, with that fullness and perspicuity which it de∣serves, that
symbolical religion, which they are at so much pains to conceal from
foreigners. He however can aver, that he has not misrepresented one
single circumstance or tenet, though many may have escaped his
observation.</P>
<P> <PB N="xxiv" REF="32"/> The books which contain the religion and
philosophy of the Hindoos, are distinguished by the name of Bedas. They
are four in number, and like the sacred writings of other nations, are said
to have been penned by the divinity. Beda in the Shanscrita, literally
signifies SCIENCE: for these books not only treat of religious and moral
duties, but of every branch of philosophical knowledge.</P>
<P>The Bedas are, by the Brahmins, held so sacred, that they
per∣mit no other sect to read them; and such is the influence of
superstition and priest-craft over the minds of the other CASTS in India,
that they would deem it an unpardonable sin to satisfy their curiosity in
that respect, were it even within the compass of their power. The Brahmins
them∣selves are bound by such strong ties of religion, to confine those
writings to their own tribe, that were any of them known to read them to
others, he would be immediately excom∣municated. This punishment is worse
than even death it∣self among the Hindoos. The offender is not only thrown
down from the noblest order to the most polluted CAST, but his posterity
are rendered for ever incapable of being re∣ceived into his former dignity.</P>
<P>All these things considered, we are not to wonder that the
doctrine of the Bedas is so little known in Europe. Even the literary part of
the Mahomedans of Asia, reckon it an abstruse and mysterious subject,
and candidly confess, that it is covered with a veil of darkness, which
they could never penetrate. Some have indeed supposed, that the learned
Feizi, brother to the celebrated Abul Fazil, chief secretary to the Emperor
Akbar, had read the Bedas, and discovered the religious tenets contained in
them to that renowned Prince. <PB N="xxv" REF="33"/> As the story of Feizi
made a good deal of noise in the east, it may not be improper to give the
particulars of it in this place.</P>
<P>Mahummud Akbar being a prince of elevated and exten∣sive ideas,
was totally divested of those prejudices for his own religion, which men of
inferior parts not only imbibe with their mother's milk, but retain throughout
their lives. Though bred in all the strictness of the Mahom∣medan faith,
his great soul in his riper years, broke those chains of superstition
and credulity, with which his tutors had, in his early youth, fettered his
mind. With a design to chuse his own religion, or rather from curiosity,
he made it his business to enquire minutely into all the sys∣tems of
divinity, which prevailed among mankind. The story of his being instructed
in the christian tenets, by a missionary from Portugal, is too well known
in Europe to require a place in this dissertation. As almost all
religions admit of proselytes, Akbar had good success in his enquiries,
till he came to his own subjects the Hindoos. Contrary to the practice of all
other religious sects, they admit of no converts; but they allow that every
one may go to heaven his own way, though they perhaps suppose, that theirs
is the most expeditious method to obtain that important end. They chuse
rather to make a mystery of their religion, than impose it upon the world,
like the Mahommedans, with the sword, or by means of the stake, after the
manner of some pious christians.</P>
<P>Not all the authority of Akbar could prevail with the Brahmins to
reveal the principles of their faith. He was therefore obliged to have
recourse to artifice to obtain the information which he so much desired.
The Emperor, for <PB N="xxvi" REF="34"/> this purpose, concerted a plan with
his chief secretary, Abul Fazil, to impose Feizi, then a boy, upon the
Brahmins, in the character of a poor orphan of their tribe. Feizi being
instructed in his part, was privately sent to Benaris, the prin∣cipal
seat of learning among the Hindoos. In that city the fraud was practised on
a learned Brahmin, who received the boy into his house, and educated him as
his own son.</P>
<P>When Feizi, after ten years study, had acquired the
Shan∣scrita language, and all the knowledge of which the learned of Benaris
were possessed, proper measures were taken by the Emperor to secure
his safe return. Feizi it seems, during his residence with his patron the
Brahmin, was smitten with the beauty of his only daughter; and indeed the
ladies of the Brahmin race are the handsomest in Hindostan. The old
Brahmin saw the mutual passion of the young pair with pleasure, and as
he loved Feizi for his uncommon abilities, he offered him his daughter in
marriage. Feizi, perplexed between love and gratitude, at length discovered
himself to the good old man, fell down at his feet, and grasping his knees,
solicited with tears for forgiveness, for the great crime he had committed
against his indulgent benefactor. The Brahmin, struck dumb with
astonishment, uttered not one word of reproach. He drew a dagger, which he
always carried on his girdle, and prepared to plunge it in his own breast.
Feizi seized his hand, and conjured him, that if yet any atonement could be
made for the injury he had done him, he himself would swear to deny him
nothing. The Brahmin, bursting into tears, told him, that if Feizi should
grant him two requests, he would forgive him, and consent to live. Feizi,
without any hesitation, consented, and the <PB N="xxvii" REF="35"/>
Brahmin's requests were, that he should never translate the Bedas, nor
repeat the creed of the Hindoos.</P>
<P>How far Feizi was bound by his oath not to reveal the doctrine of
the Bedas to Akbar is uncertain; but that neither he, nor any other person,
ever translated those books, is a truth beyond any dispute. It is however
well known, that the Emperor afterwards greatly favoured the Hindoo faith, and
gave much offence to zealous Mahommedans, by prac∣tising some Indian
customs which they thought savoured of idolatry. But the
dispassionate part of mankind have always allowed, that Akbar was equally
divested of all the follies of both the religious superstitions, which
prevailed among his subjects.</P>
<P>To return from this digression, the Brahmins maintain, that
the Bedas are the divine laws, which Brimha, at the creation of the world,
delivered for the instruction of man∣kind. But they affirm that their meaning
was perverted in the first age, by the ignorance and wickedness of some
princes, whom they represent as evil spirits who then haunted the earth.
They call those evil genii Dewtas, and tell many strange allegorical
legends concerning them; such as, that the Bedas being lost, were
afterwards recovered by Bishen, in the form of a fish, who brought them up
from the bottom of the ocean, into which they were thrown by a Deo, or
Demon.</P>
<P>The first credible account we have of the Bedas, is, that about
the commencement of the Cal Jug, of which aera the pre∣sent year 1768, is the
4886th year, they were written, or rather collected by a great philosopher,
and reputed prophet, called Beäss Muni, or Beäss the inspired.
This learned man is <PB N="xxviii" REF="36"/> otherwise called Krishen
Basdeo, and is said to have lived in the reign of Judishter, in the city of
Histanapore, upon the river Jumna, near the present city of Delhi.</P>
<P>The Brahmins do not give to Beäss Muni the merit of being
the author of the Bedas. They however acknowledge, that he reduced them into
the present form, dividing them into four distinct books, after having
collected the detached pieces of which they are composed, from every part of
India. It is, upon the whole, probable, that they are not the work of one man,
on account of their immense bulk.</P>
<P>The Mahomedans of Asia, as well as some of the learn∣ed of
Europe, have mistaken Brimha, an allegorical person, for some
philosopher of repute in India, whom they distin∣guish by the disfigured
names of Bruma, Burma, and Bramha, whom they suppose to have been the
writer of the religious books of the Hindoos. Ferishta, in the history now
given to the public, affirms, that Brimha was of the race of Bang, and
flourished in the reign of Krishen, first monarch of Hindostan. But the
Brahmins deny, that any such person ever existed, which we have reason
to believe is the truth; as Brimha in the Shanscrita language allegorically
signifies WISDOM, one of the principal attributes of the supreme
divinity.</P>
<P>The four Bedas contain 100,000 ashlogues or stanzas in
verse, each of which consists of four lines. The first Beda is called
RUG BEDA, which signifies the science of divination, concerning which it
principally treats. It also contains astrology, astronomy, natural
philosophy, and a very parti∣cular account of the creation of matter, and the
formation of the world.</P>
<P> <PB N="xxix" REF="37"/> The second Beda is distinguished by
the name of SHEHAM. That word signifies piety or devotion, and this book
accord∣ingly treats of all religious and moral duties. It also con∣tains many
hymns in praise of the supreme being, as well as verses in honour of
subaltern intelligences.</P>
<P>The third is the JUDGER BEDA, which, as the word implies,
comprehends the whole science of religious rites and cere∣monies; such as
fasts, festivals, purifications, penances, pilgrimages, sacrifices,
prayers, and offerings. They give the appellation of OBATAR BAH to the fourth
Beda. OBA∣TAR signifies in the Shanscrita, the being, or the essence,
and BAH good; so that the Obatar Bah is literally the know∣ledge of the good
being, and accordingly this book compre∣hends the whole science of theology
and metaphysical philo∣sophy.</P>
<P>The language of the Obatar Bah Beda is now become ob∣solete;
so that very few Brahmins pretend to read it with propriety. Whether this
proceeds from its great antiquity, or from its being wrote in an uncommon
dialect of the Shanscrita, is hard to determine. We are inclined to be∣lieve
that the first is the truth; for we can by no means agree with a late
ingenious writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Holwell: The author of the
dissertation finds himself obliged to differ almost in every particular
concerning the religion of the Hindoos, from that gentleman.</NOTE>, who
affirms, that the Obatar Bah was written in a period posterior to the rest
of the Bedas.</P>
<P>It has been already observed, that the Bedas are written in the
Shanscrita tongue. Whether the Shanscrita was, in any period of antiquity,
the vulgar language of Hindostan, <PB N="xxx" REF="38"/> or was invented by
the Brahmins, to be a mysterious repo∣sitory for their religion and
philosophy, is difficult to deter∣mine. All other languages, it is true, were
casually invent∣ed by mankind, to express their ideas and wants; but the
astonishing formation of the Shanscrita seems to be beyond the power of
chance. In regularity of etymology and gram∣matical order, it far exceeds the
Arabic. It, in short, bears evident marks, that it has been fixed upon
rational prin∣ciples, by a body of learned men, who studied regularity,
harmony, and a wonderful simplicity and energy of ex∣pression.</P>
<P>Though the Shanscrita is amazingly copious, a very small
grammar and vocabulary serve to illustrate the principles of the whole. In
a treatise of a few pages, the roots and pri∣mitives are all comprehended,
and so uniform is the rules for derivations and inflections, that the etymon
of every word is, with the greatest facility, at once investigated. The
pronunciation is the greatest difficulty which attends the acquirement of the
language to perfection. This is so quick and forcible, that a person, even
before the years of puber∣ty, must labour a long time before he can pronounce
it with propriety; but when once that is attained to perfection, it strikes
the ear with amazing boldness and harmony. The alphabet of the Shanscrita
consists of fifty letters, but one half of these carry combined sounds,
so that its characters in fact, do not exceed ours in number. Some small
idea of the Shanscrita may be conveyed by the annexed plate, which contains
the alphabet, and the measure of the four Bedas.</P>
<P>Before we shall proceed to the religion and philosophy of the
Brahmins, it may not be improper to premise something <PB REF="39"/>

</BODY>
</TEXT> <PB N="xxxi" REF="40"/> concerning the most characteristical
manners and customs of the Hindoos in general. The Hindoos are so called
from Indoo or Hindoo, which, in the Shanscrita language, signi∣fies the
Moon; for from that luminary, and the sun, they deduce their fabulous origin.
The author of the dissertation has in his possession, a long list
of a dynasty of Kings, call∣ed Hindoo-buns or Chunder-buns, both of which
words mean, the Children of the Moon. He also has a catalogue of the
Surage-buns, or the Children of the Sun, from whom many of the Rajas of
Hindostan pretend to derive their blood. Hindostan, the domestic
appellation of India, is a composition of Hindoo, and Stan, a region; and the
great river Indus takes its name from the people, and not the people from the
river, as has been erroneously supposed in Europe.</P>
<P>The Hindoos have, from all antiquity, been divided into four great
tribes, each of which comprehend a variety of inferior casts. These tribes
do not intermarry, eat, drink, or in any manner associate with one another,
except when they worship at the temple of Jagga-nat<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jagga nat signifies Lord of the creation. This is one of the
names of Bishen and the Obatar, or Being, who is said to preside over the
present period. He is represented under the figure of a fat man, sitting
cross-legged, with his arms hanging down by his side as if they had no
strength. This last circumstance alludes to the imbecility of this age.
His temple is in the greatest repute of any now in India.</NOTE> in
Orissa, where it is held a crime to make any distinction. The first and
most noble tribe are the Brahmins, who alone can officiate in the
priesthood, like the Levites among the Jews. They are not however excluded
from government, trade, or agriculture, though they are strictly prohibited
from all menial offices by their laws. They derive their name from Brimha, who
they allegorically say, produced the Brahmins from his head, when he created
the world.</P>
<P> <PB N="xxxii" REF="41"/> The second in order is the Sittri tribe, who
are sometimes distinguished by the name of Kittri or Koytri. They,
according to their original institution, ought to be all mili∣tary men; but
they frequently follow other professions. Brimha is said to have produced
the Kittri from his heart, as an emblem of that courage which warriors should
possess.</P>
<P>The name of Beise or Bise is given to the third tribe. They are for
the most part, merchants, bankers, and bunias or shop-keepers. These are
figuratively said to have sprung from the belly of Brimha; the word Beish
signifying a provider or nourisher. The fourth tribe is that of Sudder.
They ought to be menial servants, and they are incapable to raise
themselves to any superior rank. They are said to have proceeded from the
feet of Brimha, in allusion to their low degree. But indeed it is contrary to
the inviolable laws of the Hindoos, that any person should rise from an
inferior cast into a higher tribe. If any therefore should be
excom∣municated from any of the four tribes, he and his posterity are forever
shut out from society of every body in the nation, excepting that of the
Harri cast, who are held in utter detes∣tation by all the other tribes, and
are employed only in the meanest and vilest offices. This circumstance
renders excom∣munication so dreadful, that any Hindoo will suffer the
tor∣ture, and even death itself, rather than deviate from one article of his
faith. This severity prevented all intermixture of blood between the tribes,
so that, in their appearance, they seem rather four different nations, than
members of the same community.</P>
<P>It is, as we have already observed, a principle peculiar to the Hindoo
religion, not to admit of proselytes. Instead of <PB N="xxxiii" REF="42"/>
being solicitous about gaining converts, they always make a mystery of
their faith. Heaven, say they, is like a palace with many doors, and every
one may enter in his own way. But this charitable disposition never
encouraged other sects to settle among them, as they must have been
excluded en∣tirely from all the benefits of society.</P>
<P>When a child is born, some of the Brahmins are called. They pretend,
from the horoscope of his nativity, to fore∣tel his future fortune, by means
of some astrological tables, of which they are possessed. When this
ceremony is over, they burn incense, and make an offering according to the
circumstances of the parent; and without ever consulting them, tie the
zinar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A string which all the Hindoos wear, by way of
charm or amulet.</NOTE> round the infant's neck, and impose a name upon him,
according to their own fancy.</P>
<P>Between the age of seven and ten, the children are, by their parents,
given away in marriage. The young pair are brought together, in order to
contract an intimacy with one another. But when they approach to the years of
pu∣berty, they carefully separate them, till the female produces signs of
womanhood. She then is taken from her parents to cohabit with her husband:
nor is she ever after permitted to visit them. It is not lawful among the
Hindoos to marry nearer than the eighth degree of kindred. Polygamy is
per∣mitted, but seldom practised; for they very rationally think, that one
wife is sufficient for one man.</P>
<P>The extraordinary custom of the women burning them∣selves with their
deceased husbands, has, for the most part, fallen into desuetude in
India; nor was it ever reckoned a <PB N="xxxiv" REF="43"/> religious duty, as
has been very erroneously supposed in the West. This species of
barbarity, like many others, rose originally from the foolish
enthusiasm of feeble minds. In a text in the Bedas, conjugal affection and
fidelity are thus figuratively inculcated: 
<Q REND="inline">"The woman, in short, who dies with her husband,
shall enjoy life eternal with him in hea∣ven."</Q> From this source the
Brahmins themselves deduce this ridiculous custom, which is a more rational
solution of it, than the story which prevails in Europe; that it was a
poli∣tical institution, made by one of the Emperors, to prevent wives from
poisoning their husbands, a practice, in those days, common in
Hindostan.</P>
<P>People of rank and those of the higher casts, burn their dead and
throw some incense into the pile. Some throw the bodies of their friends
into the Ganges, while others expose them on the high ways, as a prey to
vultures and wild beasts. There is one cast in the kingdom of Bengal, who
barbarously expose their sick by the river's side to die there. They
even sometimes choak them with mud, when they think them past hopes of
recovery. They defend this in∣human custom by saying, that life is not an
adequate re∣compence for the tortures of a lingering disease.</P>
<P>The Hindoos have a code of laws in the NEA SHASTER. Treason, incest,
sacrilege, murder, adultery with the wife of a Brahmin, and theft, are
capital crimes. Though the Brahmins were the authors of those laws, we do not
find that they have exempted themselves from the punishment of death, when
guilty of those crimes. This is one of those numerous fables, which modern
travellers imported from the East. It is however certain, that the influence
of the <PB N="xxxv" REF="44"/> Brahmins is so great, and their characters as
priests so sacred, that they escape in cases where no mercy would be
shewn to the other tribes.</P>
<P>Petty offences are punished by temporary excommunica∣tions,
pilgrimages, penances and fines, according to the degree of the crime, and the
wealth of the guilty person. But as the Hindoos are now, for the most part,
subject to the Mahommedans, they are governed by the laws of the Koran, or by
the arbitrary will of the prince.</P>
<P>The Senasseys are a sect of mendicant philosophers, com∣monly
known by the name of Fakiers, which literally sig∣nifies poor people. These
idle and pretended devotees, assemble sometimes in armies of ten or
twelve thousand, and, under a pretext of making pilgrimages to certain
tem∣ples, lay whole countries under contribution. These saints wear no
clothes, are generally very robust, and convert the wives of the less holy
part of mankind to their own use, upon their religious progresses. They
admit any man of parts into their number, and they take great care to
instruct their disciples in every branch of knowledge, to make the order
the more revered among the vulgar.</P>
<P>When this naked army of robust saints direct their march to any
temple, the men of the provinces through which their road lies, very often fly
before them, notwithstand∣ing of the sanctified character of the Fakiers.
But the women are in general more resolute, and not only remain in their
dwellings, but apply frequently for the prayers of those holy persons,
which are found to be most effectual in cases of sterility. When a Takier
is at prayers with the lady of <PB N="xxxvi" REF="45"/> the house, he leaves
either his slipper or his staff at the door, which if seen by the
husband, effectually prevents him from disturbing their devotion. But
should he be so un∣fortunate as not to mind those signals, a sound
drubbing is the inevitable consequence of his intrusion.</P>
<P>Though the Fakiers inforce with their arms, that reverence which the
people of Hindostan have naturally for their or∣der, they inflict voluntary
penances of very extraordinary kinds upon themselves, to gain more respect.
These fellows sometimes hold up one arm in a fixed position till it
becomes stiff, and remains in that situation during the rest of their
lives. Some clench their fists very hard, and keep them so till their nails
grow into their palms, and appear through the back of their hands. Others turn
their faces over one shoulder, and keep them in that situation, till they
fix for ever their heads looking backward. Many turn their eyes to the point of
their nose, till they have lost the power of looking in any other
direction. These last, pretend some∣times to see what they call the
sacred fire, which vision, no doubt, proceeds from some disorder
arising from the distor∣tion of the optic nerves.</P>
<P>It often appears to Europeans in India, a matter of some ridicule to
converse with those distorted and naked philoso∣phers; though their
knowledge and external appearance, exhibit a very striking contrast. Some
are really what they seem, enthusiasts; but others put on the character
of sanc∣tity, as a cloak for their pleasures. But what actually makes them
a public nuisance, and the aversion of poor husbands, is, that the women
think they derive some holiness to them∣selves, from an intimacy with a
Fakier.</P>
<P> <PB N="xxxvii" REF="46"/> Many other foolish customs, besides
those we have mentioned, are peculiar to those religious mendicants. But
enthusiastic penances are not confined to them alone. Some of the vul∣gar,
on the fast of Opposs, suspend themselves on iron hooks, by the
flesh of the shoulder-blade, to the end of a beam. This beam turns round
with great velocity, upon a pivot, on the head of a high pole. The
enthusiast not only seems insensible of pain, but very often blows a
trumpet as he is whirled round above, and, at certain intervals, sings a
song to the gaping multitude below; who very much admire his fortitude and
devotion. This ridiculous custom is kept up to commemorate the sufferings
of a martyr, who was in that manner, tortured for his faith.</P>
<P>To dwell longer upon the characteristical customs and manners of the
Hindoos, would extend this dissertation too far. Some more particulars
concerning that nation, will naturally arise from an investigation of their
religion and philosophy. This last was the capital design of this
intro∣ductory discourse; and we hope to be able to throw a new, if not a
compleat light, on a subject hitherto little understood in the West. Some
writers have very lately given to the world, an unintelligible system of
the Brahmin religion; and they affirm, that they derived their information from
the Hindoos themselves. This may be the case, but they certainly
conversed upon that subject only with the inferior tribes, or with the
unlearned part of the Brahmins: and it would be as ridiculous to hope for a
true state of the reli∣gion and philosophy of the Hindoos from those
illiterate casts, as it would be in a Mahommedan in London, to rely upon the
accounts of a parish beadle, concerning the most abstruse points of the
Christian faith; or, to form his opi∣nion <PB N="xxxviii" REF="47"/> of the
principles of the Newtonian philosophy, from a conversation with an
English carman.</P>
<P>The Hindoos are divided into two great religious sects: the followers
of the doctrine of the BEDANG; and those who adhere to the principles of the
NEADIRSIN. As the first are esteemed the most orthodox, as well as the
most ancient, we shall begin to explain their opinions, by extracts
literally translated from the original SHASTER<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Shaster literally signifies Knowledge: but it is commonly
understood to mean a book which treats of divinity and the sciences. There
are many Shasters among the Hindoos; so that those writers who affirmed,
that there was but one Shaster in India, which, like the Bible of the
Christians, or Koran of the followers of Mahom∣med, contained the first
principles of the Brahmin saith, have deceived themselves and the
public.</NOTE>, which goes by the name of Bedang.</P>
<P>Bedang, the title of the Shaster, or commentary upon the Bedas,
concerning which we are about to treat, is a word compounded of Beda,
<HI>science,</HI> and Ang, <HI>body.</HI> The name of this Shaster
therefore, may be literally translated, the Body of science. This book has,
in Europe, been errone∣ously called Vedam; and it is an exposition of the
doctrine of the Bedas, by that great philosopher and prophet Beâss
Muni, who, according to the Brahmins, flourished about four thousand years
ago. The Bedang is said to have been revised some ages after
Beâss Muni, by one Sirrider Swami, since which it has been reckoned
sacred, and not subject to any further alterations. Almost all the
Hindoos of the De∣can, and those of the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, are
of the sect of the Bedang.</P>
<P> <PB N="xxxix" REF="48"/> This commentary opens with a dialogue between
Brimha<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Brimha is the genitive case of BRIMH, which is
a primitive signifying GOD. He is called Brimha or WISDOM, the first
attribute of the supreme divinity. The divine wisdom, under the name of
Brimha, is figuratively represented with one head, having four faces, looking
to the four quarters, alluding to his seeing all things. Upon the head of
this figure is a crown, an emblem of power and dominion. He has four hands,
implying, the omnipotence of divine wisdom. In the first hand he holds the
four Bedas, as a symbol of knowledge; in the second a scepter, as a token
of authority; and in the third a ring, or compleat circle, as an emblem of
eternity. Brimha holds nothing in the fourth hand, which implies, that THE
WISDOM OF GOD is always ready to lend his aid to his creatures. He is
represented riding upon a goose, the em∣blem of simplicity among the
Hindoos. The latter circumstance is intended to imply the simplicity of the
operations of nature, which is but another name for the wisdom of the
divinity. These explications of the insignia of Brimha, were given by the
Brah∣min, and are, by no means, conjectures of the author of this

Narud de∣sires to be instructed by his father, and for that purpose, puts
the following questions to him.</P>
<Q> 
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NARUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>O father! thou first of God<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Brimh.</NOTE>,
thou art said to have created the world, and thy son Narud, astonished
at what he be∣holds, is desirous to be instructed how all these things
were made.</P>
</SP> 
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRIMHA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not deceived, my son! do not imagine that I was the creator of
the world, independent of the divine mover<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The
supreme divinity.</NOTE>, who is the great original essence<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Pirrim Purrus; from PIR first, and PURRUS essence or
being.</NOTE>, and creator of all things. Look, therefore, only upon me as the
instrument of the great <PB N="xl" REF="49"/> WILL<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">ISH-BUR; from ISH will, and BUR great: commonly pronounced ISHUR.
This is one of the thousand names of GOD, which have so much perplexed the
writers of Europe. In the answer of Brimha, mention is made of the first
three great deities of the Hindoos; which three, however, they by no means
worship as distinct beings from God, but only as his principal
attributes.</NOTE>, and a part of his being, whom he called forth to execute
his eternal designs.</P>

<P>Being immaterial<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Nid-akar.</NOTE>, he is
above all conception; being in∣visible<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Oderissa.</NOTE>, he can have no form<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sirba-Sirrup.</NOTE>; but, from what we behold in his works, we
may conclude that he is eternal<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Nitteh.</NOTE>,
omnipotent<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ge-itcha.</NOTE>, knowing all things<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Subittera-dirsi.</NOTE>, and present every where<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Surba-Birsi. These are the very terms used in the
Bedang, in the definition of God, which we have liter∣ally translated in the
text. Whether we, who profess christianity, and call the Hin∣doos by the
detestable names of Pagans and Idolaters, have higher ideas of the supreme
divinity, we shall leave to the unprejudiced roader to determine.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>How did God create the world?</P>
</SP> 
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRIMHA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Affection<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Maiah, which signifies either
affection or passion.</NOTE>, dwelt with God, from all eternity. It was of
three different kinds, the creative<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Redjo-goon, the
creative quality.</NOTE>, the preserving<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sittohgoon,
the preserving quality.</NOTE>, and the destructive<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Timmugoon, the destructive quality.</NOTE>. This first is
represented by Brimha, the second <PB N="xli" REF="50"/> by Bishen<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">The preserver; Providence is personified under the name
of Bishen.</NOTE>, and the third by Shibah<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Shibah,
the foe of good.</NOTE>. You, O Narud! are taught to worship all the three,
in various shapes and like∣nesses, as the creator<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Naat.</NOTE>, the preserver<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Bishen.</NOTE>, and the destroyer<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Shibah. The Hindoos worship the destructive attribute of the
divinity, under the name of Shibah; but they do not mean evil by Shibah, for
they affirm, that there is no such thing but what proceeds from the free
agency of man.</NOTE>. The affection of God then produced power<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Jotna.</NOTE>, and power at a proper conjunction of time<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Kaal.</NOTE> and fate<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Addaristo.</NOTE>, embraced goodness<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Pir-kirti, from <HI>Pir</HI> good, and <HI>Kirti</HI> action.
God's attribute of goodness, is worshipped as a Goddess, under the name
of Pirkirti, and many other appellations, which comprehend all the virtues. It
has been ridiculously supposed in Europe, that PURRUS and PIRKIRTI were
the first man and woman, according to the system of the Hindoos; whereas
by Purrus is meant God, or emphatically, <HI>the Being</HI>; and by Pirkirti,
his attribute of goodness.</NOTE>, and produced matter<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mohat. In other places of the Bedang, matter is distinguished
by the name of Maha-tit, <HI>the great substance.</HI></NOTE>. The three
qualities then acting upon matter, produced the universe in the following
manner. From the opposite actions of the creative and destructive quality
in matter, self-motion<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ahankar. The word literally
signifies self-action.</NOTE> first arose. Self-motion was of three
kinds; the first inclining to plasticity<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rajas.</NOTE>, the second to discord<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Tamas.</NOTE>, and the third to rest<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Satig.</NOTE>. The discordant actions then produced the
Akash<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">A kind of celestial element. The Bedang in
another place, speaks of akash as a pure impalpable element, through which
the planets move. This element, says the philosopher, makes no
resistance, and therefore the planets continue their motion, from the
first impulse which they re∣ceived from the hand of Brimha or God; nor will
they stop, says he, till he shall seize them in the midst of their
course.</NOTE>, which invisible element possessed the quality of
conveying sound; it produced air<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Baiow.</NOTE>, a
palpable element, fire<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Tege.</NOTE>, a visible
element, water<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Joal.</NOTE>, a fluid element, and
earth<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Prittavi.</NOTE>, a solid element.</P>
<P>The Akash dispersed itself abroad. Air formed the
atmo∣sphere; fire, collecting itself, blazed forth in the host of 
<PB N="xlii" REF="51"/> heaven<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Dewta; of which Surage
the Sun is first in rank.</NOTE>; water rose to the surface of the earth,
being forced from beneath by the gravity of the latter element. Thus broke
forth the world from the veil of darkness, in which it was formerly
comprehended by God. Order rose over the universe. The seven heavens were
formed<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The names of the seven heavens are, Bu, Buba,
Surg, Moha, Junnoh, Tapu, and Sutteh. The seven worlds are, Ottal, Bittal,
Suttal, Joal, Tallattal, Rissatal, and Pattal. The author of the
dissertation, by a negligence which he very much regrets, forgot to get the
proper explanation of those names, or the uses to which the seven heavens
were converted.</NOTE>, and the seven worlds were fixed in their places;
there to remain till the great dissolution<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Mah-pirly.</NOTE>, when all things shall be absorbed<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Mucht.</NOTE> into God.</P>
<P>God seeing the earth in full bloom, and that vegetation<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Birgalotta.</NOTE> was strong from its seeds, called forth for
the first time, In∣tellect<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Mun.</NOTE>, which he
endued with various organs and shapes, to form a diversity of animals<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Jount.</NOTE> upon the earth. He endued the animals with
five senses, feeling, seeing, smelling, tasting, and hearing<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">The five senses are, Suppursina, Chowkownu, Nasiga,
Rissina, Kurnowa.</NOTE>. But to man he gave reflexion 
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Manus.</NOTE> to raise him above the
beasts of the field.</P>
<P>The creatures were created male and female<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Nir and Madda signifies male and female.</NOTE>, that they might
propagate their species upon the earth. Every herb bore the seed of its
kind, that the world might be cloathed with verdure, and all animals provided

<P>Shall not then the souls of good men receive rewards? Nor the

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRIMHA.</SPEAKER>
<P>The souls of men are distinguished from those of other
animals; for the first are endued with reason<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Upiman.</NOTE> and with a consciousness of right and wrong.
If therefore man shall adhere to the first, as far as his powers shall
extend, his soul, when disengaged from the body by death, shall be
absorbed into the divine essence, and shall never more re-animate
flesh. But the souls of those who do evil<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mund.</NOTE>, are not, at death, disengaged from all the
elements. They are immediately cloathed with a body of fire, air, and akash,
in which they are, for a time, punished in hell<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Nirick. The Hindoos reckon above eighty kinds of hells, each
proportioned to the degree of the wickedness of the persons punished
there. The Brahmins have no idea that all the sins that a man can commit in
the short period of his life, can deserve eternal punishment; nor that
all the virtues he can exercise, can merit perpetual felicity in
heaven.</NOTE>. After the season of <PB N="xliv" REF="53"/> their grief is

<P>It is a participation of the divine nature, where all passions
are utterly unknown, and where consciousness is lost in bliss<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">It is somewhat surprising, that a state of
unconsciousness, which in fact is the same with annihilation, should
be esteemed by the Hindoos as the supreme good; yet so it is, that they
always represent the <HI>absorbed state,</HI> as a situation of perfect
insensibility, equally destitute of pleasure and of pain. But Brimha
seems here to im∣ply, that it is a kind of delirium of joy.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>They must alone for their crimes in hell, where they must remain

<SPEAKER>NARUD.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is time<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Kaal. It may not be improper,
in this place, to say something concerning the Hindoo method of computing
time. Their least subdivision of time is, the Nemish or twinkling of an
eye. Three Nemish's make one Kaan, fifty Kaan one Ligger, ten Liggers one
Dind, two Dinds one Gurry, equal to forty-five of our minutes; four Gurries one
Pâr, eight Pârs one Dien or day, fifteen Diens one Packa, two
Packas one Mâsh, two Mâshes one Ribbi, three Ribbis one Aioon
or year, which only con∣sists of 360 days, but when the odd days, hours and
minutes, wanting of a solar year, amount to one revolution of the moon, an
additional month is made to that year to ad∣just the Callendar. A year of 360
days, they reckon but one day to the Dewtas or host of Heaven; and they
say, that twelve thousand of those planetary years, make one revolution
of the four Jugs or periods, into which they divide the ages of the world. The
Sittoh Jug or age of truth contained, according to them, four thousand
planetary years. The Treta Jug, or age of three, contained three thousand
years. The Duapur Jug, or <HI>age of two,</HI> contained two thousand; and
the Kallé Jug, or age of pollution, consists of only one thousand.
To these they add two other periods, between the dissolution and
renovation of the world, which they call Sundeh, and Sundass, each of a
thousand planetary years; so that from one Maperly, or great
dissolution of all things, to ano∣ther, there are 3,720,000 of our
years.</NOTE>?</P>

</SP> </Q>
<P> <PB N="xlvi" REF="55"/> Here ends the first chapter of the Bedang. The
second treats of providence and free will; a subject so abstruse,
that it was impossible to understand it, without a compleat knowledge of
the Shanscrita. The author of the Bedang, thinking perhaps, that the
philosophical catechism which we have translated above, was too pure for
narrow and su∣perstitious minds, has inserted into his work, a strange
alle∣gorical account of the creation, for the purposes of vulgar theology. In
this tale, the attributes of God, the human passions and faculties of the
mind are personified, and intro∣duced upon the stage. As this allegory may
afford matter of some curiosity to the public, we shall here translate
it.</P>
<Q> 
<P>BRIMH existed from all eternity, in a form of infinite di∣mensions.
When it pleased him to create the world, he said, <HI>Rise up, O
Brimha</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">The wisdom of God.</NOTE>. Immediately a
spirit of the colour of flame issued from his navel, having four heads
and four hands, Brimha gazing round, and seeing nothing but the immense
image, out of which he had proceeded, he tra∣velled a thousand years, to
endeavour to comprehend its dimensions. But after all his toil, he found
himself as much at a loss as before.</P> 
<P>Lost in amazement, Brimha gave over his journey. He fell prostrate
and praised what he saw, with his four mouths. The almighty, then, with a
voice like ten thousand thun∣ders, was pleased to say: Thou hast done
well, O Brimha, for thou canst not comprehend me!—Go and create the
world!—How can I create it?—Ask of me, and power shall be given
unto thee.—O God, said Brimha, thou art almighty in power!—</P> 
<P> <PB N="xlvii" REF="56"/> Brimha forthwith perceived the idea of things,
as if floating before his eyes. He said, LET THEM BE, and all that he saw
became real before him. Then fear struck the frame of Brimha, lest those
things should be annihilated. O immortal Brimh! he cried, who shall
preserve those things which I behold. In the instant a spirit of a blue
colour issued from Brimha's mouth, and said aloud, I WILL. Then shall
thy name be Bishen<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The providence of God.</NOTE>,
because thou hast undertaken to preserve all things.</P> 
<P>Brimha then commanded Bishen to go and create all ani∣mals, with
vegetables for their subsistance, to possess that earth which he
himself had made. Bishen forthwith created all manner of beasts, fish,
foul, insects and reptiles. Trees and grass rose also beneath his
hands, for Brimha had invested him with power. But man was still wanting to
rule the whole: and Brimha commanded Bishen to form him. Bishen began the
work, but the men he made were idiots with great bellies, for he could not
inspire them with knowledge; so that in every thing but in shape, they
re∣sembled the beasts of the field. They had no passion but to
satisfy their carnal appetites.</P> 
<P>Brimha, offended at the men, destroyed them, and pro∣duced four
persons from his own breath, whom he called by four different names. The name
of the first was Sin∣noc<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Body.</NOTE>, of the
second, Sinnunda<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Life.</NOTE>, of the third,
Sonnatin<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Permanency.</NOTE>, and of the fourth,
Sonninkunar<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Intellectual existence.</NOTE>. These
four persons were ordered by Brimha, to rule over the creatures, and to
possess <PB N="xlviii" REF="57"/> for ever the world. But they refused
to do any thing but to praise God, having nothing of the destructive
quality<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Timmu-goon.</NOTE> in their composition.</P> 
<P>Brimha, for this contempt of his orders, became angry, and lo! a brown
spirit started from between his eyes. He sat down before Brimha, and
began to weep: then lifting up his eyes, he asked him, 
<Q REND="inline">"Who am I, and where shall be the place of my
abode."</Q> Thy name shall be Rudder<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The weeper;
because he was produced in tears. One of the names of Shibah, the
destructive attribute of the Divinity.</NOTE>, said Brimha, and all nature
shall be the place of thine abode. But rise up, O Rudder! and form man to
govern the world.</P> 
<P>Rudder immediately obeyed the orders of Brimha. He be∣gan the work, but
the men he made were fiercer than tigers, having nothing but the destructive
quality in their compositions. They, however, soon destroyed one another,
for anger was their only passion. Brimha, Bishen, and Rudder then joined
their different powers. They created ten men, whose names were, Narud, Dico,
Bashista, Birga, Kirku, Pulla, Pulista, Ongira, Otteri and Murichi<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The significations of these ten names are in order, these.
Reason, Ingenuity, Emulation, Humility, Piety, Pride, Patience, Charity,
Deceit, Mortality.</NOTE>: The general appellation of the whole, was the
Munies<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The Inspired.</NOTE>. Brimha then produced
Dirmo<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fortune.</NOTE> from his breast, Adirmo<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Misfortune.</NOTE> from his back, Loab<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Appetite.</NOTE> from his lip, and Kâm<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Love.</NOTE> from his heart. This last being a beautiful female,
Brimha looked upon her with amorous eyes. But the Munies told him, that she
was his own daughter; upon which he shrunk back, and produced a blushing
virgin called Ludja<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Shame.</NOTE>. Brimha thinking his
body defiled by throwing his <PB N="xlix" REF="58"/> eyes upon Kâm,
changed it, and produced ten women, one of which was given to each of the
Munies.</P> </Q>
<P>In this division of the Bedang Shaster, there is a long list of
the Surage Buns, or children of the sun, who, it is said, ruled the world
in the first periods. But as the whole is a mere dream of imagination, and
scarcely the belief of the Hindoo children and women, we shall not
trespass further on the patience of the public with these allegories. The
Brahmins of former ages wrote many volumes of romances upon the lives and
actions of those pretended Kings, incul∣cating, after their manner, morality
by fable. This was the grand fountain from which the religion of the vulgar in
India was corrupted; if the vulgar of any country re∣quire any adventitious aid
to corrupt their ideas, upon so mysterious a subject.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the opinions of the author of the Be∣dang, upon the
subject of religion, are not unphilosophical. He maintains that the world
was created out of nothing by God, and that it will be again annihilated. The
unity, infi∣nity and omnipotence of the supreme divinity are inculcated by
him: for though he presents us with a long list of infe∣rior beings, it is
plain that they are merely allegorical; and neither he nor the sensible
part of his followers believe their actual existence. The more ignorant
Hindoos, it cannot be denied, think that these subaltern divinities do
exist, in the same manner, that Christians believe in Angels: but the
unity of God was always a fundamental tenet of the uncorrupted faith of the
more learned Brahmins.</P>
<P> <PB N="l" REF="59"/> The opinion of this philosopher, that the soul,
after death, assumes a body of the purer elements, is not pecu∣liar to the
Brahmins. It descended from the Druids of Eu∣rope, to the Greeks, and was the
same with the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of Homer. His
idea of the manner of the transmigration of the human soul into various
bodies, is peculiar to himself. As he holds it as a maxim that a portion of
the GREAT SOUL or God, animates every living thing; he thinks it no ways
inconsistent, that the same portion that gave life to man, should
afterwards pass into the body of any other animal. This transmigration does
not, in his opinion, debase the quality of the soul: for when it extricates
itself from the fetters of the flesh, it reassumes its original
nature.</P>
<P>The followers of the BEDANG SHASTER do not allow that any physical
evil exists. They maintain that God created all things perfectly good, but
that man, being a free agent, may be guilty of moral evil: which, however, only
respects himself and society, but is of no detriment to the general
system of nature. God, say they, has no passion but bene∣volence: and
being possessed of no wrath, he never punishes the wicked, but by the
pain and affliction which are the natural consequences of evil actions. The
more learned Brahmins therefore affirm, that the hell which is men∣tioned in
the Bedang, was only intended as a mere bug∣bear to the vulgar, to inforce upon
their minds, the duties of morality: for that hell is no other than a
consciousness of evil, and those bad consequences which invariably
fol∣low wicked deeds.</P>
<P>Before we shall proceed to the doctrine of the NEADIRSEN SHASTER, it
may not be improper to give a translation of the <PB N="li" REF="60"/> first
chapter of the DIRM SHASTER, which throws a clear light upon the religious
tenets, common to both the grand sects of the Hindoos. It is a dialogue
between Brimha, or the wisdom of God; and Narud, or human reason.</P>

<P>God neither eats nor drinks like mortal men. But if you love not
God, your offerings will be unworthy of him; for as all men covet the good

prayed for husbands, and they had all their desires gratified in one night,

</SP> </Q>
<P>Without making any reflections upon this chapter of the DIRM SHASTER, it
appears evident, that the religion of the Hindoos has hitherto been very much
misrepresented in Europe. The followers of the NEADIRSEN SHASTER, differ
greatly in their philosophy, from the sect of the BEDANG, though both agree
about the unity of the supreme being. To give some idea of the Neadirsen
philosophy, we shall, in this place, give some extracts from that
Shaster.</P>
<P>NEADIRSEN is a compound from NEA, signifying right, and DIRSEN, to
teach or explain; so that the word may be <PB N="lvi" REF="65"/> translated
an <HI>exhibition of truth.</HI> Though it is not reckoned so antient as the
Bedang, yet it is said to have been written by a philosopher called Goutam,
near four thousand years ago. The philosophy contained in this Shaster,
is very ab∣struse and metaphysical; and therefore it is but justice to
Goutam to confess, that the author of the dissertation,
not∣withstanding the great pains he took to have proper defini∣tions of the
terms, is by no means certain, whether he has fully attained his end. In this
state of uncertainty he chose to adhere to the literal meaning of words,
rather than by a free translation, to deviate perhaps from the sense of
his author.</P>
<P>The generality of the Hindoos of Bengal, and all the northern provinces
of Hindostan, esteem the NEADIRSEN a sa∣cred Shaster; but those of
the Decan, Coromandel, and Ma∣labar, totally reject it. It consists of
seven volumes. The first only came to the hands of the author of the
dissertation, and he has, since his arrival in England, deposited it in
the British Museum. He can say nothing for certain, concern∣ing the
contents of the subsequent volumes; only that they contain a compleat
system of the theology and philosophy of the Brahmins of the Neadirsen
sect.</P>
<P>Goutam does not begin to reason, <HI>a priori,</HI> like the writer of
the Bedang. He considers the present state of nature, and the
intellectual faculties, as far as they can be investi∣gated by human
reason; and from thence he draws all his conclusions. He reduces all things
under six principal heads; substance, quality, motion, species,
assimulation, and construction<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">These are in the
original Shanscrita, Dirba, Goon, Kirmo, Summania, Bishesh,
Sammabac.</NOTE>. In substance, besides time, space, life, 
<PB N="lvii" REF="66"/> and spirit, he comprehends earth, water, fire, air,
and akash. The four grosser elements, he says, come under the immediate
comprehension of our bodily senses; and akash, time, space, soul
and spirit, come under mental perception.</P>
<P>He maintains, that all objects of perception are equally real, as we
cannot comprehend the nature of a solid cubit, any more than the same
extent of space. He affirms, that distance in point of time and space,
are equally incompre∣hensible; so that if we shall admit, that space is
a real ex∣istence, time must be so too. That the soul, or vital
prin∣ciple, is a subtile element, which pervades all things; for that
intellect, which, according to experience in animals, cannot proceed from
organization and vital motion only, must be a principle totally distinct
from them.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The author of the Bedant<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">A
system of sceptical philosophy, to which many of the Brahmins
adhere.</NOTE>," says Goutam, "finding the impossibility of forming an
idea of substance, asserts, that all nature is a mere delusion. But
as imagination must be acted upon by some real existence, as we cannot
conceive that it can act upon itself, we must conclude, that there is
some∣thing real, otherwise philosophy is at an end."</Q></P>
<P>He then proceeds to explain what he means by his second principle, or
Goon, which, says he, comprehends twenty-four things; form, taste, smell,
touch, sound, number, quantity, gravity, solidity, fluidity, clasticity,
conjunction separation, priority, posteriority, divisibility,
indivisibility, ac∣cident, perception, ease, pain, desire, aversion,
and power<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The twenty-four things are, in the
Shanscrita, in order these; Rup,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, Gund, Supursi, Shubardo,
Sirika, Putriman, Cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, Dirbitte,
Sinniha, Shanskan, San∣goog, Bibag, Pirrible, Particca, Apporticta,
Addarillo, Bud, Suc, Duc, Itcha, Desh, Jotna.</NOTE>. <PB N="lviii" REF="67"/>
Kirmo or motion is, according to him, of two kinds, direct and crooked.
Sammania, or species, which is his third principle, includes all animals and
natural productions. Bi∣shesh he defines to be a tendency in matter towards
produc∣tions; and Sammabae, or the last principle, is the artificial
construction or formation of things, as a statue from a block of marble, a
house from stones, or cloth from cotton.</P>
<P>Under these six heads, as we have already observed, Gou∣tam
comprehends all things which fall under our compre∣hension; and after having
reasoned about their nature and origin, in a very philosophical manner, he
concludes with asserting, that five things must of necessity be
eternal. The first of these is Pirrum Attima, or the GREAT SOUL, who,
says he, is immaterial, one, invisible, eternal, and indivisible,
possessing omniscience, rest, will, and power<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">These properties of the divinity, are the following in order;
Nidakaar, Akitta, Oderisa, Nitte, Apparticta, Budsirba, Suck, Itcha,
Jotna.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The second eternal principle is the Jive Attima, or the vi∣tal soul,
which he supposes is material, by giving it the fol∣lowing properties;
number, quantity, motion, contraction, extension, divisibility, perception,
pleasure, pain, desire, aver∣sion, accident, and power. His reasons for
maintaining, that the <HI>vital soul</HI> is different from the <HI>great
soul,</HI> are very nu∣merous, and it is upon this head that the followers of
the Bedang and Neadirsen are principally divided. The first affirm that
there is no soul in the universe but God, and the second strenuously
hold that there is, as they cannot con∣ceive, that God can be subject to
such affections and passions as they feel in their own minds; or that he
can possibly have a propensity to evil. Evil, according to the author of
the <PB N="lix" REF="68"/> Neadirsen Shaster, proceeds entirely from Jive
Attima, or the vital soul. It is a selfish craving principle, never to be
satisfied; whereas GOD remains in eternal rest, without any desire but
benevolence.</P>
<P>Goutam's third eternal principle is time or duration, which, says he,
must of necessity have existed, while any thing did exist; and is
therefore infinite. The fourth prin∣ciple is space or extension, without
which nothing could have been; and as it comprehends all quantity, or rather is
infinite, he maintains, that it is indivisible and eternal. The fifth eternal
principle is Akash, a subtile and pure element, which fills up the vacuum
of space, and is compounded of purmans or quantities, infinitely small,
indivisible and per∣petual. 
<Q REND="inline">"God," says he, "can neither make nor annihi∣late
these atoms, on account of the love which he bears to them, and the
necessity of their existence; but they are, in other respects, totally
subservient to his pleasure."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"God," says Goutam, "at a certain season, endued
these atoms, as we may call them, with Bishesh or plasticity, by virtue
of which they arranged themselves into four gross elements, fire, air,
water, and earth. These atoms being, from the beginning, formed by God into
the <HI>seeds</HI> of all pro∣ductions, Jive Attima, or the vital soul,
associated with them, so that animals, and plants of various kinds, were
produced upon the face of the earth."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The same vital soul," continues Goutam, "which
be∣fore associated with the Purman of an animal, may after∣wards
associate with the Purman of a man."</Q> This transmi∣gration 
<PB N="lx" REF="69"/> is distinguished by three names, Mirt, Mirren, and
Pirra-purra-purvesh, which last literally signifies <HI>the change of
abode.</HI> The superiority of man, according to the philosophy of the
Neadirsen, consists only in the finer organization of his parts, from
which proceed reason, reflexion, and me∣mory, which the brutes only
possess in an inferior degree, on account of their less refined
organs.</P>
<P>Goutam supposes, with the author of the Bedang, that the soul
after death, assumes a body of fire, air, and akash, un∣less in the
carnal body, it has been so purified by piety and virtue, that it retains no
selfish inclinations. In that case it is absorbed into the GREAT SOUL
OF NATURE, never more to reanimate flesh. Such, says the philosopher,
shall be the reward of all those who worship God from pure love and
admiration, without any selfish views. Those that shall wor∣ship God
from motives of future happiness, shall be indul∣ged with their desires
in heaven, for a certain time. But they must also expiate their crimes, by
suffering adequate punishments; and afterwards their souls will return to
the earth, and wander about for new habitations. Upon their return to the
earth, they shall casually associate with the first organized Purman
they shall meet. They shall not retain any consciousness of their
former state, unless it is revealed to them by God. But those favoured
persons are very few, and are distinguished by the name of Jates
Summon<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">The acquainted with their former
state.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The author of the Neadirsen teaches, for the purposes of morality,
that the sins of the parents will descend to their posterity; and that,
on the other hand, the virtues of the children will mitigate the punishments
of the parents in <PB N="lxi" REF="70"/> Nirick, and hasten their return to
the earth. Of all sins he holds ingratitude<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mitterdro.</NOTE> to be the greatest. Souls guilty of that black
crime, says he, will remain in hell, while the sun remains in heaven, or to
the general dissolution of all things.</P>
<P>Intellect, says Goutam, is formed by the combined action of the
senses. He reckons six senses: five external<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Onnuman, reason. Upimen, perception.</NOTE>, and one internal.
The last he calls Manus, by which he seems to mean conscience. In the
latter he comprehends reason, perception<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chakous,
Shraban, Rasan, Granap, Tawass.</NOTE> and memory: and he concludes, that
by their means only, mankind may possibly acquire knowledge. He then
proceeds to explain the manner by which these senses act.</P>
<P>Sight, says he, arises from the Shanskar or repulsive qua∣lities
of bodies, by which the particles of light which fall upon them, are reflected
back upon the eyes from all parts of their surfaces. Thus the object is
painted in a perfect manner upon the organ of seeing, whither the soul
repairs to receive the image. He affirms, that, unless the soul fixes its
attention upon the figure in the eye, nothing can be per∣ceived by the mind;
for a man in a profound reverie, though his eyes are open to the light,
perceives nothing. Colours, says Coutam, are particular feelings in the eye,
which are proportioned to the quantity of light reflected from any solid
body.</P>
<P>Goutam desines hearing in the same manner with the European
philosophers, with this difference only, that he <PB N="lxii" REF="71"/>
supposes, that the sound which affects the ear, is conveyed through the
purer element of akash, and not by the air; an error which is not very
surprizing, in a speculative philo∣sopher. Taste, he defines to be a
sensation of the tongue and palate, occasioned by the particular form of
those particles which compose food. Smell, says he, proceeds from the
effluvia which arise from bodies to the nostrils. The feel∣ing, which
arises from touching, is occasioned by the con∣tact of dense bodies with
the skin, which, as well as the whole body, excepting the bones, the hair and
the nails, is the organ of that sense. There runs, says he, from all
parts of the skin, very small nerves to a great nerve, which he
distinguishes by the name of Medda. This nerve is com∣posed of two
different coats, the one sensitive, and the other insensitive. It
extends from the crown of the head, down the right side of the vertebrae to
the right foot<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">To save the credit of Goutam, in this
place, it is necessary to observe, that anatomy is not at all known among
the Hindoos, being strictly prohibited from touch∣ing a dead body, by the
severest ties of religion.</NOTE>. When the body becomes languid, the
soul, fatigued with action, re∣tires within the insensible coat, which
checks the operation of the senses, and occasions sound sleep. But
should there remain in the soul, a small inclination to action, it
starts into the sensitive part of the nerve, and dreams immediately
arise before it. These dreams, says he, invariably relate to something
perceived before by the senses, though the mind may combine the ideas
together at pleasure.</P>
<P>Manus, or conscience, is the internal feeling of the mind, when it is
no way affected by external objects. Onnuman, or reason, says Goutam, is
that faculty of the soul which enables us to conclude that things and
circumstances exist, <PB N="lxiii" REF="72"/> from an analogy to things,
which had before fallen under the conception of our bodily senses: For
instance, when we see smoak, we conclude that it proceeds from a fire;
when we see one end of a rope, we are persuaded that it must have
another.</P>
<P>By reason, continues Goutam, men perceive the existence of God;
which the Boad or Atheists deny, because his ex∣istence does not come
within the comprehension of the senses. These atheists, says he,
maintain, that there is no God but the universe; that there is neither good
nor evil in the world; that there is no such thing as a soul; that all
animals exist, by a mere mechanism of the organs, or by a fermentation of
the elements; and that all natural produc∣tions are but the fortuitous
concourse of things.</P>
<P>The philosopher refutes these atheistical opinions, by a long
train of arguments, such as have been often urged by European divines. Though
superstition and custom may biass reason to different ends, in
various countries, we find a surprising similarity in the arguments
used by all nations, against the BOAD, those common enemies of every
system of religion.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Another sect of the BOAD, says Goutam, are of
opinion that all things were produced by chance<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Addaristo.</NOTE>."</Q> This doctrine he thus refutes. Chance is
so far from being the origin of all things, that it has but a momentary
existence of its own; being alternately created and annihilated, at periods
infi∣nitely small, as it depends entirely on the action of real 
<PB N="lxiv" REF="73"/> essences. This action is not accidental, for it
must inevi∣tably proceed from some natural cause. Let the dice be rattled
eternally in the box, they are determined in their motion, by certain
invariable laws. What therefore we call chance, is but an effect proceeding
from causes which we do not perceive.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Perception," continues Goutam, "is that faculty by
which we instantaneously know things without the help of reason. This is
perceived by means of relation, or some distinguishing property in
things, such as high and low, long and short, great and small, hard and
soft, cold and hot, black and white."</Q></P>
<P>Memory, according to Goutam, is the elasticity of the mind, and is
employed in three different ways; on things present as to time, but absent
as to place; on things past, and on things to come. It would appear from the
latter part of the distinction, that the philosopher comprehends
imagination in memory. He then proceeds to define all the original properties
of matter, and all the passions and faculties of the mind. He then
descants on the nature of generation.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Generation, says he, may be divided into two kinds;
Jonidge, or generation by copulation; and adjonidge, gene∣ration without
copulation. All animals are produced by the first, and all plants by the
latter. The purman or seed of things, was formed from the beginning, with all
its parts. When it happens to be deposited in a matrix suitable to its
nature, a soul associates with it; and, by assimulating 
<PB N="lxv" REF="74"/> more matter, it gradually becomes a creature or plant;
for plants, as well as animals, are possessed of a portion of the
<HI>vital soul</HI> of the world."</Q></P>
<P>Goutam, in another place, treats diffusely of providence and free
will. He divides the action of man under three heads: The will of God, the
power of man, and casual or accidental events. In explaining the first, he
maintains a particular providence; in the second, the freedom of will in man;
and in the third, the common course of things, according to the general laws
of nature. With respect to providence, though he cannot deny the
possibility of its existence, without divesting God of his omnipotence,
he supposes that the deity never exerts that power, but that he remains in
eternal rest, taking no concern, neither in hu∣man affairs, nor in the
course of the operations of nature.</P>
<P>The author of the Neadirsen maintains, that the world is subject to
successive dissolutions and renovations at certain stated periods.
He divides these dissolutions into the lesser and the greater. The
lesser dissolution will happen at the end of a revolution of the Jugs.
The world will be then consumed by fire, and the elements shall be jumbled
together, and after a certain space of time, they will again resume their
former order. When a thousand of those smaller dissolutions shall
have happened, a MAHPER∣LEY or great dissolution will take place. All the
elements will then be reduced to their original Purmans or atoms, in which
state they shall long remain. God will then, from his mere goodness and
pleasure, restore Bisheth or plasti∣city. A new creation will arise;
and thus things have <PB N="lxvi" REF="75"/> revolved in succession, from
the beginning, and will con∣tinue to do so to eternity.</P>
<P>These repeated dissolutions and renovations have fur∣nished an
ample field for the inventions of the Brahmins. Many allegorical systems of
creation are upon that account contained in the Shasters. It was for this
reason, that so many different accounts of the cosmogony of the Hindoos
have been promulgated in Europe; some travellers adopting one system, and
some another. Without deviating from the good manners due to those writers,
we may venture to affirm, that their tales, upon this subject, are extreamly
puerile, if not absurd. They took their accounts from any common Brahmin,
with whom they chanced to meet, and never had the curiosity or industry to
go to the fountain head.</P>
<P>In some of the renovations of the world, Brimha, or the wisdom of
God, is represented in the form of an infant with his toe in his mouth,
floating on a comala or water flower, or sometimes upon a leaf of that plant,
upon the watery abyss. The Brahmins mean no more by this allegory, than that
at that time, the wisdom and designs of God will ap∣pear, as in their
infant state. Brimha floating upon a leaf, shews the instability of
things at that period. The toe which he sucks in his mouth, implies that
infinite wisdom subsists of itself; and the position of Brimha's
body, is an emblem of the endless circle of eternity.</P>
<P>We see Brimha sometimes creeping forth from a winding shell. This
is an emblem of the untraceable way by which divine wisdom issues sorth
from the <HI>infinite ocean of</HI> <PB N="lxvii" REF="76"/> <HI>God.</HI> He,
at other times, blows up the world with a pipe, which implies, that the earth
is but a bubble of vanity, which the breath of his mouth can destroy. Brimha,
in one of the renovations, is represented in the form of a snake, one end
of which, is upon a tortoise which floats upon the vast abyss, and upon
the other, he supports the world. The snake is the emblem of wisdom, the
tortoise is a symbol of security, which figuratively signifies
providence, and the vast abyss is the eternity and infinitude of God.</P>
<P>What has been already said has, it is hoped, thrown a new light on the
opinions of the Hindoos, upon the subject of religion and philosophical
inquiry. We find that the Brahmins, contrary to the ideas formed of them in the
west, invariably believe in the unity, eternity, omniscience and
omnipotence of God: that the polytheism of which they have been accused, is
no more than a symbolical worship of the divine attributes, which they
divide into three principal classes. Under the name of BRIMHA, they
worship the wisdom and creative power of God; under the appellation of
BISHEN, his providential and preserving quality; and under that of SHIBAH,
that attribute which tends to destroy.</P>
<P>This system of worship, say the Brahmins, arises from two
opinions. The first is, that as God is immaterial, and consequently
invisible, it is impossible to raise a pro∣per idea of him, by any
image in the human mind. The second is, that it is necessary to strike
the gross ideas of man, with some emblems of God's attributes, otherwise,
that all sense of religion will naturally vanish from the mind. They, for
this purpose, have <PB N="lxviii" REF="77"/> made symbolical
representations of the three classes of the divine attributes; but they
aver, that they do not believe them to be separate intelligences. BRIMH, or
the supreme divinity, has a thousand names; but the Hindoos would think it
the grossest impiety to represent him under any form. 
<Q REND="inline">"The human mind, say they, may form some conception
of his attributes separately, but who can grasp the whole, within the
circle of finite ideas."</Q></P>
<P>That in any age or country, human reason was ever so depraved as to
worship the work of hands, for the creator of the universe, we believe to
be an absolute deception, which arose from the vanity of the abettors of
particular systems of religion. To attentive inquirers into the human mind,
it will appear, that common sense, upon the affairs of religion, is pretty
equally divided among all nations. Revelation and philosophy have, it is
confessed, lopped off some of those superstitious ex∣crescences
and absurdities that naturally arise in weak minds, upon a subject so
mysterious: but it is much to be doubted, whether the want of those
necessary pu∣rifiers of religion, ever involved any nation in gross
ido∣latry, as many ignorant zealots have pretended.</P>
<P>In India, as well as in many other countries, there are two religious
sects; the one look up to the divinity, through the medium of reason and
philosophy; while the others receive, as an article of their belief, every
holy legend and allegory which have been transmitted down from antiquity.
From a fundamental article in the Hindoo <PB N="lxix" REF="78"/> faith, that God
is <HI>the soul of the world,</HI> and is conse∣quently diffused through
all nature, the vulgar revere all the elements, and consequently every great
natural object, as containing a portion of God; nor is the infi∣nity of the
supreme being, easily comprehended by weak minds, without falling into this
error. This vene∣ration for different objects, has, no doubt, given rise
among the common Indians, to an idea of subaltern intelligences; but the
learned Brahmins, with one voice, deny the existence of inferior divinities;
and, indeed, all their religious books of any antiquity, confirm that
assertion.</P>

<HEAD>A CATALOGUE OF THE GODS OF THE HINDOOS.</HEAD>
<P>TO prevent future writers from confounding them∣selves and others,
by mistaking synonimous names of the Gods of the Hindoos, for different
intelligences, we here present the public with a catalogue of them, as taken
from an original book of the Brahmins. A list of proper names, especially
in a foreign language, is so very dry of itself, that it is superfluous
to advise such as are not particularly inqui∣sitive upon this subject,
to pass entirely over this list, as it can afford very little
amusement.</P>
<P>BRIMH, or the supreme being, is distinguished by a thou∣sand
names, in the Shanscrita, according to the Brahmins; but it is to be
observed, that in that number they include the names of all those powers,
properties, and attributes, which they conceive to be inherent in the divine
nature, as well as the names of all those symbols and material
essences, <PB N="lxxii" REF="80"/> under which God is worshipped. Those
commonly used are, Ishbur, the great will; Bagubaan, the receptacle of
goodness; Narrain, the giver of motion; Pirrimpurrous, the first
essence; Niringen, the dispassionate; Nidakar, the immaterial.</P>
<P>BRIMHA, or God, in his attribute of wisdom, is worship∣ped under
the following names. Attimabah, the good spi∣rit. Beda, science. Beddatta,
the giver of knowledge. Bisheshrick, the flower of the creation.
Surrajist, Purmisti, Pittamah, Hirinagirba, Lokessa, Saimbu,
Chottranun, Dat∣ta, Objajoni, Birrinchi, Commalasein, Biddi.</P>
<P>BISHEN, or God in his providential quality, is worshipped under the

<P>In the same manner as the power of God is figuratively said to
have taken upon itself three masculine forms at the creation; so
PIRKITTI, or the goodness of God, is said to have taken three feminine
forms. The first of these was Drugah, or Virtue, who, say they, was
married to Shibah, to intimate that good and evil are so blended together,
that they could not have existed separately; for had there been no such
thing as evil, in consequence there could be no good. She is worshipped in
this character under the names of Bowani, courage; Maiah, love; Homibutti,
Ishura, Shi∣bae, Rudderani, Sirbani, Surba-mungula, Appurna, Parbutti,
Kattaini Gouri, and a variety of other names.</P>
<P>As the consort of Bishen, she is worshipped under the names of
Litchmi, which signifies fortune; Puddamah, Leich, Commala, Siri
Horripria.</P>
<P>As the consort of Brimha, she is generally known by the names of
Sursitti, which means the bestower of wisdom; Giandah, the giver of
reason; Gire, Baak, Bani, Sardah, Brimhapira.</P>
<P>Besides the above six capital divisions of the divine
attri∣butes, they raise temples to GRANESH, or policy, whom they worship at
the commencement of any design, by the names of Biggenrage, Binnauck,
Deimatar, Gunnadebo, Eckdant, Herrumboo, Lumbodre, Gunjanund. This divinity is
feign∣ed <PB N="lxxiv" REF="82"/> to be the first born son of Shibah, and is
represented with the head of an elephant, with one tooth only.</P>
<P>KARTICK, or Fame, is also worshipped under various names as
follows; Farruck-gite, Mahasin, Surjunmah, Sur∣ranonno, Parbutti-nundun,
Skunda Sonnani, Agnibu, Guha, Bahulliha, Bishaka, Shuckibahin, Shanmattara,
Shuckliddir, Cummar, Corrim-chidarna. He is said to be the second son of
Sibah.</P>
<P>CAM-DEBO, the spirit of love, is also known by the names of
Muddun, Mannumut, Maro, Purrudumun, Minckatin, Kundurp, Durpako, Annungah,
Pansusur, Shwaro, Sumbe∣rari, Munnusigah, Kusshumesha, Ommenidja,
Passbadinna, Kulliputti, Nackera-dija, Ratimoboo: he is said to be the
first born of Bishen.</P>
<P>COBERE, or wealth, is known by the following names; Trumbuca-suca,
Juckrage, Gudja-kessera, Monnusa-dirma, Dunnedo, Raja Raja, Donnadippa,
Kinaresso, Borsserbunnu, Pollusta, Narru-bahin, Joikaika, Ellabilla,
Srida Puneja∣nisherah. Nill Cobere the son of wealth, is also
represented in the emblems of luxury, but is seldom worshipped.</P>
<P>SOORAGE, or the Sun, is worshipped under the names of Inder, or the
King of the Stars; Mohruttan, Mugubah, Bi∣raja, Packsasen, Birdirsisba,
Sonnasir, Purruhutta, Purrinder, Gistnow, Likkersubba, Sockor,
Sukamunneh, Debasputti, Suttrama, Gottrabit, Budgeri, Basub, Bitterha,
Bastosputti, Suraputti, Ballaratti, Satchiputti, Jambubedi, Horriheia,
Su∣rat, Nomisinundun, Sonkrindana, Dussibina, Turrasat, Ne∣gabahina,
Akindilla, Sorakah, Ribukah.</P>
<PB N="lxxv" REF="83"/>
<P>CHUNDER, or the Moon, is worshipped under
the names of Hindoo, Himmanchu, Chundermah, Kumuda-bandibah, Bid∣du, Sudduns,
Subransu, Ossadissa, Nishaputti, Objoja, Soom, Gullow, Merkanku,
Kollandi, Dirjarage, Sesudirra, Nuhti∣tressa, Kepakina.</P>
<P>Besides all the above, they have divinities which they sup∣pose
to preside over the elements, rivers, mountains, &amp;c. or rather worship
all these as parts of the divinity, or on a sup∣position of his
existence in all things.</P>
<P>AGUNNI, or the God of fire, hath thirty-five names. Bir∣ren, or the
God of water, ten names. Baiow, or the God of air, twenty-three names; all
which are too tedious to mention.</P>
<P>The JUM are fourteen in number, and are supposed to be spirits
who dispose of the souls of the dead.</P>
<P>The USSERA are beautiful women, who are feigned to reside in heaven,
and to sing the praises of God.</P>
<P>The GUNDIRP are boys who have the same office.</P>
<P>The RAKISS are ghosts or spectres who walk about the earth.</P>
<P>The DEINTS or OISSURS are evil spirits or demons, who were expelled
from heaven, and are now said to live under ground.</P>
<P>The DEOS or DEBOS, are spirits whose bodies are supposed to be
of the element of fire; they are sometimes represented 
<PB N="lxxvi" REF="84"/> beautiful as angels, and at other times in horrible
forms; they are supposed to inhabit the air.</P>
<P>Such is the strange system of religion which priestcraft has
imposed on the vulgar, ever ready in all climes and ages to take advantage of
superstitious minds. There is one thing however to be said in favour of
the Hindoo doctrine, that while it teaches the purest morals, it is
systematically formed on philosophical opnions. Let us therefore no
longer imagine half the world more ignorant than the stones which they seem
to worship, but rest assured, that whatever the external ceremo∣nies of
religion may be, the self-same infinite Being is the object of universal
adoration.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ancient history of the Hindoos
fa∣bulous.</NOTE>THERE is no history among the Hindoos, of better authority
than the Mahabarit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mahabarit signifies, the great
war. Our author has in this section given a spe∣cimen of the legends
contained in that book.</NOTE>, which Shech Abul Fazil translated into
Persian, in the reign of Akbar. It consists of about one hun∣dred and
twenty thousand periods<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ashlogues or
Stanzas.</NOTE> in the original Shanscrita, in a kind of long blank verse.
We shall from this author select the par∣ticulars which relate to the
history of the Hindoos.</P>
<P> <PB N="2" REF="88"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their division of time.</NOTE>The Hindoos divide
the age of the world into four grand periods or jugs: the Sat Jug, the Treta
Jug, the Duapur Jug, and the Cal Jug. They believe that when the Cal Jug is
finished, the Sat Jug will com∣mence again, and that thus time will revolve
in eternal succession. The Sat Jug is said to have been a period of
fourteen millions and four hundred thousand years, and it is represented as
the age of felicity, in which there was nothing but truth, religion,
happiness, peace, plenty, and independence; and that the life of man extended
to one hundred thousand years.</P>
<P>The Treta Jug is said to contain one million and eighty thousand
years, in which, it is said, that in the composition of mankind, there were
three fourths truth, and one fourth falsehood, and that the age of man
extended to ten thousand years. The Duapur Jug is said to contain seventy
two thousand years, in which two parts of the com∣position of man were
truth, and two parts falsehood, his age extend∣ing to one thousand years.
The Cal Jug contains thirty six thousand years, in which period three
fourths of the composition of man con∣sisted of falshood, and only one
fourth of truth, his age being one hundred years.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brimha creates the world.</NOTE>It is the opinion
of the Hindoos, that God first created five ele∣ments; Fire, Water, Air,
Earth, and Akash, or a Celestial Ele∣ment of which the heavens are made. He
afterwards created a kind of being endued with perfect wisdom, whom he called
Brimha, and commanded him to make the world. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and mankind.</NOTE>When Brimha had created mankind
out of nothing, he divided them into four tribes; the Brah∣min, the Kittri, the
Bise, and the Sudur. The first tribe were to be priests, to direct man in
the ways of God; the second rulers and pos∣sessors of the earth; the
third labourers; and the fourth tradesmen and servants; which division is
strictly maintained to this day.</P>
<P> <PB N="3" REF="89"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Author of the Bedas.</NOTE>Brimha, say they,
wrote a book which he called the Beda, by the order of God, in which he
affirms, that all things were originally God, and that all things shall be
resolved into him again; that hap∣piness consists in virtue, and that
vice will be punished with misery. To regulate the ceremonies of religion,
and to instruct men how to govern the world, he has in the Beda given a canon
of laws, founded upon the principles of justice. But as the Bedas are covered
with a veil of darkness by the Brahmins, we cannot say much more for
cer∣tain concerning them. The Hindoos affirm, that Brimha lives for ever, or,
as some say, one hundred years, in which each day is com∣puted at four
hundred revolutions of the Jugs. We shall here give a specimen of the early
history of the Hindoos.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Specimen of the ancient history of the
Hindoos.</NOTE>It is recorded in the Mahabarit, that about the middle of the
third period, there was a Raja of the tribe of Kittiri, in the city of
His∣tinapoor, whose name was Birt. He ruled the kingdom of Hindo∣stan,
and his issue after him in lineal descent for eight generations, in peace
and tranquillity. The ninth in succession, whose name was Kour, we are
told, founded the city of that name, which is now called Tannassar, and is
about 70 crores from Delhi. He was the father of the tribe who are still
called Kours.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ditarashter being blind, his brother succeeds
to the throne.</NOTE>In the thirteenth generation from Kour, Chitterbourge
reigned, and was esteemed a great prince. He had two sons, one named
Ditarashter, and the other Pind. But when Ditarashter grew up, he became
blind, and therefore his father left the kingdom to his younger son, who had
five children; Judishter, Brimsein, and Arjun, by one wife, and Nucul and
Sedive, by another woman. But his elder brother Ditarashter had sons one
hundred and one, by a variety of women, among whom one was named Jirjodin,
being the eldest of his children by the first wife, and another was called
Jutush, being his first born by a second spouse. In short, when
Pind died, the in∣heritance <PB N="4" REF="90"/> descended by right to the
heirs of his elder brother Ditar∣ashter, so that Jirjodin became king.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Differences between their children.</NOTE>But the
children of Pind regarded Jirjodin as an enemy, and waited an opportunity to
divest him of his authority. Ditarashter, fearing distur∣bances,
advised his son to build a palace without the city for the sons of Pind,
in which for some time they consented to reside. In the mean time
Jirjodin had privately ordered the workmen who built this palace to fill up
several vaults with combustibles, and hired an old woman to set fire to
them, at a proper opportunity. But the plot being discovered accidentally by
the sons of Pind, they themselves set fire to the mine, and burnt the old
woman and her five sons in the flames, while they privately withdrew into the
wilderness, where they remained for some time, the king imagining they had
been destroyed in the fire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sons of Pind shew themselves at
Cumpula.</NOTE>The sons of Pind ventured at length into a certain city called
Cum∣pula, where they wedded Diropti, the Raja's daughter, with whom they lived
by turns, for the space of seventeen days. In a short time, however, it
was noised abroad, that the sons of Pind were not dead, as was
supposed, which reaching the ears of the king, he ordered enquiry to be
made, and found that truth was in the report. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are invited to court.</NOTE>Anxious to have them
again in his power, he wrote to them affectionate letters, inviting them to
Histinapoor, to share with him the inheritance of their forefathers. They
were at length prevailed upon by his fair promises, returned to court, and
were treated in every respect becom∣ing their dignity. A part of the kingdom
was allotted for their main∣tenance, for upon their arrival they became so
much beloved by the people and nobility, that the king was afraid to lay
violent hands upon them. Their popularity daily increasing, and their party
being strengthened by many of the principal nobility, they at length openly
insisted upon a division of the empire in their favour, which the king
being in no condition to refuse, complied with without hesitation.</P>
<P> <PB N="5" REF="91"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The feast of the period.</NOTE>Some time after
these transactions Judishter gave the feast of the period<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jog-Rajasou, somewhat similar to the secular games among
the Romans.</NOTE>, the manner of which is said to be this: They lighted a
prodigious fire, and threw into it every kind of spice, perfume, fruit, and
grain. At this feast it was necessary that all the Rajas of the earth
should be present. Judishter, in order to invite the Rajas, sent his
four brothers to the four quarters of the world, that by the favour of God his
design in a short time might be accomplished. His bro∣thers, according to
his desire, from Arab, from Agim, from Tur∣kistan, from Habysh, and other
countries, brought those princes to be present at this grand festival.
Jirjodin, on observing the greatness of Judishter, burnt with envy at his
fortune, and contrived this scheme to deprive his rival of his kingdoms and
wealth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sons of Pind banished for twelve
years.</NOTE>It was the custom in those days to play at dice, and Jirjodin,
hav∣ing made a false set, challenged Judishter to play, which being
accepted by him, he in a short time, in the presence of the princes, lost
all his wealth and kingdoms. Jirjodin told him then, that he would give him one
more chance to recover the whole, but that if he again should lose, he
must retire, with all his brothers, for the space of twelve years into
banishment, and if during that interval he was to be seen in his former
dominions, he was to remain in banish∣ment twelve years more. Judishter,
hoping that fortune would not always be unkind, consented to these terms,
but having lost as before, he was constrained by the princes, who were
umpires, to relinquish his kingdoms to Jirjodin, and retire into banishment
with his brethren from Inderput, his capital city, now known by the name of
Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Send an am∣bassador to demand their share
of the kingdom.</NOTE>Twelve years they lay concealed in the wilderness, in
such a man∣ner that the tread of their feet was not heard; and when the time
of their exile expired, they dispatched Kishen, the son of Basdeo, to
de∣mand the restoration of their kingdoms. Jirjodin, notwithstanding 
<PB N="6" REF="92"/> of his promise, made a jest of the embassy, and
turned the ambassa∣dor with scorn from his presence. The sons of Pind
finding that they could do nothing without force, began to collect their
friends, of whom they had many; and in a short time they appeared in the
field of Kirket, near the city of Tanassar, at the head of a mighty army,
in the beginning of the Cal Jug. Jirjodin advancing with his army, after having
drawn up his troops in array, encouraged the ranks of the valiant. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A battle.</NOTE>The soldiers on both sides,
according to the custom of battle, began to work, for death; the contest
was renw'd, with dubious advantages, for the space of eighteen days, till at
length, Jirjodin, with most of his friends, as the reward of his per∣fidy,
drank the cup of fate in the field of war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Incredible number of both armies.</NOTE>The
Hindoos say, that in this war, Jirjodin commanded eleven cohin, and the
sons of Pind seven: a cohin, according to their fabu∣lous accounts,
consisted of twenty-one thousand eight hundred and seventy elephants of
war, an equal number of chariots, six thousand six hundred and ten
horsemen, and one hundred and nine thousand three hundred and fifty foot.
Of all this incredible number, they say that only twelve men survived on
both sides, four on the part of Jirjodin, and eight on the part of
Judishter; among the latter was the ambassador Kishen Basdeo, who is
esteem'd a great prophet among the Hindoos. They say, that the
astrologers gave advice to Raja Kuns, who ruled in the city of Muttra, that
Kishen should one day take away his life; upon which he sought every
opportunity to put Kishen to death: but Kishen, knowing the designs of
his foe, retired to a place called Nind, where he lived with a shepherd
eleven years. He ventured at length into the world, and collecting a body of
men together, who were dissatisfied with the government of Kuns, he made
war upon him and put him to death, setting up Ogursein, the father of Kuns,
in the kingdom; and he himself lived afterwards thirty-two years, at the head
of the administration at Muttra. Raja Jeradsing, from the country of
Barounia, came at <PB N="7" REF="93"/> length with a great army, towards Muttra,
to turn Kishen from his place. At the same time came from the east, Raja
Callioon, and attacked him on the other side. Kishen, not able to oppose
these two Rajas, fled towards Duarka, which is on the coast of the Salt
Sea, and was there besieg'd for the space of eighteen years, where some
say he died; but the superstitious aver that he is still alive, and
therefore they pay him divine honors.</P>
<P>They relate that after the Mahabarit, which signifies the great
war, Judishter having overcome Jirjodin, ruled the whole empire of
Hindostan for thirty-six years, when being disgusted with the vanity
and pomp of the world, he retired into a mountain, dividing his wealth and
empire among his friends, and lived the life of religion and poverty the
remainder of his days. The reign of Jirjodin and Judishter is said to be
one hundred and twenty-five years. Such are the tales of the Hindoos concerning
an age too dark and distant to be distinctly known.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Of the Origin of the Hindoos<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Though our author begins his accounts of Hindostan with the
stood, yet like the annals of other nations, there is little to be depended
upon in the history of that country, for some ages after that supposed
period. This must rather be ascribed to the ignorance of the Mahommedans in
the Shanscrita language, than to a real want of ancient monu∣ments among the
Hindoos themselves. In the first centuries of the Higerah, truth be∣gins to
beam forth with lustre in his accounts of India, and that with more
precision and minuteness than any history we have of any European nation,
in so early a period.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the Hindoos.</NOTE>AS the best and
most authentic historians agree that Adam was the father of mankind,
whose creation they place about five thousand years before the Higerah, the
sensible part of mankind, who love the plainness of truth better than the
extravagance of fable, <PB N="8" REF="94"/> have rejected the marvellous
traditions of the Hindoos, concerning the transactions of a hundred
thousand years, and are of opinion that they, like other nations, are the
descendants of the sons of Noo, who peopled the world. The Hindoos pretend
to know nothing of the flood; however, as this event is supported by the
testimony of all other nations, there is little room to doubt of its truth,
and we shall, therefore, proceed to trace the Hindoos from that great aera,
according to the best authorities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sons of Noo or Noah</NOTE>We are told that
Noo had three sons, Sham, Eaphs and Ham. Sham, the eldest, had nine sons,
Arshud, Arphashud, Bood, Khe, Simood, Aram, Kibt, Aad and Keitan. All the
tribes of Arabs, Abraham and the prophets, were of the race of Arphashud, and
his second son Keiomours, is said to be the first king of Agim<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Media.</NOTE>, and his sons were six, Shamuc, Pharis,
Iraac, Billou, Shaam and Mogaan. Shamuc inherited the kingdom after the death
of his father, whereas the other sons dispersing themselves, laid the
foundation of monar∣chies, which pass'd by their names.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eaphs or Japhet.</NOTE>Eaphs, according to the
desire of his father, turned his face to the north-east, where he had many
sons and daughters. The name of his first-born was Turc, from whence all
the tribes of the Turks, Moguls, Usbecks, Chigettas, Turkumanians and
Rumians<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The European Turks are called Rumians,
by the eastern nations, from their pos∣sessing the empire of the
Romans in the lesser Asia.</NOTE>. The name of the second son was
Chin, who laid the foundation of the mighty monarchy of China; and the third,
whose name was Rus, is said to be the father of those nations, who extend
themselves north∣ward, even into the regions of darkness, in the countries
of Muse, Ghiz and Eucolaat.</P>
<P> <PB N="9" REF="95"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ham, the progenitor of the Hindoos.</NOTE>Ham, by
the order of his illustrious father, turned his face to the south. He
also had many children: the name of the first was Hind, the second Sind,
the third Habysh<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Habysh, according to the
Mahommedans, was the progenitor of the Abyssinians.</NOTE>, the fourth
Zinge, the fifth Barber, and the sixth Nobah; from these, all the kingdoms,
distin∣guished by their names, took their rise. Hind, turning eastward,
possessed himself of the paradisial regions of Hindostan, where
he laid the foundation of his monarchy. His brother Sind, turning to the
south-east, possessed himself of the fertile plains of the
river<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The Indus.</NOTE>, and founding the city
of Tatta, ruled the kingdom of Moultan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sons of Hind.</NOTE>Hind had four sons,
one of whom was named Purib, another Bang, a third Decan, and a fourth Nerwaal.
They first inhabited the countries, known to this day by their names. To
Decan, the son of Hind, was born three sons, among whom he divided his
kingdom, Marhat, Conher and Tiling; and from them sprung these three great
tribes in the Decan, Marhattas, Conherias and Telingas. Nerwaal had also
three sons, Beroge, Cambage and Malrage, whose names descended to the
countries over which they ruled. Bang also had many children, who lived to
inherit the kingdom of Bengal. But Purib, the first-born of Hind, had
forty-two sons, who in a short time multiply'd exceedingly; but among
these, one of them whose name was Krishen, exalted himself above his
brethren.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. Of the Reign of Krishen, the Founder of the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Krishen first king of Hin∣dostan.</NOTE>LET
it not be concealed that the first who placed his foot on the musnud of
empire, in the region of Hindostan, was Krishen; but not that Krishen
whom the Hindoos worship, but a man of wisdom, policy, and courage. He was,
it is said, so fat a man, that finding no horse sufficiently strong
for his weight, he first, prompted by necessity, found out the art of
catching and taming elephants. In the reign of Krishen, it is also said,
that there lived a certain person of the race of Bang, whose name was
Brahma, wise and learned, whom Krishen made his vizier. This Brahma is
said to be the father of many arts, of writing and of working in wood and
iron. He was also the founder of the city of Oud, which be∣came the capital
of Krishen; and is said to have been the first regular imperial city of
Hindostan. When Krishen had lived to the age of four hundred years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is to say, Krishen, and such of his race as bore
his name, reigned four hun∣dred years over Hindostan. It is to be observed
that our author does not, properly speaking, begin his history till the
empire of Ghizni was founded by Subuetagl; his professed design being to
record the transactions of the Mahommedans in Hindostan. What therefore the
translator has distinguished under the title of the first part of this
history is no more than a dissertation prefixed to the original, in which
the domestic accounts of the Hindoos, concerning their ancient Kings, are

and of the peo∣ple, had ascended the throne, in the art of government he
soon rivall'd the same of his father, devoting his time to the just
ad∣ministration of his affairs. As the children of Brahma were skill'd in
the arts of their father, he continued the most expert of them as his vizier,
and appointed the rest his astrologers, physicians and priests, whence
some derive the origin of the Brahmins, who to this day exercise those
functions in Hindostan. Others of the nobility were appointed hereditary
governors of provinces, from whom the second great sect of the Hindoos are
supposed to derive their origin; while a third class were commanded to
cultivate the ground, and a fourth to employ themselves in such arts as
were necessary for the purposes of society. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marage di∣vides his sub∣jects into four
tribes.</NOTE>It was enacted, that this division of the subjects of Marage
into four grand departments should subsist for ever: and thus was laid
the foundation of the four great sects of Hindoos, Brahma, Kittri, Bise and
Sudur.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is a lover of learning.</NOTE>The wise and the
excellent Marage was a lover of learning. He invited philosophers from all
parts, and founded the city of Bahar for their reception; appropriating the
revenues of certain lands for their maintenance, and building several noble
edifices and temples for the worship of the true God. Of the length of his
reign, and the manner of his death, we have no particular accounts; neither are
we inform'd of the lives and actions of his successors, who are said to
have ruled over Hindostan, under the name and honours of <PB N="12" REF="98"/>
their father, during the space of seven hundred years, in which time the
country is said to have greatly encreas'd in riches, cultivation, and in the
number of its people. A friendly correspondence was kept up between the
imperial crowns of Hindostan and Iran<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Persia.</NOTE>, till at length one of the princes of the blood
of Hind, went in disgust to the presence of Feredoon, king of Iran. He
laid his complaints before the king, who ordered Kirshib, the son of
Attrid, with a numerous army, to recover his rights. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Persians, for the first time, invade
Hindostan.</NOTE>When Kirshib reach'd the kingdom of Hindostan, a war was
commenced, which continued, with various success, for the space of ten
years. The country suffered exceed∣ingly, till Marage was compell'd to give
up a part of his dominions to the fugitive prince, of whose name we have no
information, only that he was nephew to the then emperor. Marage thus procured
peace, and sent presents by the hand of Kirshib, to the king of Iran.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion in Ceylon.</NOTE>It is said, that
some time after, the governor of Shingeldiep<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ceylon.</NOTE> and Carnatic, trusting in his strength, blew up
the flames of rebellion, which was the occasion of a long and bloody war in
the Decan, in which the eldest son of the king lost his life, being
deserted in the fight by Showra, ruler of the Decan, who fled with his
discomfited army to the king. Marage, on hearing this news, writhed himself
like a snake with anger, and bit the finger of sorrow, because, before
that time, none of the rulers of the islands of Atchin, or the coasts of
Pegu or Malabar, had dared to dispute his commands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Second inva∣sion of the Persians.</NOTE>He
was, at the same time, threaten'd with an invasion from Iran; for Minuchere
had advanced as far as Moultan, with a mighty army, intending to make an entire
conquest of Hindostan. Marage sent Baal Chund, his general, against
him, who, finding that peace would be more advantageous at that juncture, than
war with this foreign enemy, prevailed on Minuchere, by large presents, to
return to <PB N="13" REF="99"/> Iran. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceylon redu∣ced.</NOTE>When Baal Chund had
accomplished this pacification, he was ordered by the king, to march to the

horse, and came just in time to save him from destruction; for Shinkol
had so closely invested him with a numerous army, that in a few days more
he must have perished with famine, or submitted himself to the mercy of
an enraged enemy. Afrasiab without delay assaulted Shin∣kol; the

<HEAD>SECTION XV. Of the Reign of Ramdeo Rhator.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 436.</NOTE>RAMDEO was of the tribe of
Rhator, a prince bold, wise, and generous. The first thing he did on his
accession, was to exterminate by degrees the chiefs and Rajas who
assumed indepen∣dency, and raised factions in the empire. Then he
advanced with his army towards Marvar, and recovered that country from the
tribe of Cutchwa, whom he dispossessed, and peopled it with that of
Rhator, from which time they have possessed it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These are the Mahrattas, who at present make such a figure
in India.</NOTE>. The tribe of <PB N="29" REF="115"/> Cutchwa was sent to the
precincts of Rhotas which they still inhabit. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His great actions.</NOTE>Ramdeo Rhator, after
these transactions, returned and marched towards Lucknouti, which he took
and gave to his nephew. Here great wealth fell into his hands, and after an
expedition of three years he returned to Kinnoge, where he remained two years,
and then marched his army towards Malava, which he conquered, and putting it in
the hands of his Vizier, ordered many cities and towns to be built in that
province. Having repaired the fort of Narvar, he appointed one of his kinsmen
governor, and demanded the daugh∣ter of the Raja of Bijanagur in marriage, who,
fearing the power of Ramdeo, complied. He remained in the city of Gundwara two
years, where he slew many of the rebellious Zemindars, then return∣ing to
Kinnoge spent seven years in festivity and pleasure.</P>
<P>Ramdeo afterwards went unto the mountains of Sawalic, and reduced
all the Rajas of those parts; particularly the Raja of Comaoon, whose
ancestors, according to the fabulous history of the Hindoos, had reigned
there ten thousand years. This Raja had drawn toge∣ther a powerful army, with
which he engaged Ramdeo in several great battles; so that for some time
the war was doubtful. At length the fortune of Ramdeo prevailed, and the Raja
of Comaoon was forced to abandon his wealth, and take refuge in the
inaccessible mountains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mountains of Comaoon lye
about two hundred miles North from Delhi.</NOTE>. His wives and daughters fell
into the hands of Ramdeo, who having softened him to compassion, he
restored to the Raja his country, and turned his face towards Nagracut,
plundering the country, till he reached Scutdimmindi. There he halted out of
respect to the temple of Bowani<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bowani is one
of the names of the Goddess Pirkirti, concerning whom see the
dissertation prefixed to this history.</NOTE>, which was built near the
sort of Nagracut, sending a person to call the Raja before him. The Raja
afraid for his life, delayed for some time till he had received proper 
<PB N="30" REF="116"/> assurances of personal safety, by the mediation
of a Brahmin; and then he waited on the King, and exhibited the customs of
obedience. Ramdeo went to pay his adoration to the idol, to whom he made rich
offerings, then retiring, demanded the daughter of the Raja in marriage for his
son, and marched to the fort of Jummu. The Raja of Jummu being strong in
troops and well supplied with money and provisions, confiding in the
strength of his fort and the inaccessible∣ness of the roads leading
towards it, despised the summons of the King, and refused to bend to
his commands, preparing himself for war. But in the first encounter in the
field, his irregular troops, though singly brave, were discomfited before
the united powers of the King, who driving him within his walls, immediately
invested the place, and storming it in a few days, imprisoned what part
of the garrison escaped the sword, and in the fort found great
wealth.</P>
<P>The Raja having previously fled into the mountains, saw no hope
but in peace, and therefore sollicited the mercy of the King. Ram∣deo
reinstated him, taking one of his daughters for his second son. Directing
his march from thence to the banks of the river Nerbet, which falls from the
mountains of Cashmire into the districts of Pun∣jaab, he traversed the
country of Hindostan to the salt sea of Bengal, where the great mountains
of Sewalic press upon the ocean. He accomplished this march in five months,
having reduced near five hundred disobedient Rajas and Zemindars. He
plundered them of their wealth, and then turned his victorious standards
towards his capital of Kinnoge, which he entered in pomp and triumph.</P>
<P>He soon after prepared a magnificent festival, and divided the
spoil among his soldiers, the share of each being forty pieces of gold.
Besides a third part of the spoil was thrown among the people. From this
time forward he reposed upon the throne of ease and mag∣nificence, nor ever
afterwards mounted the horse of war to hunt for further conquests. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dies.</NOTE>After he had reigned fifty four years,
he followed <PB N="31" REF="117"/> his ancestors to the unknown world, from
whence none return. But the great actions of his life rendered his fame

those Ma∣hommedans, by whom the Empire of Ghizni was formed.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First invasion of Hindostan by the
Ma∣hommedans.</NOTE>TO minds enlightened like the sun, let it not remain a
secret, That the first person of the faith who placed his foot within the
boundaries of Hindostan, was Mohlib, the son of Abiul Sukur. The
particulars of his history are these: In the twenty-eighth year of the
Higerah, Abdulla, the son of Amir, governor of Bussorah, by the command
of Osman, led an army towards Pharis, against the sovereign of that
kingdom, who had revolted upon the death of Omar. Abdulla reduced his enemy to
obedience, and returned vic∣torious to Bussorah. In the thirtieth of the
Higerah, Osman turned Olid Okbah, on account of his continuing to drink wine,
from the government of Kusa, which he conferred upon Seid ben ul Ass. That
commander marched the same year towards Tibiristan, ac∣companied by the two
sons of Ali, Hassen and Hassein, and con∣quered the country of Jirju,
whose capital is Ashtrabad, where he raised a contribution of forty
thousand dinars. Abdulla ben Amir, ruler of Bussorah, on the part of
Osman, in the thirty-first of the Higerah, marched to the conquest of
Chorrasan, by the way of <PB N="35" REF="121"/> Kirman, and having reduced
that country, Seistan, Keistan, Nesha∣poor, Sirchush, Herat,
Badyeish, Ghore, Girghistan, Murve, Ta∣lickan and Balich, he entered into a
treaty with a King of the north∣ern regions whose name was Joos; having
appointed Keis ben Hanim to the government of Chorrasan, Hanif ben Keis to
the su∣perintendency of Murve, Talickan and Neshapoor, and Chalid ben
Abdulla to that of Herat, Ghore and Gerghistan, he himself being bent on a
pilgrimage to Caba, marched back by the way of Hujage.</P>
<P>In the thirty-third year, Abdul Reiman, by order of Osman, having
marched with an army against Balich, he and all his troops became martyrs to
the faith, except a few, who escaped the sword and fled by the way of
Gilan. Sharon, who was an Omrah of Agim, seeing that Abdulla ben Amir had
gone a pilgrimage to Mecca, and that the plains of Chorrasan were clear of
Persians and Mussulmen, raised in the same year an army of forty
thousand men from Jibbis, Herat, Badyeish, Ghore, Keistan, and the
adjacent countries, and fell upon the Mussulmen. But Abdulla Hazim, who was
at Neshapoor with Hanif, with four thousand horse, attacked and defeated
him; for which service he was afterwards rewarded with the government of
Chorrasan.</P>
<P>In the forty-fourth year of the Higerah, Mavia ben Abessifian
advanced Zeiad ben Abiera to the government of Bussorah, Chorra∣san and
Seistan; and in that year, Abdul Reiman ben Summera, ac∣cording to the orders
of Zeiad, conquered the country of Cabul, and bound them over to obedience.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mohlib</NOTE>About the same time, Mohlib ben
abul Sukur, who was a great Omrah of Arab, by the way of Murve, invaded Cabul
and Zabul; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">enters Hin∣dostan.</NOTE>then entering
Hindostan, made war upon the idolators, ravaging <PB N="36" REF="122"/> the
country of Limgan and its dependencies, and with twelve thou∣sand captives
returned to Chorrasan. A few of the inhabitants of Hind were converted at
that time to the belief of the unity of God, and the embassy of his holy
prophet.</P>
<P>In the fifty-third of the Higerah, Zuad, governor of Bussorah,
died in consequence of a wound in his finger, and Mavia gave the government
of Kufa to Abdulla his son. Abdulla led his troops against the country of
Maver ul neer, which he conquered, and re∣turned to Kufa; after which he got
the government of Bussorah, and appointed Aslim ben Zerait ul Gulabi to
the government of Chorrasan: But in the year fifty-six, Mavia gave that
appointment to Seid ben Osman Affan; and again, in the year fifty-nine, that
government was changed into the hands of Abdul Reiman ben Zeiad.</P>
<P>In the sixty-second of the Higerah, Zeid ben Mavia appointed
Zillim ben Ziad to rule over Chorrasan and Seistan. Among the chiefs who
attended him, was Mohlib ben Abiull Sukur: This Zillim, when he had seated
himself in the government, gave his brother Izid the government of Seistan,
who hearing that the King of Cabul had imprisoned Abu Abida his brother, who
had been col∣lecting the tribute, he raised an army and marched towards him,
but after an obstinate battle he was defeated, and lost the greatest part
of his army.</P>
<P>Intelligence of this defeat coming to Zillim, he sent Tilla ben
Abudulla to Cabul, who ransomed Abu-Abida for five thousand dirms. He then
set aside his brother, and gave the government of Seistan to Tilla, who
sent the troops of Ghore and Badyeish to Cabul, and by that means reduced
that country to obedience, and conferred the government upon Chaled ben
Abdulla. This Chaled <PB N="37" REF="123"/> ben Abdulla being ordered some
time thereafter to return back and give an account of his administration,
fearing the oppression of new rulers, with his family, wealth and friends,
fled to the mountains of Soliman, which extend between Moultan and Peshawir,
and there took up his abode. He married his daughter to one of the chiefs of
the Afghans, who was a Mussulman: From this marriage sprung many
children, two of whom became famous, Load and Soor; from whom the two great
tribes of that name derive their origin. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the Afgans.</NOTE>In the history of

<P>The Mussulmen of Cabul, Chillige and Chore, hearing of these

obliged the Raja to accommodate matters, and give up several districts to
the Patans. The tribe of Chillige entered in the mean time into treaty with
them, in which the Patans guarantied the boundaries of Hindostan against
any foreign invasion by the way of Iran. To be able to fulfil the terms of

could have no rest from the incursions of the Mussulmen, raised a
great army with intent to invade them in their own country, which Sub∣uctagi
hearing, put his army in motion, and marched out to meet him. The Kings drew
near one another at Limghaan, on the boundaries of their respective
dominions: They skirmished for a few days, and Sultan Mamood, though then a
boy, gave such signal proofs of his courage, that he drew tears of joy from
the eyes of his father.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A miraculous storm,</NOTE>Historians, whose
credulity exceed their wisdom, have told us, that on this occasion, a
certain person informed the King, that in <PB N="43" REF="129"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 977. Higer. 367.</NOTE>the camp of Jeipal
there was a spring, into which, if a small quan∣tity of a certain drug,
called Casurat, should be thrown, the sky would immediately be
overcast, and a dreadful storm of hail and wind arise. Subuctagi having
accordingly ordered this to be done, the effects became visible, for
immediately the sky loured, and thunder, lightning, wind and hail began,
turning the day into dark∣ness, and spreading horror and desolation
around; insomuch that a great part of the cavalry were killed, and some
thousands of both armies perished; but the troops of Ghizni being more
hardy than those of Hindostan, suffered not so much upon this
occasion. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">which induces Jeipal to sue for
peace.</NOTE>Jeipal in the morning found his army in such weakness and
dejection, by the effects of this storm, which was rather natural than the
work of magic, that fearing Subuctagi would take advantage of his condition, he
sent Heralds to treat of a peace: He offered to the King of Ghizni a certain
tribute, and a considerable present in elephants and gold.</P>
<P>Subuctagi was not displeased with these terms, but his son,
Sultan Mamood, who was an ambitious young man, fearing this would put an end to
his expedition, prevailed with his father to reject the proposal. Jeipal,
upon this, told him that the customs of the Raja∣puts were of such a
nature, that if he persisted in distressing them, it must make him,
in the end, pay very dear for his victories. Upon such occasions, and when
reduced to extremity, said Jeipal, they murder their wives and children,
set fire to their houses, set loose their hair, and, rushing in
despair among the enemy, drown them∣selves in the crimson torrent of
revenge. Subuctagi hearing of this custom, he was afraid to reduce them to
despair, and consented to let them retreat upon their paying a million of
Dirms, and pre∣senting him with fifty elephants. Jeipal not being able to
discharge the whole of this sum in camp, he desired that some persons
of trust, <PB N="44" REF="130"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 977. Higer. 367.</NOTE>on the part of
Subuctagi, should accompany him to Lahore to re∣ceive the ballance; for
whose safety, Subuctagi took hostages.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His perfidy.</NOTE>Jeipal having arrived at
Lahore, and finding Subuctagi had returned home, imprisoned his
messengers, and refused to pay the money. It was then customary among
the Rajas, in affairs of moment, to assemble the double council, which
consisted of an equal number of the most respectable Brahmins, who
sat on the right side of the throne; and of the noblest Kittries, who
sat on the left. When they saw that Jeipal proceeded to such an impolitic
measure, they in∣treated the King, saying, that the consequence of this
step would bring ruin and distress upon the country; the troops said
they have not yet forgot the terror of their enemy's arms; and Jeipal may
rest assured, that a conqueror will never brook such an indig∣nity: It
was, therefore, the opinion of the double council, to com∣ply strictly with
the terms of the peace, that the people might enjoy the blessings of
tranquillity; but the King was obstinate, and would not hearken to their
advice.</P>
<P>Intelligence of what was done, soon reached the ears of Subuctagi;
like a foaming torrent he hastened towards Hindostan with a nume∣rous army,
to take revenge upon Jeipal for his treacherous behaviour; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Renews the war,</NOTE>Jeipal also collected his
forces, and marched forth to meet him; for the neighbouring Rajas,
considering themselves interested in his success, supplied him with
troops and money. The Rajas of Delhi, Aj∣mere, Callinger and Kinnoge, were now
bound in his alliance, and Jeipal found himself at the head of an army of a
hundred thousand horse, and two hundred thousand foot; with which he
marched with full assurance of victory.</P>
<P>When the moving armies approached each other, Subuctagi as∣cended
a hill, to view the forces of Jeipal, which he beheld like a 
<PB N="45" REF="131"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 978. Higer. 368.</NOTE>shoreless sea,
and in number, like the ants or the locusts; but he looked upon himself as
a wolf among a flock of goats: Calling there∣fore together his chiefs, he
encouraged them to glory, and honoured them distinctly with his commands. His
troops, though few in number, he divided into squadrons of five hundred each,
which he ordered one after another, to the attack in a circle, so that a
con∣tinual round of fresh troops harrassed the Indian army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and is de∣feated.</NOTE>The Hindoos being worse
mounted than the cavalry of Subuctagi, could effect nothing against them;
so that wearied out with this manner of fighting, confusion became
visible amongst them. Sub∣uctagi perceiving their disorder, sounded a
general charge, so that they fell like corn before the hands of the reaper;
and were pursued with great slaughter to the banks of the river Nilaab;
where many, who had escaped the edge of the sword, perished by their fear
in the waters.</P>
<P>Subuctagi acquired in this action much glory and wealth; for
besides the rich plunder of the Hindoo camp, he raised great con∣tributions
in the countries of Limghaan and Peshawir, and annexed them to his own
dominions, joined them to his titles, and stamped their names, as was
customary, upon his coins. One of his Omrahs, with three thousand horse,
was appointed to the government of Peshawir; and the Afghans who resided
among the mountains, having promised allegiance, he entertained some
thousands of them in his army, and returned victorious to Ghizni.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Subuctagi solicited for aid by the King of
Bochara.</NOTE>Amir Noo Samani, King of Bochara, being at this time hard
pressed by Faeck, sent Abu Niser Pharsi to Subuctagi to beg his
assistance. Subuctagi was moved by gratitude to the family of Boc∣hara,
and hastened with his army towards Maverulnere, while Amir Noo advanced to
the country of Sirchush to meet him. Subuctagi, <PB N="46" REF="132"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 978. Higer. 368.</NOTE>upon account of his
age, sent a messenger to Amir Noo, to excuse his lighting from his
horse; but when he advanced and recognized the features of his royal father,
in the face of the young prince, he could not suppress the emotions of his
heart. He leaped from his horse and run to kiss his stirrup, which the
young King perceiving, prevented him by dismounting and receiving him in his
embrace. At this happy interview the flower of joy bloomed in every face, and
such a knot of friendship was bound as can hardly be paralleled in any
age.</P>
<P>As the season was now too far advanced for action, it was agreed
that Subuctagi should return, during the winter, to Ghizni, and prepare his
forces to act in conjunction with those of Amir Noo in the spring. But when
Amir Ali Sumjure, prince of Chorassan, at whose court Faek was then in
treaty, heard of the alliance formed between Amir Noo and Subuctagi, he began
to fear the consequence of his engagement with Faeck. He asked his council
where he should take protection, in case fortune, which was seldom to be
depended upon, should desert his standards in war. They replied, that the
situation of affairs required he should endeavour to gain the alliance of
Fuchier ul Dowla, prince of Jirja. Jaffier zul Karmin was accordingly appointed
ambassador to the court of Jirja, with presents of every thing that was
valuable and curious: and in a short time a treaty of friendship and
alliance was settled between the two powers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The confede∣rates join their
armies.</NOTE>Subuctagi in the mean time put his troops in motion, and marched
towards Balich, where Amir Noo joined him with his forces from Bochara. The
rebel Faeck and Abu ali Sumjure hearing of this junction, with consent of
Dara the general of Fuchir ul Dowla Wil∣lami, marched out of Herat in great
pomp and magnificence. Subuctagi pitched his camp in an extensive plain,
where he waited for the enemy. They soon appeared in his front, he drew out
his army in order of battle, and took post in the center, with his son
Sultan Ma∣mood and Amir Noo.</P>
<P> <PB N="47" REF="133"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 978. Higer. 368.</NOTE>In the first charge
the troops of the enemy came forward with great violence and bravery, and
pressed so hard upon the flanks of Subuctagi, that both wings began to
give ground, and the whole army was upon the point of being defeated. But Dara
ben Kabus, the general of Fuchir ul Dowla, charging the centre where Subuctagi
in person led on his troops with great bravery, as soon as he had got near
threw his shield upon his back, which was a signal of friend∣ship, and
riding up to the King, begged he would accept of his ser∣vices. He then
returned with the few who had accompanied him, and immediately brought over his
troops to the side of Subuctagi, facing round on his deserted friends, who
were astonished at this unexpected treachery. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeat the rebels.</NOTE>Subuctagi took immediate
advantage of their confusion, charged them home, and soon put their whole

<P>Thus the unfortunate man who had exalted the spear of enmity
against his sovereign, lost his honour and his wealth, a tenth of which
might have maintained him and his family in splendor and happiness for
life.</P>
<P>Faeck and Abu Ali took in their flight the way of Neshapoor, with
the scattered remains of their army. Amir Noo and Subuctagi entered forthwith
the city of Herat, where they remained a few days to refresh their troops and
divide the spoil. Subuctagi after this sig∣nal victory received the title
of Nasir ul Dein, or the Supporter of the Faith, and his son Mamood was
dignified with that of Seif al Dowla, or the Sword of Fortune, by Amir Noo,
whom he still acknowledged as Emperor, though his power had been greatly
dimi∣nished at this period.</P>
<P> <PB N="48" REF="134"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 978. Higer. 368.</NOTE>Amir Noo, after
these transactions, directed his march to Bochara, and Subuctagi, and his
son Sultan Mamood turned their faces towards Neshapoor. Faeck and Abu Ali
fled into Jirja, and took pro∣tection with Fucher ul Dowla. The country being
thus cleared of the enemy, Subuctagi returned to Ghizni, while his son Sultan
Ma∣mood remained at Neshapoor with a small force. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood, the son of Subuc∣tagi,

a resolute charge against Subuc∣tagi, which was so well received that
they were obliged to give ground.

<P>Subuctagi reigned twenty years. Fourteen Kings of his race held
after him Lahore and the countries adjacent, within the circle of their
command. The Vizier of Subuctagi was Abul Abas Fazil ben Amud Ispherai, who
was a great minister in the management of both civil and military affairs.
The author of the Jam ul Hickaiat relates, <PB N="49" REF="135"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 997. Higer. 387.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">His character.</NOTE>that Subuctagi was at first a private
horseman in the service of Abis∣tagi, and being of a vigorous and active
disposition used to hunt every day in the forest. It happened one time
as he employed himself in this amusement, that he saw a deer grazing with
her young fawn, upon which, spurring his horse, he seized the fawn, and
tying his legs laid him across his saddle and turned his face towards his
home. When he had rode a little way, he looked behind and beheld the mother of
the fawn following him and exhibiting every mark of extream affliction. The
soul of Subuctagi melted within him into pity, he untied the feet of the fawn
and generously restored him to his liberty. The happy mother turned her
face to the wilderness, but often looked back upon Subuctagi, and the tears
dropt fast from her eyes.</P>
<P>Subuctagi is said to have seen that night a figure or apparition
in his dream, who said to him, That generosity and compassion which you
have this day shown to a distressed animal has been approved of in the
presence of God: therefore, in the records of Providence, the kingdom of
Ghizni is marked as a reward against thy name. But let not greatness
destroy your virtue, but thus continue your benevo∣lence to men.</P>
<P>It is said in the Masir ul Maluck, that Sultan Mamood his son,
having built a pleasure house in an elegant garden near the city of Ghizni,
he invited his father when it was finished to a magnificent entertainment
which he had prepared for him. The son, in the joy of his heart, desired
the opinion of Subuctagi concerning the house and garden, which were
esteemed admirable in taste and structure. The old man, to the great
disappointment of Mamood, told him, that he looked upon the whole as a
bauble, which any of his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bjects
might have raised by the means of wealth. But that it was the business of
a prince to erect the more durable structure of good same which might

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 997. Higer. 387.</NOTE>stand for ever, to
be imitated but never to be equalled by posterity. The great poet Nizami
makes upon this saying the following reflec∣tion. Of all the magnificent
palaces which we are told Sultan Ma∣mood built, we now find not one stone
upon another; but the edifice of his fame, as he was told by his father,
still triumphs over time, and seems established on a lasting

dying suddenly, and his eldest son, Sultan Ma∣mood, being at Neshapoor,
which was a considerable distance from the place of the King's decease,
Amir Ismaiel prevailed with his father, in his last moments, to appoint him
to succeed till the return of his brother. The reason assigned for this
demand, was to prevent other usurpations, which were then feared in the
government. Ismaiel therefore, immediately upon the demise of his father,
was crowned with great solemnity at Balich. To gain popularity, Ismaiel
opened the treasury and distributed the greatest part of his father's
wealth in presents to the nobility, and in expensive shews and
entertainments to the people. He also augmented the pay of the troops, and
rewarded small services with the hand of prodigality.</P>
<P>This policy being overacted had not the desired effect. The
nobi∣lity perceiving that all this generality proceeded from the fear of his
brother, ungenerously increased their demands, while the troops puffed up
with pride by his indulgences, begun to be mutinous, dis∣orderly and
debauched.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 997. Higer. 387.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood's behaviour, upon his bro∣ther's acces∣sion.</NOTE>When
intelligence was brought to Mamood of the death of his father, and the
accession of his younger brother, he wrote to Ismaiel by the hand of Abul
Hassen. In this letter he said thus, That since the death of his royal
father, he held none upon earth so dear as his beloved brother Amir
Ismaiel, whom he would oblige to the full extent of his power. But that the
art of government required years, experience, wisdom and knowledge, in the
affairs of state, which Ismaiel could not possibly pretend to
possess, though Subuc∣tagi had appointed him to succeed to the throne
in the absence of Mamood. He therefore advised Ismael seriously to
consider the mat∣ter, to distinguish propriety from impropriety, and to
give up his title to government without further dispute, which would
restore him to the love and generosity of Mamood; for that it was his
ori∣ginal intention to confer upon Ismaiel the governments of Balich and
Chorassan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">War between the brothers.</NOTE>Amir Ismaiel
shut his ears against all the proposals of his brother, and prepared for
his own security, turning the edge of the sword of enmity against him.
Sultan Mamood saw no remedy but in war, and attaching his uncle
Bujerâc, and his brother Nisir to his interest, advanced with his
standards towards Ghizni, while Amir Ismaiel hastened also from Balich
to oppose him. When the two armies approached towards one another, Sultan
Mamood took great pains to avoid coming to extremities, and in vain tried to
recon∣cile matters in an amicable manner. He was therefore forced to form his
troops in order of battle, while Amir Ismaiel also extended the lines of
war, which he supported by a chain of elephants. Both armies unsheathing
their steel, commenced such a slaughter that the swords wept blood.
Sultan Mamood at length charged the center of the enemy with such fury that
they trembled as with an earthquake, and turned their faces to slight, taking
refuge in the citadel of Ghizni. Thither the conqueror pursued them, and
immediately invested the <PB N="52" REF="138"/>

number of the runaways had crowded into Ghizni, that for want of provisions
Amir Ismaiel was reduced to the necessity of treating about a
surrender. Having therefore received promises of safety, he submitted
himself, and delivered up the keys of the garrison and the treasury to
Sultan Mamood.</P>
<P>Mamood having appointed a new ministry, and regulated the
government of the country, proceeded with his army towards Balich. It is
said, that a few days after the submission of Amir Ismaiel, he was
asked by his brother, What he intended to have done with him had his better
fortune prevailed? To which Ismaiel replied, That he intended to have
imprisoned him for life in some castle, and to indulge him with every
pleasure but his liberty. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is imprisoned and dies.</NOTE>Upon which Sultan
Ma∣mood made no reflections at that time, but soon after confined him in the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 997. Higer. 387.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Accession of Mamood. His character.</NOTE>WE are told by
historians, that Sultan Mamood was a King who conferred happiness upon the
world, and reflected glory upon the faith of Mahomed: that the day of his
accession illuminated the earth with the bright torch of justice, and
cherished it with the beams of beneficence. Others inform us, that in his
dis∣position, <PB N="53" REF="139"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 997. Higer. 387.</NOTE>the sordid vice of
avarice found place, which however could not darken the other bright qualities
of his mind. A certain poet says, that his wealth was like a pearl in the
shell; but as poets hunt after wit rather than truth, therefore we must
judge of Mamood by his actions, from which it appears that he was indeed a
prince of great oeconomy, but that he never withheld his generosity upon a
just and proper occasion. We have the testimony of the Fatti Bilad, wrote
by Abu Nisir Muscati, and of the famous Abul Fazil, that no King had ever
more learned men at his court, kept a finer army, or displayed more
magnificence than Sultan Mamood. All these things could not be done without
expence; so that the stigma of avarice must have been owing to two
particular circumstances of his life, which ought by no means to have
stamped his general character with that sordid vice.</P>
<P>The two circumstances in a few words were these. Having a great
propensity to poetry, in which he made some tolerable progress himself,
he promised Sheck Phirdoci a golden mher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A mher is
about fourteen rupees; this coin was called mher from having a sun stampt
upon it. Mher signifies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, in

desirous to patronize. Under the protection of this promise, that divine
poet wrote the un∣paralleled poem called the Shaw Namma, which consisted of
sixty thousand couplets. When he presented it to the King, he repented of
his promise, telling the poet, that he thought sixty thousand rupees
might satisfy him for a work which he seemed to have per∣formed with so
much ease and expedition. Phirdoci justly offended at this indignity, could
never be brought to accept of any reward, though Sultan Mamood would after
reflection have gladly paid him the sum originally stipulated; the poet,
however, took ample revenge in a satire of seven hundred couplets which he
wrote upon that occasion.</P>
<P> <PB N="54" REF="140"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 997. Higer. 387.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">His person.</NOTE>Sultan Mamood, who it is reported was

seems the picture of misfor∣tune."</Q> The Vizier replied, It is not one of

countenance, but your virtues are diffused over all. But to proceed with our
history.</P>
<P>We have already observed that the father of Sultan Mamood was
Subuctagi. His mother was a princess of the house of Zabulstan, for which
reason she is known by the name of Zabuli. He was born in the year 357 of
the Higerah, and as the astrologers say, with many happy omens
expressed in the heroscope of his fate. Subuctagi being asleep at the
time of his birth, dreamed that he beheld a green tree springing forth from
his chimney, which threw its shadow over the face of the earth, and
screened from the storms of heaven the whole animal creation. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His justice.</NOTE>This indeed was verified by
the justice of Mamood; for if we can believe the poet, in his reign the wolf
and the sheep drank together at the same brook. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A golden mine.</NOTE>In the first month of his
reign a vein of gold, resembling a tree of three cubits in circumference, was

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood's complaint to Munsur, King of Bochara,
is ill received.</NOTE>When Sultan Mamood had settled his dispute with his
brother, he hastened to Balich, from whence he sent an ambassador to
Amir Munsur, Emperor of Bochara, complaining of the indignity which he met
with in the appointment of Buctusin to the regency of Chor∣rassan: it was
returned to him for answer, that he was already in pos∣session of the
territories of Balich, Turmuz, and Herat, which held of the empire; and that
there was a necessity to divide the favours of Bochara among her friends.
Buctusin, it was also insinuated, had been a faithful and good
servant.</P>
<P> <PB N="55" REF="141"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 998. Higer. 389.</NOTE>But Sultan Mamood,

<P>When Abul Hassen delivered his embassy, his capacity and

returned an answer to Mamood. Sultan Mamood having received information of

Sultan Mamood, the con∣spirators hastened to Murve, whither they were

king, and fled to Bochara, and Buctusin was not heard of for some time, but
at length he found his way to Faeck, and begun to collect his scattered

to Peshawir, where Jeipal<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Raja of

his troops lay dead upon the field. Sultan Mamood in this action acquired great
fame and wealth, for round the neck of Jeipal only, were found sixteen
strings of jewels, each of which was valued at one hundred and eighty
thousand rupees.</P>
<P>After this victory, the Sultan marched from Peshawir, and
in∣vesting the fort of Bitinda, reduced it, and releasing his prisoners
upon the payment of a large ransom and a stipulation of an annual tribute,
returned to Ghizni. It was in those ages a custom of the Hindoos, that
whatever Raja was twice worsted by the Mussulmen, should be, by that
disgrace, rendered unfit for further command. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of Jeipal.</NOTE>Jeipal in compliance to
this custom, having raised his son to the go∣vernment, ordered a funeral

his government, prisoner to Ghizni. Finding that the tribute from Hindostan
had not been paid in the year three hundred ninety-five, he directed his march
towards the city of Battea; and leaving the boundaries of Moultan, arrived at
Tahera, which was fortified with an exceeding high wall, and a deep broad
ditch. Tahera was at that time governed by a Raja, called Bachera, who had, in
the pride of power and wealth, greatly molested the Mahommedan governors,
whom the Sultan had esta∣blished in Hindostan. Bachera had also
refused to pay his proportion of the tribute to Annindpal, the son of
Jeipal, of whom he held his authority.</P>
<P>When Sultan Mamood entered the territories of this Raja, he drew out
his troops to receive him, and taking possession of strong posts,
continued to engage the Mahommedans for the space of three days; in which
time, they suffered so much, that they were on the point of abandoning the
attack: But on the fourth day, Sultan Mamood spoke at the head of his troops,
and encouraged them to glory. He concluded with telling them, that this day he
had de∣voted himself to conquest or to death. Bachera, on his part, invoked
the Gods at the temple, and prepared with his former resolution to repel the
enemy. The Mussulmen advanced with great impetu∣osity, but were
repulsed with slaughter; yet returning with fresh courage, and redoubled
rage, the attack was continued till the even∣ing, when Sultan Mamood turning

and took post in a wood on the banks of the Sind. The Sultan being informed
of his retreat, detached part of his army to pursue him. Bachera by this time
was deserted by his fortune and by the most of his friends; he found
himself surrounded by the Mussulmen, and he attempted, in vain, to

king marched in the beginning of the spring, with a great army from Ghizni,
and was met by Annindpal, the son of Jei∣pal, in the hills of Peshawir,
whom he defeated and obliged to fly into Cashmire. Annindpal had entered into
an alliance with Abul Fatte, and as there were two passes only, by which
the Mahomme∣dans could enter Moultan, Annindpal had taken upon himself to
secure that by the way of Peshawir, which Sultan Mamood chanced 
<PB N="60" REF="146"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1005. Higer. 396.</NOTE>to take. The Sultan
returning from the pursuit, entered Moultan, by the way of Betinda, which was
his first intention. When Abul Fatte received intelligence of the fate of
Annindpal, thinking him∣self too weak to keep the field, he shut himself
up in his fortified places, and submissively solicited forgiveness
for his faults, promised to pay a great tribute, and for the future, to obey
implicitly the Sul∣tan's commands. Mamood received him again as a subject,
and prepared to return to Ghizni, when news was brought to him from Arsilla
Hajib, who commanded at Herat, that Elich Chan had in∣vaded his government with
an army. The Sultan hastened to settle the affairs of Hindostan, which he
put into the hands of Shockpal, an Hindoo prince, who had been with Abu Ali
Sumjure in Peshawir, and had turned Mussulman by the name of Zab
Sais.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Misunder∣standing be∣tween Ma∣mood and Elich

We have already mentioned that an uncommon friendship had subsisted
between this Elich Chan, King of Kashgar, and Sultan Mamood. The Sultan
himself was married to the daughter of Elich Chan, but some factious men
about the two courts, by misrepresentations of the princes to one another,
changed their former friendship into enmity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">who invades Chorrassan.</NOTE>When Sultan
Mamood therefore marched to Hindostan, and had left the fields of
Chorrassan almost destitute of troops, Elich Chan took that
opportunity, and resolved to appropriate that province to himself. To
accomplish his design, he ordered his chief general Sipistagi, with a
great force, to enter Chorrassan; and Jaffier Tighi, at the same time,
was appointed to command in the territory of Balich. Arsilla Hajib, the
governor of Herat, being informed of these motions, hastened to Ghizni,
that he might secure the capital. In the mean time, the chiefs of
Chor∣rassan finding themselves deserted, and being in no condition to
oppose the enemy, submitted themselves to Sipistagi.</P>
<P> <PB N="61" REF="147"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1006. Higer. 397.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood marches against him.</NOTE>But Sultan Mamood having by
great marches reached Ghizni, he poured onward like a torrent, with his army
towards Balich. Jaffier Tighi, who had by this time possessed himself
of the place, fled towards Turmuz at his approach. The Sultan then detached
Arsilla Hajib with a great part of his army, to drive Sipistagi out of
Chorrassan; and he also, upon the approach of the troops of Ghizni,
abandoned Herat, and marched towards Mavir ul Nere.</P>
<P>Elich Chan seeing the bad state of his affairs, solicited the
aid of the King of Chutun Kudir Chan, who marched to join him with fifty
thousand horse. Strengthened by this alliance, he crossed, with the
confederate armies, the river Gion,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The
Oxus.</NOTE> which was five pharsangs from Balich, and opposed himself to
the camp of Sultan Mamood. The Sultan immediately drew up his army in order of
battle, giving the command of the center to his brother Amir Nisir,
supported by Abu Nisir Faioon, regent of Gorgan, and by Abdulla Jaï, a
chief, of reputation in arms. The right wing he committed to the care of Alta
Sash, an old experienced officer, while the left was the charge of Arsilla
Hajib, an Omrah of the Afghans. The front of his line he strengthened with
five hundred chain-elephants, with intervals behind them, to facilitate their
re∣treat.</P>
<P>Elich Chan posted himself in the center,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comes

the left. The armies advanced to the charge. The shouts of warriors, the
neighing of horses, and the clashing of arms rent the ears of the
firmament; while dust obscured the face of day. The flame of war was at
once blown up by a storm of rage; and the clay of the field was tempered with
blood. The fountains of life were opened by the edge of the sword, and the
sharp point of the deathful spear.</P>

progress, leaped from his horse, and kissing the ground, invoked the
aid of the Almighty. He instantly mounted an elephant of war, encouraged his
troops, and made a violent assault upon Elich Chan. The elephant seizing
the standard-bearer of the enemy, folded round him his trunk, and tossed
him aloft into the sky. He then pressed forward like a mountain re∣moved
from its place by an earthquake, and trod the enemy like lo∣custs under his

abandoned by fortune and his army, turned his face to flight. He crossed

<P>The Sultan after this victory proposed to pursue the enemy,
which was thought unadviseable by his generals, on account of the incle∣mency
of the season, it being then winter, and the troops hardly capable of
motion: But the king was positive in his resolution, and marched two days
after the runaways. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood's army in distress.</NOTE>On the third
night, a great storm of wind and snow overtook the army of Mamood in the

was obliged to lie in the snow. Mamood having ordered great fires to be
kindled around his tents, they became so warm, that many of the courtiers
began to turn off their upper garments; when a facetious chief, whose name
was Dilk, came in shivering with cold. The King observing him, said, Go
out Dilk, and tell the Winter that he may burst his cheeks with blustering,
for here we value not his resent∣ment. <PB N="63" REF="149"/>

saddle his own horses."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood de∣feats and takes Zab Sais.</NOTE>The
King smiled at this reply, but it presently rendered him thoughtful, and
determined him to proceed no farther. In the morning some hundreds of men and
horses were found to have perished with the cold. Mamood at the same time
received advice from Hindostan, that Zab Sais had thrown off his allegiance,
and returning to his former religion, expelled all the officers who had been
appointed by the King, from their respective departments. The Sultan
immediately determined to punish this revolt, and with great expedition,
advanced towards India. He detached some part of his cavalry in front, who
coming unexpectedly upon Zab Sais, defeated him, and brought him prisoner to
the King. The rebel was fined in four lacks of rupees, of which the Sultan made
a pre∣sent to his treasurer, and kept Zab Sais a prisoner for life.</P>

Hindoos. Annindpal hearing of the Sultan's intentions, sent ambassadors
every where to request the assistance of the other Rajas of
Hindostan; who considered the ex∣tirpation of the Mussulmen from
Hindostan, as a meritorious and political action.</P>

plains of Hindostan. The two armies came in sight of one another in a great
plain near Pishawir. They remained there encamped forty days without action:
but the troops of the idolaters daily increased in number. They were joined
by the Gickers and other tribes with numerous armies, and surround∣ed the
Mussulmen, who fearing a general assault were obliged to entrench
themselves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are overthrown.</NOTE>The King having thus
secured himself, ordered a thousand archers to his front, to endeavour to
provoke the enemy to advance to the entrenchments. The archers accordingly were
attacked by the Gickers, who notwithstanding all the Sultan could do,
pursued the runaways within the trenches, where a dreadful scene of
slaughter ensued on both sides, in which five thousand Mussulmen in
a few minutes drank the wine of martyrdom. The enemy at length being slain as
fast as they advanced, the attack became fainter and fainter, when on a
sud∣den the elephant upon which Annindpal rode took fright at the report of a
gun<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to our accounts there were no guns at
this time, but many Eastern authors mention them, ascribing the invention

struck the Hindoos with a panic, for thinking they were deserted by their
sovereign they immediately followed the example. Abdulla Tai, with six
thousand Arabian horse, and Arsilla Hajib, with ten thou∣sand Turks,
Afghans, and Chillages, pursued the enemy for two days and nights; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great slaughter of the Hindoos.</NOTE>so
that twenty thousand Hindoos were killed in their flight, together with the

<P>Thirty elephants with much rich plunder were brought to the King,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1008. Higer. 399.</NOTE>Nagracut, breaking
down their idols and subverting their temples. There was at that time in the
territory of Nagracut a famous fort called Bimé, which the Sultan
invested, after having destroyed the country round with fire and sword.
Bimé was built by Raja Bimé on the top of a steep mountain, and
here the Hindoos, on account of its strength, had reposited the wealth
consecrated to their idols in all the neigh∣bouring kingdoms; so that in
this fort there was a greater quantity of gold, silver, precious stones and
pearls, than had been ever col∣lected into the royal treasury of any prince
on earth. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood in∣vests Bimé.</NOTE>The Sultan
invested the place with such expedition that the Hindoos had not time to
throw troops into it for its defence, the greatest part of the garri∣son
being before carried into the field. Those within consisted for the
most part of priests, a race of men who having little inclination to the
bloody business of war, in a few days solicited to be permitted to
capitulate. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bimé taken.</NOTE>Their request being
granted by Mamood, they opened the gates, and fell upon their faces before him;
and with a few of his officers and attendants, he immediately entered the
place.</P>
<P>In Bimé were found seven hundred thousand golden dinars,
seven hundred maunds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The least maund in India is

maunds of pure gold in ingots, two thousand maunds of silver bullion, and
twenty maunds of various jewels set, which had been collecting from the time
of Bimé. With this immense treasure the King returned to Ghizni, and
in the year 400 prepared a magnificent festival, where he dis∣played to the
people his wealth in golden thrones, and in other rich ornaments, in a great
plain without the city of Ghizni, and after the feast every individual
received a princely present.</P>
<P>In the following year the Sultan led his army towards Ghor. The
governor of that country, Mahummud ben Suri, with ten thousand troops,
opposed him. From morning to noon the fire of war flamed, 
<PB N="66" REF="152"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1009. Higer. 400.</NOTE>and justice was
done to valour on both sides. The Sultan finding that the troops of Ghor
defended themselves in their intrenchments with such obstinacy, commanded
his army to make a feint of retreating, to allure the enemy out of their
fortified camp, which accordingly suc∣ceeded. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood re∣duces Ghor.</NOTE>The Ghorans being

Mahummud Suri was taken prisoner and brought to the King, but in his
despair he had taken poison, which he always kept under his ring, and died
in a few hours. His country was annexed to the dominions of Ghizni.</P>
<P>Some historians affirm, that neither the sovereigns of Ghor, nor
its inhabitants were Mussulmen, till after this victory, whilst others of
good credit assure us, that they were converted many years before, even
so early as the time of Ali.</P>
<P>Mamood in the same year was under the necessity of marching
again into Moultan, which had revolted, but having soon reduced it, and cut
off a great number of the chiefs, he brought Daood ben Nazir prisoner to

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His sixth ex∣pedition to India.</NOTE>In the

It had reached the ears of the King, that Tannasar was held in the same
veneration by idolaters, as Mecca was by the Mussulmen; that there they had
set up a whole tribe of rich idols, the principal of whom they called Jug
Soom; that this Jug Soom they pretended to say existed when as yet the

that according to the treaty that subsisted between him and Annindpal, he

destruction of the temple of Nagracut. But if he should be pleased to
alter his resolution against Tannasar, Annindpal would undertake that the
amount of the revenues of that country should be annually paid to Mamood, to
reimburse the expence of his expedition: that besides he, on his own part,
would present him with fifty elephants and jewels to a considerable

to his government. When Pitterugepal, for that was the new Raja's name, saw
that he could not stand against the Sultan in the field, he drew off his
army towards Cashmire, leaving a good garrison for the defence of the

attack, assiduously employed himself; so that in a few weeks the
governor seeing his walls in ruins was under the necessity of begging to

entirely defeated the Sultan's utmost efforts; for not being able to reduce
it, all the summer season, he was obliged, on the approach of winter, to

province of Orgunge. Returning to Balich, Mamood gave the government of Herat,
to his son Amir Musaood, appointing Abu Sul his vizier, and the govern∣ment
of Gurgan he conferred upon his younger son Amir Mahum∣mud, under the care of
Abu Bicker. After the final settlement of the affairs of Charizm, the
Ghiznian army were cantoned, for the winter, at Balich.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood's eighth expe∣dition into In∣dia.</NOTE>In
the beginning of the year 409, as soon as the sun began to awake the
children of the spring, Sultan Mamood, with a hundred thousand chosen
horse, and thirty thousand foot, raised in the countries of Turkistan,
Maverulnere, Chorrassan, and the adjacent provinces, undertook an
expedition against Kinnoge, which, from the time of Gustasp to this
period, had not been visited by any foreign enemy. Kinnoge was distant from
Ghizni three months march, and seven great rivers rushed across the way.
When Ma∣mood reached the confines of Cashmire, the Raja sent him presents
of every thing curious and valuable in his country, and waited to have the
honour of expressing his loyalty. When the Sultan, with much difficulty,
had conducted his army through the mountains, he entered the plains of
Hindostan, drove all opposition before him, and advanced to Kinnoge<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mamood's route lay through the mountains behind
Cashmire; and he must have entered Hindostan by the way of
Tibet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great city of Kinnoge submits.</NOTE>He
there saw a city which raised its head to the firmament, and which, in
strength and structure, might justly boast to have no equal. The Raja
of this rich city, whose name was Korrah, and who affected great pomp and
splendor, being thus unexpectedly in∣vaded, had not had time to put himself
in a posture of defence, or to collect his troops together. Terrified by the
great force, and war∣like appearance of the Sultan, he, in his
embarrassment, resolved to <PB N="72" REF="158"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1018. Higer. 409.</NOTE>sue for peace, and
accordingly went out, with his family, to the camp, where he submitted
himself to the mercy of the King. Some authors relate, that he even turned
Mussulman, or true believer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood ad∣vances to∣wards Merat; which he
takes.</NOTE>The Sultan tarried in Kinnoge only three nights, and then turned
his face towards Merat, the Raja of which place, by name Hirdit, re∣treated
with his army, leaving only a garrison, which was obliged to capitulate in a
few days. The terms were two hundred and fifty thousand rupees, and fifty
elephants, to be paid by the Raja, besides the plunder of the city. The
Sultan marched from thence to invest the fort of Mavin, upon the banks of the
river Gihon, now called the Jumna. The Raja of Mavin coming forth to make his
submission, at the head of his troops, a quarrel accidentally ensued
between some soldiers, and immediately the action became general.
Calchunder the Raja, and most of his troops, being driven into the river, he
drew his sword against his own wife and children, and having dispatched
them, turned it in despair upon himself. The fort immediately
surrendered, where the conqueror found much trea∣sure and rich spoil,
among which were seventy elephants of war.</P>
<P>When Mamood had here refreshed his troops, he was given to
understand, that, at some distance, there was a rich city, called
Muttra,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Muttra stands upon the Jumna 36 miles above
Agra, and is still a very consider∣able city.</NOTE> consecrated to
Kissen Basdeo, which in buildings and extent yielded to none in
Hindostan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches against and takes Muttra.</NOTE>The
Sultan directed his march towards the place, and entering it, with very little
opposition from the troops of the Raja of Delhi, to whom it belonged, gave it
up to plunder. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great spoil found in Mut∣tra.</NOTE>He broke
down or burnt all the idols, and amassed an immense quantity of gold and
silver, of which those figures were mostly made. He intended to destroy
the temples, but he found that the labour exceeded his capacity; while some
say that he was <PB N="73" REF="159"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1018. Higer. 409.</NOTE>turned from his
purpose, by the admirable beauty and structure of those edifices. He, it
is certain, extravagantly extolled the noble beauty of the buildings and city,
in a letter to the Omrahs of Ghiz∣ni, after this conquest.</P>
<P>It is said that the Sultan found in Muttra five great idols of
pure gold, with eyes of rubies, each of which eyes were worth fifty thou∣sand
dinars. Upon another idol, he found a sapphire, weighing four hundred
miskal; and the image being melted down, produced ninety-eight thousand
three hundred miskal of pure gold. Besides these, there were above a
hundred idols of silver, which loaded a hundred camels with bullion. The
Sultan, having tarried here twenty days, in which time the city suffered
greatly from fire, besides what it suffered from the hand of ravage and
desolation, he marched against the other fortified places in these
districts, some of which he took himself, while others fell into the
hands of his chiefs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mungetaken.</NOTE>One of those forts called
Munge, held out twenty-five days, being full of Rajaputs; but when they found
the place no longer tenable, some rushed through the breaches among the
enemy and met that death which they no longer endeavoured to avoid. Some threw
themselves headlong from the walls, and were dashed to pieces, while others
burnt themselves in their houses, with their wives and children; so that
not one of the garrison survived this fatal cata∣strophe.</P>
<P>The Sultan having secured what was valuable, invested the fort
of Chundpal. But Chundpal, for that also was the Raja's name, had sent off
all his treasure to the mountains, and at the approach of the King, evacuated
the place. There however still remained much spoil and provisions which
the Sultan divided among his troops.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1018. Higer. 409.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood marches against Jun∣droy.</NOTE>Mamood immediately
march'd against a proud and imperious Raja, whose name was Jundroy. This
Raja, after some skirmishes, finding himself unable to cope with the
King, sent off his treasure, and other valuable effects, and fled also to
the mountains. Jundroy had an elephant of a most uncommon size, such as
had never before been seen in Hindostan; nor was he more remarkable for his
enor∣mous bulk, than for his docility and courage. The Sultan having heard much
of this elephant, sent to the Raja, offering him advan∣tageous terms of
peace, and a great sum of money for this animal. But the obstinacy of
Jundroy would never listen to any terms with the Mussulmen, so that
Mamood, with regret, was obliged to desist. The elephant however happened
one night to break loose from his keepers, and went into the Sultan's camp,
where he permitted him∣self to be mounted and brought before the King, who
received him with great joy, and named him, The gift of God.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to Ghizni.</NOTE>The Sultan, loaded with
spoil, and encumbered with captives, returned to Ghizni; where he enumerated
the articles of his plunder. It consisted of twenty million of dirms,
fifty-three thousand captives, three hundred and fifty elephants, besides
jewels, pearls, and pre∣cious effects, which could not be properly estimated.
Nor was the private spoil of the army less than that which came into the
public treasury.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Builds the Ce∣lestial Bride.</NOTE>The Sultan
upon his return to Ghizni, ordered a magnificent mosque to be built of marble
and granate, of such beauty and struc∣ture, as struck every beholder with
astonishment and pleasure. This mosque he afterwards adorned with
such beautiful carpets, chande∣liers, and other ornaments of silver and
gold, that it became known by the name of the Celestial bride. In the
neighbourhood of this mosque he founded an university, which he furnished
with a vast col∣lection of curious books, in various languages, and with
natural and <PB N="75" REF="161"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1018. Higer. 409.</NOTE>artificial

their King began to run upon architecture, they also endeavoured to outvie
each other, in the magnificence of their private palaces, as well as in public
buildings, which they raised for the embellishment of the city. Thus in a
short space of time the capital was ornamented, with mosques, porches,
fountains, reservoirs, aqueducts and cisterns, in a degree superior to
any city at that time in the east. Some authors affirm, that among the
curiosities which the Sultan possessed, there was a bird, of the
size of a cuckoo, which was possessed of this par∣ticular instinct
or quality, that whenever poison was brought, how∣ever secretly, into the
apartment in which he hung, he was affected with the smell in such a
manner, as to fly distractedly about his cage, while the tears streamed
involuntarily from his eyes. This bird, with other curiosities, was sent as
a present to the Caliph of Bagdat, Al Kadir Billa Abassi. We, however,
believe, that this story rose from the policy of Mamood, and the credulity
of mankind, rather than that it had actually any foundation in truth. Other
authors mention a stone which he brought from Hindostan, as a great
curiosity. This stone being dipped in water, and applied to a wound, proved
a powerful and efficacious remedy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood write to the Caliph.</NOTE>The Sultan, in

Mamood was presented with a petition from his subjects, setting forth,
that some tribes of the wild Arabs had, for many years, shut up the roads

Caliph, who neglected to ex∣pel them, they had not been able to pay their
devotions at the shrine of the prophet.

the chief of the Arabs. The banditti immedi∣ately upon the fall of their chief,

destroy the image, but that such a sum of money, given in charity among
believers, would be a very meritorious action. The Sultan acknowleged, that
what they said was, in some measure, true; but should he consent to
that bargain, he might justly be called a seller of idols; and that he
looked upon a breaker of them as a more ho∣nourable title. He therefore ordered
them to proceed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Finds an im∣mense trea∣sure.</NOTE>The next
blow having broke up the belly of Sumnat, which had been made hollow, they
discovered that it was full of diamonds, ru∣bies, and pearls, of a much
greater value than the amount of what the Brahmins had offered.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of Sumnat.</NOTE>It is said, by some
writers, that the name of this idol is a compound word of <HI>Sum</HI> and
<HI>Nat; Sum</HI> being the name of the Raja who erected it, and <HI>Nat</HI>
the true name of the God; which in the language of the Brahmins, signifies
Creator. In the time of eclipses we are told that there used to be forty or
fifty thousand worshippers at this temple; and that the different Rajas of
Hindostan had bestowed, in all, two thousand villages, with their
territories, for the maintenance of its priests; besides the 
<PB N="86" REF="172"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1022. Higer. 413.</NOTE>innumerable
presents received from all parts of the empire. It was a custom among
those idolaters, to wash Sumnat every morning and evening, with fresh
water from the Ganges, though that river is above five hundred crores
distant.</P>
<P>Among the spoils of this temple, was a chain of gold weighing
forty maunds, which hung from the top of the building by a ring. It supported
a great bell which warned the people to the worship of the God. Besides two
thousand Brahmins, who officiated as priests, there belonged to the temple
five hundred dancing girls, three hun∣dred musicians, and three hundred
barbers to shave the devotees be∣fore they were admitted to the presence of
Sumnat. The dancing girls were either remarkable for their beauty, or their
quality, the Rajas thinking it an honour to have their daughters admitted.</P>
<P>Sultan Mamood found in this temple, a greater quantity of jewels and
gold, than, it is thought, any royal treasury ever contained be∣fore. In the
history of Eben Assur, it is related, that there was no light in the
temple, but one pendant lamp, which being reflected from the jewels, spread a
strong and refulgent light over the whole place. Besides the great idol
above-mentioned, there were in the temple some thousands of small images,
in gold and silver, of various shapes and dimensions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The emperor marches against Byram
Deo.</NOTE>The emperor having secured the wealth of Sumnat, prepared to
chastise Raja Byram Deo, from whom the harbour of Deo takes its name, for
having endeavoured to distress him during the siege, and having given
above three thousand of the Mussulmen to drink of the wine of martyrdom.
Byram Deo, after the taking of Sumnat, had fled from Narwalla the capital of
Guzerat, and shut himself up in the fort of Gundia, which was forty
pharsangs from Sumnat. The king, without opposition, arrived before the
sort, and saw that it was sur∣rounded <PB N="87" REF="173"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1022. Higer. 413.</NOTE>on all sides by
the sea, which, in every place, appeared im∣passable. He sent however
to sound the depth of the water, and re∣ceived intelligence, that at one
place it was fordable at low water; but if he should be caught by the tide,
in his passage, the troops must inevitably perish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attacks him in his fort of Gundia,</NOTE>The
Sultan having ordered public prayers, and cast his fortune in the Koran,
turned his horse into the sea, at the head of his troops, and reaching in
safety the opposite shore, immediately made an assault upon the
place. Byram Deo, looking upon life preferable to every other consideration,
left his family and wealth, and, in the ha∣bit of a slave, stealing out of
the fort, run and concealed himself in a corner. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">which he takes.</NOTE>The troops who defended the
place, seeing themselves thus shamefully deserted, were also struck
with fear, and quitted their posts upon the walls. The Mussulmen mounted
their scaling ladders, and commenced a dreadful havock among the unfortunate
slaves, reserving the women and children for captivity. The wealth of the
Raja was lodged in the treasury of the King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches to Narwalla,</NOTE>Mamood being thus
victorious, marched to Narwalla. He found the soil of that place so
fertile, the air so salubrious and pure, and the country so well
cultivated and pleasant, that he proposed to take up his residence there
for some years, and to make it his capital, con∣ferring the government of
Ghizni upon his son the Sultan Musaood. Some historians relate, that, in
that age, there were goldmines in Gu∣zerat; which occasioned Sultan Mamood to
incline to fix his residence in that country. But to this we cannot well give
any credit, as there are now no traces of those mines; but it is
acknowledged, that the country was, at all times, one of the richest in
Hindostan. In support of their assertion, they however give many
instances of the disappearance of gold mines, such as that in Seistan,
which was swallowed up by an <PB N="88" REF="174"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1022. Higer. 413.</NOTE>earthquake. There
are other writers who pretend to say, that the King, having heard of gold and
ruby mines, upon the island of Si∣rendiep, and in the country of Pegu,
intended to fit out a fleet for the conquest of those parts, but that he
was diverted by his council from this scheme, and also prevailed upon not
to abandon his native kingdom and capital.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">but is divert∣ed from it by the
Omrahs.</NOTE>Mamood yielding to this latter advice, consented to return, and
at the same time begged of his Omrahs, to recommend a fit person to him,
for the government of the kingdom of Guzerat. After con∣sulting among
themselves, they told the King, that on account of the great distance of
this country from his other dominions, and the number of troops it would
require for its defence, they thought it adviseable, that some one of the
natives should receive that honour. The King then enquired among the chiefs
of the natives, and was informed that the family of Dabissalima was the
noblest in those parts, and that then a man of parts and distinction of
that tribe, was in his camp, in the habit of a Brahmin. That they knew no
person fitter to be exalted to royalty than him: though he had been obliged
to chuse that way of life, to conceal himself from the cruelty of a younger
brother, who had usurped his inheritance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Makes Da∣bissalima King of Guzerat.</NOTE>But
some authors, suspecting the probability of this story, have informed
us, that Dabissalima was Raja of a neighbouring country, famous as well for
his policy and wisdom, as for his great knowlege in the sciences. To him
the King sent a friendly message, inviting him to his presence, to
receive his allegiance for the government of Guzerat, which he intended to
bestow upon him. But as we have many authentic proofs of the truth of our
first relation, it must be acknowleged that the King, upon having settled
an annual tribute, bestowed the kingdom of Guzerat upon Dabissalima the
poor Brah∣min, and not upon the Raja of the same name, who lived at that
period.</P>
<P> <PB N="89" REF="175"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1026. Higer. 417.</NOTE>We find, that when
the King had bestowed the regency upon the Brahmin, that he petitioned him to
leave some forces for his pro∣tection, for that Raja Dabissalima, as
soon as Mamood should evacuate the country, would undoubtedly invade him
before his power was thoroughly established, the consequences of which
might be easily foreseen. But that if the King would grant him his
protection, he would annually give double the revenues of Cabulistan and
Zabulistan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches against and defeats a neighbouring
Raja.</NOTE>These considerations prevailed with the Sultan to form a
design to reduce this Raja before he left the country. He accordingly sent
a part of his army into the dominions of the Raja, which, in a short time,
defeated him, and brought him prisoner to Mamood. He im∣mediately delivered
over the unfortunate Raja into the hands of his kinsman Dabissalima the
viceroy to take away his life.</P>
<P>Dabissalima addressed himself to the King after this
manner; that in his religion, the murder of a King was unlawful; but that it
was customary, when one King got possession of the person of
another who was his enemy, to make a dark pit under his throne, where he
should remain imprisoned for life, or till the death of his conqueror. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dabissalima's clemency.</NOTE>That for his own
part, he esteemed such usage a cruelty of which he could not be guilty;
but that on the other hand, if the Raja should be confined by him in another
prison, his adherents would, upon the King's departure, attempt to release
him. He therefore earnestly begged that the King might carry him to
Ghizni.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood re∣turns to Ghiz∣ni.</NOTE>The Sultan
complied with this last request, and after two years and six months
absence, turned homewards his victorious standards. But having received
intelligence, that Byram Deo, and the Raja of Ajmere, with others, had
collected a great army to oppose him in the desart, he turned by the way of
Sind and Moultan. He there also met with desarts in his march, wherein his
army greatly suffered <PB N="90" REF="176"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1026. Higer. 417.</NOTE>by want of water,
and his cavalry by want of grass; but in the year 417 he with much difficulty
and toil, reached Ghizni. During his march through Sind, he was led astray
three days and nights, by one of his Hindoo guides, in a desart of dry
sand, so that madness and thirst began intolerably to rage through his
perishing troops.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perfidy of one of the Priests of
Sumnat.</NOTE>The Sultan suspecting his guide, commanded him to be put to
the torture, when he confessed that he was one of the priests of Sum∣nat,
who to revenge the injuries done to his God, had thus endea∣voured to bring
about the ruin of the Ghiznian army. The King then commanded him to be put to
death; and it being towards evening, he fell prostrate before God, imploring
a speedy deliverance. A meteor was immediately seen in the east, to which
he directed his march, and before morning, found himself upon the banks of a
lake.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dabissalima deman as the imprisoned
Raja.</NOTE>Dabissalima the devout, having established himself upon
the throne of Guzerat, continued to send his revenues punctually to the King,
and some years after desired the imprisoned Raja might be returned to
him. But the Raja had, by this time, gained upon the mind of the King, which
made him unwilling to part with him. He however was over-persuaded, by his
counsellors, who were envious of the favour which the unfortunate Raja had
acquired; and he was accordingly put into the hands of the person who brought
the revenue to Ghizni.</P>

reached the dominions of Guzerat, Dabissalima the devout gave orders to dig
a hole under his own throne, in which he intended to confine the unhappy Raja,
according to the barbarous custom of the Hindoos. To stretch his triumph
still further, he ad∣vanced to some distance from his capitol, to meet
the Raja, that the unfortunate man might run before his horse, with a bason
on his head, and an ewer in his hand.</P>
<P> <PB N="91" REF="177"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1026. Higer. 417.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">and punish∣ment.</NOTE>The King, it is said, having
over-heated himself upon this occa∣sion, lay down, much disordered, in a
shade, drew a red handker∣chief over his face, and ordered his attendants to
withdraw. A Vul∣ture, which was hovering over that place, mistaking the red
hand∣kerchief for prey, soused down upon the King, and fixing her talons
about his eyes, rendered him totally blind; and therefore incapable to reign
according to the laws of the country.</P>
<P>When the accident which befel the King became public, the whole camp
and city were filled with confusion and uproar. The imprison∣ed Raja,
arriving at that very instant, was received with universal ac∣clamations,
and immediately elected King. He put the bason upon the head of
Dabissalima, and placed the ewer in his hand, and drove him before him into
the dungeon, which he himself had prepared, where he spent the remainder of
his life.</P>
<P>This barbarous action, however, shewed that his successor
was unworthy of what providence had, so miraculously, bestowed upon him.
This story is a striking instance of the just punishment of pride,
and that he who digs a pit for another, will fall into it himself.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Story of an iron idol.</NOTE>The author of the
Jam ul Hikaiat has related, that, when Sultan Mamood was in Guzerat, he saw a
small black idol, under a circular arch, which, to all appearance, was
suspended in the air, without support. The King, amazed at this
phaenomenon, consulted the philosophers of his court concerning it. They
told him, that they believed the image to be iron, and the stones of the arch
magnets. The King observed, that be thought the equilibrium of weight and
attraction could not be so exactly found. He however, by way of experiment,
ordered a stone to be struck out of the arch; which was no sooner done,
than the idol sell to the ground, and the stone was accordingly found to be
a magnet; but philosophers of latter days <PB N="92" REF="178"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1026. Higer. 417.</NOTE>are of the King's
opinion, and that this story may be rank'd among the fabulous.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Caliph writes to Ma∣mood.</NOTE>The Caliph of
Bagdat being informed of the expedition of Sultan Mamood, wrote him a
congratulatory letter, in which he stiled him, The guardian of fortune and
Islamism. To his son Sultan Musaood, he gave the title of, The light of
posterity, and the beauty of nations; and to his second son Mur Eusoph,
the appellation of, The strength of the arm of fortune, and establisher
of the state. He, at the same time, assured Mamood, that, whoever he
should appoint to the suc∣cession, he himself would confirm and
support.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood at∣tacks the Jits,</NOTE>Mamood marched
this year an army against the Jits, who had in∣sulted him in his way from
Sumnat. This people inhabited the country, on the borders of Moultan, near the
banks of the river that runs by the mountains of Jude. When he arrived at
Moultan, find∣ing that the country of the Jits was defended by great rivers, he
or∣dered fifteen hundred boats to be built, each of which he armed with six
iron spikes projecting from their prows and sides, to prevent their being
boarded by the enemy, who were very expert in that kind of war. When he had
launched this fleet, he ordered twenty archers into each boat, and five others,
with fire-balls, to burn the craft of the Jits, and naphta to set the whole
river on fire. This force he com∣manded to extirpate the Jits, and remained
with the remainder of his army at Moultan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who are overthrown.</NOTE>The Jits having
intelligence of this armament, sent their wives and children, and most
valuable effects, into an island, and launch∣ing, according to some, four
thousand, or, according to others, eight thousand boats, manned and armed,
prepared to receive the Ghiz∣nians. They met, and a terrible conflict ensued;
but the projected pikes from the Sultan's boats, did such execution, when
they ran against <PB N="93" REF="179"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1027. Higer. 418.</NOTE>the craft of the
Jits, that many of them were overset. The archers, at the same time, plied
their bows to such good purpose, that many of the enemy plunged over board
to avoid their galling arrows. Some of the Jitsiad boats being, in the mean
time, set on fire, communicated their flames to others; some were sunk,
some board∣ed by the Turks, and others endeavoured to make their escape. In
this scene of confusion and terror, very few of the Jits could shun their
hard fate. All those therefore, who escaped death, met with the more
severe misfortune of captivity.</P>
<P>The Sultan, after this victory, returned in triumph to Ghizni, and
in the 418th year of the Higerah, ordered Amir Toos, one of his generals, to
the government of Badwird, that he might chastise the Turkuman of Siljoki,
who had crossed the river Amavia, and in∣vaded that province.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">His person.</NOTE>He was a man of a middle
stature, not very handsome in his person, but without any deformity or

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Instances of his avarice.</NOTE>Two days before
his death, he commanded, that all the sacks of gold and caskets of precious
stones, which were in the treasury, should be placed before him; when he
beheld them as with re∣gret, he wept, ordering them to be carried back to the
treasury, without exhibiting his generosity at that time to any body, for
which he has been accused of avarice. He ordered, the following day, a review
of his Army, his Elephants, Camels, Horses and Chariots, with which, having
feasted his eyes for some time, from his traveling throne, he again burst
into tears, and retired in grief to his palace.</P>
<P>It's said, that Sultan Mamood, upon hearing that a citizen of
Ne∣shapoor was possessed of immense wealth, commanded him to be
called into his presence. The King began to reproach him for being an
idolater and an apostate from the faith. The citizen replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"O King, I am no idolater nor apostate, but it is
true that I am possessed of much wealth; take it therefore, but do me
not a double injustice, by robbing me of my money and my good name."</Q> The
King, for this insolence, as he termed it; ordered him to be punished and
confiscated his whole estate.</P>
<P> <PB N="95" REF="181"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1028. Higer. 419.</NOTE>But Mamood was, in
other instances, famous for justice. A per∣son one day, thrusting
himself into the presence, called loudly for justice. The King ordered
him to explain his complaint, which he thus did: That, unfortunately having a
handsome wife, the King's nephew had conceived a passion for her, and
came to his house every night with armed attendants, beating him and turn∣ing
him into the street till he had gratified his adulterous passion. That he
had frequently complained to those who ought to have done him justice, but
that the rank of the adulterer had shut their ears against him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of his justice.</NOTE>The King, upon hearing
this, was so much enraged that tears of resentment and compassion
started from his eyes; he repri∣manded the poor man for not making sooner
his complaint to him. The man replied, that he often attempted it, but could
not gain ad∣mittance. He was then commanded by the King, to return to his
house, and to give him notice the first time that his nephew was guilty of
the like violence; charging those who were present, upon pain of death, to
let nothing of this complaint transpire, ordering him to be admitted at any
hour. Accordingly the man returned to his house, and upon the third night
following, the King's nephew, as usual, came, and having whipped the
husband severely, turned him into the street. The poor man hastened to
the King; but the captain of the guards would not give him admittance,
saying, that his Majesty was in the Haram. The man immediately began to
make a violent outery, so that the porter fearing that the court might be
disturbed, and that the noise might reach the King, he was under the
necessity to conduct him to the Eunuchs of the bedchamber, who immedi∣ately
acquainted the Sultan with the affair.</P>
<P>The King immediately rose, and drawing on a garment followed the
man to his house. He found his nephew and the man's wife <PB N="96" REF="182"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1028. Higer. 419.</NOTE>sleeping together
in one bed, with a candle standing on the carpet near them. The Sultan,
extinguishing the candle, drew his dagger and severed his nephew's head
from his body: Then commanding the man to light the candle, he called out for
some water, and having taken a deep draught, he told him he might now go and
sleep with safety, if he could trust his own wife.</P>
<P>The poor man fell down at the Sultan's feet, in gratitude to his
justice and condescension, but begged he might tell him why he put out
the candle, and afterwards called out so vehemently for water. The King
replied, that he put out the candle that pity might not arrest his hand in
the execution of justice, on a youth whom he tenderly loved; and that he had
made a vow to God, when he first heard his complaint, that he would neither
eat nor drink till he had brought the criminal to justice, in so much, that
he was upon the point of dying of thirst.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The learned men who flou∣rished under
Mamood.</NOTE>The learned men who lived at the court of Sultan Mamood were
principally these; Ozaeri Rasi, a native of Rai, whose poetical
per∣formances as a panegyrist, are esteemed very good, for one of which he
received a present of 4000 Dirms from the Sultan.—Assidi Toosi, a
native of Chorrassan, a poet of great same, whom the Sul∣tan often
entreated to undertake the Shaw Namma, but he excused himself on account of
his age. He was the master of Phirdoci, who afterwards undertook that work;
but Phirdoci falling sick by too much application, before it was finished,
he applied himself to his old master Assidi; telling him that he was
now at the point of death, and that his only regret for leaving this vain world
was, that his poem was unfinished. The old man weeping replied, that, tho' he
had often excused himself to the King, from having any hand in that
performance, yet for the affection he bore to Phirdoci, he would undertake to
finish his poem. The dying poet replied, that he was <PB N="97" REF="183"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1028. Higer. 419.</NOTE>well assured no
other man of the age had the genius to attempt it; but at the same time he
was afraid, years and infirmities had damped the native fire of Assidi.</P>
<P>The old man warmed with friendship and emulation, collecting the
force of his mind, made the attempt, and brought into the chains of rhime in a
few days, that part of the poem, between the Arabian conquest of Agim to the
end, which consists of four thousand couplets. He immediately brought it
to Phirdoci, who was so rejoiced that he recovered from his disorder. The
Shaw Namma is esteemed among the first of poetical productions, and
Phirdoci the author, conse∣quently among the first of poets.</P>
<P>Minuchere was an Omrah of Balich, and famous for his poetry and wit.
But Hakim Ali Unsuri is esteemed to hold the first rank, as to genius, in
that age; for besides being one of the best poets, he was a great
philosopher, versed in all the known sciences, and all the learned
languages of those times. Four hundred poets and learned men, besides all
the students of the university of Ghizni, acknow∣ledged him for their
master. He was therefore appointed by the King, to superintend literature,
and it was ordered, that no per∣formance should be brought before the Sultan,
without being pre∣viously honoured with the approbation of Ali Unsuri.</P>
<P>Among the works of Unsuri there is an heroic poem, upon the
actions of Sultan Mamood. The King having one night, in his cups, cut off the
long tresses of his beloved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His favourite
mistress.</NOTE>, he was much afflicted in the morning for what he had
done. He sat, he rose, he walked by turns, and there was a terror round
him, which kept the people at distance. <PB N="98" REF="184"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1028. Higer. 419.</NOTE>Ali Unsuri
accosted him with some extempore lines<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The
beauty of the lines consisted chiefly in a happy chime of words, which
cannot possibly be imitated in a translation. The sense runs thus: On
this happy day, when the tresses of your beloved are cut off, what place is
there for grief? Let it be rather crowned with mirth and wine, for the beauty
of the cypress is increased by the pruning of it's branches.</NOTE>, which
so pleased the King that he ordered his mouth to be filled three times with
jewels. Calling then for wine, he sat down with the poet and washed down
his grief, seasoning society with wit.</P>
<P>Asjuddi was one of the scholars of Unsuri: He was a native of
Hirvi, a poet blessed with the light of true genius, but his works are very
scarce and the greatest part of them lost. Firochi was also a pupil of
Unsuri. He was of the antient royal race of the Kings of Seistan, but
reduced by fortune so low, that he was obliged to hire himself to a farmer
for the yearly wages of a hundred Dirms. When he married, he found this small
sum would not answer his expences, so he became desirous of having his
wages increased. The farmer told him he certainly deserved a great deal
more, but that his capacity could not extend the allowance further. Firochi, in
this state of dependence, waited on the Sultan's nephew Abul Muziffir with a
poem, for which he was honoured with a hand∣some reward, with a horse and a
dress. He was introduced to the King by Muziffir, who settled a pension
upon him which enabled him to ride with a retinue of twenty well mounted
slaves.</P>

his father's decease at Hammedan, set∣tled Viceroys and governors of
trust in Ayrack and Agim, and hastened towards Chorrassan. From thence
he wrote to his brother, that he had no inclination to take those countries
from him, which his father, notwithstanding of his preferable right, had been
pleased to bequeath to Mahummud. He moreover added, that the regions of the
Hills, Tiberistan and Ayrack, which he had mostly acquired by his own
sword, were ample enough dominions for him. He only insisted so far on
his birth-right, as to have his name first read in the Chutba<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The geneal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gy and

to have been very moderate in this case, for though he and Mahummud were
twins, he was the elder by some hours, and consequently had the undoubted
right of succession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">War between the brothers.</NOTE>But enmity had
subsisted between the brothers from their youth, and Sultan Mahummud
returned his brother upon this occasion, a very unfriendly answer, and
began to prepare for war, in spite of all that his council could do to
oppose so rash a measure. The Sultan accordingly put his army in
motion, and leaving Ghizni, proceeded to meet Musaood: It is said, that at
the feast, upon the conclusion of the Ramzan which Mahummud held at
Tunganabad, his crown fell accidentally from his head when he sat in state.
This was reckoned a very unfortunate omen, of which some disaffected Omrahs
taking advantage, estranged the minds of the soldiery from their prince. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahummud deposed.</NOTE>Accordingly upon the
third night after, there was a confederacy formed by Amir Ali, Eusoph ben
Subuctagi, and Amir Hassnic Mical, who sounding the trumpets to arms, put
themselves at the head of the troops, surrounded the King's tents, and
seizing upon his person, sent him prisoner to the fort of Chillige.

honour∣ed with the appellation of Rustum the second. His arrow could pierce

mace was so ponderous, that no man of his time could raise it with one

of all authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His fierce d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sposition.</NOTE> and disdaining all obe∣dience.
This circumstance, in his youth, engaged him in many quar∣rels, and greatly

relates, that, when the name of Amir Mahummud was inserted before that of

himself followed Amir Musaood to the door of the mosque, and told him,
that what he had heard, gave him the utmost concern, for that his own, as
well as the hearts of most of the Omrahs, burnt with affection for him. Amir
Musaood replied with a smile, Give yourselves no concern about it; the
world is for the longest sword.</P>
<P>One of the King's spies, hearing this conversation, immediately
gave information of it to the Sultan. Mamood immediately calling Abu Niser,
asked him what had passed between him and Amir Mu∣saood. Abu Niser
thinking that truth would be his best defence, re∣lated the particulars. Upon
which the King said, that he had al∣ways a high opinion of the superior
abilities of Musaood, who, he foresaw, would one day be King; but that Amir
Mahummud had gained his heart, by filial duty, and implicit obedience.</P>

Amir Ahummud ben Mealtagi, the treasurer, to a strict ac∣count, and after
having obliged him to refund a great sum, for mal∣practices in his office,
appointed him general of all his forces in Hin∣dostan, and ordered him to
proceed to Lahore. He, at the same time, released Mujeid ul Dowla
Willamï, who had also been impri∣soned in one of the forts of

<P>When Abul Asakir arrived upon the frontiers, with this powerful

was deserted by many of his friends, who joined his bro∣ther, he determined
to decide the affair with his sword. He accord∣ingly fought with great

displayed uncommon abilities, in reducing those provinces to obedi∣ence.
After the departure of Sultan Musaood, the countries which we have just

departed, the one for Samarcand, and the other for Chorrassan. The brave
Altasash died the second day after, but his death was concealed from the

came to Sultan Musaood, he conferred the government upon Haro the son of
Altasash.</P>

desist from his enterprize. The Sultan begun to listen to the
proposals, when his ears were stunned with a grievous complaint from some
Mussulmen captives, who were then detained in the place. He immediately
broke up the conference, and began to besiege the fort, ordering the ditch to
be filled up with Sugar-canes, from the adjacent plantations. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The garrison put to the sword.</NOTE>This
being done, he ordered scaling ladders to be applied to the walls, which,

fight and retreat, for two days and nights, but Hussein ben Ali could not
be persuaded to quit the field, so that after the most of his men were
killed, he himself fell a prisoner into the hands of the enemy. Buctadi
fled, and carried advice of his own defeat, to Sultan Musaood, at

<P>The Sultan was obliged for that time to restrain his

account of some disturbances in Hindostan. He marched back to Ghizni, in
the year 426; and thence sent an army under Ban, an Indian chief, against

met, Ban was defeated with great slaughter.

chas∣tise him that winter, and in the beginning of the spring, to bring
the other Turkomans of Siljoki to a better understanding. The Omrahs of his
court, with one accord, advised him to march first against the Siljokis,
because they had, for two years, gained an ascendancy over the inhabitants
of Chorrassan, and were daily gaining strength. The Sultan, at that time,
received also a letter from one of the nobles of that province, acquainting
him that his enemies, who were once but Ants, were now become little Snakes,
and if they were not soon destroyed, they might grow in a short time to

But during that winter, such a quantity of snow fell, that it was with the
greatest difficulty he marched back his army towards Ghizni. In the mean
time, Chukker Beg Daood Siljoki marched with an army against Balich, from

to Lahore, sending for his brother Mahummud the blind from his
confinement.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A tumult in the camp.</NOTE>When Musaood
arrived upon the banks of the Gelum, the water of which, on account of its
purity, is called the water of Paradise, the slaves, who were very numerous
in his camp, entered into a confe∣deracy with the camel keepers, and began to
divide the treasure among them. The troops observing this, they were
determined to partake of the spoil, so that in a moment nothing was to be
seen but drawn swords, ravage, and confusion. Every one plundered his
neigh∣bour; some gained much wealth, while others more weak or unfor∣tunate,
were robbed of all upon which they had laid their hands, and stripped of
their own besides. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahummud proclaimed King.</NOTE>The army, for this
tumult, fearing the resentment of the King, and not chusing to refund the
plunder, hastened in a mob to Mahummud the blind, who had been before King,
and, exalting him upon their shoulders, proclaimed him Emperor.</P>
<P>Musaood was, during this time, collecting what friends he could to
suppress the mutiny; but no sooner was it known that his brother was
proclaimed King, than the Sultan found himself intirely deserted. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Musaood de∣posed,</NOTE>The mob pressing
round him, he was obliged to give himself up into their hands, and he was
carried before the new Sultan. Mahummud told him he had no design to take his
life, and desired he might pitch upon some sort, whither he might retire
with his family into confinement. Sultan Musaood, in this extremity, chose
the fort of Kurri, but was even in distress for money to pay his few

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A D. 1041. Higer. 433.</NOTE>menial attendants.
This obliged him to send a person to his brother to request him for
some. Sultan Mahummud accordingly ordered the pitiful sum of five hundred
dirms to be sent him; upon which Musaood, when it was brought him,
exclaimed after the following manner. 
<Q REND="inline">"O wonderful cast of Providence! O cruel reverse
of fate! Yesterday was I not a mighty prince; three thousand camels bending
under my treasure? To-day I am forced to beg, and to receive but the mere
mockery of my wants."</Q> With that he borrowed a thousand dirms from his
servants, and bestowed it in a present upon his brother's messenger,
who had brought the five hun∣dred dirms, which he desired he might again
carry back to his master.</P>
<P>Sultan Mahummud, upon his accession, advanced his son Ahmid to
the government, reserving for himself only the name, though Ahmid was, by
many, supposed to have a tincture of madness in his disposition. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and assassi∣nated.</NOTE>The first thing
he did was, without consulting his father, in conjunction with Soliman ben
Eusoph, and the son of Ali Cheshawind, to go to the castle of Kurri and
assassinate Sultan Musaood, in the year 433. But some affirm, that
he buried him alive in a well.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His character.</NOTE>The reign of Musaood was
nine years and nine months. He was a prince of uncommon strength and bravery;
affable, of easy access, and generous to prodigality; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Munificent to the learned.</NOTE>particularly to
learned men, of whose company he was excessively fond, which drew many
from all parts to his court.</P>
<P>Among the first of the learned in the court of Musaood, we
must reckon Abu Keihan Charismi, a great philosopher and astro∣loger,
who wrote one of the best treatises upon astronomy, called Canoon
Musaoodi, for which he was presented with an elephant made of silver, the
size of which we are not told. Casi Abu <PB N="115" REF="201"/>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charitable.</NOTE>The author of the Rosit ul
Sulja tells us, that so extensive was the King's charity, that some days
in the month of Ramzan, he bestowed often a lack of dirms upon the poor.

he marched from Ghizni; while Mahummud the blind, appointing his younger son
Nami, governor of Pishawir and Moultan, marched in person to the banks of
the Sind to receive Modood, who was moving that way, and the two armies meeting
in the forest of Diner, between the uncle and nephew, the flames of
contention began to arise. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Totally de∣feats Ma∣hummud.</NOTE>The gales of

Ma∣hummud, with his sons, and Tiggi Ali Cheshawind, and Soliman ben

Rahim, the son of Mahummud, whom Modood pardoned for this reason; that
during the time that Musaood was prisoner, Abdul Rahim went with his
brother Abdul Reiman to see him. When, upon this occasion, the latter
insultingly threw off Musaood's royal cap, Abdul Rahim took it up and put
it upon the King's head with much respect, chastising his brother for his
mean and barbarous behaviour.</P>
<P>Modood having thus revenged his father's murder, built a town on the
spot upon which he had obtained the victory, and called it Fatte Abad. He
carried the remains of his father and family, to be interred at Ghizni; whither
he returned, and appointed Abu Niser Ahmed his Vizier. But he soon after
discharged that Omrah from that high office, and conferred the dignity upon
Chuja Tahir. He sent, at the same time, Nisir Ahmed with a force to
Moultan, against Nami, the son of Mahummud, whom he slew, reducing the
country under the obedience of Modood. The Sultan had now nothing to fear but
from his own brother, who was in possession of Lahore and its
dependencies. This brother, upon the murder of his father, marched from
Moultan, and by the council of Eas, possessed himself of all the

so numerous, that the forces of Modood were upon the point of flying at their

themselves under the banners of Mug∣dood. But fortune here, or treachery,
befriended Modood.

<P>Nor was Modood less fortunate towards the north. The province of
Maverulnere, which had for some time asserted its independance,
submitted. But the Siljokies, notwithstanding the King had taken one of the

his territories.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion from Delhi.</NOTE>In the year 435, the
Raja of Delhi, in alliance with others, raising an army, took Hassi,
Tannassar, and their dependencies, from the governors, to whom Modood had
entrusted them. The Hindoos from thence marched towards the sort of
Nagracot, which they besieged for four months, and the garrison being
distressed for provi∣sions, and no succours coming from Lahore, were
under the necessity of capitulating. The Hindoos, according to the antient
form, erected new idols, and recommenced the rites of idolatry.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A pretended vision.</NOTE>We are told, that the
Raja of Delhi, observing a weakness in the empire of Ghizni, pretended to
have seen a vision, in which <PB N="118" REF="204"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1043. Higer. 435.</NOTE>the great idol of
Nagracot told him, that having now revenged him∣self upon Ghizni, he would
meet him at Nagracot in his former temple. This story being propagated by the
Brahmins, who proba∣bly were in the secret, it gained faith among the
superstitious, by which means the Raja was joined by zealots from all
parts, and soon saw himself at the head of a very numerous army. With
this army, as we have already mentioned, he besieged Nagracot, and when the
place surrendered, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A holy trick.</NOTE>he took care to have an idol,
of the same shape and size with the former, which he had caused to be
made at Delhi, introduced, in the night, into a garden in the center of the
place. This image being discovered in the morning, there was a prodigious
rejoicing among his deluded votaries, who exclaimed, that their God was
returned from Ghizni. The Raja, and the Brahmins, taking advantage of the
credulity of the populace, with great pomp and festivity, carried him into
the temple, where he received the worship and congratulations of his
people.</P>
<P>This story raised so much the same of the idol, that
thousands came daily to worship from all parts of Hindostan, as also to
consult him as an oracle, upon all important occasions. The manner of
consultation was this; the persons who came to inquire into futurity,
slept on the floor of the temple before him, after drinking a dose of
something which the Brahmins prescribed, to create dreams, from which they
predicted their fortune, in the morning, according to their own fancy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The siege of Lahore.</NOTE>The success of
the Raja of Delhi gave such confidence to the Rajas of Punjaab, and other
places, that though before like foxes they durst hardly creep from their
holes, for fear of the Musselman arms, yet now they put on the aspect of
lions, and openly set their masters at defiance. Three of those Rajas,
with ten thousand horse, and an innumerable army of foot, advanced to
Lahore, and invested it. <PB N="119" REF="205"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1043. Higer. 435.</NOTE>The Mussulmen,

themselves in order of battle, before the enemy's camp. The Hin∣doos, either
struck with their unexpected appearance, or intimidated by their
resolution, betook themselves instantly to flight, and were pur∣sued
with great slaughter.</P>
<P>In the year preceding this event, the King sent Artagi Hajib, with
an army, to Tiberistan, against the Turkumans. When he reached that place,
he heard that the son of Daood had advanced to Arkin; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turku∣mans defeat∣ed.</NOTE>but when the two
armies drew up in order against one another, the chief of the Turkumans, who
was a young man, without either experience or courage, shewed such
pufillanimity in arranging his troops, that the enemy had begun the charge
before they were pro∣perly formed, which occasioned an immediate confusion,
so that they abandoned the field, and were pursued with great slaughter.
Artagi having returned from the pursuit, marched directly to Balich, which
the Turkumans had taken, and recovered that city out of their hands.</P>
<P>Not long after, the Turkumans advanced again with a powerful force,
and invested the same place. As it was not very defensible, and Artagi
was too weak to engage the enemy in the field, he wrote to Modood for
succours. The succours not arriving, and the general finding his
difficulties daily increasing, and his force diminishing, determined to
evacuate the place, which he accordingly did, and fled to Ghizni, with a few of
his attendants. But the popular outery was so great against the unfortunate

was sent, with a force, towards Bust, from whence he proceeded to
Seistan, and brought his own brother, and Ringi Abu Munsur, who had
rebelled against the King, prisoners to Ghizni. The Turkumans of Siljoki,
in the year following, collected all their forces, and directed their march
towards Ghizni, plundering the palace of Bust. Tughril was ordered against
them, with the troops of Ghizni, and he defeated them with great slaughter,
and pursued them out of the country. After this victory Tughril marched

Tiggiabad, he began to discover the traitor. News of his revolt having
reached Modood, he sent some persons to endeavour to reclaim him to his
duty, with promises of par∣don, and a removal of all the disgusts which
he might have entertained. To this Tughril replied, that the reason of this
step was to secure himself: That he had an information of a plot formed
against his life, by those sycophants, whose only business was to
stand by the throne, and to amuse the too easy ears of the King, with
lies and flattery: That being once forced to disobedience, he had, for a
sub∣ject, gone too far to retreat. The King's emissaries however, though
they had no effect upon Tughril, found that the most part of the chiefs were
still loyal to the King, and brought over others, who <PB N="121" REF="207"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1046. Higer. 438.</NOTE>had changed, rather
out of a desire of innovation, than disaffection to their sovereign. Upon
this they returned, and having told to the King in what manner things were
concerted with the other chiefs, he im∣mediately ordered Ali ben Ribbi, with
two thousand horse, to favour the insurrection, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deserted by his army.</NOTE>so that Tughril,

betook himself to flight, with a few of his adherents.</P>

political matters, had fled from the court, and had taken up his abode in the
mountains of Cashmire. The invitation being complied with, the King desired
his attendance at Ghizni.</P>

himself being then a great favourite, endeavoured to divert Modood's mind to
some important affairs, till he should be able to frame some excuse for
the death of Abu Ali. He at length prevailed upon the Sul∣tan to form an

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibrahim, a religious and good prince.</NOTE>WHEN
Feroch Zaad became the inhabitant of another world, Sultan Ibrahim ascended
the throne of empire: A King remarkable for morality and devotion, having in
the flower of his youth, amidst a paradise of pleasure, conquered all the
sensual appe∣tites, and added two months more to the feast of Ramzan,
which he kept with the strictest severity. He, at the same time, gave
pro∣per attention to government, and the due administration of justice, and
opened the hand of charity to the poor. This prince excelled in the art of fine
writing, and in the libraries of Mecca and Medina, there are two copies of the
Koran wrote by his own hand, which were sent as presents to the
Caliph.—<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with the Turkumans.</NOTE>In the first
year of his reign, he concluded a treaty of peace with the Turkumans, ceding to
them <PB N="129" REF="215"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1058. Higer. 450.</NOTE>all the countries
they had seized, upon condition that they would not lengthen the hand of
violence any further upon his dominions. He married, at the same time, his
son Musaood, to the daughter of their King, Malleck Shaw, which opened the
door of friendship and intercourse between the two nations.</P>
<P>We are told, that before this peace was concluded, Malleck Shaw had
collected a great army, with an intention to invade Ghizni, which greatly
intimidated Ibrahim, as he was not then in a condi∣tion to oppose him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy of Ibrahim.</NOTE>But knowing that policy
is sometimes a good substitute for strength, he wrote letters to the
principal Omrahs of Malleck Shaw's army, which he dispatched by a
messenger who had received his instructions how to proceed. The purport
of those letters was to importune the Omrahs, to whom they were directed, to
hasten the King's march to Ghizni, lest their scheme should be
prematurely discovered; and that they might depend upon his fulfilling his
en∣gagements to their satisfaction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King of the Turkomans deceived.</NOTE>The
messenger accordingly took an opportunity one day, when Malleck Shaw was
hunting, upon the road to Ghizni, to come running towards him; but upon
discovering the King, he stole slowly away, which creating suspicion,
he was pursued by some horsemen, and brought before the King. He was
immediately searched, and the pacquet was found upon him; though he had
previously suffered himself to be severely bastinadoed, without
confessing any thing. The King having read these letters, the power of
the supposed conspira∣tors was such, that there was great danger in
accusing them; but it raised such a diffidence in his mind, that he, from
that time, was desirous of peace, and gave over all thoughts of his
expedition.</P>
<P>When the mind of Ibrahim was quieted from any apprehensions from
that quarter, he sent an army towards Hindostan, and con∣quered 
<PB N="130" REF="216"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1079. Higer. 472.</NOTE>many places in that
country, which before had not been visited by the Mussulman arms. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibrahim's ex∣pedition to Hindostan.</NOTE>In the
year 472, he marched him∣self towards that country, and extended his
conquests to the fort of Ajodin, called now Palanshukurgunge. This place
being taken, he turned to another fort called Rupal, which was built upon the
summit of a steep hill; a river enclosed it on three sides, and a
small peninsula joined it to the other hills, which were entirely covered
with an impervious wood, and much infested by venemous serpents. This,
however, did not discourage the Sultan from his attempt. He ordered some
thousand hatchet men to clear the wood, which they effected in spite of all
opposition; and the rock being soft, the miners forced their way in a
short time under the walls, which were brought down in ruins. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes Rupal.</NOTE>The place was immediately
taken, and the garrison made prisoners.</P>
<P>He marched from thence to another town in the neighbourhood, the
inhabitants of which came originally from Chorrassan, and were banished
thither, with their families, by Afransiab<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A
name common to a long race of Persian Kings.</NOTE>, for frequent rebellions.
Here they formed themselves into a small independant state, being
encircled by impassible mountains; and had preserved their ancient
customs and rites, without intermarrying with any other people. The Sultan
having, with infinite labour, cleared a road for his army over the mountains,
advanced towards the town, which was well fortified. He was overtaken by the
rainy season, and his army was greatly distressed; during three
months he was obliged to remain idle before it. But when the rains began to
abate, and the country to dry up, he summoned the town to surrender, and
acknowledge the faith.</P>
<P>Ibrahim's proposals being rejected he commenced the siege, which
continued some weeks, with great slaughter on both sides. The 
<PB N="131" REF="217"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1079. Higer. 472.</NOTE>town at length was
taken by assault, and the Mussulmen found much wealth within it, and
one hundred thousand unfortunate per∣sons, whom they carried bound to
Ghizni. Some time after, the King accidentally saw one of those unhappy men
carrying a heavy stone with great difficulty and labour, to a palace which
was then building. This awakened his pity; he commanded him to throw it down,
and gave him his liberty.</P>
<P>This stone happened to lie upon the public road, and proved
troublesome to passengers; but as the King's rigid adherence to his
commands was universally known, none would attempt to remove it. A courtier
one day, having stumbled with his horse over this stone, took occasion
to mention it to the King; insinuating, that he thought, if his Majesty
pleased, that it were advisable to have it re∣moved. To which the King
replied; 
<Q REND="inline">"I have commanded it to be thrown there, and there
it must remain; as a memorial of the misfor∣tunes of war, and my own pity:
For it is better for a King to be obstinate, even in his inadvertencies, than
to break his royal word."</Q> The stone was accordingly permitted to remain,
where it is shewn as a curiosity to this day.</P>
<P>Sultan Ibrahim had thirty six sons and forty daughters. The
lat∣ter he gave in marriage to learned and religious men. In the year 492, he
left this mortal state, after having reigned in tranquility and happiness
forty two years. In his time flourished Abul Farrhe, who was a native of
Seistan, according to some, but as others affirm, of Ghizni. He is
esteemed a master in poetry; and the famous An∣suri was one of his
disciples.</P>

Prince was blest with a noble and generous disposition. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An encoura∣ger of learn∣ing.</NOTE>He had an
uncommon thirst after knowlege; he was a great promoter of literature, and a
liberal patron of learned men. Many men of letters resorted to his court,
particularly Shech Nizami, and Seid Hassen, both poets and philosophers
of great fame. Many books were, in this reign, translated from various
languages, into the Per∣sian tongue; among the most famous of which, was an
Hindoo book, called the Killila Dumna, a fabulous story, pregnant with
sound morality, policy, and entertainment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A digression.</NOTE>This book was sent
formerly by the King of Hindostan, accom∣panied by a Chess table, to
Noshirwan, sirnamed The Just, King of Iran. Buzurg Chimere his vizier,
sirnamed The Wise, was so well versed in all the known languages, that
in a few days he translated the Killila Dumna into Phelevi or antient
Persic, to the astonishment of the ambassador, who imagined the
Sanscrita language was entirely unknown in those parts. But he could form
no conception of the chess-board, as that game was, at that time, unknown in
Persia. He therefore had recourse to the ambassador, who was esteemed
the best player in Hindostan, to have this matter explained to him, who
having accordingly discovered to him the principles, Buzurg Chimere sat
down with him to play. The first game he obliged the ambas∣sador to draw;
the second he chaced his King solitary; and the third he gave him
check-mate. The ambassador was so mad to be soiled at his own weapons,
that he would play no more. Buzurg Chimere then invented the game of
back-gammon, returning a set of those <PB N="136" REF="222"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1118. Higer. 512.</NOTE>tables, by the
ambassador, who having related his adventure with Buzurg Chimere, and given
an account of the genius and government of Noshirwan, his master gave up
all thoughts of an invasion, which he had been meditating against that
King.</P>
<P>The present of the chess-board was intended as an experiment
upon the genius of the minister, and to indicate that in the great game of
state, attention and capacity were better friends than fortune. While the
book, in its whole tenor, strongly inculcated that wise maxim, that true
wisdom and policy is always an over-match for strength. The back-gammon
table, which was returned, signified, that attention and capacity alone
cannot always insure success, but that we must play the game of life
according to the casts of fortune.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Byram settles the affairs of

his prosperity, went twice into Hindostan, chastising his refractory
sub∣jects and Zemindars. The first time he went to reduce Mahummud Balin,
who had possession of the government of Lahore, on the part of
Arsilla Shaw, whom he defeated, and took, the 27th of Ramsan, in the year
512, but having pardoned him, upon swearing allegiance, he was again
reinstated in his government, and the King returned to Ghizni. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Balin builds Nagore,</NOTE>In the mean time,
Mahummud Balin built the fort of Nagore, in the country of Sewalic, whither he
conveyed all his wealth, family, and effects; then raising an army,
composed chiefly of Arabs, Persians, Afghans, and Chilligies, he committed
great devastations upon the Hindoo Rajas, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and aspires to the empire.</NOTE>which
success so puffed him up, that he aspired at length to the empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Byram marches against him.</NOTE>Byram Shaw
being apprized of the intentions of Balin, collected his army, and a second

with a powerful <PB N="137" REF="223"/>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lahore again besieged.</NOTE>But the terms not

out, that it was in∣tended against the Turkumans, writing, at the same
time, to Chusero Malleck, that he was desirous of accommodating all their
differences, by a treaty of peace. To convince him of the sincerity of his
in∣tentions, he now returned his son Chusero Shaw, with a splendid
retinue; who had orders to make short marches, while Chusero Malleck,
impatient to see him, advanced a part of the way to meet him. In the mean
time, Shahab ul dien, with twenty thou∣sand horse, with incredible
expedition, marched by another way round the mountains, and cut off Chusero
Malleck from Lahore, having surrounded his small camp in the night.
Chusero Malleck having waked in the morning, from his dream of negligence,
saw no hope of escape left, which obliged him to throw himself upon the
mercy of his adversary.

<HEAD>SECTION XVIII. Of the Dynasty of Ghor.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The origin of the house of Ghor.</NOTE>MORCHAN
the historian tells us, that about the time when Feredoon subdued Zohac
Tazi, two brothers of that family, Souri and Saam, were taken into favour by
the conqueror; but having by some means incurred his displeasure, they
fled with a party of their friends to Hawind, where they took up their abode,
possessing themselves of a small territory. Souri took the
government of this district, appointing his brother to the command of his
small army, and gave his daughter in marriage to his son Suja.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suja the first of that race.</NOTE>Suja, after
his father's decease, enjoyed his place. But some pri∣vate enemies having
traduced him to his uncle, inspired him with jealousy and enmity to such
a degree, that he wanted to take his daughter away from him. When Suja found
this, he was deter∣mined to seek his fortune elsewhere. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flies to the mountains of Ghor.</NOTE>He
accordingly, in the night, with ten horsemen and a few camels, laden with his
effects, set out, with his wife and children to the mountains of Ghor, where
he built a house and called it Romejandish<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That is, Go without care.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Here he was gradually joined by many of his friends, who built a
strong fort, which he held out against the troops of Feredoon 
<PB N="144" REF="230"/> for some time, but at length he was obliged to
submit and pay tribute.</P>
<P>Thus the race of Zohac, one after another, succeeded to this
government, which began to gain strength by degrees, till the time of the
prophet, when it was ruled by Shinsub, who, some say, was converted to
the faith by the great Ali, who confirmed him in his kingdom. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The genea∣logy of the house of Ghor.</NOTE>The
genealogy of the Kings of Ghor, according to the most authentic historians,
runs upward thus. Shinsub ben Haric, ben Nick, ben Meshi, ben Wisen, ben

Punchi, Mahummud ben Soiri, cotemporary with Sultan Mamood of Ghizni; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conquered by Mamood of Ghizni.</NOTE>who conquered
his country and gave it to his son Abu Ali, imprisoning Muhummud his
father.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Subject to the Ghiznian em∣pire.</NOTE>But Abu
Ali, endeavouring to throw off the yoke of Sultan Ma∣mood, he was deposed,
and the country given to Abass his nephew, in whose reign there was seven
years drought in Ghor, so that the earth was burnt up, and thousands of men
and animals perished with heat and famine. Abass, desirous of rendering
himself independent, commenced a war against Sultan Ibrahim, by whom he was
defeated and taken prisoner; the kingdom being conferred upon his son
Ma∣hummud, who swore allegiance to the empire of Ghizni. He was succeeded
by his son Cuttub ul dien Hussein, who was killed by an arrow in the eye,
in attacking a certain fort, when he rebelled against Ghizni.</P>
<P> <PB N="145" REF="231"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The adven∣tures of Sham.</NOTE>Upon the death of
Cuttub, his son Sham was obliged to fly to Hindostan, where he followed the
business of a merchant; and hav∣ing acquired much wealth, he returned up
the Indus to his native country. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wrecked on the Indus.</NOTE>But unfortunately he
was wrecked, narrowly escaping with his life upon a plank, with his son
Ezid ul dien Hussein, after driving with the tide for three days. When they
got foot on shore, they made towards a town that appeared in sight, but, it
being late before they arrived, they could find no lodgings, and were obliged
to creep in under a balcony, where they might sleep out of the rain. The
watch going the rounds perceived them, and without further examination,
concluding they were thieves, carried them to prison. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Condemned to slavery.</NOTE>They were condemned
to slavery for seven years, during which time the son died.</P>
<P>When Sham obtained his liberty, he proceeded towards Ghizni, on the
way to which, he was met by a gang of robbers, that had for a long time
infested the roads. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Taken with robbers.</NOTE>When they saw him a
man of great strength and of a bold appearance, they insisted upon
enrolling him in the gang, to which he was obliged to consent; but
unfortunately that very night, a party of the troops of Sultan Ibrahim
surrounded them and carried them all in chains before the Emperor, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Condemned to death.</NOTE>who imme∣diately
condemned them to death.</P>
<P>When the executioner was binding up the eyes of Sham, he raised a
grievous complaint, protesting, and calling God to witness, that he was
innocent, which softened the steely heart of the execu∣tioner to pity. He
desired him to relate what he had to say in his own defence, which he did
in such a circumstantial and probable manner, that the magistrate who
attended, believing him innocent, petitioned the King to give him a hearing. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pardoned and received in∣to favour by Sultan
Ibra∣him.</NOTE>This being accordingly granted, he acquitted himself with
such modesty and eloquence, that the King commanded him to be released,
and admitted him <PB N="146" REF="232"/> into his particular friendship and
favour. Ibrahim, some time after, created Sham an Omrah, and appointed him
master of requests, in which station he acquitted himself so
honourably, that he rose daily in rank and honours, till Sultan Musaood,
the son of Ibrahim, put him in possession of his hereditary kingdom.
He then married a princess of the house of Ghizni, by whom he had seven
sons, deno∣minated the seven stars.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">History of his sons.</NOTE>After the death of
Hussein Sham, his sons became divided into two factions; one headed by
the governor of Taristan and Hiatilla, whose name was Fuchur ul dien
Musaood, the eldest son: And the other by the fourth son, Nasir ul
dien Mahummud, who took posses∣sion of Ghor. The second son, Cuttub
ul dien Mahummud, took possession of the hills, and founded the city of
Firose Ko, which he made his capital; and raising himself in a few years
to great power, he meditated an attempt upon the empire of Ghizni, collecting
soldiers of fortune from all parts. But Byram Shaw, being privately
acquainted of his intentions, treacherously invited him in friendship to
Ghizni, where, contrary to all the laws of honour and hospitality, he ordered
poison to be administered to him, which proved the fatal cause of the war
between the houses of Ghor and Ghizni.</P>
<P>Seif ul dien Souri the fifth son, who had accompanied his brother,
escaped the snare and fled to Firose Ko. He there placed himself at the
head of his brother's army, and marched towards Ghizni to revenge his death, as
we have seen in the history of that kingdom. He took Ghizni, and Byram Shaw
fled to Hindostan. But Byram returning again in the winter, when the troops
of Seif ul dien were mostly gone to Ferose Ko and Ghor, from whence they
could not easily return, on account of the roads and deep snow, Seif ul
dien, as before related, was treacherously delivered up to him, and with his
vizier, put to a most ignominious death.</P>
<P> <PB N="147" REF="233"/> The consequence of this impolitic cruelty
was, that Baha ul dien Sham, the sixth brother, prepared to invade Byram,
with an army from Firoze Ko and Ghor; but dying in the interim, the command
devolved upon the seventh brother, Alla ul dien the incendiary, who took and
destroyed Ghizni. He carried his ravages so far as to de∣stroy every
monument and tomb of the Ghiznian Kings, excepting those of the Sultans
Mamood, Musaood, and Ibrahim, throwing fire into their very graves, and
defacing their inscriptions upon all public edifices. When he returned to
Ghor, he appointed his nephew Yeas ul dien Mahummud Sham, and Moaz ul dien
Mahummud Sham, to the government of a province of Ghor called Singia.</P>
<P>But when they found the revenues of that province could not
sup∣port the figure which they endeavoured to make, by their un∣bounded
generosity and liberality to military men, whom they began to collect from
all parts; they began to extend their limits. This having reached the ears of
Alla ul dien, he sent a force against them, and seizing them both,
confined them in the fort of Goristan.</P>
<P>Alla then turned the hostile spear against Sultan Sinjer, to
whom his father paid tribute. He overrun the provinces of Balich and Herat; but
coming to an engagement with the Sultan, he was de∣feated and taken prisoner.
Notwithstanding all which, the Sultan had compassion upon him, and again
confirmed him in the kingdom of Ghor, where he died in the year five hundred
and fifty-one.</P>
<P>Alla was succeeded by his son Seif ul dien Mahummud, who upon
his accession released his two cousins from their confinement at
Go∣ristan, and bestowed the government of Singia upon them. In little more
than a year, he commenced a war with the tribe of Turku∣mans called Ghiza, and
in the day of battle, was killed by one of his own men.</P>
<P> <PB N="148" REF="234"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1171. Higer. 567.</NOTE>He was succeeded
by Yeas ul dien Mahummud ben Sham, the eldest of his two cousins, who
appointed his brother Shab ul dien his general, and in a short time,
subdued Chorrassan and a great part of Hindostan, of which countries,
he annexed the titles to his own, and died in the year 599, after a glorious
reign of upwards of forty six years.</P>

the province of Chorrassan. He continued from thence to make incursions
upon Ghizni, as we have observed in the history of that kingdom.</P>
<P>In the year 567, Sultan Yeas ul dien marched in person against
the Omrahs of Chusero Malleck, and entirely reduced them. He gave the
government of Ghizni to Shâb ul dien, who, according to his brother's
orders, in the year 572, led an army towards Moultan, which he entirely
subdued. He marched from thence to Adja. The Raja of that place shut
himself up in a strong fort. Shab ul dien began to besiege the place;
but, finding it would be a difficult task to reduce it, he sent a private
message to the Raja's wife, promising to marry her if she would make
away with her husband.</P>
<P> <PB N="149" REF="235"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1178. Higer. 574.</NOTE>The base woman
returned for answer, that she was rather too old herself to think of
matrimony, but that she had a beautiful young daughter, whom, if he would
promise to espouse, and leave her in free possession of the
country and its wealth, she would in a few days remove the Raja. Shab ul dien
basely accepted of the proposal, and the wicked woman accordingly, in a few
days, found means to assassinate her husband, and to open the gates
to the enemy.</P>
<P>Shab ul dien confirmed his promise, by marrying the daughter, upon
acknowledging the true faith; but he made no scruple to deviate from what
respected the mother; for, instead of trusting her with the country, he
sent her off to Ghizni, where she soon died of grief and resentment.
Nor did the daughter relish her situation bet∣ter; for, in the space of
two years, she also fell a victim to grief.</P>
<P>Sultan Shab ul dien having conferred the government of Moultan and
Adja upon Ali Kirbach, returned to Ghizni; from whence, in the year 574, he
again marched to Adja and Moultan, and from those places, continued his
course through the sandy desart, to Guze∣rat. Raja Bim Deo advanced
thither with a great army, to give him battle, in which the Mussulmen were
defeated, with great slaughter, and suffered many hardships in their
retreat, till they arrived at Ghizni.</P>
<P>In the year following, he marched his recruited army towards
Peshawir, known in antient history by the names of Bickraam, Fir∣shoor,
and Poorshoor, which he in a short time brought under subjection. He
proceeded in the course of the next year, towards Lahore, where he invested
Chusero Malleck, who had been so weakened at that time, by wars with the
Rajas of Hind, and the Afghans, that he could not oppose him in the field.
But Shab ul dien, finding he could not reduce the place, he intimated a
desire of treating with <PB N="150" REF="236"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1179. Higer. 575.</NOTE>Chusero Malleck,
who, glad to get rid of him, made him some pre∣sents, and gave his son as

them.</P>
<P>Shab ul dien returned to Ghizni, but he could not rest long in
peace. He, the very next year, drew his army towards Dewil, in the province of
Sind, and subdued all the country to the sea coast, returning loaded with
rich spoil.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Higer. 580.</NOTE>In the year 580 he returned
again to Lahore, where Chusero Mal∣leck shut himself up as before,
sustaining a long siege, which at length Shab ul dien was obliged to
raise. He in this expedition, built the fort of Salcot, in which he left a
garrison to command the countries between the rivers Ravi and Chinab, under
the government of Hussein Churmili, while he himself returned to Ghizni.
This fort, as we have before related, was ineffectually besieged by Chusero
Mal∣leck, in the absence of Shab ul dien, which occasioned his third
expedition towards Lahore, which he took in the year 582, by the perfidious
stratagem mentioned in the conclusion of the history of Ghizni. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan extirpates the royal family of
Ghizni.</NOTE>He sent Chusero Malleck and his family, prisoners to his
brother at Firose Ko, who confined them in a fort in Ghirgistan, where they
were some time afterwards put to death, on account of something the
astrologers had predicted concerning them.</P>
<P>When Shab ul dien had settled the provinces of Lahore, he left the
government of that place in the hands of Ali Kirbach, governor of Moultan, and
returned himself to Ghizni. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He marches to Hindostan.</NOTE>In the year 587,
he marched again towards Hindostan, and, proceeding to Ajmere, took the
capital of Tiberhind, where he left Malleck Zea ul dien, with above a
thousand chosen horse, and some foot, to garrison the place. He
himself was upon his way back, when he heard that Pittu Ra, the Raja of
Ajmere, with his brother Candi Ra, Raja of Delhi, in alli∣ance

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1191. Higer. 587.</NOTE>with some other
Hindoo Rajas, were marching towards Tiber∣hind, with two hundred thousand
horse, and three thousand elephants. Shab ul dien determined to return to
the relief of the garrison. He met the enemy at the village of Sirauri, upon
the banks of the Sirsutti, seven crores from Tannassar, and forty
crores from Delhi, and gave them battle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Engages the Hindoos.</NOTE>Upon the first
onset his right and left wings retired, being out∣flanked by the enemy, till,
joining in the rear, his army was formed into a circle. Shab ul dien, who was
in person in the centre of the line, when first formed, was told that his
right and left wings were defeated, and advised to provide for his own
safety. Enraged at this council, he smote the imprudent adviser, and
rushed on towards the enemy, among whom he commenced, with a few followers, a
great slaughter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A single com∣bat between the Sultan and the
Raja of Delhi.</NOTE>The eyes of Candi Ra, Raja of Delhi, fell upon him. He
drove the elephant upon which he was mounted, directly against him. The
Sultan rising from his horse, threw his lance with such force at the
elephant, that he drove out three of his back teeth. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is over∣thrown.</NOTE>In the mean time the Raja
of Delhi from above, pierced the Sultan through the right arm, and had almost
thrown him to the ground; when some of his chiefs advanced to his rescue.
This gave an opportunity to one of his faithful servants, to leap behind him
as he was sinking from his horse, and supporting him in his arms, he
carried him from the field, which, by this time, was deserted almost by his
whole army. The enemy pursued them near twenty crores.</P>
<P>After this defeat, and when he had recovered of his wound at Lahore,
he appointed governors to the different provinces he possessed in
Hindostan, and returned himself to Ghor with his army. At Ghor he
disgraced all those Omrahs who had deserted him in battle.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1192. Higer. 588.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Extraordinary punishment of cowardly Omrahs.</NOTE>He obliged
them to walk round the city, with their horses mouth∣bags filled with barley,
hanging about their necks; at the same time forcing them to eat, or have
their heads struck off; the former of which they chiefly chose to do.</P>
<P>We are told by Eben Asire, contrary to all other authority, that
when Sultan Shab ul dein was wounded, he fell from his horse, and lay upon
the field among the dead, till night. And that, in the dark, a party of his own
horse returned to search for his body, and carried him off to his own
camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The combi∣ned Rajas take Tiber∣hind.</NOTE>Upon
the retreat of the Sultan, the allied Rajas continued their march to Tiberhind,
which they besieged for one year and one month, and at last were obliged to
give favourable terms of capitu∣lation. Sultan Shab ul dien remained a few
months with his bro∣ther at Ghor, and then returning to Ghizni, spent the
ensuing year in indolence and festivity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan raises a fine army.</NOTE>But
ambition again fermenting in his mind, he recruited a noble army,
consisting of one hundred thousand chosen horse, Turks, Persians,
and Afghans, many of whom had their helmets ornamented with jewels, and their
armour inlaid with silver and gold. With these he marched in martial
splendor, from Ghizni towards Hindostan, without disclosing to his
friends any part of his intentions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His confer∣ence with a sage.</NOTE>When his

prostrating himself before him, said,

accordingly obeyed the order, and were each honoured with a chelat, according
to their rank. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declares war against the Hindoos.</NOTE>The next

the locusts. The Hindoos again waited to receive Shab ul dien upon the former
field of battle. The two armies incamped in sight of each other, with the

swore by the water of the Ganges, that they should conquer their enemies,

generals to second him, he made a resolute charge, and carried death and
confusion among the Hindoo ranks. The disorder increased every where,

Kinnoge, and engaged Rai Joy Chund, who was Lord of Kinnoge and Bena-ris, and
who commanded a very numerous army of horse, besides four hundred
elephants. This Raja led his forces into the field between Chundwar and Atava,
where he received a total defeat from the vanguard of the Ghiznian army, led by
Cuttub ul dien Abiek, and all his baggage and elephants were taken. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shab ul dien takes Assi and Benaris.</NOTE>The
Sultan then marched to the fort of Assi, where Joy Chund had laid up his
treasure, which in a few days he took, and found there, gold, silver, and
precious stones, to a great amount. He marched from thence to Benaris, and
broke down the idols in above one thousand temples, which he purified and
consecrated to the true God. Here he also found immense plunder. He
returned then to the fort of Kole, where he again confirmed Cuttub ul dien in
the regency of Hindostan, and from thence, laden with treasure, he took the
rout of Ghizni.</P>
<P>In the mean time, one of the relations of Pitta Rai whose name was
Himrage, invaded Gola the son of Pittu Rai, and drove him out of Ajmere. Gola
immediately had recourse for assistance to Cuttub ul dien Abiek. Cuttub
accordingly marched, in the year 591, from Delhi against Himrage, who having
collected a great army, gave the Mussulmen battle, in which he lost the
victory and <PB N="157" REF="243"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A D. 1194. Higer. 591.</NOTE>his life. Cuttub,
after this victory, appointed a governor of his own faith to superintend the
Raja, then led his army to Narwalla in the province of Guzerat, and defeating
Bim Deo took ample re∣venge for the overthrow given to his Lord. He plundered
that rich country; but he was soon recalled, by orders from Ghizni, and
commanded to proceed immediately to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shab ul dien again invades Hindostan.</NOTE>In
the year following, Sultan Shab ul dien formed again a reso∣lution of
returning to Hindostan, and proceeding to Biana. He took it, and conferred
the government upon Baha ul dien Tughril; and leaving with him the body of his
army, he commanded him to besiege Gualier, and returned himself to settle
some affairs at Ghizni. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gualier taken.</NOTE>In the mean time, the
strong fort of Gualier was taken, after a long siege. Tughril, ambitious of
extending his conquests further, led his army against the Rajaputs of the
south. But he received a terrible defeat, and was obliged to take the
protec∣tion of his forts.</P>
<P>In the year 593, Cuttub ul dien marched again from Delhi, and
reduced Narwalla of Guzerat, with all its dependencies. He, after his return,
took the forts of Callinger, Calpee and Budaoon.</P>
<P>Sultan Shab ul dien, was in the mean time engaged in an expe∣dition
to Toos and Sirchus. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Yeas ul dien dies.</NOTE>News was then
brought to him of the death of his brother Sultan Yeas ul dien, who retained
nothing of the empire but the name. Shab ul dien, upon this, acceded to the
empire. He turned by the way of Badyeish, and subdued the country of
Chorrassan, which he divided among the family of Saam, giving the
government of Firose Ko and Ghor to Malleck Zea ul dien, who was son in law
to his brother Yeas ul dien the deceased Emperor. Bust, Ferra and
Isphorar he gave to Sultan Mamood, <PB N="158" REF="244"/>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches into Charizm and besieges the

of Murve, and in the beginning of the next, marched to the conquest of that
country, advancing by the way of Charizm, and Charizm Shaw, not able to
oppose him in the field, shut himself up in the city. The Sultan pitched
his camp on the banks of the great ca∣nal, which the Chilligies had formerly
dug to the westward of that city. He forthwith attacked the place, and in a
few days lost many brave Omrahs in the pursuit of glory. In the mean time,
news arrived, that Aibeck, the general of Ghor Chan, King of Chitta, and Sultan
Osman King of Samarcand, were advancing with great armies, to the relief of
Charizm Shaw. Shab ul dien was so unwilling to abandon his hopes of taking
the city, that he delayed till the allied armies advanced so near, that he
was under a necessity of burning all his baggage, and to retreat with the
utmost expedition towards Chorrassan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forced to re∣treat, and is defeated.</NOTE>But an
army from the city pressed so close upon his heels, that he was obliged
to give them battle. He was totally defeated, losing all his Elephants and

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is again totally over∣thrown.</NOTE>In the
mean time, Sultan Osman and Abieck, who had taken a circuit, to cut off Shab
ul dien's retreat, met him full in the face, as he was flying from Charizm
Shaw. Under a fatal necessity, he was obliged to rally his army, who now
saw no safety in flight. Surrounded thus by the enemy, he commenced a
desperate carnage. But valour was overpowered by numbers in the end, and of
his late mighty army, there now remained scarce a hundred men, who 
<PB N="159" REF="245"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1203. Higer. 600.</NOTE>still defended
their King, and in spite of innumerable foes, hewed him out a passage,
and conducted him safe to the fort of Hindohood, which was at a small
distance from the field. Shab ul dien was be∣sieged here by the enemy, but
upon paying a great ransom to Sultan Osman, and giving up the place, he was
permitted to return in sor∣row to his own dominions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Birka, by a villainous ex∣pedient, gets the
govern∣ment of Moultan.</NOTE>When Sultan Shab ul dien was defeated, one of his
officers of state, named Abiek Nack Birka, escaped from the field, and
imagin∣ing the King was slain, with very great expedition made his way to
Moultan, without mentioning the affair to any body. He waited immediately upon
Meer dad Hassen, governor of that province, and told him that he had a
private message from the King. Hassen re∣tired with him into his
closet, where the villain, whispering in his ear, drew out a dagger and
stabbed him to the heart. He ran in∣stantly into the court yard, where he
proclaimed aloud, that he had killed the traitor, Meer dad Hassen, in
obedience to the King's command. Producing then a false order and
commission, to take the government into his own hands, he was acknowledged
by the army and the people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief of the Gickers aspires to the

certainly slain, aspired to the empire, and raising a great army,
ad∣vanced towards Lahore; kindling the war between the rivers Gelum and Sodra. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan refused ad∣mittance into
Ghizni.</NOTE>When the Sultan, from the fort of Hindohood, arrived at Ghizni;
his own slave Ildecuz, having seized upon the supreme authority in the
city, presented himself to oppose his entrance, which obliged the King to
continue his rout to Moultan. There Birka also rebelled against him; but
the Sultan, being by this time joined by many of his friends, gave him battle,
and obtaining a compleat victory, took the traitor prisoner. He then, with
all the troops of the borders of Hindostan, who now joined his standard, 
<PB N="160" REF="246"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1203. Higer. 600.</NOTE>marched to Ghizni,
and the citizens presenting him with the head of the rebellious slave,
obtained their pardon.</P>
<P>Shab ul dien, at this time, concluded a treaty of peace with Charizm
Shaw; and then, in order to chastise the Gickers, drew his army to∣wards
Hindostan. Cuttub ul dien attacked them on the other side, with his army
from Delhi, and the Gickers being defeated and dis∣persed, the Sultan
parted, at Lahore, with Cuttub ul dien, who returned to his government of
Delhi.</P>
<P>During the residence of the Sultan at Lahore, the Gickers, who
inhabited the country from the Nilaab, up to the fort of the moun∣tains of
Sewalic, began to exercise unheard-of cruelties upon the Mussulmen; so
that the communication between Peshawir and Moul∣tan was entirely cut off. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gickers a tribe of bar∣barians.</NOTE>These
Gickers were a race of wild bar∣barians, without either religion or morality.
It was a custom among them, as soon as a female child was born, to carry
her to the market place, and there proclaim aloud, holding the child in one
hand, and a knife in the other, that any person who wanted a wife might now
take her, otherwise she was immediately put to death. By this means, they
had more men than women, which occasioned the custom of several
husbands to one wife. When this wife was visited by one of her husbands,
she set up a mark at the door, which being observed by any of the others,
who might be coming on the same errand, he immediately withdrew, till the
signal was taken away.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are con∣verted.</NOTE>This barbarous people
continued to make incursions upon the Mahommedans, till in the latter end of
this King's reign, their chieftain was converted to the Mussulman faith, by
one of his cap∣tives. He, upon this change of principles, addressed the
King, who advised him to endeavour to convert his people; and at the same
time, honoured him with a title and dress, and confirmed him in

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1205. Higer. 602.</NOTE>the command of the
mountains. A great part of these mountaineers be∣ing very indifferent about
religion, followed the opinions of their chief, and acknowledged the true
faith. At the same time, about four hundred thousand Caffers of Teraiba,
who inhabited the mountains between Ghizni and Punjaab, were converted, some
by force, and others by inclination.</P>
<P>The Sultan, having settled the affairs of Hindostan in peace,
marched, in the year 602, from Lahore to Ghizni. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shab ul dien proposes to invade
Tur∣kestan.</NOTE>He conferred the government of Bamia upon Baha ul dien

to take sa∣tisfaction for his former defeat, to march at an appointed time,
with all the forces of those parts, and encamp on the banks of the Geihu,
where he would receive further orders, and at the same time to throw a bridge
over the river.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Twenty Gickers form a conspiracy.</NOTE>Shab ul

place called Rimeik, twenty Gickers, who had lost some of their relations
in their wars with the Sultan, entered into a conspiracy against his life,
and sought an opportunity to put their wicked purpose in execution. The
weather being close and sultry, the King ordered the Canats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Screens which surround the King's tents, forming a large

air, which gave them an opportunity of seeing the King's sleeping tent.
They cut their way through the screens in the night, and hid themselves in
a corner, while one of them advanced to the door; but being there stopt by
one of the guards, who was going to seize him, he buried his dagger in his
breast. The groans of the dying man being heard within, alarmed the rest of
the guards in the outer tent, who running out to see what was the matter, the
other assassins took that op∣portunity of cutting their way through the
King's tent behind. <PB N="162" REF="248"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1205. Higer. 602.</NOTE>They found him

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan assassinated.</NOTE>They at

been pierced with no less than forty wounds.</P>
<P>Thus tragically fell that great King and conqueror Moaz ul dien, in
the year 602, after a reign of thirty two years from the com∣mencement of his
government over Ghizni, and three from his accession to the empire, the
honours and titles of which he permitted his elder brother to retain during his
life. One daughter only re∣mained of his race.</P>
<P>His Vizier Chaja Moweid ul Mulluck, took some of the
assassins, and put them to a cruel death. He then called the Omrahs
together, and having obtained their promise of fidelity, in protecting the
King's treasure, which was loaded on four thousand camels, he prevented the
army and the slaves, who had proposed to plunder it, from putting their
scheme in execution. He carried the body in mournful pomp towards Ghizni. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disputes a∣bout the suc∣cession.</NOTE>But
when they reached Peshawir, a great contest arose about the

the Vizier and Turkish chiefs, on Yeas ul dien Mamood, son of the former
Emperor.</P>
<P>The Vizier therefore wanted to go by the way of Kirma, where he knew
that the governor Ildecuz, was in the interest of Yeas ul dien, hoping, by
his assistance, to secure, at least, the treasure for his own
party. The Omrahs of Ghor, were equally desirous of proceeding by that road
which lay nearest to Bamia, that they might be the sooner supported by
Saam. At length, being upon the eve of open hostility, the point was given up
to the Vizier.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. The Reign of Sultan CUTTUB UL DIEN ABIEK.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1205. Higer. 602.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuttub ul dien Abiek,</NOTE>SULTAN Cuttub ul dien Abiek, was of a
brave and virtuous disposition, open and liberal to his friends, and
courteous and affable to strangers. In the art of war and government he was
infe∣rior to none, nor was he a mean proficient in literature.</P>
<P>In his childhood he was brought from Turkestan to Nishapoor, and
there sold by a merchant, to Casi Fuchur ul dien ben Abdu, Azizi Kufi, who,
finding that heaven had endued him with a great ge∣nius, sent him to
school, where he made a wonderful progress in the Persian and Arabic
languages, and in all the polite arts and sciences. <PB N="165" REF="251"/>
But his patron and master dying suddenly, he was sold as part of his
estate, by his relations, and bought by a rich merchant, for a great sum of
money, and presented for sale to Sultan Shab ul dien. The Sultan
purchased him, and called his name Abiek, from having his little finger
broke. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">his rise,</NOTE>He behaved himself in such a
becoming and assiduous manner, that he soon attracted the notice of his
prince, and daily gained confidence and favour. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">generosity.</NOTE>One night the Sultan kept a
magnificent festival at court, and ordered a liberal distribution of
presents and money to be made among his servants. Abiek par∣took largely of
his munificence, but had no sooner retired, than he divided his share among
his companions. The Prince having heard of this circumstance, asked him the
cause, and Abiek, kissing the earth, replied; 
<Q REND="inline">"That all his wants were amply supplied by his
Majesty's bounty. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">affability,</NOTE>He had therefore no desire
of burthening himself with superfluities, his favour being a certain
independence."</Q> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">capacity,</NOTE>This answer so pleased the
King, that he immediately gave him an office near his person, and in a little
time, was so satisfied with his diligence and capacity, that he appointed
him master of the horse.</P>
<P>When the princes of Ghor, Ghizni and Bamia had drawn their forces
towards Chorrassan, in order to expel the Shaw, Sultan of Charizm, from
that province, Abiek went out with a detachment to forage on the banks of the
Murgaab. He was there surrounded by a numerous party of the enemy. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and valour.</NOTE>But though he did the utmost
justice to valour, he was, after the loss of most of his men, taken
prisoner, and carried to Charizm Shaw, who put him in chains. But the Shaw
being defeated, Abiek was left in this manner, sitting upon a camel in the
field, and carried to his victorious master; who pitying his condition,
received him with great kindness.</P>
<P>In the year 588, when the Sultan took revenge of his enemies the
Hindoos for the defeat they had given him, he upon his return, 
<PB N="166" REF="252"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Made gover∣nor in Hin∣dostan,</NOTE>appointed
Cuttub ul dien Abiek, to the chief command of the army left to protect his
conquest. In discharge of this duty, Cuttub took possession of many
districts around, and reduced the fort of Merat. He also drew his army
towards Delhi, and invested it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and besieges Delhi.</NOTE>But the garri∣son,
finding that their own numbers triply exceeded the besiegers, marched out of
the place, and drew up in order of battle, which was gladly accepted by Abiek. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Delhi taken.</NOTE>When the slaughter became
great on both sides, and the river Jumna was discoloured with blood, the
Rajaputs were, at length, put to flight, taking protection within their walls.
The garrison, after a desperate siege, were at last obliged to
capitulate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuttub de∣feats the Jits.</NOTE>In the year 589,
the Jits, who were subject to the Raja of Nar∣walla, advanced with an army to
besiege Hassi. Cuttub ul dien Abiek marched with his forces to protect
it, and obliging them to raise the siege, pursued them to their own
frontiers. In the year following, he crossed the Jumna, and took the fort
of Kole by assault. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In great fa∣vour with the Sultan.</NOTE>He found
there a thousand fine horses, and much spoil, and being informed of
Sultan Shab ul dien's expedition towards Kin∣noge, he thought proper to proceed
as far as Peshawir, to meet him, presenting him with a hundred fine
horses, and two great elephants, one of which carried a chain of gold, and
the other a chain of silver. He mustered there, before the Sultan, fifty
thousand horse, and was honoured with an honorary dress, and with the
command of the van of the royal army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeats the Raja of Bena∣ris.</NOTE>With the van
he defeated the Raja of Benaris, who, upon seeing his army retreat, pushed
forward his elephant, in despair, against his enemy; but Cuttub ul dien,
who excelled in archery, sunk an arrow in the ball of his eye, which brought
him down from his ele∣phant to the ground. It is said that the number of
slain was so great, that the body of the Raja for a long time could not be
found <PB N="167" REF="253"/> by his friends, who were permitted to search for
it. But, at last, he was discovered by his teeth, which, happening to be
bad, were sup∣plied by artificial ones, fixed in by golden wedges and
wires.</P>
<P>Sultan Shab ul dien, following with the body of the army, entered
the city of Benaris, and took possession of the country, as far as the
boundaries of Bengal, without opposition. He broke down all the idols, and
loaded four thousand camels with the most valuable spoils.</P>
<P>Cuttub ul dien presented the King with above three hundred
ele∣phants, taken from the Raja of Benaris. The riders had a signal given
them to make the elephants SELAM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is to fall upon

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A white ele∣phant.</NOTE>which they all did except
one white elephant. This animal was esteemed an inestimable curiosity.
But upon this occasion, though extremely tractable at other times, had
almost killed his rider, when he endea∣voured to force him to pay his
obedience.</P>
<P>The King, when he was setting out for Ghizni, sent the white
elephant back, in a present to Cuttub ul dien, and adopted him his son in
his letter. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuttub ul dien adopted by the
Sul∣tan.</NOTE>Cuttub, ever afterwards till his death, rode the white elephant;
and when he died, the affectionate animal pined away with visible sorrow,
and expired the third day after. This was the only white elephant of which we
have ever heard in Hindostan; but it is said, that the King of Pegu keeps
always two white ele∣phants, and that, when one of them dies, he issues out
an order over all his dominions, to search the woods for another to supply
his place. Cuttub ul dien, after the departure of the King, remained some
days at Assi, where the Raja's treasure was found. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuttub de∣feats the ge∣neral of Him∣rage,</NOTE>He
then returned to Delhi, and there received advice that Himrage Rajaput was
marching down from the mountains of Abugur, and had driven Gola, the Raja of
Ajmere, towards Rintimpore, and that Chitter <PB N="168" REF="254"/> Rai,
Himrage's general, was marching with another army, towards Delhi, before which
he soon arrived, and began to destroy the coun∣try. Cuttub ul dien marched
out to chastise him, and separating twenty thousand horse from the
rest of his army, he set out in front, and engaging the enemy, put them to
flight. Chitter Rai, some days after, rallying his defeated army, retreated
towards Ajmere, and was pursued all the way by the conqueror. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Him∣rage himself</NOTE>Himrage being joined
by his general, in confidence of his superior numbers, formed his army in
order of battle. When they came to blows, he distin∣guished himself by
his bravery, as well as by his conduct; but, being slain, his army took the
way of infamy before them. Thus Ajmere was restored to the Mahommedan
government, and was afterwards ruled by their laws.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ravages the territory of Narwalla.</NOTE>In the
year 590, Cuttub turned his arms towards Narwalla, and Setwan, the general of
Bimdeo, who was encamped under the walls, fled upon his approach. But being
pursued, he drew up his army, and fought till he lost his life, and then
his army resumed their flight. Bimdeo, upon intelligence of this defeat, fled
from his dominions, and Cuttub ul dien ravaged the country at leisure, and
found much spoil. He marched from thence to the fort of Hassi, which he
repaired, then having visited Koram, returned to Delhi.</P>
<P>He in the mean time received advice, from the governor of the
districts near Rintimpore, that the brother of the Raja of Ajmere, who lived
in the hills, was marching down with an army to invade him. This obliged Cuttub
ul dien to move immediately to his relief. The enemy, upon hearing this, fled;
and Cuttub paid a visit to Raja Gola, who entertained him magnificently, and
at his departure, presented him with some fine jewels, and two melons of
gold. When he had settled the country, he again returned to Delhi, 
<PB N="169" REF="255"/> from whence he wrote to the King a particular account of
his con∣quests, which so pleased Sultan Shab ul dien,

<P>Cuttub ul dien, some time after, obtained leave to return to his
government, and on his way, married the daughter of Sultan Tage ul dien, of
Kirman, making a magnificent rejoicing upon the occa∣sion, when he returned
to Delhi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In conjuncti∣on with the Sultan,</NOTE>He soon
after marched his army to the siege of the fort of Biana, and, when he was on
his way, he heard that Shab ul dien had taken the rout of Hindostan. To
shew his respect for the Sultan, Cuttub returned back as far as Hassi
to meet him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">reduces Biana</NOTE>Both returned to Biana,
besieged and took the place, which the Sultan submitted to the command of
Tughril, one of his particular and trusty slaves. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Gualier.</NOTE>They then took the rout of
Gualier, where the Raja Shilkuman agreed to pay tribute, and bought peace with
a great sum of ready money, and with jewels. The Sultan, immediately after
these transactions, returned to Ghizni, leaving Cuttub ul dien viceroy of
all the conquered provinces of Hindostan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches against the Rajaputs,</NOTE>About this
time news arrived that the Rajas of the Rajaputs had entered into an alliance
with the Raja of Narwalla, and had formed a design to recover Ajmere from the
Mahommedans. The troops of Cuttub ul dien being dispersed over the
provinces, he was forced to march against the Rajaputs, with what small
part of the army lay in Delhi, to prevent their junction with the forces of
Narwalla; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and is defeat∣ed,</NOTE>but he was defeated,
received six wounds, and was often dismounted, yet he fought like a man who

sent a great force from Ghizni, to the relief of Cuttub. Ajmere held out till
the arrival of the Ghiznians, who obliged the enemy to raise the siege.
Cuttub ul dien pursued them to Narwalla, in the year 593, taking in his way
the forts of Tilli and Buzule. He there received advice that Walin and
Darapariss Rajaputs, in alliance with the Raja of Narwalla, were encamped
near the fort of Abugur, to guard the passes into Guzerat. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Overthrows the Hindoos.</NOTE>Cuttub
notwithstanding the difficulties of the road, and disadvantages of ground,
resolved to attack them, which he did, with such bravery and conduct, that,
having trodden down their ranks, above fifty thousand of the enemy, with
their blood, tempered the dust of the field. Twenty thousand were taken
priso∣ners, and an immense spoil fell into his hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches to Guzerat.</NOTE>When he had given his
army some respite from slaughter and fatigue, he pursued his rout into
Guzerat, and ravaged that country without further opposition, taking the city
of Narwalla, where an Omrah with a strong garrison was left. He then
returned to Delhi, by the way of Ajmere, and sent a great quantity of jewels
and gold, and also many slaves to the Sultan at Ghizni, and divided the
re∣mainder among his trusty partners in the glories of the field.</P>
<P>In the year 599, he mustered his forces and marched to the siege
of Calinger, where he was met by the Raja of that country, whom he defeated;
and dismounting his cavalry, began to besiege him in his fort. The Raja
seeing himself hard pressed, offered Cuttub ul dien the same tribute
and presents which his ancestors had formerly paid to Sultan Mamood. The
proposal was accepted, but the Vizier, who wanted to hold out without coming
to any terms, found means to make away with the Raja, while the presents were
preparing to be sent. The flag of hostility was again hoisted upon the
fort, and the siege recommenced. The place, however, was in a short time 
<PB N="171" REF="257"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes Calin∣ger.</NOTE>reduced, on account of the
drying up of a spring upon that hill whereon the fort stood, and which
supplied the garrison with water. There is a tradition among the natives of

artillery of the place. This story may possibly, from a natural cause,
have some foundation. But we are rather tempted to believe, that the
present drying up of this spring was owing to the increase of
inhabitants, and the thirst occasioned by hard duty; for, besides the
garrison, Cuttub ul dien found there fifty thousand male and female.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes Mhoba and Budaso.</NOTE>The plunder of
this city was very great, in gold, jewels and precious effects. Cuttub then
marched to the city of Mhoba, the capital of the Raja of Calpee. He also took
that place, together with Budaso, between the rivers Jumna and Ganges.
Mahummud Bucht Ear Chillige, who had been appointed governor of Behar, came at
this time to pay him a visit, laying rich presents at his feet, and Cuttub
having entertained him magnificently, returned to Delhi.</P>

glory. When matters were peaceably settled in this quar∣ter, he returned to
his government; and Sultan Shab ul dien, upon his way to Ghizni, was inhumanly
assassinated by the Gickers. Shab ul dien's nephew, Yeas ul dien Mamood
ascended the throne of Ghor, and upon his accession sent all the

of Sultan of Prince to Cuttub ul dien, desirous of retaining him in his

tarnished his glory.

<HEAD>SECTION II. The Reign of TAJE UL DIEN ELDOZE.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Taje ul dien's rise.</NOTE>SULTAN Shab ul dien,
during his reign, having no children of his own excepting one daughter, had
taken a particular pleasure in educating Turkish slaves, whom he
afterwards adopted as his chil∣dren. Four of those slaves besides Cuttub
ul dien became great princes, of whom the present Taje ul dien Eldoze was
one. The King having observed him to be a youth of genius, advanced him
gradually, till at last he bestowed upon him the government of Kirma and
Shinoran, which lay between Ghizni and Hindostan. His situation gave him an
opportunity of frequently entertaining his prince, upon his expeditions to and
from that country, which he always did with great magnificence and festivity,
making presents to all the King's attendants.</P>
<P>Sultan Shab ul dien, in his last expedition, savoured Taje ul
dien so much, that he bestowed upon him the black standard of the 
<PB N="174" REF="260"/> kingdom of Ghizni, by this intimating his will, that he
should succeed to that throne. But upon the death of that monarch, the
Turkish Omrahs were desirous that Sultan Yeas ul dien ben Sham should
come from Ghor and reign at Ghizni. Yeas ul dien being a man of an indolent
disposition declined it; and said that he was con∣tent with the throne of
his ancestors. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ascends the throne of Ghizni.</NOTE>He, however,
assumed the imperial title, proclaimed Taje ul dien King of Ghizni, and was
content to maintain the appearance of that power which he would not, or rather
durst not enforce.</P>
<P>The first thing Taje ul dien Eldoze did after his accession,
was to invade Punjab and Lahore, as we have seen in the former reign. He was
defeated by Cuttub ul dien Abiek, and in consequence lost his own kingdom,
which, however, he soon after recovered. He afterwards, in conjunction with
Sultan Yeas ul dien Mamood, sent an army to Herat, which they conquered, as
also a great part of Seistan, but making peace with the prince of that
country, they returned. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charizm Shaw takes Ghizni.</NOTE>On the way,
making war upon Charizm Shaw, they were both defeated, and the conqueror
pursuing his fortune, took Ghizni, while Eldoze retired to Kirma.</P>
<P>The Sultan finding the northern troops too hard for him, recruited
an army, and marched some time after the death of Cuttub ul dien Abiek, with
a view to conquer Hindostan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eldoze de∣feated and taken, dies.</NOTE>But, after
reducing some of the northern provinces, he was defeated near Delhi by Sultan
Shumsi ul dien, and being taken, died in confinement. The time of his reign
was nine years.</P>
<P>As we have already given the history of two of Shab ul dien's
slaves who arrived at the imperial dignity, it may not be improper here to
say something of Tughril, who raised himself from the same low
situation.</P>
<P> <PB N="175" REF="261"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tughril a brave and vir∣tuous Omrah.</NOTE>Tughril
was an Omrah of some repute in the service of Shab ul dien, brave, and of a
virtuous disposition. They relate, that when Shab ul dien Mahummud took the
fort of Biana, he gave the com∣mand of it to Tughril, and proceeded himself
to Gualier, as we have seen before. But after he left Hindostan, Tughril
continued to infest the country about Gualier; the King having told him at
his departure, that if he conquered the place, he would confirm him in the
government of it. When he found that this manner of war had no effect, as they
always found some opportunity of sup∣plying the place, he ordered small
forts to be built all round, which he garrisoned, and by this means the place
was effectually blockaded. Yet it held out for near a whole year, when being
distressed for pro∣visions, they sent an embassy privately to
Sultan Cuttub ul dien Abiek to come and take possession of the place,
for they had con∣ceived an implacable resentment against Tughril. The
Sultan ac∣cordingly sent his troops to seize upon Gualier; upon which, war
had almost ensued between him and Tughril. Death however in∣terfering, put
an end to the dispute; for at this juncture, Tughril suddenly expired. The
actions of the other two princes, formerly slaves to Shab ul dien, will be
seen in the history of Sind and Punjab, to which they more properly
belong.</P>

Altumsh was originally a nobleman of Chitta, whose father's name was Elim
Chan, a great and famous general. But in his youth, being the favourite of his
father, he was envied by the rest of his brothers. They therefore determined 
<PB N="177" REF="263"/> to get rid of him, and as they were out one day hunting,
they stript him, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is sold as a slave.</NOTE>and sold him to
a company of travelling merchants for a slave. The merchants carried him to
Bochara, and sold him to one of the relations of Sider Jehan prince of that
country, from whom he received a liberal education.</P>
<P>Upon the death of his master he was again exposed to sale, and
bought by a merchant, who sold him to another who carried him to Ghizni.
Mahummud Shaw heard at Ghizni of Altumsh's beauty and talents, but could not
agree with the merchant about his price. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Purchased by Cuttub ul dien.</NOTE>He was
therefore carried back to Bochara, as none durst buy him, on account of the
King's displeasure, till Sultan Cuttub ul dien Abiek ob∣taining his leave,
made that purchase at Delhi, whither he had invited the merchant, for fifty
thousand pieces of silver. Cuttub, at the same time, bought another
slave whom he called Tagage, and ap∣pointed him afterwards, governor of
Tibberhind, where he was slain in the battle between Cuttub ul dien and
Eldoze.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Altumsh a∣dopted by Cuttub.</NOTE>Altumsh, in
the mean time, was made master of the chace, and afterwards rose to such
favour, that he became the adopted son of his prince, Cuttub ul dien, and was
advanced to the government of Gualier and Birren, and from thence to the
viceroyship of Buda∣oon. He accompanied Cuttub in his war against the
Gickers, and greatly distinguished himself in bravery and zeal for the
service. He killed in one action, with the troops of Budaoon, upwards of ten
thousand of the enemy. This behaviour so pleased the King, that he
declared him free, and made him many honorary presents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Made captain general of the Empire.</NOTE>Thus by
degrees Altumsh rose, till he was created Amir ul Om∣rah, or captain
general of the empire; and married the daughter of Sultan Cuttub ul dien; and
upon his death, as we have before re∣lated, <PB N="178" REF="264"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1210. Higer. 607.</NOTE>he advanced
against the capital, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accedes to the throne,</NOTE>and expelling Aram

<P>Upon his accession he was acknowledged by many chiefs and
princes; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deserted by some Omrahs,</NOTE>but some of
his generals taking disgust, went off with the greater part of his
Turkish horse, which were the flower of his army. They joined themselves
with other malecontents, and ad∣vanced with a great force towards Delhi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeats them.</NOTE>They were met before the city
by Shumse ul dien and defeated, their chief general Firoch Shaw being killed,
and the rest so closely pursued, that in a short time they were all
either killed or taken, which for that time established Altumsh in peace.
But soon after the governor of the fort of Gollore, whose name was Avice,
rebelled and refused to pay the revenues of that country. This obliged the
King to march and reduce him to obedience. Sultan Eldoze of Ghizni, at this
time sent him the ensigns of royalty, pretending to confirm Altumsh in
the empire of Hindostan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeats and takes Sultan Eldoze.</NOTE>But soon
after, when Taje ul dien Eldoze himself was defeated by the troops of
Charizm, and retired to Kirma and Shenoran, he turned his views towards the
conquest of Hindostan. Eldoze seized upon the country of Punjaab and the
city of Tanna∣sar in the year 612, and endeavoured by his emissaries in
the court of Shumse ul dien, to raise a faction in his own favour. Sultan
Shumse ul dien, in the mean time, drew together his forces, and advancing
towards him, they sought on the confines of Tirowri, about seventy crores
from Delhi. Taje ul dien was defeated, as before related, and with many of his
Omrahs, taken and imprisoned in Budaoon, where he died a natural death,
according to some, but according to others, was poisoned.</P>

Chinaab, where Altumsh proved victorious. The go∣vernor of Chillige, the year
following, being defeated by Nasir ul dien, fled for protection to Altumsh,
who taking part in his quarrel, marched against Nasir ul dien, and a
second time overthrew him, recovering the countries lost by the Viceroy of
Chillige, upon which he himself returned to Delhi.</P>

news was brought that Cabaja had been obliged by Nizam ul Mulluck to attempt to

submitted to the imperial power. Altumsh then drew his forces towards the
fort of Rintimpore, which he be∣sieged and took.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduces Se∣walic.</NOTE>In the year 624, he

Chingez Chan, and took protection at Delhi, where he wrote many excellent

making a great festival, and distributing rich presents.</P>
<P>In the same year, he received intelligence of the death of Nasir

prisoner in the fort of Tiber∣hind, Byram Shaw, upon Monday the 27th of
Ramsan, in the year 637, by consent of the Omrahs, ascended the throne of
Delhi, and confirmed all the laws and customs then in force. Mal∣leck Achtiar
ul dien ab Tiggi, in conjunction with the vizier, Nizam ul Muluck, by degrees
took the whole government of the Empire upon himself, taking the sister
of the Emperor to wife, and mounting an elephant upon guard, at his gate, which
was an honour peculiar to royalty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disgusted with two factious
Om∣rahs.</NOTE>This circumstance raised disgust and jealousy in the
Emperor's mind. He therefore ordered two Turkish slaves to put on the
ap∣pearance of drunkenness, and endeavour to assassinate Malleck and
the vizier. Accordingly upon a certain day, these two Turks, when the King
gave public audience, pressed among the crowd, and began to be very
troublesome. Tiggi, who stood first in the rank of Omrahs, went to turn
them out. They drew their daggers, and plunged them into his breast, then,
running to the vizier, they gave him two wounds; but he escaped through the
crowd. The slaves were immediately seized, and thrown into chains, but in a
few days after they were pardoned.</P>
<P>The vizier kept his bed for some days, on account of his wounds,
but, as soon as he recovered, he appeared again at court, and offici∣ated in
his employ. Buddur ul dien Sunkir Rumi, who was then <PB N="188" REF="274"/>

scheme to supercede him. He, for this purpose, placed himself at the
head of a powerful faction at court, and collecting the Omrahs together, and,
among the rest, the vizier, at the house of Sudder ul Muluck, the chief
justice, he began to concert with them a plan to bring about a revolution in
the Empire. Sudder ul Muluck was secretly averse to the measure, and
fearing that what was nominally meant against the vizier, should actually
turn upon his master, he sent to the Emperor, and informed him of the whole
affair. Sudder's messenger brought back with him a faithful servant of
the King, in the habit of a fool, who might overhear the conversation with
the vizier. The vizier, though he actually entered into the measures of the
meeting, excused himself from attendance at that time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The conspi∣rators punish∣ed.</NOTE>The
story of Sudder being confirmed by the person whom the Emperor sent to
overhear the Omrahs, a body of cavalry were imme∣diately dispatched to
seize them; but they having had previous intel∣ligence, dispersed
themselves before the horse arrived. The next day Malleck Budir ul dien
Sunkur, who was one of the principal conspirators, was sent to be Suba of
Budaoon, while Casi Jellal ul dien Kashani was turned out of his office. In

Malleck ul dien Hassen Ghori, vakeel of the Empire, with other Omrahs, to
oppose the Moguls at Lahore with an army. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treachery of the vizier.</NOTE>When the imperial
army advanced as far as the river Bea, where the town of Sultanpoor now
stands, the vizier, who was privately an enemy to the Emperor, began to
depreciate his government to the Omrahs, and to sow the seeds of sedition
in their minds. But that he might compleatly effect his purpose, he wrote a
private letter to the Empe∣ror, accusing them of disaffection, and begging
he would either take the field himself, or send other Omrahs and more
forces, for that those now with the army could not be depended upon, and that
therefore nothing could be done against the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attaches the Omrahs to his interest.</NOTE>The
Emperor, though he had been forewarned of the treachery of his vizier in the
late conspiracy, yet the artful man had so well ex∣tricated himself, and
gained such confidence, that Byram Shaw, who was not blessed with much
discernment, gave entire credit to this accusation, and sent him an
order, importing, that they deserved death; at the same time recommending
to him to keep them quiet till he should find the means of bringing them to
condign punishment. This was what the crafty vizier wanted. He immediately
produced the King's order, which kindled the Omrahs at once into rage, while he
misled them with respect to the accuser. He even pretend∣ed to be
apprehensive for himself, and began to consult with them about the means
of general security; and they all promised to sup∣port him.</P>

till he was released by Musaood Shaw, who gave him the government of
Barage. During the time of his government he waged successful wars with the
neighbouring Rajas, and rendered his province happy and flourishing. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood a wise, learned, and politic

laying aside his birth, his bravery, wisdom and learning, his other good
qualiteis very much deserved to possess.</P>
<P>During the time of his imprisonment, he wrote for his livelihood,
despising the Emperor's allowance. He often said in the days of his
misfortune, that he who could not work for his bread did not de∣serve it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An encoura∣ger of learn∣ing.</NOTE>When he
ascended the throne, he was the patron of learn∣ing, the protector of the
people, and the friend of the poor. The poets of that age vied with one another
for the prize, at his corona∣tion, which was gained by Casi Minhage, for his
poem upon that occasion. This writer is also particularly famous for his
valuable history called the Tibcaat Nazari.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizarit conferred up∣on Balin.</NOTE>The
vizarit was now conferred upon Malleck Yeas ul dien Balin the younger, who
formerly, under the title of Chan Azim Anigh Chan, defeated the Sultana, and
all the executive power put into his hands. Shere Chan, the Emperor's nephew,
was appointed to the government of Lahore, Moultan, Batenize and Tibberhind,
where he was ordered to keep a great standing army, to watch the motions of
the Moguls, who now had possessed themselves of Cabul, Candahar,
Ghizni, Balich and Herat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emper∣or's charge to Balin.</NOTE>It is

trusted his own glory to his loyalty and conduct; <PB N="194" REF="280"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1246. Higer. 644.</NOTE>therefore, to do
nothing for which he could not answer to God, or that would stain his name
with injustice towards his people, or ingrati∣tude towards his king. The
vizier faithfully promised his best, and exerted himself with such
unwearied diligence in his office, re∣gulated so well the business of the
state, that nothing escaped his eye, or passed his particular
inspection.</P>
<P>In the month of Regib the King took the field, and turned his arms
towards Moultan. He encamped for some time upon the banks of the Sodra; and
making his vizier captain general, he sent him towards the mountains of
Jehud, and the territories of Sind. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gickers chastised.</NOTE>Those countries
were reduced, and the Emperor avenged himself upon the Gickers for their
continual incursions, and for guiding the Moguls through their country into
Hindostan. These offences were too great to be pardoned, and therefore he
carried some thousands of every age and sex into captivity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Refractory Omrahs pu∣nished.</NOTE>Some antient
Omrahs who had Jagiers conferred on them in the provinces of Lahore and
Moultan, had, for some time past, refused to supply their quotas to the
army, for the maintainance of which, they held these estates. By the advice
of the vizier, they were arrested and carried prisoners to Delhi. The King,
however, gave their Jagiers to their sons or relations, upon the old military
tenure. The country of Punjaab and Moultan were by these means effec∣tually
settled, and the King's authority firmly established.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Story of Alex∣an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the Great.</NOTE>Some authors inform us, that when Secunder<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Alexander the Great.</NOTE> was on his way to Hindostan,
some of his old generals, unwilling to proceed far∣ther, began to draw their
feet out of the circle of his obedience. The heroe upon this, was thrown into
great perplexity, not know∣ing how to proceed with them. In this dilemma he
sent a messen∣ger <PB N="195" REF="281"/>

advise with his old master Aristotalise<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, the Philosopher.</NOTE>, who, by reason of his
age and infirmities, could not accompany him. When the sage read the letter,
he carried the messenger into the garden, where he gave orders to the
gardener to root up all the old plants, and set young shoots in their
places. Without saying more, or writing any answer, he told the
messenger to return in haste to his master.</P>
<P>When the messenger arrived, he fell upon his face before the
King, and told him he could obtain no reply. Secunder was some∣what
surprized, and enquired into the particulars of the interview. Hearing the
above relation he smiled, and told the messenger he had brought him an
excellent answer. He accordingly put some of the old mutinous officers to
death, and cashiered others; supplying their places with young men who
became more obedient to command; and thus re-established his authority in
the army.</P>

then continued his march towards Kurrah, the vizier commanding the van guard.
He was met at Kurrah by the Rajas Dillekie and Milleckie, whom he defeated,
plundering their country, and taking many of both their families prisoners.
These two Rajas had seized upon all the country to the south of the
Jumna, destroyed the King's garrisons from Malava to Kurrah, and held their
chief residence at Callinger. After these exploits the Em∣peror returned to

desire blossomed in the hearts of the subjects.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrections quelled.</NOTE>In the year 653,
the Emperor conferred the government of Oud upon Cuttulich Chan, of which
however he wanted to deprive him in a few months, for that of Barage, which was
neither so lucrative, nor so honourable. Cuttulich Chan, upon this account,
swerved from his allegiance, and, having brought over some other Omrahs to
his party, raised a great army, which obliged the Sultan to send the vizier
against him. Malleck Taje ul dien, the Turk, was dispatched at the same
time against Amad ul dien, who had begun a diversion about Budaoon. He was
however soon defeated, taken prisoner, and put to death. Cuttulich Chan was
also routed by the Vizier, and fled to Sitnoor. The Vizier destroyed the
place, but not being able to lay hold of the rebel, he returned to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A conspiracy in the impe∣rial

alli∣ance with Cuttulich Chan, and, raising a great army, advanced to meet
Cutchlew Chan, Suba of Sind, who was in the same confederacy. All three
joining their forces near Koram, became very formidable <PB N="200" REF="286"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1257. Higer. 655.</NOTE>to the empire. The
King again ordered his Vizier, with a great army, to take the field. When the
two armies approached one ano∣ther, a mutiny was stirred up in the Vizier's
camp, by Shech Islam, Cuttub ul dien, and Casi Shumse ul dien Berachi,
who wrote private letters to the enemy, projecting the means of their taking
the city, in which they had also set a faction on foot to favour them. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">discovered and baffled by the Vizier.</NOTE>The
Vizier having received good intelligence of this treasonable
correspondence, acquainted the King of the particulars, who ordered them all
to be confined. In the mean time the enemy, according to the scheme
projected, marched with a body of chosen cavalry, a hundred crores, in two
days, advancing to the gates of Delhi, where the traitors had promised to
meet them that day with their forces; but finding them∣selves disappointed,
and the Sultan's troops marching out against them, they entirely
dispersed, Cutchlew Chan retreating to Sind, but Cuttulick Chan was never
heard of afterwards.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moguls obliged to re∣treat.</NOTE>Towards the
latter end of this year, a Mogul army invaded Outch and Moultan, which obliged
the Sultan to point his hostile spears to∣wards that quarter; but the
Moguls fled upon his approach; so that, without further trouble, he returned
to his capital, giving the coun∣try of Punjaab to Shere Chan, and sending
Malleck Jellal ul dien Chani to the government of Lucknouti.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disobedient Omrahs brought to
reason.</NOTE>In the year 656, the Sultan marched his army towards Kurrah and
Manickpoor, to chastise Arsilla Chan and Calliche Chan, who had not
joined their forces in obedience to his orders, when he marched the year before
to Punjaab. These Subas, however, found means at court to mollify the King's
resentment, and Arsilla Shaw found even interest to obtain the government
of Lucknouti, which had been so lately disposed of to Jellab ul dien,
while the other obtained some districts by the foot of the mountains.</P>

Chan, the Vizier's brother, was, in the year 657, appoint∣ed to the government
of Kole, Jellasore, Gualier, and Biana. No∣thing else remarkable happened
this season, but the death of Cushlu Chan, governor of Sind. The Vizier,
by the King's commands, led next year an army towards Sewalic and Rintimpore,
where the Rajaputs had begun to raise great disturbances, having collected
a very numerous body of horse and foot, at the head of which they plundered
and burnt the country. Upon the Vizier's approach, they retired into strong
posts and passes, among the mountains, where, however, he routed them,
and continued to ravage their country four months, with fire and sword,
setting a price upon their heads.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some rebelli∣ous Rajas overthrown by the
Vizier.</NOTE>The Rajas of the Rajaputs, rendered at length desperate,
collected all their forces, and rushed down from the mountains to be revenged
of the Mahomedans. The Vizier saw the storm descending, and had time to
draw up his army in order of battle to receive them. The attack of the enemy
was violent and terrible, being actuated by rage, revenge, and despair. It
was with much difficulty that the Vizier could keep the imperial troops in the
field, but the enemy over-heating themselves towards mid-day, they became
hourly more languid and faint. The imperial general inspiring his troops with
fresh courage, for till then, they had acted upon the defensive, began to
charge in his turn, and, before evening, pursued the enemy, with great
slaughter, back to the hills. The Vizier's loss was very considerable in
this action, and many brave Omrahs drank of the cup of martyrdom. Of the enemy
above ten thousand were slain, and ninety of their chiefs made prisoners,
besides a great number of com∣mon soldiers. The Vizier having, by this
action, relieved the fort of Rintimpore, which had been besieged by some
other tribes, he returned victorious to Delhi. The captive chiefs were cruelly
ordered to be put to death, and their unfortunate soldiers condemned to
perpetual slavery.</P>

thousand infantry in arms, two thousand chain-elephants of war, and three
thousand carriages of fire-works. He drew up in order of battle, formed in
columns of twenty deep, with the artillery and cavalry properly dis∣posed.
Having then exhibited some feats of horsemanship, in mock battles, and
fully displayed his pomp to the ambassador, he con∣ducted him into the
city and royal palace. There the court was very splendid, every thing being
set out in the most gorgeous and magnificent manner. All the Omrahs,
officers of state, judges, priests, and great men of the city were
present, besides five princes of Ayrac, Chorrasan, and Maverulnere, with
their retinues, who had taken protection at Delhi, from the arms of Chingez
Chan, who, a little before that time, had overun most part of Asia. Many

lamented by his people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His singular character.</NOTE>Sultan Mamood was
very singular in his private character, for, contra∣ry to the custom of all
princes, he kept no concubines. He had but one wife, whom he obliged to do
every homely part of housewifry; and when she complained one day, that
she had burnt her fingers in baking his bread, desiring he might allow her
a maid to assist her, he rejected her request, with saying, that he
was only a trustee for the <PB N="203" REF="289"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1265. Higer. 664.</NOTE>state, and that he
was determined not to burthen it with needless ex∣pences. He therefore
exhorted her to persevere in her duty with patience, and God would reward her
in the end.</P>
<P>As the Princes of Hindostan never eat in publick, his table was
rather that of a hermit, than suitable to a great King. He also continued
the whimsical notion of living by his pen. One day, as an Omrah was
inspecting a Coran of the Emperor's writing, before him, he pointed out a
word, which he said was wrong. The King, looking at it, smiled, and drew a
circle round it. But when the critic was gone, he began to eraze the circle,
and restore the word. This being ob∣served by one of his old attendants, he
begged to know his Majesty's reason for so doing; to which he replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he knew the word was originally right, but he
thought it better to erase from a paper, than touch the heart of a poor man,
by bringing him to shame."</Q> These might, indeed, be virtues in private
life, but were certainly none in a sovereign; for notwithstanding the
praises conferred upon him by historians, we must look upon him rather as
the representa∣tion than the real substance of a great monarch.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION X. The Reign of Sultan YEAS UL DIEN BALIN.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Balin, his family.</NOTE>SULTAN Balin was
a Turk of Chitta, of the tribe of Alberi, and, in his youth, was carried
prisoner by the Moguls, who conquered that country, and sold to a merchant,
who conveyed him to Bagdat. His father was a chief of great power, and
commanded ten thousand horse in that unfortunate war in which our young
hero was taken. He was bought at Bagdat in the year 630, by Chaja Jemmal ul
dien of Bussorah, who was then famous for his piety and 
<PB N="204" REF="290"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1265. Higer. 664.</NOTE>learning. His
master having learned that he was a relation of Sultan Altumsh, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sent to Delhi.</NOTE>proceeded with him
immediately to Delhi, and presented him to the Emperor, who rewarded him so
handsomely, that he re∣turned independent to Bagdat.</P>
<P>The Sultan employed him first in the office of chief falconer, in
which art he was very expert. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His gradual rise in the state.</NOTE>He rose
from that station, both by the influence of his brother, who happened to be
then an Omrah, and in great favour at the court of Delhi, and by his own merit.
He ascended gradually, from one preferment to another, till he became an
Omrah of the empire, and a man in great esteem. In the reign of Ruckun ul
dien, when he commanded in Punjaab, hearing his ene∣mies at court had enraged
the King against him, he refused to obey his orders to return, and kept for
some time possession of that coun∣try. But having advanced to Delhi,
with the confederate Omrahs, who came to depose the Empress Rizia, he was
taken prisoner in their flight, and remained there some time in
confinement. He however made his escape, and joined the party of Byram Shaw
against the Empress, whom he twice defeated, as we have seen in that
reign. This gained him great reputation; and he had the government of Hassi
and Rabari conferred upon him; in which office he distin∣guished himself
in several actions against the rebels of Mewat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Made Vi∣zier.</NOTE>In the reign of Sultan
Musaood, he was advanced to the dignity of Amir Hajib, in which he gained
great reputation; and in that of Nasir ul dien he was raised to the
Vizarit, which high office he managed in such a manner, as to leave the King
but the mere title of royalty. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Succeeds to the Empire.</NOTE>He therefore, upon
the death of his sovereign, mounted the throne, not only without
opposition, but even by the general voice of the no∣bility and people.</P>
<P>In the reign of Shumse ul dien Altumsh, forty of his Turkish
slaves, who were in great favour, entered into a solemn association 
<PB N="205" REF="291"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1265. Higer. 664.</NOTE>to support one
another, and upon the King's death, to divide the Empire among themselves.
But jealousies and dissentions having arose afterwards among them,
prevented this project from being executed. The Emperor Balin was of their
number; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rids himself of his rivals.</NOTE>and, as
se∣veral of them had raised themselves to great power in the kingdom, the
first thing he did after his accession, was to rid himself of all who
remained of that association, either by sword or poison; among whom was
a nephew of his own, Shere Chan, a man of great bra∣very and reputation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Courted by the Kings of Tartary and
Persia.</NOTE>His fears, after these assassinations, were entirely
dispelled, and he became so famous for his justice and wise government,
that his alliance was courted by all the Kings of Iran and Turan. He took
particular care that none but men of merit and family should be admitted to
any office in his government; and for this purpose he endeavoured to make
himself acquainted with the particular talents and connections of every
person in his court. As he was very assi∣duous in rewarding merit, he was
no less so in punishing vice; for whoever misbehaved in their
station, were certain of being imme∣diately disgraced.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An enemy to vice.</NOTE>He expelled all
flatterers, usurers, pimps and players from his court; and being one day
told, that an Omrah, an old servant of the crown, who had acquired a vast
fortune, by usury and monopoly in the Bazar, would present him with some
lacks of Rupees, if he would honour him with one word from the throne; he
rejected the proposal with great disdain, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"what must his subjects think of a King who
should condescend to hold discourse with a wretch so
infamous?"</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His genero∣sity,</NOTE>Balin was so famous
for his generosity, that all the princes of the East, who had been
overthrown by the arms of Chingez Chan, <PB N="206" REF="292"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1265. Higer. 664.</NOTE>sought protection
at his court. There came upwards of twenty of those unfortunate sovereigns
from Turkestan, Mavir ul Nere, Chor∣rassan, Ayrac, Azurbaejan, Pharis,
Room<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lesser Asia, so called from being long
a part of the Roman Empire.</NOTE>, and Shaam<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Syria.</NOTE>. They had a princely allowance, and palaces for
their residence allotted them; and they were upon public occasions, ranked
before his throne, ac∣cording to their dignity; all standing to the right and
left, except two princes of the Kalifat, who were permitted to sit on either
side of the Musnud. The palaces in which the royal fugitives resided in
Delhi, took their names from their respective possessors, and were
ranked in the following order: Abbassi, Singeri, Charizm Shahi, Willami,
Ollavi, Attabuki, Ghori, Chingezi, Roomi, Aesunkari, Emuni, Museli,
Samarcandi, Cashgari, and Chittai.</P>
<P>In the retinue of those princes, were the most famous men for
learning, war, arts and sciences, that Asia at that time produced. The
court of Hindostan was therefore, in the days of Balin, reckoned the most
polite and magnificent in the world. All the philosophers, poets and divines,
formed a society every night, at the house of Chan Shehîd, the heir
apparent of the Empire; and Amir Chusero the poet presided at those
meetings. Another society of musicians, dancers, mimicks, players,
buffoons, and story∣tellers was constantly convened at the house of the
Emperor's second son Kera Chan, who was given to pleasure and levity. The
Omrahs followed the examples of their superiors, so that various
societies and clubs were formed in every quarter of the city. The Sultan
himself, having a great passion for splendor and magnificence in his
palaces, equipages and liveries, he was imitated by the court. A new city
seemed to lift up its head, and arts to arise from the bosoms of luxury
and expence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and magnifi∣cence,</NOTE>Such was the pomp and
grandeur of the royal presence, that none could approach the throne without
terror. The ceremonies of intro∣duction <PB N="207" REF="293"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1265. Higer. 664.</NOTE>were conducted with
so much reverence and solemnity, and every thing disposed so as to
strike awe and astonishment into the beholders. Nor was Balin less
magnificent in his cavalcades. His state elephants were caparisoned in
purple and gold. His horse-guards, consisting of a thousand noble Turks
in splendid armour, were mounted upon the finest Persian steeds, with
bridles of silver, and saddles of rich embroidery. Five hundred chosen
men in rich livery, with their drawn swords upon their shoulders, ran
pro∣claiming his approach, and clearing the way before him. All the Omrahs
followed according to their rank, with their various equi∣pages and attendants.
The Monarch, in short, seldom went out with less than one hundred
thousand men; which he used to say, was not to gratify any vanity in
himself, but to exalt him in the eyes of the people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His justice.</NOTE>The festivals of Norose
and Ide, as also the anniversary of his own birth, were held with wonderful
pomp and splendor. But amidst all this glare of royalty, he never forgot
that he was the guar∣dian of the laws, and protector of his meanest
subjects. It was be∣fore Balin's time a custom in Hindostan, in cases
of murder, to satisfy the relations by a certain fine, if they consented to
accept of it. He abolished this custom, which has been since revived, and
ordered the Suba of Budaoon, Malleck Feick, to be put to death upon the
complaint of a poor woman for killing her son.</P>
<P>When Balin was only an Omrah, he gave into the then courtly vices of
wine, women, and play. But upon his accession he be∣came a great enemy to
all those luxuries; prohibiting wine upon the severest penalties to be
drank in his dominions; laying great restric∣tions upon women of pleasure,
and banishing all gamesters from his court.</P>
<P>So zealous was Balin to support his authority, that for the
diso∣bedience of one man, he would order a force to the remotest parts 
<PB N="208" REF="294"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1265. Higer. 664.</NOTE>of the empire to
bring him to punishment. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His severity to rebels.</NOTE>In cases of
insurrection or rebellion against his government, he was not content, as
had formerly been the custom, to chastise the leaders, but he extended
the capital punishment of high treason to the meanest of their
vassals and adherents. This severity rendered it necessary for the
Subas to have the King's mandate for every expedition or hostilities they
were about to commence.</P>
<P>That his army might be kept in constant exercise, he led them
out twice every week to hunt, for forty or fifty miles round the city, and
established laws for the preservation of the game. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejects the advice of his council to re∣duce
Malava.</NOTE>In the year 664, he was advised by his council, to undertake an
expedition to reduce the kingdoms of Guzerat and Malava, which had been
an∣nexed to the empire by Cuttub ul dien, but were afterwards per∣mitted to
shake off the yoke. To this advice the Emperor would by no means consent,
saying, that the Moguls were become so powerful in the north, having
conquered all the Mussulmen princes, that he thought it would be much
wiser to secure what he possessed against those invaders, than
to weaken himself, and leave his country unguarded, by foreign wars.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tatar Chan reduced.</NOTE>Mahummud Tatar Chan,
the son of Arsilla Chan, who had be∣gun to assert independence in
Lucknouti, was this year, however, reduced, and obliged to send his usual
tribute to Delhi. A great rejoicing was made upon this occasion, at which the
King was pre∣sent and gave public audience.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mewats extirpated.</NOTE>Balin ordered, in
the course of the same year, an army to extirpate a certain tribe of
banditti called Mewats, who had possessed them∣selves of an
extensive wilderness about eighty miles south east of the city towards
the hills; from whence they used, in former reigns, to make incursions, to
the number of fifty thousand, even to the gates <PB N="209" REF="295"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1266. Higer. 665.</NOTE>of Delhi. It is
said, that in this expedition, above one hundred thousand of these
wretches were put to the sword; and the army being supplied with hatchets
and other implements, cleared away the woods for above the circumference of
fifty crores. The cleared space, afterwards proved excellent lands, and was
well inhabited, as the people were protected by a line of forts along the foot
of the mountains.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emperor quells several
insurrections.</NOTE>In the 665 year of the Higera, Balin sent an army down
between the Ganges and Jumna, to suppress some insurrections in those
parts, with orders to punish the offenders without mercy. The Sultan soon
after marched in person towards Kattal, Pattiali and Bhogepoor, whose
inhabitants had begun to stop all intercourse with Bengal, by the way of
Jionpoor and Benaris. He put some thousands of them to death,
establishing justice and public security in those parts. He ordered
forts to be built, which he garrisoned with Pattans, to crush any future
disturbance, and then returned towards Delhi. Soon after his arrival, he
received intelligence of an insurrection in Budaoon and Kutter, whither he
hastened with five thousand chosen horse, and ordered a general
massacre among the unfortunate insurgents, and some thousands of
every age and sex fell by the sword.</P>
<P>If such cruelties can be any where excused, it must be in a
govern∣ment like that of Hindostan, where rebellions were in those days
so common, that, without the most vigorous measures, the peace and royal
authority could not be at all established.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduces Jehud.</NOTE>Balin, after these
transactions, marched his army towards the mountains of Jehud, where he
employed them for the space of two years, in taking sorts, and reducing the
wild inhabitants to obedi∣ence. This country was famous for breeding horses,
many thou∣sands of which were carried by the Sultan to Delhi. Wherever the 
<PB N="210" REF="296"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1266. Higer. 665.</NOTE>King marched there
was an order for the Subas, Zemindars, Foge∣dars and magistrates of the
provinces to meet him on their own frontiers, with their offerings, which was
afterwards distributed among the poor. The Sultan, some time after, made a
journey to Lahore, which city, having greatly suffered from the Moguls, he
ordered to be put in a proper state of defence and repair; and after having
erected some public buildings, he returned to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Regulates the army.</NOTE>About this time, Balin
was told by one of his Omrahs, that a great number of veterans, who had
served in the preceding reigns, were now become invalids and incapable of
attending their duty. The Sultan, upon this, ordered a list of their names to
be taken, and settling half pay upon them for life, discharged them from
fur∣ther service. The old men however, were dissatisfied with this
provision, and some of the principals of them were deputed by the rest,
to go to Malleck ul Omrah, Fuchur ul dien, chief magistrate of Delhi, with
presents, to represent their case to the King.</P>
<P>This venerable magistrate being in great favour with the Sultan,
rejected their presents, but told them he would use his endeavour to get
them continued upon full pay. He accordingly went next day to court, and while
he stood in the presence, put on the appearance of sorrow, which being
observed by the King, he enquired about the cause of his grief. The old man
replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"I was just thinking that if in the presence of
God, all the old men were rejected, what would become of me."</Q> The King was
struck with the reproof, and after some pensive silence, ordered the
veterans to be continued in their usual pay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shere Chan dies.</NOTE>In the fourth year of the
reign of Balin, Shere Chan Chaja Tash, who had, from the time of Nasir ul
dien, governed the provinces of Lahore, Moultan, Battize, Tibberhind, Debalpoor
and other dis∣tricts, <PB N="211" REF="297"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1268. Higer. 667.</NOTE>died: Some say, by
poison from the King, but this is not now believed, though reported by some
malicious people in those days. He was esteemed a man of great genius and
an intrepid warrior; having defended his country from the incursions of the
Moguls, who now became the terror of the East. Sultan Balin, upon the
demise of Shere Chan, gave Sunnam and Semana to Timur Chan, and the other
countries were divided among other Omrahs of his court. The moguls, encouraged
by the death of Shere Chan, began again their depredations in those
provinces. The mutual jealousies and dissensions among the Subas,
prevented them from doing any thing effectual for the public good.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahummud appointed go∣vernor of the
frontiers;</NOTE>The Emperor, therefore, was obliged to appoint his eldest
son Mahummud, at that time bearing the title of Chan Malleck, afterwards
famous by the name of Chan Shehid, viceroy of all those frontier provinces.
Mahummud was immediately dis∣patched to his government with a fine army, and
some of the wisest and best generals in the empire. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">an encourager of learning.</NOTE>The Prince
himself was blest with a bright and comprehensive genius, taking great
delight in learning and the company of learned men. He with his own hand, made
a choice collection of the beauties of poetry, se∣lected from the most
famous in that art. The work consisted of twenty thousand couplets, and
was esteemed the criterion of taste. Among the learned men in the Prince's
court, Amir Chusero and Chaja Hassen bore the first rank in genius and
in his esteem. These, with many more of his philosophical society,
accompanied him on this expedition to Lahore.</P>
<P>Mahummud was visited at Lahore by Shech Osman Marindi, who was
esteemed the greatest man of that age. But no presents or entreaty could
prevail upon him to remain out of his own country; so that after a short
stay, he returned. We are told, that as he was <PB N="212" REF="298"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1268. Higer. 667.</NOTE>one day reading one
of his poems in Arabic before the Prince, all the poets who were present,
were transported into a fit of dancing. But the piece affected the Prince, to
all appearance, in a quite con∣trary manner; for the tears began to flow fast
down his cheeks. This might indeed be occasioned by excess of pleasure,
though it was, at that time, attributed to that noble emulation which grieves
for that excellence to which it cannot attain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He invites the famous poet Sadi to his
court.</NOTE>The fame of Shech Sadi of Schiraz being great at that time,
Ma∣hummud invited him twice to his court; but that renowned sage excused
himself upon account of his years, and, with much diffi∣culty, was brought to
accept of some presents. Sadi, in return, sent to Mahummud a copy of his
works, and did honour to the abilities of Amir Chusero the Sultan's
favourite, and president of his learned society.</P>
<P>The Prince, every year, made a journey to see his father at Delhi,
to whom he always behaved with the greatest filial affection and duty. Sultan
Balin gave his younger son Baghera Chan, entitled Nasir ul dien, a Jagier
of Sammana and Sunnam, whither the Prince set out to reside. His father, at
his departure, advised him to re∣cruit and discipline a good army, to watch
the motions of the Mo∣guls; and that if he ever should hear of his giving
himself up to wine and his former debaucheries, he would certainly withdraw
him from that Subaship, and never put confidence in him again. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baghera, the Sultan's younger son, reforms his
manners.</NOTE>The Prince took the advice of his father to heart, and entirely
reform∣ing his manners, gave great proofs of his natural abilities, though his
mind had taken a wrong biass in his youth. A place of ren∣dezvouz was
appointed, in case of an invasion from the north, on the river Bea, near
Lahore, where the two Princes were to join the imperial army from Delhi.</P>

perfect peace and security throughout the empire, when Tughril, who was
intrusted with the government of Lucknouti, began to appear in arms. In the
year 678, this bold and enterprizing man led an army against the Rajas
towards Jage∣nagur, whom he defeated, carrying off some hundreds of elephants
and much wealth, out of which he made no acknowledgment to the King. Balin
happened at that time to be very sick, insomuch that the news of his death
was spread abroad. This intelligence having reached the ears of Tughril, he
assumed the red umbrella with all the royal dig∣nities, and declared
himself King of Bengal. Balin hearing of this, wrote him an order to return
immediately to his allegiance, which having produced no effect, he commanded Ab
Tiggi, Suba of Oud, to raise his forces, and declaring him Suba of Bengal,
sent Timar Chan Shumshi, Malleck Taje ul dien, Jemmal ul dien, and other

proceeded towards Lucknouti, whence Tughril advanced with his forces to meet
him. Tughril employed his money so well among the troops of Ab Tiggi, that he
drew ma∣ny of the Turkish chiefs over to his party, and then engaging the
imperial army, he gave them a total defeat. The Sultan hearing this news, bit
his own flesh with indignation. He ordered ab Tiggi to be hanged at the gate
of Oud; and dispatched Turmutti, a Tur∣kish general, with another army
against the rebel. Nor was the fate of Turmutti more fortunate than that of
his predecessor. He was totally routed, and lost all his baggage and the
public treasure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan prepares to march against him in

his arms, was in great affliction, and prepared to take the field in person.
He gave orders to build a large fleet of boats, with all expedition, to

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1279. Higer. 678.</NOTE>carry his baggage
down the river. He, in the mean time, under pretence of going upon a hunting
party, went to Sunnam and Samana, the Subaship of his younger son, whom he
brought with his army with him to Delhi, leaving Malleck Sotch in the
government. Hav∣ing collected the imperial army, he appointed Malleck ul Omrah,
Fuchier ul dien, or chief magistrate of the city, regent during his own
absence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He enters Bengal.</NOTE>The Emperor crossing
the Ganges, without waiting for the dry season, proceeded to Lucknouti by
forced marches. But having met with great delay, on account of the roads, and
numerous rivers, Tughril heard of his approach, and had time to collect his
army, and with all his elephants, treasure and effects, took the rout of
Jagena∣gur<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A town in Orissa, near
Cattack.</NOTE>, with intention to remain there till the Sultan should return
to Delhi. The Sultan having arrived in Lucknouti, remained there only a few
days. He appointed Hissam ul dien Barbek, governor of the province, and
proceeded himself, with his army, towards Jagena∣gur. At Sunnargaum, the
zemindar of that place, Hunnage Rai, joined him with his troops, and promised
to guard the river against Tughril, if he should endeavour to escape that
way.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Persues the rebels into Orissa.</NOTE>The
Sultan continued his march with great expedition, but he could gain no
intelligence of the enemy. He therefore ordered Malleck Barbek beg Birse,
with seven thousand chosen horse, to ad∣vance ten or twelve crores, in
front of the army, and, by all means, to endeavour to gain intelligence of the
rebels; but in spite of all enquiry, no satisfactory accounts could for
several days be obtained. One day however, Malleck Mahummud Shir, governor of
Kole, be∣ing out from the advanced guard with forty horse, reconnoitring the
country, beheld some bullocks with pack-saddles, and having seized the
drivers, began to enquire about the enemy. They obstinately 
<PB N="215" REF="301"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1279. Higer. 678.</NOTE>pretended ignorance;
but the head of one of them being struck off, the rest fell upon their
faces, and confessed that they had just left the enemy's camp, which was
about two crores in front, that they had halted for that day, and intended to
advance to Jagenagur.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A gallant ex∣ploit of Ma∣hummud
Shir.</NOTE>Mahummud Shir sent the drivers to Malleck Barbek Birse, who
commanded the vanguard, that he might examine them, and pro∣ceeded himself as
directed, to reconnoitre the enemy's camp. He saw, from a rising ground,
the whole encampment, extended over a great plain, with the elephants and
cavalry picqueted, and every thing in rest and security. Having fixed his
eye upon the rebel's tents, which were pitched in the center of the army, he
determined to execute one of the boldest enterprizes perhaps ever attempted.
He advanced on full speed, with his forty attendants, whom he fired with the
glory of the undertaking, towards the camp, which he was permitted to enter,
being taken for one of their own parties. He continued his course to the
usurper's tents, and then ordered his men to draw; and rushing into the
great tent of audience, which was crowded with men of distinction, put all
they met to the sword, crying, 
<Q REND="inline">"Victory to Sultan Balin!"</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tughril flies,</NOTE>Tughril, who imagined he was
surprized by the imperial army, started from his throne in confusion, and
cut his way through the tent behind. He mounted a horse without a saddle,
and the cry having now spread through the camp, he was confirmed in his
fears, and fled towards the river, with an intention to cross it, that he
might make his escape to Jagenagur. In the mean time, Malleck Makuddur, the
brother of the gallant Mahummud Shir, having seen the rebel as he fled,
pursued him to the river, and shot him with an arrow as he was
crossing. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and is killed.</NOTE>Tughril immediately fell from
his horse, and Malleck plunging into the stream, dragged him out by the
hair, and cut off his head. At that very instant seeing some of the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1279. Higer. 678.</NOTE>coming that way, he
hid the head in the sand, and sending the body down the stream, begun to
bath himself in the river. The party questioned him about their King, and
then went off without suspicion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His army fly.</NOTE>Mahummud's party, in the mean
time, having dispatched every body they found in the royal tents,
dispersed themselves in such a manner among the enemy, who were now in
the greatest confusion, that most of them escaped in the crowd. Tughril
being no where to be found, and the panic having run through the whole army,
the flight became general, and none thought about any thing but personal
safety. Those who remained alive of the forty heroes, loitered in the rear,
till the enemy were quite gone off the field. They then returned to the
deserted camp, where they chanced to meet Mal∣leck Mukuddur. He related the
King's death to his brother, who instantly sent the head to the Sultan. He
at the same time dispatch∣ed an express to the vanguard, which came up
that night, and took possession of the camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan reprimands Mahummud for his

<P>The Sultan was absent upon this expedition three years. Upon his
arrival, he conferred great dignities upon Malleck Fuchier ul dien, who had
ruled Delhi with great wisdom. He then visited the learn∣ed men at their
own houses, made them princely presents, and at their instigation,
published an act of grace to all insolvent debtors, who were in
confinement, striking off, at the same time, all old bal∣lances of revenues
due to the crown. Notwithstanding this appear∣ance of humanity, either the
policy, or natural cruelty of his dis∣position, rendered him unmerciful to
all rebels. He ordered spits to be erected in the market place, for the
execution of all the prisoners taken in the late expedition; and it was with
the utmost difficulty, that the Casies, Mufties, and learned men, in a body
petitioning their pardon, could obtain it. This venerable body at last,
softened the Sultan into mercy, and he drew the pen of forgiveness over
their crimes.</P>

inseparable, when news was brought that the Moguls had invaded Moultan.
Mahummud hastened his departure to oppose them; but before he had taken
leave, his father called him into a private apartment, and accosted him in
the following manner.</P>
<P>He told him, 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE PLACE="marg">His father's a vice to
Mahummud.</NOTE>"That he himself had spent a long life in the
admini∣stration and government of kingdoms; that, by study and experience, 
<PB N="218" REF="304"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1282. Higer. 681.</NOTE>he had acquired
some knowledge, which might be of service to Ma∣hummud after his death,
which, in the course of nature, now hastened apace. That therefore he
desired he would lend him the ear of attention, and treasure up his maxims
in his mind. 
<P>When you shall ascend the throne, look upon yourself as
the depu∣ty of God. Have a just sense of the importance of your charge.
Permit not any meanness of behaviour in yourself, to fully the lustre of
your exalted station, nor let avaritious and low-minded men, share your
esteem, or bear any part in your administration.</P> 
<P>Let your passions be governed by reason, and beware of
giving way to your rage. Anger is dangerous in all men; but in Kings it is the
weapon of death.</P> 
<P>Let the public treasure be expended in the service of the
state, with that prudent oeconomy, yet benevolent liberality, which reason
will dictate to a mind always intent on doing good.</P> 
<P>Let the worship of God be inculcated by your example, and
never permit vice and infidelity, unpunished, to hold up their face to the
day.</P> 
<P>Be ever attentive to the business of the state, that you
may avoid the imposition of designing ministers. Make it your study to
see them execute your commands, without the least deviation or neglect, for
it is by them you must govern your people.</P> 
<P>Let your judges and magistrates be men of capacity, religion,
and virtue, that the light of justice may illuminate your realms. Let no
light behaviour, in public or private, detract from that important ma∣jesty
which exalts the idea of a King; and let every thing around you be so
regulated, as to inspire that reverence and awe which will tender your
person sacred, and contribute to enforce your commands.</P> 
<P> <PB N="219" REF="305"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1282. Higer. 681.</NOTE>Spare no pains
to find men of genius, learning, and courage. You must cherish them by your
beneficence, that they may prove the soul of your council, and the sword of
your power.</P> 
<P>Throw not down a great man to the ground for a small crime,
nor entirely overlook his offence. Raise not a low man too hastily to a
high station, lest he forget himself, and be an eyesore to men of
supe∣rior merit.</P> 
<P>Never attempt any thing, unless it is through necessity,
but what you are sure to accomplish; and having once determined upon a
mea∣sure, let your perseverance be never shaken by doubt, nor your eye
ever deviate from the object. For it is better for a King to be obsti∣nate
than pusillanimous, as in the first case he may chance to be right, in
the latter he is always sure to be wrong. Nothing more certainly indicates
the weakness of a prince, than a fluctuating mind.</P> </Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahummud marches against the Moguls.</NOTE>The
Sultan having ended his instructions, embraced his son ten∣derly, and
parted with him in tears. The Prince immediately marched against the enemy,
and having defeated and slain Mahummud Chan, chief of the Moguls, he
recovered all the territories of which they had possessed themselves
in the empire.</P>
<P>The throne of Iran was at this time filled by Argunu Chan, the son
of Eback Chan, and grandson of Hallaku Chan, who had con∣quered that empire
about the year 656.

Chingezi, who was then an Omrah of mighty renown in the empire of the race of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1283. Higer. 682.</NOTE>Lahore, he turned
towards Moultan. Mahummud Sultan, who was then in Moultan, hearing of his
designs, hastened to the banks of the river of Lahore, which runs through
part of Moultan, and pre∣pared to oppose him. When Timur Chan advanced to the
river, he saw the army of Hindostan on the opposite bank. But the prince,
desirous of engaging so great a chief upon equal terms, permitted Timur
Chan to pass the river unmolested.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and are de∣feated by Mahummud,</NOTE>Both armies
then drew up in order of battle, and engaged with great fury, for the space
of three hours, in which both commanders eminently distinguished their
valour and conduct. The Moguls were at last put to flight, and the Omrahs of
Hind pursued them with imprudent disorder. Mahummud, fatigued by the
pursuit, halted by a large pond of water, with five hundred attendants, to
drink. He there fell prostrate upon the ground, to return God thanks for his
victory.</P>

horse, in a neighbouring wood, rushed out upon Mahummud, and began a
dreadful slaughter. The prince had just time to mount his horse, and,
collecting his small party, and encou∣raging them by his example, fell upon
his enemies. He was at last overpowered by numbers, after having thrice
obliged them to give ground, and he unfortunately received a fatal arrow in his
breast, by which he fell to the ground, and in a few minutes expired. A body
of the troops of Hind appearing at that instant, the Moguls took to flight.
Very few of the unfortunate Mahummud's party escaped from this conflict.
Among the fortunate few, was Amir Chusero, the poet, who relates this event
at large, in his book called Chizer Chani.</P>
<P>When the army returned from the pursuit of Timur Chan, and beheld
their prince in his blood, the shouts of victory were changed

woe. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The grief of the army for the death of the
Prince.</NOTE>No dry eye was to be seen from the mean∣est soldier to the
Omrah of high command. The fatal news reached the old Sultan, who was now in
his eightieth year. The fountains of his tears were exhausted, and life
became obnoxious to his sight. However, bearing himself up against the
stream of misfortune, he sent Kei Chusero his grandson, and the son
of the deceased, to sup∣ply the place of his father. Kei Chusero, upon
his arrival at Moul∣tan, took the command of the army, and pouring the balm of
bene∣volence and kindness upon the wounds of his afflicted people, began to
adjust his government, and provide for the defence of his frontiers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan worn out with age, sends for his
son Baghera to succeed him.</NOTE>When the Sultan found grief and
infirmities began to conquer his vital strength, he sent for his son
Baghera Chan from Lucknouti, and appointed him his successor, at the
same time insisting that he should continue with him at Delhi till his
death; and appoint a deputy for his government of Lucknouti. To this Baghera
Chan consented; but finding his father's illness was not likely to come
soon to a crisis, he set out for Lucknouti without acquainting him of his
departure. This undutiful behaviour in his son, threw the old man into the
deepest affliction, so that death began now to press hard upon him.</P>
<P>He in the mean time sent for his grandson Kei Chusero, from
Moultan: the Prince hastened to his presence, and a council of all the
Omrahs being called, the succession was changed in his favour, all of
them promising to enforce the Sultan's last will, in favour of this young
Prince.

with the father of Chusero, harrangued them upon the present posture of
affairs. He assured them that Kei Chusero was a young man of a very
violent and untractable disposition, and therefore, in his opinion, unfit
to reign; besides, that the power of Baghera Chan was so great in the
empire, that a civil war was to be feared if the succession should not
be continued in his family. That therefore, as the father was absent, it
would be most prudent for the Omrahs to elect his son Kei Kubad, who was a
prince of a mild disposition and then present in Delhi.

<HEAD>SECTION XI. The Reign of Sultan MOAZ UL DIEN KEI KUBAD, ben
Bughera Chan, ben Sultan Yeas ul dien Balin.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kei Kubad.</NOTE>WHEN Sultan Balin was numbered
with the dead, Kei Kubad his grandson, in his eighteenth year, ascended the
throne, and assumed the title of Moaz ul dien. He was a prince remarkably
handsome in his person, and of an affable and mild disposition. He had
a talent for literature, and his knowledge that <PB N="223" REF="309"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1286. Higer. 685.</NOTE>way was pretty
extensive. His mother was a beautiful princess, daughter to Nasir ul dien
Altumsh; and if purity of blood royal is of any real worth, Kei Kubad had
that to boast, for a series of generations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luxury pre∣vails at Delhi.</NOTE>As he had been
bred up with great strictness under the wings of his father, when he became
master of his own actions he began to give a loose to pleasure without
restraint. He delighted in love, and in the soft society of silver
bodied damsels with musky tresses, spent great part of his time. When
it was publickly known that the King was a man of pleasure, it became
immediately fashionable at court; and in short, in a few days, luxury and
vice so prevailed that every shade was filled with ladies of pleasure,
and every street rung with musick and mirth. Even the magistrates were
seen drunk in public, and riot was heard in every house.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kei Kubad gives himself up to
pleasure.</NOTE>The Sultan built a palace at Kilogurry upon the banks of the
river Gion, and retired thither to enjoy his pleasures undisturbed;
ad∣mitting no company but singers, players, musicians and buffoons. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malleck Ni∣zam manages public
affairs.</NOTE>Malleck Nizam ul dien, who was nephew and son in law to Fuchir
ul dien, entering into the King's humours, gained great favour, and was
raised to the dignity of Vakeel Sultanit, and got the reins of government in
his hands; and Kuaam ul dien Ellaka, who was the greatest man of that age,
was appointed his deputy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affaires to the throne.</NOTE>Malleck Nizam ul
dien, seeing that the king was quite swallowed up in his pleasures, began
to form schemes to clear his own way to the Empire. The first object of his
attention was Kei Chusero, who was now gone to Ghizni, to endeavour to bring
Timur Chan over to his party, in order to recover the throne of Delhi; to which
he claimed a title from his father's right of primogeniture, as well as 
<PB N="224" REF="310"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1286. Higer. 685.</NOTE>from the will of the
last Sultan. But in this scheme Chusero did not succeed, and he was
obliged to return from Ghizni in great disgust.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Nizam ul dien endeavoured to make him as obnoxious
as possible to the King, who was at length prevailed upon to entice
Chusero to Delhi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murders Kei Chusero.</NOTE>Nizam hired
assassins to murder the un∣fortunate prince on the way, which they
accomplished at the vilage of Hicke. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His many villainies.</NOTE>The villainies of Nizam
did not stop here. He forged a correspondence between Chaja Chatire the
vizier, and Kei Chusero, and thus effected that minister's disgrace and
banishment. He also privately assassinated all the old servants
of Sultan Balin, insomuch that a general consternation was spread through
the city, though none as yet suspected Nizam as the cause. The more he
succeeded in his villainies, he became less secret in the execution; and
though he began to be detested by all ranks, his power and influence was so
great with the King, that he was the terror of every man.</P>
<P>While things were in this situation, advices arrived of another
invasion of Moguls into the districts of Lahore. Malleck Barbeck beg
Birse and Chan Jehan were sent with an army against them. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moguls defeated.</NOTE>The Moguls were
defeated near Lahore, and a number of prisoners brought to Delhi. The next
step the traitor took, was to inspire the King with jealousy of his Mogul
troops, who, as soldiers of for∣tune, had enlisted in great numbers in his
service. He pretended that in case of a Mogul invasion, they would
certainly join their countrymen against him, insinuating at the same
time, that he be∣lieved there was already some treachery intended.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kei Kubad massacres the Moguls in his
service.</NOTE>The weak prince listened to those villainous intimations,
and, calling their chiefs one day together, he ordered them to be set upon by
his guards and massacred; confiscating, at the same time, all their 
<PB N="225" REF="311"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1288. Higer. 687.</NOTE>goods and wealth. He
seized upon all the Omrahs who had any connections with the Moguls, and
sent them prisoners to distant gar∣risons in the remotest parts of
the empire. So blind was Kei Kubad to his own ruin, and so infatuated by this
deceitful minister, that when any of his father's friends, or well wishers
to himself and the state, made any complaints against the traitor, he
immediately called for Nizam himself, and smiling, told him, that such a
person had been doing him such and such ill offices, with an intention to
alien∣ate his affections from him. The person who preferred the com∣plaint
became, by this means, a sacrifice, while fear prevented others from falling
martyrs to virtue and honesty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The minister carries all be∣fore
him.</NOTE>When Nizam thus carried all before him in the Durbar, his wife was
no less busy in the Haram. She had all the ladies at her devo∣tion; and, by
way of particular respect, was called the King's mo∣ther. Malleck ul Omrah
Fuchir ul dien Cutwal, who had now reached his ninetieth year, perceived the
design of the treacherous minister, and called him to his house, and by
various arguments, endeavoured to suppress his ambitious schemes, and to
lay the de∣formity of such behaviour fully open to his view. The minister
allowed the justice of his reasoning, and affirmed that he had no further
intentions than to secure himself in the King's favour. That having,
unfortunately, disobliged so many people, it was dangerous for him to
permit his authority to decline.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Baghera Chan the Sultan's father, who had
contented himself with the kingdom of Bengal, having heard how matters went
on at the court of Delhi, penetrated into the designs of the minister, and
wrote a long letter to his son forewarning him of his danger, and advising
him how to proceed. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baghera Chan's advice to his son is
slighted.</NOTE>But his advice, like that of others, was of no weight with
that vicious, luxurious, and infatuated Prince. When Baghera found that his
instructions were <PB N="226" REF="312"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1288. Higer. 687.</NOTE>slighted, and that
things would soon be brought to a disagreeable issue, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches to∣wards Delhi.</NOTE>he collected a great
army and directed his standards towards Delhi, about two years after the
death of Balin. Sultan Kei Kubad hearing that his father had advanced as far as
Behar, drew out his forces and marched down to meet him, encamping his army
upon the banks of the Gagera. Baghera Chan lay upon the Sirve, and both armies
remained some days in hourly expectation of an action. The old man finding
his army much inferiour to that of his son, began to despair of reducing
him by force, and accordingly began to treat of peace.</P>
<P>The young Prince, upon this, became more haughty, and by the advice
of his favourite prepared for battle. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A conference proposed be∣tween the fa∣ther and
son.</NOTE>In the mean time, a letter arrived from his father, wrote in the
most tender and affec∣tionate terms, begging he might be blessed with one
sight of him before matters were carried to extremities. This letter awakened
nature which had slumbered so long in Kei Kubad's breast, and he gave
orders to prepare his retinue, that he might visit his father. The favourite
attempted all in his power to prevent this interview, but finding the Prince,
for once, obstinate, he prevailed upon him to insist, as Emperor of
Delhi, upon the first visit, hoping by this means, to break off the
conference. His design, however, did not succeed, for the old King,
seeing what a headstrong boy he had to deal with, consented to come to
the imperial camp, and ordered the Astrologers to determine upon a lucky
hour, and crossing the river, proceeded towards his son's camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kei Kubad's insolence.</NOTE>The young Monarch
having prepared every thing for Baghera's reception in the most pompous and
ceremonious manner, mounted his throne, and arrogantly gave orders, that his
father, upon his approach, should three times kiss the ground. The old man
accordingly, when he arrived at the first door, was ordered to 
<PB N="227" REF="313"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1288. Higer. 687.</NOTE>dismount, and
after he had come in sight of the throne, he was commanded to pay his
obeysance in three different places as he ad∣vanced. The Sultan's Chobdars
crying out, according to custom, Baghera Chan to the King of the world
sends health.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mollified up∣on seeing his father.</NOTE>The
old man was so much shocked at this indignity, that he burst out into a
flood of tears; which being observed by the son, he could no longer
support his unnatural insolence, but leaping from the throne, fell on his
face at his father's feet, imploring his forgive∣ness for his offence. The
good old man melted into compassion, and raising him in his arms embraced
him, and hung weeping upon his neck. The scene in short was so affecting
on both sides, that the whole court began to wipe the tears from their
eyes.</P>
<P>These transports being over, the young Sultan helped his father
to mount the throne, and paying him his respects took his place at his right
hand, ordering a charger full of golden suns to be waved three times over his
father's head, and afterwards to be given among the people. All the Omrahs
also presented to him their Nasirs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A peace set∣tled between them.</NOTE>Public
business being then talked over, every thing was settled in peace and
friendship, and Baghera Chan returned to his own camp. A friendly
intercourse commenced immediately between the two armies, for the space of
twenty days, in which time the father and son alternately visited one
another, and the time was spent in festi∣vity and mirth. The principal
terms settled between the two Kings were, that they should respectively

Delhi, and his father to Bengal.</P>
<P>Before they had taken leave, Baghera Chan called his son, the

<PB N="228" REF="314"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1288. Higer. 687.</NOTE>them a long lecture
of advice on the art of government. He then embraced Kei Kubad, and whispered
in his ear, to rid himself of Nizam ul dien as soon possible. They both
parted in tears, and returned to their respective capitals. Baghera Chan was
much affected upon this occasion, and told his friends at his return to his
own camp, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he had that day parted with his son and the
empire,"</Q> still apprehensive of the minister and the wayward
dispo∣sition of the young man.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kei Kubad beginning to reform,</NOTE>When the
Sultan arrived at Delhi, the advice of his father for a few days seemed to
take root in his mind. But his reformation was not the interest of the
minister. He therefore soon brought back his prince to the paths of
pleasure. He, for this purpose, col∣lected together all the most
beautiful women, most graceful dancers and sweetest singers from all
parts of the empire; and these allure∣ments to vice were occasionally
introduced to his view.</P>
<P>One day as he was riding out, he was accosted by a beautiful lady,
mounted upon a fine Arabian horse, with a crown of jewels upon her head, a
thin white robe with golden flowers flowing loosely over her snowy
shoulders, and a sparkling girdle of gems around her slender waist.
This fair one advancing before the royal umbrella, with a thousand charms and
smiles began to sing a love song. Then stopping short, she begged
pardon for her intrusion, and would not, without much intreaty, proceed. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">is again brought back to pleasure.</NOTE>The
King was struck with the beauty of this enchantress, and immediately
dismounting, ordered his camp to be pitched, and employed the evening in the
pleasures of love. This damsel was no less remarkable for her wit than
for her beauty. The King, while she was dancing, having broke out in
rapturous verses upon those charms which she displayed, she
answered every time extempore in the same measure, with such

elegance as astonished and silenced the greatest wits of the court.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kei Kubad falls sick.</NOTE>In short, the
King continued in this course of pleasure, till wine, and intemperance in
his other passions, had ruined his health. He fell sick, and then began
to recollect the advices of his father, and to consider Nizam ul dien as the
cause of all his distress. He immedi∣ately began to form schemes in his
mind to rid himself of that wicked minister. He for this purpose ordered
him to the government of Moultan; but Nizam ul dien perceiving his drift,
contrived many delays, that he might get a favourable opportunity to
accomplish his villainous intentions. His designs, however, in the mean
time re∣verted upon his own head.

Itimer Chigen was pro∣moted to a high office at court, and Malleck Eitumur
Surcha was made Vakeel of the empire. These three divided the whole power of

Chilligies, a powerful tribe of Tartars, joined Shaista Chan, who usurped
the throne. Upon the first disturbance, those Turks who had set up the

themselves, and proscribed all the principal Chilligian officers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shaista Chan rebels.</NOTE>Jellal ul dien,
Shaista Chan, being the first in that bloody list, im∣mediately rebelled.
Himar Chigen had been deputed by the Turk∣ish party, to invite Shaista to a

assassination. Shaista discovering his de∣signs, drew upon the
traitor, who came to invite him, and killed him at the door of his tent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His sons seize the young King.</NOTE>The
sons of Jellal ul dien, who were renowned for their valour, immediately put

assault upon the camp of the Turks, cut their way to the royal tents, which
were pitched in the center of the army, and seizing the infant King, carried
him, and the son of Malleck ul Om∣rah, off, in spite of all opposition,
to their father. They killed Mal∣leck Eitumur Surcha, who pursued them, with
many other men of distinction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The citizens of Delhi take arms.</NOTE>When this
exploit began to be noised abroad in the city, the mob flew immediately to
arms. They marched out in thousands, and en∣camping at the Budaoon gate,
prepared to go against Jellal ul dien, and rescue the infant King, for they
greatly dreaded the power of the Chilligies, who were a fierce and savage
race. Malleck ul Omrah, the old minister, so often mentioned, considering
that this step would occasion the assassination of the young king,

lay sick, at Kilogurry. The villain found this unfor∣tunate prince dying upon
his bed, deserted by all his attendants. He beat out the poor remains of life
with a cudgel; then rolling him up in his bed-cloaths, threw him over the
window into the river. This assassin was a Turk of some family,
whose father had been unjustly put to death by Kei Kubad, and he now had a

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shaista Chan ascends the throne.</NOTE>When
this horrid deed was perpetrated, Shaista Chan ascended the throne, and
assumed the title of Jellal ul dien, having put an end to the dynasty of

and who was now esteemed the just heir of the empire, was immediately
appointed Suba of Kurrah, and sent off to his government. Jellal ul dien
marched into the palace, and was proclaimed with great solemnity in the city;
and to compleat his villainy, he made away with the young prince, that he might
reign with the greater security.</P>
<P>This great revolution happened in the year six hundred and

<HEAD>SECTION XII. The Reign of SULTAN JELLAL UL DIEN Firose of
Chillige.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1289. Higer. 688.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Different opi∣nions con∣cerning the origin of the tribe of
Chil∣lige.</NOTE>NIZAM UL DIEN AHMUD says in his history, that the tribe of
Chillige derived their origin from Calidge Chan. Callidge, continues that
writer, having quarrelled with his wife, who was an imperious and vindictive
woman, and fearing she would draw the resentment of her brother Chingez
Chan upon him, deserted his army as he was passing the mountains of Ghor
and Ghirgistan, in his return from the conquest of Iran. Three thousand
of his friends followed Calidge, and took possession of those
mountains, where they were afterwards joined by many of their countrymen, and
even by some of the family of Chingez Chan.</P>
<P>Other historians, with equal improbability, affirm, that we ought
to look for the origin of the Chilligies, as far back as Eaphs the son of
Noo<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Japhet, the son of Noah.</NOTE>, who,
say they, had eleven sons, one of whom was called Chillige. But we have
reason to think that neither of the accounts is authentic, the one being too
modern, and the other too antient, to merit our faith. We hear of this tribe of
Chillige in the reigns of Subuctagi, and Mamood of Ghizni, which entirely
de∣stroys the former supposition; and we have great doubts concerning the
existence of Chillige the son of Eaphs, being persuaded that this idle
story took its rise from the natural vanity of nations, in tracing
themselves back to remote antiquity.</P>
<P>This tribe however, as we have already observed, inhabited the
mountains of Ghor and Ghirgistan, and were a brave and hardy, though 
<PB N="233" REF="319"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1288. Higer. 687.</NOTE>barbarous race. They
make a business of war, and always served as mercenaries any power that
chose to employ them. The father of that Shaista Chan, who mounted the
throne of Delhi, was Egherish. He was one of those soldiers of fortune,
who subsist by the sword; and raised himself to some rank, in the
army of Sultan Balin. His son Firose being a man of genius, was appointed
to the government of Samana. He was called from thence, as before related, and
usurped the empire. He reserved for some months, the young Prince
Keiomours, as a cloak to his villainy; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He murders the infant Emperor.</NOTE>and having
established himself upon the throne, he ordered him to be put to death.
He was seventy years of age when he mounted the Musnud. Firose, by way of
plainness, chan∣ged the royal umbrella from red to white; laid entirely
aside his cru∣elty, after the death of the young Prince; and became
remarkable for his humanity and benevolence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Resides at Kilogurry.</NOTE>He had no great
confidence in the loyalty of the people of Delhi, and therefore resided
always at Kilogurry, which he strengthened with works, and adorned with fine
gardens, and beautiful walks by the side of the river. The Omrahs following
the Sultan's example, built palaces around, so that Kilogurry became known by
the name of the new city.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Confers ho∣nours upon his son.</NOTE>Egherish
Chan, the Sultan's brother, was appointed Ariz Mumalick, or receiver-general of
all petitions to the throne; and the Emperor's eldest son was dignified
with the title of Chan Chanan<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord of
Lords.</NOTE>: The second son, with the title of Arkali Chan; and the third
with that of Kuder Chan. They had all governments conferred upon them, and
maintained separate households. Chaja Chatire was appointed Vizier, and the
old chief magistrate of the city, Malleck ul Omrah, Fuchir ul dien, was
continued in his office.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seeks after popularity.</NOTE>The citizens of
Delhi perceiving the wisdom, lenity, and justice of the King, were
gradually weaned from their attachment to the old <PB N="234" REF="320"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1290 Higer. 689.</NOTE>family, and became
friends and supporters of the new government. The Sultan himself was at
much pains to cultivate popularity, and for that purpose he gave great
encouragement to the learned of that age, who, in return, offered the incense
of flattery at the altar of his fame. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nephew of Sultan Ba∣lin rebels</NOTE>In the
second year of Firose, Malleck Chidju, nephew to Sultan Balin, and the
Nabob of Kurrah, in alliance with Halim Chan, Nabob of Oud, assumed the
ensigns of royalty, and struck the currency of the country in his own name,
which he changed to that of Moghiz ul dien. He brought over to his party all
the Rajas and Ja∣gierdars of those parts, and, raising a great army,
advanced towards Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His army de∣feated.</NOTE>Advices of this
insurrect on arriving in the capital, the Sultan col∣lected his forces, and
marched out to meet the rebels. He sent the Chilligian cavalry, who excelled
at the bow, a few miles in his front, under the command of Arkilli Chan his own
son. Arkilli encoun∣tering the enemy about twelve crores from the city, after
an obsti∣nate engagement, defeated them. He took several Omrahs
priso∣ners in the pursuit, whom he mounted upon camels, with branches hung
round their necks; and in that plight sent them to the Sultan. When he saw
them in this distress, he immediately ordered them to be unbound, to have a
change of linen given them, and an elegant en∣tertainment to be provided. He
called them before him, and repeat∣ed a verse to this purpose, 
<Q REND="inline">"That evil for evil was easily returned, but he
only was great who could return good for evil."</Q> He then or∣dered them to
retire, in full assurance of his forgiveness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is taken,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pardon∣ed.</NOTE>Malleck
Chidju, some days after, was taken by the Zemindars, and sent prisoner to
the King. Instead of condemning him to death, as was expected, the Sultan
gave him a free pardon, and sent him to Moultan, where he had a handsome
appointment for life, as priso∣ner at large. This lenity of the King, gave
great umbrage to the Omrahs of Chillige, who addressed him upon the
occasion, and advi∣sed him to pursue the policy of Sultan Balin, who
never pardon∣ed a traitor. They desired, that, at least, a needle should
be <PB N="235" REF="321"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1290 Higer. 689.</NOTE>passed through
the eyes of Malleck Chidju, to be an example to others. If that was not done,
they averred, that treason would soon raise its head in every quarter of
the empire; and, should the Turks once gain the superiority, they would not
leave the name of Chillige in Hindostan. The King answered, that what they
said was certain∣ly according to the true policy of government; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clemency of the Emperor</NOTE>but, my friends,
says he, I am now an old man, and I wish to go down to the grave with∣out
shedding blood.</P>
<P>This behaviour of the Sultan, it must be acknowledged, had soon
the effect which the Chilligian chiefs foresaw. Clemency is a virtue which
descends from God, but the degenerate children of Hind did not deserve it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">occasions disturbances.</NOTE>There was no
security to be found in any place. The streets, the highways, were
infested by banditti. House-breaking, robbery, murder, and every other
species of villainy, became a busi∣ness all over the empire.
Insurrections were heard of in every pro∣vince, numerous gangs of robbers
stopt all commerce and intercourse, and the Nabobs refused or neglected
to send any account of their reve∣nues or administration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Omrahs conspire against him.</NOTE>The
Omrahs of Chillige were greatly alarmed at these proceedings, and began to
lengthen the tongue of reproach against their Sovereign. They even began to
consult about deposing him, and to raise Malleck Tage ul dien Kugi, who
was a man of influence, courage, and reso∣lution, to the throne. For this
purpose they met one day, at an entertainment in his house; but having
intoxicated themselves with wine, they began openly to talk of
assassinating the emperor, quarrel∣ing about which of them should
have the honour of that undertaking. While they were in this situation, one
of the company privately withdrew, and running to the Sultan, repeated very
circumstantially every particular of what he had heard. The Sultan
immediately or∣dered a guard to surround the house, who having seized the
Omrahs, <PB N="236" REF="322"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1290 Higer. 689.</NOTE>brought them all
before him. He upbraided them with their trea∣son, he drew his sword, and
throwing it down upon the ground, challenged the boldest of them to wield it
against him. But they fell upon their faces, and remained silent and
confounded. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are disco∣vered and pardoned.</NOTE>One of them
however, whose name was Malleck Nuserit, was gifted with more impudence
than the rest, and told the King, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the words of drunkenness were but wind: Where can
we ever find so good and gracious a King, if you should be no more? Or
where can the King get so faithful servants, were he to condemn us for a
little unguarded folly?"</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable story of a Dirvesh.</NOTE>The
unguarded Prince was pleased with this, and smiling, called for wine, and
gave him another cup with his own hand. He then upbraided the rest for their
conduct, advised them to behave better for the future, and dismissed
them all with his pardon.</P>
<P>The execution of a Dirvesh is one of the most remarkable events
in this reign. The name of the Dirvesh was Seid Molah, and the whole affair
has been thus delivered down in history.</P>
<P>Malleck ul Omrah Fuchir ul dien Cutwal, dying about this time, all
the great men, who by his interest, held Jagiers and places at court, were
deprived of them, and reduced to want. Among other dependants of the venerable
Cutwal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chief magistrate of the city.</NOTE>, that
became destitute by his death, were twelve thousand readers of the
Coran<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Each of these was obliged to read the
Coran over once a day.</NOTE>, and some thou∣sands of his Sipais and
servants. All these turned their face towards Seid Molah for their
maintenance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His history.</NOTE>This Seid Molah was a
venerable sage, in a mendicant dress, who travelled from Girjan towards the
east, where he visited various <PB N="237" REF="323"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1290 Higer. 689.</NOTE>countries, and men
famous for piety and knowledge. He then turn∣ed his face towards Hindostan,
to visit Shech Ferid ul dien Shucker∣gunge, a famous poet and philosopher
of that age, with whom he re∣sided, some time, in great friendship. But
in the reign of Sultan Balin, having an inclination to see Delhi, he took
leave of his friend, who advised him to cultivate no intimacy with the great
men of the court, otherwise it would prove fatal to him in the end.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrives at Delhi,</NOTE>Seid Molah arriving at
Delhi, set up a great academy and house of entertainment for travellers,
fakiers and the poor of all denomina∣tions, turning none away from his door.
Though he was very religious, and brought up in the Mahommedan faith, yet he
fol∣lowed some particular tenets of his own, so that he never attended
public worship. He kept no women nor slaves for himself, and lived upon
rice only; yet his expences in charity were so great, that, as he never
accepted of any presents, men were astonished whence his finances were
supplied, and actually believed, that he possessed the art of
transmuting other metals into gold. Upon the death of Sultan Balin he
launched out more and more in bestowing great sums in charity, and expended
a princely revenue in his entertainments, which were now frequented by all the
great men of the city; for he made nothing of throwing three or four thousand
pieces of gold into the bosom of a noble family in distress. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">his magnifi∣cence and charity.</NOTE>In short,
he displayed more magnificence in his feasts than any of the princes of the
empire. His charity was so unbounded, that he expended daily, upon the poor,
a thousand maunds of flower, five hundred maunds of meat, eighty maunds of
sugar, besides rice, oil, butter and other neces∣saries in proportion.
The mob, at length, crouded his gates in such numbers, that it was almost
impossible to pass that way. In the mean time, the sons of the Emperor
and all the princes of the court resorted to him with all their retinues, and
spent whole days and nights in innocent festivity and philosophical
conversation. <PB N="238" REF="324"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1290 Higer. 689.</NOTE>After the death of
Fuchir ul dien Cutwal, the Dirvesh stretched forth his hand to his numerous
dependants, and supported them in plenty and ease.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Casi Jellal ul dien, a man of an intriguing
turbulent disposition, wrought himself into the favour and confi∣dence of
Seid Molah, and being endued with art and plausibility of tongue, began to
inspire the philosopher with ambitious views. He told him that the people
looked upon him as sent by God to deliver the kingdom from the tyranny and
oppression of the Chilligies, and to bless Hindostan with a wise and
just government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aspires to the throne.</NOTE>The philosopher,
in short, suffered his imagination to be deluded by the splendid ideas of
royalty, and privately began to bestow titles and offices upon his
disciples, and to take other measures to execute his designs. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspires against the King.</NOTE>He engaged
Beregin Cutwal and Heitaï Palwan, two of his particular friends, to join
in the King's retinue on friday as he went to the public mosque, and to
assassinate him; while he himself prepared about ten thousand of
his adherents to support his usurpation. But one of his followers,
understanding that some others of less merit than himself were
appointed to be his superiors, be∣came disgusted, went privately to the
King, and disclosed to him every particular of the conspiracy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is seized,</NOTE>The King ordered Seid Molah
and Jellal ul dien to be imme∣diately seized and brought before him for
examination. But they persisted in their innocence, and no other witness
appeared against them, which rendering the accusation doubtful, the Sultan
ordered a great fire to be prepared in the field of Bahapoor, that they might
be put to the ordeal trial. He himself marched out of the city to see the
ceremony performed, and ordered a ring to be made round the pile. The fire
being kindled, the Sultan commanded Seid <PB N="239" REF="325"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1290 Higer. 689.</NOTE>Mola and the two
assassins to be brought, that they might walk through the flames to
prove their innocence. Having said their prayers they were just going to
plunge into the fire, when the Sul∣tan stopped them short, and turning to
his ministers, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"that the nature of fire was to consume, paying no
respect to the righte∣ous more than to the wicked. Besides, said he, it
is contrary to the Mahommedan law to practise this heathenish
superstition."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordered to perpetual im∣prisonment.</NOTE>He
therefore ordered Casi Jellal to Budaoon, and Seid Molah to be thrown into
chains in a vault under the palace, and the two men who were to perpetrare the
assassination to be put to death. He, at the same time, banished a
number of those who were suspected of the conspiracy. When they were
carrying Seid Molah through the court to his prison, the King pointed him out
to some Collinders who stood near him, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Behold the man who was project∣ing such evil
against us! I therefore leave him to be judged by you, according to his
deserts."</Q></P>
<P>At the word, a Collinder whose name was Beri, started forth, and
running towards the prisoner began to cut him with a razor. The unfortunate
Dirvesh told him to be more expeditious in send∣ing him to God. He then
addressed himself to the King, who was looking over the balcony, and
said, I am rejoiced that you have thought of putting a period to my life; yet
to distress the pious and the innocent is an evil, and be assured that
my curse will lie heavy upon you and your unfortunate posterity. The King
hearing these words, became pensive and perplexed. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Put to a cruel death.</NOTE>His son Arkilli
Chan, who hated Seid Molah for the great intimacy between him and his elder
brother Chan Chanan, seeing the Emperor's irresolution, beckoned to an
elephant rider, who stood in the court mounted, to advance, which accordingly
he did, and commanded his elephant to tread Seid Molah to death.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1291. Higer. 690.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">A
prodigy.</NOTE>Zea ul dien Birni, in his history of Firoze Shaw, informs us
that he himself was at that time in Delhi, and that, immediately upon the
death of Seid Molah, a black whirl-wind arose, which for the space of half
an hour, changed day into night, drove the people in the streets against
one another, so that they could scarce grope their way to their own
habitations. The same author relates, that no rain fell in these provinces
during that year, and the consequence was a most terrible famine, by which
thousands daily died in the streets and highways; while whole families
drowned themselves in the river. But these were the throes of nature, and
not the rage of the elements for Seid Molah. This event happened in the year
690, and the loss of the Dirvesh was much regretted, for many believed him
entirely innocent of the charge.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The good fortune of the King de∣clines.</NOTE>The
prosperity of the King began visibly to decline, for every day new factions
and disputes arose, which greatly disturbed his ad∣ministration.
Private misfortunes pressed hard upon him at the same time; among the
number of which was the madness of his eldest son Chan Chanan, heir
apparent of the empire. No medicines could cure that prince, and the
distemper hourly-gaining ground soon ter∣minated in his death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He marches to Rintim∣pore.</NOTE>The King, after

left his son Arkilli Chan to manage affairs in his absence. The enemy
having retired into the fort of Rintimpore, and the King having reconnoitered
the place, despaired of reducing it. He marched towards a small sort
called Jain, which he took, then breaking down the temples of Malava, plundered
them of some wealth and again returned to Rintimpore. He summoned the
sort a second time to surrender, but finding the rebels paid no attention
to his threats, he gave orders to undermine the walls. He however changed his
resolution, and <PB N="241" REF="327"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1291. Higer. 691.</NOTE>decamped, saying,
that he found the place could not be taken with∣out the loss of many lives,
and therefore that he would lay aside his designs against it. Malleck
Amed Chip, who was one of the pil∣lars of the empire, replied, that Kings in
the time of war, should make no account of those things, when compelled to
it by justice and the necessity of supporting their authority, which
was now plainly the case. The King, in wrath, asked him how he came to
think that these were not his sentiments; 
<Q REND="inline">"but I have often, said he, told you, that now

those terms, and presents were exchanged between them. When the Moguls were
retreating, Allaghu Chan, grandson to the great Chingez Chan, joined the
Sultan with three thousand men. They all became Mussulmen, and their
chief was honoured with one of the Sultan's daughters in marriage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arkilli Chan made gover∣nor of La∣hore.</NOTE>The
King, about this time, appointed his son Arkilli Chan, vice∣roy of Lahore,
Moultan and Sind, with whom he left a strong force, and returned himself to
his capital. To Allaghu Chan and the rest of the Moguls who had now become
true believers, was allotted a certain district near the city, where they
built for themselves houses, and raised a considerable town, known by
the name of Mogulpurra.</P>
<P>In the year 692, the Sultan was under the necessity of marching
his army again to quell an insurrection about Mindu, which fort he took, and
put the enemy to flight. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The expedi∣tions of Alla ul dien.</NOTE>In the
mean time, Malleck Alla ul dien, the King's nephew, and governor of Kurrah,
requested to be permitted to march against the Hindoos of Belsa who
infested his pro∣vince. Having obtained leave, he marched the same year to
Belsa, which he took, and having pillaged the country returned with much
spoil, part of which was sent as a present to the Sultan; among other
things there was a large brazen idol, which was thrown down, by the
Budaoon-gate. The Sultan was greatly pleased with the success and
behaviour of Alla ul dien upon this expedition, for which he rewarded him with
princely presents, and annexed the subadary of Oud to his former government
of Kurrah.</P>
<P>Alla ul dien, upon this preferment, acquainted the King that there
were some Rajas of great wealth towards Chinderi, whom, if the Sultan
should give him permission, he would reduce to his obe∣dience, and send
their spoils to the royal treasury. The King, <PB N="243" REF="329"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1293. Higer. 693.</NOTE>through
covetousness, consented to this proposal, to which Alla ul dien was
moved by the violent temper of his wife Mallike Jehan the Sultan's daughter,
who threatened his life. To avoid therefore her resentment and that of her
father, he looked round for some remote country which might afford him an
asylum. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches into the Decan.</NOTE>Accordingly, in the
year 693, he took leave of the Sultan at Delhi, and proceeding towards Kurrah,
took many chiefs of distinction into his service. He marched with eight
thousand chosen horse, by the nearest road against Ramdeo, Raja of
the Decan, who possessed the wealth of a long series of Kings.</P>
<P>Alla ul dien, arriving upon the frontiers of the Decan, pressed
for∣ward against the capital of Rumdeo's dominions, which, not being
fortified, he was in hopes of surprizing. Though this attempt seemed too
bold to be attended with success, yet he persisted in his resolution,
and by surprizing marches reached Elichpoor, where he made a short halt to
refresh his small army. He marched from thence with equal expedition,
towards Deogire the capital. Intelli∣gence of Alla's progress coming to the
Raja, who, with his son, had been absent upon some service in a
distant part of his dominions, he returned with great expedition to intercept
the enemy with a nume∣rous army. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Overthrows Ramdeo.</NOTE>He accordingly threw
himself between Alla and the city, engaged him with consummate bravery, but
in the end he was de∣feated with great loss.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another ac∣count of this expedition.</NOTE>This
expedition is otherwise recorded by the author of the Tibcat Nasiri. Alla
ul dien, says that writer, left Kurrah on pretence of hunting, and having
passed through the territories of many petty Rajas, avoided all
hostilities, giving out that he had lest the Emperor in disgust, and
was going to offer his services to the Raja of the Tillingas Ram Chunder, who
was the most powerful King in the Decan. Accordingly, after two months march,
he arrived <PB N="244" REF="330"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1293. Higer. 693.</NOTE>without any
remarkable opposition at Elichpoor, from whence at once changing his
course, he decamped in the night, and in two days surprized the city of
Deogire the capital of Ramdeo. The Raja himself was in the city, but his wife
and his eldest son had gone to worship at a certain temple without the
walls.</P>
<P>Ramdeo, upon the approach of Alla, was in the greatest
conster∣nation. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alla takes Deogire.</NOTE>He however collected
three or four thousand citizens and domesticks, engaged Alla ul dien at one
of the gates of the city, but being defeated, retired into the citadel. This
fort having no ditch, and not being stored with provisions, he had no hopes
of de∣fending it long. Alla ul dien immediately invested the place. In the
mean time he gave out, that he was only the van-guard of the Emperor's army,
who were on full march to the place. This struck universal terror into all
the Rajas round, who, instead of joining for the general safety, began to
secure themselves. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alla's cruelty.</NOTE>Alla ul dien having pillaged
the city and seized upon the merchants, brahmins and prin∣cipal inhabitants,
tortured them for their wealth; while he at the same time carried on the
siege of the citadel.</P>
<P>Ramdeo seeing he must soon be obliged to yield, and imagining
that the Emperor intended to make a general conquest of the Decan,
endeavoured to procure a peace before any other forces arrived. He therefore
wrote after this manner to Alla.</P>
<Q>Your invasion of this country was certainly impolitic and rash,
but fortunately for you, having found the city unguarded, you have been
permitted to range at large. It is however possible that the Rajas of the
Decan, who command innumerable armies, may yet surround you, and not permit
one of your people to escape from our dominions alive. Supposing even that
you should be able to retreat from hence undisturbed, are not the Rajas of
Malava, Candez and <PB N="245" REF="331"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1293. Higer. 693.</NOTE>Gundwarra in your
way, who have each armies of forty or fifty thousand men? Do you hope they
will permit you to escape unmo∣lested, after this perfidious attack on
their brethren, in religion and Gods? 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramdeo pro∣poses terms of peace,</NOTE>It is
therefore adviseable for you to retire in time, by accepting a small
reward, and what spoil you have already got, to indemnify you for your
expence and labour.</Q>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">which Alla accepts.</NOTE>Malleck Alla ul dien
was very glad to accept of those proposals, and having received fifty
maunds of gold, a large quantity of pearls and jewels, fifty elephants, and
some thousand horses, which were taken in the Rajas stables, he
released his prisoners, and promised to abandon the place in the morning
of the fifteenth day, from his first entrance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramdeo's son advances with an army.</NOTE>But
when Alla was preparing to retreat, the Raja's eldest son, who had fled
with his mother, on the first appearance of the imperial troops, to collect
forces, advanced with a numerous army, within a few miles of the city. Ramdeo
sent a message to his son, inform∣ing him, that peace was concluded,
and whatever was done, was done. He therefore ordered him not to open again the
door of dis∣turbance, for that he perceived the Turks were a warlike race,
whose peace was better than their war. The young Prince however,
un∣derstanding that his army was thrice the number of the enemy, and
expecting hourly to be joined by other Rajas, with numerous forces, listened
not to the commands of his father, but wrote to Alla ul dien in these
terms:</P>
<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">His

have any love for life, and desire safety, rush out of this horrible

and received, you must return, and take your way homeward, rejoicing in your
happy escape.</Q>
<P> <PB N="246" REF="332"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1293. Higer. 693.</NOTE>Alla ul dien, upon
reading this insolent letter, kindled the fire of rage, and blackening the
face of the messenger, hooted him out of the city. He left Malleck
Nuserit to invest the citadel with a thou∣sand horse, and immediately
marched with the rest of his army, to attack the Raja's son, and drew up in
the front of his camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is over∣thrown.</NOTE>The Hindoo did not decline
the offered battle. He drew forth his numerous squadrons, and the battle
commenced with such vio∣lence, that the stout heart of Alla ul dien began
to quake for the victory. His troops began to fall back on all sides. In the
mean time Malleck Nuserit having learned by his scouts, the situation of
affairs, left the citadel without orders, and galloping up to the field of
battle, with his thousand horse, changed the fortune of the day. The dust
having prevented the enemy from discovering the force of Nuserit, some
person cried out, that the Turkish army, of whom they had been told, was
arrived. This spread instantly a panic through the Hindoo ranks, and they
at once turned their face to flight. Alla ul dien did not think proper to
pursue them far, but immediately returned into the city, and invested the
citadel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelty of the Turks.</NOTE>A scene of cruelty
and horror now commenced. The Turks, en∣raged at the perfidy of the Hindoos,
for their breach of the treaty, began to spread fire and sword through the
city; from which no dis∣cipline could restrain them. Several of the Raja's
kindred, who had been taken prisoners, were in chains, thrown down in sight
of the enemy. The Raja, in the mean time, sent express upon express, to
hasten the succours which he expected from the Raja of Kilbirga,
Tillingana, Malava, and Candez: but was informed, that there re∣mained no
provisions in the place, for that a great number of bags, in which they had
reckoned upon rice, had been found, upon exami∣nation, to be salt.</P>
<P> <PB N="247" REF="333"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1293. Higer. 693.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Raja in great distress.</NOTE>The Raja was greatly
perplexed; he commanded that this should be concealed from the troops, and
began a second time to propose a treaty with Alla ul dien.</P>
<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proposes terms.</NOTE>It must be known to
you, said the Raja, O! my lord, that your well-wisher, Ramdeo, had no hand
in the late quarrel. If my son, in the way of folly, and the pride of youth,
exalted the spear of valour and hostility, let not your resentment be
kindled against me for his rashness.</Q>
<P>Ramdeo told the messenger privately, that there was no
provisions in the place, and that if the enemy should persist a few
days, they must be informed of their distress, which would inevitably
bring on the ruin of the whole. For, said the Raja, supposing we should
be able to hold out the place against the assaults of the enemy, yet
famine cannot be withstood; and there is now scarce six days provision
left. Use then every art, and take any means, to persuade the army of
Islam<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That is the Mahommedans.</NOTE>, to
evacuate the country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A peace con∣cluded.</NOTE>But Malleck Alla ul
dien, from the behaviour of Ramdeo, per∣ceived the true cause of his
proposals, and therefore started every day some new difficulty to retard
the treaty, till the garrison was in the utmost distress. But at length
it was concluded, according to our author, upon the following almost
incredible terms; that Alla ul dien should receive, upon consideration of
evacuating the country, six hundred maunds, of pure gold, according to the
weights of the Decan<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The maund of the Decan is
25lb. avoirdupoise.</NOTE>, seven maunds of pearl, two maunds of diamonds,
rubies, emeralds, and sapphires, one thousand maunds of silver, four
thou∣sand pieces of silk, and a long list of other precious commodities
that surpass all belief. This ransom was not only required, but also
the cession of Elichpoor, and its dependancies, where Alla might leave 
<PB N="248" REF="334"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1294. Higer. 694.</NOTE>a small garrison
to collect the revenues, which should remain there unmolested.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alla retreats with an im∣mense
trea∣sure.</NOTE>Malleck Alla ul dien, having settled affairs to his
satisfaction, re∣leased all his prisoners, and marched in triumph out of
the city with his plunder, and proceeded on his way homeward, on the
twenty-fifth day after his taking the city. He conducted his retreat with
such sur∣prizing address, that he opened his way through extensive and
power∣ful kingdoms; through Malava, Conduana, Candez, and others, though he was
surrounded by numerous armies, who admiring his order and resolution, made
but faint and irresolute attacks, which served only to adorn his triumph.
We may here justly remark, that in the long volumes of history, there is
scarcely any thing to be com∣pared to this exploit, whether we regard the
resolution in forming the plan, the boldness of the execution of it, or the
fortune which attended the attempt. We cannot help to lament, that a man
form∣ed for such great exploits, should not be actuated by better motives
than rapine, violence, and the thirst of gain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan suspects Alla of treasonable
designs.</NOTE>When Alla ul dien marched to Deogire, all communication with
Kurrah being stopt, no news was heard of him for some months. The person,
whom he left his deputy, to make the King easy, wrote, that he had accounts
of his being busy in the conquest of Chinderi, and amused him every day
with false intelligence. But as the King, for the space of six months,
had received no letters from under his own hand, he began to suspect
treason; and in the year 695, under a pretence of hunting, ordered out his
retinue, and proceeded towards Gualier, where he encamped, and built a
Choultry, inscribing a verse to this purpose, over the door.— 
<Q REND="inline">"I who press with my foot the celestial

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alla ul dien returns to∣wards Kur∣rah.</NOTE>In
the mean time Firose Shaw received private intelligence, that Alla ul dien
had conquered Deogire, and had acquired there such wealth, as had never been
possessed by an Emperor of Delhi, and that he was now upon his march
towards Kurrah. The King was greatly pleased with this intelligence, and
reckoned upon the spoil, as if already in his own treasury. But men of more
wisdom thought otherwise, and justly concluded, that it was not to fill
the royal cof∣fers, as Alla ul dien, without the King's authority, had
undertaken such a daring expedition. They however waited to see the event,
without informing the King of their suspicions. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan consults his council con∣cerning
Alla.</NOTE>The King having one day assembled his council, and told them,
that Alla ul dien was now on his march to Kurrah with immense plunder,
requested their advice whether it was most prudent to remain where he was,
and command Alla to his presence, to march towards him, or to return to
Delhi.</P>
<P>Malleck Ahmed Chip, who was renowned for his wisdom and
pene∣tration, expressed his suspicions to the King, in a rational and
plausible manner. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They differ in their opi∣nions.</NOTE>He advised
the Sultan, at the same time, to advance with his army towards Chinderi, and
to encamp in the way between Alla ul dien and Kurrah. This, said he, will
discover Alla's intentions, before he has time to augment his army. Ahmed
Chip added fur∣ther, 
<Q REND="inline">"that, upon the appearance of the imperial army, it
was highly probable, that the troops of Alla ul dien, being laden with spoil,
and within their own country, would not chuse to hazard the loss of it by
an action; but would rather endeavour to secure their wealth among the
mountains. That, by this means, Alla ul dien would be deserted by the
greatest part of his small army, which would oblige him to think of nothing
but peace, and to lay all his wealth at the <PB N="250" REF="336"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1295. Higer. 695.</NOTE>foot of the
throne. That the King in that case might take all the gold, jewels, and
elephants, permitting him to retain the remain∣der for himself, and either
leave him his government, or carry him to Delhi, according to the royal
pleasure."</Q></P>
<P>Malleck Fuchier ul dien Kudgi, though he was sensible of the
prudence of this advice, yet turning his eyes upon the Emperor, he perceived he
did not at all approve of it; and therefore began to this effect: 
<Q REND="inline">"The news of Alla ul dien's return, the amount of
his plunder, and the truth of his conquest, has not yet been confirmed but by
flying reports, which we all know are often vague and extrava∣gant. Supposing
even that this account is true, is it not natural to imagine, that when he
shall hear of the approach of the imperial ar∣my, that the fear of false
accusation, or evil designs against him, will prevail on him to retreat
among the mountains? From whence, as the rainy season is at hand, it will
be impossible to dislodge him. Let us not therefore cast off our
shoes, before we reach the river, but wait till Alla shall arrive at
Kurrah. If then it shall appear, that he cherishes his treasonable views,
one assault of the imperial army will crush his ambition."</Q></P>
<P>Malleck Ahmed Chip, having heard this perfidious advice, was kindled
into generous resentment, and replied; 
<Q REND="inline">"The time passes,—As soon as Alla ul

Lucknouti, where his treasure will soon enable him to raise such an
army as neither you nor I will be able to oppose? O shame! that men
should know better, yet not have the honesty to give salutary
advice."</Q></P>
<P>The Sultan was displeased with those words, and spoke thus
to the Omrahs who stood near him. 
<Q REND="inline">"Malleck Chip does always ill offices to Alla ul

such private rancour shall have no weight with the King; I am so well

<P>Malleck Ahmed, upon this, shut the door of argument, and, rising
with some emotion, walked out, striking one hand upon the other, and
repeating a verse to this purpose.

his intentions, but they were detained, and watched so strictly, that they
could send no advices to the King. Malleck Almass, who was also son in

brother Alla ul dien, 
<Q REND="inline">"That it was now become public at Kurrah, that the

he was afraid excess of sorrow would put an end to his melancholy life: He
therefore requested, that his brother should in∣form him, before the King
put his design in execution, that he might either take poison, or look out
for a place of security."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His insidious letters to the

bro∣ther, Almass Beg, who being in the plot, was constantly at court, and
shewed them to the King, seemingly distracted, lest his brother
should lay violent hands upon himself, or fly his country. He used a
thousand delusive arts to inveigle the King, who no less feared the
loss of the treasure than his nephew's life, to Kurrah. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan inveigled to proceed to

<P>Alla ul dien, hearing of the Sultan's departure from Delhi,
crossed the Ganges with his army, and encamped near Mannickpoor, upon the
opposite bank. When, upon the seventeenth of Ramzaan, the Sultan's umbrella
appeared in sight, Alla ul dien drew out his army, on pretence of doing him
honour, and sent his brother Almass Beg, who had come on before to concert
measures to introduce the King into camp. This artful traitor represented
to the Sultan, that if he should take the thousand horse with him, Alla

strongly <PB N="253" REF="339"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1295. Higer. 695.</NOTE>in his fears, that
all he could say to him was not sufficient entirely to expell his
suspicions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Persuaded to leave his re∣tinue behind
him.</NOTE>The poor old King suspecting nothing of this horrid treachery,
from a man whom he had cherished from his infancy in his bosom, gave into
this proposal. He ordered a few of his select friends into his own boat,
and commanded the fleet to remain some distance behind. When they came near
the camp, Almass Beg again opened the mouth of delusion, and told the King,
that his brother seeing so many men in compleat armour, might possibly
be startled; that therefore as he had taken such ridiculous notions into
his head, which no body could remove, it were better to avoid the least
appearances to favour them. The weak King might have seen that this was
overdoing the matter, but perhaps he thought it now too late to reveal his
suspicions, being near the skirts of the camp, and that an open
confidence might be his best security. He therefore ordered all his
attendants to unbuckle their armour, and lay their weapons aside. Malleck
Charram, Vakiel of the Empire, opposed this step with great vehemence, for
he plainly saw into the bottom of their perfidy. But the traitor had such a
soft and plausible tongue, that at last he yielded, though with great
reluctance.</P>
<P>They had now reached the landing place, and Alla ul dien ap∣peared
upon the bank with his attendants, whom he ordered to halt. He himself
advancing alone met the Sultan just after he had landed upon the beach, and
fell down prostrate at his feet. The old man in a familiar manner tapped him
on the cheek, and raising him up, embraced him, saying, 
<Q REND="inline">"I who have brought you up from your in∣fancy, and

<P>All his attendants were then murdered. They fixed the venerable head

<P>Alla ul dien immediately exalted the white umbrella over his own

his pillow and repeated an extempore verse to the following purpose: 
<Q REND="inline">"He cometh, but his head shall fall in the boat,

seized upon many Omrahs, who, in the late revolution, taking advantage of the

Kirren, who fled and took protection under Ramdeo, Raja of Deogire, in the
Decan. By the aid of that prince he soon after returned and took
possession of Bucke∣lana, one of the districts of Guzerat, bordering

mutiny in the army,</NOTE>The two generals having on the march, made a demand
of the fifth of the spoil from the troops, besides what they had already
extorted from them, a mutiny arose in the camp. Mahummud Shaw, general of the
mercenary Moguls, with many other chiefs, at the head of their several
divisions, attacked Malleck Eiz ul dien, the brother of Naserit Chan, and
having slain him and a number of his people, continued their march. Elich
Chan fled in the disguise of a footman, to the tent of Naserit Chan. The
mutineers rushing in, killed the Sultan's nephew, whom he had left upon the
couch asleep, supposing him to be Elich Chan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">quelled.</NOTE>Naserit Chan immediately ordered
the drums of war to be beat and the trumpets to be sounded. All who had not
been concerned in the mutiny imagined that the enemy was coming upon them, and
quickly formed the line. The mutineers divided and dispersed themselves
all over the camp, and escaping in the confusion, fled by different routs,
to a place of rendezvous. They were however closely pursued the next day,
and forced to retreat with some loss, to the districts of the Raja of
Rintimpore, where they took protec∣tion. Elich Chan continued then his march to
Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan's abominable lust.</NOTE>Sultan Alla

who, for her beauty, wit and accomplishments, was the flower of Hindostan,
took her in marriage. But this did not satisfy his abominable lusts. Chaja
Casur, a slave who had been taken on that expedition, engaged his unnatural
passion, which he publickly indulged to the disgrace and debasement of
human nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His cruelty.</NOTE>Naserit Chan, by the
Sultan's order, basely massacred all the fa∣milies of those Moguls or

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of the Moguls.</NOTE>About this time,
Jildoo, a Mogul chief, and his brother, came down with a considerable force,
and took the fort of Seostan. Ziffer Chan marched against him, and having
invested the place, he took it. Jildoo, and about two thousand Moguls, were
taken prisoners, and sent in chains to Delhi. But Ziffer Chan had
distinguished himself so much as a brave commander in this expedition,
that his fame awa∣ked the jealousy of the King. He therefore designed to
deprive him of his government, but was prevented from this measure, by a
great invasion of Moguls, under Cuttuligh Chaja, the son of Dova Chan, King
of Maverulnere. The army of the invaders consisted of two hundred
thousand horse, and they promised to themselves the entire conquest
of Hindostan. Cuttuligh, accordingly, took possession of all the
countries beyond the Sind in his march, and protected them from all violence.
He then crossed the river, and proceeded to Delhi, without opposition,
Ziffer Chan retreating with his army before him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They besiege Delhi.</NOTE>The whole country, in
terror of the Moguls, crowded into the city. The crowd became so great, that
the streets were rendered im∣passable, and all business and
communication was interrupted. This however was but the beginning of their
misfortunes. In the space of a few days, the consumption being great, and
no supplies procured, a dreadful famine began to rage, and distraction to
stare in every coun∣tenance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan man lies out against them.</NOTE>The
Sultan, upon this pressing occasion, called a council of his Omrahs, and,
having regulated his plan of action, prepared for bat∣tle, notwithstanding
they all endeavoured to disswade him from it. He left the care of the city
to Alla ul Malleck, marched out at the Budaoon gate, with three hundred
thousand horse, and two thousand <PB N="262" REF="348"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1298. Higer. 698.</NOTE>seven hundred
elephants, besides foot without number. He drew up in order of battle on the
plains, beyond the suburbs; where the ene∣my were already formed to receive
him. From the time that first the spears of Islam<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Mahommedans.</NOTE> were exalted in Hindostan,
two such mighty armies had not joined in fight.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A battle.</NOTE>Sultan Alla ul dien gave the
command of his right wing to Ziffer Chan, the greatest general of that age,
where all the troops of Pun∣jaab, Moultan, and Sind, were posted. The left
was intrusted to his brother Elich Chan, and to Akit Chan his brother in law.
The Sultan posted himself in the center, with twelve thousand independant
volunteers, who were mostly gentlemen of ruined families, and sol∣diers of
fortune. With the choice of his elephants, he formed a tremendous line in his
front, and he supported his rear with another chosen body of cavalry, under
Naserit Chan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moguls overthrown.</NOTE>Ziffer Chan began the
action with great impetuosity on the right, and breaking with his elephants,
the enemy's line, commenced a dreadful slaughter, and bore them like a
torrent before him. Inclining then to the left, he pressed upon their
flank, and put their whole army to flight, before the action was well begun in
the center.</P>
<P>The Sultan, seeing the victory compleat, ordered Elich Chan, who
commanded on the left, to advance and pursue the enemy. But the perfidious
man, jealous of the glory of Ziffer Chan, stopt at a small distance, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ziffer Chan pressing
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> upon the enemy,</NOTE>while
Ziffer Chan continued the slaughter, for upwards of thirty miles. One of the
Mogul chiefs, who commanded the left, seeing Ziffer Chan was not supported,
rallied with ten thousand horse, and sending advice to Cuttuligh Chaja,
he also returned with ten thousand more, and attacked Ziffer in the rear.
The brave ge∣neral saw into his error, but it was now too late to retreat. He
drew up his troops, which were not half the enemy's number, divided into 
<PB N="263" REF="349"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1298. Higer. 698.</NOTE>two squadrons, and
again renewed the conflict, exhibiting wonders by his own valour. At last his
horse's leg being cut off by a sabre, he fell to the ground. He however
rose again, seized a bow and quiver, and being a dexterous archer, sent
death on the wings of his arrows. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">is defeated and sla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</NOTE>The most part of his men were, by this time,
either killed or fled; and Cuttiligh Chaja, admiring his bravery, called out to
him to submit, and his valour should be rewarded with such honours as he
deserved. Ziffer Chan replied sternly, 
<Q REND="inline">"I know no greater honour than to die in
discharging my duty."</Q> Then he began to deal his ar∣rows around. Cuttiligh
Chan, upon this, ordered a party of horse to surround him, and endeavour to
take him alive; but Ziffer refused to submit, and was at last cut in
pieces, with a few trusty servants who stood by him to the last.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moguls retreat.</NOTE>This advantage however
did not dispel the fears of the Moguls. They continued their retreat, and
evacuated Hindostan with all expe∣dition. The bravery of Ziffer Chan became
famous among the Mo∣guls. When their horses started, or were unruly, they
used wantonly to ask them, whether they saw the ghost of Ziffer Chan?
Sultan Alla ul dien, it is said, esteemed the death of this great general,
as a second victory, and could not help expressing his satisfaction
upon the occasion; and thus displayed his own base ingratitude, for that
brave life which had been thrown away in his unworthy service. Great
re∣joicings were made at Delhi, to celebrate the victory; and the prin∣cipal
officers were rewarded with titles and governments, according to their
behaviour and interest at court. Some who had behaved ill, were disgraced,
particularly one Omrah, who was led upon an ass all round the city.</P>

veneration by posterity. He often consulted upon this scheme Elich Chan,
Naserit Chan, and Akit Chan, over a bottle; from which we may suppose he
had no design to prohibit the use of wine. His other design was equally
romantic. He proposed to leave a viceroy in Hindostan, and, like the great
Secunder, to undertake the conquest of the world. In consequence of this
project, he assumed the title of Aescunder Sani<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Alexander the Second.</NOTE>, which was struck upon the currency
of the empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His ignorance of letters.</NOTE>Notwithstanding
these lofty ideas, Alla ul dien was so illiterate, that he even did not

presence. There were not however want∣ing slaves, who, though they knew
better, extolled his every word to the skies, and seemed to feed upon his
crude imaginations.</P>

every measure against the doctrine of the Mahommedan faith, and to dedicate
the few years he had to live, by the course of nature, to martyrdom. With

great and small, to all nations and degrees of people, should your

con∣ceive what hatred should rise against you, and what blood and

western provinces which had been invaded by the Moguls, such as Limghan,
Cabul, Ghizni, Toor, and Chorrassan. This, said the Cutwal, would
secure the peace of Hindostan, and procure to the King immortal honour, in
bestowing happiness upon his people; a thing greater in itself, than if

In the morning before sun-rise, he placed himself upon a rising ground,
where he sat down with two or three attendants, and commanded the rest to
hunt in his view. Akit Chan observing this, recollected that it was now in
his power to cut off the King, in the same manner as the King himself had

patriotism are things unknown, mankind are satisfied to bow their necks to
any new master. The great men assembled to pay their court, and present
their nizirs or presents upon the occasion; the customary service was
read from the Coran; the Chutba was proclaimed aloud, and the singers ordered
to extol his praise. Akit Chan then rose from the throne, and proceeded
towards the Haram; but Malleck Dinar, the chief eunuch, with his guard,

joined by Elich Chan, and began to be∣siege the place. But the Hindoos so
well defended themselves, that numbers of the imperial army daily fell. The
Sultan however continued his attacks with redoubled obstinacy, while
detachments of his army ravaged the adjacent territories of Malava and Daar. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rebellion quashed.</NOTE>But the siege being
protracted for some months without much effect, Amir Omar and Mungu Chan, who
were both nephews to the Emperor, and held the governments of Budaoon and Oud,
rebelled and raised a great army. The Sultan wrote letters to the several
Omrahs of those provinces whom he thought loyal, as also to the
neighbouring Subas and Zemindars, and they levied forces, engaged, defeated and
took the rebels, and sent them both prisoners to the <PB N="270" REF="356"/>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1299. Higer. 699.</NOTE>royal camp. The
Sultan ordered their eyes to be put out, and then to torture them to death, as
a barbarous example to others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An extraor∣dinary
con∣spiracy.</NOTE>Notwithstanding this severity, one of the most
extraordinary con∣spiracies recorded in history, was undertaken by Hadjee
Mola, the son of a slave of the old Cutwal Amir ul Omrah Fuchir ul dien.
This ambitious youth, seeing the Sultan busied in the siege of
Rin∣timpore, began to form the scheme of a revolution in the empire. He was
perhaps moved to this scheme by the murmuring of the citizens against Alla
ul Muluck's deputy, Tirmazi, who, in his master's absence in camp,
oppressed the people, having the government entirely in his hands. The
first thing however that Hadjee Mola publickly did, was in the heat of the
day, when every body was gone to rest, to collect a mob of citizens, by a
forged order from the King. With these he hastened to the house of
Tirmazi, and sent in to tell him that a messenger had arrived with an
order from the King. Tirmazi, out of respect to the Sultan's order,
hastened to the door, when the young impostor showing him the paper in
one hand, cut him down with the other. He then read aloud the forged mandate
for that purpose.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A sedition at Della,</NOTE>The mob now
encreasing, he sent parties to secure the city gates, and dispatched a
person to Alla ul dien Eaz, who was Cutwal of the new city, to come and see
the King's order. This magistrate how∣ever, having heard of the
disturbance, paid no regard to the message, but shut his own gates.
Hadjee Mola, in the mean time, with his mob, entered the red palace and
released all the state prisoners, taking out all the arms, treasure and
valuable effects, which he di∣vided among his followers. He then, by force,
placed Allavi, one of the prisoners, who was descended from Altumsh, upon
the throne, and imperiously commanded all the principal men of the city to
pay him allegiance.</P>
<P> <PB N="271" REF="357"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1299. Higer. 699.</NOTE>The Sultan having
advice of these strange transactions, was struck motionless with
astonishment, but stirred not a step from the siege. He however wrote
to Malleck Himid ul dien, his foster brother, who raising a party in the
city, seized the Budaoon gate the seventh day after the usurpation, and
took the field, where he was joined by a great multitude from the new city and
the country around. With these he again, by surprize, entered the city at
the Ghizni gate, but he was met at the second gate, called Beder, by Hadjie
Mola and his associates, and a sharp conflict ensued. Himmid ul dien
being dismounted, run up to Hadjie Mola, who was leading on his party with
great bravery, and pulling him from his horse, threw him down in the street
and slew him. He himself, in the mean time, received several wounds; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">quashed.</NOTE>but the faction of Hadjie Mola,
dis∣pirited by his death, gave ground and dispersed themselves all over
the city. Himid ul dien then proceeded to the red palace, dragged from thence
the unfortunate Allavi, and sent his head round the city upon the point of a
spear, which put an end to this strange conspiracy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Elich Chan sent to punish the
rebels.</NOTE>Elich Chan was in the mean time sent by the Sultan to Delhi, to
punish all who were supposed to have had any hand in this rebellion. The
sons of Malleck ul Omrah Fuchir ul dien, and the old Cutwal himself were
put to death merely on suspicion, as the rebel had been one of their
dependants. But the most probable cause was their great wealth, which was
confiscated to the King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rintimpore taken.</NOTE>Rintimpore had now been
closely besieged for a whole year, and the Sultan, after trying all other
means, fell upon the following expedient to take the place. He collected
together a great multitude of people, and provided each of them with a bag,
which they filled with earth, and having begun at some distance from the
rock, with im∣mense labour, formed an ascent to the top of the walls, by
which <PB N="272" REF="358"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A D. 1300. Higer. 700.</NOTE>the troops entered
the place, and put Raja Amir Deo, his family and the garrison to the sword.
This fort is esteemed the strongest in Hindostan.</P>
<P>Mier Mahummud Shaw, the Mogul general, who had taken refuge in
Rintimpore, after the mutiny at Jallore, having lost most of his men in the
defence of the fort, was himself lying ill of his wounds when the Sultan
entered the place. Alla finding the unfor∣tunate Mahummud in this condition,
asked him in an insulting manner, 
<Q REND="inline">"what gratitude would he express for his lord,
should he command his wounds to be immediately cured."</Q> The Mogul fiercely
replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"I would put him to death for a tyrant, and
endeavour to make the son of Amir Deo, to whom my gratitude is due,
King."</Q> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahummud Shaw put to a cruel death.</NOTE>The
Sultan enraged at this reply, threw him beneath the feet of an elephant. But
considering afterwards that he was a brave man, and one of whose gallant
behaviour he himself had been often witness, he ordered his body to be put
in a coffin, and interred with decent solemnity. The Sultan then commanded
that the Raja's vizier, who had deserted over to him with a strong party
during the siege, should, with all his followers, be massacred. Saying
upon the occa∣sion, that 
<Q REND="inline">"those who have betrayed their natural Lord, can
never be true to another!"</Q> Having bestowed the government of Rintim∣pore,
with all the riches taken in it, upon his brother Elich Chan, he returned with
his army to Delhi. But Elich Chan, about six months after, fell sick and
died on his way to the capital.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan convenes a council of the
Omrahs.</NOTE>Alla ul dien being in the course of this year, apprehensive
of con∣spiracies and insurrections, called together the Omrahs who were
most renowned for their wisdom, and commanded them to give their opinion
without reserve, how he should conduct matters, so as to prevent
disturbances and rebellions in the empire. He at the same time desired
them to explain what they thought were the principal <PB N="273" REF="359"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A D. 1300. Higer. 700.</NOTE>causes of those
disorders. The Omrahs, after consulting among themselves, replied, that
there were many causes concurring in a state, from which the convulsions
disagreeable in their consequences proceeded. That as those misfortunes
could not be obviated at once, they would only mention, for that time, a few of
those evils, from which danger to the empire must have arose.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The causes of disturbances in
the em∣pire.</NOTE>"At the head of this list,"</Q> said the Omrahs, 
<Q REND="inline">"we must place the King's inattention to advance
the good, or to redress the wrongs of the people. The public use of wine is
the source of many disor∣ders; for when men form themselves into
societies for the purpose of drinking, their minds are disclosed to one
another, while the strength of the liquor fermenting in their blood
precipitates them into the most desperate undertakings. The connections
formed by the great men of the court, are pregnant with danger to the state.
Their nume∣rous marriages, and the places in their gift, draw the strength of
the government into the hands of a few, who are always able, by
asso∣ciating themselves together, to create revolutions in the empire.
The fourth and not the least cause of disturbance is, the unequal
di∣vision of property; for the wealth of a rich empire is circulated in a few
hands, and therefore the governors of provinces are rather inde∣pendent
princes, than subjects of the state."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan begins to re∣dress
grie∣vances.</NOTE>The Sultan approved so much of the remarks of his Omrahs,
that he immediately began to carry into execution the plan which they laid
before him. He first applied himself to a strict inquiry into the
administration of justice; to redress grievances, and to examine
nar∣rowly into the private as well as public characters of all men of rank in
the empire. He laid himself out to procure intelligence of the most
secret discourses of families of note in the city, as well as of every
transaction of moment in the most distant provinces. He executed
justice with such rigour and severity, that robbery and theft, formerly 
<PB N="274" REF="360"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A D. 1300. Higer. 700.</NOTE>so common, were not
heard of in the land. The traveller slept secure upon the public highway,
and the merchant carried his com∣modities in safety from the sea of Bengal
to the mountains of Cabul, and from Tilling to Cashmire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Forbids the use of wine.</NOTE>He published
an edict against the use of wine and strong liquors upon pain of death.
He himself set the example to his subjects, and emptied his cellars in
the street. In this he was followed by all ranks of people, so that, for
some days, the common sewers flowed with wine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prohibits marriages without li∣cence.</NOTE>He
issued out orders that no marriage among the nobility should be ratified
without a special licence from him: that no private meet∣ings or
conversation should be held among the Omrahs, which proved a severe check
to the pleasures of society. This latter order was carried into such
rigorous execution, that no man durst entertain his friends without a written
permission from the vizier.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seizes upon the effects of the wealthy.</NOTE>He
then lengthened the hand of violence upon the rich. He seized upon the
wealth, and confiscated the estates of Mussulmen and Hindoos without
distinction, and by this means he accumulated an immense treasure. Men,
in short, were almost reduced to a level over all the empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuts off fees from the of∣fices.</NOTE>All
emoluments were cut off from the different offices, which were filled with men
whose indigence and dependence rendered them implicitly obedient to the
dictates of government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An equal land tax establish∣ed.</NOTE>He
ordered a tax of half the real annual produce of the lands to be raised over
all the empire, and to be regularly transmitted to the exchequer. He
appointed officers to superintend the collectors, who were to take care that
the Zemindars should take no more from the <PB N="275" REF="361"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A D. 1300. Higer. 700.</NOTE>poor farmers, than in
proportion to the estimate which they had given in of their estates; and in
case of disobedience or neglect, the superintendants were obliged to
refund the overplus, and to pay a fine for the oppression. The farmers, at
the same time, were con∣fined to a certain proportion of land, and to an
appointed number of servants and oxen to cultivate the same. No grazier was
permitted to have above a certain number of cows, sheep and goats, and a tax
was paid out of them to the government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Severity to the officers of the revenue.</NOTE>So
strictly did the Sultan look after the behaviour of the collectors and other
officers of the revenue, that many of them, who formerly kept great retinues,
were obliged to dismiss them, and to have all the menial offices of their
families performed by their wives and children. Neither were they permitted to
resign their employs, till they found others as capable as themselves to
execute the duties of their office.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>These regulations were good, but they were arbitrary and
severe. He broke through all laws and customs, which, according to the
Mahommedan law, were left to the decision of the casis. Other Monarchs left
state affairs to the common course of justice. Alla descended to all
the inferiour departments of government. It was with him a common saying, 
<Q REND="inline">"That religion had no connection with civil
government, but was only the business, or rather amuse∣ment of private
life; and that the will of a wise prince was better than the variable
opinions of bodies of men."</Q></P>

was known to be illiterate, it became a maxim with the learned men at court, to
talk upon no subjects which they knew must be beyond the King's knowledge.
He was however so sensible of the disadvantages which he laboured under
by his ignorance of let∣ters, that he applied himself privately to study,
and soon, notwith∣standing <PB N="276" REF="362"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1303. Higer. 703.</NOTE>the difficulty of
acquiring the knowledge of the Persian manner of writing, which generally
requires ten or twelve years study, he soon read all addresses, and
made himself acquainted with the best authors in the language. After he had
proceeded so far as to be able to hold part in learned discourses, he
encouraged lite∣rary subjects, and showed particular favour to all the
eminent men of that age, particularly to Casi Zea ul dien Molana Zehirling,
to Mo∣lana Murshid Corami and Cuzi Moiz ul dien Biana. He appointed the
last of those learned men to explain the law to him; which he did according
to the true spirit, in every point upon which he was consulted. He did not
however do it without fear and trembling, where it differed from the King's
violent maxims of government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan reduces Chi∣tor.</NOTE>The Sultan,
much about this time, sent an army, by the way of Bengal, to reduce the fort
of Arinkil, which was in the possession of the Raja of Tilling. He
himself moved the royal standard towards Chitor, which had never before
been reduced by the troops of Islam. After a siege of six months he took
the place, in the year 703, con∣ferred the government of it upon his eldest
son Chizer Chan, and called it Chizerabad. He at the same time bestowed
upon Chizer regal dignities and authority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moguls invade
Hin∣dostan.</NOTE>Intelligence of this expedition arriving at Maver ul nere,
Jirghi, who distinguished himself formerly against Ziffer Chan,
thinking that the Sultan would be a long time absent, seized that
opportunity for invading Hindostan. Alla hearing of this dangerous inroad,
abandoned all his schemes against the Decan, and made what haste he could
with his army to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They ad∣vance to∣wards Delhi,</NOTE>Jirghi, with
twelve tomans of Mogul horse, approached, in a few days, the city, and
encamped upon the banks of the Jumna. The horse of the imperial army being
absent on the expedition to <PB N="277" REF="363"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1303. Higer. 703.</NOTE>Arinkil, the Sultan
was in no condition to face, upon equal terms, so powerful and warlike an
enemy in the field. He therefore con∣tented himself with entrenching his army
in the plain beyond the suburbs, till he could draw the forces of the
distant Subas together. But the Moguls having the command of the adjacent
country, pre∣vented the succours from joining the Sultan, and proceeded so
far as to plunder the suburbs, in the King's presence, without his being
able to prevent them.</P>
<P>In this situation stood affairs for two months; and then the
Sul∣tan, say some authors, had recourse to supernatural aid. He
ap∣plied to a saint of those days, whose name was Shech Nizam ul dien
Aulia. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">but retreat.</NOTE>The saint, in one night,
without any visible cause, struck the Mogul army with a panic which
occasioned their precipitate retreat to their own country. But we have no
reason to ascribe the flight of the Moguls to so weak and
superstitious a cause; as pri∣vate order, intelligence, or the
improbability of success, brought about their sudden departure more than
the power of the saint. The Sultan, during this alarming period, was heard to
confess, that his ideas of universal conquest were idle and ridiculous,
for that there were many heads in the world as hard as his own.</P>
<P>Alla being relieved from the perils of this invasion, built a
palace upon the spot where he had entrenched himself, and ordered the
citadel of Delhi to be pulled down and built anew. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alla levies a great army.</NOTE>He then began to
recruit his army, with an intention to retaliate upon the Moguls their repeated
inroads. He encreased his forces to such a prodigious number, that upon
calculating the expence, he found his revenues, and what treasures he had
himself, could not support them above six years. He resolved therefore
to reduce the pay, but it occurred to him that this could not be done with
propriety, with∣out lowering proportionably, the price of horses, arms and
pro∣visions. <PB N="278" REF="364"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1303. Higer. 703.</NOTE>This he did by an
edict which he strictly enforced all over the empire, settling the price of
every article at about half the com∣mon rate, which in fact, was just
doubling his treasure and revenues.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The prices of grain regu∣lated;</NOTE>To
establish this reduction of the price, with respect to grain, he ordered
great magazines to be built upon the rivers Jumna and Ganges, and other places
convenient for water carriage, under the di∣rection of Malleck Cabuli. This
collector received half of the land tax in grain; and the royal agents
supplied the markets at a stated price. To prevent any monopoly in this
article, every farmer was allowed to retain only a certain quantity, according
to the number of his family, and send the overplus, as soon as it was
threshed out, to market, for which he was obliged to take the standing
price. The importation of grain was encouraged; but to export it or any other
article of provisions, was a capital crime. The King himself had a daily
report laid before him, of the quantity sold and remaining in the seve∣ral
royal granaries, and spies were appointed in the different markets, to inform
him of abuses, which he punished with the utmost rigour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and of cloth.</NOTE>The Sultan also appointed a
public office, and inspectors, who fixed the price of the various kinds of
cloth, according to its quality, obliging the merchants to open their shops
at certain hours every day, and sell their goods at the stipulated price.
He at the same time opened a loan, by which they were enabled to procure
ready money to import cloth from the neighbouring countries, where the poverty
of the people rendered their manufactures cheaper. But what is some∣what
unaccountable, the exportation of the finer kind of manufacture was prohibited,
yet not permitted to be worn at home, except by special authority from the
King, which favour was only conferred upon men of rank.</P>
<P> <PB N="279" REF="365"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1303. Higer. 703.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of horses.</NOTE>As horses had arose to an immense price,
by an association of the dealers, who only bought up a certain number from
the Persian and northern merchants to inhance the price; the King published
an edict, by which they were obliged to register the prices paid for them,
and to sell them at a certain profit within such a time, if that price was
offered them, otherwise the King took them upon his own account. The price of
the horse was at the same time according to his quality, and care was
taken, by that means, that the merchants and dealers in those animals
should not have an opportunity, by secret con∣nivance, to raise the
price. Many frauds being found out in this article some time after, a great
number of horse dealers were whipt out of the city, and others put to death.
Oxen, sheep, goats, camels, and asses, were also taken into
consideration; and in short every useful animal, and all commodities,
were sold at a stated price in the Bazars.</P>
<P>The Sultan having thus regulated the prices of things, his next care
was to new model his army. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settles the pay of the army.</NOTE>He settled
the pay of every horse∣man, for himself and horse, from 234 rupees a
year, down to 80, according to the goodness of the horse; and, upon a
muster, he found his cavalry to consist of four hundred and
seventy-five thousand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moguls invading Hindostan are
over∣thrown.</NOTE>In the mean time Ali Beg, the grandson of Chingez Chan,
and Jirpal Chaja, with forty thousand horse, made an irruption into
Hin∣dostan, but the Sultan sending Malleck Tughlick, with a force against
them, they were defeated, with the loss of seven thousand. Ali Beg, and
Jirpal, with nine thousand of their troops, were taken prisoners. They were
sent in chains to the Sultan, who ordered the chiefs to be thrown under the
feet of an elephant, and the soldiers to be inhumanly massacred. He
appointed Tughlick, for this service, viceroy of Punjab.</P>
<P>Alip Chan was about this time appointed Amir ul Omrah of Gu∣zerat,
and sent thither with a great force. Ain ul Muluck Moultani, 
<PB N="280" REF="366"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1304. Higer. 704.</NOTE>an Omrah of great
fame, was at the same time ordered with a numerous army to the conquest of
Malava. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malava re∣duced.</NOTE>He was opposed by Kokah,
the Raja, with forty thousand Rajaput horse, and one hundred thousand
foot. An engagement ensued, in which Ain ul Muluck proved victorious, and
took the cities of Ugein, Mandu, Daranagurri, and Chanduri. He, after these
successes, dispatched a Fatte Namma<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A writing

seven days throughout the city of Delhi. Kuntir Deo, the governor of the fort
of Jallore, terrified by the conquests of Ain ul Muluck, gave up that place
upon terms of capitulation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Raja of Chitor makes his escape,</NOTE>The
Raja of Chitor, who had been prisoner since the Emperor took that place,
found in the mean time means to make his escape, in a very extraordinary
manner. The Sultan having heard extravagant things in praise of the beauty
and accomplishments of one of the Raja's daughters, told him, that if he
would send her, he should, upon her account, be released.</P>
<P>The Raja, who was very ill treated in his confinement, consented,
and sent for his daughter with a manifest design to prostitute her to
the King. The Raja's family hearing this dishonourable proposal, concerted
means of poisoning the Raja to save their own reputation. But the daughter
being a girl of invention, proposed a stratagem to release her father,
and at the same time to save her own honour. She accordingly wrote to her
father to give out, that she was coming with all her attendants, and would be
at Delhi upon a certain day, acquainting him with the part she intended to
act. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">by the con∣trivance of his daughter.</NOTE>Her
contrivance was this: She selected a number of enterprising fellows, who in
compleat armour, concealed themselves in doolies or close chairs, in which
the women are always carried; she provided for them a chosen retinue of
horse and foot, as is customary to guard ladies of <PB N="281" REF="367"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1305. Higer. 705.</NOTE>rank. She herself,
by this time, had, by her father's means, re∣ceived the Sultan's passport,
and the whole cavalcade proceeded to Delhi, and were admitted without
interruption. It was now night, and by the Sultan's permission, they were
permitted to see the Raja. The chairs being carried into the prison, and
the attendants having taken their stations without; the armed men started
out of the chairs, and putting all to the sword within the courts, carried
the Raja out, and having horses prepared for him, he mounted, and with his
attendants, rushed out of the city, before any opposition could be made,
and fled to his own country.</P>
<P>In the year 705, Kabeik, an Omrah of Dova Chan, King of Ma∣ver ul
nere, with design to revenge the death of Ali Beg and Jir∣pal, invaded
Hindostan with a great army, and ravaging Moultan, proceeded to Sewalic. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moguls overthrown.</NOTE>Malleck Tughlick, in
the mean time, col∣lecting his forces, cut off the retreat of the Moguls,
before any troops arrived from Delhi, and defeated them with great slaughter.
Those who escaped the sword, finding it impossible to force their way
home, retired into the desart, where thirst and the hot winds which blow at
that season, put an end to their miserable lives; so that out of fifty
seven thousand horse, besides their attendants, who were still more
numerous, only three thousand, who were taken prisoners, survived this
horrid scene. The unhappy captives were only reserved for greater misery.
They were sent to Delhi with their unfortunate chief, Kabeik, where they were
all trodden to death by elephants, except some women and children, who were
sold in the market for slaves.</P>
<P>These repeated misfortunes did not however discourage the
Mo∣guls. Aekbalmund, a chief of great reputation, soon after invaded
Hindostan with a powerful army. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moguls again over∣thrown.</NOTE>But Malleck

forward, took possession of the Moguls, and they gave over all thoughts
of Hindostan for many years. They were even hard pressed to defend
themselves: for Malleck Tugh∣lick made incursions into their country every
year, plundering the provinces of Cabul, Ghizni, Candahar, and Garrimsere, or
laying them under heavy contributions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan busy in set∣tling the po∣lice of

ascribed his success to supernatural power, amazed at the good effects
that flowed from the strictness of his government.</P>
<P>Ram Deo, Raja of Deogire in the Decan, having neglected to send
the revenues of that district, which he assigned over to the Sul∣tan by
treaty, Malleck Cafoor, with many Omrahs of renown, and a great army was
ordered to conquer the Decan. This Cafoor was one of the Sultan's catamites,
and originally a slave, taken by force from a merchant of Guzerat, as we have
already mentioned. The Emperor's affection for Cafoor exceeded all the bounds
of decency and prudence upon the present occasion. He gave him the title of
Malleck Naib Cafoor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, a viceroy; with all the

their respects to him every day, as to a sovereign. This created among them
great disgust, but they durst not murmur. Chaja Hadjee was appointed his
lieutenant; a man much esteemed in those days, for his good principles. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The imperial army invades the Decan.</NOTE>In the

this demand. Mal∣leck Cafoor therefore marched from his camp at Nidderbar,
while Alip Chan, with his forces from Guzerat, was taking the rout of the

mar∣riage.</NOTE>Singeldeo, the son of Ram Deo, Raja of Deogire, who had been
contracted to the young Dewildè, without consent of his father, sent
his brother Bimedeo with presents to Raja Kirren, perswading him, that as
Dewildè was the occasion of the war, if he should deliver her over
to him, the troops of Islam, in despair of obtaining their ends, would
return to their own country. Raja Kirren, who depended much upon the young
prince's aid, consented to this pro∣posal, and gave his daughter, then in
her thirteenth year, in mar∣riage to Singeldeo.</P>

seconded the attempt. He then entered the mountains with his army, and
engaging the Raja, gave him a total defeat; upon which, Kirren fled to Deogire,
leaving all his elephants, tents and equipage upon the field. Alip Chan
pur∣sued him through the hills for some days, but at length, entirely
lost his track and all intelligence concerning him and his daughter. But in
the end, accident threw this pearl in his way.</P>
<P>Halting to refresh his army two days among the mountains, some
of his troops, without leave, to the number of three hundred, went from the
camp to see a famous mountain in the neighbourhood of Deogire, from which
city he was not then far distant. In their excursion they saw a great
troop of horse, whom they apprehended to belong to Ramdeo, and to be in
pursuit of them. As there was no safety in flight, they were determined to
stand on their defence, and accordingly drew up to receive the enemy. This
troop proved to be the retinue of Bimedeo, who was carrying the young bride to
his brother.

parties, in short, engaged, and the Hindoos were put to flight, while an
unfortunate arrow having pierced the horse of Dewildè, the unhappy
fair one was abandoned in the field. The conquerors seeing her, gathered
round her horse, and commenced a bloody scuffle about the prize. This might
have proved fatal to the beau∣tiful Dewildè, had not one of her female
slaves told aloud her name and quality, conjuring them to carry her to their
commander with that respect which was due to her rank and sex. Upon hearing
this they knew the peril of treating her with any indignity; and while an
express was dispatched with the news to Alip Chan, they con∣ducted her with
great care and respect to the camp.</P>

prose∣cuted his conquests no further, but returned to Guzerat, and from
thence carried Dewildè to Delhi, and presented her to her mother. In a
few days her beauty inflamed the heart of the Sultan's eldest son Chizer
Chan, to whom she was given in marriage. The history of the loves of this
illustrious pair, is wrote in an elegant poem, by Amir Chusero.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cafoor's transactions in the Decan.</NOTE>Let
us now return to Malleck Naib Cafoor, whom we left enter∣ing the Decan. He
first subdued the country of the Mahrattors, which he divided among his
Omrahs, then proceeded to the siege of Deo∣gire, since known by the name of
Dowlat-abad. Ramdeo being in no condition to oppose this great army,
prudently left his son Sin∣geldeo in the fort, and advanced himself, with
great presents, to the conqueror, to procure peace, which was accordingly
settled between them. Malleck Cafoor, upon this, wrote a Fatee Namma to the
King, and some time after brought Ramdeo, with rich presents and
seventeen elephants, to pay his allegiance to him at Delhi, where he
himself was received with the most extravagant marks of favour and
distinction. Ramdeo had royal dignities conferred upon him, with the title of
Rai Raian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince of Princes.</NOTE>, and had not only
the government of his own dominions restored to him, but others were also
added, for all which he did homage, and paid tribute to the Sultan. The King
moreover gave him the district of Nosari, near Guzerat, by way of Jagier,
and a lack of rupees to bear his expences home. Thus he dismissed Ramdeo
with princely generosity; having, in some measure, looked upon the
wealth, of which he had formerly robbed him, as the foundation of all his own
greatness. And he perhaps <PB N="286" REF="372"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1306. Higer. 706.</NOTE>thought that some
grateful return was due to the Raja upon this account.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan besieges and takes
Sewana.</NOTE>During the absence of Cafoor on his expedition to the Decan,
the King employed himself in taking a strong fort to the southward of
Delhi, called Sewana, which had often been attempted in vain. When Jilleldeo
the Raja of this place found he could hold out no longer, he sent his own
image, which had been cast in pure gold, to the Sultan, with a chain round
its neck, in token of obedience. This present was accompanied by a hundred
elephants, and other precious effects, in hopes of procuring peace. The Sultan
received the presents, but returned him for answer, that unless he came
and made his submission in person, he could hope little from his dumb
representative. The Raja finding the Sultan inexorable, threw himself upon
his mercy, and delivered up the place. The Sultan plundered and again
restored it. But he alienated a great part of the Raja's country to his
favourite Omrahs, and bound him over to pay homage for the rest. The Sultan
then proceeded to Jallire, which he took, and returned to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cafoor marches to∣wards Arin∣kil.</NOTE>The
Sultan, much about this time, was informed that the expe∣dition, by the way of
Bengal, to Arinkil in the country of Tilling, had not succeeded, and that his
army on that side had been obliged to retreat in great distress. In the
year 709, he dispatched Malleck Cafoor with a great force to invade that
country, by the way of Deogire; with orders, that if Lidder Deo, Prince of
Arinkil, should consent to give him a handsome present, and promise
an annual tri∣bute, to return without prosecuting the war any further. When
Malleck Cafoor and Chaja Hadjee had reached Deogire, Ram Deo came out to meet
them with offerings, and carrying them home, entertained them with great
hospitality, ordering his Bazar to the camp, with strict orders to sell
every thing according to the Sultan's established price in his own
dominions.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1307. Higer. 707.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Enters Til∣ling.</NOTE>Cafoor having marched from Deogire,
appeared at Indore, upon the frontiers of Tilling, and issued orders to lay
waste the country with fire and sword; which struck the unhappy people,
who had never injured their wanton enemies, with great terror and
conster∣nation. In the mean time, the neighbouring Rajas hastened with all
their forces to support Lidderdeo, in this alarming juncture. But as the
imperial army proceeded with great expedition, he was forced, before the
arrival of his allies, to shut himself up in the fort of Arinkil, which was
a place of great strength. The allied Rajas, upon this, also took
possession of divers strong holds round the country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Besieges and takes Arinkil.</NOTE>Malleck
Cafoor immediately invested the place, and began his attacks, which were
carried on and repelled with great slaughter on both sides.
Notwithstanding the interruptions that Cafoor received from the Rajas without
the place, Arinkil, after some months siege, was taken by assault, and
the garrison massacred without mercy, for the citadel to which Lidderdeo
had retired, was not sufficient to contain the whole. Lidderdeo, driven to
this extremity, bought his peace with three hundred elephants, seven
thousand horses, and money and jewels to a very great amount; agreeing at
the same time, to pay an annual tribute. Malleck Cafoor, after this
advan∣tageous peace, returned with his army to Delhi. He dispatched before
him the news of his victories, which was read from the pulpit, and a public
rejoicing ordered. Upon his approach to the city, the King himself came out
and met him at the Budaoon gate, and there the conqueror laid all the spoils
at his feet.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cafoor's ex∣pedition to the Decan.</NOTE>In the
year 710, The Sultan sent Malleck Cafoor and Chaja Hajee with a great army,
to reduce Dhoor, Summund and Maber in the Decan, where he had heard, there were
temples very rich in gold and jewels. When they had proceeded to Deogire, they
found that <PB N="288" REF="374"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1310. Higer. 710.</NOTE>Ram Deo the old Raja
was dead, and that the young Raja, Singel∣deo, was not so well affected to
them as they thought. They therefore left some Omrahs in a strong post
upon the banks of the Ganges, and continued their march. When they had
passed the Raja's territories, they began their inhuman cruelties, and
after three months march from Delhi, arrived in the countries which they were
commanded to subdue. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Raja of the Carnatic overthrown.</NOTE>They
engaged Bellal Deo, Raja of the Carnatic, and defeating him, took him
prisoner, and then ravaged his whole country. They found in the temples,
prodigious spoils in idols of gold, adorned with the most precious
stones; and other rich effects, consecrated to their worship. Here the
conqueror built a small mosque, and ordered divine service to be read
according to the Mahommedan faith, and the Chutba to be pronounced in the
Em∣peror's name. This mosque remains intire in our days, for the Caffers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Mahommedans give the name of Cassers or Infidels to

opposite lights, and is perfectly consistent with the principle of the
universal charity of the Hindoos, who think that the same God is the object
of all religions, however much they may differ in ceremonies and
tenets.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An immense treasure
dis∣covered.</NOTE>Malleck Naib Cafoor having wearied his own inhumanity and
avarice, in destroying and robbing an unfortunate people, resolved to
return to Delhi with his spoils. The night before his intended march, a
quarrel arose among some Brahmins who had taken pro∣tection in his camp
from the plundering parties that scoured the country. Some body who
understood their language, found the quarrel was about the division of
some hidden treasure, which was immediately communicated to the Cutwal, who
seized them and carried them to Malleck Cafoor to be examined. They were at 
<PB N="289" REF="375"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1311. Higer. 711.</NOTE>first very
obstinate, but their lives being threatened, and each being questioned
apart, they were afraid one would inform against the other, by which means
they discovered all they knew. Seven dif∣ferent places were pointed out near
the camp, where immense trea∣sures were concealed. These being dug up and
placed upon ele∣phants, Malleck Cafoor turned the points of his spears to
Delhi, where he arrived without any remarkable occurrence, in the year 711. He
presented the Sultan with 312 elephants, 20,000 horses, 96,000 maunds of
gold, several chests of jewels and pearls, and other precious things<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This treasure may appear to exceed all belief in the eyes of
Europeans: But if we consider the Hindoos as a mercantile people, and not
disturbed perhaps by wars for thousands of years; and add to this, that it
is the invariable custom of that race, to live with the abstinence of
hermits in the midst of wealth, our wonder will cease, and the credit of
our author remain intire. The gold alone amounts to about one hundred millions
of our money.</NOTE>. The Sultan upon seeing this treasure, which exceeded
that of Baadawird or Pirvez, was greatly rejoiced, and opened the doors of his
bounty to all. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The genero∣sity of the Sultan.</NOTE>He gave to
each of the principal Omrahs ten maunds, and to the inferior five. The learned
men of his court received one maund, and thus in proportion, he distributed
wealth to all his servants, according to their rank and quality. The
remainder was melted down, coined and lodged in the treasury. It is said,
that during this expedition to the Carnatic, the soldiers threw the silver
they found away, as too cumbersome, where gold was found in such plenty. No
person wore bracelets, chains, or rings of any other metal than gold, while
all the plate in the houses of the great, and in the temples, was of bea∣ten
gold; neither was silver money at all current in that country, should we
believe the reports of those adventurers.</P>
<P>Soon after this accession of wealth, the tyrannical Alla
exhibited a scene in the capital too dreadful to be varnished over by his
great <PB N="290" REF="376"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1311. Higer. 711.</NOTE>abilities. The Mogul
converts in his army having incurred his dis∣pleasure, he ordered them to
be all discharged. Some of them engaged themselves in the service of the
Omrahs, but the greater number re∣mained at Delhi in great distress, in
hopes that the Sultan would relent by seeing their wretched poverty. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His inhuma∣nity to the Mogul
mer∣cenaries.</NOTE>He however remained ob∣durate, and some daring fellows
among them, forced by their mis∣fortunes, entered into a conspiracy to
murder the King. This plot being discovered, the Sultan, instead of
punishing the conspirators, extended his inhuman rigour to the whole body.
He ordered them all to be instantly put to the sword; so that fifteen
thousand of those unhappy wretches lay dead in the streets of Delhi in
one day. All their wives and children were enslaved. The Sultan was so
inexorable and vindictive, that no one durst attempt to conceal, however
nearly connected they might be, any of the unfortunate Moguls, so that not
one of them escaped.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His pride and magificence.</NOTE>The King,
elevated by his good fortune, gave himself over to pride. He listened to no
advice, as he sometimes condescended to do in the beginning of his reign,
but every thing was executed by his irrevocable word. Yet the empire never
flourished so much as in this reign. Order and justice travelled to the
most distant provinces, and magnificence raised her head in the land.
Palaces, mosques, uni∣versities, baths, spires, forts, and all manner of
public and pri∣vate buildings seemed to rise, as by the power of
enchantment, neither did there in any age appear such a concourse of
learned men from all parts. Forty five skilled in the sciences were
professors in the universities. In poetry, Amir Chusero and Chaja
Hassen Delavi held the first rank. In philosophy and physic, Molana
Buddir ul dien Damiski. In divinity, Molana Shatabi. In astrology, Shech
Nizam ul dien Awlia acquired much fame. Others distinguished themselves
in music, morality, languages, and in all the fine arts then known in the
world.</P>
<P> <PB N="291" REF="377"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1311. Higer. 711.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">His impolitic proceedings.</NOTE>But when the Sultan seemed to
have carried every thing to the heighth of perfection, and to the extent of his
wishes, he all at once adopted every measure that evidently tended to
subvert the great fabrick which he had raised. He resigned the reins of
government intirely into the hands of Malleck Cafoor, whom he blindly
sup∣ported in his most impolitic and tyrannical actions. This gave great
disgust to the Omrahs, and spread universal discontent over the face
of the people. He neglected the education of his own chil∣dren, who were let
out of the seraglio when very young, and in∣trusted with independant power.
Chizer Chan was made viceroy of Chitor when as yet a boy, without any person
of wisdom to advise him or to superintend his conduct, while Shadi Chan,
Mubarick Chan and Shab ul dien Chan, his other sons, had appointments of the
same important nature.</P>
<P>The Raja of Tilling, about this time, sent some presents and
twenty elephants to the King, with a letter, informing him that the tribute
which he had agreed to pay in his treaty with Mal∣leck Cafoor, was ready to be
paid. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malleck Ca∣foor proposes an expedition to the
Decan.</NOTE>Malleck Cafoor, upon this, desired leave of the King, to make
another expedition into the Decan, promising that he would, not only collect
the revenues which had fallen due, but bring the Raja of Deogire and others,
who had with-held their allegiance and tribute, under due sub∣jection. He was
principally moved to this by his jealousy of Chizer Chan, the declared heir
to the empire, whose government lay most convenient for that expedition;
and whom he feared the Sultan in∣tended to send.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He enters the Decan and reduces it.</NOTE>The
Sultan consented to Cafoor's proposal, and he accordingly proceeded the
fourth time to the Decan with a great army. He seized the Raja of Deogire,
and inhumanly put him to death; then ravaging the countries of Mahrat, Connir,
Dabul, Giwil, Raijore <PB N="292" REF="378"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1312. Higer. 712.</NOTE>and Mudkil, took up
his residence at Deogire. He raised the tri∣bute from the Rajas of Tilling
and the Carnatic, and in the year 712, dispatched the whole to the
Emperor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King falls sick.</NOTE>The Sultan by this
time, by his intemperance in the seraglio, ruined his constitution, and was
taken extremely ill. His wife Mallecke Jehan and her son Chizer Chan,
neglected him entirely, and spent their time in riot and revelry, which added
new strength to the King's disorder. He therefore ordered Malleck Cafoor
from the Decan, and Alip Chan from Guzerat. He told them in private of the
unpolitic, undutiful and cruel behaviour of his wife and son. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malleck Ca∣foor aspires to the
throne.</NOTE>Cafoor, who had before aspired, in his mind, to the empire, now
began seriously to form schemes for the extirpation of the royal line.
He, for this purpose, insinuated to the King, that Chizer Chan, Mallecke
Jehan and Alip Chan had conspired against his life. What gave colour to
this wicked accusation was, that at this time, Mallecke Jehan sollicited
the Sultan to get one of Alip Chan's daughters for her son Shadi Chan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts
against Chizer Chan,</NOTE>This traitor did not fail to improve this
circumstance to his own advantage. The King at length suffered
suspicion to steal into his breast, and ordered Chizer Chan to Amrohe,
and there to continue till he himself should recover. Though Chizer Chan
was mad with the follies of youth, this command of his father made a deep
impression on his mind, and at his departure he made a private vow, that if
God should spare the life of his father, he would return all the way on
foot. When he accordingly heard that his father's health began to return, he
performed his vow, and waited upon him at Delhi.</P>
<P>The traitor Cafoor turned this filial piety entirely against
Chizer. He insinuated that his behaviour, by such a sudden change, could
be imputed to nothing but hypocrisy, and urged his disobedience, by coming
without his father's leave, pretending, at the same time, that 
<PB N="293" REF="379"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1312. Higer. 712.</NOTE>he was intriguing
with the Omrahs, about kindling a rebellion in the Empire. The Sultan could not
give entire credit to these insinu∣ations. He sent for Chizer Chan into
his presence, embraced him to try his affection, and seeing him weep,
seemed convinced of his sincerity, and ordered him into the Seraglio, to
see his mother and sisters. But unhappily for this Prince, the flights of
his youth made him deviate again into his former wild amusements. He
neglected for several days to visit his father; during which time his
subtle ene∣my bribed over to his own interest the Sultan's private
servants, and called upon them to witness his aspersions against
Chizer. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">who is im∣prisoned.</NOTE>He at length, by a
thousand wiles and stratagems, accomplished his pur∣pose, and prevailed
upon the King to imprison his two sons Chizer Chan and Shadi Chan, in the
fort of Gualier, and their mother in the old citadel. He at the same time
procured an order to seize Aliph Chan, who was unjustly put to death, and
his brother Nizam ul dien, Suba of Jallore, was assassinated by Seid
Cummal ul dien Car∣rick, who assumed his place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disturbances in the em∣pire.</NOTE>Thus far the
traitor's schemes advanced in the direct road of suc∣cess. But now the
fire which had long been smothered, began to flame, kindling first at
Guzerat into a general insurrection. The Sultan, to suppress this
rebellion, sent Cumal ul dien Currik thither with a great army; but the
forces commanded by the friends of Alip Chan defeated him with great
slaughter, and put him to a cruel death. In the mean time the Suba of Chitor
threw the Sultan's offi∣cers over the wall, and assumed independence; while
Hirpal Deo, the son in law of Ramdeo, stirred up the Decan to arms, and
took a number of the Sultan's garrisons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan dies.</NOTE>Alla ul dien, upon
receiving this intelligence, could do nothing but bite his own flesh, in
resentment. His grief and rage served to strengthen his disorder, which
would yield to no power of medicine. <PB N="294" REF="380"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1316. Higer. 716.</NOTE>On the evening of

months.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His character.</NOTE>If we look upon the

behold his hands, which are red, an inexorable tyrant appears. Had he come by
better means to the throne, his abilities deserved it well; but he began in
cruelty, and waded through blood to the end. Ambition was the favourite
passion of his soul, and from it sprung forth like branches,
injustice, violence, and rapine. Had fortune placed him at first on high,
his glory would not perhaps be tarnished with meanness and deceit; but in
whatever way that flame was to pass through the world, his tract, like that
of a storm, must have been marked with ruin. He had some right as a
warrior, to the title of Secunder Sani; but these two Princes resembled one
another in nothing but in success and bravery. The first was polished
and generous, the latter was dark and rude. They were both magnificent, and
each of them might conquer the world, and could command it. The servants of
his household amounted to seventeen thousand, and his pomp, wealth and

appointed Shab ul dien, the youngest son, his successor, and Cufoor
himself regent, during his minority, setting aside the right of

which perhaps had more influence than his intreaties, he gave it them. They
immediately abandoned their purpose; but quarrelling about the division of
the jewels, when they had got out, it was proposed to carry them to the chief

their instructions, from Malleck Cafoor.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan affects popu∣larity.</NOTE>The Sultan,
whether to affect popularity, or in remembrance of his late situation,
ordered all the prisons to be opened, by which <PB N="298" REF="384"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1317. Higer. 717.</NOTE>means seventeen
thousand were blessed with the light of day, and all the exiles were by
proclamation recalled. He then commanded to give to the army a present of
six months pay, and conferred upon many, other private benefits. He at the
same time issued orders to give free access to all petitioners. He
eased the petitioners of some of their taxes; but by too much relaxing the
reins of govern∣ment, disorder and tumult arose, which threw down to the
ground the great fabrick raised by Alla ul dien. He gave himself up
entirely to wine, revelry, and lust. These vices became fashionable at
court, from whence the whole body of the people were soon infected.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Guzerat re∣duced.</NOTE>Mubarick, in the first
year of his reign, sent an army under the command of Ain ul Mulluck Moultani,
into the province of Guze∣rat, which had revolted. Moultani was an Omrah of
great repu∣tation. He soon defeated the insurgents, cut off their chiefs,
and settled the country in peace. The King conferred the government of
Guzerat upon Ziffer Chan, whose daughter he had taken in mar∣riage. Ziffer
Chan soon after marched his army to Narwalla, the capital of Guzerat, where
some disturbances had happened, reduced the rebels, confiscated their
estates, and sent their moveable wealth to the King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mubarick re∣duces the Decan.</NOTE>Mubarick Shaw,
in the second year of his reign, raised a great army, and marched towards
the Decan, to chastise Hirpaldeo, the son in law of Ramdeo, who, by the
assistance of the other Rajas of the Decan, had recovered his country.
The Sultan at his departure appointed Shahin, the son of a slave, to whom
he gave the title of Offa Beg, governor of Delhi, during his absence. When he
arrived near Deogire, Hirpaldeo and the other Rajas, who were then be∣sieging
the place, fled. But some Omrahs being ordered to pursue Hirpaldeo, he was
brought back prisoner, flead alive and beheaded. His head was fixed above the
gate of his own capital. The Sultan <PB N="299" REF="385"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1318. Higer. 718.</NOTE>ordered his
garrisons to be re-established as far as the sea, and built a mosque
in Deogire, which still remains. He then appointed Mal∣leck Ecklikki, one of
his father's slaves, to command in the Decan. He, in imitation of his father,
gave his catamite Chusero Chan the ensigns of royalty, sending him
towards Malbar, with part of his army, then returned himself to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A conspiracy.</NOTE>Malleck Assid ul dien,
son to the Sultan's grand uncle, seeing the King daily drunk, and negligent
of all the duties of a king or commander, began to entertain thoughts of the
empire, and formed a conspiracy against his life. This plot however was
discovered by one of the conspirators, and Assid ul dien was condemned
to death. Whether Mubarick had found proofs that his brothers were concerned in
this conspiracy, we cannot learn, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan's cruelty.</NOTE>but at that time he
sent an assassin to Gualier, and these two unfortunate blind
princes were inhumanly murdered, and the fair Dewildè brought to the
royal Haram.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe∣ror abandons himself to every
species of vice.</NOTE>Mubarick finding himself in quiet possession
of all the kingdoms of Hindostan, abandoned those popular manners which he
at first affected, and grew perverse, proud, vindictive, and tyrannical,
de∣spising all counsel, ill treating all his friends, and executing every
thing, however bloody or unjust, by his obstinate, blind, arbitrary will.
Ziffer Chan, Suba of Guzerat, among others, fell a victim to his tyranny, as
also Offa Beg, upon whom he had heaped such fa∣vours, without any
plausible pretences against either. He was infa∣mous, in short, in every
vice that can taint the human mind, and descended so far from the royal
character, as to dress himself often like a common prostitute, and go
with the public women to dance at the houses of the nobility. At other times
he would lead a gang of those abominable prostitutes stark naked along
the terraces of the royal palaces, and make them play their fountains upon the
Omrahs <PB N="300" REF="386"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1318. Higer. 718.</NOTE>as they entered the
court. These and such other vices and indecen∣cies, too shocking to
mention, were the constant amusements of this monster in the form of
man.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several insur∣rections quashed.</NOTE>After
the death of Ziffer Chan, Hissam ul dien, uncle to Chusero Chan, who was
also one of the Sultan's catamites, in the absence of the detestable
slave, obtained the regency of Guzerat, where he had not been established
long, till, in confederacy with a few Omrahs, he rebelled; but the other Omrahs
of Guzerat rising in arms, defeat∣ed him, and sent him prisoner to Delhi,
where he was not only par∣doned, but permitted to resume his place in the
King's favour; Mal∣leck Odgi ul dien Toureshi being sent to Guzerat in his
stead. About this time news arrived, that Malleck Ecklikki, governor of the
Decan, had rebelled. The Sultan sent a great army to suppress that
insurrection, who found means to seize the rebel and his principal
adherents, and to send them to Delhi, where Malleck Ecklikki had his ears cut
off, and the others were put to the torture. Ain ul Mal∣leck Moultani was
advanced to the viceroyship of the Decan.</P>
<P>Chusero Chan, who had gone to Malbar, stayed there about one
year. He plundered the country of about one hundred and twenty elephants, a
perfect diamond of 168 Ruttys, with other jewels and gold, to a great amount. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chusero Chan aspires to the throne.</NOTE>His
ambition was increased by his wealth, and he began to aspire to the throne.
Not being able to join to his interest any of the Omrahs of his army, he
formed the means of their destruction. For this purpose he called Malleck
Tilbigha from the government of the island of Koohe, Malleck Timur and
Malleck Mullhe Affghan, who were on different services, and gave out that he
had orders to return to Delhi. These Omrahs having intelligence of his
intentions, disobeyed his commands, and wrote a remonstrance to the Sultan,
accusing Chusero Chan of conspiracy against the state. The Sultan, 
<PB N="301" REF="387"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1319. Higer. 719.</NOTE>on this, ordered
them to seize him and send him prisoner to Delhi, which accordingly they
found means to execute. But when he came before the King, he pleaded his own
innocence so artfully, and blamed his accusers with such plausibility
of truth, that the Sultan believing the whole proceeded from the disgust of
their being com∣manded by his favourite, he recalled them; and
notwithstanding they gave undoubted proofs of their assertions, the
Sultan was de∣termined to listen to nothing against this vile catamite. He
disho∣noured them, confiscated all their estates, turned them out to
poverty and the world. The other Omrahs seeing that the enemies of Chusero
Chan, right or wrong, were devoted to destruction, the men of the best
principles among them made excuses, and obtained leave to retire to distant
parts of the empire: while the abandoned to all honour, joined themselves to
the catamite, who was now the object of universal dread, as well as the
source of all benefits and promotion. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chusero con∣tinues his de∣signs.</NOTE>This
slave, in the mean time, cherished his own ambitious views, and began again
to form measures for his own advancement.</P>
<P>To accomplish his purpose, he told the King, 
<Q REND="inline">"That as his own fidelity and services had been by
his Majesty so generously re∣warded, and as he might still have
occasion for them in the conduct of his military affairs, while the Omrahs,
from the pride of family, were seditious and disobedient to his commands,
he begged that he might be permitted to call some of his relations from
Guzerat, in whom he could more certainly confide."</Q> The Sultan agreed to
this request; and Chusero Chan sent a great sum of money by some of
his agents to Guzerat, who collected about twenty thousand of the dregs of
the people, and brought them to Delhi. Every place of profit and trust were
conferred upon those vermin, which bound them fast to Chusero's
interest; and also upon all the <PB N="302" REF="388"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1320. Higer. 720.</NOTE>villains about the
city, who were remarkable for their boldness and address.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspires a∣gainst the Sultan's
life.</NOTE>The Sultan, in the mean time, going to hunt towards Jirsava, a
plot was formed to assassinate him. But this was laid aside, on
account of some difference in opinion among the conspirators: and therefore
they resolved to perform their tragedy in the palace. The Sultan returned to
Delhi, and, according to custom, gave himself up to his debaucheries.
Chusero Chan was warm in his project, and took the opportunity of a
favourable hour to beg leave of Muba∣rick to entertain his friends in the outer
court of the palace. The Sultan not only consented, but issued orders, to
give them free access at all times; by which means the courts of the palace
became crouded with those vermin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan informed of the plot.</NOTE>In the
mean time, Casi Zea ul dien, who was famous for his skill in astrology,
though upon this occasion, we imagine, he consulted his own judgment and
not the stars, ran into the presence and kissed the ground. 
<Q REND="inline">"O King,"</Q> said he, 
<Q REND="inline">"Chusero Chan is concerning means for your
assassination. If this should prove false his honesty will be the
better established; if otherwise, caution is necessary, because
life is the most inestimable jewel."</Q> The Sultan smiled at the old
man, who had been one of his preceptors, and told him, he would make enquiry
into that affair: while instantly Chusero Chan entered in a female dress,
with all the affectations of a girl. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His infatua∣tion.</NOTE>The Sultan upon seeing
the infamous catamite, repeated a verse to this effect. 
<Q REND="inline">"If my beloved were guilty of ten thousand crimes,
one smile from him and I forget them all."</Q> He then embraced Chusero,
and actually did forget all that the Casi had said.</P>
<P>That night, as the Casi was suspicious of treason, he could
not go to rest, but walked out about midnight, to see whether the guards
were <PB N="303" REF="389"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1321. Higer. 721.</NOTE>watchful. In their
rounds, he met Mundule, uncle to Chusero Chan, who engaged him in
conversation. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The old Casi murdered.</NOTE>In the mean time,
one Jaherba came behind him, and with one stroke of a sword, stretched
him upon the ground, having only strength to cry out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Treason! Treason! Murder and treason are on
foot!"</Q> while two servants who attended him, run off, screaming aloud,
that the Casi was assassinated. The guards started up in
confusion, but they were instantly attacked by the conspirators, and
massacred before they could prepare for their own defence.</P>
<P>The Sultan alarmed by the noise, asked Chusero Chan, who lay
in his apartment, the cause of it. The villain arose to enquire, and going
out on the terrace, stood for some time, and returning told the King, that
some of the horses belonging to the guard, had broke loose from their
picquets, and were fighting, while the peo∣ple were endeavouring to lay hold of
them. This satisfied the Sul∣tan for the present; but soon after, the
conspirators having ascended the stairs, and got upon the terraces which
led to the royal sleeping apartment, they were stopped by Ibrahim and
Ishaac, with all the porters of the private chambers, whom they immediately
put to the sword. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan assassinated.</NOTE>The Sultan
hearing the clash of arms and groans of dying men so near him, rose up in
great terror and confusion, running towards the Haram, by a private
passage. Chusero Chan fearing he might escape, rushed close after
him, and seizing him by the hair in the gallery, struggled with him for
some time. The Sultan being the stronger man, threw Chusero on the
ground; but as he had twisted his hand in his hair, he could by no means
disen∣gage himself, till some of the other conspirators came, and with
a stroke of a sabre, cut off his head and threw it down into the court,
proclaiming the deed aloud to those below.</P>
<P> <PB N="304" REF="390"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1321. Higer. 721.</NOTE>The conspirators
in the court below, began to be hard pressed by the guards and the
servants, who had crouded from all quarters, but upon hearing of the Sultan's
fate, they all hastened out of the palace. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A general massacre in the palace.</NOTE>The
conspirators then shut the gates and massacred all who had not the good
fortune to escape; particularly the younger children of Alla ul dien,
Feredoon Chan, Ali Chan and Omar Chan. Then breaking into the Haram, committed
all manner of violence upon the poor women.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections upon the Sul∣tan's death.</NOTE>Thus
the vengeance of God overtook and exterminated the race of Alla ul dien, for
his ingratitude to Firose Shaw, and the streams of innocent blood which
flowed from his hands. Heaven also punished Mubarick Shaw, whose name and
reign are too infamous to have a place in the records of literature; did not
our duty as a historian, oblige us to this disagreeable task. But
notwithstanding, we have, in some places, been obliged to throw the veil of
oblivion over circumstances too horrid to relate.</P>
<P>This massacre happened on the fifth of Ribi ul Awil, in the year
721. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chusero Chan mounts the throne.</NOTE>In the
morning Chusero Chan, surrounded by his creatures, mounted the throne, and
ridiculously assumed the title of Nasir ul dien, or the supporter of
religion. He then ordered all the slaves and servants of Mubarick Shaw, who
he thought had the least spark of honesty, to be put to death, and their
wives and children to be sold for slaves. His brother was dignified with
the title of Chan Chanan, and married to one of the daughters of Alla ul dien,
while he took Dewildè, the widow of Mubarick Shaw, to himself. He
disposed of all the other ladies of the Seraglio among his beg∣garly

Jonah had the title of Chusero Chan, and the appointment of master of the

over the allegiance of his father, Ghazi Malleck, governor of Lahore and
Debalpoor, of whom the usurper was in great fear. Notwith∣standing his
promotion, Fuchir ul dien Jonah was touched to the soul, to see the empire
ridden by a gang of villains. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ghazi Mal∣leck revolts from the

honour in those days, was discontented at the infamous proceedings at

father.</P>
<P>The usurper was in great perplexity upon the flight of Jonah, and
began already to give his hopes to the wind. Ghazi Malleck imme∣diately
prepared for hostilities, and by circular letters, invited all the Omrahs to
join his standard. A great many Subas put their troops immediately in motion;
but Mogulti the Suba of Moultan, jealous of precedence, refused to join; upon
which occasion, Byram Ibah, a chief of some note in those parts, was
prevailed upon to assassi∣nate him.</P>
<P>Malleck Ecklikki, Suba of Samana, notwithstanding the usur∣per
had been the occasion of his losing his ears, transmitted the letter of
Ghazi Malleck to court, informing him of the rebellion, and

the confederates.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ghazi Mal∣leck defeats the usurper's army, and

from Moultan, and other Subas, advanced to meet the usurper's army, which he
did upon the banks of the Sirusti. But as the troops of Ghazi Malleck were
experienced in frequent wars with the Moguls, and those of Chusero
enervated by indolence and debaucheries, and besides, lost to all sense
of military honour, they were broke at the first onset, and all the public
treasure, elephants and baggage were taken. This booty was divided in the
field among the conquerors. They then continued their march in triumph towards
Delhi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chusero marches out of the city.</NOTE>The
usurper, in great embarassment, marched out of the city, and took
possession of a strong post near the great pond of Alahi, with the
citadel in his rear, and many gardens with high walls in his front. He then
opened the treasury, and gave three years pay to his troops, leaving nothing
but the jewels, of some of which he also disposed. The confederates
advancing in sight, an action was expected next morning. But that night, Ain
ul Muluck Moultani drew off his forces from the usurper, and took the rout of
Mindu. This struck great terror into Chusero's army. They however drew up
in order of battle; and Malleck Tilbigha and Shaista Chan opposing the
confederates with great bravery, as they advanced through the lanes, were at
length overpowered and slain. But their situation gave such advantages to
the usurper's army, that they maintained their post till the evening; when
the infamous Chusero fled with a few of his friends towards Jilput. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is over∣thrown, taken and slain.</NOTE>In the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Troops stati∣oned on the frontiers.</NOTE>The
Emperor in the mean time stationed troops upon the frontiers towards Cabul,
and built forts to defend the country from the incur∣sions of the Moguls,
which he did so effectually, as not to be troubled by these invaders during
his reign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aligh Chan marches against Arin∣kil.</NOTE>In
the second year from his accession, Aligh Chan, with some of the old
Omrahs, and the troops of Chinderi, Budaoon, and Malava, was dispatched
towards Tilling, to chastise Lidderdeo, Raja of Arin∣kil, who had, during
the late disturbances, wrested his neck from the yoke, and refused to
send his tribute, while the Raja of Deogire had also swerved from his
allegiance. Aligh Chan having advanced into those countries, began a
barbarous war with fire and sword. Lidderdeo opposed him with some
vigour, but was in the end obliged to retreat into the city of Arinkil, which
Aligh Chan immediately invested.</P>

distemper, that swept hundreds to their graves every day. Many became
desirous to return home, and spread false reports through the camp, which
threw universal consternation among the army. As there had been no ad∣vices
for above a month from Delhi, Shech Zuda Dimiski, Obeid the poet, and some
others, who were companions of Aligh Chan, <PB N="310" REF="396"/>

Timur, Malleck Mul Afghan, Malleck Cafoor Mordar, and Malleck Tiggi, who were
the principal Omrahs in the camp, and told them, such and such was the
state of affairs at Delhi, and that Aligh Chan, knowing them, as old Omrahs,
to have an equal right with himself to the empire, had resolved to
dispatch them.</P>

Aligh Chan, thus deserted, was under the necessity of retreating in great
disorder, to∣wards Deogire, whither he was pursued by the besieged, with
great slaughter. In the mean time advices arrived from Delhi, that all was
well, and Aligh Chan halted at Deogire, to collect his scattered army. The
four Omrahs who fled, having disagreed among them∣selves, had each taken a
separate rout, by which means they were fallen upon by the Hindoos, plundered
of their elephants, camels, and baggage, and otherwise greatly harrassed
in their march. Mal∣leck Timur and Malleck Tiggi were both slain, while
Malleck Mul and Malleck Cafoor were seized by their own troops, and brought
prisoners to Deogire. An enquiry was made into their conduct, the authors of
the disturbance seized, and all of them sent prisoners to Delhi. The

<P>Aligh Chan was obliged to retreat from Deogire, and brought on∣ly
back three thousand horse of all his great army, to Delhi. He in two

massacred, and Lidderdeo, with his family, taken prisoners. Aligh Chan
sent the prisoners, their treasure, elephants, and effects, to Delhi,

to work with such spirit, that the forest seemed to vanish before
them, till they arrived at a fort sur∣rounded with seven ditches full of
water, and a high wall. The King immediately invested it, and began the
siege, filled up the ditches, and broke down the wall in three weeks. He took
the Raja, his family and wealth, and conferred the government of Tur∣hat upon
Ahmed Chan, and returned with his army towards Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Killed by accident.</NOTE>When the Emperor had
reached Afghanpoor, he was met by Aligh Chan, with all the Omrahs of Delhi, to
congratulate him up∣on his safe return. But his death was now approaching.
His son had in that place raised a house in three days time, for his
father's reception. The entertainment being over, the King was preparing to
mount, and every body hastened out to be ready to accompany him. The roof of
the building fell instantly in, and killed the Sul∣tan, and five of his
attendants, as he was rising to follow the Omrahs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His death ascribed to various
cau∣ses.</NOTE>Some authors attribute this accident to the newness of the
build∣ing, and the motion of the elephants that were preparing without. Others
give it to design, with which they charge Aligh Chan, as the raising this
unnecessary building seems indeed to indicate. But others ascribe it to
lightning; so that the matter still remains in doubt. The death of Tuglich
Shaw happened in the month of Ribbi ul awil, of the year 725, after a reign of
four years and some months. Amir Chusero, who lived down to the end of this
Sultan's reign, has favoured posterity with his history at large, by which
it appears, that he was a great and virtuous prince.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVII. The Reign of Sultan MAHUMMUD the son of YEAS UL
DIEN TUGHLICK SHAW.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1324. Higer. 725.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aligh Chan, by the name of Mahum∣mud Shaw, mounts the
throne.</NOTE>AFTER the King's funeral obsequies were performed, Aligh Chan
ascended the throne, by the title of Mahummud Shaw, and proceeded from
Tughlick Abad, to Delhi. The streets of that city were strowed with
flowers, the houses adorned, the drums beating, and every demonstration of
joy exhibited. The Sultan or∣dered some elephants, loaded with gold and
silver, before and behind him, which was scattered among the populace.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His genero∣sity.</NOTE>Tatar Chan, whom the
Sultan's father had adopted, and appoint∣ed to the government of Zifferabad,
was now honoured with the title of Byram Chan, and presented with a hundred
elephants, a crore of golden rupees, two thousand horse, and the government
of Bengal. To Malleck Sinjer Buduchshi, Mahummud gave seventy lacks in
silver. To Malleck ul Muluck, eighty lacks; and to Molana Azid his
pre∣ceptor, forty lacks, all in one day. Molana Nazir ul dien Cumi, had an
annual pension of one lack, and Malleck Ghizni the poet another to the same
amount.</P>
<P>His generosity, in short, was, like his wealth, without bounds,
which no man could well account for, there being no great sum in the
treasury upon his accession. It is therefore probable that he had
concealed the riches of the Raja of Arkilla, from his father, and that his
liberality was supplied from the wealth of the Decan, which circumstance
strengthens our suspicion that he was accessary to his father's
death. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His learning.</NOTE>Some writers,
notwithstanding this suspicion, make long panegyrics upon his virtues and
accomplishments. He, it must <PB N="314" REF="400"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1326. Higer. 727.</NOTE>be acknowledged,
aimed at universal knowledge, was conversant in all the literature of the
times, and a patron of learned men, giving them profusely pensions, for a
magnificent subsistance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His religion,</NOTE>The Sultan was, at the same
time, very strict with regard to public and private worship. He ordered
prayers to be read in the mosques five times every day. He discouraged all
intemperate pleasures, and set the example by his own rigid life. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and cruelty.</NOTE>But it is to be suspected,
that he acted the mean character of a hypocrite, for he was vindic∣tive and
inhuman, delighting in the blood of his subjects, and con∣demning them
without distinction of right or wrong, to cruel and ignominious deaths.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moguls invade Hin∣dostan.</NOTE>In the
beginning of the reign of Mahummud, before the empire was properly settled,
Tirim Siri Chan, chief of the tribe of Chighitta, a Mogul general of great
fame, invaded Hindostan, in the year 727, with an innumerable army, with a
view to make an entire conquest of it. Having subdued Limghan, Moultan, and
the northern pro∣vinces, he advanced towards Delhi, with incredible expedition,
and invested it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Retire with an immense treasure.</NOTE>Sultan
Mahummud, seeing he could not cope with the enemy in the field, and that the
city must soon fall, began to sue for peace, sent an immense
present in gold and jewels, to soften the Mogul chief, who at last
consented, upon receiving almost the price of the empire, to return to his
own country, taking Guzerat and Sind in his way, which he plundered of a world
of wealth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan's
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>Sultan Mahummud turned
his thoughts to war, and the regulation of his army. He subdued by different
generals, many distant coun∣tries, such as Door, Summudir, Maber, Compila,
Arinkil, Luck∣nouti, Sonnargaum, and Chittagaum, some of which provinces had
revolted, and others had never been subjected by the arms of the Islamites.
He soon after reduced the Carnatic to the extremities of 
<PB N="315" REF="401"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1326. Higer. 727.</NOTE>the Decan, and from
sea to sea, obliging all the Rajas to pay him tribute, by which means he
again filled the treasury with money.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of disturbances in the
Em∣pire.</NOTE>But during the convulsions which soon after shook the
empire, all these foreign conquests were wrested from the yoke. The
causes of the disturbances were chiefly these. The heavy imposts, which
were, in this reign, tripled in some provinces. The passing copper money
for silver, by a public decree. The raising 370,000 horse for the
conquest of Chorrassan and Maverulnere; the sending 100,000 horse
towards the mountains of Himmachil or Kirrigil; the cruel massacre of many
Mahommedans as well as Hindoos, in different parts of Hindostan; and many
other lesser reasons, which, for the sake of brevity, we shall
forbear to mention.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heavy im∣posts upon the necessa∣ries of
life.</NOTE>The imposts upon the necessaries of life, which were levied
with the utmost rigour, were too great for the power of industry, and
con∣sequently the country was involved in distraction and confusion. The
farmers were forced to fly to the woods, and to maintain themselves by
rapine. The lands being left uncultivated, famine began to desolate whole
provinces, and the sufferings of the people obliterated from their minds
every idea of government, and subjection to authority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Copper mo¦ney.</NOTE>The copper money, for want
of proper regulations, was produc∣tive of no less evils than that which we
have already specified. The King, unfortunately for his people, adopted his
ideas upon currency, from a Chinese custom of using paper upon the
Emperor's credit, with the royal seal appended, for ready money. Mahummud,
in∣stead of paper, struck a copper coin, which being issued at an
ima∣ginary value, he made current by a decree throughout Hindostan. The mint
was under very bad regulations. Bankers acquired im∣mense fortunes by
coinage, whilst the merchants made their pay∣ments <PB N="316" REF="402"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1329. Higer. 730.</NOTE>in copper, to the
poor manufacturers, at the same time that they themselves received for
their exports, silver and gold. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Villainies in the mint.</NOTE>There was much
villainy also practised in the mint; for a premium to those who had the
management of it, the merchants had their coin struck considerably below
the legal value; and these abuses were overlooked by the government.</P>
<P>But the great source of the misfortunes consequent upon this
de∣basement of the coin, was the known instability of government. Public
credit could not long subsist in a state so liable to revolutions as
Hindostan; for how could the people in the remote provinces, receive for
money the base representative of a treasury that so often changed its
master?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan obliged to call in the copper
mo∣ney.</NOTE>From these evils general murmurs and confusions arose
throughout the Empire. The Sultan, to ease the minds of the people, was
obliged to call in his copper currency. But there had been such abuses in
the mint, that after the treasury was emptied, there still remained a heavy
demand. This he was forced to strike off, and thousands were ruined. The
Emperor himself was so far from win∣ning by this indigested scheme,
that he lost all he had in his treasury; and the bankers accumulated
immense fortunes, on the ruin of their sovereign and the people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The army not being paid, commit
out∣rages.</NOTE>Mahummud, by the advice of Amir Norose, a Mogul chief, who,
with thousands of his tribe, had entered into the service, raised a great
army. The Mogul buoyed up the Emperor's mind with the fa∣cility of reducing
both Iran and Turan; but before these mighty pro∣jects could be put in
execution, he fell in arrears to his forces. They, finding they could not
subsist without pay, dispersed themselves over the empire, and
carried pillage, ruin, and death, to every quarter.</P>
<P> <PB N="317" REF="403"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1337. Higer. 738.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan forms a scheme to fill his trea∣sury.</NOTE>These
misfortunes comprehended the domestic transactions of many years. The
public treasury being squandered by impolitic schemes and follies of
various kinds, the King entered into a project to repair his finances, equally
absurd with that by which they were principally ruined.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan's scheme to conquer
China.</NOTE>Having heard of the great wealth of Chin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">China.</NOTE>, Mahummud formed a resolution to subdue that
kingdom; but to accomplish his design, it was first necessary to
conquer the country of Himmatchil, which lies between the borders of Chin and
Hindostan. He accordingly, in the year 738, ordered one hundred thousand
horse, under the command of his sister's son Chusero Malleck, to
subdue the moun∣tainous country of Himmatchil, and six garrisons as far
as the fron∣tiers of Chin. When this should be done, he proposed to advance
in person with his whole force, to invade that empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Omrahs endeavour to dissuade him from
it.</NOTE>The Omrahs and counsellors of state, went so far, as plainly to
tell him, that the troops of Hindostan never yet could, and never would
advance a step within the limits of that mighty empire, and that the whole
was a visionary project. The Sultan insisted upon making the experiment,
and accordingly this army was put in mo∣tion, and having entered the mountains,
began to build small forts on the road, to secure a communication; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan's army advance to the fron∣tiers of
China.</NOTE>proceeding in this manner to the boundaries of Chin, where a
numerous army appeared to op∣pose them. As their numbers were by this time
greatly diminished, and much inferior to that of the enemy, the troops of
Hindostan were struck with universal dismay, upon considering their
distance from home, the rugged ways they had passed, and the rainy
season which was now approaching; besides the scarcity of provisions,
which now began to be severely felt. In this consternation they bent their
march towards the foot of a mountain, where <PB N="318" REF="404"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1337. Higer. 738.</NOTE>the savage
inhabitants of the hills poured down upon them, and plundered their baggage,
while the Chinese army lay in their front.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their distress∣ful situation.</NOTE>In
this dreadful situation they remained for seven days, suffering the
extremities of famine without knowing how to proceed. At length such a heavy
rain fell, that the cavalry were up to their bel∣lies in water, which obliged
the Chinese to remove their camp to a greater distance. Chusero Malleck
then determined to endeavour to make his retreat, but the low country was quite
covered with wa∣ter, and the mountains with impervious woods. Their misfortunes
now came to a crisis. Having lost the road, they found themselves in
such an unfortunate situation, that they could find no way out but that by
which they entered, which was now possessed by the enemy. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are de∣stroyed to a man.</NOTE>This whole
army in short, in the space of fifteen days, fell a prey to famine, and a
victim to false ambition; scarce a man coming back to relate the
particulars, except those who were left behind in the garrisons. A few of
them escaped indeed the rage of the enemy, but could not escape the more
fatal tyranny of their Emperor, who or∣dered them to be put to death, upon
their return to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kirshasib re∣bels in the Decan.</NOTE>Baha ul
dien, the Sultan's nephew, an Omrah of great reputation, known more generally
by his original name Kirshasib, who possessed a government in the
Decan, called Saghir, began to turn his thoughts upon the empire, and gained
over many of the Omrahs of the Decan to his party. By their influence and the
great riches which he had accumulated, his power became very formidable. He
then attacked some Omrahs who continued firm in their allegiance, obliging
them to take refuge in the sort of Mindu.</P>
<P>The Sultan having intelligence of the revolt, commanded Chaja Jehan,
with many other Omrahs and the whole power of Guzerat, <PB N="319" REF="405"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1338. Higer. 739.</NOTE>to chastise the
rebel. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is over∣thrown.</NOTE>When the imperial army
arrived before Deo∣gire, they found Kirshasib drawn up in order of battle
to receive them: but, after a gallant contest, he was defeated. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flies to the Carnatic.</NOTE>He fled to∣wards
Sajur; but not daring to remain there, he carried off his family and wealth to
Campala in the Carnatic, and took protection in the dominions of the Raja of
that place, with whom he had maintained a friendly intercourse.</P>
<P>The Sultan, in the mean time, took the field, and arrived soon
after at Deogire. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His allies de∣feated.</NOTE>He sent from thence
Chaja Jehan with a great force against the Raja of Campala, by whom the
imperialists were twice defeated: but fresh reinforcements arriving from
Deogire, Chaja Jehan engaged the Raja a third time, and carried the victory. He
took the Raja prisoner, but Kirshasib fled to the court of Bellal∣deo,
who fearing to draw the same misfortunes upon himself, seized upon him,
and sent him bound to the general, and acknowledged his subjection to the
empire. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is taken and flead alive.</NOTE>Chaja Jehan
immediately dispatched the prisoner to court, where the Sultan ordered him
to be flead, and shewn a horrid spectacle, all around the city; while the
executioner proclaimed aloud, 
<Q REND="inline">"Thus shall all traitors to their King
perish."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan making Deo∣gire his capi∣tal, calls it
Dowlatabad.</NOTE>The Sultan was so much pleased with the situation and
strength of Deogire, that, considering it more centrical than Delhi, he
de∣termined to make it his capital. But, upon proposing this affair in his
council, the majority were of opinion, that Ugein was a more proper place for
that purpose. The King, however, had previously formed his resolution. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Destroys Delhi.</NOTE>He therefore gave orders
that the city of Delhi, which was then the envy of the world, should be
rendered desolate, and that men, women, and children, with all their effects
and cattle, should make a grand migration to Deogire. To add magnificence to
the migration, he commanded trees to be tore up by the roots, and planted in
regular rows along the road, to yield the emigrants a <PB N="320" REF="406"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1338. Higer. 739.</NOTE>shade, and that
all who had not money to defray their charges should be maintained at the
public expence. He ordered that for the future Deogire should be called
Dowlatabad; raised noble build∣ings, and dug a deep ditch round the walls,
which he repaired and beautified. Upon the top of the hill upon which the
citadel stood, he formed large reservoirs for water, and made a beautiful
garden. This change however greatly affected the empire, and distracted the
minds of the people. But the Sultan's orders were strictly complied with, and
the ancient capital left desolate.</P>
<P>The Sultan having effected this business, marched his army
against the fort of Gundana, near Jinner. Nack-naig, who was chief of the
Colies, opposed him with great bravery, but was forced to take refuge within
his walls. As the place was built upon the summit of a steep mountain,
inaccessible but by one narrow pass cut in the rock, the Sultan had no
hopes of reducing it but by famine. He accordingly ordered it to be blockaded,
and at the same time, made some ineffectual attacks, in which he was
repulsed with great loss. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gundana taken.</NOTE>The garrison becoming
straitened for provisions, and having no hopes of the Sultan's retreat,
delivered up the place at the expiration of eight months; and the Sultan
returned to Dowlatabad.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The viceroy of Moultan revolts.</NOTE>He had not
been long in his capital, when he heard that Malleck Ibah, the viceroy of
Moultan, had rebelled, and was then reducing the country of Punjaab with a
great army. The cause of the revolt was this: The Sultan having sent an
order to all his Omrahs to send their families to Dowlatabad, the
messenger who was dispatched to Moultan, presuming too much upon the
King's authority, upon ob∣serving some delay, proceeded to impertinent
threats. He one day told Byram Shaw's son in law, that he believed his father
was medi∣tating treason against the King. High words upon this arose
be∣tween them, which in the end proceeded to blows; and the 
<PB N="321" REF="407"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1340. Higer. 741.</NOTE>messenger had
his head struck off, by one of Byram Ibah's servants. Byram Ibah, knowing
the vengeful disposition of the Sultan, was sensible that this
disrespect to his authority, would never be forgiven, and resolved to
seek refuge in arms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is over∣thrown and slain.</NOTE>The Sultan
upon these advices, put his spears in motion, and has∣tened towards
Moultan; and Byram Ibah, with an army numerous as the ants or locusts,
prepared to dispute the field. Both armies at last met, and, eager for
victory, engaged with great resolution; but after the dust of the field was
laid with blood on both sides, misfor∣tune darkened the standards of Byram
Ibah, and his troops turning their backs upon glory, abandoned the field. The
Sultan immedi∣ately gave orders for a general massacre of the inhabitants
of Moul∣tan; but Shech Rukun ul dien interceded for them, and prevented the
effects of this horrible mandate. Byram Ibah was taken in the pursuit, and
his head brought to the King, who returned towards Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan resides at Delhi two years.</NOTE>At
sight of their native country and city, all those who had been forced to
Dowlatabad, began to desert the Sultan's army, and to dis∣perse
themselves in the woods. The Emperor, to prevent the con∣sequences of this
desertion, took up his residence in the city; whi∣ther he invited them, and
remained there for the space of two years. But then he again revolved in his
mind, the scheme of making Dow∣latabad his capital. He removed his family,
obliging the Omrahs to do the same, and carried off the whole city a second
time, to the Decan; leaving that noble metropolis a habitation for owls, and
the wild beasts of the desart.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppressions, and unheard-of cruelty of the
Sultan.</NOTE>About this time, the taxes were so heavily imposed, and
exacted with such rigour and cruelty, by the officers of the revenue, that
the whole extent of that fertile country, between the two rivers, 
<PB N="322" REF="408"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1341. Higer. 742.</NOTE>Ganges and Jumna,
were particularly oppressed. The farmers, weary of their lives, in one day,
set fire to their own houses, and retired to the woods, with their families
and cattle. The tyrant having received intelligence of this circumstance,
ordered a body of troops to massacre these unhappy people if they
resisted, and if they should be taken, to put out their eyes. Many
populous provinces were, by this inhuman decree, laid waste, and remained
so for several years. The colony of Dowlatabad was also in great
distraction; the people, without houses, without employment, were reduced
to the utmost distress.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Instances of it.</NOTE>The tyrannies of the
execrable Mahummud exceeded, in short, any thing we have met with in
history, of which the following is a horrid instance. When he remained at
Delhi, he led his army out to hunt, as is customary with princes. When they
arrived in the territory of Birren, he plainly told them, that he came not to
hunt beasts but men; and without any obvious reason, began a general
massacre of the wretched inhabitants. He had even the barbarity to bring
home some thousands of their heads, and to hang them over the city walls.
He, upon another occasion, made an excursion of the same nature towards
Kinnoge, and massacred all the inhabitants of that city, and the adjacent
country for many miles, spreading terror and desolation wherever he turned
his face.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A rebellion in Bengal.</NOTE>But to return to the
chain of history: During this time, Malleck Fuchir ul dien, after the death
of Byram Chan, rebelled in Luck∣nouti, having slain Kudder Chan, and
possessed himself of the three provinces of Bengal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bengal, at this time, was divided into three governments.</NOTE>.
The Sultan, at the same time, received advices, that Seid Hassen had
rebelled in Maber. He ordered Ibra∣him the son of Seid Hassen, and all
his family, to prison; then marched in the year 742, from the sacking of
Kinnoge, towards <PB N="323" REF="409"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1342. Higer. 743.</NOTE>Maber. When he had
reached Dowlatabad, he laid a heavy tax upon that city and the neighbouring
provinces, which awakened the people into rebellion; but his numerous army
soon reduced all the unhappy insurgents to their former slavery. From
that place the Sultan sent back a part of his army and Chaja Jehan to Delhi,
while he himself marched with another force towards Maber, by the way of
Tilling.</P>
<P>When Mahummud arrived before Arinkil, there happened to be a plague
in that city, by which he lost a great part of his army. He himself had a
violent struggle for his own life, and was obliged to leave Amad ul Malleck
to command the army, and return towards Dowlatabad. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan buries, with great solem∣nity, one of
his teeth.</NOTE>On the way he was seized with a violent tooth-ach, and
lost one of his teeth, which he ordered to be buried with much ceremony at
Beir, and a magnificent tomb to be reared over it, which still remains a
monument of human vanity and folly. Hav∣ing arrived at Patan he found himself
better, and halted to take medicines for some days. In this place he gave to
Shahab Sultani, the title of Naserit Chan, and the government of Bidder, with
its dependencies, which yielded annually, a revenue of one crore of rupees. He,
at the same time, conferred the government of Dow∣latabad and Marhat upon
Cuttilich Chan his preceptor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He returns to Delhi.</NOTE>He proceeded from
Patan in his palankie to Delhi, having heard of some disturbance among the
Patans. He, at this period, gave leave to such of the inhabitants of
Dowlatabad as were willing to return to Delhi, to follow him. Many thousands
returned, but they had almost perished on the way by a famine, which then
desolated the countries of Malava and Chinderi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The misery of the inhabi∣tants.</NOTE>When they
came to Delhi, they found that the famine raged with redoubled violence in that
city, in so much that very few could procure the necessaries of life.
Mahummud, for once, seemed affected with human miseries. 
<PB N="324" REF="410"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1342. Higer. 743.</NOTE>He even for some
time entirely changed his disposition, and took great pains to encourage
husbandry, commerce, and all kinds of industry. He opened the treasury,
and divided large sums to the inhabitants for these purposes. But as the
people were really in great distress, they expended the money in the
necessaries of life, and many of them were severely punished upon that
account.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion of the Afgans,</NOTE>Shahoo, a chief of
the Afgans, about this time, commenced hos∣tilities to the northward, pouring
down like a torrent upon Moultan which he laid waste, and killed Begad the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">quelled.</NOTE>The Sultan having prepared an army
at Delhi, moved towards Moultan, but Shahoo, upon the king's ap∣proach, wrote
him a submissive letter, and fled to the mountains of Afganistan. The
Sultan perceiving that it was idle to pursue him, returned to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dreadful fa∣mine at Delhi.</NOTE>The famine
continued still to rage in the city so dreadfully, that men eat one
another. He ordered, in this distress, another distri∣bution of money
towards the sinking of wells, and the cultivation of lands, but the people
weakened by hunger, and distracted by private distresses in their
families, made very little progress, while the drought continued, and
rendered their labour vain. At the same time, the tribes of Mindahir, Chohan,
Miana, Batti, and others who inhabited the country about Samana, unable to
discharge their rents, fled into the woods. The Sultan marched forthwith
against them with his army, and massacred some thousands of these
poor slaves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gickers invade Pun∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ab.</NOTE>In the year 743, Malleck Chunder, chief of the
Gickers, invaded Punjâb, and killed Malleck Tatar the viceroy of Lahore
in action. Chaja Jehan, upon this, was sent against him. The Sultan, in the
mean time, began to entertain a ridiculous notion, that all the misfortunes 
<PB N="325" REF="411"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1343. Higer. 744.</NOTE>of his reign,
proceeded from his not having been confirmed in the empire, by the Caliph of
Mecca. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An embassy sent to Mecca.</NOTE>He therefore
dispatched presents and ambassadors to Arabia, and struck the
Caliph's name in the place of his own, on all the current coin, and prohibited
all public wor∣ship in the mosques, till the Caliph's confirmation should
arrive. In the year 744, Hadgee Seid Sirsirri returned with the
ambassador, and brought the Caliph's confirmation, and a royal dress. He
was met without the city by the King in person, who advanced to receive him
on foot, putting the Caliph's phirman upon his head, and opening it with great
solemnity. Returning into the city, he ordered a grand festival to be
celebrated, and public service to be read in all the mosques, striking
out every King's name from the Chutba, who had not been confirmed from Mecca.
Among the number of those degraded monarchs, was the Sultan's own father. He
even carried this whim so far as to write the Caliph's name upon his
houses, robes, and furniture. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ridiculous behaviour of the Sultan.</NOTE>These,
and some other ridiculous actions of the life of Mahummud, may reasonably
make us suspect the sound∣ness of his head. The Arabian ambassador,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1344. Higer. 745.</NOTE>all those
kingdoms. Kisnanaig in the mean time promised, when matters should be
ripe, to raise all the Hindoos of Arinkil and Til∣ling to his
assistance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Decan lost to the empire.</NOTE>The Raja
accordingly built a strong city upon the frontiers of his dominions, and
called it Bigen, from the name of his son, to which the word Nagur or city is
now added. He then began to raise an army, and sent part of it under the
command of Kisnanaig, who reduced Arinkil, and drove Malleck Amad ul Muluck,
the Sultan's viceroy, to Dowlatabad. Bellaldeo, and Kisnanaig, having joined
their forces with the Raja of Maber and Doorsummund, who were formerly
tributaries to the government of the Carnatic, they seized upon those
countries, and drove the Mahommedans before them on all sides. In short,
within a few months, the Sultan had no pos∣sessions in the Decan,
except Dowlatabad.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan's tyranny, and distractions in the
empire.</NOTE>The tyrannical Mahummud, upon receiving intelligence of those
misfortunes, grew vengeful, splenitic, and cruel, wreaking his rage upon his
unhappy subjects, without crime, provocation, or distinction. This conduct
occasioned rebellion, robbery, and confusion, in all parts of the empire.
The famine became daily more and more dreadful, insomuch that the Sultan, not
able to procure provisions, even for his household, was obliged to abandon
the city, and to open the gates, and permit the starved inhabitants, whom he
had before confined, to provide for themselves. Thousands crowded towards
Bengal, which, as we have before observed, had revolted from the Empire. The
Sultan encamped his army near Cumpula, on the banks of the Ganges, and drew
supplies from the countries of Oud and Kurrah. He ordered his people to build
houses, which at length became a city under the name of Surgdewarie.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrections quashed.</NOTE>In the year 745,
Nizam Bain, a Zemindar, possessed of some lands in the province of
Oud, and a fellow of an infamous character, <PB N="327" REF="413"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1345. Higer. 746.</NOTE>collected a mob of
the discontented farmers, and assumed the royal umbrella, with the title
of Alla ul dien. But before the Sultan marched against him, Ain ul Muluck,
Suba of Oud, raised his for∣ces, and defeating him, sent his head to the
King. Nuzerit Chan in the same year, who had taken the whole province of
Bidder, at one crore of rupees, finding himself unable to make good that
con∣tract, rebelled; but Cuttulich Chan being ordered against him from
Dowlatabad, expelled him from that government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion at Kilbirgah quashed.</NOTE>During
this period, Ali Shaw, who was sent from Dowlatabad to collect the rents of
Kilbirgah, finding that country destitute of troops, assembled his
friends, raised an army with the collections, and in the year 746, erected
his rebellious standards, and took possession of Kilbirgah and
Bidder. The Sultan, on this occasion, sent a rein∣forcement to Cuttulich
Chan to suppress him. Cuttulich Chan ar∣riving on the confines of Bidder,
Ali Shaw came out and gave him battle; but being defeated, he shut himself
up in the city. He was however soon obliged to capitulate, and was sent
prisoner to the King, who banished him and his brother to Ghizni.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ain ul Mu∣luck medi∣tates a rebel∣lion.</NOTE>Ain
ul Muluck having paid great attention to the King, and en∣tirely gained his
favour, was appointed to the viceroyship of Dow∣latabad and Arinkil, in the
room of Cuttulich Chan. But Ain ul Muluck himself looked upon this
appointment as an impolitic step in the King, considering the services
Cuttulich Chan had done to his affairs in the Decan, and the power he then
enjoyed. And therefore thought it a snare laid to draw him quietly from his
own Subaship, and then to deprive him of both. In the mean time a number of
the clerks of the revenues being convicted of abuses in their office, were
ordered to be put to death. Some of those who survived found means to
escape to Ain ul Muluck, and endeavoured to confirm him in his former opinion
of the King's intentions.</P>
<P> <PB N="328" REF="414"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1345. Higer. 746.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes arms.</NOTE>He accordingly disobeyed the King's order, and
erected the stan∣dard of rebellion, sending a detachment of horse under
the command of his brother, who, before the Sultan received any intelligence of
his designs, carried off all the elephants, camels, and horses, that were
grazing or foraging near the royal camp. The Sultan, in great perplexity,
called the troops of Kole, Birren, Amrohe, Saman, and other districts
adjacent, to his assistance; while Chaja Jehan joined him, with an army
from Delhi. The Sultan moved his standards, for Ain ul Muluck and his
brothers had now crossed the Ganges, and were advancing towards him, in
great hopes that the Sultan's army, tired and disgusted with his tyrannical
behaviour, would join them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan engages and overthrows him.</NOTE>The
Sultan, enraged at their presumption, mounted his horse, and, engaging
them, after a short conflict, put them to flight. Ain ul Muluck was taken
prisoner, and his brother Shoralla drown∣ed in the Ganges, as he was
swimming across, having been wounded in the action, while another brother
was slain in the field. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pardons him.</NOTE>The Sultan was so prejudiced
in favour of Ain ul Muluck, that he pardon∣ed him, and restored him to his
former dignities, saying, that he was certain that Muluck was a loyal
subject, though he had been instiga∣ted to this rebellion by the malice and
falsehood of others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan returns to Delhi.</NOTE>The Sultan
marched from thence to Barage, to pay his devotions at the tomb of Sallar
Musaood, one of the family of Sultan Mamood Ghiznavi, who had been killed
there by the Hindoos in the year 557. He distributed great sums among the
Fakiers, who resided at Barage, and then returned to Delhi. Another
ambassador arrived at that time from the Caliph, and was received with the
same distinguishing marks of respect as the former, and dismissed
with rich presents. Not long after, a prince of the house of Abassi,
arrived at Delhi, and was met by the Sultan, at the village of Palum, and he
pre∣sented him with two lacks of rupees, a large tract of territory, a 
<PB N="329" REF="415"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1346. Higer. 747.</NOTE>palace and fine
gardens. By way of respect to the Caliphat, he placed him upon his right
hand, and even sometimes ridiculously condescended to sit down upon the
carpet before him, and pay him obeisance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuttulich Chan recalled from the
Decan.</NOTE>Some of the courtiers calumniated Cuttulich Chan, governor of the
Decan, accusing him of oppressions and other abuses in his government,
though a man of justice and integrity. The King re∣called Cuttulich Chan to
Delhi, ordering his brother Molana Nizam ul dien, to whom he gave the title of
Alim ul Malleck, and placed at Burudge, to take charge of what remained to the
empire of the Decan, till he should send some person from court. When
the King's or∣der arrived, Cuttulich Chan was digging a great pond or
reservoir, which he begged his brother to compleat, and prepared to return to
Delhi, with all the revenues of the Decan, which he had previously secured
in a fort called Daragire, upon a mountain close to the city.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan determines to reconquer the
Decan.</NOTE>The Sultan, after the arrival of Cuttulich Chan, appointed four
governors for the Decan, having divided it into four provinces, and determined
to reduce it as before, to his obedience. To accomplish his purpose, he
ordered a numerous army, under the command of Amad ul Malleck, an Omrah of
great reputation, to march to Dow∣latabad, and entered into articles with him,
that he and the other chiefs should pay into the treasury seven crores of
rupees annually for their governments. To make up this sum, and to gratify
their own avarice, they plundered and oppressed that unfortunate country.
At the same time the Sultan conferred the government of Malava up∣on Aziz, a
mean fellow formerly a vintner, and told him, that the Amirs of Sidda<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mogul captains, who entered into his service with Amir
Norose.</NOTE> were dangerous persons in that country, therefore to
endeavour to extirpate them.</P>
<P> <PB N="330" REF="416"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1346. Higer. 747.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Encourages husbandry.</NOTE>The Sultan then marched back to his
old cantonments at Surgde∣warie, and began to encourage cultivation, upon a new
plan which he himself had invented. He appointed an inspector, for the
regu∣lation of all that related to husbandry, by the name of Amir Kohi, who
divided the country into districts of 60 miles square, under a Shickdar,
who was to be answerable for its cultivation and improve∣ment. Above one
hundred Shickdars received their appointments at once, and seventy lacks of
rupees were issued out of the treasury, to enable them to carry on this
work.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A cruel mas∣sacre at Be∣dar.</NOTE>Aziz
Chumar, when he arrived at Bedar, invited the Amirs of Sidda, to an
entertainment, and assassinated eighty of them, with their attendants.
He wrote to the Sultan an account of this horrible mas∣sacre, who sent
him back a present of a dress and a fine horse, for his loyal services.
Such were the morals of those wretched days! 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan promotes men of low birth.</NOTE>The
tyrannical Mahummud had now taken it into his head, that he would be better
served by people of low birth, than by the nobility. He accordingly promoted
Litchena a singer, Pira a gardener, Mun∣ga his son, Shech Baboo a weaver,
Muckbil a slave, and other low fellows, to the degree of Omrahs, and gave
them the command of provinces and high offices at court. He in this, forgot the
advice of the poet, who writes, that 
<Q REND="inline">"He who exalts the head of a beggar, and hopes great
things from his gratitude, inverts the nature of things, and nourishes a
serpent in his bosom."</Q> This resolution of the tyrant, was
occasioned by a noble refusal of the Omrahs, to put his cruel orders in
execution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disturbances in Guzerat.</NOTE>In the mean
time, Malleck Muckbil, entitled Chan Jehani, vizier of Guzerat, with the
treasure, and the Sultan's horses, set out for Delhi. The Siddas of
those parts, hearing of his intentions, way∣laid him with a body of horse,
and, having robbed him, retired to Narwalla. The Sultan hearing of this
robbery, in a great rage pre∣pared <PB N="331" REF="417"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1347. Higer. 748.</NOTE>for Guzerat, leaving
Malleck Firose his nephew, governor at Delhi, and, in the year 748, marched
to Sultanpoor, about 30 miles without the city, where he waited for some
reinforcements. An address came from Aziz Chumar, begging leave to go
against the Siddas, being nearer, and having a sufficient force, as he
imagined, for that purpose. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cowardice, defeat, and death of Aziz
Chumar.</NOTE>The Sultan consented to his request, at the same time
expressing much doubt of his success, knowing him to be a dastardly
and unexperienced officer. Aziz Chumar advanced towards the rebels; but in the
beginning of the action, he was struck power∣less with terror, and fell
headlong from his horse. He was taken, and suffered a cruel death; his army
being defeated with some loss.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeai Birni's reply to the Sultan.</NOTE>The
Sultan being informed of this disaster, marched from Sultan-poor. It was on
this march that Mahummud is said to have asked Zeai Birni the poet, what
crimes a King ought to punish with severity? The poet replied, that seven
sorts of criminals deserved severe punish∣ments; these were,
apostates from their religion, shedders of inno∣cent blood, double
adulterers, rebellious persons, officers disobeying lawful orders, thieves
and perverters of the laws. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rebels totally de∣feated.</NOTE>When he had
reached the hills of Abu, upon the confines of Guzerat, he sent one of his
principal Omrahs, Chan Jehan, against the rebels, who met them in the
districts of Bai, and gave them a total defeat. The Sul∣tan having halted at
Baruge, sent Malleck Muckbil after them, who coming up with them as they were
crossing the Nirbuda, put the greatest part to the sword. The few who
escaped, taking protection with Madeo, Raja of Buckelana, were all plundered
of their wealth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan's cruelty in Cambait and
Guzerat.</NOTE>The Sultan, upon this occasion, massacred many of the
Siddas of Baruge, and plundered Cambait and Guzerat of every thing valu∣able,
putting all who opposed him to the sword. He then sent Zein Dund Mugid ul

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1347. Higer. 748.</NOTE>upon all the Siddas
of those parts, to bring them to punishment. Alim ul Malleck, according to
orders, summoned the Siddas from Raijor, Mudkil, Kilbirgah, Bidder, Bijapoor,
Genjouti, Ruibaug, Kollchir, Hukeri, Berar, Ramgire, and other places. The
Siddas, conformable to those orders, prepared for Dowlatabad, and when they
were all collected, Alim ul Muluck dispatched them under a guard of fifteen
hundred horse, to the royal presence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The impri∣soned Siddas forming a

fear∣ing that the Sultan had a design upon their lives, they entered into a
conspiracy for their own security. They, with one accord, fell up∣on their
guard, slew Ahmed Latchin their chief, with many of his people, while the
rest, under the command of Malleck Ali, fled to Dowlatabad. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">surprize and take Dowla∣tabad.</NOTE>The Siddas
pursued them, and, before any advices could arrive to put the place in a
posture of defence, they took it by assault, being favoured by the troops
within, who became seditious. Alim ul Muluck, with whose behaviour they
were satisfied, was spared, but all the rest of the Emperor's officers
were put to death, and the treasure divided among the conspirators.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proclaim Ismaiel Mu∣che King.</NOTE>The Siddas
of Guzerat, and other parts, who were skulking about in the woods and
mountains, hearing of the success of their brethren, joined them. Ismaiel
Muche, one of the Amirs of their faction, was proclaimed King, by the name of
Nasir ul dien. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Ma∣hummud marches against

army, waited to give battle to the King.

met, and the Siddas, though greatly inferior in number, roused by their
dan∣ger and wrongs, assaulted the imperial troops with such violence,
that the right and left wings were beat back, and the whole army upon the point
of flight. But many of the chieftains who fought in the van being killed, four
thousand of the Siddas fled; and night <PB N="333" REF="419"/>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The impolitic conduct of the Siddas.</NOTE>A
council of war being in the mean time called by the Siddas, who had suffered
greatly in the engagement, it was determined that Ismaeil Muche should
retire into Dowlatabad, with a good garrison, and that the remainder should
shift for themselves, till the Sultan should leave the Decan; when they
resolved to assemble again at Dowlatabad. This wretched conduct was
accordingly pursued. The Sultan ordered Amad ul Muluck, who was then at
Elichpoor, to pursue the fugitives, while he himself laid siege to the
city.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An insurrec∣tion in Guze∣rat.</NOTE>In the mean
time advices arrived, that Malleck Tiggi, the slave of Suffder ul Muluck,
heading the Siddas of Guzerat, was joined by many of the Zemindars, by which
means he had taken Narwalla, and put Malleck Muziffer, the Naib of Guzerat, to
death; imprisoned Shech Moaz ul dien the viceroy, and was now marching to lay
waste Cambait, having in his rout blockaded Baruge.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan marches a∣gainst the

siege of Dowlatabad, and with the greater part of his army, marched with
great expedition to Guzerat. He was plundered in his way of many elephants, and
a great part of his baggage, by the Hindoos: he lost also a great many men
in defending himself. The Sultan having arrived at Baruge, Tiggi retreated to
Cambait, and was pursued by Malleck Eusiph Buckera, whom the Sultan had
detached after him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of his army de∣feated.</NOTE>Tiggi having
engaged the pur∣suers at Cambait, turned the chace upon them, killed Eusiph
Buckera and many other Omrahs, while the rest retreated to the Sultan. The

he had formerly in confinement, to be put to death; among the latter was Moaz

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1347. Higer. 748.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan pursues.</NOTE>Mahummud, hearing of this cruelty,
breathed revenge. He hastened to Cambait, and Tiggi, unable to oppose him,
retreated to Assawil, but was closely pursued thither by the Sultan.
The rebel continued his flight to Narwalla, and in the mean time, the Sultan,
on account of a prodigious rain, was obliged to halt at Assawil a whole
month. Advices were brought him at Assawil, that Tiggi, having recruited
his army at Narwalla, was returning to give him battle. The Sultan immediately
struck his tents and met the rebel at Kurri. Tiggi, having injudiciously
ordered his men to intoxicate themselves with strong liquors, they attacked
the Sultan with the fury of madmen; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and over∣throws the rebels.</NOTE>but the
elephants in front, soon repressed this bor∣rowed valour, and repulsed
and threw into confusion the rebels. An easy conquest was obtained: five
hundred prisoners were taken and put to death; and an equal number fell in
the field. The Sultan immediately detached the Son of Eusiph Buckera in
pursuit of the runaways, by the way of Tatta, whither Tiggi had fled; while
the King went in person to Narwalla, and employed himself in settling
Guzerat.</P>

Muche had resigned his regal dignity, which Hassen Cacu had assumed,
under the title of Sultan Alla ul dien. Mahummud was excessively chagrined,
upon receiving this intelligence, and began to consider his own tyranny as
the cause of all those disorders. He therefore resolved to govern with
more mild∣ness and humanity for the future. He called Malleck Firose, Chaja
Jehan, Amir Kiah, Malleck Ghizni, and Sidder Jehan from Delhi with their

business was not so soon accomplished, as he at first imagined; for
he spent a whole year in regulating Guzerat, and in recruiting his army. The
next year was also spent in be∣sieging the fort of Carnal, reducing
Cutch, and the adjacent terri∣tories. Some authors affirm, that Mahummud took
the fort of Car∣nal; but others, of better authority, say, that he
desisted from that attempt, upon receiving some presents from the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Asks advice of Zeai Birni, the poet,</NOTE>Zeai

Firose Shaw having gained over the majority of the Omrahs to his party,

prevailed upon to adopt this lucrative scheme. They therefore returned next
morning to the camp, which was still in very great confu∣sion, and after a

The Emperor himself in the mean time re∣mained with the army, to regulate the

before the ambassa∣dor, and asked them whether they knew any of the male
issue of Mahummud. They all declared, that unless Malana Cumal ul dien,

perceiving that he could not support the young King, made overtures towards
an accommodation, to Firose Shaw. He sent some respectable Omrahs to
intercede with the Sultan for his pardon, and to solicit leave to pay his
respects in person. The Sultan con∣sented, and accordingly the old man,
with his head bare, and his turban hung round his neck, came, accompanied by
some of the principal men of his party, to make his submission. The
King, according to his promise, gave him his life, but ordered the Cutwal of
Hassen to take him under his care, which was a kind of impri∣sonment.
Malleck Chattab, one of Chaja Jehan's associates, was banished to
Karkinda, and Sheck Zadda Gustami expelled the court.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunts at Sirmore.</NOTE>Upon the fifth of Siffer,
in the following year, he, in order to hunt, removed his court towards the
hills of Sirmore, and reduced several Zemindars to obedience. He, in the mean

or∣dered great rejoicings to be made upon the occasion; distributing his
favours with a liberal hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Builds a palace.</NOTE>In the year 754, the
Sultan hunted at Callanore. He ordered, upon his return, a palace to be built
upon the banks of the Sursuti; and towards the end of the year, appointed
Chan Jehan to the vice∣royship of Delhi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion in Bengal.</NOTE>He himself, in the
mean time, marched towards Lucknouti, to subdue Elias Hadgee, who had
assumed the title of Sultan Shumse ul dien, and possessed
himself of all Bengal and Behar, even to Benaris. When he had arrived in the
neighbourhood of Gorukpoor, the Zemindars of that place, Odeysing and Rai
Capoor, having brought proper presents, were admitted to his presence.</P>
<P>The Sultan having penetrated as far as Punduah, one of the
resi∣dences of the princes of Bengal, Elias Hadgee retreated to a strong
post at Ackdalla, whither the Sultan pursued him. An action en∣sued, but
Elias Hadgee secured himself in his post, which obliged the Sultan to
surround him, the place being almost inaccessible. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan having in vain tried to force the
re∣bels to battle,</NOTE>Things having continued in this situation for twenty
days, Firose Shaw, intending to change his ground, and to encamp on the banks
of the Ganges, went out to reconnoitre. The enemy imagining that he meditated a
retreat, advanced out of their post, and drew up in order of battle. But when
they saw that the Sultan was preparing to attack them, they again retreated
within their works, but with <PB N="341" REF="427"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1353. Higer. 754.</NOTE>such precipitation
and confusion, that 44 elephants, and many stan∣dards, fell into the
Sultan's hands. The rainy season coming on with great violence, a kind of
peace was patched up between them, and the Sultan returned disappointed to
Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Firose Shaw employs him∣self in public
works.</NOTE>In the year 755, the Sultan built the city of Firoseabad,
adjoining to that of Delhi; and in the following year marched to Debalpoor,
where he made a canal 100 miles in length, from the Suttuluz to the Jidger. The
King, in the year 757, between the hills of Mendouli and Sirmore, cut a channel
from the Gion or Jumna, which he divi∣ded into seven streams; one of which
he brought to Hassi, and from thence to Beraisen, where he built a
strong castle, calling it by his own name. He drew soon after, a canal
from the Cagar, passing by the walls of Sirsutti, and joined it to the
rivulet of Kerah, upon which he built a city, named after him, Firoseabad.
This city he watered with another canal from the Gion or Jumna. These public
works were of prodigious advantage to the adjacent countries, by supplying
them with water for their lands, and with a commodious water-carriage, from
place to place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bengal and the Decan become
inde∣pendant.</NOTE>An embassy about this time arrived, with presents and
new con∣ditions of peace from Bengal, which the Sultan accepted, and soon
after ratified the treaty. Bengal became in a great measure indepen∣dent of
the empire, paying only a small acknowledgment annually, by way of present.
He exacted no other terms of the Decan; so that these two great members
were now lopt off from the government of Delhi.</P>
<P>In the year 759, the Sultan of Bengal sent a number of elephants
and other rich presents, to Delhi, which was amply repaid in Ara∣bian and
Persian horses, jewels, and other rich curiosities. But when 
<PB N="342" REF="428"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1357. Higer. 759.</NOTE>the imperial
embassy arrived at Behar, they received news of Shumse ul dien's death,
and that his son Ascunder Chan had acceded to the throne. They thought
proper not to proceed further, and returned to Delhi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasions of the Moguls.</NOTE>The Sultan, being
in the same year encamped at Semana, received advices that the Moguls had
made an incursion as far as Debalpoor. He forthwith ordered Malleck Kabool,
with a great army, against them; but the Moguls, before his arrival, had
laden themselves with spoil, and had retreated towards their own
country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan invades
Ben∣gal.</NOTE>Notwithstanding of the treaty of 757, the Sultan, in the year
760, resolved upon another expedition into Bengal. Having arrived at
Zifferabad, he cantoned there his army, during the rains. When he lay at this
place, Shech Zadda Bustami, who had been banished, returned embassador
from the Caliph of Misser, with a chelat; for which he was graciously
received, and dignified with the title of Azim ul Muluck. An embassy having
been, in the mean time, dis∣patched to Ascunder Chan, Sultan of Bengal,
returned with another on his part, and with rich presents. The King not being
satisfied with these concessions, marched, after the rains were over,
towards Lucknouti, and on his way conferred the ensigns of royalty upon the
Prince Fatte Chan his son. He gave him masters for his instruction, to
whom the royal youth gave great attention.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A peace with Aescunder, Sultan of
Bengal.</NOTE>The Sultan having arrived at Pundwah, Aescunder, after the
ex∣ample of his father, retreated to Ackdalla, and shut himself up in that
place. Being however closely invested, and reduced to great straits, he
sent 48 elephants, and other presents, to the Sultan, with overtures of
peace. In a few days the terms were agreed upon, and the Sultan marched to
Jionpoor, where he cantoned his army for another season, and then moved
down behind the mountains, towards Jagenagur.</P>
<P> <PB N="343" REF="429"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1358, Higer. 760.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Firose Shaw ravages Jage∣nagur.</NOTE>Firose Shaw having
crossed the river Mendri, arrived at the capital of the Raja of Jagenagur,
which was also called Benaris. The Raja, upon the Emperor's approach, fled
towards Tilling. Having plun∣dered the country, Firose Shaw returned, and,
upon his way, was met by the Raja of Beerbhan, who presented him with 37
elephants, and other valuable presents, upon consideration of not ravaging
the country. The Sultan having received the presents, changed his rout, and,
as he passed through the woods of Puddmawitti, which abounded with
elephants, he caught 33 of them, and killed a few in the chace. He then
continued his march, and arrived at Delhi, in the year 762.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheme for improving the lands of
Sirhind.</NOTE>Firose Shaw, who had much at heart the improvement of his
country, was informed, that near Hirdar there was a mountain from which there
issued a great stream of water, which fell into the Suttu∣luz; and that
beyond that place there was a small rivulet called Seli∣ma, divided only by a
rising ground, from the large stream which we have just mentioned. The
Sultan considered, that by making a cut through this eminence, the great
stream might be carried into the rivulet, and so form a river to water the
countries of Sirhind and Munsurpoor, from whence it might be carried to
Sunnam, and so render great tracts of land fertile. He therefore marched
immediately that way, and ordered fifty thousand labourers to be collected
together to cut the passage. When the workmen were in this place employed
in digging to great depth, they found some immense skeletons of
ele∣phants in one place, and in another, those of a gigantic human form, the
arm bones of which measured guzes. Some of the bones were in their natural
state, and others petrified.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Firose Shaw reduces Na∣gracut.</NOTE>The Sultan
having finished this great work, built a fort at Sirhind, which he called
Firosepoor. He from that place marched towards the mountains of Nagracut,
where he was overtaken by a storm of <PB N="344" REF="430"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1360. Higer. 762.</NOTE>hail and snow. He
however reduced the Raja of those parts, after sustaining some loss
on his side, and confirmed him again in his domi∣nions; changing the name of
Nagracut, to that of Mahummud abad, in honour of the former Sultan. Firose
Shaw was told here, that the Goddess, whom the Hindoos worshipped in the
temple of Nagracut, was the image of Noshaba, the wife of the great Secunder,
which that conqueror had left with them. The name of the idol is now changed to
that of Jewallamuckie. In the temple there was also at that time, a fine
library of the books of the Brahmins, con∣sisting of one thousand and
three hundred volumes.</P>
<P>The Sultan ordered one of those books, which treated of
philoso∣phy, astrology, and divination, to be translated into the
Persian lan∣guage, and called it Dellael Firose Shawi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dellael Firose Shawi signifies the arguments of Firose Shaw.
Some authors relate, that the image now worshipped at Nagracut, is not that
of Noshaba, which, say they, Firose Shaw sent to Mecca, where it was
buried before the door of the great mosque. It is not improbable, but
Alexander, who penetrated to the Indies, might have left an image of one of the
Grecian Goddesses, upon the frontiers of his conquests. The Brahmins
might have, with less absurdity, converted this foreign Goddess into one
of their own growth, than those holy persons at Rome, who have changed the
statue of Jupiter Tonans into one of St. Peter; disgracing with a parcel of
keys, that hand which formerly held the thunder.</NOTE>. The Sultan, after the
conquest of Nagracut, moved down by Sind towards Tatta, where Jambani, who
had been always a subject of Delhi, had rebelled and fortified himself. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invests Tatta,</NOTE>The Sultan invested the
city; but as provisions and forage became excessively scarce, and the
rains had set in with great violence, he was obliged to raise the siege,
and march to Guze∣rat. He there spent the season in hunting, and after
the rains, he conferred the government of Guzerat upon Ziffer Chan, and
return∣ed again to Tatta. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">which he re∣duces.</NOTE>Jambani capitulated, and
delivered himself up to the Sultan, who carried him, and the principals of
his faction, to Delhi; but after some time, he took him again into favour,

years after, when the Sultan was plunged into the gulf of affliction, by the
death of his favourite son Fatte Chan, a prince of great expectations.</P>
<P>Ferose Shaw, in the year 778, was informed that the revenues of
Guzerat were greatly deficient of the collections. This induced him to listen
to the proposals of Chaja Shumse ul dien Wamaghani, who offered to give one
hundred elephants, forty lacks of rupees, four hundred Abassinian slaves,
and forty Arabian horses, every year, over and above the present payment,
should he be appointed to that government. The Sultan replied, that if the
present viceroy, whose name was also Shumse ul dien, the
successor of Ziffer Chan, who was dead, would consent to give as much,
he should be continued. But to this the viceroy would not agree, and
therefore the Sun∣nuds were granted to Wamaghani, and he forthwith set out
for Guzerat. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion in Guzerat quashed.</NOTE>Not being

province, a conspiracy was formed against him, and, by the assistance
of the Siddas, they seized him, and sent his head to Delhi. This was the
only rebellion which happened during this Sultan's reign. The government of
Guzerat was conferred upon Malleck Musirrah, with the title of Firhit ul

that the Zemindar of Kitter, whose name was Kirgu, had invited Seid Mahummud,
Suba of Budaoon, and a number of his family, to his house, where he basely
assassinated them. The Sultan enraged at this villainy, marched
immediately that way, and took severe vengeance upon the associates and
kindred of the assassin, putting them without distinction to the
sword, and levelling their houses with the ground. The murderer himself
made his escape to the mountains of Cumaoon, and was protected by the Rajas
of those parts. The Sultan ordered a detach∣ment of his army against them.
They brought back near thirty thousand of those unhappy mountaineers, who
were all condemned to slavery. The Sultan's justice in this case,
degenerated into extream severity. Neither did the misfortunes brought upon
those miserable captives, satisfy his thirst for revenge. He returned,
every year, under pretence of hunting, to that unhappy country; but the people,
and not the beasts of the forest, were his prey. He by degrees cut off all
the inhabitants, and converted whole provinces into a wilder∣ness.</P>

shut up for some days; and at last, having obtained leave for his wife to

sensible of his son's sincerity, clasped him in his arms, and
weeping, told him he had been deceived; and therefore desired him to proceed

went out from the presence, and ordered twelve thousand horse to be in

who upon hearing of the Prince's approach, put Ziffer Chan to death, and
collecting his friends, came out to engage him in the street. Upon the

twenty thousand horse, with which he advanced towards the capital.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Enters Delhi,</NOTE>Upon the fifth of Ribbi ul
Achir, in the year 792, he entered Delhi, and lighted at the palace of Jehan
Numa. Abu Bicker Shaw, in the other quarter of the city, called Firoseabad,
prepared himself for battle; and on the second of Jemmad ul Awil, the two
armies engaged in the streets of Firoseabad.

recruit his army. He himself, in the mean time, remained in the town of
Tillasar upon the banks of the Gang. Having experienced from first to
last, that the slaves of Firose Shaw were his declared enemies, he gave
orders to plunder all their estates in the neighbouring country, and to
slay them wherever they should be found. The Zemindars fell upon some
thousands, who had possessions in other parts of the empire, and
massacred them; while the farmers in general, disgusted with Abu
Bicker's government, which had been very oppressive, with∣held their rents,
and listed themselves under Mahummud Shaw.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Being joined by some Omrahs of note, he marches
to Delhi,</NOTE>In the mean time, the viceroy of Moultan, Chawas ul Muluck Suba
of Baha, Raï Sir, and many Omrahs of note having joined Ma∣hummud with
their forces, he collected, in a few days, an army of fifty thousand horse,
made the usual appointments in the empire to please his friends, and
advanced, a second time, towards Delhi. Abu Bicker Shaw had remained inactive
in that city, ever since his late victory. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and is again overthrown.</NOTE>He, however, drew
out his army at a village called Hin∣dali to oppose Mahummud, and was so
fortunate as to come off victorious once more. He drove Mahummud Shaw towards
Tilla∣sar, but contented himself with pursuing him three crores, and with
taking his baggage, and then returned to his capital.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon Chan defeat∣ed.</NOTE>Humaioon Chan, not
many days after the battle of Hindali, with the troops he had raised at
Samana, made another attempt upon the capital, but succeeded no better than
his father, being defeated at Pan∣niput, and obliged to retreat towards Samana.
But after all these suc∣cesses, Abu Bicker Shaw thought it unsafe to
leave the capital, being suspicious of a faction in the city, in favour of
Mahummud Shaw. Having at length punished some of the most disaffected,
he ventured to march about twenty crores towards Tillasar, where Mahummud
Shaw was again collecting an army.</P>

thousand chosen horse, to∣wards Abu Bicker. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahummud, by a forced march,</NOTE>When Abu Bicker
had drawn up his army, Mahummud made a quick motion to the left, and
passing the enemy's line, pushed forward to the capital. He there engaged
the troops of Abu Bicker who guarded the walls, and having set fire to the
Budaoon gate, forced his way into the city.

imperial palace, whither the citizens flocked to pay him their respects.</P>

Bicker Shaw, having closely pursued Mahummud, ar∣rived the same day
before the city; and having forced the guards which Mahummud Shaw had placed at
the gates, advanced to the palace, and drove Mahummud Shaw, whose troops had
dispersed themselves, quite out of the city. He was obliged to retreat
again to Tillasar, where he joined his army, having lost the major part of
his detachment in the action.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief of the slaves in∣vites Ma∣hummud to
Delhi.</NOTE>Some time having thus passed, without any decisive action,
Mu∣bushir Hagib, chief of the imperial slaves, known by the title of
Islam Chan, disgusted with Abu Bicker, wrote to Mahummud, that if he
would make another attempt upon the city, he would support him with the
greatest part of the slaves, who were under his direction. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abu Bicker abandons Delhi.</NOTE>Abu Bicker
hearing that Mahummud was again in mo∣tion, and having also discovered the
disaffection of the slaves and others in his army, shamefully abandoned
the capital, and fled with a small retinue to Mewat.</P>
<P>Mahummud Shaw, in the month of Ramzan, entered Delhi and ascended
the imperial throne. He gave the vizarit to Islam Chan, <PB N="356" REF="442"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1390. Higer. 793.</NOTE>to whom he
principally owed his restoration. When he found him∣self firmly
established, he ordered all the elephants which belonged to the slaves of
Firose Shaw, to be taken from them, and converted to his own use. The
slaves, inraged at this injustice, fled the city that night, and hastened
to join Abu Bicker. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahummud expels the slaves.</NOTE>Mahummud, upon
this desertion, turned out a few who remained, and ordered them upon pain of
death, never to appear in the city, where they had acquired such dangerous
influence. Notwithstanding of this decree, many slaves, unwilling to leave
Delhi, concealed themselves: a search was ordered to be made, and such as
were found, were massacred. Some of those poor wretches, upon this
occasion, cried out for mercy, affirming that they were originally Turks.
They were, upon this, ordered to pronounce the word Gurragurri, by which they
were immediately distinguished. All who sounded it with the accent of
Hindostan, were put to death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon, marching against Abu

arrived at Kotluh, Abu Bicker, by advice of Bahadr Nahir, surprized Humaioon
Chan in his camp. The prince, however, exerted his utmost efforts in
opposing the enemy, being gallantly supported by Islam Chan, drove Abu
Bicker, after a brave resistance, quite off the field. Ma∣hummud Shaw
marched at the same time, with great expedition, towards Mewat,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion in Attava quell∣ed.</NOTE>The Zemindars
of Attava, upon account of some grievance, rose at the same time in arms,
and ravaged Bittaram and the adjacent Per∣gunnahs. The Sultan marched against
them in person, and chasti∣sed them. The fort of Attava was levelled with
the ground, and Mahummud took the rout of Kinnoge and Tillasar, in the last
of which cities, he built a fort, which, from his own name, he called
Mahummud-abad.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier falsely ac∣cused of

Vi∣zier, was preparing to fly to Lahore and Moultan, to kindle in those
provinces the flames of rebellion. Mahummud hastened to the capital, and
charged Islam Chan with his treasonable intentions. The Vizier absolutely
denied the fact, but Jaju, a Hindoo and his own nephew, swore falsely
against him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is put to death.</NOTE>The Sultan being either
convinced of his Vizier's guilt, or instigated by a jealousy of his power,
condemned him to die. Chaja Jehan, who was perhaps a no small promoter of the
Vizier's fall, was advanced to his office. Muckurrib ul Muluck was, at the

which rendered him de∣lirious for some days. When he was in this condition,
news was brought, that Bahadr Nahir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An adherent of Abu

<HEAD>SECTION XXII. The Reign of NASIR UL DIEN MAMOOD SHAW, the son
of Mahummud Shaw.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1393. Higer. 790.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamood Shaw an in∣fant, placed on the throne.</NOTE>WHEN Secunder
Shaw yielded to the power of his fate, vio∣lent disputes arose among the
Omrahs, about the succession. They at last fixed upon Mamood, an infant
son of Sultan Mahum∣mud, whom they placed upon the throne, by the name of
Nasir ul dien Mamood Shaw; while Chaja Jehan remained in the Vizarit, and
absolute government of the state. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Promotions at court.</NOTE>The title of Muckirrib
Chan was conferred upon Muckirrib ul Muluck, with the high employ of Amir ul
Omrah, or Captain-General. Sadit Chan was appointed Barbeck<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord of the Audience.</NOTE>, Saring Chan governor of Debalpoor,
and Dowlat Chan Debire, nominated to the office of Aziz Mumalick<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Representative of the provinces.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Distractions in the em∣pire.</NOTE>The apparent
debility of the Empire, arising from the King's mi∣nority and dissentions
of the Omrahs, encouraged all the Hindoos around to kindle the flames of
rebellion; particularly those of the eastern provinces. Chaja Jehan, upon
this occasion, assumed the title of Sultan Shirki<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">King of the East.</NOTE>, and proceeded towards
Behar, with a great army. He soon reduced that country to obedience, and
having at the same time, forced the Prince of Bengal to pay him the
customary tribute, he returned, and fixed his residence at Jionpoor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier establishes himself at
Jionpoor.</NOTE>While Chaja Jehan thus established himself, in
opposition to his master, in the East, Saring Chan began to form an
independency in the West. Having, as Suba of Debalpoor, collected the troops
of the province of Moultan, and the north-west division of the empire, he
advanced against Shicha Gicker, who waited for him at Adjodin, about twelve
crores from Lahore. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gickers defeated.</NOTE>A battle immediately
ensued, and the Gickers being defeated, were obliged to take refuge among 
<PB N="360" REF="446"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1394. Higer. 797.</NOTE>the mountains of
Jimbo. Saring Chan, after this victory, left his brother Adil Chan in the
government of Lahore, and returned him∣self to Debalpoor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan marches to Biana and
Gualier.</NOTE>Sultan Mamood this year, having left Delhi in charge of
Muckir∣rib Chan, marched towards Gualier, and Biana, accompanied by Sadit Chan
and many of the chief Omrahs. When the King had arrived in the neighbourhood of
Gualier, Mubarick Chan, the son of Malleck Raja, Mullu Eckbal Chan the
brother of Raja Saring Chan, and Malleck Alla ul dien, conspired against
the life of Sadit Chan. But Sadit having timely information of the plot, slew
Mubarick Chan and Malleck Alla ul dien, while Eckbal escaped to Delhi. Though
the conspiracy was thus quashed, the confusions which were the
con∣sequences of it, obliged the Sultan to return to the capital, without
prosecuting the scheme of reducing those territories to obedience.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The gates of Delhi shut against
him.</NOTE>The distractions in the empire began now to multiply exceedingly.
The Sultan arriving in the neighbourhood of Delhi, Muckirrib Chan came out to
pay his respects. But having on his way under∣stood, that Sadit Chan had
sworn vengeance against him, for affording protection to Mullu Eckbal Chan,
he fled back to the city, and shutting the gates against the Prince,
prepared to make a resolute defence. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He goes over to the besieged.</NOTE>The city in
short was besieged for three months, till the King being assured that
the war was commenced and continued on account of Sadit Chan, accommodated
matters with Muckirrib, and in the month of Mohirrim 797, was admitted into
Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Sul∣tan set up by Sadit
Chan.</NOTE>Muckirrib, encouraged by the coming over of his Prince, marched the
next day out of the city, with all his force, against Sadit Chan; but he was
beat back with great loss. The rains had now come on, and it being
impossible for Sadit Chan to keep the field, he struck his tents, and
marched into Firose-abad. He immediately sent for <PB N="361" REF="447"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1393. Higer. 796.</NOTE>Nuserit Chan, the
son of Fatte Chan, and grandson of Firose Shaw, from Mewat, and set him
up in opposition to Mamood, by the title of Nasir ul dien Nuserit Shaw.
Under the name of this prince Sadit Chan began to manage the affairs of the
Sultanit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A faction ex∣pels Sadit Chan from
Firose-abad.</NOTE>But a new faction breaking out in his government,
disconcerted his measures. The slaves of Firose Shaw, disgusted
with his behavi∣our towards them, prevailed upon the keepers of the elephants
to join them. They forcibly placed Nuserit Shaw upon an elephant, advanced
against Sadit Chan, and drove him quite out of the city of Firose-abad,
before he had time to prepare for his own defence. To avoid one danger, the
unfortunate Sadit fell into another; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is slain.</NOTE>for having sought
protection under Muckirrib Chan, he was by him put to death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The uncom∣mon misfor∣tunes of the
empire.</NOTE>The misfortunes of the state daily encreased. The Omrahs of
Firose-abad, and of some of the provinces, espoused the cause of
Nu∣serit Chan. Those of Delhi, and others, supported the title of
Ma∣mood. The whole empire fell into a state of anarchy, confusion, and
distraction. A civil war was kindled in every corner, and, a thing unheard of
before, two Kings in arms against one another, re∣sided in one capital.
Things however remained in this unfortunate situation for three years, with a
surprising equality on both sides; for if one monarch's party had at any
time a superiority over the other, it was in singularity of misfortunes. It
was not a state of war, but a continued battle between the two cities:
Thousands were killed al∣most every day, and the place of the slain was
constantly supplied by reinforcements from different parts of the empire.
Some of the Su∣bas of the provinces took no part in this civil war. They hoped
to see the empire so weakened by public calamities, that they themselves
might become independant; and to lay a foundation for their future power, they
withheld the customary revenues.</P>
<P> <PB N="362" REF="448"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1396. Higer. 798.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions in the north-west provin∣ces.</NOTE>In the year
798, Saring Chan, governor of Debalpoor, having some differences with Chizer
Chan, governor of Moultan, made war upon him. After several engagements with
various success, victory de∣clared for Saring. He immediately seized
Moultan, became very powerful, and in the year following, advanced with a great
army to Samana, which he reduced to his obedience. Nuserit Chan dispatch∣ed
Tatar Chan, Suba of Panniput, and Malleck Almass, with an ar∣my against
him. They engaged Saring on the first of Mohorrim, in the year 799, gave him
a signal overthrow, and obliged him to fly to Moultan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The grand∣son of Amir Timur passes the

Mahummud Jehangire, the grandson of Amir Timur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tamerlane.</NOTE>, had built a bridge over the Sind<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Indus.</NOTE>, and that, having crossed that
river, he invested Outch. Saring immediately dispatched Malleck Tagge ul

reinforce Malleck Ali, Naib to the governor of Outch. Pier Mahummud hearing of
this army, advanced to the Bea, fell up∣on them by surprize, just as they
had crossed that river, defeated and drove them back into the stream;
so that more were drowned than fell by the sword. A few of the
discomfited army made the best of their way to Moultan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes Moultan.</NOTE>Pier Mahummud kept close
at the heels of the runaways, and obliged Saring Chan to shut himself up in
Moultan. After a siege of six months, he was obliged, for want of
provisions, to surrender at discretion; and being imprisoned, with all
his army, Mahummud took possession of the city. Saring, in a few days,
found means to escape: but the country remained in subjection to the
Moguls.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions at Delhi.</NOTE>But to return to
the transactions at Delhi. Mullu Eckbal Chan be∣ing disgusted with
Mamood, deserted him. He sent a message to <PB N="363" REF="449"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Higer. 799.</NOTE>Nuserit Shaw, to
desire leave to join him with his party. This offer was very readily
accepted; they met, went to the palace of Seri, and, upon the Koran, swore
mutual friendship, at the tomb of Chaja Cuttub ul dien Kaki. During these
transactions, Mamood with Muckirrib remained in the old city.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eckbal Chan's per∣fidy.</NOTE>The perfidious
Eckbal, about three days after his desertion, quarrelled with Nuserit Shaw,
and not regarding his oath, be∣gan to form a conspiracy against him.
Nuserit Shaw being in∣formed of the plot, found himself constrained to
quit the palace of Seri. The traitor fell upon him in his retreat, and took all
his elephants, treasure and baggage. The unfortunate prince, being in no
condition to keep the field, fled to his Vizier at Panniput.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A treaty be∣tween him and Sultan
Mamood.</NOTE>Eckbal took immediately possession of Firoseabad. His
power daily increased, and he now employed it to expel Mamood and Muckirrib
from the old city. At length, by the mediation of some Omrahs, peace was
concluded between the parties. But Eckbal, peculiarly perfidious, broke through
all the sacred ties of the treaty; and setting upon Muckirrib in his own
house, by surprize, slew him. He immediately seized the young Sul∣tan,
and left him nothing but his life and the name of Emperor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruins the af∣fairs of Nuse∣rit
Shaw.</NOTE>Eckbal, in the same year, marched from Delhi with Sultan Mamood,
against Nuserit Shaw, and Tatar Chan at Panniput. Tatar Chan, leaving his
elephants and baggage in the fort, passed, by forced marches, the army of
Eckbal, arrived before Delhi and invested it. Eckbal trusting to the
strength he left in Delhi, advanced and attacked Panniput, and took it the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1398. Higer. 800.</NOTE>third day, by
escalade. He then hastened back to Delhi, and Tatar Chan having failed in
his attempt upon that place, fled to his father in Guzerat. Eckbal entering the
city, began to regulate the government, which had fallen into the utmost
confusion. In the mean time, to compleat the miseries of the unhappy city
and empire, news arrived, that Amir Timur had crossed the Sind, with an
