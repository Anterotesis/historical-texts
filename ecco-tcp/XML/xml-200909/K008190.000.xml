<P>COULD the author, Sir, imagine that you was ac∣cessable only by the steps of flattery and panegyrick, he would at once assign to you the united virtues and abilities of a PITT, a JOHNSON
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of the Rambler.</NOTE>, and a MEAD. But as he cannot conceive any thing more nauseating to a sensible mind, will leave such <HI>polluted</HI> offerings, and <HI>mean</HI> artifices to those, who <HI>dreading your critic lash,</HI> would <HI>thereby</HI> be∣speak your partiality. A method of address this, which may at first perhaps, from its being a little <HI>unfashionable,</HI> seem to carry with it an air of vanity to some, with a de∣gree of pride to others; but as the author is not himself conscious of either, he will be as little affected by such constructions, as he is by the <HI>ingenious</HI> writings of those, who are said to have lashed the town with great humour and severity
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide C—LL and L—D'S <HI>reports</HI> of the play-house, in the two poems of the <HI>Rosciad</HI> and <HI>Actor.</HI> Also, C—N'S history of the manners and customs of London, in a paper call'd the <HI>Genius.</HI></NOTE>; whose particular freedom, and great illi∣berality towards <HI>him</HI> (the present author) will, he hopes, so far bias you in your opinion, on the one hand, and ex∣culpate him, on the other, as to prevent (should curiosity, <HI>for want of other inducements,</HI> engage your perusal of the following lines) any imputation or impeachment of <HI>that sort,</HI> however deserving you may think him of the <HI>lash</HI> in other respects; for though he is sensible <HI>their</HI> having acted
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>an illiberal part, is by no means a sufficient plea for him, yet he ventures to assert, that there are men in the world, who can be attacked no other way. Who have, nor know any other weapon, and who, if they do not find men guilty, will make them so: Such is the pride, malice and folly of the age we live in; which cannot, he appre∣hends, be more strongly exemplified than in the <HI>parson</HI> C—LL, <HI>lawyer</HI> C—N, and <HI>critic</HI> L—YD. Who,
<Q><L>Parties in wit, attend each other's call,</L>

<P>And to whose <HI>secret stabs</HI> is the present RETORT en∣tirely owing; for though it has been advertised under another title, yet the Author never intended it for the pub∣lick eye, but was willing to let his silence shew his con∣tempt for his accusers, 'till provok'd too far.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Author of the subsequent sheets remem∣bering somewhere to have met with an anecdote greatly parallel with his own case, humbly begs leave to recite it. And this he is the more desirous of, as he thinks it will sufficiently <HI>shew cause</HI> why he has mis∣employed so much of his Time, on subjects wholly un∣worthy his, and the publick's attention. An assertion strongly confirmed by a <HI>quaere</HI> the author had put to him the other day by a Gentleman conversing with him upon the intended plan of his Retort. Who immediately (and <HI>with great justice it must be admitted) interrogated</HI> him in the following words from <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q><L>Ten' moveat cimex PANTILIUS? (1) aut cruciet, qùod</L>
<L>Vellicet absentem DEMETRIUS? (2) aut quod ineptus</L>
<L>FANNIUS (3) Hermogenis laedat conviva Tigelli?</L>
<BIBL>SAT. X. Lib. 1.</BIBL></Q> 3nhich at first almost biassed the author into a resolution to suppress his intended publication. But at length, like <HI>Chal∣cas</HI> in the second Aeneid of <HI>Virgil, Magnis Clamoribus actus,</HI> of <HI>the Reverend cimex Pantilius</HI> and Co. <HI>composito rumpit vocem.</HI> And now most humbly submits himself and piece to the candor of the <HI>ingenuous</HI> public; avoiding <HI>their</HI> censure, being the height of his ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="5"/>THE anecdote intended to be recited, is as follows—<Q>When Demetrius was arraigned at Athens for tyranny, Menander was upon the verge of suffering death, on no other account whatever, than from a supposition and report prevailing of his being a friend and intimate of the traitor's.</Q> Like him has the present author been most illiberally brought under the same lash with a Gen∣tleman, whom the NOBLE TRIUMVIRATE have thought proper to censure, vilify, and defame. And like Me∣nander too, has he suffered this, on no other <HI>apparent</HI> ac∣count, than from a seeming intimacy and friendship sub∣sisting between him and this Gentleman.
<Q><L>Hinc <HI>sibi</HI> prima Mali Labes, hinc spargere Voces</L>
<L>In vulgum ambiguas.</L>
<BIBL>VIRG.</BIBL></Q>
But the Author would recommend it to this <HI>literary Po∣lyphemus</HI> and his two <HI>nefandi Cyclopes</HI> for the future, to be sure they strike a foe, and to act upon more liberal prin∣ciples, remembering,
<Q><L>If Maevius scribble in Apollo's spight,</L>
