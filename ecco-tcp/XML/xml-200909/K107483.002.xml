<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I AM an unhappy Young Woman, that want a little of your
<HI>Plain Dealing,</HI> and good <HI>Advice,</HI> to help me out in an Affair
of the utmost Consequence to my Peace. I am in too much pain, to make a
long In∣troduction; therefore hope you will excuse me, if I only send a
short Sketch of my Misfortune, without staying to pay my grateful Thanks,
for your agreeable Week∣ly Entertainments; which I can never enough Admire. I
hope you won't think me troublesome, if I relate the exact Situ∣ation of
Life, I at present am in. I live in a fine Old Seat in <HI>Surrey,</HI> which
wants nothing to render it delightful, to a Person of my Temper. Our Family
consists of my Father (who is a Widower) an old Maiden Aunt, two Sisters,
and my Self. My Father is a very good Man, and em∣ploys himself mostly in
his Study. My Aunt is of a reserv'd Temper, therefore suffers us to keep
but little Company, es∣pecially with Gentlemen. There is only one Person
allow'd that fatal Liberty! Whose Character I must make you acquaint∣ed 
<PB N="3" REF="4"/> with: But how, alas! shall I do that? Yet if there is
such a Thing as Perfection in Mankind, he certainly is Master of it. He has
so fine an Understanding in all Arts and Sciences (allow'd by his own Sex)
so great a Knowledge in every thing that is Polite and Agreeable, and,
withal, so sweet a Disposition, that I only wonder, I kept my Heart
so long free from his irresistable Charms! I have been pretty intimate
with him these Three Years, but did not know, 'till within these Three
Months, that my Happiness or Misery, depended intirely up∣on him. In
short, I feel so violent a Pas∣sion in my Breast, that unless I
have some speedy Relief, Death will soon put a Pe∣riod to my Sorrow! How
often have I sate contemplating his Virtues and Charms, 'till my Soul has
almost dissolv'd away in Ten∣derness and Love! I sigh, I die for him;
while he views me with Cold Indifference, or, at best, but Luke-warm
Friendship: Tyrant Custom, and innate Modesty, for∣bid my Tongue to utter
the Tortures of my Heart. He sometimes laughs, and says, I am all Charms;
Oh! what wou'd I give to have him really think so! He behaves exactly alike
to my self, and Sisters, and yet I can't help being jealous, if he speaks
or looks at them. I am all Madness and De∣spair! I han't the Vanity to
think I can ever please a Man of his Sense and Judg∣ment, and yet I go on
to love! Sometimes <PB N="4" REF="5"/> I think my constant Passion will be
re∣warded, and that he will like me for my good Nature, which some People
flatter me, and tell him, I have a great Share of: And as it is a Qualification
he very much admires, I strive every Day, to improve it, and to command all
those little Passions that are incident to our Sex. Was I suf∣fer'd to
plead for my self, I cou'd tell him, What an obedient Wife I'd make him! How
my Duty and Inclinations wou'd both concur, to please him in all Actions of
my Life! When he was absent, I wou'd enter∣tain my self with his dear Idea!
and when he return'd, meet him with inexpressible Raptures! I cou'd dwell
for ever on the in∣chanting Subject: But fear I should grow tiresome. This
opening of my Grief has been some Relief. I almost fear to have this
published: I wish, yet dread, he should discover me. I don't know what
to do: Therefore rely wholly upon your Advice. If you print it, correct the bad
<HI>English</HI>; if you burn it, Remember and Pity</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>The poor</HI> LUCINDA!</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>WHAT constant Companions are <HI>Merit</HI> and
<HI>Humility?</HI> How does this Lady conclude a Letter that must charm
<HI>every Reader. If you print it, correct the bad English.</HI> It is too
good to be corrected. Sincerity, and everlast∣ing Tenderness shine forth,
in every Sentence. That Person who does not plainly perceive, 
<PB N="5" REF="6"/> that what <HI>Lucinda</HI> has written, flow'd from her
Heart, must have his own Heart ill pla∣ced, and removed out of the Way of
<HI>Nature.</HI> If Men could write thus, no Woman of Sense would be ever
courted in vain: When she signifies so <HI>plainly</HI> that she loves
him from her Heart; how cordially does she labour to make that
<HI>Plainness</HI> still <HI>plainer,</HI> if possible, as she
proceeds still <HI>farther</HI> in her Letter. These plain Phrases are
the Master-touches of <HI>Nature,</HI> and put <HI>Art</HI> out of
Countenance. This is the natural Simplicity, that makes the <HI>proud</HI>
Scholar's Ornaments look <HI>poor.</HI> Any body, that knows what Love is, will
not barely <HI>read,</HI> but <HI>feel</HI> this Lady's Letter. Old as I am, my
self, how am I warm'd, when, she expresses her Tenderness. And, if
every <HI>unconcerned</HI> Person be her <HI>Well-wisher,</HI> what
<HI>Emotions</HI> must this Letter be able to raise in the Bosom of that
happy Man, whom it <HI>concerns.</HI> Will not her Prudence, her vow'd
Obedience, her Study to please, her Humi∣lity, and being unconscious of the
greatest Worth in her self; her whole Pride placed in admiring him, her
Adoration, almost, of his superior Merit; her desiring, and yet
diffi∣ding, to deserve him: Will not all these win over his Soul to her?
Where she describes to him, how she will behave in his Presence, and
how in his Absence; what a Figure must she make in the Imagination of
this ad∣mired Man? Must she not be as much admi∣red, as she admires? Does
she not force him <PB N="6" REF="7"/> to what she so earnestly
<HI>wishes?</HI> The God of Love lives, breathes and acts, in every Line of
it, and nothing less than THAT VERY MAN, who, as she says, <HI>If there
be such a thing as Perfection in Mankind, is certainly Master of it,</HI>
can be a <HI>suitable Prize,</HI> for her <HI>Merit.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been reported concerning the <HI>finest Orator,</HI> of
the present Age, that the Lady, to whom he was married, grew his
<HI>Wife,</HI> by being his <HI>Client.</HI> He had long been acquaint∣ed with
her Patience, Temper and Spirit, by her Manner of soliciting her own Cause:
He knew her Fortune, which depended upon it; she gave him such full and
elegant Instructi∣ons, as few profess'd Lawyers could have Penn'd, and as
scarce needed his own power∣ful Assistance and Amendment. He ask'd her,
who had drawn them? and being in∣formed her self had been the Compiler, it is
no wonder, that so much Wit, in so agree∣able a Person, made that
greatest of Orators, whose Addresses no Lady could withstand, from
that Moment, her Suiter, and, conse∣quently, her Husband.—</P>
<P>I HAVE often wish'd, to be fully satisfied of the Truth of
this little beautiful Piece of Secret History.—But whether it be true
in all its Circumstances, it was not invented by one, who meant to malign the
Fame of that Lord, or the Merit of his Lady, since a more glorious Accident
could not well be assigned, to have brought about the Marri∣age of so
illustrious a Pair.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>THE Letter, which now lies before me, is the
most exquisite Plea that ever my Eyes beheld. I know some who
understand not what Love is, will be offended at a Woman's first declaring
her Passion. How sensible is the Fair One of this, when she cries
out, <HI>Tyrant Custom and innate Modesty, forbid my Tongue to utter the
Tortures of my Heart.</HI>—By <HI>Lucinda</HI>'s Leave, she
<HI>herself,</HI> is too rigid and severe <HI>against herself.</HI>
Custom, indeed, does forbid it, and a Tyrannical Custom it is, because,
though pretendedly grounded upon the Colours of Modesty, 'tis unjust, 'tis
un∣natural, and irreligious at the Bottom.—Is it not <HI>modest,</HI>
as well as <HI>natural,</HI> to have an Inclination to be honourably married?
She that has <HI>not</HI> an Inclination, <HI>before</HI> she is ask'd, can
hardly, with Truth, declare <HI>Inclination</HI>: And if it was an Inclination
vertuous and honourable from the Beginning; it must have been equally
vertuous and honourable from the Beginning to have owned it. A dull and
obstinate Concealment of the Truth, 'till it <HI>happens</HI> to be
<HI>extorted,</HI> is a <HI>Triumph</HI> given to <HI>Folly</HI> over
<HI>Nature,</HI> for the Sake of a <HI>mistaken Modesty.</HI> Both Sexes,
if they will but reflect, must <HI>agree</HI> in this
<HI>Truth.</HI>—</P>
<P>WHAT Batchelor of good Sense would not be overjoy'd to
discover a <HI>Lucinda,</HI> thus opening in his own Favour? The Man who
disliked a Woman for declaring her Approba∣tion of him, would be like one,
who seck∣ing for a Silver Mine, and discovering by <PB N="8" REF="9"/>
chance, a Golden one, shou'd desert it, for no other Reason, but
because good Fortune had put it in his Way.—</P>
<P>THERE is a vast deal of Delight in con∣templating the Beauties
of a Woman's Mind, who could write thus delicately. How hap∣py would she make
her Husband? She would sooth any Sorrow that could <HI>reach</HI> him, and
<HI>exalt</HI> his <HI>Pleasures</HI> into <HI>Raptures</HI>; she would be
his <HI>Comfort</HI> in <HI>Adversity,</HI> and <HI>gild</HI> and
<HI>adorn</HI> his <HI>Prosperity</HI>; she would <HI>gladden</HI> his
<HI>Youth,</HI> and <HI>cherish</HI> his <HI>Age</HI>; give more
<HI>Warmth</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> to the <HI>Summer</HI> of his <HI>Life,</HI>
and yield <HI>Gaity</HI> and <HI>Refreshment</HI> to his <HI>Winter</HI>;
she would give <HI>Wings</HI> to his <HI>Business</HI> Abroad, and
<HI>divert</HI> him at Home, with her <HI>Conversation</HI>; she would fill
up the <HI>Vacuities</HI> of <HI>Solitude,</HI> with Discourse, that was
prefer∣rable to the <HI>Company</HI> of <HI>Wits</HI>; no <HI>Nights</HI> could
be <HI>tedious</HI> by her Side; and <HI>Day-light</HI> would be made more
<HI>chearful</HI> by <HI>looking</HI> upon her.</P>
<P>BUT I draw towards a Conclusion as fast as I can, for fear of
hindring any longer, what I would speedily unite. I fancy my self to be
this Minute, with my Paper, in the Parlour of that fine Old Seat in <HI>Surrey.
Lucinda</HI> and her Lover, have both hold of the <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> who
tells them his Senti∣ments like the Father of them both.—I hear him
reading, I see her wishing, and yet dreading to be discovered.—I
wish the Dis∣covery my self—Methinks I see it, and hear 
<PB N="9" REF="10"/> him say—<HI>You are</HI> Lucinda; <HI>I have often
told you, You are all Charms. There wants no∣thing but your Consent to make
us the happy Couple here described—Lucinda,</HI> trembling, holds the
Paper as she would let it drop—Now, if I could make my Paper speak,
it should say, <HI>Do, drop me from between you; join Hands over a more
Sacred Writing—It is so promising a Match, that the</HI> Plain Dealer
<HI>is to act the</HI> Father <HI>in it—If you have not imme∣diate
Opportunities—If you apprehend any Hin∣drance—Stay not a Moment
where you are—Take a Tour to</HI> Blunt-Hall <HI>together—The</HI>
Clergyman <HI>of our</HI> Assembly, <HI>shall join your Hands, and
bless your Wishes, and you may keep your Wedding at the</HI> ancient Seat
<HI>of the</HI> Blunt<HI>'s, since it will be so happy an Example to many
Maids, who have been scared so long, by a silly groundless Custom,
from speaking their Minds in an Affair, on which depends all their
Feli∣city.</HI></P>

<P>IT is the Duty of a Patriot to mourn for those growing Evils,
which seem to threaten, either the Safety, or the Honour of his Country: And,
for this Reason, I have often been, irresistably chagrin'd, at the
Cor∣ruption of our Publick <HI>Theatres.</HI>—But I was, lately,
enliven'd into <HI>Hope,</HI> upon this Subject; and am glad, I can assure
my Rea∣der, that there is a Spirit of Improvement at Work, to sustain our
sinking Taste, and set Examples for our present Stages.</P>
<P>THERE is a generous Boldness, as well in the <HI>Design</HI>
itself, as in the <HI>Time</HI> of putting it in Execution. But nothing is
more certain, than that it is form'd upon a Plan, which if it meets with the
propos'd Encouragement, will go a great Way toward keeping the Hearts of the
Gay World from breaking, should so dreadful a Misfortune happen, as that
the God of Wit revenges himself upon the pro∣stituted <PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Theatres in Fashion, by making Peo∣ple asham'd of <HI>appearing,</HI> where
they ought to blush at their Entertainment.</P>
<P>I AM transported to this Pitch of Joy, up∣on having Landed at
<HI>Westminster</HI> Stairs, in my Way from <HI>Barbican,</HI> to the
<HI>Abbey Cloi∣sters</HI> (where I often muse, on Subjects which, a long
Time hence, may fill <HI>Plain Dealers)</HI> and met, in the King's Highway, a
Party-colour'd younger Brother, of the justly-cele∣brated Mr.
<HI>Lun.</HI>—He was usher'd along in great State, with a sounding
Drum in his <HI>Front,</HI> and a Trumpet, and <HI>French</HI> Horn, plac'd
like Wings, on either <HI>Flank</HI>; while the <HI>Rear</HI> was brought up by
a Body of scatter'd <HI>Velites,</HI> the flying Fragments of Humanity!</P>
<P>THE <HI>Checquer'd Nuntio,</HI> as I pass'd him, stopt; and
nodded his loose Head at me: Snatching off his Pigmy Hat, by the Rab∣bit's
Tail which was annex'd to it: And, tripping toward me, with a wanton
<HI>Waviness,</HI> like the Curling of a Ship's long Pendant, when it dances
in a Breeze, slipt a <HI>Billet</HI> into my Hand; and, retreating, with a
merry Shrugg, or two, resum'd his Post as before, and gave Continuance to
the Procession.</P>
<P>FROM the ludicrous Turn of his Figure, I open'd the Paper he gave
me, with very humble Expectation: But was struck with no small Reverence,
when I beheld the <HI>Royal Arms,</HI> magisterially display'd at the Head
of it: And These surprizing Particulars pro∣mulg'd, under the Stamp of
such a known Authority!</P>

<P>I FOUND myself not a little delighted, upon perusing this
<HI>Notification,</HI> to be assur'd, in so Authentick a Manner, that we
have <HI>His Majesty's Permission,</HI> to be <HI>better
accommo∣dated</HI> than we have been. For, from this, <HI>in∣tentional,</HI>
Royal Grace, I grew sanguine enough to expect, a very sudden Revocation of
certain Grants, for Monopolizing the <HI>Art of Conjuring</HI>; and of
bewitching the King's Liege People out of all sober Use, as well of their
<HI>Money</HI> as their <HI>Senses.</HI>—I enter'd, therefore, with
Pleasure, on the Divisions of my printed Billet: And began, with a
Criti∣cal Eye, to examine what Likelihood there was, that <HI>Hero</HI> and
<HI>Leander,</HI> should be too hard for the <HI>Devil,</HI> and his
<HI>Double Favourites.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Live Punch,</HI> though they seem to build much upon
him, I cou'd consider as no great Rarity.—Not that I wou'd derogate, in
the least, from that Respect, which is due to his Character: But he has
<HI>Brothers</HI> upon both Stages, as much <HI>alive</HI> as himself, with
the Advantage of being more incomprehen∣sible. <PB N="14" REF="15"/>—<HI>Punch</HI> will be <HI>understood,</HI> with so little
Difficulty, that our People of <HI>Polite Taste,</HI> will never be able to
<HI>bear</HI> him.—But, when I had read about half a Line lower, and came
to that Part of the Declaration, which promises, <HI>That the Actors of
this</HI> new Company, <HI>shall be</HI> ARTIFICIAL, I was presently at
Ease again: For, in that Case, I saw, most certainly, that there must
be No∣velty in their Design; since nothing is more generally allow'd, with
Regard to the <HI>other</HI> Companies, than, That, for <HI>One</HI> of their
Actors, who is <HI>Artificial,</HI> Six are absolutely <HI>Naturals.</HI></P>
<P>I GATHER'D much Consolation too, from that other welcome
Assurance, That the Di∣versions of <HI>this</HI> Royal Company, are to be
very <HI>Changeable,</HI> and <HI>Consistivarious.</HI> The Town has,
Annually, for some Years past, been <HI>dieted,</HI> by the <HI>Playhouse
Doctors:</HI> And gone through a <HI>Regular Course of Bitters,</HI> with a
most laudable Spirit of <HI>Meekness,</HI> and true Christian
<HI>Resignation</HI>—Their <HI>Wit</HI> was fall'n <HI>Sick,</HI> and
submitted to <HI>Quack Potions:</HI> Because Mountebank Stages, by being
<HI>Li∣cens'd,</HI> had the Reputation of <HI>College Practice:</HI> (And, to
poison by <HI>Authority,</HI> has the good Fortune to be <HI>no
Felony</HI>).—So that nothing is more certain, than that the
<HI>Wooden</HI> Com∣pany, will have the Advantage of our <HI>Brazen</HI> Ones,
in this important Point, <HI>the Changeable.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, as for the <HI>Consistivarious,</HI> the old Workmen, I
am afraid, will be more than a <PB N="15" REF="16"/> Match for the new
Ones.—I am not, in∣deed, so able a Critick, in the Language of these
Wooden Orators, as to decide, with any absolute Sufficiency, the
Signification of a Word, so Derivative and Complex, as
<HI>Consi∣stivarious:</HI> But, if I am fortunate enough, to have rightly
broke in upon so impregnable a <HI>Decomposite,</HI> then, I am sure, I
may safely affirm, That our Stage's Conduct, ever since I can remember it,
has been <HI>truly Consistiva∣rious,</HI> in the most remarkable and
surprizing Manner.—Nay, a <HI>Triumvir</HI> of that de∣tach'd
Administration, the accomplished Au∣thor of a <HI>Tragedy,</HI> which we
are to be admit∣ted to the Honour of <HI>admiring,</HI> in the Front of this
happy Season, is, I am sure, so re∣nown'd for his
<HI>Consistivariousness,</HI> that one wou'd almost be induc'd to
swear, That the very <HI>Word</HI> was of his <HI>own making,</HI> and
coin'd, on Purpose, for his <HI>New Tragedy.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, here let me correct a false Report, which this Great Writer
suffers under, by the Means of some, who envy him the Honours which are due
to his <HI>undoubting Genius:</HI>—It is said, the Name of his New
Tragedy is to be <HI>Caesar in Egypt.</HI> But I assure all Chri∣stian
People, that though <HI>Caesar,</HI> may stand, in Capitals, on the
<HI>Title Page,</HI> yet that shou'd only be consider'd as an <HI>Error of
the Press</HI>; which the Buyer may <HI>correct</HI> with Ease, by reading
CIBBER <HI>in Egypt,</HI> instead of CAESAR: And, with that small
Alteration, every Thing in this Tragedy, will be found <PB N="16" REF="17"/>
extremely Natural; and stand directly, as it <HI>shou'd</HI> be.</P>
<P>THE Spirit, however of our new Under∣takers, at the
<HI>White-Hart,</HI> is inflam'd into an enterprizing and smart
<HI>Emulation!</HI> And I was very much taken with the Turn of this brisk
Defiance—That, tho' they may pass for <HI>Nobodies,</HI> because they
are made of <HI>Wood</HI>; yet, since they have the Good Luck to be <HI>five
Foot high,</HI> they see no Reason to suppose their Adversaries to be
<HI>more than their Match</HI>; and will, therefore, <HI>perform with such
Nicety, as not to be distinguish'd from them</HI>; and doubt not in the
least, to give an <HI>equal Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>AS for the next Paragraph, I fear it was purposely embroider'd
over, with those <HI>Like∣wises,</HI> and <HI>Also's,</HI> for no other
Reason in the World, but to cover a conscious Deficiency in the
<HI>Sense,</HI> by the Eloquent Glare of the
<HI>Ex∣pression.</HI>—For, who does not observe, That <HI>Dancing
of Jigs, Masquerades, and Sarabands,</HI> are Improvements in Learning, which
the happy Genius of our <HI>Nobility,</HI> and the vast Encouragement they
give to <HI>Wit,</HI> have brought, already, to their full Perfection?—I
can't see, therefore, what Novelty can be expected, in this Particular:
Unless, when they give Notice, That <HI>All their Performers are to be Wooden
ones,</HI> they wou'd have us understand it, that, by Aid of some <HI>third
Faustus,</HI> their <HI>Fiddles</HI> are to fall a <HI>Dancing,</HI> and keep

I have very little to say for, with Regard to its
<HI>Newness.—Cupid</HI>'s <HI>Paradise</HI> may please at first,
but will flatten, if they shew it often.—The <HI>Court of Foreign
Kings</HI> is no such <HI>Rarity</HI> as they think it.—But, for every
Figure to be <HI>dress'd,</HI> according to their <HI>own Country
Fashion.</HI>—That, indeed, is a Stroke of <HI>Decorum,</HI> which
out-soars, at one Flight, <HI>Patent, License,</HI> and <HI>Charter!</HI>
And it will be reasonable to hope, after the Publick Taste has been so
refin'd, by these <HI>Chips of a new Block,</HI> that we shall see no
more Intermixture of the Ancient, with the Modern Dresses: Where the Order
of Things is so capriciously revers'd, that the Courtiers of an
<HI>English</HI> Monarch shall stand round him, like <HI>Beaux of
Yesterday;</HI> and the Sovereign himself strut about, in Trunk Breeches,
and be dress'd, as <HI>old</HI> as a <HI>Patriarch.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is, in the next Article, an odd kind of Mystery, which I
own I could not fathom: And, I frankly confess, I was, once, afraid, there
might be a <HI>Plot</HI> in it.—I puzzled my Imagination, till I was
weary of imagin∣ing.—But, the more I mus'd upon it, the <HI>less</HI> I
was able to <HI>make,</HI> of that strange <HI>High-German Artist, who was
to shake an empty Bag, inside out, that we might see, there was nothing
in it: And, then, rain Gold and Eggs out of it.</HI></P>
<P>IT was easily to be discern'd, that the <HI>Scene</HI> was
<HI>shifted</HI> in this Place.—The <HI>Play-houses</HI> 
<PB N="18" REF="19"/> could have nothing to do with the Pa∣ragraph: None of
<HI>Their</HI> Bags, for some Years past, having been <HI>Empty</HI> enough
to turn in∣side outward. So that I was greatly per∣plex'd, by the
Knottiness of this Difficulty: Till I, luckily, bethought myself of a
Friend of mine, a <HI>Decypherer</HI>; whose surprizing Dexterity, levell'd
every Rub in his Way, and made it as plain, as a Demonstration, That the
empty Bag was the <HI>South-Sea Scheme.</HI>—That the Golden Showers were
the <HI>sudden Sallies of that Stock:</HI> And, that the <HI>Eggs</HI> were
the <HI>sucking Bubbles,</HI> that were <HI>hatch'd</HI> under the Warmth of
it.</P>
<P>I SHOULD have been <HI>lost,</HI> in this <HI>Desart,</HI> if
I had not return'd, to make a Remark, concerning the <HI>Modesty</HI> of our
new Comedi∣ans.—How praise-worthy is their Genero∣sity, and the
Disinterestedness of their Spirit! Who, after putting themselves to the
two-fold Charge of <HI>building,</HI> both their <HI>Stage,</HI> and their
<HI>Performers,</HI> propose to act, notwith∣standing, at <HI>Lower
Rates,</HI> than their Rivals; which Last go on to <HI>demolish,</HI> as
fast as their Competitors can <HI>build up:</HI> And yet, have the Courage to
<HI>raise</HI> their Prices, because they <HI>fall</HI> their
Entertainments.</P>
<P>THEN, how just, and how <HI>Sympathetical,</HI> is another Care
of our Wooden Reformers!—Being perfectly acquainted with the Talents of a
Modish Audience, they have judiciously determined to provide Room for the
<HI>Coaches</HI> and <HI>Chairs,</HI> in the same Para∣graph 
<PB N="19" REF="20"/> with the <HI>Gentlemen.</HI>—Their Thoughts were
more upon <HI>Merit,</HI> than upon <HI>Good Breeding</HI>;—And since
they knew that their <HI>Kindred Vehicles</HI> were as <HI>able Judges,</HI> as
their <HI>Owners,</HI> and (which is of more Consequence) as
<HI>well-dress'd</HI> too; they, therefore, thought it but reasonable to
treat 'em with equal Re∣verence.</P>
<P>WHAT kind of <HI>Play,</HI> that may be, which any
<HI>Gentleman</HI> and <HI>Lady,</HI> who give Notice before-hand, are to be
diverted with <HI>in Pri∣vate,</HI> I must make a Personal Search into,
before I undertake to consider it.—But, upon the Whole, I believe,
there can be no manner of Doubt, but that <HI>The White-Hart, in St.
Margaret</HI>'s-<HI>Lane,</HI> may bid as fair for <HI>Fine Audiences,</HI> as
any of the Rest of our Theatres; where, though the Actors are not <HI>of
Wood,</HI> they have usurp'd the Province of <HI>Wooden Actors.</HI></P>

<P>WHEN I read, with Admiration, the great <HI>Actions</HI> of an
<HI>Alexander,</HI> a <HI>Caesar,</HI> or a <HI>Tamerlane</HI>; or an charm'd
by the more powerful <HI>Writings</HI> of a <HI>Homer,</HI> a <HI>Virgil,</HI>
or a <HI>Cicero,</HI> I am fir'd with an impatient Longing, to conceive their
Turn of <HI>Person, Air,</HI> and <HI>Features.</HI> And when my Fancy
(forc'd to travel without a Guide) has tir'd itself with vain Endeavours to
<HI>grasp</HI> Ideas, that are <HI>thin,</HI> and <HI>fleeting,</HI> I lament
that the <HI>Materials</HI> of the <HI>Painter</HI>'s <HI>noble Art,</HI> are
not as <HI>lasting</HI> as the <HI>Painter</HI>'s Fame is. For, in that
case, Two <HI>Sister Arts,</HI> uniting their different Pow∣ers, the one
transmitting <HI>Souls,</HI> the other <HI>Bodies,</HI> (or the outward Form
of Bodies) their combining Influence would be of Force to frustrate <HI>Death
itself:</HI> And all the Ages of the World would seem to be
<HI>Cotempo∣raries.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, here, the <HI>Poet</HI> triumphs. His Works <HI>outlive</HI>
the <HI>Painter</HI>'s, though the Pain∣ter <PB N="21" REF="22"/> begins much
sooner to be famous, than the Poet does: And has also commonly the
Advantage over him, with Relation to <HI>For∣tune:</HI> The strongest
Reasons of which Diffe∣rence, I have lately read, with Pleasure, in the
following Letter, from an excellent, and learned, Critick, whom I spoke of,
in a late Paper, and whose <HI>Encouragement,</HI> I am afraid, is (to the
future Reproach of our Age) most shamefully disproportioned to his
<HI>Merit.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is something extremely <HI>new,</HI> in the Subject, as
well as the Sentiments, of this Letter: And I will, therefore, take the

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I KNOW not whether I should return you Thanks for your last
Visit or not, because I know not whether I am indebted to Fortune, or to
You for it. But I am obliged to take Notice, in a particular Man∣ner, of the
Desire you express'd, during our being together, that I would have my
<HI>Picture drawn.</HI></P>
<P> AFTER I have omitted it so many Years, I would not have it
drawn at last by a <HI>Bungler,</HI> and I am not in a Condition at
present, to satisfy one who is a Master; nor do I know whether we have
any Master, <PB N="22" REF="23"/> who would make me a <HI>Present</HI> of
it: Though a Painter is much more able to <HI>give,</HI> than a Poet to
<HI>buy</HI>; which has put me upon consider∣ing, what are the Reasons
which make the <HI>Painter</HI> so successful, and the <HI>Poet</HI> so
un∣fortunate; that make the Art of Poetry, and the Art of Painting, which are
Sisters, so very <HI>Resembling,</HI> by <HI>Nature,</HI> so very
<HI>Dif∣ferent,</HI> by <HI>Fortune.</HI></P>
<P> A great <HI>Poet,</HI> for the most Part, neglects and
affronts <HI>Fortune,</HI> by making his Court to <HI>Fame</HI>; but Fame and
<HI>Fortune</HI> are <HI>Rivals,</HI> that contend with each other, which
shall heap most Favours upon the deserving <HI>Pain∣ter.</HI> All the
great Painters that have ap∣peared among us, have had Justice done to their
Merit while they <HI>liv'd,</HI> and no <HI>Sign-post-Painter</HI> has ever
yet pass'd for a <HI>great Master.</HI> All the Painters, whom our Kings
have delighted to employ, have been Ma∣sters, as <HI>Holbin, Rubens, Vandyck,
Leeley, Ryley, Kneller,</HI> and <HI>Thornhill.</HI></P>
<P> BUT the contrary of this has happened with Regard to
<HI>Poets.</HI> Several good ones, nay, several of the <HI>best,</HI> have
been neglect∣ed during their <HI>Life-time,</HI> as <HI>Spencer, Mil∣ton,
Butler, Otway,</HI> among ourselves, and among the Ancients, <HI>Homer</HI>;
while the most contemptible of all Scriblers have been Esteemed and
Honoured. Our Kings them∣selves have, more than once, had such vile
Scriblers for <HI>their Poets,</HI> and have, like For∣tune, taken a Pleasure
in <HI>exalting Fools.</HI> <PB N="23" REF="24"/> But tho' a King can give a Man
Title and Place, only GOD can give him <HI>Genius.</HI> 'Tis the Prerogative of
a King to make a <HI>Knight,</HI> but only GOD can make a <HI>Poet.</HI></P>
<P> THE Reasons of the Difference which we sometimes find, in
the Fortunes of great <HI>Poets</HI> and <HI>Painters,</HI> appear to me to be
chiefly these which follow:</P>
<P> The First is, That the great Painter, for each of his
Master-pieces, has but <HI>one</HI> Ori∣ginal, and no <HI>Copy</HI> can come
up to the easie Grace and the natural Force of a beau∣tiful
<HI>Original</HI>; whereas, of masterly Poems, there are as many Originals,
as there are true Copies; and all of them have equal Force, and equal Grace and
Beauty; and this is none of the least Things that render the Works of the
Painter so precious, and the Artist himself so fortunate. A Man may buy
the Works of <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI> for a very Trifle, whereas
those of <HI>Raphael</HI> are above any Value. But this multiplying of
Originals gives the great <HI>Poet,</HI> at least, one Ad∣vantage over the
famous <HI>Painter,</HI> which is, that it renders what he writes perpetual.
<HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> are immortal in their <HI>Works,</HI> but
<HI>Zeuxis</HI> and <HI>Apelles</HI> are only so in their <HI>Fame.</HI></P>
<P> ANOTHER Reason of this Difference, is, The Universality of
the Language in which the Painter delivers his Art: The great Painter speaks
to all Countries as intelligibly, as to his own, nay, more intelligibly, more
gracefully, and more forcibly, to those <PB N="24" REF="25"/> Countries which
are polite; and, therefore, his Fame keeps equal Pace with his Merit; and
where-ever he goes, both Fortune and Fame attend him. The more his Pieces are
known, the more they are desired, and the more dearly purchased. The
greatest of Kings are ambitious to be Masters of them, and ambitious to
possess the <HI>Painters,</HI> as well as their Works. What modern Poet,
during his <HI>Life-time,</HI> was ever <HI>read</HI> by so many Sovereign
Princes, as were <HI>drawn</HI> by the Hand of <HI>Titian?</HI> What Prince
ever heap'd those Honours on a Poet, that <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Fifth</HI>
did on <HI>Titian?</HI> Did the renowned <HI>Augustus</HI> himself, with
all his Capacity, and all his Greatness of Mind, so Honour <HI>Ho∣race</HI>
or <HI>Virgil?</HI> Now, while the Painter's Fame and Fortune are unconfin'd,
those of the greatest of our <HI>English</HI> Poets are restrain∣ed to
the Islands of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> that is, to
less than <HI>Twenty Millions of People,</HI> of which, perhaps, there are
hardly <HI>Five hundred</HI> which have a fine Taste of Poetry.</P>
<P> ANOTHER Reason of the Difference in the Fortunes of great
Painters and Poets, with regard to Painting after the <HI>Life,</HI> is the
darling <HI>Interest,</HI> and the darling <HI>Passion</HI> of both
Sexes, and especially of the Women; no Motive is generally so predominant,
as that of Self-Interest, no Passion so vehe∣ment and so ardent as
Self-Love. Now the Generality of both Sexes look upon their <HI>Persons,</HI>
as their <HI>very selves.</HI> It is their <PB N="25" REF="26"/> Persons,
then, which they ardently desire should be advantageously known, and
fairly distinguished, and should remain after them. This the great
<HI>Painter</HI> alone can perform, who is sure to draw the best
Like∣ness, and yet, at the same Time, to distin∣guish a Face, from all
other Faces what∣ever, which 'tis impossible that the greatest
<HI>Poet</HI> in the World, can ever do, by <HI>De∣scription.</HI></P>
<P> ANOTHER Reason of the foresaid Dif∣ference, is, That few
Persons pretend to decide sovereignly in <HI>Painting,</HI> but they who
are acquainted with the Rules of the Art, and who, besides the Reading
Ancient and Modern History, understand <HI>Geometry, Perspective,</HI>
and <HI>Anatomy</HI>; whereas the Rab∣ble of Mankind pretending to judge of
<HI>Poetry,</HI> sovereignly, and without Appeal, wretched
<HI>Poetasters</HI> have been often <HI>applau∣ded,</HI> and <HI>excellent
Poets neglected,</HI> because the former write most to the
<HI>Capacity</HI> of the <HI>Rabble.</HI> And there is one Thing, which I have
formerly mentioned, and which I have often observed, and always with fresh
Surprize, That the Rabble, by their Noise, their Clamours, and their
Obstinacy, have often drawn in Men who have pass'd for Men of Sense, to
affirm their unrighteous Decrees; whereas the Men of Sense, with all their
Judgment, and with all their Per∣severance, have never been able to draw in
the Rabble, without the Assistance of <HI>Time.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/> THERE is still another Reason of the
foresaid Difference in the Fortunes of great Poets and Painters, which is
this; Most Men are very sensual; and Pleasure of <HI>Sense</HI>
af∣fects them, more than Pleasure merely <HI>In∣tellectual.</HI> They love to
have their Under∣standings informed by their Senses, because that
Instruction gives them <HI>Pleasure,</HI> with∣out any Mixture of Pain,
which always, in some measure, accompanies Labour and great Attention. And
of all the Senses, they love chiefly to be instructed by the
<HI>Sight,</HI> because the Instruction that comes that Way, is attended
with the least <HI>La∣bour.</HI> And if it be true, that there are no
<HI>innate Ideas</HI>; if it be true, that there is no∣thing in the
Understanding, but what was in the <HI>external Sense before,</HI> then the
Me∣thod of Instruction used by the <HI>Painter,</HI> is the very Method
wich <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> have taken to instruct us. And this is
the Cause of that extraordinary Pleasure which Men receive from
<HI>Painting,</HI> as <HI>Aristotle</HI> has ob∣served in the Fourth
Chapter of his Art of <HI>Poetry.</HI> And, in this, the <HI>Painter</HI> has
in∣finitely the Advantage of the <HI>Poet.</HI> The Painter informs the
Understanding, and warms the Imagination, by striking the <HI>Sight</HI>
strongly, and giving it the Height of Pleasure; while all that can be done,
of that kind, by the greatest Poet that ever liv'd, is to make us vainly
<HI>imagine,</HI> that he sets Things before our <HI>Eyes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28"/> THUS have I laid before you some of the
chief Reasons of the Difference that is found in the Fortunes of
<HI>Great</HI> Poets and Paint∣ers; and, now, to end with the Business with
which I began, If he whom you pro∣pose to draw my Picture, is not a
<HI>Master,</HI> I shall be unwilling to give him any Trou∣ble. If he is a
<HI>Master,</HI> he is <HI>Rich,</HI> as cer∣certainly as I am <HI>not
so:</HI> I therefore expect, That he shall do it <HI>intirely gratis</HI>;
For as <HI>Painter,</HI> and <HI>Poet,</HI> we are <HI>Sisters Children,</HI>
and he is worse than a <HI>Jew,</HI> who, being <HI>Rich himself, will take
Money of a Poor Re∣lation.</HI></P>

<DIV1 TYPE="genealogy">
<P><HI>SATURN,</HI> the Son of COELUM, after having made a
Separation of Body and Goods with his Wife CYBELE, married NECESSITY the
Daughter of DESTINY and FORTUNE.</P>
<P>Old Father DESTINY gave this poor Girl of his, her
Education among the <HI>MUSES,</HI> and trained her up in the Company of
<HI>Poets</HI> <PB N="29" REF="30"/> and <HI>Philosophers.</HI> She was
blessed, from a very Child, with a strong, and enterprizing Genius, quick
and ready at Invention, fruit∣ful of mighty Projects, and ever intent upon
proper Ways and Means, to give a finishing Stroke to her Undertakings. But
though she was ingenious, she was homely in her Person; she, poor
Thing! had none of those Charms to boast of, which might draw the Eyes of
Lovers upon her; her <HI>Mien</HI> carried with it as little Temptation as her
<HI>Face</HI>; and her Fortune was <HI>low,</HI> and still <HI>less
inviting</HI> than <HI>either</HI>; so that she was no Body's Taste, and
not any Individual breatheing had the least Thought of her for a
<HI>Wife.</HI> The <HI>MUSES</HI> found the Charge grow heavy upon Them, and,
sensible of their Inability to go through with the Expence of keeping her
much longer, the begg'd DESTINY, by all means, to take her out of their Hands,
and think of making proper Provision for her in some other Way. This put
DESTINY on trying to bring about a Match, between his Daughter, and his old
Friend SATURN, whom he persuaded, that since he was so far gone in Years,
and parted from his Wife, without any Appearance of their coming together
again; it was not pos∣sible for him to do better, than marry some
honest careful Body, who would be tender in looking after him: And then he
took Occa∣sion to name his own Daughter, as a Person well qualified for
that Office; assuring the old Gentleman, at the same Time, of her
Incli∣nations <PB N="30" REF="31"/> to do every Thing, that would be most
pleasing in his Eyes.</P>
<P>THE Truth is, NECESSITY was a good toward Girl, and
followed her Father's Coun∣sel, so well, and behaved herself with so
much Docility, Humility, and Diligence, that she intirely won the old Man's
Heart. That which prevailed with him, most of all, to come to this
Resolution, arose from this Con∣sideration, That all the Uneasiness
between him and CYBELE, was occasioned by her <HI>too great</HI> Riches,
which made her presumptuous enough to slight and despise him, and use
him so ill, as to carry on a secret Affair with PLUTO, a Commerce, the
most displeasing in Nature to him, and which he could never forgive.
Hence he became perswaded, it would be doing very wisely, to marry a Wo∣man
of Birth, who having nothing of her own, would think of no other Enjoyments,
but those which she shared in common with him, which he knew to be
sufficient to ren∣der her eternally happy.</P>
<P>PRELIMINARIES were all settled, the Treaty concluded,
and the Marriage con∣summated, between old SATURN, and his poor Spouse
NECESSITY, whose whole Portion consisted in her <HI>Vigilance,</HI> her
<HI>Obedi∣ence,</HI> and <HI>Humility.</HI></P>
<P>THE only <HI>Issue</HI> of this Marriage was VIR∣TUE,
who from her Cradle, gave Promises of her Beauty. As soon as she grew up,
the mature Virgin drew gazing Crowds after her, <PB N="31" REF="32"/> and the
Eyes of the admiring World was fix'd upon this Object. There was not that
single God in <HI>Olympus,</HI> but was fond of her Acquaintance: However, as
she happened to be of a high and over-ruling Temper, and would take the
Liberty of telling People their Faults very plainly to their Faces; she was
not over-welcome to many, where she went.</P>
<P>THEN, again, her Mother NECESSITY, whose Company she
was seldom out of, was, by Nature, bashful, and little used to fre∣quent
the Palaces of the <HI>Great.</HI> She went always very <HI>plainly</HI> and
<HI>simply</HI> cloathed, after the <HI>old Fashion,</HI> which made her
not a little timorous of visiting the <HI>modish</HI> Gods of
<HI>Quality.</HI></P>
<P>THIS manner of Life becoming trouble∣some to them, they
went often to pay their Respects to the <HI>MUSES,</HI> and to see the
<HI>Poets</HI> and <HI>Philosophers,</HI> their old Friends, with whom they
always found a more friendly and grateful Reception. This made them think of
returning to the <HI>MUSES,</HI> and there to live for ever: And this NECESSITY
got her Husband to consent to, who approved of this Retreat the more
willingly, because he very justly judged, that the good Qualities of his
Daughter VIRTUE, might help a great deal, in that Place, towards correcting the
Vices and reforming the Errors of Man∣kind.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY they returned to <HI>Parnas∣sus,</HI> and
the <HI>MUSES</HI> obliged them with <PB N="32" REF="33"/> fine Apartments,
where VIRTUE made herself known more and more, and was ad∣mired by every Eye
that could get a Sight of her. The <HI>MUSES</HI> did all they could, to exalt
the Merit of their new Tenant; they left nothing unsaid, that might inlarge
her Reputation; they had a mighty Mind to captivate some suitable Person,
and engage his Affections to her: But all in vain; there was not one Ear
<HI>rightly</HI> open to these repea∣ted Praises and Admonitions. Whole
Crowds indeed would throng, to gaze at her, every Spectator Admired her, and
even every Hearer, when she spoke, was forc'd to allow, That she had
Reason for the Reprimands she made; but not one of them would have any
Con∣cern with her, or join themselves for ever with a Person, whose
Manner of Living was so extraordinary and uncommon.</P>
<P>THUS she remained a long Time unpro∣vided for, 'till a
venerable Sort of Gentleman, oldish, but not very far in Years, who had the
Reputation of great Capacity, Observa∣tion and Experience, and whose Name
was WISDOM, happen'd to light upon her. To him this <HI>tart</HI> Humour of
hers, which was always as <HI>just</HI> as it was <HI>severe,</HI> was not
at all distasteful: On the contrary, he liked her for it; he made his Court
to her, and having addres∣sed her Father and Mother for their Consent,
and obtained it, married her, to the univer∣sal Joy of
<HI>Parnassus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34"/>THIS excellent Couple had Issue,
but One Child, named LABOUR, who, in his Infancy, gave them Trouble enough, in
all Conscience, to rear him. As soon as he approached the Age of Manhood,
he gave the most apparent Signs of a <HI>working</HI> Head, and appeared
never <HI>easy,</HI> but when in <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P>ONE Day, above the rest, having closely employed
himself upon an Undertaking of great Moment, a Task which his Mother VIRTUE
had been pleased to set him; he saw RECOMPENCE, the Daughter of MERIT and
of REASON, and became passionately in Love with her. Her <HI>Youth</HI> was
blooming, her <HI>Beauty</HI> exquisitely charming; her Humour powerfully
bewitching; her <HI>whole Person</HI> irre∣sistably ravishing: All
she <HI>look'd,</HI> or <HI>said,</HI> or <HI>did,</HI> was so engaging,
that it was <HI>natural</HI> in her to <HI>please,</HI> and there was no-body
but loved her, no-body but longed to possess her.</P>
<P>LABOUR, who was nearly touched with so many agreeable
Qualities, resolved with himself to do every thing that should be
re∣quisite to gain her; and, as she did not want Lovers, he judged he
should meet with many Difficulties before he could attain his desired End:
But having received some joyful Assu∣rance, that the Figure he made in
the World, did not displease her, he resolved to omit nothing, that might
make him still more grateful in the Eye of his Mistress. After infinite
Pains, innumerable Hopes and Dis∣appointments, the Treaty was at length
con∣cluded <PB N="34" REF="35"/> with MERIT and REASON, the Pa∣rents of
RECOMPENCE, who gave their Con∣sent with great Alacrity; and the more, for
that VIRTUE herself did very heartily inte∣rest herself in that Affair.
Nay, farthermore, Advices came to the Parents of RECOMPENCE, that the Marriage
was APPROVED and DESIRED by COELUM, the Great-Grandfather to LABOUR.</P>
<P>IN Effect, LABOUR and RECOMPENCE were so exactly
matched, that one may say, they were born <HI>one</HI> for the
<HI>other</HI>; their Mar∣riage was perfectly happy, by the good
Un∣derstanding in which they lived; For LABOUR continuing towards his Wife
the same Affe∣ction, desired to be everlastingly in her Com∣pany; he
could not bear her a Moment out of his Sight, by his good Will; and would
scarce be persuaded, at Times, that he had seen her, when he really had.
His Wife was no less fond, on her Side; she observed a Conduct so
regular, and so judicious, that she never gave him Reason of Complaint,
and would favour no-body with her <HI>Presence,</HI> where her Husband was
<HI>absent.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Marriage was render'd still more prosperous by
its Fruitfulness. For, they had Issue Three Children, Two Girls, and a
Boy. The Boy, who was the Youngest, was called REST: He was <HI>well
made</HI> in his <HI>Person, agreeable, insinuating, welcome</HI>
where∣ever he went: His noble Birth, and engaging Qualities, made him regarded
and coveted <PB N="35" REF="36"/> by <HI>all</HI> the World, and chiefly by the
<HI>Rich.</HI> He was not of so high a Spirit as his Sisters: He visited
none but Persons that were peace∣ful, and little enterprizing. His
<HI>Father</HI> was angry at it, and did all he could to render him <HI>more
active,</HI> but he fled out of his Sight, because continual solliciting
him to do some∣thing, disturbed his <HI>Quiet,</HI> and interrupted his
Beloved <HI>Repose.</HI></P>
<P>THESE repeated Sollicitations grew, at last, so
insupportable to REST, that, his Humour being no longer able to bear that of
his <HI>Father,</HI> which was so <HI>opposite,</HI> he harbou∣red Malice
against him, and joining in an Association with IDLENESS, with whom he
had contracted a <HI>strict Friendship,</HI> they plot∣ted together to take
away the Life of the Parent of REST. But honest Father LABOUR, being
vigilant, was not long without disco∣vering this Conspiracy, of which being
but too certain, he drove this <HI>unnatural Son</HI> from him, nor would ever
see him more: REST, touch'd with <HI>Repentance,</HI> or pushed by
<HI>some other</HI> Motive, retired to the <HI>Service of the Gods,</HI>
where he has, ever since, taken up his Residence.</P>
<P>THE Two Daughters of LABOUR, were GLORY and PLEASURE, both
of them fine Persons, intirely like their Mother, so very like her, that
they were often taken for her, which made her extreamly fond of them. LABOUR
loved them dearly too, as well on Account of their Merit, as for that <HI>near
Re∣semblance</HI> <PB N="36" REF="37"/> of Features which made him re∣member,
when his Heart was first smitten with Love.</P>
<P>THE Children, on their Side, dutifully answered this
Affection, and hardly ever quitted their <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother,</HI>
where-ever they went, whether to <HI>private People,</HI> or <HI>Princes,</HI>
where they <HI>most</HI> delighted to make their Abode, and where they were
<HI>very wel∣come,</HI> being significant Persons in <HI>War</HI> and
<HI>Peace,</HI> and shining as well in the <HI>Cabinet,</HI> as the
<HI>Field.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, that PLEASURE, was not so lofty and proud of
Heart, as GLORY, her Sister: For whereas GLORY thought of no∣thing but
<HI>great</HI> Things, and would frequent none but People of great Genius,
despising all other Considerations; PLEASURE, on the contrary, could
amuse herself with any thing, loving as well Business of <HI>little
Account,</HI> as that of <HI>Importance</HI>; the People of a <HI>midling,</HI>
as well as of the <HI>sublimest</HI> Genius; <HI>low,</HI> as well as
<HI>high</HI> Life, caressing all alike; which won her the Hearts of all
the World: As she was, by Nature, very <HI>curious,</HI> she diver∣ted
herself with making little particular Jour∣nies to People, who were glad to
have her in their Company, provided she was not with her <HI>Father</HI> and
her <HI>Sister,</HI> the <HI>Austerity</HI> of whom, put them under too
great a Restraint.</P>
<P>THESE little Sallies gave a <HI>Stain</HI> to her
Reputation, it not being possible to see so fine a Girl familiarly
visit so many People, <PB N="37" REF="38"/> without speaking of it. But
what had like to have ruined her intirely, was, that at the same Time a
<HI>debauch'd Girl,</HI> who had some∣thing of the <HI>Air</HI> of PLEASURE,
but much <HI>Affectation,</HI> took it in her Head to go by the <HI>same</HI>
Name, in order to find the <HI>easier Access</HI> in all Places. She was
the Daughter of LEISURE and DEBAUCH, despicable People! and, as she had
neither <HI>Birth</HI> nor <HI>Honour,</HI> she mingled indifferently with
<HI>all Sorts</HI> of Persons, leading an infamous Life, and so
disorderly, that she passed for one lost.</P>
<P>THIS Identity of Names, made them attribute to the
<HI>true</HI> PLEASURE, all the Disorders of the <HI>false,</HI> which
obliged her to clear up the Matter with her Father LABOUR, who was deceived,
like the rest of the World, by this Appearance. But above all Things, her
<HI>conscious Innocence,</HI> which they accused her to have violated, gave
her great Confidence in her own Justification. She made known to her
<HI>Father,</HI> that the greatest Part of those she frequented, were the
best Friends of <HI>Him,</HI> and his Ancestors, VIRTUE and WISDOM; That
she was cherished by a <HI>whole Sect</HI> of <HI>Philosophers</HI>; and,
in short, That she saw <HI>none</HI> but People, whose <HI>Manners</HI>
were <HI>Praise-worthy.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>October 12, 1724.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING the Charge of two young La∣dies of Fortune lately
devolved upon me; I cannot but think it needful to call in the
Assist∣stance of the <HI>PLAIN DEALER</HI> to en∣able me to perform
this important Task, with that Justice and Prudence, which I am con∣vinc'd it
requires.</P>
<P>I therefore beg you will give me some Rules for Education;
and, that they may the better Adapted to my present Necessity, I must
tell you, as concisely as I can, the different Dispositions I have to
deal with.</P>
<P>THE eldest is about Fifteen, very Bookish, but her chief
Study has hitherto been in Roman∣ces, and Novels. I think it not proper to
dis∣courage this Taste of Reading in her, but would rather lead her,
insensibly, into the Perusal of Books really Useful; which to such a
One, ought to be entertaining too. What they must be, I submit to your
Judgment, who, I hope, will Recommend some Authors that may be safely put
into their Hands.</P>
<P>MY younger Charge, not quite Fourteen, is so far from reading
Romances, that I can fix her to nothing; She promises fair to be the very 
<PB N="40" REF="41"/> Counter-part of your <HI>Patty Amble;</HI> And I believe
has been a <HI>Coquette</HI> from her Cradle; She is good-natur'd, but giddy,
and I fear it will be a difficult Matter to make her a reason∣able Woman,
tho' She certainly has good Sense.</P>
<P>THIS will be no Paradox, when we consi∣der how many People
loose the Benefit of a fine Understanding, for want of fixing it upon a
pro∣per Basis.</P>
<P>YOUR Thoughts upon this <HI>SUBJECT</HI> will be a Publick
Benefit, and a Particular Fa∣vour to</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your constant Reader, and humble Servant,
ASPASIA.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>IT is Nobly and Generously observed by an Excellent Poet of
the present Age, that, To <HI>do one good Actio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> is preferable to the <HI>writing,</HI> however
sublimely, the most <HI>Glori∣ous Deeds of others.</HI> But methinks, on
the other hand, it gives an unspeakable Pleasure to deliver in
<HI>writing,</HI> what may give occasion to <HI>good Actions.</HI> The
honest Inclination of <HI>Aspasia,</HI> and her earnest Desire, That
I would give her a Word of Advice, concur to raise in me this Expectation,
and therefore, while I shall lay down some cursory Observations, which
may be of Service to young People, I am not asham'd to own, That the little
Entertainment, which I offer to that Class of my Readers, is a kind of
Feast to my Self.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42"/><HI>ASPASIA</HI> very well knows, the first
and most important Point, which consists in studying their Tempers, and
the Bent of their Inclinations. The Knowledge once ob∣tained, the next Step is,
to improve and heighten their good Qualities, and <HI>artificially</HI> to
transform the Defects and Errors of their Nature, into Graces and Ornaments. As
we must <HI>naturally</HI> Love those, whom we desire to instruct; and,
as it is <HI>natural</HI> not to love those, who obtrude Instruction upon
us, but to listen with Attention to those whom we Love, and to gather
Instruction from them, as it were <HI>without their Knowledge</HI>; It is,
for these Reasons, methinks Necessary, that the Method, generally
observed in these Cases, should be Reversed; that is to say, The
<HI>In∣struction</HI> of the Child should be the <HI>Conse∣quence</HI> of
a Tutress's <HI>Love</HI> towards it, and not her <HI>Love</HI> be the
<HI>Consequence</HI> of its <HI>taking</HI> her <HI>Instructions</HI>:
These Directresses of Youth should <HI>begin,</HI> where they generally
<HI>end.</HI> They give their <HI>Advices plainly</HI> and <HI>bluntly,</HI>
and as those happen to take Root direct their <HI>Affe∣ctions</HI> or
<HI>Resentments:</HI> But they should, <HI>first,</HI> Practice upon the
<HI>Affections</HI> of their <HI>Wards,</HI> gain their Hearts, and make their
own <HI>Love seen,</HI> and <HI>afterwards</HI> steal their Admonitions
into them, under the Covert of Art, keeping them as much as possible,
<HI>unseen.</HI> Instruction thus Politically couched, will have a Power,
that is Irresistable, and make an amazing Progress in tender Minds.
Advice, not seen <HI>by,</HI> will be sure to be seen, <HI>in</HI>
them.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="43"/>TO descend to Particulars, in our present
Case: Looking over those Romances and Novels, which her eldest
<HI>Ward</HI> delights in, too much, <HI>Aspasia</HI> will certainly find
some Heroick Examples of Vertue. These she would relate to some Friend,
in the Secret, with very great Applauses, so as to be Over∣heard by her
fair Pupil, who will be prejudi∣ced for a Judgment, that seems to favour her
own, and that she would be glad should do so. She will be charmed to hear
this, and remaining, as it were, <HI>perdue,</HI> listen greedily to it, as
the Commendation of her self. When her Mind is thus strongly prejudiced in
Be∣half of her Guardian, when it is warmed, and just ready to take the
Impression; then, just then, the Guardian has an Opportunity of
pressing down the Seal of Vertue. A lit∣tle proper Female Oratory, in
Commendati∣on of the like Passages, still more beautifully expressed,
in such Books, as she would have her read, will make her long, and beg, of
her own accord, to see them. As for Exam∣ple; <HI>Aspasia</HI> might
say: Such a noble Qua∣lity is eminently conspicuous in the Hero of this
Romance; but then he appears defective in such other Points: The Hero of
such a Novel Revere for such a Part of his Con∣duct, but he is greatly to
blame in other Re∣spects: The principal Character in such a Book of
Memoirs, would be a Favourite, and a shining Character, but for such and
such Blemishes and Imperfections. Such a Gal∣lant, <PB N="43" REF="44"/> in
such a Play, behaves himself well throughout the whole Action, and makes me
love him at my very Heart; but such a Gal∣lant has a villainous Design at
Bottom, up∣on his Mistress's Honour, and is my mortal Aversion. After
having thus remark'd up∣on Texts, out of the Lady's own Scripture, it is
Inexpressible, what an Effect it might have, if growing into a sudden
Rapture, <HI>Aspasia</HI> should go on as follows: How does it charm and
transport one, to find all these Vertues, and none of the opposite Vices;
all these Beauties without Deformities, united in that one Favourite
Character of mine, the <HI>Chri∣stian Hero,</HI> described with all the
Force, with which Vertue can be described, and painted with all the Beauties
with which Beauty can be painted?—This Method, or such a Me∣thod as
this, would prompt the listening, <HI>bookish</HI> Ward to a Desire of
seeing that Tract; she would long for it, she would enquire af∣ter it,
she would beg to read it; she would set to reading it already prejudiced
in its Fa∣vour; It would gain upon her, in the Read∣ing, till she gained,
what her Guardian would wish, from reading it. As she has true Taste,
this just Picture, would beget in her a Con∣tempt of those coarse
Daubings of a Nove∣list's grosser Hand. The same may be said of the
<HI>Heroines,</HI> celebrated in her favourite Romances. How much more
charmingly is the <HI>fine Lady,</HI> described in the Marquess of
<HI>Hallifax</HI> his Advice to a Daughter, and so of <PB N="44" REF="45"/>
others.—What Fruit may not be hoped and expected:—Reading that
little Book, called, <HI>The Advice to a Daughter,</HI> and the <HI>Lady's
Li∣brary,</HI> is enough to make young Women learn to <HI>Know
themselves:</HI> STEELE<HI>'s Christian Heroe,</HI> and the <HI>Gentleman
Instructed,</HI> teach them abundantly to know Men. A <HI>Know∣ledge</HI> of
<HI>themselves,</HI> will be the <HI>Preservative</HI> of their
<HI>Honour</HI>; and a <HI>true Knowledge</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> will fortifie
them against the <HI>Treacheries,</HI> that are used by <HI>artful</HI>
Deceivers, of <HI>that Sex,</HI> which is almost sure, one Time or other,
to be either <HI>their RUIN,</HI> or <HI>their ORNA∣MENT.</HI></P>

<P>I INTENDED in this PAPER, to have proceeded upon some Hints
concerning EDUCATION: But I am forced to break off the Thread, and defer it to
another Day. I have many entertaining <HI>LETTERS</HI> by me, from
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and <HI>Bath</HI>; and two, that I must particularly

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> IN One of your PAPERS concerning DETRACTION, you justly
observed, That Persons guilty of it, in a great <HI>City,</HI> ought to
have some <HI>Distinguishing Signs</HI> to discover them, as
Crosses are placed on the Doors of the <HI>Diseased,</HI> in the Time
of a Pestilence.</P>
<P> THAT happy Way of Reasoning (in∣seperable from Truth) which
shines in all your Writings, on whatsoever <HI>Subject</HI> em∣ployed,
carries Conviction in every Line, that gives the <HI>Good Man</HI> Pleasure,
and the <HI>Envious</HI> and <HI>Detracting,</HI> Pain.</P>
<P> THEN to whom shall I apply for Re∣dress, but to the PLAIN
DEALER, who, tho' above flattering the Great, thinks it not unworthy him, to do
Justice, even to the <HI>Lowest</HI> Degree of Merit.</P>
<P> WAS I to draw the Man I mean, in the Character of <HI>Husband,
Father,</HI> or <HI>Friend,</HI> in each, he would please and satisfy; but
as those distinguishing Characters, are Private, tho' Undisputed, I
will beg leave to tell you, He has, in <HI>Active</HI> Life, a <HI>Fame,</HI>
that <PB N="47" REF="48"/> gives Uneasiness to some malignant People,
while it does Good, more widely than they wou'd wish him able to extend
it.</P>
<P> IF an indefatigable Industry, with his allowed
<HI>Skill,</HI> and <HI>Humanity,</HI> crowned by the Blessing of the
<HI>ALMIGHTY,</HI> with un-interrupted Success, can recommend a Man to
Esteem in the useful Profession of of <HI>Surgery,</HI> you will allow
me to name Mr. <HI>Coltheart.</HI> Methinks I see him, (as I have often
seen him) going to the Relief of some miserable Object, with his usual
Chearfulness and Smiles (with that Regard however to the Cause, which the
Greatest could wish for, the Unhappy seldom find) as if he was going to
some Great Man, whose Cure must make his Fortune; tho' he is certain to
have no other Recompence than the Thanks and Prayers of his un∣friended
Patient.</P>
<P> INNUMERABLE Instances of this Kind the Grateful Many he has
served, wou'd give, who, tho' willing, are not allow'd to do him the
Justice he deserves; which in∣duces me to believe, if ever Man took
Pleasure in doing Good, he does; as also to think him a proper Subject, and
Excuse, for my troubling you with this, who am,</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49"/>WHEN I reflect upon the many Advan∣tages
arising to Mankind, from the Skill of a True Professor of the Surgeon's
Art, he ap∣pears so Useful a Member of the Common-Wealth, that he makes no
<HI>inconsiderable</HI> Fi∣gure among the most <HI>considerable,</HI>
like <HI>Ma∣chaon</HI> among the Heroes in <HI>Homer.</HI> The Per∣son, this
Letter relates to, far from meriting to be spoken ill of, deserves that
respect, which the best of all Books requires to be paid to the
Physician, if it was for nothing else, but having, not long since,
preserved the Life of a Member, of a very noble Fa∣mily, in which
<HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Eloquence</HI> have been a long Time
<HI>Hereditary.</HI></P>
<P>AS I am brought once more, unwill∣ingly, to touch upon that hated
Subject, <HI>DETRACTION,</HI> I think I cannot do better, in order to deter
People, from it, than to place before their Eyes a Picture of its Defor∣mity,
as it was drawn by that Great Master <HI>APELLES,</HI> and Described by an
excellent old Author.</P>
<Q> 
<P> AT the Right-Hand, was drawn Sit∣ting, a Man, with long Ears,
put∣ting forth his Hand to <HI>DETRACTION,</HI> who seem'd from afar off to
come towards him. About this Man stood two Women, that is to say,
<HI>IGNORANCE</HI> and <HI>SUSPICION:</HI> On the other side came
<HI>DETRACTION,</HI> a Woman dress'd in great Pomp and Magnificence, but in a
<PB N="49" REF="50"/> mighty Passion of Anger, having her As∣pect like
Fire. In her Left-Hand, she held a burning Torch, and with her other, she
drew, by the Hair of his Head, a young Man, who held up his Hands to∣wards
Heaven, calling God, to Witness his Innocence: With Her, came a Woman, Pale
and Evil-favoured, beholding the the young Man attentively, like one that had
been consumed with long Sickness, whom you might easily conjecture to be
<HI>ENVY.</HI></P> 
<P> THERE followed two other Women, who made it their Business to
adorn <HI>DETRACTION:</HI> One was <HI>TREASON,</HI> the other <HI>FRAUD:</HI>
After, followed a Woman in Mourning, Black and Ragged, called
<HI>REPENTANCE,</HI> who turning her Back, and sore ashamed, beheld
<HI>TRUTH,</HI> who then came forward.</P></Q>
<P>IT is thus, <HI>APELLES</HI> described <HI>DE∣TRACTION,</HI> by
which he himself was brought into extream Danger, having been falsely
accused to King <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who, upon his refuting
the Accusation, or∣dered him as many Talents, as would amount to Twelve
Thousand Pounds Sterling, and that his Accuser should be his perpetual
Bonds-man.</P>
<P>IF some curious Engraver would form a Plate, upon this Model;
the best Method would be for Persons this way Injured, to 
<PB N="50" REF="51"/> purchase a Ptint, and fix it, like a Play-Bill, at the
Door of any noted Offender; after which, it should be a Rule for the
Neigh∣bourhood, never to believe a Report that came from that Quarter, whether
in <HI>Praise</HI> or <HI>Dispraise</HI> of any Body.</P>
<P>BY this Means, the <HI>TONGUES</HI> of <HI>Evil-Speakers,</HI> and
the <HI>PENS</HI> of <HI>Evil-Writers,</HI> would become <HI>Useless,</HI>
and <HI>Unregarded</HI>; and Innocence, having nothing to fear, might look,
untrembling, upon Slander.</P>

<HI>Palmestry</HI>: But <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>She,</HI> being intimate
Acquaintance, Her own Name for it, is <HI>Chiromancy.</HI>—If
<HI>Lon∣gitude</HI> lay in her Palm, she cou'd not fail to
<HI>discover</HI> it; and be <HI>paid for her peeping.</HI>—My
Brothers, of the Bench, you know, are not without some Wit their Way; and 
<PB N="54" REF="55"/> most of them can <HI>crack a Joke,</HI> when we meet,
over a Bottle.—I venture now and then, to <HI>push a Pun,</HI> upon
these Occasions: And they All know, as well as I do, That I have no
<HI>close-fisted</HI> Wife, tho' she <HI>makes a good Hand of
me.</HI></P>
<P> I ALLOW her a <HI>Study,</HI> to herself, at the End of a
long Gallery; where when I walk, and take my Pipe, I am sure, If I but peep
thro' the Key-hole, to see her Thumbs as high as her Eyes; and half a Score
reve∣rend Philosophers, who Treat on this Deep Mystery, lying spread, on
a Table, before her.—She has <HI>Fortune,</HI> at her Fingers Ends! and
never <HI>Sybil</HI> prophesied, with such unwearied Application.</P>
<P> IT gives me no small Delight, to observe how busie she
will be, in looking over my <HI>Line of Life:</HI> And really sometimes she
<HI>hits</HI> Things strangely! One wou'd almost be∣lieve, she has
<HI>more Help than she shou'd have!</HI>—My <HI>CEPHALICA,</HI>
(which, you are to know, is my <HI>Head Line</HI>) has, it seems, a
<HI>Forkey Figure,</HI> in the midst of it, that points, with both Horns,
against my <HI>Linea Vitalis.</HI>—I don't know why it is, but she
always <HI>laughs,</HI> when she sees this Mark; and says, She is sure
<HI>some Good</HI> will come of it, because the But-end of the Fork points
from the <HI>Dragon's Tail,</HI> to the <HI>Mount</HI> of <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P> THO' I believe her at my Heart, yet I pretend to make a Doubt
of it; because <PB N="55" REF="56"/> there can be no <HI>prettier
Diversion,</HI> than to see how she <HI>frets,</HI> and what a deal of
good∣natur'd Pains she will take, to convince me of it!—I must own, I
stand amaz'd at the Improvement of her Natural Parts, by the Benefit of
frequent Practice, upon Secrets, I am utterly a Stranger to!</P>
<P> WE have a New Minister in our Parish, and, the first Time
he came to dine, at our House, I shall never forget how he star'd, when
<HI>SNUBSY</HI> began to shew her Learn∣ing!—She no sooner looked in
his Hand, than she told him, He would be made a <HI>Bishop.</HI> He is
counted a Man of <HI>Letters,</HI> and yet he was not able to
<HI>disprove</HI> it; tho' he own'd, indeed, <HI>It was unlikely:</HI> For,
she reduced it to a Demonstration, little less than
<HI>Mathematical</HI>; by <HI>Squares, Trines, Cir∣cles, Stars, Spots, Tokens,
Signs, Lines,</HI> and <HI>Figures,</HI> of a thousand different Sorts,
<HI>Di∣rect, Transverse,</HI> and <HI>Parallel:</HI> Pursuing every
Argument, with an invincible Force of Reasoning, through the <HI>Cavea
Martis,</HI> to the <HI>Via Solis</HI>; and unravelling all the
<HI>Crosses,</HI> in the <HI>Tuberculum,</HI> on the <HI>Mons
Sa∣turni;</HI> 'till she came within reach of the <HI>Via Lactea,</HI> under
the <HI>Girdle</HI> of <HI>Venus:</HI> And there the <HI>Doctor</HI> stopt
her, and made Ac∣knowledgements of his Satisfaction.</P>
<P> WE went lately to shew <HI>Bedlam,</HI> to a
Country-Cousin, who came up to visit us: And, in the middle of the long
Room, my <HI>SNUBSY</HI> took a Fancy, to let her Kins∣woman 
<PB N="56" REF="57"/> woman see how fine a Skill she was Mistress of: In
order to which, she fell to reading us a <HI>Lecture,</HI> over the Palm of a
silent <HI>Lunatic</HI>; who, with a Rugg about his Shoulders, ve∣ry quietly
gave her his Hand, through the <HI>Grate</HI> he was standing at—She
had just pointed out, How his <HI>Mons Mercurii</HI> be∣came afflicted, by an
Evil-line, from his <HI>Mons Lunae,</HI> when the Patient besprinkled her
Face, with a Bowl-full of a certain Ill-scented Liquor, of his own making,
which his other Hand had concealed behind him. We were, all, in good Measure,
made Par∣takers of his Bounty. But my Cousin, and I, were beginning to quit
some Part of it, which we thought we should have no Use for, when we were
interrupted by our dripping <HI>Chiromancer,</HI> who ran between us, all in
Transport, holding her Hands as high as our Eyes, and crying out, with great
Ve∣hemence, That <HI>Her Fears were now over</HI>;—For she had
foreseen, by a <HI>Combust-Line,</HI> between her <HI>Pollex</HI> and her
<HI>Cardiac,</HI> That she should be in Danger of a Violent Death, either
by <HI>Drowning</HI> or <HI>Suffocation!</HI></P>
<P> IT is not in my Power to explain to you All the Benefits, which
I receive from this Profoundness of my Spouse's
<HI>Foresight.</HI>—Other People, when they take <HI>New Servants,</HI>
are forc'd to send, and enquire their <HI>Cha∣racter:</HI> But my little
Conjurer, does but peep upon their Palms, and satisfies her self
immediately.—I had a very strong Parti∣ality <PB N="57" REF="58"/> for a
smiling Country, Girl, that came, last Week, to offer her Service, in the
Qua∣lity of a <HI>Chamber-Maid.</HI> But upon the very first Inspection, my
Examiner charg'd her Home, With <HI>Three Favourite Sweethearts</HI>; and then
whispered something in her Ear, which she staid not to return an
Answer to; but ran, blushing, out of Doors, in the ut∣most Hurry and
Disorder. And this <HI>Disco∣very,</HI> my <HI>Cassandra</HI>
assured me, was ground∣ed meerly upon <HI>Palmistry</HI>; the Girl having
a manifest <HI>Triangle,</HI> on the Bottom of the <HI>Mount</HI> of
<HI>Venus,</HI> which extended so far downward, as to make a <HI>Cleft</HI>
in her <HI>Re∣stricta.</HI></P>
<P> I WAS, once, in some kind of Danger to have been drawn into a
<HI>Plot</HI>; but my <HI>SNUBSY</HI> found it out, in the Palm of my Hand; and
in Presence of a <HI>Minister of State,</HI> who, I can assure You,
made no small Use of Her, convinc'd me, beyond Dispute, that I should
bid fair for being <HI>hang'd,</HI> by Virtue of a <HI>crooked Line, that
cross'd my</HI> Via Combusta. This frighted me from my foolish Purpose:
But, I re∣member, I was strangely comforted, to dis∣cover, at the same
Time, upon the <HI>Mini∣ster's</HI> opening his Hand too, That his
Lord∣ship had a <HI>Combusta,</HI> as <HI>dangerously mark'd,</HI> as
mine was.</P>
<P> AFTER so happy a Deliverance, by In∣terposition of Her Art,
I grew desirous to be <HI>taught</HI> it; and with a great Deal of Good 
<PB N="58" REF="59"/> Success I got over the Heathen Names of her
<HI>Planets</HI>; and knew what Parts of her Hand they <HI>kept House</HI>
in. I was wonderfully pleased with <HI>VENUS,</HI> when I found, in my
<HI>Primmer of Palmestry,</HI> That she signi∣fied <HI>Woman-kind,
Kisses,</HI> and <HI>Ladies Curiosi∣ties:</HI> But I could never away
with <HI>MER∣CURY</HI>; For her <HI>Books</HI> were pleas'd to in∣form me, That
he held his Influence over <HI>Pages, Pimps,</HI> and <HI>Lawyers; Justices
of the Peace,</HI> and <HI>Astrologers.</HI> I thought it, from that Time
forward, unbecoming my Ho∣nour and Gravity, to apply my self to an Art, that
had treated my Office with such Indignity. And, as often as I cast my Eye
upon these Venerable Words, <HI>Justice of the Peace,</HI> and saw them
mix'd with such Ill Company, I clos'd my Fist in a Fury, and would study
<HI>Palmistry</HI> no longer.</P>
<P> YET, in the Way my <HI>SNUBSY</HI> pra∣ctices, Truth compells
me to confess, It is an inexhaustable Fund of Benefits, both to my Self,
and to the Publick.—If I happen to be sick, she consults
<HI>not</HI> my <HI>Pulse,</HI> but, my <HI>Palm.</HI> And, when Persons of
less Learning, feel Change of Weather, in their <HI>Toes,</HI> she reads
it, under her <HI>Fingers.</HI> In short, it is impossible for any Body,
but One, who knows as much of her as I do, to imagine what strange Sings and
Tokens, she carries about her; and what Great Things they signifie.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60"/> To such a powerful Pitch of Perfection
has she rais'd her surprizing Skill, that she saved a poor Man's Life,
lately, who was brought before me, by a Neighbour's Daughter, in Order to
charge him, upon Oath, With having done no less than <HI>ra∣vish'd</HI>
her: But <HI>SNUBSY,</HI> who was for beginning the Examination, in her own
Way, no sooner saw the Inside of their Hands, than she convinced the
Sufferer, very seasonably, That the Accident was <HI>un∣avoidable</HI>;
having been foretokened, by a plain <HI>Incisure,</HI> on the Center of her
<HI>Via La∣ctea:</HI> So that being <HI>decreed,</HI> from Both their Births,
this Misfortune became a <HI>Fate</HI>; and it would have been in vain to have
strug∣gled against it.—The poor Girl wept, and thanked her; and, with
charitable Change of Purpose, told the Prisoner, That <HI>she for∣gave
him heartily; for she thought it Hard, To have a Man hanged for doing
Nothing, but what he was</HI> born <HI>for.</HI></P>
<P> IN Justice to the Merit of a Wife, so deeply learn'd, I
could do less than desire you to acquaint the World with my
<HI>SNUBSY</HI>'s <HI>Character,</HI> when you come to lay open the
<HI>Genius</HI> of our <HI>English Ladies.</HI></P>

<DATE><HI>October</HI> 8, 1724.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> IN my Last, I laid before You a short Character of the
present Magistrates of this <HI>City</HI>; and some Account of the
Fac∣tious Spirit, that too often disturbs Them, and their Laudable
Undertakings. I am not at all surpriz'd to hear, That many of your
<HI>Readers,</HI> among my own <HI>Country∣men,</HI> have taken Offence at my
Free Cor∣respondence, notwithstanding the Sanction of <HI>your</HI>
Judgment, under which it is published.</P>
<P> PREJUDICE will always make the World Uneasie: Whatever
Cause it pro∣ceeds from, it never fails to govern the Understanding, in a
very shameful Man∣ner. And, tho' it is often no more than the imbib'd Sense
of a second Person, which a Man makes use of as his own, it 
<PB N="61" REF="62"/> is rarely, and with great Difficulty, re∣strain'd from
producing innumerable bad Consequences in Life, with the Face and Appearance
of something that is Good; it mixes it self with every Circumstance and
Action, and has every where a powerful Influence. One Man calls it
<HI>Religion,</HI> ano∣ther <HI>Principle</HI>; and he who dares be Blunt, owns
it by its plain Name of <HI>Party.</HI> What∣ever is done, or said, upon this
Founda∣tion, though never so Faulty, shall find <HI>Advocates</HI>; and,
however Praise-worthy, <HI>Condemnation.</HI> What a Shame is it to
Rea∣son, to hear it avow'd, That such a Sett of Men can do Nothing
<HI>Ill,</HI> because <HI>on our Side?</HI> And such another, Nothing
<HI>Well,</HI> because <HI>they Vote with our Enemies?</HI>—But Enough
of this Subject.—If, as 'tis ge∣nerally own'd, The Publick Good should
be the Point most in View, of each Indi∣vidual, I ought to rest
satisfied, and may despise the Spleen of my Censurers.</P>
<P> BUT, Sir, I am inclined to construe fa∣vourably, and,
perhaps, the Indignation that some People express against good
Per∣sons, and good Things, is not so much the Effect of <HI>Vice,</HI> as
of <HI>Ignorance.</HI> As when a <HI>Scheme</HI> is proposed for Publick
Benefit, <HI>Blockheads</HI> may innocently decry it, because they cannot
comprehend it. This I take to be the present Case, from the dull
Op∣position, that I have wonder'd to see made against several highly
generous and profi∣table <PB N="62" REF="63"/> Undertakings. Men, whose Souls
are short-sighted, love to walk in Old <HI>Ways,</HI> because they are in
no Danger of being <HI>lost,</HI> while they have a Hedge at each Elbow. Thus
the <HI>Hotentots</HI> adhere to their Hereditary Dirt and Nakedness: Thus
the <HI>Irish</HI> too, were formerly instiga∣ted to <HI>rebel against
the Yoke,</HI> in Defence of their ancient Privilege of <HI>drawing Ploughs by
their Horses Tails,</HI> with all the <HI>Wit</HI> of a <HI>free-born</HI>
Stedfastness. And, I am sorry I have Cause to say, That for a
Reason of this goodly Sort, my <HI>Neighbours</HI> love stink∣ing Streets,
and hate the Innovation of <HI>Necessary Houses.</HI></P>
<P> IF in this Part of the World, we chance to hear of a
<HI>Project to make us Cleanly,</HI> we wonder at the <HI>crack-brain'd
Whimsie,</HI> and guard our Hearts against <HI>Vanity.</HI> If it is
undertaken at the particular Expence of the Proposer, we discourage the
Guilt of so presuming a Generosity. Nay, let a Thing be actually
executed, and compleatly done to our Hands, we have still Spirit enough to
<HI>rail</HI> at it, with the most mascu∣line Inflexiblity. In this, and
other Re∣spects, I have Instances in my <HI>View</HI>; and my
<HI>Neighbours</HI> will take my <HI>Meaning,</HI> tho' not my
<HI>Counsel.</HI></P>
<P> IT were easie, SIR, to expatiate upon the <HI>Ignorance,</HI>
and <HI>Partiality,</HI> that prevail among our People, were I inclined to
write <HI>Satyr,</HI> and expose the Weakness of my <PB N="63" REF="64"/>
Country-men. But, as I am unwilling to spread their Defects, I beg Leave, on
the the other Side, to lay before you several more of the Blessings and
Ornaments our <HI>City</HI> boasts of!</P>
<P> YOU have done us the Honour, to di∣stinguish the Genius and
Virtue of some of the rising <HI>Generation,</HI> in one of your PAPERS;
and my last begins an Account of the FAIR ASSEMBLY here in
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which, not∣withstanding the Opposition of our
<HI>Clergy,</HI> is one of the best <HI>Nurseries</HI> of
<HI>Politeness</HI> in <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI> By Means thereof, our Youth of both
<HI>Sexes,</HI> learn a Habit of Briskness and Freedom, which, till of late,
were less frequent among us. That Re∣straint, and Stiffness of Air and
Address, which distinguished us from People of more generous Education,
by Decrees, wears away; and Conversation, which was formerly so confin'd,
and so dull, grows open, free, and easie: <HI>Ladies</HI> find they may
<HI>speak</HI> to <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> without Violence to their
<HI>Mo∣desty,</HI> and <HI>Gentlemen</HI> may <HI>entertain Ladies,</HI>
without Designs upon their <HI>Virtue.</HI> It is now no more a
<HI>Sight,</HI> when a Lover waits on his Mistress Home, or takes a Walk
with her in a Garden. Nay, we have Husbands, who, without Jealousie, can hear
Batche∣lours invite their Wives to an Entertain∣ment. In short, we exchange
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Affectation and Gravity, for the <HI>English</HI>
Liberty and Free Spirit; and, in Place of <PB N="64" REF="65"/> <HI>Narrow
Minds,</HI> and the <HI>vilest Hypocrisie,</HI> we are growing Profane
enough to assert the <HI>Dignity</HI> of <HI>Humane Reason,</HI> and the
<HI>Inno∣cent Privileges</HI> of <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P> PERHAPS I am not mistaken, when I affirm, That this
<HI>Conversion</HI> (I beg Leave of the <HI>Clergy</HI> to make Bold with the
Word, because I have as Good a Title to it, as they have) is, in a great
Measure, the Effect of the <HI>Union</HI> of the Two Kingdoms. But, when I
consider it is an Advantage, I wou'd not be thought to mean, that
<HI>either</HI> Nation is yet too Happy under the Effects of their
<HI>Incorporation.</HI> It may be allow'd us, I presume, to wish, that
however strictly they are united, they may never be bound so close, but
that one Hand may be loose enough to assist and unite the other, if it
is not quite <HI>impossible,</HI> there shou'd arise, in some future
Age, such a Miracle, as a <HI>Cor∣rupt Ministry</HI>; or a Prince, less
watchful, than our present Glorious SOVEREIGN, for the Defence of his Peoples
Liberties.</P>
<P> BUT I am no Politician; nor will I at∣tempt to Enlarge upon a
Subject that fits not the Purpose of your PAPER; though I promise my
self, That the PLAIN DEALER will not scruple, when Occasions rise, to
assert the <HI>Rights,</HI> as well as the <HI>Sense</HI> of a <HI>True
Briton.</HI></P>
<P> I PROCEED to Remark, That as the Correspondence and
Communication between the now United Kingdoms, has, in a great 
<PB N="65" REF="66"/> Measure, improv'd and polish'd the <HI>Taste,</HI>
the <HI>Air,</HI> and the <HI>Fashions,</HI> of both the Gentle∣men and
Ladies of my Country; so it has also refin'd our Language, in a very
sensible Manner. I do not mean the <HI>Accent</HI> and
<HI>Pronunciation,</HI> when we <HI>speak</HI> it—For these are
hardly to be naturaliz'd without much Time, and continual Converse; there
being, in <HI>England</HI> itself, a <HI>Shibboleth,</HI> peculiar to every
County. No wonder then, that <HI>Scots∣men</HI> find it difficult to come up to
their Standard.</P>
<P> BUT, if you'll allow, that we make some Progress in the
<HI>Substance</HI> of the Lan∣guage, we will readily give up our
Preten∣sions to the <HI>Graces</HI> of it. Yet our way of pronouncing the
<HI>Vowels</HI> has Advocates in <HI>Foreign</HI> Countries: And, perhaps, the
Autho∣rity might deserve a Review with the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P> I have wonder'd, to say Truth, that we are such Proficients
in the Language, con∣sidering we have neither a <HI>Court,</HI> nor a
<HI>Thea∣tre,</HI> which are the acknowledged <HI>Fountains</HI> of its
Refinement.</P>
<P> WHEN I look into the Writings of Mr. <HI>DRUMMOND</HI> of
<HI>Hathornden,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>JAMES</HI> I. Sir <HI>GEORGE
MACKENZIE,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>CHARLES</HI> II. The Earl of
<HI>LAU∣DERDALE,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>JAMES</HI> II. Bishop
<HI>BURNET,</HI> and Mr. <HI>FLETCHER</HI> of <HI>Salton,</HI> in the two
last Reigns; and of a certain noted Wri∣ter, <PB N="66" REF="67"/> in the
present; when I compare their Style with the Style of some of their
Co∣temporaries in <HI>England,</HI> I am tempted to think my Country-men not
so very far inferiour, as that <HI>Criticks</HI> shou'd depreciate our
Pretensions to the Language. But, when I consider too, That whatever
Ele∣gance, or Mastery, of that Sort we arrive at, is as much a
<HI>Virtue</HI> in us, as 'tis <HI>Nature</HI> in You, I am vain enough to
imagine, that we merit no less Praise; at least shou'd meet with fair
<HI>Indulgence.</HI></P>
<P> ONE Thing more I beg leave to Re∣mark, with Respect to our
Language. Many of our Words, that seem <HI>Uncouth,</HI> and are not
understood by <HI>English-men,</HI> are, notwithstanding, of
<HI>English</HI> Origin; and are not less <HI>Emphatical,</HI> and
<HI>Worthy,</HI> for being <HI>Obsolete</HI> among You. I find few old Words
in <HI>DOUGLAS</HI>'s <HI>VIRGIL,</HI> that are not also to be found in
<HI>CHAUCER:</HI> And, perhaps, our <HI>ALLAN RAM∣SAY,</HI> a living
<HI>Versifier</HI> in Old-Style, uses few that are not to be met with in
<HI>SHAKESPEAR, SPENCER,</HI> &amp;c.—except, when he coins Words, by
vir∣tue of his <HI>extra-judicial</HI> Poetick Privileges, that never were, and
never will be, used by any Mortal, besides <HI>Himself.</HI></P>
<P> LIVING Languages, are like living Trees; they have their Summer
and their Winter. The <HI>Words</HI> of the One, like the <HI>Leaves</HI> of
the Other, fall off, and are suc∣ceeded <PB N="67" REF="68"/> by a new
Generation. It is, how∣ever, Discretion's Work, in this Case, to Naturalize
none, at the Expence of better.</P>
<P> YOU see, Sir, with what Freedom I write my Sense both of
<HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Things</HI> to you. I own, I observe no Order in
the Form of my <HI>Letters:</HI> Nor do I believe <HI>That</HI> wou'd recommend
me more to your Regard. What I chiefly aim at, is, A na∣tural
<HI>Simplicity</HI> in my Expressions, and a <HI>Truth</HI> in my Facts,
becoming a Correspon∣dent of the <HI>PLAIN DEALER.</HI></P>
<P>'I HAVE the Honour to be with due Ve∣neration,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your trusty Intelligencer, and most Obedient Servant,
<HI>FERGUS BRUCE.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>AFTER having thank'd my Correspondent, for the Continuance of
his agreeable Intelli∣gence, I shall close with a short Remark on on what
he says, concerning our Language.</P>
<P>I AGREE with Him entirely, that many of of our old Words had the
same <HI>Original</HI> with theirs; for all that Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
to the the Southward of the <HI>Frith,</HI> was as much <HI>Saxon</HI> as we
were: So then the Foundation of our Language being the same, it is not so
reasonable, as I wish it were, to allow this ingenious Gentleman the Claim
he makes, in <PB N="68" REF="69"/> Behalf of his Country—That the Elegance
and Mastery, which are by <HI>Nature</HI> in Us, are a <HI>Virtue</HI> in
<HI>North Britain.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Nature</HI> is certainly alike to both Na∣tions: The
<HI>Virtue</HI> is most due, where the Im∣provement was <HI>first</HI>
made. The <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> have, at
least, for Ages past, been as learned as the <HI>English,</HI> and much
more accustom'd to foreign Travel and Corre∣spondence. These are the
great, and indeed the only Causes of Refinement in a Lan∣guage—For
<HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Luxury</HI> are much more likely to corrupt it, by the
Confusion they introduce, mixing Degrees and Distin∣ctions, and contracting
our Care to regard no∣thing so much as <HI>INTEREST.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE then the <HI>Scotch</HI> Language was once the very same
with the <HI>English</HI>; and since their People have been more intimately
Con∣versant, than ours, among Foreign Nations; and have always enjoy'd the
same Assistance of Learning, and yet have been behind us in the
Improvement of our common Tongue; it follows by Necessity, That the
Praise of <HI>Virtue</HI> is in ours—But it is a <HI>Birth-right,</HI>
which, like <HI>Kentish Gavel-Kind,</HI> we must equally divide with our
Brothers, in the next Generation: for, tho' they were slow Setters out, they
have prov'd Themselves as good Runners, and will be a-breast with us, in
the Race, and lose no Ground for the Future.</P>

<P>THE Complaint of <HI>AMANDA</HI> in the following LETTER, is of a

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> WHEN Parents have so much Zeal for their Childrens
<HI>Promotion,</HI> and so little for their <HI>Happiness,</HI> as to force
them to <HI>Marry</HI> the Person they have an <HI>Aversion</HI> to, How is
the World mov'd, with a Ten∣derness of Concern! And Nature shock'd with the
Violence!</P>
<P> SUCH a Constraint has always met with its just
Discouragement: And your <HI>Predeces∣sor in</HI> PLAIN DEALING took it
under his Care. But, Whether it is from the <HI>Pride</HI> of <HI>one Sex,</HI>
who are fond of the <HI>Reputation,</HI> even, of a Lover whom they
<HI>Hate</HI>! Or, from the un∣just <HI>Partiality,</HI> of the
<HI>Other,</HI> The much greater Offender, in my Opinion, passes
uncensured.—Such <HI>Parents</HI> are stigma∣tiz'd with
<HI>Inhumanity,</HI> and well they may! But what shall we say of
<HI>Him,</HI> who con∣tinues to <HI>teize</HI> the Woman, who <HI>abhors</HI>
him? who wou'd force her to make a <HI>Pro∣stitute</HI> of her <HI>Love?</HI>
To enslave herself to Interest? And, when her Refusal has drawn down
the Resentment of her Parents, lays it, all, on his <HI>Excess of
Love.</HI></P>
<P> IS Love then so <HI>base</HI> a Passion? So void of
Tenderness? So unlike itself, and all its generous Pretences? that it can
feed on the <HI>Quiet</HI> of the beloved Object! and <HI>steal from it</HI>
the Joy which it has not Power to <HI>give it!</HI> No, no, The real Lover
knows not how to <HI>Offend.</HI>—His Happiness <PB N="71" REF="72"/>
must rise, and fall, with <HI>Hers,</HI> who in∣spir'd his
Passion.—But if, on the contrary, His Desires run <HI>Counter</HI>
to her Happiness, It is not <HI>Love</HI>; It is <HI>Brutality!</HI> And, if
He, who is thus <HI>possess'd,</HI> supposes Himself in Love, He is
deceiv'd, and wou'd deceive Others.</P>
<P> BUT, even granting, All This were the real Effect of Love, on
the Part of the Pursuer, where can a <HI>Woman</HI> find That de∣delightful
Harmony, That inexhaustible Spring of Bliss, which we are taught to
ex∣pect, in <HI>Loving?</HI> Can the Constancy of an unlov'd Lover ever win
her to a Compli∣ance? No—rather <HI>Prepossession</HI> will guard
the Passes of her Heart, nor suffer it to be brib'd by Obligations; And
<HI>Time</HI> does but add to our Hatred: For Opportunity finds out Faults, and
furnishes <HI>Reasons</HI> for our Refusal.—In short, such a
Lover shows more <HI>Extravagance,</HI> than <HI>Constancy</HI>; more
<HI>Inhumanity,</HI> than <HI>Passion.</HI></P>
<P> THIS, Sir, is <HI>my own</HI> Misfortune, to be miserably
haunted, by the Man, whose Sight is Odious to me: One, whom no Words can
convince! No Denials satisfie! No affronts affect! Insensible of my
Un∣easiness; and Indefatigable, in creating it!—I wou'd fly him, but
I cannot, un∣less I wou'd fly my Friends too, and my Parents: Nor have I any
<HI>Intimate</HI> left, whom his Diligence, and Insinuations, have not made
his Own.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73"/> 'TIS of YOU, therefore, I must beg, to
say something, that may give me Ease, and have some Effect on my
troublesome Pursuer: And, if, in any Thing I have said, I am Mistaken,
in my Sentiments, or unguarded, in my Expressions, be pleas'd to Correct
it; and think, That a Woman can't be always on her Guard, who has so just a
Cause for Resentment, as,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Unfortunate, Humble Servant,
<HI>AMANDA.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>IT the Admiration, which is due to such a Merit as this Lady's,
did not place her above Pity, I cou'd be sorry for that Persecution, which
she Laments, in so <HI>Elegant,</HI> and <HI>Pathe∣tic,</HI> a Manner. The
Gentleman, who is so unhappy as to be the Subject of her Com∣plaint, will be
the last, that feels the Force of it.—There is a <HI>Love of
ourselves,</HI> deeply rooted in human Nature, that imposes on us, first,
and, then, emboldens us to impose on Others. We do not <HI>approve</HI> the
Faults, which we are guilty of; But, which is almost as bad, we <HI>cannot
see</HI> them:—We join hear∣tily in, with those, who condemn the very
Follies which are most remarkably <HI>our own</HI>; and are all the while
insensible how ridicu∣lous we appear to Others, by adhering pub∣lickly 
<PB N="73" REF="74"/> to the <HI>Practice</HI> of what we, as pub∣lickly,
continue to <HI>Censure.</HI></P>
<P>IT is, I must confess, the hardest Lesson of Nature, to
correct the Extravagancies of <HI>Love.</HI>—Where this Passion is
Real, It will be the <HI>Sovereign</HI> of the Mind. It moulds the Soul to its
own Purposes; and lends its own Eyes to the Understanding. Neither does it
depend, for its Violence, or Moderation, on the Capacity of the Lover, but on
the Pro∣portion, in which it actuates him. The Wise Man, in this Case, has
no Prerogative, above the Fool. It is in <HI>Love,</HI> as it in
<HI>Madness,</HI> The more Exalted the <HI>Genius,</HI> the more un∣bounded
the <HI>Raging!</HI>—A Wise Man may much better <HI>defend</HI>
himself, than a Fool can; But, when He <HI>yields,</HI> there is no
Difference; because <HI>Opinion,</HI> in this Passion, always stands in
the Place of <HI>Reason.</HI></P>
<P>THIS being the Case, <HI>AMANDA</HI> has small Encouragement;
who, by appealing to what is <HI>Reasonable,</HI> would disswade her
Lover from what is <HI>Necessary.</HI>—Her Charms have deprived his
Life of every Comfort, but what <HI>She</HI> gives it; and, while He loves, at
the Rate she says he does, it will be im∣possible for him, to
<HI>think</HI> himself so much in the Wrong, as she finds him.</P>
<P>IT would, certainly, be a Great Happi∣ness, if Men, who love,
without Hope, could desist, without Misery: For, besides that
<HI>AMANDA</HI>'s Argument has thrown an Air of ungenerous Selfishness, on
the <HI>Obsti∣nacy</HI> <PB N="74" REF="75"/> of such Addresses, there
is This further Mischief in it, That a Lover, whom an avowed <HI>Hatred</HI>
cannot repulse, in his Appli∣cation, cuts off his Right, when he becomes a
<HI>Husband,</HI> to complain of, or return, <HI>Ill Usage,</HI>—Is
she too Cold, too Unkind, too Disdainful, for a <HI>Wife?</HI>—How
much grea∣ter is His Fault, who <HI>foresaw</HI> all This, and, yet, would
<HI>make her one?</HI>—He <HI>loved</HI> Her, before She <HI>pitied</HI>
Him, and consented to be∣come <HI>His,</HI> notwithstanding the most open
<HI>Profession</HI> of her Insensibility! And how Base, and
Ungenerous must it be, To make the <HI>Continuance</HI> of that
Insensibility his Pre∣tence for treating her Ill, after she has put her
self under his Protection; which, while she refus'd, and detested him,
had no Power to move his Resentment!</P>
<P>EITHER, He ought, with a manly Forti∣tude, to <HI>tear</HI>
himself from the Remembrance of an Object, so insensible of his
Torments; or, in Gratitude, for a Compliance, that was Involuntary, and the
Effect, rather, of Compassion, than of Love, He should re∣solve to
support himself under the Misfortune of her Aversion, without permitting
his own Sentiments to be imbittered, by the Effects of it; till, by a
Progress of perswasive Soft∣ness, He shall have touched her reluctant
Heart, and prepared it to receive Impressions, as well of <HI>Love,</HI> as
of <HI>Gratitude.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, how Monstrous is the Brutal Figure, which I have seen
some <HI>Husbands</HI> make! <PB N="75" REF="76"/> who, when <HI>Lovers,</HI>
were the Poorest, and most Abject, of all <HI>Slaves!</HI>—When they
should be <HI>Defenders,</HI> they are <HI>Tyrants</HI>; and when it was
reasonable for them to have been <HI>Provoked,</HI> they were <HI>stupidly
Submissive!</HI>—How contemptible is their unmanly Weak∣ness! A
morose and restless <HI>Peevishness,</HI> makes up the Behaviour they
expect to <HI>charm by!</HI> They contract a surly, sower Habit, from the
Disappointments they meet in Life; and, instead of softening the Edge of
Afflicti∣on, toward the Woman, who is bound to share their Sufferings, they
double them on <HI>her Head,</HI> from whom, (in Honour, and Hu∣manity) they
ought to ward off Sorrow, by a noble Sweetness, and endearing Tenderness in
their whole Behaviour!</P>
<P>BUT the pleasantest Stupidity of all, is, That when, by a
Length of Savage Cruel∣ties, they have made themselves compleatly Odious;
they are impudent enough to <HI>won∣der, How it happens that their Wives appear
no fonder of them?</HI></P>
<P>THERE is no Part of our Life that requires a nicer Conduct than
our Choice of the Per∣son, with whom we are to <HI>vow an inseperable
Union;</HI> and, yet, there is Nothing, which we venture on, with more
Rashness; or which we examine, with so little Foresight!—And,
hence it is, That <HI>MATRIMONY,</HI> with equal Satyr, and Justice, has been
com∣pared, by one of our Old Poets, To a <HI>Crowd</HI> in the <HI>Street,</HI>
which excites a Curiosity, in <PB N="76" REF="77"/> every
<HI>Passer-by,</HI> to add one Fool to the Number: But, they are no
sooner in the midst of the Press, than they grow uneasy at their
Situation, and are as Eager to elbow out again, as they were, before, to gain
Ad∣mission.</P>
<Q> 
<L><HI>MARRIAGE</HI> is like unto a <HI>Rabble-Rout;</HI></L> 
<L>They, that are <HI>OUT,</HI> would fain get <HI>IN;</HI></L>

<P>MANY are the <HI>Pleasantries,</HI> which the Truth, and
Frequency, of this unlucky Ob∣servation have given Occasion to, among
<HI>Men of Wit</HI>; who, having laugh'd, a while, at Others, grow silly
enough, themselves, to be also laughed at, in their Turns.—But, in
all the Multitude of Sarcastick Fancies, which I have met with, upon this
<HI>beaten</HI> Subject, I remember none, that is so uncommon, and founded on
so humorous a Piece of Extrava∣gance, as an EPITAPH, which I saw, at
<HI>Rome</HI>; where a Man, and his Wife, who were buried, together, are
represented quar∣relling, in their Grave.—The Original is in
<HI>Latin,</HI> but I will translate it, for the Service of <HI>Coquets,</HI>
and <HI>Old Maids,</HI> who cannot fail to make Good Use of it, on a THEME,
which they delight in handling.</P>

<P>BY this Time, I suppose, I pass for an <HI>Out-of-the-Way
Old Humourist,</HI> who has No∣thing in him, but a few <HI>odd
Whimsies,</HI> which he takes Delight to be noted for. But, now the
<HI>Town</HI> begins to <HI>fill,</HI> I design to take <HI>more</HI> 
<PB N="78" REF="79"/> <HI>State</HI> upon me: And before the <HI>Winter</HI> is
half out, I shall cause it to appear, <HI>pretty Plainly,</HI> That I can
make free with <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Poli∣ticks,</HI> as well as with
<HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Impertinence.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS walking, the other Day, near the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI>
and took up a little <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> that lay in my Way, at a Bookseller's
Shop, Intituled, <HI>New, and Accurate Observations, on the Coast of
GUINEA.</HI>—I was pleas'd with this Subject: For, tho' I inform'd my
<HI>Reader,</HI> my first setting out, That I was an <HI>Enemy to the
East-India Company,</HI> (by which hangs a <HI>Secret,</HI> that may be
disclos'd in some future Paper) yet I am a <HI>Lover of THE ROYAL
AFRICAN:</HI> And have good <HI>Reasons,</HI> for <HI>both Opinions.</HI></P>
<P>THE Gentleman, who is Author of the above-mention'd
<HI>Treatise,</HI> is a <HI>Physician,</HI> new∣ly return'd from the
<HI>Coast</HI> he writes of.—He seems to be a Person of
<HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Experi∣ence</HI>; and expresses himself with a
Warmth of <HI>Spirit,</HI> that carries in it a Generous <HI>Plainness,</HI>
and a rough, but Manly, <HI>Integrity.</HI>—When I began to peruse his
<HI>Book,</HI> I thought He ap∣pear'd too <HI>Angry:</HI> But, before I had
read it out, the <HI>ill Usage</HI> He complains of, seem'd incapable of
being remember'd, without an Agitation of such Passions, as must leave
him fully acquitted.—The <HI>Abuses</HI> and
<HI>Misma∣nagements,</HI> which this Gentleman enumerates, are such, as I
am sorry to hear of, because their <HI>Consequences</HI> must affect
the <HI>Company,</HI> in too sensible a <HI>Manner.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80"/>I HAVE often reflected, not without the
utmost Amazement, from what strange <HI>Cau∣ses</HI> it shou'd happen,
That the <HI>Credit</HI> of <HI>that Company</HI> has been sunk, to so low
an <HI>Ebb</HI>; since nothing can be more demonstrable, than that It has
<HI>Advantages,</HI> beyond Comparison, above all others, to make it self
the most <HI>Flourishing!</HI>—If any Deficience, within
themselves, with Regard to <HI>Stock,</HI> or <HI>Encou∣ragement,</HI> is the
Prevention of their <HI>Good Pur∣poses,</HI> methinks, their
<HI>Complaints</HI> cou'd be no sooner heard, than they wou'd be sure of a
<HI>Remedy!</HI> For, even as they, now stand, no <HI>Company</HI> exists,
that is of such <HI>Importance</HI> to the <HI>Nation.</HI>—If the
Interest of <HI>England,</HI> in Respect to <HI>Trade,</HI> depends most,
as it certain∣ly does, upon her <HI>American Plantations,</HI> those
Plantations do, as certainly, depend on the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> from
<HI>AFRICA.</HI> A <HI>Trade!</HI> that strengthens us, in the very Vitals,
and first Principle of <HI>Government:</HI> For it is perpe∣tually adding
Encrease to the Numbers of our useful People; far beyond the
progressive <HI>Growth</HI> of our <HI>slow,</HI> and <HI>Natural
Multipli∣cation.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Nation,</HI> too, (in Point of <HI>Wealth,</HI> as well as
<HI>Power</HI>) is, to an infinite Degree, more advantag'd than <HI>The
Company,</HI> by Effect of this <HI>Negro Traffick.</HI> When the
<HI>Company</HI> have sold a <HI>Slave,</HI> That Profit, which they once
make, is <HI>All</HI> the <HI>Benefit,</HI> which he can, ever, bring
them.—But, for the Benefit of the <HI>Nation,</HI> there is no computing
what may be <PB N="80" REF="81"/> gain'd, by him. Not only the Wretch,
him∣self, but his Children's Children, after him, down to the latest
Generations, are, for ever, doom'd to <HI>Work</HI>; and <HI>All</HI> their
Product is the <HI>Nation's.</HI>—The Difference is Vast, and
Infinite!</P>
<P>THE Extent of Country, comprehend∣ed within the Limits of <HI>This
Company's Char∣ter,</HI> is Prodigious and Astonishing! For above
<HI>Thirty Degrees,</HI> on one Side, from the <HI>Line,</HI> and about
<HI>Twenty,</HI> from the other, all the <HI>Coast</HI> is within their
Limits: So that they have all the <HI>Good,</HI> Variety, of Soils, and of
Latitude, which the <HI>whole World</HI> can afford them.—They have,
consequently, within their Bounds, a proper Earth and Climate, for every rich
Product, that we pick up here and there, at the remotest Distances, from
one Side of the <HI>Globe</HI> to the other.—They have not, it is true, a
Claim of Property to the <HI>Lands:</HI> But, how easily might they
purchase it, as far as cou'd be necessary, at Rates too inconsi∣derable
to deserve the naming?—They have Islands too, and Settlements, never
subject to the Natives Insults.—Why might not these be cultivated?
Why not <HI>Rice, Sugar, Indigo, Cotton, Ginger,</HI> and <HI>Tobacco,</HI>
brought hence, as well as from <HI>America?</HI> And how much sooner, and
easier?</P>
<P>IN one short and comprehensive View, may be seen a
Demonstration of the Diffe∣rence, as to the <HI>Company's Profit,</HI>
between the <HI>Slaves</HI> they transport to <HI>America,</HI> and those 
<PB N="81" REF="82"/> whom they might employ, if they pleas'd, to raise
Products, for their own Benefit.</P>
<P>TO say nothing of the Charge of Shipping them, which wou'd be
sav'd, upon All, so employ'd, in <HI>Africa</HI>; nor to insist on the
ma∣fest Advantage, of cheaper <HI>Freight,</HI> and short∣er
<HI>Voyages,</HI> what can be plainer than this Way of
Reasoning?—Compute the <HI>Company's</HI> Profit, by the Sale of a
<HI>Negro,</HI> to be Equal with what might be Gain'd by him, in a <HI>Year's
Work,</HI> over and above his Maintain∣ance, and the Interest of his Prime
Cost, (which it certainly never is) yet, the <HI>Negro,</HI> that
<HI>WORKS</HI> for the <HI>Company,</HI> costs no more, than One, who is
<HI>SOLD,</HI> for them: Whereas this <HI>Last</HI> is wholly
<HI>Lost,</HI> from that Day forward, to their Interest; while the
<HI>First,</HI> returns them Yearly, the <HI>same Profit, during Life,</HI>
without new <HI>Charge,</HI> to Balance it.</P>
<P>I SPOKE, just now of Products, which are commonly rais'd, by our
<HI>Planters</HI> in <HI>America</HI>; and might, as certainly, be rais'd in
<HI>Africa</HI>; But there are <HI>Eastern Harvests,</HI> of much greater
Consequence, which <HI>Time,</HI> I hope, will teach <HI>This Company</HI> to
reap, without more Difficulty, than may gradually be sur∣mounted!—Why
not the richest of the <HI>East Indian Spices, Pepper, Nutmegs,
Cloves,</HI> and <HI>Cinnamon,</HI> procur'd and planted there? They have
<HI>Soil</HI> and <HI>Climate</HI> exactly the same, with those in which
they grow: Nay, they have <HI>wild Spices,</HI> rising naturally, under their
<PB N="82" REF="83"/> Agent's Eyes, to be as it were, an <HI>Indication,</HI>
and push 'em forward, to Attempt it!</P>
<P>BUT, if they will not be perswaded to <HI>transplant</HI>
Advantages, at least they might pos∣sess themselves of those, which
lie before them. They have <HI>Gold,</HI> which the Natives gather and bring
down to their Forts and Factories. I know what <HI>Difficulties</HI> attend the
<HI>View,</HI> I am about proposing: And I know too, that tho' they are
<HI>Considerable,</HI> they are <HI>far from Unsur∣mountable.</HI> What
hinders, then, but that the <HI>Uplands</HI> might be discover'd; and perhaps
the <HI>Gold Mines</HI> found, and work'd upon, by the Natives themselves,
for the <HI>Company's</HI> Bene∣fit, in Exchange, for what those Natives
va∣lue more, but which wou'd cost little to their Furnishers? And this
Attempt, tho' peacea∣bly establish'd and pursued, might, for more certain
Safety, be protected by the Awe of an Armed Force: A very small one, were
sufficient here, where Numbers are of little Strength, for want of Courage or
of Order.</P>
<P>HOW much more Useful, than some of their present Factories,
would Forts and Settle∣ments be, a Hundred Miles, or more, in Di∣stance, One
above the Other, along the <HI>Ni∣ger,</HI> or some other of those
Prodigious <HI>Rivers,</HI> which flow a Course of two or three Thou∣sand
Miles, through the <HI>Heart</HI> of this vast and unknown
<HI>Continent?</HI> How easie were it for the People in these Forts, to
possess and cultivate, a large Tract round them? To dis∣cover the
Bordering <HI>Country</HI> and <HI>Trade,</HI> and <PB N="83" REF="84"/> make
Leagues with the Neighbouring <HI>Prin∣ces?</HI> To maintain a regular and
frequent Correspondence with each other, by means of Light Vessels, with
flat Bottoms, adapted to the Navigation properest for those
<HI>Rivers:</HI> And once a Year, or oftener, to send down their General
Stores, to the <HI>Company's</HI> Ships, at the Entrance, and receive back,
with the Return of their small Vessels, what should be sent them from
Home, either for their Sup∣port or Traffick!—What new, and number∣less
Nations might the <HI>Company</HI> thus <HI>Trade with, at first Hand,</HI>
to their unspeakable En∣richment?—And were such an Entrance once
open'd to them, by expert and resolute Adventurers, what popular Encrease
of Con∣sumption, would it not occasion, in our <HI>Wool∣len,</HI> and many
other, <HI>Manufactures?</HI></P>
<P>THERE are no Impossibilies, in Designs, of this Nature, but
to narrow and confin'd Understandings; and to Spirits of a heavy Fabrick. But
this <HI>Company</HI> has the Honour to be assisted by Great Genius's,
Wise, and Enterprizing enough to mark out the Way, to Measures that might
soon recover them from the present <HI>Ill Prospect of their
Affairs,</HI> and make the Memory of the <HI>ROYAL AFRICAN COMPANY</HI> Dear
and Glorious to all Posterity.</P>
<P>IT is a <HI>Work</HI> of too much Length, for such a Paper as
mine is, to <HI>prove</HI> how practicable these Things are; But I shall,
sometimes, occasionally, touch the Subject, with the Bre∣vity 
<PB N="84" REF="85"/> I am confin'd to: Because, when I con∣sider into what
Hands my <HI>Hints</HI> may fall, I flatter my self, they may grow
<HI>Fruitful,</HI> and become a <HI>Service</HI> to my <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Duke of CHANDOS,</HI> in the Head of These, has so
Fine, and so Enlarg'd a Spi∣rit; and is so Great, and so Acknowledg'd, an
Honour to our Nation, That it is scarce possible to express, in his
Praise, so much as every wise Man <HI>must Think of him!</HI>—I
dare not, therefore, attempt so hard a Task as his full Character: But, while
I mention him, I am on Fire, with such an Admiration of his Generous
Qualities, that I cannot forbear to close my Paper, with such faint
<HI>Out-lines,</HI> as can be Sketch'd, by One who <HI>draws</HI> at too much
Distance.</P>
<P>IT is not alone, in the Princely Grandeur of his
<HI>Oeconomy,</HI> that this Illustrious Lord reflects a Brightness on his
<HI>Honour'd Order,</HI> and points out to us, in a shining Light, what a
<HI>Nobleman</HI> was meant to be. <HI>Appear∣ance,</HI> He well knows, can be
no more than the <HI>Shadow</HI> of Substantial <HI>Glory.</HI>—He
looks inward, therefore, and draws out, into Pra∣ctice and Example, such a
surprizing Train of <HI>Vertues,</HI> That, instead of supporting his
<HI>Di∣stinction</HI> upon the <HI>Title,</HI> which was so justly due to
his, He has added <HI>to it</HI> much more <HI>Honour,</HI> than some, who
wear it with a Colder Spirit, have been able to borrow <HI>from it.</HI></P>
<P>THO' Descended from a <HI>Noble Line,</HI> one of the most
<HI>Ancient</HI> of the Kingdom! He dis∣dain'd <PB N="85" REF="86"/> to owe
his Greatness to the Grandeur of his <HI>Ancestors:</HI> Nor ever thought
of his <HI>Fore-Father's Honours,</HI> but as an Archer rai∣ses his Eye to
the Point of some high Steeple, when he would shoot his Arrow <HI>over
it.</HI></P>
<P>HOW Inconsiderable, in so Generous a <HI>Taste</HI> as
<HI>His,</HI> are all the <HI>Glitterings</HI> of a <HI>De∣pendant
Greatness!</HI> How much Nobler, after <HI>His, more than Imperial,</HI>
Manner, to adorn and serve this Country, his own un∣bounded Expence, than to
be more busie, to perhaps less Purpose, and be <HI>Paid,</HI> for his
Want of <HI>Liberty,</HI> at the <HI>Head</HI> of an
<HI>Admini∣stration!</HI></P>
<P>THE World lies open, to his Eye, and All its Interests are
exactly known to him: But nothing can he see, in any Part, or happy Corner of
it, more belov'd and worthy, than he himself is!—There is this too,
Peculiar in him, That his <HI>Mind,</HI> with all its <HI>Vastness,</HI> is
serenely <HI>Centrical</HI> and <HI>Regular:</HI> His <HI>Pur∣poses</HI>
are as Rational as Great. His <HI>Under∣standing</HI> is Clear. His
<HI>Penetration</HI> is Bound∣less. His <HI>Resolution</HI> is Ardent; and
his <HI>Ap∣plications</HI> are Calm and Stedfast!</P>
<P>HE knows, and marks, the nicest Diffe∣rence between Dignity and
Pride, Generosity and Ostentation; Condescension and
Weak∣ness!—He reconciles State with Easiness; and teaches Reverence
to Freedom! How Ex∣tensive is his Wisdom! How Unwearied his Industry! How
Magnificent his Liberality! How Enlarg'd are his Idea's! How Unre∣strain'd 
<PB N="86" REF="87"/> by Prejudice! How Unconfin'd to Party!—What
Astonishment would it pro∣duce, in the Minds of ordinary Men, could a a
History be given the World, of the Im∣mensity of those Princely Expences,
which might be charg'd to his Humanity!—The Charity of the Common World
would blush, and hide it self at the Comparison: For the Munificence of
this prodigious <HI>Spirit,</HI> would swallow up all other Benignity, as the
Enli∣ven'd <HI>Rod</HI> of <HI>Moses</HI> devour'd the Serpents of the
<HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are his <HI>Known</HI> and <HI>Publick Beau∣ties!</HI> But,
what Amiable <HI>Private Qualities</HI> must there be, in so exalted a
<HI>Mind!</HI> which are hid from the distant <HI>World,</HI> and appear only

<P>THERE is no kind of <HI>Wit,</HI> which re∣quires a livelier
Force, or more com∣prehensive Turn of <HI>Spirit,</HI> than That which we
inscribe on <HI>Monuments,</HI> to express the <HI>Characters</HI> of the
<HI>Dead:</HI> And I am sorry I have Reason to observe, That almost
every Church, in <HI>England,</HI> is a Witness of our De∣ficience in
it.—The Fire of <HI>Fancy</HI> should, on these Occasions, be
extreamly Intense, and Subtile, because, wanting Continuity, it has all its
<HI>Effect</HI> at a <HI>Flash</HI>; and can therefore have no
<HI>Medium:</HI> It must be either <HI>piercing</HI> or
<HI>contemptible.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I stand before the <HI>Tomb</HI> of Mr. <HI>Dry∣den,</HI>
in <HI>Westminster-Abbey,</HI> I am in Debate with my self concerning
that Delicacy of Ve∣neration, which was the Cause of its being inscrib'd
with no more than his <HI>Immortal Name.</HI>—The Noble Founder thought
it Superfluous to add any Thing, after that: <PB N="88" REF="89"/> Because
there scarce <HI>lives</HI> a <HI>Reader,</HI> who can be unacquainted with
his <HI>Character.</HI>—Yet, methinks, on the other Hand, the
Expression of a Decent <HI>Gratitude,</HI> may be held Due to a
<HI>Benefactor,</HI> however rais'd above the Want, or Expectation of our
Benevolence. And, to carry it yet farther, tho' no Profanation cou'd be more
unpardonable, than the Pro∣duct of a <HI>Vulgar Genius,</HI> on a
<HI>Subject</HI> so exal∣ted, there is, at least, <HI>One Spirit,</HI> in
the <HI>Na∣tion,</HI> greatly Equal to the Labour! And This, the Founder of the
<HI>Monument</HI> must have known, more certainly than any other Person,
because more nearly conversant with, and more sufficiently a Judge of,
him.</P>
<P>I WOU'D not, after this, say, I mean Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> but
that, in the Course of my <HI>Papers,</HI> I shall let him perceive, that I
am no <HI>Flatterer.</HI>—I have wish'd to see <HI>His Soul</HI> do
Honour to his <HI>Father's Dust,</HI> and animate a Marble, which can never
be more dignified, than it is, unless <HI>His own Remains</HI> shou'd
visit it!—When my <HI>Passions</HI> feel his <HI>Force,</HI> in
<HI>Eloise's</HI> struggling <HI>Conflicts,</HI> I attend him, thro' the
<HI>Depths</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> with the Reve∣rence which is due to
God-like <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Philosophy!</HI> And, while my Fancy
flames, and glitters, in the sportive Vastness of his <HI>Levity,</HI>
where <HI>Belinda</HI>'s <HI>Hair</HI> attracts him, I am transported at his
<HI>Wit,</HI> and <HI>Gaiety,</HI> and grow <HI>in Love</HI> with his Good
<HI>Breeding!</HI> Yet, Five Parts in Six, I doubt, of all that
<HI>Admi∣ration</HI> which has been paid to these inimitable 
<PB N="89" REF="90"/> <HI>Flights</HI> of <HI>Genius,</HI> is
<HI>Implicite,</HI> and <HI>mere Ac∣cident:</HI> For there are
<HI>Strokes,</HI> so <HI>fine</HI> and <HI>de∣licate,</HI> that like
<HI>Angels,</HI> they must be <HI>invi∣sible</HI> to the Eyes of <HI>Common
Mortals,</HI> and seen only by those happy <HI>Few,</HI> whom
<HI>Heaven</HI> vouchsafes <HI>a Visit</HI> to!</P>
<P>I HAVE been shewn an EPITAPH lately, which is said to have
been written by this <HI>Gentleman,</HI> for the <HI>Tomb</HI> of a Friend of
his: The Thought, on which it turns, is very happy, and extreamly
Natural.—It has been publish'd, in some of our
<HI>Weekly-Papers</HI>; but not so full as I here give it.</P>
<Q> 
<L>To this sad Shrine, whoe're thou art, draw near,</L> 
<L>Here lies the <HI>FRIEND,</HI> most wept, the <HI>SON</HI>
most <HI>dear,</HI></L> 
<L>Who ne'er knew <HI>Joy,</HI> but <HI>Friendship</HI> might
divide;</L> 
<L>Nor gave his Father <HI>Grief</HI>—but, when he
<HI>died!</HI></L> 
<L>How vain is Reason! Eloquence, how weak!</L> 
<L>When <HI>POPE</HI> must tell, what <HI>HARCOURT cannot
speak!</HI></L> 
<L>Yet, <HI>Let</HI> thy once lov'd <HI>Friend</HI> inscribe thy
Stone:</L> 
<L>And, with a <HI>Father</HI>'s Sorrows, mix his own.</L> 
<L>Ah, no! 'tis vain to strive—It <HI>will not be.</HI></L>

<L>No Grief, that <HI>can</HI> be <HI>told,</HI> is felt for
<HI>THEE!</HI></L></Q>
<P>THE <HI>Manuscripts,</HI> of this fine EPITAPH, which are handed
about Town, have, already, <HI>various Readings:</HI> And in some, the two
last Lines are wholly omitted. But, I can never suppose a Castration,
of that <HI>Importance, Ge∣nuine</HI>; because the <HI>Close,</HI> at the
first Break, has a Strength, so full, and distinguish'd, that 
<PB N="90" REF="91"/> it left an absolute Necessity, for a vigorous Turn
of Thought, in the Conclusion of that which follows it: Whereas nothing could
ap∣pear more languid, and unequal to its Au∣thor, than to have ended, after
so <HI>fine</HI> a <HI>Stroke,</HI> with saying no more, than this: <HI>Let
your Friend write your Epitaph; and tell the World, that he is as sorry for
your Death, as your Father is.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE not, I think, at home, read any Piece, of this Kind, more
striking, and strongly rais'd upon the <HI>Force</HI> of its touching
<HI>Simplicity!</HI> But I remember to have seen two <HI>Epitaphs,</HI> both,
<HI>Foreign</HI>; which gave me a Delight, of the same Nature.—I
shall translate them, as near I can, into <HI>Eng∣lish.</HI> This,
first, is by a <HI>French Poet,</HI> on the Death of <HI>Cardinal
Richlieu:</HI> And has in it, a certain Mixture of the <HI>Great,</HI> the
<HI>Natural,</HI> and the <HI>Surprizing,</HI> which is very rarely to be met
with.</P>
<Q> 
<L><HI>Stay, Traveller!—for, All you want, is near,</HI></L> 
<L>Wisdom, and Power, I seek.—<HI>They, both, lie
here.</HI></L> 
<L>Nay, but I look for more, and raise my Aim,</L> 
<L>To Wit, Taste, Learning, Elegance, and Fame.</L> 
<L><HI>Here ends your Journey, then: For, here, the STORE</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Of</HI> RICHLIEƲ <HI>lies.</HI>—Alas! repeat no
more.</L> 
<L>Shame on my Pride! What Hope is left, for Me,</L> 
<L>When, here, Death treads on All, that Man can be.</L></Q>
<P>THE Second, which now follows, is of <HI>Spanish Original</HI>;
and was the <HI>Epitaph</HI> <PB N="91" REF="92"/> of a beautiful Neice of the
Famous <HI>Oli∣varez.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>If (weeping <HI>Love!</HI>) Inquirers seek to know</L> 
<L>Her <HI>Name,</HI> whose Charms enrich the Dust below;</L> 
<L>Point up, and bid 'em read:—But, say no more:</L> 
<L>Nor strive, in vain, to count her <HI>Vertues</HI> o'er.</L> 
<L>Scarce cou'd the sweet Amount be justly sung,</L> 
<L>Tho' Her <HI>Each Atom</HI> were an <HI>Angel</HI>'s
<HI>Tongue!</HI></L></Q>
<P>WHERE there is Justness, and Propriety, in these
<HI>Rays</HI> and <HI>Beamings</HI> of the <HI>Wit,</HI> they break out upon
our <HI>Fancy,</HI> with irresistable Force and Lustre! We are often
dazzled, for a Moment, even with the false Imitation of it, where the
<HI>proper Sence</HI> is mingled, and confounded with the
<HI>Metaphorical.</HI> But we no sooner examine it, closely, than the
Coun∣terfeit Colours vanish, and we despise our own, and the
<HI>Poet</HI>'s <HI>Weakness:</HI> Whereas, when the Thought is
<HI>just,</HI> as well as <HI>shining</HI>; when it is founded on Truth, in
Nature, and only raises our Admiration by its Grandeur, Grace, and
Nobleness, the Heat, contracted, and pointed strong, upon a near, and
single, Center, inflames and catches, like a <HI>Burning Glass</HI>; and
Stocks and Stones, are melted down by it, almost as suddenly as Gold and
Silver.</P>
<P>IT were a Work of General Use, and no unpleasant
Entertainment, to make a <HI>Mu∣ster</HI> of those False
<HI>Thoughts,</HI> or affected <HI>Turns</HI> of <HI>Wit,</HI> and pass 'em,
in <HI>Review,</HI> <PB N="92" REF="93"/> oppos'd to such, as are True and
Solid.—The Common <HI>Taste</HI> would stand corrected, and consent
to give up their <HI>Favourites</HI>; for Few can want Good Sense to
distingush, when they see 'em together; and mark, that <HI>Truth,</HI>
(which is Nature represented exactly as she appears) is the <HI>Life</HI>
and <HI>Soul,</HI> of Thinking; and <HI>Greatness, Delicacy,</HI> and
<HI>Delightfulness,</HI> the fine <HI>Dress,</HI> and <HI>Ornaments,</HI>
of it.</P>
<P>THE black <HI>Eyes</HI> of the <HI>Spanish Ladies,</HI> have a
Jack-o'the-Lanthern <HI>Brightness,</HI> that is very apt to
<HI>mislead</HI> the <HI>Poets</HI> of that warm Country. The following
<HI>Sonnet</HI> is a <HI>Master∣piece,</HI> of its Kind, and may deserve to
stand as an <HI>Example</HI> of that <HI>False Wit</HI> above-mention'd: As
consisting, chiefly, of contra∣dictory <HI>Idea's,</HI> which are forc'd
together, like <HI>Oil,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> by the Violence of the
Writer's <HI>Fancy</HI>; but seperate, and distinguish themselves, as
soon as they have Time to <HI>settle.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>I know, too well, my cruel FAIR!</L>
<L>Why those sweet <HI>Eyes</HI> have <HI>Sable</HI>
Covers,</L>
<L>Mere Pity bids 'em <HI>Mourning</HI> wear,</L>
<L>To grieve the <HI>Fate</HI> of <HI>murder'd Lovers.</HI></L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Assist me, then, thou <HI>killing</HI> Maid!</L>
<L>I <HI>hate</HI> my Foe, and <HI>must</HI> defeat him:</L>
<L>Oh! lend me but those <HI>Eyes,</HI> in Aid,</L>
<L>And He's <HI>Stone Dead,</HI> when next I meet him.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94"/>BUT tho' such <HI>Turns</HI> as
<HI>These</HI> are unnatu∣ral, and therefore ridiculous, when apply'd to any
serious Purpose, yet there <HI>are Turns,</HI> both upon <HI>Words</HI> and
<HI>Thoughts,</HI> that, pre∣serving the Truth of Meaning, are so far from
being Faults, that in all the lighter Kinds of <HI>Poetry,</HI> they are
extremely graceful and desirable. Thus in the famous <HI>Epigram</HI> of
<HI>Ausonius,</HI> relating to <HI>Dido,</HI> who fled from
<HI>Phaenicia</HI> to <HI>Carthage,</HI> upon the Death of her Lover
<HI>Sichaeus,</HI> and, afterwards, died her self, upon <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s
forsaking her, the Thought is just and solid; and tho' it glitters, and
is so full of <HI>Point,</HI> yet, it bears, without <HI>dimi∣nishing,</HI>
every <HI>Light</HI> that it can be view'd in.—I will give both the
<HI>Latin</HI> and the <HI>English,</HI> because our <HI>Language</HI> has
been judg'd incapable of expressing it, without more Compass, and
Weakness, than the <HI>Original.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>Infelix <HI>Dido,</HI> nulli bene nupta Marito!</L> 
<L>Hoc pereunte fugis: Hoc fugiente peris.</L> </Q>
<Q> 
<L>Poor Queen! twice doom'd disastr'ous <HI>Love</HI> to
try;</L> 
<L>You fly the Dying; for the Flying, die!</L> </Q>
<P>THERE is something too, of an elevated Smartness, and that
will bear the nicest Exa∣mination, in the <HI>Thought</HI> of a <HI>French
Poet,</HI> concerning a <HI>Cardinal,</HI> already nam'd; who was accus'd of
holding too great an <HI>Ascendant</HI> over his <HI>Master.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="94" REF="95"/> 
<L>Il est trop absolu, sur l' Esprit de son
Maistre.</L> 
<L>Mais son Maistre, per Luy, est le Maistre des Roy's.</L></Q>
<Q> 
<L>Tho' he shadow'd his Master, with arrogant Wings,</L> 
<L>Yet, he made, whom he master'd, the Master of Kings.</L></Q>
<P>IT is this Power, in the Conception! This comprehensive Grasp
of Meaning! where more than can be <HI>express'd,</HI> in Pages, is crowded
into a <HI>single Sentiment,</HI> and insinuated to the Reader, so as to
swell, and expand it self, in his Understanding! It is <HI>This,</HI>
that is True <HI>Poetry!</HI> That makes up that illu∣strious <HI>Art,</HI>
which is therefore justly, call'd <HI>Divine,</HI> because it shakes, and
moulds the Soul, and bows to its Purposes; transports us out of our
selves, and raises a <HI>Creation,</HI> round us, which is wholly of its
own esta∣blishing!</P>
<P>BUT how different from this, is <HI>Poetry,</HI> as it is commonly
understood and practis'd!—A trifling Skill in Measure, and an easie
Sweep in Rhyming, are no more what makes the <HI>Poet,</HI> than the
<HI>Chimes</HI> can be call'd the <HI>Church,</HI> or the <HI>Chariot</HI>
makes the <HI>Doctor.</HI> He, who <HI>thinks,</HI> in a vulgar Manner, will be
so far from concealing his Emptiness, by the <HI>Verse,</HI> he pretends
to charm by, that like the <HI>dirty Fool,</HI> in the <HI>Gospel,</HI> who
invited himself to the <HI>Marriage Feast,</HI> and sat down, among the
<HI>finest Guests, without a Wedding Garment,</HI> he will be put pointed
out, with <PB N="95" REF="96"/> the more Contempt; and serve to <HI>set
off</HI> the vast Disparity, between himself, and those he presumes
to mix with.</P>
<P>WHOEVER does but reflect on the diffe∣rent <HI>Figure, France</HI>
now makes among the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> compar'd with That, which every
Body remembers Her to have made, within these Twenty Years, will, in
Justice to a most Heroick Monarch, divest himself of the ungenerous
Littleness of Common, National, Prejudices, and observe with Plea∣sure,
That Great Prince's Influence, over the <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Genius,</HI> as
well as the <HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> of his People.—When I
read the <HI>Birth-Day-Songs</HI> of our <HI>English Laureats,</HI> I see
the Poorness of their <HI>Salary,</HI> thro' the Slightness of their
<HI>Sentiments.</HI> But the most light, and jovial, Performances of our
<HI>Neigh∣bour Nation,</HI> when they had their <HI>King</HI> for their
<HI>Theme,</HI> seem'd to glow, with a Warmth of Gratitude, as if
<HI>Reason</HI> strove with <HI>Inven∣tion,</HI> which shou'd praise
him with most Co∣piousness.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Qu'il regne ce Heros, qu'il triomphe toujours:</L> 
<L>Qu'avec luy soit toujours la Paix, ou la Victoire!</L> 
<L>Que le Cours de ses Ans dure, autant, que le Cours</L> 
<L>De la <HI>Seine,</HI> &amp; de la <HI>Loire!</HI></L> 
<L>Qu'il vive, autant que sa Gloire!</L> </Q>
<Q> 
<L>May our <HI>Hero</HI> long reign, and still triumph in
State!</L> 
<L>And <HI>Conquest,</HI> or <HI>Peace,</HI> on his
<HI>Purposes</HI> wait!</L> 
<L><PB N="96" REF="97"/>Let the Course of his Years, like the
<HI>Loire</HI> and the <HI>Seine,</HI></L>

<HI>France</HI> to implore,</L> 
<L>But, that <HI>He</HI> may <HI>live,</HI> till his <HI>Fame</HI>
lives no more!</L> </Q>
<P>I DESIGN'D, when I began this <HI>Paper,</HI> to say a great
deal more, than I have left my self Room for, concerning <HI>Epitaphs,</HI>
and <HI>Elegies</HI>; but I must refer, what remains, to some other
Opportunity: And will conclude, with one of the <HI>Sublimest</HI> Pieces of
Extra∣vagance, that ever heated the <HI>Imagination</HI> of of a
<HI>Poet.</HI>—The Author was a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and, in
describing the Assault of a Fortress, by his Countrymen, speaks of
the <HI>Ditch,</HI> in a Flight, at once so <HI>wild,</HI> and yet so
<HI>strong,</HI> that it is impossible to find a Proof, more pregnant,
that <HI>Genius</HI> without <HI>Judgment,</HI> can do nothing considerable,
in <HI>Poetry.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>The yawning Ditch <HI>declin'd,</HI> with dreadful steep,</L> 
<L>And, from Days aking <HI>Eye,</HI> so backward fell:</L> 
<L>That <HI>Saints</HI> might pass, thro' its unsounded
Deep,</L>

<P> AT last, this sweet Town, which must for ever hold my

<HI>Tunbridge,</HI> a Hundred Years ago; and went a Pilgri∣mage, in pure
Compassion, to visit a poor Thing, in <HI>Marriage Trammels</HI>: Where I
have stuck fast, ever since, in the <HI>Dirt</HI> of your Dear
<HI>Sussex.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99"/> WELL! tho' I have but half forgiven you,
for setting That <HI>breathing Whirligig, Ned Volatile,</HI> upon me; yet, I

of.—But, if ever I marry you, there is <HI>One Thing,</HI> I must
positively <HI>insist on.</HI>—You shall keep me <HI>two
Chairs,</HI> and a <HI>Chariot.</HI>—I had scarce a <HI>Scruple</HI> of
Brains, in my Head, all last Week: For, after rumbling up, in a
<HI>Stage-Coach,</HI> I was <HI>pound∣ed to Death,</HI> from the dreadful
<HI>Borough,</HI> to <HI>Park-Place,</HI> in an odious <HI>Hackney

Pray send me the <HI>Name</HI> of that Tragical <HI>Roman</HI> Tumbler, who
was barrell'd up, by the <HI>Carthaginians</HI>; and roll'd, a Mile or two,
down Hill, in a <HI>Butt,</HI> stuck full of <HI>Ten-penny-Nails?</HI>
Methinks, I pity him, from my Heart! For, I could not help thinking, while I
was bouncing up and down, in my Vehicle, like a Thim∣ble full of Shot, in a

<P> COME, and drink <HI>TEA</HI> with me To∣morrow. I know you
don't love to be <HI>look'd at:</HI> And to humour that very out-o'the-way
<HI>Taste,</HI> of yours, we will be as Retir'd, as two Snails in a

Ogle,</HI> and <HI>Gatty Gosling,</HI> and dear Lady <HI>Frightall,</HI> and
Miss <HI>Jumper,</HI> and <HI>Jack Scarecrow</HI>; and <HI>Jack,</HI> you

<HI>Family.</HI> Only if <HI>Sally Simple</HI> should chance to drop
in—or <HI>Fanny Prue,</HI> in her new <HI>Equipage,</HI> there is <HI>no
being denied to Them</HI>: For the whole Town says, That <HI>Sally</HI> has
had a <HI>Misfortune,</HI> since I went to <HI>Tunbridge:</HI> And
<HI>Fanny</HI> is a <HI>Prude,</HI> that has stoop'd as low as
<HI>Matrimony.</HI>—I long to see how they look, after the Accidents
that have befallen them.—Don't, <HI>fail</HI> at your Peril, for we want
your Sage <HI>Advice,</HI> about a <HI>Project,</HI> that is newly come into

<P> THE Business, in one Word, is <HI>Free∣dom: WOMAN's

by <HI>Nature,</HI> were form'd for <HI>Sovereignty</HI>; and can make Slaves
of <HI>those,</HI> who enslave Millions!—In short, we are come to a
Resolution to <HI>issue Writs,</HI> and call together a <HI>Female
Parlia∣ment.</HI>—You allow, that we have <HI>Wit;—We, our
selves,</HI> know <HI>we have Wisdom:</HI> And every Body has
<HI>Reason</HI> to know, that <HI>we</HI> can't want
<HI>Authority.</HI>—So, the Thing it self is past Dispute;
<HI>we</HI> have <HI>decreed, to take Government upon us:</HI> But the

<P> WE are told, by an Experienc'd <HI>Sister,</HI> who is

been at <HI>Disputation, She</HI> will have <HI>Parlia∣ment</HI> to

make good our <HI>Pretensions.</HI></P>
<P> HOWEVER, let it go. We aim at No∣thing, but our <HI>just

<P><PB N="101" REF="102"/>YET, it were certainly no harder upon the
<HI>Men,</HI> That the <HI>Women</HI> should usurp <HI>their Offices,</HI>
than it is mortifying to us <HI>Women,</HI> to see the <HI>Men</HI>
interpose, in <HI>Ours.</HI> And, what Truth can be more manifest, than,
That there are Male-Members, of more Houses than One, <HI>ungallant</HI>
enough to in∣vade us, in our very <HI>Essentials?</HI>—Some can
<HI>Dance,</HI> as well as we can; some (tho' Fewer indeed) can even
<HI>talk,</HI> as well.—Here, and there, one can <HI>manage a
Family,</HI> as well.—But an infinite Number of them can <HI>wash their
Months,</HI> as well; and vye <HI>Genius</HI> with us, in <HI>Dress,</HI> and
<HI>Diversion.</HI>—Nay, I am credibly inform'd, by an Able
<HI>Committee-Woman,</HI> of our Assembly, That she is intimate with
<HI>two</HI> of them, who are so <HI>far gone,</HI> against us, that the
first <HI>makes Shifts, and Aprons,</HI> with the finest Work-woman of his
Acquaintance: And the other can <HI>cut Paper,</HI> the best of any
<HI>Gentlewoman</HI> in the three Kingdoms!</P>
<P> IF such Wrongs as these must be <HI>tolera∣ted,</HI> away
with Order and Distinction.—Shall any Body, after this, say, we ought
not to assume a <HI>Title,</HI> because the Nation has, already
bestow'd it on <HI>Our Represen∣tatives?</HI> What were the
<HI>Nation,</HI> without <HI>Us?</HI> And how are <HI>WE Represented,</HI>
where none of our <HI>Sex</HI> are permitted to sit, and vote, for
<HI>Us?</HI> Is this <HI>Free Government?</HI> Is this to be subject to no
Laws, but those we have, first, given Cnsent to?—Either, 
<PB N="102" REF="103"/> let us, as a distinct <HI>Body,</HI> have a Right to
<HI>govern our Selves</HI>; or, admit an Equal Number of <HI>Us</HI> to sit,
where <HI>Laws</HI> are <HI>made for Us:</HI> And, I believe I may venture to
undertake, for the <HI>Absent,</HI> That we will be modest enough, in that
Case, to content our selves with a <HI>bare Negative,</HI> upon All Bills,
that concern <HI>Us.</HI></P>
<P> BUT, what shall we do, about this <HI>Diffi∣culty,</HI> of
the <HI>Name?</HI> Old Lady <HI>Lofty</HI> was for having us dignifie our
Purpose with the awful Sound of <HI>The SENATE:</HI> But, her Grand-Daughter,
who can read <HI>Horace</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> said, That <HI>Title</HI> had
an Air, too <HI>Mo∣therly,</HI> and would <HI>sit hard,</HI> upon Youth, and
Gaiety.—It was next mov'd, That a <HI>Commitee</HI> of <HI>Virgin
Elders</HI> shou'd be sent, as far as <HI>Poland,</HI> to borrow and bring
Home, the Use of the Word <HI>DIET.—Kitty Hoyden</HI> leapt out of our
her Chair, to se∣cond this <HI>Motion.</HI>—She had been inform'd,
she said, That <HI>Polish Diets</HI> are often sum∣mon'd to meet,
<HI>on Horseback</HI>; and she was positive, That no People could ride,
more Learnedly, than the <HI>Horse-women</HI> of our Country. She added, That
little more seem'd peculiar, to these <HI>Polish Diets,</HI> un∣less it
were their <HI>Art,</HI> of <HI>Quarrelling, with∣out Interval</HI>: And, in
that too, she saw no Reason, why an <HI>English Woman</HI> might not
equal them.</P>
<P> IT was now in a fair Way to be carried on this side the
<HI>Question</HI>; when <HI>Suky Shadely</HI> <PB N="103" REF="104"/> who is
newly recover'd from the <HI>Jaundice,</HI> turn'd the Tyde of Opinions, by
crying out, That she <HI>protested</HI> against the <HI>Physical</HI>
Sound of the Word; for it put her in Mind of her
<HI>Apothecary.</HI>—What at last, we all inclin'd to, was the
<HI>Turkish Title,</HI> of <HI>DIVAN.</HI> I think, <HI>CONVENTION</HI> was
whisper'd, faintly; but none of us knew what to make of it: And as for
<HI>CONVOCATION</HI> it was unanimously rejected, upon the Insinu∣ation of
a grave <HI>Arch-Deaconess,</HI> That it would be inconvenient to assume
<HI>known Ti∣tles,</HI> which under Pretence of <HI>Custom</HI> and
<HI>Precedent,</HI> might reduce us to Subordinati∣on; and bring us to feel
some Power, we should not dare to disobey, and yet be heartily vex'd, at
submitting to.</P>
<P> DEAR <HI>SLAVY,</HI> don't look grim; but <HI>think</HI> for
us, and help us out, as you wish well to your Speculations.—Come, for
your Consideration, beforehand, I will com∣municate to you the Material

<P>WHEN I was Young, I remember, among many other <HI>Follies,</HI> I
was very vain, and tenacious of my own Way of Think∣ing. I was particularly
delighted with the <HI>Notion</HI> I then had of <HI>Eloquence:</HI> And made
no Manner, of Dispute, but I was, my self, a wonderful <HI>Proficient</HI>
in it. I was ravish'd, with the flowing Swell of a long-winded Pe∣riod. I had
form'd my <HI>Taste</HI> of <HI>Stile,</HI> upon <HI>Cicero</HI>; and treated
the <HI>Commentaries</HI> of <HI>Cae∣sar</HI> with an Extraordinary Air of
Contempt, when I compar'd them with the most frothy Flourishes of That
ever-abounding <HI>Orator.</HI></P>
<P>I HAD not learnt to consider, That there is a Difference, in the
Effect of the same <HI>Words,</HI> when they are <HI>spoke,</HI> and when
they are <HI>written.</HI>—When we <HI>see,</HI> and <HI>hear,</HI> a
powerful <HI>Orator,</HI> our Reason is betray'd, and <PB N="108" REF="109"/>
dazzled, by the Interposition of our Sen∣ses.—The Grace, and
Majesty, of his <HI>Person</HI>; The never-resting Variety of his
<HI>Mo∣tion</HI>; The Aptness of his <HI>Looks,</HI> and <HI>Gesture</HI>;
The Rise and Fall of his <HI>Voice, insinuating, softening, accusing,
repeating, urging, impres∣sing,</HI> and <HI>enforcing,</HI> with a
<HI>Gradation</HI> of the strongest <HI>Passions:</HI> All these
combine, to charm, and cheat, us, into Admiration.—But, when, divested
of these Prejudices, we come to <HI>read,</HI> with a steady Judgment, what
we <HI>heard,</HI> with so much Emotion, the cold, and languid,
<HI>Oratory,</HI> depending now on <HI>Sense,</HI> and wanting all its Aid of
<HI>Emphasis,</HI> and <HI>Utterance,</HI> lies tasteless on our
Under∣standing; and <HI>Repetition,</HI> and <HI>Change</HI> of
<HI>Lights,</HI> are found to fill up the Place of <HI>Richness,</HI> and
<HI>Variety</HI> in the <HI>Conception.</HI></P>
<P>ONE of the first, who made me bold enough to break out of my
<HI>Roman Bondage,</HI> and resolve, for the future, to think, all
<HI>Words,</HI> which give a Discourse no Progress in its Meaning, rather
Burdens, than Embroi∣dery, was <HI>Montaigne,</HI> where he is speaking of
Authors.</P>
<Q>AS to <HI>Cicero,</HI> says this free-spirited
<HI>French∣man,</HI> to confess the <HI>Truth</HI> frankly, His way of
Writing appears to me very tedious. His <HI>Prefaces, Definitions,
Divisions,</HI> and <HI>Etimolo∣gies,</HI> take up the greatest Part of his
<HI>Work.</HI> There is <HI>Life</HI> indeed, and <HI>noble Life!</HI> but it
is smother'd in the dressing. When I have spent an Hour, in reading
him, I recollect <PB N="109" REF="110"/> what <HI>Substance</HI> I have
gather'd from him; and find, for the most Part, I have got no∣thing but
<HI>Wind:</HI> He is not, <HI>yet,</HI> come far enough, to be Enter'd upon his
<HI>Reasons.</HI>—Now, for <HI>Me,</HI> who only desire to be
<HI>Wise,</HI> not <HI>Eloquent,</HI> I wou'd read nothing, but what is to
the <HI>Purpose.</HI>—I know well enough, without being told, What is
<HI>meant,</HI> by <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Pleasure:</HI> Why then do they
give them∣selves the Trouble of <HI>Anatomising</HI> them? I am for
<HI>Reason,</HI> and <HI>Argument,</HI> at the first Dash, and wou'd be
instructed how to <HI>with∣stand,</HI> rather than <HI>talk quaintly
of,</HI> my Passions. I am for Charging at once, into the Heart of the
Doubt, and not Approaching it, by Way of <HI>Siege,</HI> with Logical
<HI>Lines,</HI> and <HI>Trenches.</HI>—The Subjects of <HI>Cicero</HI>
languish, by his De∣laying our Expectation. His Way was very well for the
<HI>Bar,</HI>; or might do, perhaps, for the <HI>Pulpit</HI>; and since 'tis
so common to <HI>Nod,</HI> at a <HI>Sermon,</HI> Men, in this Case, might
have Leisure to <HI>take a Nap,</HI> and wake, a Quarter of an Hour after,
Time enough to find the Thread of the <HI>Discourse.</HI> Men may speak,
in this Manner to <HI>Children,</HI> or to <HI>ignorant People:</HI> But I can
never be made Attentive, by an Author's Elocution, where his <HI>Matter</HI> is
too weak to hold me.</Q>
<P>BEFORE I had the Cood Fortune to meet with this Censure, (which
carries with it no more <HI>Boldness,</HI> than <HI>Reason</HI>) I had
ventur'd to appear, in <HI>Print,</HI> and sent some <HI>Treatises</HI>
into the World, which I have never thought <PB N="110" REF="111"/> of, from that
Time forward, without blush∣ing at my Conscious Weakness, in the
Affe∣ctation of a <HI>Stile,</HI> so <HI>Wordy,</HI> that it moves my own
Indignation, very strongly, against my self, for what I have, formerly
consider'd, as no small Part of my <HI>Merit.</HI></P>
<P>IF my <HI>own Works</HI> were of Importance enough, I wou'd
<HI>light 'em up,</HI> as a <HI>Beacon,</HI> to warn Others of the Danger: But,
since That <HI>Honour</HI> is more than they deserve, I disclaim it, with
due Modesty; and will borrow an Example, of like Nature, from an Author of
more Dignity.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman, I mean, is a Reverend and Learned
<HI>Professor:</HI> In whose <HI>Preface,</HI> to an excellent
Translation of <HI>Virgil,</HI> we are told, after, at least, as much
<HI>Instruction,</HI> as cou'd, <HI>reasonably,</HI> have been expected,
That <HI>He has, not, yet done with us: For something, more, still,
remains, behind.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, tho' much may be said, for this Gentleman's
<HI>Generosity,</HI> from the Profusion of his Desire to
<HI>satisfy</HI> us; yet a less Degree of Praise will be sufficient,
for his <HI>Discretion:</HI> Since it was not kind enough to whisper in his
Ear, that He, who tells us the same Thing, <HI>Six Times over,</HI> will
rather provoke us to <HI>Indignation</HI> than to <HI>Gratitude</HI>; because
it argues an Opinion in him, That he is talking to Persons, who have a
<HI>Deafness,</HI> in their Understanding.—When he had assur'd
us, <HI>He had not yet done,</HI> There cou'd be no Rea∣son in the World, but
the over-obliging Li∣berality <PB N="111" REF="112"/> of his <HI>Rhetorick,</HI>
to take the Trou∣ble of adding, that <HI>There was something more:</HI> Much
less, That there was <HI>something more, still!</HI>—But, when he
goes on, with so unhop'd! so unexpected! a Flow of Boun∣ty, as to add, That
there was <HI>something, more, still, that remain'd,</HI> The Obligation
was <HI>enforc'd</HI> to so surprizing a Height, that it must have been
judg'd Impossible to raise it more, if we had not found, immediately
after, That not only <HI>something, more, still, remain'd,</HI> but, that
it <HI>remain'd, behind,</HI> also!</P>
<P>I COU'D wish to see it establish'd, as a Rule among
<HI>Writers,</HI> That every Word should be a Fault, which, being taken out
of a <HI>Discourse,</HI> left no <HI>Void</HI> in the <HI>Sense:</HI>
For, to what End shou'd we use Expressions, which may be cut off,
without <HI>Maiming,</HI> or let stand, without <HI>Beauty?</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Pen of One, who attempts to write <HI>History,</HI>
happens to be thus, <HI>dropsically,</HI> disposed, He never fails to
drown his <HI>Facts,</HI> in a Deluge of <HI>Affectation.</HI>—We have
then, long <HI>Speeches</HI> of great Generals, made to their Armies, in Line
of Battle, and just on the Point of Engagement; In which the monstrous
Absurdity of supposing such a Time fit for formal Harangues, or that
they could be Audible to the Hundredth Part of the Numbers they are address'd
to, is not sufficient to deter these Orators from display∣ing all their
<HI>Tropes,</HI> with so much Fullness and Variety, that, when the Armies
come to <PB N="112" REF="113"/> <HI>Charge,</HI> the Historian has not Spirits
enough left him, (after the Fatigue of his <HI>War of Eloquence</HI>) to
observe, or explain to us, How the Battle, it self, was formed, and fought;
or by what Conduct, on one side, or Mi∣stake, on the other, The Fortune of
the Day delcared in Favour of the <HI>Victorious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>TACITUS,</HI> of all Historians, was least guilty of
using Wordiness, or Circumlocu∣tion, in his Relations.—On the
contrary, when he errs, it is in the much nobler Ex∣tream, of too Rich, and
Delicate an Excess of <HI>Sense.</HI>—He refines not on
<HI>Words,</HI> but on <HI>Things</HI>; he <HI>speaks</HI> less for his
Great Persons, than They <HI>spoke,</HI> for Themselves: But he
<HI>thinks</HI> for them much more delicately than it is probable <HI>They</HI>
ever thought.—When <HI>Gal∣gacus,</HI> at the Head of his
<HI>Britons,</HI> is about to charge the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, what Number of
Eloquent Pages could have inspired his Followers with Reflections, more apt
to in∣flame them with Heroick Sentiments, than what He <HI>flash</HI>'d upon
their Imaginations, in this comprehensive Encouragement.—<HI>Fall on,
my Friends, and, in the</HI> Shock, <HI>think of your ANCESTORS, and your
POSTE∣RITY!</HI></P>
<P>ANTIQUITY can scarce produce an In∣stance of more
perswasive Eloquence, than This <HI>Oration, in a single
Sentence!</HI>—But I have the Pleasure to see, before me, the Speech
of a <HI>Modern Leader,</HI> which, as it had an End very different, so its
Influence was <PB N="113" REF="114"/> much more
powerful.—<HI>Caesar,</HI> and many Generals, before, and after him,
inspired <HI>faint-hearted Followers, with Courage:</HI> But This is the only
Instance, I have ever met with, of a Commander, who had Rhetorick enough to
<HI>talk Brave Fellows, into Cowardice.</HI></P>
<P>THE Hero of our Story (which is, sin∣cerely, a <HI>true</HI>
one) was at his Studies, in One of the Universities of a Neighbour-Nation,
when the late Rebellion broke out, and allarmed the Care of the Government. He
was Young, and designed for a Pillar of his <HI>Mother Kirk.</HI>—Grace
and Sanctity, had there∣fore, been more in his Thoughts, than Arms, and
Slaughter: But some of his Friends, who claimed a Power in raising, and
dispo∣sing, the <HI>Militia,</HI> took a Fancy to dignify the young
<HI>Kirkman,</HI> with the Command of a <HI>Company,</HI> and gave him Orders
to march them to a <HI>Rendezvous,</HI> that was appointed, a few Days
after.</P>
<P>THE <HI>New Captain</HI> (as He tells the Story, Himself, with a
great Deal of Humour, and Frankness) thought <HI>Safety</HI> more his
Business than <HI>Valour:</HI> Yet was ashamed to appear Fearful, when
Every Body, round him, look∣ed as big, as a <HI>Bajazet.</HI>—He
resolved, there∣fore, To have Recourse to his <HI>Oratory,</HI> and try, if
it was not possible, under Pretence of <HI>Encouraging</HI> his Men, to
frighten them into <HI>Desertion.</HI>—In Pursuance of this Hope, He
drew them on the Morning appointed for the March, into a Ring, at the Foot of a
little <PB N="114" REF="115"/> Mount; and, placing himself on the Top of it,
addressed them in the following Ora∣tion; which he gave me, in his own
Hand-Writing:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Friends! Brethren! Country-Men!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> WE are marching against <HI>Enemies,</HI> who are marching,
against <HI>God:</HI> For they fight against our <HI>King</HI>; and our
King protects our <HI>Kirk:</HI> and our <HI>Kirk</HI> is the Care of
<HI>God.</HI>—So, <HI>our</HI> Enemies are <HI>God</HI>'s Enemies, and
our Cause <HI>must</HI> prevail against them.</P>
<P> AS an Officer of Command, and a Lea∣der, who knows <HI>No
Fear,</HI> It is my Duty to speak to You, in a Stile, that may inflame your
Courage.—But, as I am a <HI>Christian,</HI> as well as a
<HI>Soldier</HI>;—A Man of <HI>Humanity,</HI> as well as <HI>Mettle</HI>;
I dare not conceal from You, That there is a Danger, which I, my self, am
afraid of; I, who, to speak in the World's Notion of <HI>Fear,</HI> am so
<HI>resolv'd,</HI> that I can <HI>fear Nothing.</HI>—I mean, my Fellow
Soldiers! The Danger, which some of your Dear <HI>Souls</HI> may be in, of
rushing Headlong upon <HI>Damnation.</HI></P>
<P> IN all Probability, there will be an Im∣mediate
Engagement;—I am confident, we shall (I mean, All, who survive the
Battle, shall) suceed in the Event.—But, alas! which of us knows,
whose Lot it will be, to <HI>Fall,</HI> in the Field of Slaughter? And,
since there is Odds against your Lives, <HI>Are Ye prepar'd for approaching
Death?</HI>—<PB N="115" REF="116"/> It is, indeed, an
<HI>unseasonable</HI>; but, ah! my Friends! It is a <HI>necessary</HI>
Question.—Are ye <HI>prepar'd,</HI> I say, to die?—Have ye
<HI>Assu∣rance</HI> of <HI>Salvation?</HI></P>
<P> I acknowledge, That your Piety, your Loyalty, and your Bravery,
may intitle you to <HI>Hopes</HI> of Glory: But, if you want the <HI>Inward
Token,</HI> the <HI>Assurance,</HI> the <HI>Testimony!</HI>—If you
are not <HI>positive,</HI> my Friends, Ye are <HI>DOUBTERS:</HI> And <HI>He
who doubteth,</HI> (says <HI>Holy Writ</HI>) <HI>is Damn'd.</HI>)—Mark
<HI>That,</HI> Brethren!—<HI>He, who doubt∣eth, is damn'd!</HI></P>
<P> AH weigh this important Question, be∣fore I lead you a Step
farther. Knock, at your Bosoms. Ask your Consciences, If ye are
<HI>Doubters?</HI> And, if ye find, ye are <HI>Upright,</HI> and
<HI>Stedfast,</HI>—If ye have clear, and unquestioned,
Evidence:—If your Lives have been <HI>Pure</HI>; and your Bodies
<HI>Undefiled.</HI>—Your <HI>Credentials</HI> for <HI>Heaven,</HI> are
Good;—and ye may follow <HI>me,</HI> un∣dauntedly;—for 
<Q>Nildesperandum est Teucro Duce, &amp; Auspice
Teucro,</Q> (That is, (being interpreted) 
<Q>King <HI>GEORGE</HI> for Ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P> BUT, If you <HI>doubt,</HI> If ye Faint, If your Inward Man is
not Strong,—I desire none none of your fruitless Aid.—I shall
be more Triumphant without Ye. Neither <PB N="116" REF="117"/> would I have your
Blood upon my Head; since, if ye <HI>die,</HI> you will be
<HI>damn'd.</HI>—But my <HI>Christian</HI> Concern for your
<HI>Souls,</HI> hath made me forget that ye are <HI>Soldiers.</HI>—I come
down, to put my self before you, and let you see, by my Example, in the
hor∣rid Bloodinesses of this Day, What an As∣surance there is in the
<HI>Accepted,</HI> when they fight against the <HI>Doubtful.</HI>—I
leave the Rest to your Consciences. They, who <HI>doubt not,</HI> will
follow me.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Mr. <HI>PLAIN DEALER,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I COMMENCED <HI>TOAST,</HI> about the Beginning of Last
Season; and among some <HI>Six Dozen</HI> of Lovers, (who could, All,
<HI>see,</HI> as clearly as any Old <HI>Cynick,</HI> in <PB N="117" REF="118"/> <HI>England</HI>) I never heard it observ'd, That <HI>Black
Eyes</HI> were <HI>Jack o' Lanthorns,</HI> 'till I read it, in your <HI>PAPER,
Number</HI> lxviii.—I must needs tell you, I don't <HI>like</HI> some
Things, in That <HI>PAPER</HI>: And, in Par∣ticular I make War against your
odious Partiality, in preferring a <HI>Musty Jyngle,</HI> of and old
<HI>Cardinal,</HI> and Queen <HI>DIDO,</HI> to one of the prettiest, and
wittiest, Copies of Verses, that ever was seen or heard of!</P>
<P> WOU'D, I knew where to find That Dear! Genteel! Gay! Spritely!
Charming! <HI>Spanish</HI> POET, who was Author of the Verses, to which you
have done the Honour of finding Fault with them, for no Reason in the World,
but because they were made upon <HI>Black Eyes!</HI>—I can't help
fancying, That you have, <HI>not only Grey Hair,</HI> but White Eye-brows, with
a Whey-coloured, Fat Face; and a sower, freckly Forehead, with a pale,
deadish, Look, as <HI>limy,</HI> and as <HI>wall-ey'd,</HI> as one of the
Watch-Towers of your own <HI>Barbican!</HI>—Never go about to deny
it;—for I am as sure, that it is so, as if I had been acquainted with
you these Sixty Years. And I will never believe to the contrary, unless you
get some Body to draw your Picture, after the <HI>Life,</HI> and have it Cut
upon a Copper-Plate, to hang up like a Sign, at the Head of your PLAIN DEALERS,
for the Entertainment of your <HI>Female Readers,</HI> in Place of your
imperti∣nent <HI>Motto's.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="118" REF="119"/> 
<L>I know, too well, my cruel Fair</L> 
<L>Why those Sweet <HI>Eyes</HI> have <HI>Sable</HI> Covers</L>

<L>Mere <HI>Pity</HI> bids 'em <HI>Mourning</HI> wear,</L> 
<L>To grieve the <HI>Fate</HI> of Murder'd Lovers.</L></Q>
<P>WELL-BRED! Transporting, Creature!—What Woman cou'd look
with <HI>Frowns,</HI> upon a Lover, that could lay her <HI>Eyes</HI> under
such delightful Obigation!</P>

<P> CALL you <HI>This,</HI> FALSE WIT?—I had always an
Aversion to a <HI>Critick,</HI> from my Cradle: But from this Time forward, I
shall never endure the <HI>Name</HI> of him: And, if ever I should so
<HI>lose my Way,</HI> as to fall in∣to the Company of one of them, my
<HI>Eyes would ake,</HI> at the very Sight of them.</P>
<P> MY Grandmother, at her Country-house, has an overgrown,
<HI>old Turkey Cock,</HI> that is the <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> of the
Family.—He could never abide <HI>Red,</HI> because it is the
prettiest of all Colours; and therefore I bought me a <HI>Pink-colour
Damask</HI> Suit, and carried it down, with me, on purpose to shake in the
old Gentleman's Eyes, and set him a <HI>fretting,</HI> by Way of
Diversi∣on.—I have search'd, the whole Town over, for an Opportunity
to deal with <HI>You,</HI> as I did your <HI>Brother SURLY,</HI> in the 
<PB N="119" REF="120"/> Country: And, at last, I met with the en∣clos'd Copy
of Verses, at an ASSEMBLY, where <HI>Eyes</HI> of all Colours, <HI>Black,
Blue, Grey</HI> and <HI>Hazel</HI>;—Nay, even the <HI>Green</HI> and the
<HI>Yellow,</HI> agreed to <HI>smile,</HI> with Approba∣tion, on the
<HI>Wit,</HI> and the <HI>Subject.</HI> And, because I would
<HI>mortifie</HI> you, I send you, What <HI>others</HI> have been
<HI>charm'd</HI> by: And as far as all good Offices, of this kind, shall
remain, very heartily,</P>

<P>RESERVING, 'till another Opportunity, What I have to say,
against NIGRELLA<HI>'s Eyes,</HI> and her <HI>Pink-colour Damask
Petticoat,</HI> I shall satisfie my self, (for present Vengeance) with
<HI>admiring, as much as she does,</HI> the Verses, which she sent, to
<HI>mortifie</HI> me.—How will she be able to support this
Disappointment?—Nay, to nettle her still further, I admire, very
much, too, the Lady, on whom the Verses were made; and I have even heard it
affirm'd, by as many Men, as there are Lines, in the Poem, That NIGRELLA<HI>'s
Eyes</HI> are no more to be compar'd with <HI>that Lady's,</HI> than Her
<HI>Spanish Poet's</HI> Verses are as Good as This Gentleman's.</P>
<P>BUT, because I would not be behind-hand with NIGRELLA, in a
Readiness to <HI>oblige,</HI> I will, in Return for her Entertaining me, at
so agreeable a <HI>Wedding,</HI> invite Her to a <HI>Funeral,</HI> which we
owe to the same Hand.—She may come, without new-dressing her 
<PB N="122" REF="123"/> <HI>Eyes,</HI> since they <HI>wear Mounring,</HI>
already.—But, (which will go very hard, with a Lady of so lively a
Temper!) She must lay aside Her Favourite <HI>Pink Colour,</HI> and set
her Face, to <HI>look sadly.</HI></P>
<P>TO close, in a more serious Strain,—The following
Verses, and the foregoing, are the Work of a <HI>North-British Muse,</HI>
and have, for their Author, the young Gentleman, who writ the <HI>ODE, On the
Power of Musick.</HI>—It will be needless to point out to the
<HI>Reader,</HI> The unusual Excellence of these Two Peices. They both
abound with the True, and Su∣blime, Poetick Spirit! And the Subjects are so
diametrically Opposite, to Each other, That to place them, thus,

1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>AMONG the Beauties of Magnanimi∣ty, there is none, of a nobler
Quality, than the Power of <HI>forgiving Injuries.</HI>—It throws a
Majesty over the <HI>Mind,</HI> and illustrates the <HI>Person,</HI> with
an Air of Sweetness, and Serenity.—We ought the more to admire it,
since, where-ever it is found, It is in Com∣pany with the <HI>Sublimest
Virtues:</HI> There not being <HI>Room</HI> for it, in a narrow, vulgar,
<HI>Soul</HI>; because, overfill'd with Little Senti∣ments, such as have
their Rise, and Revolu∣tion, within the Circle of
<HI>Self-Interest.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Brutal Passion of REVENGE, and a malicious Memory, for
<HI>Mischief,</HI> is become so Shameless, and Licentious, that it is
com∣mon to hear Resolutions of retain'd Malice avow'd, coldly, and in general
Expressions, Such as, <HI>Setting upon People's Skirts,—Finding a
Time to be Even with them,</HI>—and the like malignant, silly,
Phrases, whereby the Burn∣ings <PB N="125" REF="126"/> of an inward Hatred
seem to struggle, for Eruption.</P>
<P>METHINKS, a sufficient Fortification, against so abject a
Frailty, might be drawn from such Natural Reflections, as
These;—That, <HI>In violently returning Wrongs,</HI> we do Nothing but
what <HI>Beasts</HI> can do, more rea∣dily.—That, in <HI>Malice,</HI>
the most Exalted <HI>Noble,</HI> is but on a Level with the Lowest
<HI>Slave:</HI> Whereas, to <HI>Pardon,</HI> is an Act of <HI>Sovereignty</HI>;
and, however <HI>Inferior</HI> we were, <HI>before,</HI> to the Person, who
has injured us, From the Moment, in which we <HI>forgive him,</HI> we exchange
Conditions, and become <HI>Su∣perior.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, since many, who have no Ambition to be thought Men of
<HI>Virtue,</HI> would, yet, gladly, be esteemed <HI>Wise,</HI> It may be
an Ar∣gument, of more <HI>Perswasion,</HI> That This Propensity to
<HI>Revenge</HI> is a Mark, not of <HI>Mean-Spiritedness</HI> only, but of
<HI>Ignorance.</HI>—The Man of Knowledge can never be enough surpriz'd,
at Common Wrongs, to be inflam'd into a Resentment, either too Malicious, or
too Violent.—His Wisdom has instructed him, That where-ever we find
<HI>Men,</HI> we shall be sure to find <HI>Injuries:</HI> And, That there
is a Necessity of its being so, from the incompa∣tible, and opposite,
Wills, Humours, and Interests, among Mankind.</P>
<P>SHOU'D the Treacherous, the Suspicious, the Covetous, the
Insolent, or the Reproach∣ful, behave themselves otherwise than we 
<PB N="126" REF="127"/> could have expected, from their Natures, we might be
justified, in our <HI>Wonder</HI> at it.—But, why should we express
Amazement at what it was natural for us to depend on? Why be <HI>Angry</HI>
with the <HI>Inconsiderable?</HI>—Most of Those, who provoke, and
offend us, deserve rather our Grief, and Pity; For They are no more in their
own Hands, than a <HI>Mad∣man,</HI> or an <HI>Ideot,</HI> is: And we make a
poorer Figure than our Pride allows us to <HI>believe,</HI> when we disquiet
our selves, on such weak Motives.—When a <HI>Fool</HI> throws a
<HI>Straw</HI> at us, It were to seem <HI>light,</HI> to feel the Weight of
it: And <HI>He</HI> will never enjoy <HI>Rest,</HI> who is not Master of
Resolution to <HI>forgive</HI> All Those Injuries, which his Honour, or his
Safety, does not <HI>compel</HI> him to defend himself against.</P>
<P>NEITHER is there only a Wisdom, and a Nobleness;—There
is something, too, of a generous <HI>Courage,</HI> in a Heart, that is above
the Reach of these vindictive Impres∣sions.—The Levity, that is
shewn, in be∣ing moved, at every Trifle, carries with it an Air of
Faintness, and may be mistaken for <HI>Pusila<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ity.</HI> For, the firm, and manly,
Tem∣per, apprehending Nothing, with <HI>Fear,</HI> re∣ceives all Accidents,
with <HI>Calmness:</HI> And, justly conscious of its Strength, to
support it self, against Danger, is Indifferent to the In∣discretions,
or Animosities, of malignant Na∣tures.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="128"/>THERE is a single, heroick, <HI>Word,</HI>
in the History of the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Adrian,</HI> which I could never
read, without Emotions of the highest Admiration; and, which carries in it
the Instruction, and Sublimity, of many Vo∣lumes!—After That
Great-Spirited Prince became possessed of the Empire, He met a
Person, in the publick Way, who had been his most implacable, and bitter,
Enemy.—The Wretch, whose Heart was as <HI>contracted,</HI> as His
Malice had been <HI>extensive,</HI> began to tremble, with Expectation of
some severe, and sudden, Punishment,—such as, He knew, He
would, Himself, have inflicted on <HI>Adrian,</HI> had the Emperor's Power
been <HI>His.</HI> But <HI>Adrian,</HI> with the serenest Gravity, only
whisper'd, as He pass'd him, <HI>EVASISTI—You have Escap'd
me.</HI></P>
<P>ALL, that <HI>Largeness of Soul</HI> could inspire, or
Eloquence adorn, and utter, seems to have been express'd, in this
<HI>ESCAP'D ME!</HI>—It laid open, to the View of the World, the Mighty
Heart of it's Great Speaker!—It declared him nobly sensible, That
<HI>Justice</HI> would look like <HI>Malice,</HI> should He, now, when at
the Head of Empire, re∣venge, upon a Private Enemy, the Contempt, He met with,
while a Subject!—That very <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Command of
Punishment,</HI> which sordid Natures would have used, with
Gree∣diness, to the Destruction of the Man they hated,
<HI>restrained,</HI> and <HI>temper'd,</HI> His Resent∣ment!—He
considered Himself, as no longer <PB N="128" REF="129"/> on a <HI>Level</HI>
with his Injurer. The <HI>Protection,</HI> which he owned his <HI>Subject,</HI>
disarmed the Hatred which he bore his <HI>Enemy!—You have
escaped,</HI> (He meant to say, in That sig∣nificant, single, Word!)
<HI>You have escaped, by my becoming your MASTER, the Vengeance which you
should have felt, from me, had, I continued, but, your EQUAL.—That</HI>
ADRIAN <HI>is, now, no more, from whom you could not have expected Mercy; And
This</HI> ADRIAN, <HI>who gives you Pardon, owes Com∣passion to His
offending Subjects, and remembers none of the</HI> Other<HI>'s
Injuries</HI>!</P>
<P>IT is impossible, but a Collection of such amiable Examples
as This, enforced, by some perswasive Pen, must work strongly upon
the Minds of Men, not depraved into utter Tastlessness: For, by
striking, even, <HI>Little Hearts,</HI> with a clear Conviction, That the
<HI>Precept</HI> contains Nothing, but what has been exceeded in the
<HI>Practice,</HI> It would leave them no Pretence for Evasion; and
insinuate, by a gradual Progress, out of their Memory, into their
Imitation.</P>
<P>BUT Nothing furnishes more Occasion for Surprize, and
Indignation, than to ob∣serve our Places of Publick Worship, filled with
<HI>Outside Formalists,</HI> of all Ranks, and of both Sexes; who, either
with an impious <HI>Hypocrisy,</HI> or a <HI>Stupidity,</HI> as dark as
<HI>Ideotism,</HI> affront the Majesty of Heaven, by petition∣ing
<HI>GOD</HI>'s <HI>Pardon,—as They, Themselves, pardon Others.</HI>
While, at the very Moment <PB N="129" REF="130"/> of their Kneeling, in this
empty Mockery of Devotion, It is known, to one Half the Congregation, That the
Hearts of the other Half are imbitter'd with malicious Purposes, and glowing
with a painful Restlessness, till they can be revenged, for, some
slight Indig∣nity.—Could These People have a Sense of the
Signification of the Words they utter, They would tremble at the Apprehension
of having What they pray for, <HI>granted, literally</HI>; and the Mercy of
That dreadful GOD they dare to trifle with, <HI>refused,</HI> to their
Unwor∣thiness, till they have learnt as readily to <HI>for∣give,</HI> as to
<HI>pray to be forgiven.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, exclusive of those severer Arguments, which might be
drawn from <HI>Grace,</HI> and <HI>Vir∣tue,</HI> There is <HI>One,</HI> which
<HI>must</HI> be welcome; because we, all, agree to <HI>love
ourselves;</HI> and no Enemy is so Troublesome, as <HI>Malice</HI> to our
<HI>Pride,</HI> our <HI>Health,</HI> and our <HI>Quiet.</HI>—We submit
our selves, by this unmanly Passion, to the Humours of the Men we
hate.—We empower them to afflict, and mortifie, us.—At the Sight of
a Person, against whom we meditate Revenge, our Spirits undergo a
Tempest: And, even when he is absent, our Memory goads, and tortures
us.—Our very Dreams become imbitter'd, and confound our <HI>Rest,</HI>
with our <HI>Disquiet.</HI>—We wish the Evil to Another; but we
in∣flict it on our Selves: And, contrary to our own Intention, become
<HI>Patients,</HI> where we design to be <HI>Agents.</HI>—The Revenger
lives <PB N="130" REF="131"/> in Torment, and He, on whom He would be revenged,
is at Ease.</P>
<P>IT is a grinding, gnawing, Passion, that preys inward, upon
the Heart, and mistakes the <HI>Means</HI> of its own
<HI>Purpose.</HI>—What Triumph can <HI>Revenge</HI> afford us, but from
a Reflexion, That the Person punished, repents, and wishes the Wrong
unacted? This End can never be obtain'd by <HI>Mischiefs</HI>; for, by
provoking <HI>new</HI> Malice, they make the Me∣mory of the <HI>old</HI>
delightful: But it may be nobly effected, by astonishing, disgracing, and
confounding an Enemy, with <HI>Benefits</HI> in re∣turn for his
<HI>Demerit.</HI> And This is what the most Venerable of all Books very
strongly ex∣presses, by <HI>heaping Coals of Fire, on His Head:</HI> That
is, It burns, and wounds, his Imagina∣tion, with a conscious Shame, at his
<HI>Inferior Figure,</HI> while He sees himself disgraced, by Services
from That Person, of all the World, whom he least deserved to be obliged
by!—The stubborn Virtue of <HI>CATO,</HI> would have allowed him to
submit to <HI>CAESAR</HI>; but that his <HI>Pride</HI> was more afraid of a
<HI>Par∣don,</HI> than his <HI>Person</HI> was of an <HI>Insult.</HI></P>
<P>MEN of Spirit shou'd <HI>despise</HI> this Passion,
because it is evident, That the <HI>weakest</HI> Minds are most
malicious, and revengeful.—Children, Women, and Men, less resolute
than Women, sting, and fret themselves with sense of Slights,
Contempts, and Follies, which they mis-call Injuries; while the
<HI>Ra∣tional,</HI> and <HI>Stedfast</HI> Mind neglects, or smiles 
<PB N="131" REF="132"/> at, all such Accidents.—Their Effects may
flutter round him; but, when they find no Place, to enter at, are
<HI>lost,</HI> in fruitless Murmurings; like a Tempest, that is
re∣puls'd, against the Firmness of a Moun∣tain.—The <HI>Distasts,
Aspersions,</HI> and <HI>In∣dignities,</HI> which appear so formidable,
to an Abject Nature, may be compared with Thunder and Lightning; which are
<HI>terrible,</HI> to our <HI>Lower World,</HI> but have nothing in them, worth
the Notice of those Angels, and superior Spirits, which inhabit the
<HI>Caele∣lestial</HI> Regions.—<HI>SCIPIO, CAESAR, ALEXANDER</HI>; All
the Great and Shining Characters, which have made Anti∣quity Illustrious,
have been so far from stoop∣ing, to indulge <HI>Revenge,</HI> that, on the
con∣trary, they have sought Occasions, to over∣whelm, with <HI>torturing
Kindnesses,</HI> the most malicious, of their Personal Enemies.</P>
<P>BUT, a Mixture of <HI>Shade,</HI> with <HI>Light,</HI> being
necessary, to compleat a Picture, I will set them off, by one another, in
a Comparison, between a MONARCH and a MINISTER; out of <HI>Mirkond,</HI> a
<HI>Persian</HI> Writer.</P>
<Q> A POET whose Name was <HI>Delah,</HI> at∣tracted by the Fame of
<HI>Ogtai-Khan</HI>'s Munificence, undertook a Journey, on foot, from the
remotest Parts of <HI>Tartary,</HI> as far as to That Prince's Court, in
<HI>China,</HI> for no other Purpose, than to throw him∣self 
<PB N="132" REF="133"/> at the Foot of his Throne, and im∣plore his
Assistance, to discharge a Debt, of <HI>Five Hundred Balisches,</HI>
under the Weight of which he became dispirited, and was interrupted, in his
Studies.—The Generous Prince, conversing with him, and discerning his
Extraordinary Merit, enter∣tain'd him very graciously, and order'd him <HI>a
Thousand.</HI>—His Chief Minister re∣monstrated, That this was
rather <HI>Prodiga∣lity,</HI> than <HI>Bounty,</HI> to give <HI>Double</HI> the
Sum demanded!—<HI>Have you not consider'd,</HI> re∣ply'd Ogtai-Khan,
<HI>That the Poor Man has travell'd over the Mountains, and Desarts, merely
on the Fame of our Liberality? And, shou'd we send him back with no more,
than is just sufficient to pay his Debts, by what Means will he be able to
Defray the Charges of his Journey?</HI> But your Highness, (answer'd the
Minister) has not, yet, been inform'd, That he presum'd to write a
<HI>Satyr,</HI> against <HI>ME,</HI> since his coming hither, because I
was unwilling to allow him Access, with so im∣pertinent a
Petition!—<HI>For which Reason,</HI> reply'd the Prince) <HI>You
shall present him with another Thousand</HI> out of your own Pri∣vate
Purse, <HI>That he may go back, and tell his Countrymen, there is a Monarch,
in this part of the World, who permits not his MINISTERS's RESENTMENTS to be
the Measures of his Bounty.</HI></Q>
<P><PB N="133" REF="134"/>JUST half as good a Story we read, of
<HI>Queen Elizabeth,</HI> and <HI>our Spencer</HI>; She had order'd him a
<HI>Hundred Marks,</HI> for some Piece of his Poetry: But the Frugal
<HI>Treasurer,</HI> of those Days, whose <HI>Wit</HI> was too Little, for
his <HI>Wisdom,</HI> took upon him to tell the <HI>Queen</HI> it was too much
Money for an <HI>Idle Ballad.</HI>—Give him, then, said She, what you
think he deserves, <HI>in Reason.</HI>—He reply'd, <HI>he would
consider of it</HI>; which he delay'd to do, so long, that, at last, he
quite forgot it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Queen,</HI> a Year or two after, din'd, in one of her
<HI>Progresses,</HI> at the House of a Gentleman, where <HI>Spencer</HI>
happen'd to be; who, in Presence of his Friend, the <HI>Treasurer,</HI> put

<L>To have Reason, for my Rhime:</L>

<L>I have had nor Rhime nor Reason.</L></Q>
<P>THE <HI>Queen</HI> (says the Story) was highly pleas'd with the
Humour, and commanded the <HI>Treasurer</HI> to pay him Double the Sum,
first order'd.—Had She added, That he shou'd pay it <HI>out of his
own Private Purse,</HI> we shou'd have found no Occasion to mend her
deficient Example, by a Better, in that of <HI>Ogtai-Khan,</HI> just
mention'd.</P>

<P><HI>MAHOMET</HI> the IId, That victorious <HI>Turkish</HI>
Emperor, who took <HI>Constantinople</HI> from the Christians, had a very
great Genius for Poetry, and was so warm in its Encourage∣ment, that He is
reported to have offer'd Re∣wards, for every <HI>Fault,</HI> that cou'd be
pointed out, in the Works of his <HI>Court Poets,</HI> and made Good against
the Arguments, which shou'd be brought, in Favour of the Defendants.</P>
<P>HEAVEN be prais'd, That His Majesty of <HI>GREAT BRITAIN</HI>
has no such partial Opinion of the Poets of our Age, and Coun∣try! Such a
Proclamation wou'd drain his Exchequer, more effectually than a Ten Years
<HI>War,</HI> with the strongest Power of <HI>Europe!</HI></P>
<P>BUT, I believe, we may live at Ease: The Encouragement of the
Poet's Art, in this present Generation, will occasion no Pro∣fuseness,
that can be dangerous to the Reve∣nue. <PB N="135" REF="136"/> And, as for our
<HI>Great Men,</HI> They are <HI>Patrons,</HI> for the most Part, as They are
<HI>Doctors,</HI> and <HI>Masters of Art,</HI> rather by Acci∣dent, than by
Purpose; and think themselves under no Obligation to <HI>pay for</HI>
Compliments which their Conscience tells them, They have <HI>No Right
to.</HI></P>
<P>THE Truth is, when Any Thing, so Ex∣traordinary, falls out, as,
That A Man of Quality is Witty Himself, and an Encou∣rager of Wit, in Others;
The Poets are so Unmerciful, in their Assaults on his Libe∣rality, That
His Equals, in Dignity, have found much Safety and Comfort, in the Fame of
<HI>Dullness.</HI> And there never was a livelier Proof of the Soundness of
That Common Maxim, that <HI>Honesty is the best Policy</HI>; than the
Success of the fashionable Expedient, (at once so frank, and so
ingenious!) of return∣ing the Dedicator's Gilt Book, with this short Apology
for not accepting it—<HI>My Lord gives his Service, and says, He does
not UNDERSTAND these Matters.</HI></P>
<P>FOR Want of some such dext'rous <HI>Stroke of Art,</HI> The
Grandees, of That <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperor's Court, whom I nam'd, at the Head
of my Paper, were, often, reduc'd to a <HI>Nonplus.</HI> It was, particularly,
the Case of <HI>Ali-Basha,</HI> His Favourite <HI>Treasurer.</HI> He had
learnt to <HI>Read,</HI> and <HI>cast Accompts</HI>; But <HI>Wit</HI> being
<HI>out of his Way,</HI> He had one, regular, Method of re∣warding All who
address'd their Writings to Him: He put the Book into one Scale, and 
<PB N="136" REF="137"/> dropt Gold into another, and, having <HI>adjusted the
Balance,</HI> gave the <HI>Weight</HI> of the Work, as a Gratuity, to the
Author.—The worst Effect of this General Rule was, That it was common
for the <HI>lightest Discourses</HI> to bring with them the
<HI>heaviest Bindings.</HI> There was nothing, more <HI>Substantial</HI>
than the <HI>Covers</HI> of this Great Patron's Books!—But one Poet,
above the Rest, had contriv'd a pleasant Scheme, to make the most of his
Ingenuity. He compos'd a Copy of Verses; and, instead of <HI>Writing</HI>
them, in the usual Manner, caus'd them to be <HI>Engrav'd</HI> on a Block of
<HI>Marble,</HI> that was large enough for a <HI>Tomb∣stone!</HI>—He
loaded a Cart with his Compli∣ment, and went to wait on the Basha with it;
who, having Notice of his intended Present, sent out the Master of his
Buildings, to examine the Size, and Workmanship, of the Stone, and pay for
it, according to its Value—The Poet went away very much surpriz'd, and
dissatisfy'd, and writ his Patron a Com∣plaint, How contrary to His
<HI>Greatness</HI>'s Cu∣stom, His Officers had presum'd to Treat him: To
which the <HI>Basha</HI> answer'd, gravely, That <HI>it arose, from a
Change, in His Manner;—For, whereas he had, formerly, reward∣ed, by
WEIGHT, He shou'd, hereafter, do it, by MEASURE.</HI></P>
<P>WE have <HI>some,</HI> among our Nobility, who are equally
Illustrious for their <HI>Learning,</HI> and their <HI>Patronage</HI> of
Learning: But they are so <HI>Poetically persecuted,</HI> by the Swarms of
Little <PB N="137" REF="138"/> Creatures, who have no End, in Writing, but the
Profit they propose to draw from it, That they meet with daily Provocations
to repel the Avarice of Flattery, with a Spirit, and Sharpness, like the
<HI>Basha's,</HI> above-men∣tion'd: And, This, no Doubt, is one Reason for
the Neglect, which <HI>Works of Genius</HI> often meet with, when address'd
to Men of Quality.</P>
<P>BUT, if Contempt is due to the <HI>Merce∣nary,</HI> The
<HI>Modest</HI> deserve Encouragement: And They, who are truly Generous,
shou'd never wait, till Occasion offers it self; but seek, and make,
the Opportunity. For, as the Sharpness of our <HI>Sight</HI> is best prov'd
by the <HI>Remoteness,</HI> in which we distinguish Ob∣jects; so our
<HI>Judgment</HI> appears, most strongly, when we discern Merit at
<HI>Distance,</HI> and <HI>invite</HI> it, to aproach us.</P>
<P>I AM always pleas'd with the Prospect of Any Work, from which
the <HI>Publick</HI> may promise It self, either Entertainment, or
In∣struction: And I hope, The Gentleman, who has sent me the following
Verses, and Letter, will have no Reason to complain of the Recep∣tion, His

<P> THE Enclosed is <HI>one</HI> Copy of Verses, of a great
Number, which my Friends have been kind enough to savour me with, in Order to
furnish out a <HI>Collection of Miscel∣laneous POEMS</HI>: Concerning
which, you may, possibly, have met with a Proposal in the Hands of some
of your Acquaintance, for their being <HI>publish'd, by Subscription,</HI>
in the Name of <HI>Richard Savage,</HI> Son of the late <HI>Earl
Rivers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140"/> I AM, Sir, That unfortunate <HI>Richard
Savage;</HI> the peculiar Circumstances of whose uncommon Treatment, from a
Mother (whose fine Qualities make it impossible to me <HI>not to forgive
her,</HI> even, while I am <HI>miserable, by Her Means, only</HI>) induced
You, some Months since, in your <HI>Twenty Eighth Paper,</HI> to publish
a Few ineffectual Lines, which I had written, on Her surpriz∣ing Usage of
me: To which your Huma∣nity was pleas'd to add certain Reflections, in my
Favour, which I remember with due Gratitude; and am encouraged, by That
Instance of your Goodness, to make the present Application.</P>
<P> WHEN you shall have perused my Extra∣ordinary
<HI>Case,</HI> and Those convincing <HI>Origi∣nal Letters,</HI> which I
have entrusted with the Gentleman, who brings you This, I shall need say
no more, to satisfie You, What <HI>Right</HI> I have, to <HI>complain,</HI>
in a more <HI>Publick Manner,</HI> than I have, yet, allowed my self to
resolve on.—The <HI>Papers,</HI> in the Order you will see them, are
prepared for a Hand, too <HI>Just,</HI> and too <HI>Powerful,</HI> to to
leave me the least Distrust of being, shortly, <HI>less oppressed
than I have been:</HI> But I judged my self obliged to lay them under
<HI>your</HI> Eye, That you might be sensible, you said less, of my
<HI>Wrongs,</HI> and my <HI>Suf∣ferings,</HI> than the unhappy <HI>Truth</HI>
could have justified.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="141"/> AS to the mentioned <HI>Collection
of</HI> POEMS, They are, some of 'em my own: But many more the Works of
Eminent Hands, for the most Part, never before publish'd.—The
<HI>Subscription</HI> will be <HI>Half a Guinea:</HI> And, as I can
sollicite Nothing, with <HI>Im∣portunity,</HI> in which (tho' a <HI>small
one)</HI> I have a visible <HI>Interest,</HI> my Subscribers will be only
Those, who, if They think They see any Thing, in <HI>me,</HI> or in my
<HI>Design,</HI> worth their Notice, or Encouragement, can have Generosity
enough to save me the Confu∣sion of <HI>applying to them,</HI> and send
their <HI>Names,</HI> and the Number of Books they subscribe for, to
<HI>Button</HI>'s <HI>Coffee-House,</HI> in <HI>Covent-Garden</HI>; where
Receipts will be given.</P>
<P> THE <HI>Book</HI> is now in the Press, and will be
published, as soon as it can be <HI>printed off.</HI>—If you find,
among the <HI>Poems,</HI> which my Friend has desir'd he may shew you, What

</LETTER>
<P>I HAVE, purposely, <HI>left out,</HI> much of This ingenious,
and unhappy, Gentleman's Letter, which was very new, and surpriz∣ing; and
affected me with the most touching Grief.—If I apprehend His Case
clearly <PB N="141" REF="142"/> (and the Proofs He sent me, are too
<HI>strong,</HI> to be easily mistaken) It is, in some Mea∣sure, to
be considered, as <HI>That of an Injured Nobleman,</HI>—But of This,
the World will judge, for it self, when the Particulars shall be more
publick,—<HI>That</HI> is His <HI>own</HI> imme∣diate <HI>Concern,</HI>
and will, I suppose, be His <HI>own Care:</HI>—But His
<HI>Proposal</HI> is What <HI>Every Body</HI> ought to take Part in;
because the Book, in itself, has a very uncommon Merit: And Both
<HI>Merit,</HI> and <HI>Ill-Fortune,</HI> join, to recommend the
Proposer.</P>
<P>I THINK it was finely said, by a Gentle∣man, whose Writings,
and Humanity, were, for many Years, the Admiration of the
King∣dom.—<HI>That it ought to be the Care of All, in whose Power it
lay, to lift Mr.</HI> SAVAGE <HI>above a Sense of his</HI> MOTHER<HI>'s
Cruelty; because a Misery, so undeserved, had intitled him to a Right
of finding Every Good Man his</HI> FATHER.</P>
<P>BUT, when, to a <HI>Misery so undeserved,</HI> we add a
<HI>Design, so full of Reason,</HI> It is impossible, but there
must be <HI>Many,</HI> who will feel a noble Delight, in distinguishing
their Zeal, for so modest a Proposer; and send their own Names, and
Those of Others, whom they can Influence, as so many <HI>Examples,</HI>
when the <HI>List</HI> comes to be publish'd, That we have Spirits, who can
discover <HI>Genius,</HI> before it rises into <HI>Noise</HI>: and dare
promote it, without <HI>waiting</HI> till the <HI>Way has been led, by
Others.</HI></P>

<P>MY Devotion, I am afraid, is not so <HI>Pure,</HI> and
<HI>Simple,</HI> as it ought to be. There is a <HI>Niceness,</HI> in my
Taste of other People's Behaviour, at Church, which ill agrees with the Duty,
which I my self am there, for the Discharge of.</P>
<P>I discovered this Defect of <HI>Grace</HI> in the Constitution
of my Zeal, by a kind of Re∣probate <HI>Contempt,</HI> which I found my self
affected by, last <HI>Sunday,</HI> against that plain, and humble,
Aukwardness, with which the mangled <HI>Psalms</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> were
vociferated, by the Congregation.—A Gentleman, of my Acquaintance,
unluckily whispered me, (in the midst of what they call their
<HI>Singing</HI>) That he knew a <HI>Dutch</HI> Painter, who had drawn the
liveliest <HI>Grotesque</HI> Piece, in <HI>Europe,</HI> by an Idea, that he
brought out of Church <PB N="143" REF="144"/> with him, from a Gallery of
<HI>Country Psalms-Singers.</HI></P>
<P>MY Eyes, and Ears, took his Hint; and I shall never forget the
<HI>Group</HI> of Living Ima∣gery!—The Rolling Eyes, Raised Faces,
Hanging Heads, Oblique Chins, Stretch'd Mouths, and Distorted
Muscles!—The <HI>Voi∣ces</HI> too were as provokingly dissonant, as
the <HI>Looks</HI> were ludicrously penitential!—Instead of finding
my Thoughts exalted, by the Spirit of transporting <HI>Harmony,</HI> I became
<HI>ashamed,</HI> at the presumptuous License, with which the
Coarsest, and most unskilful <HI>Roar∣ers</HI> took upon 'em to <HI>bear
Part,</HI> in Musick, Sacred to the Praises of the ALMIGHTY.</P>
<P>THIS brought to my Reflection, with how much Reason, as well as
Reverence, The <HI>Choirs</HI> of our <HI>Cathedral</HI> Churches preserve
the Dignity of their Religious Harmony, by <HI>ex∣cluding the Unskill'd</HI>;
and aiding the Attracted Heart, by all the sweet, and melting Force, of Vocal
and of Instrumental Musick; in its most moving Elegance, and
Perfection.</P>
<P>BUT, It is not only the Manner in which <HI>Psalms</HI> are
commonly sung, that I consider as an Indecency: The <HI>Psalms
Themselves,</HI> as we have them in the old <HI>English,</HI> Version,
are a Disgrace to our our Learning, Language, and our
Religion!—<HI>Who,</HI> that forms his Notion of <HI>David</HI>'s Genius,
from his Poetry, as This Translation gives it us, could possibly
<HI>believe</HI> Him the Sublimest, of All Human Writers? Who, that should
read these Lines, as they run, in the Exalted Original?</P>
<Q><PB N="144" REF="145"/> 
<L>Lord, Let not All, <HI>alike,</HI> Thy <HI>Mercy</HI>
share,</L> 
<L><HI>Strike</HI> the PRESUMPTUOUS, but the LOWLY
<HI>spare.</HI></L></Q>
<P>WHO, I say, could suppose He had <HI>found</HI> them, either
in the <HI>Sense,</HI> or the despicable <HI>Expression,</HI> of This,
which follows, from our Vulgar Version?</P>
<Q> 
<L>O Lord, then, be not Slack;</L> 
<L>Nor draw thy Hand <HI>a-back:</HI></L> 
<L>But pluck it forth, from out thy <HI>Lap,</HI></L> 
<L>And give thy Foes a RAP!</L></Q>
<P>THE <HI>Sectarians,</HI> who are (too frequently) exceeding Rigid,
and Narrow, in their Ad∣herence to imbib'd Prejudices, seem rather to affect,
than discourage, <HI>Cant</HI> and <HI>Dullness,</HI> in their Religious
Eloquence: And, it is a very <HI>Extraordinary</HI> Reason which some of
those Gentlemen have been pleased to give us, <HI>in Print,</HI> for the
want of Taste, and Incapa∣city, with which the Noblest, and most
Ele∣vated, Strokes of <HI>David</HI>'s Sacred Poetry, have been debased into
Low, and untune∣able Jargon;—<HI>God's Altars need none of our
Polishing!</HI> As, if to write poorly, were a <HI>Merit,</HI> in Religious
Treatises; and it were possible to find a Subject, more adapted to the
Fullness of Art, than the Praises of That GOD, who formed Both <HI>Art</HI>
and <HI>Nature!</HI></P>
<P>THERE is Nothing so Rapturous! No∣thing so strongly painted,
in all the noblest <PB N="145" REF="146"/> Warmths of Fancy, or of Judgment,
which have immortalized the Antient Poets, as most of the <HI>Hebrew</HI>
Descriptions of the Power, and Majesty of GOD! And, among These, The
CIVth <HI>Psalm,</HI> and especially the First Part of it, is a
Collection, in one View, of the most <HI>Dreadful</HI> and <HI>Amiable,</HI>
of the Almighty's Attributes: So glowingly conceived, and re∣presented in
such lively Fullness; that all the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin ODES,</HI>
are faint, and languid, in Comparison with it.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to <HI>Translate</HI> the Images of This
prodigious Poet, without doing them some Injustice: But, having lately been
pre∣sented with an Essay, upon the mentioned <HI>Psalm,</HI> in which
an Eye has been, Every where, kept to the <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Dignity</HI>
of the Original, rather than to its dead <HI>Letter,</HI> I will publish it,
as a Proof, That Nothing can be more unlike the Thoughts of <HI>David,</HI>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>MONDAY, <HI>December</HI> 7.
1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I DECLAR'D, in a late Paper, that my Speculations shou'd
sometimes, extend to <HI>Politicks.</HI> This Day's Entertainment shall be
an Introduction, to that Purpose; which I shall, occasionally, pursue,
with the open Spirit of a PLAIN DEALER: asserting, and making free with All
the <HI>Liberty</HI> I was <HI>born to:</HI>—A Liberty, which does not
alone in∣title us to a Property in our <HI>Estates,</HI> but in our
<HI>Thoughts</HI> also. It is the great Charecte∣ristick of every Free-born
<HI>Briton,</HI> That <HI>He may speak, as He thinks, and think, as He
pleases.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE, like the Provinces of the declin∣ing Empire of <HI>Old
Rome,</HI> we are fretting, and disturbing ourselves, (under the Notion of
<HI>Reason,</HI> and <HI>Principle)</HI> to support the factious Avarice of
a few aspiring Men, who find their Interest in our Divisions, the
<HI>GOTHS are at</HI> <PB N="150" REF="151"/> <HI>our Gate</HI>; and we are
apprehensive of no <HI>out∣ward</HI> Danger.—There seems to be
rising, near us, That NORTHERN LYON, which has, so often, been prophesied
of: And I believe, in the Course of my Papers, I shall make it
sufficiently visible, that, if early Measures are not taken, by Way of
<HI>Pre∣vention,</HI> against the threaten'd Evil, the UNIVERSAL EMPIRE,
which <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> have successively alarm'd
<HI>Europe</HI> with a fruitless Dread of, seems, in Reality, to be coming
upon us, with all the Terrors of a <HI>Fifth General Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>IF it is suppos'd, That such a Fear con∣cerns <HI>Us,</HI>
less than <HI>other States,</HI> which may be thought to lie more expos'd, I
doubt we deceive Our-selves, by a Vanity, common to all Nations, in
over-rating the <HI>Hazard</HI> of an Enemy, who shou'd presume to invade
us.—Our <HI>Ships,</HI> (powerful, and numerous, as they are) are more
formidable by the Re∣putation of their Terror, than by the Danger of their
Opposition. For, to expect that a <HI>Fleet</HI> will, at all Times, be able
to keep Danger at a Distance, were to give our <HI>Pro∣tection</HI> to the
<HI>Winds</HI>—How many <HI>Caveats,</HI> against so unstable a
Security, cannot our own History furnish us with?—Neither ought it to
be consider'd, as a Remote, or Chimerical, Prospect, <HI>That we may be
match'd in our Marine Pretensions</HI>—We cannot pos∣sibly have
more Advantage, in the Fame, and Practice, of Dominion at Sea, against 
<PB N="151" REF="152"/> any of our Cotemporary States, than the
<HI>Carthaginians</HI> had against the <HI>Romans:</HI> And the Success
which crown'd the Industry, and unconquerable Spirit, of these Last, in
De∣fiance of <HI>all</HI> Obstacles, as well of <HI>Nature,</HI> as of
<HI>Art,</HI> is a Lesson, which may may teach our Statesmen, That there
is infinite Diffe∣rence, between Things <HI>difficult,</HI> and Things
<HI>impossible.</HI></P>
<P>NOT to insist on, the memorable Sur∣prize, with which
<HI>France,</HI> in a few Years Application, convinc'd us, with how little
Reason we had indulg'd a Notion, <HI>That there were natural
Impossibilities to prevent that Great Nation from becoming Powerful, at
Sea;</HI> All which were found mere Shadows, when the Genius of her Ministers
turn'd their Thoughts on attempting it!—The prodi∣gious, and
enterprizing, Spirit of the present <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Russia</HI> has,
at once, establish'd, in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> a Third <HI>Maritime</HI>
Power, Supe∣riour to Both its old Ones: And, now, while I am Writing, has a
Fleet of Sixty <HI>Ships of the Line,</HI> besides
<HI>Frigates</HI>;—and <HI>Gallies</HI> without Number.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>natural</HI> Advantages, whether for <HI>building,
equipping,</HI> or <HI>maintaining</HI> a Navy, this Prince has the Start of
us, beyond all Comparison.—And since, when his Ships are as
<HI>Many,</HI> and as <HI>Strong,</HI> as ours, (which judging by what has been
done already, they may be, in Three or Four Years) our whole Pretence to
Superiority must be plac'd in our <PB N="152" REF="153"/> <HI>Skill,</HI> and
<HI>Experience,</HI> in Sea-Fights, how dangerous wou'd the Consequence be
found, shou'd he hit upon some New Method of <HI>improving his Vessels,
in their Strength, De∣fensive, or Offensive?</HI> Many High, and Ardu∣ous
Attempts toward which, have busied, some Years past, the unresting
Genius of that Monarch.</P>
<P>WITHIN the Memory of Numbers, yet living, the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> were consider'd, as a People, so far from
<HI>Dangerous,</HI> that they were even <HI>Contemptible:</HI> And the
precipitate Ad∣vance of their Reputation in Arms, and Po∣licy, is a Proof, that
no Vanity is more weak∣ly founded, and unjust, than the Common Practice of
all Nations, to esteem <HI>Themselves</HI> more <HI>Valiant</HI> than their
<HI>Neighbours.</HI>—Man∣kind is every where the <HI>same,</HI> by
Nature, till a <HI>Difference</HI> is produc'd, by Custom.—What Nation
<HI>braver,</HI> than the <HI>Persians</HI> un∣der <HI>Cyrus?</HI> Yet, what
Nation <HI>baser,</HI> when they oppos'd the Arms of
<HI>Alexander?</HI>—What People, under Heaven, have more in∣rich'd the
Histories of former Ages, than the Ancestors of those degenerate
<HI>Greeks,</HI> who are, now, the Disgrace of <HI>Christendom? Con∣tented
Slaves,</HI> under a Tyranny, a thousand Times more insupportable than the
worst of Those, in scorn of which their ancient Ora∣tors have fill'd the
World with Noisy Decla∣mations, in the boasted Cause of <HI>Liberty!
ITALY,</HI> the imperious Mistress of the Uni∣verse! has been
<HI>sunk,</HI> for many Ages; and <PB N="153" REF="154"/> parcell'd into
petty, and almost inconside∣rable, <HI>Jurisdictions!</HI>—And, to
bring the Proof quite <HI>Home,</HI> what People ever seem'd to hold a
clearer Superiority over their Enemies, than the <HI>English</HI> Armies,
which our <HI>First Edward,</HI> led to War against the <HI>Scots?</HI>
And, yet, what Truth more undeniable, than the shame∣ful <HI>Cowardice,</HI>
and downright <HI>Baseness,</HI> of the Sons of those very
<HI>English,</HI> drawn out, against the Sons of the same <HI>Scots,</HI>
in the next succeeding Reign of <HI>Edward the Second.</HI></P>
<P>COURAGE, when consider'd <HI>nationally,</HI> is not the Effect
of <HI>Nature,</HI> but of <HI>Discipline!</HI> Skill, and Practice, teaching
an Agility in the Use of Arms, excite a Pleasure in their Exercise: And,
abating, by Degrees, that Fear of Death, which is natural to all Men, convert
it into Hope of Victory; and a proud, and restless, Thirst of
Glory.—<HI>Arms</HI> there∣fore, and a dexterous Superiority in the Use
of them, should be esteemed the <HI>Sinews of War</HI>; and not MONEY, as
is, commonly, pretended.—An Army, capable of <HI>conque∣ring,</HI> will
always find Means of <HI>subsisting:</HI> But <HI>Money,</HI> though it
<HI>subsists</HI> an ill-discipli∣ned Army, can never qualifie it for
<HI>conque∣ring.</HI>—The Helpless <HI>Indians,</HI> of
<HI>Mexico,</HI> were infinitely <HI>Richer,</HI> than their
Plunderers,—the <HI>Goths,</HI> when (from that very Coun∣try, which the
<HI>Czar</HI> now governs) they over∣ran, and ruin'd <HI>Europe,</HI> brought
them only, <HI>Iron</HI>; they knew, <HI>That</HI> would make them Masters of
all the <HI>Gold,</HI> they should have Occasion for.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155"/>PRINCES, whose Authority is absolute,
and uncontroll'd, by <HI>Privileges, Rights,</HI> or <HI>Customs</HI>;
whose Dominions are vast, and po∣pulous, and whose Subjects are
laborious, hardy, and obedient; and acquainted with no <HI>Learning,</HI> but
what is sufficient to aid their Industry, without inflaming their
Pride.—Such Princes, become <HI>dreadful,</HI> as soon as they appear
<HI>ambitious,</HI> and exert themselves in Pre∣parations for
<HI>War.</HI>—But, when it happens, too, that a Prince, in so tempting
a Situa∣tion, has a Genius capable of <HI>Improving</HI> the Art-Military, It
is difficult to put <HI>Limits</HI> to the Consequences, which may attend His
Fortune.</P>
<P>THO' the Study of the <HI>Art of War</HI> has been carried to a
great Perfection, yet there is Room enough left to give Scope to the Force of
Genius, this Way: And it would, perhaps, be found, upon Trial, That the
<HI>Modern System,</HI> (notwithstanding the Use of <HI>Gunpowder,</HI>
which was unknown to the An∣cients) is as subject as the <HI>old</HI> was, to
be trampled on, and overpower'd, by some new, and unforeseen,
<HI>Discoveries,</HI> on those Sides, most especially, where we believe
ourselves securest.</P>
<P>THE <HI>measur'd Lines</HI> of Humane Foresight, which are,
so proudly distinguished, by the Name of <HI>Policy,</HI> are vain
Amusements, and mere <HI>Cobweb Subtleties.</HI>—Their narrow, busy,
Schemes, of <HI>balancing</HI> the Power, and Inte∣rests of Nations, are
often insufficient for the <PB N="155" REF="156"/> Purposes of their
Designers, because these High-way Statesmen <HI>found</HI> their Maxims
upon <HI>Error, in the first Concoction.</HI>—The <HI>Force</HI> of a
Prince is, by their Rule, to be calculated, from his <HI>Revenue,</HI> and his
<HI>Revenue,</HI> from the Wealth of his Subjects: But This Argument depends
intirely on the general, <HI>mistaken,</HI> Notion, <HI>That All Equal
Numbers, will be of Equal Weight, in War</HI>; which is so far from being
<HI>true,</HI> That, should the <HI>Poorest</HI> Prince in <HI>Europe,</HI>
fall upon the <HI>Richest,</HI> with a Skill in Arms, as much Superiour, as
He is <HI>Infe∣riour</HI> in his Numbers, the Disparity would be
<HI>revers'd,</HI> immediately.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Romans,</HI> who never <HI>conquer'd, in order to prolong
a War,</HI> but to make it bear its own Expences; and encrease, as well their
<HI>Treasury,</HI> as their <HI>Reputation,</HI> were so far from this new
Way, of computing an Ene∣my's <HI>Strength,</HI> by his <HI>Riches,</HI> that
Their Judgment was directly contrary. And this Opinion of Ancient Times appears
strongly in that magnanimous Answer, which was given by a <HI>Gaul,</HI> to
a King of <HI>Macedon,</HI> who shew'd him his Heaps of <HI>Gold,</HI> in
order to excite Terror; and, then, ask'd him, <HI>What He thought of His
Condition?</HI> The rugged Soldier reply'd, sharply, <HI>That as to what
con∣cern'd His Condition, a Stranger could be no Judge: But His</HI> BOUNTY,
<HI>He could perceive, Extraordinary,—since he had taken such
un∣usual Pains to let his Enemies be convinc'd, clearly, That his Kingdom was
worth their Conquering.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="157"/>WHERE a Prince is really
<HI>strong,</HI>—To be held <HI>Weak,</HI> in the Opinion of the World,
is rather a Benefit, than a Disadvantage.—His Preparations alarm no
Body; and the Blow, he designs to strike, will as soon be <HI>felt,</HI>
as <HI>apprehended:</HI> Whereas the Fame of Power, and Riches keeps Jealousy
awake; and attracts Envy, and Opposition, from all Quarters.—The
<HI>Fortune</HI> of the late <HI>French</HI> King had, possibly, kept Pace
with his <HI>Am∣bition,</HI> if it had not been watch'd, and check'd, upon this
single Consideration.—On the other Hand, <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI>
was so happily <HI>despis'd,</HI> by the <HI>Austrian Gran∣deur,</HI>
which took it for granted, according to the modern Reasoning, <HI>That the
Poverty of such an Invader would be a Curb to his Courage,</HI> that, boldly
entring <HI>Germany</HI> with an Army of but <HI>Seven Thousand Men,</HI> he
carried every Thing before him, like a Torrent; broke the whole Scheme of the
Emperor's Designs; and had ruin'd, in all Likelyhood, the Inte∣rest of that
Family, if he had not been <HI>kill'd,</HI> in the Battle of
<HI>Lutzen.</HI></P>
<P>DESIGNING, in some future <HI>Papers,</HI> to speak of Things,
a little out of the common Road, and draw Conclusions, which I judge too
<HI>new,</HI> to venture on, without a previous Notice, That I propose not to
deduce my Arguments from the Principles of <HI>Modern Politiques,</HI> and
therefore refuse to be try'd by them; I have, for that Reason, thought
necessary to publish these few General Reflections, as a Preparative,
for what I intend, hereafter, to consider, in a more distinct, and
peculiar, Manner.</P>

Instruction of the Lively <HI>Mrs. Laetitia Gambol!</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Sable <HI>Toasts</HI> of those Sunny Climates have such
<HI>Choice</HI> of Tempting Privileges, that I shall have Room, in this
Paper, to recommend but a very few of them: I will, therefore, select the
Best; and begin with this ARCH-CLAIM of <HI>Virginity, within the
Tropicks,</HI> that Girls, at Nine Years old, commence <HI>Women!</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Young Ladies,</HI> too, in most Places, are at Liberty
to dispose, freely, of what∣ever may be call'd <HI>Their own:</HI> And,
when, afterwards, they think of <HI>Marrying, their</HI> <PB N="161" REF="162"/>
<HI>Credit,</HI> like that of other Traders, is rated the <HI>higher,</HI> by
how much <HI>wider,</HI> and more <HI>publickly,</HI> They have carried on
their <HI>Dealing.</HI></P>
<P>I THINK, no Doubt can arise, concerning the Welcome with which
<HI>These Two valuable RIGHTS</HI> will be receiv'd: But, not be∣ing
<HI>altogether so clear,</HI> in my Opinion, con∣cerning the
<HI>following,</HI> I shall leave it to be weigh'd, maturely, How, far it may
be <HI>of Use AMONG US,</HI> it is a <HI>Privilege to retire, from the
Fatigue of Man's Society, after having been Mothers of Ten Children.</HI></P>
<P>THE Antient <HI>Tryal, by bitter Waters,</HI> has been more
generally heard of, than ap∣prov'd, among our <HI>Women</HI> here at home, who,
if not, perhaps, the <HI>Deepest,</HI> are, un∣questionably, the
<HI>prettiest Casuists,</HI> in the Universe. But the Duskier Beauties,
of <HI>Negroland,</HI> when under Accusations of <HI>too much good
Nature,</HI> have an Appeal, to <HI>sweeter Waters,</HI> in Justification
of their Innocence: For, in order to discover, to a jealous Hus∣band, whether
the Wife has been guilty, or not, she is thrown, headlong, into a River: And
if she <HI>drowns,</HI> she was a <HI>Sinner.</HI> But, it is a Remark, of
great Consolation, That there never was found a <HI>Woman,</HI> who had not
<HI>Lightness enough to Swim</HI>; and escape the Malice of her
Accusers.</P>
<P>THERE is something, too, in their agree∣able Manner of
<HI>Mourning, for the Death of a Husband,</HI> which deserves to be offer'd
to the Consideration of the SEX, in these more <PB N="162" REF="163"/>
<HI>Phlegmatick, Northern,</HI> Regions: And one wou'd wonder, indeed, how any
thing, <HI>so extravagantly Polite,</HI> shou'd have got Footing, among
People, who never Subscrib'd, to an <HI>Opera.</HI>—The whole Term of
such <HI>Mourn∣ing</HI> is included within <HI>Fourteen Days:</HI> And the
Ceremony consists of <HI>Cries,</HI> which are modulated by the Tunes of
Musical Instru∣ments; and accommodated (with a certain Equitable Dexterity)
to the Ease of the <HI>Performer,</HI> and more lively Entertainment of the
<HI>Audience</HI>; by large, intermediate, <HI>Pauses,</HI> during which they
drink Brandy, and smoke Tobacco, 'till their <HI>Spirits</HI> are duly
rais'd, to expect when the Musick be∣gins again, for <HI>another Act,</HI> of
the <HI>Ob∣sequies.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, above all their agreeable Customs, I contemplate, with
most Reverence, the vast Extent of their <HI>Charity!</HI> There is, in it,
an uncommon Profoundness; and a Tenderness of Heart, beyond
Example!—It is a Practice, among the <HI>Rich Negro Ladies,</HI> on the
<HI>Gold Coast,</HI> to give Orders, on their Death Beds, for buying up a
Number of Female-Slaves, to bestow on the <HI>Publick,</HI> as <HI>Living
Legacies,</HI> whose whole Business it is, to be at Every Body's
Ser∣vice, <HI>in One sole Employment,</HI> (which they are, All, equally,
capable of) for the Price of <HI>Three Periwincle-Shells.</HI>—They
consider This, as a Work, of great Mercy, and Compassion; and,
conscious of their <PB N="163" REF="164"/> pious Purpose, close their
Eyes, and die, satisfied.</P>
<P>I COU'D add an infinite Variety of such uncommon Commodities as
These: But the Foregoing will serve, as <HI>Samples,</HI> of what <HI>Rich
Goods</HI> may be imported, for the Uses, which my Correspondent hints at,
if, in Right of her self, and the <HI>Ladies</HI> she acts for, she cou'd
propose any <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Engraftment,</HI> by vertue whereof, the
<HI>Assistants</HI> of the <HI>Royal Company</HI> might co∣operate with
the <HI>Sisterhood.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be question'd, but, when such a Scheme comes to
be seen, the Di∣rectors of some other, of our more thriv∣ing
<HI>Societies</HI> will <HI>stir</HI> against it, out of Envy, and
propose their <HI>own</HI> respective <HI>Bodies,</HI> as most Capable
of, or more adap∣ted to, the mention'd <HI>Incorporation.</HI> But the Ladies
will, I hope, have Honour enough to <HI>keep close</HI> to their first
Engraf∣ters: And, least their natural Disposition <HI>to think too meanly
of Themselves, and their own Reasonings,</HI> should expose them,
with∣out Defence, to the Force of Arguments, they cannot Answer, I will
conclude this Essay for their Service with the Example of a ROYAL AFRICAN;
<HI>His Majesty, the King of</HI> Boffoe; who, when his <HI>Conscience</HI>
was a little puzzled, brought himself off, by his <HI>Resolution.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="164" REF="165"/>KING <HI>Yagou,</HI> the abovemeant, was a
Lover of the Female Sex; but being a Prince of great Frugality,
<HI>contented</HI> him∣self with <HI>Ten Wives only,</HI> when many of his
Subjects had <HI>Forty</HI>; and out of that small Number, of Ten, would, now
and then, for mere Good Husbandry, bestow <HI>One,</HI> on his Son,
<HI>Joost.</HI>—A <HI>Portu∣gueze Fryar,</HI> to whom he was boasting
of these Great Qualities, represented to him the <HI>Wickedness</HI> of
the Action; and assured him, That no <HI>civiliz'd</HI> Part of the World
allow'd it.—At which, he laugh'd, very heartily, and return'd him this
Answer—<HI>Must I be a Fool, because the White Men of your Country,
are Fools?—My People are better inform'd;—and we act, in both
Places, according to our different Under∣standings!</HI></Q>

1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I REMEMBER a Passage, in some <HI>Eastern</HI> Writer,
which carries a sharp, and instru∣ctive, Moral. An <HI>Emir,</HI> of great
Sanctity, had a Custom, every Night, to call his Fa∣mily together, that they
might sit round him, with due Gravity, to hear his Son read some Chapter of
the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which the Fa∣ther would take Pleasure in opening, and
en∣larging on, to his Domestick Congregation. It happened, one Night, that,
in the midst of the Sermon, the whole Audience <HI>fell asleep</HI>; except
the Preacher, and his Son: Which last, assoon as he observ'd it,
inter∣rupted his Father, with this Remark.—<HI>See, Sir, the Fruits of
your Good Purpose! There is not one, of them All, but sleeps, as soundly,
as if God's Word deserv'd no Reverence!</HI>—The <HI>Emir</HI> look'd
round the Company, and shutting up his <HI>Spectacles,</HI> in the Book,
against a fitter Opportunity, drew his Discourse to a 
<PB N="166" REF="167"/> Conclusion, with this Reply, to his Son's
In∣telligence—<HI>You had, your self, been better employ'd, in adding
One to the Number of Sleep∣ers, than in waking, not so much to correct your
own Faults, as to observe the Faults of Others.</HI></P>
<P>I receiv'd a Letter, the other Day, which brought this Story to my
Remembrance, and is one Proof, among many, how difficult a Province he
undertakes, who assumes the Office of a PLAIN DEALER, at a Time, when
People are so <HI>vigorous,</HI> in the Censures, which they make
<HI>Themselves</HI>; and so <HI>languid,</HI> in their Approbation of
Those, which others make, with the same Liberty!</P>
<P>The Author of this Letter is, so kind, as to let me know, 
<Q REND="inline">"He is one of my <HI>Best Friends</HI>; he will
not therefore insist on my Disingenuity, to <HI>fall foul of</HI>—a
single Sen∣tence,—in one of my late Papers; and, <HI>dwell on one
Error,</HI> in a voluminous Au∣thor: But he is so good as to be in Pain for
my <HI>Veracity</HI>; having carefully (he says) examin'd every single
Paragraph of <HI>Mr.</HI> Trapp's <HI>Preface to his Translation of</HI>
Vir∣gil, and not being able to discover, what I charge him with.—He
closes all, with a Hint, that he writes, in Vindication of that worthy and
Reverend, Author; and would not have Offence taken <HI>at every
Trifle.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>THE VERACITY of the PLAIN DEALER being the Side he will be sure 
<PB N="167" REF="168"/> to be most defensible on, it was unskilfully done,
for a <HI>Lover of the Muses,</HI> as my Cor∣respondent subscribes
himself, to bring on his Attack, so rashly, on that Quarter.—He
ought, first, to have been very careful, and confirm'd, in his
<HI>Discoveries.</HI>—But, to re∣move the <HI>Cloud</HI> from his
Sight, if he pleases to turn to <HI>Page</HI> 382, of the first Volume of
the mention'd Translation; in an <HI>Essay, on moving the
Passions,</HI> previous to the Remarks on the 4th Book, he will find a
Paragraph ended thus,—<HI>We have
not—as—yet—in∣deed—completed the Explication,
propos'd:—For
something—more—still—remains—be∣hind.</HI>—If
this differs from what it appear'd in my Paper, it is only by being a little
<HI>worse</HI> than I made it.</P>
<P>THUS much, to the <HI>Charge,</HI> in that only Part, which
carried any <HI>Appearance</HI> of Rea∣son with it.—The other Articles
have no Weight, at all, but from the Regard that is due to a <HI>mistaken
Good-Nature;</HI> which has misled the Gentleman, whoever he was, to
apprehend, as a <HI>Trifle,</HI> an Error of the first Magnitude, in
Writing.—It is certainly the Business, and the <HI>Aim,</HI> of every
Author, to <HI>explain,</HI> and <HI>illustrate,</HI> his Argument: But this
tedious Redundance obscures, and perplexes it.—Where a Man should
<HI>imprint</HI> Idea's, he distracts and <HI>erazes</HI> them: And,
instead of awakening the Passions, affects the Spirits with
Drowsiness.—Such a <HI>TRIFLE</HI> is this Fault, which my
Correspondent is for <PB N="168" REF="169"/> passing over, with so
tender-hearted a Blind∣ness!</P>
<P>THE censur'd Passage, then, is no Error, of such
<HI>small Importance,</HI> as the Animadver∣tor had thought fit to imagine;
but he falls, next, into another Mistake, of considering it, as a Place,
pick'd out by the Inquisition of a malicious Eye: Whereas (if he had been as
attentive to the <HI>Argument,</HI> of the Paper, where he found that
Censure, as he was to the <HI>Censure Itself</HI>) nothing would have
been more easy, than to have observ'd <HI>Numbers, of the same Kind</HI>
of <HI>Amplifications,</HI> which might, with equal Effect, have been borrow'd
from that work: And, thence, he must have drawn this natural and obvious
Conclusion.—That <HI>one Error, only, was dwelt on,</HI> not be∣cause
it was all that could be found, but be∣cause it was all, that could be
admitted in that Paper.</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>Worthiness,</HI> or <HI>Reverence,</HI> of the
Author, the Letter-Writer himself can wish no less Ill to him, than the
PLAIN DEALER does. But this is a Matter en∣tirely out of the Question. The
<HI>Person</HI> has no∣thing to do, where what he has <HI>written,</HI> and
<HI>published,</HI> is the Ground of the Argument.—For a
<HI>Friend,</HI> Partiality is <HI>Weakness</HI>: And, against an
<HI>Enemy,</HI> it is <HI>Baseness.</HI> The Merit of a Cause lies above
the Level of such low Motives; and they, who would reach it, as they ought,
must be listed in their Attempt, between <HI>Justice</HI> and
<HI>Resolution.</HI>—There is <PB N="169" REF="170"/> nothing, which the
PLAIN DEALER has a sincerer Detestation of, than Personal Re∣proach or
Defamation: But then, on the other side, he who dares not speak out openly,
whenever Occasion offers it self, concerning the Miscarriages of the
Greatest Men, or the Vertues of the most Unprosperous, has a Soul, below
the Duties, of one, who <HI>writes, that he may deserve Reading.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, to make a Transition to a Subject, which I have, for some
Time (in vain) been expecting an Opportunity to <HI>resume,</HI> with a
Spirit less <HI>ludicrous,</HI> than That, in which I touch'd it, not long
since: I am rais'd, to such a Height of Wonders, by the trium∣phant
<HI>Posture,</HI> in which the <HI>Wit</HI> of this Ge∣neration is visible,
almost every Night, at one or other of our Theatres, in the Genius of our
Actors <HI>Limbs,</HI> that there is nothing, which I cannot promise my
self, from the Readiness of their <HI>Elastick Capacity</HI>; and the
Humour, which the Town is in, of <HI>listning,</HI> to the <HI>Voice</HI> of
their <HI>Muscles!</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE noted, for this Reason, what I discovered, not without
due Transport, as I was perusing a certain <HI>Venerable</HI> HIGH GER∣MAN
Compiler, (<HI>CAMERARIUS his Hi∣storical Meditations!</HI>)—It is a
new, and un∣broken <HI>Mine,</HI> of <HI>Theatrical Treasure!</HI> which I
shall recommend, with the stronger Hope, to the Contention of our Rival
Stages, be∣cause, the never-to-be-forgotten, the Trium∣phant <HI>FAUSTUS
HIMSELF</HI> was of Happy <HI>High German</HI> Original!</P>
<Q><PB N="170" REF="171"/> 
<P>I HAVE oftentimes, says this Grave and Authentick Sage! (for I
reverence him too much to vary a Word, from his Text) <HI>seen, with
wondering,</HI> in the Prince of <HI>Bamberg</HI> his Court, a certain
Peasant of <HI>Germany,</HI> nourished, and brought up, as himself
avouched, in the Mountains, <HI>among Beasts</HI>; who was so active, and
nimble, of his Bo∣dy, that all that saw him were <HI>astounded,</HI> and
thought he used <HI>Enchantment,</HI> which, yet, <HI>I do not, verily think
he did!</HI>—And that, which was most remarkable in him was, That he
shewed his Agility, <HI>not stand∣ing, but walking upon his Hands, and his
Feet, prone and flat-back'd, like a Dog, or a Cat!</HI></P> 
<P> IN that same Court, was a <HI>Dwarf,</HI> who would <HI>get
up, upon</HI> this Peasant, as upon a Horse; making him to turn, and wind,
all manner of Ways, as a Rider would do a <HI>Spanish Genet</HI>; But, when
the <HI>Peasant listed,</HI> he wou'd easily <HI>throw his Dwarf,</HI>
for all that ever he could do to sit fast.—Sometimes he was
<HI>baited,</HI> with <HI>very mighty Mastives,</HI> and with <HI>English
Dogs,</HI> that the Prince had: And, by a certain <HI>Barking,</HI> which he
counterfeited naturally, and a <HI>furious snarling, like a Dog,</HI> would
give them the Chase, and make them run apace, out of the Hall.—That
done, he would set himself to <HI>leap,</HI> upon his Hands, and Feet,
forwards, and backwards, with a <PB N="171" REF="172"/> <HI>Nimbleness
incredible!</HI> and would <HI>scramble up, by the Coines,</HI> towards the
Roof of the Hall, faster than an <HI>Ape</HI> could do! albeit, otherwise,
he was a <HI>rustical Fellow, heavy,</HI> and of a <HI>gross
making.</HI></P> 
<P> I SAW him twice, as I was at the Prince's Table (after he had
thrown his Dwarf) and driven away all the Dogs that were in the Room) leap upon
the Shoulders of one of the Guests, and thence upon the Table, without
overturning <HI>Dish,</HI> or <HI>Cup:</HI> And then cast himself with
such a <HI>Spring</HI> up∣on the Floor, that one would have said,
<HI>It</HI> had been a <HI>Squirrel,</HI> or some <HI>wild Cat.</HI>—He
did use to skip as fast upon the Tops of Towers, and of Houses, built
Point-wise, as our House-Cats would do: And so ma∣ny other PARTS of a
<HI>Cat,</HI> and an <HI>Ape,</HI> HE PLAYED, that <HI>his Tricks were the
Talk, and the Wonder of all Men!</HI></P> </Q>
<P>I WAS so pleas'd with this Fancy, that I could not forbear
communicating it, for the future Entertainment of our <HI>People of
Fashi∣on:</HI> And I am so firmly convinc'd of the imi∣tative Spirit, and
Genius of the Hostile <HI>Har∣lequins</HI> of the <HI>Two, Comic,
Houses,</HI> that I que∣stion not, in the least, but by the Second Week,
after <HI>Christmas,</HI> we shall see a Dozen, or two, of Bull-Dogs
round the Tail of <HI>Shep∣herd,</HI> on <HI>Drury-Lane-Stage,</HI> without
being able to <HI>bite him,</HI> while he <HI>curvets</HI> and <HI>barks</HI>
with his <HI>Back up,</HI> and wheels safe, in <HI>their</HI> 
<PB N="172" REF="173"/> <HI>Center</HI>;—And Mr. <HI>LUN,</HI> at the
other House, crawling up the Edge of one of his Scenes, and <HI>sticking to
the Roof, like a Spider</HI> over the Heads of a <HI>shouting Pit!</HI> where
he will <HI>spin</HI> himself into their good Graces, 'till their Necks are
half broke, with the <HI>Subli∣mity</HI> of their Entertainment!</P>

FAIR, without considering what <HI>Vertues,</HI> They, whom they love, are
possess'd of—Let me give them, through your Means, the following
<HI>true</HI> Relation.</P>
<P> <HI>Olivia</HI> is a Lady, of genteel, and fashio∣nable
Education; for her Mother took early Care to <HI>shew her the World,</HI> as
they call it: That is, To teach her, through the most contrary
<HI>Appearances,</HI> to intend No∣thing, but her <HI>Pleasure,</HI> and
<HI>Interest.—Pamphilio</HI> is a Gentleman, of good Estate, in the
Neighbourhood.—The Lady's Re∣putation was unsullied, He saw her
often; and, every Time he saw her, saw new Marks of her Wit, and Good
Humour; her Freedom and Sincerity; 'till from <HI>ad∣miring,</HI> he fell to
<HI>adoring</HI> her.</P>
<P> HIS Love was inflam'd, by the little, innocent, Encouragements,
which <HI>Olivia</HI> knew how to give, without incurring the Imputation of
<HI>Forwardness:</HI> and which <HI>Pamphilio</HI> regarded, as so many
modest Overtures, to the Advantage of his Passion.—His Visits
were more frequent, and more open. He could, no longer, conceal his Love; he
declar'd it, at once, to, both, <PB N="178" REF="179"/> <HI>Olivia,</HI> and her
Mother—for her <HI>Father</HI> was dead: And they, Both, gave him Hope,
of succeeding, in his Wishes.</P>
<P> <HI>Pamphilio</HI>'s Affection growing stronger and
stronger; he became impatient for their Marriage; in the near Prospect of
which, all the Neighbourhood rejoyc'd, and did their Utmost to advance it.
For they observ'd, how his Soul <HI>doated</HI> on her; and darted it∣self
into his <HI>Eyes,</HI> whenever she approach'd him.—<HI>Olivia</HI>
declin'd marrying.—She was too young, she said, to be Mistress of
a Family; and insisted on a <HI>Year more,</HI> in which she might fix
her Resolution.—Tho' this <HI>Year,</HI> to <HI>Pamphilio,</HI> was a
<HI>Lover's Eternity,</HI> he was to submit, on any Terms; and the Time,
requir'd by <HI>Olivia,</HI> at last, drew near its Conclusion.—The
Lady, then, grew <HI>cooler,</HI> and the Lover <HI>more
transported.</HI>—She declar'd to him, very frankly, That <HI>It was
impossible for her to love him.</HI>—Neither <HI>Love,</HI> she
said, nor <HI>Hatred, were Things in our own Power: And he ought not to take
it ill, that she cou'd no longer deceive him.</HI></P>
<P> POOR <HI>Pamphilio</HI> had no Voice to <HI>reply.</HI> But a
sudden <HI>Tear,</HI> or two, <HI>spoke for him!</HI>—He trembled,
grew pale, and gaz'd on her—and sigh'd, at length this faint
Hope—<HI>That she cou'd not, sure, be in Ear∣nest.</HI>—She
answered, <HI>He had no Reason to give himself the Air of so much
Surprize.—She had never promis'd him Marriage,—</HI> 
<PB N="179" REF="180"/> <HI>and was, yet, at her own
Disposal.—Pam∣philio,</HI> bow'd, and left her; and has, also, left
<HI>Society.</HI> He shuns all his former Companions: And is sunk, in the
deepest Melancholy! His Affairs are neglected, his Health is destroy'd; and
his Friends are enrag'd and astonish'd!</P>
<P> ABOUT a Quarter of a Year ago, <HI>Olivia</HI> was
<HI>married:</HI> and with so extraordinary a Success, that her Relations
are already upon suing out a <HI>Divorce.</HI>—What ought to ren∣der
the Condition of this Lady <HI>Inconsolable,</HI> if she has either
Generosity, or Reflection, is,—That <HI>Her</HI> hard Fortune afflicts
<HI>Pam∣philio,</HI> to a sharper Degree than <HI>His own</HI> did!</P>
<P> SUCH a <HI>Jilting</HI> Temper, may, perhaps, be consistent
with <HI>Chastity,</HI> but it can have neither <HI>Honour,</HI> nor
<HI>Tenderness.</HI>—She was form'd to inspire Love, and very capable
of it, by <HI>Nature:</HI> But she was harden'd, by <HI>Education,</HI> to
become <HI>unsusceptible</HI> of it.—She expos'd Charms to Sale,
which she intended not to part with: And, then, like a covetous Tradesman,
who has lost his best Market, she resolv'd, as a pretty Revenge, <HI>to
throw herself away, upon the First Bidder.</HI></P>

<P>I NEVER met with any Accident, which more touchingly surpriz'd
me, than the Death of my Friend, Sir <HI>Portly Rufus,</HI> under
Circumstances, with Regard to his Fortune, much inferior to the Figure, he
had maintain'd in the World; and which made such Impres∣sions on his
departing Soul, as serv'd, at once, to excite my Pity, and inflame my
Admiration.</P>
<P>I VISITED him, during his Sickness, and found his Family in
great Disorder: The chearful Faces, which were formerly worn, by his
Servants, as the lively Signals of his Hospitality, were quench'd, and
sadden'd by a Sorrow, that prov'd its <HI>Deepness,</HI> by its
<HI>Silence.</HI>—He was fallen into a forc'd Sleep, 
<PB N="181" REF="182"/> when I came down to his House in the Coun∣try; and it
being late in the Evening, I went to Bed, with a Resolution not to disturb
him, 'till the Morning.—I lay awake, and heard the Clock strike
<HI>One,</HI> indulging my Thoughts, under the Solemnity of the Midnight
Dark∣ness, with a Thousand busy Reflections, on the Instability of our
Health and Pleasures; when, from an Old Tower of the Parish-Church, which
was almost contiguous to my Chamber-Window, I heard the <HI>Toll,</HI> of a
Great Bell, sound out, many Times, distinct∣ly, with a deep, and mournful
Fullness, which left an unusual Vibration in the Air; and had scarce
ceas'd, when I found the whole Family alarm'd; and the House fill'd with
<HI>Shriekings,</HI> and the most distracted Cries of Sorrow.</P>
<P>I ROSE, and dress'd my self, in much Amazement; and, following
the Clamour, found it, collected in the Sick Man's Cham∣ber:—I was
assur'd, at the crowded En∣trance, That <HI>Sir Portly was a Dying
Man.</HI>—That <HI>the Bell, which had toll'd out, at Mid∣night, always
did so, of it's self, before every Death, that was to happen, in the
Family:</HI>—That <HI>it was a Warning, which had never
fail'd:</HI>—And, That <HI>Sir Portly, who had been wak'd, by the Sound
of it, was, himself, of the Opini∣on, That he could live but a few
Hours.</HI></P>
<P>I FOUND my Friend, sitting up, in his Bed, very faint, and
scarce able to speak; and looking round him, with a Mixture of Wildness,
and of Sorrow, on the Distraction <PB N="182" REF="183"/> of his Assembled
Family.—As soon as he saw me near him, He gave me his Hand, with a
Glimpse of Chearfulness, which seem'd to brighten, through his Anguish:
And, in∣sisting, with much Earnestness, That I should be left, for
some Time, alone, with him, the rest withdrew, and I sat near him, on the
Bed-side.—He continued silent, for several Minutes, fixing his Eyes
on me, very sted∣fastly, and with much inward Commotion; till at last he
spoke to me, as follows.</P>
<Q>YOU have tim'd this Visit, kindly; for it is the Last, you
will ever make me: It is a sensible Comfort, that I have this Op∣portunity
to communicate my dying Senti∣ments, to a Friend, who will be capable of doing
me Justice, where the World may speak of me with a mistaking
Liberty—</Q>
<P>HERE he put a Key into my Hand, and di∣rected me to find a Paper,
which I have now in my Possession; and from the Subject of which, I
shall take Occasion, some Time hereafter, to draw more Observations
than One, for the Use of Men of Business, who may receive Entertainment,
and Advantage, from it.—He said something, concerning his Private
Affairs, in which my Advice he be∣liev'd, might be of Service to his Family:
And, then assum'd a Discourse, on the <HI>Toll∣ing of the Parish
Bell,</HI> and proceeded in it with much Composure.</P>
<Q><PB N="183" REF="184"/> 
<P> I HAVE neither Learning, <HI>said he,</HI> nor Leisure, to
enter upon an Examination, concerning the <HI>Causes</HI> of these
<HI>Praeter-Na∣tural Notices.</HI> It is enough for me, that <HI>It is
thus:</HI> And you will soon be convinc'd of the Consequence, with Regard
to my ap∣proaching End.—But, Let not any Thing, so common as
<HI>Death,</HI> be an Affliction, or Surprize to you. I have enjoy'd my Bed of
<HI>Sickness,</HI> like a <HI>Study.</HI> It has given me an Opportunity of
retiring into my self, without Partiality or Interruption!—The Danger
of my Condition drew a Curtain betwixt the World and me, and contra∣cted all my
Business into the Compass of this silent Chamber. Here I have seen
Things, <HI>as they are,</HI> and learnt to judge of them, without
Prejudice.</P> 
<P> TO <HI>forsake the World,</HI> gives me no Pain, from any
Attachment to its Pleasures. It can tempt me with Nothing <HI>New</HI>; for I
have, already, seen it all.—Though I die (as I shall) to Night,
<HI>To-morrow</HI> will be like to <HI>To-day</HI>: The same <HI>Sun</HI>
will rise up∣on it; and leave it, in the same Darkness.—The
Seasons will come round again, and be <HI>call'd New</HI>; but they will be
no other than the Repetition of what I have, so often beheld
already.—Why should it startle me, to be call'd back to the Place,
from which I came hither? I rose, from Uncertainty, into Life; and I am now
but returning, out of Life, into Uncertainty. Can any Thing 
<PB N="184" REF="185"/> be more reasonable, than that <HI>Others</HI> ha∣ving
given Place to <HI>Me,</HI> I should give Place to others, in my
Turn?—Either I have not made the proper <HI>Use</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI>
which I have enjoy'd so long already, and therefore de∣serve to hold it no
longer: Or, having reap'd the Profit of Living, to what End should I wish
Life lengthen'd?</P> 
<P> I HAVE many Hopes, 'tis true, which, it grieves my Soul, to
leave imperfect: But, if I would live, 'till I am <HI>compleatly Happy,</HI> I
seek what is never to be found. It were to act, like those foolish
<HI>Indians,</HI> who run themselves out of Breath, to <HI>catch the
Sun,</HI> when it seems to <HI>set, so near them:</HI>—So might I
travel on, <HI>for ever,</HI> and weary my self, to no Purpose: The Object
of my Pursuit is not in the same World, where I am!</P> 
<P> YET there is one Thing, which makes Death <HI>terrible,</HI>
and triumphs over Reason, Reflexion, and Philosophy! It is, That we are
torn from our <HI>Friend's Society.</HI>—That we are divided, by,
perhaps, an <HI>Everlast∣ing</HI> Separation, from what <HI>Love</HI> has
made <HI>dearer</HI> to us than our <HI>Life</HI> is! It is that
Blending,—That Liquefaction—or Con∣fusion, of Two Hearts, in one
Will, De∣sire, and Interest, which is the <HI>Spirit</HI> of all human
Blessings! Light is Darkness, with∣out it; and Prosperity <HI>not
enjoy'd,</HI> but <HI>pos∣sess'd,</HI> without Relish.</P> 
<P><PB N="185" REF="186"/> IN this View, of our Soul's Union, here
on Earth, with some kindred Spirit, which it delights to mingle with, Death
is <HI>dread∣ful,</HI> when it strikes between us!—How many
unfinish'd Purposes may it interpose it self, to the Disappointment
of, with Re∣gard to the Comfort, or Service, of Those, who are thus
<HI>Dear</HI> to us, when we are cut off, by a sudden Summons, and allow'd no
Time to compleat our yet but intentional Gratitude, or give Perfection to our
unri∣pen'd Labours! Can a <HI>Husband</HI> sit Easie <HI>within,</HI> when
he is straining his dying Eyes, for the last, afflicting, Sight of a
Wise, who deserv'd his Tenderness, and was intitled to his Protection;
but, whom he is, that Mo∣ment, compell'd to leave, to struggle with the
Bitterness of <HI>Want</HI>; and acquaint her∣self with the
Licentiousness of Reproach, Contempt and Insult!—Or can there be a
Strength, in Wisdom, to sustain a dying <HI>Father,</HI> whose Heart is
tortur'd with the burning Uncertainty, of what shall become of his helpless
Children, expos'd Orphans, to an unpitying World, without Guide, Support, or
Prospect?</P> </Q>
<P>HERE, my Friend was interrupted, by the Impatience of his Family,
who broke in up∣on us, with a Grief, which soon appear'd to have too just a
Ground: For <HI>Sir Portly</HI> died, in less than a quarter of an Hour
after.—There were many Circumstances, in the Man∣ner 
<PB N="186" REF="187"/> of his Death, which will deserve to be describ'd, in
a future Paper: But the melan∣choly Impression they have left me under,
will at present be best indulg'd by an Ab∣stract of some Excellent
Verses, from a POEM of <HI>Mrs. ELIZABETH SINGER</HI>'s, <HI>on the Death of
Her Husband.</HI>—I am not sure, that I remember them right; for it is
long, since I read them: But there is so much of <HI>Beauty, Nature</HI>
and <HI>Passion,</HI> in them, that the Reader cannot fail to discern,
and ad∣mire, the Author's Genius, through what∣ever Injury they may have
suffer'd, by any Injustice, I may, perhaps, have done them.</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>IN what soft Language shall my Thoughts break free,</L>
<L>My dear <HI>Alexis!</HI> when I talk of <HI>Thee</HI>?</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Nymph,</HI> nor <HI>Grace,</HI> of all the fancied
Train,</L>
<L>Nor <HI>weeping Loves,</HI> shall aid my pensive
Strain:</L>
<L>True Passion has a Force, too strong for
<HI>Art;</HI></L>
<L>She needs <HI>no Muse,</HI> who can invoke her
<HI>Heart.</HI></L>
<L>Tasteless of <HI>Forms,</HI> and from all Comfort
torn,</L>
<L>The <HI>Husband—Lover</HI>—and the
<HI>Friend,</HI>—I mourn!</L>
<L>All, that to Worth, and Tenderness, was due;</L>
<L>Whate'er Excess the fondest Passion knew,</L>
<L><HI>I felt!</HI>—My Pray'rs to <HI>Heav'n,</HI> were,
All, for <HI>Thee:</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Love</HI> inspir'd me, first, with
<HI>Piety.</HI></L>
<L>Oh! Thou wert all my Triumph, and my Pride:</L>
<L>My Hope, my Peace, my Shelter, and my Guide!</L>
<L><HI>Thy Love</HI> (sweet Study!) busied all my Days:</L>
<L>And my full Soul's Ambition was <HI>Thy Praise</HI>!</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
<L>Why has my Heart this fond Engagement known?</L>
<L>Or, why wou'd Heav'n dissolve the Tye, so soon?</L>
<L>Whence had the Charmer all his <HI>Power to move</HI>?</L>
<L>Or, why was all my Breast so <HI>turn'd,</HI> for
<HI>Love?</HI></L>

<L>Oh! he cou'd <HI>talk!</HI>—'Twas <HI>Extasie</HI> to

<L>The <HI>list'ning Soul</HI> hung, trembling, on the
<HI>Ear.</HI></L>
<L>Musick's whole Power dwelt, artless, on his Tongue;</L>
<L><HI>Awefully soft,</HI> like some kind Angel's Song!</L>
<L><HI>Pain,</HI> that but heard <HI>Him</HI> speak, was
charm'd to <HI>Rest</HI>:</L>
<L>And <HI>Mercy</HI> melted down the <HI>Miser</HI>'s
Breast!</L>
<L>Hours, Days, and Years, unheeded, took their Flight:</L>
<L>For <HI>Time</HI> was only measur'd by <HI>Delight!</HI></L>

<L>Fancy, still, paints him, fresh, in every Grace;</L>
<L>But, the thin Shade eludes my lost Embrace:</L>
<L>The shrinking Vision melts, in shapeless Night,</L>
<L>And a cold Horror blots my blasted Sight!</L>
<L>Then, the past Mis'ery rises, to my View,</L>
<L>His <HI>Death</HI> (sad Scene!) will be, for ever,

</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, <HI>December</HI> 25.
1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT has been justly observ'd, by our Wri∣ters, in Defence of
the <HI>Stage,</HI> That <HI>It is a</HI> GLASS, <HI>in which we see, what
we, our∣selves, are, by the Image of our own Actions, represented in the
Persons of Others.</HI>—Commend me then, to the Wit, or the Satire, of
one of our Theatres, where they have brought <HI>Newgate,</HI> into their
<HI>Mirrour,</HI> and taught our People of Quality, the elegant Art of
<HI>breaking Jayl,</HI> by Way of Diversion and Improvement.</P>
<P>TO Treat this Subject, if possible, with some Appearance of
<HI>Gravity,</HI> either the Taste of our Audiences must be depraved, to a
Degree of Horror; or the Judgment of our Master-Players corrupted, to a
Degree of Pity!—Too long, indeed, have the most Successful of our
Theatrical Entertainments been <HI>Low</HI> and <HI>Contemptible</HI>; but I
never ob∣serv'd, before, That they were <HI>Ungenerous,</HI> 
<PB N="190" REF="191"/> and <HI>Inhumane!</HI>—What Idea will Posterity
conceive of the Present Age, when they shall read, among a thousand
living Records, to our Infamy, That our Nobility, and Peo∣ple, of the First
Figure, in Life, cou'd de∣scend to be Partakers in an Insult offered to the
Memory, and Misfortune, of a poor Wretch, a <HI>Felon,</HI> who had, just
before, been Executed, at <HI>Tyburn</HI>; by sitting, contented Spectators,
to observe his Crimes, and his Miseries, acted over again, for their
Delight, and Instruction.</P>
<P>BUT, If (as <HI>Lucan</HI> says of <HI>Nero</HI>) the Gods cou'd
make Way for <HI>CAESAR,</HI> by no other Means than those dreadful Things
which <HI>preceded</HI> him,—If <HI>Nothing less</HI> cou'd induce the
Town, to bear with the insup∣portable <HI>CAESAR in AEGYPT,</HI> than their
acting it immediately after SHEPHERD <HI>in</HI> NEWGATE, the Players have, at
least, <HI>One</HI> Good Argument for permitting it:—They made Way too
for a <HI>Brother's Tragedy,</HI> whose tender Heart might, have been broke,
if he had, <HI>twice, write dismally,</HI> to no Pur∣pose.—<HI>King
JOHN,</HI> the Dramatick <HI>Abor∣tive,</HI> of last Winter, was a
pusillanimous Prince, and cou'd condescend to hear Rea∣sons, why it was
necessary to submit, for Fear of <HI>a forcible Deposing:</HI> But
<HI>CAESAR</HI> was a <HI>Hero,</HI> and too <HI>resolv'd,</HI> to shake at
<HI>Danger!</HI>—Tho' all the Serpents, of <HI>Africa,</HI> shou'd have
<HI>hiss'd in his Face,</HI> he would have regarded them, as little, 
<PB N="191" REF="192"/> as he did, the <HI>Boxes,</HI> the <HI>Pit,</HI> and the
<HI>Gallery.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Tragedy is so provoking, and co∣pious a Field for Satire,
that it is with Diffi∣culy, I restrain my Pen, from the severest Licence
of just <HI>Invectives.</HI> But I soften my Indignation, when I turn my
Eye, from the Play to the <HI>Author:</HI>—The Exemplary <HI>Candor,
Humanity, Politeness, Affability,</HI> and <HI>Generosity,</HI> of that
Gentleman's indulgent Behaviour, with Regard to the Works and Interest of
other Writers! But, <HI>above all, his prodigious Modesty!</HI> These, his
extraordinary and well-known, Virtues, overbalance a thousand Absurdities
in his Tragedy; and determine me to continue silent.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Theatre,</HI> to confess the Truth, is a Subject of too
much <HI>Consequence,</HI> from its Effect on the Morals, and Behaviour of
the <HI>Publick,</HI> to leave it either decent, or reason∣able, to omit
Defects in the Stage's Constitu∣tion, and descend to the Actor's particular
Failings.—But we have Persons on the Stage, who want not some
<HI>Graces,</HI> and Ge∣nerous Qualities, as well of Body, as of Mind, which
might have <HI>adorn'd,</HI> even the Best of those Characters, which they
are ac∣custom'd to represent: And of These I shall speak
seriously, and with Pleasure, on Occa∣sions which will offer
themselves, when I come, in a little Time, to consider the <HI>Pre∣sent
State of our Stage,</HI> and what Justice there may be, in those Pretences
to its <HI>Im∣provement,</HI> <PB N="192" REF="193"/> which we have heard so
very much of, under its Management, as it now stands.</P>
<P>BUT, TO return to my first Subject: There have not been wanting,
publick Marks of Disapprobation, as often as those ill-cho∣sen
Entertainments above-mentioned have been exhibited: Yet, they <HI>went on, with
an unmoveable Steadiness of Resolution,</HI> which, in a Cause, the
<HI>Reverse</HI> of theirs, might de∣serve to be call'd a <HI>Virtue</HI>;
and, even as the Case really stands, it is an <HI>Accomplishment, very
new, and Extraordinary,</HI> and must be allow'd not unworthy of the
<HI>highest Admi∣ration!</HI>—That heroic <HI>Roman</HI> Spirit, which
<HI>Horace</HI> speaks of, in the Motto to my PAPER, went no farther than a
private applauding himself, at home, in Return for the <HI>Hisses,</HI>
which he met with, when abroad: But our <HI>English</HI> Firmness of Face,
can <HI>look Reproach in the Teeth,</HI> and persevere, with as much
Negligence, and Satisfaction, as if we suf∣fer'd for our <HI>Excess of
Wit,</HI> what is levell'd at our <HI>Want of Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS favour'd many Months since, with a Sheet or Two, of
Excellent Reflexions, which were lost, by some Accident, and have been but
lately recover'd. The follow∣ing Observations, seem so applicable to my
present Purpose, that I cannot do better than borrow them, for Reproof of a
barbarous Custom, which had spread itself, <HI>too broad,</HI> among us,
before it appear'd on one of our <HI>Theatres.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194"/>AT <HI>Paris,</HI> and at
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> there is scarce a Week passes, without some
<HI>Publick Execution</HI>; and yet, tho' there are <HI>News-Papers</HI> in
Abundance, we seldom, or never, find any Account of that Sort, in
them.—They think, and perhaps justly enough, That it is a Point of
National Credit, to conceal, with as much Decency as they can, the Enormities
of their Countrymen.—On the contrary, our Writers for the <HI>Day,</HI>
and the <HI>Week,</HI> watch with Earnestness, for the Op∣portunity, and
are sure to pass by no such Subject.—It often makes a very Glaring
<HI>Paragraph</HI>; but is sometimes unhappily sci∣tuated. I have
frequently known a <HI>Change at Court</HI> yok'd with a <HI>Remove at
Tyburn;</HI> and both follow'd, close in the Rear, by an Account of some
<HI>Church-Advancement</HI>; or new-drawn <HI>Matrimonial Tye,</HI> among
People of Quality.</P>
<P>I ONLY hint at these Liberties, and de∣sire to deal gently
with my Contempora∣ries.—There are other Wretches among us, who attend
the <HI>Gibbet,</HI> like Ravens, or Vul∣tures, and expect their
<HI>Subsistence</HI> from it.—Not a poor Criminal can be hang'd, but
they break open his expiring Lips, and rob him of his <HI>Last Words.</HI>
When he has suffer'd the Sentence of the <HI>Law,</HI> he is condemn'd,
afresh, to a <HI>Libel:</HI> And is far from be∣ing <HI>at Rest,</HI> even
after he has surrender'd his Life to the Halter, his Cloaths to the Hangman,
and his Body to the Sur∣geons! <PB N="194" REF="195"/> For, then, come the
Scribler, the Pamphleteer, and the <HI>Biographer</HI> of <HI>New∣gate,</HI>
who <HI>draw</HI> out his Good Name, and <HI>quarter</HI> it; and hang up his
Reputation, in <HI>Effigie,</HI> They give him a <HI>Quarto,</HI> or an
<HI>Octavo</HI> Shrowd; and fringe, and flourish it with his <HI>Birth,</HI>
and <HI>Parentage.</HI>—Hence, the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> to preserve his
<HI>Perquisites,</HI> is driven upon the Necessity of <HI>advertising
against Counterfeits</HI>; and, has, sometimes, no better Expedient, than
to publish the <HI>Posthumous Works</HI> of his Communicants, <HI>even
before they are yet departed!</HI></P>
<P>TO be <HI>half-hang'd,</HI> has been the Case of one or two
Sufferers; but to be <HI>twice hang'd,</HI> is a very great Hardship: And
when a Cri∣minal's Account of <HI>Himself</HI> is suppos'd to be
<HI>true,</HI> it seems a Mifortune that They, who wilfully, <HI>belye,</HI>
him, should be permit∣ted to survive him.—If the Sufferer can write
and read, then, besides his <HI>Birth,</HI> and <HI>Education,</HI> his
<HI>Tryal,</HI> and <HI>Confession,</HI> we have <HI>his Last Works, and
Compositions.</HI> If he is married, we have <HI>his Widow's
Lamen∣tation.</HI> If he dies, troubled, and unsa∣tisfied, we have <HI>his
Ghost:</HI> And if his Life has been at all remarkable, we have <HI>His
History, and Adventures.</HI>—Some ready Compiler of <HI>Newgate,</HI>
bundles up his <HI>Me∣moirs,</HI> and describes his Exploits, in so
dis∣creet, and adapted, Style, That the Plea∣santry of the Relation is more
apt to prevail, <PB N="195" REF="196"/> on the <HI>Young,</HI> and the
<HI>Giddy</HI> (who are the common Readers of such Tracts) to
<HI>imitate</HI> a Life of so much seeming Heroick Extra∣vagance, than to
take Example, from the fatal End of it.</P>
<P>I KNOW not whether such <HI>Exposing</HI> Me∣thods as These,
are not suffer'd to take Place, by Way of Advance upon the Lenity of our
<HI>English Executions</HI>; and as a Counterballance to the Foreign
Severities of <HI>Torture,</HI> and <HI>Mu∣tilation.</HI> If there is any
such Depth of Poli∣tick Refinement, in the Indulgence, which is shewn this
Practice, the <HI>Dead</HI> feel nothing that relates to them; and the
<HI>Living,</HI> I am perswaded, are very little the better, for such
<HI>Paper Executions.</HI> But, of <HI>This,</HI> I can ven∣ture to be
positive, That should some Drudge for the Bookseller's Benefit, make a
<HI>Collecti∣on of all Works, of this kind,</HI> and some mer∣cenary
Translator dress it out, in a Foreign Language, our Neighbours, and our
Poste∣rity, might be tempted to believe, That the present Generation of
<HI>Englishmen</HI> were <HI>a Na∣tion of Thieves, and Pick-pockets.</HI></P>

<P> I HAVE such a Veneration for the FAIR, that I am sorry, I

once a Week, so whimsically treated, by some of them, that I am
re∣solv'd to <HI>speak out, and spare not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="198"/> THERE are many young Ladies, and, what is
worse, many old Ladies, within the Bills of Mortality, that, every
<HI>Satur∣day,</HI> while their Houses are cleaning, take a Fancy to have
Business with <HI>Me,</HI> for no other Reason in the World, but
because they can't tell how else to dispose of
them∣selves:—For, you must know, That I am a
<HI>Mercer.</HI>—They swim into my Shop, by Shoals, not with the
least Intention to <HI>buy,</HI> but only to hear my Silks <HI>rustle,</HI>
and fill up their own <HI>Leisure,</HI> by putting <HI>Me</HI> into full
<HI>Employment.</HI> So they tumble over my Goods, and deafen me with a Round
of Questions, 'till, having found nothing in my Shop, <HI>to their
Fancy,</HI> as they call it, they toss themselves again into their Coaches,
and <HI>drive on the Persecution,</HI> to the Terror and Disturbance of
most of the honest Shop∣keepers, from one End of the Town, to the
other.</P>
<P> LAST <HI>Saturday</HI> was three Weeks, at Two, in the
Afternoon, I sent out my Servant, to watch a Couple of these <HI>Silken
Strollers,</HI> and keep, if possible, within <HI>Ken</HI> of them. They
<HI>undress'd</HI> about a Dozen Shops, with∣out stripping themselves of
a single Shil∣ling; and, at six, my Man return'd, out of Breath, and told
me, That he had left them, cheapening Sugars, beyond
<HI>Norton-Falgate.</HI>—But, presently, they came back, and saw my
next Neighbour, a <HI>Linen-Dra∣per,</HI> at his Door. They pull'd their
Coach∣man <PB N="198" REF="199"/> by the Thumb, and broke in upon my Friend and
Acquaintance, tho' his Shop was shut up, and empty.—They had be∣thought
themselves, that <HI>they must see some Cambricks.</HI> My Neighbour
<HI>knew</HI> them, for they were his Customers of five Years stan∣ding;
during all which Time, he had never taken any of their Money—But they had
done him the Honour, to lean over his Counter, find Fault with every Thing he
cou'd shew them; Exclaim, at his <HI>fright∣ful Prices,</HI> and make it a
Rule with them, <HI>To bid Nothing</HI>—He turn'd over his whole Variety
of Cambricks; and had the unex∣pected Good-Fortune, after the prettiest
Doubtings, and Hesitations, in the World, to fix their Determination; for
they pitch'd upon a particular Piece, about half an Hour past Seven, and
order'd him to <HI>cut off enough for a Tucker.</HI></P>

<P> A GREAT many useful Lectures were levell'd, heretofore,
against the En∣ormities of certain Fashions, which had 
<PB N="199" REF="200"/> taken Possession of the Female World.—The
Reduction of the <HI>Stays.</HI> The Exal∣tation of the
<HI>Petticoat</HI>—and the Light∣ness, and the Transparency of the
<HI>Modesty Peice</HI>—(as that SEX had peceluiar Views, in each of
these Modes) have been Topicks, for Admonition, and Stature.—The LADIES
have even been told, That the obsolete Re∣liques, of their
Great-Grandmother's Scare-crow Wardrobes, were less Fantastical than the
<HI>modern Whimsies!</HI> But those wholesome Severities suffer'd the
Comon Fate of such Good Purposes, <HI>They diverted for a Week, and were
forgotten.</HI></P>
<P> ALL Arguments, which would be suc∣cessful, must adapt
themselves to the <HI>Un∣derstanding</HI> of those in whom they expect to
operate.—The WIT of a Woman is her <HI>Dress.</HI> To <HI>move
genteely,</HI> is her JUDGMENT: And, to <HI>Govern herself, with full
Freedom,</HI> is her BIRTH RIGHT, as an <HI>English Sub∣ject</HI>; who
renounces, and protests against, all absolute, and unlimited,
Monarchy.</P>
<P> BUT, pray, whisper (if you dare) to these pretty
<HI>Free-Thinkers,</HI> That there is a a Country, in the World, call'd
<HI>Turkey</HI>; where Women are secur'd against the Dan∣ger of
<HI>Sun-burning,</HI> by being kept out of the <HI>open Air,</HI> and lock'd
up, like <HI>other Jewels,</HI> in Places where no <HI>Mischief</HI> can

<P> A LITTLE private <HI>Rumination,</HI> on such laudable

<Q> 
<P> AFTER having reflected on my Mi∣stress, and on Marriage, I
fell asleep, and found my self in a <HI>Myrtle Grove,</HI> where several
<HI>Ways</HI> ran together into one Great Path, that led to the <HI>Temple of
Hy∣men.</HI>—The Flowers, most of which were <HI>Violets,</HI> and
<HI>bleeding Lovers,</HI> exhal'd a deli∣cious Odour: And the Birds, that
warbled round me, help'd to fill the Scene with Transport.</P> 
<P> I OBSERV'D Crowds of Travellers, pas∣sing onward; but none,
to my great Sur∣prize, <HI>repassing.</HI>—Upon looking a little
nearer, I discover'd Troops of flying Boys with Silver Wings, that hover'd
before them, for their <HI>Guides.</HI> There were Per∣sons of all Ranks, and
of both Sexes.</P> 
<P> I TOOK particular Notice of some, who tho' they seem'd to
make more Haste then the rest, were, at the End, the farthest
behind-hand. These, I heard, were call'd <HI>Coquets,</HI> in the Language of
the Country. <PB N="202" REF="203"/> They seem'd, to do nothing but sport,
and flutter about; without gaining any Ground, or <HI>desiring</HI> to gain
any.</P> 
<P> THE next, I was told, were <HI>Prudes:</HI> And these had taken
a Bye-Path, and mov'd onward, toward the Temple, very slowly; and, to all
Appearance, unwill∣ingly; with their Necks fantastically re∣verted, and their
Eyes looking back, upon the Country, they had newly pass'd through. Yet
These were the First that came up; and slipt, silently into the
Temple!</P> 
<P> AMONG the Men, was a Troop, which seem'd compos'd of the most
expert Tra∣vellers. My Guide inform'd me, They were call'd <HI>Hibernians.</HI>
They did many Things, I perceiv'd, very differently from the rest: For, while
others led up but <HI>one</HI> Companion, to the Temple, these had
seve∣ral, in several Paths; and were the only Persons, who, after lodging
<HI>One,</HI> went out again, to conduct <HI>Another.</HI>—It was easy
to distinguish them, however mingled in the Crowd, by the <HI>Shine</HI> of
a certain <HI>Metal,</HI> which had burnish'd their Cheeks, and Fore∣heads,
and cast a <HI>Gleam,</HI> like a <HI>Corinthian Vizard.</HI></P> 
<P> I WAS call'd off, by a confus'd Noise, at some Distance;
and made toward it, as well as I cou'd; but found such an Alte∣ration in the
Air, that I cou'd not stir one Step, without sneezing. This was a Troop of
<HI>Sword-Knots,</HI> and <HI>Cockades,</HI> displaying <PB N="203" REF="204"/> a powerful Instrument, that glitter'd much, and was call'd a
<HI>Snuff-Box.</HI> The Scuffle of Tongues was so great, that I staid not
long, among the <HI>Pretty Gentlemen,</HI> (for that was the Name they went by)
but pass'd on, to a Part of the Grove, whence there issued a delightful
<HI>Harmony.</HI></P> 
<P> COMING thither, I observ'd a Number, apart from the rest,
with Harps in their Hands, which they touch'd, with transpor∣ting Melody.
Nine Goddesses were mix'd among them: all most ravishingly beauti∣ful!
These happy Gentlemen, I found, were the Favourites of the Grove; but they
made no Haste to the Temple; rather wandering up and down, and making
<HI>Sal∣lies</HI> into every Path, with an Air of agree∣able Indifference.</P> 
<P> I LEFT them, and came up with a Troop of Clowdy, Haughty, and
Erect, Movers, distinguish'd by <HI>peculiar Head-Pieces,</HI> which, at
Distance, look'd like <HI>Diadems.</HI> All the Female Travellers, they
chanc'd to meet with, receiv'd their Whispers with a kind of Triumph; and
listen'd to them with more Rapture, than even to the Voices of those
<HI>Divine Musicians!</HI>—This Train was under the Care of two
Goddesses, whose Names were <HI>Insolence</HI> and <HI>Privilege!</HI>
I was now within the Sight of the Temple; but taking an Aversion, in my
Sleep, to the affected <HI>Struttings</HI> of this Company, I wak'd fortunately
out of my Dream, and resolv'd to send it to the PLAIN-DEALER.</P></Q>

<P>AN Evil Spirit had taken Possession of one of the
Villages, in <HI>Lapland,</HI> and turn'd the Inhabitants into <HI>Bears:</HI>
By which Means, being depriv'd of the <HI>Discretion</HI> of <HI>Humane
Creatures,</HI> and unable to provide for <HI>Themselves</HI>; the King of
the Country committed them to the <HI>Keeping</HI> of two or three of his
<HI>Beef-Eaters</HI>; who took the Of∣fice, with no other Prospect, than to
live at their Ease, on the <HI>Perquisites</HI> of it; and were
consequently, more inclinable to provide Diet, to their <HI>own</HI> Taste,
than to that of the Meta∣morphos'd <HI>Animals,</HI> which had been deli∣ver'd
into their Custody.—They had, how∣ever, so much Gratitude, for the
Profit, ac∣cruing from their <HI>Grant,</HI> as to resolve, That the poor
Creatures shou'd want nothing, that was <HI>Strong</HI> and <HI>Savoury:</HI>
But they had not <PB N="205" REF="206"/> the Judgment, to consider, That a
<HI>Man,</HI> when he becomes a <HI>Bear,</HI> requires a <HI>coarser</HI>
Kind of Nourishment, than he was accu∣stomed to, while a <HI>Rational
Creature!</HI>—They gave 'em nothing to drink but <HI>Brandy</HI>; and
fed 'em with <HI>Cock-Broth,</HI> and <HI>Forc'd-Meats</HI>; 'till they, All,
grew giddy, and light-headed, and were taken with a dange∣rous
<HI>Vertigo.</HI></P>
<P>A YOUNG Shepherd, who had been brought up a little
<HI>wildly</HI>; and, who, by li∣ving much among Beasts, had acquainted
himself with the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Bears,</HI> under∣took to <HI>Board
'em Cheaper</HI>; and built, and open'd, to that End, a <HI>New House of
Enter∣tainment;</HI> where, for the same Rates which were paid his Rivals, he
treated the Ani∣mals, in their own Way, with <HI>raw Horse Flesh,</HI>
instead of <HI>Ragousts</HI>; and <HI>Spring Wa∣ter,</HI> in the Place of
<HI>Brandy.</HI>—The <HI>Bears</HI> were strangely delighted, at a
Change, they were, so able to relish; and flock'd, in Trans∣port, to
their <HI>New Ordinary</HI>; where they <HI>grinn'd,</HI> and grew
<HI>fat,</HI> upon a <HI>Diet,</HI> which was adapted to their Palates: So
that, in a little Time, not a <HI>Cub,</HI> of any <HI>Quality,</HI> cou'd make
a Meal, upon their <HI>Old Commons.</HI> And the poor Shepherd, who provided
for them, <HI>so judiciously,</HI> had all their Custom, for the future,
and became Richer, than the <HI>King's own Bear-Wards!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207"/>How such an odd Story as this came in my
Way, I know not; But I will leave it, as I found it: For I am in a Humour to
talk of the <HI>Theatres.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Royal Company of Comedians</HI> differs from the
<HI>South-Sea-Company,</HI> the <HI>Bank,</HI> and other <HI>Acting
Companies,</HI> of this <HI>City,</HI> in this one Point, among more, That It
has <HI>Dire∣ctors,</HI> but no <HI>Governour.</HI>—It is certain,
how∣ever, that those <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> whom they call their
<HI>Managers,</HI> have had all possible Advan∣tage on their Side. The
Court-Authority, and Countenance, went with them.—The <HI>Noble,</HI> and
the <HI>Ignoble,</HI> join'd in a long, and unreasonable Partiality, to
support them, <HI>without Rivals</HI>; in direct Opposition to the
Interest of their own Pleasure; which is, un∣doubtedly, best provided
for, when <HI>Rival Theatres</HI> contend, which shall, most deserve
Encouragement.—It is worth while, then to examine, how they
<HI>lost</HI> this Advantage. And I take the Fact to be thus.</P>
<P>THE good <HI>Old Patentee,</HI> of the <HI>New Thea∣tre</HI> died,
under a Length of Oppression; and left his <HI>Right,</HI> and his
<HI>House,</HI> to his <HI>Son</HI>; an Unfear'd, and Friendless Youth! of
whom it might then have been said, as of <HI>Chamont,</HI> in the
<HI>Orphan.</HI> 
<Q>His <HI>Hopes</HI> were <HI>all</HI> his Fortune!</Q></P>
<P>HE <HI>Open'd,</HI> against a Tide of <HI>Prejudice</HI>; and
acted many Years, not only, without <PB N="207" REF="208"/> <HI>Favour,</HI> but
almost without <HI>Notice,</HI> at least from the <HI>Fashionable
World.</HI>—He try'd every <HI>Reasonable</HI> Art of
<HI>Pleasing,</HI> without Success!—He reviv'd the best old <HI>Old
Plays,</HI> and brought on several <HI>New Ones!</HI> but had, often the
Mortification to oppose his own <HI>Industry,</HI> and the sublimest
Scenes of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> to the cold Encouragement of <HI>Empty
Boxes!</HI>—What shou'd he do, in this Case?—The Torrent of
Opinion was <HI>against him.</HI> Good <HI>Sense,</HI> and solid
<HI>Thinking,</HI> were as Useless to him as his
<HI>Boxkeepers!</HI>—At last, by a Quickness in his <HI>Natural
Wit;</HI> and a Satyri∣cal Sharpness in his <HI>Observation,</HI> He
perceiv'd he had nothing to do, if he wou'd have the <HI>Game</HI> play'd into
his Hands, but to lay aside his <HI>Judgment,</HI> and abandon Himself to
his <HI>Fancy.</HI></P>
<P>IN Pursuance of this lucky <HI>Discovery,</HI> He compos'd a
<HI>New Species of Entertainment,</HI> which had an infinite deal of
<HI>Sense</HI> in them; but it was only the <HI>Sense</HI> of
<HI>Seeing.</HI>—It is scarce possible to conceive the
<HI>Ease,</HI> which this Reformation of the Stage gave the Bulk of our
<HI>Genteel Audiences</HI>!—They, cou'd, now, laugh out, without
Restraint; for they were no longer in Danger of <HI>being Merry, in the wrong
Place!</HI> They felt no Weight of <HI>Words,</HI> which had formerly <HI>lain
heavy</HI> upon their <HI>Understandings:</HI> And, the Burden of their
<HI>Attention</HI> being, so commodiously, <HI>ligh∣ten'd,</HI> they
<HI>came,</HI> and <HI>saw,</HI> and were <HI>satisfied.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="209"/>THE old <HI>Managers</HI> were indiscreet
enough not only to <HI>envy,</HI> but to <HI>imitate</HI> him.—They made
That their <HI>Choice,</HI> which, in their <HI>Rival,</HI> had been
<HI>Necessity.</HI> But, at∣temping it, with inferior Genius, they
ap∣pear'd so aukward, and ungraceful in it, that they <HI>compell'd</HI>
their partial <HI>Admirers to take Notice, That they were
excell'd</HI>—And, so taught 'em, from that Time forward, to believe it
probable, That, since in <HI>one</HI> Point, they had, so manifestly, the
<HI>Disadvantage,</HI> they might, in <HI>Others</HI> too, have been rather
<HI>Fortunate,</HI> than so <HI>Deserving,</HI> as they had concluded
them.</P>
<P>THUS, the <HI>Young,</HI> and <HI>Oppress'd,</HI> became a a
Match for the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>Prosperous.</HI>—He has continued,
ever since to maintain the Ground he won; 'till the Current is, now, turn'd,
and dispos'd to <HI>run, in his Favour.</HI></P>
<P>SO far, his <HI>Wit</HI> has carried him. We are to look out for
his <HI>Judgment hereafter.</HI> But, for my Part, I am of Opinion, That, when
he shall have <HI>toy'd</HI> us into Good Humour enough to forgive him a
little <HI>Reason,</HI> he will have Courage and Generosity, to restore
the Stage to its Dignity; and exchange our <HI>Ju∣leps</HI> for
<HI>Substantial Diets,</HI> as soon as our sick Stomachs shall have
recover'd Strength enough to digest it.—There is scarce a surer
<HI>Proof,</HI> That a Man has <HI>Worth,</HI> than the Re∣spect, which he
shews the <HI>Worthy:</HI> And I was delighted, the other Day, with the
Praises, in which I heard it told, at an <HI>Assembly,</HI> That the 
<PB N="209" REF="210"/> <HI>OLD BATCHELOR</HI> is, by this Gentle∣man's
Voluntary Offer, to be acted, next <HI>Monday,</HI> at the <HI>Theatre</HI> in
<HI>Lincoln's-Inn Fields,</HI> for the Benefit of so Learned a Benefactor to
the Stage, as Mr. <HI>DENNIS.</HI></P>
<P>UPON my expressing some Concern, That it was not rather a
Play, of Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s own Writing, I was inform'd, That the Master
of that <HI>Theatre,</HI> who sought all Opportunities of shewing his
Esteem of so Excellent, and so Injur'd a Judge of Wit, and Learning, had
left the <HI>Choice</HI> of the <HI>Play</HI> to Mr. <HI>Dennis
him∣self;</HI> who had pitch'd upon the above-men∣tion'd, because it was a
Work of his old Friend Mr. <HI>Congreve.</HI>—I acknowledg'd the
<HI>Generosity</HI> of the Master of the <HI>Theatre,</HI> and the
<HI>Modesty</HI> of the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> whom he treats with so
well-judg'd a Humanity: But I cou'd not avoid indulging a Fit of talkative
<HI>Spleen,</HI> against that <HI>Malice</HI> or <HI>Ignorance,</HI> which
has more than once, appear'd in the Discounte∣nance of some Writings, from
which the <HI>Name</HI> of Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> will, long, continue to receive
Honour, after his <HI>Body</HI> shall be Dust and Ashes!</P>
<P>THE Stupidity which follows <HI>Prejudice,</HI> has made
Thousands of his Cotemporaries insen∣sible of his Great Merit, which, if
they al∣low'd their Reason to examine it, they wou'd be <HI>charm'd by,</HI>
and take a <HI>Pride</HI> to <HI>encourage.</HI>—The Terror with which
young Writers have accustom'd themselves to hear, and to talk of, his
<HI>Austerity,</HI> and of his Aversion <PB N="210" REF="211"/> against
<HI>Scriblers,</HI> has spread abroad a false Opinion, that he is
<HI>Ill-natur'd,</HI> where he is only <HI>impartial:</HI> And, that he is an
Enemy to <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Learning,</HI> while he is only such to the
<HI>Prophaners</HI> of them.</P>
<P>IT is pleasant to observe, to what a whimsi∣cal Degree this
<HI>Dread</HI> of <HI>Criticks</HI> has been propagated; and how far down, into
Low Life, we may trace the Effects of our Poet's mistaken Outcries, who, by
giving their <HI>Shep∣herds</HI> the Name of <HI>Wolves,</HI> have taught the
Clowns to set their Dogs upon 'em, and cut off the Defence of their own Fold.
Honest Mr. <HI>David Cook,</HI> the ingenious <HI>Bell-Man</HI> of
<HI>Pye-Street-Corner,</HI> is, I find, against the Open∣ing of the <HI>New
Year,</HI> under terrible Appre∣hensions, from the Impressions he has
been fill'd with of the Dangers, all Good <HI>Works</HI> are expos'd to.</P>
<Q> 
<L>"<HI>Great Sirs!</HI> my Muse has <HI>You,</HI> her Guardians
chose,</L> 
<L>"Against the <HI>railing Malice</HI> of her <HI>Foes;</HI></L>

<L>"For, she perceives, <HI>these well-meant Lines</HI> must
bear</L> 
<L>"The <HI>CRITICK's Censures,</HI> who will <HI>Nothing
spare!</HI></L></Q>
<P>I WAS visiting, where one of honest Mr. <HI>Cook</HI>'s
<HI>GREAT SIRS</HI> ask'd him, <HI>Why he was afraid of Criticks?</HI> and was
much edified by his Answer—<HI>One Mr.</HI> Pope, <HI>Sir, an
inge∣nious Member, of OUR Fraternity, knows much, of these Matters; and has
said it, in Print, That</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>"<HI>Criticks</HI> proceed, without the least Remorse,</L>

<L>"Seize on our <HI>Fame,</HI> and put their Laws in
Force.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="212"/>THO' I smil'd at the <HI>Turn</HI> of this
Reason for the Fears of so safe a Muse as Mr. <HI>Cook</HI>'s, yet I
can't help wishing, that no great Wri∣ter had ever allow'd himself to join
the com∣mon Cry against Criticks.—If the Poets have <HI>no Art,</HI>
they are a Race of Contemp∣tible Triflers! and if they have <HI>Art,</HI> they
have <HI>Criticism.</HI>—Whoever is a good <HI>Poet,</HI> is, and
must be, <HI>Himself,</HI> a <HI>Critick.</HI>—To be afraid of a
<HI>Judge,</HI> is the Mark of a <HI>criminal Conscience.</HI>—But the
severe, and manly, Censures, which are peculiar to Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s
Writings, have encreas'd the Number of his Enemies, by a piercing
<HI>Sharpness,</HI> which they carry with them? Such Arguers, if they had
liv'd with <HI>Cato,</HI> wou'd have made War upon that <HI>noble
Plainness,</HI> which distinguish'd, and supported, his Cha∣racter: And
refus'd the Reverence, due to his <HI>Vertues,</HI> because His
<HI>Manners</HI> were not supple enough, to fall in with their Notions of
<HI>Politeness.</HI></P>
<P>THE best Way to become acquainted with a Writer is, to look for
him in his Writings:—His <HI>Soul,</HI> which is his Noblest
<HI>Self,</HI> lives there, and is, there <HI>discovered.</HI>—How
often have I remember'd (with Pain, for the In∣famy it must, one Day bring
us) That the most generous, and extensive Design, that ever was conceived
by Man, with Relation to the <HI>Groundwork</HI> of <HI>Criticism,</HI> in
<HI>Poetry,</HI> was once, undertaken, by this Gentleman, <PB N="212" REF="213"/> and a Subscription for it propos'd, upon the most moderate
Terms, with so disproporti∣on'd a Success, that after a Year or two's
fruitless Application, he publish'd a <HI>Specimen</HI> of his intended
Work, with an Apology for not proceeding in it: Because, after so long a
Trial, he had been able to procure no more than <HI>Seventy or Eighty
Subscribers,</HI> whose <HI>NAMES</HI> he printed, to their Glory! For,
they will be read, an Age or two hence, with a Veneration, not unlike That,
with which the <HI>Athenians</HI> engrav'd those of the <HI>Three Hundred
P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>triot Greeks,</HI> who defended
the Streight of <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> against the Fury of the
<HI>Persian</HI> Army.—So, wou'd those <HI>No∣ble Few</HI> have
defended the Honour of their Country's <HI>Judgment,</HI> against an
Inundation, of <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Presumption.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT will make this Fact more wonder'd at, is,—That it
happen'd at a Time, when a boundless Profusion of Encouragement was pour'd
out, upon all Pretensions, but Those of <HI>Learning,</HI> and of
<HI>Modesty!</HI>—But it will not, I hope, be <HI>believ'd,</HI> That
the <HI>Tragedy</HI> of <HI>APPIUS</HI> and <HI>VIRGINIA</HI> was acted, Three
or Four Times, and <HI>forgotten,</HI> in spite of those powerful
Passions, and strong Pi∣ctures of transported Nature, which it every
where abounds with: Or, that <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>CORIOLANUS</HI> cou'd
be alter'd, by such a Hand as Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s, and so strikingly,
to its Advantage, and yet brought on, with∣out Success, where
<HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>RICHARD</HI> <PB N="213" REF="214"/> <HI>THE
THIRD,</HI> rack'd, and mutilated, by a barbarous <HI>Player,</HI> ran into
Fame, and Ap∣plause, and drew Audiences, every Season!</P>
<P>BUT I can never expect Room, in such a Paper as the PLAIN
DEALER, to touch the Merits of this Gentleman's Writings, for whose Benefit,
as above, the Play of <HI>Mon∣day</HI> next, is to be acted: And, who, now,
descending apace into the <HI>Vale</HI> of <HI>Years,</HI> ought to find his
Way made smother for him; and lose Sight of these malignant Enmities,
which his stronger Days have grappled with. There can be no-body, who is a
Friend, either to Learning, or Humanity, and who has his Heart in the right
Place, but must feel a ge∣nerous Delight, in being <HI>present, for His
Be∣nefit,</HI> whose whole Life has been taken up, with <HI>Essays, for
the Benefit of Others.</HI>—The <HI>Brave</HI> and the
<HI>Beautiful,</HI> will agree, in a Resolution, to Shine out, upon this
Occasi∣on, where They will be known to <HI>appear in the Cause of
Wisdom:</HI> And, where, to be <HI>seen,</HI> is to be <HI>honour'd,
Themselves,</HI> for <HI>doing Honour</HI> to <HI>unrewarded

<P>I HAVE somewhere, met with a Story of one of the ancient
Princes, of the <HI>East,</HI> I think, it was ANTIOCHUS.—He was
hunting, and lost his Followers; and Night coming on, after a tedious
Wandering, over Heaths, and Forests he came at last, to a little Cottage,
where the Poor People were at Supper, and enter∣tain'd him, very chearfully, as
a Traveller, who had lost his way. The chief Subject of their Discourse,
was concerning the <HI>King,</HI> and his <HI>Ministers.</HI>—As for
the <HI>King himself,</HI> they accus'd him of <HI>no Vices.</HI>—They
spoke of him with much Duty; and agreed, That he <HI>meant well,</HI> and was
desirous of his Subject's Hap∣piness: But he was not, they said, so
abso∣lutely, the <HI>Monarch</HI> of his <HI>Ministers,</HI> as of his
People: Submitting his own Sense of Affairs, <PB N="215" REF="216"/> and the
Authority of his Determinations, to Men of less Vertue, and Understanding,
than Himself; and giving Way to Ease, and In∣dolence, while he devol'd the
Power of his Office, on Wretches, whose Hearts were too narrow, and their
Passions too violent, to de∣serve any Government at all; much less That
of a <HI>Kingdom</HI>!</P>
<P>THE King said little to all This; but laid it up, for his Use,
and Benefit: And, in the Morning, when his Guards, and the Great Men, of his
Court, having follow'd the Track of his Horse, were come to him, at the
Cottage, he receiv'd them with this Declaration.—<HI>You are mistaken,
if you sup∣pose, I have been, all Night, out of my Way.—I have sat
in Counsel, with an Assembly of the only Honest, and faithful
Advisers, I met with, since I became your Sovereign. Nor did I ever hear a
Word, of the True Condition of my Affairs before I learnt it, in this
Cottage.</HI></P>
<P>THE Condition of a Nation, where <HI>Mi∣nions</HI> have their
Prince in <HI>Pupilage,</HI> is so vast∣ly the <HI>Reverse</HI> of
<HI>Ours,</HI> That a Discourse, on such a Subject must be forc'd to
draw <HI>Exam∣ples,</HI> either from the Histories of Foreign Countries, or
from our own, remov'd, far backward.—But, as the Blessing of a
perfect <HI>Health</HI> is never better understood, and valued, than while he
who is so happy as to enjoy it, employs himself in reading the
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> of some dangerous, and dread∣ful <HI>Disease,</HI>
so the Comfort, which we, <HI>Free</HI> <PB N="216" REF="217"/>
<HI>Britons</HI> must receive, from a Comparison, of our <HI>own
Happiness,</HI> with the <HI>Misery of Others,</HI> is an Argument, which
convinces me, that no Theme deserves, more justly, the Consi∣deration of
a PLAIN DEALER.</P>
<P>I WILL venture to lay it down, as a <HI>Maxim,</HI> That, where
the Soul of a <HI>Minister</HI> is not <HI>Great</HI> enough, to
<HI>overlook,</HI> and for∣give, and to drown all <HI>Personal Regards,</HI>
in the Ocean of his <HI>Publick Cares,</HI> let his other <HI>Vertues,</HI> and
good <HI>Qualities,</HI> be never so nu∣merous, and so shining, he will
confound his Prince's Interest, with his own private Re∣sentments.
Instead of <HI>healing</HI> Divisions, he will <HI>inflame</HI> them; and,
by a Thousand passionate <HI>Extravagancies,</HI> draw upon himself a
Universal <HI>Hatred</HI>; and upon his Sovereign, a <HI>Contempt,</HI> that
is the most dangerous of all Motives to Sedition; and, what wise Princes
have been careful to guard themselves against, by a <HI>Spirit,</HI> and
<HI>Activity,</HI> which, even where they have not been <HI>lov'd,</HI>
serv'd, at least, to make them <HI>fear'd</HI>; which is the <HI>next</HI>
sure An∣chor of <HI>Obedience.</HI></P>
<P>THE Best of Princes have had their <HI>Favou∣rites:</HI> But, it
is the easiest Thing in the World to distinguish the MINION from the
MINISTER. The MINISTER is his Prince's Instrument; The MINION makes an
Instrument of his Prince—Under a MINI∣STER, the common Themes, of all
publick Conversation, are his Great Designs, for the Ornament, or the
Interest of the Kingdom—<PB N="217" REF="218"/> Benevolence, Mercy,
Wisdom, <HI>Generosity,</HI> and <HI>Magnificence,</HI> flow down upon the
People, in a Current of new Laws, and Benefits.—On the contrary, under a
MINION, nothing is talk'd of, but his Subtlety, his Malice, and his
Avarice!—Little Weathercock <HI>Arti∣fices,</HI> and temporary
<HI>Shifts,</HI> and <HI>Expedients,</HI> stand in Place of a steady
Policy, and a manly Course of <HI>Equanimity.—Oppression, Pride,
Suspicion, Faction, Bitterness,</HI> and <HI>Partiality,</HI> are the
Products of his Influence: And the <HI>Law,</HI> which shou'd be the
Measure of his Rule, is the Nose of Wax, to his Am∣bition!—The
MINISTER takes Delight to inquire out Men of <HI>Learning,</HI> or of
<HI>Vertue,</HI> that his <HI>Bounty</HI> may raise them high enough to
shine, like Stars, upon his Administrati∣on!—The MINION hates
<HI>Discernment,</HI> be∣cause he knows himself unfit to be look'd into;
and, therefore, appropriates Rewards, and Preferments, to the
<HI>Mercenary,</HI> and the <HI>Ignorant.</HI>—In short, the MINISTER
is <HI>wise</HI>; But the MINION is only <HI>cunning.</HI></P>
<P>IT is finely observ'd by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> in his
Discourse concerning <HI>Government,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"That <HI>Monarchy,</HI> when its Power is
wisely divi∣ded, among <HI>distinct Counsels,</HI> none en∣croaching on
the other's Boundaries, draws into it self all Advantages, which are
at∣tainable by any of the <HI>Common-Wealth Systems:</HI> But, is in nothing
so weak, and unstable, as in the Folly of partial Kings, who, ruling by
their <HI>Passion,</HI> instead of <PB N="218" REF="219"/> their
<HI>Reason,</HI> remove Truth out of their hearing, and submit their Will
to the Guidance of some <HI>one, sole, Director</HI>; neither examining
Things, <HI>Themselves,</HI> nor allowing <HI>Others</HI> to examine
them.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH a <HI>Political Monster</HI> of a MINION, we read of, in
the <HI>Annals</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"In the Year Nine Hundred and Nineteen, (says
the Author, in his Second Book) <HI>Charles</HI> liv'd, as it were, alone, in
<HI>Soissons</HI>; despis'd, and forsaken, by his <HI>Peers,</HI> on
Account of one <HI>HAGANON,</HI> of <HI>Laon</HI>; a Man, of <HI>vulgar
Extraction;</HI> but who was, solely, trusted with the <HI>King's
Secrets;</HI> and without whose Concurrence, no Mat∣ter of Importance, cou'd
be done, either in the Court, or in the Kingdom. But the Credit of this <HI>New
Upstart</HI> was the Cause of the King's Ruin; for the Great Men
resolv'd, at last, no longer to endure, that such a base Scoun∣drel
shou'd be exalted, over the Heads of the whole <HI>Nobility.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>HAGI-JUSOUF,</HI> a Governor of <HI>Arabia,</HI> under the
Reign of <HI>Caliph Abdulmelec,</HI> met with a Stroke of unexpected
<HI>Satyre,</HI> which gives a lively Representation of the General
<HI>Odium,</HI> these busie MINIONS are always de∣stin'd to live
under.—He was hated for his Cruelty, and Exactions; but carried,
never∣theless, an <HI>Outside</HI> of Charity and Religion. 
<PB N="219" REF="220"/> He met a <HI>Dervis,</HI> one Day, in the Street; and,
having stop't, to give him Alms, re∣commended himself to his
<HI>Prayers.</HI>—The <HI>Dervis,</HI> lifting up his Eyes, to Heaven,
cry'd out, with a loud Voice, <HI>Take him from us, O Great God! Take him from
us, I beseech Thee!—Hagi-Jusouf</HI> was not satisfied with the
Turn of this Prayer; and began to mur∣mur at the <HI>Dervis:</HI> But the
<HI>Holy Plain Dea∣ler</HI> replied, with great Earnestness and
Humi∣lity,—<HI>It is good for you, and for All the</HI>
Mussulmans.</P>
<P>THE Truth is, there is an unavoidable Ne∣cessity, that Princes
shou'd be assisted by such Subjects as they think fit to Favour: But
it is happy, where the Master has <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the Servant
<HI>Moderation:</HI> For, in that Case, the Mischief will be either
prevented, or cor∣rected, before its Progress is become
considera∣ble.—Opinion, and the Obstinancy of Rea∣soning, have made
a mighty Noise in the World, concerning the Differences between
<HI>Arbitrary</HI> and <HI>Limited</HI> Government: But, in the Nature of
Things, there is neither <HI>Abso∣lute Power</HI> nor <HI>Freedom</HI>;
taking them in their full Sense.—Every <HI>Whale</HI> has its
<HI>little leading Fish,</HI> and follows it, with a Kind of unweildy
Obsequiousness! This, in the <HI>Sea,</HI> has been thought a Wonder, but
few Things, on <HI>Land,</HI> are more usual, and familiar.—The most
ter∣rible, of the <HI>State Leviathans,</HI> have been ma∣nag'd, and led along,
by a <HI>Wife,</HI> a <HI>Mistress,</HI> <PB N="220" REF="221"/> a
<HI>Favourite,</HI> or some other such <HI>dimunitive Pilot</HI>: So that
in an unlimited Signification, there is no such Thing as
<HI>Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Grand Signior</HI> it is true, can cause any of his
Subjects to be <HI>Strangled,</HI> without assigning other Reasons for
it, than his <HI>Impe∣rial Will, and Pleasure.</HI> But, how seldom is this
done, at his <HI>own mere Motion</HI>; and how often, at that of his
<HI>Vizier</HI>'s, and tyrannick <HI>Minions?—I my self,</HI> (says a
Writer of the last Age) <HI>have known some Sovereigns, so far Strangers
to what was convenient, that they wou'd scarce grant, or deny, any Thing, out
of the Presence of their</HI> Secretary.</P>
<P>THERE is but one <HI>Consolation,</HI> which can give Men
Patience, while they are <HI>suffering,</HI> under the Insolence of such
Upstart Tyrants: And that is, their reasonable Hope, that they shall live
to see the <HI>Punishment,</HI> when the <HI>Guilt</HI> is ripe enough for
Vengeance—It is long, before a Prince can break out of the obscuring
Mist, which an Evil Counsellor will conjure up, and involve him
in—But, when by Accident, or Reflection, he comes, at length, to clear
his Eye-sight, and see Things, in their proper Colours, the
<HI>Minion,</HI> then first, becomes a <HI>Benefit</HI> to the People he has
injur'd; for he leaves them a Protection, in the Example of his Fall, which may
guard them, in Times to come, against the Malice of a New Oppressor.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="222"/>THE last Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> was
one of the greatest Monarchs, of his Age, and for nothing more celebrated,
than the Vigour, and Strictness, of his <HI>Justice:</HI> But he was warm,
in his Pursuits of <HI>Pleasure,</HI> and impa∣tient of Interruption, when
his Mind was intent upon it.—The <HI>Viceroy</HI> of one of the
Provinces, of that vast Empire that lay most remote from the Imperial City,
had wrong∣fully confiscated the Estate of an honest Mer∣chant, and
reduc'd his Family to the extremest Misery.—The poor Man found means
to travel as far as to the Emperor's Court, and carried back with him a Letter
to the <HI>Vice∣roy,</HI> commanding him to <HI>restore</HI> the Goods, which
he had taken, so illegally.</P>
<P>FAR from obeying this Command, the <HI>Viceroy</HI> put the
Merchant in Prison; but he had the good Fortune to escape, and went, once
more, to the <HI>Capital,</HI> where he cast him∣self at the Emperor's
Feet, who treated him with much Humanity, and gave Orders, that he should
have <HI>another Letter.</HI> The Merchant wept, at this Resolution, and
represented how ineffectual the First had prov'd; and the Reasons he had
to fear, that the Second wou'd be as little regarded.</P>
<P>THE Emperor, who had been stopt, by this Complaint, as he was
going, with much Haste, to Dine in the Apartment of a Favou∣rite Lady, grew a
little discompos'd, and answer'd, with some Emotion—<HI>I can do no
more than send my Commands: And, if he</HI> <PB N="222" REF="223"/>
<HI>refuses to obey them, put thy Foot upon his Neck.</HI>—I implore
your Majesty's Compassion, re∣ply'd the Merchant, holding fast the
Empe∣ror's Robe, his <HI>Power</HI> is too mighty for my <HI>Weakness:</HI>
And your <HI>Justice</HI> prescribes a Remedy, which your <HI>Wisdom</HI>
has never ex∣amin'd.</P>
<P>THE Emperor had, by this Time, re∣collected himself; and
raising the Merchant from the Ground, said, <HI>You are in the
Right—To complain of him was your Part, but it is mine to see him
punish'd.—I will appoint Commissioners, to go back with you, and
make search into the Grounds of his Proceeding; with Power, if they find him
guilty, to deliver him into your Hands, and leave</HI> you Viceroy, <HI>in his
stead.—For, Since you have</HI> taught me how to Go∣vern, <HI>You</HI>
must <HI>be able to</HI> Govern for me.</P>

<P>MANY Writers, besides the Author of my <HI>Motto,</HI> have
observ'd, That the <HI>Lightest Griefs speak loudest!</HI> And, it is
doubtful, whether there wou'd arise most Occasion for <HI>Mirth,</HI> or

noble Loveliness of <HI>Generosity,</HI> That she can neither
<HI>relish,</HI> nor <HI>support</HI> him, but falls <HI>asleep,</HI>
over his Philosophy, as the readiest Way to be even with him!—Yet,
who so lively in her Attention, and so tran∣sported an Admirer of
<HI>this very Seneca,</HI> where he happens to speak <HI>kindly,</HI> of any
Vertue, she is conscious of, in <HI>herself</HI>; or <HI>severely,</HI>
of of any Vice, which she can charge upon Her
<HI>Acquaintance!</HI>—There are <HI>Two Ends</HI> to the Glass, thro'
which we look into ourselves, and others. One <HI>contracts</HI> Objects; and
one <HI>enlarges</HI> them: And, it is the pleasantest Observation in the
World, to remark, how kindly <HI>Nature</HI> has instructed the silliest,
and blindest, of both Sexes, to apply either End of this
<HI>Perspective,</HI> so as to answer their par∣ticular Purpose, with
as much Readiness, and Sagacity, as if their <HI>Wit,</HI> were no less
than it <HI>shou'd</HI> be.</P>
<P>I AM overwhelm'd with Letters of Com∣plaint, against <HI>Fate,
Ill-Luck, Blind Fortune,</HI> and the whole Train of <HI>malevolent
Chimera's,</HI> under whose Shadow it is usual to hide the Effects of our
own Miscarriages.—<HI>Arietta,</HI> a brown Coquette, in her Five and
Fortieth Year of Fluttering, has fill'd Three Pages of an angry <HI>Epistle,
Falsehood, Traitor,</HI> and <HI>In∣constancy,</HI> against a Cousin of
<HI>Ned Volatile</HI>'s, who lov'd her Four Months, and a Week, 
<PB N="225" REF="226"/> and then visited her no more, upon a private
<HI>Intelligence</HI> from <HI>Mrs. Lucy,</HI> that his Name was down, in her

Conquests!</HI></P>
<P>WHAT shall we say to these insupportable Misfortunes? They
must be submitted to, with as much Resignation as the Nature of them will
bear: And, for what remains, I can do no more than provide a little Comfort for
such <HI>afflicted Vertue,</HI> by a Proof, That there are Others, almost
equally <HI>wretched!</HI>—If, therefore, <HI>Arietta</HI> will let me
know what Part of the Town she shines in, I will wait on her, the Day
after, and <HI>apply</HI> a <HI>Letter</HI> to her wounded Heart, which I
receiv'd from a Druggist's Wife, in the City, who had <HI>Three∣score

beautiful!</HI>—But she was <HI>pro∣mis'd,</HI> by her Relations, to
one, whose <HI>For∣tune</HI> is much Superior to my Friends.—Yet, he
had frequent Opportunity of <HI>Discover∣ing</HI> his <HI>Passion,</HI>
but wanted Courage to <HI>declare,</HI> what he, as much wanted Power to
<HI>conceal,</HI> and, so, was forc'd, in Search of <HI>Rest,</HI> to
retire into the Country.</P>
<P> BUT Absence, instead of lessening, in∣flam'd, and
rivetted, his Anguish.—He re∣turn'd to me, in great Disorder; and
deli∣vering a Letter into my Hands, press'd me, with the most moving Words,
and Gestures, to convey it, privately, to the Lady's.</P>
<P> NOW, Sir, you must not start, when I ask you this
Question,—<HI>Whether I ought to deliver it?</HI> The Difficulty lies
here—I know, her Relations have a particular Aversion to this
Gentleman.—And they are Persons, to whom I owe a Thousand Benefits,
and Obligations.—My <HI>Friendship</HI> is dear to my
<HI>Soul,</HI>—and my <HI>Gratitude</HI> is due to my <HI>Honour.</HI> I
wou'd not <HI>appear to betray</HI> Those <PB N="227" REF="228"/> who have
so strong a Claim to my <HI>Since∣rity.</HI>—On the other hand, I was
tender of shocking the Delicacy, and Refinement, of a Passion, so
sacred as our <HI>Friendship.</HI> Love is rash, and distrustful;
takes Alarm at every Trifle; and judges hastily, and with∣out Reason. He
wou'd conclude, if I <HI>re∣fus'd him,</HI> That his Peace, and Interest, are
of no Weight with me.—Wou'd he had thought of <HI>another Means</HI> of
conveying his Letter to the Lady!—But, now, shou'd I advise him to
it, it wou'd look like Cold∣ness in his Cause; and his Imagination wou'd
take Fire, with so many false Apprehen∣sions, That he cou'd never
preserve <HI>Temper,</HI> to consider, That he has push'd me, where there
is no Necessity for it, on the surest Step by which I can incur the
Hatred, and the Reproaches, of a Family, to which I am indebted, for almost
every Thing, that For∣tune favours me in!</P>
<P> IN this Struggle, between the Duties of <HI>Friendship,</HI>
and of <HI>Gratitude,</HI> I can come to no Resolution. I have Friends
enough, on whose Advice, in other Things, I set a very considerable
Value: But, there is no Opi∣nion, I wou'd follow so soon, in a Point of
this <HI>Niceness,</HI> as that of the PLAIN-DEALER. It is the first
Request I have ever made to you; and, I hope, you will not refuse your
Answer.—When I tell him whose Determi∣nation I act by, I am sure,
it will satisfie him: And, if you <HI>deny</HI> me, the Prejudice 
<PB N="228" REF="229"/> may be Infinite.—Let me have but a single
<HI>Paragraph,</HI> to direct me: Or, if that be too much, give me a
<HI>Yes,</HI> or a <HI>No,</HI> at the Bottom of One of your <HI>Papers</HI>;
and it shall be enough, for one of your sincerest Admi∣rers,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>'METHINKS the Difficulty, in this Case, is not so great, as
the <HI>lively Painting</HI> which describes it, makes it appear, upon a
first View.—Since the Lover is so worthy of the Lady, (if he had no
other Means of reaching, or being recommended to her, but thro' the Hands of
<HI>This Friend</HI>) my Correspondent, without all Doubt, wou'd have stood
bound to deliver the Letter; and try the utmost of his Influence, to render
it successful: And the rather, because <HI>Interest</HI> only, and not
<HI>Merit,</HI> seems to have recommended the <HI>Rival.</HI>—But,
since it is so easy to find other Means, as effectual; and the Favours,
receiv'd by my Correspondent, from the Lady's Family, are strong Motives
against his Friend's em∣ploying him, where there is no visible
Neces∣sity, that confines the Choice to <HI>him only,</HI> he appears, to
me, a little <HI>mistaken,</HI> when he strips <HI>Friendship</HI> of
that generous <HI>Freedom,</HI> without which, it can never subsist; and
punishes himself with such inward Conflicts, in Support of a
<HI>Delicacy</HI>;; which, tho' it <HI>beau∣tifies</HI> the <HI>Face</HI> of
<HI>Friendship,</HI> is rather the <HI>Dress,</HI> than the <HI>Body,</HI>
of it.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="230"/>OF all human Passions, this, of
<HI>Friend∣ship,</HI> is the most refin'd, and I might, almost, say
too, the most <HI>ardent.</HI> But I wou'd be un∣derstood to speak of the
<HI>Thing:</HI> For the <HI>Word</HI> is much more common, and less
powerful.—Most People, when they say <HI>Friend,</HI> mean
<HI>Com∣panion,</HI> or <HI>Acquaintance.</HI> But, alas! what in∣finite
Difference!—How Few can distinguish between <HI>Friendship,</HI>
(which is a Parity of Souls) and <HI>Affection,</HI> which is a Claim of Blood;
or a Tye of mutual Interests; or an Agreement, of Hopes, or Fears, or
Principles, or Hu∣mours; or any of these mistaken <HI>Fellowships,</HI>
which are <HI>Parts</HI> of <HI>Friendship,</HI> but <HI>not
Friend∣ship.</HI></P>
<P>I SAID, it was the most <HI>refin'd,</HI> of all our
Passions: And it is <HI>so,</HI> from its Dis-interested∣ness, its
Nobleness, and its Exemption from all <HI>Earthly</HI> Motives. It is a
<HI>strugling</HI> of the conscious <HI>Soul,</HI> to enlarge her
<HI>Limits,</HI> in the <HI>Body,</HI> and exert herself, in generous
<HI>Sallies,</HI> into the <HI>Purlieus</HI> of <HI>Immortality</HI>!—It
is, in∣deed, a <HI>Desire</HI>; but, it is such a Desire, as the
<HI>Angels</HI> burn with!—It is an Exaltation of the <HI>Human</HI>
Nature, by a powerful Mixture of the <HI>Divine:</HI> And serves to give us
an Ideal Fore∣taste of our <HI>Business,</HI> when we shall have
out∣sail'd <HI>Time,</HI> and launch'd into <HI>Eternity!</HI></P>
<P><HI>I had a Friend,</HI> says our immortal <HI>Dryden,</HI> in
some, or other, of his Tragedies;—I for∣get the particular
<HI>Place,</HI> but must, always, remember the Beautiful Description!</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the <HI>AUTHOR</HI> of the <HI>PLAIN DEALER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> HAVING lately met with an Op∣portunity of looking back, upon a
Compleat <HI>SETT</HI> of your PLAIN DEALERS, the last Paragraph, in your
<HI>Paper</HI> of <HI>Mon∣day,</HI> the 9th of <HI>November,</HI> puts me upon
asking, Whether it would not be worth while, to bestow an <HI>Essay</HI>
to shew the <HI>Honour,</HI> as well as the <HI>Profit</HI> of
<HI>TRADE</HI>; in order to remove that mistaken Motion, which
possesses the Minds of the <HI>Indolent,</HI> and <HI>Unthinking,</HI>
Part of our Nobility and Gentry, <HI>That by engaging in TRADE they degrade
themselves?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233"/> YOU will easily prove the
<HI>contrary,</HI> since not only our <HI>Credit</HI> at Home, but our
<HI>Pow∣er</HI> Abroad, is supported by it. Besides which, the Education,
necessary to qualify a Man for a compleat <HI>Trader,</HI> is such, as
becomes a Gentleman of the first Rank. For he should be a Proficient in
<HI>Languages, History, Geography,</HI> and <HI>Mathematicks:</HI> And, in
order to be Master of the Improve∣ments, which may be made, in every Soil,
and Climate, he should know something of <HI>Natural
Philosophy.</HI>—He ought to be ac∣quainted with the <HI>Policy</HI>
and <HI>Government,</HI> of all Nations: And, though he does not immediately
concern himself in the Ma∣nagement of <HI>State Affairs,</HI> yet he should
be <HI>qualified</HI> for a <HI>PRIME MINISTER.</HI></P>
<P> OUR Youth of <HI>Title</HI> and <HI>Gaiety,</HI> are generally
taken with the Character of a <HI>SOLDIER</HI>; and it must be allowed, a
<HI>Noble Employment,</HI>—Especially, when as∣sumed in the Defence
of our Country. But then, it may be remembred, That the Art of <HI>War,</HI>
was introduced thro' the <HI>Corruption</HI> of Mankind, and is always attended
with <HI>Ruin</HI> and <HI>Desolation.</HI></P>
<P> OTHERS, who would appear more polite than their Neighbours,
breed up their Sons to practice the <HI>LAW,</HI>—but I am sorry to
say, that <HI>This,</HI> considered as a <HI>Profession,</HI> is is
attended with Consequencs, as Fatal to Families, as <HI>That</HI> is to
Nations.—For, <PB N="233" REF="234"/> though our <HI>Seats</HI> of
<HI>Justice</HI> are filled with Men, from whom we may expect All, that is
equal and just; yet by the <HI>Turns,</HI> and <HI>Managements,</HI> of the
inferiour Practicers in those Courts, our Approach to Them, is made so
<HI>Intricate</HI> and <HI>Expensive,</HI> that they who are obliged to sue
for their own Right, in the common Forms, are frequently <HI>un∣done,</HI> even
though they obtain the <HI>Verdict,</HI> in their <HI>Favour.</HI></P>
<P> THUS the Properties of the People are render'd precarious, and
many Difficulties are put upon them, in their Pursuit of <HI>Justice,</HI>
by those, who pervert the true <HI>In∣tention</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI>; and
make That a dark <HI>Mystery,</HI> which being the Rule of every Man's
Actions, <HI>should lie open, and plain to his Understanding.</HI></P>
<P> AND, here, I cannot help mentioning a Thing, which, though it
seems but a Tri∣fle, much be allowed to look like a very unreasonable
Hardship.—The Manner of making out, and serving a <HI>Subpoena</HI>
in <HI>Chancery!</HI>—This is a small Slip of Parchment, roll'd up, in
a Lump of Wax, and may chance to be serv'd, in the Coun∣try, upon a Person,
who can hardly read the plainest <HI>English:</HI>—When it comes to
his Hands, perhaps, at first, he is <HI>affraid to break it open</HI>; but,
if he proves <HI>hardy</HI> enough to do that, he is not one Jot the wiser;
for it is wrote in <HI>Barbarous Latin,</HI> with odd unintelligble,
<HI>Abbreviations</HI>; and, in a <PB N="234" REF="235"/> Hand, more
resembling a Set of <HI>Hierogly∣phicks,</HI> than the Letters of a
<HI>Christian Al∣phabet.</HI></P>
<P> THE poor Man, thinking no Harm, lays it by, till his
Convenience serves him, to get it <HI>explained,</HI> by the first
<HI>Great Scholar</HI> he happens to meet with. But, in the mean Time, upon
this Delay, out comes an <HI>Attachment,</HI> and so on, to a <HI>Writ</HI>
of <HI>Re∣bellion</HI>; for no other Reason than that a Man who was bred to
understand nothing but <HI>Husbandry,</HI> could not decypher a Sum∣mons,
served upon him, in a <HI>Language</HI> he never heard of, and a
<HI>Character,</HI> which the Parson of the Parish, might himself, have
been equally puzzled by!</P>
<P> THERE are many other Proceedings in the <HI>Law,</HI> of a like
Nature, which if truly considered, have methinks, but an <HI>odd</HI>
Ap∣pearance, in a Country of so much <HI>boasted Liberty.</HI>—But
if, while we censure, what seems thus unreasonable, in the Method of
some of our <HI>Law-Practices,</HI> it should be alledged, That,
Notwithstanding all this, it has produced many Great, and Useful Men, <HI>I
allow it,</HI>—only it may be worth considering, Whether we have not
more Reason to be <HI>ashamed we stand in need of them,</HI> than to
boast that we <HI>have them.</HI> And I will ask this plain Question, If
that would not be esteemed a <HI>happier Climate,</HI> where there is no Need
of <HI>Physicians,</HI> than where the Uncertainty, or Unwholesome∣ness 
<PB N="235" REF="236"/> of the Air has encourag'd so many of them to settle,
that you are sure of finding a Good One in every Street?</P>
<P> I BEG Pardon for this Digression; but I was led into it by
mentioning the <HI>Law</HI> as a <HI>Profession,</HI> compared with that of
the <HI>Mer∣chant,</HI> in order to engage your more able Pen to show, at
large, how much <HI>One</HI> is preferrable to the <HI>other</HI>; as well with
re∣spect to the <HI>Honour,</HI> as the <HI>Usefulness,</HI> that attends
it—since All, who raise their For∣tunes meerly by the Practice of the
<HI>Law,</HI> or the Success of the <HI>Sword,</HI> must necessa∣rily
do it upon the <HI>Ruin</HI> of <HI>Families</HI> and <HI>Nations:</HI> Whereas
the Generous <HI>TRADER,</HI> while he enriches <HI>himself,</HI> is
spreading Be∣nefits to all about him: From whence we may infer, That
<HI>This</HI> is the Employment, most agreeable to the <HI>Original
Design</HI> of our <HI>Beings,</HI> which was, not to <HI>destroy,</HI> but
to <HI>comfort,</HI> and <HI>cherish</HI> each other.</P>
<P> <HI>MOSES</HI> was a great <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> and
<HI>David</HI> was a <HI>Warriour:</HI> But <HI>SOLOMON,</HI> whom GOD was
pleased to honour, with still sublimer Marks of his Favour, and to whom
He gave the <HI>wisest,</HI> and most <HI>Under∣standing
Heart;—So that there was none like him, BEFORE, neither should Any
rise, AFTER, like unto him.</HI> This <HI>Solomon,</HI> the Greatest King,
the Chosen People of GOD ever had! was a <HI>MERCHANT</HI>; and sent
Fleets, by way of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> to bring home <HI>Gold,</HI> from the
<HI>East Indies:</HI> And <PB N="236" REF="237"/> what <HI>Noble
Monuments</HI> did this Prince leave behind him of his <HI>Wisdom</HI> and
his <HI>Gran∣deur:</HI></P>
<P> BUT we have a living Example in the <HI>CZAR,</HI> a Prince,
who has done more for the Advantage of his Country, and his own Glory, by
encouraing <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> and improving every Branch of
<HI>Trade,</HI> in his Dominions, than by all the <HI>Battles</HI> he has ever
fought.—In fine, <HI>who</HI> has not observ'd, That <HI>our own most
Gracious</HI> SOVEREIGN, at the opening this present Session of
<HI>Parliament,</HI> recommended from the Throne, <HI>the Encouragement</HI> of
<HI>TRADE,</HI> and <HI>NAVIGATION, as the great Means, to Support, and
Establish us.</HI></P>
<P> IF you think any of these Hints can be of Service to the
Publick, you may use them as you please.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I AM perfectly in the Sentiments of the Ingenious Gentleman, who
sent me the fore∣going Letter;—But, the Subject which he has
recommended, can never hope to succeed better, than under the Care of so
able a Hand, as his own: And, for that Reason, I am very desirous of the
Continuance of his Correspondence.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238"/>THE Opinion, That <HI>Merchandizing
deba∣ses Blood,</HI> is a Folly, worthy only of the <HI>Tribe,</HI> to whom
this Gentleman imputes it.—It is a Truth, too well known, that the
INDOLENT and UNTHINKING, <HI>Part,</HI> of our <HI>Nobility</HI> and
<HI>Gentry,</HI> is a very <HI>large</HI> Part of them: But (Heaven be
prais'd!) not at all a <HI>considerable One.</HI>—They are a Race of
<HI>plea∣sant Creatures,</HI> who had the Honour to be born, for their
<HI>own Ease</HI>; but for the <HI>Enter∣tainment</HI> of other
People.—They put me in mind of the Innkeeper in the STRATAGEM, who was
able <HI>at present,</HI> to produce none of the <HI>Good Things,</HI> his
Guests wanted, but had the Satisfaction of, remembring that he could have
furnish'd 'em, All, <HI>if they had din'd with him, last SUNDAY:—No
Matter how pur-blind</HI> a Man of <HI>Quality</HI> happens to be, since he
had a <HI>Great Grandfather,</HI> that was <HI>sharp sighted!</HI> He may
<HI>be, a Fool too,</HI> (HIM∣SELF)—but it ought to be <HI>Scandalum
Mag∣natum</HI> to laugh at him.—For he has <HI>Proofs,</HI> in the
<HI>Herald's Office,</HI> That his FOREFATHERS cou'd <HI>act wisely.</HI></P>
<P>WE have the Comfort, however, to know, that <HI>All</HI> our
<HI>Lords,</HI> are not LORDS OF TRADE: If they <HI>were,</HI> my
Correspondent's Excellent Notions might be urg'd, with an Effect, but
ill-proportion'd to their Value; and fall un∣der the <HI>Noble Eye</HI> of not
a Few able Mini∣sters, of the same Stamp with a famous One, in a late
Reign, who, when a certain Knight, a Great Trader, presented him with a
<HI>Scheme</HI> <PB N="238" REF="239"/> <HI>for the Improvement of
Commerce,</HI> threw it back to him, with a <HI>wise Contempt,</HI> and ask'd
him, <HI>Whether he thought, that Men of HIS QUALITY, had nothing to do but to
read Papers!</HI></P>
<P>TO the just, and lively, Observation, <HI>That a Merchant
ought to be qualify'd for a Mini∣ster of State,</HI> I will add this Wish,
of my own,—That we may, never have a <HI>Minister of State,</HI> who is
not <HI>qualified for a Merchant!</HI>—Not <HI>Trade</HI> alone, but
<HI>Politicks,</HI> would soon feel the Benefit of so <HI>new</HI> a
Regulation.—Yet, there is a Happiness, <HI>still greater</HI>; and it
is the <HI>Last,</HI> the <HI>warmest, Hope,</HI> of those, to whose
successful Industry we owe our <HI>Com∣merce!—That the Way might
always lie open, to the Ear of our Princes Themselves,</HI> without
passing the <HI>narrow Posterns,</HI> which <HI>Truth</HI> is often
oblig'd to <HI>wait at,</HI> 'till it has wearied it self, to no
Purpose.</P>
<P>THE First remarkable <HI>Start,</HI> in the En∣largement of the
<HI>English Traffick,</HI> was made in the Reign of our High-spirited
<HI>Queen Eli∣zabeth:</HI> And to what Kind of Measures it was owing, may, I
presume, be gather'd, without much Difficulty, from the following little
Story, which I have taken out of Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI>'s Discourse,
concerning the <HI>Prerogative of Parliaments.</HI></P>
<Q> QUEEN <HI>Elizabeth</HI> would set the <HI>Reason</HI> of her
<HI>meanest Subject,</HI> against the <HI>Authority</HI> of her
<HI>greatest Councellor.</HI> By her Patience, <PB N="239" REF="240"/> herein,
she raised the ordinary <HI>Customs</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> above
<HI>Fifty thousand Pounds a Year,</HI> without any new
Imposition.—The Lord Treasurer <HI>Burleigh,</HI> the Earl of
<HI>Lei∣cester,</HI> and Secretary <HI>Walsingham</HI> (All <HI>Three
PENSIONERS</HI> to Customer <HI>Smith)</HI> join'd, to set themselves
against a poor <HI>Waiter</HI> of the Custom-House, call'd
<HI>Car∣warden</HI>; and commanded the Grooms of the Chamber not to give him
Admission.—But the Queen, sent for him, on a Peti∣tion, which he
deliver'd, into her Hands, and gave him Countenance <HI>against them
all.</HI>—It would not serve the Turn <HI>with Her,</HI> to be told by
her Great Officers, that she <HI>disgrac'd Them,</HI> by allowing her Ear
to the Complaints of <HI>busie Heads</HI>; and that she dishonour'd Her
<HI>own Dignity.</HI>—She had al∣ways This, to answer—<HI>That,
If Men shou'd complain, unjustly, against her Ministers, she knew
well enough, how to punish them—But, if they had Reason for the
Complaints they offer'd Her, She was Queen of the SMALL, as well as of the
GREAT; and would not suffer Herself to be BESIEG'D, by Ser∣vants, who cou'd
have no Motive for wishing it, but their Interest in the Oppression of
others</HI></Q>

<L>On, to the <HI>Nine and Fortieth,</HI> Toils increase;</L> 
<L>And busy <HI>Hopes,</HI> and <HI>Fears,</HI> disturb his
<HI>Peace,</HI></L> 
<L>At <HI>Fifty Six,</HI> cool Reason reigns, intire,</L> 
<L>Then, Life burns <HI>steady,</HI> and with <HI>temp'rate
Fire,</HI></L> 
<L>But <HI>Sixty Three</HI> unbinds the Body's Strength;</L>

<P>OF the <HI>second,</HI> and more <HI>particular</HI> Kind, I
have met with no livelier Example, than That of the illustrious <HI>Paulo
Paruta,</HI> a <HI>Noble Venetian</HI>; who was sent Ambassador, from his
<HI>Republick,</HI> to <HI>Pope Clement the Eighth</HI>; and compos'd the
following <HI>Soliloquy,</HI> during his Residence at <HI>Rome</HI>; wherein
he briefly Examines the whole Course of his past Life.</P>
<Q><PB N="242" REF="243"/> 
<P> WHERE am I? What am I doing? What am I designing?—I am
hastening already to the <HI>End</HI> of my <HI>Life</HI>; and have hardly
so much as thought upon the <HI>End</HI> of my <HI>Being!</HI>—I am
transported with That which I am not sure to possess, <HI>a Day</HI>;
and neglect to acquaint myself with what I must carry with me, <HI>thro'
Eternity!—Age</HI> has, naturally, a Power to afflict, and mortifie, the
<HI>Body:</HI> Let it now exert a <HI>nobler Influence,</HI> and
<HI>exalt,</HI> and <HI>quicken,</HI> my <HI>Spirit!</HI>—Summon, O my
Soul, thy stray'd, and degenerate, Thoughts; Know the Dignity of thy
Condition; and let nothing proceed from Thee, but what may, truly, be worthy of
Thee.</P> 
<P> I FEAR, if I make a Scrutiny into the Conduct of my Life, I
shall disgrace my blushing <HI>Reason,</HI> by a Recollection of my
<HI>Vanity.</HI>—The Tenderness of my <HI>Infant Years</HI> was too
weak to afford Matter, that cou'd merit my <HI>Age's</HI> Notice; and yet, the
<HI>Tears,</HI> methinks, which it was subject to, might have forewarned me,
That I was ent'ring upon a <HI>Wilderness,</HI> of <HI>Misery!</HI></P> 
<P> IN the <HI>Boyish</HI> Years, which succeeded
<HI>Childhood,</HI> I drew in Pleasure, at my Eyes, and Ears; and gave my
Soul a <HI>Tincture</HI> that prepared it for the Impressions of fu∣ture
Levity.—<HI>Riches, Honour,</HI> and <HI>worldly Greatness,</HI>
glitter'd on me, from a lovely <HI>Distance:</HI> And <HI>Retirement,</HI>
when I <PB N="243" REF="244"/> heard it talk'd of, seem'd <HI>Stupidity</HI>
or <HI>Mad∣ness.</HI>—These Conceptions gather'd Strength, as I
advanced into riper Life, from the <HI>Common Consent,</HI> of all Men, to
practise, and to praise, as I did: And <HI>That most</HI> among Those,
who were reputed <HI>wisest,</HI> and <HI>most happy.</HI></P> 
<P> AT my Entrance into <HI>Youth,</HI> I applied myself to
<HI>Study.</HI>—I delighted, chiefly, in <HI>Rhetorick,</HI> and
<HI>Philosophy</HI>; and, having the good Fortune to meet with Excellent
Masters, I made a swift, and unusual Pro∣gress.—Yet I cannot help
confessing, That it added Fuel to my native Pride. It inflam'd me with a
<HI>Thirst</HI> of <HI>Praise</HI>; and serv'd to countenance that
<HI>Self-Love,</HI> which stood in need of no
<HI>Incentive.</HI>—Knowledge is apt to <HI>puff up</HI> its
Possessors.—I dare not say, I possess'd it: But, if I
should be ask'd, <HI>What Fruit, I reap'd, by my Studies?</HI> I think, I
might venture to answer, <HI>That Philosophy, if it did not</HI> teach
<HI>me</HI> TRUTH, <HI>awaken'd, and prepar'd me, to receive it.</HI></P> 
<P> FOR a while, I was very Earnest in the Study of
<HI>Morality</HI>; and delighted in it so much, that I publish'd a
Treatise, on that Subject: And, afterwards, when I was come to Man's
Estate, I compos'd, in Obe∣dience to my Father's particular Command, an
Elaborate <HI>History, of my Country.</HI>—But, while I labour'd to
contribute toward the Glory of other Men, I pleas'd myself 
<PB N="244" REF="245"/> with a flattering Prospect, That I too, by those my
Labours, should have a Place, in the Temple I was building; and, live, in my
<HI>Fame,</HI> many Ages after my <HI>Death.</HI> Absurd Extravagance of
<HI>erring Vanity!</HI>—As if, what is <HI>nothing,</HI> in
<HI>Itself,</HI> could ga∣ther an <HI>Existence,</HI> from the Opinions of
Others!</P> 
<P> NEXT, I gave myself wholly up to the Service, and
<HI>Government</HI> of my Country; and found my Way so plain, and easy,
that I soon attain'd Great Honours, and helped to fill the <HI>foremost
Employments.</HI>—But, alas! What <HI>Boast</HI> is
<HI>This?</HI>—Am I not sensible, that not only the most
<HI>busy,</HI> but even the most <HI>pleasing,</HI> of my present
Thoughts, will vanish, like a silent Sha∣dow?—All these Dignities,
and Di∣stinctions, these <HI>State Bustles,</HI> and
<HI>Negotia∣tions,</HI> with which my Mind is, so <HI>gloriously
incumber'd,</HI> will dissolve, <HI>like Smoak into the Wind!</HI> or be
wither'd, like <HI>Flowers,</HI> by the Beams of that <HI>Sun,</HI> which
cherish'd them!—Yet, unstable as these <HI>Phan∣tasms</HI> are,
and as I <HI>know</HI> them to be, I must meditate on <HI>Them only.</HI> My
Thoughts, however reluctant, must, at all Times, and in all Places, give way
to the imagi∣nary Importance of these proud <HI>Chimera's</HI>; and abandon
the Contemplation of Things <HI>intrinsically Noble.</HI></P> 
<P> ALAS! how hard it is to serve <HI>Two Masters,</HI> of
opposite Meanings! my <HI>Rea∣son,</HI> <PB N="245" REF="246"/> and my
<HI>Pride,</HI> seem to have divided me, between them.—<HI>Pride</HI>
teaches me to measure my Actions, with Regard only to <HI>outward
Appearances,</HI> by which Men ra∣ther <HI>seem</HI> happy, than <HI>are</HI>
so.—But <HI>Reason</HI> is always whispering me, that
<HI>Pa∣tience, Humility, Mediocrity,</HI> and <HI>Self-denial,</HI> are the
Roads, which lead to <HI>Felicity.</HI>—As I approached to <HI>Old
Age,</HI> I grew, more and more, sensible on which of these Two Sides
<HI>Truth</HI> lay: But I persisted, even against Conviction, and
sacrific'd my <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Rest,</HI> to <HI>Careful Power,</HI>
and <HI>Splendid Misery.</HI></P> 
<P> WHAT, then, do I <HI>wish?</HI>—What is it, that I am
<HI>expecting?</HI>—If I know, that my Pursuits are <HI>Follies,</HI>
what hinders but that I <HI>change</HI> them?—If, after having wasted
the Vigour of my Life, without Advantage from such Applicati∣ons, I am less
satisfied than when I <HI>began</HI> to <HI>live,</HI> Am I weak enough to
hope, That, while, <HI>I, myself, do not change, the very Nature of Things
shou'd alter?</HI> Shall <HI>Disap∣pointment</HI> turn to <HI>Delight,</HI>
because I am fondly <HI>in Love with Pleasure?</HI>—Or shall a
World, that produces nothing but <HI>Cares,</HI> be taught hereafter to abound
with <HI>Comforts,</HI> That I only may be <HI>indulg'd,</HI> with new, and
unnatural, <HI>Satisfaction?</HI></P> 
<P> LOOK out, my Soul, upon these <HI>Ruins,</HI> that are every
where spread round thee! This was, once, That <HI>aweful</HI> ROME! The 
<PB N="246" REF="247"/> Queen of the dependant World!—Where is, now, her
<HI>unbounded Influence?</HI> Where the <HI>Majesty</HI> of her
<HI>Empire?</HI> Where are Her <HI>Treasures?</HI> Her <HI>Triumphs?</HI> and
the dreadful Consequences of a <HI>Thousand Victories?</HI>—Are they
not the Prey of <HI>Death,</HI> and <HI>Time?</HI> Do they not lie
<HI>buried,</HI> in these Heaps of <HI>Ruin?</HI>—And shalt
<HI>Thou</HI> be fond of <HI>Glory?—Thou,</HI> who canst look down with
<HI>Pity,</HI> on the Deso∣lation of a <HI>Power,</HI> that drew a Chain
about the World;—Shalt <HI>Thou</HI> presume to pride Thyself in
<HI>Honours,</HI> or <HI>Distinctions?</HI> or grow <HI>vain,</HI> upon the
<HI>little Preference</HI> of a light, and momentary, Dignity!</P> 
<P> No,—Thou, who hast <HI>Duration,</HI> and
<HI>Stability!</HI> Thou! who shalt endure, <HI>un∣wasting,</HI> thro' the
<HI>Changes</HI> of <HI>Eternity!</HI> consider better the true <HI>Rate</HI>
of <HI>Things</HI>; and proportion thy Desire to their Va∣lue.—If they
are not of <HI>Real Worth,</HI> why then, hast Thou <HI>lov'd</HI>
them?—Why endeavour'st Thou to <HI>retain</HI> them? Why art Thou
<HI>shaken</HI> at a Prospect of thy <HI>losing</HI> them?—Or,
grant they have, in them, any Thing, that may be call'd a <HI>Real Good,</HI>
why, at least, is it not remem∣ber'd, <HI>For how short a Time thou canst
pos∣sess them?</HI></P> 
<P> A THOUSAND Ways, these <HI>worldly Be∣nefits</HI> have it, in
their very <HI>Nature,</HI> to de∣ceive us.—While we suppose their
<HI>Increase</HI> the only Means to make us <HI>happy</HI>; 
<PB N="247" REF="248"/> we, insensibly, become <HI>miserable:</HI> For we
fix our Minds, so intently, upon the <HI>Little we, yet, want,</HI> that we
continue <HI>Dead</HI> to the Enjoyment of All that we were before
possessed of.—The Fear of <HI>losing,</HI> what we have already
got, has a Power to <HI>im∣poverish</HI> vulgar Minds, as effectually as if
they really <HI>possessed Nothing!</HI> And a greater Vexation than
This, the Humane Soul is not capable of being tormented by—Because, as
the Misery is <HI>imaginary,</HI> it is <HI>boundless</HI>; and, as it drew
its Evil from <HI>Depravity,</HI> it can receive no <HI>Cure</HI> from
<HI>Reason.</HI>—Strange Perverseness of our Nature!—We have
our <HI>Happiness, within ourselves,</HI> and are always seeking it
<HI>abroad:</HI>—We have our <HI>Miseries, remote, and without</HI>;
and, yet, are, for ever, <HI>smarting inward</HI>; and transplanting
Tor∣tures, to ourselves, which have no <HI>Roots,</HI> but in our Diligence,
to <HI>excite,</HI> and <HI>nourish,</HI> our own Mischiefs!</P> 
<P> IF we <HI>feed</HI> the Soul with Meat, which is not
<HI>proper</HI> to her Nature, what Won∣der, that she <HI>pines,</HI> and can
never be <HI>sa∣tisfied?</HI>—But, I perceive, while I <HI>praise
MARY,</HI> I am <HI>imitating MAR∣THA.</HI>—I discern the
<HI>right</HI> Way; But I chuse to travel in the <HI>wrong,</HI> till I have
lost my self in its intricate Windings!—I am troubled, and
<HI>busied with many Things</HI>; tho' I know, well enough, that there is but
<HI>One,</HI> of 'em, sincerely Necessary.—<PB N="248" REF="249"/> I
am <HI>birdlim'd</HI> by the tempting World.—I am given over to a Variety
of solicitous, and grinding, <HI>Cares,</HI> which I hug, like
<HI>Blessings,</HI> to my Bosom; and am soften'd, more and more, into
an Affection, and Partiality, for them.—The Love and Gratitude, I owe my
<HI>Friends.</HI>—The Hopes, and Fears, and touching Tenderness, with
which I think of my <HI>Wife,</HI> and <HI>Children;—Domestick,</HI>
and private <HI>Oeconomy</HI>; and the weightier Con∣cerns of the
<HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Common∣wealth!</HI> press my Thoughts, on
every Side, and afflict me with Purposes, dia∣metrically <HI>opposite</HI>
to each other.</P> 
<P> FAIN wou'd I <HI>free</HI> my Soul, and re∣store her to her
<HI>Liberty,</HI> from these <HI>Passions,</HI> which confine, and
torture her: But I nei∣ther know <HI>how,</HI> nor <HI>when,</HI> to resolve
it.—Yet, am I comforted, however, That I feel, in myself, a strong
<HI>Desire,</HI> to exert the Prerogative of my <HI>Reason.</HI> Since I
consider it, as a Sign, that tho' I am not <HI>able to do well,</HI> I retain
the <HI>Principles of well-doing.</HI></P></Q>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<Q> 
<P> THE Wise Author of Nature gave us <HI>Passions</HI> for a
noble End: And, to defend us from <HI>Excess,</HI> our
<HI>Understand∣ings</HI> were conferred, to <HI>regulate</HI> them; And,
least All should prove deficient, out of His overflowing Goodness, He
enriched us with a <HI>Revelation.</HI></P> 
<P> THE Eternal Truths of the Christian Religion, cast a
<HI>Shade</HI> upon the finest, and <PB N="250" REF="251"/> most exalted,
Productions of <HI>humane Lite∣rature:</HI> Which Remark has been fre∣quently
brought, as a Defence of its <HI>Di∣vine</HI> Original, and is really, a very
<HI>strong Argument</HI>; for who can imagine, that without
<HI>supernatural</HI> Assistance, Men of ordinary Condition,
unassisted by the Lights, or Improvements, of <HI>Learning,</HI> should
be able, in various Languages, to lay down such <HI>invaluable
Principles;</HI> a Mul∣titude of which, were vastly preferrable, to any that
had been introduced, by the most penetrating of the <HI>Heathen
Philoso∣phers.</HI></P> 
<P> <HI>SOCRATES, Plato, Epictetus,</HI> and several others, have
<HI>thought,</HI> and <HI>written,</HI> so well, that their Memories
deserve to be highly respected; But what <HI>nobler,</HI> and inimitable
<HI>Morals!</HI> How Ex∣tensive, and yet adapted, to all Abilities, have
descended to us in the <HI>Divine Col∣lections?</HI>—I have often, with
no small Concern, lamented, that the Study of the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> is
so little relish'd; I had like to have said, so much despised, in
in Comparison of the <HI>Pagan</HI> Writers.</P> 
<P> IN the <HI>Schools,</HI> to open an Aquaintance, with the
Politest of the <HI>Classicks,</HI> is un∣doubtedly a commendable
<HI>Outset.</HI> But to be taught, a greater Admiration of them, than of the
<HI>Prophets,</HI> and <HI>Inspir'd Wri∣ters,</HI> is an <HI>Extream</HI>;
and one, that is, more than ordinary <HI>Criminal.</HI>—How com∣mon 
<PB N="251" REF="252"/> is it, to hear Persons expressing their utmost
Fondness for the Former, whilst the Last is seldom mentioned; or,
how∣ever, with much <HI>Indifference.</HI> There are <HI>sublime</HI>
Sentiments in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Authors;—But there is
something, too, which, I cannot forbear to take Notice of, that their
<HI>Characters</HI> were seldom suitable;—One Proof of which
Assertion, we may borrow from <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Life of <HI>Cato</HI>;
Even that <HI>Cato</HI> who was famous for the rigid Stubbornness of his
Morality!—When his Domesticks were worn out with hard La∣bour, or grown
past it, through Encrease of Age, he would dismiss them, and show no
Tokens of further Regard or Huma∣nity: On which <HI>Plutarch</HI> has left us
this Reflection, <HI>That we are not to use unfortu∣nate Wretches, who depend
on us; as we do our</HI> old Shooes, <HI>or</HI> Platters, <HI>and throw them
away, when they are</HI> broken, <HI>and fall to Pieces in our
Service:</HI>—But if it were for nothing better than to express the
Respect, we have for the <HI>Humane Nature,</HI> a Man ought always to
cherish in himself a kind and compassionate Disposition.</P> 
<P> BUT, not to digress farther, There are <HI>infinitely
Sublimer</HI> Sentiments in the <HI>Sacred Writings,</HI> and the Lives of
their Authors shone, illustrious Examples of their Doct∣rine!—How
becoming a great Soul, is, <HI>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord</HI>—<PB N="252" REF="253"/> Again,
<HI>What? shall we receive Good at the Hand of God, and shall we not
receive Evil?</HI>—How Happy would it be for Mankind? if they would feel,
and ap∣ply, to their Practice, the glorious Com∣mands of our Redeemer, <HI>To
do nothing, but as we would be done by</HI>; to exercise our Benignity even
towards those, who <HI>hate,</HI> and who <HI>persecute</HI> us! This
Proposition is contemned by too many, tho' we have it so strongly
recommended, not only by the <HI>Words,</HI> but by the <HI>Practice</HI> of
Him, who <HI>died</HI> for our Salvation! Be∣sides, (as you have observ'd
in one of your PLAIN DEALERS) a Return of <HI>Good Offices,</HI> for
<HI>Injuries,</HI> is, indeed, the sharp∣est <HI>Revenge</HI>; For by
such a Conduct, we triumph over, confound, and disgrace, a malicious Enemy:
As by a contrary Management, we seem to <HI>justify,</HI> as well as
<HI>inflame</HI> him.</P> 
<P> IN Fine, There are a beautiful Variety of Instructions, in Holy
Writ, which can never be parallell'd; They manifest their Heavenly Original;
And, if we make 'em our Delight, will alleviate all earthly Calamity, and
furnish an infallible Re∣medy, for every Accident, that can befal Us. I
design'd now to have ended; but Recollecting, that there are some, who have
little <HI>Faith,</HI> in <HI>Revelation,</HI> I'll go on, a Line or two
farther;—Suppose, we grant their <HI>inconsistent
Hypothesis:</HI> Yet, <PB N="253" REF="254"/> still, it is our Interest to
direct ourselves, by the Measures of <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> be∣cause
it is the truest Friend to humane Nature, and promotes nothing which is not
conducive to our Quiet, and Well-be∣ing; so that, allowing it were not our
<HI>Duty,</HI> it is, however our <HI>Prudence,</HI> to comply with so
excellent, and even so <HI>agreeable a Model.</HI></P> </Q>
<P>SO far, I have entertain'd my Readers with some Reflexions, for
which I am oblig'd to an unknown Hand, on a Subject, where∣on much has already
been written; with less Effect than might reasonably have been ex∣pected,
from the Force, and Clearness, of the Arguments.</P>
<P>IF I am not mistaken, That <HI>Disrelish</HI> of the
<HI>Sacred Writings,</HI> which my Correspon∣dent complains of (tho' I hope
it is far from Universal among us) may be imputed to the low <HI>Spirit,</HI>
and flat, obsolete, <HI>Expression,</HI> of the <HI>coarse
English,</HI> they are <HI>translated</HI> in.—I leave it (says an
Excellent Modern Critick) to our Prelates and Pastors, to consider,
Whether, since they are satisfied, That there is a Necessity for a
<HI>Numerous Style,</HI> in some Parts of our <HI>Publick Worship,</HI>
they ought to remain contented with the <HI>Vile Versions,</HI> now in Use,
and suffer the most lofty, and most pathetick Idea's of
<HI>Religion,</HI> to be <HI>burlesqu'd,</HI> in our Churches?—which is
all one, as if they shou'd dress up a <HI>Bishop,</HI> in some
<HI>an∣tick-Habit,</HI> <PB N="254" REF="255"/> and expose him, every
<HI>Sunday, in That merry Garb,</HI> to raise the <HI>Veneration</HI> of the
People!</P>
<P>IT is finely observ'd, and indeed, unde∣niably demonstrated,
by the same Gentle∣man, in his <HI>Grounds of Criticism in Poetry,</HI>
That, as the Great <HI>Characteristick of Poetry,</HI> is
<HI>Passion,</HI> and the strongest, and most mov∣ing Passions
flow most naturally, from <HI>Reli∣gious Idea's</HI>; For this Reason
chiefly, the <HI>An∣cient Poetry</HI> (where their <HI>Religion</HI> had its
most powerful Influence) has, so visibly the Advantage over the
<HI>Modern,</HI> (which is for the most Part <HI>light, prophane,</HI> and
<HI>contemp∣tible.)</HI> And, for the same Reason too, the <HI>Poetry</HI>
of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> which the <HI>Old Testa∣ment</HI> is, every where,
fill'd with, excell'd That of the Antient <HI>Greeks</HI> and
<HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are numberless Instances, in the <HI>Psalms,</HI> and
among the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and in∣deed throughout all Parts of the
<HI>Old,</HI> and <HI>New Testaments,</HI> of a <HI>Sublimity,</HI> that
exalts the Humane Soul, and shakes it, with a much stronger Degree of
<HI>Terror,</HI> and <HI>Admi∣ration,</HI> than Any, the most noble Strokes
of rapturous <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> which can be met with even in <HI>Homer
Himself.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT a <HI>Collection</HI> of <HI>dreadful Images</HI> are thrown
together in the <HI>Eighteenth Psalm,</HI> to describe the Majesty of
GOD, descending in the Fullness of his Power!—<HI>The Earth
trembles,—The Foundations of the Hills are shaken,—He bows the
Heavens, and comes</HI> <PB N="255" REF="256"/> <HI>down,—and Darkness
is under his Feet!</HI> All This is animated, and wonderful!—But, what
follows, is a Conception, of so immense, and terrible a Grandeur! that our
vulgar <HI>Translation</HI> seems unpardonable, for the manifest
Injustice it has done the Mean∣ing; <HI>Then the Channels of the Waters were
seen: And the Foundations of the World were discover'd!</HI>—But,
see, how This <HI>ought to have appear'd,</HI> in the noble Dress which Mr.
<HI>Dennis</HI> has given it.</P>
<Q> 
<L><HI>Still Darkness</HI> usher'd His mysterious Way,</L> 
<L>And a black Night of congregated <HI>Clouds</HI></L> 
<L>Became the dark Pavillion of his Throne!</L> 
<L>Earth, upwards, from the gaping Center, <HI>cleav'd,</HI></L> 
<L>And <HI>bar'd</HI> the fix'd <HI>Foundations</HI> of the
<HI>World!</HI></L> 
<L>A Sight! that <HI>blasted</HI> even the World's, <HI>Great
Eye!</HI></L> 
<L>And made the starting <HI>SUN recoil,</HI></L> 
<L>From his <HI>Eternal Way!</HI></L></Q>
<P>WHAT comes nearest to This, is, That famous Passage, in the
xxth <HI>Iliad of</HI> Homer, to which also, the Gentleman just nam'd has
given the finest Translation it ever met with, 
<Q> 
<L>Mean while, Majestick <HI>Neptune,</HI> from below,</L> 
<L>The reeling Globe with his huge <HI>Trident</HI> Strook.</L> 
<L>Mount <HI>Ida</HI> trembled, from his hoary <HI>Top,</HI></L> 
<L>And from his <HI>nethermost Foundations</HI> shook.</L> 
<L><PB N="256" REF="257"/><HI>Pluto</HI> starts, frighted, from
his burning Throne,</L> 
<L>And, striking his infernal Breast, <HI>cries out,</HI></L>

<L>Least such another Stroke shou'd <HI>rend</HI> the
<HI>Globe,</HI></L> 
<L>And, on his <HI>pale Dominions,</HI> let in
<HI>Day!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Hebrew Prophets</HI> abound, Every∣where with Idea's, so
<HI>sublimely Enthusiastick,</HI> that they transport and carry away
the <HI>Rea∣der,</HI> with a Power that is <HI>resistless</HI>; and
wor∣thy of the <HI>GOD,</HI> who is honour'd by them!—Among These, the
Description of That De∣solation from the <HI>East,</HI> which was
prophe∣sied against the <HI>Jews,</HI> by <HI>Habakkuk</HI> (as we see
it, in his <HI>first Chapter</HI>) has something in it, so strongly
painted, and so <HI>terrible!</HI> that it strikes us, (thro' the most
un-ornamented <HI>Simplicity,</HI>) with a Force, that was never ex∣cell'd, by
all the <HI>Elaborate</HI> Productions of Poetry!</P>
<Q> 
<P>I will raise up the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> That bitter, and fierce,
Nation! and They shall march thro' the Breadth of the Land.</P> 
<P><HI>THEY</HI> are <HI>terrible!</HI> and their <HI>Horses</HI>
are swifter than <HI>Leopards</HI>; and fiercer than <HI>Even∣ing
Wolves!</HI></P> 
<P><HI>THEY</HI> shall come on, and fly with Violence, as an
<HI>Eagle,</HI> that <HI>hastens to eat!</HI></P> 
<P><HI>THEIR Faces</HI> shall <HI>drink up,</HI> like the

as <HI>Sand.</HI></P></Q>
<P><PB N="257" REF="258"/>THE fourth Chapter of the same Prophet, is

by throwing together <HI>All the Images that occurr'd,</HI> rather than
selecting the most <HI>Essential</HI> and <HI>Impressive:</HI> By
means of which perplexing, and inconsistent <HI>Variety,</HI> their
Reader's Ima∣gination finds <HI>Relief</HI>; from not clearly
<HI>dis∣cerning</HI> their <HI>Object,</HI> through the <HI>Dust,</HI>
which they have rais'd about it.</P>
<P>IT has been observ'd, by the Admirers of <HI>Homer,</HI> That
there is a Similitude, between <HI>His</HI> manner of <HI>Thinking,</HI> and
that of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI> and others of the <HI>Hebrew
Writers,</HI> who ow'd their Excellence to the Inspiration of the <HI>Holy
Spirit.</HI>—Me∣ethinks, this Remark, which is much to the Honour of that
immortal <HI>Greek,</HI> may gather some New Force if we consider
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Description of a Tempest, which <HI>Lon∣ginus</HI> was
so justly charm'd with, and com∣pare it with that of <HI>David,</HI> in the
107th <HI>Psalm,</HI> which has often been mention'd with Wonder, by the
<HI>Criticks,</HI> of our own, and foreign Nations.—Both the

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> YOU appear, by some of your Wri∣tings, to be so heartily a
Lover of the Trade, and Prosperity, of your Country, that I perswade my
self you must of Ne∣cessity, be a Well-wisher to the <HI>honest
Sai∣lors:</HI> A Set of Men, who at the continual Hazard of their Lives,
contribute their <PB N="263" REF="264"/> Toil, and their Skill, to the Power and
Grandeur of the Nation: And, who, al∣lowing <HI>Themselves</HI> no Leisure
for Luxury, furnish <HI>Means,</HI> notwithstanding, to main∣tain the
Luxury of <HI>other People.</HI>—The Sailors, to be short, are a Race
of open∣hearted, gallant, Thinkers, who retain the Plainness, the uncorrupted
Sincerity, and blunt <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Virtue,</HI> which
distinguish'd our Forefathers; and which <HI>Old England</HI> has, so
often, triumph'd by, in Times, whose Customs we rather <HI>admire,</HI>
than <HI>imitate.</HI>—Whatever, therefore, relates, in a very
extraordinary Manner, to the <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Ill Fortune,</HI> of any of
this useful, and worthy Race of your <HI>Kindred Plain Dealers,</HI> I
pro∣mise my self, you will take Pleasure to distinguish, by allowing
it a Place in your Paper.</P>
<P> THE Ship <HI>Bouevia,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> of Bur∣then
about 250 Tun, Captain <HI>Brooks,</HI> Com∣mander; set sail, from the
Coast of <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> on the 25th of <HI>November</HI> last; having
two Pilots, one <HI>English,</HI> and the other <HI>Dutch:</HI> And his
<HI>Wife</HI> was on board, with him.</P>
<P> THE Day had been fair, and clear; but, in the Evening, about
Six, it blew hard at South and by West. The Gale increas'd, into a violent
Storm, and continu'd for about Seven Hours, veering to the West, and North
and by West: During which the Ship was <HI>stranded,</HI> off of
<HI>Enchuysen,</HI> in the <HI>Texel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="265"/> IN order to save themselves, if
possible, the Men all got into the Long-Boat, and were just ready to put
off: But, not having their Captain among them, they call'd to him to hasten
down; because the Sea ran so high, that it broke over the Boat, and
in∣danger'd her beating to Pieces, against the Side of the stranded
Vessel.—The Cap∣tain, in this nice, and perilous, Point of Time,
recollecting that his Wife was Sea∣sick, in the Cabin, cou'd not bear the
un∣gerous Thought of endeavouring to save himself, without her, and was
earnestly la∣bouring to bring her along with him.—But, she, who had
heard the Men cry out, That the Boat wou'd sink, under the weight of two
Persons more, embrac'd him passionately, and refus'd to go.—She
wept, and told him, in the most moving man∣ner, That a <HI>Woman,</HI> in
such an Extremity, wou'd prove a <HI>dangerous Incumbrance.</HI> She implor'd
him not to think of <HI>dividing</HI> his Care; but to employ it all for
Preservation of his single Life, much dearer to her, than <HI>her own
was.</HI></P>
<P> FOR some Time, he press'd her, in <HI>vain</HI>; but
prevail'd with her, at length, to come up with him upon Deck; where the first
Observation they made, was, <HI>That the Boat was out of Sight</HI>; having
been beaten off, by the Force of the <HI>Swell,</HI> that rose between her
and the Vessel.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="266"/> HE was Gazing, Speechless, on her Face,
in a Despair, which he found no <HI>Words</HI> to <HI>utter,</HI> when a
Billow, breaking over the Midship, wash'd him headlong, into the Sea; and
left <HI>her,</HI> shrieking, and alone, be∣hind him, in a Condition so far
<HI>less suppor∣table than his,</HI> that, after a Succession of the
bitterest <HI>Out-cries,</HI> she fell forward, in a Swoon, and sunk
sensless after him.</P>
<P> THE Boat, in the mean Time, endea∣vour'd to return to the Ship;
and passing, providentially near their Captain, who was yet faintly
Swimming, the Men discern'd him, in the Sea, and took him up quite Spent, and
Speechless: In which Conditi∣on, they laid him in the Bottom of the Boat; and
coming along the Ship's Side, one of the Sailors looking up, saw some∣thing
like a Woman, with her Arms and Cloaths, entangled in the <HI>Shrouds.</HI></P>
<P> THIS Woman was the <HI>Captain's Wife</HI>; who, in the Moment
of her falling forward, had been sav'd and supported against that Part of
the <HI>Rigging!</HI>—She was still in a Swoon, and
<HI>insensible</HI>; but so beloved by the Mariners, that they redoubled
their Efforts to get Aboard, that they might have it in their Power to save
her; And they were so <HI>Fortunate,</HI> in their Humanity, that they found
Means to lift her into the Boat: Where they laid her, <HI>Dead in all
Appearance,</HI> by her Husband, who was in the same Condition.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267"/> THEY put off, again; and, with great
Difficulty, got ashore, upon one of the Islands in the <HI>Texel</HI>;
where the Captain, coming to himself, told his Men, That they wou'd have done
more kindly, had they let him perish in the Sea; since the Life, they had
forc'd upon him, must for ever be <HI>imbitter'd,</HI> by the Memory of
<HI>Her un∣happy End,</HI> for whose Sake only, He had thought it worth
wishing for.—His Wife, was now recovering; and near enough to
<HI>hear,</HI> and <HI>answer,</HI> this noble Instance of his
Tenderness.—They flew, astonish'd, and quite lost in Exstacy,
into each other's Arms—And it is easier to <HI>imagine,</HI> than
<HI>describe,</HI> what they <HI>thought,</HI> and <HI>said,</HI> on so
transporting an Occasion!</P>
<P> LET me only add, That this Relation was faithfully taken, from
the Mouth of a Gentleman, who was an <HI>Eye-Witness,</HI> of the miraculous,
and providential, Particu∣lars.—I am,</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> SINCE my <HI>Misfortune</HI> arises only from my having
<HI>succeeded,</HI> to the ful∣lest Point of my own, and my Friend's
<HI>Wishes,</HI> I know not how, in Conscience, I can expect your
<HI>Pity</HI>; but, be that as it will, my Case is somewhat extraordinary;
and I shall fairly <HI>state</HI> it, with the Pur∣pose of serving as a
<HI>Buoy,</HI> for the Warn∣ing of others:—You <HI>must</HI> know, Sir,
I was left an <HI>Orphan,</HI> under the Tuition of a Rich Uncle, who promis'd
to settle his whole Estate upon me at the Day of my Marriage: And that he
might not <HI>cramp</HI> me in my Choice (a Folly too frequently attending the
Caprices of <HI>Old Age)</HI> the only Article he insisted on, was a
<HI>Woman of</HI> <PB N="268" REF="269"/><HI> strict Vertue:</HI>—A
Condition, so very <HI>reasonable,</HI> was sure to meet with an easie
Compliance: And I, so <HI>punctually,</HI> and <HI>exactly,</HI> observ'd
it, that from the <HI>overflow∣ing</HI> of my <HI>Wife's Vertue,</HI> my
Happiness lies under Water.</P>
<P> WHATEVER Mismanagement, or Folly, she happens to be guilty
of, she can im∣mediately set to rights, by the Counter∣poize of her
<HI>Chastity:</HI> And I have no sooner <HI>open'd my Mouth, than she
hits me in the Teeth with her</HI> VIRTUE, the con∣scious Good Fortune of
<HI>coming off, without Cuckoldom,</HI> is, it seems <HI>a Cordial
Prepara∣tive,</HI> that can defend a Husband's Palate against the bitter
Taste of <HI>Arrogance, Pride, Vanity, Ill-Nature,</HI> and the rest of
That long Catalogue, which <HI>Female Purity</HI> is pleas'd, sometimes, to
arm it self with∣al, against the Danger of <HI>Worldly
Temp∣tations.</HI></P>
<P> I SHALL content my self with men∣tioning a few Instances,
that lately hap∣pen'd, upon the Heels of one another.—Amongst many
<HI>Neighbours in the Country,</HI> I can boast but of one <HI>Friend,</HI>
with whom I live in the greatest Intimacy.—He was one Day at Dinner
with me, and said, oc∣casionally, in a laughing way, That there might
possibly be <HI>other Faults</HI> in a <HI>Wife,</HI> as insupportable as
<HI>Adultery:</HI> At this, my <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s <HI>Chastity</HI> flew
out, at her Mouth, and Eyes.—<HI>The Spirit of Honesty came</HI> 
<PB N="269" REF="270"/> <HI>upon her,</HI> and she threw the Spoons, and
Salts, at his Head, till her <HI>Vertue remain'd Triumphant,</HI> and she had
driven her An∣tagonist from Table.</P>
<P> WHILE this Storm was in the Air, there cou'd be little Quiet
under its Influences; so, I judiciously retir'd to a Farm-house; where I
had been recovering my self, about a Week, when a Messenger came with
Tydings, That my spotless Spouse, having heard, as Ill-luck wou'd have
it, that the Nurse to my only Child was a Bastard, had turn'd her away, at
a Mi∣nute's Warning, and kill'd the Child, in Three Days after, by
persisting in a Resolu- to <HI>wean</HI> it, from a Milk of so
<HI>wicked an Original!</HI> Upon this melancholly Account, I hurried Home,
where I had the Comfort to be convinc'd, that I ought, by no Means, to be
sorry, for the Death of my Child, since my Wife's <HI>Vertue</HI> was
<HI>yet alive,</HI> and her <HI>Modesty</HI> preserv'd
<HI>inviolate.</HI></P>
<P> NOW, Sir, what is to be done in such a Case?—I wou'd
tell her, if I durst; (nay, I will, if you are so kind, as to <HI>stand
by me), That</HI> the <HI>Vertue</HI> of a Man's <HI>Wife, will</HI> never
attone for the <HI>Loss of his Friend:</HI> And that her <HI>Chastity</HI>
is the worst Remedy, she cou'd have thought on, to supply the Loss of a
<HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Heir.</HI>—Nay, if she shou'd not believe me, I
am determin'd (if you think there may be no <HI>Danger</HI> in it) to let her
alone to try the Experiment.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="271"/> SIR, I have fairly told you my Story, and
beg you will expatiate upon the Sub∣ject. Pray give a little of your
seasonable Advice to these Professors of <HI>Grace with∣out
Gracefulness.</HI>—Perswade 'em, if you can, to consider, That a
Wife's <HI>Cha∣stity,</HI> is in the Nature of <HI>Laudanum</HI> to her
Husband; a just Quantity promotes <HI>Rest:</HI>—Too little
occasions <HI>Restless∣ness,</HI> and too much gives convulsive
<HI>Rav∣ings:</HI>—Such a desperate Old Gentle∣man as <HI>you</HI> are,
may venture to say, too, That <HI>Continency,</HI> by
<HI>Constitution,</HI> is rather a <HI>Happiness,</HI> than a
<HI>Vertue:</HI> And, that a Wife, who sets up her <HI>Chastity,</HI> as a
<HI>Spe∣cifick,</HI> to cure all Uneasinesses, is more in∣supportable,
than a <HI>Quack,</HI> who can cure, only, the <HI>Tooth-ach,</HI> and
maintains (for that Reason) that the <HI>Stone,</HI> the <HI>Gout,</HI> and

<P>INSTEAD of complying with the Request of my Correspondent, and
coming in, to his Assistance, against so <HI>impenetrable</HI> a
Champio∣ness; I shall add to his Complaint, as just a one of my
own.—<HI>That I, too, lose my Rest, by</HI> WOMEN.—What they
<HI>do,</HI> or what they <HI>suffer,</HI> is for ever invading, and
over∣whelming, my Purposes.—Their <HI>Charms,</HI> 
<PB N="271" REF="272"/> and their <HI>Mischefs,</HI> press in upon me, from
Town, and Country.—The <HI>Post groans</HI> as we do, under the Burthen
of their <HI>Vanities.</HI>—But, what I think ought to be reckon'd among
my <HI>Sufferings not deserv'd,</HI> is,—That it often costs me a
<HI>Groat,</HI> to read one of their <HI>Secret Histories,</HI> not worth a
<HI>Half-penny.</HI> My Intelligencers, from remote Quar∣ters, make no manner
of Conscience in their Correspondence, with me.—For, while they
<HI>charge</HI> the <HI>Follies</HI> they acquaint me with, upon those to
whom they belong; They take care to charge the <HI>Postage</HI> upon a
Person, who is <HI>wholly Innocent.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS lately in Despair of working any Reformation upon
Offenders, who possess the Power of <HI>bewitching</HI> those who
examine them: But there came to my Hands, some Time since, a short
Treatise, in Manuscript, sub∣scrib'd by Seven Ladies, its Authors; who
intitle themselves <HI>The Order of Angels.</HI> Into this Order, they tell
me, they propose to ad∣mit all the BELIEVING <HI>Fair,</HI> (which, if they
do, they can never fail of a most <HI>comprehensive</HI>
Establishment!) The Business, they are to be <HI>admitted for,</HI> is,
to learn, it seems, to CON∣CEIVE <HI>after a new Manner,</HI> so as to be
<HI>brought to Bed of themselves</HI>; and, by Virtue of such <HI>New
Birth,</HI> be made <HI>Kings,</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> and
become what All the Best of them were, at first, created by the Lord to be,
<HI>Real, Blessed, Heavenly,</HI> ANGELS.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="273"/>THESE being the Words of the Ladies
Treatise, I am restor'd to some Degree of Hope; and shall shortly
form a Resolution to disburthen myself of a Care I am <HI>unequal</HI> to,
and deliver over the <HI>whole Sex,</HI> into the Hands of these <HI>Able

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I HAVE been so unhappy, for this great while, as to indulge a
Passion for a young Lady; in whom I thought I might reason∣ably promise
my self an agreeable Compa∣nion, and a virtuous Wife. But alas! how vain and
uncertain are all our Hopes! A near Relation of mine, who married her Sister,
by Errors, and Misfortunes, (which generally go together) is <HI>well nigh
reduced,</HI> which, I am too sensible hath created a <HI>Prejudice to our
Family.</HI> My present Cir∣cumstances <PB N="273" REF="274"/> are such as
I think could not well be excepted against; but am so well acquainted with
the Effects of <HI>Prejudice,</HI> that I dare not hazard revealing my Mind;
fearing it may totally debar me, the Satis∣faction, which I, sometimes (but
alas! seldom) enjoy, of being in her Company.</P>
<P> AS She is your constant Reader, the in∣certing this in one of
your Papers, may, very possibly, incite her to pity him who <HI>loves</HI>
too well to <HI>dare</HI> to <HI>offend.</HI> Hoping Fortune may some time
offer the happy Means of possessing her; the only Object of my
Desires. Excuse this Trouble.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> IN Return for that Pleasure with which I have read your
Abridgment of <HI>PA∣RUTA</HI>'s <HI>Soliloquy,</HI> in one of your late
<HI>Papers,</HI> I send you an Abstract from a much more modern Treatise,
Intitled, <HI>An Enquiry into the Nature of Society,</HI> wherein the Author
has consider'd <HI>Hypocrisie,</HI> as it is the Effect of our Common
<HI>Self-Love,</HI> in a manner, that is equally new, and delightful; and with
a <HI>Penetration,</HI> as Remarkable as the <HI>Plea∣santry</HI> of his
Images.—In short, His <HI>De∣scriptions</HI> appear to me so full
of Nature, Wit, and Liveliness, that I believe they cannot fail to give great
Pleasure to your Readers: And, for that Reason, I have transcrib'd what
follows, and send it you, for their Entertainment.</P>
<Q><PB N="276" REF="277"/> 
<P> THEY (says this too near Observer) who have never taken
Notice of the Conversa∣tion of a <HI>Spruce Mercer,</HI> and a <HI>Young
Lady,</HI> his Customer, who comes to his Shop, have neglected a Scene of
Life, that is very <HI>en∣tertaining.</HI>—HIS Business is, to sell
as much Silk as he can, at a Price by which he shall get what he
proposes:—As to the <HI>Lady,</HI> what SHE would be at is, to please
her Fan∣cy, and buy cheaper by a Groat or Six∣pence a Yard, than the Things,
she wants, are commonly sold at.</P> 
<P> FROM the Impression, the Gallantry of our Sex has made
upon her, she imagines, That she has a fine <HI>Mein,</HI> and easie
<HI>Beha∣viour,</HI> and a <HI>peculiar Sweetness</HI> of
<HI>Voice:</HI>—That she is <HI>handsome</HI>; and, if not
<HI>beauti∣ful,</HI> at least more <HI>agreeable,</HI> than most young
Women she knows.—As she has no Pretensions, to purchase Things
with <HI>less Money</HI> than other People, except those, which are built
on her <HI>Good Qualities,</HI> so she sets herself off, to the best
Advantage her Wit, and Discretion, will let her.—The Thoughts of
<HI>Love</HI> are here out of the Case: So, on one Hand, she has no Room
for playing the <HI>Tyrant</HI>; and giving herself <HI>angry,</HI> or
<HI>peevish</HI> Airs; And, on the other, she has more Liberty of
<HI>speaking kindly,</HI> and being <HI>affable,</HI> than she can have, on
almost any other Occasion.—She knows, that Abundance of well-bred
People come to his Shop; and endeavours to render herself 
<PB N="277" REF="278"/> as <HI>amiable,</HI> as Vertue, and the Rules of
Decency, allow of.</P> 
<P> BEFORE her Coach is yet quite stopp'd, she is approach'd
by a <HI>Gentleman-like Man,</HI> who has every thing <HI>clean,</HI> and
<HI>fashionable,</HI> about him: And who, in low Obeisance, pays her
Homage, and hands her into the Shop.—There, immediately, he slips from
her; and through a Bye-Way, that remains visible, only for half a Moment,
with great Address, <HI>entrenches</HI> himself behind the
<HI>Coun∣ter</HI>; whence, <HI>facing</HI> her, with a profound
<HI>Reverence,</HI> he begs the Favour of <HI>knowing her Commands,</HI></P> 
<P> LET her say, and dislike, what she plea∣ses, she
can never be directly <HI>contradicted:</HI> She deals with a Man, in whom,
consum∣mate <HI>Patience</HI> is one of the <HI>Mysteries</HI> of his
<HI>Trade.</HI> Whatever Trouble she creates, she is sure to hear nothing
but the most <HI>oblig∣ing Language,</HI> and has always before her a
chearful Countenance, where <HI>Joy,</HI> and <HI>Re∣spect,</HI> seem to be
blended with <HI>Good Humour,</HI> and altogether make up an <HI>artificial
Sere∣nity,</HI> more engaging than <HI>untaught Nature</HI> is able to
produce.</P> 
<P> WHEN Two Persons are so well met, the Conversation
must be very agreeable, as well as extreamly mannerly, tho' they talk, about
Trifles. While <HI>she</HI> remains ir∣resolute what to <HI>take, he</HI>
seems to be the same, in <HI>advising</HI> her: But, when once she has
<HI>chosen,</HI> he immediately becomes <HI>positive,</HI> 
<PB N="278" REF="279"/> That it is the <HI>Best of the Sort.</HI> He
con∣tinues to extol her Fancy; and, the oftener he looks upon it, the more he
<HI>wonders,</HI> that he shou'd not, <HI>before</HI> have discover'd the
Pre-eminence of it, over any Thing he has in his Shop.—He founds her
Capacity, finds out her Blind-side; and, by Fifty little Stratagems, makes
her <HI>overvalue</HI> her own Judgment, as well as the Commodity she wou'd
purchase.</P> 
<P> THE greatest Advantage he has over her, lies in the most
material Part of the Com∣merce between them, the <HI>Debate</HI> about the
<HI>Price</HI>; which <HI>he</HI> knows, to a Farthing, and <HI>she</HI> is
wholly ignorant of: Therefore, he no where more egregiously imposes on her
Understanding. But, tho' he has, here, the Liberty of telling what
<HI>Lies</HI> he pleases, as to the <HI>Prime Cost,</HI> and the Money he
has <HI>refus'd,</HI> yet he trusts not to <HI>Them only.</HI> He attacks her
<HI>Vanity,</HI> and makes her <HI>be∣lieve</HI> the most <HI>incredible</HI>
Things in the World, concerning <HI>His Weakness,</HI> and her own
<HI>Su∣perior Abilities.</HI>—He had taken a Resolu∣tion (he says)
never to part with that Piece, under such a Price.—But she has the
Power of <HI>talking</HI> him out of his Purposes. He protests, must
<HI>lose</HI> by her; but, since she seems to <HI>have a Fancy for
it,</HI> and is <HI>resolv'd</HI> to give no more, rather than diso∣blige a
Lady he has so extraordinary a Va∣lue for, <HI>He will let her have
it.</HI>—Only begs, <PB N="279" REF="280"/> That <HI>another Time</HI>
she won't stand so hard with him.</P> 
<P> IN the mean Time, the Buyer, who <HI>knows, that she is no
Fool;</HI> and has a <HI>volu∣ble Tongue,</HI> is easily perswaded, that
she has a very winning Way of talking: And, thinking it sufficient, for the
Sake of <HI>Good-breeding,</HI> to disown a Sense of her Merit, in some
witty <HI>Repartee,</HI> she swallows, very contentedly, the Substance of
every Thing he has told her: And the Upshot is, That with the
<HI>Satisfaction</HI> of having <HI>sav'd Nine∣pence a Yard,</HI> she has
bought her Silk ex∣actly at the same Price as any Body else might have had
it for.</P> 
<P> IT is possible, that this Lady, for want of being
sufficiently <HI>flatter'd,</HI> or for a Fault she is pleas'd to find in
his Behaviour; or, perhaps, in the <HI>Tying</HI> of his <HI>Neckcloth</HI>;
or, for some other Dislike, <HI>as Substantial,</HI> may be
<HI>lost</HI>; and her Custom bestow'd on some other of the Fraternity.
But, where many of them live in a Cluster, It is not easily de∣termin'd
which Shop to go to: And the Reasons, some of the Fair-Sex have for their
Choice are often very <HI>whimsical,</HI> and and kept as a <HI>Great
Secret.</HI>—Among the Mercers, a Fair-Dealer must keep before his own
Door; and, to draw in random Cu∣stomers, make use of no other Importuni∣ty,
than an <HI>Obsequious Air</HI>; and a <HI>Bow,</HI> to every well-dress'd
Female, that offers to look towards his Shop.</P> 
<P><PB N="280" REF="281"/> BUT, I have seen another Method o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Inviting Customers,</HI> the
most distant in the World from what I have been speaking of.—I
mean, that, which is practis'd by the <HI>Water∣men,</HI> on those, whom, by
their Mien, and Garb, they know to be <HI>no Londoners.</HI>—It is
pleasant to see half a Dozen of these <HI>Tritons</HI> surround a Man,
whom they never saw in their Lives before, and Two of them, who can get
nearest, clapping Each an Arm over his Neck, hug him, as familiarly, as if he
was their Brother, newly return'd from an <HI>East-India Voyage:</HI> A Third
lays hold of his Hand,—Another of his Sleeve,—His Coat—the
Buttons of it—or any thing he can come at: While a Fifth, or a Sixth, who
has scamper'd twice round him already, without being able to get at him,
plants himself directly <HI>before</HI> the Man in <HI>Hold</HI>; and, within
Three Inches of his Nose, con∣tradicting his Rivals with an open-mouth'd Cry,
shews him a dreadful Set of large Teeth, and a Remainder of Bread and
Cheese, which the Country Man's Arrival had hinder'd him from
swallowing.</P> 
<P> AT <HI>all This</HI> no Offence is taken. The Peasant
thinks <HI>they are making much of him</HI>; and, therefore, far from
opposing them, he patiently suffers himself to be push'd, or pull'd,
which way they direct.—He has not Delicacy to find Fault with their
<HI>Dirt,</HI> and <HI>Sweat</HI>; for he has been us'd to it, from his Cradle:
And it is no Disturbance to <PB N="281" REF="282"/> him, to hear half a Score
People, some of them at his Ear, and the farthest not Five Foot from him,
<HI>bawl out,</HI> as if he was a Hundred Yards distant.—He is
consci∣cious, that he makes no less Noise, when he is merry,
<HI>Himself</HI>; and is secretly <HI>pleas'd,</HI> with their boisterous
Usage. The hawling, and pulling him about, he construes, as a
<HI>Courtship,</HI> which he can <HI>feel,</HI> and <HI>understand:</HI>
And he can't help wishing them well, for the Esteem they seem to have for
him.</P> 
<P> HE loves to be <HI>taken notice of,</HI> and ad∣mires the
<HI>Londoners</HI> for being so Earnest in their Desires to
<HI>serve</HI> him, for the Value of <HI>Threepence:</HI> Whereas, in the
Country, he must first tell People what he wants, and tho' he lays out
Three or Four Shillings, he has hardly a Word spoke to him, unless it is in
Answer to the Questions he is forc'd to ask them! This <HI>Alacrity</HI> in
his Behalf, moves his Gratitude, to all the Watermen, and being unwilling to
<HI>disoblige any,</HI> he knows not which of them to pitch upon—I have
<HI>seen</HI> a Man <HI>think</HI> all this, or some∣thing like it, as
plainly as the Nose, in his Face: And move along, all the while, very
contentedly, under a <HI>Load</HI> of <HI>Solici∣tors,</HI> carrying down to
the Waterside, with a smiling Countenance <HI>Seven</HI> or <HI>Eight
Stone</HI> more than his <HI>own Weight.</HI></P> </Q>
<P>THERE is something, so strongly touch'd, so
<HI>picturesque,</HI> and so diverting, in these Two 
<PB N="282" REF="283"/> Descriptions, that I cou'd not resist the
Temptation I was under to send 'em you, with my Request, That you would

<P>IN the Decision of that Important <HI>Questi∣on, What is

<HI>DEATH,</HI> stand out, <HI>distinguish'd:</HI> And two of my
Correspondents have given me an Opportu∣nity <PB N="283" REF="284"/> of
placing both these <HI>Invincible Powers</HI> in full View, near one another:
A Position, which, like the <HI>Contraste,</HI> observ'd in the

off, and throws forward, every Object, by its OPPOSITE; and <HI>rounds,</HI>

<P>I SHALL introduce the <HI>Lover's</HI> Letter by a Reflection,
concerning the Impossibility of <HI>describing</HI> Love, and the
Benefits, which <HI>So∣ciety</HI> owes this Passion; from a Poetical

paint:</L>
<L>Forgetful, that, of old, they <HI>veiled</HI> his Face;</L>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> EVER since you have oblig'd the World with your Paper, I have
taken a great deal of Pleasure in reading it; such just
<HI>Sentiments,</HI> and your <HI>peculiar Method</HI> of <HI>Plain
Dealing,</HI> must charm the intelligent, and give Satisfaction to every one,
who is susceptible of Tenderness and Good Na∣ture.</P>
<P> AMONG the Subjects, which you have cursorily touch'd on,
LOVE, that Hea∣venly Passion, (notwithstanding your <HI>grand
Climacteric</HI>) seems to claim a considerable Share in your
Composition; else, how could you so tenderly express your self
concern∣ing the Affair of <HI>Lucinda?</HI> With what En∣ergy did you
Discourse! Humanity ap∣pear'd in every Word, and I believe it
im∣possible for the most Ardent LOVER, to speak of Love, with greater
<HI>Emotion,</HI> than you did in that Beautiful PLAIN DEALER.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="286"/> I HAVE for some time been <HI>in
Love,</HI> with a Woman, invested with all the Gra∣ces which accomplish the
Sex; And, as I am entirely <HI>devoted</HI> to that Passion, when I read
that Paper, of <HI>Lucinda,</HI> I felt within me something <HI>new,</HI>
That argued still, for <HI>Love</HI>; something, so natural, so moving!
that it was impossible for one, in my Circum∣stance, to withstand it.
The Opinion I had already conceiv'd of my <HI>Beautiful Di∣sturber,</HI>
heighten'd by a growing and ver∣tuous Passion, made me a Thousand times
delight my self with an Imagination, that my <HI>Emilia</HI> resembled
<HI>Lucinda!</HI> The Love I bear this most agreeable Woman, has so deeply
rooted it self in my Heart, that nei∣ther <HI>Time</HI> nor
<HI>Accident,</HI> can eradicate it.—All my Thoughts center in her, and
when <HI>absent</HI> from <HI>her,</HI> I have lost the <HI>Soul,</HI> that
<HI>animates</HI> my <HI>Life,</HI> and my <HI>Mind</HI> is as effe∣ctually
<HI>Dead,</HI> as my <HI>Body</HI> will be, when <HI>I am no more,</HI> and
shall have learnt the Pow∣er of <HI>forgetting</HI> her.</P>
<P> MY Passion for this <HI>dear Creature</HI> has been
sometime <HI>Dormant:</HI> About two Years ago, my Affairs obliged me to go
Abroad, when our Acquaintance was but little cultiva∣ted; yet, an Infant
Passion, even then made me solely <HI>her</HI> Admirer: Such <HI>Beauty,
Good-Nature, Wit,</HI> and lively <HI>Conversation,</HI> as are rarely to be
met with in one Person, so captivated me, that I could think of nothing but
the <HI>dear Emilia.</HI>—When I <PB N="286" REF="287"/> return'd Home, my
Passion encreased daily, insomuch, that at this Time I am a Stran∣ger
to every Thing in the World, but <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Emilia!</HI> without
<HI>her,</HI> I shall be the most unhappy Man alive.—I dread the
Thoughts of <HI>her</HI> being <HI>unkind,</HI> and Hea∣ven grant, they may be
groundless!—I have declar'd my Passion to <HI>her,</HI> and, if I
don't flatter my self, she <HI>appears</HI> to have some regard for me;
this you will readily conclude gives me <HI>Hope; but,</HI> alas! <HI>I
fear</HI> too, or I shou'd be <HI>no Lover.</HI></P>
<P> OUR Circumstances are very different, and we seem in this
Case only, to be <HI>Diffi∣dent</HI> in one another; As for my Part, a
<HI>genteel Employment</HI> is the only Fortune I have to trust to, and
therefore, according to the laudable Custom of <HI>Bargain</HI> and
<HI>Sale,</HI> in the Affair of <HI>Marriage,</HI> I am afraid I have too
<HI>little Plea that Way</HI>; yet, she is entirely at her own Disposal,
and can, <HI>with∣out asking any Body Leave,</HI> make me the <HI>happiest
Man on Earth.</HI>—Dear Mr. <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> as you have been an
Advocate for <HI>Lucinda,</HI> I beg a little of your Assistance; What
must I do? without her I am inevi∣tably lost, and am afraid it may be so,
if you don't intervene with your <HI>good Advice</HI>; I beg you to publish
this, in your next; it may have some Effect on the <HI>dear Emilia</HI>; I am
almost perswaded she does not <HI>hate</HI> me; And, yet when I reflect
on the <HI>merce∣nary Ways of the World,</HI> I am plung'd into the utmost
<HI>Despair.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="288"/> SIR, As you are a Man of Reason, make
not <HI>light</HI> of my Condition, but exert your self to
<HI>assist</HI> me; I am afraid I have exceed∣ed the Bounds of a Letter,
pray correct the Mistakes in Sense. I forget every Thing but the <HI>dear
Emilia.</HI>—Angels <HI>protect</HI> her, and make her <HI>kind!</HI>
Your Advice, how to proceed, will be very grateful, and your publishing This,
save me a great deal of Confusion: For she will know it comes from me, by
a Declaration in it, which none else can perceive.</P>

graceful, is now become a Thing so full of <HI>Horror,</HI> that
<HI>Children</HI> are afraid to look upon it; and must, therefore, be
transmitted from its Pleasures, and its Pas∣sions,—from all the
Scences of its inchant∣ing Blandishments, to a dark and silent
<HI>Grave.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is even the Difference of <HI>two seve∣ral Worlds,</HI>
betwixt a King, <HI>enamel'd</HI> with his Robes and Jewels, sitting in his
Imperial <HI>State</HI>; and his Posture, Figure and Condition when
consign'd to his Six Foot of Royalty, to his <HI>Box</HI> of everlasting
Obscurity. And yet this <HI>Change</HI> is without any visible,
substan∣tial, <HI>Diminution:</HI> All the <HI>Limbs</HI> remain per∣fect,
as they were, without Dislocation, or Contraction.—Whence
<HI>Scaliger</HI> defines Death to be but the <HI>Cessation of the Soul's
Functions:</HI> As if it were rather a <HI>Restraint,</HI> than a
<HI>Disso∣lution.</HI> What seems wanting, is chiefly <HI>Colour,
Heat,</HI> and <HI>Motion</HI>; yet, that gross Object, which is left to the
Spectator's Eyes, remains <PB N="289" REF="290"/> remains now but a Compound of
the two ignobler Elements, <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI>; while the two
purer, <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Air</HI>; are winged away, as fitter Attendants on
the <HI>Soul,</HI> than on the extinguish'd <HI>Body.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN this happens to one, whose Conver∣sation hath indeared
him to us, when we see his Eyes <HI>put on Death,</HI> and hear the
<HI>tolling Bell</HI> give publick Notice of it, what Soul can <HI>then</HI>
lose a Thought on the fugitive Joys of <HI>Pleasure!</HI> What a
<HI>Bubble,</HI> what a <HI>Puff,</HI> what a <HI>Wink</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> is
Man! And with what a general, and sure, Success, does Death stand over
Humane Nature, always <HI>striking,</HI> here and there, and exercising an
unbounded <HI>Triumph!</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE, lately, from such a Sight as <HI>This,</HI> learnt both
<HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Elevation:</HI>—The One, to lower my Esteem
of a <HI>Body,</HI> which must, one Day perish in unlovely
<HI>Rottenness.</HI>—The other, to Reverence a <HI>Soul,</HI> which
af∣ter having liv'd here but as a <HI>Sojourner,</HI> reas∣cends, when its
House of Flesh is demolish'd, with a Vigour as unrestrain'd, and an
Essence as refin'd and glorious, as the <HI>un-imbodied,</HI> and
coelestial, <HI>Angels!</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Mr. <HI>PLAIN DEALER,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> HUMANITY has instructed me, That he who lets a <HI>Secret
die</HI> with him, from the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of which the <HI>World</HI>
might receive <HI>Benefit,</HI> is an Enemy to the Good of Mankind, and a
Dishon∣our, and Misfortune, to his Country.—Physicians may boast,
as they please, of the Vertues of their <HI>Simples,</HI> I know a
<HI>Com∣pound,</HI> call'd <HI>Flattery,</HI> that is a better <HI>Re∣medy</HI>
than any of 'em.</P>
<P> I AM one of Those, whom <HI>Fortune</HI> has the least
Kindness in the World for. <HI>This,</HI> however, she did for me.—My
Father Dying, while I was a Child, she put it into my <HI>Uncle's</HI> Head
to take Care of me; and he sent me to the <HI>University</HI>; where I have
now been (at <HI>his</HI> Charge) about two Years, and a half.—I come up
to <HI>London,</HI> every <HI>Christmas,</HI> to pass a Month at my
<HI>Uncle's,</HI> who is a Rich Merchant, in the <PB N="292" REF="293"/>
<HI>City</HI>; and give him an <HI>Account,</HI> as he calls it, what I have
<HI>learnt,</HI> during the other Eleven. His <HI>Education</HI> has tinctur'd
him with that infallible Mark of a <HI>narrow Spi∣rit,</HI>—The
<HI>Destroying Half the Merit of his Purposes, by an ungraceful Manner of
Executing them.</HI>—And he has so often, taken Delight to put me,
coarsely, in mind of his <HI>Charity,</HI> That he <HI>robb'd</HI> me, even
of the <HI>Comfort,</HI> which <HI>He laid out his Money to procure</HI>
me.</P>
<P> THIS last <HI>Christmas,</HI> being seiz'd by a violent
Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI>; he was roaring out, one Day, in Extremity of
<HI>Pain,</HI> and <HI>Peevishness:</HI>—He cou'd not, he said,
<HI>imagine,</HI> how so <HI>temperate</HI> a Man, as <HI>He</HI> was,
shou'd come by such a Distemper as the <HI>Gout!</HI> If he had been a
<HI>Glutton,</HI> or a <HI>Drunkard,</HI> he shou'd not have wonder'd at
it!—But, for a <HI>Small-Beer-Drinker!</HI> One, who had always been
<HI>remarkable</HI> for his <HI>Self-Denial,</HI> to fall under the Torture of
<HI>such a Disease, as the Gout!</HI>—It was very hard!—It
was very strange!—And he cou'd not, <HI>for his Part,</HI> tell, how it
was to be <HI>accounted for.</HI></P>
<P> IT was my Good-Luck, at that Time, to have been newly reading a
Collection of <HI>Miscellaneous Poems</HI>; and I bethought my self of
something, that I met with, in it, which had pleas'd me very much; and made
an Impression on my Memory.—I ran, and fetch'd the Book, and opening 
<PB N="293" REF="294"/> it to the Place, put it into my <HI>Uncle</HI>'s Hands,
and told him, He might there, find the <HI>Reason,</HI> of that
<HI>Misfortune,</HI> he had been complaining of.—He desir'd me to read
it to him, and I did it, as follows.</P>
<Q> 
<L>"THE Learned <HI>Sydenham</HI> do's not doubt,</L> 
<L>"But <HI>PROFOUND THOUGHT</HI> will bring the
<HI>Gout:</HI></L> 
<L>"And, that, with <HI>Back</HI> on <HI>Couch,</HI> we
<HI>lie,</HI></L> 
<L>"Because our <HI>Reason soar'd too high.</HI></L> 
<L>"As <HI>Cannons,</HI> when they <HI>mount vast
Pitches,</HI></L> 
<L>"Are <HI>tumbled back</HI> upon their
<HI>Britches.</HI></L></Q>
<P> MY <HI>Uncle</HI> smil'd, and said, <HI>'Twas pretty.</HI>
He made me read it so often, that he has got it by Heart: And repeats it
Twenty Times a Day, in all Companies, as a Proof of his <HI>Nephew's
Ingenuity.</HI> He never cou'd <HI>abide Poetry:</HI> But, is now grown very
fond of it.—He cou'd not have <HI>believ'd,</HI> he says, that there
was <HI>so much GOOD REASON in Rhyming.</HI> In fine, I am grown a
<HI>Favourite</HI>; and he allows, <HI>I have a great deal of WIT,</HI> ever
since I prov'd his Distemper to be the Consequences of his
<HI>JUDGMENT,</HI> and <HI>profound Thinking.</HI>—I cou'd not forbear
sending you this Intelli∣gence, as a Hint, to some of your Readers, who may
benefit themselves by the Example.</P>

<HI>Ex∣orbitant Encroachments.</HI>—And, that, Yesterday, for Example,
after he had eaten, <HI>at most, but six Slices,</HI> and was, (peaceably,

<P> THE only Account I shall give you, with Regard to

<HI>Colleges,</HI> in this <HI>University</HI>; my chief Design in Writing,
bing to strengthen you, with some <HI>new Ma∣terials</HI> for the better
Performance of that Promise, you were once pleas'd to make us, of
<HI>proving,</HI> that the <HI>Women</HI> are a great deal <HI>wiser</HI>
than <HI>We are.</HI></P>
<P> MY Father, very lately, sent me down, into the <HI>Fens,</HI>
to <HI>make Love</HI> to a young Lady, who is Mistress of a considerable
Fortune: Where I discover'd, to my no small Mortifi∣cation, That All my
<HI>Learning,</HI> hitherto, has <PB N="301" REF="302"/> taught me Nothing, that
deserves Compa∣rison, with the <HI>Universal Knowledge,</HI> which I met
with, in that discreet, and profound, Family!—Not <HI>Heaven</HI>
alone, but <HI>Earth, Air, Fire, Water; Birds, Beasts, Stocks,
Stones!</HI>—Every Part of the still, or moving, mute, or speaking,
<HI>Creation,</HI> has contribu∣ted to the <HI>Erudition</HI> of my more than
ac∣complish'd Mistress!—All Things been <HI>laid open,</HI> to her,
if not in their <HI>Natures,</HI> I am sure, I may say, in their
<HI>Meanings.</HI></P>
<P> IN short, after Three Days unsuccessful Endeavours to
fathom my Fate, with Re∣gard to this <HI>infallible</HI> Lady, I am come back
to my College, almost too <HI>humble to wish for</HI> the
Possession of a Blessing, so <HI>uncommon.</HI>—I saw a
<HI>female Dwarf,</HI> in my Mistress's Neighbourhood, and could not help
think∣ing, while I was looking on her, and listen∣ing to a little History,
of her having been <HI>serv'd up in a Goose-Pye,</HI> That this Pocket
<HI>Abridgement</HI> of <HI>Womanhood</HI> might as mo∣destly pretend to
incorporate Herself with one of the <HI>Gyants,</HI> in the King of
<HI>Prussia</HI>'s <HI>frightful Regiment,</HI> as I, to <HI>match my
Mind</HI> with one, whose <HI>Comprehension</HI> is, so vastly, too
<HI>big</HI> for me!—</P>
<P> AT my first coming, I was receiv'd, by an <HI>old Maiden
Aunt,</HI> who is Mistress of the Ceremonies to the Lady I was recommen∣ded
to; she surpriz'd me with a Declara∣tion, That she <HI>knew of my coming,
before she receiv'd my Father's Letter,</HI> I said, I 
<PB N="302" REF="303"/> thought it had been a <HI>Secret:</HI> but she
assur'd me. That I had been <HI>hanging, for a whole Week past, upon one
of the Bars of the Kitchen Chimney.</HI>—Not being intirely
<HI>En∣lighten'd,</HI> as to the <HI>Authority</HI> of this dark Prognostick,
I was preparing to ask a Que∣stion, or too; but was <HI>scar'd</HI> out of
the Intention, by a melancholy Denunciation, <HI>That my Father wou'd not live
to see the Match come to Perfection</HI>; for this Good Lady had (the Night
before this Letter was brought to her) <HI>seen it coming, in Both her
Candles, with a Winding-Sheet just over-against it!</HI></P>
<P> I BOW'D, with a becoming <HI>Sorrow</HI>; and receiv'd the
Prophecy with all that <HI>Re∣verence</HI> which was due to so
<HI>extraordinary a Reason!</HI> This won her to a Warmth in my Interest;
and she would carry me, without Ceremony, to <HI>surprize</HI> her Neice,
in the Garden, where she was visiting her <HI>Orange Trees,</HI> in the
<HI>Green-House:</HI>—We were got as forward, on this pleasing
Journey, as to the outside of the Garden Door, when some or other of
those <HI>busy Powers who envy Lovers their propos'd Enjoyments,</HI> put
it in∣to the Old Lady's <HI>Feet, to stumble over the Threshold!</HI> upon
which she turn'd back, in a Fright, and push'd me <HI>in</HI> again, with
such <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Kindness,</HI> that I can never suffi∣ciently
<HI>thank</HI> her; since, if I had <HI>gone on,</HI> (after such an
<HI>ominous Warning</HI>) <HI>and met my Mistress, in an unlucky
Minute,</HI> All the <PB N="303" REF="304"/> World, it seems, from that Time
forward, could never have made it possible for me to <HI>come near her, in
a</HI> LUCKY <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P> SHE overtook us, however, as soon as we were got back, into
the Parlor; and broke in upon me with such a <HI>Flash</HI> of
<HI>Charms,</HI> that, as I saluted her, I was struck dumb with
<HI>Rapture,</HI> out, of which I reco∣vered in Time to over-hear her tell the
Old Lady, as she was passing round her, to a Chair, <HI>That it was not
I, that had drawn open her Curtains, when the Bride-Cake was put under her
Pillow.</HI>—I was not, yet, skil∣ful enough to know what <HI>Good,</HI>
or <HI>Ill,</HI> this <HI>boded</HI> me: But, before we were fully seated, a
new Misfortune had befallen us.—My <HI>Clarinda</HI>'s <HI>Chair tumbled
backward,</HI> upon which she declared to me, with the prettiest
Resignation in the World, <HI>That she was not to be</HI> LADY-MAYORESS,
<HI>this Year</HI>; but had <HI>Patience</HI> to support herself, under all
such Disappointments.</P>
<P> BEING now got into perfect Composure, I began to find, that I
was <HI>looking silly,</HI>—So I sigh'd three Times, and inform'd
her, as well as I cou'd, of the <HI>Great Respect my Fa∣ther had, for the
Family;</HI> And <HI>Clarinda,</HI> on her Part, had open'd her Fan, to its
full Extent, and was looking down upon it, in the proper <HI>Attitude</HI>; and
telling the Sticks, with both Fingers, when the Aunt inter∣rupted me with a
Groan, (that had been unluckily mention'd by my naming my <PB N="304" REF="305"/> <HI>Father)</HI> and confirm'd her former Remark, of the <HI>Winding
Sheet,</HI> by a <HI>Death's Head, she had found out, in the
Fire!</HI>—As <HI>Great Misfortunes</HI> rarely come <HI>single,</HI> a
malicious Coal, <HI>in the Shape of a Coffin,</HI> flew, just then, to
<HI>Clarinda</HI>'s Feet; who turn'd pale, and took it up, betwixt a Finger,
and Thumb, and after throwing it <HI>behind</HI> her, over the <HI>left</HI>
Shoulder, corroborated her Aunt's Evidence, by a <HI>Death-Watch,</HI> that had
kept her <HI>waking</HI>;—By the <HI>howling of a Dog,</HI> all Night
long;—By a deep <HI>Grave</HI> that he had scratch'd up, at the Foot of
a <HI>Rosemary</HI> Bush, exactly under her Window!</P>
<P> AND, now, their Eyes being turn'd on Me, as if they expected my
Opinion; I gave it them, very gravely, <HI>That these Things had somewhat
in 'm!</HI>—and it was happy for me, that I said no <HI>less</HI> for
an Old Family Servant, with a sober, mournful, Face, having heard Part of the
Discourse, while he was busy about the Fire, very dismally confirm'd
our Terrors, by Three Proofs, which were stronger than all.—First, by
the <HI>squeaking of a Weasel,</HI> that had met him upon the
<HI>Cellar-Stairs</HI>; Secondly, by a <HI>Hole, that the Rats had gnaw'd, in
the Back of his best Livery:</HI> And, Thirdly, by a strange
<HI>Dream,</HI> that Mrs. <HI>Susan,</HI> the Cham∣ber-maid, had been
almost frighted out of her <HI>Wits</HI> by, about <HI>Wet
Cloaths,—Three Ministers,—Ripe Fruit,—and Roses in
Blossom!</HI>—After all which, to put it abso∣lutely 
<PB N="305" REF="306"/> out of Doubt, and <HI>convince</HI> us, <HI>That
somebody wou'd die shortly,</HI> he shew'd us on one of his Hands, a
dirty <HI>yellow Spot,</HI> which the Thumb, of his other (as he shook his
Head, and observ'd to us) was not <HI>broad</HI> enough to <HI>cover</HI>;
and this, they all agreed, was no better than a <HI>Death-Mould,</HI> and
<HI>must mean something.</HI></P>
<P> IN the midst of these <HI>Miseries,</HI> I had very
little to say for my self, having been <HI>put out</HI> of a premeditated
<HI>Speech,</HI> which I had been inventing during my whole Jour∣ney; but as
<HI>Good-Luck</HI> wou'd have it, the <HI>Tea</HI> came in, to my Relief; and
the first <HI>Dish,</HI> that had the Blessing to approach
<HI>Clarinda</HI>'s Lips, was so richly cover'd with <HI>Money-bags,</HI>
floating in white Circles, all over the Surface, that <HI>Gayety</HI> took
Place of <HI>Melancholy.</HI>—A little <HI>Spider</HI> too, was so kind
as to <HI>spin down Good-Luck, into her Lap,</HI> (which, methought, meant
<HI>me</HI> no Harm) Nay, I became, on a sudden, so happy, that her
<HI>Elbow</HI> declar'd in my Fa∣vour; and her Aunt put her to the
<HI>Blush,</HI> by observing, <HI>she must change her
Bedfellow.</HI></P>
<P> BUT let no Man be too much in <HI>Haste,</HI> to conclude,
that He is <HI>happy.</HI>—My Tri∣umph was <HI>dash'd at once,</HI> by
a Discovery That <HI>this was Childermas-Day:</HI> After which my
Mistress said no more, but that <HI>Nothing wou'd come to Good, that was
begun on that worst Day of the Week:</HI> So her Teeth ach'd <HI>most
prodigiously?</HI> She was sorry she cou'd be <PB N="306" REF="307"/>
<HI>no Company</HI>; and took her Leave of us, till next Morning.</P>
<P> NEXT Morning came;—and the first Person I met, was
Mrs. <HI>Susan</HI>; whom I dis∣cover'd, cross the Hall, spitting
seriously in her Hand, and shutting it close, with a great deal of
Caution, for Fear of <HI>letting slip</HI> (as she afterwards told me) a
<HI>Sign,</HI> she had felt, in her Palm, that a <HI>handsome Gift</HI> was
very near her.—I was glad of this favourable Opportunity, to confirm the
<HI>Truth of that Token</HI>; and she was so oblig∣ingly
<HI>Communicative</HI> as to intrust me with two great Secrets, <HI>One,</HI>
That, <HI>I had trod upon her Lady's Toe,</HI> last Night, in the Hurry of
waiting on her to the Stair-foot; whence a Conclusion had been drawn, in my
Fa∣vour, <HI>That I shou'd come, e'er long, to her Bedside.</HI>—The
<HI>other,</HI> that Mrs. <HI>Susan</HI> ha∣ving discover'd, this very
Morning, That one of her Lady's <HI>Stockings</HI> had been <HI>put on,
wrongside outward,</HI> was forbid pulling it off again, for Fear of
<HI>turning some Good-Luck, that was meant her.</HI></P>
<P> Mrs. <HI>SUSAN,</HI> in Return for her kind Intelligence, was
very Earnest to know, whether I had <HI>dreamt of no Body?</HI>—I told
her, I had had the Happiness to be, all Night, in <HI>Her Lady's
Company:</HI> And I cou'd perceive, that this Information was no more than had
been expected; which led me into some probable Guesses, con∣cerning the
Purpose of a <HI>Case-Knife, in a</HI> <PB N="307" REF="308"/>
<HI>Common-Prayer-Book,</HI> which, when I got up, in the Morning, I had found,
<HI>under my Bolster.</HI>—While, I held this Conference with my
<HI>Fellow-Servant,</HI> we had the Plea∣sure of bidding our <HI>Mistress
Goodmorrow,</HI> and of hearing (to my no small Comfort) That her
<HI>Foot,</HI> as she came down Stairs, had given her the Signal, <HI>That
she was to tread upon strange Ground.</HI></P>
<P> IN fine, Sir, it is impossible for you to conceive what an
infinite Variety of <HI>Notices, Impulses,</HI> and <HI>Prognosticks,</HI>
outward, and inward, these Ladies direct their Conduct by.—In my Three
Days stay, (which I thought enough for my first Visit) I cou'd learn
nothing, with any certainty, of what I chiefly sought to know; but was
edified, above Measure, in the <HI>Occult Sciences of the
Family.</HI>—My Mistress call'd after me, when I had taken Horse to
come away, that she was afraid I shou'd have a <HI>wet Jour∣ney</HI>; for
<HI>Puss was washing her Face,</HI> and carried her <HI>Paw above her
Ears;</HI> which, she assur'd me, was a <HI>Sign,</HI> that had never
been known to miscarry.—Whether she meant this as a Display of her
<HI>Art,</HI> or of her <HI>In∣clination to bring me back again,</HI> is a
Myste∣ry; which, notwithstanding the great Ad∣vance I have made in
<HI>guessing,</HI> I am, yet, unable to disclose, with any positive
De∣pendance.</P>
<P> BUT, I wou'd not, (for all that) have you think slightly of
my <HI>Skill in Tokens</HI>; <PB N="308" REF="309"/> since I cou'd
<HI>astonish</HI> you, if I thought fit, with a Profusion of
<HI>portentous Mysteries.</HI>—I am absolutely Master of that
<HI>oraculous</HI> Secret, which is <HI>kneaded up,</HI> in the <HI>Dumb
Cake.</HI> I am instructed in the <HI>aweful Cere∣monies,</HI> which are
sacred to the fam'd <HI>Saint Agnes,</HI> to the Purity of whose
mysterious Worship <HI>Three Fasting Virgins</HI> must concur, with
so strict an Abstinence, That a KISS, during those restrictive
<HI>Rites,</HI> wou'd be as <HI>Undoing,</HI> as a RAPE, after they are over. I
can foretell the most agreeable Things in the World, by <HI>Six Pea-shells
over a Door:</HI> And anticipate Consequences, which wou'd puzzle a
<HI>Southsayer,</HI> by <HI>turning Three Times round, in my Shirt, and
falling into Bed, backward.</HI>—I know who will die, an Old Maid, by the
Help of a <HI>Grey Goose Wing,</HI> a <HI>Clean Hearth,</HI> and a <HI>Seive
full of Ashes!</HI></P>
<P> BUT I shou'd never have done, were I I to let you into the
Virtues of <HI>Roses ga∣ther'd on Midsummer Night</HI>—of
<HI>Hempseed, sown,</HI> and <HI>mow'n, in the Dark, upon the Graves of a
Country Church-Yard</HI>—of <HI>patch∣ing a pretty Face with
Apple-Kernels</HI>—of <HI>Cutting the Nails, fasting</HI>—of
<HI>twisting a Garter, in Nine Knots, round a Bed-Post</HI>—of <HI>a
Certain Hair, that you may find in your Shooe the first Time you hear the
Cuckoo</HI>—and a Thousand other <HI>deep Discoveries,</HI> which I
have made, in this delightful Journey: And, which have put me quite out of
Conceit with my former Studies; since, after having <PB N="309" REF="310"/>
<HI>labour'd</HI> to be <HI>wise,</HI> so many Years, in a
<HI>Col∣lege,</HI> I found my self, (notwithstanding) little better than a
<HI>Fool,</HI> as often as I came into my <HI>Mistress's Company.</HI></P>
<P> PRAY, Sir, favour me with your Opini∣on, <HI>how far I may
prudently venture my self,</HI> with a Lady, so much wiser than I am.
Your Advice will have its weight, with</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, <HI>February</HI> 12.
1725.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>WE had once a Species of <HI>Opera,</HI> call'd <HI>Dramatic,</HI>
in which the Dignity of <HI>Reason</HI> was not sacrific'd, as it is now,
to the Dissoluteness of <HI>Sound</HI>; but the Force of <HI>Words</HI>
and <HI>Meaning,</HI> was increas'd by <HI>Mu∣sick,</HI> and
<HI>Decoration,</HI> and impress'd upon the Soul, by the Mediation of the
<HI>Senses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="311"/>I HAVE heard, with a Pleasure, which, I
hope, was not groundless, That there is a Design on foot, in one of our
<HI>Theatres,</HI> to restore these manly, as well as delightful,
Entertainments, with an Elegance, and Mag∣nificence of Ornament, which we have
not yet been accustom'd to.—The Success, which <HI>Dioclesian</HI>
has met with (an <HI>Opera,</HI> of <HI>this Kind,</HI> but far short of the
Perfection, which I am told it is propos'd to raise to them to) will serve,
it is to be hop'd, as an Encourage∣ment, to keep the Gentleman, who is
<HI>Pa∣tentee</HI> of that <HI>Theatre, firm</HI> and <HI>vigorous,</HI> in his
Intention.—His Genius is admirably turn'd to those Embellishments of
<HI>Show</HI> and <HI>Scenary,</HI> which will always have a surprizing, and
powerful Effect, on the <HI>Stage</HI>; but <HI>most</HI> where they are
aptly, and significantly, in∣troduced:—And, there are not wanting
<HI>Writers,</HI> who can contribute <HI>Subject,</HI> and
<HI>Oc∣casion,</HI> whereon to exhaust, in the most rational, as well as
agreeable Manner, the sprightly Copiousness of his Invention. So that I
am almost led to flatter my self, That our emas∣culating present
Taste, of the <HI>Italian</HI> Luxu∣ry, and <HI>Wantonness</HI> of
<HI>Musick,</HI> will give way to a more <HI>Passionate,</HI> and
animated Kind of <HI>Opera,</HI> where not only the <HI>Eye</HI> and
<HI>Ear</HI> may expect to be <HI>charm'd,</HI> but the <HI>Heart</HI> to be
touch'd and transported.</P>
<P>IT will be receiv'd as the Effect of <HI>Spleen,</HI> or
<HI>Affectation,</HI> to insinuate, That the Martial Spirit of our Nation, is
effeminated, and gra∣dually <PB N="311" REF="312"/> relax'd, by the Influence of
this sof∣tening <HI>Syren:</HI> And yet <HI>Cicero</HI> (who was at least
as good a Judge as most of the Mem∣bers of our <HI>ROYAL ACADEMY for
En∣couragement of TRIFLING)</HI> has not scru∣pled to say plainly, (in his
Tract <HI>de Legibus)</HI>—That <HI>the Good or Evil, in a State, depends
greatly on the MUSICK, that is most en∣courag'd in it: For, if it be too
Light, and Wanton, the People are insensibly render'd foolish, and
disorderly; and, on the contrary, if it be Grave and Masculine, they become
modest, by its Influence.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Spartan</HI> Plainness and Austerity, have been
celebrated in every Age: And Histories are full of Instances of that Wise
People's Ri∣gour, against <HI>Innovation,</HI> in Particulars which seem'd
to threaten them (at what Distance soever) with the modish Luxuries of
their Neighbours: But the strongest Impression which was ever made upon
me in their Fa∣vour, was from the Decree they passed against
<HI>Timotheus,</HI> the <HI>Milesian,</HI> for an <HI>Improvement</HI> he had
introduced in <HI>Musick,</HI> much like the admir'd <HI>Concerto's</HI> of
our <HI>Italian Benefactors.</HI> But these Grave <HI>Men of
Foresight,</HI> discern'd the Consequences of such pretended
Refine∣ments, and provided against it, by this time∣ly <HI>Edict,</HI> with
<HI>Lylius Gyraldus</HI> has inserted, as he transcrib'd it, from
<HI>Boetius.</HI></P>
<Q>FORASMUCH as <HI>Timotheus,</HI> the <HI>Milesian,</HI>
(receiv'd into our City) holding <PB N="312" REF="313"/> in Contempt the ancient
<HI>Musick,</HI> and re∣jecting the <HI>Harp with Seven Strings,</HI> hath
introduced an <HI>Harmony of many Voices,</HI> cor∣rupting the Ears of our
Youth, by a Mul∣tiplicity of Strings, and a Musick hitherto unknown,
<HI>Dividing the Simple Notes,</HI> into a Variety of <HI>Feints</HI> and
<HI>Quaverings,</HI> We do therefore Ordain, That he shall be
<HI>impeach'd,</HI> and that his superfluous Strings <HI>shall be
broken:</HI> To the End, that <HI>Strangers,</HI> from <HI>his Example,</HI>
may be wary of bringing among <HI>Spartans,</HI> the light, and unmanly,
Amusements, which are practis'd, in <HI>less modest Countries.</HI></Q>
<P>WHEN I reflect on the Power of Musick, as it was practis'd among
the Ancients, and consider the miraculous Instances of its Ef∣fects, on the
Passions of some Princes, who were most inflexible in their
Resolutions: And, when, at the same Time, I consider, That the Musick,
which had this prodigious Influence, was the Reverse (as I shall
pre∣sently prove) of That, which now prevails in <HI>Europe,</HI> and which
produces none of those <HI>transporting Effects,</HI> What less can I
con∣clude, than that All our boasted Additions to this heavenly Art, are
rather <HI>Enlargements</HI> than <HI>Improvements:</HI>—There is a
little Piece, of <HI>Randolph</HI>'s; which, of all his Poems, I am most
pleas'd with; and which gives us, as it were in <HI>Miniature,</HI> the whole,
that can be said, of Musick!</P>
<Q><PB N="313" REF="314"/> 
<L>Musick! Thou Queen of Souls;—Arise, and string</L> 
<L>Thy powerful Lute; and some sad <HI>Requiem</HI> sing:</L>

<L>'Till <HI>Rocks re murmur</HI> an awaken'd <HI>Groan,</HI></L> 
<L>And <HI>list'ning Tempests</HI> catch the mournful Tone!</L>

<L>Then, on a sudden, with excursive Hand,</L> 
<L><HI>Fly</HI> o'er the <HI>sounding Chords,</HI> with
<HI>Light</HI> command:</L> 
<L>'Till <HI>Oaks,</HI> and struggling <HI>Elms,</HI> uprooted,
<HI>bound;</HI></L> 
<L>And a charm'd Forest <HI>lives,</HI> and dances, round!</L> 
<L>Then,—in the <HI>midst</HI> of the transporting
Strain,</L> 
<L>Strike a <HI>sad Note,</HI>—and fix 'em <HI>Trees</HI>
again.</L></Q>
<P>I SAID, above, That the strange Effects, reported of
<HI>Musick in former Times,</HI> were the Influence of a Practice, very
different from the <HI>modern</HI>; and I cannot more effectually strengthen
that Assertion, than by observing I am confirm'd in it, by the Opinion of
Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> communicated, on this Subject, to the <HI>Royal
Society.</HI></P>
<P>THE Musick of the Antients was more <HI>ex∣tensive</HI> than
ours: For <HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Dancing</HI> (or measur'd Motion) were then
accounted Parts of <HI>Musick.</HI>—Now, we know, that
<HI>Verse,</HI> if harmonious, and passionate, <HI>set</HI> to a
<HI>plain Tune,</HI> and sung by a <HI>natural Voice,</HI> with some
<HI>soft Instrumental Musick,</HI> such as not drowns, or obscures,
but heightens the <HI>Emphatick</HI> Expressions; will work strangely
upon the Ear, and move all our Passions, in Proporti∣on to the
<HI>Tune</HI> and <HI>Subject</HI>; but especially, if attended with
suitable <HI>Gesture</HI> and <HI>Action.</HI> For, 'tis evident, on the
<HI>Stage,</HI> that proper <PB N="314" REF="315"/> <HI>Acting</HI> gives great
<HI>Life</HI> to Words. Now, all this <HI>together,</HI> (which made up the
Ancient <HI>Musick)</HI> must needs operate strongly on the Fancy and
Affections.—For, if the delibe∣rate Reading of a Romance (if it happens
to be well penn'd) will produce <HI>Mirth, Tears, Pity, Anger,
Indignation,</HI> according to the respective Intents of it, much more wou'd
it do so, if accompined with all those power∣ful Assistants.</P>
<P>WHY may not all This be <HI>now</HI> done, as well as
<HI>then?</HI>—No Doubt it <HI>may,</HI> and with equal <HI>Effect</HI>
too, if the <HI>Words</HI> were but elegantly adapted to the <HI>Argument,</HI>
and dispos'd in Places, proper for their <HI>Emphasis,</HI> pronounc'd with
a tuneful <HI>Voice,</HI> and inlivened by ex∣pressive <HI>Gesture,</HI>
painting naturally the Pas∣sion, or Condition, of the Mind; and
<HI>gra∣phically delineating,</HI> as it were, to the <HI>Eye</HI> (as well as
addressing to the <HI>Ear</HI>) the Bounds, Distinctions, and peculiar
Attributes, of <HI>Joy, Grief, Wonder, Fury, Jealousy, Compassion, Fear,
Love, Hatred,</HI> and the rest of those Emotions, which the acted Mind is
subject to.—This wou'd, as certainly <HI>now,</HI> as <HI>then,</HI>
produce extraordinary Effects; and especially upon a <HI>Surprize,</HI> where
Persons are not preju∣dic'd, or pre-engag'd; and, so lie open to the meant
Impressions.</P>
<P>OUR modern <HI>Musick</HI> is no more than what the Ancients
call'd <HI>Harmonick,</HI> which was but one Part of <HI>Theirs,</HI> whose
<HI>Musick,</HI> as I said above, consisted of <HI>Words, Verse,
Voice,</HI> <PB N="315" REF="316"/> <HI>Tune, Instrument,</HI> and
<HI>Action.</HI>—A very pow∣erful Combination!—And can we expect,
from <HI>One Piece,</HI> the same Influence, as from the
<HI>Whole?</HI>—The Design of <HI>Musick,</HI> among <HI>Us,</HI>
seems to aim at exciting no <HI>particular Passion</HI>; but, in general,
to <HI>please the Ear</HI>; and, by a tuneful Intermixture of <HI>different
Voices</HI> and <HI>Parts,</HI> with <HI>Cadencies</HI> and <HI>Con∣cords,</HI>
produce an <HI>elegant Sound,</HI> which only those Persons can discern,
who have distin∣guishing <HI>Judgment</HI> in <HI>Musick</HI>; while That
much larger Part of the Audience, which consists of Those who have a
<HI>rude,</HI> and un∣cultivated <HI>Ear,</HI> remains only amus'd, and
confounded, with a <HI>great Noise,</HI> which has Nothing
distinguishable to their Capacity.</P>
<P>'TIS true, indeed, that even this <HI>Compound Musick</HI>
admits of <HI>Characters,</HI> very different: Some are <HI>brisk, elate</HI>
and <HI>airy</HI>; some <HI>sedate</HI> and <HI>grave</HI>; others
<HI>soft, resign'd</HI> and <HI>languid:</HI>—But, still, That kind
of Harmony which is most powerful to excite particular Passions, or
Dispositions, in the Mind, is the <HI>simple, natural,</HI> and
<HI>uncompounded.</HI>—How often have I been forced to go abroad when I
had no mind to it, or <HI>fall asleep,</HI> in the middle of the Day, by a
<HI>Nurse's languid Tune,</HI> lulling her Babe to rest, in a Room, within
my hearing!—Nay, continual Reading in an <HI>even Tone,</HI>—the
soft Murmur of a pebbly Brook,—the falling of Rain upon
Trees,—shall have an irresistable Power to induce a Repose upon
the Spirits.—And, on the contrary, an <PB N="316" REF="317"/>
<HI>derman</HI> who is lame of the <HI>Gout,</HI> shall feel himself grow
light, and wanton, at the brisk∣ness of a <HI>Jig,</HI> on a <HI>Kit,</HI> or
<HI>Violin,</HI> exciting a Disposition to <HI>dance,</HI> that is almost
too hard for his <HI>Pain</HI> and <HI>Gravity.</HI>—Nothing is plain∣er,
therefore, than that <HI>simple Harmony</HI> is more operative on the
<HI>Affections,</HI> than an ela∣borate <HI>Composition</HI> of <HI>Full
Musick.</HI></P>
<P>SO that, if it is the Aim of <HI>Musick</HI> to <HI>please the
Ear,</HI> the Compositions of <HI>Italian</HI> Masters may deserve to be
<HI>preferr'd,</HI> as form∣ing <HI>sweeter Consorts</HI> than were known
to the Ancients; among whom I find no Footsteps of what we call <HI>several
Parts</HI> or <HI>Voices</HI> (such as <HI>Base, Treble, Mean,</HI> &amp;c.
sung in Consort) <HI>answering</HI> each other, to diversify, and fill
up, the Musick.—But, if we mean, by <HI>Musick,</HI> to excite
Passion, and, move the Heart, to any moral, or solid Purpose, we must
apply a more touching <HI>Simplicity,</HI> and endeavour to act <HI>upon
Nature,</HI> in a more <HI>natural,</HI> and unaf∣fected Manner. And This, I
doubt not, a judicious <HI>Composer</HI> may so happily effect, that
(allowing for those <HI>Hyperboles,</HI> with which the Antient Writers set
off their Musick) our Modern may be found capable of producing as
extraordinary Effects as theirs.—And, <HI>This,</HI> methinks, is a
<HI>Mine</HI> of <HI>Pleasure, yet un∣open'd,</HI> and may deserve to be
thought on, with some Attention, by Those, whose <HI>Pro∣fit</HI> wou'd

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the <HI>PLAIN-DEALER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> THERE is a dishonourable Kind of Practice, among the Men, who
style themselves the <HI>Wits,</HI> which I can no longer forbear
complaining against, as an Abuse that deserves the Notice, and
Correction, of a PLAIN DEALER.—You must needs have observ'd, that our
<HI>Poets</HI> are, like our <HI>Politicians,</HI> divided into opposite
<HI>Parties</HI>; and draw their Pens, with great Sharpness, to the Defiance
of each other's <HI>Muses.</HI>—Among these Warriors, (on both Sides)
there are a turbulent Sett of People, not <HI>Soldiers,</HI> but
<HI>Engineers,</HI> who are known by the Name of <HI>Cannon-Turners:</HI> They
never <PB N="318" REF="319"/> trouble themselves to provide <HI>Wit, of their
own,</HI> but are sure, by some Stratagem, to steal <HI>That, of their
Enemies;</HI> and apply it to a Purpose, the Reverse of what it was
intended for.—The only Difficulty, they are at, is to substitute the
Word TORY, in the Place of the Monosyllable, WHIG, without Detriment to the
<HI>Measure</HI> of the <HI>Verse</HI>; or to crowd the unpliable
Stubborn∣ness of PRESBYTERIAN, into the passive Com∣pass of JACOBITE:
For, when these little Difficulties are once happily adjusted, they have
turn'd the Malice of their Adversary's Meaning directly <HI>against
Themselves;</HI> and by killing, with this <HI>good Husbandry,</HI> save
the Expence of Artillery.</P>
<P> BUT it were well, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, if these
<HI>Cannon-Turners</HI> wou'd confine the Exercise of their invertive Talents
to our private, and <HI>Domestick,</HI> Factions;—On the contrary, They
are never so active, as when we are at <HI>War</HI> with any of our
Neigh∣bours. The <HI>French,</HI> in particular, have been very great Sufferers
by them; and have complained, That these <HI>Cannon-Tur∣ners</HI> are the
only <HI>unfair Fighters,</HI> that this Nation ever sent against them.</P>
<P> I SHALL better clear to your Apprehen∣sion, what Justice
there may be in their Complaint, by producing one Example, of many, where the
Wit, of their own <HI>Ma∣gazines,</HI> has been <HI>purloin'd,</HI> in a most
un∣soldierly Manner, <HI>and discharg'd upon them,</HI> to their no small
Damage.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="320"/> MONSIEUR <HI>Maynard,</HI> a <HI>French
Writer,</HI> in the Time of Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI>'s Admini∣stration,
found himself forgotten, or neg∣lected, (having been a Favourite, in the
former Reign) tho' this great Cardinal was nobly liberal, in the Encouragement,
which he gave to Men of Merit: Monsieur <HI>May∣nard</HI> had a Spirit, too
exalted to importune, with personal Addresses, a Minister, whose
<HI>Levees</HI> were so over-crowded; and to whom he was no otherwise
known, than by the Fame of his <HI>Writings.</HI> He, therefore, sent him,
(in the following <HI>Verses)</HI> a Memori∣al, so full of
<HI>Praise,</HI> without <HI>Flattery;—Satyr,</HI> without
<HI>Malice,</HI>—and <HI>Submission,</HI> without
<HI>Meanness</HI>; that I have never met with a Mixture of so
<HI>artful</HI> a <HI>Wit,</HI> with so <HI>delicate</HI> a
<HI>Severity</HI>; and it was impossible for it not to have produc'd the
Effect, which was expected from it, even tho' it had been address'd to a
<HI>Chief Minister,</HI> by many Degrees, <HI>duller</HI> than <HI>Cardinal
Richlieu.</HI></P>

<P> I HAVE seen with a great deal of Plea∣sure some Excellent
<HI>Specimens</HI> of the antient <HI>Hebrew Poetry</HI> distinguish'd in
your Paper, with the Applause which is so justly due to them: For every
Body, who weighs these Things with Judgment, must agree with a late Writer,
That <HI>there is nothing, so soft, so tender, and pathetick; and, at the
same Time, nothing so grand, so majestick, so terrible, and so
harmonious, as the Poetick Part of the</HI> BIBLE.</P>
<P> I SEND you one of their <HI>Lyrick Odes</HI> (which is the
<HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> on the Over∣throw of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI>
in the <HI>Red Sea)</HI> and I believe it will be readily allow'd, That there
is more of the <HI>Sublime</HI> in this <HI>Hebrew Ode,</HI> than can be found
among the <HI>Writings</HI> of any <HI>Greek,</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Poet.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I SHAL now according to my Promise, which I made you on the
Seventh of this Instant, and which I hope came to your Hands, give you some
Account of the strange Ravage which is made by <HI>Excessive
Drinking,</HI> in the Bodies and Minds, and Af∣fairs of those who are
addicted to that <HI>Barba∣rous Vice.</HI></P>
<P> NATURE has contriv'd it so, That all her Children, as long as
they retain their <HI>Reason,</HI> are fond of <HI>Life,</HI> and at the
same Time, they all believe that Life it self of which they are so fond,
is a <HI>grievous Bur∣then,</HI> without the Benefit of <HI>Health</HI>; but
tho' all Men are satisfied of the unspeak∣able <HI>Value</HI> of
<HI>Health,</HI> yet few are frugal Managers of it: But the <HI>Drinking</HI>
Part of Mankind are as Prodigal of it, as the <HI>Squan∣derer</HI> is of
<HI>Money:</HI> For no Vice whatever does so much Harm to the Body, or lays
the Foundation of so many Diseases, as Excessive Drinking, <HI>Gout,
Stone, Cholick, Fevers, Consumptions, Vapours, Asthma's,</HI> with a long
<HI>et caetera.</HI></P>
<P> A CERTAIN Friend of Ours, whom we love very well, has drunk
himself into no less than <HI>Three</HI> of them, <HI>viz. Gout,
Asthma,</HI> and <HI>Vapours</HI>; and yet he goes on in his old Course, as
if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Juice of the <HI>Grape,</HI>
like that of the <HI>Scor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>on,</HI>
could expell the Ve∣nom which befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
it infus'd; but here I <PB N="327" REF="328"/> think my self oblig'd to
declare, that I mean, by <HI>excessive Drinking,</HI> a constant, daily,
or frequent Drinking, to a greater Quantity than is sufficient to cherish
Nature.</P>
<P> ALL the rest of the Vices together, are not so often
punish'd by sudden Death as excessive Drinking alone is, which
some∣times happens by the Malignity of the Vice it self, oppressing and
stifling Nature, and sometimes by the fatal Accidents which attend upon it
as false Quarrels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P> OUR Friend whom I mention'd above, has no less than
<HI>Twice,</HI> to my Knowledge, very narrowly escap'd <HI>sudden
Death,</HI> which had like to have happen'd <HI>both Times,</HI> by
Excessive Drinking, once formerly in <HI>Lin∣colns-Inn-Fields,</HI> and
another Time lately at <HI>S—</HI> Now, as a Death that gives no Time for
Repentance, ought to be look'd upon as the greatest of all Punishments,
Excessive Drinking, ought to be regarded as the greatest of all Vices,
because we ought to believe, That Divine Justice has propor∣tion'd
<HI>Punishments</HI> to the <HI>Crimes</HI> for which they are inflicted; and
because there is no Vice, by which he who uses it, so imme∣diately
Defaces or so totally Destroys, in himself, the <HI>Image of God,</HI>
which is <HI>Rea∣son,</HI> I hope that upon reading this, you will have the
Goodness to admonish our Friend, who has so narrowly escap'd
<HI>twice,</HI> to beware of a <HI>third Time.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="329"/> AS the State of the Mind depends upon
that of the Body, and the Motions of that Particle of Heavenly Fire, upon the
Motions of the animal Spirits, which in time of <HI>Health,</HI> move
Vigorously, and Regularly; and Weakly, and Irregularly, in time of
<HI>Sick∣ness</HI>; it must necessarily be, that <HI>That</HI> Vice
which is the Occasion of most Diseases in the Body, must be
likewise the Cause of most Disorders in the Mind. And there is no Vice
that is so great an Enemy to the <HI>Understanding</HI> as excessive
Drinking, or that so often entirely <HI>Overturns</HI> it. Indeed, Drinking
to Excess while the Fit continues, sometimes strengthens the
<HI>Imagination</HI>; but, by the same Degrees by which it <HI>raises</HI>
the Imagination, it <HI>Depresses</HI> the Judgment, the former of which is
common to us with <HI>Beasts,</HI> and the latter with <HI>God</HI> and
<HI>Angels.</HI> But then the Day <HI>after</HI> Drinking, the very Imagination
languishes with the Judgment. And Drinking to Excess never fails, <HI>in
time,</HI> to <HI>Quench</HI> the Imagination, to <HI>impair</HI> the Memory,
and to drown the Judgment.</P>
<P> I DESIRE that you would admonish one of our Friend's
<HI>Capacity</HI> to take Notice, That <HI>Bacchus</HI> is often a great
<HI>Leveller,</HI> that he levels the Understandings of <HI>Wise</HI> Men
and <HI>Fools,</HI> of the Blockhead, and the Man of Sense; and that
therefore, as 'tis the In∣terest of Fools to carry on this Vice, 'tis the
Interest of Men of Sense to avoid it.</P>
<P> I DESIRE that you would likewise put Him in mind that the
same <HI>Drunken Deity</HI> <PB N="329" REF="330"/> is often <HI>worse</HI>
than <HI>a Leveller</HI>; that he is often a <HI>Subverter</HI> of the Order of
Things, and pulls down the <HI>Rich,</HI> and exalts the <HI>Poor</HI>; that
is, he gives Understanding to <HI>Fools,</HI> and makes Men of Sense
<HI>Madmen.</HI> For Fools having generally stronger Nerves and less
volatile Spirits, than Men of great Understandings, or of Beautiful
Imaginati∣ons, the same Quantity of Spiritous Liquor that will set Fire to
the Phlegm of Fools and by that Means <HI>rouse their Capacities,</HI> will
make Men of Sense either <HI>stupid</HI> or <HI>frantick.</HI></P>
<P> AS there is no Vice, which more impairs the Understanding and
weakens the Reason, there is none which more inflames the Pas∣sions, and
disorders the <HI>Will.</HI> Several other Vices are <HI>Solitary,</HI> and
each of them shuns the Company of the rest; but excessive Drinking is
attended with the very worst of them, that is, with those which have the
directest Tendency to the Misery and De∣struction of Men; as <HI>Gaming,
Quarrels, Riots, Murders,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P> MOST <HI>other Vices</HI> are <HI>compatible</HI> with
several <HI>Virtues,</HI> but Drunkenness runs Coun∣ter to all the Duties
of Life: A great Drinker, is, for the most part, neither a good
<HI>Husband,</HI> nor a good <HI>Father,</HI> nor a good <HI>Son,</HI> nor a
good <HI>Brother,</HI> nor a good <HI>Friend.</HI></P>
<P> BUT 'tis not <HI>Virtue</HI> only that <HI>Detests
Drunkenness;</HI> 'tis often abhorr'd even by <HI>Vice</HI> it self, as by
<HI>Avarice, Hypocrisie, Am∣bition,</HI> <PB N="330" REF="331"/>
<HI>Bigottry</HI> and <HI>Lust.</HI> As this unnatural Sin of Drinking is
attended with several that bring Misery and Destruction on those who
use them, as has been said above; 'tis often shunn'd by that Human,
<HI>Natural Vice,</HI> which tends to the Propagation of Mankind, as much as it
is by <HI>Vertue.</HI> For there is nothing so Inconsistent or
Incompati∣ble with excessive Drinking, as the Cleanness, Elegance, and
Delicacy, of a <HI>Courtly Gallantry.</HI></P>
<P> AS the Right Management of Human Affairs, requires Health of
Body, and Vi∣gour, and Serenity of Mind, we ought not to wonder, if a Vice that
breaks the Rest in him, impairs the Understanding, de∣stroys the Memory,
inflames the Passions, and debauches the Will, entirely unquali∣fies a Man
for doing what the World calls <HI>Business.</HI> And therefore hard
Drinking has ruin'd more <HI>English</HI> Families, than all the rest of
our Vices, put together; not by the immediate Expence which attends upon the
Vice, but by altering the very <HI>Natures</HI> of the Heads of Families who
use it, and mak∣ing them unfit for the Management of their Affairs, of which
they were very capable be∣fore: For other Vices, indeed make Men
<HI>worse,</HI> but a Habitude of excessive Drinking often alters Men, to
that Degree, That they become the <HI>very Reverse</HI> of what they were
before, and differ more from their <HI>former Selves,</HI> than from their
<HI>present Companions.</HI> Such a Habit, when it has been long con∣tracted,
<PB N="331" REF="332"/> has often made the <HI>Ambitious</HI> indo∣lent, the
<HI>Prudent</HI> inconsiderate, the <HI>Active</HI> idle, and the
<HI>Industrious</HI> slothful and negli∣gent: So that their Affairs are
ruin'd for Want of <HI>Application,</HI> or, by being intrusted in the Hands
of those, who turn them wholly to their own Advantage, and to the Ruin of
those who employ them.</P>
<P> AS <HI>Personal</HI> Vices are the Cause of pri∣vate
Calamities, so <HI>National</HI> Vices are the Grounds of National
Sufferings. And as no Vice does more Harm to particular Constitu∣tions, than
frequent Drinking to Excess, or lays the Foundation of more Diseases, and
of more ill Humours, in them; there is none of our publick Vices, which does
more Harm to our National Constitution, or occasions more Corruption in it
than this pernicious Habitude. And as this Custom in particu∣lar Persons
causes them to neglect their pri∣vate Affairs, and either to leave them
wholly undone, or to leave them to be done by those, who will make their
proper Advan∣tage of them, tho' to the Ruin of those who entrusted them, as
has been said above; the same Thing is not unlike to happen to this
Drinking Nation.</P>
<P> TO be satisfy'd of this, if we may judge of the Future by the
Past, we need only cast an Eye back upon our <HI>Elections,</HI> in which
Thousands of <HI>English-men</HI> (as far as in them lay) have sold their
own <HI>Liberties,</HI> and the <HI>Liberty</HI> of their <HI>Country,</HI> for
<HI>Liquors. Esau</HI> <PB N="332" REF="333"/> sold his <HI>Birth-Right</HI>
for a <HI>Mess</HI> of <HI>Pottage</HI>; but then He sold only his
<HI>own</HI> Birth-Right, and he sold it to his <HI>Brother</HI>; and he
sold it to <HI>support Nature,</HI> in the <HI>Extremity</HI> of
<HI>Hunger.</HI> But Thousands of our <HI>Electors,</HI> have sold, (as far
as in them lay) not only their <HI>own</HI> Birth-Rights, their <HI>own</HI>
Liberties, but the Liberties and Birth-Rights of <HI>their Brethren,</HI> for
nauseous Loads to <HI>oppress,</HI> and <HI>destroy Nature.</HI> I know,
indeed, very well, that upon those Occasions, in order to cor∣rupt People,
there is a little of the <HI>Solid</HI> made Use of sometimes, as well as a
great deal of the <HI>Liquid.</HI> But I have a better Opinion of some of my
Countrymen, than to believe, That they would <HI>sell</HI> their

Mischief, which excessive Drinking does to particular Persons, in their
<HI>Bodies, Minds,</HI> and <HI>Affairs.</HI> I should say something of
the <HI>unreasonable Apologies</HI> which the <HI>Disciples</HI> of BACCHUS

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> AS I have taken Notice, in the Course of your <HI>Plain
Dealing,</HI> That you are perfectly appriz'd of the General Disposition
among Those, whom we call <HI>People of Qua∣lity,</HI> to patronize, and
distinguish, <HI>Merit,</HI> I flatter my self that you will contribute
what Assistance may be in your Power, to the Encouragement of a
<HI>Work,</HI> I am at present engag'd in; and which the World may expect to
see publish'd, very speedily.—I intend, in short, To compile a
HIS∣TORY of DEDICATIONS; containing a particular Account of all Addresses,
of That Kind, which have been made to the <HI>Noble Patrons</HI> of the
present Age: Whether <HI>Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts,
Simple</HI> <PB N="334" REF="335"/> Barons, or under what Name or Title,
so∣ever known, and distinguish'd: Together with certain <HI>Edifying
Remarks,</HI> upon their graceful Manner of <HI>Receiving,</HI> and judici∣ous
Liberality in <HI>Rewarding,</HI> such Addres∣sers! From which a
reasonable Judgment may be form'd, concerning the <HI>unusal</HI>
En∣couragement, <HI>Polite Learning</HI> is like to meet with, throughout the
Course of the present Generation.</P>
<P> GREAT Numbers have already sent me in <HI>Memoirs</HI> of
their own particular Expe∣rience: And I doubt not in the least, but that I
shall be able to compose a Volume, which will not only <HI>do
Justice</HI> to the very extraordinary Times we live in, but asto∣nish,
and inflame Posterity.—If you, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, or any of your Friends
have <HI>wherewithall</HI> to oblige the World, on so illustrious an
Occasion, be <HI>communicative,</HI> for the <HI>Honour</HI> of your Country,
and con∣firm me, still more,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Friend, And constant Reader, <HI>HUMPRHY
PICKTHANK.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I MUST be plain, with my industrious Correspondent, Mr.
<HI>Pickthank,</HI> and let him know, without Ceremony, or Circumlo∣cution, 
<PB N="335" REF="336"/> That I have an irreconcileabe Quarrel to the
<HI>Subject</HI> of his History: And shall contribute no <HI>Memoirs,</HI>
to its <HI>Orna∣ment.</HI>—If he is desirous to know my
<HI>Rea∣son,</HI> I shall give it him in the Words of a merry Friend of
mine, who took Occasion, some few Years since, to <HI>dedicate,</HI> to a
<HI>Great Man,</HI> his Thoughts concerning <HI>Dedi∣cations.</HI></P>
<Q>YOUR <HI>Dedicators,</HI> says this <HI>Wag,</HI> are a sort
of <HI>intellectual Taylors,</HI> that <HI>cut out</HI> Cloaths for a Great
Man's Mind, without ever taking Measure of it.—They have but <HI>Two
Rules,</HI> and Those they never depart from: First, The Dress must be
<HI>Gaudy:</HI> And, Secondly, It must <HI>never Fit.</HI> But they must
make it of a <HI>vast Dimension,</HI> and cover it all over with
<HI>Tinsel.</HI></Q>
<P>METHINKS I shou'd congratulate the Men of <HI>Quality,</HI> on
this <HI>Advantage,</HI> which it must, of Necessity be, to them, to have
their Characters drawn only by such as do not, or <HI>dare not,</HI> know
them: And will, consequent∣ly, be sure not to put their <HI>Graces,</HI>
their <HI>Lordships,</HI> and their <HI>Ladyships,</HI> out of
Coun∣tenance. A convenient Piece of Good Breed∣ing! For which I hope, They are
thankful.</P>
<P>AS for my self, when I see a long Drift of
<HI>Excellencies</HI> and <HI>Talents,</HI> cramm'd down the Throat of an
<HI>Innocent Nobleman,</HI> who has done nothing to <HI>deserve</HI> such
Ill Usage, I am <PB N="336" REF="337"/> not at all surpriz'd at it,
Because I am assur'd it is not meant to the Disadvantage of the
<HI>Person</HI> of <HI>Honour</HI> it is address'd to, but is a mere
Declaration of the <HI>Author's Wants,</HI> and a heavy Complaint, against
Hunger, and Nakedness.</P>
<P>THE only <HI>Dedications,</HI> therefore, which I am for
encouraging, are Those, which may instruct the Receiver, that he is to
consider them as <HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>Exchange,</HI> drawn by the
<HI>Witty</HI> upon the <HI>Great,</HI> and payable at Sight.—And,
least the Offering shou'd be misun∣derstood, or not recompens'd, as it
ought to be, through the deplorable Ignorance of some People, whose high
Quality has plac'd them above the Reach of <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and the
Im∣pulses of <HI>Humanity,</HI> I have, for the Benefit of my worthy
Companions, in the Labours of the Standish, drawn up a <HI>Form,</HI> which I
would <HI>have</HI> annex'd to all future <HI>Dedications,</HI> where the
<HI>Fortune</HI> is, in any considerable Degree, more Elevated, than the
<HI>Under∣standing.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I AM a young <HI>Woman,</HI> just turn'd of
<HI>Fourteen</HI>; and my Father is a Doctor of <HI>Physick.</HI> But he
loves <HI>Poetry</HI> mightily: And we have a great many <HI>Wits</HI> come

when any of these <HI>Wits</HI> are talking with my Father, because he
says, They can teach me Things, That I shall be the wiser for, as long as
I live.</P>
<P> ONE of the prettiest of them all, was reading to us,
yesterday, some ingenious Copies of Verses, out of a Book of Poems, that
is just come out; and I think he told us, it was writ by a Gentleman whose
Name is <HI>Baker.</HI>—They were particularly delighted with one little

<P> I OBSERV'D, that my Mother, and my Eldest Sister,
<HI>blush'd,</HI> while they were laugh∣ing at it: But I (tho' I stole it

<P>THE Force of <HI>Avarice</HI> is never so con∣spicuous, and
so much to be wonder'd at, as when it taints the Minds of Persons eminent
in Quality and Circumstance, secu∣red, as one would think, against all
mean Temptations, by the large Revenues of a <HI>State Employment.</HI> It is
no such great Mat∣ter of Surprize, when we see this Tincture of
Covetousness prevailing in a <HI>Mechanick,</HI> one whose Birth and
Education are upon a Level; one, who has undergone a State of Servitude, who
has learn'd to be scraping and penurious by Habit and Example; and who, by a
Conversation with Dirt and servile Gain, makes the amassing a Fortune
to be the chief End of Life. But we expect from a Gene∣rous Birth, and a
Liberal Education, Senti∣ments suitable to their Dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="344"/>WE see, 'tis true, this <HI>dirty</HI>
Passion often <HI>blotting</HI> the <HI>Escutcheons</HI> of the Noblest
Fami∣lies: And we find at the same time our <HI>Re∣spect</HI> for their
<HI>Quality</HI> turn'd into a <HI>Contempt</HI> for their Persons. But how
much more de∣spicable does this Vice appear, when we find it lodg'd in the
Breast of Him, whose sup∣pos'd Merit, and the Favour of his Prince, have
raised him to preside in <HI>Justice?</HI> We at∣tach Idea's of
Veneration to their Characters, who are <HI>Oracles</HI> of <HI>Law.</HI> We
look upon them as the Storehouses of Wisdom, and the Fountains of
Integrity: And were they, as it is said of the old <HI>Persian</HI>
Emperors, to appear in Publick but once in Seven Years, the Vul∣gar, no doubt,
would carry up their Respect to the Pitch of <HI>Adoration.</HI></P>
<P>BUT our Deference for these Great Men is taken off, when we
see Frailties breaking thro' their Grandeur: When they prostitute the
Sanctity of Honour and Conscience, to Wealth, and unworthy Extorsion. My
Lord <HI>COKE,</HI> I remember, somewhere speaking of <HI>Extortion</HI> in
a <HI>Judge,</HI> says, It is there worse than Robbery: For <HI>Robbery is
apparent, and hath the Face of a Crime; but Extortion puts on the Visor of
Vertue, for Expedition of Justice.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a very fine Aphorism, and worthy the Consideration of
all Ages and Countries, That <HI>a Judge ought to be season'd with two
Sorts of Salt; the Salt of</HI> Wisdom, <HI>lest he should appear a</HI>
Fool, <HI>and the Salt of</HI> Consci∣ence, <PB N="344" REF="345"/> <HI>lest
he should appear a</HI> Devil. I cannot help recollecting, upon this
Occasion, a Pas∣sage of <HI>AELIAN,</HI> who speaking of the
<HI>Egyptians,</HI> tells us, 
<Q REND="inline">'That they boasted to have receiv'd their
System of Laws from <HI>Mercury:</HI> And that their Judges, whenever they
sate upon the Decision of Causes, wore, hanging upon their Breasts, by
a Chain of Gold, a Sa∣phire Image, which was call'd <HI>Truth:</HI> But,
<HI>says the Author,</HI> I should think it better, that, instead of the
<HI>material</HI> Image dangling at their <HI>Bosoms,</HI> they had the
<HI>Essence</HI> of it stampt on their <HI>Souls.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I WAS led into this Trace of thinking, by Perusal of those
Pamphlets which have lately been publish'd, concerning the famous Lord
<HI>BACON</HI>; and of another I met with in the Window of a <HI>Member</HI> of
<HI>Parliament,</HI> which is call'd, <HI>The</HI> CASE <HI>of</HI> ORPHANS,
<HI>consider'd from Antiquity.</HI></P>
<P>THE Title Page tells us, That a Part of of its Subject is, <HI>On
the Court of Chancery, having the Disposition of Orphans Money.</HI> As I
observ'd some Passages in it, concerning the unreasonable Trust
which has been put in the <HI>Masters</HI> of <HI>Chancery,</HI> I shall
take the Liberty of transcribing a few, and making them a Part of this Day's
Entertainment.</P>
<Q> 
<P> I MUST freely confess, <HI>(says this Author)</HI> it is
always my Opinion, That a Lord CHANCELLOR was a most proper
<HI>Trustee,</HI> and <HI>Guardian,</HI> of the Interests of
<HI>Orphans,</HI> and <PB N="345" REF="346"/> <HI>Widows.</HI> I have not
altogether retracted this Opinion, but I am so diffident of my own weak
Judgment, that strong Clamour, and strong Arguments, perswade me often
not to be too positive or tenacious of my Sentiments. I am not so
perfectly, me∣thinks, reconcil'd to a CHANCELLOR, and his <HI>Masters,</HI>
having too intimate an Understanding with Each Other: And I begin to
suspect it a Degree of <HI>Harmony,</HI> in no wise essential to the
Promotion of <HI>Equity.</HI></P> 
<P> IT has been, as I am told, but by a very modern <HI>Order,</HI>
that the <HI>Suiters</HI> Monies have been lodg'd in the Hands of the
<HI>Ma∣sters</HI>; and it may be to be wish'd that too many have not
Cause to be sorry an Order of that Kind ever took Place.</P> 
<P> THO' there be a loud Cry of <HI>Deficien∣cy</HI> in the
<HI>Suiters</HI> Money so lodg'd, I am not taking upon me to impeach the
Chara∣cters of those Gentlemen, but only to ob∣serve, That that
<HI>Order</HI> seems to have been as absurd and unreasonable, as it has
prov'd unhappy in its <HI>Consequences.</HI> The Posses∣on of large
Sums of Money, and the dis∣cretionary Power of approving what Secu∣rities
they shall be plac'd out on, is a Trust of such a Kind as might debauch
the Prin∣ciples of Minds, not the most strongly in∣trench'd in Honesty,
against the Assaults of Avarice and Advantage. It gives a Li∣berty, which
I hope was never taken, of <PB N="346" REF="347"/> making Interest of that
Money in which they have no Property, and for which they are, barely
Trustees; and at the same Time of not paying One Shilling of its Produce to
the right Owners, under Colour that they have not had any proper Security
pro∣pos'd, upon which they could certify it safe and fitting to place it
out.</P> 
<P> WERE there not the unhappy <HI>Defici∣encies,</HI> which are at
this Time talk'd of, I think several Cases of Conscience might arise
upon the Possiblity of the <HI>Masters</HI> Conduct, with Regard to this
Trust. Sup∣pose only, for Example, during the late unaccountable
Fluctuation of <HI>Stocks,</HI> when the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Frenzy was at the
Height, and <HI>Money</HI> yielded the Interest of a <HI>whole Year</HI> for
the Loan of a <HI>few Hours,</HI> any im∣mense Fortunes had been made by the
clan∣destine Application of those very Monies, for which no Securities
could be found; or those very Monies had been lost in an un∣warrantable
Venture for private Profit: What Reparation should have been made to the
<HI>Suiters,</HI> or <HI>Orphans,</HI> whose Estates, in either Case,
were so <HI>happily,</HI> or <HI>unhappily,</HI> employ'd? Would they have
reap'd the Be∣nefit of the first <HI>Stock-jobbing</HI>; or was there the
least Reason that they should sit down with the Loss of the
<HI>Latter?</HI> I make this but a Case of Supposition; and as it is
scarce probable that the same Frenzy should ever again possess us,
yet should it, the <PB N="347" REF="348"/> Wisdom of our PARLIAMENT is
providing, That the Monies of <HI>Orphans</HI> and other <HI>Suiters,</HI>
engag'd in <HI>Chancery,</HI> shall not be subject to such Hazards.</P></Q>
<P>BUT so much for Quotation. As I have above-mention'd the Name of
the Lord <HI>Chan∣cellor BACON,</HI> who was accus'd by the Na∣tion of
<HI>Bribery</HI> and <HI>Extortion,</HI> I shall add a a few Words here with
Regard to his Con∣duct under that Accusation. It has been rec∣kon'd very
singular in his Case, and He has been look'd upon as a Man of many
<HI>Fears,</HI> that he should desert his <HI>Defence,</HI> and, by a
<HI>Submission</HI> and <HI>Confession</HI> of his Guilt, throw
himself on the Favour of the Parliament. But my Lord <HI>BACON,</HI> who, as
it has been observ'd, knew that all Wounds ake with laying open, and that
Circumstances are sufficient to blast a Reputation, was resolv'd to
avoid the Hazard of a publick Examina∣tion. It may very often be wiser to
carry Defects private, than to stand too perempto∣rily on a Justification;
wherefore I look up∣on the Saying to be of great Weight, <HI>That no Man has
so many Faults, as he that takes upon him to have none at all.</HI></P>
<P>THIS puts me in Mind of a FABLE, that I read in my younger Years,
and which I shall relate here, because I am resolv'd not to end with too
much Gravity.</P>
<Q><PB N="348" REF="349"/> THERE was a Knot of good Com∣panions that
enter'd into a Club, under certain Rules and Orders for the Go∣vernment of the
Society. One Article among the rest, was,

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> YOU were pleas'd, in a late Paper, to thank Heaven, that
<HI>All</HI> our Lords are not <HI>Lords</HI> of <HI>Trade:</HI> For my Part, I
wish, heartily, that Eight, or Nine Gen∣tlemen of my Acquaintance, were
<HI>All Lords!</HI> They fall, so naturally, into <HI>Airs</HI> of
<HI>Grandeur,</HI> and are already so <HI>adroit</HI> in the Exercise of
<HI>Authority,</HI> that They would strangely <HI>become</HI> the Dignity I
wish 'em pos∣sess'd of, and I shall never be truly Easy, till I
see 'em preferr'd, to Offices of much less <HI>Trouble</HI> than their
Present, and more proportion'd to their Merit, and Abilities.</P>
<P> YOU must know, Sir, that I am <HI>Agent,</HI> for one of our
<HI>American Colonies,</HI> and owe <PB N="350" REF="351"/> to the Duties of
that Station the Opportu∣nity of being perfectly well acquainted with the
<HI>Patience,</HI> the <HI>Experience,</HI> and indefatig∣able
<HI>Application,</HI> of most of Those <HI>Fast Friends</HI> to the
<HI>Plantation Interest,</HI> to the <HI>Ease,</HI> the <HI>Wellfare,</HI>
add (above all) to the <HI>Good Government</HI> of their <HI>Dear Brethren</HI>
in the Western World!—I have receiv'd a thousand Proofs of the
surprizing <HI>Tender∣ness,</HI> and <HI>Moderation,</HI> with which They
act, in Matters, which carry any Severity, in their Appearance: And, on the
other Hand, of the kind Vigour, and Resoluti- with which They forward every
Motion, that but tends to the Encouragement, or Satisfaction, of their
Countrymen in those remote, but important, Settlements.—I am not able,
therefore, to <HI>express</HI> the Gra∣titude, I <HI>feel,</HI> for Benefits,
too long, and too many, to enumerate.—But because we see Things
clearest, when oppos'd against their <HI>Contraries,</HI> Indulge me but
so far, as to tell the World a <HI>Story</HI> for me, which will teach the
Enemies of these <HI>Great</HI> Pro∣moters of the Publick Good, to value
them, as they ought, and see what Diffe∣rences there is, between
<HI>Them,</HI> and other People.</P>
<Q> 
<P> ONE of the <HI>Turkish Sultans,</HI> whose Name I have
forgot, taking into his Con∣sideration the Great Fertility of <HI>Egypt,</HI>
was resolv'd to give Encouragement to the <HI>Trade,</HI> and
<HI>Plantations</HI> of That Country; <PB N="351" REF="352"/> To this End he
sent over to the <HI>Bashaw</HI> of <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> a SETT of SAGES,
with <HI>great Salaries,</HI> to whom <HI>References</HI> were to be made upon
all Transactions, of that Na∣ture: And by whose <HI>Reports</HI> He was to
guide himself, in <HI>Mercantile</HI> and <HI>Commer∣cial</HI> Cases.</P> 
<P> IT happen'd, soon after their Arrival, that a Petition was
presented to the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> by the Planters of <HI>Cotton,</HI>
whose whole Year's Expectation had been destroy'd by an unusual
Inundation of the <HI>Nile:</HI> In Commiseration of which deplorable
Acci∣dent, They humbly pray'd a Remission of the Tax upon Cotton, for That
one Year only.—The <HI>Bashaw</HI> (according to His Orders) referr'd
This Petition to the <HI>Sages,</HI> who were, <HI>with all convenient Speed,
to exa∣mine its Contents, and report their Opinion, what might fitly be done,
upon the Occasion.</HI></P> 
<P> THE <HI>Sages,</HI> justly mindful that the li∣beral
<HI>Salaries,</HI> which were annex'd to their Office, intitled the People, for
whose En∣couragement they were appointed, to the most affectionate Proofs
of their <HI>Favour,</HI> and <HI>Good Nature,</HI> were not wanting to lay
hold on this inviting Opportunity, to con∣vince the Petitioners how Greatly the
Estab∣lishment of so able a <HI>Board</HI> of <HI>Counsellors</HI> was
like to conduce to the Interest, not only of the Cotton-Planters, but of all
the Plantations, in general.—They, there∣fore, most humbly certified,
to the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> <PB N="352" REF="353"/> That the Loss of the Cotton
appear'd in∣deed to have been very considerable: But seem'd rather an
Effect of the <HI>Planter's own Negligence,</HI> than of the <HI>River's
Inun∣dation,</HI> since they cou'd not but know, there were many
<HI>Seeds,</HI> and <HI>Grains,</HI> not liable in their Growth, to receive
Damage by <HI>Inundations:</HI> And, in particular, <HI>Wool</HI> they said
was <HI>Water-proof.</HI>—They were therefore humbly of Opinion, That it
wou'd be for the <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>Plantation-Interest,</HI> that no
Regard shou'd be shown to the Prayer of the Petitioners, since they
ought, instead of <HI>Cotton</HI> to have SOWN WOOLL, and thereby secur'd
them∣selves against the Misfortune, which had ruin'd them.</P> </Q>
<P> I KNOW, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, That You are a <HI>Man</HI> of
<HI>Business,</HI> and will, therefore, take up no more of your Time, at
pre∣sent: But referr to another Occasion what Observations I intend to

<P> IF ever there was such a Thing, as the <HI>most Charming

Mistress, whose <HI>Wit</HI> is as amiable as her <HI>Beauty,</HI> is a

<HI>lov'd her, to some Tune.</HI>—I readily guess'd at her Meaning,

<P> NOW Sir, the Occasion of my troubling You is only to know,
Whether you can teach me any Method of finding out, what a Woman has a Mind to
<HI>hide?</HI> I can't, for my Life, guess, Whether she likes <HI>me,</HI>
or my <HI>Song either.</HI>—Before I made it, she was for being
<HI>lov'd</HI> to <HI>some Tune:</HI> And now, All I can get from her, is,
That she will be admir'd <HI>beyond Measure.</HI> In my Opinion, these
two Things are <HI>Inconsistencies</HI>; but one that is in Love, is so
apt to be mistaken, that I won't take upon me to be <HI>positive,</HI> till
I know what <HI>You</HI> think of it. And, so, in Hopes of hearing from You,
very speedily, I <HI>rest,</HI>—Ah! no—I mean, I

as flow'd from that Great Man on this melancholy Occa∣sion: Which may, at the

<Q> 
<P> 
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>PLUTARCH</HI> to his <HI>WIFE: All Health.</HI></HEAD>
<P> THE Messenger you dispatched to tell me of the Death of
my little Daughter, it seems miss'd his Way as he was going to
<HI>Athens:</HI> But when I came to <HI>Tanagra,</HI> I heard of it by my
Niece. I suppose, by this Time, the Funeral is over. I wish, that
whatever happens, as well <HI>now,</HI> as <HI>hereafter,</HI> may create you
no Dis∣satisfaction. But if you have designedly let any Thing alone,
depending upon my Judgment, I pray let it be, without <HI>Ce∣remony</HI> and
<HI>timorous Superstition,</HI> which I know are far from you. Only, dear
Wife! let <HI>You</HI> and <HI>I</HI> bear <HI>our</HI> Affliction with
Pa∣tience.</P>
<P> I KNOW very well, and comprehend, <HI>what Loss</HI> we
have had; but if I should find you <HI>grieve, beyond Measure,</HI> this
would trouble me more than the Thing <HI>it self:</HI> For I had my Birth
neither from a <HI>Stock,</HI> nor a <HI>Stone</HI>; and you know it full well;
I having been assistant to you in the <HI>Educa∣cation</HI> of so many
Children, which we <PB N="357" REF="358"/> brought up at <HI>Home</HI> under our
<HI>own Care.</HI></P>
<P> THIS much lamented Daughter was born after Four Sons, which
made me call her by your <HI>own Name</HI>; therefore, I know she was dear to
you; and Grief must have a <HI>peculiar Pungency</HI> in a Heart <HI>tenderly
af∣fectionate</HI> to <HI>Children</HI>; especially when you call to Mind how
<HI>witty</HI> and <HI>innocent</HI> she was, void of <HI>Anger,</HI> and not
<HI>querulous:</HI> She was naturally <HI>mild</HI> and
<HI>compassionate</HI> to a Miracle; and gave Specimens of her
<HI>Humanity</HI> and <HI>Gratitude</HI> towards <HI>any Thing</HI> that had
oblig'd her; for she would pray her Nurse to give suck not only to
<HI>other Children,</HI> but to her very <HI>Play-things</HI>; as it were,
courteously inviting them to <HI>her Ta∣ble,</HI> and making the best Chear
for them she could. Now, my dear Wife, I see no Reason why
<HI>these</HI> and the <HI>like</HI> Things, which delighted us so much
when she was alive, should, upon Remembrance of them, af∣fect us when she
is dead.</P>
<P> IT is but just, That the same Arguments which we have
oftentimes used to <HI>others,</HI> should prevail upon
<HI>ourselves</HI> at <HI>this</HI> so <HI>sea∣sonable</HI> a Time; and
that we should not supinely sit down, and overwhelm the Joys we <HI>have
tasted,</HI> with a Multiplicity of <HI>new Griefs.</HI> A vertuous Woman
ought thus to think with herself, That the Tem∣pest of the Mind in violent
Grief must be calmed by <HI>Patience</HI>; which does not in∣trench 
<PB N="358" REF="359"/> on the <HI>natural</HI> Love of Parents to∣wards then
Children, as many think, but only struggles against <HI>disorderly</HI>
and <HI>irregu∣lar</HI> Passions. For, we allow this <HI>Love</HI> of
<HI>Children</HI> to discover itself, in <HI>lamenting, wish∣ing
for,</HI> and <HI>longing after</HI> them when they are dead. But the
<HI>excessive Inclination</HI> to <HI>Grief,</HI> which carries People on
to <HI>unseemly Exclamations</HI> and <HI>furious Behaviour,</HI> is no
less culpable than <HI>luxurious Intemperance.</HI> Yet Reason
<HI>seems</HI> to plead in its Excuse; because, instead of
<HI>Pleasure, Sorrow</HI> is an <HI>Ingredient</HI> of the <HI>Crime.</HI>
What can be more Irrational, I pray, than to check <HI>ex∣cessive
Laughter,</HI> and yet, give a free Course to <HI>Tears,</HI> which flow from
the <HI>same Foun∣tain?</HI></P>
<P> FORMERLY, you discover'd, on a <HI>like</HI> Occasion,
great Constancy of Mind, when you lost your <HI>Eldest</HI> Son: And
again, when the lovely <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ron</HI> left us. For I remem∣ber, when the News was brought me of
my Son's Death, as I was returning Home with some <HI>Friends</HI> and
<HI>Guests,</HI> when they beheld <HI>all Things in Order,</HI> and
observ'd a <HI>profound Silence</HI> every where (as they after∣wards
declared to others) they thought <HI>no such</HI> Calamity had happened, but
that the Report was false: So <HI>discreetly</HI> had you settled the
Affairs of the House at that Time, when no small <HI>Confusion</HI> and
<HI>Disorder</HI> might have been expected. And yet you gave <HI>this</HI>
Son <HI>suck</HI> yourself, and endured the <PB N="359" REF="360"/>
<HI>lancing of your Breast,</HI> to prevent the ill Effects of a
Contusion.</P>
<P> THESE are Things worthy of a <HI>Generous Woman,</HI> that
<HI>loves</HI> her <HI>Children!</HI> Whereas, we see most <HI>others</HI>
receive them in their Hands as <HI>Play-things,</HI> with a <HI>Feminine
Mirth</HI> and <HI>Jollity,</HI> and afterwards, if they chance to die, they
drench themselves in <HI>excessive Sorrow.</HI> Not that <HI>this</HI> is
any Ef∣fect of their <HI>Love</HI> (for that <HI>gentle Passion</HI> acts
<HI>regularly</HI> and <HI>discreetly!)</HI> it proceeds from a
<HI>Desire</HI> of <HI>Vain-glory,</HI> mixed with a <HI>little natural
Affection,</HI> which renders their Mour∣ning <HI>barbarous</HI> and
<HI>extravagant.</HI> Which Thing <HI>Aesop</HI> knew very well, when he
tells the Story of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s giving Honours to the Gods: For it
seems <HI>Grief</HI> also made <HI>her</HI> Demands; and it was granted,
That she <HI>should be honoured,</HI> but only by Those who were willing,
of <HI>their own Accord,</HI> to do it.</P>
<P> AND, indeed, <HI>this</HI> is the Beginning of Sorrow:
Every-body <HI>first</HI> gives her <HI>free Ac∣cess,</HI> and after she
is once <HI>settled,</HI> and be∣come <HI>familiar,</HI> she will not be
forced thence with their <HI>best Endeavours.</HI> Therefore, she must be
resisted at her <HI>first Approach,</HI> nor must we surrender the
Fort to her by any <HI>exterior Signs,</HI> whether of <HI>Apparel,</HI> or
<HI>sha∣ving</HI> the <HI>Hair,</HI> or any other <HI>such like</HI>
Symp∣toms of <HI>mournful Weakness</HI>; which, by De∣grees, so
<HI>enervate</HI> the <HI>Mind,</HI> and reduce her to such Streights, that,
quite <HI>dejected</HI> <PB N="360" REF="361"/> and <HI>besieged</HI> with
<HI>Grief,</HI> the poor timorous Wretch <HI>dare not</HI> be merry, or see
the Light, or eat and drink in Company. The Inconvenience is accompanied by a
<HI>Neglect</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> with whatsoever relates to the
<HI>Elegance</HI> of <HI>Humane Life.</HI>—Whereas, on the contrary, the
Soul, when it is <HI>disordered,</HI> ought to receive <HI>Aid</HI> from the
<HI>Vigor</HI> of a <HI>healthful Body.</HI> For the <HI>sharpest Edge</HI>
of the <HI>Soul's Grief,</HI> is <HI>rebated,</HI> when the <HI>Body</HI> is in
<HI>Tranquility,</HI> like the Sea in a Calm. But, where from an ill Course
of Diet, the Body becomes <HI>dry</HI> and <HI>hot,</HI> so that it can∣not
supply the Soul with <HI>commodious</HI> and <HI>serene Spirits</HI>; but
only breathes forth <HI>me∣lancholy Vapours,</HI> which annoy her with
<HI>Sad∣ness</HI>; there, it is difficult for a Man (tho' never so willing)
to recover the <HI>Tranquility</HI> of his <HI>Mind,</HI> after it hath been
disturbed with so many <HI>evil Affections.</HI></P>
<P> BUT that which is most to be dreaded in this Case, does
not at all affrighten me; to wit, The <HI>Visits</HI> of <HI>foolish
Women,</HI> and their accompanying You in Your <HI>Tears</HI> and
<HI>Lamentations</HI>; by which they <HI>sharpen</HI> Grief, not suffering
it either of <HI>itself,</HI> or by the Help of <HI>others,</HI> to fade and
vanish away. For, I am not ignorant how great a Combat you lately entered,
when you assisted the Sister of <HI>Theon,</HI> and opposed the Women
who came running in with <HI>horrid Cries,</HI> bringing <HI>Fewel,</HI> as it
were, to her Passion. When Men see their Neigh∣bour's 
<PB N="361" REF="362"/> <HI>House</HI> on Fire, every one contributes his
utmost to <HI>quench</HI> it: But when they see the Mind inflamed with
furious Passion, they bring <HI>Fewel</HI> to <HI>nourish</HI> and
<HI>increase</HI> it. When a Man's <HI>Eye</HI> is in Pain, he is not
suffered to touch it, tho' the Inflammation provoke him to it, nor will they
that are near him meddle with it. But he who is gall'd with <HI>Grief,</HI>
sits and exposes his Di∣stemper to <HI>every one,</HI> like Waters that
all may poach in; and so that which at first seem'd a <HI>light</HI> or
<HI>trivial Smart,</HI> by much <HI>Fretting</HI> and <HI>Provoking,</HI>
becomes <HI>great,</HI> and <HI>incurable.</HI></P>
<P> I WOULD have you endeavour to call to Mind <HI>that
Time,</HI> when our Daughter was not, as yet, born to us: Then, joining
<HI>that</HI> Time with <HI>this,</HI> argue thus with your self, we are
<HI>now</HI> in the <HI>same</HI> Condition as <HI>then:</HI> Otherwise,
dear Wife, we shall seem discontented at the <HI>Birth</HI> of our little
Daughter, if we own, that our Circum∣stances were better <HI>before</HI> it.
The <HI>Two Years</HI> of her <HI>Life</HI> are, by no means, to be forgotten,
by us, but to be numbered amongst our <HI>Blessings,</HI> in that they
afforded us an <HI>agreeable Pleasure.</HI> Shall we not esteem a
<HI>small Good</HI> because of a <HI>great Evil?</HI> or, Shall we
ungratefully complain against Fortune for what she has <HI>actually given
us,</HI> because she has not added <HI>what we wish
for?</HI>—Certainly, to speak reverently of the Gods, and to bear our
<HI>lot</HI> with an <HI>even</HI> <PB N="362" REF="363"/> <HI>Mind,</HI>
without <HI>accusing Fortune,</HI> always brings with it a <HI>fair
Reward.</HI> And he, who in such a Case, calls <HI>prosperous Things</HI>
to Mind, and, turning his Thoughts from <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>melancholy</HI>
Objects, fixes them on <HI>bright</HI> and <HI>chearful</HI> Ones; will either
quite <HI>extinguish</HI> his <HI>Grief,</HI> or, by <HI>allaying</HI> it
with <HI>contrary</HI> Sentiments will render it more <HI>feeble.</HI></P>
<P> TRUE <HI>Happiness</HI> consists in the <HI>right
Counsels</HI> of the Mind, tending to its own <HI>constant
Establishment;</HI> and the <HI>Changes</HI> of <HI>Fortune</HI> are of no
great <HI>Importance</HI> to the <HI>Felicity</HI> of our <HI>Life:</HI> if we
are govern'd by <HI>exterior Things,</HI> and, with the Vulgar, have a Regard
to <HI>Casualties,</HI> we suffer <HI>any kind</HI> of Men to be Judges of
our Happiness, it will certainly ill become us, to accuse our Life, if,
like a <HI>Book,</HI> it hath but <HI>one Blot</HI> in it, and all the rest
be <HI>fair</HI> and <HI>candid.</HI></P>
<P> DO not You, therefore take Notice of the Tears and Moans of
<HI>such</HI> as <HI>visit you,</HI> at <HI>present, condoling</HI> your
Misfortune; for their <HI>Tears</HI> and <HI>Sighs</HI> are but <HI>of
Course.</HI> Rather consider, How happy every one of them esteemed you
for the <HI>Children you have,</HI> the <HI>House you keep,</HI> and the
<HI>Life you lead.</HI> For it would be an ill thing, while <HI>others</HI>
covet <HI>your</HI> Fortune, tho' <HI>sullied</HI> with this
<HI>Affliction,</HI> that you should exclaim against what you
<HI>enjoy</HI>; and not be sensible, from the <HI>Taste</HI> of
<HI>Affliction</HI> how grateful you ought to be for the Happiness which
remains <HI>un∣touched.</HI> <PB N="363" REF="364"/> Or, like some, who
collecting all the <HI>defective</HI> Verses of <HI>Homer,</HI> pass'd over
at the same time, so many <HI>excellent Parts</HI> of his Poems: So shall
we peevishly <HI>complain of,</HI> and <HI>reckon up</HI> the
<HI>Inconveniencies</HI> of our Life, neglecting the <HI>Benefits</HI> thereof?
Or, Shall we imitate <HI>Covetous</HI> and <HI>Sordid</HI> Misers, who having
heap'd together much Riches, never <HI>enjoy</HI> what they have in
<HI>Possession,</HI> but <HI>bewail it</HI> inconsolably, if it
chance to be <HI>lost.</HI></P>
<P> BUT, if you lament the poor Girl, be∣cause she died
<HI>unmarried,</HI> and without <HI>Off∣spring,</HI> you have wherewithal to
comfort your self, in that <HI>You</HI> are defective in none of these
Things, having had <HI>Your Share:</HI> And these are not to be esteemed
<HI>great Evils</HI> where they are <HI>wanted,</HI> and <HI>small
Benefits</HI> where they are <HI>enjoyed.</HI> So long as she is gone to a
Place where she feels no <HI>Pain,</HI> she has no Need of our
<HI>Grief:</HI> For, what <HI>Harm</HI> can befall <HI>us</HI> from
<HI>her,</HI> when she is free from all <HI>Hurt?</HI> And, surely, the
Loss of <HI>great Things</HI> abates the Grief, when it is come to this;
<HI>That there is no more Ground of Grief or Care for them.</HI> But thy
<HI>TIMOXENA</HI> was deprived but of <HI>small Matters</HI>; for she had
no Knowledge but of such; neither took she Delight but in such
<HI>small Things.</HI> How then can you say, That <HI>that</HI> is taken

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> WHILE I intended to have sent you an <HI>Essay</HI> on
<HI>Plain-Dealing,</HI> I fell in∣to a Conversation, which furnished me
with it, and the Narrative will be thought a more lively Entertainment. The
Society was composed of some of your old standard Friends, whose
agreeable Characters gave Life to your Understanding.—I was car∣ried
thither to have the Honour of being introduced to the <HI>Plain Dealer</HI>;
but, it seems, you were taking Observations from your Watch-Tower of
<HI>Barbican,</HI> concern∣ing which, I make no doubt, we shall hear
something to our Advantage; and so, as it happen'd, I miss'd the
Pleasure which had <PB N="366" REF="367"/> been promised me. However, as
your Ad∣mirer, I beg to be admitted into the Num∣ber of your Correspondents,
while I inform you, That the Company I met, were the <HI>Clergyman,</HI> the
<HI>Critick,</HI> Major <HI>Stedfast, Ned Volatile,</HI> and your own dear
<HI>Patty Amble.</HI></P>
<P> THE good Gentleman in Black, took Occasion, from our Speaking
of the Title of your Paper, to distinguish a <HI>Plain Dealer</HI> from a
<HI>Rough Dealer:</HI> That is, a Man, whose Knowledge and Generosity
inspire him with a Delight in befriending Man∣kind, from the brutal
Impertinent, whose Ignorance but <HI>affects</HI> Meaning, and prompts him to
suppose he appears Wisest, when most insufferably Shocking. The
Virtues of <HI>Plain Dealing,</HI> said he, are, by awkard Imi∣tators,
debased into Ill-Manners, and In∣humanity. The Brute, who boasts of his
<HI>Bluntness,</HI> is a loud Censurer of other Mens Conduct, and never
right in his own.—His Eloquence is a Froth of Expression, without
Depth, or Perspicuity.—While his Depravity mistakes Brutalities for
Beau∣ties, the Graces of human Life are rejected by him as Frailties! Because
his own Na∣ture is impenetrably obdurate, he calls Ob∣stinacy
<HI>Magnanimity!</HI> Compassion for the Afflicted, is a <HI>Weakness in
the Mind</HI>; and a Readiness to forgive Injuries, an <HI>Affectation,</HI>
or <HI>Deficiency</HI> of <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P> The <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> refining <HI>Nature,</HI> by
Principle, acts the Inquisitor within him∣self, <PB N="367" REF="368"/> and
throws out a Light of Example, as well as Instruction, upon the
World.—The Former insults the Unfortunate with Censure; but the
Latter, reproaching only the Proud and Prosperous, <HI>corrodes</HI> not the
Wounds of the Afflicted, by insisting on past, and irretrievable
Miscarriges. Yet, by some gentle Allusion to their Actions, he awakens a
Reflection, that can arm them for their future Safety.—We judge of Things
impartially upon a Surprize, by such Comparison; and, condemning our own
Faults in others, are forced to stand self-convicted, when the
<HI>Recoil</HI> is made up∣on our selves.</P>
<P> But the Barbarity of a <HI>profound Pedant</HI> is still
worse, if possible, than that of a <HI>shal∣low Impertinent.</HI> The
Ignorance of the one, can only move us to Contempt; but the Learning of the
other, provokes our Dete∣station. Tho' Envy may hurt Genius, by urging it, in
the Disguise of Flattery, up∣on too ardent and improper Essays, yet, in
the dogmatizing Pedant, it has shock'd Worth much more fatally at its first
setting out; and extinguish'd a Spirit, which no Encouragement could
re-kindle. A Pe∣dant ungratefully turns that Force to the Discouragement of
Learning, with whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Learning has
arm'd him to make War against Ignorance.—While the <HI>Plain
Dealer</HI> reproves, he sets <HI>Merits</HI> against <HI>Er∣rors,</HI> and
the <HI>Lustre</HI> of the one, deepens the <PB N="368" REF="369"/>
<HI>Shade</HI> of the other! To display but the dark Side a Man, either damps
him with a Ter∣ror, that incapacitates him for Action, or disgusts him into
a stubborn Indulgence of those Follies he would otherwise have grown
ashamed of. Roughness in Conver∣sation, being like Persecution in
Religion, Proselytes are gain'd soonest by a gentle Manner of
Persuasion; and I am pleas'd with a Saying that is recorded of King
<HI>Henry the Fourth</HI> of <HI>France.—A Drop of Honey draws more
Flies, than a Spoonful of Vine∣gar.</HI></P>
<P> IN short, the Force of a fine Instruction ought to strike
like a Flash of Lightning! As the Subtilty of the one, is said to
dis∣solve the Bone, without bruising the Flesh; the other, with a
Surprize of Influence, shoots Remorse thro' the Heart, before the Temper
can be ruffled into a Disposition to repulse it. In this Light, a
<HI>Plain Dealer</HI> is a Father, or rather a Friend, which is yet
dearer.—A Father may leave us Wealth and Titles, from which we may derive
Au∣thority or Distinction; but such a Friend, can teach us to be wise,
and Wisdom illu∣strates Obscurity, and adorns Dignity with an Eminence
superior to that of Fortune; it vests us too with the noblest
<HI>Power,</HI> for it enables us to govern our
Passions.—<HI>Alexander</HI> justly preferr'd his Master
<HI>Ari∣stotle</HI> to his Father <HI>Philip. The King,</HI> said he,
<HI>but made me a Prince, the Philosopher made me a Man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="370"/> I OBSERV'D, That your dear <HI>Patty
Am∣ble,</HI> delighting to <HI>talk much,</HI> took little Plea∣sure in
giving <HI>Attention.</HI> But that Lady urges her <HI>Sex's Privilege,</HI>
when she declares an Antipathy to <HI>Plain Dealing.</HI> Ah! cri∣ed the
charming <HI>Coquet,</HI> how preferable is Flattery to <HI>Plain Dealing?</HI>
I know, that, in the common Cant, Flattery is said to be <HI>gross</HI>;
that it is called, The <HI>Craft</HI> of the <HI>Courtier!</HI> The
<HI>Seducer</HI> of <HI>Beauty!</HI> and, The vain Promiser of a Happiness,
which it ne∣ver means to bestow! But, let me tell you, they had done it more
Justice, had they cal∣led it, The <HI>Soother</HI> of <HI>Discontent!</HI>
The <HI>Re∣finer</HI> of <HI>Fancy!</HI> The <HI>Imbellishment</HI> of
<HI>Con∣versation!</HI> The very <HI>Inspirer</HI> of <HI>polite
Plea∣sures!</HI>—What a Delicacy of Delight should we lose, were
that odious <HI>Plain Deal∣ing</HI> to prevail? Mr. <HI>Volatile</HI> would no
lon∣ger give the <HI>Tattling</HI> of a Lady, the com∣plaisant Term of
<HI>Liveliness</HI>; nor the <HI>Major</HI> soften our Sex's Levities with
the pretty Title of, <HI>Innocent Amusements.</HI> Our Ex∣pence in Dress,
Equipage, Masquerades, and <HI>Opera Subscriptions,</HI> would lose the
agreeable Name of <HI>Taste,</HI> for that hideous one of
<HI>Extravagance</HI>; so that our darling Modes of Thinking, which we have
so long been told, are owing to our Reason and Discernment, would then be
forc'd to wear a much more mortifying Title, and be cal∣led, Our downright
<HI>Vanity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="371"/> I WAS willing to take the Advantage of
this Pause but could not resist the Pleasure of listening to that
ever-rambling, ever-agreeable Tongue! What Lover (continu∣ed the inchanting
Trifler) would not rather be <HI>flatter'd</HI> into Hope, then abandon'd to
Despair by <HI>Plain Dealing?</HI> The Coxcomb delightfully deceives
himself, by fancying our very <HI>Denials</HI> to be Tokens of our fu∣ture
Favours. The Man of Sense (who, when a <HI>Lover,</HI> is, of Course, to be
<HI>mistaken</HI>) believes the Charmer, he admires, has a Wit as penetrating
as her Eyes; and, vain of the real Worth he possesses, becomes Fool
enough, in his Turn, to think <HI>Merit</HI> a Re∣commendation to the
Ladies!—Thus, when you flatter <HI>Us,</HI> you appear agreeable, when we
flatter <HI>You,</HI> we secure our Con∣quests; and when we Both flatter
<HI>Ourselves,</HI> we consult and preserve our Quiet. These are
Pleasures, which <HI>Plain Dealing</HI> would intirely deface, and
abolish.</P>
<P> BUT, Madam, cried <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> as Beaus and Ladies
admire Things for their <HI>Novelty,</HI> we Men of Speculation, approve them
most for their <HI>Antiquity.</HI>—A Man of Dress, is pleas'd with a
Sword-Knot and Cane-String, after the newest Fashion; while a
<HI>Virtuoso</HI> prefers a rusty <HI>Roman Javelin</HI> to the White Wand
of a Lord-Treasurer.—The Herald derives the Honour of Fami∣lies from
their <HI>Antiquity:</HI> And since there can be no Doubt, but
<HI>Flattery</HI> is more <PB N="371" REF="372"/> <HI>ancient,</HI> it must
therefore be more <HI>honour∣able</HI> than <HI>Plain Dealing.</HI></P>
<P> <HI>Plain Dealing,</HI> interrupted the <HI>Critick,</HI> had
been more gracefully drawn, in the fa∣vourite Character of Mr.
<HI>Wicherley</HI>'s Come∣dy; if his good Qualities, remaining equal∣ly
strong, had been soften'd, to appear more <HI>amiable.</HI> But his
Judgment is mix'd with Partiality, and his Wit with Ill-manners. He's impatient
of Contradiction, and ex∣ceeds, in Self-conceitedness, the very Cox∣combs he
contemns.—As a <HI>Lover,</HI> his Indecency checks our Regard, and
seems to justifie the Ill-usage which he meets with.</P>
<P> COULD <HI>Plain-Dealing</HI> (observ'd the <HI>Ma∣jor</HI>)
be forgiven among the <HI>Great,</HI> it would <HI>both adorn</HI> and
<HI>defend</HI> them. On the contrary, <HI>Double Dealing,</HI> which is an
Accomplish∣ment they are fond of, has been more dan∣gerous to Princes, than
the most open Re∣bellion. Had <HI>Tarquin</HI> never trusted the
Dissimulation of the First <HI>Brutus,</HI> the Ex∣pulsion of his Race
had been prevented: And, I think, it may easily be determined, by the
Unprejudiced, how far the admired Last of that Name deviated from his
boasted <HI>Honesty,</HI> when he conspired against the Man whose
Interest he espoused, and whose par∣ticular Affection had pardon'd,
promoted, and confided in him; when, in the Person of that God-like
<HI>Caesar,</HI> he assassinated his <HI>Father,</HI> his
<HI>Friend,</HI> and his <HI>Preserver.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="373"/> I HAD now an Opportunity to offer my
Sentiments, in my Turn; and ventur'd to interpose as follows.—Were
<HI>Plain Dealing</HI> a Court Vertue, it would free great Num∣bers from the
Misery of a vain Dependance, and avoid the Resentment of those, whom
<HI>Double Dealing</HI> disappoints, or makes In∣struments of. Greatness
proves often too weak a Protection; for the meanest Adver∣sary may become
<HI>considerable</HI> in <HI>Mischief.</HI> However an angry Multitude may
<HI>vary</HI> in their Tempers, their Passions, like different Arrows,
carry all the same Sharpness, and are commonly pointed at <HI>one
Mark.</HI>—Up∣on the Whole, If <HI>Wisdom</HI> is better than
<HI>Cunning,</HI> if <HI>Honesty</HI> may be allowed the <HI>safest</HI>
Principle of <HI>Policy</HI>; there is then this Difference betwixt <HI>Double
Dealing</HI> and <HI>Plain Dealing</HI>; The one, confounds Families and
Kingdoms, and renders the Guilty, when discover'd, detestable, even in the
Grave: The other confirms Justice, banishes Di∣strust from
Correspondence, strengthens Friendship in <HI>Private</HI>; and in
<HI>Publick,</HI> is the Mark of a <HI>Patriot</HI>; and will transmit the
Possessor's Memory to the Affection of future Ages.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I AM a Young Fellow, left by my Pa∣rents without any
Provision, besides that of a good Education; nor have I any Prospect of
Fortune, but what I may, by the Assistance of that, hope to raise in my
Profession. You will certainly think I had other Business to mind, than
being <HI>in Love</HI>; and yet, Sir, that is the Cause of my pre∣sent
Application.—I must own myself not able to withstand the Charms of
a cer∣tain Young Lady, who is one of your Rea∣ders. She is at once,
Mistress of the greatest <HI>Sense, Knowledge, Wit,</HI> and
<HI>Sweetness</HI> of <PB N="374" REF="375"/> <HI>Temper</HI>; Qualities,
<HI>each</HI> of which by itself (possess'd to that eminent Degree,
she now enjoys them <HI>all</HI>) were sufficient to make whomsoever
she honours with her Choice, <HI>compleatly happy!</HI> She has, for some
Time, admitted me to the Favour of visiting her, and treats me, on all
Occasions, with the greatest Civility. I have heard her often say, She
thought <HI>the Law</HI> (to which, by this Time, you perceive I belong) the
most <HI>Genteel,</HI> and <HI>Honourable,</HI> of all Professions; That
she never would marry for <HI>Money</HI>;—And a Hundred such Things,
that a young Fellow, as I am, is naturally vain enough to construe into
<HI>Encouragements.</HI> But, Sir, she is a great <HI>Fortune</HI>; and you
know what <HI>Ridicule</HI> a Young Man, <HI>without any,</HI> meets with, who
makes Addresses of that Kind, and comes off unsuccessfully.—I
desire, therefore, you would take an Opportunity, in one of your Papers, to
let her know, That if she has any such Thoughts, as my Wishes have
flattered my Hopes into a <HI>Suspicion</HI> of, Her Advances ought to be a
great deal <HI>more,</HI> than is usually judged reasonable: For while I
have the least <HI>Doubt</HI> of her Inclinations, I had rather die a
Thou∣sand <HI>Deaths,</HI> than, by a mistaken Pre∣sumption, run the
Hazard of losing, what alone can make <HI>Life</HI> valuable, to,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your very Humble Servant,
<HI>SYLVIO.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="375" REF="376"/>THE Case of my Correspondent is pretty
nice, and as this seems to be a Matter of the greatest Importance to both
Parties, I think I cannot bestow a Paper better, than in taking it into
Consideration, and in giving some Advice, that may be of Service to all,
who are in the same Circumstances.</P>
<P>IF we consider the Affair of <HI>Marriage,</HI> as it is now
generally carried on in the World, there are innumerable Difficulties, which
damp pursuits of that Kind, in a Young Fellow, who, let him deserve ever
so well in other Respects, wants (what the World <HI>alone</HI> esteems
<HI>Merit)</HI> an ESTATE.</P>
<P>SOME of these Difficulties arise from the <HI>Women
themselves.</HI>—There are few among them to be found, who have any
Notion of Enjoyments, beyond mere <HI>sensual</HI> Gratificati∣ons. A
<HI>Masquerade</HI> affords them infinitely more Pleasure, than the
brightest Conversa∣tion; a <HI>Diamond</HI> has more Charms, than any of
the moral Virtues; and, I doubt not, there are some, who, for the Sake of
riding in a Coach and Six, would Yoke themselves with a <HI>verier
Beast,</HI> than any in their <HI>own Equipage.</HI> Let any one Traffick
with them for the dear Delights of <HI>Wealth,</HI> they will <HI>buy,</HI>
even at the <HI>highest Price</HI>;—That is, They will pay the
Purchase in what they prize most—<HI>Themselves.</HI>—And,
tho' hardly any Match, on these Considerations alone, has ever yet proved
happy, They still <PB N="376" REF="377"/> go on;—Notwithstanding they
are sure to <HI>repent,</HI> They never fail to make the <HI>Choice.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>How wretched is the faithful Youth,</L> 
<L>Since Womens Hearts were <HI>Bought</HI> and <HI>Sold!</HI></L> 
<L>They ask not Vows of sacred <HI>Truth,</HI></L> 
<L>Whene'er they s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh,
they s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh for
<HI>Gold.</HI></L></Q>
<P>OTHER Women there are, indeed, whose Minds, of a less
mercenary Cast, consider only the <HI>Merit</HI> of their Admirers; who are
capable of receiving that Love which flows from <HI>Esteem,</HI> and of
tasting Happiness from <HI>rational Enjoyments.</HI> But, how few of
these enjoy the Liberty of <HI>choosing for themselves?</HI> How many
groan under the Tyranny of an Avaritious Parent? who would no more part with
his Daughter, than his Land, to any but the <HI>best Purchaser.</HI> How
would he <HI>Scoff</HI> at a Young Man's Impudence? who, instead of paying
<HI>Her Price,</HI> should pretend to talk of Her <HI>Happiness!</HI></P>
<P>FROM thus much of the Sex, then, <HI>Money∣less Merit</HI>
seems intirely excluded. The Woman who has <HI>Liberty,</HI> as well as
<HI>Capacity,</HI> to make a prudent Choice, is the only one with whom we can
hope Success. And here arise new Difficulties, from another Side; The
<HI>Men</HI> are <HI>now</HI> our Hindrance, and one in my Correspondent's
Circumstances, must ex∣pect <HI>himself</HI> to suffer for the general
ill Cha∣racter of his <HI>Sex.</HI> Men daily shew them∣selves 
<PB N="377" REF="378"/> as little <HI>disinterested,</HI> in their
Pursuits, as Women. <HI>Age, Folly,</HI> and <HI>Ill-Nature,</HI> are no
Impediments to them, provided there be but <HI>Money.</HI>—Love, and
Esteem, are so frequently used as Pretences, while the real Affection is
only for the Fortune, that Women are alarm'd at the first Approach; and a
Young Fellow dares hardly Love, where Prudence only permits him to Love,
without incurring the odious Title of a <HI>For∣tune-hunter.</HI></P>
<P>IF therefore my Correspondent sincerely feels, within
himself, that disinterested Affe∣ction, which he seems to act by, I
would advise him to take all possible Methods to <HI>convince</HI> the
Lady of it; I need not direct him <HI>how</HI>; for, if he is sincere, his
Passion will discover it self in every Word and Action. But by no means
let him be <HI>hasty,</HI> in his Addresses.—With a Lady of her
Sense, his <HI>Modesty</HI> will add much to his <HI>Influence.</HI> True
Love springs not upon a sudden, and should he urge his Wishes, too far,
before her <HI>Inclination</HI> has improv'd itself into <HI>Affection,</HI>
she might ra∣tionally construe his Forwardness to proceed from other
Motives, than the genuine Effects of his personal, and disinterested,
Admira∣tion.</P>
<P>ON the other Side, I must take upon me to remind the Young Lady,
that <HI>Time</HI> is more in haste, than <HI>she</HI> is; and I would
ad∣vise her, if she is (as I presume) at her own Disposal, and if
she is satisfied of the <HI>Merit,</HI> <PB N="378" REF="379"/> as well as
the Affection, of our Young Law∣yer (as one of the Sense he ascribes to
her, may soon be) not to <HI>demur</HI> upon his Want of <HI>Fortune.</HI>
Happiness in Marriage, does not depend on Suitableness of
<HI>Estates,</HI> but of <HI>Tempers.</HI> If there be but a Competency on
<HI>one</HI> Side, no matter on which it lies.—<HI>Love,</HI> indeed,
should be <HI>reciprocal,</HI> but there is no Necessity, that
<HI>Fortune</HI> should. There is <HI>This more</HI> to be considered,
That, besides the Happiness of an agreeable Partner for Life, which she
will enjoy, in <HI>common</HI> with <HI>him,</HI> she will have the Addition
of a <HI>superior</HI> Satisfa∣ction, in the noble, and ever-pleasing
Refle∣ction, That she has intitled herself, as well to his
<HI>Gratitude,</HI> as his <HI>Love,</HI> by exalting a Man of <HI>Worth,</HI>
into <HI>Eminence,</HI> and <HI>Prosperity</HI>; who, otherwise, for
<HI>want</HI> only of That, which <HI>she abounded in,</HI> might have had
his Genius depress'd, and been <HI>lost in Obscurity.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Worthy SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I AM a Native of the <HI>Western Africa</HI>; a Subject of
the King of <HI>Tombuto:</HI> By <HI>Species</HI> I am no more than a
<HI>Monkey,</HI>; but I am in a fair Way to be made a <HI>Man:</HI> For a fine
young Lady, of a great Fortune, is fallen desperately in Love with me, and
prefers me, in the most open Manner, before all her <HI>other</HI>
Admirers.—But, in the midst of this unhop'd Felicity, comes a Feathery
Fool, called a <HI>Parrot,</HI> to a House, that is just over against us,
and has <HI>tattled</HI> himself into such <HI>Eminence,</HI> that they
talk of a Project on Foot, to remove him very shortly into a HOUSE of much
more Di∣stinction.</P>
<P> THE Competition I have observed, among your <HI>great

for this <HI>empty Prater,</HI> has <PB N="381" REF="382"/> provoked me to

<P>AMONG many Letters, I have lately received, the Two following will

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the <HI>PLAIN-DEALER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I AM seldom negligent, in my Atten∣dance at the
Coffee-House, upon those Days, when you favour the World with your
Lectures;—You very prudently entertain us, with a great deal of
<HI>Variety:</HI> Which is, doubtless, the most ready, and in∣fallible
Means of <HI>Improvement.</HI> For, if you altogether treated about Religious
or Mo∣ral Duties, you would be disregarded by your <HI>gay</HI> Readers, and
relish'd only by your <PB N="383" REF="384"/> <HI>Rational.</HI> But as we are
ignorant of what you will discourse, 'till we take up your Papers, we may,
out of Curiosity, be una∣wares catched, by an <HI>Admonition</HI> in
<HI>Mas∣querade,</HI> under the Disguise of a mere
Amusement.—</P>
<P> YOU have indulged no obscene, or im∣moral Reflections: But
have, on the con∣trary, discountenanced <HI>Vice</HI>; and supported
Religion, with Vivacity, and Frankness of Spirit; consequently, the
<HI>Inconsiderate</HI> may, by Degrees, be awakened into an Exertion of the
<HI>Thinking Faculty</HI>; by which chiefly we are distinguished, and
support our boast∣ed Superiority, over the <HI>brutal</HI> Creation. A
virtuous Reader of your Paper can at worst but be render'd <HI>chearful,</HI>
without Violation of his <HI>Innocence.</HI>—And your Writings being
generally <HI>pleasing,</HI> and very often <HI>useful,</HI> I flatter my
self, That Men are not so aban∣doned to Ignorance, as we are ready to
ima∣gine, since they give such a kind Accepta∣tion to you Essays, which
have no mean, or ungenerous Gratifications to recommend them.—</P>
<P> I LEARN, from your <HI>Plain Dealing,</HI> to be inoffensive
in Conversation; I observe all that passes, wherever I happen to be;
and endeavour, at the same Time, to <HI>contract</HI> or <HI>extend</HI> my
self, till I am grown <HI>fit</HI> for my Company. Though, by the Way, we
should resolutely preserve this most reason∣able <HI>Steadiness, on
no Account whatever, to</HI> <PB N="384" REF="385"/> <HI>humour a Friend at the
Expence of our Health, our Reputation, or our Virtue.</HI> FRIEND, did I say?
I retract the Appellation;—For certainly, if we think right, that
Person who solicites us to Actions inconsistent with Rea∣son, with
Honour, or with Decency, is un∣deserving of so sublime a
Character.—But (this single Exception allow'd for) we should
condescend to appear blind to the Weak∣nesses of those we converse
with—And he, who acts otherwise, will justly incur the Censure of
an odious, and scornful Auste∣rity.—A Man's <HI>first</HI> Care
should be to avoid the Reproaches of his own Heart, and his <HI>second</HI>
to escape the ill Wishes of other People.</P>
<P> WE learn, with Delight, from such <HI>Plain Dealing</HI> as
yours, That a wise Man's Busi∣ness is to subdue the Roughness of
Passion, into the Calmness of a tranquil Humility; And that the more his
Knowledge is en∣larg'd, the more he will perceive <HI>wanting,</HI> to be
search'd after. <HI>Tully</HI> tells us, The Mind of a wise Man never
<HI>swells,</HI> nor be∣comes <HI>elated.</HI> For my own Part, I fancied my
self, when I was young, to be acquaint- with every Thing: But now, I can
perceive my Learning contracted with a narrow Cir∣cle, and almost obscured
in a <HI>dark Point</HI>; when compared with that infinite, and
in∣exhaustible Number of Subjects, to which I am an utter Stranger. In a
Word, I am convinced, That an ill-grounded Conceit∣edness 
<PB N="385" REF="386"/> of our own Abilities is the most con∣temptible
Weakness of Nature: And, even where it may seem justified, by our real
Merit, it renders odious, and supportable, the very <HI>Virtue,</HI> which
Occasions it.</P>
<P> BUT, to make a Transition, from what <HI>I learn from</HI>
you, to an Information I intend to <HI>give you</HI>; There is a pretty Maxim
in the <HI>Guardian,</HI> to <HI>think</HI> with the <HI>Wise,</HI> but
<HI>talk</HI> with the <HI>Vulgar</HI>: Which occurr'd strongly to my Memory,
upon observing with what Pleasure your late <HI>Cambridge</HI> Letter,
con∣cerning some little feminine Exravagancies, was received in all
Places.—Give me Leave, therefore, to entertain you with a strange, and
fearful Discovery, which, it was lately my Fortune to make, upon passing
a Night or Two, in a Country Village.—It was in a Ramble, last
Harvest, I had the Honour to wait on a <HI>Widow,</HI> (as well
<HI>stor'd</HI> as the <HI>Fields</HI> were) in a kind of
<HI>Progress,</HI> to visit her Tenants.—</P>
<P> AFTER Dinner, one Day, I left the good Company, with their
honest Entertainers, the Farmer and his narrative Family, to accompany the
<HI>Inhabitants</HI> of the <HI>Yard</HI>; and enjoy the silent Serenity of a
very beau∣tiful Prospect; which was bounded by the Shade of Trees and Hills,
with ruin'd Buildings, at a little Distance from the Cot∣tage.—I was
envying the Happiness, and Quiet, of these unbusy People; and had
wander'd, as it were insensibly, over half a <PB N="386" REF="387"/> Dozen
Stiles, into the Remoteness of a hollow sandy way: Where I stood with
great Delight, to observe the Fall of a pret∣ty <HI>Rill,</HI> which
gushing out from among the Rushes above, roll'd down the sandy Bank, and
shap'd it self a Passage, along the Bot∣tom of the Road I walk'd in.
The Gloomi∣ness that was spread all round, had fitted this Place, above all
I had ever seen, for the Abode of fantastick Melancholly: And whilst I
was busied in Thoughts of this Nature, I saw a Country Woman ha∣sten
towards me, who wav'd her Hand, as she came forward, and cried out to me, to
<HI>walk on.—For I was standing at Gooddy</HI> Hubbard<HI>'s watering
Place!</HI>—</P>
<P> AS soon as the good Woman came near enough to be ask'd,
<HI>What she meant,</HI> I found, that Gooddy <HI>Hubbard</HI> was a
<HI>Witch,</HI> that lived in the Wood: And, that if any <HI>Cow, Horse,</HI>
or other Cattle, staid long enough in that Place, to drink of its
<HI>enchanted Water,</HI> All the Hay they should eat, from that Time
forward, would be turned into <HI>crooked Pins,</HI> and the poor Beasts
must certainly <HI>die after it.</HI> I begged she would go along with me,
to shew me the Witch's House: To which Proposition she replied, with
inexpressible Consternati∣on, <HI>She would not, for the World, be so
pre∣sumptuous:</HI> She added, That it was about half a Mile off, and shook
her Head, and assured me, that the whole Village trem∣bled 
<PB N="387" REF="388"/> at the Sight of this <HI>Goody Hubbard.</HI> That, for
her own Part very lately, as she was Gleaning in a Field, by the Wood's Side,
the Witch had appeared to her out of the Hedge, in the Shape of the Leaf of a
Tree: And ran along before her, and play'd Gambols, over and over in her Path,
all the Way, as she came home again.—I ask'd her, Whether she had
found any ill Consequence, after so terrible an Accident? And she
answer'd, (with great Innocence and Gravity) That she had but too much
Reason to believe, she was <HI>bewitched,</HI> ha∣ving many
<HI>strange</HI> and <HI>wicked Thoughts</HI> run∣ning ever Day in her Head,
about Things she had never been troubled with, (till that unfortunate Leaf
fell in her way) since she was a <HI>Maid,</HI> or but little better.</P>
<P> I COULD not resist the Temptation, which these silly
Stories left me under, of making a <HI>Visit</HI> to the formidable
<HI>Gooddy Hubbard</HI>; whom I found, in a little Hovel, which the Charity of
the Lord of the Manor had or∣dered to be built for her, in the Wood; be∣cause
the honest People of the Village, ha∣ving taken it into their Heads to make a
<HI>Witch</HI> of the poor old Woman, fell upon her, as often as she came in
their Way: And had two or three times endangered her Life, by scratching her
with their Nails, till every Body had <HI>fetch'd Blood</HI> of her, (as the
Phrase is) after which, it seems, no <HI>Witch,</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
has Power to hurt a Hair of any Person's Head, who takes this effectual Way
to <HI>disarm</HI> her,</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="389"/> I CAME off, with no other Damage, than
the Loss of all the Money I had in my Pocket; which the Influence of
downright Compassion compelled me to leave behind, for the Comfort of an
afflicted Creature, whose unsupported Age, and Wretched∣ness, instead
of the <HI>Relief</HI> or <HI>Pity,</HI> which was due to them by
<HI>Nature,</HI> had procur'd her the malicious Rage, and Persecution, of
<HI>unthinking Ignorance!</HI>—I return'd to my <HI>Widow</HI>; and after
a long and plesant Con∣versation, on the Subject of <HI>Witchcraft,</HI>
agreed heartily with her, That there were <HI>such Things as Witches</HI>;
and took upon me to assure, with a <HI>Sigh,</HI> and a <HI>downcast
Eye,</HI> That I had, <HI>my self,</HI> suffer'd, so severely, by one
of them, that I never expected to become my <HI>own Man</HI> again; though I
should live to the Age of a <HI>Patriarch.</HI>—</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> CASTING my Eye upon <HI>Horace,</HI> I found this excellent
Piece of Advice, <HI>Leges &amp; Perscrutabere Doctos.</HI> As I gene∣rally
put in Practice what I read, in Pursu∣ance to his Advice, I sent for a Set
of your Papers, and am now carefully perusing <PB N="389" REF="390"/> them. I
take the same Method that Law∣yers generally do with their <HI>Reports,</HI>
read the Modern Cases first, so go upward, till they come to the
Fountain-Head. But, when I light upon some of your <HI>Female</HI>
Cor∣respondents, it puts me in Mind of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Ladies, of old;
they resemble them so much in <HI>Spirit,</HI> and <HI>Passion,</HI>
that I verily believe, many of their <HI>Great Great Grand∣mothers</HI> lye
buried in the <HI>Campus Martius,</HI> or the <HI>Capitol.</HI> 'Tis not
incredible, That, af∣ter <HI>Caesar</HI> had first enter'd
<HI>Britain,</HI> some of their <HI>Legionary Ladies,</HI> upon the Fame of
the <HI>Britons</HI> unwearied Courage, might make a second <HI>Roman
Invasion,</HI> and <HI>with as good Success as</HI> Caesar, after
<HI>he</HI> had opened a Passage for them.</P>
<P> <HI>LIVY,</HI> some where, tells us, That when the old
Gentlemen of <HI>Rome</HI> were contri∣ving a Scheme to have more of their
La∣dies good Company at home, the <HI>Women rose up in Arms,</HI> to the
great Surprize of the <HI>Roman</HI> State; That they denied the
<HI>Senators</HI> a free Passage to the House: And, that <HI>Cato</HI> by
Name, had like to have been <HI>carried off</HI> by the <HI>Mob.</HI> They
claimed, as their ancient <HI>Rights,</HI> and undoubted <HI>Pri∣vileges,</HI>
almost as strange Things, as your <HI>Mistress</HI> does, in her late
Scheme for esta∣blishing a <HI>Female Parliament.</HI> However, upon a
<HI>Parly</HI> between both Parties, the <HI>Women</HI> submitted the Case
to the <HI>Senate:</HI> Where, they always carried the <HI>Majority,</HI>
though 'tis well known, no Lady sate in <PB N="390" REF="391"/>
<HI>House.</HI> Nor was that at all surprizing: For if we examine
History, I believe, we shall find, the <HI>Senate,</HI> at that Time,
con∣sisted more of <HI>Wits,</HI> than of <HI>Wise Men</HI>; over whom,
for the sake of <HI>Politeness,</HI> the <HI>Women</HI> must have most
Influence; nor is it less probable, that their being in Arms might
<HI>frighten</HI> the <HI>old</HI> Gentlemen.</P>
<P> THE Use of <HI>Bribery</HI> likewise, had then newly been
found out; and, I dare say, there was no Lady, who had not about her,
<HI>wherewithal</HI> to <HI>purchase a Vote.</HI> Such was the Courage of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Ladies of old: And how exactly our <HI>Moderns</HI> imitate
them, is, I believe, too plain to need de∣scribing: Happy, therefore it is,
and much for the <HI>Peace of Great Britain,</HI> that our Parliament has never
attempted the Mo∣deration of their exorbitant <HI>Hoops,</HI> or the
Abridgement of their <HI>Pin-Money!</HI> For my Part I must frankly
confess, I have no Ob∣jection to make against Mrs. <HI>Patty Amble</HI>'s
Proposal. Other Men may have their <HI>Fears,</HI> from the supposed
<HI>Consequences</HI> of a <HI>Female Parliament</HI>: But, I think, they are
<HI>out</HI> in their <HI>Politicks.</HI>—If a Power grows always
<HI>weaker,</HI> the more it is <HI>divided,</HI> Let <HI>me</HI> be a
<HI>Republican,</HI> in <HI>Love,</HI> and chuse rather to pay Obebience to
<HI>Five Hundred</HI> of these pretty COMMONS; that live a <HI>Slave,</HI> to
<HI>One, Sole</HI> TYRANT; and neither <HI>enjoy,</HI> nor dare <HI>talk</HI>

</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, <HI>March</HI> 19. 1725.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I FELL lately into Company with a Class of young Poets, who
affect to be Admir∣ers of <HI>Tasso,</HI> and were Extravagant in their
Praise of a <HI>Simile,</HI> in his <HI>Gierusalemme,</HI> where the
<HI>Devil,</HI> maligning the Success of the <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Arms, is
said, To <HI>bite his Lips, and spurn up the Floor of Hell, in bellowing
Rage, like a wild Bull, when the Dogs are baiting him.</HI></P>
<P>THEY made me promise, That I would give them my impartial
Opinion; and, be∣cause they earnestly press to know it, I will borrow the
Reflections of a Friend, on the Subject of <HI>Similes, in general</HI>; which
contain whatever I would say, were I to speak con∣cerning the Nature of
this great Ornament to Poetry; than which there is nothing more capable of
being made either <HI>delightful</HI> or <HI>ridiculous,</HI> according as it
is used, discreetly, or at random.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="393"/>THE Use, which a Poet ought to make of
<HI>Comparisons,</HI> is to <HI>illustrate</HI> the Object re∣presented;
that is, to enlighten and enlarge the Apprehension of the Reader. The Na∣ture
therefore, of the Thing, which is <HI>com∣pared,</HI> must correspond
exactly with what it is <HI>compared to:</HI> There must not only be an
ap∣parent <HI>Resemblance,</HI> but a visible <HI>Proportion.</HI> A Thing
<HI>low,</HI> and <HI>inconsiderable,</HI> may be <HI>like</HI> enough to
something <HI>great,</HI> and <HI>magnificent</HI>; but then, wanting Dignity
to appear in its Company, no Poet of Judgment should sub∣mit to make Use
of it.—I will give the Reader an Instance of a very remarkable Fault of
this Kind;—Sir <HI>Richard Black∣more,</HI> in his <HI>Prince
Arthur,</HI> has been pleased to compare the Devil, looking down from a
Mountain, on the <HI>British</HI> Camp, to a <HI>Toad,</HI> on the Border of
a Walk looking up at the Gardener.</P>
<Q> 
<L>While, with malignant Eyes, th' Apostate view'd</L> 
<L>Their Host, with <HI>Octa</HI>'s Message pleas'd, he
stood,</L> 
<L>Stung deep with Malice, and with Envy torn,</L> 
<L>While all his <HI>Veins,</HI> like <HI>Aetna</HI>'s Furnace,
burn.</L></Q>
<P>THE <HI>Veins</HI> of the Devil, I suppose, were not so much
owing to Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Forget∣fulness, that he was describing a
<HI>Spirit</HI>; as to a politick Design of reducing <HI>Satan</HI> to
downright <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> that the Reader, conceiving a
more humble Opinion of him, than he had been taught in his In∣fancy, 
<PB N="393" REF="394"/> might be the better prepar'd for the <HI>Toad</HI> in
the Comparison.</P>
<Q> 
<L>And Streams of Fire, from his red Eye-balls flow'd,</L> 
<L>Like Light'ning, breaking from a low'ring Cloud:</L> 
<L>As when a <HI>Toad,</HI> squat on a Border, spies</L> 
<L>The Gard'ner passing by, his Bloodshot Eyes,</L> 
<L>With Spite, and Rage inflam'd, dart Fire around</L> 
<L>The verdant Walks, and on the flow'ry Ground,</L> 
<L>The bloated Vermin loathsome Poison spits,</L> 
<L>And swoln, and bursting with his Hatred, sits:</L> 
<L><HI>So</HI> the <HI>fall'n Angel,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P><HI>FALLEN</HI> indeed, if no abler to do Harm to Sir
<HI>Richard</HI>'s Hero, than his <HI>Toad</HI> to the Gardener! Where is the
terrible <HI>Power,</HI> the wily restless <HI>Malice,</HI> the insatiate
revengeful <HI>Application,</HI> of this dangerous Enemy to Mankind, in Sir
<HI>Richard</HI>'s <HI>humble Simile?</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Toad</HI> may be <HI>poisonous,</HI> but then he may be
<HI>trod upon,</HI> which is by no Means, the Case of the <HI>Devil.</HI> If
a Poet, who introdu∣ces <HI>Satan,</HI> thus <HI>inraged,</HI> would imagine a
Comparison, to aggrandize the Horror of his Reader's Conception, it must
certainly arise from nothing, which we are to look <HI>down</HI> upon; no
little, venomous, inconsiderable Creature; The Elements should War
toge∣ther, on such Occasions, as these; the Skies should blaze with
Lightning; the World reel with Earthquakes; the Sea rise to Hea∣ven; the
Poles crack with Thunder; and <PB N="394" REF="395"/> all <HI>Nature</HI> groan,
with Variety of Convul∣sions.—<HI>Toad, Poison, Squat, Bloated,
Spits, Vermin, Loathsome, Swoln, Bursting!</HI> What Image can arise from
such Expressions as these, which is either <HI>like,</HI> or
<HI>agreeable?</HI></P>
<P>TO say Truth, no <HI>Simile</HI> at all should have been
introduced in the Place I have been complaining against: The natural
Concep∣tion of a Reader, can represent to his <HI>Fancy</HI> the Idea of the
Devil, looking angry from a Mountain, much better, than any common Image, of
Things known, can represent it to his <HI>Memory.</HI> A Comparison is
never to be made, but where the Object to be described is less known, or
less conceivable, than some∣thing else, which, being of equal Grandeur
and Importance, will also illustrate, and rivet it on the
Understanding.</P>
<P>THE Descriptions, and Similes, which we meet with in
<HI>Milton,</HI> give us quite other Ideas of this dreadful Rebel-Angel.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Scarce had he ceas'd, when the superior Fiend</L> 
<L>Was moving tow'rd the Shore; his pondrous Shield</L> 
<L>Behind him cast, the broad Circumference</L> 
<L>Hung on his Shoulders, like the <HI>Moon,</HI>
&amp;c.—</L> 
<L>His Spear, to equal which, the tallest Pine,</L> 
<L>Hewn on <HI>Norwegian</HI> Hills, to be the Mast</L> 
<L>Of some great Admiral, were but a <HI>Wand</HI></L> 
<L>He walk'd with, to support uneasy Steps</L> 
<L>Over the burning Marl.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="395" REF="396"/>Again, 
<Q> 
<L>Forth came in Order the infernal Peers,</L> 
<L>'Midst them their <HI>mighty Paramount,</HI> who
seem'd</L> 
<L><HI>Alone,</HI> th' Antagonist of Heaven! nor
<HI>less</HI></L> 
<L>Than Hell's dread Emperor! with Pomp supreme,</L> 
<L>And Godlike, imitated State, Him round,</L> 
<L>A Globe of fiery <HI>Seraphim</HI> inclosed.</L></Q></P>
<P>And again, 
<Q> 
<L>—<HI>Satan,</HI> above the Rest,</L> 
<L>In Shape, and Gesture, proudly <HI>eminent!</HI></L> 
<L>Stood, like a <HI>Tower;</HI> nor yet his Form appear'd</L> 
<L><HI>Less,</HI> than <HI>Arch-Angel ruin'd</HI>; and th'
Excess</L> 
<L>Of Glory obscur'd; As when the <HI>Sun</HI> new-ris'n,</L> 
<L>Shorn of his Beams, looks thro' the misty Air.</L> 
<L>Deep Scars of Thunder had <HI>intrenc'd</HI> his Face;</L> 
<L><HI>Care,</HI> on his faded Cheeks sat, under Brows</L> 
<L>Of dauntless Courage, and considerate Pride.</L></Q></P>
<P>HAVING named Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> I am well enough aware, That Sir
<HI>Richard</HI> may endea∣vour a Justification from <HI>that</HI> great
Poet's Example; who has made Use, in another Place, of this very Simile of a
<HI>Toad,</HI> when <HI>he also</HI> is describing <HI>Satan</HI>; but,
pray, ob∣serve with what Difference, as well in the Occasion, as the
Conduct.</P>
<P><HI>SATAN,</HI> after having changed himself into many different
Shapes, to avoid a Disco∣very, by those Angelick Guards, which were 
<PB N="396" REF="397"/> plac'd about Paradise, is met with, at last, by one
of the Parties.</P>
<Q> 
<L>So saying, on he led his radiant Files,</L> 
<L>Dazling the Moon; These to the Bower direct,</L> 
<L>In Search of whom they sought. Him there they found,</L> 
<L><HI>Squat,</HI> like a <HI>Toad,</HI> close at the
<HI>Ear</HI> of <HI>Eve.</HI></L></Q>
<P>BESIDES his Necessity of providing against
<HI>Discovery,</HI> (of which he was in no Danger in Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s
Poem) he takes the Shape of a <HI>Toad,</HI> as most proper, while
<HI>Eve</HI> was asleep, to approach her closely, concealed among the
Flowers, and sweet Herbs, on which she lay.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Assaying, by his Devilish Art, to reach</L> 
<L>The Organs of her Fancy; <HI>there to forge</HI></L> 
<L>Illusions, as he lists.—</L></Q>
<P>OBSERVE here, that the Devil is in no <HI>Rage,</HI> when thus
compared; but, on the contrary, under much <HI>Terror,</HI> and endeavour∣ing
to <HI>deceive</HI> and <HI>circumvent,</HI> and therefore obliged in Policy,
to assume that Form, which was rather suitable to his <HI>End,</HI> than
answerable to his <HI>Power.</HI> But, when he appears in his <HI>proper
Likeness,</HI> the very Angels are represented, as terrified, and
start∣ing back, with Amazement.</P>
<Q><PB N="397" REF="398"/> 
<L>Him, thus intent, <HI>Ithuriel,</HI> with his Spear,</L> 
<L>Touch'd lightly, for no Falsehood can endure</L> 
<L>Touch of Celestial Temper, but returns</L> 
<L>Perforce to its own Likeness—Up he starts,</L> 
<L>Discover'd, and surpriz'd! As when a Spark</L> 
<L>Lights on a <HI>nitrous Heap,</HI> the smutty Grain,</L> 
<L>With sudden Blaze diffus'd, <HI>inflames</HI> the
<HI>Air:</HI></L> 
<L>So started up, in his own Shape, the <HI>Fiend;</HI></L> 
<L>Back stept the Two fair Angels, half amaz'd,</L> 
<L>So sudden, to <HI>behold</HI> the <HI>grisly

<P>NOTHING of this is <HI>little,</HI> nothing
<HI>dimi∣nishing:</HI> The whole is natural, terrible, ma∣jestick,
surprizing, and becoming the Dignity of the Subject, it relates to.</P>
<P>A <HI>Simile,</HI> should, if possible, be <HI>alike,</HI>
in all its Parts; It is enough, that some <HI>one</HI> Quality of the
Comparison resemble some <HI>one</HI> Part, or Nature of the Object it is
compared to.—<HI>Homer</HI> has been infinitely guilty of this Error;
hurried, as it were, away with the Ra∣pidity of his Imagination, he seldom
staid to weigh any more of a Simile, than that very Part of it, which
suited his Purpose; not mindful enough, that upon starting an Ob∣ject, to
which many Qualities are common, the Apprehension of the Reader, is not,
per∣haps, at Leisure to examine which <HI>particular</HI> Quality includes
the <HI>Resemblance,</HI> and there∣fore discerns not any Likeness at
all, but with such Trouble, and Application, as totally destroy the very
End of a <HI>Simile.</HI> For if the <PB N="398" REF="399"/> Design of this
Ornament be to <HI>illustrate</HI> a <HI>De∣scription,</HI> it ought not
certainly to be found <HI>obscure</HI> in <HI>itself.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is, in the noble <HI>Greek</HI> Poet above∣mentioned, a
famous Comparison of <HI>Ajax,</HI> who retreats slow, from an overpowering
Crowd of <HI>Trojans</HI>; to an <HI>Ass</HI> in an <HI>Enclosure,</HI>
surrounded and beaten by the Sticks of the Village, but walking gravely,
notwithstan∣ding, toward the Gap, he came in at, and stopping very
frequently, to <HI>eat,</HI> in his Way: Monsieur <HI>Dacier, Bossu,</HI>
and all the <HI>French</HI> Criticks, who are not Converts to Monsieur
<HI>Perault</HI>'s Observations, have taken a great deal of Pains to
justify this Simile of <HI>Homer</HI>'s; But, in my Opinion, they are all
mistaken, not only in the <HI>Defence,</HI> but in the very
<HI>Ac∣cusation:</HI> It is not so much the <HI>Ass,</HI> that
de∣serves Blame, since he was in those Days a <HI>Beast</HI> of Great
<HI>Quality:</HI> It is rather, that the Resem∣blance is <HI>partial,</HI>
where it ought to have been <HI>total.</HI>—The <HI>stiff, reluctant,
Receding</HI> of <HI>Ajax</HI> from his Enemies, is certainly well hit, in the
Ob∣stinacy of the <HI>Ass</HI>; but where is that Part of the Comparison,
which should enliven to our Imaginations, his frequent Return to Slaugh∣ter?
His Impatience of Soul? That Fierce∣ness, Indignation, and revengeful
Intrepidity, which the Poet's <HI>Description</HI> had also prepa∣red us to
expect in his <HI>Simile?</HI> The <HI>Ass,</HI> with∣out doubt, was <HI>loth
to depart,</HI> as <HI>Ajax,</HI> but he was neither so apt to be
<HI>angry,</HI> nor so dangerous, if he became so.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="400"/>COMPARISONS, to conclude this Reflection,
can never be proper in <HI>Passions,</HI> or violent Emotions of Mind; The
Imagination is then too much transported, and inflamed, to cast about for
<HI>cool Resemblances.</HI> But in the Mouth of the Poet, that is to say,
in the Course of the <HI>Narration,</HI> and not in the <HI>Speeches,</HI>
they are beautiful, and necessary. They <HI>describe</HI> Passion
well, though they do not <HI>express</HI> it: And, to say all in a Word,
Where <HI>Descrip∣tion alone</HI> appears too weak to imprint an Idea on the
Mind of a Reader, there the only effectual Remedy is to have Recourse to a
<HI>Simile.</HI></P>

<P>SINCE <HI>Love,</HI> which, in both Sexes, is the most
irresistable of our Passions, has its strongest Influence on
<HI>Woman</HI>; I cou'd ne∣ver observe That Cruelty and malicious
Sa∣vageness of <HI>Jealousy,</HI> which actuates the <HI>La∣dies,</HI>
against those whom they consider as <PB N="400" REF="401"/> their

That they hate the Object of their Resentment, for only <HI>think∣ing,</HI>

a Letter, so intirely <HI>new,</HI> and writ with so much <HI>natural</HI>
Force, and Sweetness, that it is impossible the Reader shou'd not feel
the same Effect from it, that I did.—I suppress, for the sake of
<HI>Modesty,</HI> and not without some Re∣luctance, and Mortification to my
<HI>Vanity,</HI> an introductory Paragraph, fill'd with the most obliging,
and gentile, Praises of the PLAIN DEALER; and hasten, at once, into the
Sub∣ject of the Letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<P> I AM led, (observes this charming Cor∣respondent) to
imagine <HI>Friendship</HI> the Favourite Passion of your Soul, because
your Sentiments seem finely turn'd for it.—<HI>Mine</HI> too, as far as
its inferior Faculties permit, is truly sensible of, and devoted to
it.—But I never felt it so forcibly, as I <PB N="401" REF="402"/> did
the other Day, in a Visit, which I made to a young Lady, a dear and intimate
Friend, in the Country.</P>
<P> SHE retir'd from me, not long since, to indulge a silent
Grief, which I, and every Body, had taken Notice of, but which she had
endeavour'd to conceal from her Ac∣quaintance, with a Care, as earnest, as it
was vain. For her Eyes, and alter'd Com∣plexion, made it evident to all, who
loved her, and therefore delighted to look on her, that there was something
at her Heart, too melancholy for <HI>Solitude,</HI> and yet too
<HI>engag'd</HI> for <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P> THE Privilege of our Intimacy intro∣duced me to her Chamber,
without No∣tice, or Ceremony; where I found her, writing, and
<HI>alone.</HI>—The Subject, which her Thoughts were fill'd with, had
fixed her in so profound an Attention, that it gave me Freedom and
Opportunity, to stand a while, and observe the beautiful Distress of
her Mind, which was <HI>lost</HI> and labour'd in a <HI>meaning
Sadness,</HI> and preven∣ted her from seeing, or supposing, that there
was any Body so near her.</P>
<P> NEVER was <HI>Sorrow</HI> so Majestical! so sweetly
<HI>Noble!</HI>—Her lively Features were soften'd into a
<HI>Languishment,</HI> that was love∣lier, than <HI>Health,</HI> and more
charming, than <HI>Transport!</HI>—Her <HI>Eyes</HI> seem'd to have
<HI>conspir'd,</HI> against the Purpose of her <HI>Hands:</HI> For they
stream'd down <HI>Tears</HI> upon the <PB N="402" REF="403"/> Paper, as if
they would <HI>efface</HI> the mourn∣ful Words, as fast as she had written
them. And, now and then, a <HI>Sigh,</HI> (such as <HI>Love alone</HI>
inspires) swell'd her conscious, and distracted, Bosom.</P>
<P> AT last, she saw <HI>me,</HI> and
<HI>trembled!</HI>—She rose, in Confusion, and came forward, to
embrace me, which while she was do∣ing, she press'd into my Bosom, the
Paper, she had been writing: And, with a vio∣lent <HI>Burst</HI> of Tears,
breaking suddenly from my Neck, flew, down a Pair of Back-Stairs, into the
Garden; and left me Speech∣less, with Astonishment!</P>
<P> I FOUND the Paper address'd to <HI>me:</HI> And I leave you
to imagine, whether my <HI>Surprize</HI> was at all abated, when I perus'd in
it, the following Discovery of the un∣guess'd <HI>Cause</HI> of my dear
Friend's <HI>Retire∣ment.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<P> OH! my ever-lov'd!—my faithful Friend!—my Heart is
flowing to you, with <HI>such</HI> Shame, and <HI>confessing
Pe∣nitence,</HI> as they who are serene enough to enjoy the Comforts of
<HI>Devotion,</HI> address all-pitying <HI>Heaven</HI> with.—My
Misery is so truly great, that nothing but the <HI>Sin</HI> of having
<HI>conceal'd a Thought from you,</HI> cou'd have given it the least
<HI>Addition.</HI></P> 
<P> BUT, let me hasten to <HI>impart,</HI> to you, the only
Grief, I cou'd have had a Reason for <HI>hiding</HI> from you—I
<HI>love</HI>—Oh! how <PB N="403" REF="404"/> shall my Confusion
preserve Strength to go on? while I add—That it is—<HI>Your
Hus∣band!</HI>—Let His <HI>Perfection</HI> plead for me, if you
<HI>start</HI> at this Declaration.—And, oh! <HI>confess,</HI> what
you have experienc'd, so undeniably,—<HI>That none cou'd have seen
him, as I have, without being as guilty, as I am.</HI></P> 
<P> I WAS dull enough to imagine, That <HI>Friendship</HI> having
possess'd my Heart, wou'd have <HI>guarded</HI> it, against
<HI>Love:</HI> But, oh! <HI>That</HI> Thought has <HI>lost</HI> me!</P> 
<P> IT was the fatal Happiness of being <HI>near you,</HI> that
discover'd to me the Beauties of his Mind,—His respectful
Tenderness, for <HI>You:</HI> His impartial, and distinguishing Affection
for his <HI>Children!</HI>—His Contempt of the <HI>Proud,</HI> and
<HI>Ignoble</HI>; And his Com∣passion for the <HI>Friendless,</HI> and
<HI>Unhappy!</HI>—Oh! how fatally is He accomplish'd!—and how
<HI>deserving</HI> your Affection!</P> 
<P> CONCEAL from him, oh, my Friend! the Knowledge, that He has
made me <HI>wretched:</HI> For, <HI>yet,</HI> my Eyes, and my Actions have been
so watchfully <HI>guarded,</HI> that <HI>He</HI> is as much a Stranger to it,
as all the World, but <HI>Yourself</HI>; from whom to have <HI>conceal'd</HI>
it, appear'd to me as <HI>Crimi∣nal,</HI> as <HI>not</HI> to have conceal'd it
from your Husband.</P> 
<P> THIS, only, <HI>dreadful,</HI> Cause shou'd have torn me
from your lov'd Society.—Suffer me, <HI>here,</HI> to bury myself, in
the <HI>Innocence</HI> of <HI>Solitude</HI>; till Absence, or Death, shall 
<PB N="404" REF="405"/> have put an End to the Tyranny, with which <HI>Love</HI>
has triumph'd over me.</P> 
<P> I KNOW you are too generous to ex∣pect, on this sad
Occasion, any dull, or mean, <HI>Excuses.</HI>—Where the
<HI>Will</HI> is not guilty, the <HI>Misfortune</HI> is sufficient
<HI>Atone∣ment.</HI> But, tho' you have no Pretence for <HI>Pardoning,</HI> I
flatter myself, you will <HI>weep for</HI> me; and, in Pity, now and then,
<HI>see</HI> your ever faithful, unhappy, Friend, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
<P> I leave Her noble Letter, and the In∣fluence it had, on my
Soul, to your beau∣tiful Imagination, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, who may convert it to
the <HI>Use,</HI> and <HI>Pleasure,</HI> of your Readers.—Truth

<HI>ought</HI> to have acted, you shall know, in a se∣cond Letter, how I
really <HI>did act</HI>; and its Consequences.—I am, with all

And the <HI>World,</HI> which seem'd to tremble, under the Weight of his

to distinguish such a <HI>Death</HI> as <HI>His</HI> was!</P>
<P>WHAT a mortifying <HI>Check</HI> upon the Ex∣travagance of humane

<HI>ex∣pire,</HI> by the natural Course of our Days, be∣fore the

examining,</HI> and <HI>deciding upon,</HI> our Schemes and Actions, with a

<P>HOW infinite had been the Progress of this prodigious Prince's

to trace the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of <HI>Al∣mighty Power,</HI> that proportions
<HI>Blessings</HI> to <HI>Necessities:</HI> And neither grants, nor

<HI>ough to be.</HI>—In the early Ages of the World, when <HI>Arts</HI>

that Men should <HI>live,</HI> those many Hundred Years, which, now, we

be, proportionably, <HI>shorter.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, be this as it will, the most sparkling Ornament of
<HI>Mortality,</HI> is now become <HI>im∣mortal!</HI>—The Soul of PETER

<HI>Scope enough,</HI> upon the Shoreless Ocean of <HI>Eternity,</HI> for all

impending Ruin of that King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Hostile Country!—Let
One of these Consi∣derations, <PB N="412" REF="413"/> I say, be weigh'd
against the other; and then, point out any Example, from Hi∣story, of so
<HI>amiable a Greatness!</HI> so <HI>sincere,</HI> and <HI>sweet,</HI>
a <HI>Magnanimity!</HI></P>
<P>LET His <HI>Application</HI> be measured by the Success of His
unwearied Labours!—They, who look into <HI>Russia,</HI> as it now
<HI>is,</HI> and re∣member what it <HI>was,</HI> within <HI>Twenty</HI> Years
past, will scarce believe themseves free from the Influence of some
<HI>Enchantment,</HI> when they see Cities of <HI>Sixty thousand
Houses,</HI> cover∣ing the Shoar, where (so lately) a few Fish∣ermen
dried their Nets!—When they be∣hold a <HI>Sea</HI> filled with <HI>His
Ships of War,</HI> whom they can remember, when He was not Ma∣ster of <HI>One
single Harbour!</HI>—When they see <HI>Nature</HI> reduc'd by
<HI>Art,</HI> to yield Occasions, she was most <HI>repugnant</HI>
to!—Distant Seas taught to <HI>incorporate!</HI> Mountains forc'd to
give Way to <HI>Rivers!</HI> New Engines, and Arts of War, as well offensive,
as defensive!—New Customs! New Trades! New <HI>Souls!</HI> And a Face
of universal Knowledge and Politeness, smiling in all Parts of a Land,
which was so lately over-run with the darkest Ignorance, and
Barbarity!—And, when they shall be told, That all these
astonish∣ing Changes, are the mere Effects of <HI>One</HI> Man's
prodigious, and unbounded, Mind, what less can they say, in
<HI>Answer,</HI> than, That <HI>such a Man</HI> had been a <HI>God,</HI>
could His <HI>Body</HI> have been rendered, but as <HI>immortal,</HI> as His
<HI>Fame</HI> is?</P>

Wings of His aspiring <HI>Eagle,</HI> shadow'd both Extreams of the
<HI>Christian World:</HI> And the <HI>Turks</HI> look'd, with Horror, on the
Vengeance, which they saw so <HI>near</HI> them.—And, in this only
Particular, I am sorry to observe, that the Author of the NORTHEN STAR, was
less a <HI>Prophet,</HI> than he imagin'd.—<HI>Death</HI> intercepted
the glorious Race, when the <HI>Goal</HI> was just in View, and left the

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> THERE are none of your Essays, which more intitle you to my
Esteem, than those, which you have been inspir'd with, by the most
generous, and gentle, Passion, that acts on, and adorns Humanity.—I
need not tell you, after this, that the Passion, I mean, is LOVE.—You
have eonfess'd yourself a <HI>Lover</HI>; and, if you <HI>had not,</HI> I
should have <HI>guess'd it,</HI> by the Warmth, and Spirit, of your
Sentiments, when you attempt any thing, on that Subject.—A
<HI>Warmth,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> Mr. PLAIN DEALER, which agree so ill,
with your <HI>Grand Climacte∣rick,</HI> that (if it were not for the
<HI>implicite Reve∣rence,</HI> with which I conclude myself
<HI>mistaken,</HI> when you assert, what I find <HI>difficult</HI> to
<HI>be∣lieve</HI>) I should suppose your <HI>Age,</HI> as chime∣rical, 
<PB N="417" REF="418"/> as your <HI>Situation</HI>; and no more look for you,
among the <HI>Old,</HI> than upon the <HI>Watch-Tower</HI> of
<HI>Barbican.</HI></P>
<P> BUT, let <HI>that</HI> pass: No matter, whether you are
<HI>Old,</HI> or <HI>no,</HI> since I will admit, that you are
<HI>Venerable.</HI>—I reverence <HI>you,</HI> for that Reverence, with
which you speak of <HI>Love,</HI> and the <HI>Ladies.</HI> The <HI>light
World,</HI> Mr. PLAIN DEALER, have no Taste for the refined Ideas, which
almost <HI>deify</HI> this sacred Passion. But, let me perish, if I
would exchange the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of my <HI>Mi∣stress's Soul,</HI> for
the most unbounded Pro∣perty, in her <HI>angelick Body.</HI> The Blessing
is <HI>fullest,</HI> I confess, when <HI>both</HI> these go
<HI>together:</HI> But the <HI>First,</HI> without the <HI>Last,</HI> can
give me <HI>Tenderness, Endearment,</HI> and the Delight of sweet
<HI>Reflection</HI>; whereas the <HI>Last,</HI> without the <HI>First,</HI>
would (in spite of all its Transports) carry with it an un∣satisfying,
and reluctant, <HI>Void</HI> of <HI>Thought,</HI> which would rob it, of its
<HI>finest</HI> Relish: For who would <HI>dare</HI> to <HI>think,</HI> at
all, when (if he thinks) he must be sensible, that he is receiving, from
an <HI>unconsenting Heart,</HI> the last, and dearest,
<HI>Obligation,</HI> which can spring from <HI>Love,</HI> and
<HI>Gratitude?</HI></P>
<P> THE <HI>Cold,</HI> and <HI>Grave,</HI> perhaps, may think, That
there is <HI>Levity</HI> in <HI>Loving,</HI> to such sweet Excess, as I
do: I, too, once, thought, as they think!—But Time, and the remember'd
Converse of a Wo∣man, <HI>softer,</HI> than the <HI>First Idea's</HI> of
her <PB N="418" REF="419"/> Sex's Innocence! and <HI>wiser,</HI> and more
<HI>solid,</HI> than their <HI>last Reflections,</HI> when they
<HI>leave</HI> a World that flatter'd them! have taught me, that there is no
Joy on Earth, so <HI>real,</HI> and so <HI>lasting,</HI> as the Union of
a Soul, so charm'd, as mine is, with the Soul, that has so charm'd
it!—<HI>Absence,</HI> Mr. PLAIN DEALER, and a Thousand Obstacles, I
dare not name, have interposed their cruel Influence: And I have, almost,
Cause to <HI>fear,</HI> my Tenderness, and Constancy, are
<HI>doubted,</HI> even by the lovely <HI>Object</HI> of them: And, yet, I never
pass a Moment, which takes not its <HI>Pain,</HI> or <HI>Pleasure,</HI>
chiefly, from the Part, <HI>Her</HI> ever-present Image bears, in the
Occasion. The Memory of <HI>Her</HI> dear Interest in me, gives
<HI>Spirit</HI> to my <HI>Hope, Mitigation</HI> to my <HI>Sorrow,</HI> and
<HI>Moderation</HI> to my <HI>Anger.</HI> If I <HI>fear,</HI> it is <HI>for
Her:</HI> And, if I <HI>wish,</HI> it is to <HI>make her
happy.</HI>—She <HI>alleviates</HI> all my <HI>Cares</HI>; and, yet,
she <HI>quickens,</HI> and <HI>increases</HI> them! She is my
<HI>Business,</HI> when I have <HI>Leisure,</HI> and my
<HI>Leisure,</HI> when I am in the midst of <HI>Business.</HI> She is
the <HI>Paradox,</HI> and <HI>Riddle,</HI> of my Life! I have the Mis∣fortune
to live, <HI>absent</HI> from her, yet is she never <HI>out of my
Company!</HI> I am not—must not—cannot be <HI>Her's</HI>; and
yet, <HI>am only Her's,</HI> for Ever!</P>
<P> I REMEMBER, when, I had the Blessing of seeing her
oft'ner, I once painted my Soul's full Meaning, in the following Copy of
Verses to her, or something, not much <PB N="419" REF="420"/> unlike
them.—Be so good, as to <HI>insert</HI> them; she, sometimes,
sees your Paper, and they may awaken the Remembrance of a Passion, she,
perhaps, <HI>relaxes from.</HI>—I hope, Her Soul does Justice to the
Impres∣sion which <HI>mine</HI> glows with: But, let Her Thoughts of
<HI>Me,</HI> be <HI>kind,</HI> or <HI>less partial,</HI> than they <HI>have
been,</HI> I must never expect the Power, which, I am sure, I shall never
<HI>wish for,</HI> of redeeming myself from that sweet Captivity, in
which Her Image holds the Heart of,</P>

<P>DESIGNING to be grave to Day, on the sober Subject of
RESOLUTION, I will bribe my Reader's Attention, to a Discourse, less
<HI>gay,</HI> than <HI>useful,</HI> by telling them a short <HI>Story,</HI>
in the very Front of my Paper.</P>
<Q> 
<P> <HI>SALADIN,</HI> the <HI>Soldan</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> tho' he
had Dominions enough, of his own, was always ready, when Occasion offered, to
<HI>make free</HI> with other People's.—At his Return without Success,
from the Siege of <HI>Mosoul,</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> he seized into his
Hands the whole Lordship of <HI>Emessa,</HI> in Prejudice to the Right of
<HI>Nasir Eddin,</HI> the young Prince, who clai∣med it. And <HI>this</HI> he
did, upon Pretence, That the late <HI>Father</HI> of the Youth had
<HI>for∣feited,</HI> by giving Countenance to Consedera∣cies against the
<HI>Soldan</HI>'s Interest.</P> 
<P> <HI>SALADIN,</HI> however, ordered, That proper Care should be
taken, of the injur'd Prince's Education: and being desirous to ob∣serve, 
<PB N="424" REF="425"/> what Progress he made in his Studies, he was brought,
one Day, before the <HI>Soldan</HI>; who asked him, with much Gravity, <HI>In
what Part of the Alcoran he was Reading?</HI>—I am come, reply'd the
young Prince (to the <HI>Surprize of all,</HI> who were near him) to that
Verse, which informs me, That <HI>He</HI> who <HI>de∣vours</HI> the
<HI>Estates</HI> of ORPHANS, is not a <HI>King,</HI> but a
<HI>Tyrant.</HI></P> 
<P> THE <HI>Soldan</HI> was much startled at the Turn, and Spirit,
of his <HI>Repartee</HI>; but, after some Pause, and Recollection, return'd
the Youth this generous Answer.—He, who <HI>speaks,</HI> with such
<HI>Resolution,</HI> would <HI>act</HI> with so much <HI>Courage,</HI> that
I <HI>restore</HI> you to your Father's Possessions, lest I
should be thought to stand in <HI>Fear</HI> of a Virtue, which I only
<HI>reverence.</HI></P></Q>
<P>SUCH an Influence has <HI>Firmness,</HI> even in <HI>Words,</HI>
and <HI>Appearance!</HI> But, when reduced into <HI>Practice,</HI> it is
productive of <HI>innumerable Benefits:</HI> So that, were I to be asked by a
Man of Sense, <HI>Which would be his shortest Road, to Felicity</HI>; My
Answer should be, The Path, which leads thro' <HI>Constancy</HI> and
<HI>Resolution:</HI> No other <HI>Road,</HI> but this! and no other
<HI>Guide,</HI> than <HI>Conscience,</HI> can carry him <HI>through</HI> his
Journey, and bring him <HI>safe</HI> to the <HI>End</HI> he aims at.</P>
<P>RESOLUTION in <HI>Life,</HI> is like <HI>Action</HI> in
<HI>Orato∣ry</HI>; as <HI>Demosthenes</HI> described it: It is the
<HI>First, Second,</HI> and <HI>Third</HI> Thing necessary. The Soul is
endowed with Three powerful Faculties; <PB N="425" REF="426"/> the
<HI>Understanding,</HI> the <HI>Memory,</HI> and the <HI>Will</HI>; but, with
regard to <HI>moral Life,</HI> they all Three lie <HI>dead,</HI> without the
Help of <HI>Resolu∣tion.</HI> Resolution is their <HI>Parent,</HI> their
<HI>Mid∣wife,</HI> and their <HI>Nurse.</HI> It first impregnates them with
<HI>Activity</HI>; then <HI>delivers</HI> them in their <HI>Labours</HI>; and
<HI>nourishes</HI> the Effects of those Labours with
<HI>Perseverance.</HI> What im∣ports it, to <HI>know</HI> either the
<HI>Good</HI> or the <HI>Pro∣per,</HI> if we <HI>forget</HI> or
<HI>over-look</HI> that Know∣ledge? Or, to what End do we <HI>remember,</HI>
what is Great, and Heroick in others, if <HI>Re∣solution</HI> does not
conform our Will to co-ope∣rate with our Understanding!</P>
<P>RESOLUTION therefore is the spiritual Uni∣on of the Mind's
best Faculties: and may, not improperly, be called the <HI>Soul</HI> of the
very <HI>Soul</HI> itself.—It exercises the Understanding into
<HI>Meditation</HI>; Meditation gives Life to Memory; and reduces <HI>Good
Will</HI> into Habit; and Habitual Good Will inspires the Memo∣ry and
Understanding to break beautifully forth, into a Series of <HI>good
Actions.</HI></P>
<P>FOR this Reason I have often reflected, that we stand more in
Need of being <HI>remind∣ed,</HI> than of being <HI>taught</HI>; and that,
whoever would lead Men to be <HI>good,</HI> that is, to be <HI>happy</HI>;
should rather inspire them with Reso∣lution to <HI>do</HI> what they know
to be right, than to learn, <HI>what it is</HI> to do rightly. Mo∣ral Arguments
should be chiefly applied to the <HI>Memory,</HI> and are <HI>Incentives</HI>
to the <HI>Will,</HI> rather than <HI>Aids</HI> to the
<HI>Understanding.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="427"/>THIS is evident, methinks, from the
fol∣lowing Considerations; <HI>Wisdom,</HI> as it regards practical Life,
is no more than a Faculty of discerning what is Good, from what is Evil; what
is to be embraced, and what rejected.—Now if the wisest Man upon
Earth, by the Dint only of <HI>Resolution,</HI> could bring himself to
<HI>practise,</HI> what a Man of the most mode∣rate Faculties
<HI>comprehends</HI> and <HI>distinguishes,</HI> he would indeed, be a
<HI>wise Man,</HI> according to the genuine Signification. But, as the World
goes, were we strictly to measure the Capacities, even of the
<HI>Wisest,</HI> by their <HI>Actions,</HI> we should be mortified into a
Ne∣cessity of considering this vast Globe, but as a Stage full of
<HI>busy Fools,</HI> with scarce a steady Purpose among them. And,
however the Philosophers may have declared a <HI>Vacuum</HI> an Absurdity
in <HI>Nature</HI>; we should, plainly, discover one, in <HI>Sense,</HI>
among the Agents of the intellectual World: We must therefore conclude, That
the Fault lies not in the <HI>Un∣derstanding,</HI> but the <HI>Will</HI>; nor
proceeds from Want of Knowledge, but Deficiency of Firm∣ness, and
Resolution. Mr. DRYDEN, speak∣ing of Men in their <HI>thinking</HI> and
<HI>contempla∣tive</HI> Faculty, says somewhere, to the Praise of the
<HI>meanest</HI> Writers, That he never read any Argument so
<HI>indifferently</HI> handled, out of which a <HI>wise</HI> Man might not
gather some∣thing that was <HI>valuable:</HI> And <HI>Cardinal</HI> RICHLIEU,
has observ'd, concerning <HI>active</HI> and <HI>political</HI> Life, That he
knew many, to <PB N="427" REF="428"/> whom the Direction of great
<HI>Kingdoms</HI> might be happily committed in the <HI>Morning,</HI> whom,
yet, in the <HI>Afternoon,</HI> he would scarce trust with the
<HI>Administration</HI> of his <HI>Hen-roost.</HI></P>
<P>A LITTLE common Thief knows he <HI>should not</HI> commit
Injustice; and understands well enough, when he commits it—but,
wan∣ting <HI>Resolution</HI> to be <HI>publickly needy,</HI> rather than
<HI>privately dishonest,</HI> he deviates from the <HI>real</HI> Good; and
ventures upon the <HI>appearing.</HI>—How often has the <HI>Judge</HI>
acted the <HI>Felon</HI> upon the Bench, and robb'd before <HI>their</HI>
Faces, who <HI>accuse Robbers</HI> at his Tribunal! He <HI>dares commit</HI>
the very Crime which he is seated there, to condemn; But he wants
<HI>Resolution</HI> to de∣spise the Bribe, though he has not the Felon's
<HI>Necessity</HI> to plead in Excuse of it: The poor Thief in this
Case, as <HI>silly</HI> as he looks at the <HI>Bar,</HI> stands in Need
of no <HI>Instructor.</HI> But the Judge himself, as <HI>wise</HI> as he
appears, in his <HI>Furs,</HI> wants a <HI>Remembrancer</HI> at his El∣bow, to
put him in Mind of his Duty.</P>
<P><HI>COMMON Gamesters,</HI> know so well the Ignominy of giving
<HI>false Judgment,</HI> at a pub∣lick <HI>Hazard-Table,</HI> that they have
generally <HI>Resolution</HI> enough to resist very great secret
Temptations that Way; and have seldom been found guilty, though
<HI>Custom,</HI> and not <HI>Conscience,</HI> is the Motive of their
Forbear∣ance. But, how <HI>little History</HI> need we read, to know, That we
have had Dispensers of Equity, who have been in the utmost
<HI>Neces∣sity</HI> of Plain-dealing <HI>Monitors,</HI> not indeed to 
<PB N="428" REF="429"/> <HI>instruct</HI> them; but to put them in
<HI>Mind,</HI> that <HI>Equity was not Iniquity.</HI>—We <HI>all</HI> of
us <HI>know,</HI> but <HI>few,</HI> or <HI>none</HI> of us
<HI>think.</HI>—We distinguish not the Things that lie
<HI>before</HI> us, through the <HI>Mistiness</HI> of <HI>Avarice,</HI> or
any other intervening Passion. It cannot be said, that we are un∣able to
<HI>see:</HI> But that we <HI>see</HI> without
<HI>Discern∣ment.</HI>—The <HI>Understanding</HI> has <HI>Eyes,</HI>
but <HI>Ir∣resolution</HI> has <HI>jaundic'd</HI> them.</P>
<P>HOW does <HI>Ambition</HI> reduce and mislead those, whom we
call <HI>wise</HI> Men, into auk∣ward Condescensions, which make them
cheap in the very Eyes of the <HI>Vulgar?</HI> How often have we seen
<HI>Pride,</HI> and <HI>Insolence</HI> assume the Flexure of the
<HI>sneaking Candidate,</HI> in order to <HI>strut</HI> immediately after,
in the Abuse of intrusted <HI>Office?</HI> The <HI>Farce of</HI> DOCTOR
FAUSTUS has been represented as <HI>light,</HI> and <HI>ridiculous,</HI>
because, its <HI>Plot</HI> is <HI>no more,</HI> than that, while the
<HI>Conjurer</HI> enjoys his <HI>Wand,</HI> he enjoys his Wishes: <HI>That
Wand</HI> converts every Thing into the Accomplishment of his Purposes: But
no sooner is his <HI>Term,</HI> of holding that <HI>White Staff,
expired;</HI> than the <HI>Conjuration expires</HI> with it; and he is the
poorest, weak∣est, most despairing, and most abandon'd Wretch alive.
This, every Spectator sees <HI>through,</HI> and <HI>laughs</HI> at; and yet,
how happy might it have been for some other <HI>Wand-hol∣ders,</HI> of this
Kingdom, if that poor <HI>Farce</HI> had been acted before them, instead of
<HI>their</HI> duller <HI>State Interludes,</HI> in order to serve as a
useful <HI>Memorial,</HI> that they should not misuse 
<PB N="429" REF="430"/> <HI>those Wands</HI> like FAUSTUS; that is, play
Tricks, till their <HI>Time is out,</HI> and then be <HI>delivered up</HI> to
the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>AS <HI>little</HI> Men become <HI>great</HI> by
<HI>Resolution,</HI> and <HI>great Men</HI> degenerate into <HI>little</HI>
ones with∣out it; so <HI>Admonitions,</HI> to those Duties, which every
<HI>little Man</HI> knows, are <HI>necessary</HI> notwith∣standing, to
the <HI>Wisest</HI>; Of this ALEXANDER's Father, PHILIP, demonstrated
himself very sensible; That Prince's <HI>Servant, knew,</HI> no doubt, as
well as his <HI>Master,</HI> that a <HI>King</HI> was no more than a
<HI>Man:</HI> But PHILIP, mind∣ful, that high Fortune had often made <HI>light
Heads forget</HI> themselves, commanded this Ser∣vant to wake him every
Morning, by this well-known Lesson in his Ear;—<HI>Remem∣ber thou art
but a Man.</HI>—Now, many would be apt to imagine, that little Profit
could arise from such constant Repetition of this short and needless
Intimation: Yet Sir FRANCIS BACON, who <HI>knew</HI> well both the
<HI>great</HI> World and the <HI>little,</HI> has left us the following
<HI>Axiom</HI> concerning it: 
<Q REND="inline">"All (<HI>moni∣torial</HI>) Precepts concerning
<HI>Kings,</HI> are, in Effect, comprehended in these Two
<HI>Remem∣brances;—Remember thou art a Man;—Remember thou art</HI>
GOD<HI>'s Vicegerent.</HI> The <HI>one</HI> bridleth their <HI>Power,</HI> the
other their <HI>Will.</HI>"</Q>—In Truth, if ALEXANDER had affected to be
no more than he was, the Son of PHILIP, instead of aspiring to Divinity and
the Title of AMMON; he would have <HI>more</HI> than conquer'd the World; for
he would have conquered the very Conqueror of it.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="431"/>RESOLUTION then, is the only Means to make a
Man compleatly <HI>happy</HI>; and frequent <HI>Admonition</HI> serves to
keep <HI>Resolution</HI> alive. The <HI>Lowest</HI> can scarce stand in
Need of a mo∣ral <HI>Instruction</HI>; but the <HI>Highest</HI> may be
greatly indebted for <HI>Admonition</HI>; and consequently, all young Men,
who propose to make any Figure in publick Employments, should give Ear, to
a <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> who dares put them in Mind of their
Weakness.—A Man who has Firmness enough to <HI>see</HI> the
<HI>Worst</HI> of his own Soul, will soon have the Satisfaction to find the
Prospect much <HI>better'd.</HI> He will learn Patience in <HI>ill</HI>
Fortune, and Abstinence in <HI>good</HI>; He will be fortified with
<HI>Resolu∣tion,</HI> to be <HI>humble, just,</HI> and <HI>charitable,</HI>
amidst the strongest <HI>Inflations,</HI> and Indulgements of
<HI>Prosperity:</HI> and disdain to be found <HI>envious, dejected,</HI> or
<HI>revengeful,</HI> amidst the <HI>bitterest</HI> Resentments, and
Sollicitations of <HI>Calamity.</HI> Such a Man shall not only preserve an
inward Tranquility; but, whatever the Colour of his Fortune may be, he will owe
a Lustre to <HI>Himself,</HI> and cast it round him upon <HI>Others.</HI>
He will not only be <HI>followed,</HI> but <HI>beloved</HI> in his
<HI>Prosperity</HI>; and in his <HI>Adversity</HI> he will be
<HI>lamented.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>PLAIN-DEALER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> IT is with no small Expectation, that I observe you, in
some of your Papers, making Excursions into the Province of
<HI>Criticism:</HI> It is a Subject, not only <HI>Enter∣taining,</HI> but
<HI>Instructive:</HI> And there is no kind of Knowledge, in which those gay
Spirits, who are loudest, and most ready, in giving Judgment, are so
contemptibly and lamentably Deficient, as in the Art of <HI>Judg∣ing
rightly.</HI></P>
<P> TWO Improvements might be hop'd for, in the Taste of most
Readers, from a more general Propagation of the Knowledge of
<HI>distinguishing clearly:</HI> We should neither be ashamed to
praise the Merit of the Obscu∣rest <PB N="432" REF="433"/> rest of our
<HI>Cotemporaries</HI>; nor afraid to cen∣sure the Errors of the most
Popular among <HI>ancient</HI> Writers.</P>
<P> <HI>HOMER</HI>'s famous Catalogue, of <HI>Gre∣cian</HI> Ships,
and their Commanders, would, then, I am apt to believe, cease to pass for
one of his Sublimest, and most Poetical Beauties. Its Geographieal
Exactness would no longer be pleaded as a Ballance, against the Dryness,
and Tediousness, of its Histo∣rical Enumeration: Since it is no Part of a
<HI>Poet's</HI> Business, to teach the Situation, Bounds, and Quality, of
Countries. Little, occasional Descriptions of that kind, 'tis true, may
sometimes, be necessary; and, being artfully introduced, and handled,
might not only <HI>diversify</HI> a Poem; but also render it
<HI>delightful:</HI> Without which last Quality, the whole Labour is lost.
And nothing, certainly, can <HI>delight,</HI> that is <HI>tire∣som,</HI> and
<HI>heavy.</HI></P>
<P> BUT the Bigotry of a Succession of un∣poetical
<HI>Commentators,</HI> Men of Learning, without Genius; has heap'd upon this
Ca∣talogue, such profuse and ill-judg'd <HI>Enco∣mium,</HI> that the whole
Herd of Imitators, from the <HI>Tasso</HI>'s of <HI>Italy,</HI> down to the
<HI>Black∣more</HI>'s of <HI>Britain,</HI> have lengthen'd out their hostile
<HI>Muster-Rolls,</HI> to the Terror and Pro∣vocation, even of the most
patient of their gentle Readers. And some of these have been fortunate
enough to meet with Ap∣plause, more extravagant, even than <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>'s:
<PB N="433" REF="434"/> For they have been compar'd with and <HI>preferr'd</HI>
to <HI>Homer</HI>'s. Witness <HI>Ben Johnson</HI>'s commendatory
<HI>Vision,</HI> printed be∣fore the old Edition of DRAYTON<HI>'s</HI> Battle
of <HI>Agincourt.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L><HI>There,</HI> Thou art <HI>Homer,</HI>—Pray thee
<HI>use</HI> the Style</L> 
<L>Thou hast <HI>deserv'd;</HI> and let me read, the
while,</L> 
<L>Thy <HI>CATALOUE of SHIPS, cxceeding his!</HI></L></Q>
<P> THE Catalogue, here meant, is of those Ships, which
transported the <HI>English</HI> For∣ces, in our <HI>Henry the Fifth's</HI>
first Attempt upon <HI>France.</HI>—I will entertain the Reader with
this (so highly applauded) Cata∣logue; because it may deserve to stand,
as a <HI>Proof,</HI> what poor Products we are to ex∣pect, from a servile and
implicite Imitation.</P>
<Q>

<L>And, first, Seven Ships, from <HI>Rochester,</HI> are
sent,</L>
<L>The <HI>Bonadventure, George,</HI> and the
<HI>Expence;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Antilope, Henry, Elephant, Defence:</HI></L>
<L>Bottoms, as good, as ever <HI>spread</HI> a
<HI>Clue!</HI></L>
<L>All having Charge, their Voyge having been,</L>
<L>Before <HI>Southampton,</HI> to take Soldiers in.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Twelve Merchant Ships, of mighty Burthen all,</L>
<L>New, off the Stocks, that had been rigg'd for
<HI>Stoad,</HI></L>
<L>Riding in <HI>Thames,</HI> by <HI>Limehouse,</HI> and
<HI>Black-wall,</HI></L>
<L>That ready were, their Merchandize to load.</L>
<L>Eight goodly Ships from <HI>Bristol,</HI> ready made,</L>
<L>With <HI>Spanish Wine,</HI> which they for Ballast
lade;</L>
<L>And, as these Eight the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea do stem,</L>
<L>Five more, from <HI>Padstow,</HI> came along with
them.</L>
<L> <PB N="434" REF="435"/>From <HI>Plymouth</HI> next, came in
the <HI>Blazing-Star,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Fiery Dragon,</HI> to take in their Fraught,</L>
<L>With other Four, especial Men of War,</L>
<L>That in the Bay of <HI>Portugal</HI> had fought:</L>
<L>The <HI>Hare</HI> of <HI>Loo,</HI> a right good Ship, well
known,</L>
<L>That twice, the Year before, the Streights had past;</L>
<L>Two wealthy <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchants did her own,</L>
<L>Who, then, but newly had repair'd her waste:</L>
<L>And, from <HI>Mount's-Bay,</HI> Six more, that still in
Sight.</L>
<L>Waited with her before the <HI>Isle of Wight.</HI></L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Nine Ships, for the Nobility, there went</L>
<L>Of able Men, the Enterprize to aid;</L>
<L><HI>Northumberland,</HI> and <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> in
sent</L>
<L>Fourscore at Arms apiece, and themselves laid</L>
<L>At Sixscore Archers each; as <HI>Suffolk</HI> shows</L>
<L>Twenty tall Men at Arms, and Forty Bows.</L>

<L><HI>Darcy,</HI> and <HI>Camois,</HI> zealous for the

<L><HI>Seymour,</HI> and <HI>St. John,</HI> for the
Business close,</L>
<L>Each Twenty Horse, and Forty Foot do bring,</L>
<L>More, to Nine hundred, 'mounting in the Gross,</L>
<L>In those Nine Ships; and fitly them bestow'd,</L>
<L>With which the other fall into the Road.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>From <HI>Holland, Zealand,</HI> and from <HI>Flanders,</HI>
won</L>
<L>By weekly Pay, Threescore Twelve Bottoms came,</L>
<L>From Fifty upward, to Five Hundred Tun,</L>
<L>For every Ʋse, a Mariner could name:</L>
<L>Their glitt'ring Flags, against the radiant Sun,</L>
<L>Show'd, as if all the Sea had been on Flame;</L>
<L>Then Skiffs, Crays, Scallops, and the like, why these,</L>
<L>From every small Creek, cover'd all the Seas.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="435" REF="436"/> THIS, though a bald, and unlovely
Imi∣tation of <HI>Homer,</HI> is better I think, in one Sense, than the
Original, by so much, as it is <HI>shorter</HI>; for no Man of Reason
will be perswaded to believe, that in a Poem of this kind, such a tedious,
and dry List of a Fleet, though it preserves a particular Piece of
Antiquity (which is the Commentators weak Defence for <HI>Homer</HI>) can
stand agree∣ably in the Place of Invention, Spirit, Fan∣cy, and the Energy of
Poetry.</P>
<P> SUCH a barren, and distinct Enumeration gives a wearisom
Satiety to the Mind, and drags too hard on the Attention. When I read, for so
many Leaves together, not what Persons <HI>do,</HI> but who they
<HI>are,</HI> and whence they <HI>came</HI>; without any of that enlivening
Variety of Circumstance, or De∣scription, which should relieve the
Imagi∣nation, it puts me in Mind of our Ancestors simple <HI>Epitaphs</HI>:
Honest People! who thought it Merit enough to have lived, married, and got
Children, without load∣ing their Tomb-stones with the Weight of their
<HI>Actions!</HI></P>

<L>Of <HI>Wiliam Wilson, Joan</HI> his Wife,</L> 
<L>And <HI>Alice,</HI> their Daughter dear,</L>

<P> AMONG all these copious Particularities, there is nothing,
that deserv'd the telling, if we except the great Rarity, that comes in the
Rear; A Man made a <HI>Lord</HI> for his <HI>Virtue!</HI> That, indeed must
be own'd to have been a Wonder worth recording: It was consider'd too, it
seems, as an Accident so unusual, that the good Man appears, by the
last Verse, to have been ashamed of his Singularity; and rather chose
to stick fast to his old knightly Title of Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> than 
<PB N="437" REF="438"/> be pointed at, as he passed the Streets, for a kind
of Miracle. But here follows some∣thing, which no Poet's List among them
all, can compare with, for Exactness.</P>
<Q>

<L>Example by <HI>John, Mary,</HI> and <HI>Oliver Stile;</HI></L>

<L>Who, under this Stone, <HI>lieth</HI> buried in the

<HI>1585,</HI> his Course being then run.</L></Q>
<P> NOW, Sir, bating, as is necessary, for the Difference
between the <HI>Verses,</HI> a Man is apt to conclude, That a Poet, too
prolix in the Lists, I have been speaking of, has as little to say for
the Actions of the greatest Part of his Captains, as these very exact
<HI>Epi∣taphs,</HI> for the <HI>Oliver</HI>'s, <HI>Alice</HI>'s,

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Oh Dear! Mr. <HI>PLAIN DEALER,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> MANY a Lady has been charm'd into a Passion for her future
Lover, upon Sight only of his <HI>Picture:</HI> But my Fate is the very
Reverse of This; For, be∣fore I saw the <HI>Picture</HI> of my
<HI>Florello,</HI> I was almost in Love with the <HI>Original:</HI> Where∣as,
now, I am fallen absolutely in Love with the Picture, and can scarce bear
the Sight of That odious Lover of mine, who <HI>sat</HI> for it.</P>
<P> THE Picture, you must know, is a Kind of Paradox: For it is
drawn but in <HI>Black,</HI> and <HI>White</HI>; and yet glows, with the
live∣liest Force; and most natural Mixture of strong <HI>Colouring!</HI>
It is <HI>One,</HI> of a valuable <HI>Collection,</HI> which was expos'd to
Publick Sale last Week; under Title of <HI>The</HI> UNIVERSAL 
<PB N="439" REF="440"/> PASSION, <HI>Part</HI> II.—Wou'd to Heaven I knew
the Painter! A Hand, so exquisite at <HI>Touching,</HI> should <HI>take
me,</HI> as often as I cou'd possibly sit to him. Nay, I wou'd sooner
be drawn by <HI>Him,</HI> than by <HI>Apelles,</HI> or <HI>Ti∣tian,</HI> or
<HI>Lilly,</HI> or <HI>Vandike</HI>; or by any Pen∣cil ancient, or modern;
<HI>except that only,</HI> to which we owe so many envy-raising Pic∣tures
of my Friend Mrs. <HI>Arabella Farmor.</HI></P>
<P> NOT but there is infinite Difference, be∣tween the Two Pieces;
and the <HI>Lines,</HI> in∣deed, are strikingly distinguish'd, in
both:—In the <HI>Lady</HI>'s, They are <HI>sweet, soft,
de∣licate!</HI> In my <HI>Florello</HI>'s, They are <HI>strong, bold,
glaring! Florello</HI>'s very <HI>Life</HI> is not half so <HI>lively,</HI>
as this fine Painter's <HI>speaking Representation</HI> of it.—See!
the <HI>Fi∣gure,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit!</HI> the <HI>Grace!</HI> and
<HI>Pas∣sion,</HI> of the Picture!</P>

<SALUTE>Mr. <HI>PLAIN-DEALER,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> AS You are a Gentleman of Penetrati∣on, and capable of rendring
every Thing that is offer'd to You in a brighter Capacity than I am, (which
occurr'd to me, upon reading your Paper of <HI>Friday, March</HI> the 12th, in
Relation to PUGG<HI>'s Complaint,</HI> against that <HI>Feathery Fool,</HI>
called a PARROT, in a House that is just over against him) I I desire,
that in your next, you would only give Caution to a certain Lady, whose
Lodgings are opposite to mine, That she does not indulge PUGG, as I have
seen her, in all that provoking and unmerited Free∣dom, of <HI>pawing</HI>
her upon the <HI>Mouth</HI> and <HI>Bosom.</HI> Flesh, and Blood, Mr. PLAIN
DEALER, is not able to bear it; and if we must not cast the <HI>Food</HI>
of <HI>Man</HI> to <HI>Dogs,</HI> I am sure it is much less lawful to
bestow His Right upon an <HI>ugly Monkey.</HI>—In short, I am out of
all manner of <HI>Patience</HI>; and if this Lady will not be so kind as to
keep my Rival out of my Sight, I must be forc'd to <HI>brick up my
Windows,</HI> or remove to a <HI>new Lodging:</HI> For I wou'd not, methinks,
be so unreasonable, as to quarrel with PUGG <HI>Himself</HI> about it:
Since, He looks (to con∣fess the Truth) as if He was <HI>born</HI> to be the
<HI>Lady's Favourite.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> YOU will much oblige one of your constant Readers, and very
great Ad∣mirers; if you will but answer me this Quere, <HI>viz.</HI> In your
Excellent PLAIN DEALER, of <HI>August</HI> the 24th, 1724, N<SUP>o</SUP> 45, treating
of <HI>Love,</HI> wherein is contain'd, part of that lovely POEM on the same
Subject, I find these Lines; 
<Q> 
<L>Absent from <HI>Her,</HI> in whom alone we
<HI>live,</HI></L> 
<L>Life grows a <HI>Bankrupt,</HI> and no <HI>Bliss</HI> can

<P> NOW all the Question is, Whether that is not a Mistake of

<P>TO a <HI>Lover,</HI> who retires to <HI>Solitude,</HI> for a

and the Pressure of them is <HI>Importunately</HI> trouble∣some; and this
was doubtless the Sense, in which the Author of that Poem made use of the
Word <HI>Importunate.—Imperti∣nent</HI> had been less applicable, as
well as less elegant; because it is the <HI>Duty</HI> of a

<P> I HAVE perceived, quite through the Course of your Papers,
that your Ten∣dency, is not only to <HI>Delight</HI> your Read∣ers; but to
<HI>Inform,</HI> and <HI>Refine</HI> them. Up∣on this Consideration, I must
persuade my∣self, you will set the following Subject in the strongest
Light; which, the more ef∣fectually to recommend it to you, I assure you it
is not fictitious, but real Matter of Fact.—There is a certain Widow, who
has two Sons, and two Daughters, the for∣mer of which, are arrived to the
State, which writes them <HI>Men,</HI> both brought up to creditable
Employments; but neither of them capable of proceeding in their Business,
without her Assistance; which, tho' very able to give, she
<HI>refuses</HI> them.</P>
<P> YOU will be more than a little surprized, when I tell you,
there is a Person, beyond Description, rustical, and unlovely, who 
<PB N="444" REF="445"/> makes his aukward Addresses to the <HI>Wealth</HI>
of this Widow: And that this is the <HI>Con∣sideration</HI> which she
prefers to the Welfare of her Children, who have urg'd her, on their Knees, to
regard, not only <HI>Their Good,</HI> but what the World will say of
<HI>herself.</HI>—Deaf to all their Intercessions, she
continu∣ally repulses them, and is unalterably de∣termined, on her
<HI>own</HI> and <HI>their</HI> Ruin.</P>
<P> NOW, I would beg of you, to tell me, What Motive can induce her
to this? And to account for it in a <HI>Physical</HI> Manner? Should not the
moving Wants and Depen∣dance of her own Children, prevail more upon her
<HI>Nature,</HI> than the interested Ad∣dresses of a <HI>Stranger</HI>?
For I am afraid, there are no Incentives to <HI>Love,</HI> on either Side, and
I am loth to give it its <HI>other Name.</HI> If, Sir, you insert this as
soon as you can in your Paper, you may do a real Good, and at the same Time
you will oblige one of your constanr Readers.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> THE astonishing Structure, the im∣mense, but beautiful,
Extent, and Order of <HI>Creation,</HI> demand, not the <HI>Notice</HI> only,
but, the <HI>Veneration</HI> of every reaso∣nable Being. No less than
<HI>infinite Wisdom</HI> could conceive the Plan; nor less than
<HI>Al∣mighty Power</HI> erect the Fabrick! Our Sight is struck with
Amazement, when we look but upon a stately Building, the mere Ef∣fect of
Human Invention; And, yet, (to the Shame of our Stupidity be it spoken) we
can consider the <HI>Earth,</HI> we live on, with
<HI>Indifference</HI>;—we can walk under the <HI>Lamps</HI> of
<HI>Heaven,</HI> without being inlightened by the smallest Glimmering of
Divine Re∣flection! nor (to many) do they argue any <PB N="447" REF="448"/>
thing greater than <HI>Chance,</HI> which, in other Words, is
<HI>Nothing.</HI></P>
<P> YET, certainly, no Knowledge can be so <HI>delightful,</HI>
to the Soul, as <HI>This,</HI> which is, at the same Time, the
<HI>noblest,</HI> and most <HI>useful,</HI> that can busy us, in our
short Pil∣grimage through the <HI>Body.</HI> Nay, The ex∣cellent Mr.
<HI>Ray</HI> has very pleasingly imagi∣ned, that it may be Part of our
Business and Employment, to all Eternity, to dis∣cover still, deeper
and deeper, into the un∣fathomable Works of God; and contem∣plate the Glory of
his Wisdom, Power, and Goodness.</P>
<P> I AM sensible, You concur with me, that the <HI>Honour</HI>
due to <HI>God,</HI> should excite the noblest of our Thoughts, and
Actions; be∣cause You have endeavour'd to make our Lives, in their good
Purposes, and their Lustre, resemble the Coelestial Bodies; and
<HI>move,</HI> for their <HI>own,</HI> and for <HI>other's</HI> Benefit. And
since you have not refused to exert your Genius toward refining, inlarging,
and advancing, our Ideas of Divine Greatness: So, doubtless, you will
oblige your Rea∣ders, in the Sequel of this Letter, with a Trace of
Reflections, for which we are in∣debted to the Author of that excellent
Dis∣course, <HI>The Religion of Nature Delineated.</HI></P>

<Q><PB N="448" REF="449"/> 
<P> WHAT a vast Field for Contempla∣tion is opened in those
Regions of <HI>Matter,</HI> about us, in which there is not the least
Particle, but carries with it an Argument of God's Existence; not the
smallest Trifle but shews it; nor the slight∣est Motion produced, the
softest Whisper of the Air, but tells it.—The Frame and
Constitution of the World, the asto∣nishing Magnificence of it, the
various Kinds of Beings, and the Constancy ob∣served in the Productions of
Things, and the Uses for which they are produc'd, do all shew, that there
is some <HI>Almighty De∣signer</HI> at the Top of all these Things: Such
<HI>Marks</HI> they <HI>bear</HI> of his Power, and Wis∣dom.</P> 
<P> IN order to prove, to any Doubter, the the Grandeur of this
Fabrick, we need only bid him consider the <HI>Sun,</HI> with that
insupportable Glory that surrounds it: The vast Distance, Magnitude,
and Heat of it! The Planets periodically moving in their several Orbits,
about it, with all their <HI>Re∣gular Variety</HI> of Aspects, guarded,
some of them, by <HI>secondary Planets,</HI> and, as it were,
<HI>emulating</HI> the State of the <HI>Sun</HI>; and, pro∣bably, all These,
possess'd by distinct and proper <HI>Inhabitants!</HI>—Let him
think of those surprizing Visits the <HI>Comets</HI> make us; the large
Trains of uncommon Splendor, which attend them; the <HI>far Country</HI> they 
<PB N="445" REF="450"/> come from, and the Curiosity and Horror they excite,
not only among <HI>us,</HI> but in the Inhabitants of the Worlds about us; who
also may be <HI>up,</HI> as we are, to see the <HI>Entry,</HI> and
<HI>Progress,</HI> of these new Ministers of the Almighty:—Let him
direct his Eye and Contemplation, through those azure Regi∣ons above him, up
to the <HI>fixed Stars,</HI> that radiant, and numberless <HI>Host</HI> of
<HI>Heaven</HI>; and reflect but, how unlikely it is, that they should be
placed there, only to adorn, and bespangle, our Canopy! He will, then,
instruct himself, that they are so many <HI>other</HI> SUNS, with their
several Regions, and and dependant Planets, about them! He will further
discern, by the Help of Glasses, still more and more of these
<HI>fixed Lights,</HI> and exalt himself to an Apprehension of their
unaccountable Numbers, and of the Immensity of those Spaces, that lie
re∣tired beyond, not our <HI>Ken</HI> only, but even our
<HI>Imagination.</HI></P>

<P> WE need only consider these Things, which are now known
almost to every Body; and, by them, we shall be taught, that a Structure,
so infinite, must be the Work of an infinite Architect.—But, if we
could take a particular View of all that astonishing Compass, which we
have thus hastily run over, how would <HI>Wonders mul∣tiply</HI> upon us?
Every Part of every World, is, as it were, made up of <HI>other</HI> Worlds. If
we examine <HI>This our Earth,</HI> what Scope is here for
Admiration?—What Varie∣ty of Mountains, Hills, Valleys, Plains, Rivers,
Seas, Trees, Plants! What num∣berless Tribes of different Animals is it
stock'd with! How unwearied are the In∣ventions, and Works of <HI>one</HI> of
these; which is MAN! And yet, when they are <PB N="447" REF="454"/> all
survey'd, as nicely as they can be, whether by our unassisted Senses,
or the Help of <HI>Telescopical</HI> Glasses; the Assistance of
<HI>Microscopes,</HI> in the <HI>smallest</HI> Parts of <HI>Mat∣ter,</HI>
will go on to discover as many new Wonders, as those which have already
been made known to us. New Kingdoms of Animals; new Architecture, and
Cu∣riosity of Workmanship, and Oeconomy. So that as, <HI>before,</HI> our
Conception fainted, in those boundless Journeys we were obliged to take
through the expansive Vastness of the Universe; here, on the other
Hand, we tire ourselves with fruit∣less Researches into the Principles
and con∣stituent Parts of it. Both the <HI>Beginnings</HI> and the
<HI>End</HI> of Things, the <HI>Least</HI> and the <HI>Greatest,</HI> all
conspire to perplex us: And which every way we prosecute our In∣quiries, we
still fall in with fresh Subjects of Amazement, and fresh Reasons to
be∣lieve, that there are more and more be∣hind, that will for ever escape our
eagerest and most successful Penetration. We have
<HI>Philosophy,</HI> indeed, but, the Misfortune is, it dwells but in the
<HI>Surface</HI> of Nature.—</P> 
<P> IT appears, then, plainly enough, in the Parts and Model of the
World, that there is a <HI>Contrivance,</HI> and a Respect to certain
<HI>Reasons,</HI> and <HI>Ends.</HI> Why else is the Sun posited near the
Middle of our <HI>System</HI>; but for the more convenient dis∣pensing of
his Influence to the Planets, <PB N="448" REF="455"/> moving about him? Why
else does the Plan of the Earth's <HI>Aequator,</HI> intersect that of her
<HI>Orbit,</HI> and make a proper <HI>Angle</HI> with it, but in order to
diversify the Year, and create a useful <HI>Variety</HI> of
<HI>Seasons.</HI> Many other Things of this kind, tho' a thousand Times
repeated, will be always delightful Observations to good Men and true
Scholars: None of whom can observe those Vapours which ascend from the
Sea, to meet in <HI>Clouds</HI> above, and fall back again, after
<HI>Condensation,</HI> without understanding the Purpose of this
providential <HI>Distillation</HI> to be a Division of the Water from its
grosser <HI>Salts,</HI> that, by Rains, and Dews, it may return upon and
supply the Fountains, and refreshing Rivers, nourishing the Vegetables by
Show∣ers, which therefore descend not in Cata∣racts, but kindly Drops, as
from a Water∣pot, upon a Garden!</P> 
<P> WHO can view the Structure of a <HI>Plant</HI> or an
<HI>Animal</HI>; the indefinite Number of their <HI>Fibres,</HI> and fine
<HI>Vessels,</HI> their Depen∣dance upon <HI>larger,</HI> and the several
Mem∣bers upon <HI>them,</HI> and the apt Disposition of all these; the
Provision that is made for Reception and Distribution of Nourish∣ment;
the Effect of this Nourishment, in Extension of the Vessels,
stretching the <HI>Ve∣getable,</HI> or <HI>Animal,</HI> gradually, to its
full and determinate Growth; maintaining the Motion of the several
<HI>Fluids,</HI> repairing the <PB N="449" REF="456"/> Decays of the Body; and
comforting and preserving Life? Who can take Notice of the various
<HI>Faculties</HI> of Animals, their Arts of saving, and providing for
themselves, or the Means by which they are provided for; the Uses of
<HI>Plants</HI> to Animals, and of some Animals to <HI>others,</HI> and of
the Generality of them to <HI>Mankind</HI>; the Propagation of the several
Species out of their <HI>proper</HI> Seeds (without Confusion!) the strong
Inclinations implanted for that Purpose; and the Ten∣derness, even of the
Fiercest to their <HI>Young:</HI> Who, I say, can view all this, and not
con∣fess a <HI>Design,</HI> and an <HI>omnipotent Designer?</HI> The
meanest Insect, which scarce appears, at all, to our naked Eye, will,
when viewed through a Microscope, present a Prospect, a Thousand Times
more curious, and surprizing, than the finest Piece of
<HI>Mechanism,</HI> that ever was made by <HI>Man!</HI> For my own Part, as I
cannot but ac∣knowledge, that I am <HI>fearfully,</HI> and <HI>won∣derfully
formed;</HI> I likewise believe, as firmly, that some superintendent Hand
hath <HI>conducted</HI> and <HI>protected me,</HI> from my Birth, to this
present Moment; or that, in the Words of the most Sacred of all
<HI>Wri∣tings.—There is a God, in whom I live, move, and have my
Being.</HI></P> 
<P> WHO, then, that judges of this God, by his <HI>Works</HI> and
his <HI>Mercy,</HI> will be afraid of that <HI>Death,</HI> which must bring
us one Stage <HI>nearer</HI> him? Nay, who knows, but <PB N="450" REF="457"/>
that what we <HI>call</HI> DEATH, may be our real, and proper, LIFE, and this,
which we think our <HI>Life,</HI> a kind of <HI>dark,</HI> and <HI>dreaming,
Interval,</HI> which Death only comes to <HI>awaken,</HI> and <HI>redeem</HI>
us from? For my Part, I look forward on the Hour of my
<HI>Dissolution,</HI> with the Hope, and Ex∣pectation, of escaping
<HI>Mariners,</HI> who ha∣ving been sinking all Night long, in a
Rudderless, and Foundring Vessel, disco∣ver, with the Dawn of the
Morning, the opening Coast of some <HI>lovely,</HI> though
<HI>un∣known</HI> Country! I support <HI>Life,</HI> as my <HI>Duty,</HI>
rather than enjoy it, as my <HI>Wish:</HI> And will borrow another
<HI>Stanza,</HI> from the same Poem, whence I took that above to express
the Sentiments I feel in my self, after such a Trace of serious
Reflections, as those which compose this Paper.</P> </Q>
<Q> 
<L>But murmur not, proud Heart! if here delay'd,</L> 
<L>A wandring Pilgrim, through this Life's cold Shade,</L> 
<L>I must not <HI>yet,</HI> in Heaven's wide Search rejoyce:</L>

<P>I AM, though a great Lover of <HI>Trade,</HI> a declar'd Enemy to
the Company of <HI>Vintners</HI>; and profess, That my Indignation daily
rises against them more and more, in proportion as they daily deviate from
their first laudable Institution. Taverns were in∣tended, at their
primitive Erection, as pub∣lick <HI>Refectories,</HI> where Men, whose
Business called them Abroad from their Families, and single Gentlemen,
who had no Familes at all, might resort for a chearful and necessary
Refreshment. So that <HI>Taverns</HI> stood in this Town for much the
same End, as <HI>Inns</HI> are commodiously situated up and down the
Country: But, by the Use they are now con∣verted to, Men are not
<HI>refresh'd</HI> there, but <HI>debauch'd,</HI> and taken off from the
Pursuit of their Business.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="460"/>I WAS led into this Subject, on the Eve of a
late drunken Holiday, when, returning Home in a melancholy Disposition, at
a later Hour than usual, I was unexpectedly saluted with an unlucky Piece
of News, that a Kins∣man, who, notwithstanding all that a famous
Predecessor of mine had wittily remark'd, in Ridicule of that silly
Practice, wou'd try to drive to himself Home on the <HI>Coach-box</HI>; when
he was scarce able to get into the <HI>Coach,</HI> without the Help of its
<HI>proper Driver</HI>; had, by the Way, got so dangerous a Fall, that he was
thrown almost out of the World: And just as I was plung'd into a profound
Meditation on this ill Accident, Word was brought me, That <HI>Literatus</HI>
and <HI>Urbanus,</HI> two Bosom Intimates, having drank toge∣ther, to
Excess, the latter lost his <HI>Civility,</HI> and the former his
<HI>Wits,</HI> so far as to push on a Dis∣pute about a mere Trifle, 'till
one of them was killed, and his <HI>Friend</HI> and <HI>Murderer,</HI> left
behind, to imbitter his surviving Days with a <HI>Remorse,</HI> which the
other's <HI>Death</HI> was pre∣serable to.—I was lost in the
startling Thought, how dreadful it must be, to drop out of a
<HI>Temporary</HI> into an <HI>Eternal</HI> Existence, in so deplorable,
and unprepar'd a State! which brought immediately to my Remem∣brance, what the
old King says to <HI>Hamlet</HI> in the Tragedy.</P>
<Q><PB N="454" REF="461"/> 
<L>Thus was I—</L> 
<L>Cut off, ev'n in the <HI>Blossoms</HI> of my Sin,</L> 
<L>No <HI>Reck'ning</HI> made, but sent to my
<HI>Account,</HI></L> 
<L>With all my Imperfections on my Head.</L> 
<L>Oh Horrible! <HI>most</HI> Horrible!</L></Q>
<P>THIS sensible and moving Complaint, so awfully placed in the
Mouth of a <HI>Ghost,</HI> strikes a considerate Auditor with Terror, and
leaves him <HI>warn'd</HI> and <HI>astonish'd:</HI> But, there is a Scene
in a Comedy, call'd <HI>The Ly∣ing Lovers,</HI> That comes more immediately to
this Subject, of a Gentleman's Stabbing his Friend in the Fury of his
Drunkenness; and which, if it had been read or heard with At∣tention, by
<HI>Urbanus,</HI> would probably have prevented his own becoming a too real
Ex∣ample of <HI>this unhappy Truth,</HI> That a Man, who in the present
Moment, is Master of the strongest Reason, Possessor of the
greatest Honour, and adorn'd with the finest Senti∣ments of Religion,
Friendship and Huma∣nity, may, in two or three Hours <HI>drinking,</HI> be
push'd forward, by the Rage of Wine, to act unheard-of <HI>Brutalities,</HI>
in direct Opposi∣tion to the Impulse of all its Virtues. I re∣commend this
useful Scene to the Perusal of those indanger'd Adventurers, who are apt
to be quarrelsome in their Cups, and yet dare rashly addict themselves to
an habitual In∣temperance.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="462"/>THE Fatigue of so melancholy a
Medita∣tion, cast me into a disorder'd kind of Sleep, in which it
furnished me (as <HI>Shakespear</HI> says) with <HI>the Stuff of which
Dreams are made.</HI> My Imagination, working busily upon the Tra∣ces of my
waking Thoughts, brought me into the Company of a Hoary and Venera∣ble Matron,
whose Eyes were so <HI>piercing bright,</HI> that they seem'd to have
increas'd by Age, their Faculty of Penetration. She told me, That her Name was
CAUTION, and bid∣ding me follow her, she conducted me, as the Prophetess
did <HI>Aeneas,</HI> into one of the Regions of the <HI>nether World,</HI>
where the Shades of all those, who depart this Life, in the Guilt of their
Debauches, are doom'd to in∣habit.</P>
<P>I FOUND my self, without being able to describe the Method of
my speedy Convey∣ance thither, in a vast Place like an Island,
incompass'd with a Moat of Liquid Fire, where different Crowds of People,
were un∣der the Torment of being <HI>forced</HI> to <HI>drink,</HI> every
Moment, till they were deprived of their Senses, and betrayed into
Extravagan∣cies, which never failed to fill their Hearts with Pain and
Remorse, for some enormous Transgression or other, committed by them
when so disorder'd.—Then the Fury that ad∣minister'd the Liquor,
had a Power of reco∣vering them, by representing their past Acti∣ons, in a
Glass, that serv'd them instead of <HI>Memory.</HI>—When they had
suffer'd the full <PB N="456" REF="463"/> Pangs of Sobriety, and pain'd their
Observa∣tion with what they <HI>might</HI> have been, and what they
<HI>were</HI>; the Fury drench'd them a∣fresh, with the Intoxicating Tide of
Torture; and this was the Repetition of a Life, whose Circle compos'd a Round
of Misery, that never was to know an End. Each Crowd was thus attended, by
some Deputy of in∣fernal Vengeance,</P>
<P>THE first, I took Notice of, was a Com∣pany of Gentlemen, who,
before they began to drink, were of robust Make of Body; they had Sanguine
Complexions, and carried <HI>Health</HI> in their whole Appearance: Before
these, a <HI>Devil,</HI> in the Dress of a <HI>Drawer,</HI> had placed a
vast Barrel of Liquor, of which when each had got his Dose, the Effects of
the Poison began to work differently upon these poor Patients, that
seem'd lately in a State so florid. Some, that were of the most gigantick
Size, like <HI>Father Dominick</HI> in the <HI>Spanish Fryer,</HI> sunk two
Yards and a Half in the <HI>Wetting.</HI> Others again, who were <HI>thin</HI>
Men, were bloated by Dropsies, into the Dimensions which the former had
shrunk from.—They, who just before, had Vigour enough to out-voice
their own Hunt∣ing-Horns, were, by a Dose or two of that strange,
alterative Liquor, brought to <HI>squeak</HI> like those <HI>Pipes,</HI>
which the <HI>Boys</HI> make of an <HI>Oat-straw.</HI>—They, who used
to leap Five-bar-Gates, Quickset-Hedges, and Park-Palings, could not wag a
Hand, or a Foot, with∣out <PB N="457" REF="464"/> crying out of the Gout, or the
Rheuma∣tism: These had been called in the World, COUNTRY 'SQUIRES, and were
active Men in their Time, at the Hunting down of a <HI>Fox,</HI> or crying up
of a <HI>Burgess.</HI>—But it was dismal to behold, what Faces they
made now, when the Fury shew'd them their own Figures, in the startling
Glass of Reflection!</P>
<P>THE next Place, that old Mother CAUTION conducted me to, was a
gloomy Walk, which the farther we penetrated into it, was the deeper darkened
with the Shade of <HI>Juniper</HI> and <HI>Eugh</HI> Trees: In the midst, was
a Little Thatch'd House, as full as it could hold, of Earthen Vessels,
stor'd with a <HI>Juice,</HI> that was but one Remove from <HI>Poyson:</HI>
The poor Wretches, who frequented this dark Hovel, where mostly
<HI>English,</HI> and pleaded the Privi∣lilege of their <HI>Liberty,</HI> for
getting rid of their Senses, as <HI>freely,</HI> as their Countrymen, of
higher Quality, who paid <HI>dearer</HI> for the same <HI>Right,</HI> in
proportion to their better Circum∣stances, and dealt in Poysons of a
slower Operation. Many Customers went in here but half Dress'd, and came
out again Naked; Most of them labour'd under Miseries and Diseases
without a Name; and some of them endeavour'd to hang themselves on the
Trees that gave a Name to the fatal Liquor.—</P>
<P>BUT, I was <HI>transported</HI> in the next Place I came to, and
flatter'd my Imagination, that I was got out of the infernal Regions, into
those, which were form'd for Delight, and, <PB N="458" REF="465"/> by the
Ancients, called, The <HI>Elysian Fields.</HI> I was led into a noble
Edifice, adorn'd with the most magnificent Furniture, Gildings, Sculptures,
Paintings, Glass-Sconces, with hun∣dreds of Wax Tapers lighted in them; the
Roofs ecchoed and re-sounded, with the finest Mu∣sick, that cou'd arise
from the most elegant Variety of the sweetest Instruments. Here was an
Assembly of the most active and fine∣shap'd Gentlemen, together with a
Set of the most seemingly modest and beautiful Women, that ever my Eyes
beheld;—when, immediately, two <HI>Devils,</HI> in <HI>Masquerade,
appear'd</HI> to the Company, with the most complaisant and inviting Airs
imaginable.—One of them led the Gentlemen to a luxuri∣ous Table, adorn'd
with Crystals, replenish∣ed with the strongest and richest Wines, of
all Growths and Climates, and dealt Glasses round with Profusion: The
other, which was a <HI>She Devil,</HI> conducted the Ladies, in like Manner, to
another Table, richly ornament∣ed with Silver Equipages, and Vases of the
finest <HI>China,</HI> which were filled, as she pre∣tended, with Liquors,
that promoted <HI>Sobri∣ety,</HI> but had really so different an Effect, that
the Fumes and Vapours arising from their <HI>Brimmers,</HI> forced me to
remove to a greater Distance.</P>
<P>This <HI>drinking</HI> Scene being finished, the Word was given
to <HI>Mask</HI> and <HI>Dance</HI>;—But, instead of forming a regular
Motion, the whole Company, Male and Female, without <PB N="459" REF="466"/>
Distinction of Sex, Age or Condition, fell, jumbled, into one promiscuous
Heap, upon which ensued horrid Outcries, and a confus'd Clash of Swords,
from Men, who were mur∣dering one another, about Daughters, Wives and
Sisters: So that in a Moment, me∣thought, like the shifting of a Scene in
Dr. <HI>Faustus,</HI> this fine Apartment was chang'd in∣to an
<HI>Hospital,</HI> distinguish'd into little Clo∣sets, like
Cells.—In these unhappy little Cells, were Ladies under a Course of
Tor∣ment, (a Fury always holding before their Eyes, a Picture of their departed
Beauty:) I took Notice of <HI>One,</HI> whose Picture repre∣sented the
smoothest, Satten Skin, with the finest Tincture imaginable, while the
blub∣bering Original was melting away in Tears, with Cheeks swell'd into
Carbuncles, and spotted over with purple Pimples: Another, whose Portrait
display'd a Loveliness, almost Angelical, was staring on it with
bloodshot Eyes, and a Face, so distorted with Convul∣sions, that she
look'd, methought, more frightful than the <HI>Fury,</HI> that attended
her.—I begg'd of CAUTION to let me retreat from this melancholy
Mansion, because it fill'd me with more Horror than I was able to
support, to see the Effects of such seeming Pleasantry, producing
Despair and real Mi∣sery; and such alluring Beauty, betray'd in∣to such
hideous and frightful Deformity.</P>
<P><PB N="460" REF="467"/>CAUTION was so obliging, as to grant my
Petition in Part; but told me, That as I must carry <HI>Warning</HI> with me,
when I return'd to the upper Regions, she was under a Ne∣cessity of
conducting me to several other Pla∣ces. This made it impossible for me to
ha∣sten out of my Dream, and will not, I hope, expose me to the Censure,
which we old Peo∣ple sometimes lie under, of being <HI>tedious</HI> in our
<HI>Story-telling,</HI> and talking rather by <HI>Rule</HI> than by
<HI>Measure.</HI>—In short, I find I must <HI>Dream on,</HI> 'till
I come to the End of my next Paper.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>VISION</HI> continued.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS as much deceiv'd in the next Place, that Old Mother CAUTION
convey'd me to, as I had been in the last.—A mag∣nificent
<HI>Square</HI> open'd to my View, whose <PB N="461" REF="468"/> four Sides
were form'd by the finest Architec∣ture. Those Stately Palaces, my Guide
told me, were inhabited by Persons of the high∣est Rank and Fortune, and
who were reck∣oned to have the most <HI>delicate</HI> Taste of
<HI>Living.</HI> She carry'd me into one, that appear'd the noblest in the
Quadrangle; and, there, from a Window towards the Garden, which is situ∣ated
on an Eminence, that borders on deli∣cious Fields, and commands an opening
Ex∣tent of Country, she shew'd me, by the Help of a Prospective Glass,
a Dozen fair <HI>Manor-Towns,</HI> all surrounded by a pleasant Variety of
Hills and Dales, Plains and Woods, Green Meadows and Corn Fields, richly waving
with a promis'd Harvest: Gardens, and sweet <HI>Parterres,</HI> with Fish
Ponds and Canals that glitter'd thro' the Trees; All which, she said, was
but a small Portion of the Earth, en∣joy'd by this Son of Fortune, who was
Ma∣ster of that fine Palace we stood in—This House had been, it
seems, every Day, in the Afternoon, and every Night, and all the Night long,
crowded from Top to Bottom, with People of all Sexes, Ages, and Coun∣tries;
who, provided they had the Merit of <HI>wanting nothing,</HI> were welcome to
partake of all the Abundance of this Place; where no∣thing appear'd, but what
was noble and delightful. The Earth, from Pole to Pole, was ransack'd (as
were the <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Water</HI>) to supply this House with
Delicacies.</P>
<P><PB N="462" REF="469"/>BUT the Owner (who gloried in his
Hospi∣tality, without esteeming any one of his Guests, but in proportion
as he profess'd an Admira∣tion of this Ostentatious Magnificence of Living)
valued himself most upon the Va∣riety of his tasteful <HI>Wines,</HI>
which Merchants, from all Quarters of the World, were Hour∣ly emptying in upon
him. They were distin∣guish'd by such different Names, that it would
require as much <HI>Study,</HI> as would make a <HI>Scho∣lar</HI> in any other
Science, to Register, and do Justice to their <HI>Titles, Colours,
Tastes,</HI> and the happy Places which produc'd them. Dif∣ferent Companies
in every Apartment, had their <HI>Signals,</HI> and <HI>gave Fire</HI>
together; and, by their Number, it was reckon'd, That every <HI>leading
Glass,</HI> that was turn'd up by the gay <HI>Master,</HI> pour'd out about
a <HI>Tun,</HI> includ∣ing Servants Computations, by way of
<HI>Per∣quisite,</HI> and <HI>Emolument.</HI></P>
<P>CAUTION, at the <HI>Sound</HI> of every <HI>Health,</HI> bid me
view the Manors from the Garden Window; and I perceiv'd a Man in a Black Gown,
presenting a Roll of Parchment to another, who was a Jolly kind of Fellow,
and <HI>Steward,</HI> it seems, to the Landlord, arm'd with a <HI>Letter</HI>
of <HI>Attorney,</HI> to sign what Deeds he should <HI>find
necessary.</HI>—No sooner was this Parchment return'd to the Man in
Black, but immediately the Prospect shorten'd, by the Length of one whole
Vil∣lage, which, vanishing from our Sight, left us no other Land Mark, where
it stood, but <PB N="463" REF="470"/> a vast and fruitful <HI>Crab
Tree.</HI>—The Healths went round so frequently, and so merrily, that
the Villages and Manor-Towns, disappear'd like Mists, in a Sunny Morning;
till at last, the Gentleman in Black, with a Train of frightful Monsters at
his Heels, en∣ter'd fiercely the <HI>Mansion-House,</HI> whence all the
Company ran hastily away; and the louder the Master call'd after them, so
much the faster they continued running.</P>
<P>AS soon as we were got into the <HI>Square</HI> (alas! <HI>fuit
Ilium!</HI>) I mean the Spot, where the Square <HI>had stood</HI>; all the
Palaces, were vanish'd; and turn'd, methought, into an <HI>Orchard</HI> of
<HI>Crab-Trees:</HI> With whose Fruit, a Croud of <HI>fine Gentlemen,</HI>
who were running away in their Shirts, were pelted without Mercy, by red
<HI>Furies,</HI> to whose <HI>Favourites</HI> (a Number of <HI>Vintners</HI>
and <HI>lucky Gamesters</HI>) they had, but just before, transferr'd their
<HI>Birth-right.</HI></P>
<P>IT is impossible to express the Anguish, the Despair, of
these <HI>unlanded</HI> Gentlemen; some tore down Branches, and accusing
one another for the Seduction of ill Example, form'd a Battle with
dismember'd <HI>Crab-Trees:</HI> others hang'd themselves among the Boughs,
at the Approach of ill-look'd Ruffi∣ans, who surrounded them in their New
<HI>Orchard.</HI></P>
<P>THE next was an Assembly of Men of <HI>Wit</HI>;
consisting of a <HI>Poet,</HI> an <HI>Orator,</HI> a
<HI>Phi∣losopher,</HI> a <HI>Mathematician,</HI> a <HI>Divine,</HI> a
<HI>Mili∣tary</HI> <PB N="464" REF="471"/> <HI>Officer,</HI> the <HI>fine
Gentleman,</HI> who enter∣tain'd them all, and an <HI>Eunnch,</HI> who sung
in the <HI>Opera.</HI>—The <HI>Poet</HI> recited a <HI>Hymn</HI> to
<HI>Bacchus</HI> of his own Composing—The <HI>Orator,</HI> with great
Gracefulness, harangu'd upon the Force of <HI>Eloquence,</HI> which he
at∣tributed to the Warmth of <HI>Wine</HI>—The <HI>Philosopher</HI>
set <HI>Cato</HI>'s <HI>Virtue</HI> before them, as held <HI>steady,</HI>
by the <HI>Strength</HI> of <HI>Drinking.</HI>—The <HI>Divine</HI>
averr'd, That, <HI>Solomon</HI> said, <HI>Wine made the Face of a Man to</HI>
SHINE, and prov'd it very <HI>soberly,</HI> by shewing its <HI>Effects</HI>
upon his own <HI>illuminated</HI> Countenance.—The <HI>Mathematician</HI>
produc'd a <HI>Pun,</HI> and said, He lov'd a full <HI>Gage,</HI> because
it was the <HI>Perfection</HI> of <HI>Measure:</HI> And to mea∣sure
exactly, was the <HI>Duty</HI> of his Prosession.—The
<HI>Officer</HI> commended <HI>Wine,</HI> as a great Inflamer of
<HI>Courage</HI>; and quoted a <HI>Dutch</HI> Author, in Defence of the Use
of <HI>Drinking,</HI> in Times of <HI>War:</HI> And the faith∣ful Service of
<HI>Auxillary Brandy.</HI>—The <HI>fine Gentleman</HI> expatiated on the
Advantage to be reap'd by entertaining such polite Com∣pany, when
assembled over a <HI>Bottle</HI>; and ordered the <HI>Fury</HI> that
attended them, to put round the Glass: At which the <HI>Eunuch</HI> began to
<HI>sing,</HI> and the whole Company clap∣ped their Hands, and roar'd out
<HI>Encore,</HI> and <HI>Bravo.</HI></P>
<P>NO sooner had the Glass gone round, but the <HI>Orator</HI>
propos'd <HI>Method</HI> to be the Foun∣dation of <HI>Argument</HI>; and
insisted, that All <PB N="465" REF="472"/> should talk in their
<HI>Turns</HI>; which, as soon as any began to do, he broke in upon his own
Rule; and gallop'd, with a bawling Voice, through <HI>Divisions</HI> and
<HI>Subdivisions,</HI> 'till he had <HI>disunited</HI> the whole
Company.—The <HI>Poet,</HI> thought he had equal Right to the Use of
his Tongue, and rose to assert it, in an exorbitant Manner, just as he
found he had lost the Use of it.—The <HI>Philo∣sopher</HI> cried
out, in vain, That Men must labour to subdue their Passions; and, to
con∣vince them how easy it was, fell into so <HI>vio∣lent</HI> a one
himself, that he knock'd down the poor <HI>Poet,</HI> with a Club, called
<HI>Argumen∣tum Baccilinum</HI>; For, says he, there is no <HI>other</HI> Way
of <HI>disputing</HI> against those who deny <HI>first
Principles;</HI>—The <HI>Divine,</HI> seeing a <HI>Philosopher</HI>
turn <HI>Murderer,</HI> and talk, at the same Time of <HI>Principles,</HI>
thunder'd out <HI>Ana∣thema</HI>'s against <HI>Disputing at all,</HI> where
the Business, they met for, was <HI>Drinking.</HI>—The
<HI>Mathematician</HI> was muttering <HI>Problems,</HI> and tracing out a
<HI>Globe</HI> upon the Table, with his <HI>Fingers</HI> dipt in the
<HI>Liquor</HI> that the Scufflers had <HI>spilt</HI> upon it; and the
<HI>fine-bred Gentleman</HI> to assist the Depth of his important
Designs, was pouring more Wine, to that which was spilt already, lest he
might want a Supply of Liquor; But just as the Figure was upon the Point of
being finished, the Officer swore it made <HI>dull Company,</HI> and rubb'd
it out with his Sleeve: The <HI>Mathematician</HI> seeing his <HI>Globe
defac'd,</HI> cried, The <HI>World was at an</HI> <PB N="466" REF="473"/>
<HI>End</HI>; to which the <HI>Philosopher</HI> and <HI>Divine</HI> agreeing,
and the rest of the Company deny∣ing it, they fell all together by the Ears,
and squeezed the <HI>Eunuch</HI> to Death, while he was trying the Influence
of his <HI>Musick</HI> against <HI>Madness.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Fury was just going to re∣store them to their
Senses again, that they might perform over the same Exercise, (which they
do, it seems, every Hour, just as strange Sights are shewn in Fairs, or
as Drunken Men renew their waking Debauches, after a little Interval of Sleep
in their Life∣times) I left them, with a pungent Regret, that there should be
in Liquor such a Power of turning <HI>Strength</HI> into <HI>Weakness,
Health</HI> into <HI>Sickness, Beauty</HI> into <HI>Deformity, Riches</HI>
into <HI>Poverty, Friendship</HI> into <HI>Murder, Wis∣dom</HI> into
<HI>Folly,</HI> and <HI>Wit</HI> into <HI>Madness!</HI></P>
<P>I WAK'D, with no small Wonder at this sleeping Ramble of my
Imagination: But turning over a Collection of Old News-Pa∣pers, bound up in
Volumes, from the <HI>Resto∣ration,</HI> gradually downward, I found them
fill'd with Yearly Proofs, that Men act the very same Follies,
<HI>waking</HI> in this World, that I had been Dreaming were done in the
other.</P>
<P>THERE I found Accounts of Men of great Estates, dead in a
Prison, from the Effects of Drinking:—Quarrels every jot as
fantastical as any I have been describing—There were Accounts of Men
casting Lots, <PB N="467" REF="474"/> in their Liquor, which should be
<HI>hang'd,</HI> and which the <HI>Hangman</HI>;—Here were fine
Histories of others, who, in a ridicu∣lous Bravado, had drank the Health of
the <HI>Devil,</HI> in a Punch-bowl season'd with <HI>Opium,</HI> and
launch'd down, while the Humour was on 'em, to pay a Visit to their grateful
Patron.—I look'd back as far as the Time, when certain wild Beasts,
called <HI>Mo∣hocks,</HI> had broke loose, here in <HI>London</HI>; and I
found that it was no new Thing for Generals, and Common Soldiers, Lords,
Watchmen, and Drawers, Counts, Coblers and Hackney-Coachmen, to engage in
<HI>no unequal</HI> Matches together, and fight with all the <HI>Triumph</HI>
of <HI>Drunkenness</HI>; nay, what is more, I found all this as duly
<HI>repeated here,</HI> as I dreamt it to be in the Lower Regions.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus poring over my News Papers, and reflecting, that
the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Man,</HI> tallied exactly (as to its Extravagance)
with the Dreams of his disorder'd <HI>Fancy,</HI> I heard a Noise in the
Street, as if all <HI>Barbican</HI> were in an Uproar, and looking out of my
Window, I saw Men with gil∣ded Staves, and an Air of exerted Magistra∣cy,
knocking down a Set of roaring little <HI>Heroes,</HI> with <HI>Leeks</HI> in
their Hats.—In∣quiring into the Matter, I was told, by an Arch-Wag
(smiling, as if he derided my Ignorance) That it was nothing, but a few
<HI>Welshmen</HI>; who were got <HI>Loyally</HI> <PB N="468" REF="475"/>
<HI>Drunk,</HI> and did sober People a Mischief, in Honour of the good
Saint, their <HI>Patron.</HI></P>
<P>I RESOLV'D then (as extravagant as my Thoughts seem'd to me
before, and per∣fectly <HI>remov'd</HI> out of Nature) to pen them down;
since I found, such Persons did <HI>really exist,</HI> as I had
believ'd, Imagination could only <HI>shadow,</HI> in the preposterous
Inconsi∣stence of a Dream.—It may, thought I, be of <HI>Use,</HI>
to shew Men, who are ad∣dicted to this Vice, their Pictures, plac'd in the
fullest Point of Absurdity: And, since most of them take <HI>Hell</HI>
to be a <HI>Dream,</HI> it is natural enough to expect, that a <HI>Dream</HI>
of <HI>Hell</HI> may divert them.</P>

<P>AMONG a numberless Variety of <HI>Si∣militudes,</HI> by which
the Different Wits of Poets, Satirists, Philosophers, and Divines, have
endeavour'd to express the Shortness, and Insignificance, of Humane Life,
I am most pleas'd with that of <HI>Lucian,</HI> where he compares it to
those little Bubbles, which are made by a Shower of Rain, that falls upon
some Lake or River; where they are bro∣ken, as fast as they are form'd, and
give way to others, that immediately follow them.</P>
<P>THERE is, in this Comparison, the <HI>Empti∣ness,</HI> the
<HI>Smoke,</HI> and the <HI>Bustle,</HI> as well as the <HI>Weakness,</HI>
and <HI>Brevity</HI> of Life: It is, me∣thinks, a very mortifying Picture of
that <HI>Step, half stridden,</HI> That <HI>Sporting-Field of Fortune,</HI>
which St. <HI>Augustin</HI> has, so compre∣hensively, explain'd himself
upon, when he says, 
<Q REND="inline">"It is a Life, ebbing with Doubts, flowing with
Hopes, and beaten by Mise∣ries; <PB N="470" REF="477"/> puff'd up with Luxury,
and made lean by Abstinence: Distracted by Wishes, sharpen'd by Cares,
and blunted by Indo∣lence; arrogant in Youth, peevish in Age; restless in
Health, and impatient in Sick∣ness: And, at last, so over-clouded by
<HI>Death,</HI> that, <HI>Ceasing to be,</HI> one would think, <HI>It never
was,</HI></Q></P>
<P>I WAS insensibly attracted to this Subject, by my Perusal of
Three <HI>Epitaphs,</HI> widely different in their Designs: For the First
ex∣cites <HI>Humility</HI> in High-Life, The Second ad∣vises
<HI>Retirement,</HI> and The Third inflames to <HI>Glory.</HI></P>
<P>THAT which recommends Humility to the Possessors of Power
and Dignity, is the Trans∣lation of a <HI>Latin</HI> Inscription, on the
Monu∣ment of a Duke of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> in the Cathe∣dral Church of that
City.</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>Here, Great, and Good, <HI>Duke HENRY</HI> buried lies:</L>
<L>O'er their dead <HI>Founder</HI> these proud Arches
rise.</L>
<L>His pious <HI>Consort,</HI> too (the <HI>Poor</HI>'s safe
Guide)</L>
<L>Mix'd with his <HI>Dust,</HI> clings <HI>closer</HI> to
his Side:</L>
<L><HI>MATILDA,</HI> Daughter to Great <HI>England</HI>'s
King!</L>
<L>Whose Virtues, spite of <HI>Death,</HI> still
<HI>bloom</HI> in Spring.</L>
<L>King <HI>OTHO,</HI> too, their Son, here shares their
Rest;</L>
<L>By both fond Parents Arms, again possess'd.</L>
<L>And, here,—O Grief of Beauty! near him, lies,</L>
<L>The <HI>Charmer</HI> of his <HI>Heart,</HI> and all Mens
<HI>Eyes!</HI></L>
<L>That lovely Form, whose Smiles <HI>inflam'd
Desire,</HI></L>
<L>Here, Food for Worms, can no <HI>soft Woes</HI>
inspire.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<PB N="471" REF="478"/>
<L>Thou, Passenger, whose Eyes this <HI>Marble</HI>
view,</L>
<L>Learn to be <HI>Wise;</HI> nor <HI>fleeting</HI> Hopes
pursue:</L>
<L>Life is an Evening Breeze; a murm'ring Breath;</L>
<L>That blows, till <HI>Sun-set,</HI> then grows <HI>calm,</HI>
in Death.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>THE Second <HI>Epitaph</HI> (which recommends, as I said, a
<HI>retir'd Life)</HI> is that of <HI>Similis,</HI> a Military Officer, of
great Experience, in the Time of the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI>; who obtain'd
Leave, with no small Difficulty, to retire, at last, into the Country; and
living there, but <HI>Seven Years,</HI> in a quiet and peaceful Privacy,
enjoyed more solid Satisfaction, than he had ever reap'd before, from all his
long Life, spent in Hurry, Danger, and Distinction: So that, coming, at
last, to <HI>die,</HI> he appointed by his <HI>Will,</HI> this
<HI>Epitaph.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>Shou'd Curious Readers wish to know,</L> 
<L>Whose Dust their Feet are pressing;</L> 
<L><HI>SIMILIS,</HI> fam'd in War, lies low,</L> 
<L>His Country's Boast, and Blessing.</L> 
<L>Long did he Toil, and Grasp, and Strive,</L> 
<L>Yet <HI>lost</HI> his <HI>Time,</HI> he fears;</L> 
<L>For, tho', till <HI>Seventy-Six, ALIVE,</HI></L> 
<L>He <HI>LIV'd,</HI> but <HI>Seven</HI> short Years.</L></Q>
<P>THE Third <HI>Epitaph,</HI> to give it at once, the highest
praise which <HI>can</HI> be given it, is wor∣thy its illustrious Subject,
the Great CZAR of RUSSIA. It was sent me by a Gentle∣man, to whose Hands it
came, in <HI>Latin.</HI> But <PB N="472" REF="479"/> I was so justly charm'd
with the Sublimity of the Sentiments, that I could not resist the
Temptation of giving it to the La∣dies, and other <HI>English</HI> Readers,
in their own native Language; because I would have none of them robb'd of the
Pleasure, which I receiv'd, in perusing it.</P>

Answer to them.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Author of the <HI>PLAIN DEALER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> PERCEIVING, that it is customa∣ry, for you, to receive
Letters from our Sex, I am willing to throw myself into your Protection, in
Hopes of meeting with a favourable Regard from you, and that you may
assist me in my Distress.</P>
<P> I AM a young Woman of some Fortune, and of no mean
Extraction; and was, some Months ago, the <HI>Happiest Woman in the
World:</HI> My Story, in short, is this: There was a young Gentleman, every
way superior <PB N="476" REF="483"/> to myself, thought fit to make his
Addres∣ses to me. At first I concluded, from the Inequality of our
Fortunes, that he did it purely for a little Diversion; but, by I know not
what kind of Infatuation, I was soon perswaded, to believe he was just
and sin∣cere in his Pretensions. From hence, there sprang an Intimacy
between us, which last∣ed a considerable Time, and which, I ne∣ver thought
would have a Period, 'till Death had separated us for ever: But, behold the
Vicissitudes and Changes of Life! the un∣expected Turns of Fortune! which
no Hu∣mnn Foresight can prevent: When I thought myself almost arrived to
the highest Perfe∣ction of earthly Happiness, <HI>Strephon,</HI> the unkind
<HI>Strephon!</HI> forsook me, and bereft me of all my Joys, and Hopes, at
once.</P>
<P> IT is to me very surprizing, that so intimate a
Correspondence, which was carried on with so much pretended Satisfaction,
on his Part, shou'd now be so irksome to him, as to make him avoid my
Company, and even the very Sight of me. I cannot pretend to penetrate into his
<HI>Thoughts,</HI> but I am sure his <HI>Actions</HI> always carried in them
the Marks of a real and unfeigned Passion. He seem'd ever studious, to
<HI>divert</HI> and <HI>please</HI> me; and trea∣ted me, with a
<HI>Civility</HI> and <HI>Respect,</HI> which is not common, even in the
most <HI>passionate Lover.</HI> It is now, I think, two Months since he
payed me a Visit; nor have I heard from him, to let me know the Reason of
his <PB N="477" REF="484"/> Absence, which, together with some private
Intimations I have had from others, gives me sufficient Grounds to believe he
is <HI>false.</HI></P>
<P> AND is it possible! after such an uncom∣mon Behaviour, he
should abandon, nay, <HI>despise</HI> the Person he once appear'd so
much to admire! Are these his Protestations of <HI>eternal Love!</HI> Is
<HI>this</HI> his <HI>Friendship?</HI> Has he so soon forgot his Vows, of
Constancy and Fidelity? <HI>Who,</HI> even of the most <HI>Wise</HI> and
<HI>Prudent,</HI> could have suspected, much less discern'd
<HI>Deceit,</HI> under the fair Appear∣ance of so much seeming
<HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Since∣rity?</HI> I was so far from distrusting
him, whom, I thought, the <HI>Virtuous</HI> and <HI>Gene∣rous Strephon,</HI>
that I put my whole Confi∣dence in him, and was innocently betray'd, by the
irresistable Charms of his Eloquence.</P>
<P> I HAVE wrote to him, several Times, since he has left me;
but either my Let∣ters were intercepted, or he is wholly re∣gardless of them;
for I have not, as yet, received an Answer; nor can I, by any Means, inform
myself, what has been the Cause of his unkind Separation. For this
Reason, I take this publick Opportunity, both to ask your Advice, in so
critical a Juncture, and to convince him, of his dis∣ingenuous Treatment of
one, for whom he pretended, once, to have the most unalte∣rable Veneration.
If you think fit, to give this Letter a Place, in one of your Papers, I know it
will come to his Hands; and, <PB N="478" REF="485"/> perhaps, such a Memorial,
under your Au∣thority and Protection, may have a greater Influence over him
than any common Epi∣stle. I desire therefore you will insert it, and
oblige your most humble Servant,</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> IT is a common Observation, That Trees that <HI>Blossom
soonest,</HI> are liable to be soonest Frost nipt. As if Nature, by
ob∣serving the full Growth of such forward Virtues, mistook the
Progress of Years, and measured <HI>Maturity</HI> not by <HI>Age,</HI> but
by <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P> I MOURN the Misery, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, of having lately lost
a <HI>Friend,</HI> whose Picture I will present you with, as it is drawn to
the Life, in my Memory!—</P>
<P> IN Business there was a <HI>Pleasure,</HI> always
triumphing over his Hurry; such a Suavity and Complacence in his Behaviour,
as at∣tracted the <HI>Heart,</HI> before the <HI>Head</HI> could have Time to
<HI>weigh</HI> him. He was subser∣vient to no Passion, but
<HI>Love,</HI> which made him a Friend to all Mankind, nor could those narrow
Limits of Soul, which con∣tract Mens <HI>Friendships</HI> to their
<HI>Interests,</HI> re∣strain <PB N="479" REF="486"/> his boundless
Generosity, which made him <HI>Every Body's,</HI> who had
<HI>Miseries,</HI> with∣in the Compass of his Easing. He had so
feverish a <HI>Thirst</HI> of <HI>Obliging,</HI> that an Enemy would have
call'd his Liberality rather his <HI>Disease</HI> than his
<HI>Ornament.</HI> He sought for no Reward, but the <HI>Prosperity</HI> of
those he favour'd; and if at any Time it was not in his Power to
<HI>grant,</HI> he was more asham'd, and unsatisfied, than the Person
whom he disappointed; and, by way of Atonement, injoined himself the
Penance of <HI>watching</HI> for some <HI>happier</HI> Opportunity, when he
cou'd meet the Wish above half way, and prevent its Explanation.</P>
<P> NOR did this Benevolence of his Nature extend only to those
within the Sphere of his Acquaintance; whose-ever Misfortunes came to his
Knowledge, made an equal, and noble Impression;—For he
<HI>impro∣priated</HI> all Mens Griefs, till he had lessen'd them, by
<HI>Comforts.</HI></P>
<P> IF there were any so Ungenerous as to make him their
<HI>Enemy,</HI> he was as willing to forgive, as they to offer the
Injury.—Judge, then, how happy must those few have been, who were
blest with his Inti∣macy! Whatever Tenderness is conceived in Nature from
Mothers to their new-born Infants, may deserve to pass as some faint
Image of his Sweetness:—His Faith, and his Friendships, were as
lasting as his <HI>Life</HI> was.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="487"/> WITH all these Advantages, never had
Man an humbler Opinion of himself; which was an Armor that defended him,
against the <HI>Flattery</HI> of Fortune, as his Stea∣diness despis'd her
<HI>Malice.</HI> To <HI>Him,</HI> to be <HI>High</HI> or <HI>Low,</HI> were
Accidents merely indif∣ferent: The one cou'd neither exalt, nor cou'd the other
depress his Sentiments: And had Heaven thought fit to have ex∣empted his
Body, like his Mind, from In∣firmities, He had been as well <HI>Immortal</HI>
as <HI>Inestimable.</HI> The fashionable Vanities which allure and
captivate young Hearts, could never get Admittance into his masculine, and
discerning Bosom, always guarded by Reason and Virtue. He renounc'd, in
the Pride of his Youth, those Enjoyments which others content themselves
with disclaiming, when the Power of possessing them is either lost
or abated; Oh! I am left in a <HI>Desart,</HI> without this Guide, that my
fond Soul hung upon! And nothing remains, but the Influence of his
<HI>Example,</HI> that can be worth the Wish of any Man, who had the
Bles∣sing to be acquainted with him.—</P>
<P> IN Justice to his Memory, allow this little Specimen of my
departed Friend, a Place in one of your Papers, and you will much oblige,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I HAVE had such an Over-mind to see you, that I came to
Town on purpose, being a Kind of <HI>Plain Dealer</HI> myself. For tho'f I
am a Country Fellow, and no <HI>La∣tin</HI> Scollard, yet I reckon myself the
wisest in our whole Parish, except (mayhap) the Parson: And he is so
churlish, that one dare not <HI>deal plainly</HI> with him. I believe you to
be no proud Man, and that made me so bold as to come to seek you out, being
in hopes to have told our Parson, that I had conversed, in my Time, with as
<HI>Learned</HI> a Man as he.</P>
<P> GOOD Master PLAIN DEALER, be so kind as to tell a Body, in
your next Paper, where you may be sound, and rather than lose the Sight of
so good-natur'd, an old Man, I will come once more on purpose, tho'f I
shou'd have no other Business. When I enquired after you, I thought I
shou'd ne'er have found you out; but then, at last, I was told, by a very
young Man, that you was to be met with, at the <HI>Tower</HI> of
<HI>Barbican.</HI>—Z'lids, I was never so so glad in all my
Life-time; but soon after I found I had nothing to be glad on, and I doubt
the Rogue put the <HI>City-Bite</HI> upon me; for I have searched every Crick
and Corner to find out such a <HI>Tower,</HI> and could <PB N="482" REF="489"/> get no News of it: <HI>Barbican</HI> I did find, and the
<HI>Tower</HI> I did find; but I cou'd find no <HI>Tower</HI> of
<HI>Barbican.</HI> I have worn out two Shooes by the Bargain, that were as good
as any two Pair I can get hereabouts. Pray, if there be any such
<HI>Tower,</HI> and you live in it, I beseech you to order Matters so, that
I may come to find it out.</P>
<P> I READ your Papers, and understand them as well as most
other Folks, all but your <HI>Top Sentences,</HI> which are generally so
hard, that they puzzle all our Parish. The best Scollards of us put our
Heads toge∣ther to find out their Meaning; and, when we can't agree about it,
we go to consult our Parson; and, I am sorry to say it, he pro∣nounces
a hard Judgment upon them.—He does not think it <HI>worth his
Trouble</HI> (he says) to <HI>understand</HI> Heathen <HI>Authors,</HI>
be∣cause those Men were seldom good <HI>Chri∣stians.</HI>—But
this shall not prevent my Reading your Papers, for I have a better Opinion of
you, than to think so prophane∣ly of any of your Friends and Acquain∣tance.
Being in over-great Haste for the Country, have but just Time to put you in
mind of me, and, wishing you in good Health, as I am at this present
Writing (blessed be God for it) remain,</P>

<P> TURNING over the Works of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> lately
usher'd into the World by an extravagant Subscription, and finding the Six
Volumes, tho' called <HI>Shake∣spear</HI>'s Works, contained not his VENUS
and ADONIS, his TARQUIN and LU∣CRECE, and numberless other Miscellane∣ous
Pieces, which, for Richness of Fancy, and the many beautiful Descriptions
that adorn them, are far from being inferior to some of his more celebrated
Labours; I thought my self obliged to become a Pur∣chaser of the Seventh
Volume also, which appears to me, to have no Demerit to oc∣casion its
Exclusion.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="491"/> YOU, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, whose

Beauties, which shine every where thro' these charming Pieces; and the
rather, because I have been in∣form'd, That this Volume, which is so
necessary and essential a Part of the Works of that inimitable Author,
has not, by some of the Wits in <HI>Leading-Strings,</HI> been look'd upon
with equal Favour; because this Edition of it was not midwif'd into the
World, by the <HI>great Names</HI> that have condescended, for the
<HI>Emolument</HI> of the <HI>Publick,</HI> to shine in the Title Page of the
First Six Volumes: But as this may take up more Room, than you will have to
spare in one Paper, I shall now and then occasionally beg Leave, by your
Means, to recommend to the <HI>Implicite Witlings</HI> of the Age, those
Beauties which might otherwise escape their Observation.</P>
<P> AND as it is impossible, where ever I open the Book, not to
be surprized with the Beauties of this great Genius, I will pre∣sent your

<P> WITH this admirable Flow of Fancy, and lively Imagery, does
this unbounded Genius, forgetful indeed of her unfit Condition for Oratory,
whom he represents as thus Co∣pious, while he is forciby carried away by the
Stream of his own charming Imagina∣tion. I shall only mention, That the
De∣scription the Poet gives of her Rising to the Morn, her Last Will, her
Parley with her Maid, the Maid's sympathizing Beha∣viour; 
<PB N="489" REF="496"/> and his admirable Description of the Groom she
sent to <HI>Collatine,</HI> are Beau∣ties, in their Way, that have no Equal,
but in the same Author. But I cannot forbear recommending his Description
of the Picture he makes the unhappy Lady turn her Eyes to, of <HI>Troy</HI>
beleagur'd by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> to avenge the Rape of <HI>Hellen</HI>;
which, for Strength of Description, surpas∣ses any Thing of the like
Kind; and shews the Excellency of the <HI>Poet</HI>'s Art above that of the
<HI>Painter</HI> (as the <HI>Soul</HI> is to the <HI>Body</HI>) since 'tis

<L>The red Blood <HI>reek'd,</HI> to shew the <HI>Painter's

<P>I AM sorry, after so kind a Reception as has been given to my
Speculations, that any Necessity shou'd arise, for my parting, a little
precipitately, with my good-natur'd Readers: But <HI>Love,</HI> however
fashionable it is, among sage Writers, to call it a <HI>Weakness,</HI> is
well known to act with a <HI>Strength,</HI> that is irresistable: And I
need not inform Those, who have perus'd me, long, or with any to∣lerable
Degree of Attention, that <HI>Patty Amble</HI> holds an Influence over me, that
is too hard for all my Gravity; and breaks, like a But∣terfly, thro' my Cobweb
Resolutions.</P>
<P>NO longer ago than Yesterday Morning, there was nothing farther
from my Thoughts than the Discontinuance of my Weekly La∣bours: 
<PB N="494" REF="501"/> But, about an Hour before Dinner, all my Purposes
received new Colours; and, I am, now, no longer what I <HI>was,</HI> before
this short Billet metamorphos'd me.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Slavy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT length, I have determin'd, to be <HI>only yours,</HI> for
ever, and, in Gratitude for all those, scarce deserv'd, fine Things, your
Letter of last Week, oblig'd me with, I will say after you, next
<HI>Saturday</HI> Morn∣ing, whatever Words you wish most ardently to hear
me answer in.—But this is abso∣lutely, upon <HI>Condition,</HI> that
you put an End, immediately, to your <HI>Plain-Dealing.</HI> It is the most
odious Quality you have, and, you know, I could never bear it.—I have
given you, perhaps, too short a Warning; but you must do as well as you
can: For, pray Hea∣ven I hold in the Mind, if you take me not in the present
Humour, of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your <HI>Mistress,</HI> one Day more, And then,
alas! your Servant, <HI>MARTHA AMBLE.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>IT would be unreasonable for any of my <HI>Christian</HI>
Readers to expect a better Excuse than This, for my taking Leave of them,
so abruptly.—It is possible, however, that, <PB N="495" REF="502"/>
when our <HI>first Hurry of Business</HI> is a little over, I may have
Leisure, more than enough, to <HI>talk on,</HI> as I have done hitherto: But
un∣der what <HI>Name,</HI> or <HI>Shape,</HI> I shall make my Appearance, is
a Matter I am wholly <HI>dark</HI> in.—This only I am sure of, and
agree heartily with <HI>Her,</HI> in, That it must be any Thing rather than a
<HI>Plain Dealer</HI>; the Aver∣sion, if I am not mistaken, of every
<HI>Wife,</HI> in Christendom!</P>
<P>BUT to soften as much as possible the Abruptness of my
Departure, it may not be amiss to spend a little Conversation upon
those agreeable Correspondents, and indulgent Readers, which, in the
Course of this Work, I have met with: Next to the Pleasure of do∣ing Good,
the greatest, is to meet with Appro∣bation and Assistance in our
Attempts towards it: This has been my Happiness, and I hope it cannot be
attributed to any reproachable Weakness, when I confess I feel a Pang at
part∣ing with it. Barely to acknowledge amounts to Gratitude in those People
whom Fortune does not enable to return a Benefit; that is, at present, my
Case: My approaching Fate will allow me to make no better a Payment than
Thanks, which therefore I desire may be candidly accepted.</P>
<P>WHEN I had written thus far, an Acquain∣tance, whom in some of
the preceding Dis∣courses I have recommended to the publick for a
Pertness of Conceit and Flippancy of Tongue, happened to come into my Room, 
<PB N="496" REF="503"/> and taking up the Paper ran it hastily over, then
throwing it down with a petulant Sneer, and a brisk Voice, cry'd out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Foregad, con∣sidering your Sentiments, and
Circum∣stances, grave Sir, I can't help comparing you to a Criminal taking
leave of the Bye-Standers with Tears in his Eyes, before his
Execution.—Faith, I long to see thee turn'd off, thoul't make the
prettiest Fi∣gure of a <HI>Dangler:</HI> ha, ha,"</Q>—Then, changing
his Allegory, continued his Im∣pertinence thus, 
<Q REND="inline">"Matrimony, my good Friend, is a long and
tiresome Journey, and the worst Road that ever you travell'd in—You
seem uneasy, but sure you can∣not in Conscience be displeased that
I should take up <HI>Plain-Dealing</HI> just where you left it off—If
you are, to make you Amends, I promise never to imitate you in any Thing,
particularly your last Resolution of com∣mitting that dreadful Sin of
Matrimony—Believe me, Friend, the Man that signs Marriage Articles,
gives it under his Hand that he's a Fool."</Q></P>
<P>TO this I answered very gravely, That before I left off
<HI>Plain Dealing</HI> absolutely, I was resolved to give him one
Lesson which might be of use to him in his Practice. 
<Q REND="inline">"You are to remember, continued I, that he who
gives Advice, should always take Care to do it in such a Manner, that his
Advice may not appear to be an Insult upon the Character or Understanding
of the Person <PB N="497" REF="504"/> advised: <HI>Good Breeding</HI>
embellishes <HI>Good Sense</HI>; and <HI>True Politeness</HI> is no more
than <HI>civiliz'd Plain Dealing.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>BUT to pass by this volatile Spark, who if I divine aright, will
in every respect act like a modern fine Gentleman, that is, continue a
Batchelor till Sixty, to shew his <HI>Wit,</HI> and then marry his
House-Keeper, to shew his <HI>Judgment</HI>; let me return to the
Conversa∣tion which he interrupted, tho' I must take so much Notice of
his Opinion, that I pro∣mise my Readers if ever I appear again in Publick, I
shall amply and impartially con∣sider it, by which Time perhaps my own
Observations and Experience will better en∣able me to make a clear and
satisfactory Com∣ment upon it.</P>
<P>FAREWELL, then, Gentle Readers, be happy as I am shortly to be;
I have, on my part, endeavour'd to please; and you on yours have shewn
some Regard for my Endeavours: Till I can again attend you, I wish you
heartily a more agreeable Instructor; but think not my persuading you to
<HI>good Humour</HI> at Part∣ing, an Inconsistence in my Character; for
tho' I always abhorr'd Flattery, yet I never thought Truth the worse for
being agreeably dress'd: The common Forms of Civility, tho' they are often
the Disguises of Insincerity, are no Disgrace to an honest Heart, and
a good In∣tention. Where they are made use of to <HI>conceal</HI> our
Sentiments, they are wicked and abomi∣nable; <PB N="498" REF="505"/> where only
to <HI>adorn,</HI> innocent and agree∣able: At worst you ought only to
consider me as one, who without losing his Sincerity, is by degrees
ceasing to be</P>
