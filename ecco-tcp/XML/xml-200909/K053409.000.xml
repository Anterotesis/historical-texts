<HEAD>A TRACT ON THE LAW OF NATURE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE neither leisure nor abilities to undertake a regular definition of <HI>the Law of Nature,</HI> with all the doctrines usually ranked under that head: and indeed, if I had both leisure and abili∣ties, I should want inclination; because such a work would unavoidably become voluminous, on account of the variety of authors necessary to be mentioned, who have treated the subject with dif∣ferent views: and as all science is vain, which is not reduced to practice, so the more voluminous any subject is ren∣dered,
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
the less it can be useful, on ac∣count of the increased difficulty of com∣municating it to the generality of read∣ers. I have therefore confined my tract to such <HI>general</HI> remarks on the subject, as are most necessary for the observation of my countrymen at large, with respect (more particularly) to one point, viz. <HI>the Illegality</HI> of reducing or subjecting man∣kind to <HI>involuntary servitude,</HI> either under political or private dominion: as all pre∣tensions to an <HI>unlimited authority</HI> of any man or men over others, are con∣trary to <HI>Natural Equity</HI> and the <HI>Laws of God,</HI> as well as baneful to mankind in general; which effect is unhappily de∣monstrated by the numberless instances of <HI>unnatural</HI> oppression now prevailing to the destruction of mankind, in almost every part of the world. I have already shewn in my answer <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>This answer to Mr. Thompson is confined to one kind of slavery only, viz. <HI>the oppression of private tyrants,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>or petty slaveholders, and has already been printed <HI>in America;</HI> and therefore I need not now repeat the argu∣ments which it contains, especially as I propose soon to re∣print it in England with some other tracts expressly against <HI>domestick slavery,</HI> such as is <HI>unlawfully tolerated</HI> in the British colonies.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/></NOTE> to the Reverend
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Mr. Thompson (an advocate for the African slave trade) that the Jewish con∣stitutions were not strictly consistent <HI>with the Law of Nature in all points;</HI> and, consequently, that they are not to be considered as the rule by which law∣yers and casuists may safely determine <HI>"what is, or what is not, according to Nature."</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Law of Nature</HI> has been variously represented; but all the best writers, both ancient and modern, agree in adopt∣ing that maxim of the Civil Insti∣tutes <NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Servitus</HI> autem est constitutio Juris Gentium qua quis dominio alieno <HI>contra naturam</HI> subjicitur." Justin. Institutes, Book 1. Tit. 3.</P>
<P>From whence the other authorities in the <HI>Common Law</HI> of England seem to be derived.</P>
<P>§ 2. Est quidem <HI>Servitus</HI> constitutio Juris Gentium qua quis dominio alieno <HI>contra naturam</HI> subjicitur," &amp;c.
<BIBL>BRACTON, Lib. 1. Cap. 6.</BIBL></P>
<P>"Est quidem <HI>Servitus libertati contrarium;</HI> item con∣stitutio quaedam de Jure Gentium, qua quis dominio alieno <HI>contra naturam</HI> subjicitur," &amp;c.
<BIBL>FLETA, Lib. 1. Cap. 3.</BIBL></P>
<P>"<HI>Servitude</HI> is a constitution of the Law of Nations, by which, <HI>contrary to Nature,</HI> one is subjected to another's power."
<BIBL>COWELL'S Institutes, Tit. 3.</BIBL></P></NOTE>, which declares <HI>involuntary ser∣vitude,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
or <HI>slavery, to be "contrary to the Law of Nature:"</HI> this rule is commonly understood as applicable only to <HI>domestic slavery;</HI> but it is equally true when ap∣plied to <HI>political oppression,</HI> or the exer∣cise of an <HI>unlimited dominion</HI> over a whole nation. Some few authors indeed have been so unreasonable, as to assert that <HI>"there is no such thing as natural Law;"</HI> but they are properly censured by the learned Baron Puffendorf, in his "Law of Nature and Nations." Book 2. Chap. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>He particularly mentions the argu∣ment of Carniades as contracted by Lac∣tantius to the following effect.</P>
<P>"That men first instituted Laws to secure and promote their own advantage, &amp;c. but that there was no such thing as <HI>Natural Law</HI> in the world," &amp;c. p. 104.</P>
<P>Such doctrine is certainly very con∣venient for Tyrants and Slaveholders of every degree, who must otherwise re∣main without excuse, whenever <HI>"the Law of Nature,"</HI> and <HI>"the Common Rights of Humanity,"</HI> are urged against them: it is therefore necessary for them, either to misrepresent <HI>the Law of Nature</HI> (as the Reverend Mr. Thompson has done), or else (like Carniades) utterly to deny its existence. This latter method has been also adopted by some modern advocates for <HI>Slavery,</HI> who, in private discourse on this subject, have declared, that they esteem <HI>"the Law of Nature"</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
to be no other than their <HI>natural</HI> pro∣pensity to pursue their own heart's desire of profit or pleasure: and this they call <HI>"natural Liberty;"</HI> though it certainly is the most <HI>unnatural Tyranny:</HI> for when the immutable necessity of <HI>reciprocal con∣sideration</HI> is forgot, or set aside, there can be no safety among men, and con∣sequently no <HI>natural Liberty:</HI> we must, therefore, submit ourselves to be <HI>the ser∣vants of law,</HI> in order to be truly <HI>free;</HI> according to the excellent observation of Cicero. "Legum denique idcirco om∣nes <HI>Servi</HI> sumus, ut <HI>liberi</HI> esse possumus." Tom. 2. p. 208. <NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">Hamburgh Edition 1618.</NOTE>. We may learn from the histories of all nations, that Lust, Ava∣rice, Pride, Revenge, Love of Power, Jea∣lousy, &amp;c. are <HI>Principles of Action,</HI> which unavoidably produce <HI>oppression</HI> and <HI>wrongs,</HI> to the destruction of the human species, in all places where <HI>will</HI> and <HI>pleasure</HI> (whether in political or private domi∣nion)
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<HI>are supreme;</HI> or whenever <HI>Self-love</HI> and <HI>Private Interest</HI> become entirely predominant among men. That <HI>Self-love</HI> is predominant with the <HI>generality of mankind</HI> is but too apparent; yet we are not, therefore, obliged to admit that <HI>"Self-love" is "the universal principle of action;"</HI> though an eminent and learn∣ed <HI>law-writer</HI> has (with very good in∣tentions, as his argument proves) thought proper to give it that title.</P>
<P><HI>"Honesty</HI> (indeed) <HI>is the best policy,"</HI> even for a <HI>selfish man</HI> to pursue; and, it is certain, that the solid attainments of virtue and justice afford a real and sub∣stantial satisfaction, which in the end, most amply fulfils the purposes of <HI>Self-love.</HI></P>
<P>But though <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Honesty</HI> are thus favourable to <HI>Self-love</HI> in their <HI>natural effects,</HI> yet this, by no means, proves that
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<HI>Self-love</HI> is the <HI>motive</HI> of all <HI>virtuous</HI> and <HI>honest</HI> men; or that it is the <HI>"universal principle of action:"</HI> for, if that were really the case, many of the most amiable virtues must be esteemed mere empty names. There could be no true Gene∣rosity or Benevolence; no Disinterested Goodness of heart; no sincere <HI>Natural Affection</HI> between parents and their chil∣dren, husbands and their wives, brethren, friends, &amp;c. whereas history affords many undoubted instances of <HI>Self-love</HI> being lost in <HI>the superior affections, natural to generous minds,</HI> in all these different de∣grees of connection; but it is needless to recite them, since, even in the brute creation there are <HI>natural</HI> <NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><P>That excellent English lawyer the Great Henry de Bracton informs us, that <HI>"Natural Law</HI> is that which <HI>Nature</HI> (or more properly God himself) has <HI>taught all animals."</HI> "Jus <HI>Naturale</HI> est quod <HI>Natura,</HI> i. e. ipse Deus, docuit
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>omnia animalia," &amp;c. and afterwards he fur∣ther explains himself, saying, "Jus Naturale quod docuit omnia animalia Natura, i. e. per instinctum Naturae, &amp;c. viz. Natural Law, which taught all animals by <HI>Nature</HI> that is, through the instinct of Nature," &amp;c. Lib. 1. c. 5.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/></NOTE> <HI>affections</HI> superior to <HI>Self-love.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>The common hen is so inflamed with <HI>Natural Affection,</HI> and anxious care for her tender brood, that she seems to have as little sense of <HI>Self-love</HI> in time of danger, as of her own weakness; for she will boldly fly in the face of every invader (except man) however superior in size or strength to herself.</P>
<P>The timorous cow, it is said, will attack the fiercest tyger, when her calf is by her side. Many instances of very extraordinary <HI>Affection</HI> in dogs to their masters have been well attested. Those faithful animals have sometimes been known to lose all sense of danger to themselves in the necessary defence of their owners. And the very swine dis∣cover such a <HI>Natural Affection</HI> and real sympathy for their brethren of the sty,
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
whenever they hear their cries of distress, that their example ought to shame the depraved part of mankind (imperial ty∣rants and royal robbers, who extend their dominion by breach of faith, un∣lawful invasion, murder and rapine, as also those petty tyrants and destroyers of mankind the African traders, and Ame∣rican slaveholders) lest the <HI>affectionate brute,</HI> notwithstanding his <HI>sensuality,</HI> should seem, on comparison, <HI>a more ge∣nerous,</HI> and therefore a more <HI>noble animal</HI> than that <HI>Man,</HI> who stifles all <HI>Natural Affection,</HI> Fellow-feeling, and Charity to <HI>his kind,</HI> merely for the sake of acquiring power, or worldly profit to himself; and surely a time will come, when all such offenders against <HI>the Law of Nature</HI> (who prefer the wages of unrighteous∣ness to the <HI>natural</HI> dictates of <HI>Humanity</HI> and <HI>Conscience</HI>) will have reason to esteem the lot of the most contemptible <HI>brute</HI> infinitely more eligible than their own!</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13"/>Now, as it appears that <HI>"Self-love"</HI> is not the <HI>"universal Principle of Action"</HI> even in <HI>brutes,</HI> much less ought it to be esteemed so in <HI>mankind,</HI> because the <HI>human soul</HI> (besides the <HI>Natural Affection</HI> which men ought to have in common with other creatures) is endowed with a much more noble principle, or motive to good actions, I mean <HI>Reason,</HI> or that <HI>"Knowledge of good and evil,"</HI> which we inherit from our first parents, and which they <HI>unlawfully</HI> took upon themselves, at the instigation of their <HI>spiritual enemy,</HI> that they might thereby be rendered <HI>accountable for all their actions,</HI> and, through <HI>Knowledge</HI> <NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot"><P>"But of the tree of <HI>Knowledge</HI> of <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil</HI> thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." Gen. ii. 17.</P></NOTE>, become guilty before God!</P>
<P>The history of that fatal transaction demands our most careful consideration, since all mankind are particularly affected
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
by it! And surely the principles of <HI>our own Nature</HI> are subjects of enquiry infi∣nitely more important to us, than all the other branches of <HI>natural Philosophy;</HI> and yet perhaps they are less examined by men of science, and consequently are less understood, than any other! but in vain is the most accurate knowledge of plants, drugs, fossils, and minerals; or of the exact revolutions of the heavenly bodies, and of the nature and properties of all the elements, &amp;c. if the philoso∣pher is <HI>unacquainted with himself</HI> <NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot"><P>— Multi enim multa sciunt, <HI>et scipsos nesciunt:</HI> sed qui <HI>seipsum nescit nihil b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne novit,</HI> quàm alia scire et se nescire, quid aliud est quam seipsum gravius condempnare, &amp;c. Doct. &amp; Stud. c. 13.</P></NOTE>, and the properties and state of his own soul, which is too often the case! Knowledge, in all the former particulars, is indeed honourable and praise-worthy, but, in the latter, it is indispensable; for when men, through ignorance of the <HI>compouna Nature</HI> of man, slight the common means,
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
which God has revealed, to guard their minds against <HI>intellectual deceptions,</HI> they are sure to be perverted <HI>in their princi∣ples,</HI> to the imminent danger both of body and soul! Such an one, probably, thinks himself <HI>too judicious</HI> a critic to admit the Mosaic account of the subject now before us, viz. <HI>the Fall of Man;</HI> at least in the <HI>literal</HI> sense of the text: so that the doctrines, which I propose to collect from it, will have very little weight, I fear, with men of that stamp. Never∣theless, as there are many doctrines in other parts of Scripture, which corro∣borate the <HI>literal</HI> meaning of that rela∣tion, and as there are also several cir∣cumstances discoverable in the <HI>Nature of Man,</HI> which cannot otherwise be rea∣sonably accounted for, I must beg my readers to excuse me, even if they think me too prolix in my examination of that part of the sacred history, which I con∣ceive to be absolutely necessary for the
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
obtaining a true practical idea of the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Principles of Action in Man.</HI></P>
<P>God delivered a clear and express Law to <HI>Man</HI> before the fall;—<Q>but of the tree of <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil, thou shalt not eat of it:</HI></Q> and then fol∣lows the denunciation of punishment;—<Q>for <HI>in the day</HI> that thou eatest thereof, <HI>thou shalt surely</HI> DIE. <BIBL>Gen. ii. 17.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This was the <HI>first and only penal Law;</HI> A FORFEITURE OF LIFE! And though we find afterwards, that the declared punishment was not immediately exe∣cuted according to the letter (that is, the penalty of <HI>death</HI> was not inflicted on <HI>the day</HI> of the transgression, as it seemed to be at first ordained) yet this affords no just exception against the truth and pro∣priety of the relation.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17"/>The same ALMIGHTY BEING, who had <HI>a right</HI> (as all things are his own) to prohibit the action above-mentioned, and to assign a punishment for disobe∣dience, had certainly <HI>a right</HI> also to re∣spite, or postpone, or even to remit (if he had been pleased to do so) the exe∣cution of <HI>the Law</HI> which he himself had ordained. But for the present it is sufficient to remark, that the <HI>nature of the penalty</HI> had been clearly revealed to our first parents, and was as clearly un∣derstood by them, so that they were sufficiently sensible of their obligation to observe the said <HI>Law,</HI> previous to their breach of it: which plainly appears by the speech of the woman to the tempter, viz. <Q>But of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden, GOD <HI>hath said,</HI> ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, <HI>lest ye die.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18"/>After so clear an acknowledgment of the <HI>divine</HI> precept, the act of taking the fruit (which otherwise in itself would, probably, have been no crime) was cer∣tainly a <HI>wilful sin</HI> of a very heinous na∣ture, being a <HI>gross contempt of God's word,</HI> for which our first parents very justly incurred the <HI>penalty of death,</HI> which, they were previously told, must be the consequence of disobedience.</P>
<P>They had received this caution even <HI>from God himself,</HI> whom they knew to be their Maker and Supreme Lord; and yet the unwary woman unhappily listened to an assertion, that was absolutely contra∣dictory to her <HI>Creator's word,</HI> and there∣by drew upon herself, and all her de∣scendants, the irrevocable doom to <HI>la∣bour!—pain!</HI>—and <HI>mortality!</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps the haughty philosopher will now be ready to arraign the justice of
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
the divine decree, which involved the innocent progeny (that is, innocent with respect to this particular crime) in the punishment of their <HI>guilty parents;</HI> but if he will patiently follow me through this examination of <HI>Human Na∣ture,</HI> he will, perhaps, be able to form a better idea of the <HI>Nature of original Sin,</HI> and of the cause of its being in∣tailed (or rather <HI>the effects</HI> of its being <HI>intailed</HI>) on all the descendants of Adam. For the immediate <HI>effect</HI> of that <HI>original Sin</HI> of our first parents, was the acqui∣sition of <HI>an additional faculty</HI> (even of a divine attribute) to the <HI>Nature of Man,</HI> which of course descends from these original stocks by <HI>natural inheritance</HI> to all their progeny, and thereby inevitably <HI>involves them all</HI> in the same condem∣nation; the manner of which shall be more particularly explained hereafter. This very ancient example of punish∣ment for a <HI>contempt of God's word</HI> (the
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
direful effects of which, <HI>labour, pain,</HI> and <HI>mortality,</HI> are ever before us) should teach mankind the extreme danger of paying attention to any doctrines and interpretations of Law or Religion, that have the least tendency to oppose or con∣tradict the literal or most obvious mean∣ing of God's word; for the efforts of our <HI>spiritual Enemy</HI> are never more bane∣ful, than when he is pleased to assume the office of a commentator on the Laws of God; in which character he is fre∣quently discoverable; for though he does not now present himself <HI>outwardly</HI> or <HI>ap∣parently,</HI> as at first, in the assumed shape of a serpent, yet the venom of his doctrines is too often sufficiently distinguishable, both in the writings and discourses of men! And it is remarkable, that his first attempt against mankind should be in the capacity of a <HI>critick</HI> on the <HI>Divine Law!</HI> The influence of <HI>spiritual enemies</HI> is indeed a distinct <HI>Principle of Action in
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
Man,</HI> which shall be more particularly mentioned in the course of this Tract.</P>
<P>But to return to the first fatal in∣stance, before-mentioned, of Satan's suc∣cess, in misleading mankind, <HI>which</HI> oc∣casioned another distinct <HI>Principle of Action in Man.</HI></P>
<P>It appears that the Tempter was well well acquainted with the true nature and effects of the forbidden fruit, which he declared, indeed, but not without utter∣ing, at the same time, a notorious false∣hood. <Q>Ye <HI>shall not surely die</HI> (said he) for God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof</Q> (viz. of the fruit taken from the tree of knowledge) <Q>then your eyes shall be opened: and <HI>ye shall be as gods, knowing Good and Evil.</HI> <BIBL>Gen. iii. 4, 5.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22"/>Now this acquisition of <HI>Knowledge,</HI> which the Tempter promised, was really such as he represented it, viz. a <HI>Divine Attribute</HI> ("Ye shall become <HI>as gods, knowing Good and Evil;</HI>" so that, in this one respect, indeed, his intelligence was <HI>true:</HI> for the inspired historian has re∣corded also the words of God himself to the same effect:—<Q>And the Lord God said, Behold, the man <HI>is become</HI> AS ONE OF US, <HI>to know Good and Evil.</HI> <BIBL>(Chap. iii. 22.)</BIBL></Q> But <HI>truth</HI> is much more deceitful and dangerous, even than <HI>falsehood itself,</HI> when, for the purpose of misleading, it is maliciously blended with the latter; for notwithstanding the Deceiver's flattering assurance to our first parents, that <HI>they should "not die;"</HI> yet <HI>in the very day</HI> (as it seems) <HI>of their transgression,</HI> they heard the tremendous sentence of <HI>misery</HI> and <HI>death</HI> pronounced against them! and though it was not <HI>then</HI> finally executed, as they had reason
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
to expect it would, according to the tenor of the Law before declared, on which the judgment was founded, (for God never judges men <HI>without Law,</HI> like the arbitrary princes of this world) yet the said <HI>Law,</HI> by which their lives were expressly forfeited, was sufficiently ful∣filled <HI>by the condemnation</HI> of the trans∣gressors (on the <HI>very day</HI> of their offence) to <HI>mortality;</HI> whereby their once <HI>immor∣tal</HI> bodies were rendered continually liable to <HI>diseases, injuries, misery,</HI> and <HI>death,</HI> as the bodies of all their descen∣dants have ever since been! and they were no longer entitled even to the food necessary for the support of their poor <HI>mortal</HI> bodies, without severe <HI>labour, care,</HI> and <HI>assiduity!</HI> —<Q>Cursed is the ground for thy sake; <HI>in sorrow</HI> <NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>In sorrow</HI> (or rather <HI>in labour</HI>) for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is the ex∣pression in the original; which, in the Targum, is explained by another Hebrew word (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) signifying rather <HI>fatigue</HI> or <HI>labour,</HI> than <HI>sorrow;</HI> and as the necessity of man's <HI>labour</HI> was
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>the more immediate consequence of the earth's new pro∣pensity, through the curse, to bring forth thorns, thistles, and useless weeds, it seems the most <HI>expressive</HI> rendering in this place, and most suitable to the context in the follow∣ing verse: <HI>"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread."</HI> In the Vulgate also it is rendered, <HI>"in laboribus;"</HI> and by Pagninus, <HI>"in labore."</HI> The <HI>same word</HI> is also neces∣cessarily rendered <HI>"Labours"</HI> in Isaiah lviii. 3. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> "and <HI>exact all your labours;</HI> and in Proverbs v. 10. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> "Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth, <HI>and</HI> THY LABOURS <HI>be in the house of a stranger.</HI>"</P>
<PB N="21" REF="23"/></NOTE>
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee: and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.—In the sweat of thy face</Q> (said God to his guilty creature man) <Q>shalt thou eat bread, <HI>till thou return unto the ground:</HI> for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return. <BIBL>(Gen. iii. 17, to 19.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>These have ever since been the condi∣tions of human life; and though some men, who have store of worldly goods, endeavour to cast away care, and seem to
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
live in a state of opposition to this gene∣ral rule, yet they only deceive them∣selves; for no descendant of Adam, be he ever so rich, has any right <HI>to eat the bread of idleness;</HI> nor can he do so with∣out offence against <HI>his own soul,</HI> as well as against this universal ordinance of God.—If Providence has afforded him <HI>wealth</HI> and <HI>leisure,</HI> he is accountable <HI>for both;</HI> being only a steward <HI>for life;</HI> after which, the performance of his duty to God, to his country, to <HI>his neighbours,</HI> nay, to <HI>mankind in general,</HI> his <HI>brethren of the universe,</HI> will be strictly scruti∣nized, and punished in proportion to the degree of his <HI>wilful</HI> neglect and disobe∣dience; since nothing is more clearly revealed, than that <HI>all mankind</HI> lie under an indispensable obligation <HI>to improve</HI> their talents for <HI>all these duties,</HI> as well as to <HI>use</HI> them whenever there is an op∣portunity; so that the man who neg∣lects to employ, in these services, a due
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
portion of that <HI>leisure,</HI> which his rank, or situation in life affords him, may justly be said to mispend his <HI>Master's time,</HI> for it is <HI>not his own:</HI> and such an one must inevitably suffer with the <HI>"unprofitable servant,"</HI> described in the Gospel, who neglected to <HI>improve</HI> his <HI>talent;</HI>—<Q>Cast ye the <HI>unprofitable ser∣vant</HI> into outer darkness!—There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <BIBL>Matt. xxv. 30.</BIBL></Q> See the whole parable from the 14th verse, whereby it plainly appears, that mankind are laid under an indispensable necessity to im∣prove their respective <HI>natural talents,</HI> to the best of their power, for their <HI>Lord's service.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>affluence,</HI> and <HI>unemployed leisure,</HI> therefore, of many persons, whom we daily see amongst us, afford no just ex∣ception to God's general ordinance con∣cerning the hard conditions of human
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>

It is almost too obvious to be mentioned, that riches and hereditary honours procure no exemption from the most material part of that sentence, viz. <HI>"to dust thou shalt return!"</HI> And that the time and manner of that <HI>returning</HI> to the <HI>dust,</HI> or to the <HI>ground,</HI> is <HI>equally unknown</HI> to the rich and to the poor, though to both <HI>equally certain:</HI> so that no man, not the greatest or most inde∣pendent, can claim even a single day before-hand as his own: <Q>I will say to my soul</Q> <HI>(saith the rich man in the pa∣rable)</HI> <Q>Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years: take thine ease, eat, drink and be merry.

men, who think themselves exempted, by their rank and fortunes, from the <HI>necessity</HI> of employment; who think they have a right to <HI>spend their time,</HI> as well as <HI>their money,</HI> just as they please, for their own amusement and mere self-sa∣tisfaction; and seem to enjoy <HI>leisure</HI> and <HI>ease,</HI> as if God's general ordinance to all mankind had been partial, or of none effect! Let such men, I say, be reminded of the alarming dreadful sentence pro∣nounced by "the <HI>Lord of the vineyard</HI>" in the parable. <Q>Behold, these three years I come <HI>seeking fruit</HI> on this fig-tree, and <HI>find none:</HI> cut it down, <HI>why cumbereth it the ground</HI> <NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot">Luke xiii. 7.</NOTE>?</Q> How ab∣surd therefore is <HI>the pride</HI> of those men, who value themselves on account of <HI>ter∣ritorial</HI> authority (whether publick or private) and yet live as if the importance, which they assume in right of <HI>landed pos∣sessions,</HI> or <HI>hereditary rank in life,</HI> might of

They are not compelled by necessity, like other men, to think for themselves; and
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
from thence a fatal, inconsiderate notion is too apt to prevail among them, viz. that <HI>their time is their own;</HI> and there∣fore, as they presume upon a supposed right to spend their <HI>leisure,</HI> according to their own <HI>Will and Pleasure,</HI> they neces∣sarily mispend their <HI>substance</HI> also, for which they are <HI>equally accountable;</HI> and as riches are also the ordinary means of procuring the sweets and enjoyments of life, they are, consequently, a continual source of temptation, as well to acquire them <HI>unjustly,</HI> as to expend them <HI>impro∣perly.</HI> From hence, probably, arises the extreme danger of <HI>riches</HI> to the spiritual welfare of mankind! <Q>Verily I say unto you (said our Lord) that <HI>a rich man</HI> shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

<P>Our <HI>spiritual Enemy</HI> envied the hap∣piness of mankind in their original state; and, therefore, artfully led them to the criminal usurpation of <HI>forbidden Know∣ledge,</HI> that they might, thereby, be ren∣dered accountable to THE ETERNAL JUDGE for all their thoughts, words, and actions; and, <HI>through Knowledge,</HI> be∣come

<P>The Gentiles, without the knowledge of Scripture, nevertheless acknowledged this principle. "Law" (according to Cicero) <Q>is a <HI>supreme Reason</HI> planted in

<P>Here the enlightened Heathen writer plainly acknowledges the <HI>Principle</HI> as <HI>natural to Mankind</HI> (—<Q>Ratio summa, <HI>insita in Naturâ</HI></Q>) and yet esteemed it, at the same time, <HI>a divine Attribute,</HI> by some means imparted from GOD (—<Q>recta, et <HI>a numine Deorum tracta</HI> Ratio</Q>) though he might probably be
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
unacquainted with the occasion of its being engraffed in Human Nature. He mentions this Attribute again, in his second Book <HI>de Natura Deorum,</HI> where he speaks of Prudence, or the <HI>choice of Good, and rejection of Evil,</HI> <Q>as a <HI>univer∣sal Law</HI> common to God <HI>and Man.</HI></Q></P>

<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
forms an unexceptionable <HI>Rule of Action,</HI> viz. that Reason must rule, but Appetite obey. See his own words: <Q>Duplex est enim vis animorum, atque naturae: una pars in <HI>appetitu</HI> posita est, quae est <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Graecè, quae hominem huc, et illuc rapit: altera <HI>in ratione</HI> quae docet, et explanat, quid <HI>faciendum, fugiendumque sit.</HI> Ita fit, ut <HI>Ratio</HI> praesit, <HI>Appetitus</HI> vero obtemperet. <BIBL>Tom. 4. p. 248.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>He also clearly describes this natural instinct, <Q>the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</Q> under the title of Common Sense, <HI>"Communis Intelligentia,"</HI> and lays it down as the <HI>Law,</HI> or <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Nature ("Naturae Norma")</HI> for distinguishing <HI>good Laws</HI> <NOTE N="(14)" PLACE="foot">What a profitable and convenient reduction might be made in the bulk and number of our <HI>Statute Books,</HI> (especially of the later volumes) upon a revisal conducted strictly according to this excellent rule!</NOTE> from bad, <HI>right</HI> from <HI>wrong,</HI> and <HI>honourable</HI> from <HI>base,</HI> which

<P>He informs us, that some men, who had not the written Law of God, were,
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
nevertheless, capable of doing <HI>by Nature</HI> (or Instinct) the things contained in the Law—<Q>For when the Gentiles, which have not the Law, do <HI>by Nature</HI> the things contained in the Law, these, <HI>having not the Law, are a Law unto themselves</HI> <NOTE N="(16)" PLACE="foot"><P>We find a remarkable instance of the <Q>Natural Dictates of Conscience,</Q> in the behaviour of <Q>Tubourai Tamaide,</Q> (a poor uninstructed inhabitant of the re∣mote island of Otaheite) when he was unjustly charged with stealing a knife. The story is related in the account of Capt. Cook's voyage (Vol. 2. p. 101.) and the singularity of the circumstances leads the writer to the following remark: <Q>Upon this occasion it may be observed</Q> (says he) <Q>that these people have a <HI>Knowledge</HI> of RIGHT and WRONG from the mere dictates of <HI>Natural Con∣science;</HI> and voluntarily condemn themselves when they do that to others, which they would condemn others for doing to them.

<P>This necessarily implies a <HI>natural Knowledge of</HI> GOOD <HI>and</HI> EVIL, so that this <HI>divine faculty,</HI> or instinct in <HI>the Na∣ture of Man,</HI> seems plainly to be the grand <HI>Principle,</HI> whereby men, <HI>who have</HI> <Q>not the Law, are a Law unto them∣selves. <BIBL>(Rom. ii. 14.)</BIBL></Q> And this I ap∣prehend to be, properly, <Q>THE LAW OF NATURE</Q> <HI>in</HI> MAN, <HI>the Law written on our hearts,</HI> or the <HI>Conscience,</HI> which bears witness with us, as the Apostle declares

in the following verse:—Our <Q>thoughts the mean while <HI>accusing,</HI> or else <HI>ex∣cusing us;</HI></Q>—for there are few men so bad, as not to have been, at some time or other, sensible of remorse, through the accusation above-mentioned of <HI>their their thoughts,</HI> or <HI>Conscience.</HI> For what are these <HI>thoughts</HI> which <HI>accuse</HI> and <HI>excuse,</HI> but <HI>Conscience</HI> itself; that is, the very same <HI>Principle,</HI> only differently expressed by the Apostle, for the sake of explana∣tion?

That our first parents received from God, when they were first created, a due proportion of <HI>Reason</HI> suited to their original condition, is not to be doubted; but there is no authority whatever to warrant the supposition of their being at first indued with that <HI>Perfection of Reason,</HI> that Attribute of a <HI>Divine and Spiritual Nature,</HI> which afterwards became <HI>natural</HI> to Man; though the worthy author apparently means this supreme degree of <HI>Reason,</HI> when he tells us, that Man, by the gift of Reason, is <Q><HI>made like to the dignity of angels</HI> <NOTE N="(20)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>—per quam etiam <HI>Angelicam imitatur dignitatem</HI> à falso discernendo verum, et à bono malum.

<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
very plainly from the Scriptures, that this Perfection of Reason was afterwards acquired by unlawfully eating the fruit of <HI>the Tree of Knowledge;</HI> for it is plain, that the desire of <HI>acquiring Knowledge</HI> was part of the temptation to trangress: ("a <HI>tree to be desired to make one wise,</HI>" said the deluded Woman) and it was not until they had both of them eaten the forbidden fruit, that God said, <Q>Be∣hold, the Man <HI>is become</HI> AS ONE OF US, to <HI>know Good and Evil;</HI> <BIBL>(Gen. iii. 22.)</BIBL></Q> thereby plainly alluding to the <HI>Knowledge then newly acquired</HI> by the for∣bidden fruit; and they were driven out of the garden, we are expressly told, to prevent a further <HI>acquisition</HI> to the Na∣ture of Man, viz. <Q>lest <HI>he put forth his hand, and</HI> take (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) ALSO of the tree of Life, and eat and live for ever;</Q> and therefore it is certain, that Man was not enlightened by the Divine <HI>Law of Reason</HI> within himself, when he was <HI>first

purpose of <HI>"the Knowledge of Good and Evil,"</HI> viz. that we should use it <Q>as a light to discern what we <HI>ought to do,</HI> or <HI>ought not</HI> to do;</Q> or, in Scripture words, that we <Q>may <HI>know</HI> to refuse the Evil, and choose the Good. <BIBL>Isa. vii. 15.</BIBL></Q> and again in the 16th verse.</P>
<P>From what has been said, it must ap∣pear, that <HI>Conscience, Reason,</HI> and <HI>Sinde∣resis,</HI> though sometimes treated as <HI>distinct Principles,</HI> are nevertheless essentially founded on one <HI>Great Principle,</HI> viz. the <HI>Divine Knowledge of</HI> GOOD <HI>and</HI> EVIL; and when our first parents, contrary to the commands of God, took <HI>that Know∣ledge</HI> upon themselves, the immediate effects of it were the most pungent work∣ings of <HI>Conscience!</HI> They were <HI>conscious</HI> of their disobedience to God! <HI>Conscious</HI> of their shame and nakedness! <HI>Conscious</HI> that the Divine Justice must pursue them, so that they would have even hid

<P>Men seldom fall indeed into any very gross <HI>offence</HI> against the <HI>Eternal Law,</HI> till they are <HI>initiated,</HI> as it were, by lesser crimes; and have gradually stifled the natural restraint of the <HI>innate Knowledge</HI> or <HI>Conscience</HI> before described; and then they are no longer worthy to be called <HI>Men,</HI> being more properly <HI>Brutes;</HI> be∣cause

<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
our conclusions concerning the <HI>Nature of Man</HI> from that depraved state of <HI>Hu∣man Nature,</HI> wherein the proper and <HI>natural distinction</HI> of <HI>Manhood (the</HI> KNOW∣LEDGE <HI>of</HI> GOOD <HI>and</HI> EVIL, which we <HI>naturally</HI> inherit from our first parents) has lost its influence!</P>
<P>No MAN, indeed, is <HI>perfect; neither are</HI> ALL MEN <HI>depraved;</HI> and though the <HI>depraved</HI> state of man may, perhaps, be <HI>most general,</HI> it, certainly, is not <HI>uni∣versal;</HI> and therefore <Q>the universal Principle of Action in Man</Q> is not to be drawn from thence. But it will be still much more profitable for us to re∣member (when any <HI>Rule of Obedience</HI> is proposed as an <HI>universal Principle of Action</HI>) that it is not so much our business or interest to trace out what REALLY IS <HI>"the universal Principle of Action,"</HI> as what it OUGHT TO BE. I have already produced the testimony of the most
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
learned and able lawyer among the Hea∣thens, that <Q>the Knowledge of Good and Evil</Q> is an <HI>universal Principle, natural</HI> to mankind; and he so far esteems it as <HI>"a Rule of Obedience,"</HI> that he lays it down as the foundation of <HI>Law.</HI> <Q>For Law (says he again in another place) is nothing else but <HI>right and divinely inspired Reason, commanding what is ho∣nest,</HI> and <HI>forbidding the contrary</HI></Q> <NOTE N="(27)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Est enim <HI>Lex</HI> nihil aliud, nisi RECTA et à <HI>nu∣mine Deorum tracta</HI> RATIO imperans honesta, prohi∣bens contraria. <BIBL>(Oratio Philippica 11. Vol. 2. p. 487.)</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE>. But a modern, though very learned and respectable, law commentator, has re∣ferred us to a different Principle, as a <HI>"Rule of Obedience,"</HI> which is very liable to be misunderstood: he informs us in page 41, vol. 1. that the Creator <Q>has graciously reduced the Rule of Obe∣dience to this <HI>one paternal Precept,— That Man should pursue his own Hap∣piness.</HI></Q> "This," (says he) <Q>is the
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
foundation of what we call Ethics, or natural Law.</Q> Yet, in justice to the worthy author, it must be allowed, that the Happiness, which he speaks of, is not <HI>selfish, partial,</HI> or <HI>sensual Happiness</HI> (for that would be a very improper sub∣ject for a <HI>"paternal Precept"</HI>) but <Q>real Happiness,</Q> <HI>and</HI> <Q>substantial Happi∣ness,</Q> as he further expresses himself in the same page; and no Happiness can be <HI>"real,"</HI> or <HI>"substantial,"</HI> which is not lasting; so that it is plain this emi∣nent writer means that <HI>lasting</HI> and <Q>sub∣stantial Happiness</Q> alone, which arises from Obedience to the will of God: for the Knowledge of which he refers us, at the same time, to the Holy Scriptures. See the following page 42.</P>
<P>Yet even such <HI>"substantial Happiness"</HI> can only be called an <HI>effect,</HI> of which a conscientious Obedience to the will of God is <HI>one of the causes;</HI> but the <HI>primary
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
cause, or motive</HI> to that Obedience in <HI>good Men,</HI> is still different from both; and yet none of them can be the <HI>proper foun∣dation</HI> of Ethics, or <HI>natural Law.</HI></P>
<P>The learned author has himself as∣signed a more probable foundation in the preceding page, to which perhaps he might mean to refer by the prono∣minal adjective <HI>"This,"</HI> in the sentence which immediately follows his <Q>one paternal Precept,</Q> (viz. <Q><HI>This</HI> is the foundation of what we call Ethics, or natural Law</Q>) for he observes in p. 40. that, <Q>CONSIDERING the Creator only as a Being of infinite <HI>Power,</HI> he was able unquestionably to have pre∣scribed whatever Laws he pleased to his creature Man, however unjust or severe. But as he is also a Being of infinite <HI>Wisdom,</HI> he has laid down only such Laws as were <HI>founded</HI> in <HI>those relations of Justice</HI> that existed in the nature of things, antecedent to
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
any positive Precept.—THOSE RE∣LATIONS of JUSTICE,</Q> then, on which the <HI>other Laws are founded,</HI> are properly THE FOUNDATION. And "these" (the learned writer himself tells us in the following sentence) <Q><HI>are the eternal, immutable</HI> LAWS <HI>of</HI> GOOD <HI>and</HI> EVIL, to which the Creator him∣self, in all his dispensations, conforms; and which he has enabled <HI>Human Reason</HI> to discover, so far as they are necessary for the conduct of human actions.</Q> Thus THE FOUNDATION is clearly laid down, and there is no oc∣casion to assign any other <HI>Motive of Obe∣dience</HI> to the several Laws on <HI>this Foun∣dation,</HI> than what is mentioned in the same sentence, viz. <HI>Human Reason,</HI> by which men are enabled to discover <Q>these eternal and immutable Laws of <HI>Good and Evil.</HI></Q> For <HI>the Knowledge</HI> of what <HI>is Good,</HI> or what <HI>is Evil,</HI> is surely a sufficient Motive for <HI>chusing</HI> the one, and <HI>rejecting</HI> the other; because
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
<HI>Good,</HI> when known, is as truly amiable in itself, as <HI>Evil</HI> is detestable and fright∣ful; so that the former most naturally engages our preference, without any other Motive than this <HI>natural Knowledge</HI> of their respective qualities.</P>
<P>Sinister Motives do, nevertheless, too frequently prevail, through the extreme frailty of <HI>Human Nature,</HI> which engages the greater part of mankind in the pur∣suit of temporal Interest, or partial and sensual Happiness!</P>
<P>So that, if the learned commentator had mentioned <HI>Self-love,</HI> as the <HI>general,</HI> instead of the <Q>universal Principle of Action,</Q> I should not have thought myself obliged to have taken particular notice of that part of his work.</P>
<P>Several reasons may be assigned why it cannot be admitted as the <Q>universal Principle of Action.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="64"/>And, first, Because the most worthy actions, as I have already observed, are frequently occasioned by a more generous motive than <HI>Self-love.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Because <HI>bad</HI> men are some∣times prompted to <HI>good</HI> actions, through the influence of their own <HI>natural Know∣ledge of Good and Evil,</HI> when the occa∣sion happens not to interfere with their particular views of private Interest, or their predominant Passions <NOTE N="(28)" PLACE="foot"><P>A more remarkable instance of this perhaps was never known, than what my own grandfather experienced in his acquaintance with the <HI>Lord Chancellor Jefferies,</HI> who was, perhaps, the most abandoned time-server of those days (if we except his companion in iniquity, <HI>Ge∣neral Kirk</HI> <NOTE N="(29)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>It would not have been possible</Q> (says Rapin, speaking of Chancellor Jefferies <HI>and</HI> General Kirk) "for him" <HI>(King James the IId.)</HI> <Q>to have found in the kingdom two men more void of all Religion, of all Honour, aad all Humanity. They were two tigers chafed with blood, who had no pleasure but in carnage. <BIBL>Tom. 10. p. 30.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE>. <HI>Dr. Sharp</HI> was as totally different and
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>opposite to the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> in every part of his character, as it was possible for any man to be; yet the <HI>Chancellor</HI> entertained a very particular regard and esteem for him. He treated the Doctor very roughly indeed, when he had received his Royal Master's orders to prosecute him for <HI>preaching against Popery;</HI> but in every other point, which did not interfere with his <HI>time-serving principles</HI> and <HI>poli∣ticks,</HI> he was always ready to shew favour and kindness to Dr. Sharp, whenever he had an opportunity; and happy it was for him that he did so; for afterwards, in the time of his distress, when a <HI>just retribution</HI> of worldly trouble overtook him, (insomuch that he was not only a prisoner, expecting in his turn a <HI>severe execution of the Laws</HI> for his <HI>injustice</HI> and <HI>cruelty,</HI> but also grievously afflicted with the stone, and other diseases, in consequence of his former intemperance,) Dr. Sharp was the only person who afforded him any comfort in his misery; for he regularly visited the unhappy man in his confinement, and used his best endeavours to alleviate his distress, and prepare him for another world by advice and exhortation.</P>
<PB N="62" REF="64"/></NOTE>: for, if this was not the case, it is obvious
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
(considering the great multitude of <HI>selfish</HI> men in comparison of the <HI>Just</HI>) that society could not exist.</P>
<P>And, thirdly, Because <HI>bad</HI> actions, which most abound, manifestly tend, even in the opinion of the offenders themselves, to defeat the most essential purposes of <HI>Self-love;</HI> for the most hard∣ened
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
sinners are conscious, through their innate <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil,</HI> that their unlawful temporary gratifications tend to deprive them of their <HI>"real"</HI> and <HI>"substantial</HI> happiness," viz. <HI>Eternal Salvation;</HI> for if they had not this <HI>Con∣sciousness of Evil,</HI> there could be no such thing as presumptuous sin.</P>
<P><HI>Self-love,</HI> however, under proper re∣strictions, is certainly a main branch of <HI>the Law of Nature;</HI> and, though it can∣not be admitted as the <Q>universal Prin∣ciple of Action,</Q> is nevertheless an <HI>uni∣versal Principle;</HI> but it cannot be ad∣mitted as a <HI>"Rule of Obedience,"</HI> because there are many occasions when it ought to be superseded by more noble Motives to <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil</HI> is also an <HI>universal Principle in Man;</HI> though it is still much farther from being <Q>the
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
universal Principle of Action</Q> than <HI>"Self-love;"</HI> and indeed my present at∣tempt is not to prove <HI>what is</HI> the <Q>uni∣versal Principle of Action,</Q> but only what <HI>it ought to be,</HI> as I before remarked; being convinced, that <Q>the one paternal Precept</Q> laid down by the learned Law Commentator (though certainly with good intentions, and probably with good authority from other Law Writers) as the <HI>"Rule of Obedience,"</HI> (viz. <Q><HI>that we</HI> should pursue our own Happiness</Q>) is very defective; because the very <HI>Rule</HI> itself requires a multitude of other <HI>Rules</HI> to restrain it within due bounds, and curb the <HI>Self-love</HI> of individuals for the benefit of society.</P>
<P>Nothing is so liable to be misunder∣stood as <HI>"our own Happiness;"</HI> for when <HI>Self</HI> alone is the object, <HI>Self-love</HI> can imply nothing but <HI>Partiality</HI> and <HI>Self-preference;</HI> so that such <Q>a Rule of Obe∣dience</Q>
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
is liable to afford a handle of excuse for actions of mere <HI>Self-gratifica∣tion,</HI> to which the learned and worthy author (or, perhaps, rather the adopter) of the hypothesis would be entirely averse: a <HI>Slaveholder,</HI> for instance, might al∣ledge, that he <Q>pursues his own Hap∣piness,</Q> by extorting the unwilling service of other men, because he is thereby enabled to maintain himself and family, not only comfortably, but ele∣gantly; and that the maintenance and support of the sugar islands, and conse∣quently the happiness of his wealthy neighbours, depends upon the employ∣ing of slaves; so that <HI>social benefits</HI> do also arise from it: and he will likewise alledge, that he is obliged by <Q>Self-love</Q> to persist in the measure, be∣cause he cannot maintain the same <HI>Hap∣piness</HI> and comfort by any other means; so that he does not act contrary to <Q>the Law of Nature, <HI>or the</HI> "Rule of
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
Obedience,"</Q> as laid down by the most eminent writers on the subject!</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>"paternal Precept"</HI> (as it is called) of pursuing our own <HI>Happiness,</HI> may lead men to form a false estimate of <HI>necessity</HI> (or what they may think them∣selves <HI>obliged to undertake,</HI> from their particular situation in life) and will afford them the like excuse for any other vice, on which a man's temporal sub∣sistence depends.</P>
<P>It is therefore an <HI>oblique Rule,</HI> which insensibly declines into mere <HI>Self-grati∣fication,</HI> or private Interest, which is the bane of Equity and Justice; so that <HI>Self-love</HI> can no otherwise be admitted <HI>as a Rule,</HI> than for the purpose of measuring the due proportion of <HI>that Love which we owe to the rest of Mankind,</HI> agreeable to a real <HI>"paternal Precept"</HI> that will
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
never deceive us; <Q>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself. <BIBL>Lev. xix. 18.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This excellent maxim of the <HI>Old Law</HI> is strongly enforced and recommended in the New Testament, which shall hereafter be shewn: nay, the very Hea∣thens, it seems, were not entirely igno∣rant of this <HI>Divine Precept;</HI> for the favourite maxim of the Emperor <HI>Alex∣ander Severus</HI> was much to the same effect, according to the report of Lam∣pridius, quoted by the learned Joseph Mede, Book 3. p. 550. viz. <Q><HI>Quod tibi fieri nonvis, alteri ne feceris."</HI> "Do not to another, what you would not have done to yourself.</Q> Neither has the doctrine been overlooked by the writers on <HI>the Law of Nature.</HI> Hobbes very judiciously refers us <HI>to this Rule of Obedience,</HI> <Q>for the easy knowledge of what <HI>the Law of Nature</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
dictates.</Q> <Q><HI>When a Man</HI> doubts</Q> (says he) <Q><HI>whether what he is going to do to another be agreeable to the</HI> LAW OF NATURE, <HI>let him suppose himself in the others room.</HI></Q> <Q>For by this means</Q> (continues he) <Q>when <HI>Self-love</HI> and the other passions, which weighed down one scale, are taken thence, and put into the contrary scale, it is easy to guess which, way the balance will turn</Q> And Baron Puffendorf <NOTE N="(30)" PLACE="foot"><P>Law of Nature and Nations, as translated by Basil Kennet. Oxford 1710. p. 109.</P></NOTE> remarks thereupon, that
—<Q>this is no other than the great rule prescribed by our Saviour himself, of <HI>doing to Men as we would be done by.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The learned Baron, nevertheless, re∣marks in the following paragraph—<Q>that this Precept cannot be esteemed <HI>a fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature;</HI> since it is only a corollary of
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
that Law, which obliges us <HI>to hold all Men equal with ourselves;</HI> and therefore may be demonstrated <HI>à pri∣ori.</HI></Q> But howsoever it may be capable of being demonstrated, yet this is no just objection to <HI>Hobbes</HI>'s excellent rule for knowing,— <Q>what the Law of Na∣ture dictates;</Q> especially as the learn∣ed objector seems, afterwards, to have sought <HI>in vain</HI> for a more <Q>fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature:</Q> for I cannot find, that any thing, he has afterwards proposed, is at all worthy to be compared with it, either as <Q>a Foundation, <HI>or a</HI> "Rule of Obedience."</Q></P>
<P>Nevertheless, in justice to the learned Baron, I must observe, that he has well defended this <HI>general Rule</HI> against the objection of <HI>Dr. Sharrock.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Dr. Sharrock is of opinion</Q> (says he) <Q>that this rule is not universal,
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
because, if so, a judge must needs absolve the criminals left to his sen∣tence; inasmuch as he would certainly spare his own life, were he in their place: I must needs give a poor peti∣tioner what sum soever he desires; because I should wish to be thus dealt with, if I was in his condition: or I must clean my servants shoes; be∣cause I require him to clean mine.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="72" REF="74"/>Neither does the Baron's own objec∣tion, which immediately follows, in the least affect the propriety of <HI>Hobbes</HI>'s rule <Q>for the easy Knowledge of what the Law of Nature dictates:</Q> for though the nature of a <HI>Rule,</HI> or <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Doctrine</HI> (differing from <HI>active Princi∣ples</HI>) be such as to induce the necessity of supposing a <HI>prior Principle,</HI> or Instinct in man, whereby he may be enabled to suggest, adopt, approve, or obey this or any other <HI>Rule</HI> (which seems to be the reason of the Baron's refusing to acknow∣ledge this excellent rule, as <Q>a funda∣mental Axiom of the Law of Na∣ture</Q>) yet the learned Baron himself has multiplied the difficulty, by assign∣ing still another <HI>Rule,</HI> or mere <HI>Principle of Doctrine</HI> (viz. the <HI>holding all Men equal with ourselves</HI>) as the foundation of this <HI>Rule,</HI> instead of a <HI>real first Cause,</HI> such as the <HI>immediate Inspiration of God;</HI> the <HI>Revelation of his Will in the Scriptures;</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
or the <HI>natural and divine Instinct of</HI> KNOWING GOOD <HI>and</HI> EVIL. For whe∣ther <HI>the Precept</HI> is inculcated and made known to Man by <HI>Divine Revelation,</HI> immediate, or scriptural, or merely by the <HI>natural Instinct</HI> in Man, of <HI>knowing Good and Evil,</HI> it may nevertheless be justly esteemed <Q>a fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature.</Q></P>
<P>The Jews and Christians, indeed, are taught the value and importance of <HI>this Precept</HI> by the Holy Scriptures, yet this is not the only means of its being known and received among men as <Q>a Rule of Obedience;</Q>—for, besides the example which I have already given concerning the Emperor Alexander Se∣verus, it appears that the Gentiles, in every part of the world, have demon∣strated a sense of this Precept, without the <HI>assistance of Scripture:</HI> not only the ancient Greeks and Romans, but the
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
remote inhabitants of China and Ame∣rica: of which a few examples are here subjoined from the additional notes of the translator of Puffendorf, p. 109. viz. <Q>Aristotle</Q> (in Diogenes Laertius, Lib. 5. Segm. 21.) <Q>being asked how we ought to behave ourselves towards our friends, answered, <HI>as we wish they would behave themselves towards us.</HI> <BIBL>Lib. 2. tom. 2.</BIBL></Q> <Q>Quod quis juris in alterum, &amp;c. <BIBL>Seneca de Ira, Lib. 3. c. 12.</BIBL></Q> <Q>Let us suppose ourselves in the same circumstances as the person with whom we are angry: That which now puts us in a passion is only the wrong opinion and estimate of ourselves: We are unwilling to <HI>SUFFER</HI> what we are willing to <HI>DO.</HI></Q> <Q>'Tis a saying of <HI>Con∣fucius</HI></Q> (in Marcinus's Hist.

the <HI>Peruvian</HI> empire; in order to the reducing his subjects to a life of civility. <BIBL>De la Vega, L. 1. c. 21.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Thus it appears, that not only the <HI>Heathen nations</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> but also the distant uninformed inhabitants of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> were endued, by their innate <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil,</HI> with general ideas of that most excellent Precept which CHRIST himself has de∣clared to be the <HI>true Christian</HI> RULE OF ACTION: and which, therefore, may justly be esteemed <Q><HI>a fundamental</HI> Axiom of <HI>the Law of Nature,</HI></Q> viz. —<Q>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for <HI>this is the Law and the Prophets,</HI></Q> Matt. vii. 12. See also Luke vi. 31. The meaning and appa∣rent intention of this GOLDEN RULE is exactly the same, in effect, as the other great commandment of the Law, <Q>Thou
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;</Q> so that all persons, who carefully examine these and other parallel texts, must neces∣sarily be convinced, that the command <HI>to love our neighbour as ourselves</HI> is the <Q>ONE PATERNAL PRECEPT,</Q> or rather, I should say, the ONLY <Q><HI>PATERNAL PRECEPT to which the</HI> Creator has graciously reduced the Rule of Obedience,</Q> since by the highest authority we are assured, that the equitable rule of <Q><HI>doing to others,</HI> as we would that men should do unto us;</Q> or, in short, to love our neighbour <HI>as ourselves,</HI> <Q>IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS;</Q> which im∣plies as much as if our Lord had said, This is the Spirit, or FIRST PRIN∣CIPLE OF LAW, and contains <HI>the Sum and Essence of all other Laws!</HI> The testi∣mony of the Apostle Paul is nearly to the same effect—<Q><HI>For</HI> ALL THE LAW</Q> (says he) <Q><HI>is fulfilled in</HI> ONE WORD, <HI>even in this,</HI> THOU SHALT LOVE THY
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF. <BIBL>(Gal. v. 14.)</BIBL></Q> Which might well be paraphrased as follows: <Q>ALL THE LAW IS FUL∣FILLED IN ONE WORD;</Q>—for <Q>the Creator</Q>—<Q>has graciously reduced the Rule of Obedience to this one paternal Precept</Q> (not,—<Q><HI>that</HI> Man should pursue his own Happiness;</Q>—but)— <Q>EVEN IN THIS, THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF;</Q> so that no other <HI>"paternal Precept"</HI> can possibly be received as a <HI>general Rule of Obedience</HI> for all occasions except this alone; which must, therefore, be acknow∣ledged as <HI>the fundamental Rule,</HI> both of <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Revealed Law.</HI> Concerning this Golden Rule of Action, I have wrote a separate Tract under the title of <HI>the Law of Liberty,</HI> or <HI>Royal Law,</HI> to which I must beg leave to refer my readers for further remarks on that head.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80"/>Having now proved, I hope, that this <Q>FUNDAMENTAL AXIOM OF THE LAW OF NATURE</Q> <HI>ought to be</HI> <Q>THE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE OF ACTION IN MAN,</Q> I can more safely resume my discourse concerning <Q>Principles of Action</Q> in general. It has already been shewn, that <Q>the Knowledge of Good and Evil</Q> <HI>is</HI> <Q><HI>an</HI> universal Principle</Q> in <HI>Man,</HI> as well as <HI>Self-love.</HI> But I must now remark, that the former has the following essential difference from <HI>Self-love</HI> as an <HI>universal Principle,</HI> viz. that it is never superseded, like the latter, by any <HI>just Motive of</HI> DUTY (though it is often violated in breach of DUTY through human Frailty); for all <HI>just Motives of</HI> DUTY are perfectly con∣sistent with it, and influence the heart under its direction and guidance, and even the most <HI>noble Motive</HI> to Action (independent of <HI>Inspiration,</HI> or <HI>immediate Revelation</HI>) is so far from superseding
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
the natural <HI>"Knowledge of Good and Evil,"</HI> that it may, more properly, be esteemed an exertion of it: for instance, by a due exertion of <Q>the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</Q> we promote the <HI>very first</HI> Principle of <HI>all Duty,</HI> as it is the <HI>first</HI> great commandment, viz. <HI>The Love of God;</HI> for if we have <Q>Know∣ledge to chuse the Good, and reject the Evil,</Q> the same <HI>Knowledge</HI> must in∣cline us to prefer the <HI>Author of all Good</HI> (when revealed to us) and his Com∣mandments before every other conside∣ration; for so Abraham's Obedience in attempting to sacrifice his son, was ren∣dered acceptable to God: he knew his Maker and supreme Lord by <HI>unquestion∣able Revelation;</HI> and, therefore, justly concluded, through his <HI>natural</HI> <Q>Know∣ledge of Good and Evil,</Q> that the Command of God ought to supersede all <HI>natural Affection,</HI> and <HI>Self-love;</HI> so that this was an <HI>Effect of Reason,</HI> which
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
seemed to counteract even the <HI>Principles of Reason itself,</HI> by dissolving all the ties <HI>of Nature!</HI> But the Patriarch thereby gave an ample proof of a sincere Faith, and of an unfeigned Love to his Creator.</P>
<P>By <HI>what Principle of Action</HI> also was Moses induced (though the meekest of <HI>Men</HI>) to <HI>remonstrate</HI> to his Creator, when the Divine Indignation was declared against the Ingratitude and Wickedness of the children of Israel, in worshipping the molten calf during the time that Moses continued in the mount to receive the Law? God said to Moses—<Q>I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff∣necked people: now therefore <HI>LET ME ALONE, (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> LET ME REST,</HI></Q> <HI>that is, from your intercessions)</HI> <Q>that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may <HI>CONSUME THEM:</HI> and I will make of <HI>THEE</HI> a great nation. <BIBL>Exod. xxxii. 9, 10.</BIBL></Q> Now, if <HI>"Self-love"</HI> had been
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
<HI>"the universal Principle of Action,"</HI> Moses would not have declined the acceptance of such a distinguished honour, when tendered to him even by the ALMIGHTY LORD OF THE UNIVERSE, whose right of disposal could not justly be called in question! But the faithful minister of the Israelitish commonwealth did not seem to entertain the least sense of that imaginary <HI>"paternal Precept"</HI> mentioned above, <Q>that Man should pursue his own Happiness:</Q> for his answer on that occasion proves, that he was actuated by a <HI>Principle</HI> infinitely superior to <HI>Self-love;</HI> I mean a true and unfeigned <HI>Zeal</HI> for <HI>the Glory of God,</HI> arising from a right use of <HI>his natural discretion,</HI> or <Q>Know∣ledge of Good and Evil,</Q> which di∣rected his choice, and enabled him to set aside all consideration of SELF, or private worldly Interest, when he thought the circumstances of the pro∣position seemed likely to affect the ho∣nour
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
of GOD in the misinformed opi∣nion of the Egyptians and other Hea∣then. For he <Q>besought the Lord his God,</Q> <HI>(though God had previously forbid him, saying, "LET ME ALONE")</HI> <Q>and said, Lord, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of <HI>EGYPT,</HI> with great power, and with a mighty hand? Wherefore should the <HI>EGYPTIANS</HI> speak and say, For mis∣chief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath</Q> <HI>(said</HI> Moses <HI>to the ALMIGHTY)</HI> <Q>and repent of this evil against thy people.</Q> And he also claimed the promise by which GOD had absolutely bound himself to the Patri∣archs—<Q>To whom <HI>(said Moses)</HI> thou swarest by thine <HI>OWN SELF,</HI> and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed,</Q> &amp;c. And the text immediately, informs
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
us, that <Q>the <HI>LORD</HI> repented of the evil <HI>which he</HI> thought <HI>to</HI> do unto his people. <BIBL>(Exod. xxxii. 7. to 14.)</BIBL></Q> Thus God was pleased to manifest his regard and consideration even for <HI>Human Judg∣ment!</HI>—even for the opinion of <HI>a mere Man,</HI> when founded on <HI>Reason,</HI> and other <HI>just Principles,</HI> such as mankind are capable of exerting! And shall earthly monarchs, then, presume to despise any reasonable remonstrance of their fellow men—of their equals in every other respect, except that of a de∣legated office, when it is apparent that even the SUPREME LORD, and MAKER OF ALL THINGS, has condescended to hear and graciously receive a remon∣strance from his Creature Man! Nay, and that repeatedly on various occasions! The like remonstrance was also made by Moses, when God declared his anger against Israel, for murmuring at the re∣port given of the promised land; and
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
for proposing to return into Egypt; and also for attempting to stone <HI>Joshua</HI> and <HI>Caleb,</HI> who had endeavoured to appease, and convince them of their error. See the 14th Chapter of Numb. ver. 7. <Q>And the <HI>LORD</HI> said unto Moses, how long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them? I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will <HI>MAKE OF THEE</HI></Q> (<HI>said GOD to</HI> Moses) <Q>a great∣er nation, and mightier than they.</Q></P>
<P>But the noble Principles (far superior to <HI>Self-love</HI>) by which that Great Mi∣nister of State generally regulated his conduct, once more prevented his, ac∣ceptance of the glorious promise, even though tendered by his Maker! His sincere regard for <HI>the Glory of God,</HI> agreeable to the first great Commandment, made him jealous that the <HI>Heathen nations</HI> should
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
falsely conceive, that the LORD JEHO∣VAH was not able to bring his people (the Israelites) into the land which he "sware unto them;" so that his <HI>Zeal for the Glory of God</HI> was, manifestly, the principal <HI>Motive</HI> of his answer on that occasion <NOTE N="(31)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>And Moses said unto the Lord, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them:) And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land; <HI>(for)</HI> they have heard that thou, LORD, <HI>(art)</HI> among this people; that thou, LORD, <HI>(art)</HI> seen face to face; and <HI>(that)</HI> thy cloud standeth over them, and <HI>(that)</HI> thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

<P><PB N="87" REF="89"/>Also upon the rebellion of Korah, re∣lated in the 16th chapter of Numbers, when God spoke to <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> saying,—<Q><HI>Separate yourselves from among this congregation,</HI> THAT I MAY CON∣SUME THEM IN A MOMENT.</Q> Yet these two great leaders of Israel were so little actuated by that imaginary <Q>uni∣versal Principle of Action</Q> SELF-LOVE, that they were entirely regardless of their <HI>own danger,</HI> notwithstanding the divine warning, and seemed to have no other care, but that of endeavouring <HI>to save their brethren</HI> from GOD'S wrath; for it does not appear, that they retreated, or <HI>separated</HI> themselves <Q>from among the congregation,</Q> as they were expressly directed, but only <HI>"fell upon their faces,"</HI> and exerted the powers of <HI>Human Reason</HI> in the following <HI>short remonstrance</HI> to their Maker—<Q><HI>O GOD, THE GOD</HI> of the Spirits of all Flesh, shall <HI>ONE MAN SIN,</HI> and wilt thou be wroth with <HI>ALL

<P>The <HI>like Remonstrance,</HI> founded in sound <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>natural Equity,</HI> had once before been made even to the Al∣mighty himself, by his <HI>faithful Servant</HI> ABRAHAM, when God condescended to reveal to him the awful decree of <HI>Divine Vengeance</HI> against the populous cities of the plains of Sodom.</P>
<P>—<Q>Wilt thou also destroy the Righteous with the Wicked?</Q> (<HI>said Abraham</HI> <NOTE N="(32)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>And Abraham drew near, and said, <HI>Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</HI> Peradven∣ture there be fifty righteous within the city, wilt thou also destroy, and not spare the place for the fifty right∣eous that are therein?

<P><PB N="89" REF="91"/>Thus a due exertion of <HI>right Reason</HI> demonstrated the <HI>Dignity of Human Na∣ture,</HI> and the examples, just mention∣ed, sufficiently prove, that THE AL∣MIGHTY requires his <HI>Creature Man to judge of Right and Wrong,</HI> and to form and declare a sound <HI>Judgment</HI> upon the eternal Principles of <HI>Justice and Right∣eousness,</HI> agreeable to that <HI>Divine Know∣ledge</HI> with which the <HI>Human Mind</HI> is most certainly endowed.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Abraham</HI> and his descendants, <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> knew that they could not exist, even a single moment, without the immediate protection of <HI>Divine Pro∣vidence,</HI> yet they thought it their duty to <HI>remonstrate</HI> even to their CREATOR on the eternal Principles of <Q>Justice and Judgment!</Q></P>
<P>THE ALMIGHTY SEARCHER OF HEARTS knew beforehand what they

would say, and the propriety of their future answers; and, therefore, undoubt∣edly afforded them these extraordinary opportunities of proving to all mankind their <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil,</HI> as well as their <HI>Faith</HI> and entire dependence on the eternal <HI>"Justice</HI> and <HI>Judgment"</HI> of the <HI>Divine</HI> BEING, that these clear ex∣amples of the <HI>Knowledge and Dignity of Human Nature,</HI> as also of the regard and consideration which even the great Au∣thor of <HI>that Nature</HI> was graciously pleased to manifest, on those occasions, towards the mental Faculties of his Creature <HI>Man,</HI> might be recorded to the end of time!</P>
<P>Concerning the Spirit of <Q>Justice <HI>and</HI> Judgment</Q> with which <HI>Abraham</HI> was endowed, God previously declared —<Q>I know him, that he will command his children, and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord

—<Q>Gat up from the tabernacle of <HI>Ko∣rah, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> on every side:</Q> And immediately afterwards God was pleased to justify <HI>Moses,</HI> and to demonstrate the truth of his Divine Mis∣sion, by a tremendous and unusual exam∣ple

<P>Nevertheless, the very next day, <Q>all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses, and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord.</Q>—This further rebellion having once more provoked the Divine Justice, the cloud covered the tabernacle, and the glory of the Lord appeared!

people</Q> by the burning of incense— And accordingly Aaron <Q>stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was staid.</Q> Numb. xvi. 41—48.</P>
<P>These are unquestionable examples to demonstrate, that <HI>"Self-love"</HI> is not <HI>"the universal Principle of Action."</HI></P>

<PB N="99" REF="101"/>which, at the time the Apostle wrote, was dreadfully im∣pending! But whether this conjecture of mine be right or not, and whether the <HI>Anathema</HI> mentioned by the Apostle is to be understood as <HI>temporal,</HI> as <HI>eternal,</HI> or <HI>both;</HI> yet the same limitation with respect to the <HI>Love of Christ</HI> must necessarily be understood, viz. that <Q>the Apostle wished he might perish</Q> <HI>(whether in this world or the next)</HI> <Q>not as an Enemy of Christ, but as a Saviour of his Brethren,</Q> (agreeable to the remark of the learned Chrysostom) and as CHRIST himself also was <Q>MADE A CURSE FOR US. <BIBL>(Gal. iii. 13.)</BIBL></Q> See this point clearly stated by the Rev. Dr. John Sharp, in his <Q>Sym∣phonia Prophetarum et Apostolorum.</Q> Printed at Geneva in 1625.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="100"/></NOTE>; yet it is manifest,
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
that the affectionate and truly patriotic Apostle would have been ready to suffer every kind of <HI>temporal misery,</HI> and even to <HI>lay down his Life</HI> for the <HI>refractory Nation,</HI> if he could thereby have averted the approaching vengeance from his countrymen, and restored them to Grace and the promised Privileges of the Gospel, to which they had been the first invited of all other nations! And therefore we cannot surely conceive, that <Q>the Prin∣ciple of Action,</Q> or <HI>Motive</HI> to such a declaration, was <HI>Self-love.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="102"/>The disinterested Principles of this Apostle are evident also from some other expressions, and especially from that in his Epistle to the Romans, (v. 7.) viz. <Q>—peradventure <HI>for a good Man</HI></Q> (says he) <Q>some would even <HI>dare to die;</HI></Q> which idea totally excludes the Principle of <HI>Self-love.</HI> But though the Apostle's <HI>Expressions</HI> sufficiently prove that <HI>Self-love was not</HI> his Principle of Action, yet the same was more effectually demonstrated by his <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Practice!</HI></P>
<P>And again, When we read of JONA∣THAN'S inviolable <HI>Friendship</HI> towards DAVID, can we conceive, that he was actuated, by <HI>Self-love?</HI> We cannot men∣tion that <HI>Principle</HI> without injustice to the generous character of that truly noble Prince, unless we speak of it comparatively, to shew, that his <HI>Friend∣ship</HI> and <HI>brotherly Love was equal to it;</HI> for the Scripture repeatedly informs us, that he <HI>loved</HI> DAVID <HI>"as his own Soul."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="103"/>It was not <HI>an unreasonable Friendship;</HI> he was well convinced of the <HI>Merit</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> of DAVID; for on these he found∣ed his <HI>Love;</HI> and he had too much <HI>Vir∣tue</HI> himself to violate a <HI>reasonable Friend∣ship,</HI> even though his own <HI>private Inte∣rest</HI> and <HI>very Inheritance</HI> was at stake!</P>
<P>These points were most earnestly pressed upon him with all the authority that an anxious worldly-minded father could possibly assume, and yet without effect—<Q>As long as the Son of Jesse liveth upon the ground</Q> <HI>(said Saul to Jona∣than)</HI> <Q>thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom; wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</Q> Now, if <HI>Self-love</HI> had been <HI>the Principle of Action</HI> with JONATHAN, he could not have greater temptation! But he knew how <Q><HI>to refuse</HI> THE EVIL, <HI>and</HI> CHUSE THE GOOD,</Q> and would not, therefore, submit (like modern statesmen) to the wretched policy of
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
doing <HI>"Evil that Good might come!"</HI>— <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> were his <Q>Principles of Action;</Q> and he was willing to risque, not only his worldly dignity and state, but his life also, rather than injure and forsake an innocent man! <Q>Where∣fore shall he be slain?</Q> <HI>(said he)</HI> <Q>What harm hath he done?</Q>—And when he found that his father persisted in his base resolution, he was filled with honest in∣dignation; and, as the text informs, <Q><HI>rose from the table</HI> IN FIERCE ANGER</Q> —not on account of his father's inju∣rious behaviour to <HI>himself,</HI> in attempt∣ing to kill him with a javelin, but be∣cause <Q><HI>he was grieved</HI> FOR DAVID</Q> (says the text) and that <Q>his father had done him shame. <BIBL>See 1 Sam. xx. 31. to 34.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And again—Was <HI>David,</HI> King of Is∣rael, actuated by <HI>Self-love,</HI> when he ten∣dered <HI>his own Life,</HI> to save <HI>the Lives of his Subjects,</HI> praying God to <Q>Let his
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
hand be against him, and against his father's house,</Q> instead of the nation in general?</P>
<P>Surely his Principles of Action were very different from <HI>Self-love,</HI> or from that imaginary PATERNAL PRECEPT of <HI>"seeking his own Happiness!"</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Conscience</HI> probably informed him, that he was guilty before God in having <HI>numbered</HI> the Israelites, to satisfy some vain or presumptuous curiosity concern∣ing <HI>the Strength of the Nation,</HI> at a time when his whole confidence and hope of success against his enemies ought to have been placed in GOD <HI>alone;</HI> and he would perhaps then recollect, that the same <HI>sinful Presumption within himself,</HI> which had <HI>occasioned</HI> the undertaking, had also <HI>occasioned</HI> <NOTE N="(38)" PLACE="foot"><P>This example proves that KINGS and PRINCES are indispensably bound to exercise themselves daily and constantly in the study of the Holy Scriptures (agreeable

<P><PB N="105" REF="107"/>REASON and CONSCIENCE therefore taught him, that he <HI>himself</HI> was the principal aggressor; and these <HI>just Prin∣ciples,</HI> joined to a <HI>patriotic Regard</HI> for <HI>the Preservation of his Countrymen,</HI> cer∣tainly induced him to present himself to God as the proper victim of divine Vengeance!—For <Q><HI>DAVID</HI> spake unto the <HI>LORD,</HI> when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said—Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done?

<P>It would, surely, be highly absurd to attribute so pathetic and penitent a de∣claration to the Principle of <HI>Self-love</HI> <NOTE N="(39)" PLACE="foot"><P>Some excellent arguments and very striking ex∣amples have been produced by the truly benevolent <HI>Mr. Brooke</HI> of Dublin, in his <HI>"Fool of Quality,"</HI> to prove
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>that <HI>Self-love</HI> is by no means <Q>the universal Principle of Action.</Q></P>
<P>To quote the authority of a romance, in a Tract on the <HI>first Principles of Law,</HI> will perhaps, at first sight, give offence to many of my readers; but, for my excuse, I rely on the propriety of the arguments themselves, and the just application of the several <HI>real examples</HI> by which they are illustrated. I should never of my own accord, I confess, have consulted any work under <HI>the Form of a Novel</HI> for information of this kind; but the sentiments of this sensible author being pointed out to me by a worthy friend, I thought it would be injustice to my ar∣gument, if I neglected to refer my readers to the clear light which the worthy Author of <HI>the Fool of Quality</HI> has thrown upon the subject, when he makes his EARL OF MORELAND enquire <Q>whence, how, by what means may a Man arrive at Happiness?—By getting out of himself, my Lord</Q>—answered his worthy character MR. MEEK∣LY. <Q>Out of himself, Mr. Meekly! you astonish me greatly. A contradiction in terms, unnatural, impossible! —<HI>GOD</HI> himself, my Lord, cannot make a Man happy in any other way, either here, or hereafter. It is, said the Earl, an established maxim among all thinking Men, whe∣ther Divines or Philosophers, that <HI>SELF-LOVE</HI> is the Motive to all Human Actions.—Virtue forbid! exclaimed Mr. Meekly; all Actions are justly held good or evil, base or honourable, detestable or amiable, merely according to their Motives. But if the Motive is the same in all, there is an end, at once, to the possibility of virtue; the cruel 
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>and the kind, the faithful and the perfidious, the prostitute and the patriot, are confounded together,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>He afterwards relates, in very striking terms, the well-known example of <HI>Damon</HI> and <HI>Pythias,</HI> whose inviolable FRIENDSHIP triumphed over SELF-LOVE, as well as over the cruel intentions of the Tyrant <HI>Dionysius.</HI>—Then follows the Author's excellent definition of the term SELF, wherein he demonstrates the necessity of overcoming SELFISHNESS by <HI>superior Principles</HI> originally commu∣nicated to our Nature by the <HI>Divine Intelligence;</HI> and he proves that <HI>such Principles</HI> have prevailed in the world, by reminding us of the ancient states of SPARTA and ROME, which <Q>derived their lustre and power, their whole pre-eminence and praise</Q> <HI>(says he)</HI> <Q>from this Principle of Communication, which, in them, was called <HI>LOVE OF COUNTRY.</HI> But this beatifying Prin∣ciple</Q> <HI>(continues he)</HI> <Q>was still more eminently instanced in the Society of <HI>THE CHURCH OF JERUSALEM,</HI> who had all things in common; who imparted their possessions to all men, as every man had need; and thence did eat their common bread with gladness and singleness of heart, praising <HI>GOD,</HI> and having favour with all people,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>He afterwards mentions the instances of the Roman <HI>Regulus,</HI> and the <HI>Decii,</HI> as also that of <Q>Leonidas, and his three hundred Spartans, <HI>who devoted their lives for THE LIBERTIES</HI> of Greece,</Q> &amp;c. and, lastly, exem∣plifies <Q>this <HI>DISREGARD OF SELF,</HI> the vital Source and Principle of every Virtue, in six Mechanics or Crafts∣men
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>of the city of Calais,</Q> when it was besieged by King Edward the 3d.</P>
<P>The whole argument, with the examples, are too long to be inserted here, but are highly worthy the reader's perusal.—See THE FOOL OF QUALITY, vol. 1. p. 117. —130.</P>
<PB N="105" REF="107"/></NOTE>.
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
The Monarch of Israel was actuated by a much less reasonable <Q>Principle of
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
Action,</Q> (and still very opposite to <HI>Self-love</HI>) when he uttered that bitter
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
lamentation for the death of his wicked, rebellious, and incestuous Son <HI>Absalom</HI> —<Q>Would to <HI>GOD</HI></Q> <HI>(said he)</HI> <Q>I had died for thee my Son!</Q></P>
<P>NATURAL PATERNAL AFFECTION was more powerful in this case than REASON; and every other <HI>Principle of Action,</HI> even <HI>Self-love</HI> (which is also a <HI>natural Affection,</HI> and generally very po∣tent) was entirely superseded by it: for the King most earnestly wished, that he himself had died, instead of that unna∣tural wretch, who (he was well aware) ceased not, whilst he lived, to plot his father's ruin, being an enemy (he well knew) that was implacable, that was restless, and impatient to deprive him,
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
not only of his kingdom, but of his life; and had already violated his bed, in the most publick and shameless manner, with the detestable crime of incest!— There was no room to hope for the reformation of a wretch that had so entirely lost <HI>all distinction between</HI> GOOD <HI>and</HI> EVIL!—No gleam of happiness for his injured father, but in his death!— And yet <HI>paternal Affection</HI> compelled the latter to esteem even <HI>his own death</HI> pre∣ferable, if he could thereby have pro∣longed the wretch's life!—<Q>O my Son Absalom, my Son, my Son Absalom!— Would to God</Q> <HI>(said he)</HI> <Q>I had <HI>DIED FOR THEE,</HI> O Absalom, my Son, my Son! <BIBL>2 Sam. xviii. 33.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Thus it appears that SELF-LOVE is by no means <Q>the universal Principle of Action,</Q> since there are other <HI>Affec∣tions,</HI> which sometimes supersede it, and become the leading <HI>Principles of Action.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112"/>A certain noble Author of the last century, in a work, intituled <Q>A View of the Soul,</Q> has several chapters con∣cerning the Power and Influence of the <HI>Affections</HI> over all the other natural fa∣culties, <HI>Reason itself</HI> not being excepted: and in one chapter he attempts to prove, <Q>that some Affection is the substantial Part of the Soul</Q> <NOTE N="(39)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>I have thought</Q> (says this Author) <Q>and do think, and believe (which is somewhat more than a thought, it is a thought with the concurrence, appro∣bation, and allowance of one's Reason) that the Soul of Man is immortal; and that the very Essence or substantial part of a Human Soul, disrobed of a Body, or subsisting of itself, is some restless working (however at some times invisible) affection; and that if those more noble faculties of our Soul (next and imme∣diately under that bright heavenly Star) are the Pilots to conduct us unto rest, some affection (as it seems to me) is the chief Passenger in this frail and weak Vessel of the flesh. St. Paul, in that admirable Encomium of his of Charity, tells us, that <HI>it abides,</HI> when many other gifts fail. And if <HI>we shall know, as we are known,</HI> as he tells us in another place, there will be then little use of the Invention, Memory, Reason, or the like, which are but the Handmaids to knowledge. Neither can I rationally imagine, after return of the 
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>Soul to its place of rest, or for default thereof in its banishment to everlasting wandering, any use of other faculties than the affections, unless towards the ex∣alting or heightening them in their several degrees, whether love and joy on the one side, or sorrow, fear, &amp;c. on the other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Soul of Man being an emanation from that DIVINE LOVE, must necessarily partake of it, LOVE; and not able at present by any natural light it has, to reach unto itself its proper object, lays hold on any thing, rather than seem to vanish or be extinct; and withal that it happens to have such several inclinations in man, while it is here, is surely by reason of some false imaginary light, or the want of a true one, and that we want both power and skill, in the setting or tuning some strings of the affections, as I may call them. And it is want of a clear inspect into our na∣ture and frame, that we become, as David speaks, <HI>a stubborn generation, a generation that set not their hearts aright, and whose Spirit cleaveth not stedfastly to God.</HI> And I do further believe, that all the faculties, strength, and power of the Soul, which we have, are given us towards the performance of that <HI>first</HI> and great <HI>Commandment, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thy mind:</HI> The whole Soul beside seems naturally subservient, if not subsequent, to the affections motion, and the motion of the Soul would be strange without them, and not imaginable; they being as necessary as
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>they are useful. And therefore I think we may as well cease to be, by our own power, as cease to affect; and they who have gone furthest or most covertly herein, have in going about to hide some particular affections, shewed others more visibly; and for the covering of their joy or sorrow, fear or anger, or the like, have set up for predominant in their Soul, a seeming contempt of all things; which is an affection itself, and, for ought I know, as subject to be faulty as any. For surely the Soul may seem no less glorious in its march, with all its parts and retinue, than some of them; provided it marches the right way, and each faculty help and assist, and not go about to destroy each other.</Q> A VIEW OF THE SOUL.

<PB N="110" REF="112"/></NOTE>. But though
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
the <HI>Affections</HI> are certainly to be esteemed <HI>"Principles of Action,"</HI> yet they cannot
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
at any rate be admitted as <Q>Rules of Obedience</Q> (as I have before observed concerning the <HI>Affection of Self-love</HI>) be∣cause the generality of Mankind are more liable to be influenced by <HI>evil, misplaced Affections,</HI> than by those which might tend to their <HI>real Happiness.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Affections</HI> of the avaricious Man, for instance, are all subordinate to his <HI>Affection</HI> for amassing temporal wealth: —he may <HI>love</HI> his wife and children, perhaps, when the <HI>natural Affections</HI> of
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
the husband and parent do not interfere with his predominant passion for riches; but, whenever they do, the wretch loses all feeling for his own flesh and blood, and will eagerly <HI>sacrifice to</HI> MAMMON the peace of his family, and the hap∣piness of his beloved children, even in the most material circumstance of their lives! And though such a wretch is sometimes influenced, indeed, by the more general Principle of <HI>Self-love</HI> (that is, whenever the consideration of <HI>Self</HI> happens to fall in competition with his duty to other men) yet even <HI>Self-love itself</HI> must yield to the <HI>Love of Hoarding,</HI> since it is the well-known characteristic of the Miser to withhold all the com∣forts of life, <HI>even from</HI> HIMSELF, in order that he may indulge his unreason∣able <HI>Affection</HI> for amassing wealth; which <HI>Depravity,</HI> if not assiduously and care∣fully checked in time, will most surely increase with age, till it becomes inve∣terate
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
and irresistable, and entirely <HI>en∣slave</HI> its wretched Votary!</P>
<P>It would be well for such men, if they deprived themselves only of <HI>tem∣poral</HI> comforts; but, alas, AVARICE defeats SELF-LOVE, even in its most im∣portant concern, <HI>Eternal Welfare.</HI> <Q>Go to now ye Rich Men, weep and howl of your miseries that shall come upon you.</Q> James v. 1. Compare this with what has already been mentioned in pages 23—30.</P>
<P>The <HI>depraved Appetites</HI> and <HI>Affections</HI> of Drunkards and Gluttons are also PRINCI∣PLES OF ACTION, which are frequently too powerful both for <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Consci∣ence,</HI> and even for <HI>Self-love!</HI> for they too often lead Men with their eyes open to <HI>certain destruction,</HI> even though they are warned by the clearest Conviction and <HI>Foreknowledge</HI> concerning the inevitable consequences of their respective vices! Diseases, misery, and death may stare

them in the face, and mark them, by their gradual approaches, as the unfor∣tunate victims of these criminal indul∣gencies;—but how seldom do they deter! Nay, the certain expectation even of eternal damnation is not sufficient to re∣form them; and the learned Dr. Hales has produced an example <NOTE N="(40)" PLACE="foot"><P>—<Q>so bewitching is this infatuation, that though they cannot, most of them, but be sensible,</Q> (says Dr. Hales) <Q>that they are manifestly shortening their days, and just plunging themselves into their graves; yet will they not refrain.

<P>The depraved <HI>Affections</HI> for every other vice, as <HI>Lust, Gaming,</HI> &amp;c. are equally capable of supplanting the universal
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
Principles of <HI>Self-love</HI> and <HI>Common Sense;</HI> and do frequently carry Men headlong to destruction, when it is impossible but that they must have foreseen the necessary consequences of their inordinate pur∣suits!</P>
<P>How carefully therefore ought Man∣kind to guard themselves against every <HI>unlawful Affection;</HI> and strenuously to resist them, whenever they occur, lest any undue <HI>Affection</HI> should become the <HI>reigning Principle of Action,</HI> and lead the poor <HI>enslaved</HI> mortal to eternal destruction! <Q>From whence <HI>(come)</HI> wars and fightings among you? <HI>(Come they)</HI> not hence, <HI>(EVEN) OF YOUR LUSTS, THAT WAR IN YOUR MEMBERS?</HI> Ye <HI>LUST,</HI> and have not: ye <HI>KILL,</HI> and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye <HI>ASK NOT.</HI> Ye <HI>ASK,</HI> and receive not, because ye <HI>ASK AMISS,</HI> that ye may consume it upon

<P>But many actions which may seem ap∣parently to have been occasioned merely by <HI>corrupt Affections,</HI> are nevertheless promoted by a more latent cause: I mean the <HI>Inspiration</HI> or <HI>Influence of the spiritual Enemies</HI> <NOTE N="(41)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>THE DEVIL is not merely a name, which those who would sap the foundations of religion pre∣tend religion has contrived to frighten timorous minds; nor is danger then only to be apprehended from him, when he is supposed to assume a bodily form: it is superstitious weakness to be afraid of him only when imbodied, and to neglect the secret and unseen influ∣ence, which his continual converse with us, as an unimbodied spirit, may have upon us. He and his angels are not yet <HI>cast into outer darkness,</HI> tho' it be prepared for them; the mouth of the bottomless pit is not yet closed over them: they fell from GOD, not so much by a local descent, as by mental apostasy and dissimilitude; and they have still this visible world, once the seat of their happiness and glory, to range in: they are, therefore, stiled by the Apostle <HI>spiritual

A vain <HI>Fantastick,</HI> that takes proud cloaths to be <HI>Part of Himself,</HI> is as desirous of change of suits or costly apparel, as a poor man is of apparel itself, or of such stuff as is sufficient to keep out cold and wet.

The desire of wealth or worldly goods, after it hath once exceeded its lawful bounds, becomes as unsatisfiable as Hell. It enlargeth itself by often satisfaction, and of all earthly and mortal things, it knows no stint or period of growth, but grows strong and lusty by waxing old.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>None of these desires</HI> of meat, of drink, of apparel, of satisfaction for wrongs done or suspected, of ho∣nour, riches, or preferment, are <HI>in themselves,</HI> or for their quality, <HI>unlawful.</HI> Their <HI>unlawfulness</HI> consists only in their <HI>excess.</HI> But even the best of these or like
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>desires, being improved beyond its measure, will, for its private satisfaction, <HI>betray the Soul,</HI> which gives it harbour, into Satan's hands. He doth not, he need not tempt any man to be a thief, a robber, or a murtherer. <HI>For,</HI> (as St. James tells us, Chap. 1.14.) <HI>Every man is tempted</HI> (to these and the like crimes) <HI>by his own concupiscence,</HI> and our <HI>concupiscences and sensual desires are always increased by custom.</HI> He that hath long inured himself to exceed either in quality of meat or drink, or to fare deliciously, desires only to satisfy his appetite, or to observe his delightful <HI>custom:</HI> so these may be satisfied, he hath no desire to be a <HI>thief,</HI> to be a <HI>cheater,</HI> or couzener. But <HI>rather than his intemperate appetite should be unsatisfied,</HI> he will take himself to some other part of <HI>Satan's Service;</HI> and adventure on <HI>theft</HI> or <HI>murther,</HI> or any other breach of God's commandments.</Q> Dr. Jackson's Works, Vol. 3. p. 62.</P>

to give us the most ample warning throughout the Scriptures of our con∣tinual danger; insomuch that the Chri∣stian Church hath generally made the necessary resistance <HI>to Evil Spirits</HI> an ex∣press Article of the Baptismal Vow, viz. To <Q>renounce the Devil and all his Works.</Q> Nevertheless, the unreason∣able <HI>Heresy</HI> of the <HI>Sadduces</HI> (who were the <HI>Deists</HI> of ancient times) not only subsists to this day, but seems even to prevail in a most dangerous degree; for there are many people amongst us, who <HI>profess</HI> to <HI>believe</HI> the Scriptures, and yet affect to <HI>disbelieve</HI> the existence of those malignant spiritual Beings, commonly mentioned and signified under the name of <HI>"the Devil,"</HI> though the Scriptures afford the clearest testimony concerning them: but our modern <HI>Sadduces</HI> endea∣vour to explain all texts, wherein Devils or Evil Spirits are mentioned, as mere customary figures of speech expressive of
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
some <HI>Evil</HI> Affections, and sometimes of mere bodily Disorders <NOTE N="(43)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>According to them</Q> (said Archbp. Sharp) <Q>the Devil that is so often spoken of in the Scriptures, is nothing else but either a disease of the body, or a phantasm in the brain, or the wicked principles and inclinations of a man's heart. This is the doctrine of Mr. Hobbs, and his followers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But there cannot a vainer conceit enter into a man's head than this is. By the very same logic that they can prove this, they may likewise prove, that all those men that are spoken of in the Old and New Testa∣ment, were not real persons, but qualities. For it is certain, that the Devil is in the Scripture as much represented as a person, a real subsisting being, distinct from God and from good angels, and from mankind; I say, he is as plainly thus represented, as any man or woman, that is there mentioned, is. And he, for in∣stance, that will say, that when our Saviour was tempted by the Devil in the wilderness, all this was but a tran∣saction of his imagination, and that it was only his own fancy that presented to his eyes all the kingdoms of the world, and that it was only his own fancy that set him upon a pinacle of the temple, and would have had him fallen down and worshipped it; I say, he that would give such an account as this, of that matter, may with the same reason say, that Jesus himself was but a phantasm, an imagination, and that there was never such a real person in the world.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126"/><Q>The Devil then has a real Being of his own, inde∣pendent of us, or any other creature: and that Being is of the <HI>spiritual or angelic nature.</HI> As there are good spirits, and good angels, so there are evil spirits, and evil angels; and of this latter sort is the the Devil.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But then, secondly, When we are speaking of the Devil, we are not to understand any one particular being, or any one particular evil spirit, but the whole aggregate, or company of evil spirits, which inhabit round about us in the lower regions of the air. All these are in the scripture language, and in common speech, called by the name of the Devil, and some∣times in the plural number, by the name of Devils.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For the understanding this we are to know, that among that infinite and innumerable company of angels which God created in a happy and glorious condition, all of them did not continue in that primitive happi∣ness: but several of them, by their wilful apostasy from God, forfeited that dignity and glory they were pos∣sessed of, and so depraved their natures, that they were incapable of dwelling any longer where they did before: but were, by the just vengeance of God, cast down into these lower regions of the air, where they are reserved by Providence, to the judgment and pu∣nishment of the great day.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This is the plain account that the Scriptures give us as to this matter. Thus St. Jude in the 6th verse of 
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>his Epistle: <HI>The angels,</HI> saith he, <HI>that kept not their first estate, but left their own habitations, them hath God re∣served in everlasting chains under darkness, unto the judg∣ment of the great day.</HI> And just to the same purpose, and almost in the same words, doth St. Peter speak in the second chapter of his second Epistle, verse the fourth.</Q></P>
<P><Q>These fallen angels now thus thrust down from heaven, tho' they do yet in a great measure retain all the intellectual accomplishments of the angelical na∣ture, such as reason, and memory, and knowledge, yet are they in their moral qualities quite contrary to all the good angels; and particularly as to this, that as the good angels are infinitely kind and benign, great lovers of God and of mankind, and most intirely dis∣posed to do all good offices to them whatsoever; so the nature of those fallen angels is cruel and revengeful, full of hatred, and spite, and malice to God, and to his whole creation; and upon account of this, the Scripture hath given to them the name of Satan or Devil, which two words (as all that understand the learned languages know) signify neither more nor less than an adversary, or an accuser, or calumniator. The one being the Hebrew word for it, and the other the Greek word. And indeed it is, with reference to this enmity to mankind, that most of these names and cha∣racters, that they bear in Scripture, are bestowed upon them. Upon this account it is, that the Devil is called a murderer, a deceiver, a lyar, and the father of lyes,
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>the destroyer, the old serpent, the great dragon, with sundry other such appellations. But then, tho' these names being put in the singular number, seem to denote some single evil spirit, that bears ill-will to mankind; yet we are always to remember, that they are to be expounded collectively, that is to say, to signify the whole body of these apostate spirits, of which there are a vast number: I say, the whole body of them; for that these lapsed angels are formed into a body politic, or government, or kingdom, is plainly enough inti∣mated in the New Testament: for there we meet with the kingdom of darkness, in opposition to the kingdom of light; and there we meet with the prince of the Devils as the chief of them; who is likewise by St. Paul called, <HI>The god of this world, and the prince of the power of the air.</HI> Under whom also, as in other societies, there are many subordinate officers, as St. Paul seems to intimate in the 6th of the Ephesians; where, among the wicked spirits in heavenly places (that is, in the air, as Grotius, with the ancients, rightly expounds it) that he saith we wrestle against, he makes mention in the plural number of principalities and powers, and other rulers of the darkness of this world.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This is the Scripture account of these matters. I must confess, it may seem a very odd thing to some, that there should be in the world a society of such spi∣rits, as are confessedly endowed with all the knowledge and subtilty of the angelical nature, and yet are so hor∣ribly
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>degenerated in their morals, as to take pleasure in every thing that is naught, and even in ruining mankind, if they could. But that it is really possible that there should be such beings, <HI>doth in some measure appear from the prodigious instances of the depravation of reasonable natures, that we sometimes see among ourselves;</HI> there being men of excellent parts and endowments to be found, that do sometimes so far degenerate from human kind, that for all manner of wickedness and malice, they may be rather called <HI>Devils than men.</HI> But that it is more than possible, that there are a race of such spirits, as do malign the welfare of mankind, and take pleasure in making fools, and wretches, and <HI>slaves of them,</HI> is too evident, both from all the histo∣ries of past ages, and from the sad experience of some nations at this day; who (if we may credit the histories that are writ of them) do miserably <HI>groan under the violences and tyranny of the Devil.</HI> But however, no one that acknowledgeth the truth of the Scripture, can possibly doubt of this; for what I have now deli∣vered, is so plainly affirmed in the Old and New Testa∣ment, that there is no evading of it. And indeed, this hypothesis of the being of evil spirits, and their ill will to mankind, and their concerning themselves continually to do us mischief, <HI>is so interwoven with, and makes so considerable a part of the scheme of, our reli∣gion, as it is delivered by Christ and his Apostles, that we cannot deny the one, without much weakening, if
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>not altogether overthrowing, the other.</HI></Q> Archbishop Sharp's Sermons, Vol. 3. p. 60—65.</P></NOTE>. Howsoever plausible this kind of sophistry may ap∣pear,

of the subject delivered in the context, that it is impossible to wrest them from

the obvious literal meaning, without perverting all the rules of grammar and common sense.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130"/>We are most carefully warned by the great Apostle to the Gentiles, to be upon our guard against these powers of darkness.</P>

<P>In the same Epistle (iv. 27.) the Apostle still further warns the Ephesians against the SPIRITUAL ENEMY. <Q>Nei∣ther</Q> <HI>(says he)</HI> <Q>give place, to the <HI>DEVIL.</HI></Q> And, in his 2d Epistle to
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
the Corinthians (ii. 10, 11.) he signifies his forgiveness to some offending person (probably meaning that fornicator whom he ordered in the 1st Epistle (Chap. 5.) to be excommunicated. He says, <Q>for <HI>your sakes</HI> (forgave I it) <HI>in the person (or in the sight or presence) of Christ;</HI> lest <HI>SATAN</HI> should get an advantage over us: for we are not ignorant of his De∣vices.</Q> The Apostle James also warns us upon the same points: <Q>Resist the Devil</Q> <HI>(says he)</HI> <Q>and he will flee from you.</Q> (iv. 7.) And the Apostle Peter is still more particular in his ad∣vice on this head—<Q>Be sober, be vigi∣lant;</Q> <HI>(says he)</HI> <Q>because your Ad∣versary <HI>THE DEVIL,</HI> as a roaring Lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.

<P>The same Apostle also tells us, that <Q><HI>GOD</HI> spared not <HI>THE ANGELS</HI> that

sinned, but cast them <HI>DOWN TO HELL,</HI> and delivered them into <HI>CHAINS OF DARKNESS,</HI> to be reserved unto Judg∣ment. <BIBL>(2 Pet. ii. 4.)</BIBL></Q> The Word which is here translated "<HI>down to</HI> HELL," viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (<Q>down to <HI>Tar∣tarus,</HI></Q> or <Q><HI>in Tartarus;</HI>)</Q> is derived from the Greek verb <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Terreo,</HI> to <HI>dread,</HI> or <HI>be in Terror;</HI> so that even if <HI>Tartarus,</HI> or <HI>Hell,</HI> does not signify a real <HI>Place</HI> <NOTE N="(44)" PLACE="foot"><P>But the place of torment, or <HI>Hell,</HI> after the day of Judgment, must necessarily signify a <HI>real Place</HI> of ma∣terial <HI>Fire,</HI> because <HI>all Men</HI> are to rise again <HI>with their Bodies</HI> <NOTE N="(46)" PLACE="foot">And <HI>(though)</HI> after my skin <HI>(worms)</HI> destroy this <HI>(Body) yet</HI> IN MY FLESH <HI>shall I see God.</HI> Job xix. 26.</NOTE>, and consequently will be capable of <HI>bodily</HI> punishment; for it is not the <HI>Soul alone,</HI> but the <HI>whole Body</HI> of the unrepenting Sinner, that will be <Q>cast into Hell <NOTE N="(47)" PLACE="foot"><Q>If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy mem∣bers should perish, and not that <HI>thy</HI> WHOLE BODY <HI>should be cast into Hell.</HI></Q> Matt. v. 20.30.</NOTE>;</Q> and as <HI>Human Bodies</HI> after the Resurrection will be <HI>incorruptible</HI> <NOTE N="(48)" PLACE="foot"><Q>For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised <HI>incorruptible,</HI> and we shall be changed.

And lastly, it is not improbable, that even <HI>this Terrestial Globe,</HI> on which the worldly-minded seem to place their whole desire and happiness, may hereafter be∣come that very <HI>Hell,</HI> or place of future punishment both for wicked <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Devils,</HI> since it has so long been the seat both of <HI>Human</HI> and <HI>Diabolical</HI> wickedness; for Moses seems to intimate, in his prophetical song, that there is a <HI>worldly Hell</HI>—<Q>a Fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn <HI>UNTO THE LOWEST HELL</HI></Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <Q>and shall consume the earth, with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</Q> (Deut. xxxii. 22.)

such a <HI>total Darkness</HI> of Apostacy and absolute Reprobation, as I have sup∣posed, wherein the disobedient Angels are <HI>bound</HI> and <HI>reserved</HI> for the day of Vengeance; for <Q>THE EVERLASTING FIRE <NOTE N="(54)" PLACE="foot"><P>Having in a former note, at p. 131, made some remarks concerning the probability that the present <HI>Ter∣restrial Globe</HI> (on which the greater part of mankind seem to place their whole interest and desire) will hereafter be∣come the region of EVERLASTING FIRE, or <HI>Hell,</HI> I have since had the satisfaction to find, on a further examination of that point, that the same opinion hath been long ago decisively asserted by my own grandfather, in a sermon concerning <HI>"the manner of the day of judgment;"</HI> and though I could wish my readers to peruse the whole ser∣mon, yet I must beg leave to lay before them a short ex∣tract from it, which is much to my present purpose.—<Q>The second particular</Q> (says he) <Q>which the Scrip∣tures acquaint us with concerning the general judg∣ment, is this; that <HI>the earth shall then be set on fire,</HI> and that in the most terrible manner imaginable. Whether this general conflagration will happen upon Christ's coming to judgment, or rather will be the last transaction of the judgment, the Scripture doth not declare. But that there shall be such a conflagration, and that THIS FIRE SHALL BE FOR THE EVER∣LASTING PUNISHMENT BOTH OF THE DEVIL AND WICKED MEN, WHO WILL ALL BE TUMBLED
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>DOWN INTO THESE LOWER REGIONS, WHICH WILL THEN BE A PERFECT LAKE OR SEA OF FIRE (as the Scripture expresseth it, Rev. xix. 20.) is beyond all doubt. To this purpose let us observe what the Apostle says, <HI>The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, to take vengeance of them that know not God, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> 2 Thess. i. 7.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But more expresly this conflagration of the world is taught us in the second Epistle of St. Peter, Chap. iii. 6, 7. where the Apostle tells us, that <HI>as the world which was of old perished</HI> by an universal deluge of <HI>water, so the heavens and the earth which are now, are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</HI> From whence it is plain, that at the day of judgment this world shall be set on fire, and that fire shall be for the punishment of un∣godly men. Furthermore, in the verses following, he adds to the same purpose, <HI>The day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up,</HI> ver. 10.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If any one be at a loss to conceive how the heavens should be set on fire as well as the earth, as St. Peter three times in this chapter affirms they shall be; the difficulty will be removed by considering that the hea∣vens here spoken of, are not those heavens in which 
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>stars are, (in which signification we commonly use that word) but the sublunary heavens, viz. those lower re∣gions of the air, wherein are the clouds and vapours and other meteors, which are here called the elements, and in which sense the heavens are frequently taken in holy Scripture. Now these heavens, together with all that is in them, shall at that day pass away with a crackling noise of fire, and the earth, and all the things in it, shall be put in flames. David tells us, that <HI>upon the wicked God shall rain fire and brimstone, and an hor∣rible tempest; this shall be the portion of their cup,</HI> Psalm xi. 6. And our Saviour intimates the same, when he tells us, as <HI>in the day when Lot went out of Sodom, it it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all; so shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed,</HI> Luke xvii. 29, 30.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And now who can express the horror and confusion that shall be at that day? Who can fancy so sad and dismal a face of things, as shall then be all the world over? Could we imagine ourselves to be present, when the whole frame of nature is upon the point of dissolu∣tion, and the whole world in flames about our ears, with what terror and amazement should we be filled? How would our hearts fail us, <HI>and our joints be loosed, and our knees smite against each other,</HI> Dan. v. 6. unless we were sure we were in the number of those who should be wafted up to meet the bridegroom with com∣fort? Oh, what will then become of all impenitent
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>sinners! What will become of all worldly, sensual, am∣bitious, voluptuous men, who set up their rest in this world, and mind nothing but their ease, and the gra∣tification of their appetites, or the pursuit of their secular interests! When they shall see all that they loved, all that they admired, all that they delighted in, gone, irrecoverably gone in a moment! Lastly, what will become of all those bold profane persons, who entertained all discourses of a future judgment only with scoffs and derision! Oh, how will they find themselves abused, and see, to their great amazement, what they would never before believe, that <HI>there is a reward for the righteous, that there is indeed a God that judgeth the earth!</HI> <BIBL>Ps. lviii. 11.

See Archbishop Sharp's Sermons, Vol. 3. Serm. 2. p. 21. and indeed all the Sermons col∣lected in that Volume are on such points as are most liable to perplex and disturb the minds of persons subject

the Principles of Action,</HI> if we are not careful and vigilant to <HI>resist</HI> them as we ought: for Christ did not forbid the Tempter from using his endeavours against <HI>Peter,</HI> but only prayed, that THE FAITH <HI>of the Apostle</HI> should not <HI>fail;</HI> whereby he has taught us, that a sound and stedfast FAITH (for which WE ALSO <HI>are bound to pray</HI>) will sufficiently enable us to resist the POWERS OF DARKNESS.</P>
<P>But when Men disbelieve the very existence of those active <HI>Spiritual Ad∣versaries,</HI> how should they be upon their guard to resist their influence?

<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
and the groundless notions of <HI>the Sad∣ducees,</HI> are openly set up in opposition to the clear testimonies of revealed Re∣ligion, and the true Faith: for in all such places, it is obvious, that the in∣terest of <HI>Satan</HI>'s empire will be promoted by a disbelief of his existence; and con∣sequently, that the <HI>Angels of Darkness</HI> will, in such places, most carefully abstain from every outward and visible demon∣stration of their agency and power among Men. Whereas at other times, and in other places, where ignorance of a con∣trary nature has prevailed, and Men have been subjected to <HI>superstitious</HI> ter∣rors, by neglecting the only proper ob∣ject of their confidence, in such places, I say, the <HI>Agency</HI> and Interference of DEMONS with <HI>Mankind</HI> have ever been notorious and manifest; of which the histories of all Heathen nations bear ample testimony.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="155"/>The uniformity of <HI>Demon Worship,</HI> in all parts of the world, before the preach∣ing of the Gospel, affords also a clear proof of the worldly <HI>Empire of Satan;</HI> for though Devils were worshipped under various names, and various figures, yet there was a constant uniformity in all such particular points as tended most to <HI>the Destruction of Mankind,</HI> or to lead Men to the most direct opposition to the revealed Laws of God, whereby the universal Author or Promoter of such baneful devices was clearly discoverable; the same being for the most part con∣trary to the <HI>Nature of Man,</HI> and such, therefore, as could not <HI>naturally</HI> pro∣ceed from <HI>Man</HI> alone.</P>

to be led on from one vice to another, till the two before-mentioned natural and <HI>universal Principles</HI> in Mankind, in∣tended for their <HI>Preservation,</HI> viz. <HI>Com∣mon Sense</HI> (or <HI>Reason</HI>) and <HI>Self-love,</HI> have lost their influence: for the <HI>Actions</HI> of of a great part of Mankind cannot be accounted for upon any other <HI>Principle</HI> than that of a <HI>lamentable</HI> BONDAGE <HI>to the</HI> SPIRITUAL ADVERSARY, who leads them to actions that are clearly contrary to <HI>Self-love</HI> and <HI>Common Sense,</HI> and con∣trary even to any probable gratification that might afford a <HI>Temptation</HI> to Hu∣man Beings!—to actions that apparently tend to their own everlasting destruction!</P>
<P>How common is it for Men to lift their hands against their own life, and deliberately to exclude themselves from all possibility of repentance? It must be allowed indeed, that real <HI>Madness,</HI> or Lunacy, and other <HI>natural</HI> distempers
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
and frenzies, are frequently the <HI>Princi∣ples of Action</HI> which occasion Suicide; but we have too many instances of <HI>de∣liberate Self-murder,</HI> wherein no such <HI>natural</HI> causes can with justice be al∣ledged, though generally assigned by the coroner's juries, through a false notion of mercy, which inclines them to adopt the erroneous maxim, that <Q>all Men are mad who kill themselves.</Q> But nothing is more false!</P>
<P>If the Brute Creation were equally liable to voluntary deaths, <HI>Suicide</HI> might with more probability be attributed to natural causes <HI>only,</HI> as they are almost equally liable to <HI>distempers;</HI> but herein appears a capital distinction between <HI>Human Nature</HI> and that of <HI>Brutes.</HI> None of the BRUTE CREATION ever violate the <HI>universal Principle</HI> of SELF-LOVE, which the Divine <HI>Author of Na∣ture</HI> has given them for their preserva∣tion!
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
And though MAN is also endowed with the <HI>same Principle,</HI> as I have already shewn, yet <HI>the very</HI> BRUTES make so much better use of it <HI>than</HI> MAN, that in them we distinguish the <HI>same Principle,</HI> even by another name, and call it IN∣STINCT—<HI>an</HI> INSTINCT <HI>of Self-preser∣vation</HI>—an <HI>Instinct,</HI> because it is never violated. How are we to account for this seeming Superiority in the BRUTES? Why should HUMAN NATURE be more subject to Depravity than they are? MAN, who, in addition to that <HI>natural Light</HI> with which he was endowed at the time of his Creation, has since ac∣quired an additional power of discern∣ment and prudence for his preservation, even a <HI>Divine Knowledge</HI> of GOOD and EVIL, that he <Q>may know how to refuse the <HI>EVIL,</HI> and chuse the <HI>GOOD;</HI></Q> and yet is in general infinitely more depraved than the very BRUTES! Let any rea∣sonable Man consider how impossible it
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
is, by <HI>natural Causes,</HI> to account for so extraordinary a circumstance! That MAN, endowed with such a Superiority of <HI>Knowledge</HI> for SELF-PRESERVATION, and also endowed with <HI>Self-love</HI> in com∣mon with the rest of the Creation, should yet be subject to such monstrous Depravity, as to lose all sense of both, while the BRUTES are never known to violate that universal Principle, <HI>Self-love!</HI> except it be for <HI>a reasonable Cause,</HI> that they risk <HI>their own Lives</HI> in defence of their young, to preserve their species, or through gratitude, as Dogs will de∣fend their masters, which surely is no Depravity! To what extraordinary cause then shall we attribute this very singular superiority of BRUTES in a circumstance so necessary to happiness. The cause is obvious, BRUTES have never been sub∣ject to <HI>spiritual Delusions,</HI> or to be actuated by <HI>infernal Spirits,</HI> since the time that the Serpent deceived our first parents!</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="176"/>There is no instance, I believe, since that time, of BRUTES being really <HI>actu∣ated by evil Spirits,</HI> except one; and that was (be pleased to observe) by <HI>express Permission</HI> of <HI>our</HI> LORD <HI>himself,</HI> viz. when the Devils entered into the swine by the lake of Gennesareth. For it appears, that the <HI>Demons</HI> had no power to enter into the animals, till our Lord had ex∣pressly granted it: for—<Q>the Devils <HI>BESOUGHT HIM,</HI> saying, If thou cast us out, <HI>SUFFER US</HI> to go away into the herd of swine, and he said unto them, Go.</Q> THE PERMISSION being thus gained, the animals immediately ac∣quired a new <HI>"Principle of Action,"</HI> too similar to that which actuates poor aban∣doned sinners among MEN (as when <HI>the Devil</HI> entered <HI>Judas,</HI> and led him, not only to betray his Lord, but to punish the horrid treason <HI>with his own hands,</HI> contrary to every conceivable <HI>Natural Principle of Action</HI>) so the unhappy Brutes

by Gennesareth were no sooner subjected, <HI>like Mankind,</HI> to the Bondage of <HI>infernal Spirits,</HI> than they immediately lost that Principle of <HI>Self-love,</HI> which in them (because never violated but at this par∣ticular time) is called <HI>Instinct;</HI> and by the immediate consequence of that loss, they have afforded us a notable example of the baneful effects of <HI>Diabolical In∣spiration</HI> <NOTE N="(76)" PLACE="foot"><P>This particular case of <HI>the Gadarene Demoniacks</HI> has been violently attacked by the opposers of the com∣mon received doctrine concerning <HI>the Reality of Demoniacal Possessions.</HI> Three very eminent and learned men among them, for instance, have endeavoured to accommodate to their own notions the evangelical history of this matter, and by the failure of their several attempts have proved, that the <HI>literal meaning</HI> of the terms in which the Evan∣gelists have related the several circumstances of that case (and no less than three Evangelists out of the four have mentioned it) cannot possibly be set aside, without raising up in its stead the most glaring absurdities!

And he very justly concludes thereupon—<Q>For these rea∣sons</Q> <HI>(says he)</HI> <Q>I cannot accede to the opinion of those learned writers, who ascribe the destruction of the swine to the madmen.</Q> But then (unfortunately for himself) he immediately adds—<Q>Neither</Q> <HI>(says he)</HI> <Q>can I see any just ground for ascribing it to <HI>THE AGENCY OF DE∣MONS.</HI> <BIBL>P. 291.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>He tells us elsewhere, that <Q>what is called the ejection of <HI>DEMONS,</HI> is the case of a natural disorder, <BIBL>p. 178 and 189</BIBL></Q> <Q>—<HI>that there never was, nor can be, a real Demoniack,</HI>' p. 240—'that the <HI>DEMONIACKS</HI> spoken of in the New Tes∣tament were <HI>ALL</HI> either <HI>MADMEN</HI> or epilepticks, <BIBL><HI>Prop.</HI> vi. p. 92.</BIBL></Q>—And, with respect to the particular case before us, 'he asserts, that <Q>all that can he inferred from their</Q> <HI>(the Evangelists)</HI> <Q>saying,</Q> <HI>that</HI> <Q>the Demons came out of the Men, and entered into the herd of swine,</Q> <Q>is, that the madness of the former was transferred to the latter, in the

<P>Certain it is, that no created Being whatsoever, whe∣ther <HI>good</HI> or <HI>evil, visible</HI> or <HI>invisible,</HI> can have any power to act without the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Permission</HI> of the AL∣MIGHTY; but, at the same time, we must remember, that there is a very material difference between <Q>the <HI>AGENCY</HI> of God,</Q> and the PERMISSION of God.— God is, indeed, said to do what he only <HI>permits,</HI> as I have elsewhere remarked (see notes in pages 134 to 137) and he sometimes grants his <HI>Permission</HI> to very unworthy AGENTS, both <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>temporal,</HI> which act with views and intentions very opposite to the actual purposes of God, that are really <HI>effected</HI> by their <HI>Actions;</HI> for the histories of all nations sufficiently testify, that even the <HI>vices</HI> and <HI>malicious dispositions</HI> of the enemies both to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> are frequently <HI>permitted</HI> to act <HI>as Instruments</HI> of DIVINE VENGEANCE (see my Tract on the <HI>Law</HI> of Retribution, pages 125, 184, and elsewhere) to promote the <HI>eternal Justice</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of the ALMIGHTY, as he alone can bring <HI>Good</HI> out of <HI>Evil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181"/>But in all such cases, wherein there is manifest evidence of <HI>Evil</HI> in the production of events, though the same are certainly by the <HI>Sufferance</HI> or <HI>Permission</HI> of God, yet it would be highly injurious to truth to ascribe the AGENCY to GOD.</P>
<P>In the case before us concerning the <HI>Gadarene Demo∣niacks,</HI> the PERMISSION and the AGENCY are clearly distinguished by the Evangelists in the most express terms. <Q>So the <HI>DEMONS</HI> besought him, saying, if thou cast us out, <HI>SUFFER US</HI> to go away into the herd of swine. And he said unto them, <HI>Go.</HI> <BIBL>Matth. viii. 31, 32.</BIBL></Q>—<Q>And all the <HI>DEMONS</HI> besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. And forthwith <HI>JESUS GAVE THEM LEAVE.</HI> <BIBL>Mark v. 12.</BIBL></Q>—<Q>And they <HI>(the Demons)</HI> besought him <HI>(Jesus)</HI> that he would <HI>SUFFER THEM</HI> to enter into then <HI>(the herd of swine)</HI> and <HI>HE SUFFERED THEM.</HI> <BIBL>Luke viii. 32.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Thus the DIVINE PERMISSION is clearly and distinctly declared; and the same faithful historians leave us as little room for doubt concerning the AGENTS in this matter: for, <Q>when they' <HI>(the DEMONS)</HI> 'were come out, they entered into the swine: and behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. <BIBL>Matth. viii. 32.</BIBL></Q>—<Q>And the <HI>UNCLEAN SPIRITS</HI> went out, and entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down a steep place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <BIBL>Mark v. 13.</BIBL></Q> <Q>—Then went the <HI>DEMONS</HI> out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down, &amp;c. <BIBL>Luke viii. 33.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="182"/>Here is the most EXPRESS EVIDENCE of three Evan∣gelists, that DEMONS, or UNCLEAN SPIRITS, <HI>entered into the swine;</HI> and the consequences of that <HI>entering</HI> are as clearly noted;—<HI>the animals rushed headlong to their own apparent destruction!</HI> A circumstance which was <HI>never</HI> known to happen, either before or since that time, to <HI>any Brute Animals</HI> whatsoever; so that it is unreasonable to attribute that singular deprivation of <HI>Natural Instinct in Brutes</HI> to <HI>"a Natural Disorder,"</HI> because the circum∣stances of it must necessarily be allowed to have been totally <HI>unnatural to Brutes;</HI> though with mankind, alas! it is far otherwise; for we have almost daily examples of men that are absolutely actuated with the same <HI>violent desire to rush headlong out of the world!</HI> But the reason of of this remarkable difference between <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Brutes</HI> I have already (I hope) sufficiently explained.</P>
<P>Now, if it is unreasonable to attribute this singular destruction of <HI>Brute Animals</HI> to <HI>a Natural Disorder,</HI> it is much more unreasonable, nay, it will appear profane and blasphemous to say, that it <Q>can be ascribed to no other <HI>AGENCY</HI> than that of <HI>GOD,</HI></Q> when we consider that the <HI>Demons,</HI> which are said to have entered the swine, were not <HI>mere nullities,</HI> as this author supposes; not a mere name for deceased Souls, or <HI>the Souls of</HI> DEAD MEN, but are expressly declared by the Evangelist Mark to be UN∣CLEAN SPIRITS! <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Mark v. 13. For if the <HI>Sin against the Holy Ghost</HI> (the most unpardonable of all Blasphemies!) consisted, as many learned commentators have supposed, in attributing the
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>the <HI>Works of</HI> GOD to "<HI>Beelzebub</HI> the <HI>Prince of Demons,"</HI> surely it must be almost equally dangerous to <HI>ascribe to the Agency of</HI> GOD the <HI>furious and profane agitations</HI> occa∣sioned by the inspiration of <HI>unclean Spirits!</HI></P>
<P>But I impeach not <HI>the intention</HI> of the learned author, but only the tendency of his doctrines: his excuse, how∣ever, is already prepared; he doubts (in page 61.) <Q>whe∣ther these epithets</Q> (EVIL and UNCLEAN, given by the Evangelists to the SPIRITS ejected by Christ) <Q>express their <HI>PERSONAL DISPOSITIONS,</HI> or only those <HI>EFFECTS</HI> they were supposed to produce;</Q> nay, even <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (Caco-Demon) with him is "not a <HI>wicked Demon!"</HI> See note in p. 61. And he tells us in another part of his work, p. 352. that <Q>Infirmities, plagues, <HI>and EVIL SPIRITS,</HI> seem to be mentioned only as so many distinct species of <HI>DISEASES.</HI></Q> These suppositions (for they are merely such) may seem at first sight to afford some excuse for his <Q>ascribing to the Agency of <HI>GOD</HI></Q> the declared effects of <Q><HI>unclean</HI> SPIRITS.</Q> But his error has still a deeper root; he has, in another tract <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"An Inquiry into the Nature and Design of Christ's Temptation in the Wilderness." (2d Edit. enlarged).</NOTE>, '<HI>ascribed to the Agency of</HI> GOD' that which no less than three Evangelists have <HI>expressly</HI> registered amongst the transactions of the <HI>Devil himself,</HI> (I mean the <HI>temptation of Christ by the Devil in the wil∣derness</HI>); and he roundly exculpates <HI>Satan</HI> from the charge <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>There was no real Presence</HI> or AGENCY of SATAN (says he) ON THIS OCCASION, <BIBL>p. 63.</BIBL></Q> and that <Q><HI>the DEVIL</HI> was not really and personally present with Christ, but only in mental representation, and consequently could act no part in this whole transaction. <BIBL>P. 62.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; and yet all this is carried on in such smooth
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>language, and with such seeming plausibility, that the author himself is apparently deluded by his own sophistry and mistaken conclusions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>After a great deal of sophistry (in p. 50 to 59) in comparing the Evangelists account of the <HI>Temptation</HI> with several expressions in <HI>Eze∣kiel</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI> relating to the Revelations of <HI>the Spirit;</HI> (viz. as that—<HI>'the Spirit took me up'—lifted me up, and took me away'</HI>—<Q>I was in the Spirit</Q>—<HI>'He carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness,'</HI> &amp;c.) he boldly concludes thereupon in p. 59.—<HI>Thus</HI> (says he) <HI>from</HI> the EXPRESS TESTIMONY <HI>of the</HI> THREE <HI>several Evangelists,</HI> it ap∣pears, <Q>that Christ was conveyed into the wilderness <HI>IN A PROPHETICK VISION, TRANCE, or EXTACY,</HI> under the afflatus or inspiration of the Spirit of God.</Q>—But where has he shewn <Q>the EXPRESS TES∣TIMONY of the <HI>three</HI> several Evangelists, that Christ was <HI>conveyed in</HI> A VISION?</Q> He cannot shew, that even <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>three</HI> has <HI>once</HI> used any such EXPRESSION, or even the least insinuation about a VISION on that occasion. Though the EXPRESSIONS of <HI>Ezekiel</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI> relate to <HI>Revelations received in the way of</HI> VISIONS; yet that does not prove that all similar expressions, wherein the <HI>Spirit</HI> is said to <HI>lift up,</HI> or <HI>take away,</HI> must necessarily be understood as VISIONS. If his argument <HI>proved</HI> any thing at all, it would prove too much. Let us suppose it for once to be perfectly conclusive, and apply it to that text in the Acts of the Apostles, where we read, that—<Q>the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip,</Q> and afterwards that he was <HI>found at Azotus:</HI> shall we say then (to argue like our critic) that—'<HI>this 'passage of Scripture is to be understood as a history, not of a fact, but of a</HI> VISION, p. 64; and that it appears "<HI>from the</HI> EXPRESS TESTIMONY" of the text (though the <HI>text</HI> contains not a single word about a VISION, TRANCE, or EXTACY, any more than the texts of the three Evangelists do about the supposed VISION of Christ) that Philip was <HI>conveyed</HI> in a VISION, that is, his removal was <Q>not <HI>REAL</HI> and <HI>CORPOREAL,</HI> but <HI>SPIRITUAL</HI> and <HI>MENTAL</HI> only, <BIBL>p. 60.</BIBL></Q> notwithstanding that the <HI>text</HI> afterwards asserts it as a FACT, that he was FOUND AT AZOTUS.
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>The circumstances of this transaction necessarily oblige us to under∣stand, that the operation of THE SPIRIT upon <HI>Philip,</HI> when he was "CAUGHT AWAY, was not <HI>visionary,</HI> but REAL; and it will ap∣pear upon further examination, that a similar <HI>necessity</HI> of literal inter∣pretation is <HI>equally</HI> included in the circumstances of the other case also. Now <HI>"if the Spirit of the Lord"</HI> REALLY <HI>"caught away Philip"</HI> from the sight of the eunuch in the desart, and left him at <HI>Azotus,</HI> there is no absurdity in supposing that our Lord himself might also REALLY be <HI>led" by</HI> (or <HI>in</HI>) <Q>the Spirit into the wilderness;</Q> and that the history must <HI>necessarily</HI> be so under∣stood, will, I trust, be hereafter shewn. That it was no unusual thing for the Prophets of God to be actually <HI>"led"</HI>—<HI>"carried"</HI>— or "<HI>caught away," by</HI>—or <HI>in—the Spirit,</HI> is manifest from the ap∣prehension of such a <HI>carrying by the Spirit,</HI> expressed by the generous and faithful <HI>Obadiah,</HI> governor of king <HI>Ahab</HI>'s house, when <HI>Elijah</HI> required him to acquaint his master where he might find him, 1 Kings xviii. 12. and the opinion of <HI>Obadiah,</HI> with respect to the true meaning of such <HI>expressions,</HI> is certainly to be preferred before the sentiments of the author of the <HI>"Inquiry,"</HI> &amp;c. or perhaps than the opinion of any other man whatever, because <HI>Obadiah</HI> was not only per∣sonally acquainted with <HI>Elijah,</HI> but also with a great <HI>many other Pro∣phets of the Lord,</HI> having himself preserved the lives of more than one hundred of them, by hiding and maintaining them in caves, so that he could not be unacquainted with the occasional effects of the HOLY SPIRIT upon <HI>Prophets;</HI> and therefore we may fairly conclude, that his apprehension of the SPIRITS removing or <HI>carrying the Prophet</HI> to a different place, was not without just foundation or example, or at least not without probability, especially as we read, that <HI>Elijah</HI> was at last actually <HI>taken away</HI> in a miraculous manner, which was equally attributed to <HI>"the Spirit of the Lord"</HI> by the sons of the Prophets at <HI>Jericho</HI>—<Q>lest peradventure <HI>(said they) THE SPIRIT OF THE
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>LORD HATH TAKEN HIM UP,</HI> and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. <BIBL>(2 Kings ii. 16.)</BIBL></Q> And they cannot surely be be supposed to mean, that <HI>the Spirit of the Lord</HI> had <HI>taken him up</HI> in a mere <HI>trance</HI> or <HI>vision.</HI></P>

<PB N="186" REF="188"/>do not <HI>express</HI> or <HI>represent</HI> a single word about a VISION in that particular case: nevertheless, our Commentator boldly adds to this monstrous perversion of evidence the following mockery of truth, viz.—<Q>So that to all the other arguments urged above <HI>(says he)</HI> we may add (what we before promised to produce) <HI>THE AUTHORITY OF THE EVANGELISTS</HI></Q> <HI>(whom he most notoriously contradicts)</HI> <Q>and <HI>THE EXPRESS LETTER OF THE TEXT</HI></Q> <HI>(which as notoriously contradicts him)</HI> <Q>in confutation</Q> <HI>(says he)</HI> <Q>of those, who misconstrue Christ's temptation, either as an outward transaction, or as an illusion of Satan. <BIBL>Inquiry, &amp;c. p. 65. See also his proposition, p. 36.</BIBL></Q>—<Q>that all the Evangelists, who have mentioned this affair, do, <HI>IN EXPRESS TERMS,</HI> affirm, that it passed <HI>SPIRITUALLY</HI> and <HI>IN VISION,</HI> that it was <HI>AN IDEAL OR MENTAL REPRESENTATION;</HI> and consequently could not be an outward transaction.</Q> Now, "If such a method of explaining Scripture," (as he himself censures others in, p. 372. of his Essay on the Demoniacks, &amp;c.) <HI>"be allowed,</HI> language can be of no use!"</P>
<P>He may think it a <HI>generous action,</HI> perhaps, to <HI>excuse,</HI> or endeavour to <HI>exculpate</HI> an <HI>Adversary</HI> (and more espe∣cially such an inveterate <HI>Adversary</HI> as <HI>Satan himself</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The author of the <HI>Inquiry,</HI> &amp;c. in p. 3. objects, that <HI>if the Evan∣gelical History of our Lord's Temptation is to be understood as a narrative</HI> OF REAL FACTS, &amp;c. <Q>it is unsuitable to the <HI>SAGACITY</HI> and <HI>POLICY</HI> of the Evil Spirit,</Q> &amp;c.—Now this would certainly be a good ar∣gument, if we could suppose that the <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> is prompted by no other <HI>Principles of Action</HI> than SAGACITY and POLICY; but, alas! he yielded himself a <HI>Slave,</HI> (as frail men do) to <HI>Principles</HI> very op∣posite
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>to SAGACITY and POLICY, or he would surely have <Q>kept his first estate,</Q> and have still remained (as originally created) <Q>an Angel of Light!</Q> And therefore with respect to the particular cir∣cumstances of Christ's temptation EXPRESSLY ascribed to the DEVIL, or SATAN, by three Evangelists, we may reasonably conclude, that our <HI>Spiritual Adversary</HI> was prompted to that unequal contest with Christ by the same predominant <HI>Principles of Evil</HI> (viz. PRIDE, ENVY, and FALSEHOOD) that originally occasioned his <HI>Fall from</HI> GOD; but now occasioned a much more mortifying abasement to Satanical Pride and Envy—<HI>a Defeat by</HI> MAN!—even by <HI>"the seed of the"</HI> (deluded and much injured) <HI>"Woman!"</HI></P>

Yet this was not <HI>a temptation to</HI> SIN; for men if the command had been actually executed, the Patriarch would
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>not have sinned; but, on the contrary, would have been <HI>justified by his faith</HI> in him that commanded, whom he knew to be <HI>the Creator,</HI> and <HI>Lord of</HI> LIFE, and therefore the only rightful disposer of LIFE in all <HI>creatures:</HI> but as the command was revoked just in so critical a time, as to demonstrate the Patriarch's readiness to obey, and yet to save the life of his son, the command was so far from being a <HI>tempta∣tion</HI> to SIN, that it was not (on the part of the righteous Lord who <HI>commanded</HI>) even a <HI>temptation to</HI> KILL, because the event shewed, that the command was not given with any <HI>such intention,</HI> but merely to PROVE the Patriarch's <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>obedience.</HI> The same Hebrew root <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> here rendered <HI>did tempt,</HI> is frequently used in other pas∣sages of Scripture, where it necessarily signifies to <HI>prove</HI> or <HI>try,</HI> as in Exod. xvi. 4.

<PB N="188" REF="190"/></NOTE>, yet they are all clearly to be understood in a different sense from <HI>the</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="191"/><HI>tempting</HI> mentioned by the Apostle James, which was <HI>a tempting,</HI> or being <HI>tempted</HI> of EVIL, apparently meaning a <HI>temptation</HI> to SIN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is an expression, however, in 2 Sam. xxiv. 1. which, without a further explanation, would be very difficult to be reconciled with the text above cited from the Apostle James, that <Q>God cannot be tempted of Evil, neither tempteth be any Man;</Q> for the text in Samuel seems at first sight to imply a <HI>temptation</HI> to SIN by the Al∣mighty.—And again, <HI>the anger of the</HI> LORD <HI>was kindled against Israel: and</HI> HE MOVED DAVID <HI>against them, to say,</HI> <Q>GO, NUMBER ISRAEL <HI>and</HI> JUDAH,</Q> as if God himself had MOVED <HI>David</HI> to sin against Israel, which might seem to give countenance to the doctrine of the Author of the <Q>Inquiry into the Nature and Design of Christ's Tempta∣tion,</Q> viz. that it is represented, <Q>not as <HI>DIABOLICAL,</HI> but <HI>DI∣VINE,</HI> ascribing it to the Spirit of God,</Q>—and that <Q>there was no
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>real Presence or <HI>AGENCY</HI> of <HI>SATAN</HI> on this occasion, <BIBL>p. 63. 65.</BIBL></Q> But we are happily relieved from the difficulty by further information in another text concerning the real AGENT in that temptation or MOVING of <HI>David;</HI> for we read in 1 Chron. xxi. 1. that—<Q><HI>SATAN</HI> stood up against Israel, <HI>and PROVOKED</HI> David</Q> (or MOVED <HI>David,</HI> for the same Hebrew word [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] is used in both texts) <Q>to number Israel;</Q> and therefore, when this text is compared with the former, wherein it is said that <HI>God moved</HI> David, we must necessarily understand, that <HI>the moving</HI> of David was indeed SUPERNATURAL <HI>and</HI> SPIRITUAL, but that the real AGENT (as the Action was <HI>Evil</HI>) was the spiritual Enemy (SATAN) acting by God's <HI>Permission,</HI> as a just judgment against Israel, and also against David himself, who at that time was probably so much elated by his temporal prosperity and successes, as to forget that his absolute dependance ought to be upon God, and not upon the <HI>Number</HI> of his subjects; and certain it is, that he was off his guard, and neglected that necessary vigilance over his <HI>thoughts</HI> and <HI>actions,</HI> which God requires of <HI>all men;</HI> for otherwise he would have <HI>resisted</HI> the EVIL SUGGESTION of Satan, whereas his yielding to it occasioned the <HI>imputation</HI> of sin.</P>
<PB N="189" REF="191"/></NOTE>. And in other passages, where the latter (or indeed any <HI>spiritual influence of</HI> EVIL whatever)
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>is to be understood, the <HI>Evil Spirit,</HI> or real AGENT in the EVIL, is generally mentioned; and in that case the <HI>Agency</HI> cannot be <HI>"ascribed to the Spirit of God,"</HI> without gross absurdity, at least, if not blasphemy! even though the SPIRIT be expressly declared to be <HI>"from the Lord,"</HI> as in the case of Saul related in 1 Sam. xvi. 14. where we read, that <Q>an Evil Spirit <HI>FROM THE LORD</HI> troubled him.</Q></P>
<P>Now this expression, if we regard the literal meaning of it, clearly implies, not only, that the <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> came by the <HI>Permission of</HI> GOD (as it was <Q><HI>an Evil Spirit</HI> FROM THE LORD</Q>)
but also that the said Evil Spirit was really "THE AGENT" which <HI>troubled</HI> Saul.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="193"/>The same ingenious writer has attempted to set aside the literal meaning of this text also, by attributing Saul's disorder to <HI>"a deep melancholy,"</HI> meaning thereby a mere <HI>natural disorder,</HI> without any <HI>supernatural spiritual influence</HI> (for if he admitted the latter as the <HI>cause of Saul's melan∣choly,</HI> he must necessarily give up his whole hypothesis); but the futility of such a supposition shall be clearly shewn hereafter in a separate Tract <HI>on the Case of</HI> Saul, as I have already extended this note to a most unprecedented length; but as the <HI>"Law of Nature,"</HI> and <Q>the Principles of Action in Man,</Q> cannot be understood without a com∣petent knowledge of those <HI>Spiritual Beings,</HI> with which the minds of men are liable to be influenced, I was obliged to take some notice of such contradictions to my general doctrine, as had been previously published by the ingenious Author of the <HI>Essay on Demoniacks;</HI> for I must acknowledge, that I was not aware of them, until my Tract was not only <HI>finished</HI> (as I thought) and sent to the press, but was also more than half printed; and therefore I hope my readers will excuse the irregularity of tacking <HI>so long</HI> a note to <HI>so small</HI> a Tract.</P>
<PB N="175" REF="177"/></NOTE>, to which at all other times
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
<HI>Mankind</HI> alone are subjected;—for <Q>be∣hold</Q> <HI>(says the text)</HI> <Q>the whole herd
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. <BIBL>Matth. viii. 28—32.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="180"/>Thus <HI>the Influence of</HI> EVIL SPIRITS became, manifestly, a <HI>Principle of Action</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
in the poor <HI>Brutes,</HI> which overpowered their <Q>Natural Instinct of Self-preser∣vation,</Q>
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
and hurried them headlong to destruction; and the cause being
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
known, it is very natural to conclude, when we see <HI>similar Effects</HI> in <HI>Human</HI>
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
Beings, that the same <HI>"Principle of Action"</HI> may perhaps have produced
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
them; especially if there be no previous circumstances of <HI>Distemper</HI> or <HI>Distraction,</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
which may leave room to hope, that <HI>another Cause</HI> might reasonably be assign∣ed.
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
And as the example also shews us, that Devils have no power to <HI>enter Brutes</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="188" MS="y"/>
without <HI>express Permission</HI> of the Creator, let us, by a comparative consideration of
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
our own bodies, learn to be continually upon our guard against the devices and
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
instigations of our spiritual Enemies, always remembering, that they need <HI>no
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
such express Permission</HI> from God to enter the <HI>Human</HI> Body; or rather, that God
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
has already lodged the Power of <HI>permit∣ting</HI> or <HI>resisting</HI> them, entirely in the
<PB N="191" REF="193" MS="y"/>
Human Breast; since we are by Nature continually liable to receive <HI>the Inspira∣tion of the Devil and his Angels</HI> as a <HI>"Principle of Action,"</HI> if we neglect the <HI>necessary Resistance</HI> commanded in the Scriptures; and consequently, that they already have <HI>Permission</HI> from God to enter all Human Beings, I mean all those as
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
are capable of discerning between <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> and do not reject the <HI>Evil</HI> as they ought, according to that <HI>Divine Knowledge</HI> which we inherit from our first Parents!</P>
<P>This Peculiarity in our <HI>Nature</HI> is there∣fore apparently the reason why <HI>Spiritual Adversaries</HI> are permitted by the Al∣mighty to approach <HI>Mankind,</HI> though they have no such <HI>general Permission</HI> with respect to the rest of the animal Creation. But Man took the <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil</HI> upon himself, contrary to the ex∣press commands of God, as I have be∣fore remarked; and therefore we have no right to murmur at the Permission which God has granted to <Q>the Devil and his Angels,</Q> to take possession of all unguarded Souls, which unhappily yield to their suggestions and tempta∣tions, without resistance or repentance; and more especially we have no right to mur∣mur
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
(I say) at <HI>this Permission,</HI> if we con∣sider that God has given us fair warning of our continual danger and warfare <HI>with the Principalities and Powers of Darkness;</HI> as the Holy Scriptures plainly inform us, that we are continually liable to Satanical influence; and that the DEVIL will get an advantage over us, if we do not resist him as we ought!—In this <HI>necessary Resistance,</HI> and the objects of it, consist the principal exercise of that assumed <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil,</HI> for which we are accountable; viz. we know <HI>Evil</HI> from <HI>Good,</HI> and consequently know when we ought <HI>to resist;</HI> but if we do not <HI>resist,</HI> then we have <HI>chosen the</HI> EVIL, and (in whatsoever mode the EVIL is manifest) have given <HI>Advantage to the Devil,</HI> and submit ourselves to his <HI>Bondage.</HI> The <HI>Choice</HI> therefore, which is set before us, amounts to this—Whether we will chuse <Q>the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness, <BIBL>(Mat. vi. 33.)</BIBL></Q>
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
and cheerfully <HI>assent</HI> (as the dignity of Human Nature requires) to that <Q>per∣fect Law of Liberty,</Q> which Christ has tendered to us for the regulation of our conduct towards <HI>all Mankind,</HI> as well as for <HI>Self-preservation?</HI> or—Whether we rather prefer the Empire of SATAN, <HI>the spiritual Enemy,</HI> for the sake of those temporal gratifications and vile indul∣gences, by which he holds Men <HI>in Bon∣dage,</HI> through their carnal affections, till they become <HI>personal Enemies, even to themselves!</HI></P>
<P>The assumed Principle of <Q>knowing Good and Evil,</Q> will undoubtedly in∣duce all Mankind most readily to CHUSE <Q>the Kingdom of God, and his Righteous∣ness; <BIBL>(Mat. vi. 33.)</BIBL></Q> but this is not a CHOICE to be made merely <HI>once in our lives,</HI> but to be <HI>continually maintained,</HI> or the prudent CHOICE will avail nothing! Are not Men in general bound by a so∣lemn oath in the outward rite of <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI>
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
thus to <HI>maintain</HI> that prudent CHOICE which they publickly profess? And yet how little do their practices in general correspond with such a resolu∣tion! Surely, <Q>the Mammon of Unright∣eousness, <BIBL><HI>(Luke xvi. 9.)</HI></BIBL></Q> <Q>the <HI>PRINCE</HI> of this World,</Q> that had been <Q>cast out, <BIBL><HI>(John xii. 31.)</HI></BIBL></Q> <Q>the Principalities, Powers, <HI>and</HI> Rulers of the Darkness of this World, <HI>(not FLESH AND BLOOD)</HI></Q> with whom we <HI>have to</HI> WRESTLE, do apparently prevail over a great multitude in every rank of life! For, <Q>this is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men loved <HI>DARKNESS</HI> rather than <HI>LIGHT,</HI></Q> (a lamentable <HI>Choice!</HI> a shameful prostitution of the <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil!</HI> but the Apostle assigns the reason) <Q>because,</Q> (says he) <Q>their Deeds were <HI>EVIL.</HI> For every one that doeth <HI>EVIL,</HI> hateth the <HI>LIGHT,</HI> neither cometh to the <HI>LIGHT,</HI> lest his Deeds should be reproved. But
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
he that doeth the Truth, cometh to the <HI>LIGHT,</HI> that his Deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought <HI>IN GOD.</HI> <BIBL>John iii. 19. to 21.)</BIBL></Q> Let us therefore be upon our guard, and <Q>put on the whole Armour of God, that <HI>(we)</HI> may be able to stand against the <HI>WILES OF THE DEVIL.</HI> <BIBL>(Ephes. vi. 11.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>But though Human Nature is thus liable to the Influence of <Q>the Devil and his Angels,</Q> let us remember at the same time for our comfort, that it <HI>is equally capable</HI> of being actuated by DIVINE INSPIRATION; and that Man∣kind (in the glorious FREEDOM of the Gospel) are equally left to <HI>their</HI> CHOICE for the admission of that supreme Good, "THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST," to regulate their <HI>Principles of Action</HI> in all cases, as they are for the admission of the contrary Spirit, <Q>the Prince of Darkness!</Q> For <HI>the Promises of</HI> CHRIST relating to that <HI>heavenly Gift</HI> are clear
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
and absolute, and are tendered to all Mankind without exception, that they may exercise their <HI>natural Knowledge of</HI> GOOD <HI>and</HI> EVIL, in CHUSING, ACCEPT∣ING, and <HI>continually</HI> CLAIMING them, if they really prefer <HI>"the Kingdom of God"</HI> to <HI>"the Kingdom of this World!"</HI> Here is true Freedom! a Charter of inestimable <HI>Privileges!</HI> <Q><HI>ASK,</HI> and it shall be <HI>GIVEN YOU; SEEK,</HI> and ye shall <HI>FIND;</HI> knock, and it shall be <HI>OPENED</HI> unto you, &amp;c. <BIBL>(Mat. vii. 7.)</BIBL></Q> And again, <HI>"All things whatsoever ye shall</HI> ASK IN PRAYER, <HI>be∣lieving, ye shall receive."</HI> (Mat. xxi. 22. and Mark xi. 24.) And after these ge∣neral promises, our Lord appealed to <HI>the common Sense</HI> of his hearers concerning the efficacy of a son's request to a <HI>natural Father,</HI> to obtain things that are neces∣sary for him; and concludes thereupon —<Q>If ye then being <HI>EVIL,</HI> know how to give <HI>GOOD GIFTS</HI> to your Children: <HI>HOW MUCH MORE</HI> shall your heavenly Father <HI>GIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT</HI> to
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
them that <HI>ASK HIM?</HI> <BIBL>(Luke xi. 9. to 13.)</BIBL></Q> So that every Man, who de∣voutly, and with due Faith, claims that glorious GIFT according to <HI>the Promise,</HI> and with such a disposition of mind as the Scriptures require, will undoubtedly receive it, <HI>"for he is faithful that pro∣mised."</HI> Heb. x. 23.</P>
<P>I am well aware how uncommon it is to introduce these religious topicks into <HI>Tracts of Law,</HI> but as <HI>the Divine Influ∣ence of</HI> THE HOLY SPIRIT <HI>upon Man∣kind</HI> may certainly be esteemed <HI>the su∣preme "Principle of Action in Man,"</HI> I am obliged, by the nature of my sub∣ject, to cite some testimonies concerning the general effect of that heavenly Gift, to which all Mankind are entitled; for such is the <HI>compound Nature of Man,</HI> that Enquiries concerning <Q>Human Nature,</Q> and <Q>the Principles of Hu∣man Actions,</Q> cannot be fairly and
<PB N="199" REF="201" MS="y"/>
carefully defined, without a careful exa∣mination of this <HI>Human Claim</HI> to DIVINE INSPIRATION; nor indeed without a careful warning also against that very opposite and foreign <HI>Spiritual Influence,</HI> which is equally liable to alter <HI>Human Nature,</HI> and become <Q>the Principle of Action;</Q> which I hope I have already sufficiently proved from Scripture. And therefore with respect to the former, viz. the <HI>inestimable Claim to Divine Inspiration</HI> which we hold in CHRIST, it is proper to be remarked, that the peculiar and necessary Effect of that <HI>glorious and hea∣venly Gift,</HI> is a total change in the <HI>Nature of Man</HI> (from his fallen State, before described, to <Q>A NEW CREA∣TURE</Q>) by <HI>a Regeneration</HI> or <HI>New Birth</HI> through THE SPIRIT; to which God has also been pleased to annex (as necessary on our <HI>first publick Admission</HI> to the Claims and Privileges of the Gospel) <HI>an outward visible Sign</HI> also, or
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
typical Washing with <HI>Water</HI> <NOTE N="(77)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Verily—Verily, I say unto thee,</Q> <HI>(said our Lord to the Jewish Ruler, Nicodemus)</HI> <Q>Except a Man be born of <HI>WATER</HI> and of <HI>THE SPIRIT,</HI> he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. <BIBL>John iii. 5.</BIBL></Q> Here are two distinct articles expressly mentioned by our Lord, as ne∣cessary to salvation, viz. 1st. <HI>Water,</HI> by which we outwardly profess our Faith, <Q>in the Name of the Father, <HI>and</HI> of the Son, <HI>and</HI> of the Holy Ghost,</Q> upon our first admis∣sion into Christ's church; for that is the <HI>Form</HI> of Baptism afterwards expressly ordained by Christ himself. (Matt. xxviii. 19.) and 2dly, <HI>the Holy Spirit,</HI> which we claim of <HI>the Father,</HI> in the name and through the merits <HI>of the Son;</HI> so that Faith in all the Three Divine Persons is un∣doubtedly necessary to constitute that <HI>Spiritual Regenera∣tion,</HI> without which no Man can enter into <HI>the Kingdom of God;</HI> and as FAITH therefore must precede, we may clearly perceive the reason why WATER (the outward sign of initiation to the publick profession of that necessary FAITH) is first mentioned.</P></NOTE>; by which we bear a publick or outward testimony of that <HI>true Faith,</HI> which alone can qualify our claim to the pro∣mise.</P>
<P>Thus Man, through the privileges of the Gospel, becomes "A NEW CREA∣TURE," (2 Cor. v. 17.) and partakes even of THE DIVINE NATURE, if his
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
own earnest and sincere endeavours are not wanting; for the Apostle PETER has expressly declared, that this is one of the effects of our Lord's most gra∣cious promises. <Q>Grace and Peace be multiplied unto you <HI>(said the Apostle)</HI> through the Knowledge of <HI>GOD,</HI> and of <HI>JESUS OUR LORD,</HI> according as his <HI>DIVINE POWER</HI> hath given unto us all things that <HI>(pertain)</HI> unto Life and Godliness, through the Knowledge of him that hath called us <HI>TO GLORY</HI> and <HI>VIRTUE:</HI> whereby are given unto us <HI>EXCEEDING GREAT AND PRECIOUS PROMISES;</HI> that by these ye might be <HI>PARTAKERS</HI> of the <HI>DIVINE NATURE</HI> (ΚΟΝΩΝΟΙ) having escaped the Corruption that is in the World through Lust. <BIBL>(2 Pet. i. 2. to 4.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Hence the Dignity and Superiority of MAN over the rest of the visible
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
Creation is manifest! We not only pos∣sess, by <HI>natural Inheritance</HI> from our first Parents, a DIVINE ATTRIBUTE (as I have already shewn in the former part of this Tract) viz. the <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil;</HI> but also, by a right use of <HI>that Knowledge,</HI> in CHUSING and pre∣ferring the <HI>Good,</HI> and in REJECTING and <HI>resisting</HI> the <HI>Evil,</HI> we are capable also (<HI>through</HI> CHRIST) of PARTAKING "<HI>even of the</HI> DIVINE NATURE;" so that if we consider this most extraordi∣nary <HI>Privilege,</HI> which is tendered to us on the one hand, and that <HI>deplorable Condition</HI> on the other hand, which we shall probably fall into, if we neglect it (viz. the partaking of <HI>the Diabolical Na∣ture</HI> by the inspiration of the <HI>Devil and his Angels;</HI> to which, as I have already shewn, we are continually liable, if we do not watch, and resist); it must be be evident that MAN is either the <HI>most

<P>Perhaps they will say—<Q>We do ask the assistance of God's Holy Spirit, and have as good a Right as others to sup∣pose that God's Promise is fulfilled in us;</Q> nevertheless they must allow, that FAITH is necessary for those who ASK; and how can Men be said to have the NECESSARY FAITH, who form to themselves notions of God's HOLY SPI∣RIT, which are totally inconsistent with the DIVINE NATURE?</P>

Belief in the HOLY TRINITY were set aside, the greatest part of those sacred Writings would become utterly unin∣telligible to us; because they must, in that case, seem to contain the grossest contradictions, as there are passages, which, without that necessary doctrine, would surely appear <HI>inconsistent with grammar and common sense!</HI> The doc∣trine of the HOLY TRINITY is ex∣pressed in the Articles and Liturgy of <HI>the Church of England</HI> in such guarded terms, as cannot easily be misconstrued and perverted: and though a certain set of men may pretend to found their ob∣jections to <HI>the Church of England</HI> on some other Articles of less moment, yet I am thoroughly persuaded, that the said <HI>guarded Terms,</HI> concerning <HI>that</HI> ONE <HI>ne∣cessary Doctrine,</HI> are the principal causes of offence to many of those mistaken Clergymen, who lately petitioned Parlia∣ment that they might be exempted from

Subscription <NOTE N="(80)" PLACE="foot"><P>It is reasonable and just, indeed, that all men should be at <HI>liberty</HI> to teach and profess whatever religious opinions they think <HI>most consistent with the Holy Scrip∣tures</HI> (if we except any publick promulgation of that religion, which offends against the laws of <HI>this nation,</HI> as a civil society, by asserting a <HI>foreign jurisdiction;</HI> and which has also unhappily adopted some <HI>antichristian</HI> rites of <HI>idolatry, sorcery,</HI> and <HI>inchantments!</HI></P>
<P>But the petitioners cannot allege that they are not <HI>already</HI> AT LIBERTY to bear a publick testimony of their opinions; and it would be dangerous even to the <HI>true reli∣gion,</HI> were not SUCH LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE allow∣ed: for supposing any material alteration should be per∣mitted to be made in the Articles and Liturgy of <HI>the Church of England,</HI> a great majority, perhaps, of the pre∣sent churchmen might think themselves obliged to dissent, and separate from what would then be called, <HI>the Esta∣blished Church;</HI> and would certainly think themselves in∣titled to a free toleration, and a public use of <HI>the present Liturgy</HI> in their several separate congregations.</P>
<P>I am therefore a sincere advocate for LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE; but when a majority of the clergy and people have agreed upon the Articles of their Faith, and established the same as the <HI>National Profession of Religion,</HI> (which it surely is while the <HI>majority</HI> continue of that opinion) it is certainly no unjust restraint nor derogation from that NECESSARY LIBERTY above-mentioned, that those who are to be admitted public teachers of the <HI>national Profession,</HI> should be required to <HI>subscribe</HI> a declaration

For other∣wise the uniformity of doctrine would be banished from the pulpits, and the peace of congregations would be continually disturbed by the broaching of undigested no∣tions diametrically opposite to the general and established opinions of the people; and even the publick Form of Prayer would be reduced and moulded according to the caprice of every officiating minister; for there can be no <HI>Church Government</HI> without a <HI>written Test of Doctrine,</HI> couched in such terms as are least liable to misconstruction and equivocation.

<P>Thus it appears, that <HI>the Messenger</HI> (whom our Lord himself declared to be <HI>John the Baptist</HI>) was to be sent to prepare the Way before JEHOVAH OF
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
HOSTS, the same Divine Being who SPOKE by the Prophet, <Q>Behold, I will send <HI>MY</HI> Messenger, and he shall prepare the Way before <HI>ME.</HI></Q> But our Lord himself, in referring to this Passage, varies a little from the Original, by making a Distinction <HI>of Persons</HI> between <HI>the Lord</HI> (or <HI>Jehovah of Hosts</HI>) who spoke, and the Divine Person before whom the Messenger was to prepare the Way—<Q>Behold, I send <HI>MY</HI> Messenger before <HI>THY</HI> Face, <HI>which shall prepare THY</HI> Way before <HI>THEE.</HI> <BIBL>Matt. xi. 10.</BIBL></Q> This Variation from the first to the se∣cond Person, from <HI>my</HI> to <HI>thy,</HI> and from <HI>me</HI> to <HI>thee,</HI> proves that Christ (for it cannot be applied to any other but Christ and Jehovah) was indeed the Person before whom the <HI>Messenger,</HI> John, was to prepare the Way; and the original Text (which undoubtedly is also a true Reading in this Place, as it perfectly corresponds with all the ancient Ver∣sions)
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
proves at the same time, that <HI>the Way</HI> was to be prepared for <HI>Jehovah,</HI> who said, <HI>Behold,</HI> I will <HI>send</HI> MY <HI>Mes∣senger, and he shall prepare the</HI> Way <HI>before</HI> ME; and consequently it appears, by comparing both Texts, that CHRIST is included in the Eternal Being JE∣HOVAH. The Socinians endeavour to evade this Testimony of the Scripture concerning <HI>the Divine Nature</HI> of the Messiah, by supposing that he is called <HI>Jehovah</HI> only in a <HI>relative</HI> Sense, as being <HI>the Prophet,</HI> or <HI>Ambassador of</HI> JEHOVAH, <HI>the Representative being named for the Prin∣cipal.</HI> In like manner, for Instance (say they) as he that <HI>despiseth Christ's Messen∣gers,</HI> is said to <HI>despise Christ himself; and he that despiseth him, despiseth also him that sent him.</HI> Luke x. 16. <HI>And he that lied to the Apostles, lied to God.</HI> Acts v. 4.</P>
<P>In these and such like Passages, in∣deed, the <HI>relative</HI> Sense is manifest; and
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
it may also, in a certain degree, be ad∣mitted in the Construction of the Text in question, but yet not so as to favour the Socinian Argument in the least re∣spect whatsoever.</P>
<P>The Prophecy, for instance, concern∣ing <HI>the Messenger</HI> therein mentioned (of whom JEHOVAH said,—"<HI>he shall pre∣pare the Way before</HI> ME) was fulfilled in the Person of John the Baptist, as our Lord himself declared (see Note in p. 227.); and therefore, according to the <HI>Socinian</HI> Method of Argument, it might indeed be said of those worldly Men, who despised that extraordinary <HI>Mes∣senger</HI> of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and neglected the Doctrine of Repentance, which he en∣forced; that they, in so doing, <HI>despised the Lord Jehovah,</HI> by whom this Mes∣senger was sent; and, on the other hand, those Jews, who readily received John's Doctrine of Repentance, and attended
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
diligently to his Instructions, may, in the like relative Sense, be said to <HI>honour Jehovah,</HI> by paying due Respect to his Messenger. But a mere <HI>relative Honour,</HI> such as might lawfully be given to the <HI>Messenger of Jehovah,</HI> will bear no Com∣parison with <HI>the Honour</HI> that is due to <HI>Jehovah</HI> himself:—the latter must be supream <HI>Honour and Worship,</HI> whereas the former amounts only to <HI>Respect, At∣tention,</HI> and <HI>good Offices,</HI> for whatever is more than these must lead to Idolatry; so that the Comparison can be carried no farther.</P>
<P>A Messenger of <HI>Jehovah</HI> cannot, there∣fore, merely as such, be allowed <HI>the Name of</HI> JEHOVAH, because this would entitle him also to <HI>the Honour</HI> that is due to JEHOVAH alone; so that when Jeho∣vah said, <Q>MY <HI>Messenger</HI></Q>—<Q><HI>he</HI> shall prepare the <HI>Way</HI> BEFORE ME,</Q> he must mean (if Language has any Use)
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
that the <HI>Messenger</HI> was to prepare the Way for the Advent of <HI>Jehovah</HI> himself, who could not be said to come in the Person of any <HI>Messenger,</HI> or Ambassador whatsoever, except in one of the Divine Persons that are manifestly included in the same Eternal BEING, and conse∣quently are entitled to the <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> as well as to the <HI>Name,</HI> of JE∣HOVAH! This glorious Title JEHOVAH is no where in Scripture attributed to any Person whatever, that is not thus included in the Unity of the Godhead, neither can it be without Blasphemy (so that the Socinian Argument must fall to the Ground) because it is the distin∣guishing Title of the supreme Divine Nature!—<Q><HI>Thou, whose Name alone</HI> (is) JEHOVA (art) the most High over all the Earth. <BIBL>Psal. lxxxiii. 18.</BIBL></Q> or it should rather be rendered, as we find it in the old English Versions—<HI>Thou whose
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
Name is</HI> JEHOVAH, <HI>art</HI> ONLY (or alone) <HI>the most High,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Division of the Sentence is agree∣able to all the ancient Versions, except the Syriac; but, in either way of tran∣slating, the Name of JEHOVAH is ma∣nifestly given as <HI>the distinguishing Title of the supreme</HI> GOD; and cannot therefore be attributed to any Person whatever, that is not <HI>truly God,</HI> because the said Distinction would be destroyed, if the Name was ever used merely in that rela∣tive Sense for which the Socinians con∣tend: Proper Names, indeed, were fre∣quently formed or compounded with that Holy Name, by having it prefixed, or postfixed, to some other Word, ap∣parently with an Intention to distinguish <HI>the Servants of</HI> JEHOVAH <NOTE N="(97)" PLACE="foot">See my Remarks concerning the Names <HI>Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin,</HI> and <HI>Zedekiah,</HI> in my Tract on <Q>the Law of Retribution, <BIBL>p. 47.</BIBL></Q> <HI>Note</HI> 101. 109, 110, and 166.</NOTE>; but the

peculiar and incommunicable Name itself has never been mentioned by any of the Sacred Writers in such a manner, as to refer us either in direct Terms, or by necessary Implication, to any other Persons whatsoever, besides those of the Holy Trinity; and, on the other hand, with respect to Christ, it is not only <HI>the Name</HI> of JEHOVAH that is re∣ferred to him by the necessary Inter∣pretation of several incontestable Pas∣sages of Scripture; but also the <HI>Power</HI> <NOTE N="(98)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>And Jesus came and spake unto them</Q> <HI>(his Dis∣ciples)</HI> <Q>saying, <HI>ALL POWER</HI> is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth—Go ye, therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the <HI>NAME</HI> of the <HI>FATHER,</HI> and of the <HI>SON,</HI> and of the <HI>HOLY GHOST.</HI> <BIBL>Matt. xxviii. 18, 19.</BIBL></Q> <Q>For as the Father raiseth up the Dead, and quickeneth <HI>(them)</HI> even so the <HI>SON</HI> quickeneth whom he will. <BIBL>John v. 21.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE>, the <HI>Honour</HI> <NOTE N="(99)" PLACE="foot"><Q>For the <HI>FATHER</HI> judgeth no Man; but hath com∣mitted <HI>ALL JUDGMENT</HI> unto the <HI>SON:</HI> that all <HI>(Men)</HI> should <HI>HONOUR</HI> the <HI>SON,</HI> even as they <HI>HONOUR</HI> the <HI>FATHER.</HI> He that <HI>HONOURETH</HI> not the <HI>SON, HO∣NOURETH</HI> not the <HI>FATHER</HI> which hath sent him. <BIBL>John v. 22▪ 23.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, and the <HI>Glory</HI>

<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
Men, who deny that OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, and THE HOLY GHOST, par∣take of the <HI>same Divine Nature</HI> with THE FATHER, do manifestly and ne∣cessarily include the supposition of a <HI>superior</HI> and <HI>inferior</HI> order of DIVINE EX∣ISTENCE (for that all the Three Persons have <HI>Divine Existence</HI> and <HI>Divine Attri∣butes</HI> cannot be denied, without setting aside the whole tenour of the Holy Scriptures) which EXISTENCE could not, without absurdity, be called <HI>one</HI> and <HI>the same,</HI> but must necessarily be esteemed <HI>several,</HI> or <HI>separate</HI> and <HI>different,</HI> if the least degree of <HI>Inequality</HI> with respect to the <HI>Divine Nature</HI> be ad∣mitted; and therefore <HI>such Doctrines</HI> are totally inconsistent with our indispensable Belief in <HI>the Unity of God,</HI> whatsoever those mistaken people, who call them∣selves <HI>Unitarians,</HI> may think!</P>
<P>But a due regard to these two necessary distinctions, viz. the <HI>Equality</HI> and <HI>Unity</HI>
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
(as there is but ONE GOD) of the THREE Persons with respect to their <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> and the revealed subordi∣nation of TWO of them with respect to the merciful and gracious OFFICES of <HI>Redemption</HI> and <HI>Sanctification,</HI> whereby they are <HI>personally</HI> distinguished and made known to us in Scripture;—a due regard to these <HI>two necessary distinctions</HI> (I say) and to the proper application of the several texts by which <HI>both</HI> are respec∣tively proved, will clearly demonstrate (at least to all Men who sincerely <HI>ask</HI> and <HI>seek</HI> the knowledge of Truth, as Christ has commanded) that <HI>the Doctrine of the Trinity,</HI> as received by THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND, is strictly con∣sistent with the indispensable doctrine of Scripture before-mentioned concern∣ing the <HI>Unity of God.</HI></P>
<P>That there are <HI>Three</HI> distinct Persons in that <HI>One</HI> ETERNAL BEING, or JE∣HOVAH, is clearly revealed in Scripture;
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
for each Person is occasionally mentioned under that distinguishing and peculiar Name of <HI>the Supreme God.</HI></P>
<P>And first, with respect to the <HI>first</HI> Divine Person in the Holy Trinity.— In the 42d chapter of Isaiah, the Divine Person, whom the Prophet represents in the 6th verse, as speaking in the name of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> is clearly distinguished from the MESSIAH and HOLY SPIRIT; and though it may seem a needless work to produce any proofs that the Almighty Father, <Q>THE GOD <HI>and</HI> FATHER <HI>of our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST <NOTE N="(102)" PLACE="foot"><P>Ephes. i. 3. See also the 17th verse—<Q>The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory.</Q> Our Lord himself likewise said unto Mary Magdalene, after he arose from the dead,—<Q>Go to my <HI>BRETHREN,</HI> and say unto them, I ascend unto <HI>MY FATHER,</HI> and <HI>YOUR FATHER,</HI> and to <HI>MY GOD,</HI> and YOUR GOD. <BIBL>John xx. 17.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE>,</Q> is truly JEHOVAH (which no Man will deny) yet I propose to recite some parts of this chapter, in order to prove the
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
clear distinction of <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>their Offices,</HI> as revealed even in the Old Testament.—<Q>Thus saith <HI>GOD JEHO∣VAH,</HI> he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and Spirit to them that walk therein: I <HI>JEHOVAH</HI> have called <HI>THEE</HI></Q> <HI>(apparently meaning the MES∣SIAH)</HI> <Q>in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, and for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, <HI>(and)</HI> them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house. <HI>I AM JEHOVAH;</HI> that <HI>(is) MY NAME:</HI> and <HI>MY GLORY WILL I NOT GIVE TO ANOTHER,</HI> &amp;c. <BIBL>Isai. xlii. 5—8.</BIBL></Q> These words of JEHOVAH are manifestly addressed to the MESSIAH, as a <HI>distinct</HI> Person, in his mediatorial Office of Redeemer; and
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
the Divine Person, who thus addresses <HI>the Messiah,</HI> is manifestly the same that speaks in the first verse of the same chapter, and mentions both THE MES∣SIAH and the HOLY SPIRIT in that one sentence <HI>as distinct</HI> PERSONS FROM HIM∣SELF, and under different and distinct characters or offices of the Christian Dis∣pensation, suitable to the nature of that extraordinary prophecy concerning the future Redemption of Mankind! <Q>Be∣hold, <HI>MY SERVANT,</HI></Q> <HI>(apparently meaning the MESSIAH in his state of humiliation as SON OF MAN)</HI> <Q>whom I uphold; mine Elect <HI>(in whom)</HI> my Soul delighteth; I have put <HI>MY SPIRIT</HI> upon <HI>HIM:</HI></Q> <HI>(Here the Three Persons are distinctly expressed)</HI> <Q>He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles! He shall not cry, not lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall he not break, &amp;c. <BIBL>Isai. xlii. 1—3.</BIBL></Q> Thus we find <HI>the Office</HI> of THE
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
MESSIAH particularly described in this chapter, as well as the descent of THE HOLY SPIRIT upon HIM: and this is expressly foretold by the <HI>Lord</HI> JEHOVAH, who speaks of <HI>himself distinctly from the other two;</HI> so that the distinction of Per∣sons is hereby clearly manifested.</P>
<P>Secondly, The glorious Name of <HI>the supreme God</HI> JEHOVAH, is plainly attri∣buted, in the 40th chapter of Isaiah, to the Second Person, <HI>the Divine Messiah,</HI> in his <HI>Pastoral</HI> Office, as <Q>Shepherd of Israel.</Q></P>
<P>The peculiar Harbinger or Forerunner of the Messiah is described and foretold in the third verse, as the Forerunner also of JEHOVAH—<Q>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the <HI>WAY</HI> of the <HI>LORD</HI></Q> <HI>(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> THE WAY OF JEHOVAH)</HI> <Q>make straight in the desert a <HI>HIGHWAY</HI> for <HI>OUR GOD.</HI> <BIBL>(3d verse).</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="251"/>And John the Baptist, in whom alone that prophecy could be fulfilled (as I have shewn more particularly in my Tract on Prophecy <NOTE N="(103)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Remarks on several very important Prophecies. <BIBL><HI>2d Edit. p. 177—189.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>) declared the identity of the Divine Person whom <HI>he preceded</HI> in the world, and whose WAY he was SENT TO PREPARE, saying,— <Q>He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the <HI>HOLY GHOST,</HI> and with Fire. <BIBL>Matt. iii. 11.</BIBL></Q> — And afterwards, when the Priests and Levites (those that were sent from Jerusalem to ask him, <Q>Who art thou</Q>) questioned him, saying, <Q>Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that <HI>CHRIST,</HI> nor <HI>ELIAS,</HI> neither that <HI>PROPHET?

B. HAR∣WOOD▪ D. D. published at London, in the present year 1766, wherein (contrary to the general evidence of the 
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>best Greek MSS.) the editor has boldly ventured to alter the common reading of this text, and to insert the <HI>mas∣culin̄e</HI> article <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>(This)</HI> instead of the substantive <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>God.</HI> Had he added an accent to the article, in order to render It <HI>neuter;</HI> viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, instead of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (<HI>which</HI> instead of <HI>this</HI>) his NEW TEXT would have seemed rather more probable; because <HI>the article</HI> (which at present is without <HI>a Substan∣tive</HI>) would, in that case, have agreed with the preceding noun substantive of the <HI>neuter</HI> gender (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>), and would also have been countenanced by the <HI>neuter</HI> relative <HI>(quod)</HI> in the <HI>Latin Vulgate.</HI> This remark proves, also, that accents, in some particular cases, are essential to the meaning, and proper construction of the text, and should not, therefore, be indiscriminately omitted, together with such as are useless, as they are in this edition. But, in∣deed, in either way (with or without the accent) the expression, which he has introduced into the text, is en∣tirely unscriptural! Even, if (to make the best of it) we should suppose that the <HI>accent</HI> is to be <HI>understood,</HI> and the article to be construed as if written <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—what sense can be made of it?

<P>As the Editor, in his Preface, appeals to God con∣cerning his <HI>Sincerity</HI> and <HI>Integrity,</HI> it would be uncha∣ritable to call either of these in question; but we are not bound to think so favourably of his <HI>Discretion!</HI>—The zeal, which he has expressed at the end of his Book for the opinions of <HI>the Polish Brethren</HI> (who were most notorious SOCINIANS) gives us too much cause to suspect not only his want of <HI>Discretion,</HI> but also such <HI>a want of Moderation</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>and <HI>Impartiality,</HI> as must render him totally unfit to DECIDE for us in the choice of controverted readings of the Holy Scriptures; and consequently the preference which he has paid to his <HI>own Opinion,</HI> by arbitrarily taking upon himself <HI>to alter Records</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The particular <HI>alteration,</HI> of which I complain at present, has but <HI>one single Greek manuscript</HI> to support it; and, what is worse, even this <HI>single</HI> MS. is not a <HI>credible Evidence!</HI> For it has been condemned in the <HI>strongest</HI> terms by the most eminent criticks and judges of ancient MSS. in Europe.

<PB N="255" REF="257"/>to his own caprice!</Q> The very learned GER.

And I hope these few hints will induce the learned among the Clergy (who ought to be the Guardians of the Sacred Text) to examine Dr. Harwood's <HI>New Text</HI> with care and accuracy, to point out its errors to the publick, and to consider of the best means to prevent any ill effects from so dangerout an attack upon the <HI>Sacred Records!</HI></P>
<PB N="254" REF="256"/></NOTE> of so much importance, must, at best, be esteemed a dangerous presumption! His indiscriminate and unjust censure of the doctrine of <HI>Atha∣nasius</HI> (which he has been pleased to intitle—<Q>The Atha∣nasian
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>Impiety of Three Co-equal Gods, <BIBL>Vol. II. p. 284.</BIBL></Q>) is a sufficient proof of the <HI>Intemperance of his Zeal,</HI> and the <HI>Hastiness of his Conclusions;</HI> so that THE ADVEN∣TUROUS VARIATIONS which he has made from the com∣mon Greek Text will gain but little credit by his autho∣rity! Athanasius was a steady assertor of THE UNITY OF GOD, and could not, therefore, be guilty of so shock∣ing an "IMPIETY," as to assert the Existence <Q>of Three Co-equal Gods!</Q> And if the Doctor meant only

It therefore evidently appears, that <HI>the way was to be prepared for</HI> JEHOVAH; and indeed the prediction was fulfilled in the most exact, literal sense: for when this extraor∣dinary Messenger was questioned by his own disciples, and the Jews, concerning JESUS, saying—<Q>he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou bearest witness, behold the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</Q> John shewed them, that their report of the in∣creasing power and fame of Christ contained nothing contradictory to the testimony which he had always borne concerning his own office and calling—<Q>Ye yourselves <HI>(said he)</HI> bear me witness that I said, I am not <HI>THE CHRIST,</HI> but that I am sent before him,</Q> (that is, before the Christ or Messiah). And after assuring them, that Christ must increase, saying, <HI>"he must increase, but I</HI> (must) <HI>decrease,"</HI> he added the highest testimony that could be given of Christ's heavenly Power and Divine Existence, (such a testimony as became that extra∣ordinary Messenger, who was sent <HI>to prepare the way of Jehovah</HI>), saying, "<HI>he that cometh from above,</HI> IS ABOVE ALL;" which ex∣pression cannot, with propriety, be applied to any person that is not really and truly <HI>Jehovah!</HI> John iii. 26—31.</P>

<P><PB N="282" REF="284"/>Now it must be allowed that none, except <Q>the God of Israel, whose name alone is <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> <BIBL>(Psa. lxxxiii. 18.)</BIBL></Q> can justly be said to be ABOVE ALL! —So that if THE MESSIAH was not truly GOD, and included with the <HI>Al∣mighty Father</HI> and <HI>the Holy Ghost</HI> in the Eternal BEING, JEHOVAH, this expres∣sion (that he "IS ABOVE ALL") could not, with the least propriety, be so pe∣remptorily

(John x. 30.) and yet this very sentence, which asserts THE UNITY of the Father and the Son, expresses at the same time a manifest <HI>Distinction of Persons;</HI> which is also clearly demonstrable in almost every other page of Scripture; though the doctrine of the <HI>Unity</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is not less clearly laid down and inculcated throughout the Scriptures!</P>

<P>Thus all true believers in Christ, by being accounted <HI>"Abraham's Seed,"</HI> are included in the <HI>Spiritual Israel,</HI> and are esteemed ONE in Christ; that is, ONE <HI>Catholick Church,</HI> but not ONE <HI>Jehovah;</HI> for in the peculiar <HI>Unity</HI> of the latter, none can be included, except the Three Divine Persons, to whom alone the supreme Title JE∣HOVAH is distinctly attributed in the Scriptures!</P>
<P>My reason for making this remark is, that some learned Men, in their Comments on Jeremiah xxxiii. 16. (viz. Grotius, Vitringa, and several others) have applied to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> that glorious Title, which the Scriptures have given to Christ alone; viz. "JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTE∣OUSNESS! The learned and Rev. Mr. William Lowth (formerly Prebendary of Winchester) in his Commentary on Jeremiah, p. 293. also applies it to <Q><HI>JERUSALEM,</HI> that is <HI>(says he)</HI> to the <HI>CHURCH,</HI></Q> &amp;c. The learned
<PB N="297" REF="299"/>Authors of our last excellent English Version have like∣wise unhappily fallen into the same error (though the older English Versions were clear from it) and have ren∣dered the passage as follows—<Q><HI>And this</HI> (is the name) <HI>wherewith</HI> SHE <HI>shall be called,</HI> THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</Q> So Vitringa—<Q><HI>Hoc est</HI> (No∣men) <HI>quo</HI> IPSA <HI>denominabitur,</HI> JEHOVA JUSTITIA NOSTRA. <BIBL>(Anacrisis Apocalypsios, p. 188.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>But the Hebrew Text will bear no such construction, insomuch that the abovementioned Translators have been obliged to <HI>interpolate</HI> their respective Versions of this passage with words that have <HI>nothing to answer them in the original,</HI> in order to make up that imaginary sense of it, which they have erroneously adopted! for they supply the words <HI>"is the name"</HI> and "NOMEN," for which there is not the least authority in the original Text! Supplementary words are never allowable in translations from the Hebrew Scriptures, unless they are absolutely <HI>necessary</HI> to render the sense compleat by filling up such a vacuum in the English Expression as sometimes arises from the difference of idiom in the two Languages; but they are very far from being <HI>necessary</HI> in the Text before us, which will appear by two plain Circumstances, viz.—1st. That <HI>a literal rendering</HI> of the Hebrew in this Text into English affords <HI>an intelligible and just construction</HI> without that <HI>interpolation,</HI> so that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here can be no reason or authority whatever for making
<PB N="298" REF="300"/>it!—And 2dly. That the Words supplied by the Translators have led them (for they could not have so rendered the Hebrew Text without them) to attribute to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> that glorious Title, which in the Parallel Passage of Jeremiah (Ch. xxiii. 5, 6, as well as in the Text before us) apparently belongs to the <HI>Righteous</HI> Branch of David, <HI>the King</HI> that should reign and execute Judgement and <HI>Righteousness</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) in the earth; so that the passage instead of being (as in the Hebrew Bible) <HI>parallel</HI> to the former<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the former passage (Jer. xxiii. 5, 6.) the RIGHTEOUS <HI>Branch</HI> of the House of David, <HI>the King</HI> that was to <HI>reign,</HI> and <HI>do judgement</HI> and RIGHTEOUSNESS <HI>in the Land,</HI> is manifestly called "JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."—<HI>"In</HI> HIS <HI>days"</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, here is a <HI>masculine</HI> relative plainly refering back to the substantive <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—<HI>King,</HI> in the preceding sentence) <HI>"Judah shall be saved"</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—feminine—i. e.

<PB N="299" REF="301"/>to <HI>both</HI> Texts, and therefore we must abide by <HI>the Letter</HI> and construe this part of the Sentence as follows—<Q>And this <HI>(is) HIS</HI> Name which <HI>THEY</HI> shall call</Q> [or "proclaim"] rather than— <HI>"whereby he shall be called,"</HI> for the Verb is in the 3d person plu∣ral) "THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."—The expression in the other <HI>parallel Text</HI> varies in several circumstances from this, so that Critics cannot be justified in attempting to warp the sense of this passage to that, nor the sense of that to this, but on the con∣trary are bound to give to each of them their <HI>true literal</HI> Sense; and we shall find that <HI>the parallel</HI> will be so far from being weakened thereby, that it will, on the contrary, appear much more clear and consistent.</P>
<PB N="298" REF="300"/></NOTE>, is rendered by their
<PB N="299" REF="301"/>Translation absolutely <HI>dissonant, irreconcileable,</HI> and <HI>un∣parallel</HI> not only to that particular Text, but to every other part of Scripture!</P>
<P><HI>Jerusalem,</HI> or <HI>the Church,</HI> might be allowed, by way of Title, to bear a Motto, or Memorial respecting <Q>the Righteousness of Jehovah,</Q> or that <Q>Jehovah is Righteous,</Q> as King ZEDEKIAH and others certainly did hear such a memorial of JEHOVAH in their names (see my Tract on <HI>the Law of Retribution,</HI> p. 110, 166); but neither <HI>Zedekiah,</HI> nor even the <HI>Redeemed Church</HI> or <HI>Spiritual Jerusalem,</HI> could with the least degree of pro∣priety be called, what Christ alone really was and is,— <HI>"Jehovah</HI> OUR <HI>Righteousness!"</HI></P>
<P>But the impropriety of thus applying that glorious Title need not be argued: it is amply sufficient to shew that the Hebrew Text cannot admit of such a construc∣tion
<PB N="300" REF="302"/>without doing violence to it (as Vitringa and the learned English Translators have done) by supplying the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Nomen, or name which is not found in the Text!

<P>And therefore if all the Texts above cited be duly compared and considered, it must appear that the Title <HI>"Jehovah our Righteousness"</HI> is not applied by Jeremiah (xxxiii. 16.) to JERUSALEM, but to him, who (as the prophet said) <HI>shall call her.</HI> This it seems has been the opinion of <Q>several Interpreters, particularly <HI>HUE∣TIUS,</HI> Demonstr.

<P>Thus the device of SATAN, in pro∣moting MAN'S assumption of <HI>forbidden Knowledge,</HI> is compleatly turned against himself; for that very KNOWLEDGE, which (through his deceit and tempta∣tion) subjected <HI>all Mankind</HI> to SIN and <HI>Death,</HI> is now (through the mercy of God) become a proper <HI>Principle of Action</HI> (if we use it as we ought) to incline us to RIGHTEOUSNESS, and lead us to "<HI>the Tree of Life</HI> <NOTE N="(114)" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The hereditary</HI> KNOWLEDGE <HI>of Good and Evil,</HI> which our first parents unlawfully took upon themselves, by eating of "THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE," is shewn in the beginning of this Tract to be a <HI>Divine Knowledge,</HI> such as must have originally proceeded from GOD; and as THE DIVINE WORD, which "<HI>was with</HI> GOD," and "<HI>was</HI> GOD," (John i. 1.) is declared also to be <Q>the true <HI>LIGHT,</HI> which <HI>LIGHTETH</HI> every man that cometh into the world, <BIBL>(John i. 9.)</BIBL></Q> we may perhaps, without im∣propriety, conceive, that the said <HI>Divine Knowledge</HI> (of which man unlawfully partook) was in some way or other originally communicated to the <HI>Tree of Knowledge</HI> in Paradise, by the ETERNAL WORD, because LIGHT and KNOWLEDGE, when mentioned as <HI>mental Properties,</HI> are certainly synonymous terms; so that to impart KNOW∣LEDGE

<P>A right Faith, therefore, concerning the true Dignity of that Divine Person, <HI>in whose Name</HI> we hope to obtain the heavenly Gift of the Holy Ghost, is undoubtedly necessary; and we must <HI>"give him the honour due unto his Name,"</HI> or the very mention of that Name, in∣stead of intitling us to favour, would be an offence to God, who <Q>hath highly

<P>In a preceding verse (viz. 17th) our Lord, in like manner, compared (with a seeming insinuation of equality) his own works with the works of his Father— <Q>My Father worketh hitherto</Q> <HI>(said he)</HI> <Q>and I work.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="318"/>The <HI>Father which worketh hitherto,</HI> was clearly understood by the Jews to signify the <HI>Almighty Father,</HI> the <HI>Worker</HI> or <HI>Maker of all things,</HI> and therefore they could neither brook the mention he made in the same sentence of his own <HI>working,</HI> nor the particular claim which our Lord expressed in that sen∣tence to the Almighty Father as his peculiar <HI>Father,</HI> calling him <HI>My Father,</HI> instead of <HI>Our Father,</HI> as the common Parent or Creator of Mankind.</P>
<P>All this is plainly implied in the fol∣lowing verse; and <Q>therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the Sabbath,</Q> <HI>(viz. by his</HI> miraculous Works <HI>in</HI> healing the Sick, <HI>and doing good</HI>) <Q>but said also, that <HI>GOD WAS HIS FATHER,</HI></Q> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (said that God was his proper or peculiar Father) <Q>making himself <HI>EQUAL</HI> with God.</Q> For to call God
<PB N="317" REF="319"/>
his peculiar Father was <HI>justly</HI> esteemed by the Jews the same thing as making himself <HI>"equal with God,"</HI> though they were <HI>unjustly</HI> incensed at it, through a want of due attention to the mighty <HI>Works</HI> (similar to those of the Almighty Father) to which Christ appealed, as a proof that he was really <HI>the Son of God!</HI></P>
<P>That SUPREME HONOUR is therefore due unto THE NAME AND PERSON OF THE SON, our Blessed Redeemer, who, for OUR SAKE, took THE NATURE OF MAN upon himself, is manifest, because we are expressly commanded to <HI>honour the Son, even as we honour the Father;</HI> so that we cannot exceed—<Q>FOR THE FATHER JUDGETH NO MAN; <HI>but hath committed</HI> ALL JUDGMENT UN∣TO THE SON: <HI>that all</HI> (Men) <HI>should honour</HI> THE SON, <HI>even as they honour</HI> THE FATHER, (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q>).

<P>It is impossible therefore, that the Supreme God, JEHOVAH, should <Q>give his Glory,</Q> or require Men <HI>to honour the Son, even as they honour the Father,</HI> if the Son was <HI>another,</HI> or not in Unity or <HI>One</HI> with the Father in the <HI>Eternal Being</HI> of the One God; I mean, if he was not included in the <HI>One</HI> Eternal Divine <HI>Being</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which is but ONE (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>One</HI> Jehovah) that is, UNITY ITSELF, and therefore incapable of dif∣ferent Degrees, or <HI>Inequality.</HI> <Q>Hear, O Israel <HI>(said Moses)</HI> the Lord <HI>(or Jehovah)</HI> our God, is One Lord,</Q> or

Jehovah <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is manifestly attri∣buted, both in the Old and New Testa∣ments (as I have already shewn), to the Messiah as a distinct Person from the Father; and therefore, when we read our Lord's expression in John xiv. 28. <HI>"My Father is greater than I,"</HI> we must necessarily understand, that no comparative reference can possibly have been intended thereby, nor is to be made, concerning the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> or <HI>Godhead,</HI> which certainly is but <HI>One,</HI> viz. "ONE JEHOVAH," as the text expressly declares, and consequently we must acknowledge with the Author of the Creed, commonly attributed to Athanasius, that <Q>the Son is equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead,</Q> <HI>(viz. the</HI> One Eternal Being, <HI>or Jehovah)</HI> <Q>though inferior to the Father as touch∣ing

his Manhood,</Q> or his Mediatorial Office; for in some such qualified sense we must of course understand our Lord's expression in John (<Q>The Father is greater than I</Q>) before-mentioned; for those Men, who venture to assert, that the Inferiority of the Son consists in his <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> must evidently suppose a <HI>Superior</HI> and <HI>Inferior</HI> Divine Nature, and consequently, that there are Two <HI>Divine Natures,</HI> which Idea the Scriptures expressly forbid—<Q>(JEHO∣VAH, OUR GOD, <HI>is</HI> ONE JEHOVAH, <BIBL>(Deut. vi. 4.)</BIBL></Q>—And therefore, as the Son is also JEHOVAH, we are bound by the Scriptures to believe, that he is of the same <HI>Divine Nature</HI> with the Father in that <HI>One Eternal</HI> Being, agreeable to what he himself has declared—<Q>I and the Father are One. <BIBL>(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) John x. 30.</BIBL></Q> And as the <HI>Plurality</HI> of Persons is clearly expressed in the latter text by the <HI>Plural</HI> Verb <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>we

The Jews, it is plain, understood the expression in that sense, and immediately charged our Lord with <HI>Blasphemy</HI>— saying,—<Q>Because that thou, being a Man, makest thyself God.</Q> And though our Lord condescended to cite a passage from the Psalms, wherein the title <HI>of Gods</HI> is applied to <HI>mere Men,</HI> viz. <Q>I said ye are Gods,</Q> in order to shew, that the Scriptures <HI>would not be broken</HI> by the consequence which they had drawn from his expression; yet he im∣mediately after maintains the evident meaning of his first expression, as it was

at first <HI>understood by the Jews,</HI> and, by a fair comparison, shewed his infinite superiority over them that were called <HI>Gods,</HI> in the Law, <Q>If he,</Q> <HI>(said our Lord, meaning the Prophet David)</HI> <Q>called them <HI>GODS,</HI> unto whom the Word of <HI>GOD</HI> came, and the Scripture can∣not be broken; say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, thou blasphemest; because I said, I am <HI>THE SON OF GOD?</HI></Q> And our Lord immediately added an incontestable proof of his being GOD [not merely in a <HI>confined, qualified Sense,</HI> like those <HI>Men</HI> called GODS in Scripture <NOTE N="(116)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>I have said, Ye <HI>(are) GODS;</HI> and all of you <HI>(are)</HI> children <HI>(or SONS)</HI> of the most High. <BIBL>(Psa. lxxxii. 6.)</BIBL></Q> The whole Psalm is plainly intended as a reproof and warning to wicked <HI>Rulers</HI> or wicked <HI>Judges,</HI> whom the inspired Psalmist calls <HI>Gods,</HI> probably because they ought to act as <HI>God's Vicegerents</HI> on earth, in <Q>judging righteously,</Q> according to GOD'S LAW, as Moses <Q>charg∣ed them</Q>—<Q>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment, <HI>(but)</HI> ye shall hear the small, as well as the great: ye shall not

<PB N="325" REF="327"/>"THE SON OF MAN," that he might be our BROTHER indeed, and the Restorer of <HI>Human Dignity</HI> in his own Person!</P>
<P>The quotation made by our Lord (John x. 34.) from the 82d Psalm, viz. "I SAID <HI>ye are Gods,"</HI> manifestly refers us back to a preceding expression in the 1st verse of the same Psalm, wherein the inspired Psalmist had "SAID," that God "<HI>judgeth among</HI> THE GODS,"—meaning <Q>the congregation of God,</Q> mentioned in the beginning of the same verse—<Q>God standeth in <HI>THE CONGREGATION OF GOD:</HI> he judgeth among <HI>THE "GODS.</HI> How long will ye judge unjustly?</Q> &amp;c. The whole Psalm, as I have before remarked, is a reproof or warning to <HI>unjust Judges,</HI> who are here called GODS, apparently in no other sense, than what I have already described. <Q>The con∣gregation of God,</Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) signifies, for the most part, the <HI>main body of the people,</HI> or <HI>the congregation of the Israelites in general,</HI> as in Numbers xxvii. 17, and xxxi. 16. and also in Joshua xxii. 16, 17; but in the text before us (when the subject of the con∣text is duly considered) the expression seems to mean, <HI>the congregation</HI> or <HI>assembly of the Judges</HI> or <HI>Senators of the people,</HI> and not the whole <HI>"Congregation of God;"</HI> though indeed the said assembly was <HI>the proper representative</HI> of the whole <HI>"Congregation of God;"</HI> because <HI>the Judges, Magistrates,</HI> and other Officers, were originally ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, AS ALL MAGISTRATES and PUB∣LICK
<PB N="326" REF="328"/>OFFICERS (in strict justice) OUGHT TO BE! We read, indeed, that Moses <Q><HI>CHOSE</HI> able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people. <BIBL>(Exod. xviii. 25.)</BIBL></Q> but, in fact, <HI>"the able men"</HI> were chosen <HI>by the people,</HI> and not <HI>by Moses</HI> (though it is here said, that <HI>"he chose"</HI> them, as it was, <HI>indeed,</HI> by HIS advice, that they were <HI>chosen,</HI> agreeable to the council and proposal of Jethro, related in the preceding context) for in the first chapter of Deuteronomy, wherein Moses begins to repeat the history of former transactions, he relates this amongst the rest, in terms, which clearly shew, that <HI>the election</HI> of the <HI>"able men"</HI> was BY THE PEOPLE. <Q>I spake unto you</Q> <HI>(says he)</HI> <Q>at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone: the Lord your God hath multiplied you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? <HI>TAKE YE,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>CHUSE YE TO YOURSELVES</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>In the Hebrew</Q> <HI>(says the learned Bp.

Com∣pare this with chap. ii. 44. wherein the same Prophet informs us, that—<Q>in the days of these Kings</Q> (meaning the Kings, or rather Kingdoms, which suc∣ceeded the fourth great Kingdom or Roman Empire) <Q>shall the God of Hea∣ven set up a Kingdom, which shall <HI>NEVER BE DESTROYED:</HI> and the King∣dom shall not be left to other People, <HI>(but)</HI> it shall break in pieces, and con∣sume all these Kingdoms, and IT SHALL STAND FOR EVER.</Q> The Psalmist had also previously declared—<Q><HI>Thy Throne, O</HI> GOD, <HI>is</HI> FOR EVER AND EVER. <BIBL>Psal. xlv. 6.</BIBL></Q> Which the Apostle Paul has applied expressly to the Son. Heb. i. 8. These Prophecies of an <HI>Eternal Kingdom,</HI> proclaimed by the Prophets under the Old Testament, were confirmed by the Angel GABRIEL, when he declared the Eternity of CHRIST'S Government:—<Q>And behold</Q> <HI>(said he

1 Cor. xv. 24, 25. And again, in the 28th verse—<Q><HI>And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall</HI> THE SON ALSO HIMSELF BE SUBJECT UNTO HIM THAT PUT ALL THINGS UNDER HIM, THAT GOD MAY BE ALL IN ALL.</Q> The two last mentioned texts, when collated with the preceding declara∣tions concerning <HI>the Eternity of Christ's Kingdom,</HI> would contain an irreconcileable difficulty, were it not clearly demon∣strable, that <HI>"the Son of God"</HI> is really included with THE ALMIGHTY FA∣THER in the Eternal BEING JEHOVAH, and consequently is truly GOD! For the fact is, that he is called JEHOVAH and GOD in many unquestionable passages of Scripture, in some <HI>expressly,</HI> in others by <HI>necessary implication,</HI> (several examples of which are already cited in this Tract) and no inference to the contrary can be justly drawn from any of the texts which my learned friend (before mentioned)

<P>Most of these indeed are such as re∣late to <HI>the Son,</HI> merely in his <HI>mediatorial Office</HI> as MESSIAH, or <HI>the Anointed of</HI> JEHOVAH;—as Psal. ii. 2. <NOTE N="(127)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord, and against his Anointed. <BIBL>Psal. ii. 2.</BIBL></Q> <Q>And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is; who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the hea∣then rage, and the people imagine vain things?

(which is the particular text now under consideration) Eph. i. 17.20. and Heb. i. 2.

he is <Q>inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood,</Q> and all of them demon∣strate his subordination to the Almighty Father in the ministry and gracious offices which he had undertaken for the restoration of mankind; but none of them afford the least shadow of contra∣diction to the texts wherein his <HI>Divine Nature</HI> is declared! One particular text, however, remains to be mentioned, which at first sight, seems to militate against my general argument—viz. Psal. lxxxiii. 18.—<Q><HI>That</HI> (men) <HI>may know that thou</HI></Q> (i. e. GOD mentioned in the 1st and 13th verses) <Q>WHOSE NAME ALONE IS JE∣HOVAH, (art) <HI>the most High over all the earth.</HI></Q>—Now, it is strictly true, indeed, (though I do not think it the proper translation of this text, see pages 233—236.) that <HI>God</HI> ALONE <HI>is</HI> JE∣HOVAH, because <HI>Jehovah alone</HI> is God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>For who is God but Jehovah? <BIBL><HI>Psa. xviii. 31.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>; and the Scriptures assure us, that there is but ONE JEHOVAH, (Deut.

vi. 4.) or <HI>One</HI> "ONLY WISE GOD." (Rom. xvi. 27. 1 Tim. i. 17.) And therefore, when <HI>the Son of God</HI> is called JEHOVAH, or GOD, he is not so named, as being distinct or separate with respect to that ONE <HI>Eternal Being,</HI> JEHOVAH, or GOD, but as being included in that <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> or GOD, <Q>whose Name alone is <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI></Q> and as being ONE <HI>with the</HI> ALMIGHTY FATHER! which was declared by the Son himself; —<Q>I and the Father (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>WE ARE ONE.</HI> <BIBL>(John x. 30.)</BIBL></Q> <Q>I am in the Father, and the Father in me. <BIBL>(John xiv. 11. xvii. 21. and x. 38.)</BIBL></Q> And therefore, though <HI>the Son</HI> <Q>shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Fa∣ther,</Q>—and shall <Q>also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all,</Q> (as declared in the texts cited above from 1 Cor. xv. 24—28.) yet, as <HI>the Son is in the Father, and the Father in him,</HI> and
<PB N="351" REF="353"/>
as <HI>"all things that the Father hath are" the Son's</HI> (John xvi. 15.) and as he must of course be <HI>glorified with the Glory which he had with the Father himself before the world was,</HI> (John xvii. 5.) it is manifest that he will <HI>still reign in and with the</HI> ALMIGHTY FATHER in that Eternal Being of GOD, which will then <HI>"be all in all!"</HI></P>
<P>In the above mentioned text of St. Paul, it is said, that <Q>He</Q> <HI>(Christ)</HI> <Q>must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet,</Q> and that <Q>the last enemy <HI>(that)</HI> shall be destroyed is <HI>DEATH.</HI> <BIBL>(1 Cor. xv. 25, 26.)</BIBL></Q> This opens to us the time that Christ will deliver up the kingdom. DEATH, that last enemy, will be effectually destroyed, when all men, that are redeemed by Christ, are <HI>risen from</HI> DEATH! The world itself (where alone <HI>Death</HI> reigned) and all that is desirable in it, will then
<PB N="352" REF="354"/>
not only be <HI>"burned up,"</HI> (2 Pet. iii. 10.) but will be made the seat of <HI>eter∣nal Horror</HI> and <HI>"everlasting Fire,"</HI> (see Notes in pages 130 and 142.) and the irrevocable decrees of <HI>the Son of</HI> MAN, in his final Judgment upon MEN and ANGELS, will by that time have taken place! Here, then, is an end of the whole Christian Dispensation! What need can there be of a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> a <HI>Me∣diator,</HI> or of a <HI>Judge,</HI> after the Fate of all Mankind is determined!—It is no lessening, therefore, of the Son's Dig∣nity, that he then delivers up the several charges which he had undertaken in obedience to his Father's will, when the same shall have been compleatly executed and fulfilled!—The generality of Commentators agree, that it is Christ's <HI>Mediatorial Kingdom</HI> which will then be delivered up; but they should also have mentioned that <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> which is still of higher degree, that glorious
<PB N="353" REF="355"/>
<HI>Sovereign Authority,</HI> which is of un∣speakable Dignity; I mean that of sit∣ting as SUPREME JUDGE OF THE UNI∣VERSE! An Authority of which even the <HI>Almighty Father</HI> hath divested him∣self—<Q>For the Father judgeth no Man, but hath committed all Judgment unto the Son</Q> (and the <HI>supreme Dignity</HI> of the Trust is fully declared by the reason of its being given); <Q>that all <HI>(Men)</HI> should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. <BIBL>(John v. 22, 23.)</BIBL></Q> Nay, not only Men, but Angels must <HI>honour him;</HI> for the word ALL (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) includes <HI>Angels</HI> as well as <HI>Men;</HI> and we read expressly, that <HI>Angels</HI> are required to WORSHIP HIM <NOTE N="(129)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith</Q> <HI>(says the Apostle to the Hebrews)</HI> <Q>And let <HI>ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM.</HI> <BIBL>Heb. i. 6.

Eternal Being JEHOVAH! And when the important Trust shall have been fulfilled, and compleatly executed, that <HI>Divine</HI> Authority and Jurisdiction, as <HI>supreme Judge</HI> (which had been com∣mitted only to <HI>One</HI> of the Divine Per∣sons) shall be delivered up, together with all other offices of <HI>distinct</HI> or <HI>separate</HI> Au∣thority, that <Q>GOD MAY BE ALL IN ALL.</Q> And <HI>in</HI> GOD, undoubtedly, <HI>the Son of God</HI> <Q>shall reign over the House of Jacob for ever: and of his Kingdom there shall be no end!</Q>—Agreeable to the Angels Prophecy. Luke i. 33.</P>
<P>The Scriptures indeed are every where filled with clear Testimonies concerning <HI>the Divinity</HI> of our BLESSED REDEEM∣ER, so that the command to <HI>honour</HI> him, <HI>"even as we honour the Father,"</HI> is per∣fectly consistent with all the rest. And therefore, unless we HONOUR the Son with SUPREME HONOUR, <Q>even as we honour the Father,</Q> we fall short
<PB N="355" REF="357"/>
of the command; and, for want of <HI>due Faith,</HI> cannot expect to obtain of the Father that <HI>glorious</HI> and <HI>heavenly Gift</HI> for the necessary improvement of <HI>Human Nature,</HI> which our REDEEMER has pro∣mised <Q>to them that ask in his Name, even the Spirit of Truth, <BIBL><HI>(John xv. 26.)</HI></BIBL></Q> <HI>which</HI> <Q>will guide us into all Truth. <BIBL>(John xvi. 13.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The supreme, or equal <HI>Divine Nature</HI> of THE HOLY SPIRIT, is not less clearly declared, in several parts of Scripture, than the <HI>Divine Nature</HI> of THE SON OF GOD, notwithstanding that some other parts of Scripture express a manifest <HI>Subordination of Office;</HI> as that <Q>he shall <HI>NOT SPEAK OF HIMSELF;</HI> but what∣soever he "<HI>SHALL HEAR, (that)</HI> shall he speak <NOTE N="(130)" PLACE="foot"><P>John xvi. 13.

But the true sense of this <HI>Hearing</HI> and <HI>Speaking</HI> of the Holy Ghost will be best understood by comparing the text with another passage of Scripture, wherein <HI>God's Revelation by his Spirit</HI> is further explained. St. Paul, speaking of <Q>the things which God hath prepared for them that love him,</Q> intimates, that—<Q><HI>GOD</HI> hath <HI>RE∣VEALED (them)</HI> unto us <HI>BY HIS SPIRIT:</HI> for the Spirit <HI>(says he)</HI> searcheth all things, yea, <HI>THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD.</HI> For what Man" (continues the Apostle) "knoweth the things of a Man, save <HI>THE SPI∣RIT OF MAN</HI> which is in him? Even so" (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>so also</HI>) "the things of <HI>GOD</HI> knoweth no Man but <HI>THE SPI∣RIT OF GOD.</HI> <BIBL>1 Cor. ii. 10, 11.</BIBL></Q> Thus by <Q>com∣paring spiritual things with spiritual</Q> (agreeable to the Apostle's advice in the next verse but one, ver. 13.) we learn how to understand what is said of the Holy Ghost's <HI>Hearing</HI> what <HI>"he shall speak:"</HI> for the manner of his <HI>knowing,</HI> or being acquainted with <HI>"the things of God,"</HI> we find is plainly compared to the knowledge of the Soul <HI>in a Man,</HI> respecting <HI>the things of a Man;</HI> and surely a stronger declaration of supreme and infinite Knowledge could not have been made! He therefore that <HI>searcheth</HI> the deep things of God, <HI>speaks not of himself,</HI> because he speaks <HI>"the things of God,"</HI> and of course <HI>the things of Christ,</HI> because <HI>"all things that the Father hath"</HI> (said Christ) <HI>"are</HI> MINE: <HI>therefore said I"</HI> (continues our Lord) <Q>that he <HI>(i. e. the Spirit)</HI> shall take of <HI>MINE,</HI> and shall shew it unto you. <BIBL>John xvi. 15.</BIBL></Q></P>

—yet (I say, notwithstanding these ex∣pressions of <HI>Subordination</HI>) the supreme or equal <HI>Divine Nature</HI> of THE HOLY SPIRIT is clearly revealed in several parts of Scripture. The Prophet Isaiah, for instance, has declared the Divine Omnipotence of <HI>the Spirit</HI> in the strong∣est terms;—in terms which prove, that <HI>"the Spirit of God"</HI> is a free and inde∣pendent Spirit, and is truly <HI>God</HI> of the

same <HI>supreme Divine Nature,</HI> or <HI>Eternal Being,</HI> with the other <HI>Two Divine Per∣sons;</HI> for this Prophet expressly applies to <HI>"the Spirit of God"</HI> the same supreme Attributes of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Almighty Power,</HI> which in other parts of Scrip∣ture are occasionally attributed to the other Two Divine Persons!</P>
<P>But hear the words of the Prophet himself, dictated by <HI>that same Spirit.</HI>— <Q><HI>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand? and meted out hea∣ven with the span, and comprehended the dust in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a ba∣lance?

<PB N="361" REF="363"/>
of <HI>"Jehovah,"</HI> and <HI>"our God,"</HI> whose Advent was to be proclaimed by the voice in the wilderness, and of whom <HI>Sion</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> were directed to say unto the cities of Judah, <Q>Behold your God, <BIBL>(see p. 248—258)</BIBL></Q> and having also expressly distinguished <Q>the Spirit of Jehovah,</Q> and proclaimed his <HI>Di∣vine Attributes</HI> and <HI>supreme Dignity,</HI> (see ver. 12—17. last cited) he now proceeds to speak of GOD (in the 18th verse) without further distinction of Persons. <Q>To whom then</Q> <HI>(continues he)</HI> <Q>will ye liken <HI>GOD?</HI> or what likeness will ye compare unto him? <BIBL>(ver. 18, &amp;c.)</BIBL></Q></P>

expressly to <HI>the Holy Spirit</HI> (as in the above cited text of Isaiah) which in other parts of Scripture are equally attri∣buted to THE FATHER AND THE SON, we may reasonably conclude, that the <HI>supreme Dignity</HI> of the HOLY SPIRIT must necessarily consist in his entire <HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Equality</HI> with <HI>the Father</HI> and with <HI>the Son</HI> in the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> or GODHEAD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note in p. 322. and note (148) in p. 371.</NOTE>—that ONE eternal and glo∣rious <HI>Being,</HI> JEHOVAH, <Q>which is, and which was, and which is to come, <HI>THE ALMIGHTY!</HI> <BIBL>(Rev. i. 8. see also p. 239.)</BIBL></Q></P>

<P>Too many <HI>Temples,</HI> indeed, through the Depravity of <HI>Mankind,</HI> and the In∣fluence of <HI>Devils,</HI> have been dedicated to those, "<HI>which by Nature are</HI> NO GODS!"

respect, than <HI>Heathen</HI> Temples! And therefore, if we really believe the Holy Scriptures to be the Word of God, we must necessarily believe that THE HOLY GHOST is really and truly GOD; for otherwise we should not have been re∣quired by the Holy Scriptures to esteem our <HI>Bodies</HI> as the <Q>Temple of the Holy Ghost!</Q> And as it thus appears to be a necessary conclusion, that THE HOLY GHOST is <HI>truly</HI> GOD, it is equally a necessary doctrine, that he is also JE∣HOVAH— "<HI>For who is</HI> GOD" (i. e. truly God) "<HI>except</HI> JEHOVAH?" <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Compare this with Ps. lxxxvi. 10.—<Q>Thou art God alone,</Q> <HI>that is,</HI> <Q>Thou</Q> <HI>(JEHOVAH)</HI> <Q>art God alone,</Q> for the whole Psalm is a prayer addressed to JEHOVAH— "<HI>Bow down thine ear,</HI> O JEHOVAH," &amp;c.—See also Isaiah xxxvii. 16. and compare th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se texts with the note in p. 323. concerning those persons, whose title of <HI>"Gods,"</HI> was merely <HI>nominal.</HI></P></NOTE> Psa. xviii. 31. And therefore, though THE HOLY GHOST is clearly revealed to us in Scrip∣ture as a distinct Person from THE FA∣THER
<PB N="388" REF="390"/>
and THE SON, he must neverthe∣less be included in that One Divine and Eternal <HI>Being,</HI> JEHOVAH; and according∣ly, in that supreme character, he revealed the Divine Will to the Prophets! Of this I have already produced some remarkable, and (I trust) incontrovertible proofs, and therefore shall only request my reader's attention to one more example of it. <Q>Well spake <HI>THE HOLY GHOST</HI></Q> <HI>(said the Apostle Paul to the unbelieving Jews at Rome)</HI> <Q>by Isaias the Prophet unto our Fathers, saying; Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive. For the heart of this people is waxed gross, &amp;c. <BIBL>Acts xxviii. 25.</BIBL></Q> But when we turn to that part of Isaiah's Prophecy to which the Apostle refers us, as the SAYING of THE HOLY GHOST, we find it was JEHOVAH which <HI>spoke</HI> to the Prophet!—<Q>I heard</Q> <HI>(says the Prophet)</HI> <Q>the <HI>VOICE</HI> of the <HI>LORD
<PB N="389" REF="391"/>
(Adonai)</HI> saying, Whom shall I <HI>SEND?</HI> and who will go for US?</Q> (speaking expressly in a Plurality of Persons). <Q>Then said I, here <HI>(am)</HI> I; send me. And <HI>HE</HI> said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, <HI>(or in hearing)</HI> but under∣stand not; and see ye indeed <HI>(or in see∣ing)</HI> but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed <NOTE N="(157)" PLACE="foot"><P>See some Observations on this passage in my Tract on several important Prophecies. 2d Edit. pages 222, 223, and 228—235.</P></NOTE>. Then said I, <HI>LORD, (or Adoni)</HI> how long? And <HI>HE</HI> answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, &amp;c. <BIBL>Isai. vi. 8—11.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Lord,</HI> or <HI>Adoni,</HI> who then spake to Isaiah, was represented to the
<PB N="390" REF="392"/>
Prophet (see the beginning of the chap∣ter) as <Q>sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>and one cried unto another,</Q> <HI>(that is, the Seraphims mentioned in the pre∣ceding verse)</HI> <Q><HI>HOLY, HOLY, HOLY (IS) JEHOVAH OF HOSTS,</HI> the whole earth is full of his glory, &amp;c. <BIBL>(ibid. 1—3.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Now, notwithstanding that <HI>the Lord</HI> JEHOVAH is represented in this Divine Revelation as speaking in the <HI>Plural</HI> Number <HI>("who will go for us"),</HI> and that the <HI>threefold</HI> repetition of the Epi∣thet <HI>Holy,</HI> in the proclamation of God's glorious Title, <HI>Jehovah of Hosts,</HI> seems to correspond with the above-mentioned Idea of a Plurality of Persons being comprehended in that <HI>One Eternal Being</HI> JEHOVAH, which then revealed himself to Isaiah, yet the Apostle Paul expressly attributed the Revelation to the <HI>Holy
<PB N="391" REF="393"/>
Ghost,</HI> as being the Divine Person which then spake! <Q>Well <HI>SPAKE THE HOLY GHOST</HI></Q> <HI>(says he)</HI> <Q>by Isaias the Prophet, <HI>SAYING,</HI> Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear,</Q> &amp;c. Who then shall presume to say that THE HOLY GHOST is not really and truly GOD; when it is apparent by the cita∣tions already made, that the glorious Name JEHOVAH, which includes THE DIVINE NATURE OF THE FATHER, and OF THE SON, is expressly attributed also to THE HOLY GHOST?</P>
<P>Without a due sense of this supreme Dignity of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> we should form but a very unworthy idea of the <HI>real Dignity</HI> of HUMAN NATURE, which (as I have already shewn) is not only capable of <HI>receiving</HI> the Gift, or internal Communication, of that <HI>glorious</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> FREE SPIRIT <NOTE N="158" PLACE="foot">See note in p. 360.</NOTE> OF GOD,
<PB N="392" REF="394"/>
as <HI>a Principle of Action,</HI> but is absolutely entitled even <HI>to claim</HI> that wonderful par∣ticipation of the <HI>Divine Nature!</HI> to <HI>claim</HI> it, I say, by a written Charter of Privileges, which can never be taken from us (as <HI>God's Word</HI> cannot fail), he having bound him∣self to us on certain reciprocal condi∣tions by an irrevocable covenant (as sure as his Word) that MAN might be FREE indeed! We are FREE (I say) having now a <HI>free Choice,</HI> through Christ, to partake, <HI>if we will</HI> <NOTE N="(159)" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>"If we will."</HI> For, notwithstanding all that has been said and wrote concerning <HI>Predestination</HI> and <HI>Reprobation,</HI> yet it must surely be our own fault, a de∣pravity in our own <HI>choice,</HI> or <HI>will,</HI> if we partake not of <HI>"the Tree of Life!"</HI></P>
<P><Q>No man</Q> <HI>(indeed)</HI> <Q>can come to me</Q> <HI>(said that Di∣vine Person, who alone is THE WAY,</HI> and <HI>THE TRUTH,</HI> and <HI>THE LIFE," John xiv. 6.</HI>) <Q>except the Father, which hath sent me, <HI>DRAW</HI> him: and I</Q> <HI>(said he)</HI> <Q>will raise him up at the last day. <BIBL>(John vi. 44.)</BIBL></Q> But though <HI>this Drawing</HI> depends on <HI>the Will of the Father,</HI> yet no just argument arises from thence against <HI>the free Will of</HI> MAN, because we have ample assurance on the
<PB N="393" REF="395"/>part of the Almighty, that his <HI>Good Will</HI> to DRAW us will not be wanting, if we seek him as we ought, and do not resist his Divine Grace in our hearts; of this <HI>Good Will</HI> his affectionate remonstrances from time to time by his Prophets bear unquestionable testimony. —<Q>Why <HI>WILL</HI> ye die, O House of Israel? For I <HI>HAVE NO PLEASURE</HI> in the death of him that dieth, saith the <HI>LORD JEHOVAH,</HI> wherefore turn yourselves,</Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
in Hiphil. cause ye to turn; i. e. the repentance must be by your own will and deed) <HI>"and live ye."</HI> (Ezek. xviii. 31, 32.) And again, GOD <HI>swears by himself,</HI> that we may have full assurance of <HI>his Will</HI> in our favour, if our own <HI>Will</HI> is not wanting!—<Q>Say unto them <HI>(as) I LIVE,</HI> saith the <HI>LORD JEHOVAH,</HI> I have <HI>NO PLEASURE</HI> in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and live: turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways: for why will ye die, O House of Israel? <BIBL>Ezek. xxxiii. 11.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>These texts, indeed, are assurances of God's love to <HI>the House of Israel;</HI> but in Christ, even <HI>the Gentiles</HI> are entitled to claim them, being now engrafted on the stock of <HI>Israel</HI> (see p. 296) and are thereby rendered <Q>Abra∣ham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. <BIBL>(Gal. iii. 29.)</BIBL></Q> And under the New Covenant, also, God hath confirmed these assurances of favour <HI>on his part,</HI> if we are not wanting to <HI>ourselves,</HI> promising us that we shall <HI>re∣ceive,</HI> if we will but <HI>ask</HI> (see note in p. 395)—<Q>For <HI>THE LORD</HI> is not slack concerning his promise, as some
<PB N="394" REF="396"/>men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us ward, <HI>NOT WILLING THAT ANY SHOULD PERISH, BUT</HI> that <HI>ALL</HI> should come to repentance. <BIBL>2 Pet. iii. 9.</BIBL></Q> From hence it follows, that, if any perish, it is not by God's <HI>Will,</HI> (though he certainly foreknows their destruction) but by their own <HI>wilful</HI> Abuse of the <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil;</HI> for we are assured also by another Apostle, that GOD <Q>will have <HI>ALL MEN</HI> to be saved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth. <BIBL>(1 Tim. ii. 4.)</BIBL></Q> <Q><HI>The Word</HI> ALL</Q> (says the learned Mr. Francis Fox on this text) <Q><HI>here stands for</HI> EVERY MAN; for so it is used ver. 1. where we are commanded to pray for ALL MEN. Hence (says he) we may argue, that if God WILLS the Salvation of ALL MEN, and would have ALL come to the acknowledgment of the Truth, then he affords ALL sufficient MEANS and GRACE, in order to their obtaining Salvation; because without this they cannot be saved. <BIBL>(See John vi. 44. quoted in the beginning of this note)</BIBL></Q>. <Q>If any therefore perish, it is not because God DENIES them GRACE and HELP, but because they are WANTING TO THEMSELVES, and WILL NOT BE PREVAILED WITH to USE the assistance he affords. Their destruction, therefore, is not FROM any peremptory DECREE of God's, but FROM THEM∣SELVES. <BIBL>New Testament with references, p. 867. note.</BIBL></Q></P>

<PB N="400" REF="402"/>brethren, that <HI>FLESH AND BLOOD</HI> cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth <HI>CORRUPTION</HI> inherit <HI>IN∣CORRUPTION</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>By this latter part of the sentence (i. e. <HI>neither doth corruption haberit incorruption)</HI> the Apostle explains what he meant by the <Q>flesh and blood</Q> which <HI>"cannot inherit,"</HI> &amp;c. <HI>"ita explicat"</HI> (as Grotius justly remarks) <HI>"quid intelligi voluerit per</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> et <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>." It is manifest from the whole context, that the Apostle, <HI>by flesh and blood</HI> in this text, meant only <HI>corruptible</HI> and <HI>perishable flesh and blood;</HI> for it is not <HI>the substance</HI> or solidity <HI>of flesh and blood,</HI> which cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven, but only <HI>the corruptibility,</HI> or <HI>dissoluble</HI> and <HI>corrupt quality of it,</HI> as another learned commentator (Slater) has re∣marked—<HI>Non intelligit</HI> CORPORIS SUBSTANTIAM, <HI>sic enim resurget.</HI> Job xix. 26, 27. <HI>sed qualitatem corruptam.</HI> Pol. Synop. Vol. V. page 539.</P>
<P>We have incontestable evidence, by the resurrection and ascension of our Lord, that the real human substances of <HI>"flesh and bones"</HI> (of which his revived body consisted) can, and doth <Q>inherit the kingdom of heaven.</Q>—Our Lord was particularly careful to convince his disciples of this truth after his resurrection, saying—<Q><HI>Behold my hands and my feet,</HI> THAT IT IS I MYSELF (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, thus insisting upon <HI>the identity</HI> of his own person) <HI>handle me, and see</HI></Q> (thus urging his disciples to receive undeniable conviction by all their senses) <Q>for <HI>A SPIRIT</HI></Q> <HI>(says he)</HI> <Q>hath not <HI>FLESH AND BONES,</HI> as ye see we have. And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them <HI>(his)</HI> hands and <HI>(his)</HI> feet. <BIBL>Luke xxiv. 39, 40.</BIBL></Q> Now this was not to convince them merely, that the <HI>hands</HI> and <HI>feet,</HI> which he then shewed, were <HI>"flesh and bones,"</HI> but that they were also (to undeniable de∣monstration) the same identical <HI>"flesh and bones"</HI> that had been pub∣lickly nailed to the cross; for our Lord shewed them likewise <Q>his side, <BIBL>John xx. 20.</BIBL></Q> undoubtedly that same wounded <HI>side</HI> which had been pierced with a lance; for it was manifestly on account of the <HI>wounds,</HI> which he had received in his <HI>flesh,</HI> that he now pointed
<PB N="401" REF="403"/>out, as unquestionable evidences of his identical body, those parti∣cular parts thereof (his <HI>hands, feet,</HI> and <HI>side</HI>) in which the principal wounds had been made, agreeable to the predictions of the Prophets (Ps. xxii. 16. Zech. xii. 10. and xiii. 6, 7.) and at the same time, he submitted himself to the most critical examination of those select persons, whom he had chosen for witnesses—<Q>It is I myself <HI>(says he)</HI> handle me and see,</Q> &amp;c. That our Lord appealed to the evidence of real <HI>wounds</HI> in his <HI>flesh,</HI> is further demonstrated by the declaration of the Apostle Thomas, when he had heard the account of our Lord's appearance from the other disciples: for Thomas answered them, saying—<Q>Except I shall see in his <HI>HANDS</HI> the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his <HI>SIDE,</HI> I will not believe.</Q> And accordingly, this palpable and unquestion∣able demonstration was graciously allowed him, even in the presence of the former witnesses; for—<Q>After eight days, again the disciples were within, and <HI>THOMAS</HI> with them: <HI>(then)</HI> came Jesus, the doors being shut, <HI>AND STOOD IN THE MIDST,</HI> and said, Peace <HI>(be)</HI> unto you. Then saith he to <HI>THOMAS,</HI> reach hither thy finger, and behold <HI>MY HANDS;</HI> and reach hither thy hand, and <HI>(thrust)</HI> it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. <BIBL>(John xx. 24—27.)</BIBL></Q> And after our Lord had at several other times, (1 Cor. xv. 4—8.) visited, instructed, and confirmed his disciples concerning <HI>the truth and reality of his resurrection,</HI> and other necessary doctrines, he at length ascended from among them towards heaven, even while their whole attention was fixed upon him—<HI>"While they beheld"</HI> (says the text) <Q>he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while <HI>THEY LOOKED STEDFASTLY</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) toward heaven, <HI>AS HE WENT UP,</HI> behold two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? <HI>THIS SAME</HI>
<PB N="402" REF="404"/><HI>JESUS,</HI> which is taken up from you <HI>INTO HEAVEN,</HI> shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go <HI>INTO HEAVEN.</HI> <BIBL>(Acts i. 9—11.)</BIBL></Q> Thus we have incontestible evidence concerning the identical sub∣stance of our Lord's revived body, <HI>"Flesh and Bones;"</HI> and therefore with certainty we know that the <HI>Human Body</HI> (consisting of solid and palpable substances of <HI>"Flesh and Bones"</HI>) is capable of <HI>inherit∣ing the kingdom of heaven;</HI> and consequently we must understand that the <HI>Flesh and Blood</HI> mentioned by the Apostle, which <Q>cannot inherit,</Q> &amp;c. must necessarily mean <HI>corrupt</HI> and <HI>mortal Flesh and Blood,</HI> before it has undergone the promised <HI>change</HI> to <HI>incorruption</HI> and <HI>immortality,</HI> as explained above; for our Lord's body (it is manifest, if all these circumstances are considered) could not possibly have undergone <HI>any other change</HI> than that of being "RAISED INCOR∣RUPTIBLE," whereas, before, it was <HI>corruptible</HI> (or liable to injuries) and <HI>mortal,</HI> or it could not have <HI>suffered</HI> and <HI>died:</HI> and in like manner all the rest of the "<HI>dead shall be raised</HI> INCORRUPTIBLE;" as the resurrection of Christ is the pledge of our hope, he being declared <HI>"the first fruits of them that slept."</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 20. I shall not apo∣logize to my readers for the length of this note, because the subject of it very materially concerns <HI>the Nature of Man;</HI> and all mankind are personally interested in the assurances we have, that even the <HI>Body</HI> (as well as the <HI>Soul</HI>) shall one day be raised to <HI>immortality</HI> and eternal duration; nevertheless, I confess, that I should have neglected to treat upon this very material part of my subject (as I conceived that the doctrine was sufficiently understood, and generally received among Christians) had not a new pamphlet, on very different prin∣ciples, been put into my hands, at the very time when I had pro∣ceeded in transcribing the above note for the press, even to the very sentence where I have placed the mark of reference; so that I thought myself obliged to add these remarks upon the text, in order to guard against the plausible insinuations in the said Tract.</P>
<PB N="400" REF="402"/></NOTE>. Behold, I shew you a mystery; we
<PB N="401" REF="403"/>shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a mo∣ment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: (for
<PB N="402" REF="404"/>the trumpet shall sound <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>"For the trumpets</HI> SHALL <HI>sound,"</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) says the Apostle; but the Author of the New Pamphlet, mentioned in the preceding
<PB N="403" REF="405"/>note, boldly insinuates, that it <HI>shall</HI> NOT <HI>sound!</HI> And as this Author has thought proper to conceal his name, I hope I may censure his opinions with less reserve, because he cannot suspect me of any <HI>per∣sonal</HI> dislike to an unknown author; and must therefore consider my severity as levelled merely against his erroneous doctrines, and not against himself.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Do you take the</HI> LAST TRUMPET</Q> (says he, in page 13.) <Q>to be some instrumental sound?</Q> &amp;c.—<Q>The word <HI>LAST,</HI></Q> <HI>(says he again)</HI> <Q>evidently implies a <HI>FIRST:</HI> now who is he that heard the instrumental sound of the <HI>FIRST</HI> Trumpet?</Q> Thus, on the strength of a mere sophistical quibble, he ventures to found his opposition to the clearest evidence of scripture, that <Q>the Trumpet <HI>SHALL SOUND,</HI> and the dead shall be raised,</Q>—as if these great articles of the Christian Faith, <HI>the Resurrection of the Dead,</HI> and the awful summons to the <HI>Judgment Seat of Christ,</HI> could possibly be set aside by such superficial reasoning! For though we may not be able to answer his question, viz. <Q>Who is he that heard the instrumental sound of the <HI>FIRST</HI> Trum∣pet?</Q> Yet any plain honest Christian, who reads his Bible with a proper humble disposition, can easily inform him, who they were (even a whole nation at once) that really and truly heard the actual sound of a <HI>former</HI> heavenly <HI>trumpet.</HI> See the 19th chapter of Exodus; wherein the <HI>instrumental sound</HI> is clearly expressed by two different tech∣nical Hebrew names of an <HI>instrument,</HI> well known among the Israelites, which seems to have been a kind of <HI>horn</HI> or <HI>cornet.</HI> The use of such <HI>in∣struments</HI> is particularly recorded in Joshua vi, 4, for seven of them were <HI>sounded</HI> by the priests at the taking of Jericho. The <HI>sound</HI> only of <HI>one instrument</HI> (bearing two different names) was heard at Mount Sinai, tho' it is described as being loud to a most tremendous degree, being a <HI>hea∣venly</HI> trumpet. And answerable to this the future <HI>heavenly</HI> trumpet,
<PB N="404" REF="406"/>foretold by St. Paul, is mentioned in the singular number, viz. <Q>the trump of God. <BIBL>1 Thess. iv. 16.</BIBL></Q>—Now as the <HI>sounding</HI> of the <HI>former</HI> trumpet was previously appointed and foretold, as the awful signal to apprize the Israelites of <HI>the Coming of Jehovah</HI> upon Mount Sinai, and to summon them up to the Mount (see Exodus xix. 11, and 13.) so the actual tremendous <HI>sounding</HI> of that former trumpet (see verses 16 and 19) is an incontestible earnest or pledge to us (even upon the principles of this author's own argument) that we ought to expect an actual <HI>sounding</HI> also of the <HI>last trumpet,</HI> because it is as clearly ap∣pointed to be the <HI>awful signal</HI> of the future <HI>Coming</HI> and <HI>Appearance</HI> of the <HI>Messiah</HI> to judge the world, as the <HI>former</HI> trumpet was of the descent of <HI>Jehovah</HI> upon Mount Sinai, so that the ingenious hypo∣thesis of this Author about the <HI>soundless</HI> summons of the <HI>last</HI> trumpet falls at once to the ground!</P>
<P>There is such ample evidence (God be thanked) of <HI>outward</HI> tran∣sactions throughout the whole account which Moses has given of God's <HI>coming down</HI> upon Mount Sinai (or Horeb, which is only a different part of the same mountain) that the <HI>literal</HI> sense of his relation cannot, without the most glaring perversion, be enveloped and darkened by the delusive mist of <HI>figurative</HI> sophistry! And the same, indeed, may be said of what is revealed to us in the Scrip∣tures concerning the future <HI>Coming</HI> and <HI>Appearance</HI> of the Messiah to judge the world; but this Author nevertheless (presuming upon the sup∣posed force of his insidious quibble about the <HI>last</HI> trumpet) ventures openly to profess his disbelief of the actual <HI>future judgment of the world by Christ;</HI> and boldly asserts, that <Q>there will be no such process hereafter. The judgment seat</Q> <HI>(says he)</HI> <Q>is in every man's heart; and it is there, and <HI>THERE ONLY,</HI> that man can, or <HI>EVER WILL,</HI> feel acquittance, or <HI>CONDEMNATION,</HI> &amp;c. <BIBL>(Note in p. 25.)</BIBL></Q> And
<PB N="405" REF="407"/>this <HI>unscriptural</HI> doctrine he has attempted (in a preceding part of his book) to illustrate by an example drawn even from <HI>Scripture</HI> itself! <Q>When Paul stood before Felix <BIBL><HI>(says he in p. 20.)</HI></BIBL></Q> <Q>Felix stood before the judgment seat of Christ; else what made him tremble? What but the secret condemnation he felt in his breast?</Q> But give me leave for a moment to treat this Author in his own evasive stile, by <HI>answering question with questions,</HI> though I by no means wish to avoid giving him a direct answer to his <HI>trembling</HI> system! — Would not Felix have had much less cause to <HI>tremble,</HI> if (with the <HI>spirit</HI> of our modern Author) he had conceived that there would never be any other <HI>condemnation,</HI> than that which he felt within himself? And again—Did not Felix <HI>tremble</HI> whilst (or as) the Apostle <HI>"reasoned"</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a genitive case <HI>taken absolutely,</HI> as the gram∣marians say, i. e. to mark the precise interval of any action, or cor∣responding circumstance, as that it happened <HI>during the very time</HI> that the Apostle <HI>reasoned) "of righteousness, temperance,</HI> and THE JUDG∣MENT TO COME (expressly <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the <HI>future</HI> judgment) so that the Apostle could not possibly mean the <HI>present</HI> in∣ternal <HI>condemnation,</HI> which at that very interval of time caused Felix to <HI>tremble?</HI> Acts xxiv. 25. But this author not only denies the <HI>future</HI> JUDG∣MENT OF CHRIST, but also, it seems, the <HI>future</HI> RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD! <Q><HI>He feels</HI>" (speaking in p. 23. of a man that has the witness within himself) "<HI>that he is</HI> RISEN WITH CHRIST; <HI>and so experiences with St. Paul,</HI> THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION: <HI>and being made</HI> A PARTAKER OF THE FIRST RESURRECTION, <HI>flesh and blood then convinces him what it is,</HI></Q> &amp;c. Now, as he thus asserts, that he is "made a partaker of the first resurrection," and that there will be <HI>"no process hereafter,"</HI> nor <HI>judgment of Christ,</HI> besides that which (as he conceives) is in every man's heart, it necessarily follows, that 
<PB N="406" REF="408"/>(with respect to himself, and such other <HI>"truly awakened such"</HI>) this Author must suppose <HI>the resurrection to be already past!</HI> This is <HI>a lead∣ing principle,</HI> which, being once admitted, all the other doctrines, which this Author has laboured to inculcate, must necessarily follow as concomitant circumstances: the perusal of his book, therefore, enables us to form a very probable idea of the particular doctrines held by those very ancient heretics, <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Philetus;</HI> for tho' this author himself (a <HI>similar spirit</HI>) conceives, that his doctrines are <Q>not only uncommon, but n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w,</Q> &amp;c. and accordingly (in his preface) apologizes for <HI>"the untrodden path,"</HI> yet his path is very old, and so strongly marked in antiquity, that the <HI>leading principle</HI> above-mentioned, on which almost all the rest depends, was described more than 1700 years ago, even by St. Paul himself, who mentioned the promoters of it ex∣pressly by name, and warned us against the pernicious effects of their errors in the strongest terms—<Q>Their word</Q> <HI>(says the Apostle)</HI> <Q>will eat as doth a canker: of whom is <HI>HYMENEUS</HI> and <HI>PHILETUS;</HI> who concerning the truth have <HI>ERRED,</HI> saying, that the <HI>RESURREC∣TION IS PAST ALREADY;</HI> and overthrow the faith of some. <BIBL>2 Tim. ii. 17, 18.</BIBL></Q></P>
<PB N="402" REF="404"/></NOTE>) and <HI>THE DEAD</HI> shall be
<PB N="403" REF="405"/>raised <HI>INCORRUPTIBLE,</HI> and we shall be <HI>CHANGED.</HI></Q> That is, <HI>we living men,</HI> whoever we are, that shall be
<PB N="404" REF="406"/>found alive, and remaining in the body at that awful period, <HI>"shall be changed;"</HI> for the Apostle had before de∣clared,
<PB N="405" REF="407"/>that <HI>"we shall not all sleep"</HI> (that is, in death) but we "<HI>shall all be</HI> CHANGED," viz. both <HI>Dead</HI> and <HI>Living</HI> shall be <HI>changed</HI> from <HI>corruptible</HI> to <HI>incorruptible</HI> Beings,
<PB N="406" REF="408"/>though the manner of THE CHANGE will be different in these two different states of mankind, the <HI>Dead</HI> will be RAISED <HI>incorruptible,</HI> but the <HI>Living</HI> shall be instanta∣neously rendered so, <HI>"in the twinkling of an eye."</HI> Thus <HI>the change</HI> will be made in the <HI>property</HI> or <HI>quality</HI> of our living bodies, and not in the <HI>identity</HI> of them.
