<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>GODSTOW is at present a Ruin on the Margin of the Isis, at a small distance from Oxford. It was formerly a House of Nuns, famous perhaps on no account so much as for having been the Burial-place of Rosamond, daughter of Lord Clifford, the beautiful Paramour of Henry the Second. This Monarch is said to have built a Labyrinth at Woodstock to conceal her from his jealous Queen, who, during his Absence, when he was called away by an unnatural Rebellion of his Sons, at the supposed Instigation of their Mother, found means to get Access to her, and compelled her to swallow Poison. Frequent Walks in this delightful Recess, sacred to the Moments of Contempla∣tion, suggested the following Thoughts, for the Publication of which, let the alarming Progress of Lewdness, and consequently of Licentiousness of Manners, which indeed threatens the Dis∣solution of our State, be accepted as an Apology.</P>

<L>THE moral Muse, from yon monastic shade,</L>
<L>Where frown the Tow'rs by envious Time decay'd,</L>
<L>Invites my footsteps from the flow'ry plain,</L>
<L>And calls from Folly's rout to Fancy's train.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O hallow'd Haunts! where Genius loves to stray,</L>
<L>Where silver ISIS winds her murm'ring way:</L>
<L>Whence seen from far, aspiring to the skies,</L>
<L>The awful Fanes of BRITISH ATHENS rise:</L>
<L>Where, thro' her reeds, a path as we explore,</L>
<L>Some startled Halcyon seeks the farther shore:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>And all her woods, and winding groves among</L>
<L>The lonely Philomela swells her song:</L>
<L>Around; thy verdant olives, PEACE! arise;</L>
<L>Thy radiance, LEARNING! shines to distant skies!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O sacred scenes! Remembrance shall renew,</L>
<L>And Fancy's eye with frantic bliss review!</L>
<L>Soon shall I cease to linger with delight,</L>
<L>And 'mid your willows meet a noon-day night;</L>
<L>Doom'd on thy banks, commercial Tyne! to roam,</L>
<L>Where lev'ling PHRENZY finds her fav'rite home;</L>
<L>Where crost AMBITION, cursing all she hates,</L>
<L>(Ah dark Disturber of the peace of states!)</L>
<L>Misleads with lies an undesigning train,</L>
<L>And drags THE MANY in her magic chain.</L>
<L>Where PARTY rages, with her Gothic pow'rs,</L>
<L>Nor spares the Muse's shade, nor Sion's bow'rs;</L>
<L>Her rankling spleen some vilest Trash betrays,</L>
<L>That, meant for malice, proves the highest praise:</L>
<L>Her lewdest Libels court the public shame!</L>
<L>Her base Assassins wound each envied name!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<L>Pleas'd I renew my walks by Isis' stream,</L>
<L>Indulging Fancy's sweet extatic dream:</L>
<L>In learned ease with devious steps I stray,</L>
<L>Where lonely CONTEMPLATION points my way:</L>
<L>The sedgy margin oft her step retains,</L>
<L>When sober Ev'ning frees the servile swains;</L>
<L>A soften'd smile unbends her brow austere,</L>
<L>Serenely grave, and pleasingly severe!</L>
<L>Retarded now 'mid GODSTOW's walls she stands;</L>
<L>Walls fam'd of yore! the work of pious hands!</L>
<L>Of ages past each distant deed appears,</L>
<L>And rise the scenes of long elapsed years</L>
<L>In her revolving mind. Tears fill her eyes,</L>
<L>While Henry's woes and Rosamund's arise:</L>
<L>Woes! that still warn us from this Wreck of Time;</L>
<L>A frailty fam'd and far-renowned Crime!</L>
</LG>

<L>Ah hapless Maid! th' aetherial Pow'r began,</L>
<L>(While pensive sadness thro' my bosom ran!)</L>
<L>What mov'd thee first thy Fathers to disgrace?</L>
<L>The boast and brand of Clifford's noble race!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>Cou'd icy Age thy youthful breast inspire,</L>
<L>Or e'er grey hairs enkindle green desire?</L>
<L>Love's living smile Ambition's frowns devour,</L>
<L>And Pleasure flies the rude embrace of Pow'r.</L>
<L>Could Henry's Crown a charm so pow'rful prove,</L>
<L>To blanch the negro front of lawless love?</L>
<L>Too justly blam'd! to blast whose fame conspire</L>
<L>A Lover old, wrong'd Queen, and injur'd Sire!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I see the Father tear his hoary hairs,</L>
<L>And beat a bosom, rack'd with hopeless cares;</L>
<L>Invoke high Heav'n on Henry's head to show'r</L>
<L>The vengeful light'nings of incensed Pow'r:</L>
<L>Bare the red arm against th' adult'rous flame,</L>
<L>And hide in dust a darling daughter's shame!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The pray'r's preferr'd—Nor ever move in vain</L>
<L>The holy lips of Age, incens'd by pain.</L>
<L>War's stern alarms their infant loves annoy,</L>
<L>And black remorse succeeds the blaze of joy.</L>
<L>In vain has Woodstock rear'd her haughty tow'rs,</L>
<L>In vain immur'd thee in meand'ring bow'rs:</L>

<L>Nor sighs, nor pray'rs, nor tears in torrents shed,</L>
<L>Avert the doom from her devoted head,</L>
<L>Till Poison's spumy bowl aveng'd the spotted bed!</L>
