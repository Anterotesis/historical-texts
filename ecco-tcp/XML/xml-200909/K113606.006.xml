<HEAD>AN HISTORY OF BIRDS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CONTINUATION OF PART V. OF BIRDS OF THE CRANE KIND.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Bittern or Mire-drum.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who have walked in an evening by the sedgy sides of
unfrequented rivers, must re∣member a variety of notes from different
water-fowl: the loud scream of the wild goose, the croaking of the mallard,
the whining of the lapwing, and the tremulous neighing of the jack-snipe. But
of all those sounds, there is none so dismally hollow as the booming of
the <PB N="2" REF="5"/> bittern. It is impossible for words to give those
who have not heard this evening-call an adequate idea of its solemnity. It is
like the interrupted bellowing of a bull, but hollower and louder, and is heard
at a mile's distance, as if issuing from some formidable being that
resided at the bottom of the waters.</P>
<P>The bird, however, that produces this ter∣rifying sound is
not so big as an heron, with a weaker bill, and not above four inches long.
It differs from the heron chiefly in its colour, which is in general of a
paleish yellow, spotted and barred with black. Its wind-pipe is fitted to
produce the sound for which it is remark∣able; the lower part of it dividing
into the lungs is supplied with a thin loose membrane, that can be filled
with a large body of air and exploded at pleasure. These bellowing
explo∣sions are chiefly heard from the beginning of spring to the end of
autumn; and, however awful they may seem to us, are the calls to
court∣ship, or of connubial felicity.</P>
<P>From the loudness and solemnity of the note, many have
been led to suppose, that the bird made use of external instruments to
produce it, and that so small a body could never eject such a quantity of
tone. The common people are of opinion, that it thrusts its bill into a reed 
<PB N="3" REF="6"/> that serves as a pipe for swelling the note above its
natural pitch; while others, and in this num∣ber we find Thomson the poet,
imagine that the bittern puts its head under water, and then violently blowing
produces its boomings. The fact is, that the bird is sufficiently provided by
nature for this call; and it is often heard where there are neither reeds nor
waters to assist its sonorous invitations.</P>
<P>It hides in the sedges by day, and begins its call in the
evening, booming six or eight times, and then discontinuing for ten or
twenty minutes to renew the same sound. This is a call it never gives but
when undisturbed and at liberty. When its retreats among the sedges are
invaded, when it dreads or expects the approach of an enemy, it is then
perfectly silent. This call it has never been heard to utter when taken or
brought up in domestic captivity; it continues under the control of man a
mute forlorn bird, equally incapable of attachment or instruction. But,
though its boomings are always performed in solitude, it has a scream which
is generally heard upon the seizing its prey, and which is sometimes
extorted by fear.</P>
<P>This bird, though of the heron-kind, is yet neither so
destructive nor so voracious. It is a retired timorous animal, concealing
itself <PB N="4" REF="7"/> in the midst of reeds and marshy places, and
living upon frogs, insects, and vegetables; and though so nearly
resembling the heron in figure, yet differing much in manners and ap∣petites.
As the heron builds on the tops of the highest trees, the bittern lays its
nest in a sedgy margin, or amidst a tuft of rushes. The heron builds
with sticks and wool; the bittern composes its simpler habitation of
sedges, the leaves of water-plants and dry rushes. The heron lays four
eggs; the bittern generally seven or eight, of an ash-green colour. The
heron feeds its young for many days; the bittern in three days leads its little
ones to their food. In short, the heron is lean and cadaverous,
sub∣sisting chiefly upon animal food; the bittern is plump and fleshy,
as it feeds upon vegetables when more nourishing food is wanting.</P>
<P>It cannot be, therefore, from its voracious appetites, but its
hollow boomb, that the bittern is held in such detestation by the vulgar. I
re∣member in the place where I was a boy with what terror this bird's note
affected the whole village; they considered it as the presage of some
sad event; and generally found or made one to succeed it. I do not speak
ludicrously; but if any person in the neighbourhood died, they supposed
it could not be otherwise, for the <PB N="5" REF="8"/> night-raven had
foretold it; but if nobody hap∣pened to die, the death of a cow or a sheep
gave completion to the prophecy.</P>
<P>Whatever terror it may inspire among the simple, its
flesh is greatly in esteem among the luxurious. For this reason, it is as
eagerly sought after by the fowler as it is shunned by the peasant; and
as it is a heavy rising, slow winged bird, it does not often escape him.
Indeed, it seldom rises but when almost trod upon; and seems to seek
protection rather from conceal∣ment than flight. At the latter end of autumn,
however, in the evening, its wonted indolence appears to forsake it. It is
then seen rising in a spiral ascent till it is quite lost from the
view, making at the same time a singular noise very different from its
former boomings. Thus the same animal is often seen to assume different
desires; and while the Latins have given the bittern the name of the star
reaching bird (or the <HI>stellaris</HI>) the Greeks, taking its character
from its more constant habits, have given it the title of the
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the lazy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Spoonbill or Shoveler.</HEAD>
<P>AS we proceed in our description of the crane kind, birds of
peculiar forms offer, not entirely like the crane, and yet not so far
dif∣ferent as to rank more properly with any other class. Where the long neck
and stilt-like legs of the crane are found, they make too striking a
resemblance, not to admit such birds of the the number; and though the bill
or even the toes should entirely differ, yet the outlines of the figure, and
the natural habits and disposi∣tions being the same, these are
sufficient to mark their place in the general groupe of nature.</P>
<P>The Spoonbill is one of those birds which differs a good
deal from the crane, yet ap∣proaches this class more than any other. The body
is more bulky for its height, and the bill is very differently formed from that
of any other bird whatever. Yet still it is a comparatively tall bird; it
feeds among waters; its toes are divided; and it seems to possess the
natural dispositions of the crane. The European spoonbill is of about the
bulk of a crane; but <PB REF="10"/>

is above four feet high, the other is not more than three feet three inches.
The common colour of those of Europe, is a dirty white; but those of
America are of a beautiful rose colour, or a delightful crimsom. Beauty of
plumage seems to be the prerogative of all the birds of that continent; and
we here see the most splendid tints bestowed on a bird, whose figure
is sufficient to destroy the effects of its colouring; for its bill is so
odly fashioned, and its eyes so stupidly staring, that its fine
feathers only tend to add splendour to deformity. The bill, which in this
bird is so very particular, is about seven inches long, and running out
broad at the end, as its name justly serves to denote; it is there about an
inch and a half wide. This strangely fashioned instrument, in some is
black; in others of a light grey; and in those of America, it is of a red
colour, like the rest of the body. All round the upper chap there runs a kind
of rim, with which it covers that beneath; and as for the rest, its cheeks,
and its throat, are without feathers, and covered with a black skin.</P>
<P>A bird so oddly fashioned, might be expected to
possess some very peculiar appetites; but the spoonbill seems to
lead a life entirely resembling all those of the crane kind; and Nature,
when <PB N="8" REF="14"/> she made the bill of this bird so very broad,
seems rather to have sported with its form, than to aim at any final
cause for which to adapt it. In fact, it is but a poor philosophy to
ascribe every capricious variety in nature to some salu∣tary purpose:
in such solutions we only impose upon each other; and often wilfully
contradict our own belief. There must be imperfections in every being, as
well as capacities of enjoyment. Between both, the animal leads a life of
mo∣derate felicity; in part making use of its many natural advantages, and in
part necessarily con∣forming to the imperfections of its figure.</P>
<P>The shoveler chiefly feeds upon frogs, toads and serpents;
of which, particularly at the Cape of Good Hope, they destroy great num∣bers.
The inhabitants of that country hold them in as much esteem as the ancient
Egyptians did their bird ibis: the shoveler runs tamely about their houses;
and they are content with its society, as a useful though an homely
companion. They are never killed; and in∣deed they are good for nothing when
they are dead, for the flesh is unfit to be eaten.</P>
<P>This bird breeds in Europe, in company with the heron, in high
trees; and in a nest formed of the same materials. Willoughby tells us,
that in a certain grove, at a village <PB N="9" REF="15"/> called Seven Huys,
near Leyden, they build and breed yearly in great numbers. In this grove
also, the heron, the bittern, the cor∣morant, and the shag, have taken up
their residence, and annually bring forth their young together. Here the
crane kind seem to have formed their general rendezvous; and, as the
inhabitants say, every sort of bird has its se∣veral quarter, where none
but their own tribe are permitted to reside. Of this grove the peasants of
the country make good profit. When the young ones are ripe, those that farm
the grove, with a hook at the end of a long pole, catch hold of the bough on
which the nest is built, and shake out the young ones; but sometimes the
nest and all tumble down together.</P>
<P>The shoveler lays from three to five eggs; white, and
powdered with a few sanguine or pale spots. We sometimes see, in the
cabinets of the curious, the bills of American shovelers, twice as big and as
long as those of the com∣mon kind among us; but these birds have not yet
made their way into Europe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Flamingo.</HEAD>
<P>THE Flamingo has the justest right to be placed among
cranes; and though it happens to be web-footed, like birds of the goose kind,
yet its height, figure and appetites, entirely remove it from that groveling
class of animals. With a longer neck and legs than any other of the crane
kind, it seeks its food by wading among waters; and only differs from all of
this tribe in the manner of seizing its prey; for as the heron makes use of
its claws, the flamingo uses only its bill, which is strong and thick for
the purpose, the claws being useless, as they are feeble, and webbed like
those of water-fowl.</P>
<P>The flamingo is the most remarkable of all the crane kind,
the tallest, bulkiest, and the most beautiful. The body, which is of a
beautiful scarlet, is no bigger than that of a swan; but its legs and neck
are of such an ex∣traordinary length, that when it stands erect, it is
six feet six inches high. Its wings, extended, are five feet six inches
from tip to tip; and it is four feet eight inches from tip to tail. The

</FIGURE> <PB N="11" REF="18"/> head is round and small, with
a large bill, seven inches long, partly red, partly black, and crooked like a
bow. The legs and thighs, which are not much thicker than a man's finger, are
about two feet eight inches high; and its neck near three feet long. The feet
are not furnished with sharp claws, as in others of the crane kind; but
feeble, and united by mem∣branes, as in those of the goose. Of what use
these membranes are does not appear, as the bird is never seen swimming,
its legs and thighs being sufficient for bearing it into those depths where
it seeks for prey.</P>
<P>This extraordinary bird is now chiefly found in America, but
was once known on all the coasts of Europe. Its beauty, its size, and the
peculiar delicacy of its flesh, have been such temptations to destroy or
take it, that it has long since deserted the shores frequented by man,
and taken refuge in countries that are as yet but thinly peopled. In those
desert regions, the flamingos live in a state of society, and under a
better polity than any other of the feathered creation.</P>
<P>When the Europeans first came to America, and coasted down
along the African shores, they found the flamingos on several shores on
either continent, gentle and no way distrustful <PB N="12" REF="19"/> of
mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Albin's New History of
Birds.</BIBL></NOTE>. They had long been used to security, in the
extensive solitudes they had chosen; and knew no enemies, but those
they could very well evade or oppose. The Negroes and the native Americans,
were possessed but of few destructive arts for killing them at a
di∣stance; and when the bird perceived the arrow, it well knew how to avoid
it. But it was otherwise when the Europeans first came among them: the
sailors, not considering that the dread of fire-arms was totally unknown in
that part of the world, gave the flamingo the cha∣racter of a foolish bird,
that suffered itself to be approached and shot at. When the fowler had
killed one, the rest of the flock, far from attempting to fly, only regarded
the fall of their companion in a kind of fixed astonish∣ment: another and
another shot was dis∣charged; and thus the fowler often levelled the whole
flock, before one of them began to think of escaping.</P>
<P>But at present it is very different in that part of the
world; and the flamingo is not only one of the scarcest but of the
shyest birds in the world, and the most difficult of approach. They
chiefly keep near the most deserted and inhospitable shores; near
salt-water lakes and <PB N="13" REF="20"/> swampy islands. They come down
to the banks of rivers by day; and often retire to the inland, mountainous
parts of the country at the ap∣proach of night. When seen by mariners in the
day, they always appear drawn up in a long close line of two or three hundred
to∣gether; and, as Dampier tells us, present, at the distance of half a
mile, the exact repre∣sentation of a long brick wall. Their rank, however, is
broken when they seek for food; but they always appoint one of the number as
a watch, whose only employment is to ob∣serve and give notice of danger,
while the rest are feeding. As soon as this trusty centinel perceives the
remotest appearance of danger, he gives a loud scream, with a voice as
shrill as a trumpet, and instantly the whole cohort are upon the wing. They
feed in silence; but, upon this occasion, all the flock are in one chorus,
and fill the air with intolerable scream∣ings.</P>
<P>From this it appears that the flamingos are very difficult to
be approached at present, and that they avoid mankind with the most
cautious timidity; however, it is not from any anti∣pathy to man that they
shun his society, for in some villages, as we are assured by Labat,
along the coast of Africa, the flamingos come <PB N="14" REF="21"/> in great
numbers to make their residence among the natives. There they assemble by
thousands, perched on the trees, within and about the village; and are so
very clamorous, that the sound is heard at near a mile distance. The
Negroes are fond of their company; and consider their society as a gift of
Heaven, as a protection from accidental evils. The French, who are admitted to
this part of the coast, cannot, without some degree of discontent, see
such a quantity of game untouched, and ren∣dered useless by the
superstition of the natives: they now and then privately shoot some of
them, when at a convenient distance from the village, and hide them in the
long grass, if they perceive any of the Negroes approaching; for they would
probably stand a chance of being ill treated, if the blacks discovered
their sacred birds were thus unmercifully treated.</P>
<P>Sometimes, in their wild state, they are shot by mariners;
and their young, which run ex∣cessively fast, are often taken. Labat has
frequently taken them with nets, properly ex∣tended round the places they breed
in. When their long legs are entangled in the meshes, they are then
unqualified to make their escape: but they still continue to combat with
their destroyer; and the old ones, though seized by <PB N="15" REF="22"/>
the head, will scratch with their claws; and these, though seemingly
inoffensive, very often do mischief. When they are fairly disengaged from
the net, they nevertheless preserve their natural ferocity; they refuse
all nourishment; they peck and combat with their claws at every opportunity.
The fowler is therefore under a necessity of destroying them, when taken;
as they would only pine and die, if left to them∣selves in captivity. The
flesh of the old ones is black and hard; though, Dampier says, well
tasted: that of the young ones is still better. But, of all other
delicacies, the flamingo's tongue is the most celebrated. A dish of
fla∣mingo's tongues, says our author, is a feast for an emperor. In fact,
the Roman emperors considered them as the highest luxury; and we have an
account of one of them, who procured fifteen hundred flamingo's tongues to be
served up in a single dish. The tongue of this bird, which is so much
sought after, is a good deal larger than that of any other bird whatever. The
bill of the flamingo is like a large black box, of an irregular figure, and
filled with a tongue which is black and gristly; but what peculiar flavour it
may possess, I leave to be determined by such as understand good
eating better than I do. It is probable, that the <PB N="16" REF="23"/> beauty
and scarcity of the bird, might be the first inducements to studious
gluttony to fix upon its tongue as meat for the table. What Dampier says of
the goodness of its flesh, cannot so well be relied on; for Dampier was
often hungry, and thought any thing good that could be eaten: he avers, indeed,
with Labat, that the flesh is black, tough and fishy; so that we can
hardly give him credit, when he asserts; that its flesh can be formed
into a luxurious entertainment.</P>
<P>These birds, as was said, always go in flocks together;
and they move in rank, in the manner of cranes. They are sometimes seen, at
the break of day, flying down in great numbers from the mountains; and
conducting each other with a trumpet cry, that sounds like the word Tococo,
from whence the savages of Canada have given them the name. In their flight
they appear to great advantage; for they then seem of as bright a red as a
burning coal. When they dispose themselves to feed, their cry ceases;
and then they disperse over a whole marsh, in silence and
assiduity. Their manner of feeding is very singular: the bird thrusts
down its head, so that the upper convex side of the bill shall only touch
the ground; and in this position the animal appears, as it were, standing
upon <PB N="17" REF="24"/> its head. In this manner it paddles and moves the
bill about, and seizes whatever fish or insect happens to offer. For this
purpose the upper chap is notched at the edges, so as to hold its prey with
the greater security. Catesby, how∣ever, gives a different account of their
feeding. According to him, they thus place the upper chap undermost, and so
work about, in order to pick up a seed from the bottom of the water, that
resembles millet: but as in picking up this, they necessarily also
suck in a great quantity of mud, their bill is toothed at the edges, in
such a manner as to let out the mud, while they swallow the grain.</P>
<P>Their time of breeding is according to the climate in which
they reside: in North America they breed in our summer; on the other side
the line they take the most favourable season of the year. They build
their nests in extensive marshes, and where they are in no danger of a
surprize. The nest is not less curious than the animal that builds it: it
is raised from the surface of the pool about a foot and a half, formed of
mud, scraped up together, and har∣dened by the sun, or the heat of the
bird's body: it resembles a truncated cone, or one of the pots which we see
placed on chimnies; on the top it <PB N="18" REF="25"/> is hollowed out to the
shape of the bird, and in that cavity the female lays her eggs, without any
lining but the well cemented mud that forms the sides of the building. She
always lays two eggs, and no more; and, as her legs are immoderately long,
she straddles on the nest, while her legs hang down, one on each side,
into the water.</P>
<P>The young ones are a long while before they are able to fly;
but they run with amaz∣ing swiftness. They are sometimes caught; and,
very different from the old ones, suffer themselves to be carried home, and
are tamed very easily. In five or six days they become familiar, eat out of
the hand, and drink a surprizing quantity of sea-water. But though they are
easily rendered domestic, they are not reared without the greatest
difficulty; for they generally pine away, for want of their natural supplies,
and die in a short time. While they are yet young, their colours are very
different from those lively tints they acquire with age. In their first
year they are covered with plumage of a white colour, mixed with grey; in the
second year the whole body is white, with here and there a slight tint of
scarlet; and the great covert feathers of the wings are black: the third year
the bird acquires all its beauty; the <PB N="19" REF="26"/> plumage of the whole
body is scarlet, except some of the feathers in the wings, that still
retain their sable hue. Of these beautiful plumes, the savages make
various ornaments; and the bird is sometimes skinned by the Eu∣ropeans, to
make muffs. But these have dimi∣nished in heir price, since we have
obtained the art of dying feathers of the brightest scarlet.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the Avosetta or Scooper, and the Corrira or
Runner.</HEAD>
<P>THE extraordinary shape of the Avosetta's bill might
incline us to wish for its history; and yet in that we are not able to
indulge the reader. Natural historians have hitherto, like ambitious
monarchs, shewn a greater fondness for extending their dominions, than
cultivating what they possess. While they have been la∣bouring to add new
varieties to their catalogues, they have neglected to study the history of
ani∣mals already known.</P>
<P>The Avosetta is chiefly found in Italy, and now and then
comes over into England. It is about the size of a pigeon, is a pretty
upright bird, and has extremely long legs for its size. But the most
extraordinary part of its figure, and that by which it may be distinguished
from all others of the feathered tribe, is the bill, which turns up like a
hook, in an opposite di∣rection to that of the hawk or the parrot. This
extraordinary bill is black, flat, sharp and flex∣ible at the end, and about
three inches and an half long. From its being bare a long way 
<PB N="21" REF="28"/> above the knee, it appears that it lives and wades in the
waters. It has a chirping, pert note, as we are told; but with its other habits
we are entirely unacquainted. I have placed it, from its slender figure,
among the cranes; although it is web-footed, like the duck. It is one of
those birds of whose history we are yet in expectation.</P>
<P>To this bird of the crane kind, so little known, I will add
another, still less known; the Corrira or Runner, of Aldrovandus. All we
are told of it is, that it has the longest legs of all web-footed fowls,
except the flamingo and avosetta; that the bill is straight, yellow and
black at the ends; that the pupils of the eyes are surrounded with two
circles, one of which is bay, and the other white: below, near the belly, it is
whitish; the tail, with two white feathers, black at the extremities; and
that the upper part of the body is of the colour of rusty iron. It is thus
that we are obliged to substitute dry description for instructive
history; and em∣ploy words, to express those shadings of colour which
the pencil alone can convey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of Small Birds of the Crane Kind, with the Thighs
partly bare of Feathers.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have taken my distinctions rather from the general form
and manners of birds, than from their minuter though perhaps more precise
discriminations, it will not be expected that I should here enter into a
particular history of a numerous tribe of birds, whose manners and forms
are so very much alike. Of many of them we have scarce any account in our
historians, but tedious descriptions of their dimensions, and the colour
of their plumage; and of the rest, the history of one is so much that of
all, that it is but the same account repeated to a most disgusting
reiteration. I will therefore groupe them into one general draught; in which
the more eminent, or the most whim∣sical, will naturally stand forward on
the canvas.</P>
<P>In this groupe we find an extensive tribe of native birds,
with their varieties and affinities; and we might add an hundred others, of
dis∣tant climates, of which we know little more than the colour and the name.
In this list is exhibited the Curlew, a bird of about the size 
<PB N="23" REF="30"/> of a duck, with a bill four inches long: the Woodcock,
about the size of a pigeon, with a bill three inches long: the God wit, of
the same size; the bill four inches: the Green Shank, longer legged; the
bill two inches and an half: the Red Shank, differing in the colour of its feet
from the former: the Snipe, less by half, with a bill three inches. Then with
shorter bills—The Ruff, with a collar of feathers round the neck of the
male; the Knot, the Sand∣piper, the Sanderling, the Dunlin, the Purre and the
Stint. To conclude; with bills very short—The Lapwing, the Green
Plover, the Grey Plover, the Dottrel, the Turnstone and the Sea-lark.
These, with their affinities, are properly natives or visitants of this
country; and are dispersed along our shores, rivers and watery grounds.
Taking in the birds of this kind, belonging to other countries, the list
would be very widely extended; and the whole of this class, as described by
Brisson, would amount to near an hundred.</P>
<P>All these birds possess many marks in common; though
some have peculiarities that deserve re∣gard. All these birds are bare of
feathers above the knee, or above the heel, as some naturalists chuse to
express it. In fact, that part which I <PB N="24" REF="31"/> call the knee, if
compared with the legs of mankind, is analogous to the heel: but, as it is
commonly conceived otherwise, I have con∣formed to the general
apprehension. I say, therefore, that all these birds are bare of
fea∣thers above the knee; and in some they are wanting half way up the thigh.
The nudity in that part, is partly natural, and partly pro∣duced by all birds
of this kind habitually wad∣ing in water. The older the bird, the barer are its
thighs; yet even the young ones have not the same downy covering reaching
so low as the birds of any other class. Such a covering there would rather
be prejudical, as being continually liable to get wet in the water.</P>
<P>As these birds are usually employed rather in running than
in flying, and as their food lies entirely upon the ground, and not on trees,
or in the air, so they run with great swiftness for their size, and the
length of their legs assists their velocity. But as, in seeking their
food, they are often obliged to change their station; so also are they
equally swift of wing, and traverse immense tracts of country without
much fatigue.</P>
<P>It has been thought by some, that a part of this class
lived upon an oily slime, found in <PB N="25" REF="32"/> the bottoms of
ditches and of weedy pools; they were thence termed, by Willoughby,
Mud-suckers. But later discoveries have shewn that, in these places,
they hunt for the caterpillars and worms of insects. From hence, therefore,
we may generally assert, that all birds of this class live upon animals
of one kind or another. The long billed birds suck up worms and insects
from the bottom; those furnished with shorter bills, pick up such
insects as lie nearer the surface of the meadow, or among the sands on
the sea-shore.</P>
<P>Thus the curlew, the wood-cock, and the snipe, are ever
seen in plashy brakes, and un∣der covered hedges, assiduously
employed in seeking out insects in their worm state; and it seems, from
their fatness, that they find a plentiful supply. Nature, indeed, has
fur∣nished them with very convenient instruments for procuring their food.
Their bills are made sufficiently long for searching; but still more,
they are endowed with an exquisite sensibility at the point, for feeling
their provision. They are furnished with no less than three pair of
nerves, equal almost to the optic nerves in thickness; which pass from
the roof of the mouth, and run along the upper chap to the point.</P>
<P>Nor are those birds with shorter bills, and 
<PB N="26" REF="33"/> destitute of such convenient instruments, with∣out a
proper provision made for their subsistence. The lapwing, the
sand-piper, and the red-shank, run with surprizing rapidity along the
surface of the marsh, or the sea-shore, quarter their ground with great
dexterity, and leave nothing of the insect kind that happens to lie on the
surface. These, however, are neither so fat nor so delicate as the
former; as they are obliged to toil more for a subsistence, they are
easily satisfied with whatever offers; and their flesh often contracts a
relish from what has been their latest, or their principal, food.</P>
<P>Most of the birds formerly described, have stated
seasons for feeding and rest: the eagle kind prowl by day, and at evening
repose; the owl by night, and keeps unseen in the day-time. But these
birds, of the crane kind, seem at all hours employed: they are seldom at
rest by day; and, during the whole night season, every meadow and marsh
resounds with their different calls, to courtship or to food. This seems
to be the time when they least fear interruption from man; and though they
fly at all times, yet, at this season, they appear more assiduously
employed, both in providing for their present support, and continuing that
of posterity. This is usually the season when <PB N="27" REF="34"/> the
insiduous fowler steals in upon their occu∣pations, and fills the whole
meadow with terror and destruction.</P>
<P>As all of this kind live entirely in waters, and among watery
places, they seem provided by Nature with a warmth of constitution to fit
them for that cold element. They reside, by choice, in the coldest
climates; and as other birds migrate here in our summer, their mi∣grations
hither are mostly in the winter. Even those that reside among us the
whole season, retire in summer to the tops of our bleakest mountains;
where they breed, and bring down their young, when the cold weather sets
in.</P>
<P>Most of them, however, migrate, and retire to the polar
regions; as those that remain behind in the mountains, and keep with us
during summer, bear no proportion to the quantity which in winter haunt our
marshes and low grounds. The snipe sometimes builds here; and the nest
of the curlew is sometimes found in the plashes of our hills: but the
number of these is very small; and it is most probable that they are only
some stragglers who, not having strength or courage sufficient for the
general voyage, take up from necessity their habitation here.</P>
<P>In general, during summer, this whole class 
<PB N="28" REF="35"/> either chuse the coldest countries to retire to, or
the coldest and the moistest part of ours to breed in. The curlew, the
wood-cock, the snipe, the godwit, the grey plover, the green, and the long
legged plover, the knot and the turnstone, are rather the guests than the
na∣tives of this island. They visit us in the be∣ginning of winter, and
forsake us in the spring. They then retire to the mountains of Sweden,
Poland, Prussia, and Lapland, to breed. Our country, during the summer
season, becomes uninhabitable to them. The ground parched up by the heat;
the springs dried away; and the vermicular insects already upon the wing;
they have no means of subsisting. Their weak and delicately pointed bills
are unfit to dig into a resisting soil; and their prey is departed,
though they were able to reach its retreats. Thus, that season when Nature
is said to teem with life, and to put on her gayest liveries, is to them an
interval of sterility and famine. The coldest mountains of the north are
then a preferable habitation; the marshes there are never totally dried up;
and the insects are in such abundance, that, both above ground and
underneath, the country swarms with them. In such retreats, therefore,
these birds would continue always; but that the frosts, when 
<PB N="29" REF="36"/> they set in, have the same effect upon the face of the
landscape, as the heats of summer. Every brook is stiffened into ice; all
the earth is congealed into one solid mass; and the birds are obliged to
forsake a region where they can no longer find subsistence.</P>
<P>Such are our visitants. With regard to those which keep
with us continually, and breed here, they are neither so delicate in their
food, nor perhaps so warm in their constitutions. The lapwing, the ruff,
the red∣shank, the sand-piper, the sea-pie, the Nor∣folk plover, and the
sea-lark, breed in this country, and, for the most part, reside here. In
summer they frequent such marshes as are not dried up in any part of the
year; the Essex hundreds, and the fens of Lincolnshire. There, in
solitudes formed by surrounding marshes, they breed and bring up their
young. In win∣ter they come down from their retreats, ren∣dered uninhabitable
by the flooding of the waters; and seek their food about our ditches and
marshly meadow-grounds. Yet even of this class, all are wanderers upon
some occa∣sions; and take wing to the northern climates, to breed and find
subsistence. This happens when our summers are peculiarly dry; and when
the fenny countries are not sufficiently watered to defend their
retreats.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="37"/>But though this be the usual course of
na∣ture, with respect to these birds, they often break through the general
habits of their kind; and as the lapwing, the ruff, and the sand-piper, are
sometimes seen to alter their manners, and to migrate from hence, instead
of continuing to breed here; so we often find the wood-cock, the snipe and
the curlew, reside with us during the whole season, and breed their young
in dif∣ferent parts of the country. In Casewood, about two miles from
Tunbridge, as Mr. Pe∣nant assures us, some wood-cocks are seen to breed
annually. The young have been shot there in the beginning of August; and
were as healthy and vigorous as they are with us in winter, though not so
well tasted. On the Alps, and other high mountains, says Wil∣loughby, the
wood-cock continues all summer. I myself have flushed them on the top of
Mount Jura, in June and July. The eggs are long, of a pale red colour, and
stained with deeper spots and clouds. The nests of the curlew and the
snipe are frequently found; and some of these perhaps never entirely
leave this island.</P>
<P>It is thus that the same habits are in some measure
common to all; but in nestling, and bringing up their young, one method takes
place universally. As they all run and feed <PB N="31" REF="38"/> upon the
ground, so they are all found to nestle there. The number of eggs generally
to be seen in every nest, is from two to four; never under, and very
seldom exceeding. The nest is made without any art; but the eggs are either
laid in some little depression of the earth, or on a few bents and long
grass, that scarcely pre∣serve them from the moisture below. Yet such
is the heat of the body of these birds, that their time of incubation is
shorter than with any others of the same size. The magpie, for
in∣stance, takes twenty-one days to hatch its young; the lapwing takes but
fourteen. Whether the animal oil, with which these birds abound, gives them
this superior warmth, I cannot tell; but there is no doubt of their quick
incubation.</P>
<P>In their seasons of courtship, they pair as other birds;
but not without violent contests between the males, for the choice of the
fe∣male. The lapwing and the plover are often seen to fight among
themselves; but there is one little bird of this tribe, called the ruff, that
has got the epithet of the fighter, merely from its great perseverance and
animosity on these occasions. In the beginning of spring, when these
birds arrive among our marshes, they are observed to engage with
desperate fury against each other; it is then that the fowlers, 
<PB N="32" REF="39"/> seeing them intent on mutual destruction, spread
their nets over them, and take them in great numbers. Yet even in captivity
their animosity still continues: the people that fat them up for sale,
are obliged to shut them up in close dark rooms; for if they let ever so
little light in among them, the turbulent pri∣soners instantly fall to
fighting with each other, and never cease till each has killed its
anta∣gonist, especially, says Willoughby, if any body stands by. A
similar animosity, though in a less degree, prompts all this tribe; but
when they have paired, and begun to lay, their contentions are then over.</P>
<P>The place these birds chiefly chuse to breed in, is in
some island surrounded with sedgy moors, where men seldom resort;
and in such situations I have often seen the ground so strewed with
eggs and nests, that one could scarce take a step, without treading upon
some of them. As soon as a stranger intrudes upon these retreats, the
whole colony is up, and an hundred different screams are heard from every
quarter. The arts of the lapwing to allure men or dogs from her nest, are
perfectly amusing. When she perceives the enemy approaching, she never
waits till they arrive at her nest, but boldly runs to meet them: when she
has come <PB N="33" REF="40"/> as near them as she dares to venture, she
then rises with a loud screaming before them, seem∣ing as if she were
just flushed from hatching; while she is then probably a hundred yards
from the nest. Thus she flies, with great clamour and anxiety, whining and
screaming round the invaders, striking at them with her wings, and
fluttering as if she were wounded. To add to the deceit, she appears
still more clamorous, as more remote from the nest. If she sees them
very near, she then seems to be quite unconcerned, and her cries cease,
while her ter∣rors are really augmenting. If there be dogs, she flies heavily
at a little distance before them, as if maimed; still vociferous and
still bold, but never offering to move towards the quarter where her
treasure is deposited. The dog pursues, in hopes every moment of
seizing the parent, and by this means actually loses the young; for the
cunning bird, when she has thus drawn him off to a proper distance, then
puts forth her powers, and leaves her astonished pursuer to gaze at the
rapidity of her flight. The eggs of all these birds are highly valued by the
lux∣urious; they are boiled hard, and thus served up, without any further
preparation.</P>
<P>As the young of this class are soon hatched, so, when
excluded, they quickly arrive at ma∣turity. <PB N="34" REF="41"/> They run about
after the mother as soon as they leave the egg; and being covered with a
thick down, want very little of that clutching which all birds of the poultry
kind, that follow the mother indispensably require. They come to their
adult state long before winter; and then flock together, till the breed∣ing
season returns, which for a while dissolves their society.</P>
<P>As the flesh of almost all these birds is in high
estimation, so many methods have been contrived for taking them. That
used in taking the ruff, seems to be the most advan∣tageous; and it may
not be amiss to describe it. The Ruff, which is the name of the male, the
Reeve that of the female, is taken in nets about forty yards long, and seven
or eight feet high. These birds are chiefly found in Lincolnshire and the
Isle of Ely, where they come about the latter end of April, and dis∣appear
about Michaelmas. The male of this bird, which is known from all others of the
kind by the great length of the feathers round his neck, is yet so various in
his plumage, that it is said, no two ruffs were ever seen totally of the
same colour. The nets in which these are taken, are supported by
sticks, at an angle of near forty-five degrees, and placed either on 
<PB N="35" REF="42"/> dry ground, or in very shallow water, not re∣mote from
reeds: among these the fowler conceals himself, till the birds, enticed by
a stale or stuffed bird, come under the nets: he then, by pulling a
string, lets them fall, and they are taken; as are godwits, knots and grey
plover, also in the same manner. When these birds are brought from under
the net, they are not killed immediately, but fattened for the table, with
bread and milk, hemp-seed, and sometimes boiled wheat; but if expe∣dition
be wanted, sugar is added, which will make them a lump of fat in a
fortnight's time. They are kept, as observed before, in a dark room; and
judgment is required in taking the proper time for killing them, when they are
at the highest pitch of fatness; for, if that is neglected, the birds are
apt to fall away. They are reckoned a very great delicacy; they sell for two
shillings, or half a crown a piece; and are served up to the table with the
train, like wood-cocks, where we will leave them.</P>

<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Water-hen and the Coot.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we enter upon water-fowls, pro∣perly so called, two
or three birds claim our attention, which seem to form the shade be∣tween
the web-footed tribe and those of the crane kind. These partake rather of
the form than the habits of the crane; and, though fur∣nished with long legs
and necks, rather swim than wade. They cannot properly be called web-footed;
nor yet are they entirely destitute of membranes, which fringe their toes on
each side, and adapt them for swimming. The birds in question are, the
Water-hen, and the Bald Coot.</P>
<P>These birds have too near an affinity, not to be ranked in
the same description. They are shaped entirely alike, their legs are
long, and their thighs partly bare; their necks are propor∣tionable, their
wings short, their bills short and weak, their colour black, their
foreheads bald and without feathers, and their habits entirely the same.
These, however, naturalists have thought proper to range in different
classes, from very slight distinctions in their <PB N="37" REF="44"/>
figure. The water-hen weighs but fifteen ounces; the coot twenty-four. The bald
part of the forehead in the coot is black; in the water-hen it is of a
beautiful pink colour. The toes of the water-hen are edged with a straight
membrane; those of the coot have it scolloped and broader.</P>
<P>The differences in the figure are but slight; and those in
their manner of living still less. The history of the one will serve
for both. As birds of the crane kind are furnished with long wings, and
easily change place, the water-hen, whose wings are short, is obliged to
reside en∣tirely near those places where her food lies: she cannot take
those long journeys that most of the crane kind are seen to perform;
com∣pelled by her natural imperfections, as well perhaps as by inclination,
she never leaves the side of the pond or the river in which she seeks
for provision. Where the stream is selvaged with sedges, or the pond
edged with shrubby trees, the water-hen is generally a resident there:
she seeks her food along the grassy banks; and often along the
surface of the water. With Shake∣spear's Edgar, she drinks the green
mantle of the standing pool; or, at least, seems to prefer those places
where it is seen. Whether she makes pond-weed her food, or hunts among it 
<PB N="38" REF="45"/> for water-insects, which are found there in great
abundance, is not certain. I have seen them when pond-weed was taken out of
their stomach. She builds her nest upon low trees and shrubs, of sticks
and fibres, by the water side. Her eggs are sharp at one end, white, with a
tincture of green spotted with red. She lays twice or thrice in a summer;
her young ones swim the moment they leave the egg, pursue their parent, and
imitate all her manners. She rears, in this manner, two or three broods in a
season; and when the young are grown up, she drives them off to shift
for themselves.</P>
<P>As the coot is a larger bird, it is always seen in larger
streams, and more remote from man∣kind. The water-hen seems to prefer
inhabited situations: she keeps near ponds, motes, and pools of water near
gentlemen's houses; but the coot keeps in rivers, and among rushy margined
lakes. It there makes a nest of such weeds as the stream supplies, and
lays them among the reeds, floating on the surface, and rising and falling
with the water. The reeds among which it is built keep it fast; so that it
is seldom washed into the middle of the stream. But if this happens,
which is sometimes the case, the bird sits in her nest, like a mariner
in his boat, and steers with her legs her cargo into <PB N="39" REF="46"/> the
nearest harbour: there, having attained her port, she continues to sit in
great tranquility, regardless of the impetuosity of the current; and though
the water penetrates her nest, she hatches her eggs in that wet
condition.</P>
<P>The water-hen never wanders; but the coot sometimes swims
down the current, till it even reaches the sea. In this voyage these birds
en∣counter a thousand dangers: as they cannot fly far, they are hunted by
dogs and men; as they never leave the stream, they are attacked and
destroyed by otters; they are preyed upon by kites and falcons; and they are
taken, in still greater numbers, in weirs made for catching fish; for
these birds are led into the nets, while pursuing small fish and
insects, which are their principal food. Thus animated nature affords a
picture of universal invasion! Man destroys the otter, the otter
destroys the coot, the coot feeds upon fish, and fish are universally
the tyrants of each other!</P>
<P>To these birds, with long legs and finny toes, I will add
one species more, with short legs and finny toes: I mean the Grebe. The
entire resemblance of this bird's appetites and manners to those of the
web-footed class, might justly induce me to rank it among them; but as it
resembles those above described, in the pe∣culiar <PB N="40" REF="47"/>
form of its toes, and bears some simi∣litude in its manners also, I will
for once sa∣crifice method to brevity. The grebe is much larger than either
of the former, and its plumage white and black: it differs also entirely in
the shortness of its legs, which are made for swim∣ming, and not walking:
in fact, they are from the knee upward hid in the belly of the bird, and have
consequently very little motion. By this mark, and by the scolloped fringe
of the toes, may this bird be easily distinguished from all others.</P>
<P>As they are thus, from the shortness of their wings, ill
formed for flying, and from the un∣common shortness of their legs, utterly
unfitted for walking, they seldom leave the water, and chiefly frequent
those broad shallow pools where their faculty of swimming can be turned
to the greatest advantage, in fishing and seeking their prey.</P>
<P>They are chiefly, in this country, seen to frequent the
meres of Shropshire and Cheshire; where they breed among reeds and flags,
in a floating nest, kept steady by the weeds of the margin The female is
said to be a careful nurse of its young, being observed to feed them
most assiduously with small eels; and when the little brood is tired,
the mother <PB N="41" REF="48"/> will carry them, either on her back or under
her wings. This bird preys upon fish, and is almost perpetually diving. It
does not shew much more than the head above water; and is very difficult to
be shot, as it darts down on the appearance of the least danger. It is
never seen on land; and, though disturbed ever so often, will not leave
that lake where alone, by diving and swimming, it can find food and
security. It is chiefly sought for the skin of its breast, the plumage
of which is of a most beautiful silvery white, and as glossy as
satin. This part is made into tippets; but the skins are out of season
about February, losing their bright colour; and in breeding-time their
breasts are entirely bare.</P>

<PB REF="49"/>
<HEAD>PART VI. OF WATER-FOWL.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Water-fowl in General.</HEAD>
<P>IN settling the distinctions among the other classes
of birds, there was some difficulty; one tribe encroached so nearly upon
the nature and habitudes of another, that it was not easy to draw the line
which kept them asunder: but in water-fowl Nature has marked them for us by a
variety of indelible characters; so that it would be almost as unlikely to
mistake a land-fowl for one adapted for living and swimming among the
waters, as a fish for a bird.</P>
<P>The first great distinction in this class, ap∣pears in
the toes, which are webbed together for swimming. Those who have remarked
the feet or toes of a duck, will easily conceive how admirably they are
formed for making way in the water. When men swim they do not open the
fingers, so as to let the fluid pass through them; but closing them
together, present one broad surface to beat back the water, and thus push
their bodies along. What man performs by art, Nature has supplied to
water-fowl; and, by broad skins, has web∣bed their toes together, so that
they expand <PB N="46" REF="51"/> two broad oars to the water; and thus, moving
them alternately, with the greatest ease paddle along. We must observe
also, that the toes are so contrived, that as they strike backward, their
broadest hollow surface beats the water; but as they gather them in again,
for a second blow, their front surface contracts, and does not impede the
bird's progressive motion.</P>
<P>As their toes are webbed in the most conve∣nient manner,
so are their legs also made most fitly for swift progession in the
water. The legs of all are short, except the three birds described in a
former chapter; namely, the flamingo, the avosetta, and the corrira: all
which, for that reason, I have thought proper to rank among the crane kind,
as they make little use of their toes in swimming. Except these, all
web-footed birds have very short legs; and these strike, while they
swim, with greater facility. Were the leg long, it would act like a lever
whose prop is placed to a disadvantage; its motions would be slow, and
the labour of moving it considerable. For this reason, the very few birds
whose webbed feet are long, never make use of them in swimming: the web
at the bottom seems only of service as a broad base, to prevent them from
sinking while they walk in the mud; but <PB N="47" REF="52"/> it otherwise
rather retards than advances their motion.</P>
<P>The shortness of the legs in the web-footed kinds, renders
them as unfit for walking on land, as it qualifies them for swimming in their
natural element. Their stay, therefore, upon land, is but short and
transitory; and they seldom venture to breed far from the sides of
those waters where they usually remain. In their breeding seasons,
their young are brought up by the water-side; and they are covered with a
warm down, to fit them for the cold∣ness of their situation. The old ones
also have a closer, warmer plumage, than birds of any other class. It is
of their feathers that our beds are composed; as they neither mat nor imbibe
humidity, but are furnished with an animal-oil, that glazes their furface,
and keeps each separate. In some, however, this animal-oil is in too great
abundance; and is as offensive from its smell as it is serviceable for
the pur∣poses of household oeconomy. The feathers, therefore, of all the
penguin kind, are totally useless for domestic purposes; as neither
boiling nor bleaching can divest them of their oily rancidity. Indeed, the
rancidity of all new feathers, of whatever water-fowl they be, is so
disgusting, that our upholsterers give near <PB N="48" REF="53"/> double
the price for old feathers that they af∣ford for new: to be free from smell,
they must all be lain upon for some time; and their usual method is to
mix the new and the old together.</P>
<P>This quantity of oil, with which most water-fowl are
supplied, contributes also to their warmth in the moist element where
they reside. Their skin is generally lined with fat; so that, with the
warmth of the feathers externally, and this natural lining more internally,
they are better defended against the changes or the inclemencies of the
weather, than any other class whatever.</P>
<P>As, among land-birds, there are some found fitted entirely
for depredation, and others for an harmless method of subsisting upon
vege∣tables, so also among these birds there are tribes of plunderers,
that prey, not only upon fish, but sometimes upon water-fowl themselves.
There are likewise more inoffensive tribes, that live upon insects and
vegetables only. Some water-fowls subsist by making sudden stoops
from above, to seize whatever fish come near the surface; others again,
not furnished with wings long enough to fit them for flight, take their prey
by diving after it to the bottom.</P>
<P>From hence all water-fowl naturally fall into three
distinctions. Those of the Gull kind, that, <PB N="49" REF="54"/> with long
legs and round bills, fly along the sur∣face to seize their prey. Those
of the Penguin kind, that, with round bills, legs hid in the abdomen, and
short wings, dive after their prey: and thirdly; those of the Goose kind,
with flat broad bills, that lead harmless lives, and chiefly subsist
upon insects and vegetables.</P>
<P>These are not speculative distinctions, made up for the
arrangement of a system; but they are strongly and evidently marked by
Nature. The Gull kind are active and rapacious; con∣stantly, except when they
breed, keeping upon the wing; fitted for a life of rapine, with sharp
straight bills for piercing, or hooked at the end for holding their fishy
prey. In this class we may rank the Albatross, the Cormorant, the Gannet or
Soland Goose, the Shag, the Frigate Bird, the Great Brown Gull, and all the
lesser tribe of gulls and sea-swallows.</P>
<P>The Penguin kind, with appetites as vora∣cious, bills as
sharp, and equally eager for prey, are yet unqualified to obtain it by
flight. Their wings are short, and their bodies large and heavy, so that
they can neither run nor fly. But they are formed for diving in a very peculiar
manner. Their feet are placed so far backward, and their legs so hid in the
abdomen, <PB N="50" REF="55"/> that the slightest stroke sends them head
fore∣most to the bottom of the water. To this class we may refer the
Penguin, the Auk, the Skout, the Sea-turtle, the Bottle-nose and the
Loon.</P>
<P>The Goose kind are easily distinguishable, by their
flat broad bills, covered with a skin; and their manner of feeding, which is
mostly upon vegetables. In this class we may place the Swan, the Goose,
the Duck, the Teal, the Widgeon, and all their numerous varieties.</P>
<P>In describing the birds of these three classes, I will
put the most remarkable of each class at the beginning of their
respective tribes, and give their separate history: then, after having
described the chiefs of the tribe, the more or∣dinary sorts will naturally
fall in a body, and come under a general description, behind their leaders.
But before I offer to pursue this me∣thodical arrangement, I must give the
history of a bird that, from the singularity of its conformation, seems
allied to no species; and should therefore be separately described. I
mean the Pelican.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Pelican.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pelican of Africa is much larger in the body than a
swan, and somewhat of the same shape and colour. Its four toes are all
webbed together; and its neck in some measure re∣sembles that of a
swan: but that singularity in which it differs from all other birds is in
the bill and the great pouch underneath, which are wonderful, and demand a
distinct description. This enormous bill is fifteen inches from the point
to the opening of the mouth, which is a good way back behind the eyes. At the
base the bill is somewhat greenish, but varies to∣wards the end, being of
a reddish blue. It is very thick in the beginning, but tapers off to the end,
where it hooks downwards. The under-chap is still more extraordinary; for to
the lower edges of it hang a bag, reaching the whole length of the bill to the
neck, which is said to be capable of containing fifteen quarts of water. This
bag the bird has a power of wrinkling up into the hollow of the under∣chap; but
by opening the bill, and putting <PB REF="58"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="51" REF="59"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="52" REF="60"/> one's hand
down into the bag, it may be di∣stended at pleasure. The skin of which it
is formed will then be seen of a bluish ash-colour, with many fibres and
veins running over its sur∣face. It is not covered with feathers, but a
short downy substance as smooth and as soft as satin, and is
attached all along the under edges of the chap, to be fixed backward to the
neck of the bird by proper ligaments, and reaches near half way down. When this
bag is empty it is not seen; but when the bird has fished with success,
it is then incredible to what an extent it is often seen dilated. For the
first thing the pelican does in fishing is to fill up the bag; and then it
returns to digest its burthen at leisure. When the bill is opened to its
widest extent, a person may run his head into the bird's mouth, and conceal
it in this monstrous pouch, thus adapted for very singular purposes. Yet
this is nothing to what Ruysch assures us, who avers that a man has been
seen to hide his whole leg, boot and all, in the monstrous jaws of one of
these animals. At first appearance this would seem impossible, as the
sides of the under chap, from which the bag depends, are not above an inch
asunder when the bird's bill is first opened; but then they are capable of
great separation; and it must necessarily be so <PB N="53" REF="61"/>
as the bird preys upon the largest fishes, and hides them by dozens in its
pouch. Tertre affirms that it will hide as many fish as will serve sixty
hungry men for a meal.</P>
<P>Such is the formation of this extraordinary bird, which is a
native of Africa and America. The pelican was once also known in Europe,
particularly in Russia; but it seems to have de∣serted our coasts.
This is the bird of which so many fabulous accounts have been propagated;
such as its feeding its young with its own blood, and its carrying a
provision of water for them in its great reservoir in the desart. But the
ab∣surdity of the first account answers itself; and as for the latter,
the pelican uses its bag for very different purposes than that of filling
it with water.</P>
<P>Its amazing pouch may be considered as ana∣logous to the
crop in other birds, with this dif∣ference, that as theirs lies at the bottom
of the gullet, so this is placed at the top. Thus, as pigeons and other birds
macerate their food for their young in their crops, and then supply them,
so the pelican supplies its young by a more ready contrivance, and
macerates their food in its bill, or stores it for its own particular
sustenance.</P>
<P>The ancients were particularly fond of giving 
<PB N="54" REF="62"/> this bird admirable qualities and parental af∣fections:
struck, perhaps, with its extraordinary figure, they were willing to supply
it with as extraordinary appetites; and having found it with a large
reservoir, they were pleased with turning it to the most tender and
parental uses. But the truth is, the pelican is a very heavy, sluggish,
voracious bird, and very ill fitted to take those flights, or to make those
cautious provisions for a distant time, which we have been told they do.
Father Labat, who seems to have studied their manners with great
exact∣ness, has given us a minute history of this bird, as found in
America; and from him I will borrow mine.</P>
<P>The pelican, says Labat, has strong wings, furnished
with thick plumage of an ash-colour, as are the rest of the feathers over
the whole body. Its eyes are very small, when compared to the size of its
head; there is a sadness in its countenance, and its whole air is
melancholly. It is as dull and reluctant in its motions, as the flamingo is
sprightly and active. It is slow of flight; and when it rises to fly,
performs it with difficulty and labour. Nothing, as it would seem, but the
spur of necessity, could make these birds change their situation, or
induce them to ascend into the air: but they must either starve or
fly.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="63"/>They are torpid and inactive to the last
degree, so that nothing can exceed their indo∣lence but their gluttony; it is
only from the stimulations of hunger that they are excited to labour; for
otherwise they would continue al∣ways in fixed repose. When they have
raised themselves about thirty or forty feet above the surface of the
sea, they turn their head with one eye downwards, and continue to fly in that
posture. As soon as they perceive a fish suf∣ficiently near the
surface, they dart down upon it with the swiftness of an arrow, seize
it with unerring certainty, and store it up in their pouch. They then rise
again, though not with∣out great labour, and continue hovering and fishing,
with their head on one side as before.</P>
<P>This work they continue with great effort and industry till
their bag is full, and then they fly to land to devour and digest at
leisure the fruits of their industry. This, however, it would appear they
are not long performing; for towards night they have another hungry call; and
they again reluctantly go to labour. At night, when their fishing is over,
and the toil of the day crowned with success, these lazy birds retire a
little way from the shore; and, though with the webbed feet and clumsy
figure of a goose, they will be contented to perch no where but upon trees 
<PB N="56" REF="64"/> among the light and airy tenants of the forest. There
they take their repose for the night; and often spend a great part of the
day, except such times as they are fishing, sitting in dismal
solemnity, and as it would seem half asleep. Their attitude is, with the
head resting upon their great bag, and that resting upon their breast.
There they remain without motion, or once changing their situation, till the
calls of hunger break their repose, and till they find it indispensibly
necessary to fill their magazine for a fresh meal. Thus their life is
spent between sleeping and eating; and our author adds, that they are as
foul as they are voracious, as they are every moment voiding excrements in
heaps as large as one's fist.</P>
<P>The same indolent habits seem to attend them even in
preparing for incubation, and defending their young when excluded. The female
makes no preparation for her nest, nor seems to chuse any place in
preference to lay in; but drops her eggs on the bare ground to the number of
five or six, and there continues to hatch them. At∣tached to the place,
without any desire of de∣fending her eggs or her young, she tamely sits
and suffers them to be taken from under her. Now and then she just
ventures to peck, or to cry out when a person offers to beat her off.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="65"/>She feeds her young with fish macerated
for some time in her bag; and when they cry flies off for a new supply.
Labat tells us that he took two of these when very young, and tied them by
the leg to a post stuck into the ground, where he had the pleasure of
seeing the old one for several days come to feed them, remaining with them
the greatest part of the day, and spending the night on the branch of a
tree that hung over them. By these means they were all three become so
familiar, that they suffered themselves to be handled; and the young ones
very kindly accepted whatever fish he offered them. These they always put
first into their bag, and then swallowed at their leisure.</P>
<P>It seems, however, that they are but dis∣agreeable and
useless domestics; their gluttony can scarcely be satisfied; their
flesh smells very rancid; and tastes a thousand times worse than it
smells. The native Americans kill vast numbers; not to eat, for they are
not fit even for the banquet of a savage; but to convert their large bags
into purses and tobacco-pouches. They bestow no small pains in
dress∣ing the skin with salt and ashes, rubbing it well with oil, and
then forming it to their purpose. It thus becomes so soft and pliant,
that the Spanish women sometimes adorn it <PB N="58" REF="66"/> with gold
and embroidery to make work-bags of.</P>
<P>Yet, with all the seeming hebetude of this bird, it is not
entirely incapable of instruction in a domestic state. Father Raymond
assures us, that he has seen one so tame and well edu∣cated among the
native Americans, that it would go off in the morning at the word of command,
and return before night to its master, with its great paunch distended with
plunder; a part of which the savages would make it dis∣gorge, and a part
they would permit it to re∣serve for itself.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The Pelican," as Faber relates, "is not
destitute of other qualifications. One of those which was brought alive to
the Duke of Ba∣varia's court, where it lived forty years, seemed to be
possessed of very uncommon sensations. It was much delighted in the
company and conversation of men, and in music both vocal and
instrumental; for it would willingly stand," says he, "by those that
sung or sounded the trumpet; and stretching out its head, and turning its
ear to the music, listened very attentively to its harmony, though its own
voice was little pleasanter than the braying of an ass."</Q> Gesner tells
us that the emperor Maximilian had a tame pelican <PB N="59" REF="67"/> which
lived for above eighty years, and that always attended his army on their march.
It was one of the largest of the kind, and had a daily allowance by the
emperor's orders. As another proof of the great age to which the pelican lives,
Aldrovandus makes mention of one of these birds that was kept several years
at Mechlin, and was verily believed to be fifty years old.—We often see
these birds at our shews about town.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Albatross, the first of the Gull
Kind.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH this is one of the largest and most formidable
birds of Africa and America, yet we have but few accounts to enlighten us in
its history. The figure of the bird is thus described by Edwards. 
<Q REND="inline">"The body is rather larger than that of the
pelican; and its wings when extended ten feet from tip to tip. The bill, which
is six inches long, is yellowish, and terminates in a crooked point. The
top of the head is of a bright brown; the back is of a dirty deep spotted
brown; and the belly and under the wings is white; the toes, which are webbed,
are of a flesh colour."</Q></P>
<P>Such are the principal traits in this bird's figure: but
these lead us a very short way in its history; and our naturalists have
thought fit to say nothing more. However, I am apt to believe this bird to be
the same with that described by Wicquefort, under the title of the
Alcatraz; its size, its colours, and its prey incline me to think so. He
describes it as a kind of great gull, as large in the body as a 
<PB N="61" REF="69"/> goose, of a brown colour, with a long bill, and living
upon fish, of which they kill great numbers.</P>
<P>This bird is an inhabitant of the tropical cli∣mates, and
also beyond them as far as the Streights of Magellan in the South Seas. It is
one of the most fierce and formidable of the aquatic tribe, not only living
upon fish, but also such small water-fowl as it can take by surprize.
It preys, as all the gull-kind do, upon the wing; and chiefly pursues the
flying-fish, that are forced from the sea by the dolphins. The ocean in
that part of the world presents a very different appearance from the seas
with which we are surrounded. In our seas we see nothing but a dreary
expanse, ruffled by winds, and seemingly for∣saken by every class of
animated nature. But the tropical seas, and the distant southern
lati∣tudes beyond them, are all alive with birds and fishes, pursuing and
pursued. Every various species of the gull-kind are there seen hovering
on the wing, at a thousand miles distance from the shore. The flying
fish are every moment rising to escape from their pursuers of the deep,
only to encounter equal dangers in the air. Just as they rise the dolphin
is seen to dart after them, but generally in vain; the gull has more frequent
success, and often takes them at their <PB N="62" REF="70"/> rise; while
the albatross pursues the gull, and obliges it to relinquish its prey:
so that the whole horizon presents but one living picture of rapacity and
evasion.</P>
<P>So much is certain; but how far we are to credit Wicquefort,
in what he adds concern∣ing this bird, the reader is left to determine 
<Q REND="inline">"As these birds, except when they breed,
live entirely remote from land, so they are often seen, as it should
seem, sleeping in the air. At night, when they are pressed by
slumber, they rise into the clouds as high as they can; there, putting
their head under one wing, they beat the air with the other, and seem to take
their ease. After a time, however, the weight of their bodies, only thus half
supported, brings them down; and they are seen descending, with a pretty
rapid motion, to the surface of the sea. Upon this they again put forth
their efforts to rise; and thus alternately ascend and descend at their
ease. But it sometimes happens," says my author, "that, in these
slumbering flights, they are off their guard, and fall upon deck, where they
are taken."</Q></P>
<P>What truth there may be in this account, I will not take it
upon me to determine; but certain it is, that few birds float upon the air 
<PB N="63" REF="71"/> with more ease than the albatross, or support
themselves a longer time in that element. They seem never to feel the
accesses of fatigue; but night and day upon the wing are always prowl∣ing,
yet always emaciated and hungry.</P>
<P>But though this bird be one of the most formidable tyrants
of the deep, there are some associations which even tyrants themselves
form, to which they are induced either by caprice or necessity. The
albatross seems to have a pe∣culiar affection for the penguin, and a
pleasure in its society. They are always seen to chuse the same
places for breeding; some distant, unin∣habited island, where the ground
slants to the sea, as the penguin is not formed either for flying or
climbing. In such places their nests are seen together, as if they
stood in need of mutual assistance and protection. Captain Hunt, who
for some time commanded at our settle∣ment upon Falkland Islands,
assures me, that he was often amazed at the union preserved between
these birds, and the regularity with which they built together. In that bleak
and desolate spot, where the birds had long con∣tinued undisturbed
possessors, and no way dreaded the encroachments of men, they seemed
to make their abode as comfortable as they ex∣pected it to be lasting. They
were seen to <PB N="64" REF="72"/> build with an amazing degree of uniformity;
their nests covering fields by thousands, and resembling a regular
plantation. In the middle, on high, the albatross raised its nest, on
heath sticks and long grass, about two feet above the surface: round this
the penguins made their lower settlements, rather in holes in the ground; and
most usually eight penguins to one alba∣tross. Nothing is a stronger
proof of Mr. Buffon's fine observation, that the presence of man not only
destroys the society of meaner animals, but their instincts also.
These nests are now, I am told, totally destroyed; the society is broke
up; and albatross and penguin have gone to breed upon more desert shores,
in greater security.</P>

<PB N="65" REF="73"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The Cormorant.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cormorant is about the size of a large Muscovy duck,
and may be distinguished from all other birds of this kind, by its four
toes being united by membranes together; and by the middle toe being toothed or
notched, like a saw, to assist it in holding its fishy prey. The head
and neck of this bird are of a sooty blackness; and the body thick and
heavy, more inclining in figure to that of the goose than the gull. The bill
is straight, till near the end, where the upper chap bends into a hook.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the seeming heaviness of its make,
there are few birds more powerfully predaceous. As soon as the winter
approaches, they are seen dispersed along the sea-shore, and
ascending up the mouths of fresh-water rivers, carrying destruction to
all the finny tribe. They are most remarkably voracious, and have a most
sudden digestion. Their appetite is for ever craving, and never
satisfied. This gnaw∣ing sensation may probably be encreased by the
great quantity of small worms that fill their in∣testines, and which their
unceasing gluttony contributes to engender.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="74"/>Thus formed with the grossest
appetites, this unclean bird has the most rank and disa∣greeable smell,
and is more foetid than even car∣rion, when in its most healthful state.
Its form, says an ingenious modern, is disagreeable; its voice is hoarse
and croaking; and all its qua∣lities obscene. No wonder then that Milton
should make Satan personate this bird, when he sent him upon the
basest purposes, to survey with pain the beauties of Paradise, and to
sit devising death on the tree of life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><BIBL>Vide
Penant's Zoology, p. 477.</BIBL></NOTE>. It has been remarked, however, of our
poet, that the making a water-fowl perch on a tree, im∣plied no great
acquaintance with the history of nature. In vindication of Milton,
Aristotle expressly says, that the cormorant is the only water-fowl that
sits on trees. We have already seen the pelican of this number; and the
cor∣morant's toes seem as fit for perching upon trees as for swimming; so
that our epic bard seems to have been as deeply versed in natural history
as in criticism.</P>
<P>Indeed, this bird seems to be of a multiform nature; and
wherever fish are to be found, watches their migrations. It is seen as well
by land as sea; it fishes in fresh-water lakes, as well as in the depths
of the ocean; it builds <PB N="67" REF="75"/> in the cliffs of rocks, as well as
on trees; and preys not only in the day-time, but by night.</P>
<P>Its indefatigable nature, and its great power in catching
fish, were probably the motives that induced some nations to breed this
bird up tame, for the purposes of fishing; and Wil∣loughby assures us,
it was once used in England for that purpose. The description of their
man∣ner of fishing is thus delivered by Faber. 
<Q REND="inline">"When they carry them out of the rooms where
they are kept, to the fish-pools, they hood-wink them, that they may not be
fright∣ed by the way. When they are come to the rivers, they take off their
hoods; and having tied a leather thong round the lower part of their necks,
that they may not swallow down the fish they catch, they throw them into
the river. They presently dive under water; and there, for a long time, with
wonderful swiftness, pursue the fish; and when they have caught them,
rise to the top of the water, and pressing the fish lightly with their
bills, swallow them; till each bird hath, after this manner, de∣voured five
or six fishes. Then their keepers call them to the fist, to which they
readily fly; and, one after another, vomit up all their fish, a little
bruised with the first nip <PB N="68" REF="76"/> given in catching them.
When they have done fishing, setting the birds on some high place, they
loose the string from their necks, leaving the passage to the stomach
free and open; and, for their reward, they throw them part of their prey; to
each one or two fishes, which they will catch most dexterously, as they
are falling in the air."</Q></P>
<P>At present, the cormorant is trained up in every part of
China for the same purpose, where there are many lakes and canals. 
<Q REND="inline">"To this end," says Le Comte, "they are
educated as men rear up spaniels or hawks; and one man can easily manage an
hundred. The fisher carries them out into the lake, perched on the gunnel of
his boat, where they con∣tinue tranquil, and expecting his orders with
patience. When arrived at the proper place, at the first signal given each
flies a different way, to fulfil the task assigned it. It is very
pleasant, on this occasion, to behold with what sagacity they portion out
the lake or the canal where they are upon duty. They hunt about, they plunge,
they rise an hun∣dred times to the surface, until they have at last found
their prey. They then seize it with their beak by the middle, and carry it
without fail to their master. When the fish <PB N="69" REF="77"/> is too
large, they then give each other mu∣tual assistance: one seizes it by
the head, the other by the tail, and in this manner carry it to the boat
together. There the boat-man stretches out one of his long oars, on which
they perch, and being delivered of their bur∣then, they fly off to pursue
their sport. When they are wearied, he lets them rest for a while; but they
are never fed till their work is over. In this manner they supply a very
plentiful table; but still their natural gluttony cannot be reclaimed even by
education. They have always, while they fish, the same string fastened
round their throats, to prevent them from devouring their prey, as otherwise
they would at once satiate themselves, and discontinue their pursuit
the moment they had filled their bellies."</Q></P>
<P>As for the rest, the cormorant is the best fisher of all
birds; and though fat and heavy with the quantity it devours, is nevertheless
generally upon the wing. The great activity with which it pursues, and from a
vast height drops down to dive after its prey, offers one of the most
amusing spectacles to those who stand upon a cliff on the shore. This
large bird is seldom seen in the air, but where there are fish below; but
then they must be near the <PB N="70" REF="78"/> surface, before it will
venture to souse upon them. If they are at a depth beyond what the impetus
of its flight makes the cormorant ca∣pable of diving to, they certainly
escape him; for this bird cannot move so fast under water, as the fish
can swim. It seldom, however, makes an unsuccessful dip; and is often
seen rising heavily, with a fish larger than it can readily devour. It
sometimes also happens, that the cormorant has caught the fish by the
tail; and consequently the fins prevent its being easily swallowed in
that position. In this case, the bird is seen to toss its prey above
its head, and very deterously to catch it, when descending, by the proper
end, and so swallow it with ease.</P>

<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Gannet or Soland Goose.</HEAD>
<P>THE Gannet is of the size of a tame goose, but its wings
much longer, being six feet over. The bill is six inches long, straight
almost to the point, where it inclines down, and the sides are irregularly
jagged, that it may hold its prey with greater security. It differs from the
cormorant in size, being larger; in its co∣lour, which is chiefly white; and
by its having no nostrils, but in their place a long furrow that reaches
almost to the end of the bill. From the corner of the mouth is a narrow
slip of black bare skin, that extends to the hind part of the head; beneath
the skin is another that, like the pouch of the pelican, is dilatable, and of
size sufficient to contain five or six entire herrings, which in the
breeding season it carries at once to its mate or its young.</P>
<P>These birds, which subsist entirely upon fish,
chiefly resort to those uninhabited islands where their food is found in
plenty, and men seldom come to disturb them. The islands to the north of
Scotland, the Skelig islands of the coasts of Kerry, in Ireland, and
those <PB N="72" REF="80"/> that lie in the north sea off Norway, abound
with them. But it is on the Bass island, in the Firth of Edinburgh, where
they are seen in the greatest abundance. 
<Q REND="inline">"There is a small island," says the
celebrated Harvey, "called the Bass, not more than a mile in circumference.
The surface is almost wholly covered during the months of May and June with
their nests, their eggs and young. It is scarcely possible to walk
without treading on them: the flocks of birds upon the wing, are so numerous,
as to darken the air like a cloud; and their noise is such, that one
cannot, without dif∣ficulty, be heard by the person next to him. When one
looks down upon the sea from the precipice, its whole surface seems
covered with infinite numbers of birds of different kinds, swimming and
pursuing their prey. If, in sailing round the island, one surveys its
hanging cliffs, in every crag or fissure of the broken rocks, may be seen
innume∣rable birds, of various sorts and sizes, more than the stars of
heaven, when viewed in a serene night. If they are viewed at a distance,
either receding, or in their approach to the island, they seem like one
vast swarm of bees."</Q></P>
<P>They are not less frequent upon the rocks 
<PB N="73" REF="81"/> of St. Kilda. Martin assures us, that the in∣habitants
of that small island consume annually near twenty-three thousand young
birds of this species, besides an amazing quantity of their eggs. On
these they principally subsist through∣out the year; and from the
number of these visitants, make an estimate of their plenty for the
season. They preserve both the eggs and fowls in small pyramidal
stone buildings, co∣vering them with turf-ashes, to prevent the evaporation
of their moisture.</P>
<P>The gannet is a bird of passage. In winter it seeks the
more southern coasts of Cornwall, hovering over the shoals of herrings
and pil∣chards that then come down from the northern seas: its first
appearance in the northern islands, is in the beginning of spring; and it
con∣tinues to breed till the end of summer. But, in general, its motions are
determined by the migrations of the immense shoals of herrings that come
pouring down at that season through the British Channel, and supply all
Europe as well as this bird with their spoil. The gannet assiduously
attends the shoal in their passage, keeps with them in their whole
circuit round our island, and shares with our fishermen this
exhaustless banquet. As it is strong of wing, it never comes near the
land; but is constant <PB N="74" REF="82"/> to its prey. Wherever the gannet
is seen, it is sure to announce to the fishermen the arrival of the finny
tribe; they then prepare their nets, and take the herrings by millions at a
draught; while the gannet, who came to give the first informa∣tion, comes,
though an unbidden guest, and often snatches its prey from the fisherman
even in his boat. While the fishing season continues, the gannets are
busily employed; but when the pilchards disappear from our coasts, the
gannet takes its leave, to keep them company.</P>
<P>The cormorant has been remarked for the quickness of his
sight; yet in this the gannet seems to exceed him. It is possessed
of a transparent membrane under the eye-lid, with which it covers the whole
eye at pleasure, without obscuring the sight in the smallest de∣gree.
This seems a necessary provision for the security of the eyes of so
weighty a crea∣ture, whose method of taking prey, like that of the cormorant,
is by darting headlong down from an height of an hundred feet and more into the
water to seize it. These birds are sometimes taken at sea, by
fastening a pilchard to a board, which they leave floating. The gannet
instantly pounces down from above upon the board, and is killed or maimed by
the shock of a body where it expected no resistance.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="83"/>These birds breed but once a year, and
lay but one egg, which being taken away, they lay another; if that is also
taken, then a third; but never more for that season. Their egg is white,
and rather less than that of the com∣mon goose; and their nest large,
composed of such substances as are found floating on the surface of
the sea. The young birds, during the first year, differ greatly in colour
from the old ones; being of a dusky hue, speckled with numerous triangular
white spots; and at that time resembling the colours of the speckled
diver.</P>
<P>The Bass Island, where they chiefly breed, belongs to one
proprietor; so that care is taken never to fright away the birds when laying,
or to shoot them upon the wing. By that means, they are so confident as to
alight and feed their young ones close beside you. They feed only upon
fish, as was observed; yet the young gannet is counted a great dainty by
the Scots, and sold very dear; so that the lord of the islet makes a
considerable annual profit by the sale.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of smaller Gulls and Petrels.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING described the manners of the great ones of this
tribe, those of the smaller kinds may be easily inferred. They resemble
the more powerful in their appetites for prey, but have not such certain
methods of obtaining it. In general, therefore, the industry of this tribe
and their audacity encrease in proportion to their imbecility; the great
gulls live at the most remote distance from man; the smaller are obliged
to reside wherever they can take their prey; and to come into the most
populous places when solitude can no longer grant them a supply. In this
class we may place the Gull, pro∣perly so called, of which there are above
twenty different kinds; the Petrel, of which there are three; and the Sea
swallow, of which there are as many. The gulls may be distinguished by an
angular knob on the lower-chap; the petrels by their wanting this knob; and the
sea-swallow, by their bills, which are straight, slender, and sharp
pointed. They all, however, agree in their appetites and their places of
abode.</P>
<P>The gull, and all its varieties, is very well 
<PB N="77" REF="85"/> known in every part of the kingdom. It is seen with a
slow-sailing flight hovering over rivers to prey upon the smaller kinds
of fish; it is seen following the plowman in fallow fields to pick up
insects; and when living animal food does not offer, it has even been known
to eat car∣rion and whatever else of the kind that offers. Gulls are found in
great plenty in every place; but it is chiefly round our boldest rockiest
shores that they are seen in the greatest abun∣dance; it is there that
the gull breeds and brings up its young; it is there that millions of them are
heard screaming with discordant notes for months together.</P>
<P>Those who have been much upon our coasts know that there
are two different kinds of shores; that which slants down to the water with
a gentle declivity, and that which rises with a precipitate boldness, and
seems set as a bulwark to repel the force of the invading deeps. It is to
such shores as these that the whole tribe of the gull-kind resort, as
the rocks offer them a retreat for their young, and the sea a sufficient
supply. It is in the cavities of these rocks, of which the shore is
composed, that the vast variety of sea-fowls retire to breed in fafety.
The waves beneath, that continually beat at the base, often wear 
<PB N="78" REF="86"/> the shore into an impending boldness; so that it
seems to jut out over the water, while the raging of the sea makes the
place inaccessible from below. These are the situations to which
sea-fowl chiefly resort, and bring up their young in undisturbed
security.</P>
<P>Those who have never observed our boldest coasts have
no idea of their tremendous subli∣mity. The boasted works of art, the
highest towers, and the noblest domes, are but ant-hills when put in
comparison: the single cavity of a rock often exhibits a coping higher than
the cieling of a gothic cathedral. The face of the shore offers to the view a
wall of massive stone ten times higher than our tallest steeples.
What should we think of a precipice three quarters of a mile in height; and
yet the rocks of St. Kilda are still higher! What must be our awe to
approach the edge of that impending height, and to look down on the
unfathomable vacuity below; to ponder on the terrors of falling to the bottom,
where the waves that swell like moun∣tains are scarcely seen to curl on
the surface, and the roar of an ocean a thousand leagues broad appears
softer than the murmur of a brook! It is in these formidable mansions
that myriads of sea-fowls are for ever seen sporting, flying in
security down the depth, half a mile <PB N="79" REF="87"/> beneath the feet of
the spectator. The crow and the chough avoid those frightful preci∣pices;
they chuse smaller heights, where they are less exposed to the
tempest; it is the cor∣morant, the gannet, the tarrock, and the terne, that
venture to these dreadful retreats, and claim an undisturbed
possession. To the spectator from above, those birds, though some
of them are above the size of an eagle, seem scarce as large as a
swallow; and their loudest screaming is scarce perceptible.</P>
<P>But the generality of our shores are not so formidable.
Though they may rise two hun∣dred fathom above the surface, yet it often
happens that the water forsakes the shore at the departure of the tide, and
leaves a noble and delightful walk for curiosity on the beach. Not to mention
the variety of shells with which the sand is strewed, the lofty rocks
that hang over the spectator's head, and that seem but just kept from
falling, produce in him no unpleasing gloom. If to this be added the
fluttering, the screaming, and the pursuits of myriads of water-birds, all
either intent on the duties of incubation, or rouzed at the presence of a
stran∣ger, nothing can compose a scene of more pe∣culiar solemnity. To
walk along the shore when the tide is departed, or to sit in the hollow 
<PB N="80" REF="88"/> of a rock when it is come in, attentive to the various
sounds that gather on every side, above and below, may raise the mind to
its highest and noblest exertions. The solemn roar of the waves
swelling into and subsiding from the vast caverns beneath, the piercing
note of the gull, the frequent chatter of the guillemot, the loud note of the
auk, the scream of the heron, and the hoarse deep periodical croaking of
the cor∣morant, all unite to furnish out the grandeur of the scene, and
turn the mind to him who is the Essence of all sublimity.</P>
<P>Yet it often happens that the contemplation of a sea-shore
produces ideas of an humbler kind, yet still not unpleasing. The various
arts of these birds to seize their prey, and some∣times to elude their
pursuers, their society among each other, and their tenderness and care
of their young, produce gentler sensations. It is ridiculous also now and
then to see their various ways of imposing upon each other. It is common
enough, for instance, with the arctic gull, to pursue the lesser gulls
so long, that they drop their excrements through fear, which the hungry
hunter quickly gobbles up before it ever reaches the water. In breeding too
they have frequent contests: one bird who has no nest of her own attempts
to dispossess another, <PB N="81" REF="89"/> and put herself in the
place. This often hap∣pens among all the gull-kind; and I have seen the poor
bird, thus displaced by her more powerful invader, sit near the nest in
pensive discontent, while the other seemed quite com∣fortable in her new
habitation. Yet this place of pre-eminence is not easily obtained; for the
instant the invader goes to snatch a moment∣ary sustenance, the other
enters upon her own, and always ventures another battle be∣fore she
relinquishes the justness of her claim. The contemplation of a cliff thus
covered with hatching-birds affords a very agreeable enter∣tainment; and as
they sit upon the ledges of the rocks, one above another, with their white
breasts forward, the whole groupe has not un∣aptly been compared to an
apothecary's shop.</P>
<P>These birds, like all others of the rapacious kind, lay but
few eggs; and hence, in many places, their number is daily seen to
diminish. The lessening of so many rapacious birds may, at first
sight, appear a benefit to mankind; but when we consider how many of the
na∣tives of our islands are sustained by their flesh, either fresh or
salted, we shall find no satisfac∣tion in thinking that those poor
people may in time lose their chief support. The gull in general, as was
said, builds on the ledges of <PB N="82" REF="90"/> rocks, and lays from one
egg to three, in a nest formed of long grass and sea-weed. Most of the
kind are fishy tasted, with black stringy flesh; yet the young ones are
better food: and of these, with several other birds of the penguin kind,
the poor inhabitants of our northern islands make their wretched ban∣quets.
They have been long used to no other food; and even salted gull can be
relished by those who know no better. Almost all delicacy is a relative
thing; and the man who repines at the luxuries of a well-served table,
starves not for want but from comparison. The luxuries of the poor are
indeed coarse to us, yet still they are luxuries to those ignorant of
better; and it is probable enough that a Kilda or a Feroe man may be found to
exist, outdoing Apicius himself, in consulting the pleasures of the
table. Indeed, if it be true that such meat as is the most dangerously
earned is the sweetest, no men can dine so luxuriously as these, as
none venture so hardly in the pur∣suit of a dinner. In Jacobson's
history of the Feroe Islands, we have an account of the me∣thod in which
those birds are taken; and I will deliver it in his own simple manner.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"It cannot be expressed with what pains
and danger they take these birds in those high steep cliffs, whereof many
are two hundred fa∣thoms <PB N="83" REF="91"/> high. But there are men apt by
nature and fit for the work, who take them usually in two manners: they
either climb from below into these high promontories, that are as steep as
a wall; or they let themselves down with a rope from above. When they climb
from below, they have a pole five or six ells long, with an iron hook at the
end, which they that are below in the boat, or on the cliff, fasten unto the
man's girdle, helping him up thus to the highest place where he can get
footing: afterwards they also help up another man; and thus several climb
up as high as possibly they can; and where they find diffi∣culty, they help
each other up, by thrusting one another up with their poles. When the first
hath taken footing, he draws the other up to him, by the rope fastened to his
waste; and so they proceed, till they come to the place where the birds
build. They there go about as well as they can, in those dangerous places;
the one holding the rope at one end, and fixing himself to the rock; the
other going at the other end from place to place. If it should happen that he
chanceth to fall, the other that stands firm keeps him up, and helps him up
again. But if he passeth safe, he likewise fastens himself till the
other has <PB N="84" REF="92"/> passed the same dangerous place also.
Thus they go about the cliffs after birds as they please. It often happeneth,
however, the more is the pity, that when one doth not stand fast enough, or
is not sufficiently strong to hold up the other in his fall, that they both
fall down and are killed. In this man∣ner some do perish every
year."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Peter Clanson, in his description of Norway, writeth,
that there was antiently a law in that country, that whosoever climbed so
on the cliffs, that he fell down and died, if the body was found, before
burial, his next kins∣man should go the same way; but if he durst not
or could not do it, the dead body was not then to be buried in sanctified
earth, as the person was too full of temerity, and his own destroyer.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"When the fowlers are come, in the man∣ner
aforesaid, to the birds within the cliffs, where people seldom come, the
birds are so tame that they take them with their hands; for they will not
readily leave their young. But when they are wild, they cast a net, with
which they are provided, over them, and intangle them therein. In the mean
time, there lieth a boat beneath in the sea, wherein they cast the birds
killed; and in this manner they can, in a short time, fill a 
<PB N="85" REF="93"/> boat with fowl. When it is pretty fair weather, and there
is good fowling, the fowlers stay in the cliffs seven or eight days
together; for there are here and there holes in the rocks, where they can
safely rest; and they have meat let down to them with a line from the top
of the mountain. In the mean time some go every day to them, to fetch home
what they have taken. 
<P> "Some rocks are so difficult, that they can in no
manner get unto them from below; wherefore they seek to come down thereunto
from above. For this purpose they have a rope, eighty or a hundred fathoms
long, made of hemp, and three fingers thick. The fowler maketh the end of this
fast about his waist, and between his legs, so that he can sit thereon;
and is thus let down, with the fowling staff in his hand. Six men hold by the
rope, and let him easily down, laying a large piece of wood on the brink of
the rock, upon which the rope glideth, that it may not be worn to pieces by the
hard and rough edge of the stone. They have besides, another small line,
that is fastened to the fowler's body; on which he pulleth, to give them
notice how they should let down the great rope, either lower or higher; or to
hold still, <PB N="86" REF="94"/> that he may stay in the place whereunto he
is come. Here the man is in great danger, because of the stones that are
loosened from the cliff, by the swinging of the rope, and he cannot avoid
them. To remedy this, in some measure, he hath usually on his head a
seaman's thick and shaggy cap, which defends him from the blows of the
stones, if they be not too big; and then it costeth him his life:
nevertheless, they continually put themselves in that danger, for the
wretched body's food-sake, hoping in God's mercy and protection, unto which
the greatest part of them do de∣voutly recommend themselves when they go to
work: otherwise, they say, there is no other great danger in it, except
that it is a toilsome and artificial labour; for he that hath not learned to
be so let down, and is not used thereto, is turned about with the rope,
so that he soon groweth giddy, and can do nothing; but he that hath learned
the art, considers it as a sport, swings himself on the rope, sets
his feet against the rock, casts himself some fathoms from thence, and
shoots himself to what place he will: he knows where the birds are, he
undestands how to sit on the line in the air, and how to hold the
fowling-staff in his hand; striking therewith <PB N="87" REF="95"/> the
birds that come or fly away: and when there are holes in the rocks, and it
stretches itself out, making underneath as a cieling, under which the birds
are, he knoweth how to shoot himself in among them, and there take firm
footing. There, when he is in these holes, he maketh himself loose of the
rope, which he fastens to a crag of the rock, that it may not slip from him
to the outside of the cliff. He then goes about in the rock, taking the fowl,
either with his hands or with the fowling-staff. Thus, when he hath killed as
many birds as he thinks fit, he ties them in a bundle, and fastens them to a
little rope, giving a sign, by pulling, that they should draw them up. When
he has wrought thus the whole day, and desires to get up again, he sitteth
once more upon the great rope, giving a new sign, that they should pull him
up; or else he worketh him∣self up, climbing along the rope, with his
girdle full of birds. It is also usual, where there are not folks enough to
hold the great rope, for the fowler to drive a post sloping into the earth,
and to make a rope fast thereto, by which he lets himself down, without any
body's help, to work in the manner afore∣said. <PB N="88" REF="96"/> Some
rocks are so formed that the person can go into their cavities by land.</P>

<P> "These manners are more terrible and dan∣gerous to
see than to describe; especially if one considers the steepness and
height of the rocks, it seeming impossible for a man to approach them,
much less to climb or de∣scend. In some places, the fowlers are seen
climbing where they can only fasten the ends of their toes and fingers; not
shunning such places, though there be an hundred fathom between them and
the sea. It is a dear meat for these poor people, for which they must
venture their lives; and many, after long venturing, do at last perish
therein.</P> 
<P> "When the fowl is brought home, a part thereof is eaten
fresh; another part, when there is much taken, being hung up for winter
provision. The feathers are gathered, to make merchandize of, for other
expences. The inhabitants get a great many of these fowls, as God giveth his
blessing and fit wea∣ther. When it is dark and hazy, they take most; for
then the birds stay in the rocks: but in clear weather, and hot
sun-shine, they seek the sea. When they prepare to depart for the
season, they keep themselves most there, sitting on the clifts toward
the sea∣side, <PB N="89" REF="97"/> where people get at them sometimes
with boats, and take them with fowling∣staves."</P> </Q></P>
<P>Such is the account of this historian; but we are not to
suppose that all the birds caught in this manner, are of the gull kind: on
the contrary, numbers of them are of the penguin kind; auks, puffins and
guillemots. These all come, once a season, to breed in these
recesses; and retire in winter, to fish in more southern climates.</P>

<PB N="90" REF="98"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Penguin Kind: and first of the Great
Magellanic Penguin.</HEAD>
<P>THE gulls are long winged, swift flyers, that hover over the
most extensive seas, and dart down upon such fish as approach too
near the surface. The penguin kind are but ill fitted for flight, and still
less for walking. Every body must have seen the aukward manner in which a
duck, either wild or tame, attempts to change place: they must recollect with
what soft∣ness and ease a gull or a kite waves its pinions, and with what
a coil and flutter the duck at∣tempts to move them; how many strokes it is
obliged to give, in order to gather a little air; and even when it is thus
raised, how soon it is fatigued with the force of its exertions, and
obliged to take rest again. But the duck is not, in its natural state, half
so unweildy an animal as the whole tribe of the penguin kind. Their wings are
much shorter, more scantily fur∣nished with quills, and the whole pinion
placed too forward, to be usefully employed. For this reason, the largest
of the penguin kind, that have a thick, heavy body to raise, cannot 
<PB N="91" REF="99"/> fly at all. Their wings serve them rather as paddles to
help them forward, when they at∣tempt to move swiftly; and in a manner walk
along the surface of the water. Even the smaller kinds seldom fly by
choice; they flut∣ter their wings with the swiftest efforts without making
way; and though they have but a small weight of body to sustain, yet they
sel∣dom venture to quit the water where they are provided with food and
protection.</P>
<P>As the wings of the penguin tribe are un∣fitted for flight,
their legs are still more auk∣wardly adapted for walking. This whole tribe
have all above the knee hid within the belly; and nothing appears but two
short legs, or feet, as some would call them, that seem stuck under the
rump, and upon which the animal is very aukwardly supported. They seem,
when sit∣ing or attempting to walk, like a dog that has been taught to sit
up, or to move a minuet. Their short legs drive the body in progression
from side to side; and were they not assisted by their wings, they
could scarcely move faster than a tortoise.</P>
<P>This aukward position of the legs, which so unqualifies
them for living upon land, adapts them admirably for a residence in water. In
that, the legs placed behind the moving body, <PB N="92" REF="100"/> pushes it
forward with greater velocity; and these birds, like Indian canoes, are the
swiftest in the water, by having their paddles in the rear. Our sailors,
for this reason, give these birds the very homely, but expressive, name
of Arse-feet.</P>
<P>Nor are they less qualified for diving than swimming. By
ever so little inclining their bodies forward, they lose their center of
gravity; and every stroke from their feet only tends to sink them the
faster. In this manner they can either dive at once to the bottom, or swim
between two waters; where they continue fishing for some minutes, and then
ascending, catch an instantaneous breath, to descend once more to renew
their ope∣rations. Hence it is that these birds, which are so
defenceless, and so easily taken by land, are impregnable by water. If
they perceive themselves pursued in the least, they instantly sink,
and shew nothing more than their bills, till the enemy is withdrawn. Their
very internal conformation assists their power of keeping long under
water. Their lungs are fitted with numerous vacuities, by which they can take
in a very large inspiration; and this probably serves them for a length of
time.</P>
<P>As they never visit land, except when they 
<PB N="93" REF="101"/> come to breed, their feathers take a colour from their
situation. That part of them which has been continually bathed in the water,
is white; while their backs and wings are of different colours, according to
the different species. They are also covered more warmly all over the body
with feathers, than any other birds whatever; so that the sea seems
entirely their element; and but for the necessary duties of propagating the
species, we should scarcely have the smallest opportunity of seeing
them, and should be utterly unacquainted with their history.</P>
<P>Of all this tribe, the Magellanic Penguin is the largest,
and the most remarkable. In size it approaches near that of a tame goose.
It never flies, as its wings are very short, and covered with stiff hard
feathers, and are always seen expanded, and hanging use∣lesly down by the
bird's sides. The upper part of the head, back and rump, are covered with
stiff, black feathers; while the belly and breast, as is common with all of
this kind, are of a snowy whiteness, except a line of black that is seen
to cross the crop. The bill, which from the base to about half way is
covered with wrinkles, is black, but marked crosswise with a stripe of
yellow. They walk <PB N="94" REF="102"/> erect with their heads on high, their
fin-like wings hanging down like arms; so that to see them at a distance,
they look like so many children with white aprons. From hence they are said
to unite in themselves the qualities of men, fowls and fishes. Like men,
they are up∣right; like fowls, they are feathered, and like fishes, they have
fin-like instruments, that beat the water before, and serve for all the
purposes of swimming rather than flying.</P>
<P>They feed upon fish; and seldom come ashore, except in
the breeding-season. As the seas in that part of the world abound with a
variety, they seldom want food; and their extreme fatness seems a proof
of the plenty in which they live. They dive with great rapidity, and are
voracious to a great degree. One of them, described by Clusius, though but
very young, would swallow an entire herring at a mouthful, and often three
suc∣cessively before it was appeased. In conse∣quence of this
gluttonous appetite, their flesh is rank and fishy; though our sailors
say, that <HI>it is pretty good eating.</HI> In some the flesh is so
tough, and the feathers so thick, that they stand the blow of a scymitar
without injury.</P>
<P>They are a bird of society; and especially when they come
on shore, they are seen drawn up <PB N="95" REF="103"/> in rank and file,
upon the ledge of a rock, standing together with the albatross, as if in
consulation. This is previous to their lay∣ing, which generally begins in
that part of the world in the month of November. Their preparations for laying
are attended with no great trouble, as a small depression in the earth,
without any other nest, serves for this purpose. The warmth of their
feathers and the heat of their bodies is such, that the pro∣gress of
incubation is carried on very rapidly.</P>
<P>But there is a difference in the manner of this bird's
nestling in other countries; which I can only ascribe to the frequent
disturbances it has received from man or quadrupedes in its recesses. In
some places, instead of content∣ing itself with a superficial
depression in the ground, the penguin is found to burrow two or three yards
deep: in other places it is seen to forsake the level, and to clamber up
the ledge of a rock, where it lays its egg, and hatches it in that bleak,
exposed situation. These precautions may probably have been taken, in
consequence of dear bought expe∣rience. In those countries where the bird
fears for her own safety, or that of her young, she may providentially
provide against danger, by digging, or even by climbing; for both which she
is but ill adapted by nature. In those places, <PB N="96" REF="104"/> however,
where the penguin has had but few visits from man, her nest is made, with
the most confident security, in the middle of some large plain, where
they are seen by thousands. In that unguarded situation, neither
expecting nor fearing a powerful enemy, they continue to sit brooding; and
even when man comes among them, have at first no apprehension of their
danger. Some of this tribe have been called, by our sea-men, the Booby, from
the total insensibility which they shew when they are sought to their
destruction. But it is not considered that these birds have never been
taught to know the dangers of an human enemy: it is against the fox or the
vulture that they have learned to defend themselves; but they have no idea of
injury from a being so very unlike their natural opposers. The pen∣guins,
therefore, when our sea-men first came among them, tamely suffered
themselves to be knocked on the head, without even attempting an escape.
They have stood to be shot at in flocks, without offering to move, in
silent won∣der, till every one of their number has been destroyed. Their
attachment to their nests was still more powerful; for the females tamely
suffered the men to approach and take their eggs, without any resistance.
But the expe∣perience of a few of those unfriendly visits, has 
<PB N="97" REF="105"/> long since taught them to be more upon their guard in
chusing their situations; or to leave those retreats where they were so
little able to oppose their invaders.</P>
<P>The penguin lays but one egg; and, in fre∣quented shores, is
found to burrow like a rab∣bit: sometimes three or four take
possession of one hole, and hatch their young together. In the holes of
the rocks, where Nature has made them a retreat, several of this tribe, as
Linnaeus assures us, are seen together. There the fe∣males lay their
single egg in a common nest, and sit upon this their general
possession by turns; while one is placed as a centinel, to give warning
of approaching danger. The egg of the penguin, as well as of all this tribe, is
very large for the size of the bird, being generally found bigger than that
of a goose. But as there are many varieties of the penguin, and as they
differ in size, from that of a Muscovy duck to a swan, the eggs differ in
the same proportion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="98" REF="106"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of the Auk, Puffin, and other Birds of the
Penguin Kind.</HEAD>
<P>OF a size far inferior to the penguin, but with nearly the
same form, and exactly of the same appetites and manners, there is a very
nu∣merous tribe. These frequent our shores, and, like the penguin, have
their legs placed be∣hind. They have short wings, which are not totally
incapable of flight; with round bills for seizing their prey, which is
fish. They live upon the water, in which they are continually seen diving;
and seldom venture upon land, except for the purposes of continuing their
kind.</P>
<P>The first of this smaller tribe is the Great Northern
Diver, which is nearly of the size of a goose: it is beautifully variegated
all over with many stripes, and differs from the penguin, in being much
slenderer and more elegantly formed. The Grey Speckled Diver does not exceed
the size of a Muscovy duck; and, ex∣cept in size, greatly resembles the
former. The Auk, which breeds on the islands of St. Kilda, and chiefly
differs from the penguin <PB N="99" REF="107"/> in size and colour. It is
smaller than a duck; and the whole of the breast and belly, as far as the
middle of the throat, is white. The Guillemot is about the same size; it
differs from the auk, in having a longer, a slenderer, and a straighter
bill. The Scarlet Throated Diver may be distinguished by its name; and the
Puffin or Coulterneb, is one of the most remarkable birds we know.</P>
<P>Words cannot easily describe the form of the bill of the
puffin, which differs so greatly from that of any other bird. Those who
have seen the coulter of a plough, may form some idea of the beak of this
odd-looking animal. The bill is flat; but, very different from that of the
duck, its edge is upwards. It is of a triangular figure, and ending in a
sharp point; the upper chap bent a little downward, where it is joined to the
head: and a certain callous substance encompassing its base, as in
parrots. It is of two colours; ash-coloured near the base, and red towards
the point. It has three fur∣rows or groves impressed in it; one in the
livid part, two in the red. The eyes are fenced with a protuberant skin, of a
livid-colour; and they are grey or ash-coloured. These are marks
sufficient to distinguish this bird by; but its <PB N="100" REF="108"/>
value to those in whose vicinity it breeds, ren∣ders it still more an
object of curiosity.</P>
<P>The puffin, like all the rest of this kind, has its legs
thrown so far back, that it can hardly move without tumbling. This makes it
rise with difficulty, and subject to many falls before it gets upon the
wing; but as it is a small bird, not much bigger than a pigeon, when it once
rises, it can continue its flight with great celerity.</P>
<P>Both this and all the former build no nest; but lay their
eggs either in the crevices of rocks, or in holes under ground near the
shore. They chiefly chuse the latter situation; for the puffin, the auk,
the guillemot, and the rest, cannot easily rise to the nest when in a
lofty situation. Many are the attempts these birds are seen to make to
fly up to those nests which are so high above the surface. In
ren∣dering them inaccessible to mankind, they often render them almost
inaccessible to them∣selves. They are frequently obliged to make three or
four efforts, before they can come at the place of incubation. For this
reason, the auk and guillemot, when they have once laid their single egg,
which is extremely large for the size, seldom forsake it until it is
excluded. The male, who is better furnished for flight, <PB N="101" REF="109"/> feeds the female during this interval; and so bare is the place
where she sits, that the egg would often roll down from the rock, did not
the body of the bird support it.</P>
<P>But the puffin seldom chuses these inaccessible and
troublesome heights for its situation. Re∣lying on its courage, and the
strength of its bill, with which it bites most terribly, it either makes or
finds a hole in the ground, where to lay and bring forth its young. All the
winter these birds, like the rest, are absent; visiting regions too
remote for discovery. At the latter end of March, or the beginning of April,
come over a troop of their spies or harbingers, that stay two or three
days, as it were to view and search out for their former situations, and
see whether all be well. This done, they once more depart; and, about the
beginning of May, return again with the whole army of their com∣panions. But if
the season happens to be stormy and tempestuous, and the sea
troubled, the unfortunate voyagers undergo incredible hardships; and they are
found, by hundreds, cast away upon the shores, lean and perished with
famine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Willoughby's Ornith. p.
326.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is most probable, therefore, that this voyage is
performed more on the water than in the air; and as they cannot fish 
<PB N="102" REF="110"/> in stormy weather, their strength is exhausted
before they can arrive at their wished-for harbour.</P>
<P>The puffin, when it prepares for breeding, which always
happens a few days after its ar∣rival, begins to scrape up an hole in the
ground not far from the shore, and when it has some way penetrated the
earth, it then throws itself upon its back, and with bill and claws thus
burrows inward, till it has dug a hole with several windings and turnings,
from eight to ten feet deep. It particularly seeks to dig under a stone,
where it expects the greatest security. In this fortified retreat it lays
one egg; which, though the bird be not much bigger than a pigeon, is of the
size of a hen.</P>
<P>When the young one's excluded, the parent's industry and
courage is incredible. Few birds or beasts will venture to attack them in
their retreats. When the great sea-raven, as Ja∣cobson informs us, comes to
take away their young, the puffins boldly oppose him. Their meeting affords a
most singular combat. As soon as the raven approaches, the puffin catches
him under the throat with its beak, and sticks its claws into his breast,
which makes the raven, with a loud screaming, attempt to get away; but the
little bird still holds fast to the invader, <PB N="103" REF="111"/> nor
lets him go till they both come to the sea, where they drop down together,
and the raven is drowned: yet the raven is but too often suc∣cessful; and
invading the puffin at the bottom of its hole, devours both the parent and its
family.</P>
<P>But were a punishment to be inflicted for immorality in
irrational animals, the puffin is justly a sufferer from invasion, as it
is often itself one of the most terrible invaders. Near the Isle of
Anglesey, in an islet called Priesholm, their flocks may be compared, for
multitude, to swarms of bees. In another islet, called the Calf of Man, a
bird of this kind, but of a different species, is seen in great abun∣dance.
In both places, numbers of rabbits are found to breed; but the puffin,
unwilling to be at the trouble of making a hole, when there is one ready made,
dispossesses the rabbits, and it is not unlikely destroys their
young. It is in these unjustly acquired retreats that the young puffins are
found in great numbers, and become a very valuable acquisition to the natives
of the place. The old ones (I am now speaking of the Manks puffin) early in
the morning, at break of day, leave their nests and young, and even the
island, nor do they return till night-fall. All this time they are diligently
<PB N="104" REF="112"/> employed in fishing for their young; so that their
retreats on land, which in the morning were loud and clamorous, are now still
and quiet, with not a wing stirring till the approach of dusk, when their
screams once more announce their return. Whatever fish, or other food, they
have procured in the day, by night begins to suffer a kind of half
digestion, and is reduced to an oily matter, which is ejected from the
sto∣mach of the old ones into the mouth of the young. By this they are
nourished, and be∣come fat to an amazing degree. When they are arrived to
their full growth, they who are intrusted by the lord of the island, draw
them from their holes; and, that they may more readily keep an account of the
number they take, cut off one foot as a token. Their flesh is said to be
excessively rank, as they feed upon fish, especially sprats and
sea-weed; however, when they are pickled and preserved with spices, they
are admired by those who are fond of high eating. We are told, that formerly
their flesh was allowed by the church on Lenten days. They were, at that
time, also taken by ferrets, as we do rabbits. At present, they are either
dug out, or drawn out, from their burrows, with an hooked stick. They bite
extremely hard, and keep such fast hold of whatsoever 
<PB N="105" REF="113"/> they seize upon, as not to be easily disengaged.
Their noise when taken is very disagreeable, being like the efforts of a
dumb person at∣tempting to speak.</P>
<P>The constant depredation, which these birds annually
suffer, does not in the least seem to intimidate them, or drive them
away: on the contrary, as the people say, the nest must be robbed, or the
old ones will breed there no longer. All birds of this kind lay but one egg;
yet if that be taken away, they will lay another, and so on to a third; which
seems to imply that robbing their nests does not much intimidate them from
laying again. Those, however, whose nests have been thus destroyed, are
often too late in bringing up their young; who, if they be not fledged and
prepared for mi∣gration when all the rest depart, are left at land to shift
for themselves. In August the whole tribe is seen to take leave of their
summer re∣sidence; nor are they observed any more till the return of the
ensuing spring. It is probable that they sail away to more southern
regions, as our mariners frequently see myriads of water-fowl upon their
return, and steering usually to the north. Indeed, the coldest countries
seem to be their most favoured retreats; and the number of water-fowl is
much greater in those <PB N="106" REF="114"/> colder climates, than in the
warmer regions, near the line. The quantity of oil which abounds in their
bodies, serves as a defence against cold, and preserves them in vigour
against its severity; but the same provision of oil is rather
detrimental in warm countries, as it turns rancid, and many of them die of
dis∣orders which arise from its putrefaction. In general, however,
water-fowl can be properly said to be of no climate; the element upon which
they live, being their proper residence. They necessarily spend a few
months of summer upon land, to bring up their young: but the rest of their
time is probably consumed in their migrations, or near some unknown
coasts, where their provision of fish is found in greatest
abundance.</P>
<P>Before I go to the third general division of water-fowls, it
may not be improper to observe, that there is one species of round billed
water-fowl, that does not properly lie within any of the former
distributions. This is the Goose-ander; a bird with the body and wing
shaped like those of the penguin kind, but with legs not hid in the belly.
It may be distinguished from all others by its bill, which is round, hooked
at the point, and toothed, both upper and under chap, like a saw. Its colours
are <PB N="107" REF="115"/> various and beautiful: however, its manners and
appetites entirely resemble those of the Diver. It feeds upon fish, for
which it dives; and is said to build its nest upon trees, like the heron
and the cormorant. It seems to form the shade between the penguin and the
goose kind; having a round bill, like the one; and unembarrassed legs,
like the other. In the shape of the head, neck and body, it resembles them
both.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of Birds of the Goose Kind, properly so
called.</HEAD>
<P>THE Swan, the Goose, and the Duck, are leaders of a
numerous, useful, and beautiful tribe of birds, that we have reclaimed from a
state of nature, and have taught to live in dependance about us. To
describe any of these would be as superfluous as definitions usually
are when given of things with which we are already well acquainted. There are
few that have not had opportunities of seeing them, and whose ideas would
not anticipate our descrip∣tion. But, though nothing be so easy as to
distinguish these in general from each other, yet the largest of the
duck-kind approach the goose so nearly, that it may be proper to mark the
distinctions.</P>
<P>The marks of the goose are, a bigger body, large wings, a
longer neck, a white ring about the rump, a bill thicker at the base,
slenderer towards the tip, with shorter legs, placed more forward on the
body. They both have a wadling walk; but the duck, from the position of its
legs, has it in a greater degree. By these marks, these similar tribes
may be known <PB N="109" REF="117"/> asunder; and though the duck should be
found to equal the goose in size, which sometimes happens, yet there are
still other sufficient distinctions.</P>
<P>But they all agree in many particulars; and have a nearer
affinity to each other than the neighbouring kinds in any other depart∣ment.
Their having been tamed has produced alterations in each, by which they differ
as much from the wild ones of their respective kinds as they do among
themselves. There is nearly as much difference between the wild and the tame
duck, as between some sorts of the duck and the goose; but still, the
cha∣racteristics of the kind are strongly marked and obvious; and this
tribe can never be mistaken.</P>
<P>The bill is the first great obvious distinction of the
goose-kind from all of the feathered tribe. In other birds it is round and
wedge-like, or crooked at the end. In all the goose kind it is flat and
broad, made for the purposes of skim∣ming ponds and lakes of the mantling
weeds that stand on the surface. The bills of other birds are made of an
horny substance through∣out; these have their inoffensive bills
sheathed with a skin which covers them all over. The bill of every other
bird seems in some measure formed for piercing or tearing; theirs are
only <PB N="110" REF="118"/> fitted for shoveling up their food, which is
chiefly of the vegetable kind.</P>
<P>Though these birds do not reject animal food when offered
them, yet they can contentedly subsist upon vegetables, and seldom
seek any other. They are easily provided for; wherever there is water,
there seems to be plenty. All the other web-footed tribes are continually
vo∣racious, continually preying. These lead more harmless lives: the weeds
on the surface of the water, or the insects at the bottom, the grass by
the bank, or the fruits and corn in cultivated grounds, are sufficient to
satisfy their easy ap∣petites: yet these, like every other animal, will
not reject flesh, if properly prepared for them; it is sufficient praise
to them that they do not eagerly pursue it.</P>
<P>As their food is chiefly vegetables, so their fecundity is
in proportion. We have had fre∣quent opportunities to observe, that all the
pre∣datory tribes, whether of birds or quadrupedes, are barren and unfruitful.
We have seen the lion with its two cubs; the eagle with the same number;
and the penguin with even but one. Nature that has supplied them with powers
of destruction, has denied them fertility. But it is otherwise with these
harmless animals I am describing. They seem formed to fill up the
chasms in animated nature, caused by the vo∣raciousness 
<PB N="111" REF="119"/> of others. They breed in great abundance, and lead their
young to the pool the instant they are excluded.</P>
<P>As their food is simple, so their flesh is nourishing
and wholesome. The swan was considered as a high delicacy among the
an∣cients; the goose was abstained from as totally indigestible. Modern
manners have inverted tastes; the goose is now become the favourite; and
the swan is seldom brought to table unless for the purposes of
ostentation. But at all times the flesh of the duck was in high esteem;
the ancients thought even more highly of it than we do. We are contented to eat
it as a delicacy; they also considered it as a medicine; and Plu∣tarch
assures us, that Cato kept his whole fa∣mily in health, by feeding them
with duck whenever they threatened to be out of order.</P>
<P>These qualities of great fecundity, easy sus∣tenance,
and wholesome nourishment, have been found so considerable as to induce
man to take these birds from a state of nature and render them domestic.
How long they have been thus dependants upon his pleasures is not known; for
from the earliest accounts, they were considered as familiars about him.
The time must have been very remote; for there have been many changes wrought
in <PB N="112" REF="120"/> their colours, their figures, and even their internal
parts, by human cultivation. The different kinds of these birds, in a wild
state, are simple in their colourings: when one has seen a wild goose
or a wild duck, a description of its plumage will, to a feather, exactly
corre∣spond with that of any other. But in the tame kinds no two of any
species are exactly alike. Different in their size, their colours, and
fre∣quently in their general form. They seem the mere creatures of art; and,
having been so long dependant upon man for support, they seem to
assume forms entirely suited to his pleasures or necessities.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="113" REF="121"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the Swan, tame and wild.</HEAD>
<P>NO bird makes a more indifferent figure upon land, or a more
beautiful one in the water, than the Swan. When it ascends from its
fa∣vourite element, its motions are aukward, and its neck is stretched
forward with an air of stupidity; but when it is seen smoothly sail∣ing
along the water, commanding a thousand graceful attitudes, moving at
pleasure without the smallest effort, when it 
<Q REND="inline">"proudly rows its state," as Milton has it,
"with arched neck, between its white wings mantling,"</Q> there is not a more
beautiful figure in all nature. In the exhibition of its form, there are no
broken or harsh lines; no constrained or catching mo∣tions; but the
roundest contours, and the easiest transitions; the eye wanders over
every part with insatiable pleasure, and every part takes a new grace with
new motion.</P>
<P>This fine bird has long been rendered do∣mestic; and it is
now a doubt whether there be any of the tame kind in a state of nature. The
wild swan, though so strongly resembling this in colour and form, is
yet a different bird; for it <PB N="114" REF="122"/> is very differently formed
within. The wild swan is less than the tame by almost a fourth; for as
the one weighs twenty pounds, the other only weighs sixteen pounds and three
quarters. The colour of the tame swan is all over white; that of the wild
bird is, along the back and the tips of the wings, of an ash-colour. But
these are slight differences, compared to what are found upon
dissection. In the tame swan, the wind-pipe sinks down into the lungs
in the ordinary manner; but in the wild, after a strange and wonderful
contortion, like what we have seen in the crane, it enters through a hole
formed in the breast-bone; and being reflected therein, returns by the same
aperture; and being contracted into a narrow compass by a broad and bony
cartilage, it is divided into two branches, which, before they enter the lungs,
are dilated and as it were swolen out into two cavities.</P>
<P>Such is the extraordinary difference between these two
animals, which externally seem to be of one species. Whether it is in the
power of long continued captivity and domestication to produce this strange
variety, between birds otherwise the same, I will not take upon me to
determine. But certain it is, that our tame swan is no where to be found, at
least in Europe, in a state of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="123"/>As it is not easy to account for this
difference of conformation, so it is still more difficult to reconcile the
accounts of the ancients with the experience of the moderns, concerning the
vocal powers of this bird. The tame swan is one of the most silent of all
birds; and the wild one has a note extremely loud and disagreeable. It is
probable, the convolutions of the wind-pipe may contribute to encrease the
clangor of it; for such is the harshness of its voice, that the bird from
thence has been called the Hooper. In neither is there the smallest de∣gree
of melody; nor have they, for above this century, been said to give
specimens of the smallest musical abilities: yet, notwithstanding
this, it was the general opinion of antiquity, that the swan was a most
melodious bird; and that, even to its death, its voice went on im∣proving. It
would shew no learning to produce what they have said upon the music of
the swan: it has already been collected by Aldrovandus; and still more
professedly by the Abbe Gedoyn, in the Transactions of the Academy of
Belles Lettres. From these accounts it appears that, while Plato,
Aristotle, and Diodorus Siculus, believed the vocality of the swan, Pliny
and Virgil seem to doubt that received opinion. In this equipoise of
authority, Aldrovandus seems to have deter∣mined <PB N="116" REF="124"/> in
favour of the Greek philosophers; and the form of the wind-pipe in the wild
swan, so much resembling a musical instrument, in∣clined his belief
still more strongly. In aid of this also, came the testimony of
Pendasius, who affirmed, that he had often heard swans sweetly singing
in the lake of Mantua, as he was rowed up and down in a boat; as also of
Olaus Wormius, who professed that many of his friends and scholars had
heard them singing. 
<Q REND="inline">"There was," says he, "in my family, a very
honest young man, John Rostorph, a stu∣dent in divinity, and a Norwegian
by nation. This man did, upon his credit, and with the interposition of an
oath, solemnly affirm that once, in the territory of Dronten, as he was
standing on the sea shore, early in the morn∣ing, he heard an unusual
and sweet murmur, composed of most pleasant whistlings and sounds;
he knew not at first whence they came, or how they were made, for he saw no
man near to produce them; but looking round about him, and climbing to the top
of a certain pro∣montory, he there espied an infinite number of swans
gathered together in a bay, and making the most delightful harmony: a
sweeter in all his life-time he had never heard."</Q> These were accounts
sufficient at least to keep opinion in suspense, though in
con∣tradiction <PB N="117" REF="125"/> to our own experience; but Aldro∣vandus,
to put, as he supposed, the question past all doubt, gives us the
testimony of a country∣man of our own, from whom he had the relation. This
honest man's name was Mr. George Braun, who assured him, that nothing was
more common in England, than to hear swans sing; that they were bred in
great numbers in the sea, near London; and that every fleet of ships that
returned from their voyages from distant countries, were met by swans, that
came joyfully out to welcome their return, and salute them with a loud and
chearful singing! It was in this manner that Aldrovandus, that great and good
man, was frequently imposed upon by the designing and the needy: his
unbounded cu∣riosity drew round him people of every kind, and his
generosity was as ready to reward false∣hood as truth—Poor
Aldrovandus! after having spent a vast fortune, for the purposes of
enlight∣ening mankind; after having collected more truth and more
falseshood than any man ever did before him, he little thought of being
re∣duced at last to want bread, to feel the ingra∣titude of his country, and
to die a beggar in a public hospital!</P>
<P>Thus it appears that our modern authorities, in favour of the
singing of swans, are rather <PB N="118" REF="126"/> suspicious, since
they are reduced to this Mr. George Braun, and John Rostorph, the native of a
country remarkable for ignorance and cre∣dulity. It is probable the ancients
had some mythological meaning in ascribing melody to the swan; and as for
the moderns, they scarce deserve our regard. The swan, therefore, must
be content with that share of fame which it pos∣sesses on the score
of its beauty; since the me∣lody of its voice, without better testimony,
will scarcely be admitted by even the credulous.</P>
<P>This beautiful bird is as delicate in its ap∣petites, as
elegant in its form. Its chief food is corn, bread, herbs growing in the water,
and roots and seeds, which are found near the margin. It prepares a nest in
some retired part of the bank, and chiefly where there is an islet in the
stream. This is composed of water-plants, long grass and sticks; and
the male and fe∣male assist in forming it with great assiduity. The
swan lays seven or eight eggs, white, much larger than those of a
goose, with a hard, and sometimes a tuberous shell. It sits near two
months before its young are excluded; which are ash-coloured when they
first leave the shell, and for some months after. It is not a little
dangerous to approach the old ones, when their little family are feeding round
them. Their <PB N="119" REF="127"/> fears, as well as their pride, seems to
take the alarm; and they have sometimes been known to give a blow with their
pinion, that has broke a man's leg or arm.</P>
<P>It is not till they are a twelve-month old that the young
swans change their colour with their plumage. All the stages of this bird's
approach to maturity are slow, and seem to mark its longevity. It is two
months hatching; a year in growing to its proper size; and if, according to
Pliny's observation, that those animals that are longest in the womb are
the longest lived, the swan is the longest in the shell of any bird we
know, and is said to be re∣markable for its longevity. Some say that it
lives three hundred years; and Willoughby, who is in general diffident enough,
seems to believe the report. A goose, as he justly observes, has been
known to live an hundred; and the swan, from its superior size, and from
its harder, firmer flesh, may naturally be supposed to live still
longer.</P>
<P>Swans were formerly held in such great esteem in England,
that, by an act of Edward the Fourth, none, except the son of the king, was
permitted to keep a swan, unless possessed of five marks a year. By
a subsequent act, the punishment for taking their eggs was
imprison∣ment <PB N="120" REF="128"/> for a year and a day, and a fine at the
king's will. At present they are but little valued for the delicacy of their
flesh; but many are still preserved for their beauty. We see multitudes
on the Thames and Trent; but no where greater numbers than on the salt-water
inlet of the sea near Abbotsberry, in Dorset∣shire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="121" REF="129"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Goose and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE Goose, in its domestic state, exhibits a variety of
colours. The wild goose always re∣tains the same marks: the whole upper
part is ash-coloured; the breast and belly are of a dirty white; the bill
is narrow at the base, and at the tip it is black; the legs are of a
saffron colour, and the claws black. These marks are seldom found in the
tame; whose bill is entirely red, and whose legs are entirely brown. The
wild goose is rather less than the tame; but both in∣variably retain a
white ring round their tail, which shews that they are both descended from
the same original.</P>
<P>The wild goose is supposed to breed in the northern
parts of Europe; and, in the begin∣ning of winter, to descend into more
tem∣perate regions. They are often seen flying at very great heights, in
flocks from fifty to an hundred, and seldom resting by day. Their cry is
frequently heard when they are at an im∣perceptible distance above us; and
this seems bandied from one to the other, as among hounds in the pursuit.
Whether this be the <PB N="122" REF="130"/> note of mutual encouragement, or the
necessary consequence of respiration, is doubtful; but they seldom
exert it when they alight in these journies.</P>
<P>Upon their coming to the ground by day, they range
themselves in a line, like cranes; and seem rather to have descended for
rest, than for other refreshment. When they have sat in this manner for
an hour or two, I have heard one of them, with a loud long note, sound a kind
of charge, to which the rest punctually attended, and they pursued their
journey with renewed alacrity. Their flight is very regularly arranged: they
either go in a line a-breast, or in two lines, joining in an angle in the
middle. I doubt whether the form of their flight be thus arranged to cut the
air with greater ease, as is commonly believed; I am more apt to think it is
to present a smaller mark to fowlers from below. A bullet might easily
reach them, if huddled together in a flock, and the same discharge might
destroy several at once; but, by their manner of flying, no shot from
below can affect above one of them; and from the height at which they fly, this
is not easy to be hit.</P>
<P>The Barnacle differs in some respects from both these;
being less than either, with a <PB N="123" REF="131"/> black bill, much
shorter than either of the preceding. It is scarce necessary to com∣bat
the idle error of this bird's being bred from a shell sticking to ship's
bottoms; it is well known to be hatched from an egg, in the ordinary manner,
and to differ in very few par∣ticulars from all the rest of its kind.</P>
<P>The Brent Goose is still less than the former, and not
bigger than a Muscovy duck, except that the body is longer. The head, neck,
and upper part of the breast, are black; but about the middle of the neck, on
each side, are two small spots or lines of white, which together appear
like a ring.</P>
<P>These, and many other varieties, are found in this kind;
which agree in one common cha∣racter of feeding upon vegetables, and being
remarkable for their fecundity. Of these, how∣ever, the tame goose is the
most fruitful. Hav∣ing less to fear from its enemies, leading a securer
and a more plentiful life, its prolific powers encrease in proportion to its
ease; and though the wild goose seldom lays above eight eggs, the tame
goose is often seen to lay above twenty. The female hatches her eggs with
great assiduity; while the Gander visits her twice or thrice a day, and
sometimes drives her off to take her place, where he sits with great
state and composure.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="132"/>But beyond that of all animals is his
pride when the young are excluded: he seems then to consider himself as a
champion not only obliged to defend his young, but also to keep off the
suspicion of danger; he pursues dogs and men that never attempt to
molest him; and, though the most harmless thing alive, is then the most
petulant and provoking. When, in this manner, he has pursued the calf or the
mastiff, to whose contempt alone he is indebted for safety, he returns to
his female and her brood in triumph, clapping his wings, screaming, and
shewing all the marks of conscious supe∣riority. It is probable, however,
these arts suc∣ceed in raising his importance among the tribe where they
are displayed; and it is probable there is not a more respectable animal on
earth to a goose than a gander!</P>
<P>A young goose is generally reckoned very good eating; yet
the feathers of this bird still farther encrease its value. I feel my
obligations to this animal every word I write; for, however deficient a man's
head may be, his pen is nim∣ble enough upon every occasion: it is happy
indeed for us, that it requires no great effort to put it in motion. But the
feathers of this bird are still as valuable in another capacity, as they make
the softest and the warmest beds to sleep on.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="133"/>Of goose-feathers most of our beds
in Europe are composed; in the countries bordering on the Levant, and in all
Asia, the use of them is utterly unknown. They there use matrasses,
stuffed with wool, or camel's hair or cotton; and the warmth of their climate
may perhaps make them dispense with cushions of a softer kind. But how
it happens that the ancients had not the use of feather-beds, is to me
sur∣prizing: Pliny tell us, indeed, that they made bolsters of feathers to
lay their heads on; and this serves as a proof that they turned feathers to
no other uses.</P>
<P>As feathers are a very valuable commodity, great numbers of
geese are kept tame in the fens in Lincolnshire, which are plucked once or
twice a year. These make a considerable article of commerce. The feathers
of Somer∣setshire are most in esteem; those of Ireland are reckoned
the worst. Hudson's Bay also furnishes very fine feathers, supposed
to be of the goose kind. The down of the swan is brought from Dantzic. The
same place also sends us great quantities of the feathers of the cock and
hen; but Greenland, Iceland, and Norway, furnish the best feathers of all:
and in this number we may reckon the Eider down, of which we shall take
notice in its place. The <PB N="126" REF="134"/> best method of curing
feathers, is to lay them in a room in an open exposure to the sun, and,
when dried, to put them into bags, and beat them well with poles to get the
dust off. But, after all, nothing will prevent, for a time, the heavy smell
which arises from the putrefaction of the oil contained in every feather; no
exposure will draw this off, how long soever it be con∣tinued; they must
be lain upon, which is the only remedy: and, for this reason, old feathers
are much more valuable than new.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of the Duck and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE Tame Duck is the most easily reared of all our
domestic animals. The very instincts of the young ones direct them to their
favourite element; and though they are conducted by a hen, yet they despise
the admonitions of their leader.</P>
<P>This serves as an incontestible proof that all birds have
their manners rather from nature than education. A falcon pursues the
partridge, not because it is taught by the old one, but because its
appetites make their importunate call for animal food; the cuckoo follows a
very different trade from that which its nurse en∣deavoured to teach it; and,
if we may credit Pliny, in time destroys its instructor: animals of the
duck kind also follow their appetites, not their tutor, and come to all their
various perfections without any guide. All the arts possessed by man,
are the result of accumulated experience; all the arts of inferior animals
are self-taught, and scarce one acquired by imitation.</P>
<P>It is usual with the good women to lay duck-eggs under a
hen, because she hatches them <PB N="128" REF="136"/> better than the
original parent would have done. The duck seems to be an heedless,
inattentive mother; she frequently leaves her eggs till they spoil, and
even seems to forget that she is entrusted with the charge: she is
equally regardless of them when excluded; she leads them to the pond, and
thinks she has sufficiently provided for her offspring when she has
shewn them the water. Whatever advantages may be procured by coming near the
house, or attending in the yard, she declines them all; and often lets the
vermin, who haunt the waters, destroy them, rather than bring them to take
shelter nearer home. The hen is a nurse of a very opposite character;
she broods with the utmost assiduity, and generally brings forth a
young one from every egg com∣mitted to her charge; she does not lead her
younglings to the water indeed, but she watch∣fully guards them when there by
standing at the brink. Should the rat, or the weazle, at∣tempt to seize
them, the hen can give them protection; she leads them to the house when
tired with padling, and rears up the supposi∣tious brood, without ever
suspecting that they belong to another.</P>
<P>The wild duck differs, in many respects, from the tame; and
in them there is still greater <PB N="129" REF="137"/> variety than among the
domestic kinds. Of the tame duck there are not less than ten different
sorts; and of the wild, Brisson reckons above twenty. The most obvious
distinction between wild and tame ducks is in the colour of their feet;
those of the tame duck being black; those of the wild duck yellow. The
difference be∣tween wild ducks among each other, arises as well from their
size as the nature of the place they feed in. Sea-ducks, which feed in the
salt∣water, and dive much, have a broad bill, bend∣ing upwards, a large hind
toe, and a long blunt tail. Pond-ducks, which feed in plashes, have a
straight and narrow bill, a small hind toe, and a sharp pointed train.
The former are called, by our decoy-men, foreign ducks; the latter are
supposed to be natives of England. It would be tedious to enter into the
minute varieties of such a number of birds; all agreeing in the same
general figure, the same habits and mode of living, and differing in little
more than their size and the colours of their plumage. In this tribe, we may
rank, as natives of our own European dominions, the Eider Duck, which is double
the size of a common duck, with a black bill; the Velvet Duck, not so
large, and with a yellow bill; the Scoter, with a knob at the base of a
yellow bill; the Tufted Duck, <PB N="130" REF="138"/> adorned with a thick
crest; the Scaup Duck, less than the common duck, with the bill of a
greyish blue colour; the Golden Eye, with a large white spot at the corners
of the mouth, resembling an eye; the Sheldrake, with the bill of a bright
red, and swelling into a knob; the Mallard, which is the stock from whence
our tame breed has probably been produced; the Pintail, with the two middle
feathers of the tail three inches longer than the rest; the Pochard, with the
head and neck of a bright bay; the Widgeon, with a lead-coloured bill, and the
plumage of the back marked with narrow black and white undulated lines, but
best known by its whistling sound: lastly, the Teal, which is the
smallest of this kind, with the bill black, the head and upper part of the
neck of a bright bay. These are the most common birds of the duck kind
among ourselves; but who can de∣scribe the amazing variety of this tribe,
if he extends his view to the different quarters of the world? The most noted
of the foreign tribe are, the Muscovy duck, or, more properly speaking, the
Musk Duck, so called from a supposed musky smell, with naked skin
round the eyes, and which is a native of Africa. The Brasilian Duck, that is
of the size of a goose, all over black except the tips of the wings. The
American Wood Duck, with a variety of <PB N="131" REF="139"/> beautiful colours,
and a plume of feathers that falls from the back of the head like a friar's
cowl. These, and twenty others, might be added, were encreasing the number
of names the way to enlarge the sphere of our compre∣hension.</P>
<P>All these live in the manner of our domestic ducks,
keeping together in flocks in the winter, and flying in pairs in summer,
bringing up their young by the water-side, and leading them to their food as
soon as out of the shell. Their nests are usually built among heath or
rushes, not far from the water; and they lay twelve, fourteen, or more eggs
before they sit: yet this is not always their method; the dangers they
con¦tinually encounter from their ground situation, sometimes obliges them
to change their manner of building; and their aukward nests are often seen
exalted on the tops of trees. This must be a very great labour to perform, as
the duck's bill is but ill-formed for building a nest, and giving the
materials of which it is composed a sufficient stability to stand the
weather. The nest, whether high or low, is generally com∣posed of
singular materials. The longest grass, mixed with heath, and lined within
with the bird's own feathers, usually go to the compo∣sition: however, in
proportion as the climate <PB N="132" REF="140"/> is colder, the nest is more
artificially made, and more warmly lined. In the Artic regions, nothing can
exceed the great care all of this kind take to protect their eggs from the
in∣tenseness of the weather. While the gull and the penguin kind seem to
disregard the severest cold, the duck, in those regions, forms itself
a hole to lay in, shelters the approach, lines it with a layer of long
grass and clay, within that another of moss, and lastly, a warm coat of
fea∣thers or down. The eider duck is particularly remarkable for the warmth of
its nest. This bird, which, as was said, is above twice as large as the
common duck, and resides in the colder climates, lays from six to eight
eggs, making her nest among the rocks or the plants along the sea-shore.
The external materials of the nest are such as are in common with the
rest of the kind; but the inside lining, on which the eggs are immediately
deposited, is at once the softest, warmest, and the lightest
substance with which we are acquainted. This is no other than the inside
down which covers the breast of the bird in the breeding-season. This the
fe∣male plucks off with her bill, and furnishes the inside of her nest
with a tapestry more valuable than the most skilful artists can
produce. The natives watch the place where she begins to 
<PB N="133" REF="141"/> build, and, suffering her to lay, take away both the
eggs and the nest. The duck, how∣ever, not discouraged by the first
disappoint∣ment, builds and lays in the same place a second time; and
this they in the same manner take away: the third time she builds, but the
drake must supply the down from his breast to line the nest with: and,
if this be robbed, they both forsake the place, and breed there no more. This
down the natives take care to se∣parate from the dirt and moss with which
it is mixed; and, though no people stand in more need of a warm covering than
themselves, yet their necessities compel them to sell it to the more
indolent and luxurious inhabitants of the south for brandy and tobacco.</P>
<P>As they possess the faculties of flying and swimming,
so they are in general birds of passage, and it is most probable
perform their journies across the ocean as well on the water as in the air.
Those that migrate to this country, on the approach of winter, are seldom
found so well tasted or so fat as the fowls that continue with us the
year round: their flesh is often lean, and still oftner fishy; which
flavour it has probably contracted in the journey, as their food in the lakes
of Lapland, from whence they de∣scend, is generally of the insect kind.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="142"/>As soon as they arrive among us, they
are generally seen flying in flocks to make a survey of those lakes where
they intend to take up their residence for the winter. In the choice of
these they have two objects in view; to be near their food, and yet remote
from inter∣ruption. Their chief aim is to chuse some lake in the
neighbourhood of a marsh where there is at the same time a cover of woods
and where insects are found in greatest abundance. Lakes, therefore, with a
marsh on one side and a wood on the other, are seldom without vast
quantities of wild fowl; and where a couple are seen at any time, that is a
sufficient inducement to bring hundreds of others. The ducks flying in the
air are often lured down from their heights by the loud voice of the mallard
from below. Nature seems to have furnished this bird with very particular
faculties for calling. The wind pipe, where it begins to enter the lungs, opens
into a kind of bony cavity, where the sound is reflected as in a musical
instrument, and is heard a great way off. To this call all the stragglers
resort; and in a week or a fort∣night's time, a lake that before was quite
naked is black with water-fowl, that have left their Lapland retreats to keep
company with our ducks who never stirred from home.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="143"/>They generally chuse that part of the
lake where they are inaccessible to the approach of the fowler, in which
they all appear huddled together, extremely busy and very loud. What it is
can employ them all the day is not easy to guess. There is no food for them
at the place where they sit and cabal thus, as they chuse the middle of the
lake; and as for courtship, the season for that is not yet come; so
that it is wonderful what can so busily keep them occupied. Not one of them
seems a moment at rest. Now pursuing one another, now screaming, then
all up at once, then down again; the whole seems one strange scene of
bustle with nothing to do.</P>
<P>They frequently go off in a more private manner by night to
feed in the adjacent meadows and ditches, which they dare not venture to
ap∣proach by day. In these nocturnal adventures they are often taken; for,
though a timorous bird, yet they are easily deceived, and every springe
seems to succeed in taking them. But the greatest quantities are taken in
decoys; which, though well known near London, are yet untried in the remoter
parts of the country. The manner of making and managing a decoy is as
follows.</P>
<P>A place is to be chosen for this purpose far remote from
the common highway and all noise <PB N="136" REF="144"/> of people. A decoy is
best where there is a large pond surrounded by a wood, and beyond that a
marshy and uncultivated country. When the place is chosen, the pool, if
possible, is to be planted round with willows, unless a wood answers
the purpose of shading it on every side. On the south and north side
of this pool are two, three, or four ditches or channels, made broad towards
the pool, and growing narrower till they end in a point. These channels are
to be covered over with nets, supported by hooped sticks bending from one
side to the other; so that they form a vault or arch growing narrower and
narrower to the point, where it is termi∣nated by a tunnel-net, like that in
which fish are caught in weirs Along the banks of these channels so
netted over, which are called pipes, many hedges are made of reeds slanting
to the edge of the channel, the acute angles to the side next the pool. The
whole apparatus also is to be hidden from the pool by a hedge of reeds along
the margin, behind which the fowler manages his operations. The place being
fitted in this manner, the fowler is to provide himself with a number of wild
ducks made tame, which are called decoys. These are always to be fed at the
mouth or entrance of the pipe, and to be accustomed to come at a
whistle.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="145"/>As soon as the evening is set in,
<HI>the decoy rises,</HI> as they term it, and the wild fowl feed during the
night. If the evening be still, the noise of their wings, during their
flight, is heard at a very great distance, and produces no unpleasing
sensation. The fowler, when he finds a fit opportunity, and sees his
decoy co∣vered with fowl, walks about the pool, and ob∣serves into what pipe
the birds gathered in the pool may be enticed or driven. Then casting
hemp-seed, or some such seed as will float on the suface of the
water, at the entrance and up along the pipe, he whistles to his decoy-ducks,
who instantly obey the summons, and come to the entrance of the pipe, in
hopes of being fed as usual. Thither also they are followed by a whole
flock of wild ones, who little suspect the danger preparing against them.
Their sense of smelling however is very exquisite; and they would
soon discover their enemy, but that the fowler always keeps a piece of turf
burning at his nose, against which he breathes; and this prevents the
effluvia of his person from reaching their exquisite senses. The wild
ducks, there∣fore, pursuing the decoy-ducks, are led into the broad mouth of
the channel or pipe, nor have the least suspicion of the man who keeps
hidden behind one of the hedges. When they <PB N="138" REF="146"/> have got up
the pipe however, finding it grow more and more narrow, they begin to
suspect danger, and would return back; but they are now prevented by the
man, who shews himself at the broad end below. Thither, therefore, they
dare not return; and rise they may not, as they are kept by the net above
from ascend∣ing. The only way left them, therefore, is the narrow funnelled
net at the bottom; into this they fly, and there they are taken.</P>
<P>It often happens, however, that the wild∣fowl are in such a
state of sleepiness or dozing, that they will not follow the decoy ducks.
Use is then generally made of a dog who is taught his lesson. He
passes backward and forward between the reed-hedges, in which there are
little holes, both for the decoy-man to see and for the little dog to pass
through. This attracts the eye of the wild fowl; who, prompted by curiosity,
advance towards this little animal, while he all the time keeps playing among
the reeds, nearer and nearer the funnel, till they follow him too far to
recede. Sometimes the dog will not attract their attention till a red
handkerchief, or something very singular, be put about him. The decoy-ducks
never enter the funnel-net with the rest, being taught to dive under water as
soon as the rest are driven in.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="147"/>The general season for catching fowl
in de∣coys is from the latter end of October till Fe∣bruary. The taking them
earlier is prohibited by an act of George the Second, which imposes a penalty
of five shillings for every bird de∣stroyed at any other season.</P>
<P>The Lincolnshire decoys are commonly let at a certain annual
rent, from five pounds to twenty pounds a year; and some even amount to
thirty. These principally contribute to sup∣ply the markets of London with
wild-fowl. The number of ducks, wigeon, and teal, that are sent thither is
amazing. Above thirty thou∣sand have been sent up in one season from
ten de∣coys in the neighbourhood of Wainfleet. This quantity makes them so
cheap on the spot, that it is asserted, the several decoy-men would be
glad to contract for years to deliver their ducks at the next town for
ten-pence the couple.</P>
<P>To this manner of taking wild-fowl in Eng∣land, I will
subjoin another still more extraor∣dinary, frequently practised in China.
When∣ever the fowler sees a number of ducks settled in any particular
plash of water, he sends off two or three gourds to float among them.
These gourds resemble our pompions; but, being made hollow, they swim on
the surface <PB N="140" REF="148"/> of the water; and on one pool there may
some∣times be seen twenty or thirty of these gourds floating together.
The fowl at first are a little shy of coming near them; but by degrees they
come nearer; and as all birds at last grow fa∣miliar with a scare-crow, the
ducks gather about these, and amuse themselves by whetting their bills
against them. When the birds are as fa∣miliar with the gourds as the fowler
could wish, he then prepares to deceive them in good ear∣nest. He hollows
out one of these gourds large enough to put his head in; and, making holes to
breathe and see through, he claps it on his head. Thus accoutred, he wades
slowly into the water, keeping his body under, and no∣thing but his head in
the gourd above the sur∣face; and in that manner moves imperceptibly towards
the fowls, who suspect no danger. At last, however, he fairly gets in
among them; while they, having been long used to see gourds, take not the
least fright while the enemy is in the very midst of them; and an
insiduous enemy he is; for ever as he approaches a fowl, he seizes it by
the legs, and draws it in a jerk under water. There he fastens it under his
girdle, and goes to the next, till he has thus loaded himself with as many as
he can carry away. When he <PB N="141" REF="149"/> has got his quantity, without
ever attempting to disturb the rest of the fowls on the pool, he slowly
moves off-again; and in this manner pays the flock three or four visits in a
day. Of all the various artifices for catching fowl, this seems likely to be
attended with the greatest success, as it is the most practised in
China.</P>

<PB N="142" REF="150"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of the King-Fisher.</HEAD>
<P>I Will conclude this history of birds with one that seems
to unite in itself somewhat of every class preceding. It seems at once
possessed of appetites for prey like the rapacious kinds, with an
attachment to water like the birds of that element. It exhibits in its form the
beautiful plumage of the peacock, the shadings of the humming-bird, the bill
of the crane, and the short legs of the swallow. The bird I mean is the
King-Fisher, of which many extraordinary falsehoods have been propagated;
and yet of which many extraordinary things remain to be said that are
actually true.</P>
<P>The king-fisher is not much larger than a swallow; its
shape is clumsy; the legs dispro∣portionably small, and the bill
disproportionably long; it is two inches from the base to the tip; the
upper chap black and the lower yellow; but the colours of this bird attone for
its inele∣gant form; the crown of the head and the co∣verts of the wings are of
a deep blackish green, spotted with bright azure; the back and tail are of
the most resplendent azure; the whole under-side of the body is
orange-coloured; a <PB N="143" REF="151"/> broad mark of the same passes
from the bill be∣yond the eyes; beyond that is a large white spot: the tail
is short, and consists of twelve feathers of a rich deep blue; the feet
are of a reddish yellow, and the three joints of the out∣most toe adhere to
the middle toe, while the inner toe adheres only by one.</P>
<P>From the diminutive size, the slender short legs, and
the beautiful colours of this bird, no person would be led to suppose it
one of the most rapacious little animals that skims the deep. Yet it is for
ever on the wing, and feeds on fish, which it takes in surprizing
quantities, when we consider its size and figure. It chiefly frequents the
banks of rivers, and takes its prey after the manner of the osprey, balancing
itself at a certain distance above the water for a considerable space,
then darting into the deep, and seizing the fish with inevitable
cer∣tainty. While it remains suspended in the air, in a bright day, the
plumage exhibits a beautiful variety of the most dazzling and brilliant
colours. It might have been this ex∣traordinary beauty that has given rise to
fable; for wherever there is any thing uncommon, fancy is always willing to
encrease the wonder.</P>
<P>Of this bird it has been said that she built her nest on
the water, and thus in a few days hatched and produced her young. But, to be 
<PB N="144" REF="152"/> uninterrupted in this task, she was said to be
possessed of a charm to allay the fury of the waves; and during this
period the mariner might sail with the greatest security. The an∣cient
poets are full of these fables; their histo∣rians are not exempt from them.
Cicero has written a long poem in praise of the halcyon, of which there
remains but two lines. Even the emperor Gordian has written a poem on this
subject, of which we have nothing remaining. These fables have been adopted
each by one of the earliest fathers of the church. 
<Q REND="inline">"Behold," says St. Ambrose, "the little
bird which in the midst of the winter lays her eggs on the sand by the
shore. From that moment the winds are hushed; the sea becomes smooth;
and the calm continues for fourteen days. This is the time she requires;
seven days to hatch, and seven days to foster her young. Their Creator
has taught these little animals to make their nest in the midst of the
most stormy season, only to manifest his kindness by granting them
a lasting calm. The sea∣men are not ignorant of this blessing; they
call this interval of fair weather their <HI>halcyon days</HI>; and they are
particularly careful to seize the opportunity, as then they need fear no
interruption."</Q> This, and an hundred other <PB N="145" REF="153"/>
instances might be given of the credulity of mankind with respect to this
bird; they entered into speculations concerning the manner of her calming the
deep, the formation of her nest, and her peculiar sagacity; at present we
do not speculate because we know, with respect to our king-fisher, that
most of the facts are false. It may be alledged, indeed, with some shew
of reason, that the Halcyon of the ancients was a different bird from our
king-fisher; it may be urged, that many birds, especially on the Indian
ocean, build a floating nest upon the sea; but still, the history of
the ancient halcyon is clogged with endless fable; and it is but an
indifferent method to vindicate falsehood by shewing that a part of the
story is true.</P>
<P>The king-fisher with which we are acquainted at present,
has none of those powers of allaying the storm, or building upon the waves;
it is contented to make its nest on the banks of rivers, in such
situations as not to be affected by the rising of the stream. When it has
found a place for its purpose, it hollows out with its bill a hole about a
yard deep; or if it finds the deserted hole of a rat, or one caused by the
root of a tree decaying, it takes quiet possession. This hole it
enlarges at the bottom to a good size; and, lining it with the down of the
willow, <PB N="146" REF="154"/> lays its eggs there without any farther
prepa∣ration.</P>
<P>Its nest, or rather hole, is very different from that
described by the ancients, by whom it is said to be made in the shape of
a long necked gourd of the bones of the sea-needle. The bones, indeed, are
found there in great quan∣tities as well as the scales of fishes; but
these are the remains of the bird's food, and by no means brought there for
the purposes of warmth or convenience. The king-fisher, as Bellonius
says, feeds upon fish, but is incapable of digesting the bones and
scales, which he throws up again as eagles and owls are seen to do a part
of their prey. These fill the bird's nest of course; and, although they
seem as if designedly placed there, are only a kind of nuisance.</P>
<P>In these holes, which, from the remains of fish brought
there, are very foetid, the king-fisher is often found with from five eggs to
nine. There the female continues to hatch even though disturbed; and though
the nest be robbed, she will again return and lay there. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have had one of those females brought
me," says Reaumur, "which was taken from her nest about three leagues from
my house. After admiring the beauty of her colours, I let her 
<PB N="147" REF="155"/> fly again, when the fond creature was in∣stantly
seen to return back to the nest where she had just before been made a
captive. There joining the male, she again began to lay, though it was for
the third time, and though the season was very far advanced. At each time
she had seven eggs. The older the nest is, the greater quantity of
fish-bones and scales does it contain: these are disposed without any
order; and sometimes take up a good deal of room."</Q></P>
<P>The female begins to lay early in the season; and excludes
her first brood about the beginning of April. The male, whose fidelity
exceeds even that of the turtle, brings her large pro∣visions of fish while
she is thus employed; and she, contrary to most other birds, is found
plump and fat at that season. The male, that used to twitter before this,
now enters the nest as quietly and as privately as possible. The young
ones are hatched at the expiration of twenty days; but are seen to differ as
well in their size as in their beauty.</P>
<P>As the ancients have had their fables con∣cerning this bird,
so have the modern vulgar. It is an opinion generally received among them
that the flesh of the king-fisher will not cor∣rupt, and that it will even
banish all vermin. <PB N="148" REF="156"/> This has no better foundation than
that which is said of its always pointing, when hung up dead, with its
breast to the north. The only truth which can be affirmed of this bird when
killed is, that its flesh is utterly unfit to be eaten; while its beautiful
plumage preserves its lustre longer than that of any other bird we
know.</P>
<P>Having thus given a short history of birds, I own I cannot
take leave of this most beautiful part of the creation without reluctance.
These splendid inhabitants of air possess all those qua∣lities that
can sooth the heart and cheer the fancy. The brightest colours, the
roundest forms, the most active manners, and the sweetest music. In
sending the imagination in pursuit of these, in following them to the
chirruping grove, the screaming precipice, or the glassy deep, the mind
naturally lost the sense of its own situation, and, attentive to their
little sports, almost forgot the TASK of describing them. Innocently to
amuse the imagination in this dream of life is wisdom; and nothing is
useless that, by furnishing mental employment, keeps us for a while in
oblivion of those stronger appetites that lead to evil. But every rank and
state of mankind may find something to imitate in those delightful
songsters, and we <PB N="149" REF="157"/> may not only employ the time, but
mend our lives by the contemplation. From their cou∣rage in defence of their
young, and their assi∣duity in incubation, the coward may learn to be
brave, and the rash to be patient. The in∣violable attachment of some to
their compa∣nions may give lessons of fidelity; and the con∣nubial
tenderness of others, be a monitor to the incontinent. Even those that are
tyrants by nature never spread capricious destruction; and, unlike man,
never inflict a pain but when urged by necessity.</P>

<PB REF="159"/>
<HEAD>AN HISTORY OF FISHES.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Fishes in General.</HEAD>
<P>THE ocean is the great receptacle of fishes. It has been
thought, by some, that all fish are naturally of that salt element; and
that they have mounted up into fresh water, by some accidental migration. A
few still swim up rivers to deposit their spawn; but of the great body
of fishes, of which the size is enormous and the shoals are endless,
those all keep to the sea, and would quickly expire in fresh water. In
that extensive and undiscovered abode, mil∣lions reside, whose manners
are a secret to us, and whose very form is unknown. The curi∣osity of
mankind, indeed, has drawn some from <PB N="154" REF="160"/> their depths, and
his wants many more: with the figure of these at least he is acquainted;
but for their pursuits, migrations, societies, anti∣pathies, pleasures,
times of gestation, and manner of bringing forth, these all are hidden in
the turbulent element that protects them.</P>
<P>The number of fish to which we have given names, and of the
figure, at least, of which we know something, according to Linnaeus, are
above four hundred. Thus to appearance in∣deed the history of fish is
tolerably copious; but when we come to examine, it will be found that of the
greatest part of these we know very little. Those qualities,
singularities or advantages, that render animals worth nam∣ing, still
remain to be discovered. The history of fishes, therefore, has little in
it entertaining: for our philosophers hitherto, instead of stu∣dying
their nature, have been employed in encreasing their catalogues; and the
reader, instead of observations or facts, is presented with a long list
of names, that disgust him with their barren superfluity. It must
displease him to see the language of a science encreasing, while the
science itself has nothing to repay the encreasing tax laid upon his
memory.</P>
<P>Most fish offer us the same external form; sharp at
either end, and swelling in the middle; <PB N="155" REF="161"/> by which they
are enabled to traverse the fluid which they inhabit, with greater celerity
and ease. That peculiar shape which Nature has granted to most fishes,
we endeavour to imitate in such vessels as are designed to sail with
the greatest swiftness: however, the progress of a machine moved
forward in the water by hu∣man contrivance, is nothing to the rapidity of an
animal destined by Nature to reside there. Any of the large fish overtake
a ship in full sail with great ease, play round it without effort, and
outstrip it at pleasure. Every part of the body seems exerted in this
dispatch; the fins, the tail, and the motion of the whole back-bone,
assist progression; and it is to that flexibility of body at which
art cannot arrive, that fishes owe their great velocity.</P>
<P>The chief instruments in a fish's motion, are the fins;
which, in some fish, are much more numerous than in others. A fish
completely fitted for sailing, is furnished with not less than two pair;
also three single fins, two above and one below. Thus equipped, it migrates
with the utmost rapidity, and takes voyages of a thousand leagues in a
season. But it does not always happen that such fish as have the
greatest number of fins have the swiftest motion: the shark is thought
to be one of the swiftest swim∣mers, <PB N="156" REF="162"/> yet it wants
the ventral or belly fins; the haddock does not move so swift, yet it is
com∣pletely fitted for motion.</P>
<P>But the fins serve not only to assist the ani∣mal in
progression, but in rising or sinking, in turning, or even leaping out
of the water. To answer these purposes, the pectoral fins serve, like
oars, to push the animal forward; they are placed at some little distance
behind the opening of the gills; they are generally large and strong, and
answer the same purposes to the fish in the water, as wings do to a
bird in the air. With the help of these, and by their continued motion, the
flying-fish is sometimes seen to rise out of the water, and to fly
above an hundred yards; till, fatigued with its exertions, it is obliged to
sink down again. These also serve to balance the fish's head, when it
is too large for the body, and keep it from tumbling prone to the bottom, as is
seen in large headed fishes, when the pec∣toral fins are cut off. Next
these are seen the ventral fins, placed toward the lower part of the body,
under the belly: these are always seen to lie flat on the water, in
whatever situa∣tion the fish may be; and they serve rather to raise or
depress the fish in its element, than to assist progressive
motion. The dorsal fin is situ∣ated along the ridge of the back; and
serves <PB N="157" REF="163"/> to keep it in equilibrio, as also to
assist its progressive motion. In many fishes this is wanting; but
in all flat fishes it is very large, as the pectoral fins are proportionably
small. The anal fin occupies that part of the fish which lies between the
anus and the tail; and this serves to keep the fish in its upright or
vertical situation. Lastly, the tail, which in some fishes is flat, and
upright in others, seems the grand instrument of motion: the fins are but
all sub∣servient to it, and give direction to its great impetus, by which
the fish seems to dart for∣ward with so much velocity. To explain all
this by experiment; a carp is taken, and put into a large vessel. The
fish, in a state of re∣pose, spreads all its fins, and seems to
rest upon its pectoral and ventral fins near the bottom: if the fish folds
up, for it has the power of folding, either of its pectoral fins, it in∣clines
to the same side; folding the right pec∣toral fin, the fish inclines to
the right side; folding the left fin, it inclines to that side in turn.
When the fish desires to have a retrogade motion, striking with the
pectoral fins, in a contrary direction, effectually produces it. If the fish
desires to turn, a blow from the tail sends it about; but if the tail
strikes both ways, then the motion is progressive. In pursuance 
<PB N="158" REF="164"/> of these observations, if the dorsal and ventral
fins be cut off, the fish reels to the right and left, and endeavours to
supply its loss by keeping the rest of its fins in constant
employ∣ment. If the right pectoral fin be cut off, the fish leans to that
side; if the ventral fin on the same side be cut away, then it loses
its equili∣brium entirely. When the tail is cut off, the fish loses all
motion, and gives itself up to where the water impels it.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that each of these instruments has
a peculiar use assigned it; but, at the same time, that they all
conspire to assist each other's motions. Some fish are
possessed of all, whose motions are yet not the swiftest; others
have but a part, and yet dart in the wa∣ter with great rapidity. The number,
the size, and the situation of the fins, therefore, seem rather
calculated to correspond with the animal's figure, than solely to answer
the purposes of pro∣moting its speed. Where the head is large and heavy,
there the pectoral fins are large, and placed forward, to keep it from
oversetting. Where the head is small, or produced out into a long beak, and
therefore not too heavy for the tail, the pectoral fins are small, and the
ventral fins totally wanting.</P>
<P>As most animals that live upon land are fur∣nished 
<PB N="159" REF="165"/> with a covering to keep off the injuries of the weather,
so all that live in the water are covered with a slimy, glutinous matter,
that, like a sheath, defends their bodies from the immediate contact of the
surrounding fluid. This substance may be considered as a secretion
from the pores of the animal's body; and serving, not only to defend, but to
assist the fish's easy progress through the water. Beneath this, in
many kinds, is found a strong covering of scales, that, like a coat of
mail, defend it still more powerfully; and under that, before we come to the
muscular parts of the body, an oily substance, which supplies the
requisite warmth and vigour.</P>
<P>The fish, thus protected and fitted for mo∣tion in its
natural element, seems as well fur∣nished with the means of happiness as
quadru∣pedes or birds; but if we come to examine its faculties more nearly, we
shall find it very much their inferior. The sense of touching, which
beasts and birds have in a small degree, the fish, covered up in its own
coat of mail, can have but little acquaintance with.</P>
<P>The sense of smelling, which in beasts is so
exquisite, and among birds is not wholly un∣known, seems given to fishes
in a very mo∣derate proportion. It is true, that all fishes 
<PB N="160" REF="166"/> have one or more nostrils; and even those that have
not the holes perceptible without, yet have the proper formation of the bones
for smelling within. But as air is the only medium we know for the
distribution of odours, it cannot be supposed that these animals,
residing in water, can be possessed of any power of being affected by
them. If they have any perception of smells, it must be in the same
manner as we distinguish by our taste; and, it is probable, the olfactory
membrane in fish serves them in∣stead of a distinguishing palate: by
this they judge of substances, that, first tincturing the water with
their vapours, are thus sent to the nostrils of the fish, and no doubt
produce some kind of sensation. This most probably must be the use
of that organ in those animals; as otherwise there would be the
instruments of a sense provided for them, without any power in them of
enjoyment.</P>
<P>As to tasting they seem to make very little
di∣stinction; the palate of most fish is hard and bony, and
consequently incapable of the powers of relishing different substances.
This sense among quadrupedes, who possess it in some de∣gree,
arises from the soft pliancy of the organ, and the delicacy of the skin
which covers the instruments of tasting; it may be considered, in 
<PB N="161" REF="167"/> them, as a more perfect and delicate kind of feeling: in
the bony palate of fish, therefore, all powers of distinguishing are
utterly taken away; and we have accordingly often seen these voracious
animals swallow the fisherman's plum∣met instead of the bait.</P>
<P>Hearing in fishes is found still more imperfect, if it be
found at all. Certain it is, that anato∣mists have not been able to
discover, except in the whale kind, the smallest traces of an organ,
either within or without the head of fishes. It is true that in the centre of
the brain of some fishes are found now and then some little bones, the
number and situation of which are entirely accidental. These bones, Mr.
Klein has supposed to constitute the organ of hearing; but if we
consider their entire dissimilitude to the bones that serve for hearing
in other animals, we shall be of another opinion. The greatest number of
fishes are deprived of these bones entirely: some fish have them in
small numbers, and others in abundance; yet neither testify any excellence
or defect in hearing. Indeed, of what advantage would this sense be to
ani∣mals that are incapable of making themselves heard? They have no voice to
communicate with each other, and consequently have no need of an organ for
hearing. Mr. Gouan, <PB N="162" REF="168"/> who kept some gold fishes in a
vase, informs us, that, whatever noise he made, he could neither disturb
nor terrify them: he hallowed as loud as he could, putting a piece of paper
be∣tween his mouth and the water, to prevent the vibrations from affecting the
surface, and the fishes still seemed insensible: but when the paper
was removed, and the sound had its full play upon the water, the fishes
seemed instantly to feel the change, and shrunk to the bottom. From this
we may learn, that fishes are as deaf as they are mute; and that when they
seem to hear the call of a whistle or a bell at the edge of a pond, it is
rather the vibrations of the sound that affect the water, by which they are
excited, than any sounds that they hear.</P>
<P>Seeing seems to be the sense fishes are
pos∣sessed of in the greatest degree; and yet even this seems
obscure, if we compare it to that of other animals. The eye, in almost all
fish, is covered with the same transparent skin that covers the rest
of the head; and which pro∣bably serves to defend it in the water, as they
are without eye-lids. The globe is more de∣pressed anteriorly, and is
furnished behind with a muscle, which serves to lengthen or flatten it,
according to the necessities of the animal. The chrystaline humour, which
in quadrupedes is <PB N="163" REF="169"/> flat and of the shape of a button
mould, in fishes is as round as a pea; or sometimes oblong, like an egg.
From all this it appears, that fish are extremely near-sighted; and that,
even in the water, they can see objects at a very small distance. This
distance might very easily be ascertained, by comparing the refraction of
bodies in the water, with that formed by a lens that is spherical. Those
unskilled in mathe∣matical calculations, will have a general idea of this,
from the glasses used by near-sighted people. Those whose
chrystaline humour is too convex, or, in other words, too round, are always
very near-sighted; and obliged to use concave glasses, to correct the
imperfections of Nature. The chrystaline humour of fish is so round that
it is not in the power of any glasses, much less of water, to correct
their vision. This chrystaline humour in fishes all must have seen;
being that little hard pea-like substance which is found in their eyes
after boiling. In the natural state it is transparent, and not much harder
than a jelly.</P>
<P>From all this, it appears how far fish fall behind
terrestrial animals in their sensations, and consequently in their
enjoyments. Even their brain, which is by some supposed to be of a size
with every animal's understanding, shews <PB N="164" REF="170"/> that fish
are inferior even to birds in this parti∣cular. It is divided into three parts,
surrounded with a whitish froth, and gives off nerves as well to the
sense of sight as of smelling. In some fish it is grey, in others
white; in some it is flatted, in others round; but in all extremely small,
compared to the bulk of the animal.</P>
<P>Thus Nature seems to have fitted these ani∣mals with
appetites and powers of an inferior kind; and formed them for a sort of
passive existence in the obscure and heavy element to which they are
consigned. To preserve their own existence, and to continue it to their
posterity, fill up the whole circle of their pur∣suits and enjoyments; to
these they are im∣pelled rather by necessity than choice, and seem
mechanically excited to every fruition. Their senses are incapable of
making any distinctions; but they drive forward in pursuit of whatever they
can swallow, conquer, or enjoy.</P>
<P>A ceaseless desire of food seems to give the ruling
impulse to all their motions. This ap∣petite impels them to encounter every
danger; and indeed their rapacity seems insatiable. Even when taken out of
the water, and almost expire∣ing, they greedily swallow the very bait by
which they were allured to destruction.</P>
<P>The maw is, in general, placed next the <PB N="165" REF="171"/>
mouth; and though possessed of no sensible heat, is however endued
with a surprizing faculty of digestion. Its digestive power seems, in
some measure, to encrease with the quantity of food it is supplied
with; a single pike having been known to devour an hundred roaches in three
days. Its faculties also are as extraordinary; for it digests not only
fish, but much harder substances; prawns, crabs, and lobsters, shells
and all. These the cod or the sturgeon will not only devour, but
dissolve down, though their shells are so much harder than the sides
of the stomach which contains them. This amaz∣ing faculty in the cold maw of
fishes has justly excited the curiosity of philosophers; and has
effectually overturned the system of those, who supposed that the
heat of the stomach was alone a sufficient instrument for digestion.
The truth seems to be, and some experiments of the skilful Dr. Hunter
seem to evince, that there is a power of animal assimilation lodged in
the stomach of all creatures, which we can neither describe nor define,
converting the substances they swallow into a fluid fitted for their own
peculiar support. This is done neither by trituration, nor by warmth, nor by
motion, nor by a dissolving fluid, nor by their united efforts; but by
some principle in the stomach yet unknown, which <PB N="166" REF="172"/>
acts in a different manner from all kinds of artificial maceration. The meat
taken into the stomach or maw is often seen, though very near being
digested, still to retain its original form; and ready for a total
dissolution, while it ap∣pears to the eye as yet untouched by the force of
the stomach. This animal power is lodged in the maw of fishes, in a greater
degree than in any other creatures; their digestive powers are quick, and
their appetites ever are craving.</P>
<P>Yet, though fish are thus hungry, and for¦ever prowling, no
animals can suffer the want of food for so long a time. The gold and
silver fish we keep in vases seem never to want any nourishment at
all; whether it be that they feed on the water-insects, too minute for our
observation, or that water alone is a sufficient supply, is not evident;
but they are often seen for months without apparent sustenance. Even the
pike, the most voracious of fishes, will live in a pond where there is none
but him∣self; and, what is more extraordinary, will be often found to thrive
there.</P>
<P>Still, however, fish are of all other animals the most
voracious and insatiable. Whatever any of them is able to swallow
possessed of life, seems to be considered as the most desirable
food. Some that have very small mouths feed <PB N="167" REF="173"/> upon worms
and the spawn of other fish: others, whose mouths are larger, seek
larger prey; it matters not of what kind, whether of another or their own.
Those with the largest mouths pursue almost every thing that has life;
and often meet each other in fierce opposition, when the fish with the
largest swallow comes off with the victory, and devours its
antagonist.</P>
<P>Thus are they irritated by the continual desire of
satisfying their hunger; and the life of a fish, from the smallest to
the greatest, is but one scene of hostility, violence and evasion. But
the smaller fry stand no chance in the unequal combat; and their usual
way of escaping, is by swimming into those shallows where the greater
are unable or too heavy to pursue. There they become invaders in turn, and
live upon the spawn of larger fish, which they find floating upon the
surface of the water: yet there are dangers attending them in every place.
Even in the shallows, the muscle, the oyster, and the scallop, lie in
ambush at the bottom, with their shells open, and whatever little fish
inadvertently approaches into contact, they at once close their shells upon
him, and devour the imprisoned prey at their leisure.</P>
<P>Nor is the pursuit of fishes, like that of ter∣restrial
animals, confined to a single region, or <PB N="168" REF="174"/> to one
effort: shoals of one species follow those of another through vasts
tracts of ocean, from the vicinity of the pole even down to the equator. Thus
the cod, from the banks of Newfoundland, pursues the whiting, which flies
before it even to the southern shores of Spain. The cachalot is said, in
the same manner, to pursue a shoal of herrings, and to swallow
thou∣sands at a gulp.</P>
<P>This may be one cause of the annual mi∣gration of fishes
from one part of the ocean to the other; but there are other motives, which
come in aid of this also. Fishes may be induced to change the place of
their residence, for one more suited to their constitutions, or more
adapted to depositing their spawn. It is re∣markable that no fish are
fond of very cold waters, and generally frequent those places where it is
warmest. Thus, in summer, they are seen in great numbers in the
shallows near the shore, where the sun has power to warm the water to the
bottom; on the contrary, in winter, they are found towards the bottom in the
deep sea, for the cold of the atmosphere is not suf∣ficiently penetrating
to reach them at those great depths. Cold produces the same effect upon
fresh-water fishes; and when they are often seen dead after severe
frosts, it is most probable that <PB N="169" REF="175"/> they have been
killed by the severity of the cold, as well as by their being excluded by the
ice from air.</P>
<P>All fish live in the water; yet they all stand in need of
air for their support. Those of the whale kind, indeed, breathe the air in
the same manner as we do, and come to the surface every two or three
minutes to take a fresh inspi∣ration: but those which continue entirely
under water, are yet under a necessity of being sup∣plied with air, or
they will expire in a very few minutes. We sometimes see all the fish of
a pond killed, when the ice every where covers the surface of the water, and
thus keeps off the air from the subjacent fluid. If a hole be made in the
ice, the fish will be seen to come all to that part, in order to take the
benefit of a fresh supply. Should a carp, in a large vase of water, be
placed under an air-pump, and then be deprived of its air, during the operation
a number of bubbles will be seen standing upon the surface of the
fish's body; soon after the ani∣mal will appear to breathe swifter and
with greater difficulty; it will then be seen to rise towards the surface
to get more air; the bubbles on its sur∣face begin to disappear; the belly,
that was be∣fore swolen, will then fall of a sudden, and the animal sinks
expiring and convulsed at the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="176"/>So very necessary is air to all
animals, but particularly to fish, that, as was said, they can live but a
few minutes without it: yet nothing is more difficult to be accounted for, than
the manner in which they obtain this necessary sup∣ply. Those who have
seen a fish in the water, must remember the motion of its lips and its
gills, or at least of the bones on each side that cover them. This motion
in the animal is, without doubt, analogous to our breathing; but it is not air,
but water, that the fish actually sucks in and spouts out through the
gills at every motion. The manner of its breathing is thus: the fish first
takes a quantity of water by the mouth, which is driven to the gills; these
close and keep the water so swallowed from returning by the mouth; while
the bony covering of the gills prevents it from going through them, until the
animal has drawn the proper quantity of air from the body of water thus
imprisoned: then the bony covers open and give it a free passage; by
which means also the gills again are opened and admit a fresh quantity of
water. Should the fish be prevented from the free play of its gills, or
should the bony covers be kept from moving, by a string tied round them,
the animal would soon fall into convulsions and die in a few minutes.</P>
<P>But though this be the general method of <PB N="171" REF="177"/> explaining respiration in fishes, the difficulty remains to know
what is done with this air, which the fish in this manner separates from
the water. There seems no receptacle for containing it; the stomach being
the chief cavity within the body, is too much filled with aliment for that
purpose. There is indeed a cavity, and that a pretty large one, I mean the
air-bladder or swim, which may serve to contain it for vital purposes;
but that our philosophers have long destined to a very different use. The
use univer∣sally assigned to the air-bladder is the enabling the fish
to rise or sink in the water at pleasure, as that is dilated or
compressed. The use assigned by the ancients for it was to come in
aid of the lungs, and to remain as a kind of store-house of air to supply
the animal in its necessities. I own my attachment to this last opinion;
but let us exhibit both with their proper share of evidence, and the reader
must be left to determine.</P>
<P>The air-bladder is described as a bag filled with air,
sometimes composed of one, some∣times of two, and sometimes of three
divisions, situated towards the back of the fish, and open∣ing into the
maw or the gullet. Those who contend that this bag is designed for
raising or depressing the fish in the water, build upon the following
experiment. A carp being put into the <PB N="172" REF="178"/> air-pump, and the
air exhausted, the bladder is said to expand itself to such a degree,
that the fish swells in an extraordinary manner till the bladder bursts,
and then the fish sinks, and ever after continues to crawl at the bottom.
On ano∣ther occasion, the air-bladder was pricked and wounded, which let out
its air; upon which the fish funk to the bottom, and was not seen to rise
after. From thence it is inferred, that the use of the air-bladder must be
by swelling at the will of the animal, thus to encrease the sur∣face of
the fish's body, and thence diminishing its specific gravity, to enable
it to rise to the top of the water, and keep there at pleasure. On the
contrary, when the fish wants to descend, it is, say they, but to
exhaust this bladder of its air; and the fish being thus rendered slimmer
and heavier, consequently sinks to the bottom.</P>
<P>Such is the account given of the use of the air-bladder; no
part of which seems to me well supported. In the first place, though
nothing is more certain, than that a carp put into the air-pump will swell,
yet so will a mouse or a frog; and these we know to have no
air-blad∣ders. A carp will rise to the surface: but so will all fish
that want air, whether they have an air-bladder or not. The air-bladder is
said to burst in the experiment; but that I deny. The <PB N="173" REF="179"/> air-bladder is indeed found empty, but it has suffered no
laceration, and may be distended by being blown into like any other bladder
that is sound. The fish after the experiment, I grant, continues to creep
at the bottom; and so will all fish that are sick and wounded, which
must be the case with this after such an operation. Thus these facts
prove nothing, but that when the fish is killed in an air-pump the
air-bladder is found exhausted; and that it will naturally and
necessarily be; for the drain of air by which the fish is supplied in
the natural way will necessarily oblige it to make use of all its hidden
stores; and, as there is a communication between the gullet and the
air-bladder, the air which the latter contains will thus be obviously drawn
away. But still farther, how comes the air-bladder, according to their
hypothesis, to swell under the experiment of the air-pump? What is it that
closes the aperture of that organ in such a manner as at last to burst
it; or what ne∣cessity has the fish for dilating it to that violent
degree? At most, it only wants to rise to the sur∣face; and that the
fish can easily do without so great a distention of the air-bladder.
Indeed, it should rather seem, that the more the air was wanted without,
the less necessity there was for its being uselessly accumulated
within; and to <PB N="174" REF="180"/> make the modern system
consistent, the fish un∣der the air-pump, instead of permitting its
bladder to be burst, would readily give up its contents; which, upon their
supposition, all can do at pleasure.</P>
<P>But the truth is, the fish can neither encrease nor
diminish the quantity of air in its air-bladder at will, no more than we can
that which is con∣tained in our stomachs. The animal has no one muscle,
much less pair of muscles, for contracting or dilating this organ; its
aperture is from the gullet; and what air is put into it must remain there
till the necessities, and not the will, of the animal call it forth as a
supply.</P>
<P>But, to put the matter past a doubt, many fish are
furnished with an air-bladder that continually crawl at the bottom; such as
the eel and the flounder; and many more are entirely without any bladder, that
swim at ease in every depth; such as the anchovy and fresh-water
gudgeon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Redi.</BIBL></NOTE>. Indeed, the number
of fish that want this organ is alone a sufficient proof that it is not
so neces∣sary for the purposes of swimming; and as the ventral fins,
which in all fish lie flat upon the water, seem fully sufficient to keep
them at all depths, I see no great occasion for this internal
philosophical apparatus for raising and depress∣ing <PB N="175" REF="181"/> them. Upon the whole, the air-bladder seems adapted for different
purposes than that of keeping the fish at different depths in the water;
but whether it be to supply them with air when it is wanted from without, or
for what other purpose, I will not take upon me to de∣termine.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have seen fish in every respect inferior to
land animals; in the simplicity of their conformation, in their senses,
and their enjoyments; but of that humble existence which they have been
granted by nature, they have a longer term than any other class of ani∣mated
nature. 
<Q REND="inline">"Most of the disorders incident to
mankind," says Bacon, "arise from the changes and alterations of the
atmosphere; but fishes reside in an element little subject to change;
theirs is an uniform existence; their movements are without effort, and their
life without labour. Their bones also, which are united by cartilages, admit
of indefinite ex∣tension; and the different sizes of animals of the same
kind among fishes is very various. They still keep growing; their bodies,
in∣stead of suffering the rigidity of age, which is the cause of natural
decay in land animals, still continue encreasing with fresh supplies;
and as the body grows the conduits of life furnish their stores in greater
abundance. <PB N="176" REF="182"/> How long a fish that seems to have
scarce any bounds put to its growth continues to live is not ascertained;
perhaps the life of a man would not be long enough to measure that of the
smallest."</Q></P>
<P>There have been two methods devised for determining the age
of fishes, which are more ingenious than certain; the one is by the circles
of the scales, the other by the transverse section of the back-bone.
The first method is this. When a fish's scale is examined through a
mi∣croscope, it will be found to consist of a number of circles, one
circle within another, in some measure resembling those which appear
upon the transverse section of a tree, and supposed to offer the
same information. For as in trees we can tell their age by the number of
their circles, so in fishes we can tell theirs by the number of circles in
every scale, reckoning one ring for every year of the animal's existence.
By this method, Mr. Buffon found a carp, whose scales he examined, to be
not less than a hundred years old; a thing almost incredible had we not
several accounts in other authors which tend to confirm the discovery.
Gesner brings us an instance of one of the same age; and Albertus of one
more than double that period.</P>
<P>The age of the skate and the ray, that want scales, may be
known by the other method; <PB N="177" REF="183"/> which is, by separating the
joints of the back∣bone, and then minutely observing the number of rings
which the surface where it was joined exhibits. By this the fish's age is
said to be known; and perhaps with as much certainty as in the former
instance.</P>
<P>But how unsatisfactory soever these marks may be, we
have no reason to doubt the great age of some fishes. Those that have
ponds often know the oldest by their superior size. But the longevity of
these animals is nothing when compared to their fecundity. All sorts, a few
of the larger ones excepted, multiply their kind some by hundreds and some
by millions. There are some that bring forth their young alive, and some
that only produce eggs: the former are rather the least fruitful: yet even
these are seen to produce in great abun∣dance. The viviparous blenny, for
instance, brings forth two or three hundred at a time, all alive and playing
round the parent together. Those who exclude their progeny in a more
imperfect state, and produce eggs, which they are obliged to leave to chance,
either on the bottom at the edge of the water, or floating on the surface
where it is deeper, are all much more prolific; and seem to proportion their
stock to the danger there is of its consumption. Of <PB N="178" REF="184"/>
these eggs thus deposited, scarce one in an hundred brings forth an
animal; they are de∣voured by all the lesser fry that frequent the
shores; by aquatic birds near the margin, and by the larger fish in deep
water. Still, however, there are enough for supplying the deep with
inhabitants; and, notwithstanding their own ra∣pacity and that of the fowls
of various tribes, the numbers that escape are sufficient to relieve the
wants of a very considerable part of mankind. Indeed, when we consider the
numbers that a single fish is capable of producing, the amount will seem
astonishing. If, for instance, we should be told of a being so very
prolific, that in a single season it could bring forth as many of its
kind as there are inhabitants in England, it would strike us with surprize;
yet a single cod produces full that number. The cod spawns in one
season, as Lewenhoeck assures us, above nine million of eggs or peas
contained in one single roe. The flounder is commonly known to produce above
one million; and the mackarel above five hundred thousand. Such an amazing
encrease, if permitted to come to maturity, would overstock nature, and
even the ocean itself would not be able to contain, much less to provide
for, the half of its inha∣bitants. But two wise purposes are answered by
this amazing encrease; it preserves the species <PB N="179" REF="185"/> in
the midst of numberless enemies, and serves to furnish the rest with
a sustenance adapted to their nature.</P>
<P>Fishes seem, all except the whale-kind, en∣tirely
divested of those parental solicitudes which so strongly mark the
manners of the more perfect terrestrial animals. How far they co∣pulate
remains as yet a doubt; for though they seem to join, yet the male is not
furnished with any external instrument of generation. It is said, by
some, that his only end in that action is to emit his impregnating milt upon
the eggs that at that time fall from the fe∣male. He is said to be seen
pursuing them as they float down the stream, and carefully impregnating
them one after another. On some occasions also the females dig holes in
the bot∣tom of rivers and ponds, and there deposit their spawn, which is
impregnated by the male in the same manner. All this, however, is very
doubtful; what we know with certainty of the matter, and that not discovered
till very lately, is, that the male has two organs of generation that open into
the bladder of urine, and that these organs do not open into the rectum as in
birds, but have a particular aperture of their own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vide Gaman de Generatione Piscium.</BIBL></NOTE>. These
organs of generation in the male are <PB N="180" REF="186"/> empty at some
seasons of the year; but before the time of spawing they are turgid with
what is called the milt, and emit the fluid proper for impregnation.</P>
<P>Fish have different seasons for depositing their
spawn: some, that live in the depths of the ocean, are said to chuse
the winter months; but, in general, those with which we are acquainted,
chuse the hottest months in summer, and prefer such water as is
somewhat tepefied by the beams of the sun. They then leave the deepest
parts of the ocean, which are the coldest, and shoal round the coasts, or
swim up the fresh-water rivers, which are warm as they are comparatively
shallow. When they have deposited their burthens, they then return to their
old stations, and leave their nascent progeny to shift for
themselves.</P>
<P>The spawn continues in its egg-state in some fish
longer than in others, and this in proportion to the animal's size. In the
salmon, for instance, the young animal continues in the egg from the
beginning of December till the beginning of April; the carp continues in the
egg not above three weeks; the little gold fish from China is produced
still quicker. These all, when excluded, at first escape by their
minuteness and agility. They rise, sink, and turn much readier than grown
<PB N="181" REF="187"/> fish; and they can escape into very shallow waters
when pursued. But, with all their ad∣vantages, scarce one in a thousand
survives the numerous perils of its youth. The very male and female that have
given them birth, are equally dangerous and formidable with the rest,
forgetting all relation at their departure.</P>
<P>Such is the general picture of these heedless and hungry
creatures: but there are some in this class, living in the waters, that are
pos∣sessed of finer organs and higher sensations; that have all the
tenderness of birds or quadru∣pedes for their young; that nurse them with
con∣stant care, and protect them from every injury. Of this class are the
<HI>Cetaceous</HI> tribe, or the fishes of the whale-kind. There are others,
though not capable of nursing their young, yet that bring them alive into the
world, and defend them with courage and activity. These are the
<HI>Cartilaginous</HI> kinds, or those who have gristles instead of
bones. But the fierce unmindful tribe we have been de∣scribing, that leave
their spawn without any protection, are called the <HI>Spinous</HI> or bony
kinds, from their bones resembling the sharpness of thorns.</P>
<P>Thus there are three grand divisions in the fish-kind: the
<HI>cetaceous,</HI> the <HI>cartilaginous,</HI> and the <HI>spinous</HI>; all
differing from each other in <PB N="182" REF="188"/> their conformation, their
appetites, in their bringing forth, and in the education of their young.
These three great distinctions are not the capricious differences formed by
a maker of systems, but are strongly and firmly marked in nature. These
are the distinctions of Aristotle; and they have been adopted by mankind
ever since his time. It will be necessary, therefore, to give the
history of each of these in particular; and then to range under each head,
those fishes whose history is the most remarkable; or, more properly
speaking, those of which we have any history. For we shall find, when
we come to any of the species in particular, how little can be said of
their habits, their stations, or me∣thod of propagation.</P>
<P>Much, indeed, can be said of them, if considered
relatively to man; and large books have been written of the manner of taking
fish; or of dressing them. Apicius is noted for having first taught
mankind to suffocate fish in Cartha∣ginian pickle; and Quin for giving a
sauce to the Johndory: Mrs. Glass is famous for her eel pie, and Mr. Tull
for his invention of spay∣ing carp to give it a finer flavour. In this manner
our cooks handle the subject. On the other hand, our physicians assure
us that the flesh of fishes yields little nourishment, and soon
cor∣rupts; <PB N="183" REF="189"/> that it abounds in a gross sort of oil
and water, and hath but few volatile particles, which renders it less fit to
be converted into the substance of our bodies. They are cold and moist,
and must needs, say they, produce juices of the same kind, and
consequently are im∣proper to strengthen the body. In this di∣versity of
opinion, it is the wisest way to eat our fish in the ordinary manner, and
pay no great attention to cooks or doctors.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this chapter without put∣ting a question
to the learned which, I confess, I am not able to resolve. How comes it
that fish which are bred in a salt element have yet no salt to the
taste, or that is capable of being ex∣tracted from it?</P>

<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Cetaceous Fishes in General.</HEAD>
<P>AS on land there are some orders of animals that seem
formed to command the rest, with greater powers and more various instincts,
so in the ocean there are fishes which seem formed upon a nobler plan
than others, and that, to their fishy form, join the appetites and the
conformation of quadrupedes. These all are of the <HI>cetaceous</HI> kind;
and so much raised above their fellows of the deep, in their appetites and
instincts, that almost all our modern naturalists have fairly excluded
them from the finny tribes, and will have them called, not fishes, but, great
beasts of the ocean. With them it would be as improper to say men go to
Greenland fishing for whale, as it would be to say that a sportsman
goes to Blackwall a fowling for mackarel.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding philosophers, mankind will always
have their own way of talking; and for my own part I think them here in the
right. A different formation of the lungs, stomach and intestines, a
different manner of breathing or propagating, are not sufficient to
counterbalance the great obvious analogy which <PB N="185" REF="191"/> these
animals bear to the whole finny tribe. They are shaped as other fishes;
they swim with fins; they are entirely naked, without hair; they live in the
water, though they come up to breathe; they are only seen in the depths of
the ocean, and never come upon shore but when forced thither. These sure
are sufficient to plead in favour of the general denomination, and acquit
mankind of error in ranking them with their lower companions of the deep.</P>
<P>But still they are as many degrees raised above other
fishes in their nature, as they are in general in their size. This tribe is
composed of the Whale and its varieties, of the Cachalot, the Dolphin, the
Grampus, and the Porpess. All these resemble quadrupedes in their
internal structure, and in some of their appetites and affections. Like
quadrupedes, they have lungs, a midriff, a stomach, intestines, liver,
spleen, bladder, and parts of generation; their heart also resembles that
of quadrupedes, with its parti∣tions closed up as in them, and driving red
and warm blood in circulation through the body. In short, every internal part
bears a most striking similitude; and to keep these parts warm, the
whole kind are also covered between the skin and the muscles with a thick
coat of fat or blubber, which, like the bacon-fat of an hog, 
<PB N="186" REF="192"/> keeps out the cold, renders their muscles glib and
pliant, and probably makes them lighter in swimming.</P>
<P>As these animals breathe the air, it is obvious that they
cannot bear to be any long time under water. They are constrained, therefore,
every two or three minutes, to come up to the sur∣face to take breath, as
well as to spout out through their nostril, for they have but one, that
water which they sucked in while gaping for their prey. This conduit, by
which they breathe, and also throw out the water, is placed in the head, a
little before the brain. Though externally the hole is but single, it is
internally divided by a bony partition, which is closed by a sphincter
muscle on the inside, that, like the mouth of a purse, shuts it up at
the pleasure of the animal. There is also another muscle or valve, which
prevents the water from going down the gullet. When therefore the animal takes
in a certain quantity of water, which is necessary to be discharged and
separated from its food, it shuts the mouth, closes the valve of the
stomach, opens the sphincter that kept the nostril closed, and then
breathing strongly from the lungs, pushes the water out by the effort, as
we see it rise by the pressure of air in a fire-engine.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="193"/>The senses of these animals seem
also superior to those of other fishes. The eyes of other fishes, we
have observed, are covered only with that transparent skin that covers
the rest of the head; but in all the cetaceous kinds, it is co∣vered by
eye-lids, as in man. This, no doubt, keeps that organ in a more perfect
state, by giving it intervals of relaxation, in which all vision is
suspended. The other fishes, that are for ever staring, must see,
if for no other reason, more feebly, as their organs of sight are always
exerted.</P>
<P>As for hearing, these also are furnished with the
internal instruments of the ear, although the external orifice no where
appears. It is most probable that this orifice may open by some canal,
resembling the Eustachian tube, into the mouth; but this has not as yet
been discovered.</P>
<P>Yet Nature sure has not thus formed a com∣plete apparatus
for hearing, and denied the animal the use of it when formed. It is most
likely that all animals of the cetaceous kind can hear, as they certainly utter
sounds, and bel∣low to each other. This vocal power would be as needless to
animals naturally deaf, as glasses to a man that was blind.</P>
<P>But it is in the circumstances in which they continue their
kind, that these animals shew an <PB N="188" REF="194"/> eminent
superiority. Other fish deposit their spawn, and leave the success
to accident: these never produce above one young, or two at the most; and
this the female suckles entirely in the manner of quadrupedes, her breasts
being placed, as in the human kind, above the navel. We have read many fabulous
accounts of the nursing of the demigods of antiquity, of their feeding on the
marrow of lions, and their being suckled by wolves; one might imagine a
still more heroic system of nutrition, if we sup∣posed that the young
hero was suckled and grew strong upon the breast-milk of a
she-whale.</P>
<P>The whale or the grampus are terrible at any time; but are
fierce and desperate in the defence of their young. In Waller's beautiful
poem of the Summer Islands, we have a story, founded upon fact, which
shews the maternal tenderness of these animals for their offspring. A
whale and her cub had got into an arm of the sea, where, by the desertion
of the tide, they were enclosed on every side. The people from shore
soon saw their situation, and drove down upon them in boats, with such
weapons as the urgent occasion offered. The two animals were soon wounded
in several places, and the whole sea round was tinctured with their blood.
The whales made se∣veral attempts to escape; and at last the old one, 
<PB N="189" REF="195"/> by its superior strength, forced over the shallow,
into the depths of the ocean. But though in safety herself, she could not
bear the danger that awaited her young one; she therefore rushed in once
more where the smaller animal was impri∣soned, and resolved, when she
could not protect, at least to share his danger.—The story ends
with poetical justice; for the tide coming in, brought off both in safety
from their enemies, though not without sustaining an infinite num∣ber of
wounds in every part.</P>
<P>As to the rest, the distinctive marks of this tribe are,
that the number of their fins never exceeds three; namely, two pectoral fins,
and one back fin; but in some sorts the last is want∣ing. These fins
differ very much from those of other fishes, which are formed of straight
spines: the fins of the cetaceous tribe are made up of bones and muscles;
and the skeleton of one of their fins, very much resembles the skeleton
of a man's hand. Their tails also are different from those of all other
fish: they are placed so as to lie flat on the surface of the water;
while the other kinds have them, as we every day see, upright or edgeways.
This flat position of the tail in cetaceous animals, enables them to force
themselves suddenly to the surface of the water to breathe, which they
are con∣tinually constrained to do.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="196"/>Of these enormous animals, some are
without teeth, and properly called whales; others have the teeth only in the
lower jaw, and are called, by the French, cachalots: the narwhal has teeth only
in the upper jaw: the dolphin's teeth, as well as those of the porpess and
grampus, are both above and below. These are the marks that serve to
distinguish the kinds of this enormous tribe from each other; and these
shall serve to guide us, in giving their history.</P>

<PB N="191" REF="197"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Whale, properly so called, and its
Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>IF we compare land animals, in respect to magnitude, with
those of the deep, they will appear contemptible in the competition. It is
probable, indeed, that quadrupedes once ex∣isted much larger than we find
them at pre∣sent. From the skeletons of some that have been dug up at
different times, it is evident, that there must have been terrestrial
animals twice as large as the elephant; but creatures of such an immense
bulk required a proportion∣able extent of ground for subsistence, and, by
being rivals with men for large territory, they must have been destroyed in
the contest.</P>
<P>But it is not only upon land that man has exerted his power of
destroying the larger tribes of animated nature, he has extended his efforts
even into the midst of the ocean, and has cut off numbers of those enormous
animals that had perhaps existed for ages. We now no longer hear of whales
two hundred, and two hundred and fifty, feet long, which we are certain were
often seen about two centuries ago. They have all <PB N="192" REF="198"/> been
destroyed by the skill of mankind, and the species is now dwindled into a
race of di∣minutive animals, from thirty to about eighty feet long.</P>
<P>The northern seas were once the region to which the
greatest of these animals resorted; but so great has been the
slaughter of whales for more than two ages, that they begin to grow thinner
every day; and those that are found there, seem, from their size, not
come to their full dimensions. The greatest whales resort to places where
they have the least di∣sturbance; to those seas that are on the
opposite side of the globe, near the south pole. In that part of the
world, there are still to be seen whales that are above an hundred and
sixty feet long; and perhaps even longer might be found in those latitudes
near the south pole, to which we have not as yet ventured.</P>
<P>Taking the whale, however, at the ordinary size of eighty
feet long and twenty feet high, what an enormous animated mass must it
ap∣pear to the spectator! With what amazement must it strike him, to
behold so great a creature gambolling in the deep, with the ease and
agility of the smallest animal, and making its way with incredible
swiftness! This is a sight which is very common to those who frequent
the northern or <PB N="193" REF="199"/> southern ocean. Yet though this be
wonderful, perhaps still greater wonders are concealed in the deep, which we
have not had opportunities of exploring. These large animals are obliged to
shew themselves in order to take breath; but who knows the size of
those that are fitted to remain for ever under water; and that have been
encreasing in magnitude for centuries? To believe all that has been said of
the sea-serpent, or the Kraken, would be credulity; to reject the
possibility of their existence, would be pre∣sumption.</P>
<P>The Whale is the largest animal of which we have any certain
information; and the va∣rious purposes to which, when taken, its dif∣ferent
parts are converted, have brought us tolerably acquainted with its history.
Of the whale, properly so called, there are no less than seven different
kinds; all distinguished from each other by their external figure, or
internal conformation. The Great Greenland Whale, without a back-fin, and black
on the back; the Iceland Whale, without a back-fin, and whitish on the back;
the New England Whale, with a hump on the back; the Whale with six humps on
the back; the Fin-fish, with a fin on the back near the tail; the Pike-headed
Whale, and the Round-lipped Whale. All these differ <PB N="194" REF="200"/>
from each other in figure, as their names obviously imply. They differ also
somewhat in their manner of living; the fin-fish having a larger swallow
than the rest, being more active, slender and fierce, and living chiefly
upon herrings. However, they are none of them very voracious; and, if compared
to the Cachalot, that enormous tyrant of the deep, they appear harmless and
gentle. The history of the rest, therefore, may be comprized under that of
the Great Common Greenland Whale, with which we are best acquainted.</P>
<P>The Great Greenland Whale is the fish for taking which there
are such preparations made in different parts of Europe. It is a large heavy
animal, and the head alone makes a third of its bulk. It is usually found
from sixty to seventy feet long. The fins on each side are from five to
eight feet, composed of bones and muscles, and sufficiently strong to
give the great mass of body which they move, speed and activity. The tail,
which lies flat on the water, is about twenty-four feet broad; and, when the
fish lies on one side, its blow is tremendous. The skin is smooth and
black, and, in some places, marbled with white and yellow; which, running
over the surface, has a very beautiful effect. This marbling is par∣ticularly
observable in the fins and the tail. In <PB N="195" REF="201"/> the figures
which are thus drawn by Nature, fancy often forms the pictures of trees,
land∣scapes and houses. In the tail of one that was thus marbled, Ray tells
us that the number 122 was figured very evenly and exact, as if done with a
pencil.</P>
<P>The whale makes use only of the tail to ad∣vance itself
forward in the water. This serves as a great oar to push its mass along;
and it is surprizing to see with what force and celerity its enormous bulk
cuts through the ocean. The fins are only made use of for turning in the
water, and giving a direction to the velocity impressed by the tail. The
female also makes use of them, when pursued, to bear off her young,
clapping them on her back, and sup∣porting them by the fins on each side
from falling.</P>
<P>The outward or scarf skin of the whale is no thicker than
parchment; but this removed, the real skin appears, of about an inch thick,
and covering the fat or blubber that lies beneath: this is from eight to twelve
inches in thickness; and is, when the fish is in health, of a beautiful
yellow. The muscles lie beneath; and these, like the flesh of
quadrupedes, are very red and tough.</P>
<P>The cleft of the mouth is above twenty feet 
<PB N="196" REF="202"/> long, which is near one third of the animal's whole
length; and the upper jaw is furnished with barbs, that lie, like the pipes
of an organ, the greatest in the middle, and the smallest to the sides.
These compose the whale-bone; the longest spars of which are found to
be not less than eighteen feet: the shortest, being of no value, are
thrown away. The tongue is almost immovably fixed to the lower jaw, seeming
one great lump of fat; and, in fact, it fills several hogsheads with
blubber. The eyes are not larger than those of an ox; and when the
chrystaline humour is dried, it does not appear larger than a pea. They are
placed towards the back of the head, being the most convenient situation
for enabling them to see both before and behind; as also to see over
them, where their food is principally found. They are guarded by eye-lids and
eye-lashes, as in quadrupedes; and they seem to be very
sharp-sighted.</P>
<P>Nor is their sense of hearing in less per∣fection; for
they are warned, at great distances, of any danger preparing against them.
It would seem as if Nature had designedly given them these advantages, as
they multiply little, in order to continue their kind. It is true indeed, that
the external organ of hearing is not per∣ceptible, <PB N="197" REF="203"/> for
this might only embarrass them in their natural element; but as soon as the
thin scarf skin abovementioned is removed, a black spot is discovered
behind the eye, and under that is the auditory canal, that leads to a regular
apparatus for hearing. In short, the animal hears the smallest sounds
at very great distances, and at all times, except when it is spouting
water; which is the time that the fishers ap∣proach to strike it.</P>
<P>These spout-holes or nostrils, in all the ceta∣ceous
tribe, have been already described: in this whale they are two; one on each
side the head before the eyes, and crooked, somewhat like the holes on the
belly of a violin. From these holes this animal blows the water very
fiercely, and with such a noise that it roars like a hollow wind, and may
be heard at three miles distance. When wounded, it then blows more fiercely
than ever, so that it sounds like the roaring of the sea in a great
storm.</P>
<P>We have already observed, that the substance called
whalebone, is taken from the upper jaw of the animal, and is very different
from the real bones of the whale. The real bones are hard, like those of
great land animals, are very porous, and filled with marrow. Two great strong
bones sustain the under lip, lying against <PB N="198" REF="204"/> each
other in the shape of an half-moon: some of these are twenty feet long;
they are seen in several gardens set up against each other, and are
usually mistaken for the ribs of this animal.</P>
<P>Such is the general conformation and figure of this great
inhabitant of the deep, the precise anatomy of which has not been yet
ascertained. In those places where they are caught in greatest abundance,
the sailors are not very curious as to the structure of the viscera; and
few anatomists care to under∣take a task, where the operator, instead of
separating with a lancet, must cut his way with an ax. It is as yet
doubted, therefore, whether the whale, that in most points inter∣nally
resembles a quadrupede, may not have one great bowel fitted entirely for the
re∣ception of air, to supply it, when constrained to keep longer than
usual at the bottom. The sailors universally affirm that it has; and
phi∣losophers have nothing but the analogy of its parts to oppose to their
general assertions.</P>
<P>As these animals resemble quadrupedes in conformation,
so they bear a strong resemblance in some of their appetites and
manners. The female joins with the male, as is asserted, <HI>more
humano,</HI> and once in two years feels the accesses of desire.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="205"/>Their fidelity to each other exceeds
whatever we are told of even the constancy of birds. Some fishers, as
Anderson informs us, having struck one of two whales, a male and a female,
that were in company together, the wounded fish made a long and terrible
resistance: it struck down a boat with three men in it, with a single
blow of the tail, by which all went to the bottom. The other still attended
its com∣panion, and lent it every assistance; till, at last, the fish
that was struck, sunk under the number of its wounds; while its faithful
asso∣ciate, disdaining to survive the loss, with great bellowing,
stretched itself upon the dead fish, and shared his fate.</P>
<P>The whale goes with young nine or ten months, and is then
fatter than usual, par∣ticularly when near the time of bringing forth. It is
said that the embryo, when first percep∣tible, is about seventeen inches
long, and white; but the cub, when excluded, is black, and about ten feet long.
She generally produces one young one, and never above two. When she suckles
her young, she throws herself on one side on the surface of the sea,
and the young one attaches itself to the tate. The breasts are two;
generally hid within the belly; but she <PB N="200" REF="206"/> can produce
them at pleasure, so as to stand forward a foot and an half, or two feet;
and the tates are like those of a cow. In some, the breasts are white; in
others, speckled; in all, filled with a large quantity of milk, re∣sembling
that of land animals.</P>
<P>Nothing can exceed the tenderness of the female for her
offspring; she carries it with her wherever she goes, and, when hardest
pur∣sued, keeps it supported between her fins. Even when wounded, she
still clasps her young one; and when she plunges to avoid danger, takes
it to the bottom; but rises sooner than usual, to give it breath
again.</P>
<P>The young ones continue at the breast for a year; during
which time, they are called by the sailors, <HI>short-heads.</HI> They are
then extremely fat, and yield above fifty barrels of blubber. The mother, at
the same time, is equally lean and emaciated. At the age of two years they
are called <HI>stunts,</HI> as they do not thrive much immediately after
quitting the breast: they then yield scarce above twenty, or twenty-four,
barrels of blubber: from that time forward they are called
<HI>skull-fish,</HI> and their age is wholly unknown.</P>
<P>Every species of whale propagates only with those of its
own kind, and does not at all min∣gle <PB N="201" REF="207"/> with the rest:
however, they are generally seen in shoals, of different kinds together,
and make their migrations in large companies, from one ocean to another. They
are a gregarious animal, which implies their want of mutual defence against
the invasions of smaller, but more powerful, fishes. It seems
astonishing, therefore, how a shoal of these enormous animals find
subsistence together, when it would seem that the supplying even one
with food would require greater plenty than the ocean could furnish. To
encrease our wonder, we not only see them herding together, but usually
find them fatter than any other animals of whatsoever ele∣ment. We likewise
know that they cannot swallow large fishes, as their throat is so
nar∣row, that an animal larger than an herring could not enter. How then do
they subsist and grow so fat? A small insect which is seen
floating in those seas, and which Linnaeus terms the Medusa, is
sufficient for this supply. These insects are black, and of the size
of a small bean, and are sometimes seen floating in clusters on the
sur∣face of the water. They are of a round form, like snails in a box, but
they have wings, which are so tender that it is scarce possible to
touch them without breaking. These serve rather for swimming than flying;
and the little <PB N="202" REF="208"/> animal is called by the Icelanders, the
Walfis∣choas, which signifies the whale's provender. They have the taste
of raw muscles, and have the smell of burnt sugar. These are the food
of the whale, which it is seen to draw up in great numbers with its huge
jaws, and to bruise between its barbs, which are always found with several
of these sticking among them.</P>
<P>This is the simple food of the great Green∣land whale; it
pursues no other animal, leads an inoffensive life in its element, and is
harmless in proportion to its strength to do mischief. There seems to
be an analogy between its manners and those of the elephant. They are both
the strongest and the largest animals in their respective ele∣ments;
neither offer injury, but are terrible when provoked to resentment. The
fin-fish indeed, in some measure, differs from the great whale in this
particular, as it subsists chiefly upon herrings, great shoals of which
it is often seen driving before it. Yet even the swallow of this fish is
not very large, if compared to the cachalot tribe; and its ravages are but
sports in comparison. The stomach and in∣testines of all these
animals, when opened, seldom have any thing in them, except a soft unctuous
substance, of a brownish colour; and their excrements are of a shining
red.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="209"/>As the whale is an inoffensive animal,
it is not to be wondered that it has many enemies, willing to take advantage of
its disposition, and inaptitude for combat. There is a small ani∣mal, of
the shell-fish kind, called the Whale∣louse, that sticks to its body,
as we see shells sticking to the foul bottom of a ship. This
insinuates itself chiefly under the fins; and what∣ever efforts the great
animal makes, it still keeps its hold, and lives upon the fat, which it is
provided with instruments to arrive at.</P>
<P>The sword-fish, however, is the whale's most terrible
enemy. 
<Q REND="inline">"At the sight of this little animal," says
Anderson, "the whale seems agitated in an extraordinary manner; leaping
from the water as if with affright: wherever it appears, the whale perceives it
at a distance, and flies from it in the op∣posite direction. I have been
myself," con∣tinues he, "a spectator of their terrible encounter. The whale
has no instrument of defence except the tail; with that it en∣deavours to
strike the enemy; and a single blow taking place, would effectually
destroy its adversary: but the sword-fish is as active as the other is
strong, and easily avoids the stroke; then bounding into the air, it
falls upon its great subjacent enemy, and endea∣vours <PB N="204" REF="210"/>
not to pierce with its pointed beak, but to cut with its toothed edges. The
sea all about is seen dyed with blood, proceeding from the wounds of the
whale; while the enor∣mous animal vainly endeavours to reach its invader, and
strikes with its tail against the surface of the water, making a report
at each blow louder than the noise of a cannon."</Q></P>
<P>There is still another and more powerful enemy called, by
the fishermen of New Eng∣land, the Killer. This is itself a cetaceous
animal, armed with strong and powerful teeth. A number of these are said
to surround a whale, in the same manner as dogs get round a bull. Some
attack it with their teeth behind; others attempt it before; until, at last,
the great animal is torn down, and its tongue is said to be the only part
they devour when they have made it their prey. They are said to be of such
great strength, that one of them alone was known to stop a dead whale that
several boats were towing along, and drag it from among them to the
bottom.</P>
<P>But of all the enemies of these enormous fishes, man is
the greatest: he alone destroys more in a year than the rest in an age,
and actually has thinned their numbers in that part of the world where they are
chiefly sought. The great resort of these animals, was found to be 
<PB N="205" REF="211"/> on the inhospitable shores of Spitzbergen; where the
distance of the voyage, the coldness of the climate, the terrors of the icy
sea, and, still more, their own formidable bulk, might have been expected
to protect them from human injury. But all these were but slight barriers
against man's arts, his courage, and his necessities. The European
ships, soon after the improvement of navigation, found the way into those
seas; and as early as the beginning of the fourteenth cen∣tury, the
Biscayneers were in possession of a very considerable trade to the
coasts of Greenland. The Dutch and the English followed them thi∣ther, and
soon took that branch of commerce out of their hands. The English commenced
the bu∣siness about the beginning of the seventeenth cen∣tury; and the
town of Hull had the honour of first attempting that profitable branch of
trade. But, at present, it seems upon the decline, as the quantity of
fish are so greatly reduced, by the constant capture for such a vast
length of time. It is now said, that the fishers, from a defect of whales,
apply themselves to the seal-fishery; yet, as these animals are
extremely timorous, they will soon be induced to quit those shores, where
they meet such frequent disturbance and danger. The poor natives of
Greenland themselves, who used to feed upon <PB N="206" REF="212"/> the
whale, are diminishing, in proportion as their sustenance is removed;
and, it is probable; that the revolution of a few years will see that
extensive coast totally deserted by its inhabitants; as it is already
nearly deserted by the whales.</P>
<P>The art of taking whales, like most others, is much improved
by time, and differs in many respects from that practised by the
Biscayneers; when they first frequented the icy sea. But as the
description of their methods is the least complicated, and consequently
the easiest un∣derstood, it will be best suited to our purpose.</P>
<P>For this navigation, the Biscayneers, in fa∣vourable
seasons, fitted out thirty ships, of two hundred and fifty tons each,
with fifty choice men a-piece, and a few boys. These were stored with six
month's provision; and each ship had its boats, which were to be
serviceable when come to the place of duty. When arrived at the part where
the whales are expected to pass to the southward, they always keep their
fails set, and a sailor is placed at the mast head, to give information
when he spies a whale. As soon as he discovers one, the whole crew are
instantly in employment: they fit out their boats, and row away to where the
whale was seen. The harpooner, who is to strike the fish, stands at the
prow of the boat, with an harpoon <PB N="207" REF="213"/> or javelin in his
hand, five or six feet long, pointed with steel like the barb of an arrow,
of a triangular shape. As this person's place is that of the greatest
dexterity, so also it is of the greatest danger: the whale sometimes
over∣turns the boat with a blow of its tail, and sometimes drives against
it with fury. In ge∣neral, however, the animal seems to sleep on the
surface of the water; while the boat ap∣proaching, the harpooner stands
aloft, and, with his harpoon tied to a cord of several hun∣dred fathom
length, darts it into the animal, and then rows as fast as possible away.
It is for some time before the whale seems to feel the blow; the
instrument has usually pierced no deeper than the fat, and that being
insensible, the animal continues for a while motionless; but soon
rouzed from its seeming lethargy, as the shaft continues to pierce deeper
and deeper into the muscular flesh, it flies off with amazing rapidity. In
the mean time, the harpoon sticks in its side; while the rope, which is
coiled up in the boat, and runs upon a swivel, lengthens as the whale
recedes, but still shews the part of the deep to which it has retreated.
The cord is coiled up with great care; for such is the rapidity with which it
runs off, that if it was but the least checked, as it yields with the
animal's retreat, <PB N="208" REF="214"/> it would infallibly overset the
boat, and the crew would go to the bottom. It sometimes happens also, that
the rapidity with which it runs over the swivel at the edge of the boat,
heats it, and it would infallibly take fire, did not a man stand continually
with a wet mop in his hand, to cool the swivel as the cord runs. The whale
having dived to a considerable depth, remains at the bottom, sometimes for
near half an hour, with the harpoon in its body, and then rises to take
breath, expecting the danger over: but the instant it appears, they are all
with their boats ready to receive it, and fling their harpoons into its body:
the animal again dives and again rises, while they repeat their blows. The
ship follows in full sail, like all the rest, never losing sight of
the boats; and ready to lend them assistance; the whole ocean seems
dyed in blood. Thus they renew their attacks, till the whale begins to be quite
en∣feebled and spent, when they plunge their longer spears into various
parts of its body, and the enormous animal expires. When it is dead, to prevent
it from sinking, they tie it with a strong iron chain to the side of the
boat, and either cut it up in pieces, and carry it home in that manner, or
extract the oil from the blubber on ship-board.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="215"/>Such is the manner in which these
fish were taken in the beginning; but succeeding arts have improved the
method, and the harpoon is now thrown by; a machine being used which inflicts
a deeper wound, and strikes the ani∣mal with much greater certainty: there
are better methods for extracting the oil, and properer machines for cutting
the animal up, than were used in the early fisheries. But as an account of
this belongs to the history of art, and not of nature, we must be
con∣tented, with observing, that several parts of this animal, and all but
the intestines and the bones, are turned to very good account; not only the
oil, but the greaves from which it is separated. The barbs also were an
article of great profit; but have sunk in their price since women no longer
use them to swell out their petticoats with whale-bone. The flesh of this
animal is also a dainty to some nations; and even the French sea-men are
now and then found to dress and use it as their ordinary diet at sea. It
is said, by the English and Dutch sailors, to be hard and ill-tasted;
but the French assert the contrary; and the savages of Greenland, as well
as those near the south pole, are fond of it to distraction. They eat the
flesh, and drink the oil, which is a first rate delicacy. The find∣ing 
<PB N="210" REF="216"/> a dead whale is an adventure considered among the
fortunate circumstances of their wretched lives. They make their abode
beside it; and seldom remove till they have left no∣thing but the
bones.</P>
<P>Jacobson, whom we quoted before in the History of Birds,
where he describes his coun∣trymen of the island of Feroe as living a part
of the year upon salted gulls, tells us also, that they are very fond of
salted whale's flesh. The fat of the head they season with bay salt,
and then hang it up to dry in the chimney. He thinks it tastes as well as fat
bacon; and the lean, which they boil, is, in his opinion, not inferior to beef.
I fancy poor Jacobson would make but an indifferent taster at one of our
city feasts!</P>

<PB N="211" REF="217"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Narwhal.</HEAD>
<P>FROM whales that entirely want teeth, we come to such as
have them in the upper jaw only; and in this class there is found but one,
the Narwhal, or Sea-unicorn. This fish is not so large as the whale, not
being above sixty feet long. Its body is slenderer than that of the whale,
and its fat not in so great abundance. But this great animal is
suf∣ficiently distinguished from all others of the deep by its tooth or
teeth, which stand pointing directly forward from the upper jaw, and are from
nine to fourteen feet long. In all the va∣riety of weapons with which Nature
has armed her various tribes, there is not one so large or so formidable as
this. This terrible weapon is generally found single; and some are of
opinion that the animal is furnished but with one by nature; but there is at
present the skull of a narwhal at the Stadthouse at Amsterdam with two
teeth; which plainly proves that in some animals, at least, this
in∣strument is double. It is even a doubt whether it may not be so in all;
and that the narwhal's <PB N="212" REF="218"/> wanting a tooth is only an
accident which it has met with in the encounters it is obliged daily to be
engaged in. Yet it must be owned of these that are taken only with one
tooth, there seems no socket nor no remains of any other upon the
opposite side of the jaw, but all is plain and even. However this be, the
tooth, or, as some are pleased to call it, the horn of the narwhal is the
most terrible of all natural instruments of destruction. It is as
straight as an arrow, about the thickness of the small of a man's leg,
wreathed in the manner we some∣times see twisted bars of iron; it tapers
to a sharp point; and is whiter, heavier, and harder than ivory. It is
generally seen to spring from the left side of the head directly forward
in a straight line with the body; and its root enters into the socket above
a foot and an half. In a skull to be seen at Hamburgh there are two teeth,
which are each above seven feet long, and are eight inches in circumference.
When the animal possessed of these formidable weapons is urged to
employ them, it drives di∣rectly forward against the enemy with its teeth,
that, like portended spears, pierce whatever stands before them.</P>
<P>The extreme length of these instruments have induced
some to consider them rather as <PB N="213" REF="219"/> horns than teeth;
but they in every respect resemble the tusks of the boar and the
elephant. They grow, as in them, from sockets in the upper jaw; they have the
solidity of the hardest bone, and far surpass ivory in all its
qualities. The same error has led others to suppose, that as among
quadrupedes the female was often found without horns, so these
instruments of defence were only to be found in the male; but this has been
more than once refuted by actual experience; both sexes are found armed in
this manner; the horn is sometimes found wreathed and sometimes smooth;
sometimes a little bent and sometimes straight; but always strong,
deeply fixed, and sharply pointed.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding all these appointments for combat,
these long and pointed tusks, amazing strength, and unmatchable celerity,
the narwhal is one of the most harmless and peaceful inhabitants of the
ocean. It is seen constantly and inoffensively sporting among the other
great monsters of the deep, no way at∣tempting to injure them, but pleased
in their company The Greenlanders call the narwhal the fore-runner of the
whale; for wherever it is seen, the whale is shortly after sure to
follow. This may arise as well from the natural passion for society in
these animals as from both living <PB N="214" REF="220"/> upon the same
food, which are the insects de∣scribed in the preceding chapter. These
powerful fishes make war upon no other living crea∣ture; and, though
furnished with instruments to spread general destruction, are as
innocent and as peaceful as a drove of oxen. Nay, so re∣gardless are they
of their own weapons, and so utterly unmindful to keep them in repair for
engagement, that they are constantly seen co∣vered over with weeds,
slough, and all the filth of the sea; they seem rather considered as an
impediment than a defence.</P>
<P>The manners and appetites both of the nar∣whal and the great
whale are entirely similar; they both alike want teeth for chewing, and are
obliged to live upon insects; they both are peaceable and harmless, and
always rather fly than seek the combat. The narwhal, however, has a much
narrower gape than the great whale, and therefore does not want the use of
barbs to keep in its food when once sucked into the mouth. It is also much
swifter, and would never be taken by the fisherman but for those very
tusks, which at first appear to be its principal defence. These animals,
as was said, being fond of living to∣gether, are always seen in herds of
several at a time; and whenever they are attacked, they crowd together in
such a manner, that they are <PB N="215" REF="221"/> mutually embarassed
by their tusks. By these they are often locked together, and are pre∣vented
from sinking to the bottom. It seldom happens, therefore, but the
fishermen make sure of one or two of the hindmost, which very well reward
their trouble.</P>
<P>It is from the extraordinary circumstance of the teeth,
therefore, that this fish demands a distinct history; and such has been
the curiosity of mankind, and their desire to procure them, that a century
ago they were considered as the greatest rarity in the world. At that time
the art of catching whales was not known; and mankind saw few, except such
as were stranded on the coasts by accident. The tooth of the narwhal,
therefore, was ascribed to a very dif∣ferent animal from that which really
bore it. Among other fossil substances they were some∣times dug up;
and the narwhal being utterly unknown, naturalists soon found a
terrestrial owner. They were thought to be the horns of unicorns, an animal
described by Pliny as resembling an horse, and with one straight horn
darting forward from the middle of its forehead. These teeth were, therefore,
considered as a strong testimony in favour of that historian's
veracity, and were shewn among the most pre∣cious remains of antiquity.
Even for some <PB N="216" REF="222"/> time after the narwhal was known, the
deceit was continued, as those who were possessed of a tooth sold
it to great advantage. But at pre∣sent they are too well known to deceive
any, and are only shewn for what they really are; their curiosity
encreasing in proportion to their weight and their size.</P>

<PB N="217" REF="223"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Cachalot and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cachalot, which has generally gone under the name of the
Spermaceti Whale, till Mr. Penant very properly made the distinction, by
borrowing its name from the French, has se∣veral teeth in the under-jaw, but
none in the upper. As there are no less than seven di∣stinctions among
whales, so also there are the same number of distinctions in the tribe
we are describing. The cachalot with two fins and a black back; the cachalot
with two fins and a whitish back; that with a spout in the neck; that with
the spout in the snout; that with three fins and sharp pointed teeth;
that with three fins and sharp edged teeth; and lastly, the ca∣chalot with
three fins and flatted teeth.</P>
<P>This tribe is not of such enormous size as the whale,
properly so called, not being above sixty feet long and sixteen feet
high. In con∣sequence of their being more slender, they are much more
active than the common whale; they remain a longer time at the bottom; and
afford a smaller quantity of oil. As in the common whale the head was seen
to make a third part of its bulk, so in this species the 
<PB N="218" REF="224"/> head is so large as to make one half of the whole. The
tongue of this animal is small; but the throat is very formidable; and with
very great ease it could swallow an ox. In the stomach of the whale
scarce any thing is to be found; but in that of the cachalot there are loads
of fish of different kinds; some whole, some half digested, some
small, and others eight or nine feet long. The cachalot is there∣fore as
destructive among lesser fishes as the whale is harmless; and can at
one gulp swallow a shoal of fishes down its enormous gullet. Linnaeus
tells us that this fish pursues and ter∣rifies the dolphins and porpoises
so much, as often to drive them on shore.</P>
<P>But, how formidable soever this fish may be to its fellows
of the deep, it is by far the most valuable, and the most sought after by
man, as it contains two very precious drugs, spermaceti and amber-grease.
The use of these, either for the purposes of luxury or medicine, is so
uni∣versal, that the capture of this animal, that alone supplies them,
turns out to very great advan∣tage, particularly since the art has been found
out of converting all the oil of this animal, as well as the brain, into that
substance called spermaceti.</P>
<P>This substance, as it is naturally formed, is 
<PB N="219" REF="225"/> found in the head of the animal, and is no other than
the brain. The outward skin of the head being taken off, a covering of fat
offers about three inches thick; and under that, instead of a bony skull,
the animal has only another thick skin, that serves for a covering and
defence of the brain. The first cavity, or chamber, of the brain, is filled
with that spermaceti which is supposed of the greatest purity and
highest value. From this cavity there is generally drawn about seven
barrels of the clearest sper∣maceti, that thrown upon water coagulates like
cheese. Below this there is another chamber just over the gullet, which is
about seven feet high; and this also contains the drug, but of less
value. It is distributed in this cavity like honey in a hive, in small
cells, separated from each other by a membrane like the inner skin of an
egg. In proportion as the oily substance is drawn away from this part it
fills anew from every part of the body; and from this is ge∣nerally obtained
about nine barrels of oil. Be∣sides this, the spinal marrow, which is about
as thick as a man's thigh, and reaches all along the back-bone to the tail,
where it is not thicker than one's finger, affords no inconsiderable
quantity.</P>
<P>This substance, which is used in the compo∣sition 
<PB N="220" REF="226"/> of many medicines, rather to give them consistence
than efficacy, was at first sold at a very high price, both from the many
virtues ascribed to it and the small quantity that the cachalot was capable
of supplying; at present, the price is greatly fallen; first, because
its ef∣ficacy in medicine is found to be very small; and again because the
whole oil of the fish is very easily convertible into spermaceti. This is
performed by boiling it with a lea of pot-ash, and hardening it in the manner
of soap. Candles are now made of it, which are substituted for wax, and
sold much cheaper; so that we need not fear having our spermaceti
adulterated in the manner some medical books caution us to beware of; for
they carefully guard us against having our spermaceti adulterated with
virgin's wax.</P>
<P>As to the amber grease which is sometimes found in this
whale, it was long considered as a substance found floating on the
surface of the sea; but time, that reveals the secrets of the mercenary,
has discovered that it chiefly be∣longs to this animal. The name, which has
been improperly given to the former substance, seems more justly to
belong to this; for the amber grease is found in the place where the
seminal vessels are usually situated in other <PB N="221" REF="227"/>
animals. It is found in a bag of three or four feet long, in round lumps, from
one to twenty pounds weight, floating in a fluid rather thinner than oil, and
of a yellowish colour. There are never seen more than four at a time in one
of these bags; and that which weighed twenty pounds, and which was the
largest ever seen, was found single. These balls of amber grease are
not found in all fishes of this kind, but chiefly in the oldest and
strongest. The uses of this medicine for the purposes of luxury and as
a perfume are well known; though upon some subjects ignorance is preferable
to information.</P>

<PB N="222" REF="228"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Dolphin, the Grampus, and the Porpus, with
their Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>ALL these fish have teeth both in the upper and the lower
jaw, and are much less than the whale. The Grampus, which is the largest,
never exceeds twenty feet. It may also be di∣stinguished by the
flatness of its head, which resembles a boat turned upside down. The
porpus resembles the grampus in most things except the snout, which is
not above eight feet long; its snout also more resembles that of an hog.
The dolphin has a strong resemblance to the porpus, except that its snout
is longer and more pointed. They have all fins on the back; they all have heads
very large, like the rest of of the whale-kind; and resemble each other in
their appetites, their mannners, and conforma∣tions; being equally voracious,
active, and roving.</P>
<P>The great agility of these animals prevents their often
being taken. They seldom remain a moment above water; sometimes, indeed,
their too eager pursuits expose them to danger; and a shoal of herrings
often allures them out of <PB N="223" REF="229"/> their depth. In such a
case, the hungry animal continues to flounder in the shallows till knocked
on the head, or till the retiring tide seasonably comes to its relief. But
all this tribe, and the dolphin in particular, are not less swift than
destructive. No fish could escape them, but from the aukward position
of the mouth, which is placed in a manner under the head: yet, even with
these disadvantages, their depredations are so great, that they have been
justly stiled the plunderers of the deep.</P>
<P>What could induce the ancients to a predi∣lection in favour of
these animals, particularly the dolphin, it is not easy to account for.
Hi∣storians and philosophers seem to have con∣tended who should invent
the greatest number of fables concerning them. The dolphin was celebrated in
the earliest time for its fondness to the human race, and was
distinguished by the epithets of the boy-loving and philan∣thropist.
Scarce an accident could happen at sea but the dolphin offered himself to
convey the unfortunate to shore. The musician flung into the sea by
pirates, the boy taking an airing into the midst of the sea, and returning
again in safety, were obliged to the dolphin for its ser∣vices. It is not
easy, I say, to assign a cause why the ancients should thus have
invented so <PB N="224" REF="230"/> many fables in their favour. The figure of
these animals is far from prejudicing us in their interests; their extreme
rapacity tends still less to endear them: I know nothing that can
re∣concile them to man and excite his prejudices, except that when taken they
sometimes have a plaintiff moan, with which they continue to express their
pain till they expire. This, at first, might have excited human pity; and
that might have produced affection. At present, these fishes are regarded
even by the vulgar in a very different light; their appearance is far from
being esteemed a favourable omen by the sea-men; and from their boundings,
springs, and frolics in the water, experience has taught the mariners to
prepare for a storm.</P>
<P>But it is not to one circumstance only that the ancients
have confined their fabulous reports concerning these animals; as from their
leaps out of their element, they assume a temporary curvature, which is by
no means their natural figure in the water, the old painters and sculptors
have universally drawn them wrong. A dol∣phin is scarce ever exhibited by
the ancients in a straight shape, but curved, in the position which they
sometimes appear in when exerting their force; and the poets too have adopted
the general error. Even Pliny, the best natu∣ralist, <PB N="225" REF="231"/>
has asserted, that they instantly die when taken out of the water; but
Rondelet, on the contrary, assures us, that he has seen a dolphin carried
alive from Montpellier to Lyons.</P>
<P>The moderns have more just notions of these animals; and
have got over the many fables, which every day's experience contra∣dicts.
Indeed their numbers are so great, and, though shy, they are so often
taken, that such peculiarities, if they were possessed of any, would
have been long since ascertained. They are found, the porpess
especially, in such vast numbers, in all parts of the sea that
surrounds this kingdom, that they are sometimes noxious to seamen, when
they sail in small vessels. In some places they almost darken the
water as they rise to take breath, and particularly before bad weather are
much agitated, swimming against the wind, and tumbling about with
un∣usual violence.</P>
<P>Whether these motions be the gambols of pleasure, or the
agitations of terror, is not well known. It is most probable that they dread
those seasons of turbulence, when the lesser fishes shrink to the
bottom, and their prey no longer offers in sufficient abundance. In times of
fairer weather, they are seen herding together, and pursuing shoals of
various fish <PB N="226" REF="232"/> with great impetuosity. Their method of
hunting their game, if it may be so called, is to follow in a pack, and thus
give each other mutual assistance. At that season when the mackarel,
the herring, the salmon, and other fish of passage, begin to make their
ap∣pearance, the cetaceous tribes are seen fierce in the pursuit; urging
their prey from one creek or bay to another, deterring them from the
shallows, driving them towards each other's ambush, and using a greater
variety of arts than hounds are seen to exert in pursuing the hare.
However, the porpess not only seeks for prey near the surface, but often
descends to the bottom in search of sand-eels and sea∣worms, which it
roots out of the sand with its nose, in the manner hogs harrow up the
fields for food. For this purpose, the nose projects a little, is shorter
and stronger than that of the dolphin; and the neck is furnished with very
strong muscles, which enable it the readier to turn up the sand.</P>
<P>But it sometimes happens, that the impe∣tuosity, or the
hunger, of these animals, in their usual pursuits, urges them beyond the
limits of safety. The fishermen, who extend their long nets for pilchards,
on the coasts of Cornwall, have sometimes an unwelcome cap∣ture 
<PB N="227" REF="233"/> in one of these. Their feeble nets, which are
calculated only for taking smaller prey, suffer an universal laceration,
from the efforts of this strong animal to escape; and if it be not knocked
on the head, before it has had time to flounder, the nets are destroyed, and
the fishery interrupted. There is nothing, therefore, they so much dread,
as the entangling a por∣pess; and they do every thing to intimidate the
animal from approaching.</P>
<P>Indeed, these creatures are so violent in the pursuit of
their prey, that they sometimes follow a shoal of small fishes up a
fresh-water river, from whence they find no small difficulty to return. We
have often seen them taken in the Thames at London, both above the bridges
and below them. It is curious enough to observe with what activity they avoid
their pursuers, and what little time they require to fetch breath above the
water. The manner of killing them is for four or five boats to spread over
the part of the river in which they are seen, and with fire-arms to shoot
at them the instant they rise above the water. The fish being thus for
some time kept in agitation, requires to come to the surface at quicker
intervals, and thus affords the marksmen more frequent opportunities.</P>
<P>When the porpess is taken, it becomes no 
<PB N="228" REF="234"/> inconsiderable capture, as it yields a very large
quantity of oil; and the lean of some, particu∣larly if the animal be young,
is said to be as well tasted as veal. The inhabitants of Norway prepare
from the eggs found in the body of this fish, a kind of caviar, which is
said to be very delicate sauce, or good when even eaten with bread. There
is a fishery for porpess along the western isles of Scotland during the
summer season, when they abound on that shore; and this branch of
industry turns to good advantage.</P>
<P>As for the rest, we are told, that these ani∣mals go with
young ten months; that, like the whale, they seldom bring forth above one at
a time, and that in the midst of summer: that they live to a considerable
age; though some say not above twenty five or thirty years; and they
sleep with the snout above water. They seem to possess, in a degree
proportioned to their bulk, the manners of whales; and the history of one
species of cetaceous animals will, in a great measure, serve for all the
rest.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. OF CARTILAGINOUS FISHES.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="231" REF="236"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Cartilaginous Fishes in General.</HEAD>
<P>WE have seen that fishes of the cetaceous kind bear a
strong resemblance to quadrupedes in their conformation; those of the
cartilaginous kinds are one remove separated from them: they form the shade
that completes the imper∣ceptible gradations of nature.</P>
<P>The first great distinction they exhibit is, in having
cartilages or gristles instead of bones. The cetaceous tribes have their
bones entirely resembling those of quadrupedes, thick, white, and filled
with marrow: those of the spinous kind, on the contrary, have small
slender bones, with points resembling thorns, and generally solid
throughout. Fishes of the cartilaginous kinds have their bones always soft
and yielding; and age, that hardens the bones of other ani∣mals, rather
contributes still more to soften theirs. The size of all fishes
encreases with age; but from the pliancy of the bones in this tribe, they
seem to have no bounds placed to their dimensions: and it is supposed
that they grow larger every day till they die.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="237"/>They have other differences, more
obviously discernible. We have observed, that the ceta∣ceous tribes had
lungs like quadrupedes, an heart with its partition in the same manner, and
an apparatus for hearing; on the other hand we mentioned, that the spinous
kinds had no organs of hearing, no lungs to breathe through, and no partition
in the heart; but that their cold red blood was circulated by the means of the
impulse made upon their gills by the water. Cartilaginous fishes unite both
these systems in their conformation: like the cetaceous tribes, they have
organs of hearing, and lungs; like the spinous kinds, they have gills, and an
heart without a partition. Thus possessed of a two-fold power of
breathing, sometimes by means of their lungs, sometimes by that of their
gills, they seem to unite all the advantages of which their situation is
capable, and drawing from both elements, every aid to their necessities or
their enjoyments.</P>
<P>This double capacity of breathing in these animals, is one
of the most remarkable features in the history of nature. The apertures by
which they breathe, are somewhere placed about the head; either beneath, as
in flat fish; on the sides, as in sharks; or on the top of the head, as
in pipe-fish. To these apertures are the gills <PB N="233" REF="238"/>
affixed, but without any bone to open and shut them, as in spinous
fishes; from which, by this mark, they may be easily distinguished,
though otherwise very much alike in appearance. From these are bending
cylindrical ducts, that run to the lungs, and are supposed to convey the
air, that gives the organs their proper play. The heart, however, has but one
valve; so that their blood wants that double circulation which ob∣tains in
the cetaceous kinds; and the lungs seem to me rather as an internal
assistant to the gills, than fitted for supplying the same offices as
in quadrupedes, for they want the pulmonary vein and artery.</P>
<P>From this structure, however, the animal is enabled to live
a longer time out of water than those whose gills are more simple. The
carti∣laginous shark, or ray, live some hours after they are taken; while
the spinous herring or mackarel expire a few minutes after they are brought
on shore. From hence this tribe seems possessed of powers that
other fishes are wholly deprived of; they can remain continually under water,
without ever taking breath; while they can venture their heads above the deep,
and continue for hours out of their native element.</P>
<P>We observed, in a former chapter, that spi∣nous fishes
have not, or at least appear not to <PB N="234" REF="239"/> have, externally
any instruments of generation. It is very different with those of the
carti∣laginous kind, for the male always has these instruments double. The
fish of this tribe are not unfrequently seen to copulate; and their manner
is belly to belly, such as may naturally be expected from animals whose
parts of ge∣neration are placed forward. They in general chuse colder
seasons and situations than other fish for propagating their kind; and
many of them bring forth in the midst of winter.</P>
<P>The same duplicity of character which marks their general
conformation obtains also with re∣gard to their manner of bringing forth.
Some bring forth their young alive; and some bring forth eggs, which are
afterwards brought to maturity. In all, however, the manner of gestation is
nearly the same; for upon dissection, it is ever found, that the young,
while in the body, continue in the egg till a very little time before they are
excluded; these eggs they may properly be said to hatch within their body;
and as soon as their young quit the shell, they begin to quit the womb
also. Unlike to quadru∣pedes, or the cetaceous tribes, that quit the egg
state a few days after their first conception, and continue in the womb
several months after, these continue in the body of the female, in their
egg <PB N="235" REF="240"/> state, for weeks together; and the eggs are found
linked together by a membrane, from which, when the faetus gets free, it
continues but a very short time till it delivers itself from its
confinement in the womb. The eggs themselves consist of a white and a
yolk, and have a substance, instead of shell, that aptly may be
compared to softened horn. These, as I observed, are sometimes hatched
in the womb, as in the shark and ray kinds; and they are sometimes
excluded, as in the sturgeon, before the animal comes to its time of
disen∣gaging. Thus we see that there seems very little difference between
the viviparous and the oviparous kinds, in this class of fishes; the one
hatch their eggs in the womb, and the young continue no long time there; the
others exclude their eggs before hatching, and leave it to time and accident to
bring their young to maturity.</P>
<P>Such are the peculiar marks of the carti∣laginous class of
fishes, of which there are many kinds. To give a distinct description of
every fish is as little my intention, as perhaps it is the wish of the
reader; but the peculiarities of each kind deserve notice, and the most
striking of these it would be unpardonable to omit.</P>
<P>Cartilaginous fish may be divided first into 
<PB N="236" REF="241"/> those of the shark kind, with a body growing less
towards the tail, a rough skin, with the mouth placed far beneath the end of
the nose, five apertures on the sides of the neck for breathing, and the
upper part of the tail longer than the lower. This class chiefly comprehends
the Great White Shark, the Balance Fish, the Hound Fish, the Monk Fish,
the Dog Fish, the Basking Shark, the Zygaena, the Tope, the Cat Fish, the
Blue Shark, the Sea Fox, the Smooth Hound Fish, and the Porbeagle. These
are all of the same nature, and differ more in size, than in figure or
conformation.</P>
<P>The next division is that of flat fish; and these their
broad, flat, thin shape is sufficiently capable of distinguishing from
all others of this kind. They may be easily distinguished also from
spinous flat fish, by the holes through which they breathe, which are
uncovered by a bone; and which, in this kind, are five on each side. In this
tribe we may place the Torpedo, the Skate, the Sharp-nosed Ray, the Rough
Ray, the Thornback, and the Fire Flare.</P>
<P>The third division is that of the slender snake-shaped
kind: such as the Lamprey, the Pride, and the Pipe Fish.</P>
<P>The fourth division is of the Sturgeon and its variety, the
Ising-glass Fish.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="242"/>The last division may comprize
fish of dif∣ferent figures and natures, that do not rank under the former
divisions. These are the Sun Fish, the Tetrodon, the Lump Fish the Sea
Snail, the Chimaera and the Fishing Frog. Each of these has somewhat
peculiar in its powers or its form, that deserves to be re∣marked. The
description of the figures of these at least may compensate for our
general igno∣rance of the rest of their history.</P>

<PB N="238" REF="243"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Cartilaginous Fishes of the Shark
Kind.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the inhabitants of the deep, those of the shark
kind are the fiercest and the most voracious. The smallest of this
tribe is not less dreaded by greater fish, than many that to ap∣pearance
seem more powerful; nor do any of them seem fearful of attacking animals
far above their size: but the Great White Shark, which is the largest of
the kind, joins to the most amazing rapidity, the strongest appetites for
mischief: as he approaches nearly in size to the whale, he far
surpasses him in strength and celerity, in the formidable arrangement
of his teeth, and his insatiable desire of plunder.</P>
<P>The white shark is sometimes seen to rank even among
whales for magnitude; and is found from twenty to thirty feet long. Some
assert that they have seen them of four thousand pound weight; and we
are told particularly of one, that had a human corpse in his belly. The head
is large, and somewhat flatted; the snout long, and the eyes large. The
mouth is enormously wide; as is the throat, and capable of swallowing a man
with great ease. But its <PB N="239" REF="244"/> furniture of teeth is still
more terrible: of these there are six rows, extremely hard,
sharp-pointed, and of a wedge-like figure. It is as∣serted that there are
seventy-two in each jaw, which make one hundred and forty-four in the whole;
yet others think that their number is uncertain; and that, in proportion as the
ani∣mal grows older, these terrible instruments of destruction are found
to encrease. With these the jaws both above and below appear planted all
over; but the animal has a power of erecting or depressing them at
pleasure. When the shark is at rest, they lie quite flat in his mouth;
but when he prepares to seize his prey, he erects all this dreadful
apparatus, by the help of a set of muscles that join them to the jaw; and
the animal he seizes, dies pierced with an hundred wounds in a moment.</P>
<P>Nor is this fish less terrible to behold as to the rest
of his form: his fins are larger, in proportion; he is furnished with great
goggle eyes, that he turns with ease on every side, so as to see his
prey behind him as well as before; and his whole aspect is marked with a
character of malignity: his skin also is rough, hard and prickly; being
that sub∣stance which covers instrument cases, called shagreen.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="245"/>As the shark is thus formidable in his
ap∣pearance, so is he also dreadful, from his cou∣rage and activity. No
fish can swim so fast as he; none so constantly employed in
swimming, he outstrips the swiftest ships, plays round them, darts
out before them, returns, seems to gaze at the passengers, and all the
while does not seem to exhibit the smallest symptom of an effort to
proceed. Such amazing powers, with such great appetites for destruction,
would quickly unpeople even the ocean, but pro∣videntially the shark's upper
jaw projects so far above the lower, that he is obliged to turn on one side
(not on his back, as is generally supposed) to seize his prey. As this
takes some small time to perform, the animal pursued seizes that
opportunity to make its escape.</P>
<P>Still, however, the depredations he commits are frequent and
formidable. The shark is the dread of sailors in all hot climates; where,
like a greedy robber, he attends the ships, in ex∣pectation of what may drop
over board. A man who unfortunately falls into the sea at such a time, is
sure to perish, without mercy. A sailor that was bathing in the
Mediterranean, near Antibes, in the year 1744, while he was swimming about
fifty yards from the ship, <PB N="241" REF="246"/> perceived a monstrous
fish making towards him, and surveying him on every side, as fish are
often seen to look round a bait. The poor man, struck with terror at its
approach, cried out to his companions in the vessel to take him on board.
They accordingly threw him a rope with the utmost expedition, and were
drawing him up by the ship's side, when the shark darted after him from
the deep, and snapped off his leg.</P>
<P>Mr. Penant tells us, that the master of a Guinea-ship,
finding a rage for suicide prevail among his slaves, from a notion the
unhappy creatures had, that after death they should be restored again to
their families, friends and country; to convince them at least that some
disgrace should attend them here, he ordered one of their dead bodies to be
tied by the heels to a rope, and so let down into the sea; and though it
was drawn up again with great swift∣ness, yet, in that short space, the
sharks had bit off all but the feet. Whether this story is prior to an
accident of the same kind, which happened at Belfast, in Ireland, about
twenty years ago, I will not take upon me to determine; but certain it is,
there are some circumstances alike in both, though more terrible in that I
am going to relate. A Guinea captain was, <PB N="242" REF="247"/> by stress
of weather, driven into the harbour of Belfast, with a lading of very
sickly slaves, who, in the manner above-mentioned, took every opportunity
to throw themselves over board when brought up upon deck, as is usual, for
the benefit of the fresh air. The captain per∣ceiving, among others, a woman
slave attempt∣ing to drown herself, pitched upon her as a proper example to
the rest: as he supposed that they did not know the terrors attending
death, he ordered the woman to be tied with a rope under the arm-pits, and so
let her down into the water. When the poor creature was thus plunged in, and
about half way down, she was heard to give a terrible shriek, which at
first was ascribed to her fears of drowning; but soon after the water
appearing red all round her, she was drawn up, and it was found that a
shark, which had followed the ship, had bit her off from the middle.</P>
<P>Such is the frightful rapacity of this animal; nothing that
has life is rejected. But it seems to have a peculiar enmity to man: when
once it has tasted human flesh, it never desists from haunting those
places where it expects the re∣turn of its prey. It is even asserted, that
along the coasts of Africa, where these animals are found in great
abundance, numbers of the <PB N="243" REF="248"/> Negroes, who are obliged to
frequent the waters, are seized and devoured by them every year. The people
of these coasts are firmly of opinion, that the shark loves the black
man's flesh in preference to the white; and that when men of different
colours are in the water together, it always makes choice of the former.</P>
<P>However this be, men of all colours are equally afraid of this
animal, and have con∣trived different methods to destroy him. In general,
they derive their success from the shark's own rapacity. The usual
method of our sailors to take him, is by baiting a great hook with a piece of
beef or pork, which is thrown out into the sea by a strong cord,
strengthened near the hook with an iron chain. Without this precaution, the
shark would quickly bite the cord in two, and thus set him∣self free. It
is no unpleasant amusement to observe this voracious animal coming up to
survey the bait, particularly when not pressed by hunger. He approaches
it, examines it, swims round it, seems for a while to neglect it, perhaps
apprehensive of the cord and the chain: he quits it for a little; but his
appetite pressing, he returns again; appears preparing to devour it, but
quits it once more. When the sailors have sufficiently diverted
themselves with his <PB N="244" REF="249"/> different evolutions, they then
make a pretence, by drawing the rope, as if intending to take the bait away; it
is then that the glutton's hunger excites him; he darts at the bait, and
swallows it, hook and all. Sometimes, how∣ever, he does not so entirely
gorge the whole, but that he once more gets free; yet even then, though wounded
and bleeding with the hook, he will again pursue the bait until he is taken.
When he finds the hook lodged in his maw, his utmost efforts are then
excited, but in vain, to get free; he tries with his teeth to cut the chain; he
pulls with all his force to break the line; he almost seems to turn his
stomach inside out, to disgorge the hook: in this manner he continues his
formidable though fruitless efforts; till quite spent, he suffers his
head to be drawn above water, and the sailors, confining his tail by a nooze,
in this manner draw him on ship board, and dispatch him. This is done by
beating him on the head till he dies; yet even that is not ef∣fected without
difficulty and danger; the enor∣mous creature, terrible even in the agonies of
death, still struggles with his destroyers; nor is there an animal in the
world that is harder to be killed. Even when cut in pieces, the muscles
still preserve their motion, and vibrate for some minutes after being
separated from the body. <PB N="245" REF="250"/> Another method of taking him,
is by striking a barbed instrument, called a fizgig, into his body, as he
brushes along by the side of the ship. As soon as he is taken up, to
prevent his flouncing, they cut off the tail with an ax, with the utmost
expedition.</P>
<P>This is the manner in which Europeans de∣stroy the shark;
but some of the Negroes along the African coast, take a bolder and more
dan∣gerous method to combat their terrible enemy. Armed with nothing more than
a knife, the Negroe plunges into the water, where he sees the shark
watching for his prey, and boldly swims forward to meet him; though the great
animal does not come to provoke the combat, he does not avoid it, and suffers
the man to ap∣proach him; but just as he turns upon his side to seize the
aggressor, the Negroe watches the opportunity, plunges his knife in the
fish's belly, and pursues his blows with such success that he lays
the ravenous tyrant dead at the bottom: he soon however returns, fixes the
fish's head in a nooze, and drags him to shore, where he makes a noble
feast for the adjacent villages.</P>
<P>Nor is man alone the only enemy this fish has to fear: the
Remora, or Sucking Fish, is probably a still greater, and follows the
shark <PB N="246" REF="251"/> every where. This fish has got a power of
ad∣hering to whatever it sticks against, in the same manner as a
cupping-glass sticks to the human body. It is by such an apparatus that
this ani∣mal sticks to the shark, and drains away its moisture. The
seamen, however, are of opi∣nion, that it is seen to attend on the shark
for more friendly purposes, to point him to his prey, and to apprize him of
his danger. For this reason it has been called the Shark's Pilot.</P>
<P>The shark so much resembles the whale in size, that
some have injudiciously ranked it in the class of cetaceous fishes: but
its real rank is in the place here assigned it, among those of the
cartilaginous kind. It breathes with gills and lungs, its bones are gristly,
and it brings forth several living young; Belonius assures us, that he
saw a female shark produce eleven live young ones at a time. But I will not
take upon me to vouch for the veracity of Rondeletius, who, when talking of the
blue shark, says, that the female will permit her small brood, when in
danger, to swim down her mouth, and take shelter in her belly. Mr. Penant
indeed, seems to give credit to the story, and thinks that this fish,
like the Oppossum, may have a place fitted by Nature for the reception of
her young. To his opinion much deference is due, and is suf∣ficient, 
<PB N="247" REF="252"/> at least, to make us suspend our assent; for
nothing is so contemptible as that affectation of wisdom which some
display, by universal incredulity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, a shark, when living, is a very formidable
animal; and, when dead, is of very little value. The flesh is hardly
di∣gestible by any but the Negroes, who are fond of it to distraction; the
liver affords three or four quarts of oil; some imaginary virtues have been
ascribed to the brain; and its skin is, by great labour, polished into
that substance called shagreen. Mr. Penant is of opinion, that the female
is larger than the male in all this tribe; which would, if confirmed by
expe∣rience, make a striking agreement between them and birds of prey. It
were to be wished that succeeding historians would examine into this
observation, which is offered only as a con∣jecture!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Cartilaginous Flat-Fish, or the Ray
Kind.</HEAD>
<P>THE same rapacity which impels the shark along the
surface of the water, actuates the flat fish at the bottom. Less active
and less for∣midable, they creep in security along the bot∣tom, seize
every thing that comes in their way; neither the hardest shells nor the
sharpest spines give protection to the animals that bear them; their
insatiable hunger is such, that they devour all; and the force of their
stomach is so great, that it easily digests them.</P>
<P>The whole of this kind resemble each other very strongly
in their figure; nor is it easy without experience to distinguish one
from ano∣ther. The stranger to this dangerous tribe may imagine he is only
handling a skate when he is instantly struck numb by the torpedo; he may
suppose he has caught a thornback till he is stung by the fire-flare. It
will be proper, there∣fore, after describing the general figure of these
animals, to mark their differences.</P>
<P>All fish of the ray kind are broad, cartilagi∣nous,
swimming flat on the water, and having spines on different parts of their
body, or at <PB REF="254"/>

tail. They all have their eyes and mouth placed quite under the body, with
apertures for breathing either about or near them. They all have teeth, or a
rough bone, which answers the same purpose. Their bowels are very wide
towards the mouth, and go on diminishing to the tail. The tail is very
differently shaped from that of other fishes; and at first sight more
resembling that of a quadrupede, being narrow, and ending either in a bunch
or a point. But what they are chiefly distinguished by is their spines or
prickles, which the different species have on different parts of their body.
Some are armed with spines both above and below; others have them on the
upper part only; some have their spines at the tail; some have three rows
of them, and others but one. These prickles in some are comparatively
soft and feeble; those of others, strong and piercing. The smallest
of these spines are usually in∣clining towards the tail; the larger
towards the head.</P>
<P>It is by the spines that these animals are
distinguished from each other. The skate has the middle of the back
rough, and a single row of spines on the tail. The sharp nosed ray has
ten spines that are situated to∣wards the middle of the back. The rough ray
<PB N="250" REF="258"/> has its spines spread indiscriminately over the
the whole back. The thorn-back has its spines disposed in three rows upon
the back. The fire flare has but one spine, but that indeed a terrible one.
This dangerous weapon is placed on the tail, about four iches from the body,
and is not less than five inches long. It is of a flinty hardness, the
sides thin, sharp pointed, and closely and sharply bearded the whole
way. The last of this tribe that I shall mention is the torpedo; and this
animal has no spines that can wound; but in the place of them it is
possessed of one of the most potent and extraordinary fa∣culties in
nature.</P>
<P>Such are the principal differences that may enable us to
distinguish animals, some of which are of very great use to mankind,
from others that are terrible and noxious. With respect to their uses
indeed, as we shall soon see, they differ much; but the similitude
among them, as to their nature, appetites, and conformation, is perfect and
entire. They are all as voracious as they are plenty; and as dangerous to a
stranger as useful to him who can distinguish their differences.</P>
<P>Of all the larger fish of the sea, these are the most
numerous; and they owe their numbers to their size. Except the white shark
and cacha∣lot alone, there is no other fish that has a swallow 
<PB N="251" REF="259"/> large enough to take them in; and their spines make
them a still more dangerous morsel. Yet the size of some is such,
that even the shark himself is unable to devour them: we have seen some
of them in England weigh above two hundred pounds; but that is nothing to their
enormous bulk in other parts of the world. Labat tells us of a prodigious ray
that was speared by the Negroes at Guadaloupe, which was thirteen feet eight
inches broad, and above ten feet from the snout to the insertion of the
tail. The tail itself was in proportion, for it was no less than fifteen
feet long; twenty inches broad at its insertion, and tapering to a point. The
body was two feet in depth; the skin as thick as leather, and marked with
spots; which spots, in all of this kind, are only glands, that supply a
mucous to lubricate and soften the skin. This enormous fish was utterly
unfit to be eaten by the Europeans; but the Negroes chose out some of the
nicest bits, and carefully salted them up as a most favou∣rite
provision.</P>
<P>Yet, large as this may seem, it is very pro∣bable that we
have seen only the smallest of the kind; as they generally keep at the
bottom, the largest of the kind are seldom seen; and, as they may
probably have been growing for ages, the extent of their magnitude is un∣known.
<PB N="252" REF="260"/> It is generally supposed, however, that they are the
largest inhabitants of the deep; and, were we to credit the Norway Bishop,
there are some above a mile over. But to suppose an animal of such
magnitude is ab∣surd; yet the over-stretching the supposition does not
destroy the probability that animals of this tribe grow to an enormous
size.</P>
<P>The ray generally chuses for its retreat such parts of the
sea as have a black muddy bottom; the large ones keep at greater depths; but
the smaller approach the shores, and feed upon whatever living animals they
can surprize, or whatever putrid substances they meet with. As they are
ravenous, they easily take the bait, yet will not touch it if it be taken up
and kept a day or two out of water. Almost all fish ap∣pear much more
delicate with regard to a baited hook than their ordinary food. They appear by
their manner to perceive the line and to dread it; but the impulse of their
hunger is too great for their caution; and, even though they perceive the
danger, if thoroughly hungry, they devour the destruction.</P>
<P>These fish generate in March and April; at which time only
they are seen swimming near the surface of the water, several of the
males pursuing one female. They adhere so fast to∣gether 
<PB N="253" REF="261"/> in coition, that the fishermen frequently draw up both
together, though only one has been hooked. The females are prolific to an
extreme degree; there having been no less than three hundred eggs taken out
of the body of a single ray. These eggs are covered with a tough horny
substance, which they acquire in the womb; for before they descend into
that, they are attached to the ovary pretty much in the same manner as in the
body of a pullet. From this ovary, or egg-bag, as it is vulgarly called, the
fish's eggs drop one by one into the womb, and there receive a shell by the
concretion of the fluids of that organ. When come to the proper maturity, they
are excluded, but never above one or two at a time, and often at in∣tervals of
three or four hours. These eggs, or purses, as the fishermen call them,
are usually cast about the beginning of May, and they continue casting
during the whole summer. In October, when their breeding ceases, they are
exceedingly poor and thin; but in November they begin to improve, and grow
gradually better till May, when they are in the highest perfection.</P>
<P>It is chiefly during the winter season that our
fishermen take them; but the Dutch, who are indefatigable, begin their
operations earlier, <PB N="254" REF="262"/> and fish with better success
than we. The method practised by the fishermen of Scarbo∣rough is thought
to be the best among the En∣glish; and, as Mr. Penant has given a very
suc∣cinct account of it, I will take leave to present it to the reader.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline"> "When they go out to fish, each person is
provided with three lines: each man's lines are fairly coiled upon a flat
oblong piece of wicker work; the hooks being baited and placed very regularly
in the centre of the coil. Each line is furnished with two hundred and eighty
hooks, at the distance of six feet two inches from each other. The hooks
are fastened to lines of twisted horse-hair, twenty-seven inches in
length. 
<P> "When fishing, there are always three men in each coble;
and consequently nine of these lines are fastened together and used as
one line, extending in length near three miles, and furnished with above two
thousand five hundred hooks. An anchor and a buoy are fixed at the first
end of the line, and one more at each end of each man's lines: in all, four
anchors, and four buoys made of leather or cork. The line is always laid
across the current. The tides of flood and ebb continue an equal time upon
our coast; and, when <PB N="255" REF="263"/> undisturbed by winds, run each
way about six hours. They are so rapid that the fisher∣men can only
shoot and haul their lines at the turn of the tide; and therefore the lines
al∣ways remain upon the ground about six hours. The same rapidity of tide
prevents their using hand lines; and therefore two of the people commonly
wrap themselves in the sail and sleep, while the other keeps a strict
look-out, for fear of being run down by ships, and to observe the weather:
for storms often rise so suddenly, that it is sometimes with extreme
difficulty they escape to the shore, though they leave lines behind
them.</P> 
<P> "The coble is twenty feet six inches long, and five feet
extreme breadth. It is about one ton burthen, rowed with three pair of oars,
and admirably constructed for the pur∣pose of encountering a mountainous
sea. They hoist sail when the wind suits.</P> 
<P> "The five-men-boat is forty feet long, fifteen broad, and
twenty-five tons burthen. It is so called, though navigated by six men and
a boy; because one of the men is hired to cook, and does not share in the
profits with the other five. All our able fishermen go in these boats to
the herring-fishery at Yar∣mouth, the latter end of September, and 
<PB N="256" REF="264"/> return about the middle of November. The boats are then
laid up until the beginning of Lent, at which time they go off in them to the
edge of the Dogger, and other places, to fish for turbot, cod, ling,
skates, &amp;c. They always take two cobles on board, and when they come upon
their ground, anchor the boat, throw out the cobles, and fish in the same
manner as those do who go from the shore in a coble; with this difference
only, that here each man is provided with double the quantity of lines, and,
instead of waiting the return of the tide in the coble, return to the boat
and bait their other lines; thus hawling one set, and shooting another,
every turn of tide. They commonly run into the harbour twice a week, to deliver
their fish. The five-men-boat is decked at each end, but open in the middle,
and has two long sails.</P> 
<P> "The best bait for all kinds of fish, is fresh herring
cut in pieces of a proper size; and, notwithstanding what has been said
to the contrary, they are taken there at any time in the winter, and all the
spring, whenever the fishermen put down their nets for that pur∣pose: the
five-men boats always take some nets for that end. Next to herrings are the 
<PB N="257" REF="265"/> lesser lampreys, which come all winter by
land-carriage from Tadcaster. The next baits in esteem are small haddocks
cut in pieces, sand worms, muscles and limpets; and lastly, when none of
these can be found, they use bullock's liver. The hooks used there are
much smaller than those employed at Iceland and Newfoundland. Experience
has shewn that the larger fish will take a living small one upon the
hook, sooner than any bait that can be put on; therefore they use such as
the fish can swallow. The hooks are two inches and an half long in the
shank; and near an inch wide between the shank and the point. The line is
made of small cording, and is always tanned before it is used. All the rays
and turbots are extremely delicate in their choice of baits: if a piece of
herring or had∣dock has been twelve hours out of the sea, and then used as
a bait, they will not touch it."</P></Q> </P>
<P>Such is the manner of fishing for those fish that
usually keep near the bottom on the coasts of England; and Duhamel
observes, that the best weather for succeeding, is a half calm, when the
waves are just curled with a silent breeze.</P>
<P>But this extent of line, which runs, as we have seen, three
miles along the bottom, is <PB N="258" REF="266"/> nothing to what the Italians
throw out in the Mediterranean. Their fishing is carried on in a tartan,
which is a vessel much larger than our's; and they bait a line of no less
than twenty miles long, with above ten or twelve thousand hooks. This line is
called the pa∣rasina; and the fishing goes by that of the pielago. This
line is not regularly drawn every six hours, as with us, but remains for
some time in the sea; and it requires the space of twenty-four hours to
take it up in. By this apparatus they take rays, sharks, and other fish;
some of which are above a thousand pound weight. When they have caught any
of this magnitude, they strike them through with an harpoon to bring them on
board, and kill them as fast as they can.</P>
<P>This method of catching fish is obviously fatiguing and
dangerous; but the value of the capture generally repays the pain. The skate
and the thornback are very good food; and their size, which is from ten
pounds to two hundred weight, very well rewards the trouble of fishing for
them. But it sometimes happens that the lines are visited by very unwelcome
intruders; by the rough ray, the fireflare, or the torpedo. To all these the
fishermen have the most mortal antipathy; and, when discovered, 
<PB N="259" REF="267"/> shudder at the sight: however, they are not always
so much upon their guard, but that they sometimes feel the different
resentments of this angry tribe; and, instead of a prize, find they have
caught a vindictive enemy. When such is the case, they take care to throw
them back into the sea with the swiftest expedition.</P>
<P>The rough ray inflicts but slight wounds with the prickles
with which its whole body is fur∣nished. To the ignorant it seems
harmless, and a man would at first sight venture to take it in his hand,
without any apprehensions; but he soon finds, that there is not a single
part of its body that is not armed with spines; and that there is no way of
seizing the animal, but by the little fin at the end of the tail.</P>
<P>But this animal is harmless, when compared to the Fireflare,
which seems to be the dread of even the boldest and most experienced
fisher∣men. The weapon with which Nature has armed this animal, which grows
from the tail, and which we described as barbed and five inches long, hath
been an instrument of terror to the ancient fishermen as well as the
moderns: and they have delivered many tremendous fables of its astonishing
effects. Pliny, Aelian, and Oppian, have supplied it with a venom that
affects even the inanimate creation: trees that <PB N="260" REF="268"/> are
struck by it, instantly lose their verdure; and rocks themselves are
incapable of resisting the potent poison. The enchantress Circe armed
her son with a spear headed with the spine of the trygon, as the most
irresistible weapon she could furnish him with; a weapon that soon
after was to be the death of his own father.</P>
<P>That spears and darts, says Mr. Penant, might in very
early times have been headed with this bone instead of iron, we have no
doubt. The Americans head their arrows with the bones of fishes to this day;
and from their hardness and sharpness, they are no contemp∣tible weapons.
But that this spine is possessed of those venomous qualities
ascribed to it, we have every reason to doubt; though some men of high
reputation, and the whole body of fishermen, contend for its venomous
effects. It is, in fact, a weapon of offence belonging to this animal, and
capable, from its barbs, of in∣flicting a very terrible wound, attended with
dangerous symptoms; but it cannot be pos∣sessed of any poison, as
the spine has no sheath to preserve the supposed venom on its
surface; and the animal has no gland that separates the noxious fluid:
besides, all those animals that are furnished with envenomed fangs or
stings, seem to have them strongly connected with their safety and
existence; they never part with them; there <PB N="261" REF="269"/> is an
apparatus of poison prepared in the body to accompany their exertions; and
when the fangs or stings are taken away, the animal languishes and dies.
But it is otherwise with the spine of the fireflare; it is fixed to the
tail, as a quill is into the tail of a fowl, and is annually shed in the
same manner: it may be necessary for the creature's defence, but is no
way necessary for its existence. The wound inflicted by an ani∣mal's
tail, has something terrible in the idea, and may from thence alone be
supposed to be fatal. From hence terror might have added poison to the
pain, and called up imagined dan∣gers: the Negroes universally believe that
the sting is poisonous; but they never die of the wound; for, by opening
the fish, and laying it to the part injured, it effects a speedy cure. The
slightness of the remedy proves the innocence of the wound.</P>
<P>The Torpedo is an animal of this kind, equally formidable and
well known with the former; but the manner of its operating, is to this hour a
mystery to mankind. The body of this fish is almost circular, and thicker
than others of the ray kind; the skin is soft, smooth, and of a
yellowish colour, marked, as all the kind, with large annular spots; the
eyes very small; the tail tapering to a point; and the weight 
<PB N="262" REF="270"/> of the fish from a quarter to fifteen pounds. Redi
found one twenty-four pounds weight. To all outward appearance, it is
furnished with no extraordinary powers; it has no muscles formed for
particularly great exertions; no in∣ternal conformation perceptibly differing
from he rest of its kind: yet such is that unac∣countable power it
possesses, that, the instant it is touched, it numbs not only the
hand and arm, but sometimes also the whole body. The shock received, by
all accounts, most resembles the stroke of an electrical machine;
sudden, tingling, and painful. 
<Q REND="inline">"The instant," says Kempfer, "I touched it
with my hand, I felt a terrible numbness in my arm, and as far up as the
shoulder. Even if one treads upon it with the shoe on, it affects not only
the leg, but the whole thigh upwards. Those who touch it with the foot, are
seized with a stronger palpitation than even those who touched it with
the hand. This numbness bears no resemblance to that which we feel when a
nerve is a long time pressed, and the foot is said to be asleep; it
rather appears like a sudden vapour, which passing through the pores in
an instant, penetrates to the very springs of life, from whence it
diffuses itself over the whole body, and gives real pain. The nerves are
so affected, that the person <PB N="263" REF="271"/> struck imagines all
the bones of his body, and particularly those of the limb that re∣ceived the
blow, are driven out of joint. All this is accompanied with an universal
tremor, a sickness of the stomach, a general convul∣sion, and a total
suspension of the faculties of the mind. In short," continues Kempfer,
"such is the pain, that all the force of our promises and authority could
not prevail upon a sea man to undergo the shock a second time. A Negroe
indeed, that was standing by, rea∣dily undertook to touch the torpedo; and
was seen to handle it without feeling any of its effects. He informed us,
that his whole secret consisted in keeping in his breath; and we found,
upon trial, that this method answered with ourselves. When we held in our
breath, the torpedo was harmless; but when we breathed ever so little, its
efficacy took place."</Q></P>
<P>Kempfer has very well described the effects of this animal's
shock; but succeeding experience has abundantly convinced us, that holding
in the breath, no way guards against its violence. Those, therefore, who,
depending on that re∣ceipt, should play with a torpedo, would soon find
themselves painfully undeceived: not but that this fish may be many times
touched with per∣fect <PB N="264" REF="272"/> security; for it is not upon
every occasion that it exerts its potency. Reaumur, who made several trials
upon this animal, has at least convinced the world that it is not
neces∣sarily, but by an effort, that the torpedo numbs the hand of him that
touches it. He tried se∣veral times, and could easily tell when the fish
intended the stroke, and when it was about to continue harmless. Always
before the fish in∣tended the stroke, it flattened the back, raised the
head and the tail, and then, by a violent contraction in the opposite
direction, struck with its back against the pressing finger, and the
body, which before was flat, became humped and round.</P>
<P>But we must not infer, as he has done, that the whole effect
of this animal's exertions arise from the greatness of the blow which the
fingers receive at the instant they are struck. We will, with him, allow,
that the stroke is very powerful, equal to that of a musquet-ball, since
he will have it so; but it is very well known, that a blow, though never so
great on the points of the fingers, diffuses no numbness over the whole
body: such a blow might break the ends of the fingers indeed, but would
hardly numb the shoulder. Those blows that numb, must be applied
immediately to some <PB N="265" REF="273"/> great and leading nerves, or to a
large surface of the body; a powerful stroke applied to the points of the
fingers will be excessively painful indeed, but the numbness will not
reach beyond the fingers themselves. We must, therefore, look for another
cause producing the powerful effects wrought by the torpedo.</P>
<P>Others have ascribed it to a tremulous motion which this
animal is found to possess, some∣what resembling that of an horse's
skin, when stung by a fly. This operating under the touch with an amazing
quickness of vibration, they suppose produces the uneasy sensation
described above; something similar to what we feel when we rub plush
cloth against the grain. But the cause is quite disproportioned to the
effect; and so much beyond our experience, that this solution is as
difficult as the wonder we want to explain.</P>
<P>The most probable solution seems to be, that the shock
proceeds from an animal electricity, which this fish has some hidden power
of storing up, and producing on its most urgent occasions. The shocks
are entirely similar; the duration of the pain is the same: but how the
animal con∣trives to renew the charge, how it is prevented from evaporating it
on contiguous objects, how it is originally procured, these are difficulties
that time alone can elucidate.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="274"/>But to know even the effects is
wisdom. Certain it is that the powers of this animal seem to decline with
its vigour; for as its strength ceases, the force of the shock seems to
diminish; till, at last, when the fish is dead, the whole power is
destroyed, and it may be handled or eaten with perfect security: on the
contrary, when immediately taken out of the sea, its force is very great, and
not only affects the hand, but if even touched with a stick, the person
finds himself sometimes affected. This power, however, is not to be
extended to the degree that some would have us believe; as reaching the
fishermen at the end of the line, or numbing fishes in the same pond.
Godig∣nus, in his History of Abyssinia, carries this quality to a most
ridiculous excess: he tells us of one of these that was put into a basket
among a number of dead fishes, and that the next morning the people, to their
utter astonishment, perceived, that the torpedo had actually numbed the
dead fishes into life again.</P>
<P>To conclude, it is generally supposed that the female
torpedo is much more powerful than the male. Lorenzini, who has made seve∣ral
experiments upon this animal, seems con∣vinced that its power wholly
resides in two thin muscles that cover a part of the back. 
<PB N="267" REF="275"/> These he calls the trembling fibres; and he
asserts that the animal may be touched with safety in any other part. It
is now known also that there are more fish than this of the ray kind,
possessed of the numbing quality, which has acquired them the name of
the torpedo. These are described by Atkins and Moore, and found in great
abundance along the coast of Africa. They are shaped like a mackarel,
except that the head is much larger; the effects of these seem also to
differ in some respects. Moore talks of keeping his hand upon the animal;
which in the ray torpedo it is actually impossible to do. 
<Q REND="inline">"There was no man in the company," says he,
"that could bear to keep his hand on this animal the twentieth part of a
minute, it gave him so great pain; but upon taking the hand away, the
numbness went off, and all was well again. This numbing quality continued in
this torpedo even after it was dead; and the very skin was still
possessed of its extraordinary power till it became dry."</Q> Condamime
informs us of a fish possessed of the powers of the torpedo, of a
shape very different from the former, and every way resembling a lamprey.
This animal, if touched by the hand, or even with a stick, instantly
benumbs the hand and arm to the very shoulder; and some∣times 
<PB N="268" REF="276"/> the man falls down under the blow. These animals,
therefore, must affect the ner∣vous system in a different manner from the
former, both with respect to the manner and the intention; but how this
effect is wrought, we must be content to dismiss in obscurity.</P>

<PB N="269" REF="277"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Lamprey and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a species of the Lamprey served up as a great
delicacy among the modern Romans, very different from ours. Whether theirs be
the murena of the ancients I will not pretend to say; but there is nothing
more cer∣tain than that our lamprey is not. The Roman lamprey agrees with the
ancient fish in being kept in ponds, and considered by the luxurious as a
very great delicacy.</P>
<P>The lamprey known among us is differently estimated,
according to the season in which it is caught, or the place where it has
been fed. Those that leave the sea to deposit their spawn in fresh
waters are the best; those that are entirely bred in our rivers, and that
have never been at sea, are considered as much inferior to the former.
Those that are taken in the months of March, April, or May, just upon their
leav∣ing the sea, are reckoned very good; those that are caught after they
have cast their spawn, are found to be flabby and of little value. Those
caught in several of the rivers in Ireland the people will not venture to
touch; those <PB N="270" REF="278"/> of the English Severn are considered
as the most delicate of all other fish whatever.</P>
<P>The lamprey much resembles an eel in its general appearance,
but is of a lighter colour, and rather a clumsier make. It differs however in
the mouth, which is round, and placed rather obliquely below the end of the
nose. It more resembles the mouth of a leech than an eel; and the animal
has a hole on the top of the head through which it spouts water, as in the
ceta∣ceous kind. There are seven holes on each side for respiration; and
the sins are formed rather by a lengthening out of the skin, than any set
of bones or spines for that purpose. As the mouth is formed resembling
that of a leech, so it has a property resembling that animal of sticking
close to and sucking any body it is applied to. It is extraordinary the
power they have of ad∣hering to stones; which they do so firmly as not to
be drawn off without some difficulty. We are told of one that weighed but
three pound; and yet it stuck so firmly to a stone of twelve pounds, that
it remained suspended at its mouth, from which it was separated with no
small difficulty. This amazing power of suction is supposed to arise
from the animal's exhausting the air within its body by the hole over the
nose, while the mouth is closely fixed <PB N="271" REF="279"/> to the
object, and permits no air to enter. It would be easy to determine the weight
this animal is thus able to sustain; which will be equal to the weight of a
column of air of equal diameter with the fish's mouth.</P>
<P>From some peculiarity of formation, this animal swims
generally with its body as near as possible to the surface; and it might
easily be drowned by being kept by force for any time under water. Muralto
has given us the ana∣tomy of this animal; but, in a very minute description,
makes no mention of lungs. Yet I am very apt to suspect, that two red
glands tissued with nerves, which he describes as lying towards the back
of the head, are no other than the lungs of this animal. The absolute
necessity it is under of breathing in the air, convinces me that it must
have lungs, though I do not know of any anatomist that has de∣scribed
them.</P>
<P>The adhesive quality in the lamprey may be in some
measure encreased by that slimy sub∣stance with which its body is all
over smeared; a substance that serves at once to keep it warm in its
cold element, and also to keep its skin soft and pliant. This mucous is
separated by two long lymphatic canals, that extend on each side from the
head to the tail, and that furnish <PB N="272" REF="280"/> it in great
abundance. As to its intestines, it seems to have but one great bowel,
running from the mouth to the vent, narrow at both ends, and wide in the
middle.</P>
<P>So simple a conformation seems to imply an equal
simplicity of appetite. In fact, the lam∣prey's food is either slime and
water, or such small water-insects as are scarce perceivable. Perhaps
its appetite may be more active at sea, of which it is properly a native; but
when it comes up into our rivers, it is hardly perceived to devour any
thing.</P>
<P>Its usual time of leaving the sea, which it is annually
seen to do in order to spawn, is about the beginning of spring; and after
a stay of a few months it returns again to the sea. Their preparation for
spawning is peculiar; their manner is to make holes in the gravelly bottom of
rivers; and on this occasion their sucking power is particularly
serviceable; for if they meet with a stone of a considerable size, they
will remove it and throw it out. Their young are produced from eggs in the
manner of flat fish; the female remains near the place where they are
excluded, and continues with them till they come forth. She is sometimes
seen with her whole family playing about her; and after some time she
conducts them in triumph back to the ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="281"/>But some have not sufficient
strength to re∣turn; and these continue in the fresh water till they die.
Indeed, the life of this fish, according to Rondeletius, who has given its
history, is but of very short continuance; and a single brood is the
extent of the female's fertility. As soon as she has returned after
casting her eggs, she seems exhausted and flabby. She becomes old
before her time; and two years is generally the limit of her existence.</P>
<P>However this may be, they are very indif∣ferent eating after
they have cast their eggs, and particularly at the approach of hot weather.
The best season for them is the months of March, April, and May; and they
are usually taken in nets with salmon, and sometimes in baskets at the
bottom of the river. It has been an old custom for the city of Gloucester,
an∣nually to present the king with a lamprey-pye; and as the gift is made at
Christmass, it is not without great difficulty the corporation can procure
the proper quantity, though they give a guinea a piece for taking them.</P>
<P>How much they were valued among the an∣cients, or a fish
bearing some resemblance to them, appears from all the classics that
have praised good living or ridiculed gluttony. One story we are told of
this fish with which I will <PB N="274" REF="282"/> conclude its history. A
senator of Rome, whose name does not deserve being transmitted to
po∣sterity, was famous for the delicacy of his lam∣preys. Tigelinus,
Manucius, and all the cele∣brated epicures of Rome, were loud in his praises:
no man's fish had such a flavour, was so nicely fed, or so exactly
pickled. Augustus, hearing so much of this man's entertainments, desired
to be his guest; and soon found that fame had been just to his merits;
the man had indeed very fine lampreys, and of an exquisite flavour. The
emperor was desirous of knowing the method by which he fed his fish to so
fine a relish; and the glutton, making no secret of his art, informed him
that his way was to throw into his ponds such of his slaves as had at any
time displeased him. Augustus, we are told, was not much pleased with
his receipt; and in∣stantly ordered all his ponds to be filled up. The
story would have ended better if he had ordered the owner to be flung in
also.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="284"/> THE Sturgeon, with a form as terrible
and a body as large as the shark, is yet as harmless as the fish we have
been just describing; in∣capable and unwilling to injure others, it flies
from the smallest fishes, and generally falls a victim to its own
timidity.</P>
<P>The sturgeon in its general form resembles a fresh-water
pike. The nose is long; the mouth is situated beneath, being small, and
without jaw-bones or teeth. But, though it is so harm∣less and ill provided
for war, the body is for∣midable enough to appearance. It is long, pentagonal,
and covered with five rows of large bony knobs, one row on the back and two on
each side, and a number of fins to give it greater expedition. Of this fish
there are three kinds; the Common Sturgeon, the Caviar Sturgeon, and the Huso
or Isinglass fish. The first has eleven knobs or scales on the back;
the second has fifteen; and the latter thirteen on the back and forty-three
on the tail. These dif∣ferences seem slight to us who only consider the
animal's form; but those who consider its uses <PB N="276" REF="285"/>
find the distinction of considerable importance. The first is the
sturgeon, the flesh of which is sent pickled into all parts of Europe.
The second is the fish from the roe of which that noted delicacy called
caviar is made; and the third, besides supplying the caviar, furnishes
also the valuable commodity of isinglass. They all grow to a very great
size; and some of them have been found above eighteen feet long.</P>
<P>There is not a country in Europe but what this fish visits
at different seasons; it annually ascends the largest rivers to
spawn, and pro∣pagates in an amazing number. The inhabitants along the banks
of the Po, the Danube, and the Walga, make great profit yearly of its
incur∣sions up the stream, and have their nets pre∣pared for its reception.
The sturgeon also is brought daily to the markets of Rome and Ve∣nice, and
they are known to abound in the Me∣diterranean sea. Yet those fish that
keep entirely either in salt or fresh water are but compara∣tively small.
When the sturgeon enjoys the vicissitude of fresh and salt water, it
is then that it grows to an enormous size, so as almost to rival even the
whale in magnitude.</P>
<P>Nor are we without frequent visits from this much esteemed
fish in England. It is often ac∣cidentally taken in our rivers in
salmon-nets, <PB N="267" REF="286"/> particularly in those parts that are
not far re∣mote from the sea. The largest we have heard of caught in
Great-Britain was a fish taken in the Eske, where they are most
frequently found, which weighed four hundred and sixty pounds. An enormous
size to those who have only seen our fresh-water fishes!</P>
<P>North-America also furnishes the sturgeon; their rivers
in May, June, and July, supply them in very great abundance. At that time
they are seen sporting in the water, and leap∣ing from its surface
several yards into the air. When they fall again on their sides, the
concussion is so violent, that the noise is heard in still weather at
some miles distance.</P>
<P>But of all places where this animal is to be found, it appears
no where in such numbers as in the Lakes of Frischehaff and Curischaff,
near the city of Pillau. In the rivers also that empty themselves into the
Euxine Sea this fish is caught in great numbers, particularly at the mouth of
the river Don. In all these places the fishermen regularly expect their
arrival from the sea, and have their nets and salt ready prepared for their
reception.</P>
<P>As the sturgeon is an harmless fish and no way
voracious, it is never caught by a bait in the ordinary manner of fishing,
but always in <PB N="278" REF="287"/> nets. From the description given above
of its mouth, it is not to be supposed that the stur∣geon would swallow
any hook capable of holding so large a bulk and so strong a swimmer. In
fact, it never attempts to seize any of the finny tribe, but lives by rooting
at the bottom of the sea, where it makes insects and sea-plants its whole
subsistence. From this quality of floun∣dering at the bottom it has
received its name; which comes from the German verb <HI>stoeren,</HI>
sig∣nifying to wallow in the mud. That it lives upon no large animals is
obvious to all those who cut it open, where nothing is found in its stomach
but a kind of slimy substance, which has induced some to think it lives
only upon water and air. From hence there is a German proverb, which is applied
to a man extremely temperate, when they say he is as moderate as a
sturgeon.</P>
<P>As the sturgeon is so temperate in its appe∣tites, so is
it also equally timid in its nature. There would be scarce any method of
taking it did not its natural desire of propagation induce it to incur so
great a variety of dangers. The smallest fish is alone sufficient to
terrify a shoal of sturgeons; for, being unfurnished with any weapon of
de∣fence, they are obliged to trust to their swiftness and their caution
for security. Like all animals <PB N="279" REF="288"/> that do not make war
upon others, sturgeons live in society among themselves; rather for the
purposes of pleasure, than from any power of mutual protection. Gesner
even asserts, that they are delighted with sounds of various kinds; and
that he has seen them shoal together, at the notes of a trumpet.</P>
<P>The usual time, as was said before, for the sturgeon to
come up rivers to deposit its spawn, is about the beginning of summer,
when the fishermen of all great rivers make a regular preparation for its
reception. At Pillau par∣ticularly the shores are formed into districts,
and allotted to companies of fishermen, some of which are rented for about
three hundred pounds a year. The nets in which the sturgeon are caught, are
made of small cord, and placed across the mouth of the river; but in such
a manner that, whether the tide ebbs or flows, the pouch of the net goes with
the stream. The sturgeon thus caught, while in the water, is one of the
strongest fishes that swims, and often breaks the net to pieces that
encloses it; but the instant it is raised with its head above water, all
its activity ceases: it is then a lifeless, spirit∣less lump, and
fuffers itself to be tamely drag∣ged on shore. It has been found prudent,
however, to draw it to shore gently; for, if <PB N="280" REF="289"/> excited
by any unnecessary violence, it has been found to break the fishermen's
legs with a blow of its tail. The most experienced fishers, therefore, when
they have drawn it to the brink, keep the head still elevated, which prevents
its doing any mischief with the hinder part of the body: others, by a nooze,
fasten the head and the tail together; and thus, without immediately
dispatching it, bring it to the market, if there be one near; or keep it till
their number is com∣pleted for exportation.</P>
<P>The flesh of this animal pickled is very well known at all
the tables of Europe; and is even more prized in England, than in any of the
countries where it is usually caught. The fish∣ermen have two different
methods of preparing it. The one is by cutting it in long pieces lengthwise,
and having salted them, by hang∣ing them up in the sun to dry: the fish
thus prepared is sold in all the countries of the Levant, and supplies the
want of better pro∣vision. The other method, which is usually practised
in Holland, and along the shores of the Baltic, is to cut the sturgeon
crosswise into short pieces, and put it into small barrels, with a
pickle made of salt and saumure. This is the sturgeon which is sold in
England; and of which great quantities came from the north, 
<PB N="281" REF="290"/> until we gave encouragement to the importa∣tion of it
from North America. From thence we are very well supplied; but it is said,
not with such good fish as those imported from the north of Europe.</P>
<P>A very great trade is also carried on with the roe of the
sturgeon, preserved in a particular manner, and called Caviar: it is made
from the roe of all kinds of sturgeon, but particu∣larly the second. This
is much more in request in other countries of Europe than with us. To all
these high relished meats, the appetite must be formed by degrees; and
though formerly even in England it was very much in request at the politest
tables, it is at present sunk entirely into difuse. It is still,
however, a considerable merchandize among the Turks, Greeks, and Venetians.
Caviar somewhat resembles soft soap in consistence; but it is of a
brown, uni∣form colour, and is eaten as cheese with bread. The manner of
making it is this: they take the spawn from the body of the
sturgeon—for it is to be observed that the sturgeon differs from
other cartilaginous fish, in that it has spawn like a cod, and not eggs
like a ray.—They take the spawn, I say, and freeing it from the
small membranes that connect it together, they wash it with vinegar, and
afterwards spread it <PB N="282" REF="291"/> to dry upon a table; they then
put it into a vessel with salt, breaking the spawn with their hands,
and not with a pestle; this done, they put it into a canvas bag, letting the
liquor drain from it; lastly, they put it in a tub, with holes in the bottom,
so that, if there be any moisture still remaining, it may run out: then
it is pressed down, and covered up close for use.</P>
<P>But the Huso or Isinglass Fish furnishes a still
more valuable commodity. This fish is caught in great quantities in the
Danube, from the months of October to January: it is seldom under fifty
pounds weight, and often above four hundred: its flesh is soft, glutinous
and flabby; but it is sometimes salted, which makes it better tasted, and
then it turns red like sal∣mon. It is for the commodity it furnishes that
it is chiefly taken. Isinglass is of a whitish sub∣stance, enclining
to yellow, done up into rolls, and so exported for use. It is very well
known as serviceable not only in medicine, but many arts. The varnisher,
the wine-merchant, and even the clothier know its uses; and very great sums
are yearly expended upon this single ar∣ticle of commerce. The manner of
making it is this: they take the skin, the entrails, the fins and the tail of
this fish, and cut them into small pieces; these are left to macerate in
a sufficient <PB N="283" REF="292"/> quantity of warm water, and they are all
boiled shortly after with a slow fire, until they are dis∣solved and
reduced to a jelly; this jelly is spread upon instruments made for the
purpose, so, that drying, it assumes the form of parchment, and, when
quite dry, it is then rolled into the form which we see it in the
shops.</P>
<P>This valuable commodity is principally fur∣nished from
Russia, where they prepare great quantities surprizingly cheap. Mr.
Jackson, an ingenious countryman of our own, found out an obvious method of
making a glue at home that answered all the purposes of isinglass; but
what with the trouble of making it, and perhaps the arts put in practice to
undersell him, he was, as I am told, obliged to discontinue the improvement
of his discovery. Indeed, it is a vain attempt to manufacture among
ourselves those things which may be more naturally and cheaply supplied
elsewhere. We have many traders that are unnaturally, if I may so express
it, employed among us; who furnish more la∣boriously those
necessaries with which other countries could easily and cheaply supply
us. It would be wiser to take what they can thus produce; and to turn our
artizans to the encrease and manufacture of such productions as thrive more
readily among us. Were, for instance, <PB N="284" REF="293"/> the number of
hands that we have now em∣ployed in the manufacture of silk, turned to the
encrease of agriculture, it is probable that the encreased quantity of corn
thus produced, would be more than an equivalent for the di∣minution of national
wealth in purchasing wrought silk from other countries.</P>

<P><PB N="285" REF="295"/>OF all others, the cartilaginous class
seems to abound with the greatest variety of ill-formed animals; and, if
philosophy could allow the ex∣pression, we might say, that the
cartilaginous class was the class of monsters: in fact, it ex∣hibits a
variety of shapeless beings, the devi∣ations of which from the usual form
of fishes are beyond the power of words to describe, and scarcely of the
pencil to draw. In this class we have the Pipe Fish, that almost tapers
to a thread, and the Sun Fish, that has the appear∣ance of a bulky head, but
the body cut off in the middle; the Hippocampus, with an head somewhat like
that of an horse, and the Water Bat, whose head can scarcely be
distinguished from the body. In this class we find the Fishing Frog,
which from its deformity some have called the Sea Devil, the Chimaera, the
Lump Fish, the Sea Porcupine, and the Sea Snail. Of all these the history
is but little known; and naturalists supply the place with
description.</P>
<P>The Sun Fish sometimes grows to a very 
<PB N="286" REF="296"/> large size; one taken near Plymouth was five hundred
weight. In form it resembles a bream, or some deep fish cut off in the
middle: the mouth is very small, and contains in each jaw two broad teeth,
with sharp edges: the colour of the back is dusky and dappled, and the
belly is of a silvery white. When boiled, it has been observed to turn to a
glutinous jelly, and would most probably serve for all the purposes of
isinglass, were it found in sufficient plenty.</P>
<P>The Fishing Frog in shape very much re∣sembles a tadpole
or young frog, but then a tadpole of enormous size, for it grows to above
five feet long, and its mouth is sometimes a yard wide. Nothing can exceed
its deformity. The head is much bigger than the whole body; the under jaw
projects beyond the upper, and both are armed with rows of slender, sharp
teeth: the palate and the tongue are furnished with teeth in like manner; the
eyes are placed on the top of the head, and are encompassed with prickles:
immediately above the nose are two long beards or filaments, small in the
beginning, but thicker at the end, and round: these, as it is said,
answer a very singular purpose; for being made somewhat resembling a
fishing-line, it is asserted, that the animal converts them to the
purposes of fishing. With these extended, as <PB N="287" REF="297"/> Pliny
asserts, the fishing frog hides in muddy waters, and leaves nothing but
the beards to be seen; the curiosity of the smaller fish bring them to
view these filaments, and their hunger induces them to seize the bait; upon
which the animal in ambush instantly draws in its filaments with the little
fish that had taken the bait, and devours it without mercy. This story,
though apparently improbable, has found credit among some of our best
naturalists; but what induces me to doubt the fact is, that there is another
species of this animal that has no beards, which it would not want if they
were necessary to the existence of the kind. Rondeletius informs us, that
if we take out the bowels, the body will appear with a kind of transparence;
and that if a lighted candle be placed within the body, as in a lanthorn, the
whole has a very formidable ap∣pearance. The fishermen, however, have in
general a great regard for this ugly fish, as it is an enemy to the dog
fish, the bodies of those fierce and voracious animals being often found in
its stomach: whenever they take it, therefore, they always set it at
liberty.</P>
<P>The Lump Fish is trifling in size, compared to the former:
its length is but sixteen inches, and its weight about four pounds; the
shape of the body is like that of a bream, deep, and it <PB N="288" REF="298"/> swims edgeways; the back is sharp and ele∣vated, and the belly
flat; the lips, mouth and tongue of this animal are of a deep red; the whole
skin is rough, with bony knobs, the largest row is along the ridge of the
back; the belly is of a bright crimson colour: but what makes the chief
singularity in this fish, is an oval aperture in the belly, surrounded
with a fleshy, soft substance, that seems bearded all round; by means
of this part it adheres with vast force to any thing it pleases. If flung
into a pail of water, it will stick so close to the bottom, that on
taking the fish by the tail, one may lift up pail and all, though it holds
several gallons of water. Great numbers of these fish are found along the
coasts of Greenland in the beginning of summer, where they resort to
spawn. Their roe is remarkably large, and the Greenlanders boil it to a pulp
for eating. They are ex∣tremely fat, but not admired in England, being both
flabby and insipid.</P>
<P>The Sea Snail takes its name from the soft and unctuous
texture of its body, resembling the snail upon land. It is almost
transparent, and soon dissolves and melts away. It is but a little
animal, being not above five inches long. The colour, when fresh taken, is of
a pale brown, the shape of the body round, and the <PB N="289" REF="299"/>
back fin reaches all the way from the head to the tail. Beneath the throat is a
round de∣pression, of a whitish colour, surrounded by twelve brown
spots, placed in a circle. It is taken in England at the mouths of rivers,
four or five miles distant from the sea.</P>
<P>The body of the Pipe Fish, in the thickest part, is not
thicker than a swan-quill, while it is above sixteen inches long. This is
angular, but the angles being not very sharp, they are not discernable
until the fish is dried. Its ge∣neral colour is an olive brown, marked with
numbers of bluish lines, pointing from the back to the belly. It is
viviparous; for, on crushing one that was just taken, hundreds of very
mi∣nute young ones were observed to crawl about.</P>
<P>The Hippocampus, which from the form of its head some call
the Sea Horse, never exceeds nine inches in length. It is about as thick as a
man's thumb, and the body is said, while alive, to have hair on the fore
part, which falls off when it is dead. The snout is a sort of a tube with a
hole at the bottom, to which there is a cover, which the animal can open and
shut at pleasure. Behind the eyes there are two fins, which look like ears;
and above them are two holes, which serve for respiration. The whole body
seems to be composed of cartilagi∣nous <PB N="290" REF="300"/> rings, on the
intermediate membranes of which several small prickles are placed. It is
found in the Mediterranean, and also in the Western Ocean; and, upon the
whole, more resembles a great caterpillar than a fish. The antients
considered it as extremely venomous; probably induced by its peculiar
figure.</P>
<P>From these harmless animals, covered with a slight coat
of mail, we may proceed to others, more thickly defended, and more formidably
armed, whose exact station in the scale of fishes is not yet
ascertained. While Linnaeus ranks them among the Cartilaginous kinds, a later
naturalist places them among the Spinous class. With which tribe they
most agree, succeeding observations must determine. At present, we
seem better acquainted with their figure than their history: their
deformity is obvious; and the venemous nature of the greatest number, has
been confirmed by fatal experience. This circumstance, as well as the happy
distance at which they are placed from us, being all found in the Oriental or
American seas, may have prevented a more critical enquiry; so that we know
but little of the nature of their malig∣nity, and still less of their
pursuits and enmities in the deep.</P>
<P>In the first of this tribe we may place the <PB REF="301"/>

<BYLINE>E. Martin sculp.</BYLINE>
</FIGURE> <PB N="291" REF="302"/> Sea Orb, which is almost
round, has a mouth like a frog, and is from seven inches to two feet long.
Like the porcupine, from whence it sometimes takes its name, being also
called the Sea Porcupine, it is covered over with long thorns or prickles,
which point on every side; and, when the animal is enraged, it can blow up
its body as round as a bladder. Of this ex∣traordinary creature there are many
kinds: some threatening only with spines, as the Sea Hedge-hog; others
defended with a bony hel∣met that covers the head, as the Ostracion; others
with a coat of mail from the head to the tail, where it terminates in a point,
as the Cen∣triscus; and others still armed offensively and defensively
with bones and spines, as the Shield Orb.</P>
<P>Of these scarce one is without its peculiar weapon of
offence. The centriscus wounds with its spine; the ostracion poisons
with its venom; the orb is impregnable, and is ab∣solutely poisonous, if
eaten. Indeed, their figure is not such as would tempt one to make the
experiment; and the natives of those coun∣tries where they are sound, are
careful to inform foreigners of their danger: yet a certain sailor at the
Cape of Good Hope, not believing what the Dutch told him concerning their
venom, <PB N="292" REF="303"/> was resolved to make the experiment, and break
through a prejudice which he supposed was founded on the animal's
deformity. He tried and eat one; but his rashness cost him his life; he
instantly fell sick, and died a few days after.</P>
<P>These frightful animals are of different sizes; some not
bigger than a foot-ball, and others as large as a bushel. They almost all
flatten and erect their spines at pleasure, and encrease the terrors of
their appearance in proportion to the approach of danger. At first they
seem more inoffensive; their body oblong, with all their weapons pointing
towards the tail; but upon being provoked or alarmed, the body that before
seemed small swells to the view; the animal visibly grows rounder and
larger, and all its prickles stand upright, and threaten the invader on every
side. The Americans often amuse themselves with the barren pleasure of
catching these frightful creatures by a line and hook baited with a piece of
sea-crab. The animal approaches the bait with its spines flat∣tened; but
when hooked and stopped by the line, straight all its spines are erected;
the whole body being armed in such a manner at all points, that it is
impossible to lay hold of it on any part. For this reason it is dragged
to some distance from the water, and there it quickly <PB N="293" REF="304"/> expires. In the middle of the belly of all these there is a sort
of bag or bladder filled with air, and by the inflation of which the animal
swells itself in the manner already mentioned.</P>
<P>In describing the deformed animals of this class, one is
sometimes at a loss whether it be a fish or an insect that lies before
him. Thus the hippocampus and the pipe-fish bear a strong resemblance to
the caterpillar and the worm; while the lesser orb bears some likeness
to the class of sea-eggs to be described after. I will conclude this
account of cartilaginous fishes with the de∣scription of an animal which I
would scarcely call a fish, but that Father Labat dignifies it with the
name. Indeed, this class teems with such a number of odd shaped animals,
that one is prompted to rank every thing extraordinary of the finny species
among the number; but be∣sides, Labat says its bones are cartilaginous, and
that may entitle it to a place here.</P>
<P>The animal I mean is the Galley Fish, which Linnaeus
degrades into the insect tribe, under the title of the Medusa, but which I
chuse to place in this tribe, from its habits that are some∣what similar.
To the eye of an unmindful spectator, this fish seems a transparent
bubble swimming on the surface of the sea, or like a bladder variously
and beautifully painted with <PB N="294" REF="305"/> vivid colours, where red
and violet predominate as variously opposed to the beams of the sun. It
is however an actual fish; the body of which is composed of cartilages, and
a very thin skin filled with air, which thus keeps the animal floating on the
surface as the waves and the winds happen to drive. Sometimes it is seen
thrown on the shore by one wave, and again washed back into the sea by
another. Persons who happen to be walking along the shore often happen to
tread upon these animals; and the bursting of their body yields a report
like that when one treads upon the swim of a fish. It has eight broad feet
with which it swims, or which it expands to catch the air as with a sail.
It fastens itself to whatever it meets by means of its legs, which have an
adhesive quality. Whether they move when on shore Labat could never
per∣ceive, though he did every thing to make them stir; he only saw that it
strongly adhered to whatever substances he applied it. It is very common
in America, and grows to the size of a goose egg, or somewhat more. It is
perpe∣tually seen floating; and no efforts that are used to hurt it can
sink it to the bottom. All that appears above water is a bladder clear and
transparent as glass, and shining with the most beautiful colours of
the rainbow. Beneath, in <PB N="295" REF="306"/> the water, are four of the feet
already men∣tioned that serve as oars, while the other four are expanded
above to sail with. But what is most remarkable in this extraordinary
creature is the violent pungency of the slimy substance with which its
legs are smeared. If the smallest quantity but touch the skin, so
caustic is its quality, that it burns it like hot oil dropped on the part
affected. The pain is worst in the heat of the day, but ceases in the cool
of the evening. It is from feeding on these that he thinks the poisonous
quality contracted by some West-Indian fish may be accounted for. It is
certain these animals are extremely common along all the coasts in the Gulf
of Mexico; and whenever the shore is covered with them in an unusual
manner, it is considered as a certain fore-runner of a storm.</P>

<PB N="300" REF="308"/>former are trifling in comparison, and make not above a
fifth part of the finny creation.</P>
<P>From the great variety in this class, it is ob∣vious how
difficult a task it must have been to describe or remember even a part of
what it contains. When six hundred different sorts of animals offer
themselves to consideration, the mind is bewildered in the multiplicity of
objects that all lay some claim to its attention. To obviate this
confusion, systems have been de∣vised, which, throwing several
fishes that agree in many particulars into one groupe, and thus uniting all
into so many particular bodies, the mind that was incapable of separately
con∣sidering each, is enabled to comprehend all when thus offered in larger
masses to its con∣sideration.</P>
<P>Indeed, of all the beings in animated nature, fishes
most demand a systematical arrangement. Quadrupedes are but few, and can
be all known; birds, from their seldom varying in their size, can be very
tolerably distinguished without system; but among fishes, which no
size can discriminate, where the animal ten inches and the animal ten feet
long is entirely the same, there must be some other criterion by which
they are to be distinguished; something that gives precision to our
ideas of the animal whose history we desire to know.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="309"/>Of the real history of fishes,
very little is yet known; but of very many we have full and sufficient
accounts, as to their external form. It would be unpardonable, therefore, in an
hi∣story of these animals, not to give the little we do know; and, at
least, arrange our forces, though we cannot tell their destination. In this
art of arrangement, Artedi and Linnaeus have long been conspicuous: they have
both taken a view of the animal's form in different lights; and, from the parts
which most struck them, have founded their respective systems.</P>
<P>Artedi, who was foremost, perceiving that some fishes
had hard prickly fins, as the pike; that others had soft pliant ones, as the
herring; and that others still wanted that particular fin, by which the gills
are opened and shut, as the eel, made out a system from these
varieties. Linnaeus, on the other hand, rejecting this system, which he
found liable to too many ex∣ceptions, considered the fins, not with regard to
their substance, but their position. The ventral fins seem to be the
great object of his system; he considers them in fishes supplying the
same offices as feet in quadrupedes; and from their total absence, or from
their being situated nearer the head or the tail, in different fishes, he
takes the differences of his system.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="310"/>These arrangements, which are
totally ar∣bitrary, and which are rather a method than a science, are always
fluctuating; and the last is generally preferred to that which went before.
There has lately appeared, however, a system, composed by Mr. Gouan of
Montpellier, that deserves applause for more than its novelty. It appears
to me the best arrangement of this kind that ever was made; and in it the
divisions are not only precisely systematical, but in some measure
adopted by nature itself. This learned French∣man has united the systems
of Artedi and Lin∣naeus together; and by bringing one to correct the other, has
made out a number of tribes, that are marked with the utmost precision. A
part of his system, however, we have already gone through in the
cartilaginous, or, as he calls a part of them, the <HI>branchiostegous</HI>
tribe of fishes. In the arrangement of these I have followed Linnaeus, as
the number of them was but small, and his method simple. But in that which
is more properly called the Spinous class of fishes, I will follow Mr.
Gouan's system; the terms of which, as well as of all the former
systems, require some explanation. I do not love to multiply the
technical terms of a science; but it often happens that names, by being long
used, are as necessary to be known as the science itself.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="311"/>If we consider the substance of
the fin of a fish, we shall find it composed, besides the skin,
either of straight, hard, pointed, bony prickles or spines, as in the pike;
or of soft, crooked or forked bones, or cartilages, as in the her∣ring. The
fish that have bony prickly fins, are called Prickly Finned Fish; the
latter, that have soft or cartilaginous fins, are called, Soft Finned Fish.
The prickly finned fish have received the Greek new-formed name of
<HI>Acan∣thopterigii</HI>; the soft finned fish have likewise their
barbarous Greek name of <HI>Malacopterigii.</HI> Thus far Artedi has supplied
Mr. Gouan with names and divisions. All Spinous fish are di∣vided into
Prickly finned fish, and Soft finned fish.</P>
<P>Again, Linnaeus has taught him to remark the situation of
the fins: for the ventral or belly fins, which are those particularly to be
re∣marked, are either wholly wanting, as in the eel, and then the fish is
called <HI>Apodal</HI> (a Greek word signifying without feet); or the ventral
fins are placed more forward than the pectoral fins, as in the haddock, and
then the animal is called a <HI>Jugular</HI> fish; or the ventral fins are
placed directly under the pectoral fins, as in the father-lasher, and then it
is called a <HI>Tho∣racic</HI> fish: or, lastly, the ventral fins are
placed <PB N="304" REF="312"/> nearer the tail than the pectoral fins, as in the
minow, and then it is an <HI>Abdominal</HI> fish.</P>
<P>Possessed of these distributions, the French
na∣turalist mixes and unites them into two grand divisions. All the prickly
finned fish make one general division; all the soft finned fish
another. These first are distinguished from each other, as being either
<HI>apodal, jugular, thoracic</HI> or <HI>abdominal.</HI> Thus there are
prickly finned <HI>apodal</HI> fishes; prickly finned <HI>jugular</HI>
fishes, prickly finned <HI>tho∣racic</HI> fishes, and prickly finned
<HI>abdominal</HI> fishes. On the other hand, the soft finned fishes fall
un∣der a similar distribution, and make the other ge∣neral division. Thus
there are soft finned <HI>apodal</HI> fishes, soft finned
<HI>jugular</HI> fishes, soft finned <HI>tho∣racic</HI> fishes, and
soft finned <HI>abdominal</HI> fishes. These general characters are
strongly marked, and easily remembered. It only remains, there∣fore, to
divide these into such tribes as are most strongly marked by nature;
and to give the di∣stinct characters of each, to form a complete system
with great simplicity. This Mr. Gouan has done; and the tribes into which he
has di∣stributed each of these divisions, exactly amount to fifty. Thus
the reader, who can contain in his memory the characteristic marks of fifty
kinds, will have a tolerable idea of the form of every kind of spinous
fish. I say, of the form; for <PB N="305" REF="313"/> as to the history
and the nature of the animal itself, that can only be obtained by experience
and information.</P>

<P>Such is the system of Mr Gouan; by re∣ducing to which
any fish that offers, we can know its rank, its affinities, and partly its
anatomy, all which make a considerable part in its natural history. But, to
shew the use of this system still more apparently, suppose I meet
with a fish, the name to me unknown, of which I desire to know something
more. The way is first to see whether it be a cartilaginous fish, which
may be known by its wanting fins to open and shut the gills, which the
cartilaginous kinds are wholly without. If I find that it has them, then it is
a spinous fish; and, in order to know its kind, I examine its fins, whether
they be prickly or soft: I find them soft; it is there∣fore to be ranked
among the soft finned fishes. I then examine its ventral or belly fins, and
finding that the fish has them, I look for their situation, and find they
lie nearer to the tail than the pectoral fins. By this I find the animal to be
a soft finned abdominal fish. Then, to know which of the kinds of these
fishes it is, I examine its figure and the shape of its head, I find the
body rather oblong; the head with a <PB N="316" REF="324"/> small beak; the
lower jaw like a saw; the fin covering the gills with eight rays. This animal
must therefore be the herring, or one of that family, such as the pilchard,
the sprat, the shad, or the anchovy. To give another instance: Upon
examining the fins of a fish to me un∣known, I find them prickly; I then
lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k for the situation of the
ventral fins, I find them entirely wanting; this then must be a prickly
finned apodal fish. Of this kind there are but three; and by comparing the
fish with the de∣scription, I find it either of the trichurus kind, the
sword-fish, or the gilt head. Upon examining also its internal
structure, I shall find a very great similitude between my fish and
that placed at the head of the family.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Spinous Fishes in General.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given a method by which spinous fishes may be
distinguished from each other, the history of each in particular might
natu∣rally be expected to follow: but such a distinct account of each would
be very disgusting, from the unavoidable uniformity of every description.
The history of any one of this class very much resembles that of all the
rest: they breathe air and water through the gills; they live by ra∣pine,
each devouring such animals as its mouth is capable of admitting; and they
propagate, not by bringing forth their young alive, as in the cetaceous tribes,
nor by distinct eggs, as in the generality of the cartilaginous tribes, but
by spawn, or peas, as they are generally called, which they produce by
hundreds of thousands. These are the leading marks that run through their
whole history, and which have so much swelled books with tiresome
repetition.</P>
<P>It will be sufficient therefore to draw this nu∣merous
class into one point of view, and to mark how they differ from the former
classes; and what they possess peculiarly striking, so as 
<PB N="318" REF="326"/> to distinguish them from each other. The first
object that presents itself, and that by which they differ from all others,
are the bones. These, when examined but slightly, appear to be entirely
solid; yet, when viewed more closely, every bone will be found hollow, and
filled with a substance less rancid and oily than mar∣row. These bones
are very numerous, and pointed; and, as in quadrupedes, are the props or
stays to which the muscles are fixed which move the different parts of the
body.</P>
<P>The number of bones in all spinous fishes of the same
kind, is always the same. It is a vulgar way of speaking to say, that
fishes are at some seasons more bony than at others; but this scarce
requires contradiction. It is true indeed, that fish are at some
seasons much fatter than at others; so that the quantity of the flesh
being diminished, and that of the bones remaining the same, they appear to
encrease in number, as they actually bear a greater proportion.</P>
<P>All fish of the same kind, as was said, have the same
number of bones: the skeleton of a fish, however irregularly the bones may
fall in our way at table, has its members very regularly disposed; and
every bone has its fixed place, with as much precision as we find in the
orders of a regular fabric. But then spinous fish differ 
<PB N="319" REF="327"/> in the number of bones according to the species; for
some have a greater number of fins by which they move in the water. The
number in each is always in proportion to the number and size of these
fins: for every fish has a regular apparatus of bones and muscles, by which
the fins are moved; and all those fish where they are nume∣rous or large,
must, of consequence, be consider∣ably bony. Indeed, in the larger
fish, the quantity of flesh is so much, and the bones themselves are
so large, that they are easily seen and separated: but in the smaller
kinds with many fins, the bones are as numerous as in the great; yet being so
very minute, they lurk almost in every part of the flesh, and are dangerous
as well as troublesome to be eaten. In a word, those fish which are
large, fat, and have few fins, are found to be the least bony; those which
are small, lean, and have many fins, are the most bony of all others. Thus,
for instance, a roach appears more bony than a carp, because it is leaner
and smaller; and it is actually more bony than an eel, because it has a
greater num∣ber of fins.</P>
<P>As the spinous fish partake less of the qua∣drupede in
their formation than any others, so they can bear to live out of their own
element a shorter time. In general, when taken out of <PB N="320" REF="328"/>
the water, they testify their change by panting more violently and at
closer intervals, the thin air not furnishing their gills the proper play;
and in a few minutes they expire. Some indeed are more vivacious in air than
others; the eel will live several hours out of water; and the carp has been
known to be fattened in a damp cellar. The method is by placing it in a net
well wrapped up in wet moss, the mouth only out, and then hung up in a vault.
The fish is fed with white bread and milk; and the net now and then plunged
into the water. The animal, thus managed, has been known not only to live for a
fortnight, but to grow exceedingly fat, and of a superior flavour. From this
it would seem, that the want of moisture in the gills, is the chief cause
of the death of these animals; and could that be supplied, their lives
might be prolonged in the air, almost as well as in their own element.</P>
<P>Yet it is impossible to account for the different
operations of the same element, upon animals, that, to appearance, have the
same conformation. To some fishes, bred in the sea, fresh water is
immediate destruction: on the other hand, some fishes, that live in our
lakes and ponds, cannot bear the salt water. Whence this dif∣ference can
arise, is not easy to be accounted <PB N="321" REF="329"/> for. The saline
quality of the water cannot properly be given as the cause; since no
fishes imbibe any of the sea's saltness with their food, or in
respiration. The flesh of all fishes is equally fresh, both in the
river, and at the saltest depths of the ocean; the salt of the element in
which they live, no way mixing with their constitution. Whence then is it
that ani∣mals will live only there; and will quickly ex∣pire, when carried into
fresh water? It may probably arise from the superior weight of the
sea-water. As from the great quantity of salt dissolved in its
composition, it is much heavier than fresh water, so it is probable it
lies with greater force upon the organs of respiration, and gives them their
proper and necessary play: on the other hand, those fish which are
used only to fresh water, cannot bear the weight of the saline fluid, and
expire in a manner suf∣focated in the grossness of the strange
element.</P>
<P>But though there are some tribes that live only in the
sea, and others only in fresh water, yet there are some whose organs
are equally adapted to either element; and that spend a part of their
season in one, and a part in the other. Thus the salmon, the shad, the
smelt, and the flounder, annually quit their native ocean, and come up our
rivers to deposite their <PB N="322" REF="330"/> spawn. This seems the
most important bu∣siness of their lives; and there is no danger which
they will not encounter, even to the surmounting precipices, to find a proper
place for the deposition of their future offspring. The salmon, upon
these occasions, is seen to ascend rivers five hundred miles from the
sea; and to brave not only the danger of various enemies, but also to
spring up cataracts as high as a house. As soon as they come to the
bot∣tom of the torrent, they seem disappointed to meet the obstruction,
and swim some paces back: they then take a view of the danger that lies
before them, survey it motionless for some minutes, advance, and again
retreat; till at last summoning up all their force, they take a leap from
the bottom, their body straight, and strongly in motion; and thus most
frequently clear every obstruction. It sometimes happens, however, that
they want strength to make the leap; and then, in our fisheries, they are
taken in their descent. But this is one of the smallest dangers that
attend these adventuring animals in their progress: numberless are the
methods of taking them; as well by the hook, as by nets, baskets, and other
inventions, which it is not our business here to describe. Their capture
makes, in several countries, a great article of commerce; and being cured in
several different <PB REF="331"/>

<BYLINE>E. Martin sculp.</BYLINE>
</FIGURE> <PB N="323" REF="332"/> manners, either by salting,
pickling, or drying, they are sent to all the markets of Europe.</P>
<P>As these mount up the rivers to deposite their spawn,
others, particularly the eel, descend the fresh water stream, as Redi
assures us, to bring forth their young in the sea. About the month of
August, annually, these animals take the opportunity of the most
obscure nights, and when the rivers are flooded by ac∣cidental rains, seek
the ocean. When they have reached the sea, and produced their young, for they
are viviparous, they again ascend the stream, at different times, as
opportunity offers, or as the season is favourable or tempestuous. Their
passage begins usually about the end of January, and continues till
towards the end of May, when they are taken in the river Arno by millions, and
so small that a thousand of them goes to a pound. There is nothing more
certain than, that they descend in our own rivers after floods, in great
abundance, and are thus caught in nets, to very great advantage. They are
possessed also of a power of climbing over any obstacle; for, by
applying their glutinous and slimy bodies to the surface of the object they
desire to surmount, they can thus creep up locks, weirs, and every thing
that would prevent their ascending the current of the stream.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="333"/>But the length of the voyage performed
by these fishes, is sport, if compared to what is annually undertaken by
some tribes, that con∣stantly reside in the ocean. These are known to
take a course of three or four thousand miles in a season; serving
for prey to whales, sharks, and the numerous flocks of water-fowl, that
regularly wait to intercept their progress. These may be called fish of
passage, and bear a strong analogy to birds of passage, both from
their social disposition, and the immensity of their numbers. Of this
kind are the cod, the haddock, the whiting, the mackrel, the tunny, the
herring, and the pilchard. Other fish live in our vicinity, and reside on
our coasts all the year round; or keep in the depths of the ocean, and are
but seldom seen: but these, at stated seasons, visit their
accustomed haunts with re∣gular certainty, generally returning the same
week in the succeeding year, and often the same day.</P>
<P>The stated returns, and the regular progress of these
fish of passage, is one of the most ex∣traordinary circumstances in
all the history of nature. What it is that impels them to such distant
voyages; what directs their passage; what supports them by the way; and
what sometimes prompts them to quit, for several seasons, one shore
for another, and then return <PB REF="334"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="325" REF="335"/> to their accustomed harbour;
are questions that curiosity may ask, but philosophy can hardly
resolve. We must dismiss enquiry, satisfied with the certainty of the
facts.</P>
<P>The cod seems to be the foremost of this wandering tribe;
and is only found in our northern part of the world. This animal's chief place
of resort is on the banks of New∣foundland, and the other sand banks that
lie off Cape-Breton. That extensive flat seems to be no other than the
broad top of a sea-mountain, extending for above five hundred miles long, and
surrounded with a deeper sea. Hither the cod annually repair in numbers
beyond the power of calculation, to feed on the quantity of worms that are to
be found there in the sandy bottom. Here they are taken in such quantities,
that they supply all Europe with a considerable share of provision. The
English have stages erected all along the shore for salting and drying
them; and the fishermen, who take them with the hook and line, which is their
method, draw them in as fast as they can throw out. This immense capture,
however, makes but a very small diminution, when compared to their num∣bers;
and when their provision there is ex∣hausted, or the season for
propagation returns, they go off to the polar seas, where they depo∣site 
<PB N="326" REF="336"/> their roes in full security. From thence want of food
forces them, as soon as the first more southern seas are open, to
repair southward for subsistence. Nor is this fish an unfrequent
visitant upon our own shores: but the returns are not so regular, nor
does the capture bear any proportion to that at Newfoundland.</P>
<P>The haddock, the whiting, and the mackrel, are thought, by
some, to be driven upon our coasts rather by their fears than their
appetites; and it is to the pursuit of larger fishes, we owe their welcome
visits. It is much more probable, that they come for that food which is found
in more plenty near the shore, than farther out at sea One thing is
remarkable, that their mi∣grations seem to be regularly conducted. The grand
shoal of haddocks that comes periodically on the Yorkshire coasts,
appeared there in a body on the tenth of December, 1766; and exactly on the
same day, in the following year. This shoal extended from the shore near
three miles in breadth, and in length for more than forty. The limits of a
shoal are precisely known; for if the fishermen put down their lines at
the distance of more than three miles from shore, they catch nothing but
dog fish: a proof that the haddock is not there.</P>
<P>But of all migrating fish, the herring and the pilchard take
the most adventurous voyages. <PB N="327" REF="337"/> Herrings are found in
the greatest abundance in the highest northern latitudes. In those
inac∣cessible seas, that are covered with ice for a great part of the
year, the herring and pil∣chard find a quiet and sure retreat from all their
numerous enemies: thither neither man, nor their still more destructive
enemy, the fin fish, or the cachalot, dares to pursue them. The quantity of
insect food which those seas supply, is very great; whence, in that
remote situation, defended by the icy rigour of the climate, they live at
ease, and multiply beyond expression. From this most desirable
retreat, Anderson supposes, they would never depart, but that their
numbers render it necessary for them to migrate; and, as with bees from a
hive, they are compelled to seek for other retreats.</P>
<P>For this reason, the great colony is seen to set out
from the icy sea about the middle of winter; composed of numbers, that if
all the men in the world were to be loaded with her∣rings, they would not carry
the thousandth part away. But they no sooner leave their retreats, but
millions of enemies appear to thin their squadrons. The fin-fish and the
cachalot swallow barrels at a yawn; the porpus, the grampus, the shark, and
the whole numerous tribe of dog-fish, find them an easy prey, and 
<PB N="328" REF="338"/> desist from making war upon each other: but still
more, the unnumbered flocks of sea-fowl that chiefly inhabit near the pole,
watch the outset of their dangerous migration, and spread extensive
ruin.</P>
<P>In this exigence, the defenceless emigrants find no other
safety but by crouding closer to∣gether, and leaving to the outmost bands
the danger of being the first devoured; thus, like sheep when frighted,
that always run together in a body, and each finding some protection in being
but one of many that are equally liable to invasion, they are seen to
separate into shoals, one body of which moves to the west, and pours down
along the coasts of America, as far south as Carolina, and but seldom
farther. In Chese∣peak Bay, the annual inundation of these fish is so
great, that they cover the shores in such quan∣tites as to become a
nuisance. Those that hold more to the east, and come down towards
Eu∣rope, endeavour to save themselves from their merciless pursuers, by
approaching the first shore they can find; and that which first offers in
their descent, is the coast of Iceland, in the beginning of March. Upon
their arrival on that coast, their phalanx, which has already suffered
considerable diminutions, is nevertheless of amazing extent, depth, and
closeness, covering <PB N="329" REF="339"/> an extent of shore as large as
the island itself. The whole water seems alive; and is seen so black
with them to a great distance, that the number seems inexhaustible. There
the porpess and the shark continue their depredations; and the birds devour
what quantities they please. By these enemies the herrings are cooped up
into so close a body, that a shovel, or any hollow vessel put into
the water, takes them up without farther trouble.</P>
<P>That body which comes upon our coasts, begins to appear off
the Shetland Isles in April. These are the forerunners of the grand shoal
which descends in June; while its arrival is easily announced, by the
number of its greedy at∣tendants, the gannet, the gull, the shark and the
porpess. When the main body is arrived, its breadth and depth is such as to
alter the very appearance of the ocean. It is divided into distinct columns,
of five or six miles in length, and three or four broad; while the water
before them curls up, as if forced out of its bed. Sometimes they sink for
the space of ten or fifteen minutes, then rise again to the surface; and,
in bright weather, reflect a variety of splendid colours, like a field
bespangled with purple, gold and azure. The fishermen are ready prepared to
give them a proper recep∣tion; <PB N="330" REF="340"/> and, by nets made for the
occasion, they take sometimes above two thousand barrels at a single
draught.</P>
<P>From the Shetland Isles, another body of this great army,
where it divides, goes off to the western coasts of Ireland, where they
meet with a second necessity of dividing. The one takes to the Atlantic,
where it is soon lost in that extensive ocean; the other passes into
the Irish sea, and furnishes a very considerable capture to the
natives.</P>
<P>In this manner, the herrings expelled from their native
seas, seek those bays and shores where they can find food, and the
best defence against their unmerciful pursuers of the deep. In general,
the most inhabited shores are the places where the larger animals of the
deep are least fond of pursuing; and these are chosen by the herring as
an asylum from greater dangers. Thus, along the coasts of Norway, the
German shores, and the northern shores of France, these animals are found
punctual in their visitations. In these different places they produce their
young; which, when come to some degree of maturity, attend the general
motions. After the destruction of such numbers, the quantity that attempts
to return is but small; and An∣derson doubts whether they ever return.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="341"/>Such is the account given of the
migration of these fishes, by one who, of all others, was best acquainted
with their history; and yet many doubts arise, in every part of the
migration. The most obvious which has been made is, that though such
numbers perish in their descent from the north, yet, in comparison to
those that survive the account is trifling. and it is sup∣posed, that
of those taken by man, the propor∣tion is not one to a million. Their
regularly leaving the shore also at a stated time, would imply that they
are not in these visits under the impulse of necessity. In fact,
there seems one cir∣cumstance that shews these animals governed by a
choice with respect to the shores they pitch upon; and not blindly drove
from one shore to another. What I mean is, their fixing upon some shores
for several seasons, or indeed, for several ages together; and, after
having regularly visited them every year, then capriciously forsaking
them, never more to return. The first great bank for herrings was along the
shores of Norway. Before the year 1584, the number of ships from all parts
of Europe that resorted to that shore, exceeded some thousands. The
quantity of herrings that were then assembled there, was such, that a man
who should put a spear in the water, as Olaus Magnus asserts, would
see it <PB N="332" REF="342"/> stand on end, being prevented from falling.
But soon after that period, these animals were seen to desert the
Norway shores, and took up along the German coast, where the Hanse-towns
drove a very great trade by their capture and sale; but, for above a century,
the herrings have, in a great measure, forsaken them; and their greatest
colonies are seen in the British channel, and upon the Irish shores. It
is not easy to assign a cause for this seemingly ca∣pricious
desertion: whether the number of their finny enemies encreasing along the
northern coasts, may have terrified the herring tribe from their former
places of resort; or, whether the quantity of food being greater in the
British channel, may not allure them thither, is not easy to determine!</P>
<P>The pilchard, which is a fish differing little from the
herring, makes the coast of Cornwall its place of principal resort. Their
arrival on that coast is soon proclaimed by their attendants the birds, and
the larger fishes; and the whole country prepare to take the advantage of
this treasure, providentially thrown before them. The natives sometimes
enclose a bay of several miles extent with their nets called saines. To
direct them in their operations, there were some years ago (but I believe
they are discontinued) several <PB N="333" REF="343"/> men placed on
eminencies near the shore, called <HI>huers,</HI> who, with brooms in their
hands, gave signals where the nets were to be extended, and where the
shoals of fishes lay: this they perceived by the colour of the water, which
assumed a tincture from the shoals beneath. By these means, they
sometimes take twelve or fifteen hundred barrels of pilchards at a draught;
and they place them in heaps on the shore. It often happens, that the
quantity caught exceeds the salt or the utensils for curing them; and then
they are carried off to serve for the pur∣poses of manure. This fishery
employs nor only great numbers of men at sea, training them to naval affairs,
but also numbers of women and children at land, in salting and curing the
fish; in making boats, nets, ropes and casks, for the purposes of taking
or fitting them for sale. The poor are fed with the superfluity of the
capture; the land is manured with the offals: the merchant finds the gain of
commission, and honest commerce; the fisherman a comfortable
subsistence from his toil. 
<Q REND="inline">"Ships," says Dr. Borlase, "are often
freighted hither with salt, and into foreign countries with the fish,
car∣rying off at the same time a part of our tin. The usual produce of the
number of hogs∣heads exported for ten years, from 1747 to 
<PB N="334" REF="344"/> 1756 inclusive, amounted to near thirty thousand
hogsheads each year: every hogs∣head has amounted, upon an average, to the
price of one pound, thirteen shillings and three-pence. Thus the money paid
for pil∣chards exported, has annually amounted to near fifty thousand
pounds."</Q></P>
<P>Whence these infinite numbers are derived, still remains
obscure; but it will encrease our wonder to be told, that so small a
fish as the stickleback, which is seldom above two inches long, and that
one would think could easily find support in any water, is yet obliged to
colonize, and leave its native fens in search of new habitations. Once every
seventh or eighth year, amazing shoals of these appear in the river
Welland, near Spalding, and come up the stream, forming one great column.
They are supposed to be multitudes collected in some of the fens, till
overcharged with numbers, they are periodically obliged to migrate. An idea may
be had of their numbers, when we are informed, that a man, employed by a farmer
to take them, for the purpose of manuring his grounds, has got, for a
considerable time, four shillings a day, by selling them at a halfpenny a
bushel!</P>
<P>Thus we see the amazing propagation of <PB N="335" REF="345"/> fishes along our own coasts and rivers; but their numbers bear
no proportion to the vast quan∣tities found among the islands of the Indian
ocean. The inhabitants of these countries are not under the necessity
even of providing in∣struments for fishing; it is but going down to the
shore, and there the fish are found in great numbers in the plashes that
still continue to have water in them. In some of these places the
quantity is so great, that they are lest in shoals, on those swamps,
dried up by the sun, and their putrefaction contributes to render the country
unhealthful.</P>
<P>This power of encreasing in these animals, exceeds our
idea, as it would, in a very short time, outstrip all calculation. A
single her∣ring, if suffered to multiply unmolested and undiminished
for twenty years, would shew a progeny greater in bulk than ten such globes
as that we live upon. But happily the balance of nature is exactly preserved;
and their con∣sumption is equal to their fecundity. For this reason we are
to consider the porpess, the shark, or the cod-fish, not in the light
of plunderers and rivals, but of benefactors to mankind. Without their
assistance, the sea would soon become overcharged with the burthen of
its own productions; and that element, which at <PB N="336" REF="346"/>
present distributes health and plenty to the shore, would but load it
with putrefaction.</P>
<P>In the propagation of all fish some degree of warmth
seems absolutely necessary, not only to their preservation, but to
the advancement of their posterity. Their spawn is always deposited in
those places where the sun-beams may reach them, either at the bottom of
shallow shores, or floating on the surface in deeper waters. A small
degree of heat answers all the purposes of incubation, and the animal
issues from the egg in its state of perfect formation, never to undergo
any succeeding change.</P>
<P>Yet still, I have some doubts whether most fish come
from the egg completely formed. We know that in all the frog tribe, and many of
the lizard kind, they are produced from the egg in an imperfect form. The
tadpole, or young frog, with its enormous head and slender tail, are well
known; a species of the lizard also, which is excluded from the shell
without legs, only acquires them by degrees, and not till after some time
does it put off its serpent form. It is probable that some kinds of fish
in like manner suffer a change; and though it be too inconsiderable to
strike the fisherman or the in∣attentive spectator, yet it makes a very
material difference to the naturalist, and would perhaps 
<PB N="337" REF="347"/> disarrange his most favourite systems. A
slight alteration in the fins or bones that cover the gills would overturn
the whole fabric of the most applauded ichthyologist; and yet, as I
observed, it is most probable that these minute alterations often take
place.</P>
<P>As a proof of this, during the month of July, there appear
near Greenwich innumerable shoals of small fishes, which are known to the
Lon∣doners by the name of White Bait. It is uni∣versally agreed that they are
the young of some fish; they are never seen but at this time of the year,
and never found to have any roe, a circumstance that proves their not being
come to maturity. The quantity is amazing; and the fish that produces them in
such numbers must be in plenty, though it is not yet known what that fish
is, as they correspond with no other species whatever. They most
resemble the smelt in form; and yet they want a fin, which that animal is
never without. They cannot be the bleak, as they are never found in other
rivers where the bleak breed in great abundance. It is most probable,
therefore, that they are the young of some animal not yet come to their
perfect form, and therefore re∣ducible to no present system.</P>
<P>The time that spinous fishes continue in the 
<PB N="338" REF="348"/> pea is in proportion to the size of the kind. It is a
rule that chiefly holds through nature, that the larger the animals are, the
longer they continue before exclusion. This I say holds generally through
all nature; though it is not easy to assign a cause for so well known
a truth. It may probably be, that as all large bodies take a longer time to
grow hot than small ones, so the larger the egg, the longer influ∣ence of
vital warmth it requires to reach through all its recesses, and to unfold
the dor∣mant springs that wait to be put into motion.</P>
<P>The manner in which the eggs of fishes are impregnated is
wholly unknown. All that ob∣viously offers is, that in ponds the sexes are
often seen together among the long grass at the edge of the water; that
there they seem to struggle; and that during this time they are in a
state of suffering; they grow thin; they lose their appetite, and their
flesh becomes flabby; the scales of some grow rough, and they lose
their lustre. On the contrary, when the time of coupling is over, their
appetite returns; they re-assume their natural agility, and their scales
become brilliant and beautiful.</P>
<P>Although the usual way with spinous fishes is to produce
by spawn; yet there are some, such as the cel and the blenny, that are
known to bring forth their young alive. Bowlker, who <PB N="339" REF="349"/> has
written a treatise upon fishing, seems to determine the question
relative to the viviparous production of eels, upon the authority of one or two
credible witnesses. An eel, opened in the presence of several persons
of credit, was found to have an infinite number of little crea∣tures, closely
wrapped up together in a lump, about the size of a nutmeg, which being put
into a bason of water, soon separated, and swam about: yet still,
whether these may not have been worms generated in the animal's body, remains
a doubt; for there are scarce any fishes that are not infested with worms
in that man∣ner.</P>
<P>With respect to the growth of fishes, it is ob∣served,
that among carps, particularly the first year, they grow to about the size
of the leaf of a willow-tree; at two years, they are about four inches long.
They grow but one inch more the third season, which is five inches. Those
of four years old are about six inches; and seven after the fifth. From
that to eight years old they are found to be large in pro∣portion to the
goodness of the pond, from eight to twelve inches. With regard to
sea-fish, the fishermen assure us that a fish must be six years
old before it is fit to be served up to table. They instance it in the
growth of a mackarel. <PB N="340" REF="350"/> They assure us that those a
year old are as large as one's finger; that those of two years, are about
twice that length; at three and four years, they are that small kind of
mackarel that have neither melts nor rows; and between five and six, they are
those full grown fish that are served up to our tables. In the same
manner, with regard to flat fishes, they tell us that the turbot and barble
at one year are about the size of a crown piece; the second year as large
as the palm of one's hand; and at the fifth and sixth year, they are large
enough to be served up to table. Thus it appears that fish are a
considerable time in coming to their full growth, and that they are a
long-time destroyed before it comes to their turn to be destroyers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Traité des Pêche par Monsieur Duhamel.

<P>All fish live upon each other, in some state of their
existence. Those with the largest mouths, attack and devour the larger
kinds; those whose mouths are less, lie in wait for the smaller fry;
and even these chiefly subsist upon spawn. Of those which live in
the ocean of the spinous kinds, the Dorado is the most voracious. This is
chiefly found in the tropical climates; and is at once the most active, and
the most beautiful of the <PB REF="351"/>

<HEAD>The Flying Fish.</HEAD>

</FIGURE> <PB N="341" REF="352"/> finny region. It is about
six feet long; the back all over enamelled with spots of a bluish green
and silver; the tail and fins of a gold colour; and all have a brilliancy of
tint, that nothing but Nature's pencil can attain to: the eyes are placed on
each side of the head, large and beautiful, surrounded with circles of
shining gold. In the seas where they are found, these fish are always
in motion, and playround ships in full sail, with ease and security:
for ever either pursuing or pursued, they are seen continually in a
state of warfare; either defending them∣selves against the shark, or
darting after the smaller fishes. Of all others, the Flying-fish most
abounds in these seas; and as it is a small animal, seldom growing
above the size of a herring, it is chiefly sought by the dorado. Nature has
furnished each respectively with the powers of pursuit and evasion. The
dorado being above six feet long, yet not thicker than a salmon, and
furnished with a full complement of fins, cuts its way through the water with
amazing rapidity: on the other hand, the flying-fish is furnished with two
pair of fins longer than the body, and these also moved by a stronger
set of muscles than any other. This equality of power seems to furnish
one of the most entertaining spectacles those seas can 
<PB N="342" REF="353"/> exhibit. The efforts to seize on the one side, and
the arts of escaping on the other, are perfectly amusing. The dorado is
seen, upon this occa∣sion, darting after its prey, which will not leave the
water, while it has the advantage of swim∣ming, in the beginning of the
chace. But, like an hunted hare, being tired at last, it then has recourse
to another expedient for safety, by flight. The long fins, which began to
grow useless in the water, are now exerted in a dif∣ferent manner and
different direction to that in which they were employed in swimming: by this
means the timid little animal rises from the water, and flutters over its
surface, for two or three hundred yards, till the muscles employed in
moving the wings, are enfeebled by that particular manner of exertion. By this
time, however, they have acquired a fresh power of renewing their efforts in
the water, and the animal is capable of proceeding with some velo∣city by
swimming: still, however, the active enemy keeps it in view, and drives it
again from the deep; till, at length, the poor little creature is seen to
dart to shorter distances, to flutter with greater effort, and to drop down
at last into the mouth of its fierce pursuer. But not the dorado alone, all
animated nature seems combined against this little fish, which 
<PB N="343" REF="354"/> seems possessed of double powers, only to be
subject to greater dangers. For though it should escape from its enemies
of the deep, yet the tropic bird and the albatross are for ever upon the wing
to seize it. Thus pursued in either element, it sometimes seeks refuge
from a new enemy; and it is not unfrequent for whole shoals of them to fall
on ship-board, where they furnish man with an object of useless
curiosity.</P>
<P>The warfare in fresh-water is not carried on with such
destructive activity; nor are the in∣habitants of that element so numerous.
It would seem that there is something more fa∣vourable to the fecundity of
fishes in the ocean, than in an element less impregnated with salt. It
has been the opinion of some philo∣sophers, that all fish are natives of
that great reservoir; and that only colonies have been sent up rivers,
either through accident, or the necessity of procuring subsistence.
They have been led to this opinion by the superior fe∣cundity of sea
fish, which breed twenty to one; as well as by their superiority in
strength and size, over those of the same kind found in lakes and
rivers. This is a matter too remotely spe∣culative to be worth pursuing;
but certain it is, that, in fresh water, fishes seem to abate much of
their courage and rapacity; pursue <PB N="344" REF="355"/> each other with
less violence, and seem to be less powerfully actuated by all their
appetites. The greediness with which sea-fish devour the bait is
prodigious, if compared with the manner they take it in fresh water. The
lines of such fishermen as go off to sea, are coarse, thick and
clumsy, compared to what are used by those who fish at land. Their
baits are seldom more than a piece of a fish, or the flesh of some
qua∣drupede, stuck on the hook in a bungling manner; and scarce any art is
employed to conceal the deception. But it is otherwise in fresh water; the
lines must often be drawn to an hair-like fineness; they must be
tinctured of the peculiar colour of the stream; the bait must be formed
with the nicest art, and even, if pos∣sible, to exceed the perfection of
nature: yet still the fishes approach it with diffidence, and often swim
round it with disdain. The cod, on the banks of Newfoundland, the instant
the hook, which is only baited with the guts of the animal last taken, is
dropped into the water, darts to it at once, and the fishermen have but to
pull up as fast as they throw down. But it is otherwise with those who
fish in fresh waters, they must wait whole hours in fruitless
expec∣tation; and <HI>the patience of a fisherman</HI> is proverbial among
us.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="356"/>This comparative neglect of food, which
is found in all the tribes of fresh water fishes, renders them less
turbulent and less destructive among each other. Of all these the pike is
the most active and voracious; and our poets, whose business it is to
observe the surface of nature, have called it the tyrant of the watery
plain. In fact, in proportion to its strength and celerity, the pike does
some mischief; but what are its efforts, compared to those of the
cachalot or the shark! they resemble the petty depredations of a robber,
put in competition with the ravages of a conqueror! However, the pike will
attack every fish less than itself; and it is sometimes seen choaked,
by attempting to swallow such as are too large a morsel. It is immaterial
of what species the animal it pursues appears to be, whether of another or
its own; all are in∣discriminately devoured; so that every fish owes its
safety to its minuteness, its celerity, or its courage: nor does the pike
confine itself to feed on fish and frogs; it will draw down the water-rat
and the young ducks, as they are swimming about. Gesner tells us of a mule
that stooped to drink in the water, when a famished pike, that was near,
seized it by the nose, nor was it disengaged till the beast flung it on
shore. So great is their rapacity, that <PB N="346" REF="357"/> they will
contend with the otter for his prey, and even endeavour to force it from him.
For this reason it is dreaded by all other fish; and the small ones
shew the same uneasiness and detestation at the presence of their
tyrant, as the little birds do at the sight of an hawk or an owl. When the
pike lies asleep near the sur∣face, as is frequently the case, the
lesser fish are often observed to swim around it in vast numbers,
with a mixture of caution and terror.</P>
<P>The other tribes of fresh water fish are much inferior to
this animal in courage and rapacity: they chiefly subsist upon worms and
insects, pursuing them at the bottom, or jumping after them to the
surface of the water. In winter also, their appetite seems entirely to
forsake them; at least they continue in so torpid a state, that few
baits will tempt them to their destruc∣tion. At that season, they
forsake the shallow waters, and seek those deep holes to be found in
every river, where they continue for days to∣gether, without ever appearing to
move. The cold seems to affect them; for at that time they lie close to the
bottom, where the water is most warm, and seldom venture out except the day
be peculiarly fine, and the shallows at the edges of the stream become
tepified by the powerful rays of the sun. Indeed, I have been assured,
that <PB N="347" REF="358"/> some fishes may be rendered so torpid by the
cold, in the northern rivers, as to be frozen up, in the great masses of
ice, in which they con∣tinue for several months together, seemingly without
life or sensation, the prisoners of con∣gelation, and waiting the
approach of a warmer sun, to restore them at once to life and liberty. Thus
that chearful luminary not only distributes health and vegetation to the
productions of the earth, but is ardently sought even by the gelid
inhabitants of the water.</P>
<P>As fish are enemies one to another, so each species is
infested with worms of different kinds, peculiar to itself. The great
fish abound with them; and the little ones are not entirely free. These
troublesome vermin lodge themselves either in the jaws, and the
intestines internally, or near the fins without. When fish are healthy and
fat, they are not much annoyed by them; but in winter, when they are lean or
sickly, they then suffer very much.</P>
<P>Nor does the reputed longevity of this class secure them
from their peculiar disor∣ders. They are not only affected by too much cold,
but there are frequently certain disposi∣tions of the element in which they
reside, un∣favourable to their health and propagation. Some ponds they will
not breed in, however <PB N="348" REF="359"/> artfully disposed for
supplying them with fresh recruits of water, as well as provision. In
some seasons they are found to feel epidemic disorders, and are seen
dead by the water-side, without any apparent cause: yet still they are
animals of all others the most vivacious, and they often live and
subsist upon such substances as are poi∣sonous to the more
perfect classes of animated nature.</P>
<P>It is not easy to determine whether the poi∣sonous
qualities which many of them are found to possess, either when they wound
our bodies externally with their spines, or when they are unwarily eaten at
our tables, arises from this cause. That numbers of fishes inflict
poisonous wounds, in the opinion of many, cannot be doubted. The concurrent
testimony of man∣kind, they think sufficient to contradict any
rea∣sonings upon this head, taken from anatomical inspection. The great
pain that is felt from the sting given by the back fin of the weever, bears
no proportion to the smallness of the instrument that inflicts the wound.
How the poison is preserved, or how it is conveyed by the animal, it is not
in our power to perceive; but its actual existence has been often attested
by painful experience. In this instance we must decline conjecture,
satisfied with history.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="360"/>The fact of their being poisonous when
eaten, is equally notorious; and the cause equally in∣scrutable. My poor
worthy friend Dr. Grainger, who resided for many years at St.
Christopher's, assured me, that of the fish caught, of the same kind,
at one end of the island, some were the best and most wholesome in
the world; while others taken at a different end, were always dan∣gerous, and
most commonly fatal. We have a paper in the Philosophical Transactions,
giving an account of the poisonous qualities of those found at New
Providence, one of the Bahama islands. The author there assures us, that
the greatest part of the fish of that dreary coast, are all of a deadly
nature: their smallest effects be∣ing to bring on a terrible pain in the
joints, which, if terminating favourably, leaves the patient without any
appetite for several days after. It is not those of the most deformed
figure, or the most frightful to look at, that are alone to be dreaded; all
kinds, at different times, are alike dangerous; and the same species which
has this day served for nourishment, is the next, if tried, found to be
fatal!</P>
<P>This noxious quality has given rise to much speculation,
and many conjectures. Some have supposed it to arise from the fishes on
these shores eating of the machinel apple, a deadly <PB N="350" REF="361"/>
vegetable poison, that sometimes grows pendent over the sea: but the
quantity of those trees, growing in this manner, bears no proportion to the
extensive infection of the fish. Labat has ascribed it to their eating
the gally fish, which is itself most potently poisonous; but this only
removes our wonder a little farther back; for it may be asked, with as just
a cause for curio∣sity, how comes the gally fish itself to procure its
noxious qualities? Others have ascribed the poison of these fishes to
their feeding upon coperas beds: but I do not know of any cop∣per mines found
in America. In short, as we cannot describe the alembic by which the
rattle-snake distils its malignity, nor the process by which the
scorpion, that lives among roses, converts their sweets to venom, so we
cannot discover the manner by which fishes become thus dangerous; and it is
well for us of Europe that we can thus wonder in security. It is cer∣tain
that, with us, if fishes, such as carp or tench, acquire any disagreeable
flavour from the lakes in which they have been bred, this can be removed, by
their being kept some time in finer and better water: there they soon clear
away all those disagreeable qualities their flesh had contracted, and
become as delicate as if they had been always fed in the most cleanly 
<PB N="351" REF="362"/> manner. But this expedient is with us rather the
precaution of luxury, than the effect of fear; we have nothing to dread from
the noxi∣ous qualities of our fish; for all the animals our waters furnish
are wholesome.</P>
<P>Happy England! where the sea furnishes an abundant and
luxurious repast, and the fresh waters an innocent and harmless
pastime; where the angler, in chearful solitude, strolls by the edge of
the stream, and fears neither the coiled snake, nor the lurking crocodile;
where he can retire at night, with his few trouts, to borrow the pretty
description of old Walton, to some friendly cottage, where the landlady is
good, and the daughter innocent and beautiful; where the room is cleanly, with
lavender in the sheets, and twenty ballads stuck about the wall! There he
can enjoy the company of a talkative bro∣ther sportsman, have his trouts
dressed for supper, tell tales, sing old tunes, or make a catch! There
he can talk of the wonders of na∣ture with learned admiration, or find some
harmless sport to content him, and pass away a little time, without
offence to God, or injury to man!</P>

<HEAD>OF Crustaceous and Testaceous FISHES.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="355" REF="364"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Division of Shell Fish.</HEAD>
<P>IN describing the inhabitants of the water, a class of
animals occur, that mankind, from the place of their residence, have been
content to call fish; but that naturalists, from their for∣mation, have
justly agreed to be unworthy of the name. Indeed, the affinity many of this
kind bear to the insect tribe, may very well plead for the historian who
ranks them rather as insects. However, the common language of a country
must not be slightly invaded; the names of things may remain, if the
philosopher be careful to give precision to our ideas of them.</P>
<P>There are two classes of animals, therefore, in∣habiting
the water, which commonly receive the name of fishes, entirely different from
those we have been describing, and also very distinct from each other.
These are divided by naturalists into Crustaceous and Testaceous
animals: both, totally unlike fishes to appearance, seem to in∣vert the
order of nature; and as those have their bones on the inside, and their
muscles hung upon them for the purposes of life and motion, these, on the
contrary, have all their bony parts on <PB N="356" REF="365"/> the outside,
and all their muscles within. Not to talk mysteriously—all who have
seen a lob∣ster or an oyster, perceive that the shell in these bears
a strong analogy to the bones of other animals; and that, by these
shells, the animal is sustained and defended.</P>
<P>Crustaceous fish, such as the crab and the lob∣ster,
have a shell not quite of a stony hardness, but rather resembling a
firm crust, and in some mea∣sure capable of yielding. Testaceous
fishes, such as the oyster or cockle, are furnished with a shell of a
stony hardness; very brittle, and incapable of yielding. Of the
crustaceous kinds are the Lobster, the Crab, and the Tortoise: of the
testaceous, that numerous tribe of Oysters, Muscles, Cockles, and Sea
Snails, which offer with infinite variety.</P>
<P>The crustaceous tribe seem to hold the mid∣dle rank
between fishes, properly so called, and those snail like animals that
receive the name of testaceous fishes. Their muscles are strong and
firm, as in the former; their shell is self-produced, as among the latter.
They have motion, and hunt for food with great avidity, like the former. They
are incapable of swim∣ming, but creep along the bottom, like the latter: in
short, they form the link that unites these two classes, that seem
so very opposite in their natures.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="366"/>Of testaceous fishes we will speak
hereafter. As to animals of the crustaceous kind, they are very numerous,
their figure offers an hundred varieties: but as to their nature, they are
ob∣viously divided into two very distinct kinds, differing in their habits
and their conformation. The chief of one kind is the Lobster; the chief of
the other, the Tortoise. Under the Lobster we rank the Prawn, the Cray
Fish, the Shrimp, the Sea Crab, the Land Crab, and all their varieties. Under
the Sea Tortoise, the Turtle, the Hawksbill Turtle, the Land Tor∣toise,
and their numerous varieties.</P>

<PB N="358" REF="367"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Crustaceous Animals of the Lobster
Kind.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER different in figure the lobster and the crab may
seem, their manners and con∣formation are nearly the same. With all the
voracious appetites of fishes, they are con∣demned to lead an insect life
at the bottom of the water; and though pressed by continual hunger, they
are often obliged to wait till ac∣cident brings them their prey. Though without
any warmth in their bodies, or even without red blood circulating through their
veins, they are animals wonderfully voracious. Whatever they seize upon that
has life, is sure to perish, though never so well defended: they even
devour each other: and, to encrease our surprize still more, they may, in
some measure, be said to eat them∣selves; as they change their shell
and their sto∣mach every year, and their old stomach is ge∣nerally the
first morsel that serves to glut the new.</P>
<P>The lobster is an animal of so extraordinary a form, that
those who first see it are apt to mistake the head for the tail; but it
is soon discovered that the animal moves with its claws foremost; and
that the part which plays <PB N="359" REF="368"/> within itself by joints,
like a coat of armour, is the tail. The two great claws are the lobster's
instruments of provision and defence; these, by opening like a pair of
nippers, have great strength, and take a firm hold; they are usually
notched, like a saw, which still more encreases their tenacity. Beside
these powerful instru∣ments, which may be considered as arms, the
lobster has eight legs, four on each side; and these, with the tail,
serve to give the animal its progressive and sideling motion. Between
the two claws is the animal's head, very small, and furnished with eyes
that seem like two black horny specks on each side; and these it has a
power of advancing out of the socket, and draw∣ing in at pleasure. The
mouth, like that of insects, opens the long way of the body; not
crossways, as with man, and the higher race of animals. It is furnished
with two teeth for the comminu∣tion of its food; but as these are not
sufficient, it has three more in the stomach; one on each side, and the
other below. Between the two teeth there is a fleshy substance, in the
shape of a tongue. The intestines consist of one long bowel, which
reaches from the mouth to the vent; but what this animal differs in from all
others, is, that the spinal marrow is in the breast-bone. It is furnished
with two long <PB N="360" REF="369"/> feelers or horns, that issue on each
side of the head, that seem to correct the dimness of its sight, and
apprize the animal of its danger, or of its prey. The tail, or that jointed
instrument at the other end, is the grand instrument of motion; and with
this it can raise itself in the water. Under this we usually see lodged
the spawn in great abundance; every pea adhering to the next by a very fine
filament, which is scarcely perceivable. Every lobster is an
her∣maphrodite, and is supposed to be self-im∣pregnated! The ovary, or
place where the spawn is first produced, is backwards, toward the tail,
where a red substance is always found, and which is nothing but a cluster
of peas, that are yet too small for exclusion. From this receptacle there
go two canals, that open on each side at the jointures of the shell, at the
belly; and through these passages the peas de∣scend to be excluded, and
placed under the tail, where the animal preserves them from danger for some
time, until they come to maturity; when, being furnished with limbs and
motion, they drop off into the water.</P>
<P>When the young lobsters leave the parent, they immediately
seek for refuge in the smallest clefts of rocks, and in such like
crevices at the bottom of the sea, where the entrance is but small, and the
opening can be easily defended. <PB N="361" REF="370"/> There, without
seeming to take any food, they grow larger in a few weeks time, from the mere
accidental substances which the water washes to their retreats. By this
time also they acquire an hard, firm shell, which furnishes them with
both offensive and defensive armour. They then begin to issue from
their fortresses, and boldly creep along the bottom, in hopes of meeting
with more diminutive plunder. The spawn of fish, the smaller animals of
their own kind, but chiefly the worms that keep at the bottom of the sea,
supply them with plenty. They keep in this manner close among the rocks,
busily employed in scratching up the sand with their claws for worms, or
surprizing such heedless animals as fall within their grasp: thus they
have little to apprehend, except from each other; for in them, as among
fishes, the large are the most formidable of all other enemies to the
small.</P>
<P>But this life of abundance and security is soon to have a
most dangerous interruption; for the body of the lobster still continuing
to encrease, while its shell remains inalterably the same, the animal
becomes too large for its habitation, and imprisoned within the crust that
has na∣turally gathered round it, there comes on a necessity of getting
free. The young of this <PB N="362" REF="371"/> kind, therefore, that grow
faster, as I am as∣sured by the fishermen, change their shell oftener
than the old, who come to their full growth, and who remain in the same
shell often for two years together. In general, however, all these animals
change their shell once a year; and this is not only a most painful
operation, but also subjects them to every danger. Their molting season
is generally about the begin∣ning of summer; at which time their food is in
plenty, and their strength and vigour in the highest perfection. But soon
all their ac∣tivity ceases: they are seen forsaking the open parts of the
deep, and seeking some retired situation among the rocks, or some
outlet where they may remain in safety from the attacks of their various
enemies. For some days before their change, the animal discontinues its
usual voraciousness; it is no longer seen laboriously harrowing up
the sand at the bottom, or fight∣ing with others of its kind, or hunting its
prey; it lies torpid and motionless, as if in anxious expectation of the
approaching change. Just before casting its shell, it throws itself
upon its back, strikes its claws against each other, and every limb seems
to tremble; its feelers are agitated, and the whole body is in violent mo∣tion:
it then swells itself in an unusual manner, <PB N="363" REF="372"/> and at
last the shell is seen beginning to divide at its junctures; particularly
it opens at the junctures of the belly, where, like a pair of jumps, it was
before but seemingly united. It also seems turned inside out; and its
stomach comes away with its shell. After this, by the same operation, it
disengages itself of the claws, which burst at the joints; the animal,
with a tremulous motion, casting them off as a man would kick off a boot that
was too big for him.</P>
<P>Thus, in a short time, this wonderful creature finds
itself at liberty; but in so weak and en∣feebled a state, that it
continues for several hours motionless. Indeed, so violent and pain∣ful
is the operation, that many of them die under it; and those which survive,
are in such a weakly state for some time, that they neither take food,
nor venture from their retreats. Im∣mediately after this change, they have not
only the softness, but the timidity of a worm. Every animal of the deep is
then a powerful enemy, which they can neither escape nor oppose; and this,
in fact, is the time when the dog-fish, the cod, and the ray, devour them by
hundreds. But this state of defenceless imbecillity continues for a very
short time: the animal, in less than two days, is seen to have the skin
that covered <PB N="364" REF="373"/> its body grown almost as hard as before;
its appetite is seen to encrease; and, strange to be∣hold! the first
object that tempts its gluttony, is its own stomach, which it so lately was
dis∣engaged from. This it devours with great eager∣ness; and some time
after eats even its former shell. In about forty-eight hours, in proportion
to the animal's health and strength, the new shell is perfectly formed, and
as hard as that which was but just thrown aside.</P>
<P>To contribute to the speedy growth of the shell, it is
supposed by some, that the lobster is supplied with a very
extraordinary concretion within its body, that is converted into the shelly
substance. It is a chalky substance, found in the lower part of the
stomach of all lobsters, improperly called crab's eyes, and sold under
that title in the shops. About the time the lobster quits its shell, the
teeth in its stomach break these stones to pieces, and the fluids
con∣tained therein dissolve them. This fluid, which still remains in the
new stomach, is thought to be replete with a petrifying quality, proper for
forming a new shell: however, the concreting power that first formed
these, shews a sufficient power in the animal to produce also the
shell; and it is going but a short way in the causes of things, when we
attempt to explain one wonder by another.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="374"/>When the lobster is compleatly
equipped in its new shell, it then appears how much it has grown in the
space of a very few days; the di∣mensions of the old shell being compared
with those of the new, it will be found that the creature is encreased
above a third in its size; and, like a boy that has outgrown his cloaths, it
seems wonderful how the deserted shell was able to contain so great an
animal as entirely fills up the new.</P>
<P>The creature thus furnished, not only with a complete
covering, but also a greater share of strength and courage, ventures more
boldly among the animals at bottom; and not a week passes that in its
combats it does not suffer some mutilation. A joint, or even a whole claw,
is sometimes snapped off in these en∣counters. At certain seasons of
the year these animals never meet each other without an en∣gagement. In
these, to come off with the loss of a leg, or even a claw, is considered
as no great calamity; the victor carries off the spoil to feast upon at his
leisure, while the other re∣tires from the defeat to wait for a thorough
re∣pair. This repair is not long in procuring. From the place where the joint
of the claw was cut away, is seen in a most surprizing manner to burgeon
out the beginning of a new claw. <PB N="366" REF="375"/> This, if observed, at
first, is small and tender, but grows, in the space of three weeks, to be
al∣most as large and as powerful as the old one. I say almost as large,
for it never arrives to the full size; and this is the reason we generally
find the claws of the lobsters of unequal magnitude.</P>
<P>After what has been thus described, let us pause a little,
to reflect on the wonders this extra∣ordinary creature offers to our
imagination! An animal without bones on the inside, yet furnished with a
stomach capable of digesting the hardest substances, the shells of
muscles, of oysters, and even its own; an animal gaining a new sto∣mach
and a new shell at stated intervals! Fur∣nished with the instruments of
generation double in both sexes; and yet with an apparent inca∣pacity of
uniting! Without red blood circu∣lating through the body, and yet apparently
vigorous and active! But most strange of all, an animal endowed with a
vital principle that furnishes out such limbs as have been cut away; and
keeps continually combating it, though in constant repair to renew its
engagements!—These are but a small part of the wonders of the deep,
where Nature sports without a spectator!</P>
<P>Of this extraordinary yet well known animal there are many
varieties, with some differences <PB REF="376"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="367" REF="377"/> in the claws, but little in
the habits or confor∣mation. It is found above three feet long; and if we may
admit the shrimp and the prawn into the class, though unfurnished with
claws, it is seen not above an inch. These all live in the water, and can
bear its absence for but a few hours. The shell is black when taken out of
the water, but turns red by boiling. The most common way of taking the
lobster is in a basket, or pot, as the fishermen call it, made of
wicker-work, in which they put the bait, and then throw it to the bottom of the
sea, in six or ten fathom water. The lobsters creep into this for the
sake of the bait, but are not able to get out again. The river craw-fish
differs little from the lobster, but that the one will live only in fresh
water, and the other will thrive only in the sea.</P>
<P>The crab is an animal found equally in fresh and salt
water; as well upon land as in the ocean. In shape it differs very much from
the lobster, but entirely resembles it in habits and conformation. The tail
in this ani∣mal is not so apparent as in the former, being that broad flap
that seems to cover a part of the belly, and when lifted discovers the peas
or spawn, situated there in great abundance. It resembles the lobster
in the number of its claws, which are two; and its legs, which are eight, 
<PB N="368" REF="378"/> four on either side. Like the lobster, it is a bold
voracious animal; and such an enmity do crabs bear each other, that those
who carry them for sale to market, often tie their claws with strings to
prevent their fighting and maiming themselves by the way. In short, it
resembles the lobster in every thing but the amazing bulk of its body
compared to the size of its head, and the length of its intestines, which
have many convolutions.</P>
<P>As the crab, however, is found upon land as well as in the
water, the peculiarity of its situation produces a difference in its
habi∣tudes, which it is proper to describe. The Land Crab is found in some
of the warmer re∣gions of Europe, and in great abundance in all the tropical
cimates in Africa and America. They are of various kinds, and endued with
various properties; some being healthful, de∣licious, and nourishing food;
others, poisonous or malignant to the last degree; some are not above
half an inch broad, others are found a foot over; some are of a dirty brown,
and others beautifully mottled. That animal called the Violet Crab of the
Caribbee Islands, is the most noted both for its shape, the delicacy of
its flesh, and the singularity of its manners.</P>
<P>The violet crab somewhat resembles two hands cut through
the middle and joined to∣gether; <PB N="369" REF="379"/> for each side looks
like four fingers, and the two nippers or claws resemble the thumbs. All the
rest of the body is covered with a shell as large as a man's hand and
bunched in the middle, on the fore-part of which there are two long eyes of the
size of a grain of barley, as transparent as chrystal and as hard as
horn. A little below these is the mouth, covered with a sort of barbs,
under which there are two broad sharp teeth as white as snow. They are not
placed, as in other ani∣mals, cross-ways, but in the opposite direction,
not much unlike the blades of a pair of scissars. With these teeth they
can easily cut leaves, fruits, and rotten wood, which is their usual food.
But their principal instrument for cut∣ting and seizing their food is their
nippers, which catch such an hold, that the animal loses the limb sooner
than its grasp, and is often seen scampering off, having left its claw
still holding fast upon the enemy. The faithful claw seems to perform its
duty, and keeps for above a mi∣nute fastened upon the finger while the crab
is making off<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Brown Jamaic. 423.</BIBL></NOTE>.
In fact it loses no great matter by leaving a leg or an arm, for they soon
grow again, and the animal is found as perfect as before.</P>
<P>This, however, is the least surprizing part of 
<PB N="370" REF="380"/> this creature's history: and what I am going to
relate, were it not as well known and as con∣fidently confirmed as any other
circumstance in natural history, it might well stagger our belief.
These animals live not only in a kind of or∣derly society in their retreats
in the mountains, but regularly once a year march down to the sea-side in a
body of some millions at a time. As they multiply in great numbers, they
chuse the months of April or May to begin their ex∣pedition; and then sally
out by thousands from the stumps of hollow trees, from the clefts of rocks,
and from the holes which they dig for themselves under the surface of the
earth. At that time the whole ground is covered with this band of adventurers;
there is no setting down one's foot without treading upon them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Labat. Voyage aux Isle Francoise, vol. ii. p.
221.</BIBL></NOTE>. The sea is their place of destination, and to that they
direct their march with right-lined precision. No geometrician could send
them to their de∣stined station by a shorter course; they neither turn
to the right or left, whatever obstacles intervene; and even if they meet
with a house, they will attempt to scale the walls to keep the unbroken
tenor of their way. But though this be the general order of their route, they
upon other occasions are compelled to conform to <PB N="371" REF="381"/> the
face of the country; and if it be intersected by rivers, they are then seen
to wind along the course of the stream. The procession sets for∣ward
from the mountains with the regularity of an army under the guidance of an
experienced commander. They are commonly divided into three battalions; of
which, the first consists of the strongest and boldest males, that,
like pioneers, march forward to clear the route and face the greatest
dangers. These are often obliged to halt for want of rain, and go into the
most convenient encampment till the weather changes. The main body of the
army is com∣posed of females, which never leave the moun∣tains till the rain
is set in for some time, and then descend in regular battalia, being
formed into columns of fifty paces broad and three miles deep, and so close
that they almost cover the ground. Three or four days after this the
rear-guard follows; a straggling undisciplined tribe, consisting of
males and females, but neither so robust nor so numerous as the former.
The night is their chief time of proceeding; but if it rains by day, they do
not fail to profit by the occasion; and they continue to move forward in
their slow uniform manner. When the sun shines and is hot upon the
surface of the ground, they then make an universal halt, and 
<PB N="372" REF="382"/> wait till the cool of the evening. When they are
terrified, they march back in a confused disorderly manner, holding up
their nippers, with which they sometimes tear off a piece of the skin, and
then leave the weapon where they inflicted the wound. They even try to
intimidate their enemies; for they often clatter their nippers together, as if
it were to threaten those that come to disturb them. But though they thus
strive to be formidable to man, they are much more so to each other; for
they are possessed of one most unsocial property, which is, that if
any of them by accident is maimed in such a manner as to be incapable of
proceed∣ing, the rest fall upon and devour it on the spot, and then
pursue their journey.</P>
<P>When after a fatiguing march and escaping a thousand
dangers, for they are sometimes three months in getting to the shore, they
have arrived at their destined port, they prepare to cast their spawn.
The peas are as yet within their bodies, and not excluded, as is usual in
animals of this kind, under the tail; for the creature waits for the benefit of
the sea-water to help the delivery. For this purpose, the crab has no
sooner reached the shore, than it eagerly goes to the edge of the water,
and lets the waves wash over its body two or three <PB N="373" REF="383"/>
times. This seems only a preparation for bring∣ing their spawn to maturity;
for without farther delay they withdraw to seek a lodging upon land: in the
mean time, the spawn grows larger, is excluded out of the body, and sticks
to the barbs under the flap, or more properly the tail. This bunch is seen as
big as an hen's egg, and exactly resembling the rowes of her∣rings. In this
state of pregnancy, they once more seek the shore for the last time,
and shaking off their spawn into the water, leave accident to bring it to
maturity. At this time whole shoals of hungry fish are at the shore in
expectation of this annual supply; the sea to a great distance seems
black with them; and about two thirds of the crabs eggs are immediately
devoured by these rapacious invaders. The eggs that escape are hatched
under the sand; and soon after millions at a time of these little crabs
are seen quitting the shore, and slowly travelling up to the
mountains.</P>
<P>The old ones, however, are not so active to return; they
have become so feeble and lean, that they can hardly creep along, and the
flesh at that time changes its colour. The most of them, therefore, are
obliged to continue in the flat parts of the country till they recover, mak∣ing
holes in the earth, which they cover at the <PB N="374" REF="384"/> mouth with
leaves and dirt so that no air may enter. There they throw off their old
shells, which they leave as it were quite whole, the place where they opened
on the belly being un∣seen. At that time they are quite naked, and almost
without motion for six days together, when they become so fat as to be
delicious food. They have then under their stomachs four large white
stones, which gradually de∣crease in proportion as the shell hardens, and
when they come to perfection are not to be found. It is at that time that the
animal is seen slowly making its way back; and all this is most commonly
performed in the space of six weeks.</P>
<P>This animal when possessed of its retreats in the
mountains is impregnable; for only sub∣sisting upon vegetables, it
seldom ventures out; and its habitation being in the most inaccessible
places, it remains for a great part of the season in perfect security. It
is only when impelled by the desire of bringing forth its young, and when
compelled to descend into the flat country, that it is taken. At that time
the natives wait for its descent in eager expectation, and destroy
thousands; but disregarding the bodies, they only seek for that small
spawn which lies on each side of the stomach within the shell, of about
<PB N="375" REF="385"/> the thickness of a man's thumb. They are much more
valuable upon their return after they have cast their shell; for being
covered with a skin resembling soft parchment, almost every part except
the stomach may be eaten. They are taken in their holes by feeling for them
in the ground with an instrument: they are sought after by night, when on
their journey, with flambeaux. The instant the animal perceives itself
attacked, it throws itself on its back, and with its claws pinches most
terribly whatever it happens to fasten on. But the dextrous crab-catcher
takes them by the hinder legs in such a manner, that its nippers cannot touch
him, and thus he throws it into his bag. Sometimes also they are caught when
they take refuge at the bottom of holes, in rocks by the sea-side, by
clapping a stick at the mouth of the hole, which prevents their getting out;
and then soon after the tide coming, enters the hole, and the ani∣mal is
found upon its retiring drowned in its retreat.</P>
<P>These crabs are of considerable advantage to the natives;
and the slaves very often feed entirely upon them. In Jamaica, where they are
found in great plenty, they are considered as one of the greatest
delicacies of the place. Yet still, the eating of them is attended with 
<PB N="376" REF="386"/> some danger; for even of this kind many are found
poisonous, being fed, as it is thought, upon the makinel apple; and whenever
they are found under that noxious plant, they are always rejected with caution.
It is thus with almost all the productions of those luxurious climates;
however tempting they may be to the appetite, they but too often are found
de∣structive; and scarce a delicacy among them that does not carry its own
alloy.</P>
<P>The descent of these creatures for such im∣portant
purposes deserves our admiration; but there is an animal of the lobster
kind that an∣nually descends from its mountains in like man∣ner, and for
purposes still more important and various. Its descent is not only to
produce an offspring, but to provide itself a covering; not only to secure
a family, but to furnish an house. The animal I mean is the soldier-crab,
which has some similitude to the lobster, if divested of its shell.
It is usually about four inches long, has no shell behind, but is covered
down to the tail with a rough skin, terminating in a point. It is however
armed with strong hard nippers before, like the lobster; and one of them is
as thick as a man's thumb, and pinches most powerfully. It is, as I said,
without a shell to any part except its nippers; but what 
<PB N="377" REF="387"/> Nature has denied this animal it takes care to supply
by art; and taking possession of the de∣serted shell of some
other animal, it resides in it, till, by growing too large for its
habitation, it is under a necessity of change. It is a native of the
West-India Islands; and, like the former, it is seen every year
descending from the moun∣tains to the sea-shore, to deposit its
spawn, and to provide itself with a new shell. This is a most
bustling time with it, having so many things to do; and, in fact, very
busy it appears. It is very probable that its first care is to provide for
its offspring before it attends to its own wants; and it is thought, from the
number of little shells which it is seen examining, that it deposits its
spawn in them, which thus is placed in perfect security till the time of
exclusion.</P>
<P>However this be, the soldier is in the end by no means
unmindful of itself. It is still seen in its old shell, which it
appears to have consider∣ably outgrown; for a part of the naked body is
seen at the mouth of it, which the habitation is too small to hide. A
shell, therefore, is to be found large enough to cover the whole body; and
yet not so large as to be unmanage∣able and unwieldy. To answer both
these ends is no easy matter, nor the attainment of a slight 
<PB N="378" REF="388"/> enquiry. The little soldier is seen busily
pa∣rading the shore along that line of pebbles and shells that is formed by
the extremest wave; still, however, dragging its old incommodious
habitation at its tail, unwilling to part with one shell, even though a
troublesome appendage, till it can find another more convenient. It is seen
stopping at one shell, turning it and passing it by, going on to
another, contemplating that for a while, and then slipping its tail from its
old habitation, to try on the new. This also is found to be inconvenient; and
it quickly returns to its old shell again. In this manner it frequently
changes, till at last it finds one light, roomy and commodious; to this it
ad∣heres, though the shell be sometimes so large as to hide the body of
the animal, claws and all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pere du
Testre.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Yet it is not till after many trials, but many combats also,
that the soldier is thus completely equipped; for there is often a contest
between two of them for some well looking favourite shell for which they
are rivals. They both en∣deavour to take possession; they strike with
their claws; they bite each other, till the weakest is obliged to yield, by
giving up the object of dis∣pute. It is then that the victor immediately
takes <PB N="379" REF="389"/> possession, and parades it in his new
conquest three or four times back and forward upon the strand before his
envious antagonist.</P>
<P>When this animal is taken, it sends forth a feeble cry,
endeavouring to seize the enemy with its nippers; which if it fastens upon
it will sooner die than quit the grasp. The wound is very painful, and not
easily cured. For this reason, and as it is not much esteemed for its
flesh, it is generally permitted to return to its old retreat to the
mountains in safety. There it continues till the necessity of changing
once more, and the desire of producing an offspring, expose it to fresh
dangers the year ensuing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Tortoise and its Kinds.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING described the lobster and the crab as animals in
some measure approaching to the insect tribes, it will appear like
injustice to place the Tortoise among the number, that, from its
strength, its docility, the warm red blood that is circulating in its veins,
deserves to be ranked even above the fishes. But as this animal is covered,
like the lobster, with a shell, as it is of an amphibious nature, and
brings forth its young from the egg without hatching, we must be content to
degrade it among animals that in every respect it infinitely
surpasses.</P>
<P>Tortoises are usually divided into those that live upon
land, and those that subsist in the water; and use has made a
distinction even in the name; the one being called Tortoises, the other
Turtles. However, Seba has proved that all tortoises are amphibious; that the
land tor∣toise will live in the water; and that the sea turtle can be fed
upon land. A land tortoise was brought to him that was caught in one of the
canals of Amsterdam, which he kept for half a year in his house, where it
lived very well <PB N="381" REF="391"/> contented in both elements. When in the
water it remained with its head above the surface; when placed in the sun,
it seemed delighted with its beams, and continued immovable while it felt
their warmth. The difference, therefore, in these animals, arises rather
from their habits than their conformation; and, upon examina∣tion, there will
be less variety found between them than between birds that live upon land,
and those that swim upon the water.</P>
<P>Yet, though Nature seems to have made but few distinctions
among these animals, as to their conformation, yet, in their habits, they are
very dissimilar; as these result from the different qualities of their
food, and the different sorts of enemies they have to avoid or encounter. I
will therefore exhibit their figure and conforma∣tion under one common
description, by which their slight differences will be more obvious; and
then I will give a separate history of the manners of each, as
naturalists and travellers have taught us.</P>
<P>All tortoises, in their external form, pretty much
resemble each other; their outward co∣vering being composed of two great
shells, the one laid upon the other, and only touching at the edges: however,
when we come to look closer, we shall find that the upper shell is
com∣posed <PB N="382" REF="392"/> of no less than thirteen pieces, which are
laid flat upon the ribs, like the tiles of an house, by which the shell is
kept arched and supported. The shells both above and below that, which
seem, to an inattentive observer, to make each but one piece, are bound
together at the edges by very strong and hard ligaments, yet with some
small share of motion. There are two holes at either edge of this vaulted
body; one for a very small head, shoulders and arms, to peep through; the
other at the opposite edge, for the feet and the tail. These shells the
animal is never disengaged from; and they serve for its defence against
every creature but man.</P>
<P>The tortoise has but a small head, with no teeth; having
only two bony ridges in the place, serrated and hard. These serve to
gather and grind its food; and such is the amazing strength of the jaws,
that it is impossible to open them where they once have fastened. Even
when the head is cut off, the jaws still keep their hold; and the muscles,
in death, preserve a tenacious rigidity. Indeed, the animal is
pos∣sessed of equal strength in all other parts of its body: the
legs, though short, are inconceivably strong; and torpid as the tortoise
may appear, it has been known to carry five men standing 
<PB N="383" REF="393"/> upon its back, with apparent ease and uncon∣cern. Its
manner of going forward is by mov∣ing its legs one after the other; and the
claws with which the toes are furnished, sink into the ground like the
nails of an iron shod wheel, and thus assist its progression.</P>
<P>With respect to its internal parts, not to enter into minute
anatomical disquisitions, it may not be improper to observe, that the
blood circulates in this animal as in some cartilaginous fishes, and
something in the manner of a child in the womb. The greatest quantity of
the blood passes directly from the vena cava into the left ventricle of the
heart, which commu∣nicates with the right ventricle by an opening; while the
auricles only receive what the ven∣tricles seem incapable of admitting. Thus
the blood is driven by a very short passage through the circulation; and
the lungs seem to lend only occasional assistance. From this
conformation the animal can subsist for some time, without using the
lungs or breathing; at least, the lungs are not so necessary an
instrument for driving on the circulation as with us.</P>
<P>Such is the general structure of this animal, whether found
to live by land or water. With regard to the differences of these animals,
the <PB N="384" REF="394"/> land tortoise, from its habits of making use of
its feet in walking, is much more nimble upon land than the sea turtle: the
land tortoise, if thrown upon its back, by rocking and balancing its body,
like a child rocking in a cradle, at last turns itself upon its face again;
but the turtle, when once turned, continues without being able to move from the
spot. In comparing the feet also of these animals, the nails upon the
toes of one that has been long used to scratch for subsistence upon
land, are blunt and worn; while those that have only been employed in
swimming, are sharp and long, and have more the similitude of fins. The
brain of the land tortoise is but small; and yet it is three times as large
as that of the turtle. There is a difference also in the shape of their
eggs, and in the passage by which they are ex∣cluded; for, in the land
tortoise, the passage is so narrow, that the egg conforms to the
shape of the aperture, and though round when in the body, yet becomes much
more oblong than those of fowls, upon being excluded; otherwise they would
never be able to pass through the bony canal by which they are protruded: on
the contrary, the passage is wider in the turtle, and therefore its eggs
are round. These are the most striking distinctions; but that which is 
<PB N="385" REF="395"/> most known is their size; the land tortoise often
not exceeding three feet long, by two feet broad; the sea turtle being
sometimes from five to seven feet long. The size, however, is but a
fallacious distinction; since land tortoises, in some parts of India,
grow to a very great magnitude; though probably not, as the an∣cients affirm,
big enough for a single shell to serve for the covering of an
house.</P>
<P>But if the different kinds of tortoises are not
sufficiently distinguished by their figure, they are very obviously
distinguishable by their me∣thods of living. The land tortoise lives in
holes dug in the mountains, or near marshy lakes; the sea turtle in
cavities of rocks, and extensive pastures at the bottom of the sea. The
tor∣toise makes use of its feet to walk with, and burrow in the ground; the
turtle chiefly uses its feet in swimming, or creeping at bottom.</P>
<P>The land tortoise is generally found, as was observed
above, from one foot to five feet long, from the end of the snout to the end
of the tail; and from five inches to a foot and an half across the back. It
has a small head, somewhat resembling that of a serpent; an eye without
the upper lid; the under eye-lid serving to cover and keep that organ in
safety. It has a strong, scaly tail, like the lizard. Its head the animal
<PB N="386" REF="396"/> can put out and hide at pleasure, under the great
penthouse of its shell: there it can remain secure from all attacks;
there, defended on every side, it can fatigue the patience of the most
formidable animal of the forest, that makes use only of natural strength
to destroy it. As the tortoise lives wholly upon vegetable food, it never
seeks the encounter; yet, if any of the smaller ani∣mals attempt to invade
its repose, they are sure to suffer. The tortoise, impregnably
defended, is furnished with such a strength of jaw, that, though armed
only with bony plates instead of teeth, wherever it fastens, it infallibly
keeps its hold, until it has taken out the piece.</P>
<P>Though peaceable in itself, it is formed for war in another
respect, for it seems almost en∣dued with immortality. Nothing can kill
it; the depriving it of one of its members, is but a slight injury; it will
live, though deprived of the brain; it will live, though deprived of its head.
Redi informs us that, in making some experiments upon vital motion, he, in
the beginning of the month of November, took a land tortoise, made a large
opening in its skull, and drew out all the brain, washed the cavity, so
as not to leave the smallest part re∣maining, and then, leaving the hole
open, set <PB N="387" REF="397"/> the animal at liberty. Notwithstanding
this the tortoise marched away without seeming to have received the
smallest injury; only it shut the eyes, and never opened them afterwards.
Soon after the hole in the skull was seen to close; and, in three days,
there was a complete skin covering the wound. In this manner the animal
lived, without a brain, for six months; walking about unconcernedly, and
moving its limbs as before. But the Italian philosopher, not satisfied with
this experiment, carried it still farther; for he cut off the head, and the
ani∣mal lived twenty-three days after its separa∣tion from the body. The head
also continued to rattle the jaws, like a pair of castanets, for above a
quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>Nor are these animals less long lived than difficult in
destroying. Tortoises are com∣monly known to exceed eighty years old; and
there was one kept in the Archbishop of Can∣terbury's garden, at Lambeth,
that was re∣membered above an hundred and twenty. It was at last killed by
the severity of a frost, from which it had not sufficiently defended
itself in its winter retreat, which was a heap of sand, at the bottom of
the garden.</P>
<P>The usual food of the land tortoise seems not so
nourishing as to supply this extraordinary prin∣ciple <PB N="388" REF="398"/> of vitality. It lives upon vegetables in its retreats in the
mountains or the plain; and seldom makes its prey of snails or worms, but
when other food is not found in grateful plenty. It is fond also of fruits;
and when the forest affords them, is generally found not far from where they
grow. As it can move but slowly, it is not very delicate in the choice of its
food; so that it usually fills itself with what∣ever offers. Those that
are kept in a domestic state, will eat any thing; leaves, fruits, corn
bran, or grass.</P>
<P>From the smallness of its brain, and the slowness of
its motion, it obviously appears to be a torpid, heavy animal, requiring
rest and sleep; and, in fact, it retires to some cavern to sleep for
the winter. I already observed that its blood circulated through the heart by
a short passage; and that it did not, as anatomists express it, go
through the great circulation. With us and quadrupes the blood goes from the
veins to the heart; from the heart it is sent to be spread over the lungs;
from the lungs it re∣turns to the heart again; and from thence it goes to the
arteries, to be distributed through the whole body. But its passage in
the tortoise is much shorter; for, from the veins it goes to the heart;
then leaving the lungs entirely out of its course, it takes a short cut, if
I may so <PB N="389" REF="399"/> say, into the beginning of the arteries,
which send it round the animal frame. From hence we see the lungs are left
out of the circulation; and consequently, the animal is capable of
con∣tinuing to live without continuing to breathe. In this it resembles the
bat, the serpent, the mole, and the lizard; like them it takes up its dark
residence for the winter; and, at that time, when its food is no longer in
plenty, it happily becomes insensible to the want. Nor is it unmindful to
prepare its retreat, and make it as convenient as possible; it is
sometimes bu∣ried two or three feet in the ground, with its hole furnished
with moss, grass, and other sub∣stances, as well to keep the retreat
warm, as to serve for food, in case it should prematurely wake from its
state of stupefaction. But it must not be supposed that, while it is
thus at rest, it totally discontinues to breathe; on the contrary, an
animal of this kind, if put into a close vessel, without air, will soon
be stifled; though not so readily as in a state of vigour and
activity.</P>
<P>From this dormant state the tortoise is awa∣kened by the
genial return of spring; and is thought not to be much wasted by its long
confinement. To animals that live an hundred and fifty years, a sleep of
six months is but as <PB N="390" REF="400"/> the nap of a night. All the
actions of these long lived creatures seem formed upon a scale
answering the length of their existence: their slumbers are for a
season; their motions are slow, and require time in every action: even
the act of procreation, which among other ani∣mals is performed in a very few
minutes, is with them the business of days. About a month after their
enlargement from a torpid state, they prepare to transmit their
posterity; and both continue joined, for near a month, together. The eggs of
the female are contained in the ovary, above the bladder, which, is extremely
large; and these are, before their exclusion, round and naked, with spots
of red: after they are laid, however, they assume another form, being
smaller and longer than those of a hen. This alteration in the figure of
the eggs most probably proceeds from the narrowness of the bony passage
through which they are excluded. Swammerdam, who compared the size of the
eggs taken out of this animal's body with the diameter of the passage
through which they were excluded, was of opinion that the bones themselves
separated from each other, and closed again; but, in my opinion, it is more
probable to suppose, that the eggs, and not the bones, alter their form.
Certain it is, that they are round in the body, and that they are oval upon
being protruded.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="401"/>The eggs of all the tortoise kind,
like those of birds, are furnished with a yolk and a white; but the shell
is different, being somewhat like those soft eggs that hens exclude
before their time: however, this shell is much thicker and stronger, and is
a longer time in coming to maturity in the womb. The land tortoise lays but a
few in number, if compared to the sea turtle, who de∣posits from an hundred
and fifty to two hun∣dred in a season.</P>
<P>The amount of the land tortoise's eggs, I have not been able
to learn; but, from the scarceness of the animal, I am apt to think they
cannot be very numerous. When it prepares to lay, the female scratches a
slight depression in the earth, generally in a warm situation, where
the beams of the sun have their full effect: there depositing her eggs, and
covering them with grass and leaves, she forsakes them, to be hatched by
the heat of the season. The young tortoises are generally excluded in
about twenty-six days; but, as the heat of the weather assists, or its
coldness retards incubation, some∣times it happens that there is a
difference of two or three days. The little animals no sooner leave the egg
than they seek for their provision, entirely self-taught; and their
shell, with which they are covered from the be∣ginning, <PB N="392" REF="402"/> expands and grows larger with age; As it is composed of a variety
of pieces, they are all capable of extension at their futures, and the
shell admits of encrease in every direction. It is otherwise with those
animals, like the lob∣ster, whose shell is composed all of one piece,
that admits of no encrease; which, when the te∣nant is too big for the
habitation, must burst the shell, and get another. But the covering of
the tortoise grows larger in proportion as the internal parts expand; in
some measure resem∣bling the growth of the human skull, which is
composed of a number of bones, encreasing in size in proportion to the
quantity of the brain. All tortoises, therefore, as they never change their
shell, must have it formed in pieces; and though, in some that have been
described by painters or historians, these marks have not been attended
to, yet we can have no doubt that they are general to the whole tribe.</P>
<P>It is common enough to take these animals into gardens, as
they are thought to destroy in∣sects and snails in great abundance. We
are even told that, in hot countries, they are ad∣mitted into a domestic
state, as they are great destroyers of bugs. How so large and heavy an
animal is capable of being expert at such petty prey, is not easy to
conceive; but I have <PB REF="403"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="393" REF="404"/> seen several of them about
gentlemen's houses, that, in general, appear torpid, harmless and even fond
of employment. Children have some∣times got upon the back of a tortoise;
and such was the creature's strength, that it never seemed overloaded,
but moved off with its bur∣then to where it expected to be fed, but would carry
them no further. In winter they regularly find out a place to sleep in; but
in those warm countries in which the tortoise is found larger, and in
greater plenty than in Europe, they live without retiring the whole year
round.</P>
<P>The Sea Tortoise, or Turtle as it is now called, is
generally found larger than the former. This element is possessed with
the property of encreasing the magnitude of those animals, which are common
to the land and the ocean. The sea pike is larger than that of fresh-water;
the sea bear is larger than that of the mountains; and the sea turtle
exceeds the land tortoise in the same proportion. It is of different
magni∣tudes, according to its different kinds; some turtles being not above
fifty pound weight, and some above eight hundred.</P>
<P>The Great Meditèrranean Turtle is the largest of the
turtle kind with which we are acquainted. It is found from five to eight feet
long, and from six to nine hundred pounds <PB N="394" REF="405"/> weight. But,
unluckily, its utility bears no proportion to its size; as it is unfit for
food, and sometimes poison those who eat it. The shell also, which is
a tough strong integument, resembling an hide, is unfit for all
serviceable purposes. One of these animals was taken in the year 1729, at
the mouth of the Loire, in nets that were not designed for so large a
capture. This turtle, which was of enormous strength, by its own struggles
involved itself in the nets in such a manner as to be incapable of doing
mischief: yet, even thus shackled, it ap∣peared terrible to the
fishermen, who were at first for flying; but finding it impotent, they
gathered courage to drag it on shore, where it made a most horrible
bellowing; and when they began to knock it on the head with their gaffs, it was
to be heard at half a mile's distance. They were still further intimidated
by its nauseous and pestilential breath, which so powerfully affected
them, that they were near fainting. This ani∣mal wanted but four inches of
being eight feet long, and was above two feet over: its shell more
resembled leather than the shell of a tor∣toise; and, unlike all other
animals of this kind, it was furnished with teeth in each jaw, one rank
behind another, like those of a shark: its feet also, different from the
rest of this kind, wanted claws; <PB N="395" REF="406"/> and the tail was
quite disengaged from the shell, and fifteen inches long, more resembling
that of a quadrupede than a tortoise. This animal was then unknown upon the
coasts of France; and was supposed to have been brought into the European
seas, in some India ship that might be wrecked upon her return. Since
that, how∣ever, two or three of these animals have been taken upon the
coasts; two in particular upon those of Cornwall, in the year 1756, the
largest of which weighed eight hundred pounds; and one upon the Isle of
Rhea, but two years before that, weighed between seven and eight hun∣dred.
One, most probably of this kind also, was caught about thirty years ago
near Scar∣borough, and a good deal of company was in∣vited to feast upon it:
a gentleman, who was one of the guests, told the company that it was a
Mediterranean turtle, and not wholesome; but a person who was willing to
satisfy his appe∣tite at the risque of his life, eat of it: he was seized
with a violent vomiting and purging; but his constitution overpowered the
malignity of the poison.</P>
<P>These are a formidable and useless kind, if compared to
the turtle caught in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean. These are of
different kinds; not only unlike each other <PB N="396" REF="407"/> in form, but
furnishing man with very different advantages. They are usually
distinguished by sailors into four kinds; the Trunk Turtle, the
Loggerhead, the Hawksbill, and the Green Turtle.</P>
<P>The Trunk Turtle is commonly larger than the rest, and its
back higher and rounder. The flesh of this is rank, and not very
wholesome.</P>
<P>The Loggerhead is so called from the large∣ness of its
head, which is much bigger in pro∣portion than that of the other kinds. The
flesh of this also is very rank, and not eaten but in case of
necessity.</P>
<P>The Hawksbill Turtle is the least of the four, and has a
long and small mouth, somewhat re∣sembling the bill of an hawk. The
flesh of this also is very indifferent eating; but the shell serves for
the most valuable purposes. This is the animal that supplies the
tortoise-shell of which such a variety of beautiful trinkets are made.
The substance of which the shells of other turtles are composed, is
thin and porous; but that of the hawksbill is firm, and, when po∣lished, is
beautifully marbled. They generally carry about three pounds; but the largest
of all six pounds. The shell consists, as in all the kind, of thirteen
leaves or plates, of which eight are flat, and five hollow. They are raised
and <PB N="397" REF="408"/> taken off by means of fire, which is made under
under the shell after the flesh is taken out. As soon as the heat affects
the leaves, they start from the ribs, and are easily raised with the
point of a knife. By being scraped and polished on both sides, they
become beautifully transparent; or are easily cast into what form the
workman thinks proper, by making them soft and pliant in warm water, and then
screwing them in a mold, like a medal: however, the shell is most
beau∣tiful before it undergoes this last operation.</P>
<P>But of all animals of the tortoise kind, the green turtle is
the most noted, and the most valuable. The delicacy of its flesh, and its
nutritive qualities, together with the property of being easily digested,
were, for above a century, known only to our sea-men and the inhabitants of
the coasts where they were taken. It was not till by slow degrees the
distinction came to be made between such as were malignant and such as
were wholesome. The controversies and contradictions of our old travellers
were nu∣merous upon this head; some asserting, that the turtle was
delicious food; and others, that it was actual poison. Dampier, that rough
sea-man, who has added more to natural history than half of the
philosophers that went before him, appears to be the first who informed us 
<PB N="398" REF="409"/> of their distinctions; and that, while the rest
might be valuable for other purposes, the green turtle alone was chiefly
prized for the delicacy of its flesh. He never imagined, however, that this
animal would make its way to the lux∣urious tables of Europe; for he seems
chiefly to recommend it as salted up for ship's provi∣sion, in case of
necessity.</P>
<P>At present the turtle is very well known among us; and is
become the favourite food of those that are desirous of eating a great deal
without the danger of surfeiting. This is a property the flesh of the
turtle seems peculiarly possessed of; and by the importation of it
alive among us, gluttony is freed from one of its greatest restraints. The
flesh of turtle is become a branch of commerce; and therefore ships are
provided with conveniences for sup∣plying them with water and provision, to
bring them over in health from Jamaica and other West India islands. This,
however, is not al∣ways effected; for though they are very viva∣cious, and
scarce require any provision upon the voyage, yet, by the working of the
ship and their beating against the sides of the boat that contains them,
they become battered and lean; so that to eat this animal in the highest
perfection, instead of bringing the turtle to <PB N="399" REF="410"/> the
epicure, he ought to be transported to the turtle.</P>
<P>This animal is called the green turtle, from the colour of its
shell, which is rather greener than that of others of this kind. It is
ge∣nerally found about two hundred weight; though some are five hundred, and
others not above fifty. Dampier tells us of one that was seen at Port Royal
in Jamaica, that was six feet broad across the back: he does not tell us
its other dimensions; but says, that the son of Captain Roach, a boy
about ten years old, sailed in the shell, as in a boat, from the shore to
his father's ship, which was above a quarter of a mile from land. But this is
nothing to the size of some turtles the ancients speak of. Aelian
assures us, that the houses in the Island of Taprobane are usually
covered with a single shell. Diodorus Siculus tells us, that a people
neighbouring on Ethiopia, called the Turtle-eaters, coasted along the shore
in boats made of the upper shell of this animal; and that in war, when they
had eaten the flesh, the covering served them as a tent. In this account,
Pliny, and all the rest of the ancients agree; and as they had frequent
oppor∣tunities of knowing the truth, we are not lightly to contradict their
testimony.</P>
<P>At present, however, they are not seen of 
<PB N="400" REF="411"/> such amazing dimensions. We are told, by Laet, that
on the Isle of Cuba they grow to such a size, as that five men can
stand on the back of one of them together; and what is more surprizing
still, that the animal does not seem overloaded, but will go off with them
upon its back, with a slow steady motion, towards the sea.</P>
<P>They are found in the greatest numbers on the Island of
Ascension; where, for several years, they were taken to be salted to
feed the slaves, or for a supply of ship's provision. Their value at
present seems to be better known.</P>
<P>This animal seldom comes from the sea but to deposit its
eggs, and now and then to sport in fresh-water. Its chief food is a
submarine plant, that covers the bottom of several parts of the sea not
far from the shore. There the turtles are seen, when the weather is fair,
feeding in great numbers, like flocks of sheep, several fa∣thoms deep upon
the verdant carpet below. At other times they go to the mouths of rivers, as
they seem to find gratification in fresh∣water. After some time thus
employed, they seek their former stations; and when done feeding, they
generally float with their heads above water, unless they are alarmed by the
approach of hunters or birds of prey, in which <PB N="401" REF="412"/> case
they suddenly plunge to the bottom. They often seek their provision among
the rocks, feeding upon moss and sea-weed; and it is pro∣bable will not
disdain to prey upon insects and other small animals, as they are very
fond of flesh when taken and fed for the table.</P>
<P>At the time of breeding, they are seen to forsake their
former haunts and their food, and to take sometimes a voyage of nine hundred
miles to deposite their eggs on some favourite shore. The coasts they
always resort to upon these occasions are those that are low, flat, and
sandy; for being heavy animals, they cannot climb a bold shore; nor is any
bed so proper as sand to lay their eggs on. They couple in March, and
continue united till May; during a great part of which time they are seen
locked toge∣ther, and almost incapable of separation. The female seems
passive and reluctant; but the male grasps her with his claws in such a
manner, that nothing can induce him to quit his hold. It would seem that the
grasp, as in frogs, is in some measure convulsive, and that the animal
is unable to relax its efforts.</P>
<P>When the time for laying approaches, the female is seen
towards the setting of the sun drawing near the shore, and looking
earnestly about her, as if afraid of being discovered. 
<PB N="402" REF="413"/> When she perceives any person on shore, she
seeks for another place; but if otherwise, she lands when it is dark, and
goes to take a survey of the sand where she designs to lay. Having
marked the spot, she goes back without laying for that night, to the ocean
again; but the next night returns to deposite a part of her burthen. She
begins by woking and digging in the sand with her fore-feet till she has
made a round hole, a foot broad and a foot and an half deep, just at the
place a little above where the water reaches highest. This done, she lays
eighty or ninety eggs at a time, each as big as a hen's egg, and as round as a
ball. She continues laying about the space of an hour; during which time, if
a cart were driven over her, she would not be induced to stir. The eggs are
covered with a tough white skin, like wetted parchment. When she has done
laying, she covers the hole so dexterously, that it is no easy matter
to find the place; and these must be accustomed to the search to make
the discovery. When the turtle has done laying she returns to the sea,
and leaves her eggs to be hatched by the heat of the sun. At the end of
fifteen days she lays about the same number of eggs again; and at the end
of ano∣ther fifteen days she repeats the same; three <PB N="403" REF="414"/>
times in all, using the same precautions every time for their
safety..</P>
<P>In about twenty-four or twenty-five days after laying, the
eggs are hatched by the heat of the sun; and the young turtles, being about
as big as quails, are seen bursting from the sand, as if earth-born, and
running directly to the sea, with instinct only for their guide: but, to
their great misfortune, it often happens that, their strength being small,
the surges of the sea, for some few days, beat them back upon the
shore. Thus exposed, they remain a prey to thousands of birds that then
haunt the coasts; and these stooping down upon them carry off the
greatest part, and sometimes the whole brood, before they have strength
sufficient to withstand the waves, or dive to the bottom. Helbigius informs
us, that they have still another enemy to fear, which is no other than the
parent that produced them, that waits for their arrival at the edge of the
deep, and devours as many as she can. This circumstance however demands
further confirmation; though nothing is more certain than that the crocodile
acts in the same unnatural manner.</P>
<P>When the turtles have done laying they then return to their
accustomed places of feeding. <PB N="404" REF="415"/> Upon their out-set to
the shore, where they breed, they are always found fat and healthy; but upon
their return, they are weak, lean, and unfit to be eaten. They are seldom,
therefore, molested upon their retreat; but the great art is to seize them
when arrived, or to intercept their arrival. In these uninhabited islands,
to which the green turtle chiefly resorts, the men that go to take them land
about night-fall, and without making any noise (for those animals, though
without any external opening of the ear, hear very distinctly, there being an
auditory conduit that opens into the mouth) lie close while they see the
female turtle coming on shore. They let her proceed to her greatest
distance from the sea; and then, when she is most busily employed in
scratching a hole in the sand, they sally out and surprize her. Their
manner is to turn her upon her back, which utterly incapacitates her from
moving; and yet, as the creature is very strong and struggles very hard,
two men find it no easy matter to lay her over. When thus secured they go
to the next; and in this manner, in less than three hours, they have been
known to turn forty or fifty turtles, each of which weighs from an hundred and
fifty to two hun∣dred pounds. Labat assures us that when 
<PB N="405" REF="416"/> the animal is in this helpless situation, it is
heard to sigh very heavily, and even to shed tears.</P>
<P>At present, from the great appetite that man has
discovered for this animal, they are not only thinned in their numbers, but
are also grown much more shy. There are several other ways, therefore,
contrived for taking them. One is, to seize them when coupled together, at
the breeding season, when they are very easily approached, and as
easily seen; for these ani∣mals, though capable of living for some time
under water, yet rise every eight or ten minutes to breathe. As soon as
they are thus perceived, two or three people draw near them in a canoe, and
slip a nooze either round their necks or one of their feet. If they have no
line, they lay hold of them by the neck, where they have no shell, with their
hands only; and by this means they usually catch them both to∣gether. But
sometimes the female escapes, being more shy than the male.</P>
<P>Another way of taking them is by the har∣poon, either when
they are playing on the sur∣face of the water, or feeding on the bottom; when
the harpoon is skilfully darted, it sticks fast in the shell of the
back; the wood then disengages from the iron, and the line is long 
<PB N="406" REF="417"/> enough for the animal to take its range; for if the
Harpooner should attempt at once to draw the animal into his boat till it is
weakened by its own struggling, it would probably get free. Thus the turtle
struggles hard to get loose, but all in vain; for they take care the line
fastened to the harpoon shall be strong enough to hold it.</P>
<P>There is yet another way which, though seemingly awkward, is
said to be attended with very great success. A good diver places
him∣self at the head of the boat; and when the turtles are observed, which
they sometimes are in great numbers, asleep on the surface, he
im∣mediately quits the vessel, at about fifty yards distance, and keeping
still under water, directs his passage to where the turtle was seen,
and, coming up beneath, seizes it by the tail; the animal awaking,
struggles to get free; and by this both are kept at the surface until the
boat arrives to take them in.</P>
