<HEAD><PB REF="4"/>THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND, IN A SERIES of LETTERS.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>EVER did Monarch come to the throne of England with a greater
va∣riety of favourable concurrences than Charles I. He found himself
possessed of a peaceful and flourishing king∣dom, his right
undisputed by any ri∣val claimant, strengthened by an alliance with one of
the most powerful Monarchs that ever reigned in France, whose sister he
had married; and, to add to all this, he was loved by his subjects, whom he
had won by his virtues and address.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5"/> But this was but a flattering prospect; the
spirit of liberty was rouzed, and was resolved to oppose the ancient
claims of Monarchs, who usurped their power in times of ignorance or danger,
confirmed it by laws, and continued it by long prescription. Charles had
been, from his infancy, taught to con∣sider the royal privileges as sacred
pledges, which it was his duty to defend: his father had implanted the
doctrines of hereditary and indefeasible right early upon his mind. James
only defended those doctrines by words, and it was soon the fate of Charles
to assert them by action. It is the duty of every So∣vereign to consider
the genius and disposition of his people, as a father does that of his
children, and to adapt his government to each conjuncture. Charles mistook
that genius; he wanted to govern a people who had, for some time, learned to
be free by maxims and precedents, that had their origin in times of ignorance
and slavery.</P>
<P>He therefore began his reign with two of the most difficult
projects that could be conceived; the one to succour the Protestants in
Germany against the Emperor and Duke of Bavaria; the other to keep the royal
prerogatives entire, without a national standing army. In order to effect
these purposes, the house of commons was to be managed, who, as I have
already described, from being the oppressed par∣ty, were now willing, in
turn, to become oppres∣sors; who, from a detestation of Popery, had now
overshot the mark, and were become Puritans. His first demand for the
necessary supplies to carry on the war of the Palatinate in Germany,
though un∣dertaken at their own request, was answered with a petition for
punishing Papists, and for an examina∣tion into the grievances of the
nation. Buckingham, who had been the late King's favourite, and who was still
more caressed by the present Monarch, did not escape their censures:
instead of granting the <PB N="3" REF="6"/> sums requisite, they employed
the time in vain dis∣putations and complaints, till the season for
prose∣cuting the intended campaign was elapsed. The King, therefore, at
length wearied with their de∣lays, and offended at their contempt of his
demands, thought proper to dissolve a parliament which he could not bring
to reason. In fact, the commons, at this time, complained of imaginary
grievances, but the time was approaching when their complaints were to become
real.</P>
<P>The ministers of the King had not yet forgot that kind of tax
which was called a benevolence, and which had been often exacted from the
subject in former reigns. Charles thought to avail himself of this method
of procuring money, but at the same time coloured it over with a greater
appearance of justice than any of his predecessors. He therefore
determined to borrow money of such persons as were best able to lend, to
whom, for this purpose, he di∣rected letters, mentioning the sum. With this
the people reluctantly complied; it was, in fact, a griev∣ance, though
authorised by a thousand precedents; but no precedent can give sanction
to injustice. With this money a fleet was equipped and sent against
Spain, but which returned without procuring either glory or advantage.</P>
<P>This ineffectual expedition demanded to be re∣paired by a new
supply greater than what extorted loans could produce, and another parliament
was called for this purpose. The new parliament, upon this occasion,
seemed even more refractory than the former, and appeared more willing to
make or to com∣plain of grievances than to grant money: but chiefly their
resentment was directed against Buckingham, the royal favourite. Whenever
the subjects attack the royal prerogative, they begin with the favourites of
the crown; and wise Princes, sensible of this, sel∣dom have any.
Charles was not possessed of the <PB N="4" REF="7"/> art of making a
distinction between friends and mini∣sters; whoever was his favourite him
he always en∣trusted with the administration of affairs; he loved
Buckingham, and undertook to defend him: to defend this nobleman was to share
his reproach; two mem∣bers of the house of commons, Diggs and Elliot,
un∣dertook to accuse him. The purport of the charge a∣mounted to little more
than that he had engrossed too much power for himself and his relations,
and that he had applied a plaister to the late King's side which was
supposed to be poisonous. They inveighed against the Duke from this
frivolous accusation, and the King, in a passion, ordered them both to
the Tower. This was an open act of violence, and should have been
supported, or ever performed. The commons exclaimed, that their privileges
were infringed; they protested that neither of the members had spoken any
thing disrespectful of his Majesty, and began to publish their
vindication. The King, who was ever ready to enter upon harsh measures, but
not to sup∣port them, released the two members, and this com∣pliance
confirmed that obstinacy which his former injury had contributed to raise.
The Earl of Arun∣del, for being guilty of the same offence in the house of
Lords, was imprisoned and dismissed in the same manner by the King.
The two houses having in this manner answered the royal demands for mo∣ney,
the King, rather than give up the Duke, chose to be without the supply, and
therefore once more dissolved the parliament.</P>
<P>He had now a war to maintain, which he was engaged in by the advice
of those very members who refused to contribute to its support; besides
this, he was to put the kingdom in a proper posture of de∣fence, and he
wanted money to execute these pur∣poses. To furnish the proper supplies
he again had recourse to loans, and to granting protections to the Papists,
for stipulated sums of money: such as re∣fused <PB N="5" REF="8"/> had
soldiers billetted upon them, contrary to the customs of England; and even
some were en∣rolled for soldiers themselves. Persons of birth and rank
were summoned to appear before the council, and, upon their persisting in
a refusal, were put into confinement. We now once more perceive the seeds
of discord beginning to shoot forth: we now see, as in every other civil
war, both parties guilty of in∣justice, yet on either side that injustice
arising from principles of virtue; the one actuated by the inhe∣rent
liberties of mankind, the other by the prescrip∣tive privileges of the crown:
such is the general lot of humanity, to have their actions degenerate from
the producing motives.</P>
<P>The King, now finding that nothing but the pros∣pect of immediate
danger could induce some future parliament to provide necessary
supplies, was resolved to make a rupture with France, a war against which
had ever been an expedient of producing unanimity at home. With this view he
sent out Buckingham with a fleet to relieve Rochelle, a maritime town in that
kingdom, which had long enjoyed its privileges independent of the French King,
and which he was now actually preparing to deprive them of. This expedition was
equally fruitless with that to the coasts of Spain; the Duke knew nothing
of the art of war, and consumed his time in besieging a little fort in the
isle of Rhee, from whence he was driven with the loss of half his army. The
bad success of this served to render the unfortunate Duke still more
obnoxious, and the King more needy; another parliament was therefore called,
and a supply demanded in the usual form. The commons, in the first
parliament, had begun with fictitious grievances, but their refusing then to
contribute the supplies soon introduced an actual abuse of power, and
rendered the King un∣just, who, probably, only desired to be easy. He
ex∣torted supplies, and imprisoned the refractory. The <PB N="6" REF="9"/>
complaints of the commons were now real; their members had been imprisoned,
loans had been ex∣torted; a tax upon merchandize, called tonnage and poundage,
had been exacted without parliamentary authority; and, last of all, the Duke
of Bucking∣ham was still suffered to rule the councils of the King, and
inflame every proceeding. In this situa∣tion they seemed, as usual,
resolved to grant no mo∣ney till their grievances were redressed, and
till the King had given a positive assurance to maintain the liberties of
the subject. The King promised both, and they voted him a liberal supply,
upon which they were prorogued, as was customary. This fresh supply
enabled his Majesty to make another attempt to relieve Rochelle, and the Duke
of Buckingham was again to have the command: Buckingham had ever be∣haved with
some haughtiness, as being secure of the King's protection; but his
greatest fault seemed to be too large a share of power, which gave
offence to every order. It is the aim of all malecontents in a state rather
to bring the great down to their own level, than to exalt the inferior order to
theirs: and this might be a motive to the lords and commons for attempting to
retrench Buckingham's power. The clamour raised against him in the house
was not lost among the people; they re-echoed it from one to the other, and
the Duke had a million of foes only from his seeming prosperity. Among this
number was one John Felton, an Irishman, a lieutenant in the army; this man
was naturally melancholy, cou∣rageous, and enthusiastic; he felt for his
country as if labouring under a calamity which he thought it in the power of
his single arm to remove: he resolved to kill the Duke, and thus to do a
service both to God and man. Animated with mistaken patriotism and gloomy
zeal, he reached Portsmouth, where the Duke was then, surrounded with his
levee, giving the necessary orders to embark. Felton came up a∣mong 
<PB N="7" REF="10"/> the crowd and stabbed him with a long knife to the heart;
the Duke instantly fell dead, and Fel∣ton walked composedly away; but his
hat had fallen off while he was striking the blow, and this produced his
discovery. He disdained denying a murder in which he gloried, and averred
that he looked upon the Duke as an enemy to his country, and, as such,
deserving to suffer. We shall see through the course of this reign
several instances of great virtues and enormous vices, for the genius of
England was at this time arrived at its highest pitch.</P>
<P>The expedition to Rochelle again returned with∣out success, as
if it had been ordered by fate that no∣thing was to put the people into good
humour. The contest therefore between privilege and prerogative was now
carried on with the same acrimony as be∣fore. Tonnage and poundage was
exacted by the King as a right belonging to the crown, and refused by the
merchants as a tax that could only be granted by the people. The parliament was
called to deter∣mine the dispute, but, instead of discussing that
ar∣gument, they entered upon disputes about religion. The house was
mostly composed of Puritans, and such were for abolishing Episcopacy,
and persecuting Papists. They were freed from Buckingham; but there was
another favourite whom they dreaded still more, Laud Archbishop of
Canterbury, a great fa∣vourer of the opinion of <HI>Divine right,</HI> and
firmly attached to the rites of the church as then establish∣ed. They
seemed willing to allow the King no fa∣vourite, and therefore loudly murmured
against this Bishop. Their indignation, however, was, for a while, called
off to another object, which was con∣sidered as a new act of violence in the
King. His customhouse officers had seized upon the goods of one or two
merchants who refused to pay tonnage and poundage. The Judges, in the former
reign of James I, had adjudged this tax to belong to the <PB N="8" REF="11"/>
crown without consent of parliament. The former reign therefore had been the
proper time for disput∣ing the King's right, but the commons had then not
so much power, or such a spirit of resistance as now. They were now
perfectly sensible of their own strength, and were resolved to fix the
limits between the King and the people. They therefore boldly and warmly
remonstrated against the King's proceeding; and he in return imprisoned
four of the members, and dis∣solved the parliament. These were the
causes which soon after overturned the state, and laid the throne in
blood.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>AMonarchical government has ever been looked upon as best, when
wisely administered. We are so constituted by nature that some are
born to command, and others to obey. In a republic, how free soever, the
people cannot govern themselves, and their leaders must be tyrants over
their own narrow circle of subjects. In a monarchy the Governor is placed at
a distance from the many, as he is but one; in a republic the tyrants are
near, because they are many. In the former the people are subject to
oppression from errors of will; in the latter, to be harrassed by the
rigours of the law: in a mo∣narchy the redress of grievances is speedy; in
a re∣public, dilatory and uncertain: in the one, punish∣ments are few; in the
other, severe and numerous, from the debility of the constitution.</P>
<P>The present parliament, seemed not so intent upon abridging
the King's power, as upon en∣tirely abolishing it; they were Calvinists,
and it is <PB N="9" REF="12"/> the spirit of Calvinism to throw off the
restraints of royalty. The English had lately seen this happily effected
in Switzerland and Holland, and, influ∣enced by such examples, seemed
desirous of imita∣tion.</P>
<P>You have seen the King and the English parlia∣ment now almost
prepared for an open rupture; still, however, the commons kept within the
bounds of humble remonstrance, and, while they refused his Majesty's
demands, asked pardon for their delay. They had still a respect for their
Monarch, which even their republican principles could not entirely efface; and,
though they were willing to wound, yet they feared to strike an open blow.
The Scotch soon set them an example of resistance; they had, in that
kingdom, long embraced the Calvinistical doctrines; and, though they still
had Bishops, these were reduced to poverty, and treated with contempt.
James I. attempted to exalt the Bishops, and to introduce the rites and the
liturgy of the church of England among them, but died in the midst of his
endeavours. Charles, therefore, was resolved to complete what his father had
begun. This unnecessary and ill∣judged attempt alienated the affections of
his Scotoh subjects. The sedition past from city to city; the
Calvinists formed a league, as if all the laws, divine and human, were
infringed; while the desire in the court party of supporting their
commands, and, in the people, of defending their religion, soon, excited,
actually, in Scotland, those dangers which in Eng∣land were, as yet, only
apprehended.</P>
<P>In such a situation the King could only repress the
presumption of his Scotch subjects by the assist∣ance of those of
England; but he had lately dissolu∣ed his parliament, and seemed no way
disposed to call another; he had cut off the sources of every supply in
cases of emergency, and fondly hoped he <PB N="10" REF="13"/> could govern by
merely the terror of royalty. His favourites helped to confirm his errors; they
were fond of arbitrary power, because they shared its in∣dulgences; the
privy council considered itself as absolute; the Star-Chamber, as it was
called, se∣verely punished all who denied the prerogative royal; the High
Commission court now turned from defend∣ing the Papists against the
Puritans, whom they justly feared, as tinctured with the spirit of
resist∣ance. The very Judges also, being chosen by the court, were
entirely devoted to the King; so that all conspired to lift him above
justice, and induced him to call parliaments no more, whose maxims of
go∣vernment he found diametrically opposite to his own.</P>
<P>He was therefore resolved to fix upon other me∣thods of raising
money: methods indeed which were practised by his predecessors, but at
times when they had power to controll even justice, and force to com∣pel
their subjects to obey. Charles, in the midst of a civil war in Scotland,
and the discontents of his people at home, at a time when one half of his
sub∣jects were preaching sedition, and the other half were learning to
despise Kings; without army, and without treasures; resolved to reign
with arbitrary power.</P>
<P>With the taxes which he levied without parlia∣ments in England, he
undertook to bring about the reformation in Scotland; and therefore began, as
his parliament was now no more, to collect a tax upon the subject called
<HI>Ship-money.</HI> This is that fa∣mous tax which first rouzed a whole
nation, after an unsettled constitution of more than a thousand years, at
length to fix and determine the bounds of their own freedom, and the King's
prerogative.</P>
<P>To give a sanction to the royal orders, this tax was backed by the
opinion of all the Judges, who voted it to be customary and legal. Their
opinion <PB N="11" REF="14"/> will, at once, serve to explain the nature of
this tax, and what they judged concerning it. It ran thus, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>We, every man by himself, and all of us
together, have taken into serious consideration the case and question
concerning Ship-money; and it is our opinion, that when the good and safety
of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the Kingdom in danger, that your
Majesty may, by writ under the great seal of England, command all your
subjects of this your kingdom, at their charge, to provide and furnish
such number of ships with men, victuals, and ammunition, and for such
time as your Majesty shall think fit, for the defence and safety of this
Kingdom from such danger and peril: And that, by law, your Majesty may
compel the doing thereof, in case of refusal or refractoriness: And we
are also of opinion, that in such case your Majesty is the sole judge
both of the danger, and when and how the same is to he prevented and avoided,
&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>An order from the throne, thus backed by the opi∣nion of all the
Judges, it was thought, would be, at once, complied with; but the King was
deceived. A private man, of courage and integrity, one John Hampden, stood
forth as a champion for the people, and refused to pay a tax not authorized
by parlia∣ment. The sum at which he was rated amounted to but twenty
shillings, yet he refused to contribute even this, and brought his cause
before the court of Exchequer. Never was a greater cause argued in any court
before. The Judges, by their sentence, were to determine whether the nation,
and their posterity, were to be subject to arbitrary power, or to enjoy
freedom. The Judges determined in favour of servitude; Hampden was cast;
and this only served to increase the discontents of the people.</P>
<P>The discontent and opposition the King found among his English
subjects, one would have thought, might serve to repress his ardour for
reformation in the religion of Scotland. Having published an or∣der 
<PB N="12" REF="15"/> for reading the liturgy in the principal church in
Edinburgh, the people received it with clamours and imprecations; the
court-party blamed their obstinacy, as the innovations were trifling; but
this was re∣torted against themselves with still greater force, for
labouring so earnestly at the establishment of trifles. The sedition
in that kingdom, which had hitherto been secret, was now kept concealed no
longer; rebellion had, as it were, set up its standard amongst them. Yet
still the King could not resolve to desist from his design; and so
prepossessed was he in favour of royal right, that he thought the very
name of a King would influence them to return to duty. He was soon
undeceived; the Scotch Calvinists, whose principles were republican,
entered into a covenant to suppress the Bishops, and resist the
King's autho∣rity. This was judged an open declaration of war, and Charles
summoned the Nobility of England, who held lands of the crown, to furnish a
proper number of forces to suppress them. To add to his supplies, he
demanded a voluntary contribution from the Clergy, and by means of his Queen
the Catholics also were pressed for their assistance. By these
me∣thods he found himself at the head of an undisci∣plined and reluctant
army, amounting to about twenty thousand men, commanded by Generals more
willing to negotiate than to fight. However, his superiority of number gave
him a manifest advan∣tage over the malecontents, who were not slow in
marching to oppose him. Charles had inherited the peaceful disposition of
his father; he was unwilling to come to extremities, although a blow, then
struck with vigour, might have prevented many of his suc∣ceeding
misfortunes. Instead of fighting, he entered upon a treaty; a
suspension was concluded upon, and terms agreed to, that neither side
intended to preserve. This suspension, and disbanding the ar∣mies, 
<PB N="13" REF="16"/> was a fatal step to the King; the Scotch forces could be
again mustered at pleasure; the English troops, not without time,
difficulty, and expence. Of this the malecontents were sensible, and the
ne∣gotiations met with obstructions in proportion as they were confident of
their power. In short, after much altercation, and many treaties signed,
and broken, both parties once more resolved upon a war.</P>
<P>War being resolved on, the King now took every method to raise
money for maintaining it. <HI>Ship-money</HI> was levied as before; some
other arbitrary taxes were exacted with great severity; but one method of
in∣creasing supplies reflects immortal honour upon those who granted
them. His counsellors and servants lent the King whatever sums they could
spare, and dis∣tressed their private fortunes to serve the state.
Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Marquis of Ha∣milton, contributed
very large sums; but particular∣ly Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, gave
his Majesty twenty thousand pounds. Wentworth was one of those great
characters which marked those celebrated times. Upon his first appearance
in the state he was foremost in the opposition to the crown; but, finding
his confederates had mixed a spirit of en∣thusiasm with their regards for
liberty, he left their side to take that of the King, which he fancied in
greatest danger. He was brave, wise, and loyal, and followed the King from
principle, yet without en∣tirely approving his conduct.</P>
<P>These were the resources of the crown to prepare for a Scotch
war, but they were still insufficient; and there was but one method more to
furnish larger supplies, namely, by calling a parliament. It was now eleven
years since Charles had called any. The ungovernable spirit of the last
had taught him to hate and to fear such an assembly. His wants, how∣ever,
at length, induced him to constrain his indig∣nation, <PB N="14" REF="17"/>
and, by the advice of his Council, he called another, the members of which were
still more tur∣bulent than the former, as they now had still stronger
reasons for their discontent. The house of com∣mons could not be induced
to treat the Scotch, who were of the same principles, and contended for the
same cause, as their enemies. They looked upon them as friends and
brothers, who only rose to teach them how to defend their privileges. The
King could reap no other fruits, therefore, from this as∣sembly, but
murmurings and complaints; every me∣thod he had taken to supply himself
with money was declared an abuse. Tonnage and poundage, ship∣money, the
sale of monopolies, the billetting sol∣diers upon the citizens were all
voted stretches at ar∣bitrary power. The Star-chamber gave particular
offence, and instead of subsidies the house presented the King with
nothing but their grievances. Charles once more dissolved this parliament,
and thus aggra∣vated the discontents of the people.</P>
<P>He had now made enemies of the Scotch nation, and of the commons of
England; it remained to of∣fend the city of London; upon their refusing to
lend him a sum of money to carry on the war, he sued them in the
Star-chamber for some lands in Ireland, and made them pay a considerable
fine. He conti∣nued to exact all the taxes against which the parlia∣ment had
so frequently remonstrated; even had he been despotic, such a conduct
would have shook him on the throne; but, limited as he was, it served to
complete his overthrow. He could expect little assistance from England;
and the Scotch, sensible of their own influence in that part of his
dominions, led an army of twenty thousand men as far as New∣castle upon
Tyne, in order to seize upon, or to de∣throne him. Having thus prepared his
misfortunes, he found himself again obliged to call the last parlia∣ment,
which completed his ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"/> Instead of granting money, this new
parliament, as all the rest had done, began by demanding to have their
grievances redressed; they desired an abo∣lition of the Star chamber;
exclaimed against arbi∣trary taxes, and particularly ship-money; and, in
fine, demanded that a new parliament should be called every three years.
Charles was now obliged to grant those demands from necessity, which in
the beginning of his reign he might have bestowed as a favour. He expected to
regain his authority by complying, but he was deceived; nothing could satisfy
the commons but the total abolition of his power. He expected that his
English subjects would repress the inso∣lence of those of Scotland,
but had the mortifica∣tion to find the house of commons approve their
conduct, and repay their irruption with a reward of three hundred thousand
pounds. He hoped to repress the Puritanical party in England, but found, to
his surprize, almost the whole house of commons of that persuasion.
He loved the Earl of Strafford with ten∣derness, and esteemed his wisdom;
and the house of commons, conscious of his regards, accused the Earl of
high treason. When we attempt innovation, we seldom know how far our
schemes will extend at last. This parliament began with redressing
grievances; they proceeded to reform the state, and ended in to∣tally
destroying the constitution.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER. III.</HEAD>
<P>IN treating of a subject, in which almost every Englishman is
partial, it is no easy matter to avoid falling into their errors; but, I have
labour∣ed to view this part of our history, without receiving any biass
from party; and our constitution is now sufficiently established,
whatever we may think of this Monarch's equity, or his subjects resolution.
Our laws, at present, differ both from what Charles endeavoured to maintain,
and what his parliaments pretended to enact: we now are all agreed, that the
unlimited power arrogated on one side, and the tu∣multuous freedom introduced
on the other, are both intolerable; yet, of the two, perhaps, despotism is
superior. In a republic, the tyrant is in our village, in our family;
perhaps, in a monarchy, he lives at a distance: the oppressions of a
Monarch are gene∣rally exerted only in the narrow sphere round him; the
oppressions of the governors of a republic, though not so flagrant, are
more universal: the Monarch is apt to commit great enormities, but they
seldom reach the multitude at humble distance from the throne; the
republican Despot oppresses the multitude that lies within the circle of
his influence: the Monarch terrifies me with great evils which I may never
feel; the Despot actually loads me with submissions, which I am
constantly obliged to sustain; and, in my opi∣nion, it is much better to
be in danger of having my head chopped off, with an ax, once in my life, than
to have my leg gauled with a continual fetter.</P>
<P>Whatever were the reasonings of the King, upon this subject, it
is certain, his actions were intended for the benefit of his subjects; but he
continued to rule them, upon the maxims of former princes, at a time that the
principles of the subjects were totally changed. The house of commons
seemed now to have thrown off all subordination; they not only ar∣raigned 
<PB N="17" REF="20"/> and attained almost all the King's mini∣sters;
particularly Laud, Strafford, Finch, and Winde∣banck; but passed an act to
make that parliament con∣tinual, until all grievances should be
redressed. The King complied with every measure, yet all his com∣pliance
only served to increase their demands. The Earl of Strafford first fell a
victim to their popular fury: the commons exhibited an accursation, of
twen∣ty-eight articles against him; the substance of which was, That he
had attempted to extend the King's authority at home, and had been guilty of
several ex∣actions in Ireland. These received the name of high treason,
and the people without demanded justice. The managers for the house of
commons pleaded, with vehemence, against him at the bar of the house of
Lords, who were his Judges: they insisted, that, though each article
seperately did not amount to a proof, yet, the whole taken together carried
convic∣tion. This is a method of arguing frequently used in the English
courts of justice, even to this day; and, perhaps, none can be more
erroneous; for almost every falshood may thus be defended by a
multiplici∣ty of weak reasons. In this tumult of aggravation and clamour, the
Earl himself, whose parts and wis∣dom had long been respected and
acknolwedged, stood unmoved. He defended his innocence with all the
presence of mind, judgment, and temper, that could be expected from innocence
and ability. His little children were placed near him, as he was thus
de∣fending his own cause, and that of his master: after he had, with a long
and eloquent speech, delivered extempore, confuted the accusation of his
enemies, he thus drew to a conclusion, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>But, my Lords, I have troubled you too long;
longer than I should have done, but, for the sake of those dear pledges,
a saint, in heaven, has left me.—</HI></Q>Upon this he paused,
dropped a tear, look∣ed upon his children, and then proceeded.—What I 
<PB N="18" REF="21"/> forfeit, for myself, is a trifle; that my
indiscretions should reach my posterity, wounds me to the heart. Pardon
my infirmity.—Something I should have added, but am not able;
therefore, let it pass. And now, my Lords, for myself, I have long been
taught, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that the affictions of this life are overpaid by
that eternal weight of glory, which awaits the innocent; and so, my Lords,
even so, with the utmost tranquility I submit my∣self to your judgment.
Whether that judgment be life, or death.</HI> TE DEUM LAUDAMUS.</Q> His
eloquence and innocence seemed to influence his Judges: the King himself
went to the house of Lords, and spoke in his defence; but the spirit of
the people was excited, and nothing, but his blood, would give them
satis∣faction. He was condemned by both houses, and nothing now remained,
but for the King to give his consent to the bill of attainder. But his
consent seemed of little consequence; the limits of royalty were long
since broken down, and imminent dangers might attend his refusal. While he
continued in this agitation of mind, not knowing how to behave, he received a
letter from the unfortunate Nobleman himself, desiring that his life might
be made the sa∣crifice of a mutual agreement between the King and the people;
adding, that to a willing mind there could be no injury. This noble instance
of gene∣rosity was but ill repaid; the King was persuaded to give his
consent; he signed the fatal bill; Straf∣ford was beheaded; and this taught
his subjects soon after to spill blood that was still more
precious.</P>
<P>The whole kingdom now seemed to be in a fer∣ment; all the
petitions of parliament, which were in reality calculated to abase the King,
were not∣withstanding drawn up with the most seeming affec∣tion and
obedience; they were constantly complain∣ing in each of these of their
fears for the church, at the very time that they were themselves labouring
its overthrow. Faction ran high. In the King's party <PB N="19" REF="22"/> there
was an ill-projected and worse conducted de∣sign of keeping the prerogative
as much untouched as ever it had been in the reigns of the most fortu∣nate
and formidable Monarchs; in the opposite par∣ty a fixed resolution of
turning the state into a re∣public, and changing the government, of the
church into that of presbytery.</P>
<P>In the midst of these troubles, the Papists of Ire∣land
fancied they found a convenient opportunity of throwing off the English yoke.
Religion and liberty often inspire the most attrocious actions; and they
did so now. The Papists took a resolution, of which we find many horrid
examples in history. They at∣tempted to cut off all the Protestants in that
king∣dom at one blow. Not less than forty thousand per∣sons fell a
sacrifice upon this occasion. In such a number of murders cruelty put on
a thousand differ∣ent shapes; rapes, burnings, and tortures were
prac∣tised in every part of that miserable island; and all the
Protestants perished who had not the good for∣tune to make early
provision for their safety. Such was the state of Ireland then, and
such was England shortly to be. The parliament took this opportunity to
blacken the King, as if he had given sanction to the Papists, and
encouraged their barbarous design; he vindicated himself with a zeal that
nothing but innocence could inspire; and tried every method of
assisting his Protestant subjects of Ireland. He even demanded
succours from the parliament of Scotland to relieve the Irish
Protestants; but they remitted him to the parliament of England, as Ireland
lay more immediately under their protection. The English house of commons
sent but feeble succours to a peo∣ple they pretended to deplore, and gave
it as a pre∣text, that the government at home was in danger.</P>
<P>They now proceeded to what they long laboured at, to establish a
republic, and destroy the rites of the <PB N="20" REF="23"/> church of
England. They signified to the King, that it was fit to have a privy council
only of their appointing. Three members of the house of com∣mons presented
this request on their knees. The King was pleased to grant all. Oliver
Cromwell, who was then in the house of commons, was heard to declare, that,
if this request was rejected, he would sell his estate, which was then
but small, and retire out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Hitherto, it is probable, both sides were actuated rather by
principle than ambition. The Bishops had hitherto adhered closely to the
King; they were not only expelled the house of Lords, but, upon
remon∣strating against this unconstitutional measure, were accused by
the house of commons of high treason, and ten of them sent to the Tower.
This spirit of epidemic rage was not confined to both houses of parliament
alone; the populace daily surrounded the place of sitting, and, with
tumultuous cries, demand∣ed justice. The apprentices, the common-council, and
the citizens of London were foremost in this struggle for liberty, as they
thought it; their prin∣ciples were sincere; for the motives of a mob, though
often wrong, are always honest. In this contest the Presbyterians, and
Cardinal Richelieu of France, were ever intriguing; both desired a civil war,
the one willing to depress the great, the other to humble the kingdom.</P>
<P>In this decline of the royal authority, the King was persuaded to
take a step which was fatal to his interests. By the advice of Lord Digby,
one of his ministers, he went himself to the house of commons, and
accused five of its members of high treason. These were the leading
members of the house, whom he thus ventured to call in question; namely,
Lord Kimbolton, Mr. Hollis, Sir Arthur Haslerig, Mr. Pym, Mr. Hampden, and
Mr. Strode. He sat, for some time, in the speaker's chair, to see if
the ac∣cused <PB N="21" REF="24"/> were present; but they had escaped a
few mi∣nutes before his entry; and the house of commons was resolved to
support the cause. Disappointed, perplexed, unknowing whom to rely on,
the King went next to the common-council of the city, and made his complaint to
them; the common-council only answered by aggravating his former
misconduct. From thence he went to Windsor, where, reflecting upon the
rashness of his former proceeding, he wrote to the parliament, informing
them, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that he desisted from his proceedings
aginst the accused members, and as∣suring the parliament, that upon all
occasions he would be as careful of their privileges as of his life or his
crown.</HI></Q> His violence (as a fine writer remarks) had first ren∣dered
him hateful to his common,s and his submis∣sion now contemptible.</P>
<P>The commons had already stripped the King of al∣most all his
privileges; the power of appointing go∣vernors, generals, and levying armies,
still remain∣ed. They therefore proceeded to petition, that the Tower might
be put into their hands; that Hull, Portsmouth, and the fleet, should be
commanded by persons of their chusing. These requests were, at first,
contested, and then complied with; at last the commons desired to have a
militia raised, and go∣verned by such officers and commanders as they
should nominate, under a pretext of securing them from the Irish
Papists, whom they affected to be in dread of. This was depriving the King of
even the shadow of his former power; but they had gone too far now to recede,
and feared leaving him any power, as knowing themselves the first objects
on which its vengeance might be exercised. He was willing to grant the
raising a militia, but insisted upon giving it commanders; the parliament
desired to command it for an appointed time; but the King, at last
pro∣voked to resentment, cried, they should not com∣mand it, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>no not for an hour.</HI></Q> This peremptory
refusal <PB N="22" REF="25"/> broke off all further treaty, and both sides
were now to have recourse to arms.</P>
<P>Charles retired to York, and the Queen went over to Holland, to
raise money upon the crown jewels, and provide ammunition and forces. The
parliament, in the mean time, were not idle; they knew their strength and
popularity, and published proposals for bringing in money or plate for the
de∣fence of the kingdom. But, though each side were prepared for war, yet
they took every precaution to lay the blame of the first infraction of peace
on each other. The King offered proposals to the commons which he knew they
would not accept; and they, in return, offered him nineteen propositions,
which, if complied with, would render him entirely subser∣vient to their
commands. Their import was, that the privy council, the principal officers of
state, the governors of the King's children, forts, castles, fleet, armies,
should be all appointed or governed by par∣liament; that Papists should
be punished by thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> authority;
that the church and liturgy should be re∣formed by their discretion; and
that such member<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as had been
displaced for former offences should b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> restored. These proposals, which, if they had
bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> accepted, would have moulded

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>IN this detail of public calamities you are not
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> expect any great strokes,
either in politics <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> war; each
party was too sincere to give much a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tention to any thing but the dictates of passion, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦thusiasm, <PB N="23" REF="26"/> or
zeal. The parliament was convinced that it drew the sword in defence of
liberty; and the King was equally stedfast in believing, that he had the
authority of Heaven for opposing their pre∣tensions. They therefore took
the field with little conduct; and courage alone in the troops generally
decided the fortune of the day.</P>
<P>The parliament, from its own authority, consti∣tuted Sir John
Hotham, a sitting member of the house of commons, governor of Hull. In this
city there was a large magazine of arms, ammunition, and provisions. The
King, sensible of the importance of the place, was desirous of securing
it for himself; he therefore approached the gates with three hun∣dred
horse, and demanded entrance. Hotham still preserved some appearance of
respect to his sove∣reign, land, on his knees, refused to admit him.
Disloyalty is ever timid in the beginning.</P>
<P>Manifestoes, on one side and the other, were now dispersed
through the whole kingdom, and the people were universally divided into two
factions, that went by the names of Royalists and Round-heads. The King
ordered the Nobility to attend his person; he procured the great seal from
London, and erected his standard at Nottingham. The people, in general,
seemed to have lost all respect to his person and go∣vernment; the laws
promulgated by parliament, without the sanction of the great seal, were
ob∣served with due obedience; and the royal standard was scarce followed
by any except a few militia. At length, however, with the succours
furnished by his Queen, and the presents of the university of Ox∣ford,
and his Clergy, he raised an army of about fourteen thousand men, commanded
by Prince Ru∣pert, a man of courage and some experience. The parliament,
which disposed of the money of the nation, had one still more numerous,
commanded <PB N="24" REF="27"/> by the Earl of Essex, who fought from
principle, and who only wished to bring the King to reason.</P>
<P>When the King advanced from Nottingham, and approached near
Shrewsbury, he drew up his little army, and made them a speech: 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>I promise,</HI> said he to the soldiers,
<HI>in the presence of Almighty God, and as I hope for his blessing and
protection, that I will ever defend the Protestant religion, and in that
religion am re∣solved to live and die. The laws of the land, and the rights
of my subjects, shall ever be the measure of my go∣vernment; and, if
Heaven prospers this little army raised for their King's defence, I
promise to rule by parliaments alone, and by every equitable
administration. When I fail in these particulars, then let me be abandoned
of men; and in this resolution I hope for the assistance of all good
men, end am confident of the protection of Providence.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Essex, on the other hand, was resolved to set up his
head-quarters at Worcester, and await the King; where, in a few days, a
skirmish ensued in favour of the Royalists; and the battle of
Edge-hill, fought some time after, seemed to confirm the King's
supe∣riority. The Queen had brought him soldiers from Holland, with
ammunition and arms, and immediately departed in order to furnish more. Yet
still the par∣liament was not discouraged; their demands seemed to
increase in proportion to their losses; and, as they were defeated in the
field, they grew more obstinate in the cabinet. They condemned of high
treason such governors of towns as gave up their fortresses to the
King; while he, on the contrary, offered new terms of peace upon every
advantage. But, though his desire to spare his subjects was laudable, as
a man, yet his long negotiations were faulty, as a warrior; he wasted that
time in altercation and proposal, which should have been employed in
vi∣gorous exertions in the field. Upon the whole, his first campaign seemed
to promise him success; his <PB N="25" REF="28"/> generals were mostly
victorious, and his army far superior to the enemy in point of discipline.
On the side of the parliament, the great Hampden was slain in the battle of
Chaldgrave-field; and on the other hand, on the King's part, the gallant Lord
Faulk∣land was killed at the battle of Newbury. These were the two
greatest, bravest, and wisest men of their time, who thus fell, as if,
by the kindness of Providence, to prevent their seeing the miseries, and
the slaughter in which their country was shortly to be involved.</P>
<P>Hampden was the person who had refused paying ship-money, and
withstood the power of the crown; his inflexible integrity gained him the
esteem even of his enemies; and his humanity and benevolence, the affection
of all that knew him more intimately.</P>
<P>But Faulkland was still a greater character than he. He added to
Hampden's severe principles all the politeness and elegance then known in
Europe. He had withstood the King while he saw him mak∣ing an ill use of
his power; but, when he perceived the design of the parliament to change
religion, he changed his side, and stedfastly attached himself to the
crown. From the beginning of the civil war his natural chearfulness and
vivacity grew clouded, and he became sad, pale, and negligent of his
per∣son; the morning of the battle it was seen he de∣sired to die, and he
professed that the miseries of his country had already almost broken
his heart. He added, that he was weary of the times, and should leave them
before night. He was shot with a mus∣quet in the belly, and his body was
the next morn∣ing found among an heap of the slain. His writings, his
justice, and his courage, deserved such a death of glory; and they lound
it. If there be happiness in death, it must be in such an end, falling in
battle for our King and our principles.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="29"/> Each battle served only to weaken the royal
party, and to unite the parliament more strongly together; the King and his
followers were held together only by secular motives; the parliament had long
been actuated by one still stronger, that of religion; this had hitherto
been the secret spring of all their com∣motions, and now they fairly threw
by the mask, united themselves to the church of Scotland, and signed the
solemn league and covenant, which esta∣blished Puritanism, and laid the
foundation of a new republic. The King, to oppose the designs of the
Westminster parliament, called one at Oxford, where it assembled; and
England now saw what it had ne∣ver before seen, two parliaments sitting
at one and the same time. From this partial parliament he re∣ceived some
supplies; after which it was prorogued, and never after convened. The war
went on with its usual fury, and skirmishes on both sides were
fre∣quent, which served to desolate the kingdom with∣out deciding victory.
Each county joined that side to which it was addicted from motives of
conviction, interest or fear; while some observed a perfect neutrality.
Several frequently petitioned for peace, the wise and the good were most
earnest in this cry; but what particularly deserved remark was, the
at∣tempt of the women of London, who, to the num∣ber of two or three
thousand, went in a body to the house of commons, earnestly demanding a
peace: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Give us those traitors,</HI> said they,
<HI>that are against peace; give them, that we may tear them in
pieces.</HI></Q> The guards found some difficulty in quelling this
insurrection, and one or two women lost their lives in the fray.</P>
<P>It is both tedious and unimproving to describe all the combats,
the battles, the skirmishes, that every day passed between either
side. What towns were be∣sieged and taken, how many killed in fight, or
what numbers died by the hand of the executioner; every civil war presents
the same picture to the imagina∣tion; <PB N="27" REF="30"/> and this was
aggravated with all the miseries of rage, resentment, and despair. All
were from principle earnestly employed in destroying the consti∣tution;
there were none of those refined understand∣ings, who, disengaged from
the prejudices of party, improved the universal prejudice of the time to
ac∣quire dominion for themselves; all were seriously, earnestly, and
blindly engaged in the favourite pur∣suit. The genius of the times was great
but irregular.</P>
<P>Among the number who most severely felt the in∣dignation of the
commons, was the famous William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury; he had been
im∣prisoned in the Tower, at the time when nine more of the Bishops were
sent there upon remonstrating to the Lords against the severity of the
lower house. When he was brought to the bar, in order to make his defence, he
spoke several hours with that cou∣rage which is the result of innocence
and integrity. The Lords, his Judges, were willing to acquit him; but the
commons were determined upon his death, and over-ruled all remonstrances made
in his favour. When brought to the scaffold, this noble divine, without any
apparent terror, made the people a long speech; he told them, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he had examined his heart, and thanked God
that he found no sins there which deserved the death he was going to
suffer. The King had been traduced by some, as labouring to introduce
Popery; but that he be∣lieved him as sound a Protestant as any man in the
kingdom; and as for parliaments, though he disliked the conduct of one or
two, yet he never designed to change the laws of the country, or the
Protestant religion."</Q> After he had prayed for a short space, the
executioner did his office at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e
blow. This man seemed born for a better on fate and better times; but all
distinctions of right and wrong were now lost in mutual animosity; and in
general the best characters on both sides were those <PB N="28" REF="31"/>
who fell victims to civil fury. He was learned, up∣right, and sincere; humble
in his private deport∣ment, but attached to trifling ceremonies, and ready to
lose his life rather than give them up.</P>
<P>The liturgy was, by a public act, abolished the day he died, as if
he had been the only obstacle to its former removal. The church of England
was rendered completely Presbyterian, to the great satis∣faction of the
Scots, and numbers of the citizens of London. An ordinance was established,
by which there should be one day in the week appointed as a fast, and the
money which was thus spared to the family, was to be paid in support of the
common cause. Thus strengthened, the parliament seem∣ed capable of
carrying on their designs in an arbitra∣ry manner; they had the Scotch to
assist them; they professed only one religion, and were united with
the bonds of mutual danger. However, from the mo∣ment they came to be all
ranked under the denomi∣nation of Presbyterians, they began again to
sepa∣rate into new parties, as if divisions were necessary to the
existence of this parliament; one part of the house were Presbyterians,
strictly so called; the other Independants, a new sect that had lately
been intro∣duced, and gained ground surprisingly. The differ∣ence between
these two sects would hardly be worth mentioning, did not their religious
opinions influ∣ence their political conduct. The church of Eng∣land, which was
now totally abolished, had appoint∣ed Bishops and a book of common prayer;
the Presbyterians exclaimed against both; they were for having the church
governed by clergymen elected by the people. The Independants went yet still
far∣ther, and excluded all clergy; they maintained that every man might pray in
public, exhort his audi∣ence, and explain the scriptures; but their chief
dif∣ference lay in acknowledging no subordination in se∣cular employments,
and attempting to maintain an <PB N="29" REF="32"/> ideal equality, to which
they justly observed that every man was born. Were such a plan of
govern∣ment practicable, it would no doubt be the most happy; but the wise
and powerful must ever govern over ignorance and debility, and the bad
success of their schemes, soon after carried into execution, shewed
how ill adapted they were to human infir∣mity. Possessed, however, with
an high opinion of their speculative scheme, they behaved with that
mo∣rose and sullen carriage which is ever the result of narrow manners
and solitary thinking. They se∣cretly laboured the abasement of the
Presbyterians, yet joined them in their efforts to depress the King.</P>
<P>Charles, now perceiving the parliaments of England and Scotland
united against him, and fearing to fall under their united efforts, thought
proper to make a truce with the Papists of Ireland, in order to bring ever
the English troops who served in that kingdom. By this means he not only
had many of the English troops that served there, but also several of
the native Irish who came to increase his army. It was then the parliament
complained with truth of his employ∣ing Papists in his service, and still
farther extended their reproach by saying that he encouraged them to re∣bel.
These troops, however, only served to procure the hatred of his subjects,
without strengthening his army. They were totally routed by Fairfax, one of
the generals of the parliament army, and slaughtered without mercy after a
submission. It was said, that several Irish women were found among
the slain, who with long knives did considerable execution; but the
animosity of the English against those wretches, at that time, might
have given rise to the calumny.</P>
<P>One misfortune now seemed to follow close upon another: Prince
Rupert, who had long sustained the honour of the royal arms, was defeated
at York, and his army dispersed by Fairfax. Charles had retired to Oxford;
his present danger excited his friends to <PB N="30" REF="33"/> new efforts;
he levied new forces, and had some slight success. But this appearance
of good fortune did not continue. His army was turbulent and se∣ditious; that
of the parliament every day improved in discipline, and obeyed from
principle. Among instances of this nature was that act called the
<HI>self-denying ordinance,</HI> by which it was resolved, that no member
of the house of commons should have a command in the army. The reasons
assigned for this were specious, and perhaps sincere. It was done to
prevent the parliament's wishing for a continu∣ance of the war, in order to
enjoy a continuing share of authority. The former generals were there∣fore
changed; the Earl of Essex, Denbigh, and Man∣chester gave up their
commissions, and Fairfax, with the assistance of Cromwell,
new-modelled the army without any opposition.</P>
<P>It was the general opinion, that this new altera∣tion would enfeeble
the parliament army, but the event proved otherwise; they were, after this,
every-where victorious. Both armies met near Naseby. The King, who commanded
the main body of his own troops, shewed himself upon this occasion a
coura∣geous general, encouraging his soldiers where giving way, and rallying
them in person when broken. The enemy, however, was victorious; wherever
Cromwell fought, he brought conquest and terror; and the defeat of the royal
army was principally owing to him. This fatal blow the King could never after
recover. All his infantry were so scattered that the enemy took as many
prisoners as they pleas∣ed; his baggage, and cabinet in which his most
secret papers were contained, fell into the hands of his pur∣suers; and
yet, after all, there were not above six hundred men slain upon the field
of battle.</P>
<P>It was now that Cromwell's courage and genius began to appear; he
had hitherto been only a tur∣bulent speaker in the house of commons, and
the <PB N="31" REF="34"/> leader of a regiment in the army. But he now
dis∣covered talents greater than his employments, and his present
success opened to him the prospects of am∣bition, which he never after
lost sight of. Historians seldom distinguish properly in the
changes to be found in the same character; it is probable Cromwell be∣gan to
act in the state with principles of conviction and sincerity; but, new
occurrences arising, his soul was not proof to the allurements of fortune;
he gave way to her seducing call. Had he been on the op∣pressed side,
he might have displayed surprising in∣stances of constancy and
integrity; but, happening to be victorious, he became a tyrant and usurper,
and bathed his country with royal blood.</P>
<P>Cromwell was possessed of apparent humility and internal
pride. This is just the character which Machiavel describes for a
successful usurper. He was originally the son of a private gentleman of
a moderate fortune, who had some years before at∣tempted leaving the kingdom
upon a principle of re∣ligion, but was prevented by the King. This reli∣gious
deportment Cromwell ever inviolably preserv∣ed; it secured him an
ascendancy in the house of commons, where the majority were
enthusiasts; it gained him the affections of Fairfax the general, who was
courageous, ignorant, and sincere. It acquired him the love of the army,
where his presence was coveted; and he alone was permitted to unite the
military and civil employments in his person, for he had a seat in the
house while he was a colonel in the field. But he was still resolved
farther to strengthen his interests by attaching the Independants privately
to his side; they increased in numbers and power by his means, and he, in
return, found them resolute and persevering friends.</P>
<P>The battle of Naseby seemed fatal to the interests of the
King; and Fairfax and Cromwell availed themselves of the circumstances that
offered. Every city that they <PB N="32" REF="35"/> appeared before capitulated.
The young Prince of Wales, afterwards Charles II, participated in the
misfortunes of his father, and fled to the island of Scilly. The King drew
the shattered remains of his army into Oxford, and once more demanded peace.
But, if he could not obtain it in the pros∣perous state of his affairs, it
was not likely that he could now succeed in his desires after a defeat. The
house of commons insulted his misfortunes. His let∣ters to the Queen were
published, with those ill∣natured remarks and railleries which none but the
vicious are capable of making. To be at once mer∣ry and malicious is the sign
of a corrupt heart and mean understanding.</P>
<P>The King, after having taken every measure that he thought could
procure peace, without effect, now saw himself shut up in Oxford, a place
almost with∣out any fortifications, and every day in danger of falling into
the power of a fierce and exasperated party. In such a situation he
therefore was obliged to chuse the least of two evils, and to deliver
him∣self up to the Scotch army, rather than the English, as he expected to
find less animosity in the former. The Scotch officers had made him some
general pro∣mises, grounded, probably, upon their hopes of his compliance
with every request they should make. He sent them word of his intention
to come to their army; and they promised to receive him, and pro∣vide for his
safety. Upon this precarious assurance the King left Oxford, and,
travelling through by∣ways and obscure places, arrived at the Scotch army in
nine days. From that moment he ceased to be free. The Scotch began to
negotiate with the Eng∣lish army, carried their royal prisoner about from
one place to another, and, at length, upon consider∣ation of being paid the
arrears due for their service in England, which amounted to two hundred
thousand pounds, they delivered up their King, and returned 
<PB N="33" REF="36"/> home laden with the reproaches of all good men, and the
internal conviction of their own baseness. From this period till the
usurpation of Cromwell, the constitution was convulsed with all the
distrac∣tions of guilt and party. When the kingly power was abolished, the
parliament then took up the au∣thority; but they were soon to lay it down in
turn, and submit to a military democracy; a new form of government, which,
like all other democracies, was turbulent, feeble, and bloody.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>THE civil war was now over; the army of Scotland, being paid the
reward of perfidy, returned to its own country. The parliament had now no enemy
to fear, except those very troops which had fought their battles with
success. You have been already informed, that this army, by a political
stroke of Cromwell, was rendered indepen∣dent of the parliament, and all its
generals disabled from sitting there. The commons therefore were now
willing to get rid of it as soon as possible, well knowing that, if the
army continued, instead of re∣ceiving laws, it would presume to dictate.
They therefore passed a vote, by which it was ordained, that a part of it
should be disbanded, and another part of it sent over into Ireland. It
may easily be imagined that Cromwell would not suffer this. Now was the
crisis of his greatness, and he seized the op∣portunity; he formed a
council of officers, and an∣other of common soldiers, called Agitators, who
were appointed to enquire into the grievances of the army, and lay them before
the parliament. The very <PB N="34" REF="37"/> same conduct which had formerly
passed between the parliament and King was now put in practice be∣tween the
army and parliament. As the commons granted every request the army rose in
their demands; these accused the army of mutiny and sedition, and those
retorted the accusation, by alledging a mani∣fest design in the
parliament to rule alone.</P>
<P>The King had been confined since he came into the power of the
English, at Holmby castle; the ar∣my were resolved to be
possessed of his person, and sent one Joyce, a cornet, who from a
taylor was be∣come an officer, to take the King by force, and bring him a
prisoner to Newmarket. This commis∣sion he executed with intrepidity and
dispatch. It was in vain that the commons, now without power, complained of
this insolence; the army, instead of being awed by their menaces, marched
towards Lon∣don; and now, in turn, prescribed laws to their employers.
Cromwell, willing to give all his in∣justice the appearance of rectitude,
caused eleven members of the house of commons to be accused. These were
the most powerful and leading speakers, which so astonished the
members, that, willing to appease the army at any rate, they writ to the
ge∣neral, that they were ready to receive any particular charge against
such as fell under his displeasure.</P>
<P>This was an overture for peace, but pre-eminence was what the army
aimed at; instead therefore of being pleased at this condescension, the
general turn∣ed their accusation into a general complaint, and tried every
method to provoke a quarrel, which the others endeavoured to evade. The
citizens of Lon∣don, at length, opened their eyes; they now saw the
constitution effectually destroyed; they saw an oppressive parliament
now subjected to a more oppres∣sive army; they perceived their religion
abolished, their King a captive, and their people exposed to the worst of
slavery.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="38"/> In this exigence the common-council
assembled the militia of the city, the works were manned, and a manifesto
published, aggravating the hostile inten∣tions of the army. The house of
commons was not less divided than the state: one part was for encou∣raging
the citizens to proceed, while the rest, with the two speakers at their
head, was for the army. The slightest divisions, in such a situation,
are soon attended with violent consequences. The commons separated, the
speakers, with sixty-two members, quitted the house to seek protection
from the army, while those who remained behind gave orders, and
established laws, as if they had power to enforce obedience.</P>
<P>Their assumed power, however, continued but a short time, for
the army, with the speakers at their head, soon approached the city. Fear,
therefore, compelled the common-council to concur in mea∣sures which they
tacitly disapproved. They opened their gates to the general, who, attended by
the two speakers and the rest of the members, repaired to their
respective habitations. The parliament, thus over-awed, gave up the command
of the Tower to general Fairfax, and ordered him the thanks of both houses
for having disobeyed their commands.</P>
<P>It still remained to dispose of the King, who had been sent
prisoner to Hampton-court. The In∣dependants, at the head of whom was
Cromwell, and the Presbyterians, in the name of either house, treated
separately with him in private; he even had hopes that in these struggles
for power he might be chosen mediator in the dispute, and expected that the
state, at last, sensible of the miseries of anarchy, like a froward
child, hushed by its own importuni∣ties, would settle under its former
tranquil consti∣tution. But he was soon undeceived, when he found the army
and the generals maste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> in the
dispute; and when, as he had hitherto been used with some 
<PB N="36" REF="39"/> degree of respect, upon their prevailing, he saw
him∣self treated with very little deference or consideration. He therefore
resolved to seek safety by flight, and, at∣tended by two of his
courtiers, fled from his con∣finement, and travelled on horseback all night
to the sea-side, in order to embark for France, leaving behind him a letter
to both houses of parliament. His usual fortunes, however, still attended
him here; no ship was in readiness at the place appointed, and he had no
other method left, but to trust to the ge∣nerosity of the Governor of the
Isle of Wight for protection. Colonel Hammond was then in that command; a
creature of Cromwell, who had been placed there by the interest of John
Hampden, whom we have seen such an opposer of the King. His Ma∣jesty's
attendants, whose names were Ashburnham and Berkeley, went to talk with the
Governor upon this important occasion, who, instead of promising the
protection required, only returned an evasive answer, and desired to be
conducted to the King. Upon this all three went together to the house, where
the unfortunate Monarch expected their ar∣rival; but Hammond staid below.
When Ashburn∣ham informed his Majesty that Hammond was come to wait upon
him, but that he had given no promise for protection, the King, who had now
found almost all the world unfaithful, could not help crying out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>O Jack, thou ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> undone me.</HI></Q> Ashburnham burst into a shower of tears,
and offered to kill Hammond that moment with his own hand. The humane Monarch
would not permit this. Hammond was brought up, and the King being compelled to
follow him to Carisbrook castle was once more made a prisoner, and
treated by Hammond with only the outward ap∣pearances of respect.</P>
<P>In the mean time the parliament continued every day to grow more
feeble, and more factious; the army more powerful, and better united among each
<PB N="37" REF="40"/> other. Cromwell had taken every precaution to
establish such a subordination among his troops, as was necessary
to conduct them with ease, and invi∣gorate his proceedings. But his views
were in some danger of being controverted, at this juncture, by a new and
unheard-of confederacy. The Indepen∣dants were for having no subordination in
govern∣ment. A set of men called Levellers now arose, who declared
against any other governor than Christ. They declared that all degrees
should be levelled, and an equality universally established in titles
and estates. They presented several petitions, and car∣ried their
insolence to an immeasurable pitch. Cromwell at once saw that he was now
upon the point of losing all the fruits of his former schemes and dangers,
and dreaded this new faction still the more, as they turned his own pretended
principles against himself: thus finding all at stake, he was
re∣solved, by one resolute blow, to disperse the faction, or perish
in the attempt. Having intimation that the Levellers were to meet at a certain
place, he unexpectedly appeared before the terrified assembly, at the head
of his red regiment, which had been hitherto invincible. He demanded, in the
name of God, what their assembly and murmurings would be at; and, receiving
an insolent answer, he laid two of the most remarkable dead upon the
ground with his own hands. The guards dispersing the rest, he caused
several of them to be hanged upon the spot, sent others prisoners to
London, and thus dispersed a faction, no otherwise criminal than in
having fol∣lowed his own example.</P>
<P>This action served still more to increase his power in the
camp, in the parliament, and in the city. Fairfax, now become a Lord, was
nominally general, but Cromwell was invested with all the power of the army.
The King, a prisoner in the Isle of Wight, still continued to negotiate a
peace; while the parlia∣ment <PB N="38" REF="41"/> saw no other method of
destroying the mili∣tary power which themselves had raised, but by
opposing to it that of the King. Frequent proposi∣tions therefore
passed between the captive Monarch and the commons; but the great
obstacle, their in∣sisting upon destroying Episcopacy, still
defeated every measure.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Scotch, ashamed of having been thought to
have sold their King, raised an army in his favour. Many of the young
nobility in Eng∣land seconded their intentions; the King's desperate
affairs once more began to wear a favourable aspect, which Cromwell
perceiving, led his veteran army to cer∣tain victory. Success still
seemed to back his crimes; he defeated their forces entirely at Preston,
and took the Duke of Hamilton, their general, prisoner. Fair-fax, on the
other hand, was equally successful in Kent and Essex; the insurgents
having retired into the city of Colchester, which declared for the King, he
blocked them up, and, having compelled them to surrender at discretion, he
treated them with that in∣humanity for which the republican army was at that
time remarkable.</P>
<P>The parli ment still continued to treat with the King, and,
apprehending more from the designs of their generals than the attempts of
their Monarch, seemed in earnest, for the first time, in their
negotia∣tions; but it was now too late; the army soon re∣turned crowned with
their accustomed success, and with furious remonstrances demanded
justice upon the King. They accused him as the cause of all the
misfortunes of the kingdom, and insisted that his par∣tizans and favourites
should share with him in his public punishment. This remonstrance was
soon af∣ter backed by petitions from the garrisons dispersed over
different parts of the kingdom, and the counties of Somerset and Norfolk
concurred in the same de∣mand. Fairfax, being influenced by Cromwell, and 
<PB N="39" REF="42"/> not perceiving that he was the tool of his crafty
collegue, transferred his royal prisoner from the Isle of Wight to Hurst
castle. The parliament complained of this arbitrary proceeding, but their
remonstrances were now but empty sound. They began to issue ordinances
for a more effectual oppo∣sition; but they received a message from
Cromwell, that he intended paying them a visit next day with his army, and in
the mean time ordered them to raise him upon the city of London forty
thousand pounds. Affrighted at the approaching danger, they complied with his
demand; and, in the mean time, the ge∣neral with his army came and took up his
quarters in the skirts of the city. The commons still pro∣ceeded in the
treaty with the King, but this Crom∣well was resolved to oppose: they
voted, that the carrying the King prisoner to Hurst castle was with∣out
the advice or consent of the house. To punish them for this, Cromwell
placed guards round their house, and made those members prisoners whom he
judged most opposite to his designs. One of his colonels, whose name
was Pride, having a paper of names in his hand, seized upon one-and-forty,
and sent them to the Court of Wards, where they were kept under guard.
These were Presbyterians, the original authors of all the troubles, and who
now fell victims to the side they had espoused. The next day an hundred
more of the members were denied entrance; and that part of the house which
now remained was entirely composed of a small body of Independants,
ludicrously called the Rump. These soon voted, that the transactions of
the house, a few days before, were illegal; and that the general's conduct
was just and necessary.</P>
<P>This parliament, if it now deserves the name, was nothing but a
medley of the most obscure citizens, the slaves of the army, the officers
of which, being themselves members, ruled all their proceedings. It 
<PB N="40" REF="43"/> was now therefore unanimously resolved in this
seditious assembly to erect an High Court of Jus∣tice, with power to
try the King for treason against the kingdom. For form-sake they
desired the concurrence of the few remaining Lords in the other house; but
even here there still was virtue enough left unanimously to reject so
horrid a propo∣sal. This no way abated the ardour of the com∣mons; they voted
that the concurrence of the house of Lords was unnecessary; they declared
that all power was originally derived from the people; a declara∣tion true in
itself, but which they wrested to the most detestable purposes.
Colonel Harrison, the son of a butcher, was commanded to conduct the King
from Hurst castle to Windsor. When he arrived there, the council of war
ordained, that he should be no lon∣ger treated with the deference due to
royalty. All ceremony was laid aside, and he now saw himself de∣prived of
his servants, and exposed to the contempt of low-bred insolence. From the
sixth to the twen∣tieth of January, the time was employed in making
preparations for this astonishing scene of guilt. One hundred and
forty-five persons were appointed Judges upon this occasion; and one
Bradshaw, a practitioner of the law, was elected as President of this
detestable synod.</P>
<P>The King was now conducted from Windsor to St. James's, and was
next day produced before the High Court at Westminster-hall to take his
tryal. He still remembered the dignity he owed to himself before such an
inferior court; and, taking his place with his hat on, with a stern air,
surveyed his Judges, who were also covered. When his charge was read,
importing that he had been the cause of all the blood that was shed since
the commencement of the rebellion, he could not repress a smile at once of
contempt and indignation. He then de∣manded by what authority he was brought to
such a tryal? To which Bradshaw replied, that he was <PB N="41" REF="44"/>
tried in the name of the commons of England. The King then objected to the
legality of the tribunal, since the sanction of the Lords and his own were
wanting to complete it; and refused to plead to the articles of the
impeachment Being desired to an∣swer several times; and persisting in
his refusal, he was remanded to his confinement, and the court adjourned. At
their second sitting the president again summoned the King to answer
to his charge; and the King again demurred to the legality of his Judges, and
began to open his objections, when he was interrupted by Bradshaw, and sent
back to pri∣son, as before. At his third appearance he continued firm to his
purpose, and refused to reply, until he should be convinced that their
proceedings were not contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom. The
fourth and last time he appeared before this self-created court of
justice, as he was going thither, he was insulted by the soldiers, and
the mob, who exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Justice, justice, execution,
execution.</HI></Q> He ap∣peared before the court with the same firm
compo∣sure as usual, with his hat on; and while his fen∣tence was reading,
in which he was branded with all the odious appellations that malice could
sug∣gest, he discovered no other emotions than those of pity. In
walking back from this horrid tribunal, the rabble renewed the cry of 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Justice, execution;</HI></Q> and among other
insults one miscreant presumed to spit in the face of his King. He
patiently wiped his face: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Poor souls,</HI> said he, <HI>they would
treat their generals in the same manner for sixpence.</HI></Q> A soldier
more com∣passionate than the rest could not help imploring a blessing
upon his royal head; an officer overhearing it struck the pious centinel to
the ground in presence of the Monarch, who could not help saying, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that the punishment exceeded the
offence.</HI></Q> The day of execu∣tion was fixed to be the third after his
sentence; which when it arrived, he was conducted on foot <PB N="42" REF="45"/> through St. James's Park to Whitehall, accompanied by Doctor Juxon,
and guarded by a regiment of foot, under the command of Colonel Tomlinson.
The scaffold was covered with black, in the middle of which were seen the
block and ax, with two exe∣cutioners in masques. The soldiers were placed
round it, and an infinite concourse of spectators waited with silent
horror at a greater distance. The King surveyed all their solemn
preparations with calm composure; he assured the persons who stood
with him upon the scaffold, that he thought himself guiltless of any
crime but that of having given up the Earl of Strafford to the fury of his
enemies; and that he had confidence in the mercy of Heaven. While he thus
avowed his innocence, the Bishop who attended him warned him that he had but
one stage more to heaven; at which the King cried out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible
crown, where no disturbance can arrive.</HI></Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"You are exchanged, replied the Bishop, from a
temporal to an eternal crown; a good exchange!"</Q> Having now taken off his
cloak, he delivered his George to the Prelate, em∣phatically pronouncing the
word, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Remember.</HI></Q> He then laid his head on the
block, and stretched forth his hands as a signal. One of the men in a
masque severed his head from his body at a blow; and the other, holding it
up streaming with gore, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>This is the head of a traitor.</HI></Q> Such was
the death of Charles, who lived long enough to see the laws and
constitution of his country expire before him. He had the misfortune to be
bred up in high notions of the prerogative which he thought his duty to
sustain. He lived at a time when the spirit of the law was in
opposition to the genius of the people; and govern∣ing by old rules,
instead of endeavouring to accom∣modate himself to the changes of the
times, he fell in the universal convulsion. Many Kings before him expired
by treasons, plots, or assassination; but never <PB N="43" REF="46"/>
since the times of Agis the Lacedemonian were any but him sacrificed by
their subjects with all the for∣malities of justice. Upon the whole, it
must be con∣fessed, that, though the nation was branded by fo∣reigners
with reproach upon this occasion, yet these struggles at length ended in
domestic happiness and security; the laws became more precise, and the
sub∣ject more ready to obey, as if a previous fermentation in the
constitution was necessary to its subsequent re∣finement.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>CROMWELL, who had secretly solicited the King's death, now began
to feel wishes to which he had been hitherto a stranger; he perceived
himself not far removed from the object of his most unbounded ambition. His
views expanded with suc∣cess, and his first principles of liberty
shrunk when opposed to the unbounded prospect of power. The parliament,
which was still permitted to enjoy the shadow of authority, voted it high
treason to ac∣knowledge Charles Stewart, son of the murdered King, as
successor to the throne. They likewise voted the house of Lords
useless and dangerous, and passed an act for the abolition of all
kingly power. A great seal was made, on one side of which were engraved the
arms of England and Ireland, with this inscription, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>The great seal of England;</HI></Q> on the
reverse was represented the house of commons sitting, with this motto, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>The first year of freedom, by God's
blessing, restored,</HI> 1648.</Q></P>
<P>They next proceeded to try those gallant men whose attachment to
their late Sovereign had been most remarkable. The Duke of Hamilton and Lord 
<PB N="44" REF="47"/> Capel were accused, condemned, and beheaded; se∣veral
others shared the same fate. The Earl of Norwich and Sir John Owen were
condemned, but reprieved. The Scotch were not a little displeased at the
death of the Duke, who was executed not only contrary to the laws of war, but
the law of nations; they were therefore determined to acknow∣ledge the young
Prince for their King. But their love of liberty, in some measure, seemed
to combat their resentment; they called him to the throne in∣deed, but, at
the same time, abridged his power with every limitation which they had
formerly at∣tempted to impose on their late Sovereign. The se∣cond Charles
had neither the virtue, the constancy, nor the principles of his father.
Attached to no re∣ligion, he agreed to all their proposals, and was
con∣tented to accept the formalities without the power of a King. He was
received at Edinburgh with de∣monstrations of profound respect, and entered
the city by that very gate on which the limbs of the brave Montrose, one of
his most faithful adherents, were still exposed; but he soon found that
the life he was likely to lead would be an insupportable bon∣dage to one of
his volatile disposition. He was sur∣rounded and incessantly
importuned by the Scotch fanatical clergy, who came to instruct him in
reli∣gion, and obliged him to listen to long sermons, in which they
seldom failed to stigmatize the late King as a tyrant, to accuse his
mother of idolatry, and himself of an untoward disposition. Upon
appoint∣ed days he was obliged to hear six sermons without
intermission. They insisted upon his observing Sun∣day with a
Jewish strictness. They even watched his looks; and, if he happened to
smile at any part of their absurd enthusiasms, he was reprimanded for
his profaneness. Charles for a while bore this inso∣lence with hypocritical
tranquility, and even pre∣tended to be highly edified by their instructions;
but, <PB N="45" REF="48"/> notwithstanding this, he only wished for an
opportu∣nity of escaping from such a variety of disgusting
impertinence.</P>
<P>In the mean time the English parliament, alarmed at the King's
restitution in Scotland, sent to recall Cromwell from Ireland, where he had
carried on the war with his usual success. He had reduced Kil∣kenny and
many other places, and prosecuted his conquests with surprising
rapidity. However, he now left the war in that kingdom to be carried on by
Ire∣ton, his deputy-lieutenant; and returned to England, in obedience to the
mandate of the parliament. When he took his seat in the house, the
speaker thanked him for the services he had done the com∣monwealth. They
then proceeded to deliberate up∣on the war with Scotland. They desired to
know if Fairfax would conduct the enterprize. Fairfax, a rigid Presbyterian,
who had all along fought from principle, declined opposing a nation which he
con∣sidered as co-operating in the same good work for which he had first
drawn the sword; he therefore declined the command, sent his commission
to the commons, and retired to spend the remainder of his life in privacy and
peace.</P>
<P>This was an inlet to Cromwell's subsequent power; he was
appointed general of the forces of the com∣monwealth, and soon marched into
Scotland at the head of an army of eighteen thousand men, long accustomed
to conquer. He found general Lesly at the head of an army far more numerous
than his own, but undisciplined and mutinous. After some previ∣ous
skirmishing, Cromwell saw himself in a very dis∣advantageous post
near Dunbar, and his antagonist ready to take advantage of his incommodious
situa∣tion. However, perceiving the Scots preparing to give him battle, he
assured his soldiers that the Lord had delivered the enemy into his
hands, and ordered his army to sing psalms, as already assured of
victory. <PB N="46" REF="49"/> The ministers of the Scotch army were not
less san∣guine in their assurances of victory than he; they boldly
promised success in the name of the Lord, and excited a spirit of
impatience among the soldi∣ers. Victory, as always before, again declared for
Cromwell, who routed the enemy with great slaughter, while he did not lose
on his side above forty men in all.</P>
<P>Charles, who hated the Scotch army, and only dreaded Cromwell, was
well enough pleased at this defeat. It served to introduce him to a greater
share in the command than he was before permitted to en∣joy. He therefore put
himself at the head of that remnant which survived the defeat, and
strengthened it by the royalists, who had been before excluded from his
service. And now, instead of following Cromwell, who led his victorious
troops to Perth, he resolved to seize this opportunity of penetrating into
England, where he expected to be joined by numbers there still attached to
his interests. His hopes in this were frustrated; his army, on their march,
was lessened by continual desertion and dis∣ease. Few voluntiers
repaired to the royal standard; and he at length saw his vigilant enemy
overtaking him at Worcester. Both armies fought with equal intrepidity, but
Cromwell was again victorious. Ne∣ver was so complete a victory obtained by
him be∣fore. Two thousand perished by the sword, and four times that
number, being taken, were sold as slaves to the American planters. The
conqueror be∣came master of all Scotland, and set a price of a thousand
pounds upon the head of the King.</P>
<P>Imagination can scarce conceive dangers mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> romantic, or distresses more severe, than
those whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attended the young
King's escape from Worcester<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
After his hair was cut off, the better to effect hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> escape, he worked for some days,
disguised as a pea¦sant, at wood-cutting. He next made an attemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <PB N="47" REF="50"/> to retire into Wales, under the
conduct of one Pen∣drell, a poor but faithful companion in his distress.
But in this attempt he was disappointed, every pass being guarded to
prevent his escape. Being obliged to return, he met one Colonel Careless,
who, like himself, had escaped the carnage at Worcester; and it was in
his company that he was obliged to climb a spreading oak, among the thick
branches of which they passed the day together, while the soldiers of the
enemy went underneath in pursuit of him. From thence he passed with
imminent danger, feeling all the vicissitudes of famine, fatigue, and pain,
to the house of one Mr. Lane, a worthy subject of his, in Staffordshire.
Here he deliberated about the means of escaping to France. They agreed that
he should ride before this gentleman's daughter, on a visit to one Mrs.
Horton, who lived in the neigh∣bourhood of Bristol. During this journey he
every day met people whose persons he knew, and once passed through a
whole regiment of the parliament army.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the house of Mr. Norton, the first person
they saw was one of his own chap∣lains, sitting at the door, amusing
himself with see∣ing people play at bowls. The King, after having taken
proper care of his horse in the stable, was shewn to an apartment which
Mrs. Lane had pro∣vided for him, upon pretence of indisposition. The
butler, being sent to him with some refreshment, no sooner beheld his
countenance, which was now very pale with anxiety and fatigue, than he
recollected the visage of his King and Master, and falling upon his knees,
while the tears streamed down his cheeks, he cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"I am rejoiced to see your Majesty."</Q> The
King enjoined him secrecy, and the honest servant punctually kept his
word. Having staid some days in this place, he repaired to the house of
Colonel Wyndham, where he was cordially receiv∣ed, <PB N="48" REF="51"/> that
gentleman's family having ever been noted for loyalty. Pursuing his route to
the sea-side, he once more had a very providential escape from the little
inn at which he lodged. It happened to be a solemn fast, and a fanatical
weaver, who had fought in the parliament army, was preaching against the
King, in a chapel fronting the house. Charles was actually one of the
audience, A farrier of the same principles, who had been examining the
horses be∣longing to the passengers, came to assure the preacher,
that he knew by the fashion of the shoes that one of the stranger's
horses came from the North. The preacher instantly affirmed, that this
horse could be∣long to no other than Charles Stewart, and went immediately
with a constable to the house; but the King, in the mean time, found means
to escape. Thus, at length, after inexpressible hardships, and having
experienced the fidelity of forty different per∣sons of all ranks, who had
power to betray him, he embarked at Brighthelmsted, and landed safely in
Normandy.</P>
<P>Cromwell, in the mean time, returned to London in triumph, where he
was met by the speaker of the house, accompanied by the mayor and
magistrates in their formalities. His first care, upon his return, was to
take the advantage of his successes, by depress∣ing the Scotch. An
act was passed for abolishing royalty in Scotland, and annexing it as a
conquered province to the English commonwealth, impowering it, however, to
send a certain number of representa∣tives to the British parliament. It
was now seen with astonishment, that a parliament composed of obscure
and weak members could govern at once with unanimity and success. Without
any acknowledged subordination they levied armies, maintained fleets, and
gave laws to their neighbours. Never was Eng∣land more powerful than at this
period. The finances were managed with oeconomy and exactness. No 
<PB N="49" REF="52"/> private person became rich by public extortions. The
revenues of the crown, the lands of the Bishops, and a tax of an hundred and
twenty thousand pounds each month, supplied the wants of the government,
and invigorated all their proceedings.</P>
<P>Having reduced the British dominions to perfect obedience, the
parliament next resolved to chastise the Dutch, who had given but very
slight causes of complaint. Dorislaus, one of the late King's Judges,
being sent thither by the commons as envoy, was assassinated by the
royal party that had taken refuge there; St. John, appointed English
ambassador. was also insulted by the friends of the Prince of Orange.
These were grounds sufficient to incense the republic of England to a
war. Its success, how∣ever, was doubtful; Blake commanded the English,
and Van Tromp was Admiral of Holland; both equally experienced, courageous, and
active. Seve∣ral engagements served only to shew the excellence of the
Admirals, without determining the balance of naval power. The parliament,
however, was will∣ing to continue the war, rightly judging that, when the force
of the nation was exerted by sea, it would diminish Cromwell the general's
power upon land.</P>
<P>Cromwell was not behind them in penetration; he saw they dreaded
his growing power, and wished to diminish it; all his measures were
conducted with a bold intrepidity that marked his character; and he was now
resolved to make another daring effort. He persuaded his officers to
present a petition for pay∣ment of arrears and redress of grievances, which
he knew would be rejected with disdain. The house, upon receiving it,
appointed a committee to prepare an act, that all persons who presented
such petitions for the future should be deemed guilty of high trea∣son.
This was what Cromwell wished for. He was sitting in council with his
officers, when inform∣ed of the subject on which the house was
deliberating. <PB N="50" REF="53"/> Turning to major-general Vernon, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I am compelled,</HI> cried he, <HI>to do a thing
that makes the very hair of my head stand on end;</HI></Q> and, starting up
with marks of violent indignation in his countenance, he hastened to the
parliament, with a body of three hundred soldiers. Upon entering the house,
he took his place, and sat some time to hear the debates; and, when the
speaker was about to put the question, he suddenly rose up, and,
reviling them for their ambition and cruelty, he stamped with his foot, and
instantly the house was filled with armed men. Then addressing
himself to the members, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Get you gone,</HI> said he; <HI>give place to
honest men; you are no longer a parliament; I tell you, you are no longer a
parliament; the Lord has done with you.</HI></Q> He then accused one as a
drunkard, another as a whoremaster, a third of adultery, and a fourth of
extortion. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>It is you,</HI> added he, <HI>that have forced
me upon this; I have sought the Lord night and day, that he would rather
slay me than put me upon this work.</HI></Q> Then pointing to the mace, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Take away,</HI> cried he, <HI>that
bauble;</HI></Q> and, turning out all the members, he ordered the door to be
locked, and, putting the key in his pocket, retired to Whitehall. Thus by one
daring exploit the new republic was abolished, and the whole power, civil and
military, centered in him alone. The present unsteady form of the English
government, is the strongest proof of a late philo∣sopher's opinion, that
every country is possessed of a set of laws and constitutions
best adapted to the nature of the inhabitants, the climate, and the soil,
which when once broken through, the government must continue weak and
unsteady, until the natural constitution is restored; as in mechanics all
bodies continue to waver till their center of gravity is sup∣ported.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THAT parliament, which had long gloried in resisting violence,
was now dissolved by an act of the most flagrant oppression. The
people, how∣ever, expressed no dislike at their dissolution.
Crom∣well received congratulatory addresses from the fleet, the
corporations, and the army; but he was unwil∣ling to put forth all his power at
once; he resolved to amuse them with the form of a commonwealth, and
familiarize them by degrees to arbitrary govern∣ment. He decreed, that the
sovereign power should be vested in one hundred and forty-four persons,
un∣der the denomination of a parliament; and he un∣dertook himself to make
the choice. The persons he pitched upon were the lowest, meanest, and
most ignorant among the citizens; he foresaw, that, dur∣ing the
administration of such, he alone must govern; or that they would soon
throw up the reins of go∣vernment, which they were unqualified to guide. To
excel in fanaticism seemed a necessary qualifi∣cation in this new
parliament. Several, with long names borrowed from scripture, were members;
but a man, whose name was <HI>Praise God Barebones,</HI> was one of the
most remarkable; and by his name the assembly was afterwards called in
ridicule.</P>
<P>To this assembly was committed the care of mak∣ing peace with
the Dutch; but, being utterly unskil∣led in such negotiations, the
ambassadors of the States were quite at a loss how to treat with them.
The people exclaimed at so foolish a legislature, and they themselves
seemed not insensible of the contempt and ridicule which they every day
failed not to incur. They had now sat five months without doing any thing of
importance; when at length Rouse, their speaker, rose up, and proposed
that, as they were unable to bear the burthen that was laid upon them, 
<PB N="52" REF="55"/> they should resign their authority
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>im from whom they had received it.
Cromwell accepted their re∣signation with pleasure, and sent Colonel
White to clear the house of the few fanatics who persisted in continuing
to sit. White, entering with a detach∣ment of soldiers, asked, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>What they did there!</HI></Q> To which replying,
that they were seeking the Lord: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Then you may go elsewhere,</HI> cried he,
<HI>for to my certain knowledge the Lord has not been here these many
years.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The officers now, by their own authority, de∣clared Cromwell
Protector. He was possessed of that which is the original of all
command, namely, force; for the strong ever give laws to the feeble. The
mayor and aldermen were sent for; the usurper was installed at Whitehall,
in the palace of the Eng∣lish Kings; he assumed the office of Protector;
was honoured with the epithet of Highness, and proclaim∣ed in London, and
other parts of the kingdom. Thus an obscure inhabitant of Wales, at length,
rose to unlimited power, far beyond that of former Kings, by his courage and
his hypocrisy.</P>
<P>He was about fifty-three years of age when he be∣gan to reign, which
he did with equal conduct, mo∣deration, and success. He, in the beginning,
chose among the officers, the former companions of his dangers and victories,
twenty-one counsellors of state, to each of whom he assigned a
pension of one thousand pounds a year. The troops were always paid a month
in advance; the magazines were well provided; the public treasure, of which
he had the disposal, was managed with frugality and care. The Dutch were
compelled to sue for peace, and he dic∣tated the terms. He insisted upon
their paying de∣ference to the British flag. They were compelled to abandon
the interest of the King; they engaged to pay eighty-five thousand pounds,
as an indemni∣fication for former expences; and to restore the English
East-India company a part of those domi∣nions <PB N="53" REF="56"/> of which
they had unjustly deprived them in the East.</P>
<P>Every nation with whom the English had any connection, now courted
their Protector's alliance. Among the number France solicited his aid
against Spain: Cromwell, though capable of conducting the internal parts of
government, had no skill in foreign policy. He lent his assistance to
humble Spain, at a time when the interests of Europe required her
ex∣altation. Cardinal Mazarine gave him up Dunkirk. His fleet, under the
conduct of the famous Blake, took the island of Jamaica. The kingdom of
Ire∣land was entirely reduced to obedience, and treated by him as a conquered
country; many thousands of the wretched natives strove to find, in
banishment, an alleviation of their miseries; numbers died of fa∣mine, and
by the hands of the executioner not a few.</P>
<P>Cromwell, to give the greater appearance of justice to his
usurpation, was resolved to govern by parlia∣ment, yet by such a
parliament alone as he could govern. He assembled them, and dissolved
them at pleasure; the house of Lords was entirely disconti∣nued; but he
set up a new chamber of parliament, composed of his own creatures, to
oppose that elected by the voices of the people. Thus, ever active,
vi∣gilant, and resolute, he discovered every conspiracy against his
person, and every insurrection among the people, before they took effect.
He had the address to prevail upon his parliament to make him an offer of the
crown, merely to have the seeming magnani∣mity of refusing it, and thus to
confirm his real power.</P>
<P>His private life was no less worthy our observa∣tion; he led an
obscure life in the palace assigned for his habitation, without pomp,
without luxury. When he sent his son Henry into Ireland, he al∣lowed him
but one servant in his retinue. His man∣ners <PB N="54" REF="57"/> were
naturally austere, and he preserved the dignity and distance of his
character in the midst of the coarsest familiarity. He was cruel from
policy; just and temperate from inclination; laborious and exact in all his
designs; without eloquence he had the talent of persuading; and without
sincerity the art of making sincere adherents: his dexterity equal∣ly
satisfied every sect; with Presbyterians, a Presby∣rian; with Deists
a Deist; only an Independant in principle. It was by these arts he
continued his authority, first cemented by blood, and maintained by
hypocrisy and usurpation.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding this conduct, which contri∣buted to render
him truly formidable at home, he was, after a few years reign, become truly
miserable to himself. He knew that he was detested by every party in the
kingdom; he knew the fierce spirit of the people whom he had made slaves;
and he was incessantly haunted by the terrors of an assassination.
To increase his calamity, a book was published, in∣titled, <HI>Killing no
murder;</HI> in which it was proved to be just to destroy him at any rate. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Shall we,</HI> said this popular declaimer,
<HI>who would not suffer the lion to invade us, tamely stand to be devoured
by the wolf?</HI></Q> Crom∣well read this spirited treatise, and it is
said was ne∣ver seen to smile afterwards. He wore armour un∣der his
cloaths, and always kept a loaded pistol in his pocket; his aspect became
cloudy, and he re∣garded every stranger with a glance of timid
suspi∣cion. He always travelled with hurry and precipi∣tation, and never
slept two nights successively in the same apartment. A tertian ague
came at last to deliver him from a life of horror and misery. He died at
Whitehall, after having nominated his son Richard Cromwell as his
successor. Notwithstand∣ing the evident approaches of death, his
fanatical chaplains affirmed that he would recover, and thanked God for the
undoubted assurances they had <PB N="55" REF="58"/> received of his
safety. He was even of the same opinion himself. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I tell you,</HI> cried he to the physicians
that attended him, <HI>I shall not die of this distemper; fa∣vourable
answers have been returned from Heaven, not only to my own supplications,
but likewise to those of the godly, who carry on a more intimate
correspondence with the Lord.</HI></Q> This behaviour, at his death, is an
undeniable proof that he was in reality more the enthusiast than an
hy∣pocrite; and, in fact, we are more frequently de∣ceived ourselves, than we
attempt to deceive others.</P>
<P>Whatever were the differences of interest after the death of the
Usurper, the influence of his name was still sufficient to get Richard
his son proclaimed Pro∣tector. The parties, however, were now grown too
headstrong to be controlled by greater abilities; what then could Richard do
who had nothing active in his disposition, no talents for business, no
know∣ledge of government, no ambition, no importance? Oliver, by means of the
army, had long governed the kingdom; they were now left to govern alone. They
first therefore presented a petition to the new Protector, demanding that
no member of the army should be subject to the civil power, and that the
officers should enjoy the privilege of chusing their own general. Richard,
shocked at their presump∣tion, rejected their requests, and even
threatened to dismiss them the service. The parliament attempted to
support these measures of Richard, but the army prevailed; the parliament
was dissolved by their me∣naces, and the Protector again reduced to a
private station. The officers, once more being thus left to themselves,
determined to replace the remnant of the old parliament which had beheaded the
King, and which the late Protector had so disgracefully dismiss∣ed.
This was called <HI>The good old cause;</HI> and such of the higher
officers as seemed unwilling to give up their authority to this parliament,
were intimidated by their subalterns into a compliance.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="59"/> The Rump parliament, as it was called, being
thus once again established, began by vigorously at∣tempting to
lessen the power of that very army which had just now given them all
their authority. They new-modelled a part of the forces, cashiered such
of∣ficers as they feared, and placed others in their room. These attempts,
however, did not pass without vigo∣rous efforts in the principal officers who
were at London to oppose them. They held several conferences together to
strengthen their power, and lessen that of their opposers. They at
length came to the usual resource of these turbulent times; they first
presented a se∣ditious petition; and, upon finding it rejected, con∣ducted
by general Lambert, they entered the house, excluded the members,
dissolved the parliament by their own authority, and formed a council of
ten to provide for the safety of the commonwealth. Dur∣ing these
transactions, general Monck was at the head of twelve thousand veterans in
Scotland. Monck had begun his fortunes under the command of the late King, and
was taken prisoner in his service. Upon the death of his Master he was
released from his long confinement to command under Cromwell, for whom he
always fought with conduct and suc∣cess.</P>
<P>In this anarchy and confusion he seemed agitated by different
designs, between loyalty to his lawful King, ambition to advance himself,
and the appre∣hensions he was under from the governing part of the nation;
his loyalty at length prevailed; he re∣solved to restore the royal family,
but to use all the precautions that were requisite for their safety and
his own. He soon had an opportunity of embarras∣sing the affairs of the
nation still more, to prepare the way for her meditated revolution. The
officers, now formed into a council of ten, had sent to treat with him; he
consented to a negotiation only in or∣der to gain time; and after a treaty
had been actu∣ally <PB N="57" REF="60"/> signed by those he employed in this
business, he refused to ratify it upon frivolous pretences. The deposed
parliament, finding that Monck had disap∣proved of the proceedings of the
officers at London, were resolved to avail themselves of his friendship,
in order to be reinstated in their former authority; and sent him a private
commission, appointing him com∣mander in chief of all the forces in
England, Scot∣land, and Ireland. He now therefore resolved to march towar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s London, and upon his approach the
officers wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had deposed the
parliament found them∣selves almost deserted, and at length compelled to
re∣sign the authority they had usurped. When he reached St. Alban's, he
sent a letter to the house, desiring that London should be cleared of
all other troops to make way for his approach. This demand awakened the
suspicion of the parliament, but they were reluctantly obliged to comply.
He entered London in triumph at the head of his army, and re∣paired to the
council of state, but refused taking the oath of abjuration, shrewdly
observing that the fewer oaths were taken, the cleaner would the
consciences be. He next examined his officers, and, having se∣cured their
concurrence, he restored those members to the parliament which long since
had been secluded before the trial of the King.</P>
<P>The Independants, who had voted for the trial of Charles, were now
greatly out-numbered; and it was soon seen that the royal party was likely
to pre∣vail. The republicans, who, though they hated a Pro∣tector, still more
feared the royal resentment, endea∣voured to persuade Monck to assume
the sovereign power, in imitation of Cromwell. He rejected their advice, and
in the mean time gave the King private intimations of his designs,
new-modelled the army, quelled an incipient insurrection, and prepared all
things for his restoration.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61"/> Nothing now was wanting, but the authority and
consent of a free parliament, to settle the fluctuating constitution. On
the twenty-fifth of April 1660, the new parliament met in both houses, after
the manner of their ancestors. They immediately voted that the government
ought to be vested in a King, Lords, and Commons. On the eighth of May
Charles II. was proclaimed in London; on the twenty-sixth he arrived at
Dover; on the twenty-ninth he reached Whitehall through an innumerable
multitude of people, who rent the air with their ac∣clamations. The wretched
kingdom, long torn with faction, and oppressed by its own struggles for
free∣dom, once more began to respire; fanaticism, with all its train of
melancholy terrors and cruelties, was now dispelled; the arts of peace began
to return; but, unhappily, the arts of luxury entered in their train.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>IT will undoubtedly astonish posterity, when they find a whole
nation making these sudden changes from absolute liberty to the most
submissive obedi∣ence; at one time almost unanimously declaring
a∣gainst monarchy, and soon after, with the most un∣bounded flattery,
soliciting the shackles of arbitrary power. The parliament, which had
before so vehe∣mently opposed the late Monarch, possessed of every
virtue, were now profuse in their submissions to his successor,
whose character stood in no manner of competition with that of his
father.</P>
<P>They first ordained to have the bodies of Crom∣well, Ireton, and
Bradshaw, dug from their graves, <PB N="59" REF="62"/> and dragged to the
place of execution; here they continued hanging the whole day, and then were
interred under the gallows. Of those who sat in judgment on the late
Monarch's trial, some were dead, and some were thought worthy to find
par∣don; ten only out of fourscore were devoted to im∣mediate destruction.
These were enthusiasts, who had all along acted from principle, and bore
their fate with all the confidence of martyrs. They had been formerly cruel
themselves, and they were now in turn treated with shocking inhumanity; the
exe∣cutioners, not content with performing the office of death, added insult
to their tortures; the suffer∣ers, to a man, thanked God for being permitted
to die for his cause, and braved the fury of their oppres∣sors with manly
contempt.</P>
<P>Their deaths seemed to inspire a few desperate
en∣thusiasts with the most strange confidence that ever deluded a poor
ignorant party. One Venner, who expected the immediate coming of Christ upon
earth, appeared in the streets of London in arms, at the head of threescore
enthusiasts like himself, and de∣clared against any other Monarch but
King Jesus. They had been wrought into such a pitch of phrenzy as to
believe themselves invulnerable, and fought as men confident of victory. The
few survivors of their defeat were taken, tried, condemned, and executed:
they affirmed to the last, that, if they had been de∣ceived, the Lord
himself concurred in the imposture.</P>
<P>It was now feared that the tide of loyalty would bear down all the
sormer mounds of freedom; the par∣liament seemed to concur in all the
designs of the court, and even to anticipate its wishes; but, though the
King was established, his old faithful friends, and the followers of his
family, were left unrewarded. There were numbers who had fought for his father,
and for him, and had lost their all in his service, still pining in want
and misery; while their persecutors, <PB N="60" REF="63"/> who, prefiting by
the troubles of their country, had acquired fortunes during the civil war, were
still per∣mitted to enjoy them without molestation. The suf∣ferers
petitioned in vain; Charles was no way re∣markable for gratitude; his
pleasures, his flatterers, and concubines engrossed all his attention,
and ex∣hausted his finances; the unhappy Cavaliers murmur∣ed without
redress; he fled from their gloomy expo∣stulations to scenes of mirth,
riot, and festivity.</P>
<P>The kingdom now seemed to be converted into a theatre of
debauchery, which had before been a scene of blood. The Independants were no
longer to be seen; the Puritans were restrained; the hor∣rors of the late
war were the subject of ridicule; the formality and the ignorance of
sectaries were dis∣played upon the stage, and even laughed at in the
pulpit. The King had no religion; and, though he permitted the persecution of
sectaries, it was merely from political motives. The late miseries of the
na∣tion were not sufficient to deter a few desperate fana∣ties from
attempting to excite them afresh; they laid a scheme for surprising
several towns in the North, and raising a general insurrection; the
mini∣stry discovered the plot, before it was ripe for execu∣tion; thirty of
the conspirators were taken and exe∣cuted; and this plot was a pretext for
continuing the parliament then sitting, and repealing the act for triennial
parliaments, as being dangerous in times of commotion.</P>
<P>The English parliament seemed willing to make the King
reparation for their former disobedience, and the Scotch were still more
sanguine in the ex∣pressions of their attachment. Had Charles been an
active Monarch, he might have now become an ab∣solute one. They confirmed the
doctrine of passive obedience by a solemn act; they assigned him a
re∣venue of twelve hundred thousand pounds, exclusive of the expence
necessary for sitting and supplying <PB N="61" REF="64"/> the fleet.
None of his predecessors were ever possessed of such a large
revenue; nevertheless, his prodigality rendered him indigent, and, instead
of desiring an as∣cendancy over his parliament, he was content to be an
humble and continual dependant on their bounty.</P>
<P>His prodigality, his libertinism, and the familiarity with which
he permitted himself to be treated by his subjects, soon began to alter
their sentiments from a veneration for royalty to a contempt of his person
and administration. He declared war against Hol∣land, merely to have an
opportunity of spending up∣on his pleasures. a part of those sums
granted him by parliament for the support of a fleet and army. This war was
carried on with doubtful success; but the alarm which the nation received
from Ruyter the Dutch Admiral's attempting to sail up the river Thames,
still more disgusted them against their go∣vernor. Immediate dangers,
though small, influ∣ence the mind with greater force than distant, though
terrible calamities. They now called to mind the administration of Cromwell,
when the people en∣joyed security at home, and were respected abroad; they
recollected that vigorous Usurper's labours for the good of the nation, and
compared them with those of the present effeminate and unsuccessful
reign.</P>
<P>Natural and accidental calamities seemed to unite themselves to
those brought on by bad management. A plague ravaged the city, which swept
away more than one hundred thousand of its inhabitants; and soon after the
city was almost entirely destroyed by a conflagration, which raged for
three days without intermission. The spirit of the people soon
surmount∣ed these calamities; London soon rose more beauti∣ful from its
ashes; the streets were built anew more spacious and convenient than
before; and their di∣stress soon became their advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="65"/> But neither war, nor accident, nor the murmurs
of the people could abate the passion for gallantry, pleasure, and
expence, that reigned through the court through the King's example. He had
imbibed all that spirit of levity, during his residence in France, for
which that kingdom is remarkable. Though he had been married soon after his
restoration to the Infanta of Portugal, he kept several mistresses,
by whom he had natural issue. Among this number were mada∣moiselle
Queroüaille, a French woman, whom he created Duchess of Portsmouth;
Mrs. Palmer, whom he made a Countess; and Nel Gwyn and Mrs. Davis,
actresses taken from the theatre.</P>
<P>But, though the court was thus lost to decency, the passion
for uniformity in religion in the nation seemed to revive. The parliament was
equally set against the Presbyterians and the Papists; an act was made
called the <HI>Test act,</HI> importing that every person in office and
employment should take the oaths of al∣iegiance and supremacy, receive the
sacrament in some parish church before competent witnesses, and
subscribe a declaration, renouncing the doctrine of transubstantiation.
This was levelled against the Duke of York, the King's brother, who had
pro∣fessed himself a Papist, and whom the parliament se∣cretly aimed
at excluding from the throne. The fears and discontents of the nation were
vented with∣out restraint; the apprehensions of a Popish
succes∣sor, an abandoned court, a parliament that had con∣tinued, without
a new election, for seventeen years; an alliance cemented with France, the
secret enemy of England and the Protestant religion; and an
un∣successful and expensive war with Holland, their na∣tural allies; all
gave cause to kindle a spirit of indig∣nation among the people. The court
tried every method, but in vain, to satisfy these murmurs, or ap∣pease
them. Even the coffee-houses were suppressed where such topics were
generally debated.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="66"/> This universal ferment, as may easily be
imagin∣ed, broke out into an alarm. When the spirit of the English is once
excited, they either find objects of resentment, or they make them. A rumour
of a Popish conspiracy was first propagated, and one Titus Oates soon
appeared to give it confirmation. Titus Oates had been from his youth an
indigent and infa∣mous adventurer. He was abandoned, illiterate, and
shameless. He had been once indicted for perjury, afterwards chaplain of a
man of war, and dismissed for unnatural practices. He then professed
himself a Roman Catholic, went to the Jesuits College at St. Omer, but was
dismissed, after some residence there, with infamy. He then returned
to London, filled with projects of revenge; and the animosities of this
unhappy nation soon appeared a proper place of nou∣rishment to give this
viper's virulence effect. He deposed upon oath, that the Jesuits, several
of whom he named, and who were soon after taken up, had tried the King under
the name of the <HI>Black Bastard,</HI> condemned him as an heretic, and
resolved to de∣prive him of life: that several attempts had been made
without success, and that not only the King's brother, but even the Queen
were privy to the de∣sign. The house of commons immediately took fire at
this pretended conspiracy; they petitioned for re∣moving the Queen, rewarded
Oates with a pension of twelve hundred pounds, and immediately ordered the
conspirators to be tried in the courts of justice. Se∣veral Jesuits were
tried; their very profession was at that time sufficient to destroy
them; before a partial Judge and an exasperated Jury, no mercy could be
expected, and several, though apparently innocent, were executed as traytors
upon this miscreant's in∣formation. Coleman, the Duke of York's secretary,
Ireland, Pickering, Grove, Fenwick, and White-bread were among the first that
fell; they died de∣claring <PB N="64" REF="67"/> their innocence to the last
moment of their lives.</P>
<P>While the Protestants were labouring to humble both the Puritans
and the Papists, those two parties were at the same time mutually
employed in ruining each other. Plot was set against plot; that con∣trived
by Oates was called the <HI>Jesuits;</HI> that set to oppose it was
called by the name of the <HI>Meal∣tub Plot,</HI> as the scheme of the
conspiracy was found hidden in a meal-tub. This was a design against
Oates, for his perjuries had drawn upon him the furious resentment of the
Catholic party; they were determined to take away his life by the same
false evidence by which he had taken the lives of so many others.</P>
<P>Of all these plots tending to disturb the peace of the kingdom,
it is said the Earl of Shaftesbury was at the bottom; he had been a member
of the Long Parliament in the civil wars, and had gained great influence among
the Presbyterians; he had insinu∣ated himself into the confidence of
Cromwell, and afterwards employed his credit in forwarding the re∣storation.
He had been made one of the privy∣council in the present reign, but was
ejected thence for the duplicity of his conduct. He was possessed of
uncommon abilities, joined with turbulence, dis∣simulation, and unbounded
ambition. It was thought that this nobleman, in revenge for his disgrace at
court, headed the demagogue faction, and alarmed the King with unceasing
dangers.</P>
<P>He artfully increased the people's apprehensions of a Popish
successor, and, by his interest, brought a bill into the house of
commons for the exclusion of James Duke of York from the succession. In
the national animosity raised against Papists it was no dif∣ficult
matter to have it passed through the house of commons; but, being
presented to the house of peers, it was thrown out by a great majori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="68"/> The commons were greatly incensed at this
re∣pulse, but particularly their anger fell upon the Earl of Halifax, who
exerted himself in the opposition. Halifax disregarded their anger,
secure in conscious innocence. But their rage fell with more weight upon
Lord Stafford, who had long been a prisoner in the Tower, upon the
deposition of Oates. Not∣withstanding his age, his weak intellects, and the
justness of his defence, he was arraigned, condemn∣ed, and executed for a
plot which had its only foun∣dation in perjury and subornation. All things
threat∣ened a renewal of the former troubles from which the kingdom had been
but lately set free. The commons presented petition after petition to the
King, desiring the punishment of Papists, and the abridgment of the royal
prerogative. They seemed willing to intimidate the King, or to inflame the
nation. At length Charles shewed a degree of for∣titude that surprized even
his friends; he rejected their petitions with contempt, and dissolved the
par∣liament that had abused their power.</P>
<P>The state of the nation at that time, with regard to religion, was
thus: The principal men at court, if they professed any, were of the
established church; so were all the men of great property, as well as the
dregs of the people; but that body of men who voted at elections, placed
between a state of opulence and penury, were in general Presbyterians. They
were therefore willing to return representatives only of that
persuasion.</P>
<P>Charles, however, was resolved to try one parlia∣ment more, and
appointed them to meet him at Ox∣ford, the city of London having long been
displeasing, by reason of their republican principles. The new
parliament, however, seemed still more turbulent than the former; the
members came armed, and attended by their friends and adherents, as if they
expected to fight, and not deliberate. The representatives of 
<PB N="66" REF="69"/> London were in particular attended by a numerous body of
horsemen, wearing cockades, inscribed, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>No Popery, no Slavery.</HI></Q> To declaim
against Popery was the voice of faction in the last reign, and such it
was in the present. The same spirit that had animated the former
parliament, seemed redoubled in this. They insisted on the bill for
excluding the Duke of York from the succession; they persisted in
declaring that all Papists should be banished, and their children
educated in the Protestant religion; that the doctrine of passive
obedience was injurious to the rights of society. In a word, the leaders of
the opposition were resolved to be displeased with every measure the
King could propose, and prepared to recall the for∣mer aristocracy into the
kingdom. Charles, seeing that nothing could be expected from counsels
manag∣ed by party, and not deliberation, once more dissolv∣ed this
parliament, with a stedfast resolution of never calling another.</P>
<P>This was a stroke they had never expected, and which the times
alone could justify. From the mo∣ment the royal and parliamentary commotions
were ended, Charles seemed to rule with despotic power, and was resolved
to leave to his successor the faults and the misfortunes of his
administration. His tem∣per, which had been always easy and merciful,
be∣came arbitrary, and even cruel; he entertained spies and informers round
the throne, and imprisoned all such as he thought most daring in their
designs. He resolved to humble the Presbyterians; all such were
divested of their employments, and their places filled with such as
approved the doctrine of non-re∣sistance. The clergy testified their zeal
to the court by their writings and sermons; the partizans of the King were
most numerous; but those of the opposite faction were more
enterprising; the mutual animo∣fity of each was inflamed into rage and
rancour, and the King openly declared himself at the head of a 
<PB N="67" REF="70"/> faction. The city of London particularly fell under his
resentment; he deprived them of their charter, and only restored it when he
had subjected the elec∣tion of their magistrates to his immediate
authority.</P>
<P>Such an arbitrary administration could not fail of exciting new
insurrections; several noblemen, among whom were the Duke of Monmouth, the
King's na∣tural son, the Lord Shaftesbury, Russel, Grey, and others,
entered into a combination to destroy the King, which was called after the
<HI>Rye-house plot.</HI> The conspirators met at the house of one
Shepherd, a wine-merchant, where they proposed a rising in London,
Bristol, Devonshire, and Cheshire. They agreed upon a declaration for
justifying their design, but the scheme was at first delayed from the
difficulty of the preparations previous to taking the field, and soon after
discovered by one Keiling, who expected to earn a pardon for himself by
impeaching his asso∣ciates. As the plot began to open, new informers came
in; Monmouth absconded, Grey escaped the messenger who had been sent
to arrest him, Russel was committed to the Tower, and Shaftesbury, who
foresaw the danger, had taken refuge in Holland. Lord Essex, Sidney, the
great philosopher and law∣giver, and Hampden, grandson of the famous man of
that name, were informed against, and committed to confinement.</P>
<P>The principal informer upon this occasion was Lord Howard, a man
every way debauched, and who was willing to accept infamy for safety: by his
evidence Russel and Sidney were condemned, and died with that intrepidity
which was worthy a bet∣ter cause. While these men were thus executed,
Monmouth was in the mean time soliciting his par∣don; and he who was most
culpable, as his crime was most unnatural, easily obtained it.</P>
<P>The severities exercised in the latter part of this reign
arose merely from the influence of the Duke <PB N="68" REF="71"/> of York, who
was as much inclined to cruelty by nature, as his brother Charles was prone to
forgive∣ness. His authority was become terrible even to the ministry; by
his advice the King seized upon all the charters of the corporations, in
order to extort mo∣ney for having them renewed. Partiality and op∣pression
were the instruments of his power, and bi∣gotry and innovation the objects of
his aim. At this period the reign of Charles was as absolute as that of any
Monarch in Christendom, and new dis∣contents and treasons were secretly
diffusing their poison, the spirit of liberty still struggling hard
against the spirit of obedience, which the clergy at∣tempted to inculcate.
Another civil war threatened the nation, still more dreadful than the former,
as the forces were more equally divided. But Charles happily died before
those calamities could return; he was suddenly seized with an apoplectic
fit, in the fifty-fourth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of his reign.
The people, though they despised his ad∣ministration, loved his person;
they were willing to bear with the faults of one whose whole behaviour was a
continued instance of good-nature and affabi∣lity; but they were by no means
willing to grant the same indulgence to his successor, whom they hated
for his pride, his religion, his cruelty, and connections. He was unfit to walk
in the irregular steps of his predecessor; and, when he pursued the
same route, fatal experience soon convinced him that he had at once
mistaken himself and the people he attempted to command.</P>
<P>But, though England, during the reign of Charles, seemed still,
in some measure, agitated like the ocean after a storm, yet commerce
continued to increase with its usual celerity and success. The
manufac∣ture of certain stuffs, glass, copper, steel, paper, hats, and
stockings, were now brought to perfec∣tion. Upon the banishing the
Protestants from <PB N="69" REF="72"/> France, numbers came and settled
here, and brought their arts with them. This application to arts and commerce
gave England great weight in the balance of Europe; Britain became the center
of politics and arms. Though literature was but little encouraged by the
Sovereign, yet the learned made great profi∣ciency in every department of
science; and the philosophers of England began to take the lead. Newton,
Tillotson, Burnet, Hobbes, and Shaftes∣bury enlarged the land-marks of
human knowledge; Butler, Dryden, Otway, gave strength and proprie∣ty to the
language. In a word, the character of the nation now began to alter; the
natural rudeness of the inhabitants began to take a polish from good
breeding, and British ferocity to meliorate into cha∣rity and humanity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>AS we descend, we find the materials for English history
increase; the minutest transactions are recorded with prolixity; and
these, however dry and unimproving to some, are yet both interesting and
satisfactory to others. In such a profusion of mate∣rials I must be
content rather to give the spirit of the following reigns, than pretend to
exhibit an hi∣storical detail of particular interests and intrigues. It
will be enough to mark those strong out-lines that may probably escape
the wreck of time, when the internal colouring shall fade. As history
increases in time by the addition of new events, an epitome becomes more
necessary to abridge its excrescences.</P>
<P>The Duke of York, who succeeded his brother, with the title of
King James the Second, had been bred a Papist, and was strongly bigotted to
his prin∣ciples. <PB N="70" REF="73"/> It is the property of that religion,
almost ever, to contract the sphere of the understanding; and, until
people are, in some measure, disengaged from its prejudices, it is
impossible to lay a just claim to extensive views, or consistency
of design. The intellects of this Prince were naturally weak, and his
bigotted principles still rendered them more fee∣ble; he conceived the
ridiculous project of reigning in the same arbitrary manner of his
predecessor, and changing the established religion of his country, at a
time when his person was hated, and the establish∣ed religion was
universally approved.</P>
<P>The people of England were now entirely changed from what they had
been in the times of Henry, Mary, and Elizabeth, who had altered religion at
will. Learning was now as much cultivated by the laity as by the priesthood;
every man now pretended to think for himself, and had rational grounds for
his opinion. In the beginning of the reformation the Monarchs had only to bring
over the clergy, in order totally to change the modes of belief, for the people
were entirely guided by their pastors. To influence the priesthood was an
easy task. The hopes of preferment, or the fears of degradation, entirely
subjected the consciences of the clergy to the royal will. Such it was
then; but the circum∣stances of the nation were, at present, entirely
al∣tered; and, to make a change in religion, it would have been necessary
to tamper with every individual in the state. But James had no idea of the
alter∣ation of circumstances; his situation, he thought, supplied him
with authority, and his zeal furnished him with hope of accomplishing this
chimerical de∣sign.</P>
<P>The success he met with in crushing a rebellion, in the
opening of his reign, seemed to promise a favourable omen towards the
completion of his wishes. The Duke of Monmouth, who had long 
<PB N="71" REF="74"/> been at the head of faction, and inflamed all the
discontent that molested the late King's reign, was now resolved to aim
at the crown. He was the darl∣ing of the people; and some averred that the
King had married his mother, and owned his legitimacy at his death. The Earl of
Argyle seconded his views, and they formed a scheme of a double
insur∣rection. Argyle first landed in Scotland, published his
manifestoes, put himself at the head of two thou∣sand five hundred men,
and attempted to influence the nation; but, a formidable body of the King's
forces coming against him, his army fell away, and he himself, after being
wounded in attempting to escape, was taken by a peasant, standing up to
his neck in water. Being brought to Edinburgh, he prepared for death, well
knowing that it was not in the King's nature to forgive an enemy.</P>
<P>The Duke of Monmouth was not more fortunate; he sailed from the
Texel with three vessels, and ar∣rived on the coasts of Dorsetshire
with about four∣score followers. The country soon flocked in to his
standard, and in two days his army was increased to two thousand men. The
Earl of Feversham was sent to oppose him, and took post at Sedgemore, a
village in Somersetshire. Monmouth resolved to fight him, and began his
march about eleven in the night, with profound silence; but the Royalists
were prepared for his reception. The action began at day-break; Lord Grey, who
commanded the Duke of Monmouth's horse, was routed at the first onset.
The Duke, at the head of his infantry, bravely maintained his ground until he
was charged in flank by the enemy's horse, who had been just now
victo∣rious. A total rout ensued; three hundred were killed in the
engagement, and a thousand in the pursuit. The Duke escaped the carnage,
and, in a shepherd's disguise, fled on foot, attended by a faith∣ful
companion, who had followed his fortunes into <PB N="72" REF="75"/> England.
Thus they travelled onward towards Dor∣setshire, till, quite exhausted
with hunger and fa∣tigue, they lay down in a field, and covered them∣selves
with stubble. In this forlorn situation he was found, with some pease
in his pocket, which he had gathered in the fields to sustain life. His
spirit sunk with his misfortunes; he wrote to the King; im∣plored his
mercy; the King gave him an audience, as if willing to satisfy his vengeance
with the sight of a rival's misery. But his death was determined, and no
intreaties could extort royal clemency. On the seaffold he resumed his
former courage, handled the ax, declared that he meant well to the nation, and
his head was cut off, but not till after the third blow.</P>
<P>But it were happy for the nation, and fortunate for the King, if the
blood that was already shed had been thought a sufficient explation for the
late offence. The victorious army behaved with the most savage cruelty to
the prisoners taken after the battle. Their inhumanity was properly
seconded by Jefferies, who was sent on the western circuit to try the
insurgents. His furious thirst of blood being inflamed by continual
intoxication, he threatened, calumniated, and threw aside even the appearance
of clemency. Men and women indiscrimately felt the effects of his savage
zeal; and not less than two hundred and fifty persons expired under
circum∣stances of wanton cruelty. Cruel Kings ever find cruel
ministers.</P>
<P>It was not to be expected, that these butcheries could acquire the
King the love or the confidence of his people, or tend to alter their opinions,
as they rather excited the secret abhorrence of every honest man. Yet he
thought this a time favourable for the carrying on his scheme of religion and
ar∣bitrary government. An attempt at arbitrary power in Charles was, in some
measure, excusable, as he <PB N="73" REF="76"/> had a republican faction to
oppose; and it might have been prudent, at that time, to overstep
justice, in order to attain security; but the same designs in James
were as unnecessary as impracticable, since there were few republicans
remaining, and the people were satisfied with limited monarchy. But this weak
and deluded Monarch was resolved to imitate one or two Princes of Europe, who
had just before rendered themselves absolute; and he was incited to this
project by Lewis XIV, who secretly desired his de∣struction. Thus
instigated, he began his designs with the measures which he should not
have used till their completion. He sent a splendid embassy to Rome,
to acknowledge his obedience to the Pope. Innocent, who then filled the chair,
was too good a politician to approve those childish measures, and gave
his ambassador a very cool reception. He was sensible that the King was
openly striking at those laws and opinions which it was his business to
un∣dermine in silence and security. The Cardinals were even heard
facetiously to declare, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that the King should be excommunicated for
thus endeavouring to over∣turn the small remains of Popery that yet
subsisted in</HI> England.</Q></P>
<P>James, notwithstanding his discouragements, was yet resolved
to prosecute his favourite scheme with vigour. Upon every occasion the
Catholics shared his confidence and favour. Hugh Peters, his con∣fessor,
ruled his conscience, and drove him blindly forward to attempt innovation. He
became every day more and more ambitious of making converts; the Earl of
Sunderland sacrificed his religion to his ambition; the Earl of Rochester
lost his employ∣ment of treasurer for refusing to alter his religion. The
King stooped so low as to his officers; a rough soldier one day
answered his remonstrances by say∣ing that he was pre-engaged, for he had
promised the King of Morocco, when he was quartered at <PB N="74" REF="77"/>
Tangiers, that, should he ever change his religion, he would turn
Mahometan.</P>
<P>An Ecclesiastical Court was erected, with power to punish all
delinquents, or such so reputed by the court, with all manner of
ecclesiastical censures. Before this court was summoned the
Vice-chancellor of Cambridge, for having refused to admit one Francis, a
Benedictine Monk, to the degree of ma∣ster of arts; the Vice-chancellor was
deprived of his office, but the university persisted in their re∣fusal,
and the King thought proper to desist from his purpose. The
Vice-president and fellows of Magda∣len-college in Oxford were treated with
more seve∣rity. They refused to admit one Farmer, a new convert, and one of
a profligate life, who was nominated by the King to the place of President,
now become vacant. The King next nominated Parker, Bishop of Oxford; but he
was equally ob∣noxious for the same reasons. The King repaired in person
to Oxford; he reproached the fellows with insolence and disobedience; but
neither he, nor his ministers, could prevail to alter the resolutions of
this society. The fellows were expelled by his or∣der, and their places
filled with Papists, who he knew would be more obedient to his commands.</P>
<P>His designs hitherto were sufficiently manifest; but he was
now resolved entirely to throw off the mask. By his permission the
Pope's Nuncio made his public entry into Windsor in his pontificals,
pre∣ceded by the cross, and attended by a great num∣ber of monks in the habit
of their respective orders. He next published a declaration for liberty of
con∣science, by which all restraints upon Popery were taken away. The
Church of England took the alarm; the peculiar animosity of the people
against the Catholic religion proceeded not less from reli∣gious than
temporal motives. It is the spirit of that <PB N="75" REF="78"/> religion to
favour arbitrary power, and its reproach to encourage persecution. The
English had too osten smarted under both to be willing again to sub∣mit
to either. Seven Bishops, who had received the King's express orders to
cause this declaration of liberty of conscience to be read in their
churches, refused to comply. They drew up a modest petition to excuse
their refusal, which only served to increase the King's resentment and
rage. They were cited before the council, and still adhered to their former
resolution with that firmness which is the characteristic of vir∣tue. The
Attorney-general was ordered to prose∣cute them for publishing sedition,
and abridging the King's prerogative. They were committed prisoners to the
Tower, conducted thither amidst the prayers and condolence of an incredible
multitude of the populace, who regarded them as sufferers for truth. The day
appointed for their tryal arrived; this cause was looked upon as the crisis
of English freedom; the council managed the debate on both sides with
learning and candour; the jury withdrew into a chamber, where they passed
the whole night, but next morning returned into court, and declared the
Bishops not guilty. The joy of the people, on this occasion, was
inexpressible; the whole city, and the country around, seemed at once to
catch the shouts of exultation; they even reached the camp, where the King
was then sitting at dinner, who heard them with indignation and
amazement.</P>
<P>If the Bishops testified the readiness of martyrs, in
support of their religion, James shewed no less obstinacy in his
attempts towards the establishment of his own. Finding the clergy averse
to his de∣signs, he next tried what he could do with the army. He thought, if
one regiment would promise implicit obedience, their example would soon
induce others to the same compliance. He ordered one of the re∣giments to be
drawn up in his presence, and desired <PB N="76" REF="79"/> that such as
were against his late declaration of li∣berty should lay down their arms.
He was surprized to see the whole battalion ground their arms, except two
officers and a few Roman Catholic soldiers.</P>
<P>Opposition only served to increase the infatuated Monarch's
zeal; he was continually stimulated by his Queen and his priests to proceed
rashly onward. But he was particularly urged on by the Jesuit Pe∣ters, his
confessor, an ambitious and intriguing priest, whom some historians
have even accused of being the creature of the Prince of Orange, the King's
son-in-law, who had long since conceived hopes of seizing the crown.
James now, therefore, issued orders for prosecuting all those clergymen
who had forborne to read his declaration. He placed one Gifford, a Doctor of
the Sorbonne, at the head of Magdalen College, and likewise nominated him to
the see of Oxford, lately become vacant. Every member of the Church of
England now saw their danger; and Whigs and Tories united their efforts to
oppose it.</P>
<P>William, Prince of Orange, had married Mary the daughter of King
James. This Prince had been early immersed in danger, calamities, and
politics; the designs of France, and the turbulence of Hol∣land, had served
to sharpen his talents, and given him a propensity for intrigue. This great
politician and soldier concealed beneath a phlegmatic appear∣ance, a most
violent and boundless ambition, all his actions were levelled at power, while
his discourse ne∣ver betrayed the wishes of his heart. His temper was
cold and severe, his genius active and piercing; he was valiant without
ostentation, and politic without address; disdaining the pleasures, or
the elegancies of life, yet eager after the phantom of pre-eminence. He was no
stranger to the murmurs of the English, and was resolved to turn them to
his interest. He <PB N="77" REF="80"/> therefore accepted the invitations of
the nobility and others, and still more willingly embarked in the cause, as
he found the malecontents had concerted their measures with prudence and
secrecy.</P>
<P>A fleet was equipped sufficient to transport fifteen thousand
troops; and it was at first given out that this armament was designed
against France. James, at length, began to see his own errors and the
dis∣contents of the people; he would now have retracted his measures in
favour of Popery, but it was too late; the fleet of the Prince was already
sailed, and had landed thirteen thousand troops at the village of Broxholme
in Torbay.</P>
<P>The expectations of the Prince of Orange seemed, at first, to be
frustrated; very few Englishmen of∣fered him their services, though the
people were, in general, well affected to his design. Slight repulses were
not sufficient to intimidate a general who had, from early youth, encountered
adversity; he conti∣nued ten days in expectation of being joined by the
malecontents without success; but, just when he be∣gan to deliberate
about reimbarking his forces, he was joined by several persons of
consequence, and the country people came flocking to his standard. From
this day his numbers began to increase; the nobility, which had composed
the court and council of King James, now left their old Master to solicit
protection from the new.</P>
<P>Lewis XIV. had long foreseen this defection, and had formerly
offered the King thirty thousand men for his security. This was then
refused by James, by the advice of Sunderland, his favourite, who was
secretly in the interests of the Prince of Orange. James, however, now
requested assistance from France, when it was too late for his
service: he wrote in vain to Leopold, Emperor of Germany, who only returned
for answer, that what he had foreseen had happened. He had some
dependence on his fleet, <PB N="78" REF="81"/> but they were entirely
disaffected. In a word, his interests were deserted by all; for he had
long de∣serted them himself. He was at the head of an army of twenty
thousand men, and it is possible that, had he led them to the combat
without granting them time for deliberation, they might have fought in his
favour; but he was involved in a maze of fears and suspicions; the
defection of those he most con∣fided in took away his power of
deliberation, and his perplexity was increased, when told that the Prince of
Denmark and Anne, his favourite daughter, had gone over to the Prince of
Orange. In this exigence he could not repress his tears, but in the agony of
his heart was heard to exclaim, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>God help me, my own children have forsaken
me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>He now hung over the precipice of destruction! invaded by one
son-in-law, abandoned by another, hated by his subjects, and detested by
those who had suffered beneath his cruelty. He assembled the few
noblemen who still adhered to his interests, and de∣manded their advice and
assistance. Addressing him∣self to the Earl of Bedford, father to
Lord Russel, who was beheaded by James's intrigues in the pre∣ceding reign,

<Q REND="inline"><HI>My Lord,</HI> said he, <HI>you are an honest
man, have great credit, and can do me signal service.</HI></Q> 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Ah, Sir,</HI> replied the Earl, <HI>I am old and
feeble, I can do you but little service; but I once had a son that could
have assisted you, but he is no more.</HI></Q> James was so struck
with this reply, that he could not speak for some minutes.</P>
<P>The King was naturally timid; and some counsel∣lors about him,
either sharing his fears, or bribed by the Prince, contributed to increase
his apprehensions. They reminded him of the fate of Charles I, and
ag∣gravated the turbulence of the people. He was, at length, persuaded to
think of flying from a nation he could no longer govern, and of taking refuge
at the court of France, where he was sure of finding <PB N="79" REF="82"/>
assistance and protection. Thus instructed, he first sent away his
Queen, who arrived safely at Calais; and soon after, disguising
himself in a plain dress, he went down to Feversham, and embarked on
board a small vessel for France. His misfortunes still con∣tinued to
follow him; the vessel was detained by the common people, who not knowing
their Sovereign, robbed, insulted, and abused him. He was now per∣suaded
by the Earl of Winchelsea to return to Lon∣don, where he was once more
received amidst the acclamations of the people.</P>
<P>The return of James was by no means agreeable to William, though he
well knew how to dissemble. It was his interest and his design to
increase the for∣saken Monarch's apprehensions, so as to induce him to
fly. He therefore received the news of his return with a haughty air, and
ordered him to leave White∣hall, and retire to Richmond. The King
remon∣strated against Richmond, and desired that Rochester might be
appointed as the place of his abode. The Prince perceived his intention was to
leave the king∣dom; nor did one wish for flight more ardently than did the
other desire him away. The King soon con∣curred with his designs: after
staying but a short time at Rochester, he fled to the sea-side,
attended by his natural son the Duke of Berwick, where he embarked for
France, and arrived in safety, to en∣joy, for the rest of life, the empty
title of a King, and the appellation of a Saint, a title which still
flat∣tered him more. Here he continued to reside among a people who pitied,
ridiculed, and despised him. He inrolled himself in the order of
Jesuits; and the court of Rome, for whom he had lost all, repaid him only
with indulgences and pasquinades.</P>
<P>From this moment the constitution of England, that had fluctuated
for so many ages, was fixed. The nation, represented by its parliament,
deter∣mined <PB N="80" REF="83"/> the long contested limits between the King
and the people; they prescribed to the Prince of Orange the terms by which he
was to rule; they chose him for King, jointly with Mary, who was the next
Protestant heir to the crown. They were crowned with titles of William III.
and Mary, King and Queen of England. The Prince saw his ambi∣tion, at length,
gratified; and his wisdom was repaid with that crown which the folly of his
predecessor had given away.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH William was chosen King of Eng∣land, his power was limited
on every side; and the opposition he met with from his parliaments still
lessened the regal authority. His sway in Hol∣land, where he was but the
Stadtholder, was far more arbitrary; so that he might, with greater
propriety, have been called the King of the United Provinces, and the
Stadtholder of England. He was not suffi∣ciently acquainted with the
difficulty of governing the nation by which he was elected; he expected in them
a people ready to second the views of his am∣bition in humbling France; but
he found them more apt to fear for the invasion of their domestic liberties
from himself.</P>
<P>His reign commenced, however, with the same attempt which had been
the principal cause of all the disturbances in the preceding reign, and had
ex∣cluded the Monarch from the throne. William was a Calvinist, and naturally
averse to persecution. He therefore began by attempting to repeal those
laws that enjoined uniformity of worship; and, though he could not entirely
succeed in his design, yet a tole∣ration <PB N="81" REF="84"/> was granted
to such Dissenters as should take the oaths of allegiance, and hold no
private conven∣ticles. The Papists also enjoyed the lenity of his
government; and, though the laws against them con∣tinued to subsist,
yet they were seldom put into rigo∣rous execution. What was criminal in James
was virtuous in his successor: James only wanted to in∣troduce
persecution by pretending to disown it; Wil∣liam was averse to
persecution from principle; and none suffered for religious opinions during
his reign.</P>
<P>But, though William was acknowledged in Eng∣land, Scotland was
still undetermined. The parlia∣ment of that country, however, soon
recognized his authority, and took that opportunity to abolish epis∣copacy,
which had been long disagreeable to the na∣tion. Nothing now remained to the
deposed Mo∣narch, of all his former dominions, but Ireland. His cause was
espoused by all the Catholics of that coun∣try, who were much more numerous
there than those of the Protestant persuasion. The King of France,
either touched with compassion for his sufferings, or willing to weaken a
rival kingdom by internal dis∣sensions, granted James a fleet and some
troops, to assert his claims there. On the seventh day of May this
unhappy Monarch embarked at Brest, and on the twenty-second arrived at
Kinsale. He was re∣ceived by the Catholics of Ireland with open arms. The
Protestants, who were unanimously attached to King William, had been
previously disarmed by Tyr∣connel, their Lord-lieutenant, and a Papist.
James made his public entry into Dublin amidst the accla∣mations of the
inhabitants. He was met by a Popish procession, bearing the host, which
he publicly adored; and this served to alienate the few Protestants of that
kingdom, who still adhered to his cause. A small party of that religion
were resolved to defend their lives and religion in the little city of
London-derry. They were besieged by the forces of King <PB N="82" REF="85"/>
James, and suffered all the complicated miseries of war, famine, and
bigotted cruelty; but, deter∣mined never to yield, they rejected capitulation,
and always repulsed the besiegers with considerable loss. At length,
supplies and succours arriving from Eng∣land, King James's army thought
proper to raise the siege.</P>
<P>The cruelties exercised upon the Protestants were as shocking
as unnecessary; soldiers were permitted to pillage them without
redress; and they were com∣pelled to accept base money in exchange for
those commodities they were forced to sell. But their suf∣ferings were
soon to have a period. The Duke of Schomberg was sent over, with
assistance; and Wil∣liam himself soon after followed, and landed at
Car∣rickfergus. He was met by numbers of the Protes∣tants, who had fled from
persecution; and now, at the head of six-and-thirty thousand men, he was
re∣solved to go in quest of the enemy. Having march∣ed to Dundalk, and then
to Ardee, he, at length, came in sight of the Irish army. The river Boyne
lay between the two armies, the front of the Irish being secured by a
morass and a rising ground. These obstacles were insufficient to
prevent the ar∣dour of William, who, when his friend the Duke of Schomberg
expostulated upon the danger boldly, repli∣ed, That a tardy victory would be
worse than a defeat. The Duke, finding his advice not relished, retired to
his tent in a melancholy manner, as if he had a prescience of his own
misfortune. Early in the morning, at six o'clock, King William gave orders to
pass the river; the army passed in three different places, and the battle
began with unusual vigour. The Irish troops, which have been reckoned the
best in Europe abroad, have always fought indiffer∣ently at home; they fled,
after a long resistance, with precipitation, and left the French and
Swiss regi∣ments, who came to their assistance, to make the 
<PB N="83" REF="86"/> best retreat they could. William led on his horse in
person, and contributed, by his activity and vigilance, to secure the
victory. James was not in the battle, but stood aloof, during the action, on
the hill of Dunmore, surrounded with some squadrons of horse; and, at
intervals, was heard to exclaim, when he saw his own troops repulsing the
enemy, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>O spare my Eng∣lish subjects.</HI></Q> The
Irish lost about fifteen hundred men, and the English about one third of
that num∣ber; but the death of the Duke of Schomberg, who was shot as he was
crossing the water, seemed to out∣weigh all the numbers of the enemy. He
had been long a soldier of fortune, and fought under almost every power in
Europe. His skill in war was un∣paralleled, and his fidelity equal to his
courage. The number of battles in which he had been per∣sonally engaged, was
said to equal the number of his years; and he died aged eighty-two. James
fled, regardless of the safety of his soldiers. William rode round the
scene of slaughter, relieving the wounded, as well of the enemy's troops as
his own. O Regan, an old Irish captain, was heard to say upon this
oc∣casion, That, if the English would exchange gene∣rals, the conquered
army would fight the battle over again.</P>
<P>This blow totally depressed the hopes of James; he fled to
Dublin, advised the magistrates to get the best terms they could from the
victor, then set out for Waterford, where he embarked for France, in a
vessel prepared for his reception. Had he possessed either conduct
or courage, he might still have headed his troops, and fought with advantage;
but prudence forsook him with good fortune.</P>
<P>His friends were still resolved to second his inter∣ests,
though he had abandoned them himself. After his retreat, another desperate
battle was fought at Aughrim, in which his adversaries were again
victo∣rious; Limeric, a strong city in the southern part of 
<PB N="84" REF="87"/> the kingdom, still held out in his favour. This city was
besieged, and made a brave defence; but, de∣spairing of the King's
fortunes, the garrison, at length, capitulated; the Roman Catholics, by this
capitulation, were restored to the enjoyment of such liberty in the
exercise of their religion, as they had possessed in the reign of
Charles II; and about fourteen thousand of those who had fought in favour
of King James, had permission to go over to France, and transports were
provided for their reception.</P>
<P>The conqueft os Ireland being thus completed, the only hopes of
the fugitive King now depended on the assistance of Lewis XIV, who
promised to make a descent upon England in his favour. The French King was
punctual; he supplied the fugitive Monarch with an army consisting of a
body of French troops, some English and Scotch refugees, and the Irish
regiments which had been transported from Limeric into France, by long
difcipline, now become excellent soldiers. This army was assembled
between Cherbourg and La Hogue; King James commanded it in person; and more
than three hundred transports were provided for landing it on the English
shore. Tourville, the French admiral, at the head of sixty-three ships of
the line, was appointed to favour the descent, and had orders to attack the
enemy, if they should attempt to oppose him. All things conspired to
revive the hopes of the hitherto unfortunate King.</P>
<P>These preparations on the side of France were soon known at
the court of England, and precautions were taken for a vigorous opposition;
all the secret machinations of the banished King's adherents were early
discovered to the English ministry by spies; and they took proper
measures to defeat them. Ad∣miral Russel was ordered to put to sea with
all pos∣sible expedition; and he soon appeared with ninety-nine ships
of the line, besides frigates and fireships. Both fleets met at La Hogue.
On the success of <PB N="85" REF="88"/> this engagement all the hopes of
James depended; but the victory was on the side of the English, and of
num∣bers; the fight continued ten hours, and the pursuit two days; fifteen
French men of war were destroyed; and the blow was so decisive, that from
that time France seemed to relinquish her claims to the ocean.</P>
<P>James was now reduced to the lowest ebb of de∣spondence; his
designs upon England were quite frustrated; nothing was now left his
friends but ter∣rors and despair, or the hopes of assassinating the
Monarch on the throne. These base attempts, as barbarous as they were
useless, were not intirely dis∣agreeable to the temper of James: it is
said, he en∣couraged and proposed them; but they all ended in the
destruction of their undertakers. He passed the rest of his days at St.
Germains, a pensioner on the bounties of Lewis, and assisted by
occasional libera∣lities from his daughter, and friends in England. He died
in 1700, at St. Germains. Some pretend that miracles were wrought at his tomb.
We have seen few deposed Kings that have not died with a reputa∣tion for
sanctity.</P>
<P>The defeat at La Hogue confirmed King William's safety and title
to the crown: the Jacobites were now a feeble and a disunited faction; new
parties therefore arose among those who had been friends of the revolution,
and William found as much oppo∣sition from his parliament at home, as from
the ene∣my in the field. His chief motive for accepting the crown was to engage
England more deeply in the concerns of Europe. It had ever been his ambition to
humble the French, whom he considered as the most formidable enemies of
that liberty which he idolized; and all his politics lay in making alliances
against them. Many of the English, on the other hand, had neither the
same animosity against the French, nor the same terrors of their
increasing power; they therefore considered the interests of the 
<PB N="86" REF="89"/> nation as sacrificed to foreign connections, and
com∣plained, that the war on the continent fell most hea∣vily on them, though
they had the least interest in its success. To these motives of
discontent was added his partiality to his own countrymen, in pre∣judice of
English subjects, together with his proud reserve and sullen silence,
so unlike the behaviour of all their former Kings. William heard their
complaints with the most phlegmatic indifference; the interests of Europe
alone employed all his atten∣tion; but, while he incessantly waked over the
schemes of contending Kings and nations, he was unmindful of the cultivation
of internal polity. Pa∣triotism was ridiculed as an ideal virtue; the
prac∣tice of bribing a majority in parliament became uni∣versal. The example
of the great was caught up by the vulgar; all principle, and even decency, was
gradually banished; talents lay uncultivated; and the ignorant and profligate
were received into favour.</P>
<P>William, upon accepting the crown, was resolved to preserve, as
much as he was able, the privileges of a Sovereign. He was, as yet, intirely
unacquainted with the nature of a limited monarchy, which was not then
thoroughly understood in any part of Eu∣rope, except England alone. He
therefore often controverted the views of his parliament, and was directed by
arbitrary councils. One of the first in∣stances of this was, in the
opposition he gave to the bill for triennial parliaments; it had past the
two houses, and was sent up to receive the royal assent, which William
refused to grant; the commons then voted, that whoever advised the King to
this mea∣sure, was an enemy to his country. The bill, thus rejected, lay
dormant for another season; and, being again brought in, the King found
himself obliged, though reluctantly, to comply. The same opposi∣tion, and
the same success, attended a bill for regu∣lating tryals in cases of
high treason, by which the <PB N="87" REF="90"/> accused was allowed a copy
of his indictment, and a list of the names of his jury, two days before his
tryal, together with council to plead in his de∣fence. That no person
should be indicted, but upon the oaths of two faithful witnesses. This
was one of the most salutary laws that had been long enact∣ed; but, while
penal statutes were mitigated on one hand, they were strangely increased
by a number of others.</P>
<P>The great business of the parliament, from this period, seemed
to consist in restraining corrup∣tion, and bringing such to justice,
as had grown wealthy from the plunder of the public. The num∣ber of laws that
were now enacted every session, seemed calculated for the safety of
the subject; but, in reality, were symptoms of the universal corrup∣tion.
The more corrupt the commonwealth, the more numerous are the laws.</P>
<P>William was willing to admit all the restraints they chose to
lay on the royal prerogative in Eng∣land, upon condition of being properly
supplied with the means of humbling the power of France. War, and foreign
politics, were all he knew, or desired to understand. The sums of money
granted him for the prosecution of this war were incredible; and the nation,
not contented with furnishing him with such supplies as they were
immediately capable of raising, involved themselves in debts, which they
have never since been able to discharge. For all this profu∣sion England
received, in return, the empty reward of military glory in Flanders, and the
conscious∣ness of having given the Dutch, whom they saved, frequent
opportunities of being ungrateful.</P>
<P>The treaty of Ryswick, at length, put an end to a war, in which
England had engaged without in∣terest, and came off without advantage. In the
ge∣neral pacification her interests seemed intirely de∣serted; and, for
all her blood and treasure, the only <PB N="88" REF="91"/> equivalent she
received, was, the King of France's acknowledgment of King William's title to
the crown.</P>
<P>The King, now freed from a foreign war, laid himself out to
strengthen his authority at home. He conceived hopes of keeping up the forces
that were granted him, in time of war, during the conti∣nuance of the peace;
but he was not a little mor∣tified to find that the commons had passed a
vote, that all the forces in English pay, exceeding seven thousand men,
should be forthwith disbanded; and that those retained should be
natural English sub∣jects. A standing army was this Monarch's greatest
delight; he had been bred up in camps, and knew no other pleasure but that of
reviewing troops, or dictating to generals. He professed himself
therefore entirely displeased with the proposal; and his indig∣nation was
kindled to such a pitch, that he actually conceived a design of abandoning
the government. His ministers, however, diverted him from this re∣solution,
and persuaded him to consent to passing the bill. Such were the
altercations between the King and his parliament; which continued dur∣ing his
reign. He considered his commons as a set of men desirous of power, and
consequently resolved upon obstructing all his projects. He seemed but
little attached to any party in the house; he veered from Whigs to Tories, as
interest, or immediate exi∣gence, demanded. England he considered as a
place of labour, anxiety, and altercation. He used to re∣tire to his seat
at Loo in Holland, for those moments which he dedicated to pleasure or
tranquility. It was in this quiet retreat he planned the different
succes∣sions of Europe, and laboured to undermine the po∣litics of Lewis
XIV, his insidious rival in power, and in fame. Against France his
resentment was ever levelled, and he had made vigorous preparations for
entering into a new war with that kingdom, <PB N="89" REF="92"/> when death
interrupted the execution of his schemes. He was naturally of a very feeble
constitution, and it was now almost exhausted by a life of continual
action and care. He endeavoured to conceal the defects of his infirmities, and
repair his health by riding. In one of his excursions to Hampton-court, his
horse fell under him, and he himself was thrown off with such violence
that his collar-bone was frac∣tured. This, in a robust constitution, would
have been a trifling misfortune, but to him it was fatal. Perceiving his end
approach, the objects of his for∣mer care still lay next his heart; the
interests of Europe still filled him with concern. The Earl of Albemarle
arriving from Holland, he conferred with him in private on the posture of
affairs abroad. Two days after, having received the sacrament from
Arch∣bishop Tennison, he expired, in the fifty-second year of his age,
after having reigned thirteen years.</P>
<P>William left behind him the character of a great politician, though
he had never been popular; and a formidable general, though he was seldom
victo∣rious; his deportment was grave and sullen, nor did he ever shew any
fire, but in the day of battle. He de∣spised flattery, yet loved dominion.
Greater as the general of Holland, than the King of England; to the one he was
a father, to the other a fuspicious friend. He scrupled not to employ the
engines of corruption to gain his ends; and, while he increased the power of
the nation he was brought to govern, he contributed, in some measure, to
corrupt their morals.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>THE distresses occasioned by the death of Princes are not
so great, or so sincere, as the sufferers would fondly persuade us.
The loss of King William was, at first thought, irreparable; but the
prosperity of the kingdom seemed to acquire new vigour under his
successor Queen Anne. This Princess was the second daughter of King
James by his first wife; she was, by the mother's side descended from
Chan∣cellor Hyde, afterwards the Earl of Clarendon; and had been married to the
Prince of Denmark, before her accession to the crown. She ascended the
throne in the thirty-eighth year of her age, having under∣gone many
vicissitudes after the expulsion of her father, and many severe
mortifications during the reign of the late King. But, naturally
possessed of an even serene temper, she either was insensible
of the disrespect shewn her, or had wisdom to conceal her
resentment.</P>
<P>She came to the throne with the same hostile dis∣positions
toward France, in which the late Monarch died. She was wholly guided by the
Countess of Marlborough, a woman of masculine spirit, and re∣markable for
intrigue, both in politics and gallantry. This lady advised a vigorous
exertion of the English power against France, as she had already marked
the Earl, her husband, for conducting all the opera∣tions both in the cabinet
and the field. Thus in∣fluenced, the Queen took early measures to confirm her
allies, the Dutch, with assurances of union and assistance.</P>
<P>Lewis XIV, now grown familiar with disappoint∣ment and disgrace,
yet still spurring on an exhausted kingdom to second the views of his
ambition, expect∣ed, from the death of King William, a field open for
conquests and glory. The vigilance of his late rival <PB N="91" REF="94"/> had
blasted his laurels, and circumscribed his power; for, even after a defeat,
William still was formidable. At the news of his death therefore the French
Mo∣narch could not suppress his joy, and his court at Versailles seemed
to have forgotten its usual decorum in the sincerity of their rapture. But
their pleasure was soon to determine; a much more formidable ene∣my was now
rising up to oppose them; a more able warrior, one backed by the efforts of
an indulgent mistress and a willing nation.</P>
<P>Immediately, upon the Queen's accession, war was declared
against the French King, and that Mo∣narch was accused of attempting to
unite the crown of Spain to his own dominions, by placing his grand∣son upon
the throne of that kingdom; thus attempt∣ing to destroy the equality of power
among the states of Europe. This declaration was soon seconded with
vigorous efforts; an alliance was formed be∣tween the Imperialists, the
Dutch, and the English, who contributed more to the support of the war than
the other two united. Marlborough was sent over to command the English
army, and the allies declared him generalissimo of all their forces. Never
was a man better calculated for debate and action than he; se∣rene in the
midst of danger, and cool in all the fury of battle. While his Countess
governed the Queen, his intrigues governed the kingdom. An indefati∣gable
warrior while in camp, and a skilful politician in courts; he thus became the
most fatal enemy to France that England had produced, since the con∣quering
times of Cressy and Agincourt.</P>
<P>This general had learned the art of war under the famous Marshal
Turenne, having been a voluntier in his army. He, at that time, went by the
name of the <HI>Handsome Englishman;</HI> but Turenne foresaw his future
greatness. He now gave the first proofs of his wisdom by advancing the
subaltern officers, whose merit had hitherto been neglected; he gained the 
<PB N="92" REF="95"/> enemy's posts without fighting, ever advancing, and
never losing one advantage which he had gained. To this general was
opposed, on the side of France, the Duke of Burgundy, grandson of the
King, a youth more qualified to grace a court, than conduct an army; the
Marshal Bouflers commanded under him, a man of courage and activity. But
these quali∣ties in both were forced to give way to the superior powers of
their adversary; after having been forced to retire by the skilful marches
of Marlborough, af∣ter having seen several towns taken, they gave up all
hopes of acting offensively, and concluded the campaign with resolutions to
prosecute the next with greater vigour.</P>
<P>Marlborough, upon his return to London, re∣ceived the rewards of his
merit, being thanked by the house of commons, and created a Duke by the
Queen. The success of one campaign ever spurs on the English to aim at
new triumphs. Marlborough next season returned to the field, with larger
autho∣rity, and greater confidence from his former success. He began the
campaign by taking Bonne, the residence of the Elector of Cologne; he next
retook Huys, Limbourg, and became master of all the Lower Rhine. The
Marshal Villeroy, son to the King of France's governor, and educated with
him, was now general of the French army. He was ever a favourite of Lewis, had
shared his pleasures and his campaigns. He was brave, virtuous, and polite;
but unequal to the great task of command; and still more so, when
opposed to so great a rival.</P>
<P>Marlborough, sensible of the abilities of his an∣tagonist, was
resolved, instead of immediately op∣posing him, to fly to the succour
of the Emperor, his ally, who loudly requested his assistance, being
press∣ed on every side by a victorious enemy. The Eng∣lish general was
resolved to strike a vigorous blow for his relief, took with him about
thirteen thousand <PB N="93" REF="96"/> English troops, traversed
extensive countries with an hasty march, arrived at the banks of the
Danube, defeated a body of French and Bavarians stationed at Donavert to
oppose him, passed the Danube, and laid the Dukedom of Bavaria, that had
sided with the French, under contribution. Villeroy, who at first attempted
to follow his motions, seemed, all at once, to have lost sight of his
enemy; nor was he apprized of his route, till he was informed of his
successes.</P>
<P>Marshal Tallard prepared, by another route, to obstruct the Duke
of Marlborough's retreat, with thirty thousand men. He was soon after
joined by the Duke of Bavaria's forces; so that the French army amounted to a
body of sixty thousand disci∣plined veterans, commanded by the two best
reputed generals at that time in France. Tallard had esta∣blished his
reputation by former victories; he was active, penetrating, and had risen by
the dint of me∣rit alone. But this ardour often rose to impetuosi∣ty; and
he was so short-sighted as to be unable to distinguish at the
smallest distance; and the Duke was remarkable for his resolution and
personal bra∣very. On the other hand, the Duke of Marlbo∣rough was now joined
by the Prince Eugene, a ge∣neral bred up from his infancy in camps, and equal
to Marlborough in intrigue and military knowledge. Their talents were
congenial; and all their designs seemed to flow but from one source.
Their army, when combined, amounted to about fifty-two thou∣sand men; troops
that had been accustomed to con∣quer, and had seen the French, the Turks,
and the Russians fly before them. As this battle, both from the talents of
the generals, the improvements in the art of war, the number and discipline
of the troops, and the greatness of the contending powers, is reckoned the
most remarkable of this century, it demands a more particular detail.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97"/> The French were posted on an hill, their
right being covered by the Danube, and the village of Blenheim, and commanded
by Marshal Tallard; their left was defended by a village, and headed by the
Elector and Marsin, an experienced French ge∣neral. In the front of their
army ran a rivulet, the banks of which were steep, and the bottom marshy.
Marlborough and Eugene went together to observe the posture of the French
forces. Notwithstanding their advantageous situation, they were resolved
to attack them immediately. The battle began between twelve and one in the
afternoon. Marlborough, at the head of the English troops, having passed
the rivulet, attacked the cavalry of Tallard in the right. This general was at
that time reviewing the dispo∣sition of his troops in the left; and the
cavalry fought for some time without the presence of their general. Prince
Eugene, on the left, had not yet attacked the forces of the Elector; and it was
an hour before he could bring his forces up to the engagement.</P>
<P>Tallard had no sooner understood that his right was attacked by
the Duke, but he flew to its head. He found a furious encounter already begun,
his ca∣valry thrice repulsed, and rallied as often. He had a large body of
forces in the village of Blenheim; he made an attempt to bring them to the
charge. They were attacked by a part of Marlborough's forces so vigorously,
that, instead of assisting the main body, they could hardly maintain
their ground. All the French cavalry, being now attacked in flank, was totally
defeated. The English army, thus half victo∣rious, pierced up between the two
bodies of the French, commanded by the Marshal and the Elec∣tor, while at the
same time the forces in the village of Blenheim were separated by another
detachment. In this terrible situation Tallard flew to rally some
squadrons, but, from the weakness of his sight, mis∣taking a detachment
of the enemy for his own, he <PB N="95" REF="98"/> was taken prisoner by the
Hessian troops, who were in English pay. In the mean time, Prince Eu∣gene
on the left, after having been thrice repulsed, put the enemy into
confusion. The rout then be∣came general, and the flight precipitate. The
con∣sternation was such that the French soldiers threw themselves into
the Danube, without knowing where they fled. The officers lost all their
authority; there was no general left to secure a retreat. The allies were now
masters of the field of battle, and sur∣rounded the village of Blenheim,
where a body of thirteen thousand had been posted in the beginning of the
action, and still kept their ground. These troops, seeing themselves
cut off from all communi∣cation with the rest of the army, threw down their
arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Thus ended the battle
of Blenheim, one of the most complete victories that was ever obtained.
Twelve thousand French and Bavarians were slain in the field, or drowned in
the Danube; thirteen thousand were made prisoners of war. Of the allies
about five thousand men were killed, and eight thousand wounded or
taken.</P>
<P>The loss of the battle is imputed to two capital er∣rors committed
by Marshal Tallard; first weaken∣ing the center by detaching such a
number of troops to the village of Blenheim, and then suffering the
confederates to pass the rivulet, and form unmolest∣ed. The next day, when
the Duke of Marlborough visited his prisoner, the Marshal paid him the
com∣pliment of having overcome the best troops in the world. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I hope, Sir,</HI> replied the Duke, <HI>you will
except those by whom they were conquered.</HI></Q></P>
<P>A country of an hundred leagues extent fell, by this defeat, into
the hands of the victor.</P>
<P>Having thus succeeded beyond his hopes, the Duke once more
returned to England, where he found the people in a transport of joy; he was
welcomed as an <PB N="96" REF="99"/> hero, who had retrieved the glory of the
nation; and the Queen, the parliament, and the people were ready to second
him in all his designs. The manor of Woodstock was conferred upon him for
his ser∣vices; and the Lord-keeper, in the name of the Peers, honoured him
with that praise he so well de∣served.</P>
<P>The success of the last campaign induced the English to
increase their supplies for the next, and the Duke had fixed upon the
Moselle for the scene of action; but being disappointed by Prince Lewis,
who promised his assistance, he returned to the Ne∣therlands to
oppose Villeroy, who, in his absence, undertook the siege of Liege.
Villeroy, having re∣ceived advice of the Duke's approach, abandoned his
enterprize, and retreated within his lines. Marlbo∣rough was resolved to
force them. He led his troops to the charge; after a warm but short
engagement the enemy's horse were defeated with great slaughter. The
infantry, being abandoned, retreated in great disorder to an advantageous
post, where they again drew up in order of battle. Had the Duke been
per∣mitted to take advantage of their consternation, as he proposed, it is
possible he might have gained a com∣plete victory; but he was opposed by
the Dutch offi∣cers, who represented it in such a light to the Depu∣ties of
the States, that they refused to consent to its execution. This timidity
was highly resented in England, and laid the first foundation of
suspecting the Dutch fidelity; they were secretly accused of a desire
to protract the war, by which they alone of all the powers of Europe were
gainers.</P>
<P>While the arms of England were crowned with success in the
Netherlands, they were not less for∣tunate in Spain, where efforts were made
to fix Charles, Duke of Austria, upon the throne. The greatest part of that
kingdom had declared in favour of Philip IV, grandson to Lewis XIV, who had 
<PB N="97" REF="100"/> been nominated successor by the late King of
Spain's will. We have already seen, that, by a former treaty among the powers
of Europe, Charles of Au∣stria was appointed heir to that crown; and this
treaty had been guarantied by France herself, who now intended to reverse
it in favour of a descendant of the house of Bourbon. Charles, therefore
entered Spain, assisted by the arms of England; and invited by the
Catalonians, who had declared in his favour. He was furnished with two
hundred transports, thirty ships of war, nine thousand men, and the Earl
of Peterborough, a man of even romantic bravery, was placed at their head.</P>
<P>One of the first exploits of these forces was to take Gibraltar,
which had hitherto been deemed impreg∣nable. A ledge of lofty rocks defended it
almost on every side by land, and an open and stormy bay took away all
security for shipping by sea. A few troops were therefore capable of
defending it against the most numerous armies. The security of the
garri∣son proved their ruin. A detachment of eighteen hundred marines were
landed upon that neck of level ground which joins it to the continent. These
were incapable of attempting any thing effectual, and even destitute of hopes
of succeeding. A body of sailors, in boats, were ordered to attack an
half-ruined mole; they took possession of the platform, unterrified by
a mine that blew up an hundred men in the air; with the utmost intrepidity
they kept their ground, and, being soon joined by other seamen, took a
redoubt, be∣tween the mole and the town, by storm. The go∣vernor was now
obliged to capitulate; and the Prince of Hesse entered the town, amazed at
the success of so desperate an enterprize. This was a glorious and an
useful acquisition to the British dominions; their trade to the
Mediterranean was thus secured; and they had here a repository capable of
containing all <PB N="98" REF="101"/> things necessary for the repairing of
fleets, or the equipment of armies.</P>
<P>Soon after the taking this important garrison, the English
fleet, now mistress of the seas, attacked the French Admiral, who
commanded fifty-two ships of war. After an obstinate contest the
English became victorious; the French fleet sailed away, nor could it be
brought again to the engagement, though the losses on either side were
equal. This may be rec∣koned the final effort of France by sea: in all
sub∣sequent engagements their chief care was rather to consult means of
escape than of victory. Nor yet were the French and Spaniards willing to
suffer Gibraltar to be taken, without an effort for reprisal. Philip sent
an army to retake it, and France a fleet of thir∣teen ships of the line; both
were equally unsuccess∣ful; part of the fleet was dispersed by a
tempest, and another part taken by the English; while the army, having made
little or no progress by land, was oblig∣ed to abandon the enterprize.</P>
<P>Nor were the English less successful in asserting the
title of Charles to the kingdom. Their army was commanded by the Earl of
Peterborough, one of the most singular and extraordinary men of the age. At
fifteen he fought against the Moors in Africa; at twenty he assisted in
compassing the re∣volution. He now carried on this war in Spain, al∣most
at his own expence; and his friendship for the Duke Charles was his
strongest motive to undertake it. He was deformed in person, but, of a
mind the most generous and active that ever inspired an honest bosom.
His first attempt in Spain was to besiege Barcelona, a strong city, with
a garrison of five thousand men, while his own army amounted to but seven
thousand. Never was an attempt more bold, or more fortunate. The operations
began by a sud∣den attack on fort Monjuice, strongly situated on an 
<PB N="99" REF="102"/> hill, that commanded the city. The outworks were taken by
storm; a shell chanced to fall into the body of the fort, and blew up the
magazine of powder; the garrison of the fort was struck with
consterna∣tion, and surrendered without farther resistance. The town
still remained unconquered; the English general erected batteries against
it, and, in a few days, the governor capitulated. During the interval of
capitulation, the Germans and Catalonians in the English army had entered the
town, and were plun∣dering all before them. The governor thought him∣self
betrayed: he upbraided the treachery of the ge∣neral. Peterborough flew among
the plunderers, drove them from their prey, and returned soon after cooly to
finish the capitulation. The Spaniards were equally amazed at the
generosity of the English, and the baseness of their own countrymen,
who had led on to the spoil.</P>
<P>The conquest of all Valencia succeeded the tak∣ing of this
important place; the enemy, after a de∣seated attempt to retake Barcelona,
saw themselves deprived of almost every hope; the party of Charles was
increasing every day; he became master of Ara∣gon, Carthagena, and Granada;
the road to Madrid, their capital city, lay open before him; the Earl of
Galloway entered it in triumph, and there proclaimed Charles King of Spain,
without farther opposition.</P>
<P>The English had scarce time to rejoice at these
successes of their arms, when their attention was turned to new victories
in Flanders. The Duke of Marlborough had early commenced the campaign, and
brought an army of eighty thousand men into the field, and still expected
reinforcements from Denmark and Prussia. The court of France wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> resolved to attack him before this
junction. Ville¦roy, who commanded an army consisting of eight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thousand men, near Tirlemont, had
orders to en¦gage. He accordingly drew up his forces in a stron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <PB N="100" REF="103"/> camp; his right
was flanked by the river Mehaigne, his left was posted behind a marsh, and
the village of Ramillies lay in the center. Marlborough, who perceived this
disposition, drew up his army accord∣ingly. He knew that the enemies left
could not pass the marsh, to attack him, but at a great disadvan∣tage; he
therefore weakened his troops on that quar∣ter, and thundered on the center
with superior num∣bers. They stood but a short time in the center, and,
at length, gave way on all sides. The horse abandoned their foot, and were
so closely pursued, that almost all were cut in pieces. Six thousand
men were taken prisoners, and about eight thousand were killed or wounded.
This victory was almost as signal as that of Blenheim; Bavaria and Cologne
were the fruits of the one, and all Brabant was gain∣ed by the other. The
French troops were dispirit∣ed, and the city of Paris overwhelmed with
con∣sternation. Lewis XIV, who, in the beginning of his reign, had long been
flattered with conquest, was now humbled to such a degree as might have
excited the compassion of his enemies; he intreated for peace, but in vain;
the allies carried all before them; and his very capital dreaded the approach
of the conquerors. What neither his power, his ar∣mies, nor his politics, could
effect, a party in England performed; and the dissention between the Whigs
and the Tories saved the dominions of France, that now seemed ready for
ruin.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>QUEEN Anne's councils had hitherto been governed by a Whig
ministry; they still pur∣sued the schemes of the late King; and, upon
re∣publican principles, strove to diffuse freedom through∣out 
<PB N="101" REF="104"/> Europe. In a government, where the reasoning of
individuals, retired from power, generally leads those who command, the
designs of the ministry must change, as the people happen to alter. The
Queen's personal virtues, her successes, her adulation from the throne,
contributed all to change the disposition of the nation; they now began to
defend hereditary succession, non-resistance, and divine right; they
were now become Tories, and were ready to con∣trovert the designs of a Whig
ministry, whenever a leader offered to conduct them to the charge.</P>
<P>These discontents were, in some measure, increas∣ed by a
meditated union between the two kingdoms of England and Scotland. The treaty,
for this pur∣pose, was chiefly managed by the ministry; and, al∣though it
was fraught with numberless benefits to either kingdom, yet it raised the
murmurs of both. The English expected nothing from the union of so poor a
nation, but a participation of their necessities; they thought it unjust,
that, while Seotland was granted an eighth part of the legislature, it yet
should be taxed but a fortieth part of the supplies. On the other hand, the
Scotch considered that their independency would be quite destroyed, and the
dignity of their crown betrayed; they dreaded an increase of taxes, and
seemed not much to esteem the ad∣vantages of an increased trade. In every
political measure there are disadvantages on either side, which may be
sufficient to deter the timid, but which a bold legislator disregards.
The union, after some strug∣gles, was effected; Scotland was no longer to
have a parliament, but to send sixteen Peers, chosen from the body of
their nobility, and forty-five commoners. The two kingdoms were called by the
common name of Great Britain; and all the subjects of both were to enjoy a
commun iation of privileges and ad∣vantages.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="105"/> This measure, which strengthened the
vigour of government, by uniting its force, seemed to threaten the enemies of
Great Britain with dangers abroad; but the discontents of the nation at home
prevented the effects of its newly-acquired power. The To∣ries, now become the
majority, were displeased with the Whig ministry; they looked with
jealousy on the power of the Earl of Godolphin and the Duke of Marlborough,
who had long governed the Queen, and lavished the treasures of the nation
on conquests more glorious than serviceable. To them the people imputed the
burthens under which they now groan∣ed, and others which they had reason to
fear. The loss of a battle near Almanza in Spain, where the English army
were taken prisoners, under the com∣mand of the Earl of Galloway, with some
other mis∣carriages, tended to heighten their displeasure, and
dispelled the inebriation of former success. The To∣ries did not fail to
inculcate and exaggerate these causes of discontent, while Robert Harley,
after∣wards Earl of Oxford, and Henry St. John, made soon after Lord
Bolingbroke, secretly fanned the flame.</P>
<P>Harley had lately become a favourite of the Queen; the petulance of
the Duchess of Marlbo∣rough, who formerly ruled the Queen, had entirely
alienated the affections of her mistress. She now placed them upon one Mrs.
Masham, who was en∣tirely devoted to Lord Oxford. Oxford was
pos∣sessed of uncommon erudition; he was polite and intriguing; he had
insinuated himself into the royal favour, and determined to sap the
credit of Marl∣borough and his adherents. In this attempt he chose, for his
second, Bolingbroke, a man of ex∣alted powers of thinking, eloquent,
ambitious, and enterprising. Bolingbroke was, at first, contented to act a
subordinate character in this meditated oppo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tion; but, soon perceiving the superiority of his 
<PB N="103" REF="106"/> own talents, from being an inferior, he was resolved
to become Lord Oxford's rival. The Duke of Marlborough soon perceived their
growing power, and resolved to crush it in the beginning. He re∣fused to
join in the Privy Council, while Harley was secretary. Godolphin joined his
influence in this measure; and the Queen was obliged to appease their
resentment, by discharging Harley from his place: Bolingbroke was
resolved to share his dis∣grace, and voluntarily relinquished his
employments.</P>
<P>This violent measure, which seemed, at first, fa∣vourable to
the Whig ministry, laid the first founda∣tion of its ruin; the Queen was
intirely displeased with the haughty conduct of the Duke; and, from that
moment, he lost her confidence and affection. Harley was enabled to act now
with less disguise, and to take more vigorous measures for the
completion of his designs. In him the Queen reposed all her trust, though
he now had no visible concern in the admi∣nistration.</P>
<P>The Whig party, in this manner, seemed to tri∣umph for some
time, till an occurrence, in itself, of no great importance, served to
shew the spirit of the times. Doctor Sacheverel, a minister of narrow
in∣tellects and bigotted principles, had published two sermons, in which he
strongly insisted on the illega∣lity of resisting Kings, and enforced
the divine ori∣gin of their authority; declaimed against the Dissen∣ters,
and exhorted the Church to put on the whole armour of God. There was nothing in
the sermons, either nervous, well written, or clear; they owed all their
celebrity to the complexion of the times, and are at present justly
forgotten. Sacheverel was im∣peached by the commons, at the bar of the upper
house; they seemed resolutely bent upon punishing him; and a day was
appointed for trying him before the Lords at Westminster-Hall. Mean while,
the Tories, who, one and all, approved his principles, <PB N="104" REF="107"/>
were as violent in his defence as the parliament had been in his prosecution.
The eyes of the kingdom were turned upon this extraordinary tryal; the Queen
herself was every day present as a private spectator. His tryal lasted
some days; and vast multitudes attended him each day, as he went to the
hall, shouting, and praying for his success. The body of the people
espoused his cause. They de∣stroyed several meeting-houses, and
plundered the dwellings of Dissenters; and the Queen herself could not
but relish those doctrines which contributed to extend her prerogative. The
Lords were divided; they continued undetermined for some time; but, at
length, after much obstinate dispute and viru∣lent altercation, Sacheverel
was found guilty by a majority of seventeen voices. He was prohibited from
preaching, for the term of three years: his two sermons were ordered to be
burnt by the hands of the common hangman. The lenity of this sentence was
considered, by the Tories, as a victo∣ry; and, in fact, their faction took
the lead all the remaining part of this reign.</P>
<P>The King of France, long persecuted by fortune, and each hour
fearing for his capital, once more pe∣titioned for peace. Godolphin and
Marlborough, who had, since the beginning of the war, enjoyed the double
advantage of extending their glory, and increasing their fortunes, were
intirely averse to any negotiation which tended to diminish both. The
Tories, on the other hand, willing to humble the general, and his partner
Godolphin, were sincerely desirous of a peace, as the only measure to
attain their ends. A conference was, at length, begun at Gertruydenberg, under
the influence of Marlborough, Eugene, and Zinzendorf, all three entirely
averse to the treaty. The French ministers were subjected to every
species of mortification; their conduct nar∣rowly watched; their master
insulted; and their let∣ters <PB N="105" REF="108"/> opened. They offered to
satisfy every com∣plaint that had given rise to the war; they consented
to abandon Philip IV, in Spain; to grant the Dutch a large barrier; they even
consented to grant a sup∣ply towards dethroning Philip; but even this offer
was treated with contempt, and at length the con∣ference was broken off, while
Lewis resolved to ha∣zard another campaign.</P>
<P>The designs of the Dutch, and the English gene∣ral, were too
obvious not to be seen, and properly explained by their enemies in England.
The writers of the Tory faction, who were men of the first rank of literary
merit, displayed the avarice of the Duke and the self-interested conduct
of the Dutch; they insisted, that, while England was exhausting her
strength in foreign conquests, she was losing her liberty at home; that
her ministers were not con∣tented with sharing the plunder of an
impoverishing state, but were resolved upon destroying its liberties
also. To these complaints were added the real pride of the then prevailing
ministry, and the insolence of the Duchess of Marlborough, who hitherto
had possessed more real power than the whole privy-coun∣cil united.
Mrs. Masham, who had first been re∣commended to the Queen's favour by the
Duchess, now fairly supplanted her patroness; and, by a steady
attention to please the Queen, had gained all that confidence which she had
reposed in her former confidante. It was too late that the Duchess
per∣ceived this alienation of the Queen's favour, and now began to think of
repairing it by demanding an audience of her Majesty, in order to vindicate
her character from every suspicion; but formal expla∣nations ever widen the
breach.</P>
<P>Mr. Hill, brother to the new favourite, was ap∣pointed by the Queen
to be colonel of a regiment; this the Duke of Marlborough could by no means
approve. He expostulated with his sovereign; he <PB N="106" REF="109"/>
retired in disgust; the Queen, by a letter, gave him
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eave to dispose of the
regiment as he should think proper; but, before it came to his hands, he had
sent a letter to the Queen, desiring she would permit him to retire from
his employments. This was the conjuncture which the Tories had long wished
for, and which the Queen herself was internally pleased with. She now
perceived herself set free from an arbitrary combination, by which she
had been long kept in dependance. The Earl of Godolphin, the Duke's
son-in-law, was divested of his office; and the treasury submitted to
Harley, the antagonist of his ambition. Lord Somers was dismissed from
be∣ing president of the council, and the Earl of Ro∣chester appointed in
his room. In a word, there was not one Whig left in any office of state,
except the Duke of Marlborough; he retained his employ∣ments for a short
time, unsupported and alone, an object of envy and factious reproach, till at
length be found his cause irretrievable, and was obliged, after trying
another campaign, to resign, as the rest of his party had done before.</P>
<P>As war seemed to have been the desire of the Whig party, so
peace seemed to have been that of the Tories. Through the course of
English histo∣ry, France seems to have been the peculiar object of the
hatred of the Whigs, and a continual war with that nation has been their aim.
On the contrary, the Tories have not regarded that nation, with such
opposition of principle; and a peace with France has generally been the
result of a Tory administration. For some time therefore, a negotiation
for peace had been carried on between the court of France and the new
ministers, who had a double aim in this mea∣sure; namely, to mortify the
Whigs and the Dutch, and to free their country from a ruinous war which had all
the appearance of becoming habitual to the constitution.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE conferences for peace were first opened at London; and some
time after the Queen sent the Earl of Strafford as ambassador into
Holland, to communicate the proposals which the French King had made towards
the re-establishment of the gene∣ral tranquility. The spirit of the times
was now changed; Marlborough's aversion to such measures could now no
longer retard the negotiation; Lord Strafford obliged the Dutch to name
plenipotentiaries, and to receive those of France. The treaty began at
Utrecht; but as all the powers concerned in this conference, except France and
England, were averse to every accommodation, their disputes served rather
to retard than accelerate a pacification. The English ministry, however,
had foreseen and provided against those difficulties. Their great end was
to free the subjects from a long unprofitable war, a war where conquest
could add nothing to their power, and a defeat might be prejudicial to internal
tranquility. As England had borne the chief burthen of the war, it was but
just to expect that it would take the lead in dictating the terms of peace.
There were, however, three persons of very great interest and power, who
la∣boured, by every art, to protract the negotiation; those were the Duke of
Marlborough, Prince Eugene, and Heinsius the Dutch grand pensionary. Prince
Eugene even came over to London, in order to re∣tard the progress of a peace,
which seemed to interrupt his career of glory; he found at court such a
recep∣tion as was due to his merits and fame; but, at the same time, such a
repulse as the proposals he made seemed to deserve.</P>
<P>This negotiation to London failing of effect, the allies practised
every artifice to intimidate the Queen, and blacken the character of her
ministers; to raise <PB N="108" REF="111"/> and continue a dangerous ferment
among the people, to obstruct her councils, and divulge her designs. Her
ministers were very sensible of their present dan∣gerous situation;
they perceived her health was daily impairing, and her successor
countenanced the oppo∣site faction. In case of her death, they had nothing
to expect but prosecution and ruin, for obeying her commands; their only way
therefore was to give up their present employments, or hasten the
conclu∣sion of a treaty, the utility of which would be the best argument
with the people in their favour. The peace therefore was hastened; and this
haste, in some measure, relaxed the ministers obstinacy, in
insisting upon such terms and advantages as they had a right to demand.
Seeing that nothing was to be expected from the concurrence of the allies, the
courts of Lon∣don and Versailles resolved to enter into a private treaty,
in which such terms might be agreed on as would enable both courts to
prescribe terms to the rest of the contending powers.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Duke of Marlborough having been deposed from
his office of general, the command of the English army in Flanders was given
to the Duke of Ormond; but, at the same time, private orders were given him
not to act with vigour against an enemy, which was upon the point of being
recon∣ciled by more mild methods of treatment. The al∣lies, thus deprived of
the assistance of the English, still continued their animosity, and
were resolved to continue the war separately; they had the utmost
confidence in Prince Eugene, their general; and, though lessened by the
defection of the British forces, they were still superior to those of
the enemy, which were commanded by Marshal Villars, a man who seemed to
possess all the great qualities, and all the soibles of his country, in
a supreme degree; valiant, generous, alert, lively, boastful, and
avaricious. The loss of the British forces was soon severely felt in
the <PB N="109" REF="112"/> allied army. Villars attacked a separate body of
their troops incamped at Denain, under the command of the Earl of Albemarle.
Their intrenchments were forced, and seventeen battalions either killed or
taken, the Earl himself, and all the surviving officers, being made
prisoners of war.</P>
<P>These successes of Marshal Villars served to hasten
the treaty of Utrecht. The British ministers at the congress,
responsible at once for their conduct to their Queen, their country, and
all Europe, neglected nothing that might have been serviceable either to the
allies, or that might conduce to the public safety. They first stipulated
that Philip V, who had been settled on the throne of Spain, should renounce
all right to the crown of France, the union of two such powerful kingdoms
being thought dangerous to the liberties of the rest of Europe. They
covenanted that the Duke of Berry, his brother, the presumptive heir to the
crown of France, after the death of the Dauphin, should also renounce his
right to the crown of Spain, in case he became King of France. The Duke of
Orleans was to make the same resignation. To oblige men thus to renounce
their rights might have been injustice; but, for every good acquired, some
inconvenience must be endured; these resigna∣tions, in some measure,
served to calm the world temptsted up by long war, and have since become
the basis of the law of nations, to which Europe professes present
submission.</P>
<P>By this treaty the Duke of Savoy had the island of Sicily, with
the title of King, with Fenestrelles, and other places on the continent;
which increase of his power seemed, in some measure, drawn from the
spoils of the French monarchy. The Dutch had that barrier granted them, which
they so long sought after; and, if the house of Bourbon seemed
stripped of some dominion, in order to enrich the Duke of Savoy, on the
other hand, the house of Austria was <PB N="110" REF="113"/> taxed to
supply the wants of the Hollanders, who were put in possession of the
strongest towns in Flanders. With regard to England, its glory and
interests were secured. They caused the fortifica∣tions of Dunkirk to be
demolished, and its port to be destroyed. Spain gave up all right to
Gibraltar and the island of Minorca. France resigned Hud∣son's-Bay,
Nova-Scotia, and Newfoundland; but they were left in possession of
Cape-Breton, and the liberty of drying their fish upon the shore. Among the
articles which were glorious to the English, it may be observed, that the
setting free those who had been confined in the French prisons for
professing the Protestant religion, was not the least. It was
stipulated, that the Emperor should possess the king∣dom of Naples,
the Duchy of Milan, and the Spa∣nish Netherlands; that the King of
Prussia should have Upper Gueldre; and a time was fixed for the Emperor's
acceding to these resolutions, for he had hitherto obstinately refused
to assist at the negotia∣tions. Thus it appears, that the English
ministry did justice to all the world; but their country re∣fused it to
them; they were branded with all the terms of infamy and reproach by the Whig
party, and accused of having given up the privileges and rights which England
had to expect. Each party reviled the other in turn; the kingdom was divided
into opposite factions, both so violent in their cause, that the truth,
which both pretended to espouse, was attained by neither; both were
virulent, and both wrong. These commotions, in some measure, served
still more to impair the Queen's health. One fit of sickness succeeded
another; nor did the consolation of her ministry serve to allay her
anxieties; for they now had fallen out among themselves, the council-chamber
being turned into a theatre for the most bitter altercations. Oxford
advised a reconciliation with the Whigs, whose resentment he now began to
<PB N="111" REF="114"/> fear, as the Queen's health appeared to be impaired.
Bolingbroke, on the other hand, affected to set the Whigs at defiance;
professed a warm zeal for the church, and mixed flattery with his other
assiduities. Bolingbroke prevailed; Lord Oxford, the treasurer, was
removed from his employment, and retired, me∣ditating schemes of revenge, or
new projects for fu∣ture re-establishment. His fall was so sudden, and
so unexpected, that no plan was established for sup∣plying the vacancy
occasioned by his disgrace. All was confusion at court; and the Queen had
no lon∣ger force to support the burthen; she sunk into a state of
insensibility, and thus found refuge from anxiety in lethargic slumber.
Every method was contrived to rouze her from this state, but in vain; her
physicians dispaired of her life. The privy-council assembled upon this
occasion; the Dukes of Somerset and Argyle, being informed of the
despe∣rate state in which she lay, entered that assembly without
being summoned; the members were sur∣prized at their appearance; but the
Duke of Shrews∣bury thanked them for their readiness to give their
assistance at such a critical juncture, and desired them to take
their places. They now took all the neces∣sary precautions for securing
the succession in the house of Hanover, sent orders to the Heralds at
Arms, and to a troop of life-guards to be in readi∣ness to mount, in order to
proclaim the Elector of Brunswick King of Great Britain.</P>
<P>On the thirtieth of July the Queen seemed some∣what relieved by
medicines, rose from her bed, and, about eight, walked a little; when,
casting her eyes on the clock that stood in her chamber, she continued to
gaze for some time. One of the ladies in wait∣ing asked her what she saw
there more than usual? to which the Queen only answered by turning her eyes
upon her with a dying look. She was soon af∣ter seized with a fit of the
apoplexy, from which, <PB N="112" REF="115"/> however, she was relieved by the
assistance of Doctor Mead. In this state of stupefaction she
continued all night; she gave some signs of life between twelve and one
next day, but expired the next morning, a little after seven o'clock, having
lived forty-nine years five months and six days; and having reigned more than
twelve years with honour, equity, and applause. This Princess was rather
amiable than great, rather pleasing than beautiful; neither her ca∣pacity nor
learning were remarkable. Like all those of her family, she seemed rather
fitted for the private duties of life than a public station; a pattern of
con∣jugal affection, a good mother, a warm friend, and an indulgent
mistress. During her reign none suf∣fered on the scaffold for
treason; so that after a long succession of faulty or cruel Kings,
she shines with particular lustre. In her ended the line of the
Stew∣arts; a family, the misfortunes and misconducts of which are not to be
paralleled in history; a family who, less than men themselves, seemed
to expect from their followers more than manhood in their de∣fence; a family
demanding rather our pity than as∣sistance, who never rewarded their
friends, nor aveng∣ed them of their enemies.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE nearer we approach to our own times, in this survey of
English history, the more im∣portant every occurrence becomes; our own
interests are blended with those of the state; and the accounts of public
welfare are but the transcript of private happiness. The two parties which
had long divided the kingdom, under the names of Whig and Tory, now seemed to
alter their titles; the Whigs being <PB N="113" REF="116"/> styled
Hanoverians, and the Tories branded with the appellation of Jacobites. The
former, desired to be governed by a King, who was a Protestant, though a
foreigner; the latter, by a Monarch of their own country, though a Papist. Of
two inconveniencies, however, that seemed the least, where religion
seemed to be in no danger; and the Hanoverians prevailed.</P>
<P>The Jacobites had been long flattered with the hopes of seeing the
succession altered by the Earl of Oxford; but by the premature death of
the Queen, all their expectations at once were blasted; the dili∣gence and
activity of the privy-council, in which the Hanoverian interest prevailed,
completed their confusion, and they now found themselves without any leader
to give consistency to their designs, and force to their councils. Upon
recollection they saw nothing so eligible as silence and
submission; they hoped much from the assistance of France, and
still more from the vigour of the pretender.</P>
<P>Pursuant to the act of succession. George I, son of
Ernest Augustus, first Elector of Brunswick, and Sophia, grand-daughter
to James I, ascended the British throne. His mature age, being now
fifty-four years old; his sagacity and experience, his nu∣merous alliances,
the general peace of Europe; all contributed to his support, and promised a
peaceable and happy reign. His virtues, though not shining, were solid; he
was of a very different disposition from the Stewart family, whom he
succeeded; they were known to a proverb for leaving their friends in
distress; George, on the contrary, soon after his ar∣rival in England,
used to say, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>My maxim is never to abandon my friends; to do
justice to all the world; and to fear no man.</HI></Q> To these
qualifications he joined great application to business; but generally
studied more the interests of those subjects he had left behind, than
of these he came to govern.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="117"/> The King first landed at Greenwich, where
he was received by the Duke of Northumberland, and the Lords of the regency.
From the landing-place he walked to his house in the Park, accompanied by a
great number of the nobility, and other per∣sons of distinction, who had
the honour to kiss his hand, as they approached. When he retired to his
bed-chamber, he sent for those of the nobility who had distinguished
themselves by their zeal for his succession; but the Duke of Ormond,
the Lord Chancellor, and Lord Trevor, were not of the num∣ber; Lord Oxford too,
the next morning, was re∣ceived with marks of disapprobation; and none but
the Whig party were admitted into any share of con∣fidence. The King of a
faction is but the sovereign of half his subjects; of this, however, the
Monarch I speak of did not seem sensible; it was his misfor∣tune, as
well as that of the nation, that he was hemmed round by men who soured him
with all their interests and prejudices; none now but the violent in faction
were admitted into employment; and the Whigs, while they pretended to secure
for him the crown, were, with all possible diligence, abridging the
prerogative. An instantaneous and to∣tal change was effected in all offices
of honour and advantage. The Whigs governed the senate, and the court
disposed of all places at pleasure; whom they would they oppressed;
bound the lower orders of people with new and severe laws; and this they
called liberty.</P>
<P>These partialities, and this oppression, soon raised
discontents throughout the kingdom. The clamour of the church's being in
danger was revived; jea∣lousies were received, and dangerous tumults raised
in every part of the country. The party cry was, Down with the Whigs;
Sacheveral for ever. Dur∣ing these commotions in the Pretender's favour, this
<PB N="115" REF="118"/> Prince himself continued only a calm spectator on
the continent, now and then sending over his emis∣saries to inflame the
disturbances, to disperse his in∣effectual manifestoes, and to delude
the unwary. Copies of a printed address were sent to the Dukes of
Shrewsbury, Marlborough, Argyle, and other noblemen of the first
distinction, vindicating the Pretender's right to the crown, and complaining
of the injustice that was done him by receiving a foreigner. Yet, for all
this, he still continued to profess the truest regard for the Catholic
religion; and, instead of concealing his sentiments on that head, gloried
in his principles. It was the being a Papist which had dispossessed
his father of the throne; and surely the son could never hope to gain a
crown by the very methods in which it was lost; but an infatuation seemed
for ever to attend all the family.</P>
<P>However odious, at that time, the Popish super∣stitions were
to the people in general, yet the opinions of the Dissenters seemed
still more displeasing. Re∣ligion was mingled with all political
disputes. The High-church party complained, that, under a Whig
administration, impiety and heresy daily gained ground; that the prelates
were at once negligent of religious concerns, and warm in pursuit of
tem∣poral blessings. A book written by Doctor Samuel Clarke, in favour of
Socinianism, was strictly re∣prehended; the disputes among the Churchmen
rose to such a height that the ministry was obliged to in∣terpose; and
the clergy received orders for finishing such-like debates, and from
intermeddling in affairs of state. Nothing, however, can be more impolitic in
a state, than to prohibit the clergy from disputing with each other; by
this means they become more animated in the cause of religion; and which ever
side they defend, they become wiser and better, as they carry on the
cause. To silence their disputes
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to lead them into negligence; if
religion be not <PB N="116" REF="119"/> kept up by opposition, it falls to the
ground, no longer becomes an object of public concern. Go∣vernment, I say
again, should never silence dispute, and should never side with
either disputant.</P>
<P>A new parliament was now called, in which the Whigs had by far the
majority; all prepossessed with the strongest aversion to the
Tories, and led on by the King himself, who made no secret of his
dis∣pleasure. Upon their first meeting he informed them, that the
branches of the revenue granted for the sup∣port of civil government, were
not sufficient for that purpose; he apprized them of the machinations of
the Pretender, and intimated that he expected their assistance in
punishing such as had endeavoured to deprive him of that blessing which
he most valued, the affection of his people. As the houses were then
disposed, this served to give them the alarm; and they out-went even the
most sanguine expectations of the most vindictive ministry.</P>
<P>Their resentment began with arraigning Lord Bo∣lingbroke of high
treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. To this it was objected by
one of the members of the house of commons, that nothing in the allegations
laid to his charge amounted to high treason. To this there was no reply
given; but, Lord Coningsby standing up, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>The chairman,</HI> said he, <HI>has impeached
the hand, but I impeach the head; he has impeached the scholar, and I the
master. I impeach Robert Earl of Oxford, and Earl Mortimer, of high treason
and other crimes and misdemeanors.</HI></Q> When there∣fore this nobleman
appeared the next day in the house of Lords, he was avoided, by his brother
Peers, as infectious; he, whose favour had been but a little before so
earnestly sought after, was now rejected and contemned. When the articles
were read against him in the house of Peers, some debates arose as to
the nature of his indictment, which, however, were carried by his
adversaries, and the articles of im∣peachment <PB N="117" REF="120"/> approved
by the house; he was therefore again impeached at the bar of the house of
Lords; and a motion was made that he might lose his seat, and be committed
to close custody. The Earl now seeing a furious spirit of faction
raised against him, and aiming at his head, was not wanting to himself,
upon this emergency, but spoke to the following purpose: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I am accused,</HI> says he, <HI>for having
made a peace; a peace, which, bad as it is now represented, has been approved
by two successive parliaments. For my own part, I always acted by the
immediate directions and commands of the Queen my mistress, and never
offended against any known law. I am justified in my own conscience, and
unconcerned for the life of an insignificant old man. But I cannot, without
the highest ingratitude, remain uncon∣cerned for the best of Queens;
obligation binds me to vin∣dicate her memory. My Lords, if ministers of
state, act∣ing by the immediate commands of their Sovereign, are afterwards
to be made accountable for their proceedings, it may, one day or other, be the
case of all the members of this august assembly. I do not doubt
therefore, that, out of regard to yourselves, your Lordships will give me
an equi∣table hearing; and I hope, that in the prosecution of this inquiry it
will appear, that I have merited, not only the indulgence, but also the
favour of this government. My Lords, I am now to take my leave of your
Lordships, and of this honourable house, perhaps, for ever! I shall lay
down my life with pleasure, in a cause favoured by my late dear royal
mistress. And, when I consider that I am to be judged by the justice,
honour, and virtue of my Peers, I shall acquiesce, and retire with great
content. And, my Lords, God's will be done.</HI></Q> On his return from the
house of Lords to his own house, where he was, for that night, permitted to
go, he was followed by a great multitude of people, crying out, High-church
Ormond and Oxford for ever. Next day he was brought to the bar, where he
received a copy of his articles, and was allowed a month to prepare his
an∣swer. <PB N="118" REF="121"/> Though Doctor Mead declared, that if the Earl
should be sent to the Tower, his life would be in danger, it was carried,
that he should be sent there, whither he was attended by a prodigious
con∣course of people, who did not scruple to exclaim against his
prosecutors. Tumults grew more fre∣quent; and this only served to
increase the severity of the legislature. An act was made, decreeing,
that if any persons, to the number of twelve, unlawfully assembled,
should continue together one hour, after being required to disperse by a
Justice of Peace, or other officer, and heard the proclamation against
riots read in public, they should be deemed guilty of fe∣lony, without
benefit of the clergy. An act of this kind carries its own comment with it;
legislators should ever be averse to enacting such laws as leave the
greatest room for abuse.</P>
<P>A committee was now appointed to draw up ar∣ticles of impeachment,
and prepare evidence against him and the other impeached Lords; he was
con∣fined in the Tower, and there remained for two years; during which time,
the kingdom was in a continual ferment, several other Lords, who had broke
out into actual rebellion, and were taken in arms, being executed for
treason; the ministry seemed weary of executions; and he, with his
usual fore∣sight, presented, upon this occasion, a petition for coming
to his tryal. A day was therefore assigned him. The commons appointed a
committee to en∣quire into the state of the Earl's impeachment, and demanded
a longer time to prepare for the tryal. The truth is, they had now began to
relax in their former asperity; and the intoxication of party was not quite
so strong now as when he had been first committed. At the appointed time
the Peers repair∣ed to the court in Westminster-Hall, where Lord Cowper
presided as Lord Steward. The commons were assembled; and the King and
royal family as∣sisted <PB N="119" REF="122"/> at the solemnity. The
prisoner was brought from the Tower, and his articles of impeachment read,
with his answers and the replies of the com∣mons. Sir Joseph Jekyl, one of
the agents for the commons, standing up to enforce the first article of his
Lordship's accusation, one of the Lords adjourn∣ing the house,
observed, that much time would be consumed in going through all the
articles of the im∣peachment; that nothing more remained than for the commons
to make good the two articles of high treason contained in his charge; and
that this would at once determine the tryal. His advice was agreed to by the
Lords; but the commons delivered a paper containing their reasons for
asserting it as their un∣doubted right to carry on the impeachment in the
manner they thought most conducive to their aim. On the other hand, the
house of Lords insisted on their former resolution, considering it as
the privi∣lege of every judge to hear each cause in the man∣ner he thinks
most fitting. The dispute grew still more violent; a message was at
length sent to the commons, intimating that the Lords intended to pro∣ceed
immediately to the Earl of Oxford's tryal; and, soon after repairing to the
Hall of Justice, they took their places. The commons, however, did not think
fit to appear; and the Earl, having waited a quarter of an hour at the bar, was
dismissed for want of ac∣cusers. To this dispute, perhaps, he owed
his safe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, though it is
probable they would have acquitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im of high treason, as none of his actions could
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustly suffer such an
imputation. With the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crimony prosecutions were carried on against Lord Bolingbroke
and the Duke of Ormond; but they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound safety in flight.</P>
<P>Such vindictive proceedings as these naturally ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ted indignation; the people groaned to
behold a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew great ones close up
all the avenues to royal fa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our,
and rule the nation with rigour and partiality. <PB N="120" REF="123"/> In
Scotland the discontent broke forth, at length, into the flames of rebellion.
The Earl of Mar, as∣sembling three hundred of his own vassals, in the
Highlands of Scotland, proclaimed the Pretender at Castletown, and set up
his standard at Brae Mar, on the sixth day of September, then assuming
the title of Lieutenant-general of the Pretender's forces; he ex∣horted the
people to take arms in defence of their lawful Sovereign. But these
preparations were weak and ill-conducted; all the designs of the rebels
be∣trayed to the government, the beginning of every re∣volt repressed, the
western counties prevented from rising, and the most prudent precautions
taken to keep all suspected persons in custody, or in awe. The Earl of
Derwentwater, and Mr. Foster, took the field near the borders of Scotland;
and, being joined by some gentlemen, proclaimed the Pretender. Their first
attempt was to seize upon Newcastle, in which they had many friends; but
they found the gates shut upon them, and were obliged to retire to Hexam;
while General Carpenter, having assembled a body of dragoons, resolved to
attack them before their numbers were increased. The rebels had two methods
of acting with success; either marching immediately into the western
parts of Scotland, and there joining General Gordon, who commanded a strong
body of Highlanders; or of crossing the Tweed, and attacking General
Carpenter, whose forces did not exceed nine hundred men. From their usual
infa∣tuation neither of these schemes were put into exe∣cution; for, taking
the route another way, they left General Carpenter on one side, and
resolved to pe∣netrate into England by the western border. They accordingly
advanced without either foresight or de∣sign, as far as Preston, where
they first heard the news that General Wills was marching at the head of
six regiments of horse, and a battalion of foot, to attack them. They now
therefore began to raise <PB N="121" REF="124"/> barricadoes, and to put the
place in a posture of de∣fence, repulsing at first the attack of the
King's army with some success. Next day, however, General Wills was
reinforced by the troops under Carpenter, and the rebels were invested on all
sides. Foster, their General, sent Colonel Oxburgh with a trum∣pet to the
English commander, to propose a capitu∣lation. This, however, General Wills
refused, al∣ledging that he would not treat with rebels; and that all they
could expect was, to be spared from imme∣diate slaughter. These were hard
terms; but they were then obliged to submit. They accordingly laid down their
arms, and were put under a strong guard. The leaders were secured, and led
through London pinioned, and bound together, while the common men were confined
at Chester and Liverpool.</P>
<P>While these unhappy circumstances attended the rebels in
England, the Earl of Mar's forces, in the mean time, increased to the number
of ten thousand men, and he had made himself master of the whole county
of Fife. Against him the Duke of Argyle set out for Scotland, as commander
in chief of the forces in North Britain; and, assembling some troops in
Lothian, returned to Stirling with all possible ex∣pedition. The Earl of
Mar, being informed of this, at first retreated; but being joined soon
after by some Clans under the Earl of Seaforth, and others by General Gordon,
who had signalized himself in the Russian service, he resolved to
march forward to∣wards England. The Duke of Argyle, apprized of his intention,
and being joined by some regiments of dragoons from Ireland, determined to
give him battle in the neighbourhood of Dumblain, though his forces were by no
means so numerous as those of the rebel army. In the morning therefore of
the same day on which the Preston rebels had surrendered, he drew up his
forces, which did not exceed three thousand five hundred men, but found
himself greatly out∣flanked <PB N="122" REF="125"/> by the enemy. The Duke
therefore perceiv∣ing the enemy making attempts to surround him, was obliged
to alter his disposition; which, on account of the scarcity of general
officers, was not done so expeditiously as to be all formed before the
rebels be∣gun the attack. The left wing therefore of the Duke's army fell in
with the center of the enemy's, and supported the first charge without
shrinking. This wing even seemed, for a short time, victorious, as they
killed the chief leader of part of the rebel army. But Glengary, who was
second in command, undertook to inspire his intimidated forces; and, waving
his bonnet, cried out several times, Revenge. This animated his men to such
a degree, that they followed him close to the muzzles of the muskets,
pushed aside the bayonets with their targets, and with their broad-swords
did great execution. A total route of that wing of the royal army ensued, and
General Witham, their commander, flying full speed to Stir∣ling, gave out,
that all was lost. In the mean time the Duke of Argyle, who commanded in
person on the right, attacked the left of the enemy, and drove them before
him for two miles, though they often faced about, and attempted to rally. The
Duke having thus entirely broke their left, and pushed them over the river
Allen, returned to the field, where they found that part of the rebel army
which had been victorious; but, instead of renewing the engage∣ment, both
armies continued to gaze at each other, neither caring to engage; till towards
evening both sides drew off, each boasting of victory. Which ever might
claim the triumph, it must be owned, that all the honour, and all the
advantages of the day, belonged only to the Duke of Argyle. It was sufficient
for him to have interrupted the enemies progress; and delay was to them a
defeat. The Earl of Mar therefore soon found his disappoint∣ments, and
losses increase. The castle of Inverness, <PB N="123" REF="126"/> of
which he was in possession, was delivered up to the King by Lord Lovat,
who had hitherto appeared in the interest of the Pretender. The Marquis of
Tullibardine left the Earl to defend his own coun∣try; and many of the Clans
seeing no likelihood of coming soon to a second engagement, returned
home. An irregular army being much easier led to battle, than induced to bear
the fatigues of a campaign.</P>
<P>The pretender might now be convinced of the va∣nity of his
expectations, in imagining that the whole country would rise up in his
cause; his affairs now were actually desperate; yet, with the usual
infatu∣ation of the family, he resolved to hazard his person among his
friends in Scotland, at a time when such a measure was totally useless.
Passing therefore through France in disguise, and embarking in a
small vessel at Dunkirk, he arrived, on the twenty-second day of
December, on the coasts of Scotland, with only six gentlemen in his
retinue. Upon his arrival in Aberdeen, he was solemnly proclaimed, and soon
after made his public entry into Dundee; and, in two days more, came to Scoon,
where he intended to have the ceremony of his coronation performed. He ordered
thanksgivings for his safe arrival, injoined the ministers to pray for
him in the churches; and, without the smallest share of power, went
through all the ceremonies of royalty, which were, at such a juncture,
perfectly ridiculous. After this unimpor∣tant parade, he resolved to abandon
the enterprize with the same levity with which it had been undertaken, and
embarked again for France, together with the Earl of Mar, and some others, in
a small ship that lay in the harbour of Montross; and, in five days,
arrived at Gravelin. General Gordon, who was left com∣mander in chief of the
forces, with the assistance of the Earl-marshal, proceeded with them to
Aberdeen, where he secured three vessels to sail northward, which took
on board the persons who intended to <PB N="124" REF="127"/> make their
escape to the continent. In this manner the rebellion was suppressed;
but the fury of the victors did not seem in the least to abate with
suc∣cess. The law was now put in force, with all its terrors; and the
prisons of London were crowded with those deluded wretches whom the
ministry shew∣ed no disposition to spare. The commons, in their
address to the crown, declared they would prosecute in the most vigorous
manner the authors of the re∣bellion; and their resolutions were as speedy
as their measures were vindictive. The Earls Der∣wentwater, Nithsdale,
Carnwath, and Wintown; the Lords Widrington, Kenmuir, and Nairn, were
impeached. The <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> act was suspended; and the rebel
Lords, upon pleading guilty, received sentence of death. Nothing could
soften the Privy Council; the house of Lords even presented an ad∣dress
to the throne for mercy, but without effect. Orders were dispatched for
executing the Earls of Derwentwater and Nithsdale, and the viscount
Ken∣muir, immediately; the others were respited for three weeks longer.
Nithsdale, however, escaped in wo∣man's cloaths, which were brought him by
his mo∣ther, the night before his intended execution. Der∣wentwater and Kenmuir
were brought to the scaf∣fold on Tower-hill, at the hour appointed. Both
underwent their sentence with calmness and intrepi∣dity, pitied by all,
seemingly less moved themselves than the spectators.</P>
<P>An act of parliament was also made for trying the private
prisoners in London, and not in Lancashire, where they were taken in arms;
which proceeding was, in some measure, an alteration of the ancient
constitution of the kingdom; when Foster, Mackin∣tosh, and several
others were found guilty. Foster, however, escaped from Newgate, and
reached the continent in safety; and some time after also Mack∣intosh,
with some others, forced their way, having <PB N="125" REF="128"/> mastered
the keeper and turnkey, and disarmed the centinel. Four or five were hanged,
drawn, and quartered; among whom was William Paul, a cler∣gyman, who
professed himself a true and sincere member of the Church of England;
but not of that schismatical church whose Bishops had abandoned their
King. Such was the end of a rebellion, pro∣bably first inspired by the
rigour of the new Whig ministry and parliament. In running through the
vicissitudes of human transactions, we too often find both sides
culpable; and so it was in this case. The royal party acted under the
influences of partiality, rigour, and prejudice, gratified private animosity
under the mask of public justice; and, in their pretended love of
justice, forgot humanity. On the other hand, the pretender's party aimed not
only at subverting the government, but the religion of the kingdom; bred a
Papist himself, he confided only in counsellors of his own
persuasion; and most of those who ad∣hered to his cause were men of
indifferent morals, or bigotted principles. Clemency, however, in the
government, at that time, would probably have ex∣tinguished all the factious
spirit which has hitherto disturbed the peace of this country; for it has
ever been the character of the English, that they are more easily led than
driven to loyalty.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>IN a government, so very complicated as that of England, it must
necessarily change from itself, in a revolution of even a few years, as
some of its weaker branches acquire strength, or its stronger de∣cline.
At this period, the rich and noble seemed to possess a greater share
of power than they had done for some ages preceding; the house of commons
be∣came <PB N="126" REF="129"/> each day a stronger body, at once more
inde∣pendent on the crown and the people. It was now seen that the rich could
at any time buy their elec∣tion; and that while their laws governed the poor,
they might be enabled to govern the law. The re∣bellion was now extinguished;
and the severities which justice had inflicted, excited the discontent of
many, whose humane passions were awakened as their fears began to
subside. This served as a pre∣text for continuing the parliament, and
repealing the act by which they were to be dissolved at the expiration of
every third year. An act of this na∣ture, by which a parliament thus extended
their own power, was thought, by many, the ready means of undermining the
constitution; for if they could with impunity extend their continuance for
seven years, which was the time proposed, they could also for life
continue their power; but this, it was observed, was utterly incompatible
with the spirit of legisla∣tion. The bill, however, passed both
houses; all objections to it were considered as disaffection; and, in a
short time, it received the royal sanction. The people might murmur at this
encroachment; but it was now too late for redress.</P>
<P>Domestic concerns being thus adjusted, the King began to turn
his thoughts to his Hanoverian dominions, and determined upon a voyage to the
continent. Nor was he without his fears for his dominions there, as Charles
XII, of Sweden, pro∣fessed the highest displeasure at his having
entered into a confederacy against him in his absence. Having therefore
passed through Holland to Han∣over, in order to secure his German
territories, he entered into a treaty with the Dutch and the Regent of France,
by which they promised mutually to assist each other, in case of
invasion; but the death of the Swedish Monarch, who was killed by a
cannon∣ball at the siege of Frederickstadt, soon put an 
<PB N="127" REF="130"/> end to his disquietudes from that quarter. However,
his Majesty, to secure himself as far as alliances could add to his
safety, entered into various negotiations with the different powers of
Europe; some were brought to accede by money, others by promises. Treaties
of this kind seldom give any real security; they may be considered as
mere political playthings; they amuse for a while, and then are thrown
neglect∣ed by, never more to be heard of, as nothing but its own internal
strength or situation can guard a coun∣try from insult.</P>
<P>Among other treaties concluded with such inten∣tions, was that
called the <HI>Quadruple Alliance.</HI> It was agreed upon between the Emperor,
France, England, and Holland, that the Emperor should renounce all
pretensions to the crown of Spain, and exchange Sardinia for Sicily with the
Duke of Savoy. That the succession to the Duchies of Tuscany, Parma,
and Placentia, should be settled on the Queen of Spain's eldest son, in
case the present possessors should die without male issue.
This treaty was by no means favourable to the interests of England, as it
inter∣rupted the commerce with Spain; and, as it de∣stroyed the balance of
power in Italy, by throw∣ing too much into the hands of Austria. How∣ever,
England sitted out a strong squadron in or∣der to bring Spain to terms,
if that kingdom should insist upon its rights in Italy. The war between
the Emperor and King of Spain was actually begun in that country; and the
mediation of the King of England was rejected, as partial and unjust. It was
therefore resolved by the court of London to sup∣port its negotiations with
the strongest reasons; namely, those of war. Sir George Byng sailed
to Naples with twenty-two ships of the line, where he was received as a
deliverer, that city having been under the utmost terrors of an invasion
from Spain. <PB N="128" REF="131"/> Here the English admiral received
intelligence, that the Spanish army, amounting to thirty thousand men, had
landed in Sicily; wherefore he immediately de∣termined to sail thither, fully
resolved to pursue the Spanish fleet. Upon doubling Cape Faro, he
per∣ceived two small Spanish vessels, and pursuing them closely
they led him to their main fleet, which, be∣fore noon, he perceived in line of
battle, amounting, in all, to twenty-seven sail. At sight of the
English fleet, the Spanish fleet, though superior in numbers, attempted
to sail away, as the English had, for some time, acquired such
expertness in naval affairs, that no other nation would venture to face them,
ex∣cept with manifest advantage on their side. The Spaniards seemed
distracted in their councils, and acted with extreme confusion; they made a
running fight; but notwithstanding what they could do, all but three were
taken. The admiral, during this en∣gagement, acted with equal prudence and
resolution; and the King wrote him a letter with his own hand, approving his
conduct. This victory necessarily pro∣duced the resentment and complaints
of the Spanish ministers at all the courts of Europe, which induced England
to declare war with Spain; and the Regent of France joined England in a
similar declaration. The Duke of Ormond now, once more, hoped, by the
assistance of Cardinal Alberoni, the Spanish mini∣ster, to restore
the pretender in England. He accord∣ingly set sail with some troops, and
proceeded as far as Cape Finisterre, where his fleet was dispersed, and
disabled by a violent storm, which entirely frustrated the armament; and,
from this time, the pretender seemed to lose all hopes of being received in
Eng∣land. This blow of fortune, together with the bad success of the
Spanish arms in Sicily and elsewhere, once more induced them to wish for
peace; and the King of Spain was at last contented to sign the qua∣druple
alliance.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="132"/> King George having thus, with equal vigour
and deliberation, surmounted all the obstacles he met with in his way to
the throne, and used every precaution that sagacity could suggest, for
securing himself in it, again returned to England, where the addresses
from both houses were as loyal as he could expect. From addressing they
turned to an object of the greatest im∣portance; namely, that of securing
the dependency of the Irish parliament upon that of Great Britain. Maurice
Annesly had appealed to the house of Peers in England, from a decree of the
house of Peers in Ireland; which was reversed. The British Peers ordered
the Barons of the Exchequer in Ireland, to put Mr. Annesly in
possession of the lands he had lost by the decree in that kingdom.
The Barons obeyed this order, and the Irish house of Peers passed a
vote against them, as having attempted to diminish the just privileges of
the parliament of Ireland; and, at the same time, ordered the Barons to be
taken under the custody of the Black Rod. On the other hand, the house of
Lords in England resolved, that the Barons of the Exchequer in Ireland had
acted with courage and fidelity; and addressed the King to signify his
approbation of their conduct, by some marks of his favour. To complete their
intention, a bill was prepared, by which the Irish house of Lords was
deprived of all rights of final jurisdiction. This was opposed in both
houses. In the lower house Mr. Pitt asserted, that it would only
increase the power of the English Peers, who already had too much. Mr.
Hungerford demonstrated that the Irish Lords had always exerted their power
of finally deciding causes. The Duke of Leeds produced fifteen reasons
against the bill; but, notwithstanding all opposition, it was carried by
a great majority, and received the royal assent. The kingdom of Ireland was
not, at that time, so well acquainted with the nature of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iberty, and its own
constitution, as it is at present. <PB N="130" REF="133"/> Their house of
Lords might then consist mostly of men bred up in luxury and ignorance;
neither spi∣rited enough to make opposition, nor skilful enough to
conduct it.</P>
<P>But this blow, which the Irish felt severely, was not so great
as that which England now began to suffer from that spirit of avarice and
chicanery which had infected almost all ranks of people. In the year 1720,
John Law, a Scotchman, had erected a com∣pany in France under the name of the
Missisippi; which, at first, promised the deluded people immense
wealth, but too soon appeared an imposture, and left the greatest part of
that nation in ruin and distress. The year following the people of England
were de∣ceived by just such another project, which is remem∣bered by all by
the name of the South-Sea scheme; and, to this day, felt by thousands. To
explain this as concisely as possible, it is to be observed, that ever
since the revolution, the government, not hav∣ing sufficient supplies
granted by parliament; or, what was granted requiring time to be collected,
they were obliged to borrow money from several different companies of
merchants; and, among the rest, from that company which traded to the
South-Sea. In the year 1716, they were indebted to this company about nine
millions and an half of money, for which they granted annually at the rate of
six <HI>per cent.</HI> in∣terest. As this company was not the only one, to
which the government was debtor, and paid such large interest yearly, Sir
Robert Walpole conceived a design of lessening these national debts, by
giving the several companies an alternative, either of ac∣cepting a lower
interest; namely, five <HI>per cent.</HI> for their money, or of being paid
the principal. The different companies chose rather to accept of the
diminished interest than their capital; and the South-Sea company
accordingly having made up their debt to the government ten millions, instead
of six hun∣dred thousand pounds which they usually received 
<PB N="131" REF="134"/> as interest, were satisfied with five hundred
thou∣sand. In the same manner the governors and com∣pany of the Bank, and
other companies, were con∣tented to receive a diminished annuity for their
se∣veral loans, all which greatly lessened the debts of the nation. It
was in this situation of things that Sir John Blount, who had been bred a
scrivener, and was possessed of all the cunning and plausibility
re∣quisite for such an undertaking, proposed to the mi∣nistry, in the
name of the South-Sea company, to lessen the national debt still further,
by permitting the South-Sea company to buy up all the debts of the different
companies, and thus to become the principal creditor of the state. The terms
offered the govern∣ment were extremely advantageous. The South-Sea company was
to redeem the debts of the nation out of the hands of the private proprietors,
who were creditors to the government, upon whatever terms they could agree on;
and, for the interest of this money, which they had thus redeemed, and taken
into their own hands, they should be allowed for six years five <HI>per
cent.</HI> and then the interest should be reduced to four <HI>per
cent.</HI> and be redeemable by par∣liament. For these purposes a bill
passed both houses; and as the directors of the South-Sea company could
not of themselves alone be supposed to be possessed of money
sufficient to buy up these debts of the go∣vernment, they were impowered to
raise it by open∣ing a subscription, and granting annuities to such
proprietors as should think proper to exchange their creditors; namely, the
Crown for the South-Sea company, with the advantages that might be made by
their industry. The superior advantages with which the proprietors were
flattered, by thus ex∣changing their property in the funds for South-Sea
stock were a chimerical prospect of having their money
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urned to great advantage, by a
commerce to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outhern parts of
America, where it was reported, <PB N="132" REF="135"/> that the English were
to have some new settlements granted them by the King of Spain. The
directors books therefore were no sooner opened for the first
subscription, but crowds came to make the exchange; the delusion
spread; subscriptions in a few days sold for double the price they had
been bought for. The scheme succeeded, and the whole nation was infected
with a spirit of avaricious enterprize. The infatu∣ation prevailed; the
stock increased to a surprising degree; but after a few months, the
people awak∣ed from their delirium; they sound that all the advantages to be
expected were merely imaginary; and an infinite number of families were
involved in ruin. Many of the directors whose arts had raised these vain
expectations, had amassed surprising for∣tunes: it was, however, one
consolation to the na∣tion, to find the parliament stripping them of their
ill-acquired wealth; and orders were given to re∣move all directors of the
South Sea company from their seats in the house of commons, or the places
they possessed under the government. The delin∣quents being punished
by a forfeiture of their estates, the parliament next converted its at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ention toward redressing the
sufferers. Several useful and just re∣solutions were taken, and a bill
was speedily prepared towards repairing the mischiefs. Of the profits
ari∣sing from the South-Sea scheme, the sum of seven millions was
granted to the ancient proprietors; se∣veral additions also were made to
their dividends out of what was possessed by the company in their own
right, the remaining capital stock also was divided among all the
proprietors at the rate of thirty-three pounds <HI>per cent.</HI> In the mean
time petitions from all parts of the kingdom were presented to the house,
demanding justice; and the whole nation seemed ex∣asperated to the
highest degree. During these trans∣actions, the King, with serenity and
wisdom presided at the helm, influenced his parliament to pursue
equitable <PB N="133" REF="136"/> measures, and, by his councils, endeavoured
to re∣store the credit of the nation.</P>
<P>The discontents occasioned by these public cala∣mities, once
more gave the disaffected party hopes of rising. But, in all their councils
they were weak, divided, and wavering. Their present designs there∣fore
could not escape the vigilance of the King, who had emissaries in every
court, and who had made, by his alliances, every potentate a friend to his
cause. He was therefore informed, by the Duke of Orleans, Regent of France,
of a new conspiracy raised against him by several persons of
distinction, which post∣poned his intended journey to Hanover. Among
those against whom the most positive evidence was obtained, was Mr.
Christopher Layer, a young gen∣tleman of the Middle Temple. He was convicted
of having inlisted men for the pretender's service, and received sentence
of death; which he under∣went, after having been often examined, and having
strenuously refused, to the last, to discover his accom∣plices. He
was the only person who suffered death upon this occasion; but several
noblemen of high distinction were made prisoners upon suspicion. The
Duke of Norfolk, the Bishop of Rochester, the Lord Orrery, and the Lord
North and Grey were of this number. Of these all but the Bishop of
Rochester c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me off without
punishment, the circumstances not being sufficient against them for
conviction. A bill was brought into the house of commons against him,
although a Peer; and though it met with some op∣position, yet it was
resolved by a great majority, that he should be deprived of his office and
benefice, and banished the kingdom for ever. The Bishop made no defence in
the lower house, reserving all his power to be exerted in the house of
Lords. In that assembly he had many friends; his eloquence, po∣liteness,
and ingenuity had procured him many; and his cause being heard, a long and
warm debate was <PB N="134" REF="137"/> the consequence. As there was little
against him but intercepted letters, which were written in cypher, the Earl
Pawlet insisted on the danger and injustice of departing, in such
cases, from the fixed rules of evidence. The Duke of Wharton having summed
up the depositions, and shewn the insufficiency of them, concluded with
saying, That let the conse∣quences be what they would, he hoped the
lustre of that house would be never tarnished, by condemning a man
without evidence. The Lord Bathurst spoke also against the bill,
observing, That if such extra∣ordinary proceedings were countenanced, he
saw no∣thing remaining for him and others to do, but to re∣tire to their
country-houses, and there, if possible, quietly enjoy their estates
within their own families, since the least correspondence, or intercepted
letter, might be made criminal. Then turning to the Bi∣shops, he said he
could hardly account for the inve∣terate hatred and malice some persons
bore the in∣genious Bishop of Rochester, unless it was, that they were
infatuated like the wild Americans, who sond∣ly believe they inherit, not
only the spoils, but even the abilities of any man they kill. The Earl of
Strafford spoke on the same side; as also Lord Tre∣vor, who observed,
That if men were, in this un∣precedented manner, proceeded against, without
le∣gal proof, in a short time the minister's favour would be the
subject's only protection; but that for him∣self, no apprehension of what
he might suffer, would deter him from doing his duty. He was answered by
Lord Seafield, who endeavoured to shew, that the evidence which had been
produced before them was sufficient to convince any reasonable man; and, in
this, he was supported by the Duke of Argyle and Lord Lechmere. To these
Lord Cowper replied, That the strongest argument urged in behalf of the
bill, was necessity; but, for his part, he could see nothing that could
justify such unprecedented, and <PB N="135" REF="138"/> such dangerous
proceedings. The other party, how∣ever, said little in answer; perhaps
already sensible of a majority in their favour. The bill was passed
against the Bishops, and several Lords entered their protest. Among the
members of the house of com∣mons, who had exerted themselves most
strenuously in the Bishop's favour, was Doctor Friend, the cele∣brated
physician; and he was now taken into cus∣tody on suspicion of
treasonable practices. He was soon after, however, admitted to bail; his
friend Doctor Mead becoming his security. In two days after the Bishop of
Rochester embarked for banish∣ment, accompanied with his daughter; and, on
the same day that he landed at Calais, the famous Lord Bolingbroke arrived
there, in his return to England, having obtained his Majesty's pardon. Upon
which the Bishop, smiling, said, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>His Lordship and I are ex∣changed.</HI></Q> In
this manner the Bishop continued in ex∣ile and poverty till he died; though
it may not be improper to observe, that Doctor Sacheverel left him, by will,
five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Few transactions of importance happened during the remainder of
this reign; the ministry were em∣ployed in making various and expensive
negotiations, alliances, and treaties; covenants that are made with∣out faith,
and only observed from motives of interest or fear. The parliament made
also some efforts to cheek the progress of vice and immorality, which now
began to be diffused through every rank of life; luxury and profligacy had
increased to a surprising degrce; nor were there any transactions to
fill the page of history, except the mercenary schemes of vile projectors,
or the tasteless profusion of new-made opulence. The treaties lately
concluded with Spain were again broken, perhaps by every party; admiral
Hosier was sent to intercept the Spanish galleons from America; of which
the Spaniards being ap∣prized, remanded back their treasure; and the
great∣est <PB N="136" REF="139"/> part of the English fleet, sent on this
errand, was rendered, by the worms, entirely unfit for service; and the men
were cut off by the unhealthy climate and long voyage. To retaliate this, the
Spaniards undertook the siege of Gibraltar, and with similar success.
New treaties were set on foot; France of∣fered its mediation; and such a
reconciliation as treaties could procure was the consequence.</P>
<P>The King had not now, for two years, visited his German dominions;
and therefore soon after the breaking up of parliament he prepared for a
journey to Hanover. Accordingly, having appointed an ad∣ministration in his
absence, he embarked for Hol∣land; lay, upon his landing, at the little town
of Vert; next day proceeded on his journey; and, in two days more, between ten
and eleven at night, ar∣rived at Delden, in all appearance in perfect health.
He supped there very heartily, and eat an orange; and continued his
progress early the next morning. Between eight and nine he ordered the coach
to stop, and, it being perceived that one of his hands lay motionless,
monsieur Fabrice, who had formerly been the servant of the King of Sweden,
and now at∣tended King George, chafed it between his. As this had no effect,
the surgeon was called, who fol∣lowed on horseback, and also rubbed it
with spi∣rits; soon after the King's tongue began to swell, and he had
just force enough to bid them hasten to Osnaburgh; and, falling into
Fabrice's arms, quite insensible, never recovered, but expired about eleven
o'clock the next morning. He died on Sunday the eleventh of June, in the
sixty-eighth year of his age, and in the thirteenth of his reign. Whatever
was good or great in the reign of George I, ought to be attributed wholly to
himself; and whenever he deviated, it might justly be imputed to a
ministry al∣ways partial, and often corrupt. He was almost ever
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nded with good fortune, which was
partly owing <PB N="137" REF="140"/> to prudence, and more to assiduity. In
short, his successes are the strongest instance of how much may
be atchieved by moderate abilities, exerted with ap∣plication and
uniformity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>I Have not hitherto said any thing of the literature of the
present period, having resolved to refer it to a separate letter, in
which we may have a more perspicu∣ous view of it, than if blended with the
ordinary oc∣currences of the state. Though learning had never received fewer
encouragements than in the present reign, yet it never flourished more.
That spirit of philosophy which had been excited in former ages, still
continued to operate with the greatest success, and produced the
greatest men in every profession. Among the divines, Atterbury and Clarke
distinguished themselves. As a preacher, Atterbury united all the graces
of style with all the elegance of a just deli∣very; he was natural, polite,
spirited; and his ser∣mons may be ranked among the first of this period.
Clarke, on the other hand, despising the graces of eloquence, only sought
after conviction, with rigorous though phlegmatic exactness, and brought
moral truths almost to mathematical precision. Yet nei∣ther he, Cudworth,
nor any other divine, did such service to the reasoning world, as the
great Mr. John Locke, who may be justly said to have reformed all our modes
of thinking in metaphysical inquiry. Though the jargon of schools had been
before him arraigned, yet several of their errors had still
subsist∣ed, and were regarded as true. Locke therefore set
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imself to overturn their
systems, and refute their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bsurdities; these he effectually accomplished; for
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich reason his book, which,
when published, was <PB N="138" REF="141"/> of infinite service; it may be
found less useful at pre∣sent, when the doctrines it was calculated to
refute, are no longer subsisting.</P>
<P>Among the moral writers of this period, the Earl of Shaftesbury is
not to be passed over, whose ele∣gance, in some measure,
recompenses for his want of solidity. The opinions of all latter writers
upon moral subjects, are only derived from the ancients<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Morals are a subject on which the industry of men
has been exercised in every age; and an infinite num∣ber of systems have
been the result. That of Shaftes∣bury, in which he establishes a
natural sense of mo¦ral beauty, was originally professed by Plato, and
only adorned by the English philosopher. Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seemed to be the age of speculation. Berkeley,
af¦terwards Bishop of Cloyne in Ireland, surpassed al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his cotemporaries in subtlety of
disquisition; but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mere
efforts of reason, which are exerted rather t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> raise doubt than procure certainty, will never mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with much favour from so vain a being
as man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord Bolingbroke had also
some reputation for me¦taphysical inquiry; his friends extolled his
sagacity on that head; and the public were willing enough t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> acquiesce in their opinion; his fame
therefore migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have continued to
rise; or, at least, would have ne¦ver sunk, if he had never published.
His work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have appeared, and the
public are no longer in thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
former sentiments. In mathematics and natural phi¦losophy, the vein opened
by Newton, was prosecute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with
success; Doctor Halley illustrated the theory
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the tides, and increased the
catalogue of the stars<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> while
Gregory reduced astronomy to one compre¦hensive and regular system.
Doctor Friend, in me¦dicine, produced some ingenious theories, which,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> they did not improve the art, at
least shewed his abi¦lities and learning in his profession. Doctor
Mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was equally elegant, and more
successful; to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> owing the
useful improvement of tapping in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <PB N="139" REF="142"/> dropsy, at once by means of a swathe.
But, of all the other arts, poetry in this age was carried to the greatest
perfection. The language, for some ages, had been improving, but now it
seemed entirely di∣vested of its roughness and barbarity. Among the poets
of this period we may place John Philips, au∣thor of several poems, but of
none more admired than that humourous one, intitled, <HI>The splendid
Shil∣ling;</HI> he lived in obscurity, and died just above want. William
Congreve deserves also particular notice; his comedies, some of which
were but cooly received upon their first appearance, seemed to mend upon
re∣petition; and he is, at present, justly allowed the foremost in that
species of dramatic poesy. His wit is ever just and brilliant; his
sentiments new and lively; and his elegance equal to his regularity. Next him
Vanburgh is placed, whose humour seems more natural, and characters more
new; but he owes too many obligations to the French, entirely to pass for an
original; and his total disregard to decency, in a great measure, impairs
his merit. Farquhar is still more lively, and, perhaps, more entertaining
than either; his pieces still continue the favourite performances of the
stage, and bear frequent repe∣tition without satiety; but he often
mistakes pertness for wit, and seldom strikes his characters with
pro∣per force or originality. However, he died very young; and it is
remarkable, that he continued to improve as he grew older; his last play,
intitled <HI>The Beau Stratagem,</HI> being the best of his productions.
Addison, both as a poet and prose writer, deserves
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he highest regard and imitation.
His Campaign, and Letter to Lord Halifax from Italy, are master∣pieces in the
former, and his Essays published in the Spectator are inimitable
specimens of the latter. Whatever he treated of was handled with elegance
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd precision; and that virtue
which was taught in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is writings,
was enforced by his example. Steele <PB N="140" REF="143"/> was Addison's
friend and admirer; his comedies ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
perfectly polite, chaste, and genteel; nor were hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other works contemptible; he wrote on severa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subjects, and yet it is amazing, in
the multi∣plicity of his pursuits, how he found leisure fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the discussion of any. Ever
persecuted by credi∣tors, whom his profuseness drew upon him, or
pur¦suing impracticable schemes, suggested by ill-ground∣ed ambition.
Dean Swift was the professed antago∣nist of both Addison and him. He
perceived that there was a spirit of romance mixed with all the works of the
poets who preceded him; or, in other words, that they had drawn nature on the
most pleas∣ing side. There still therefore was a place left for him,
who, careless of censure, should describe it just as it was, with all
its deformities; he therefore owes much of his fame, not so much to the
greatness of his genius, as to the boldness of it. He was dry,
sarcastic, and severe; and suited his style exactly to the turn of
his thought, being concise and nervous. In this period also flourished
many of subordinate fame. Prior was the first who adopted the French
elegant easy manner of telling a story; but if what he has borrowed from
that nation be taken from him, scarce any thing will be left upon which he
can lay claim to applause in poetry. Rowe was only out∣done by Shakespear
and Otway as a tragic writer; he has fewer absurdities than either; and is,
perhaps, as pathetic as they; but his flights are not so bold, nor his
characters so strongly marked. Perhaps his coming later than the rest may
have contributed to lessen the esteem he deserves. Garth had
success as a poet; and, for a time, his fame was even greater than his
desert. In his principal work, the Dispen∣sary, his versification is
negligent; and his plot is now become tedious; but whatever he may lose as a
poet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t would be improper to rob
him of the merit he de∣serves for having written the prose dedication, and 
<PB N="141" REF="144"/> preface, to the poem already mentioned; in which he has
shewn the truest wit, with the most refined ele∣gance. Parnel, though he
has written but one poem, namely, the Hermit, yet has found a place among the
English first-rate poets. Gay, likewise, by his Fables and Pastorals,
has acquired an equal reputa∣tion. But of all who have added to the stock of
English poetry, Pope, perhaps, deserves the first place. On him
foreigners look as one of the most successful writers of his time; his
versification is the most harmonious, and his correctness the most
re∣markable of all our poets. A noted cotemporary of his own, calls the
English the finest writers on mo∣ral topics, and Pope the noblest moral
writer of all the English. Mr. Pope has somewhere named himself the
last English Muse; and, indeed, since his time, we have seen scarce
any production that can justly lay claim to immortality; he carried the
language to its highest perfection; and those who have attempted still
far∣ther to improve it, instead of ornament, have only caught finery.</P>
<P>Such was the learning of this period; it flourished without
encouragement, and the English taste seemed to diffuse itself over
all Europe. The French tra∣gedies began to be written after the model of ours;
our philosophy was adopted by all who pretended to reason for themselves.
At present, however, when the learned of Europe are turned to the English
writers for instruction, all spirit of learning has ceased amongst us.
So little has been got by literature for more than an age, that none chuse to
turn to it for preferment. Church preferments, which were once given as the
rewards of learning, have, for some time, deviated to the intriguing, venal,
and base. All desire of novelty, in thinking, is suppressed amongst
us; and our scholars, more pleased with security and ease than honour,
cooly follow the reasonings of their predecessors, and walk round the
circle of former dis∣covery.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the death of George I, his son George II<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ascended the throne, of inferior abilities to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> late King; and consequently still
more strongly at¦tached to his dominions on the continent. The va¦rious
subsidies that had been in the last reign grant¦ed, to maintain foreign
connexions, were still kept u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in
this and the late system of politics, underwent n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sort of alteration. The rights and privileges of
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> throne of England were, in
general, committed t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the
minister's care; the royal concern being chief<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> fixed upon balancing the German powers, and gain¦ing
an ascendancy for the Elector of Hanover i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Empire. The ministry was, at first, divided be¦tween Lord
Townshend, a man of extensive know¦ledge; the Earl of Chesterfield, the
only man of ge¦nius employed under this government; and Sir Ro¦bert Walpole,
who soon after engrossed the greate share of the administration to
himself.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Walpole, who is to make the principa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> figure in the present reign, had, from low
begin¦nings, raised himself to the head of the treasury<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Strongly attached to the house of
Hanover, and serv¦ing it at times, when it wanted his assistance, he
sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> maintained the prejudices
with which he set out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and,
unaware of the alteration of sentiments in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nation, still attempted to govern by party. He, pro¦bably, like
every other minister, began by endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ing to serve his country; but, meeting with stron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> opposition, his succeeding
endeavours were rath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> employed in
maintaining his post, than of being ser¦viceable in it. The declining
prerogative of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crown might have
been an early object of his atten¦tion; but, in the sequel, those very
measures whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he took to
increase it, proved to be the most effec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tual means of undermining it. As latterly all h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <PB N="143" REF="146"/> aims were
turned only to serve himself, and his friends, he undertook to make a
majority in the house of com∣mons, by bribing the members; and, what was
still worse, avowed the corruption. As all spirit of in∣tegrity was now
laughed out of the kingdom; and as the people were held to duty by no motives
of religious obedience to the throne, patriotism was ri∣diculed, and venality
practised without shame. As such a disposition of things naturally
produced oppo∣sition, Sir Robert was possessed of a most phlegmatic
insensibility to bear reproach, and a calm dispassionate way of
reasoning upon such topics as he desired to enforce. His discourse
was fluent without elo∣quence; and his reasons convincing, without any
share of elevation.</P>
<P>The house of commons, which, in the preceding reign, had been
distinguished into Whigs and Jaco∣bites, now underwent another change, and
was again divided into the Court and Country party. The Court party were for
favouring all the schemes of the ministry, and applauding all the
measures of the crown. They regarded foreign alliances as condu∣cive to
internal security; and paid the troops of other countries for their
promises of future assistance. Of these Sir Robert was the leader;
and such as he could not convince by his eloquence, he undertook to buy over
by places and pensions. The other side. who called themselves the Country
party, were en∣tirely averse to continental connexions; they com∣plained that
immense sums were lavished on subsi∣lies, which could never be
useful; and that alliances were bought with money, which should be only
re∣warded by a reciprocation of good intentions. These
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooked upon the frequent journies
of the King to his Electoral dominions with a jealous eye, and some∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mes hinted at the alienation of the royal affections
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>om England. Most of these had
been strong as∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rtors of the
Protestant succession; and, not fearing <PB N="144" REF="147"/> the
reproach of Jacobitism, they spoke with stil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> greater boldness. As the Court party generally
threa∣tened the house of commons with imaginary danger to the state; so
these of the Country usually de claimed against the incroachments of the
preroga¦tive. The threats of neither were founded i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> truth; the kingdom was in no danger
from abroad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nor was internal
liberty in the least infringed by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crown. On the contrary, those who viewed the stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with an unprejudiced eye, were of
opinion that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prerogatives of
the crown were the only part of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
constitution that was growing every day weaker; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> while the King's thoughts were turned to foreig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concerns, the ministry were unmindful
of his autho¦rity at home; and that every day the government wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> making hasty steps to an
aristocracy, the worst of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
governments. As Walpole headed the Court party<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so the leaders of the opposite side were Mr. Willia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pitt, Mr. Shippen, Sir William
Wyndham, and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Hungerford.</P>
<P>The great objects of controversy during this reig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were the national debt, and the number
of forces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be kept in pay. The
government, at the accessio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of

this sum was continually found

with the affairs of the continent; that expences were incurred with∣out
prudence or necessity; and that the increase of the national debt, by
multiplying taxes, would, at length, become intolerable to the people.
What∣ever reason there might be in such arguments, they were
notwithstanding constantly over-ruled; and every demand granted with
pleasure and profusion.</P>
<P>All these treaties and alliances, however, in which the kingdom
had been lately involved, seemed no∣way productive of the general tranquility
expected from them. The Spaniards, who had never been thoroughly reconciled,
still continued their depreda∣tions, and plundered the English merchants
upon the southern coasts of America, as if they had been pi∣rates. This was
the reign of negotiations; and, from these alone, the ministry promised
themselves and the nation redress. Still, however, the enemy went on to
insult and seize, regardless of our vain ex-postulations. The British
merchants complained, by petition, of the losses sustained by the
Spaniards; and the house of commons deliberated upon this subject. They
examined the evidence, and present∣ed an address to his Majesty. He
promised them all possible satisfaction, and negotiations were begun as
formerly. And a new treaty was signed at Vienna be∣tween the Emperor and the
Kings of Great Britain and Spain, tending to confirm the former. Though such
transactions did not give the security that was
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xpected from them, yet they, in
some measure, put off the troubles of Europe for a time. An interval of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eace succeeded, in which
scarce any events hap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ened that
deserve the remembrance of an historian;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ch intervals are, however, the
periods of happiness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a
people; for history is too often but the register
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f human calamities. By this treaty
at Vienna the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ing of England
conceived hopes, that the peace of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urope was established upon the most lasting founda∣tion. 
<PB N="146" REF="149"/> Don Carlos, upon the death of the Duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parma, was, by the assistance of
an English fleet, pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in
peaceable possession of Parma and Placentia. Six thousand Spaniards
were quietly admitted, and quar∣tered in the Duchy of Tuscany, to secure
for him the reversion of that Dukedom. Thus we see Eu∣rope, in some
measure, resembling a republic, put∣ting Monarchs into new kingdoms, and
depriving others of their succession by an universal concur∣rence. But
this amicable disposition among the great powers can never continue long;
and the republic of Europe will be but an empty name, until there be some
controlling power set up by universal consent, to enforce obedience to
the law of nations.</P>
<P>During this interval of profound peace, nothing remarkable happened,
except the constant disputa∣tions in the house of commons, where the
contests between the Court and Country party were carried on with the
greatest acrimony; the speeches, on either side, being dictated less by
reason than resent∣ment. A calm uninterested reader is now surprized at
the heat with which many subjects of little im∣portance in themselves, were
discussed at that time; he now smiles at those denunciations of ruin
with which their orations are replete. The truth is, the liberty of a nation is
better supported by such an op∣position, than by what is said in the
opposition.</P>
<P>In times of profound tranquility the slightest oc∣currences
become objects of universal attention. A society of men, intitled, <HI>The
charitable Corporation,</HI> excited the indignation of the public. Their
pro∣fessed intention was, to lend money at legal interest to the poor,
upon small pledges; and to persons of better rank, upon proper security.
Their capital was at first limited to thirty thousand pounds; but they
afterwards increased it to six hundred thousand. This money was granted
in by subscription; and the care of conducting the capital was intrusted
to a pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <PB N="147" REF="150"/>
number of directors. This company, having con∣tinued for more than twenty
years, the cashier, George Robinson, and the warehouse-keeper of the
company, disappeared in one day. Five hun∣dred thousand pounds of the
capital appeared to be sunk, and embezzled by the directors, in a manner the
proprietors could not account for. They there∣fore petitioned the house,
representing the manner in which they had been defrauded of such vasts
sums of mo∣ney, and the distress to which many were reduced to, in
consequence of such imposition. The petition was received, and a secret
committee appointed to inquire into the grievance. They soon discovered a
most iniquitous scene of fraud, which had been carried on by Thompson and
Robinson, in concert with some of the directors, for embezzling the
capital, and cheating the proprietors. Many persons of rank and quality were
concerned in this infamous conspiracy; some of the first characters in
the nation did not escape without censure. The house of commons declared
their resentment, and expelled one or two of their members; but the
sufferers met with scarce any re∣dress. Nor can I mention such a
circumstance with∣out reflecting on that spirit of rapacity and avarice
which infected every degree of people. An ill ex∣ample in the governing part of
a country ever diffuses itself downward; and, while the ministry do not
blush at detection, the people of every rank will not fear guilt. About this
time not less than five members of parliament were expelled for the most
sordid acts of knavery; Sir Robert Sutton, Sir Archibald Grant, and George
Robinson, for their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rauds in the
management of the <HI>Charitable Corpora∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion</HI> scheme; Dennis Bond, Esquire; and Serjeant Burch, for a
fraudulent sale of the late Earl of Der∣wentwater's forfeited estates.
Luxury had produced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rodigality,
the sure parent of every meanness. It was even asserted in the house
of Lords, that not <PB N="148" REF="151"/> one shilling of the forfeited
estates was ever applied to the service of the public; but became the
reward of avarice and venality.</P>
<P>Another occurrence of a more private nature, about this time,
excited public compassion, not without a degree of horror: Richard Smith, a
book∣binder, and his wife, had long lived together, and struggled with
those wants, which, notwithstanding the profusion of the rich at this
time, oppressed the poor. Their mutual tenderness for each other, was the
only comfort they had in their distresses, which distresses were
increased by having a child, which they knew not how to maintain. At length,
they took the desperate resolution of dying by their own hands; the child's
throat was cut, and the husband and wife were found hanging in their
bed-chamber. They left a letter behind, containing the reasons which in∣duced
them to this act of desperation; they declar∣ed, that they could no longer
support a life of such complicated wretchedness; and thought it
tender∣ness to take their child with them, from a world where they
themselves had found no compassion. Suicide, in many instances, is
ascribed to phrenzy: we have here an instance of self-murder, concerted
with composure, and borrowing the aids of reason for its vindication.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE History of England has little, during this interval, to excite
curiosity. The debates in parliament grew every day more obstinate, as
every subject happened to come round in voting the an∣nual supplies. But as
the subjects were mostly the same, so also were the arguments. There
was one, <PB N="149" REF="152"/> however, of a different nature from those in
the usual course of business, which was laboured for stre∣nously by
the ministry, and as warmly opposed by their antagonists, namely, the
excise bill, which Sir Robert Walpole introduced into the house, by first
declaiming against the frauds practised by the factors in London, who were
employed by the American planters in selling their tobacco. To prevent
these frauds he proposed, instead of having the customs levied in the
usual manner upon tobacco, that what was imported should be lodged in
warehouses ap∣pointed for that purpose by the officers of the crown; from
thence to be sold, after paying the duty of four-pence <HI>per</HI> pound,
when the proprietor found a market for it. This proposal raised a violent
ferment, not less in the house than without doors. Those who opposed
the scheme, asserted, that this scheme would expose the factors to
such hardships, that they would not be able to continue the trade, nor
would it prevent the frauds complained of. They asserted, that it would
produce an additional swarm of excise∣officers and warehouse-keepers,
which would at once tender the ministry formidable, and the people
de∣pendant. Arguments, however, were not what the ministry most dreaded;
for the people had been raised into such a ferment, that all the avenues to
the house were crowded with complaining multitudes; and Sir Robert Walpole
began even to fear for his life. The ministry carried the proposal in the
house; but, observ∣ing the tumult of the people, they thought fit to drop
the design. The miscarriage of the bill was celebrated with public
rejoicings in London and Westminster; and the minister was burned in
effigy by the popu∣lace.</P>
<P>This success, in the members of the opposition, encouraged
them to go on to a proposal for repeal∣ing an act made in the last reign,
by which the house of commons was to be septennial. They proposed 
<PB N="150" REF="153"/> that parliaments should again be made triennial, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had been settled at the revolution.
In the course o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this debate, in
which they were opposed, as usual, by the ministry, they reflected, with
great severity, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the measures
of the late reign. They asserted, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the septennial act was an incroachment on the right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the people; that during the
continuance of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> parliament,
several severe laws had been enacted<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that by one of these a man might be removed, and tried in any
place where the jury might be favour∣able to the crown, and where the
prisoners witnesses could not, or dare not, to come. That, by another, a
justice of the peace was impowered to put the best subjects to immediate
death only, after reading a pro∣clamation against riots. The South-Sea
scheme, they said, was established by an act of a septennial
parliament; and the excise bill had like, under their influence also, to
have passed into a law. Sir Wil∣liam Wyndham distinguished himself in
this debate: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Let us suppose,</HI> said he, <HI>a man
without any sense of honour raised to be a chief minister of state.
Suppose him possessed of great wealth; the plunder of the nation.
Suppose him screened by a corrupt majority of his creatures, and
insult∣ing over all men of family, sense, and honour, in the na∣tion. Let
us suppose a venal parliament, and an ignorant King; I hope such a case
will never occur; but should such ever happen to be at once united, a
short parliament will be the only means of lessening the evil.</HI></Q>
Notwithstanding these expostulations, the ministry were, as usual,
vic∣torious, and the motion suppressed by the majo∣rity. The Country
party now found themselves out-numbered upon every occasion; they had long
complained, in vain, that debate was useless, since every member seemed
to have listed himself under the banners of party, to which he held without
shrinking. Despairing therefore of being able to stem the torrent of
corruption, they retired to their seats in the coun∣try, 
<PB N="151" REF="154"/> and left the ministry an undisputed majority in the
house.</P>
<P>The minister being now left without opposition in the house,
took this opportunity to render his ri∣vals odious or contemptible, by getting
several useful laws passed in their absence; while the King
labour∣ed, with equal assiduity, to adjust the political scale of
Europe; and, for this purpose, made several journies to his Electoral
dominions. But his assiduity in heal∣ing foreign differences did not
prevent one of a more domestic nature; for a misunderstanding arose
be∣tween him and the Prince of Wales; a Prince that was the darling of the
people, and who professed his dislike both of the ministry and their
venal measures. He had been, a short time before, married to the Princess
of Saxegotha; and the Prince's mistaking a message from the King, at a
time when the Prin∣cess was lying-in, first caused the rupture. It was
soon after widened by the vile emissaries of the court, so that his
Majesty forbade the Prince his presence; and gave orders that none of his
attendants should be admitted to court. A motion, however, was made in the
house of commons, for increasing the Prince's settlement, which was but
fifty thousand pounds, to an hundred thousand. It was represented that
so much had been granted by the late King, to his pre∣sent Majesty, when
Prince of Wales; and that such a settlement was conformable to the practice
of for∣mer times, and necessary to the independency of the heir apparent to
the English crown. This motion was vigorously opposed by Sir Robert
Walpole, as an incroachment on the prerogative, and an officious in∣termeddling
in the King's family affairs. The sup∣porters of the motion observed, that
the allowance of fifty thousand pounds was not sufficient to defray the
Prince's yearly expences, which, by his Majesty's own regulation, amounted to
sixty-three thousand. The motion, however, met the fate of all other
anti∣ministerial <PB N="152" REF="155"/> measures, being rejected by the
majo∣rity.</P>
<P>But whatever imaginary disappointments the people might suffer,
there was a blow levelled at the little wit that was left remaining, which has
effectually banished all taste from the stage, and from which it has
never since recovered. When Walpole entered into power, he resolved to
despise that set of under∣rate writers, who live by arraigning every
ministry, and disseminate scandal and abuse. For a time he
prosecuted that intention; but, at last, found it ne∣cessary to employ
a set of mean hirelings, to answer calumny with calumny. He wanted judgment
to distinguish genius; or none possessed of such a gift were mean
enough to applaud his measures. From hence he took an implacable aversion
to the press, which so severely exposed his corruption, and branded his
follies. But the press alone was not the only scourge he had to fear; the
theatre joined all its ri∣dicule, and he saw himself exposed as the
object of scorn, as well as hatred. When license once trans∣gresses
the rules of decency, it knows no bounds<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Some of the pieces exhibited at that time were no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only severe, but immoral also. This
was what th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> minister held to; he
brought in a bill to limit th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
number of play-houses; to subject all dramatic writ∣ings to the
inspection of the Lord Chamberlain, whos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> license was to be obtained before any work could ap¦pear. Among
those who undertook to oppose thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bill, was the Earl of Chesterfield, who observed tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the laws already in being for keeping
the stage withi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> due bounds, were
every way sufficient. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>If,</HI> says he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>our stage-players at any time exceed those
bounds, they ough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be
prosecuted, and may be punished. A new law there¦fore is, in the present
instance, unnecessary; and every un¦necessary law is dangerous. Wit,
my Lords, is the pro¦perty of those that have it; and it is too often the
only pro¦perty they have. It is unjust therefore to rob a man at a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> <PB N="153" REF="156"/> <HI>rate
of his possessions; but it is cruelty to spoil him, if al∣ready poor.
If poets and players are to be restrained, let them be restrained like
other subjects; let them be tried by their Peers, and let not a Lord
Chamberlain be made the sovereign judge of wit. A power lodged in the hands
of a single man to determine, without limitation or appeal, is a privilege
unknown to our laws, and inconsistent with our constitution.</HI></Q> The
house applauded his wit and elo∣quence; and the question was carried
against him.</P>
<P>The discontents occasioned by such proceedings at home, were
still more increased by the depredations of the Spaniards. They disputed
the right of the English to cut logwood in the Bay of Campeachy in America; a
right which had been often acknow∣ledged, but never clearly explained, in all
former treaties between the two kingdoms. Their <HI>Guarda Costas</HI>
plundered the English merchants with impu∣nity; and, upon the least
resistance, behaved with insolence, cruelty, and rapine. The subjects
of Bri∣tain were buried in the mines of Potosi, deprived of all means of
conveying their complaints to their protectors, and their vessels
confiscated, in defiance of justice. The English court made frequent
re∣monstrances to that of Madrid, of this outrageous violation of treaties.
and they received for answer only promises of inquiry, which produced no
refor∣mation. Our merchants loudly complained of these outrages; but the
minister expected, from negotia∣tion, that redress which could only be
obtained by arms. He knew that a war would increase the diffi∣culties he had
to encounter; and he was sensible that those he already encountered
required all his art and industry to remove. A war, he was sensible,
would require expences which he wished to share in peace. In short, all
his measures now were not to serve the state, but to preserve his
power. Influenced by these considerations, he industriously endcavoured
to avoid a rupture. The fears he discovered only served to 
<PB N="154" REF="157"/> increase the enemies insolence and pride. However
the complaints of the English merchants were loud enough to reach the house
of commons; their let∣ters and memorials were produced, and their griev∣ances
enforced at the bar by council. The house, at length, agreed to an address,
to intreat his Majesty to obtain effectual relief, and to convince Spain that
its indignities would be no longer borne with impunity. These complaints
produced a convention between the two crowns, concluded at Prado, importing,
that two plenipotentiaries should meet at Madrid, to regulate the
respective pretensions of either kingdom, respect∣ing the trade in
America, and the limits of Florida and Carolina. These conferences were to be
finish∣ed in eight months; and, in the mean time, all ho∣stile preparations
should cease on either side. His Catholic Majesty agreed to pay the
King of Great Bri∣tain ninety-five thousand pounds, to satisfy the de∣mands
of the British subjects upon the crown of Spain, after deducting from the
whole the demands of the crown and subjects of Spain upon that of Britain.
Such an agreement as this was justly re∣garded on the side of the British
ministry as a base desertion of the honour and interests of their
coun∣try. And when the house of commons came to take the convention under
consideration, it produced the warmest debate. All the adherents to the
Prince of Wales had joined in the opposition. It was alledg∣ed, that the
Spaniards, instead of granting a redress, had rather extorted a release
for their former conduct. That they still asserted their former right to
search∣ing English ships, and had not so much as men∣tioned the word
<HI>satisfaction</HI> in all the treaty. Not∣withstanding all the
remonstrances against this treaty, the majority of the house declared in
its favour; and several members of the opposite sentiment retired from
parliament, having despaired of being longer <PB N="155" REF="158"/>
serviceable in a place where party, and not reason, prevailed.</P>
<P>As Spain had engaged to pay a large sum of money by this
convention, some time after, when the mini∣ster demanded a supply, upon a
different occasion, Lord Bathurst moved to know, whether Spain had paid the
sums stipulated, as the time limited for the payment was expired. The Duke
of Newcastle, by his Majesty's permission, acquainted the house, that
it was not paid; and that Spain had assigned no rea∣son for the delay. In
some measure, therefore, to atone for his former slowness, the
minister now be∣gan to put the nation into a condition for war. Let∣ters of
reprisal were granted against the Spaniards. These preparations were
regarded by the Spanish court as actual hostilities. The French
ambassador at the Hague declared, that the King his master was obliged,
by treaties, to assist the King of Spain; he dissuaded the Dutch from
espousing the cause of Eng∣land; who promised him an inviolable
neutrality. It is curious enough to consider the revolutions which the
political system of Europe had undergone. But about twenty years before,
France and Eng∣land were combined against Spain; at present, France and
Spain united against England. Those statesmen who build upon alliances
as a lasting basis of power, will, at length, find themselves fatally
mistaken.</P>
<P>A rupture between Great Britain and Spain being now become
inevitable, the people, who had long clamoured for war, began to feel uncommon
alacrity at its approach; and the ministry finding it unavoid∣able, began to
be earnest in preparation. Orders were issued for augmenting the land
forces, and rais∣ing a body of marines. Two rich Spanish prizes were taken
in the Mediterranean, and war declared against them in form. Admiral Vernon
was sent to the West-Indies, commander of the fleet, in order
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o distress the Spaniards in
that part of the globe. <PB N="156" REF="159"/> Vernon was a rough and honest
soldier, untainted with the corruption or the effeminacy of the times. He
had, in the house of commons, asserted, that Porto-Bello, a fort and
harbour in South America, might be easily taken, and that he himself would
undertake to reduce it with six ships only. A pro∣ject which appeared so
wild, and impossible, was ri∣diculed by the ministry; but, as he still
insisted upon the proposal, they were pleased in complying with his
request. This would at once rid them of a trouble∣some antagonist in the
house; and, in case of his failure, there would be a new cause of triumph
in his disgrace. In this, however, they were disappointed. The admiral,
with six ships only, attacked and de∣molished all the fortifications of
the place, and came away victorious, almost without bloodshed. This dawning
of success upon the British arms induced the house of commons to enter
vigorously into the King's measures for carrying on the war. They in∣abled
him to equip a very powerful navy; they voted a subsidy to the King of
Denmark, and impowered their Sovereign to defray some other expences, not
specified in the estimates; the whole of their grants amounting to about
four millions. The war was carried on with vigour, and the debates in the
house of commons became less violent. In a nation, like England, of arts,
arms, and commerce, war, at cer∣tain intervals of time, must ever be
serviceable. It turns the current of wealth from the industrious to the
enterprising. Thus, all orders of mankind find encouragement, and the nation
becomes composed of individuals, who have skill to acquire property, and
who have courage to defend it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>A War between England and Spain was sufficient to communicate
disturbances over all the globe. Countries that were once too obscure to be
known, were now seen to send out fleets, one ship of which was capable of
destroying all the naval power of an Asiatic empire. A squadron of
ships commanded by Commodore Anson was equipped, in order to sail through
the Streights of Magellan into the South Sea, and to act against the enemy on
the coasts of Chili and Peru. This fleet was to co-operate occasionally
with Admiral Vernon across the Isthmus of Darien; but the delays and
blunders of the ministry frustrated this scheme, though originally well
laid. However, though too late in the season, the Commodore set forward
with five ships of the line, a frigate, and two store-ships, supplied
with provisions and other mer∣chandize, designed to carry on a trade with
the sa∣vage inhabitants of that part of the world, or to conciliate their
affections. The number of men a∣mounted, in all, to about fourteen hundred,
includ∣ing two hundred invalids taken from the hospitals, and two hundred new
raised recruits. This whole expedition is a fine instance of the power of
perse∣verance in forcing fortune. The Commodore steer∣ed his course by
the island of Madeira, proceeded to the Cape Verd Islands, and sailed
along the coasts of Brazil. He refreshed for some time at the island of
St. Catharine, in twenty-seven degrees of southern latitude; a spot that
enjoys all the verdure and fruit∣age of those luxurious climates. From this
place he steered still onward into the cold and tempestuous cli∣mates of
the south, along the coast of Patagonia; and, in about five months, entered
the famous Streights of Magellan. After having suffered the most violent
tem∣pests he doubled Cape Horn; the rest of his fleet were 
<PB N="158" REF="161"/> dispersed or wrecked; his crew deplorably disabled
by the scurvy; and his own ship with difficulty ar∣rived on the Island of
Juan Fernandez. In this de∣licious abode he remained for some time, where
na∣ture seemed, in some measure, to console mankind far the calamities
of their own avarice and ambition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
In order to improve still farther a retreat of such elegance, he ordered
several European seeds and fruits to be sown upon the island, which
increased to such a surprising degree, that some Spaniards, who,
seve∣ral years after, landed there, and found them in plenty, could not avoid
acknowledging this act of generosity and benevolence. Here the Commodore was
joined by one ship more of his fleet, and by the Tryal frigate of seven
guns. Advancing now north∣ward, towards the tropic of Capricorn, he attacked
the city of Payta by night. In this bold attempt he made no use of his
ships, nor even landed all his men. A few soldiers landed by night, and
filled the whole town with terror and confusion. The governor of the
garrison, and the inhabitants, fled on all sides; accustomed to cruelty
over a conquered enemy them∣selves, they expected a similitude of
treatment. In the mean time, for three days, a small number of English kept
possession of the town, and stripped it of all its treasures and
merchandize, to an immense a∣mount. Such of the negroes as had not fled were
made use of in carrying the goods of their former masters on board the
English shipping; and the Spa∣niards refusing to treat soon saw their
town all in flames. This, however, was but a small punish∣ment for all the
cruelties which they had practised in taking possession of that
country, upon its first in∣habitants. The plunder of this place served to
in∣rich the captors; and the ravage made among them, by the scurvy, still
increased the share of every sur∣vivor. This small squadron now came
up as far as Pa∣nama, situated on the Streights of Darien. Thus they 
<PB N="159" REF="162"/> came upon on the western side of the great American
continent; and Admiral Vernon was expcted to succeed on the opposite side
nearer home. Thus the Spanish Empire was attacked on both sides; but the
scheme failed from Vernon's want of success.</P>
<P>Anson, who now only commanded two ships, the remainder having
either put back to England, or, being wrecked by the tempests, bounded all
his hopes to the taking one of those rich Spanish ships, which trade
between the Philippine islands, near the coast of China and Mexico, on the
Spanish main. But one or two, at the most, of these vessels
passed from one continent to the other in a year. The ships are made
immensely strong, large, and carry great quan∣ties of treasure and
merchandize. The Commodore therefore, and his little fleet, traversed that
great ocean lying between the Asiatic and American con∣tinent, in hopes of
meeting this rich prize, which it was hoped would, at this time of the year,
return from the East, and would amply repay the adventurers for all their
dangers and fatigues. Avarice thus became honourable when pursued through
peril and distress. But the scurvy once more visited his mariners, now
long kept at sea, and without fresh provisions. This disorder, though
it takes the same name, is very dif∣ferent from that on land. The sea
scurvy is attend∣ed with an universal putrefaction, the teeth loosen, old
wounds that had been healed again open, and sometimes the limbs are seen to
drop off at the joints. By this terrible disorder several of his men daily
fell, and others were disabled. One of his ships be∣coming leaky, and the
number of his hands decreas∣ing, he thought proper to set it on fire in the
midst of the ocean. His fleet now being reduced only to one ship, called
the <HI>Centurion,</HI> of sixty guns, and all the crew in the most
deplorable situation, he cast an∣chor on the deserted island of Tinian,
which lies About half way between the old and new world. <PB N="160" REF="163"/>
This island had some years before been peopled by near thirty thousand
inhabitants, but an epidemical distemper coming among them, destroyed a
part; and the rest forsook the place. Nothing, however, could exceed the
beauty of this spot. The most ro∣mantic imagination cannot form a scene
surpassing what Tinian naturally afforded; greens, groves, cas∣cades,
fields, flowers, and prospects. This retreat saved the English
squadron. All that a sea-beaten company of mariners could wish, they
found here in great abundance; clear and wholesome water, me∣dicinal herbs,
domestic animals, and other necessa∣ries for refitting their shattered
vessel. Thus refresh∣ed, he went forward towards China, passed by the
kingdom of Formosa, and went up the river Canton in order to careen the only
ship that now was left him. Being thus far on his way homeward, nothing can
better testify the hardy and untameable spirit of the English, than his
venturing once more back into the same ocean where he had experienced such
a va∣riety of distress. The Commodore having put his vessel into good
order, by the assistance of the Chi∣nese, and having taken Dutch and
Indian sailors on board, he again returned towards America. At length, on the
9th of June, he discovered the galleon he so ardently expected. This
vessel was formed as well for the purposes of war as of merchandize. It
mount∣ed sixty guns and five hundred men, while the crew of the Commodore did
not exceed half that number. The engagement soon began; but as those who
op∣pose have always the advantage of those who de∣fend, and as the
English are more expert in naval affairs than any other nation; the Spanish
ship soon became the Centurion's prize. There were but a few men killed on
the side of the English, while the Spaniards lost near seventy. The
conqueror now returned to Canton oncemore with his prize. He there maintained
the honour of his country, in re∣fusing <PB N="161" REF="164"/> to pay the
imposts which were laid upon ordi∣nary merchants; and insisted that an
English ship of war was exempted from such a duty. From Canton he
proceeded to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and prose∣cuted his voyage to
England, where he arrived in safety, with immense riches. His last prize
was valued at three hundred and thirteen thousand pounds ster∣ling; and the
different captures that had been made before this last piece of good fortune,
might amount to as much more. Upon his return, Commodore Anson received all
that honour which prudence and perseverance deserve. He soon became the
oracle consulted in all naval deliberations; the King after wards raised
him to the dignity of the peerage; and he was made first Lord of the
Admiralty.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>THE expedition of Anson took up near three years. The English,
in the mean time, car∣ried on their operations against Spain with vigour, and
various success. When Anson had set out, it was only to act a
subordinate part to a formidable armament, designed for the coasts of New
Spain, consisting of twenty-nine ships of the line, and al∣most an
equal number of frigates, furnished with all kinds of warlike stores, and
near fifteen thousand seamen, and twelve thousand land forces. Never was
a fleet more completely equipped, nor never had the nation more sanguine
hopes of victory. Lord Cathcart commanded the land forces; but, dying on the
passage, the command devolved upon General Wentworth, whose chief merit
was his favour with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose in
power. This, with several other unfortunate
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ircumstances, concurred to
frustrate the hopes of the <PB N="162" REF="165"/> Public. The ministry,
without any visible reason, had detained the fleet in England until the
season for action was almost over. In the country where they were to
carry on their operations, periodical rains begin about the end of April; and
this change in the atmosphere is always attended with epidemical
dis∣tempers. They, at length, however, set sail for the continent of New
Spain; and, after some tempests, and some delays, arrived before
Carthagena. This city, which lies within sixty miles of Panama, serves as
the magazine for the Spanish merchandize, which is brought from Europe
hither, and from thence tran∣sported, by land, to Panama, lying on the
opposite coast. The taking of Carthagena therefore would interrupt the
whole trade between Old Spain and the New. The troops were landed on the
island Terra Bomba, near the mouth of the harbour, known by the name of the
Bocca-Chica, which was fortified with all the arts of engineering. The
Bri∣tish forces erected a battery on shore, with which they made a breach
in the principal fort, while the Admiral sent in a number of ships to
divide the fire of the enemy; and to co-operate with the endea∣vours of the
army. The breach being deemed prac∣ticable, the forces advanced to the attack;
but the Spaniards deserted the forts; which, had they cou¦rage, they might
still have defended with success<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The troops, upon this success, were brought neare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the city, where they found a greater
opposition tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they had
expected. The climate killed numbers o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the men; and a dissension which arose between th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> land and naval officers, retarded all
the operations<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Stimulated by mutual
recriminations, the general or¦dered his troops to attack the fort of St.
Lazar; but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> guides being
slain, the troops mistook their way, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attacked the strongest part of the fortification, where after
suffering incredible slaughter, with the most se¦rene intrepidity, they
were, at length, obliged to re¦tire. <PB N="163" REF="166"/> Bad provisions, a
horrid climate, and epidemi∣cal fever, still more contributed to thin their
num∣bers, and to deprive them of all hopes of success. It was determined
therefore to reimbark the troops, and to conduct them, as soon as
possible, from this scene of slaughter and contagion. The
fortifications and harbour were demolished; and the fleet returned to
Jamaica. This fatal miscarriage, which tarnished the British arms, was no
sooner known in England, than the kingdom was filled with murmurs and
dis∣content; a measure which, if it had succeeded, would have crowned the
promoters of it with honour, now only served to cover them with reproach. The
greatest part of this discontent fell upon the mini∣ster; his former
conduct, which justly deserved cen∣sure, was not so powerfully objected
against him, as this failure, of which he was innocent. It is not vil∣lainy,
but misfortune that finds censure from man∣kind. Besides, the activity of
the enemy, in distress∣ing the trade of England contributed to increase
the murmurs of the people. Their privateers were so numerous and
successful, that in the beginning of this year they had taken, since the
commencement of the war, four hundred and seven ships, belonging to the
subjects of Great Britain. The English, though at immense expence in
equipping fleets, seemed tame∣ly to lie down under every blow, and suffered
one loss after another without reprisal. This general dis∣content had a
manifest influence upon the election of members for the new parliament. All
the adherents of the Prince of Wales, who now lived, retired from the court as
a private gentleman, concurred in the opposition to the ministry.
Obstinate struggles were maintained in all parts of the kingdom; and such
a national spirit of opposition prevailed, that the Country interest
seemed, at length, to preponderate
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the house of commons. It was
soon seen that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterest
of the minister was in the wane, and that <PB N="164" REF="167"/> opinion,
once established, began to deprive him of even those who had determined
to act with neutra∣lity. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>In proclinantes,</HI> as Ovid says, <HI>omne
recumbit onus.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Sir Robert now tottered on the brink of ruin. He was sensible
that nothing but a division in the oppo∣sition could give him safety. The
Prince was his most formidable rival; a Prince revered by the whole nation,
for his humanity, benevolence, and candour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> These were only private virtues; but these were
al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had then a liberty of
exercising. The minister's first attempt was, to endeavour taking him
from the party; a message therefore was carried to his roya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> highness by the Bishop of Oxford,
importing, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Prince would
write a letter to the King, he and all his counsellors should be taken into
favour, fifty thousand pounds should be added to his revenue, two hundred
thousand given him to pay his debts, and suitable provision should be
made, in due time, for all his followers. This, to a Prince already involved in
debt, from the necessity of keeping up his dignity<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was a tempting offer; but his royal highness
gene∣rously disdained it, declaring he would accept no such conditions
which were dictated to him under the influence of Sir Robert Walpole. The
minister now therefore saw that no arts could dissolve the combination
against him; he resolved, as an expiring struggle, to try his strength
once more in the house of commons upon a disputed election; but he had the
mortification to see the majority still increased against him by
sixteen voices. He then declared he would never sit in that house more.
The parliament was adjourned the next day, and Sir Robert being created Earl of
Orford, resigned all his employments. Never was a joy more universal and
sincere than this resignation produced. The people now flattered
themselves that all their domestic grievances would find redress; that
their commerce would be protected abroad; that the war would be carried on with
vi∣gour; <PB N="165" REF="168"/> and that the house of commons would be
unanimous in every measure. But they were disap∣pointed in most of their
expectations. The miscon∣duct of a minister is more likely to affect his
suc∣cessor than himself, as a weak reign ever produces a feeble
succession. The house of commons had been for a long time increasing
in power, and Walpole, with all his arts, was, in fact, rather weakening than
extending the prerogative. By his method of brib∣ing opposition he had taught
the venal to oppose him; and, by his increasing the national debt, he
weakened the vigour of the crown in war, and made it more dependant upon
parliament in times of peace. A part of those who succeeded him were
therefore sensible of this, and still resolved to support the crown,
which they regarded as the only declining branch of the constitution. Another
part, who cla∣moured from motives of self-interest, having now attained the
object of their desires, blundered on in the former measures, studious of
fortune and not of fame. In short, his successors pursuing all the
former schemes of the deposed minister, presented the poli∣tical part
of the nation with the mortifying prospect of pretended patriotism
unstripped of its mask, and shewed the little certainty there is in all
political rea∣sonings.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>THE war with Spain had now continued for several years, with but
indifferent success. Some insuccessful expeditions were carried on in
the West-Indies under Admiral Vernon, Commodore Knowles, and others; and
these were all aggravated by a set of worthless and mercenary
<HI>things,</HI> called <HI>Political Writers.</HI> A class of beings first
employed against <PB N="166" REF="169"/> Walpole, and afterwards encouraged by
him, at the expence, as it is said, of not less than thirty thou∣sand a
year. These were men naturally too dull to shine in any of the politer
kinds of literature, which might adorn either a scholar or a gentleman; and
therefore they turned their thoughts to politics; a science on which they
might declaim without know∣ledge, and be dull without detection. These men, I
say, had, for some time, embarrassed the constitution, inflamed the
people, and were paid with large pen∣sions from the crown. It was upon this
occasion that they exaggerated every misconduct, and drew fright∣ful
pictures of the distress and misery which they foreboded to posterity.
This clamour, and want of success in a naval war, in which the principal
strength of the kingdom lay, induced the new ministry to di∣vert the
attention of the public to a war, which might be carried on by land. The King's
attach∣ment to his Electoral dominions contributed still more to turn the
current of British indignation that way, and an army was therefore now
prepared to be sent into Flanders; the war with Spain being be∣come an object
of secondary consideration.</P>
<P>To have a clear, yet concise, idea of the origin of the troubles
on the continent, it will be expedient to go back, for some years, and trace
the measures of the European republic to that period where we for∣merly left
them. After the Duke of Orleans, who had been regent of France, died, Cardinal
Fleury undertook to settle that confusion in which the former had left the
kingdom. His moderation was equal to his prudence; he was sincere, frugal,
modest, and simple. Under him France repaired her losses, and inriched
herself by commerce; he only left the state to its own natural methods of
thriving, and saw it daily assuming its former health and vigour. During
the long interval of peace, which his councils had procured for Europe, two
powers, unregarded, now <PB N="167" REF="170"/> began to attract the notice, and
the jealousy of their neighbouring states. Peter the Great had already
civi∣lized Russia, and this new extensive empire began to influence the
councils of other Princes, and to give laws to the North. The other power was
that of Prussia, whose dominions were compact and popu∣lous, and whose
forces were well maintained, and ready for action. The Empire continued under
Charles VI, who had been placed upon the throne by the treaty of Utrecht.
Sweden languished, be∣ing not yet recovered from the destructive projects
of Charles XII. Denmark was powerful; and part of Italy subject to the
masters which had been imposed upon it by foreign treaties. All, however,
continued to enjoy a profound peace, till the death of Au∣gustus, King of
Poland, again kindled up the gene∣ral flame. The Emperor Charles VI,
assisted by the arms of Russia, declared for the Elector of Saxony,
son to the deceased King. On the other hand, France declared for
Stanislaus, who had been long since elected King of Poland by Charles XII,
and whose daughter had been since married to the French King. Stanislaus
repaired to Dantzick in order to support his election; ten thousand
Russians appear∣ing, the Polish nobility dispersed, and their new
elect∣ed Monarch was shut up, and besieged by so small a number of
forces: the city was taken, and the King
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scaped with the utmost
difficulty, being made a pri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oner,
and fifteen hundred Frenchmen that were sent
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his assistance were made
prisoners of war. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad now no
hopes left but in the assistance of France, which accordingly resolved
to give him powerful suc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ours,
by distressing the house of Austria. The views
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f France were seconded by Spain
and Sardinia; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth hoped to grow
more powerful by a division of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he
spoils of Austria; and France had motives of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>liance and revenge. A French army
therefore soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver-ran the empire
under the conduct of old Marshal <PB N="168" REF="171"/> Villars; the Duke of
Montemar, the Spanish gene∣ral, was equally victorious in the kingdom of
Na∣ples; and the Emperor, Charles VI, had the morti∣fication of seeing
himself deprived of the greatest part of Italy, for having attempted to
give a King to Poland. These rapid successes of France and its allies
soon compelled the Emperor to demand a peace. By this treaty Stanislaus,
upon whose account the war was undertaken, was obliged to renounce all right
to the throne of Poland; and France made some valuable acquests of
dominion; particularly the Duchy of Lorrain. In the year 1740, the death of the
Emperor gave the French another opportunity of exerting their ambition.
Regardless of treaties, particularly the pragmatic sanction, as it was
called, which settled upon the daughter of the Emperor the reversion of all
his dominions, they caused the Elec∣tor of Bavaria to be crowned Emperor.
Thus the daughter of Charles VI, descended from an illustri∣ous line of
Emperors, saw herself stripped of her in∣heritance, and, for an whole
year, without hopes of succour. She had scarce closed her father's eyes,
when she lost Silesia, by an irruption of the young King of Prussia,
who seized the opportunity of her defenceless state, to renew his ancient
pretensions to that province of which it must be owned his ances∣tors had
been unjustly deprived. France, Saxony, and Bavaria, attacked the rest of
her dominions. In this forlorn situation she found a powerful ally in
Britain; Sardinia and Holland soon after came to her assistance; and,
last of all, Russia joined in her cause. It may be demanded, What part
Britain had in these continental measures? The interests of Hanover; the
security and aggrandizement of that Electorate, depended upon the proper
regulation of the empire. Lord Carteret had now taken that place in the royal
confidence which had formerly been possessed by Walpole; and, by
pursuing these mea∣sures <PB N="169" REF="172"/> he soothed the wishes
of his master, and opened a more extensive field for his own ambition. He
ex∣pected honour from victories which could produce no good; and campaigns,
whether successful or not, that could only terminate in misfortune. When
the par∣liament met, his Majesty informed them of his strict adherence to
his engagements, though attacked in his own dominions; and that he had
augmented the Bri∣tish forces in the Low Countries with sixteen thou∣sand
Hanoverians. When the supplies came to be considered, by which this
additional number of troops was to be paid, it raised violent debates in both
houses. It was considered as hiring the troops of the Electorate to fight
their own cause. The mi∣nistry, however, who were formerly remarkable for
declaiming against continental measures, now boldly stood up for them;
and, at length, by dint of num∣ber, carried their cause. The people saw,
with pain, their former defenders sacrificing the blood and trea∣sure of
the nation upon destructive alliances; they knew not now on whom to rely for
safety; and be∣gan to think that patriotism was but an empty name. However
injurious these measures might have been to the nation, they were of
infinite service to the Queen of Hungary. She began, at this period, to
triumph over all her enemies. The French were driven out of Bohemia. Her
general, Prince Charles, at the head of a large army, invaded the dominions of
Bavaria. Her rival, the nominal Emperor, was obliged to fly before her;
abandoned by his allies, and stripped of all his dominions, he repaired to
Francfort, where he lived in indigence and obscurity. He agreed to remain
neuter during the remainder of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he
war; while the French, who first began it as al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, supported the burthen. The troops sent by
England to the Queen's assistance were commanded by the Earl of Stair, an
experienced commander, who had learned the art of war under the famous 
<PB N="710" REF="173"/> Prince Eugene; and the chief object he had first in
view was, to effect a junction with the army com∣manded by Prince Charles of
Lorrain. The French, in order to prevent this junction, assembled sixty
thousand men upon the river Mayne, under the com∣mand of Marshal Noailles,
who posted his troops upon the east side of that river. The British
forces, to the number of forty thousand, pushed forward on the other
side, while the French, in the mean time, found means to cut off all the
communications by which they could be supplied with provisions. The King of
England arrived at the camp while the army was in this situation; and
seeing it in danger of starving, resolved to proceed forward, to join
twelve thousand Hanoverians and Hessians, who had reached Hanau. With
this view he decamped; but before the army had marched three leagues, he found
the enemy had inclosed him on every side, near a village called Detingen..
In this situation he must have fought at great disadvantage, if he began
the attack; and if he continued in the same situation, his army must have
perished for want o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
subsistence. The impetuosity of the French, how∣ever, saved the
English army; they passed a defil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which they should have guarded; and, under the conduct of the
Duke of Gramont, their horse charg∣ed with great impetuosity. They were
received by the English infantry with undaunted resolution; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> French were obliged to give way, and to
pass th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mayne with great
precipitation, with the loss o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
about five thousand. The King, who was possesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of personal courage, which seems hereditary to
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> family, exposed himself to
a severe fire of cannon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as well
as musquetry; and, in the midst of the rank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> encouraged his troops, by his presence and example<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The whole of the battle, on either
side, exhibited mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> courage than
conduct. The English had the hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of the day; but the French soon after took possessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of the field of bat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, treating the wounded Engli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <PB N="171" REF="174"/> that were left behind with a clemency
unprecedented in ancient history, and that serves to shew how much
superior the present times are in point of humanity to the boasted ages
of antiquity. Though the Eng∣lish were victorious upon this occasion, yet
the Earl of Stair, who commanded, did not assume any ho∣nour from such a
victory; he was unwilling that his reputation should suffer for measures,
which he was not allowed to conduct; he therefore solicited, and obtained
leave to resign; and the British troops de∣sisted from further
operations that campaign.</P>
<P>Mean while the French went on with vigour on every quarter; they
opposed Prince Charles of Lor∣rain, and interrupted his progress in his
attempts to pass the Rhine, gained some successes in Italy; but their
chief expectations were placed in a projected in∣vasion of England. Cardinal
Fleury was now dead, and Cardinal Tencin succeeded to his place a person of
a very different character from his predecessor, proud, turbulent, and
enterprizing. France. from the violence of parliamentary disputes in England,
had been long persuaded that the country was ripe for a revolution, and only
wanted the presence of the Pretender to induce the majority to declare
against the reigning family. Several needy adventurers, who wished for a
change; some men of broken fortunes, and almost all the Roman Catholics of
the kingdom, endeavoured to confirm the court of France in these
sentiments. An invasion therefore was actually pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected. Charles, son of the old Chevalier St. George,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eparted from Rome in the
disguise of a Spanish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourier, and prosecuting his journey to Paris, had
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n audience of the French King. The
troops de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igned for this expedition
amounted to fifteen thou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and;
preparations were made for embarking them
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Dunkirk, and some other of the
nearest ports to England, under the eye of the young Pretender; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>even thousand of the number
actually went on <PB N="172" REF="175"/> board. The Duke de Roquefuille, with
twenty ship of the line, was to see them landed safely in England; and
Count Saxe was to command them, when put ashore. The whole project, however,
was discon∣certed by the appearance of Sir John Norris, with a superior
fleet, making up against them; the French fleet was obliged to put back; a
very hard gale of wind damaged their transports beyond redress. All hopes
of invasion were now frustrated; and, at length, the French thought fit
openly to declare war.</P>
<P>But, though fortune seemed to favour England on this occasion,
yet, on others, she was not equally propitious. The combined fleets of France
and Spain, for some time, fought the British armament under Admiral
Matthews and Lestock, though with infe∣rior forces, and came off upon nearly
equal terms, Such a parity of success in England was regarded as a defeat.
Both the English Admirals were tried by a court-martial; Mathews, who had
fought the ene∣my with intrepidity, was declared incapable of serv∣ing for
the future in his Majesty's navy. Lestock, who had kept aloof, was
acquitted with honour, for he had intrenched himself within the punctilios of
discipline; he barely did his duty; a man of honour, when his country is at
stake, should do more.</P>
<P>The proceedings in the Netherlands were still more unfavourable.
The French had assembled a formid∣able army of one hundred and twenty
thousand men; the chief command of which was given to Count Saxe. This
General was originally a soldier of for∣tune, and natural son to Augustus
King of Poland, by the famous Countess of Konigsmark. He had been bred from
his youth in camps, and had shewn the most early instances of cool
intrepidity. He, in the beginning of the war, had offered his service to
several crowns, and, among the rest, it is said, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat of England; but his offers
were rejected. He <PB N="173" REF="176"/> was possessed of great
military talents; and, by long habit, preserved an equal composure in the
midst of battle, as in a drawing-room at court. On the other side, the
allied forces, consisting of English, Hano∣verians, Dutch, and
Austrians, did not amount to above seventy thousand. These were
incapable of withstanding such a superior force, and commanded by such
a General. The French besieged and took Fribourg, before they went into
winter quarters; and early the next campaign invested the city of Tournay.
The allies were resolved to prevent the loss of this city by a battle.
Their army was infe∣rior, and they were commanded by the Duke of Cum∣berland.
Notwithstanding these disadvantages they marched towards the enemy, and
took post in sight of the French army, which was incamped on an eminence;
the village of Antoine on the right, a wood on their left, and the town of
Fontenoy before them. This advantageous situation did not repress
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he ardour of the English; on the
thirtieth day of April the Duke of Cumberland marched to the at∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack at two o'clock in the morning. The
British <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfantry pierced forward,
bore down all opposition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd,
for near an hour, were victorious. Marshal Saxe was at that time sick of
the same disorder of which he afterwards died. He visited all the posts
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a litter, and saw,
notwithstanding all appearances, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the day was his own. The English column,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithout command, by a mere
mechanical courage, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad advanced
upon the enemies lines, which formed
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n avenue on each side to receive
them. The French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtillery began to

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere obliged to retreat about three
o'clock in the af∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rnoon. This was
one of the most bloody battles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>at had been fought this age; the allies left upon

slain; and the French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ught their
victory with near an equal number.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="177"/> This blow, by which Tournay was taken, gave
the French a manifest superiority all the rest of the campaign, and which
they did not forego during the continuance of the war. The Emperor, Charles
VII, who had been raised to the throne from the duke∣dom of Bavaria, and for
whom the war first began was now dead; yet this did not in the least
restore tranquility to Europe. The Grand Duke of Tus∣cany, husband to the
Queen of Hungary, was de∣clared Emperor upon his decease; but the war
be∣tween France and the allies still continued; and the original views and
interests seemed now quite for∣gotten.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>THE intended French invasion had rouzed al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the attention of the English ministry; and no¦thing
but loyalty breathed throughout the whol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kingdom. The administration of affairs being com¦mitted to the
Earl of Harrington, the Earl of Chester¦field, and others, who enjoyed a
great share of po¦pularity, the views of the crown were no longe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thwarted by an opposition in
parliament. The Admiral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rowley and
Warren had retrieved the honour of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> British flag, and made several rich captures. Louis¦burg in
the island of Cape Breton, in North Ame¦rica, a place of great consequence
to the Britis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commerce,
surrendered to General Pepperel, whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a short time after, two French East-India ships, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> another from Peru laden with treasure, supposing
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place still in
possession of the French, sailed into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> harbour, and their capture added to the English
suc¦cess. It was in this period of universal satisfactio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the son of the old Pretender
resolved to mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 
<PB N="175" REF="178"/> an effort at gaining the British crown. Young Charles
Edward, the adventurer in question, had been bred in a luxurious court
without sharing its effeminacy; he was enterprising and ambitious; but,
either from inexperience, or natural inability, utterly unequal to the
undertaking. He was flattered by the rash, the superstitious, and the
needy, that the kingdom was ripe for a revolt; that the people could no longer
bear the immense load of taxes, which was daily in∣creasing; and that the
most considerable persons in the kingdom would gladly seize the
opportunity of crowding to his standard. Being furnished with some money,
and still larger promises from France, who fanned this ambition in him,
from which they hoped to gain some advantages; he embarked for Scot∣land on
board a small frigate, accompanied by the Marquis Tullibardine, Sir. Thomas
Sheridan, and a few other desperate adventurers. For the conquest of the
whole British empire he brought with him seven officers, and arms for two
thousand men. For∣tune, which ever persecuted his family, seemed no way
more favourable to him; his convoy, a ship of sixty guns, was so
disabled in an engagement with an English man of war, called the
<HI>Lion,</HI> that it re∣turned to Brest, while he was obliged to continue
his course to the western parts of Scotland; and, landing on the coast of
Lochaber, he was, in a little time, joined by some chiefs of the Highland
Clans, and their vassals. These chiefs had ever continued to exercise
an hereditary jurisdiction over all their tenants. This power of life and
death vested in the Lords of the manor, was a privilege of the old feu∣dal
law, long abolished in England, but which had been confirmed to the Scotch
lairds at the time of the union. From hence we see, that a chief had the
power of commanding all his vassals, and that im∣mediate death was the
consequence of their disobey∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng. By means of these chiefs therefore he soon 
<PB N="176" REF="179"/> saw himself at the head of fifteen hundred men; and
invited others to join him by his manifestoes, which were dispersed
throughout all the Highlands.</P>
<P>The boldness of this enterprize astonished all Eu∣rope; it
awakened the fears of the pusillanimous, the pity of the wise, and the
loyalty of all. The whole kingdom seemed unanimously bent upon opposing
the enterprize, which they were sensible, as being sup∣ported only by
Papists, would be instrumental in re∣storing Popery. The ministry was
no sooner con∣firmed of the truth of his arrival, which, at first, they
could scarely be induced to believe, than Sir John Cope was ordered to
oppose his progress. In the mean time, the young adventurer marched to
Perth, where the unnecessary ceremony was perform∣ed of proclaiming the
Chevalier de St. George, his father, King of Great Britain. The rebel army,
descending from the mountains, seemed to gather as it went. They advanced
towards Edinburgh, which they entered without opposition. Here too the
pa∣geantry of proclamation was performed, in which he promised to
dissolve the union, and redress the grievances of the country. But,
though he was master of the capital, yet the citadel, which goes by the name
of the <HI>Castle,</HI> a strong fortress built upon a rock, and
commanded by General Guest, braved all his attempts. In the mean time, Sir
John Cope, who had pursued them to the Highlands, but declin∣ed meeting them
in their descent, now reinforced by two regiments of dragoons, resolved to
march towards Edinburgh, and give them battle. The young adventurer, unwilling
to give him time to re∣treat, attacked him near Preston-pans, about twelve
miles from the capital, and, in a few minutes, put him and his troops totally
to the route. This vic∣tory, in which the King lost about five hundred men,
gave the rebels great influence; and, had the Pre∣tender taken advantage of the
general consternation, <PB N="177" REF="180"/> and marched towards England,
the consequence might have been dangerous to the safety of the state; but
he spent the time at Edinburgh, seeming to enjoy the useless parade of
royalty, pleased at being addressed and treated as a King. By this time
he was joined by the Earl of Kilmarnock, the Lords Elcho, Balmerino, Ogilvy,
Pitsligo, and the eldest son of the Lord Lovat. This Lord Lovat was the
same whom we have seen, upon a former occasion, trusted by the old
Pretender, and betraying him by taking possession of the castle of
Stirling for King George. This nobleman, true to neither party, had again
altered from his attachment to the house of Hanover, and, in secret, aided
the young Cheva∣lier; studious only for his own interest, he exerted all
the arts of low cunning, to appear an open enemy to the rebellion; yet to give
it secret assistance.</P>
<P>While the young Pretender thus trifled away the time at Edinburgh,
(for all delays in dangerous en∣terprizes are even worse than defeats) the
ministry of Great Britain took every possible measure to de∣feat his
intentions. Six thousand Dutch troops that had come over to the
assistance of the crown, were sent northward, under the command of
General Wade; but, as it was then said, these could lend no
assistance, as they were, properly speaking, prison∣ers of France,
and, upon their parole, not to oppose that power for the space of one year.
How∣ever this be, the Duke of Cumberland soon after arrived from Flanders,
and was followed by another detachment of dragoons and infantry; voluntiers in
different parts of the kingdom employed themselves
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the exercise of arms; and
every county exerted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> generous
spirit of indignation, both against the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbition, the religion, and the
allies of the young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dventurer.</P>
<P>It would be illiberal and base, to deny this enter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ising youth that praise which his
merit may deserve. <PB N="178" REF="181"/> Though he might have brought civil
war, and all the calamities attending it, with him, into the kingdom; yet we
must consider, that he had ever been taught that bathing his country in
blood was but a just as∣sertion of his right; that altering the
constitution and, perhaps, the religion of his supposed dominions was a
laudable object of ambition. Thus inspired he went forward with vigour, and
resolving to make an irruption into England, he entered it by the western
border, on the sixth day of November. Car¦lisle was invested, and, in
less than three days, it sur∣rendered. Here he found a considerable
quantity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> arms, and was declared
King of Great Britain. Ge¦neral Wade being apprized of his progress,
advance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> across the country from
the opposite shore; but, re¦ceiving intelligence that the enemy were two
day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> march before him, he retired
to his former station<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The young
Pretender now resolved to proceed, hav¦ing received assurances from
France that a consider¦able body of troops would be landed on the
souther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coast of Britain, to
make a diversion in his favour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and, flattered with the hopes of being joined by
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> large body of English
malecontents, as soon as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
should make his appearance among them. Leavin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore a small garrison in Carlisle, which he shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rather have left defenceless, he
advanced to Penrit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> marching on
foot in an Highland garb, and continue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his irruption till he came to Manchester, where h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> established his head quarters. He
was here joine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by about two
hundred English men, who were forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into a regiment, under the command of Colon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Townley. From hence he prosecuted his route t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Derby, intending to go by the way of
Chester int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wales, where he
hoped for a great number of adhe¦rents. He was, by this time, advanced within
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hundred miles of the capital,
which was filled wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> terror and
confusion. The King resolved to take th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> field in person. The voluntiers of the city were in¦corporated 
<PB N="179" REF="182"/> into a regiment. The practitioners of the law resolved
to take the field, with the judges at their head. Even the managers of the
theatres of∣fered to raise a body of their dependants for the ser∣vice of
their country. Yet these combinations only served as instances of the
national terror; for the trading part of the city, and those concerned in the
money corporations, were overwhelmed with dejec∣tion. They could hope for
little safety in the cou∣rage or discipline of a militia, especially as
they, every hour, dreaded an invasion from France, and an insurrection of
the Roman Catholics, and other friends to the expelled family. This therefore
was the moment for the advancement of the adventurer's enterprize. Had he
marched up to the capital, he would undoubtedly have been joined by several,
se∣cretly attached to his cause. But he determined to retreat once more to
Scotland; and thus his scheme was defeated. In fact, he was but nominally the
leader of his forces. His Generals, the chiefs of Highland Clans, were, from
their education, igno∣rant; and, from their independency, obstinate. They
each embraced peculiar systems, and began to con∣tend with each other for
the pre-eminence; so that after violent disputes, they resolved to march
back. They effected their retreat to Carlisle without any loss; and from
thence crossed the rivers Eden and Solway into Scotland. In this irruption,
however, they preserved all the rules of war; they desisted, in a great
measure, from rapine; levied contributions; and, in the usual form, left a
garrison at Carlisle in their retreat; which, a short time after, to the
num∣ber of four hundred, surrendered, to the Duke of Cumberland, prisoners
at discretion. The Pretender, being returned to Scotland, proceeded to
Glasgow; from which city he exacted severe contributions. Advancing to
Stirling, he was joined by Lord Lewis Gordon, at the head of some forces
which had been <PB N="180" REF="183"/> assembled in his absence. Other
Clans, to the num∣ber of two thousand, came in likewise; Spain sent him
some supplies of money; and, in one or two skirmishes with the
loyalists, his Generals came off with victory; so that his affairs once
more seemed to wear an aspect of success. Being joined by John Lord
Drummond, he invested the castle of Stirling, commanded by General
Blakeney; but his forces be∣ing unused to sieges, consumed much time to
no purpose. General Hawley, who commanded a con∣siderable body of forces
near Edinburgh, undertook to raise the siege. He advanced towards the rebel
army, and rendezvoused his whole force at Falkirk, while the rebels lay
incamped at no great distance. After two days, mutually examining each
other's strength, the rebels, on the seventeenth day of Janu∣ary, came on
in full spirits to attack the King's army. The Pretender, who stood in the
front line, gave the signal to fire; and the first volley served to put
Hawley's forces into confusion. The horse re∣treated with precipitation,
and fell in upon their own infantry; the rebels followed their blow; and the
greatest part of the royal army fled with the utmost precipitation. They
retired in confusion to Edin∣burgh, leaving the field of battle, with part of
their tents and artillery, to the rebels.</P>
<P>This was the end of all their triumphs. A new scene of conduct was
now going to open; for the Duke of Cumberland, at that time the favourite of
the English army, had put himself at the head of the troops at Edinburgh,
which consisted of about fourteen thousand men. He resolved therefore
to come to a battle as soon as possible; and marched forward, while the
young adventurer retired at his approach. The Duke advanced to Aberdeen, where
he was joined by the Duke of Gordon, and some other Lords, attached to his
family and cause. After having refreshed his troops here for some time,
he re∣newed <PB N="181" REF="184"/> his march; and, in twelve days, came upon
the banks of the deep and rapid river Spey. This was a place where the rebels
might have disputed his passage; but they seemed now totally void of
all counsel and subordination, without conduct, and without expectation.
The Duke still proceeded in his pursuit; and, at length, had advice that
the ene∣my had advanced from Inverness to the Plain of Culloden, which was
about nine miles distant, and there intended to give him battle. On this
Plain the Highlanders were drawn up in order of battle, to the number of eight
thousand men, in thirteen divisions, supplied with some pieces of
artillery. The battle began about one o'clock in the afternoon; the canon of
the King's army did dreadful execution among the enemy, while theirs, being but
ill served, was ineffectual. One of the great errors in all the Pre∣tender's
warlike measures, was his subjecting undis∣ciplined troops to the forms
of artful war, and thus repressing their native ferocity, from which alone
he could hope for success. After they had stood the English fire for
some time, they, at length, became impatient for closer engagement; and
about five hun∣dred of them attacked the English left wing, with their
accustomed fierceness. The first line being dis∣ordered by this
onset, two battalions advanced to support it, and galled the enemy by a
terrible and close discharge. At the same time the dragoons un∣der
Hawley, and the Argyleshire militia, pulling down a park wall that guarded
the enemy's flank, and which the rebels had left but feebly defended, fell in
among them, sword in hand, with great slaugh∣ter. In less than thirty
minutes they were totally routed, and the field covered with their wounded and
slain, to the number of above three thousand men. Civil war is in itself
terrible, but still more so when heightened by cruelty. How guilty soever
men may be, it is ever the business of a soldier to remember, 
<PB N="182" REF="185"/> that he is only to fight an enemy that opposes him,
and to spare the supplicant. This victory was in every respect complete;
and humanity to the con∣quered would even have made it glorious. The
con∣querors often refused mercy to wretches who were defenceless or
wounded; and soldiers were seen to anticipate the base employment of the
executioner.</P>
<P>Thus sunk all the hopes, and the ambition of the young adventurer;
one short hour deprived him of imaginary thrones and sceptres, and reduced
him from a nominal King to a distressed forlorn out-cast, shunned by
all mankind, except such as sought to take his life. To the good-natured,
subsequent dis∣tress often atones for former guilt; and while reason
would repress humanity, yet our hearts plead in the favour of the wretched.
The Duke, immediately after the decisive action at Culloden, ordered
six-and-thirty deserters to be executed; the conquerors spread terror
wherever they came; and, after a short time, the whole country round was one
scene of slaughter, desolation, and plunder; justice seemed
forgotten; and vengeance assumed the name.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the unhappy fugitive adventurer wandered from
mountain to mountain, a wretched spectator of all these horrors, the
result of his ill-guided ambition. He now underwent a similiarity of
adventures with Charles II, after the defeat at Worcester. He sometimes
found refuge in caves and cottages, without attendants, and exposed to the
mercy of peasants, who could pity but not support him. Sometimes he lay in
forests, with one or two companions of his distress, continually purfued
by the troops of the conquerors, as there was thirty thousand pounds bid for
his head. Sheridan, an Irish adventurer, was he who kept most faithfully by
him, and inspired him with courage to support such incre∣dible
hardships. He was obliged to trust his life to the fidelity of about fifty
individuals. One day, hav∣ing <PB N="183" REF="186"/> walked from morning till
night, pressed by hun∣ger, and worn with fatigue, he ventured to enter an
house, the owner of which he well knew was at∣tached to the opposite party:

<Q REND="inline"><HI>The son of your King,</HI> said he,
entering, <HI>comes to beg a bit of bread and cloaths. I know your present
attachment to my adversaries, but I be∣lieve you to have sufficient honour
not to abuse my confidence, or to take the advantage of my misfortunes. Take
these rags that have for some time been my only covering, and keep them.
You may, probably, restore them to me one day, when seated on the throne of
the Kings of Great Bri∣tain.</HI></Q> His host was touched with his
distress; assisted him as far as he was able, and never divulged his
secret. In this manner he wandered among the frightful wilds of Glengarry,
for near six months, often hemmed round by his pursuers, but still
find∣ing some expedient to save him from captivity and death. At length a
privateer of St. Malo, hired by his adherents, arrived in Lochnanach, on which
he embarked, and arrived at France in safety,</P>
<P>Many were the conjectures then, and they still subsist, as
to the possibility of the young adventurer's escape. Some were of opinion
that the government gave secret orders to the Generals to connive at it;
while others still firmly assert, that he was put to death in an
out-house, in which a number of the re∣bels were inclosed and burnt. Which
ever report be most true, certain it is, that the place of his re∣treat has
ever since been concealed from all the world.</P>
<P>While the Prince thus led a wandering and soli∣tary life, the
scaffolds and the gibbets were bathed with the blood of his adherents;
seventeen officers of the rebel army were executed at Kennington-Com∣mon, in
the neighbourhood of London, whose con∣stancy in death gained more
proselytes to their cause than perhaps their victories could have done.
Nine were executed in the same manner at Carlisle; six at 
<PB N="184" REF="187"/> Brumpton; seven at Penrith; and eleven at York A few
obtained pardons; and a considerable numbe were transported to the
Plantations. The Earls o Kilmarnock and Cromartie, with the Lord Balmerino were
tried by their Peers, and found guilty. Cro¦martie was pardoned; the other two
were beheaded on Tower-Hill. Kilmarnock, either from convic∣tion, or from the
hope of a pardon, owned his crime, and declared his repentance of it. On the
other hand, Balmerino, who had from his youth up, been bred to arms, died in a
more daring man∣ner. When his fellow sufferer, as commanded, bid God bless
King George, Balmerino still held fast to his principles, and cried out,
God bless King James, and suffered with the utmost intrepidity. Lord
Lovat, and Mr. Radcliff the titular Earl of Derwentwater, suffered the same
fate with equal resolution. Thus ended a rebellion, dictated by youth and
presumption, and conducted without art or resolution. The fa∣mily of
Stewart found fortune become more averse at every new solicitation of her
favours. Let pri∣vate men, who complain of the miseries of this life, only
turn to the vicissitudes in that family, and learn to bless God, and be
happy.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>A Rebellion quelled, and mercy shewn to the de∣linquents, ever
strengthens the reigning cause. How it might have been in the present
instance I will not pretend to determine; whether too much ri∣gour might have
been exerted upon the conquered, posterity must determine; actions of this
kind are too near our own times to be either judged of, or talked of with
freedom. Immediately after the re∣bellion <PB N="185" REF="188"/> was
suppressed, the legislature undertook to establish several
regulations in Scotland, which were equally conducive to the happiness of the
people there, and the tranquility of the united kingdom. The Highlanders, who
had, till this time, continued to wear the old military dress of the Romans,
and who always went armed, were now reformed. Their habits were, by act of
parliament, reduced to the modern modes; the obedience they were under to their
chiefs was abolished, and the lowest subject of that part of the kingdom
was granted a participation of British freedom.</P>
<P>But whatever tranquility might have been restored by these means
at home, the flames of war still con∣tinued to rage upon the continent with
its accustomed violence. The French went forward with rapid suc∣cess,
having reduced almost the whole Netherlands to their obedience. In vain the
Dutch negotiated, supplicated, and evaded war; they saw themselves
stripped of all those strong towns which defended their dominions from
invasion; and they now lay almost defenceless, ready to receive terms
from their conquerors. The Dutch, at this time, were very different from their
forefathers, the brave assertors of liberty, in the beginning of their
republic; the individuals of their state were rich, while the go∣vernment was
poor; they had lost, in a spirit of traffic and luxury, all generosity of
sentiment, and desire of independence; they only sought riches,
re∣gardless of public virtue. They were divided in their councils between two
factions which now subsisted, namely, that which declared for a
Stadtholder, and that which, with attachments to France, opposed his
election. The prevalence of either side was almost equally fatal to
liberty; if a Stadtholder was elected, they then saw their constitution
altered from a re∣public to a kind of limited monarchy; if the oppo∣site
party prevailed, they were to feel the weight of a <PB N="186" REF="189"/>
confirmed aristocracy, confirmed by French power, and crouching under its
authority. Of the two e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s they
chose the former; the people, in several to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, inflamed almost to tumult and sedition, compelled their
magistrates to declare for the Prince of Orange as Stadtholder,
Captain-general and Admiral of the United Provinces. The vigorous
consequences of this resolution immediately appeared; all commerce with the
French was prohibited; the Dutch army was augmented; and orders were issued
to commence hostilities against the French by sea and land.</P>
<P>Thus we see this war diffused throughout the whole system of
Europe, in some measure resembling a disorder, the symptoms of which,
at different times, appear in different parts of the body, remitting and raging
by turns. At the commencement of the war we have seen the Queen of Hungary
upon the point of losing all her possessions. Soon after we saw the
unfortunate Duke of Bavaria, who had been chosen Emperor by the name of
Charles VII, banished from his throne, stripped of his hereditary dukedom,
and ever shrinking from surrounding dangers. We have seen the Duke of
Savoy, now King of Sardinia, changing that side which some years before he
espoused, and, joining with Austria and England, against the ambitious
designs of France, while Italy still felt all the terrors of war, or rather
saw foreigners contending with each other for her domi∣nions; the French and
Spaniards on one side, the Imperialists and the King of Sardinia on the
other. Thus Rome, that once gave laws to the world, now saw the troops of
Germany and Spain, by turns, enter into her territories; and, after various
com∣bats, she, at last, saw the Imperialists become ma∣sters. The
Spaniards and French lost the most flou∣rishing armies, notwithstanding
the excellent con∣duct of the Prince of Conti their General; and, at last,
after a bloody victory obtained over the Spa∣niards <PB N="187" REF="190"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> St. Lazaro, the beautiful city
of Genoa, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d sided with
Spain, was obliged to submit to the conquerors, to suffer some
indignities imposed upon them, and to pay a most severe contribution.</P>
<P>The city of Genoa had, for ages before, main∣tained its own laws,
and boasted of liberty. Besides its inner wall, it had another formed by a
chain of rocks of more than two leagues extent; but both being built in those
times when modern fortification was yet unknown, it was not thought, by its
Senate, capable of making a proper resistance. Upon sub∣mitting, the
unhappy Italians too soon found that no mercy was to be expected from the
court of Vi∣enna, which had ever patronized oppression. More than a million
sterling was demanded for a contribu∣tion; a tax, the payment of which must
have utterly ruined the city. The magistrates did all in their power to pay
the exorbitant sum demanded; and the German troops exercised every
inhumanity in exact∣ing it. The conquerors lived upon the people, and treated
them with an insolence which was natural to them as conquerors, and as
Germans. The Genoese were, at length, reduced to despair, and were
resolved to make a last effort for the recovery of their liberty and
independence. The Austrians took the cannon of the city, in order to
transport them to Provence, where their arms had already penetrated. The
Ge∣noese themselves were obliged to draw those cannon which they had once
considered as the defence and ornament of their citadel. It was on this
occasion that an Austrian officer struck one of the citizens, who had
been employed in this laborious task. This blow served to animate the
people with their former spirit of freedom. They took up arms in every
quarter of the town, and surprized some battalions of the Austrians,
surrounded others, and cut them in pieces. The Senate, uncertain how to
proceed, nei∣ther encouraged nor stopped the citizens, who drove 
<PB N="188" REF="191"/> the Austrians intirely out, and then appointed
com∣manders, and guarded the walls with the utmost re∣gularity.</P>
<P>This revolution in a little city, the transactions of which has
filled whole Folios of history, should not be passed over without
remark; though no longer capable of maintaining its liberties amidst the
shock of the enormous powers of Europe; yet still we find it
possessed of its ancient spirit; only to lose it, how∣ever, by the
prevailing power of the Senate, which established their aristocracy on
the necks of the citi∣zens, as before.</P>
<P>In this manner we see victory and miscarriage mutually declaring
for either; all sides growing more feeble, and none acquiring any real
recompence for the losses sustained. Thus, about this time, the
English made an unsuccessful expedition into France, in order to attack
Port l'Orient, in which they came off without any honour. The French gained a
con∣siderable victory at Rocroux in Flanders, over the allies, although it
procured them no real advantage; and it cost them a greater number of lives
than those whom they obliged to retire. The Dutch, in this general conflict,
seemed the greatest losers. A vic∣tory gained over the allies at La Feldt
served to re∣duce them to a still greater degree of distrust in their
Generals, than they had hitherto shewn: but the taking of Bergen-op-Zoom, the
strongest fortification of Dutch Brabant, and which put the French in
possession of the whole navigation of the Schelde, threw them almost
into despair. But these victories, in favour of France, were
counterbalanced with al∣most equal disappointments. In Italy, the French
General, Marshal Bellisle's brother, at the head of thirty-four thousand
men, attempted to penetrate into Piedmont; but his troops were put to the
route, and he himself slain. The French King equipped an un∣successful
armament for the recovery of Cape Bre∣ton; <PB N="189" REF="192"/> and, not
discouraged by this failure, fitted out two squadrons, one to make a
descent upon the Bri∣tish Colonies in America, and the other to
assist the operations in the East Indies. These, however, were
attacked by Anson and Warren, and nine of their ships were taken. Soon
after this Commodore Fox, with six ships of war, took above forty French
ships laden from St. Domingo; and this loss was soon after followed by
another defeat, which the French fleet sustained from Admiral Hawke, in
which seven ships of the line, and several frigates, were taken.</P>
<P>This variety of success served to make all the powers at war
heartily desirous of a peace. The States-General had, for some years,
endeavoured to stop the progress of a war, in which they could gain no
advantages, and had all to lose. The King of France was sensible, that,
after a victory, was the most advantageous opportunity of proposing terms
of peace; and even expressed his desire of general tran∣quility, in a
personal conversation with Sir John Li∣gonier, who had been made prisoner
in the last victory obtained by the French at La Feldt. The bad suc∣cess
of his admirals at sea, his Generals misfortunes in Italy, the frequent
bankruptcies of his subjects, the election of a Stadtholder in Holland, who
opposed his interests, his views in Germany intirely frustrated by the
elevation of the Duke of Tuscany to rule the Empire; all these contributed
to make him weary of the war. An accommodation was therefore agreed upon; and
the contending powers agreed to a con∣gress at Aix la Chapelle, where the
Earl of Sand∣wich and Sir Thomas Robinson assisted as
plenipo∣tentiaries from the King of Great Britain. The treaty which takes its
name from that city, was con∣cluded on the seventh day of October, a
lasting in∣stance of precipitate counsels and English humility. By this
it was agreed, that all prisoners, on each
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide, should be mutually
restored, and all conquests <PB N="190" REF="193"/> given up. That the
Duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla, should be ceded to Don Philip,
heir apparent to the Spanish throne, and his heirs; but in case of his
succeeding to the crown of Spain, that then these dominions should revert
to the house of Austria. That the fortifications of Dunkirk to the sea
should be demolished; that the ship annually sent with slaves to the
coast of Spain, should have this privilege continued for four years; that
the King o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prussia should be
secured in the possession of Silesia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which he had conquered; and that the Queen o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hungary should be secured in her
patrimonial domi¦nions. But one article of the peace was more dis¦pleasing
and afflictive to the English than all the rest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for it was agreed, that she should
give two person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of rank and

the enemy, either in the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> or

<P>THIS peace might, in every respect, be termed only a temporary
cessation from general hosti∣lities; though the war between England and
France had actually subsided in Europe, yet in the East and West-Indies
they still carried on hostile operations, both sides equally culpable,
yet each complaining of the infraction.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as Europe enjoyed a temporary tranquility, the
people of England expected, and the government promised them, a restitution
of those blessings which had been taken from them by a long and
obstinate war. A magnificent firework was played off upon this occasion;
which, though an use∣less and vain expence, served to amuse the
populace, and render them more contented with the late pre∣carious treaty.</P>
<P>The ministry also shewed some desire to promote the
commerce of the kingdom; and, for this pur∣pose, a bill was passed for
encouraging a British her∣ring fishery, under proper regulations. From
such a scheme carried into execution, great advantages were expected to
accrue; the Dutch, who had long en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyed the sole profits arising from it, considered the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea as a mine of inexhaustible
wealth. However, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xperience has
shewn that the English were either
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncapable of turning this fishery
to the same ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antage, or that
their company was not established
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith the most strict oeconomy.
Private persons have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ften been
found to make fortunes by this fishery; <PB N="192" REF="195"/> but the
company have found themselves considerabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> losers.</P>
<P>A scheme, which, by many, was thought still mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> advantageous to the nation, was, the
encouragin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those who had been
discharged the army or navy, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
become members of a new colony in North America<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> called Nova Scotia. To this retreat, it was thought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the waste of an exuberant nation
might well be drain¦ed off; and here those free spirits might be kep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> employed, who, if suffered to remain
at home, would only prey upon the community. This was a cold climate, and a
barren soil, where the English had a fort, and a small garrison, rather
to intimidate the neighbouring French, and repress their incroach∣ments, than
to derive any advantages from the im∣provement of trade, or the cultivation of
the coun∣try. It was here that a scheme was laid for the foundation of a new
colony, which might improve the fishery upon that coast, and become a new
source of wealth to the mother country. Thus did the nation exchange her
hardy and veteran troops for the expectation of precarious wealth. Every colony
taken from the parent country serves to lessen its strength; and all
the wealth imported into it, after it has be∣come moderately rich, being only
used as the instru∣ment of luxury, instead of invigorating the nation,
tends to render it more effeminate.</P>
<P>However, it was advertised by authority, that all proper
encouragement would be given to such officers and private men, who, being
discharged from the service of the government, should be willing to
set∣tle in Nova Scotia. Fifty acres of land were granted to every private
soldier or seaman, free from taxes for ten years, and then to pay only one
shilling a year. Besides this fifty, ten acres more were to be granted to
every individual of which each family should consist. Every officer,
under the rank of en∣sign, was to have fourscore acres; ensigns were to 
<PB N="193" REF="196"/> have two hundred, lieutenants three, captains four, and
those above that rank six. Such offers failed not to induce numbers to try
their fortunes on that desolate coast; and, in a little time, about four
thou∣sand adventurers, with their families, were carried thither; a town
named Halifax was built; and the colonists left to glean a scanty
subsistance from an ungrateful soil. Since that time, notwithstanding
all the encouragement this colony has received from the government, the
inhabitants have cleared but a very small part of the woods with which the
face of the country is covered. Agriculture is quite forsaken; and the
settlement intirely subsists by the sums ex∣pended by the army and
navy stationed in this part of the western world.</P>
<P>Here those voluntary out-casts of their country expected to
live, though hardly, yet at least securely; but, in this they found
themselves disappointed. The Indians, a savage and fierce people, from
the first looked upon these settlements of the English as an
in∣croachment upon their own liberties; and the French, who were equally
jealous, fomented these outrages. Commissaries were therefore appointed
to meet at Paris, and compromise these disputes; but these con∣ferences
were rendered abortive by mutual cavillings, and all the arts of evasion.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Pelham, who chiefly con∣ducted the business
of the state, and was esteemed a man of candour and capacity, laid a
scheme for lightening the immense load of debt that was laid upon the
nation. His plan was to lessen the national incumbrance, by lowering the
interest which had been promised upon the first raising the supply,
or obliging the lenders to receive the sums originally granted. Those who
were proprietors of stocks, and received, for the use of their money, four
<HI>per cent.,</HI> were, by royal authority, ordered to subscribe their
names, sig∣nifying their consent to accept of three pounds ten 
<PB N="194" REF="197"/> shillings <HI>per cent.</HI> a year after, and three
<HI>per cent.</HI> onl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about six
years after their thus subscribing; and, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> case of a refusal, that the government would pay o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the principal. This scheme was
attended with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desired effect;
though it, in some measure, was
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> force upon the lender, who had
originally grante<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his money upon
different terms, yet it was salutar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the nation; and, as Machiavel has it, politic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> injustice is sometimes allowable,
in order to secur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> national
benefits. Besides this salutary measure, other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were pursued by the minister at the helm, with
equa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> success. The importation
of iron from America wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> allowed,
and the trade to Africa laid open to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whole nation; but, at the same time, to be super¦intended by
the board of trade and plantations.</P>
<P>But all the advantages the nation reaped from these salutary
measures, were not sufficient to counter-balance the stroke which liberty
received (as some are of opinion) by an unusual stretch of the privileges
of the house of commons. As this is a point which deserves the
strictest attention, permit me to trace it up to the source. The city of
Westminster had long been represented by members who were nominated, in
some measure, by the ministry; Lord Trentham having vacated his seat in
the house, by accepting a place under the crown, he again declared himself
a candidate; but met with violent opposition. It was objected to him by
some, that he had been uncom∣monly active in introducing some French
strollers, who had come over to exhibit plays upon the sup∣pression of
our own. This accusation, whether true or false, excited numbers against
him, who styled themselves the <HI>independent electors of
Westminster,</HI> and named Sir George Vandeput, a private gentleman, as
his competitor. The opposition resolved to sup∣port their candidate at
their own expence. They accordingly opened houses of entertainment,
solicited votes, and propagated abuse as usual. At length, 
<PB N="195" REF="198"/> the poll being closed, the majority appeared in favour
of Lord Trentham; a scrutiny was demanded by the other side; it was
protracted by the obstinacy of both parties; but this also turning out in
favour of Lord Trentham, the independent electors petitioned the house,
complaining of an undue election, and of partiality and injustice in the
high-bailiff of West∣minster, who took the poll. To this petition the
house paid little regard, but proceeded to examine the high-bailiff as to the
causes that had so long pro∣tracted the election; who laid the blame upon
Mr. Crowle, who had acted as council for the petitioners, on the honourable
Alexander Murray, and one Gib∣son an upholsterer. These three persons
were there∣fore brought to the bar of the house; Crowle and Gibson, after
having asked pardon upon their knees, and, being reprimanded by the house,
were dismissed. Murray was first admitted to bail; but, after some
witnesses had deposed, that he had headed a mob to intimidate the voters,
it was voted that he should be committed a close prisoner to Newgate;
and, to in∣vigorate their measures, that he should receive this sentence
at the bar of the house on his knees. He accordingly appeared; but being
directed by the Speaker to kneel, refused to comply. This refusal threw the
whole house into a commotion; and it was ordered that he should be
committed close pri∣soner to Newgate, debarred the use of pen, ink, and
paper, and that no person should have access to him without
permission from the house. This imprison∣ment he underwent,
sensible that it could continue no longer than while they continued to
sit; and, at the close of the session, he was conducted from
pri∣son to his own house, amidst the acclamations of the people. He now
was thought, by many, intirely free from all farther prosecution; but, in
this, they were mistaken; for, at the opening of the ensuing sitting of
parliament, a motion was made, that Mr. <PB N="196" REF="199"/> Murray should
be again committed close prisoner to the Tower. Hitherto it was
supposed by several, that the house of commons had acted with a
spirit of resentment. Now it was thought, that they made an attempt at
extending their privileges. Though the delinquent, a person of no great
consequence in himself, had taken the prudent precautions of re∣tiring from
their resentment, yet several of the people saw that the house
considered itself rather as a body distinct from the people, than the
guardians of the people; and, instead of maintaining the liber∣ties of the
subject in general, attempted to increase their own. Some thought they
saw, in this mea∣sure, the seeds of future aristocracy; that the
house of commons constituted themselves judges of their own privileges;
and that the liberty of every indi∣vidual in society was at the disposal
of a body who professed acting chiefly for their own honour.</P>
<P>However this may be, another measure was soon after taken,
which, in reality, made distinctions among the people, and laid an
unpassable line be∣tween the rich and poor. This was an act for the better
preventing clandestine marriages, and for the more public solemnization of
that ceremony. The grievance complained of, and which this law was to
redress, was, that the sons and daughters of opulent families were often
seduced into marriage, before they had acquired sufficient experience in
life to be sensible of the disparity of fortune in the match. This
statute therefore enacted, that the bans of mar∣riage should be regularly
published three successive Sundays in the church of the parish where
both par∣ties had resided for one month at least, before the ceremony. That
a marriage which was solemnized without this previous publication, or a
license ob∣tained from the Bishop's Court, should be void, and the
person who solemnized it should be transported for seven years. This
act was, at that time, thought <PB N="197" REF="200"/> replete with
consequences injurious to society; and experience has manifested some
of them; villains have gone about deceiving ignorant women, under a pretence of
marriage, and then have left them without redress. The poor were thus
rendered ut∣terly incapable of making alliances with the rich; and the wealth
of the nation has thus been more li∣able to accumulation in opulent families.
It has been thought to impede that ardour which impels many to marry; and to
clog a ceremony of the most infinite advantage to society, with
procrastination and delay. Some have affirmed, that debaucheries and
lewdness have become more frequent since the enact∣ing this law; and it is
believed, that the numbers of the people are upon the decline.</P>
<P>This session of parliament was also distinguished by
another act equally unpopular, and, perhaps, equally injurious to the religion
of the community. This was a law for naturalizing the Jews. The ministers
boldly affirmed, that such a law would greatly contribute to the advantage of
the nation; that it would increase the credit and commerce of the kingdom,
and set a laudable example of political toleration. Many others, however,
were of very different sentiments; they saw that greater favour was
shewn, by this bill, to Jews, than to some other sects professing the
Christian religion; that an intro∣duction of this people into the kingdom
would dis∣grace the character of the nation, and cool the zeal of the natives
already too lukewarm. However, not∣withstanding all opposition, this bill
was passed into a law; nor was it till the ensuing session of
parlia∣ment, that it was thought necessary to be repealed.</P>
<P>An act, equally unpopular with the two former, was now also
passed, which contained regulations for the better preserving the game.
By this none but men already possessed of a stated fortune, had a
pri∣vilege of carrying a gun, or destroying game, though 
<PB N="198" REF="201"/> even upon the grounds which he himself rented. This
totally damped all that martial spirit among the lower orders of mankind, by
preventing their hand∣ling those arms which might one day be necessary to
defend their country; and gave the rich the sole in∣joyment of a pleasure,
which, before, had been con∣sidered as the common privilege of humanity. Such
were the laws passed this session; through all which a spirit of
aristocracy was discerned by some. The body of the rich no longer fearing
oppression from the throne, or an infringement of their own liberties, now
began to lean heavy upon the poor, and to con∣sider the interests of that
useful part of society, as in∣tirely distinct from their own. They never
omitted, however, the usual addresses to the throne; and this
session was remarkable for an address of thanks to his Majesty for
maintaining, and rendering perma∣nent, the general tranquility of Europe, at a
time when war was kindling in almost every quarter of the world.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXV.</HEAD>
<P>IF we seek for the origin of that war which now threatened
universal devastation, we shall find it kindling up in several
countries, both of Europe, America, and Asia, at one and the same time.
Most other national contests have arisen from some one principal
cause; but this war seems to have been pro∣duced by the concurrence of
several, or it may be considered as the continuance of the late war, which
had not been effectually extinguished by the defective treaty of Aix la
Chapelle.</P>
<P>In Asia, upon the coast of Malabar, the English and French had
never ceased hostilities. The claim <PB N="199" REF="202"/> of Prussia
and Austria, upon the territories of Silesia, had never been thoroughly
adjusted. The limits of Nova Scotia, inhabited by the English, and bordered
upon by the French, were never precisely determin∣ed; and, southward, the
boundaries of Acadia, an extended country belonging to the French, and
bor∣dering upon Virginia, were equally left uncertain. Negotiations had long
been carried on to determine these differences; but what could reason do in
deter∣mining disputes in which there were no certain prin∣ciples to be guided
by? The limits of these countries had never been settled; for they were,
before this time, thought too remote, or too insignificant, to employ much
attention. And it was not probable that powers who had no other right to the
countries in dispute, but that of invasion, would have equity enough to
agree upon sharing the spoil.</P>
<P>The right which any of the contending powers pretended to, might, in
the eye of reason, be thought very controvertible; but the convenience which
either party was to derive from the enjoyment of their pecu∣liar claims was not
so uncertain. As the dissensions seemed to begin in North America, we
must turn to that country to consider their rise. The French had been the
first cultivators of Nova Scotia, and, by great industry and long
perseverance, rendered the soil, na∣turally barren, somewhat fertile, and
capable of su∣staining nature with very little assistance from
Europe. This country, however, had frequently changed ma∣sters, until the
English were acknowledged as the rightful possessors by the treaty of
Utrecht. The possession of this country, in any other nation, would
expose our colonies to perpetual invasion, and assist them in
acquiring a superiority in commerce, and the northern fisheries. It has
been already ob∣served, that we had an infant colony upon that coast, which
was chiefly supported by royal bounty, and struggled with all the
disadvantages of the severe cli∣mate, <PB N="200" REF="203"/> and the
ungrateful soil. But it had an ob¦struction to its growth still more
formidable than ei∣ther. The French, who had been long settled in the back
parts of the country, continually spirited up the Indians to repel the new
comers; so that some of them were actually murdered, or sold to the
French at Louisburg. These violations were complained of, and complaint
produced recrimination; so that the two powers of France and England were
negotiating with, accusing, and destroying each other all at one time.</P>
<P>Now also began to be observed another source of dispute,
which promised as much uneasiness as the former. The French, pretending
first to have dis∣covered the mouth of the river Mississippi,
claimed the whole adjacent country towards New Mexico on the east, quite to
the Apalachian Mountains on the west. And finding several Englishmen, who
had settled be∣yond these mountains, both from motives of com∣merce, and
invited by the natural beauties of the country, they drove them away, and built
such forts as could command the whole country around. It was now, therefore,
seen, that their intentions were to surround the English colonies which
lay along the shore, by taking possession of the internal parts of
the country that lay on the back of our settlements; and being already
possessed of the northern and southern shores, thus inclose to us
on every side, and secure to themselves all trade with the natives of the
country. The English therefore justly apprehended, that if the French were
able to unite their northern colonies, which were traded into by the river St.
Lawrence, to their southern, which were accessible by the river
Mississippi, they must, in time, become mas∣ters of the whole
territory; and, by having a wide country to increase in, would soon
multiply, and be∣come every year more dangerous.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="204"/> The government of England having long
com∣plained of these incroachments, determined, at length, to repel force by
force, and to cut the knot of nego∣tiation, which they could not untie. Orders
were dispatched to the governors of the provinces to unite into a confederacy
for their mutual security; and, if possible, to bring the Indians over to
their cause. The Indians were a fierce savage people, unacquaint∣ed with
the arts, but from infancy trained to the practice of war. It had long been the
method of the English to cultivate their friendship in times of danger, but
to slight their alliance in circumstances of tranquility; this, in some
measure, served to alie∣nate their affections from our government; but the
fraud and avarice of our merchants, particularly that called the <HI>Ohio
company,</HI> who sold them bad merchan∣dizes, and treated them with equal
insolence and perfidy, served to confirm their aversion. Besides, there
was something in the disposition of the French settlers in these
regions more similar to theirs; the French, like the natives, were hardy,
enterprising, and poor; they naturally therefore joined with those al∣lies,
from conquering of whom they could expect no plunder; and declared against
the English colonists, who were rich, frugal, and laborious, and whose
spoils they consequently were the more desirous to share.</P>
<P>Thus then the English had not only the French, but almost the
whole body of the Indian nations to oppose; yet this confederacy against
them did not give a greater union to the different provinces, whose
in∣terest it was to oppose. Some of the provinces, who, from their
situation, had little to fear from the enemy, or little advantages to expect
from victory, declined furnishing their share of the supplies, the
governors of some other colonies, who had been men of broken fortunes, and
had come from their native country to retrieve them by acts of rapacity and
oppression <PB N="202" REF="205"/> here, were so much dreaded, or hated,
that they lost all influence in inspiring the colonists with a proper
spirit of defence. The ministry, however, at home, began to exert itself
for their defence, and their mea∣sures were hastened by hostilities
already commenced, there having been, for some time, a skirmishing
be∣tween General Lawrence to the north, and Colonel Washington to the
south, with parties of the French, in which the latter were victorious. It
would be tedious, as well as uninforming, to relate all the preparations that
now began to be made by either party; or to load this account with barbarous
names and unimportant marches; or to recount the alter∣nate victories and
defeats of either side; be it suffi∣cient to observe, that they seemed,
in some measure, to have imbibed the ferocity of manners of the sa∣vage
people, with whom they fought, and exercised various cruelties, either from a
spirit of reprisal or revenge.</P>
<P>Four operations were undertaken by the English at the same time;
one commanded by Colonel Monck∣ton, to drive the French from the incroachments
they had made upon the province of Nova Scotia; ano∣ther to the south,
against Crown Point, under the command of General Johnson; a third
commanded by General Shirley, against Niagara; and a fourth, still farther
to the south, against Du Quesne, under the conduct of General Braddock.
In these respec∣tive expeditions Monckton was successful; Johnson
victorious, though without effect; Shirley was thought dilatory, and his
expedition deferred to another sea∣son! but the fortunes of Braddock are
so extraordi∣nary as to require a more ample detail. This Ge∣neral was
recommended to this service by the Duke of Cumberland, who was justly
sensible of his cou∣rage, and knowledge in the art of war. These two
advantages, however, which, upon other occa∣sions, are thought the highest
requisites of a Ge∣neral <PB N="203" REF="206"/> were, in some measure,
conducive to this com∣mander's overthrow. His courage made him obsti∣nate;
and his skill in war was improper to be ex∣erted in a country where there
were no regular ad∣vances to be made, nor a marshalled enemy to en∣counter.
This brave but unfortunate man set for∣ward upon the expedition in June, and
left Fort Cumberland on the tenth, at the head of two thou∣sand two hundred
men, directing his march to that part of the country where General Washington
had been defeated the year before. Upon his arrival there he was informed, that
the French at fort Du Quesne expected a reinforcement of five hundred men; he
therefore resolved, with all haste, to advance, and attack them, before
they became too powerful by this assistance. Leaving, therefore, Colonel
Dun∣bar, with eight hundred men, to bring up the provi∣sions, stores, and
heavy baggage, as fast as the nature of the service would permit, he
marched forward with the rest of his army through a country equally
dan∣gerous from its forests and savage inhabitants; a country where
Europeans had never before attempted to penetrate, wild, solitary, and
hideous. Still, how∣ever, he went forward with intrepidity, through the
desarts of Oswego, regardless of the enemy's attempts, taking no care
previously to explore the woods or thickets, as if the nearer he approached
the enemy, the less regardless he was of danger. At length, on the eighth
of July, he encamped within ten miles of the fort Du Quesne, which he
intended to attack, and the next day resumed his march, without so much as
endeavouring to get intelligence of an enemy he de∣spised. With this
confidence he was marching forward; his soldiers promised themselves a
speedy cessation from their harrassing march, and all things seemed
to promise success, when the whole army was at once astonished by a
general discharge of arms, from an unseen ene∣my, <PB N="204" REF="207"/>
along the front and left flank. It was now too late to think of retreating; his
whole body had passed into the defile, which the enemy had artfully
permit∣ted before they attempted to fire. His van guard therefore fell back, in
consternation, upon the main body; and the pannic soon became general. The
officers alone disdained to fly, while Braddock himself, at their head,
discovered the greatest intrepidity, and the highest imprudence; he never
thought of retreat∣ing, but obstinately continued on the spot where he was,
and gave orders to the few brave men who sur∣rounded him, to form according
to the rules of war, and regularly advance against the enemy. An
en∣thusiast to the discipline of the field, he desired to bring the
spirit of a German campaign into the wilds of Niagara. In the mean time, his
officers fell thick about him, while he still continued to issue out
or∣ders with composure, though he had five horses shot under him, and
though the whole body of his troops was fled. At length he received a
musket-shot through the lungs, he dropped, and a total confusion
ensued. All the artillery, ammunition, and baggage, of the army, were left to
the enemy; the General's cabinet of letters also shared the same fate;
and the loss of the English, in this unhappy surprize, amount∣ed to
seven hundred men; and the remainder of the army, some time after, returned
to Philadelphia. It was in this manner the expedition of General Brad∣dock
terminated; from which England had expected such advantages. In all actions,
that excite the ap∣plause and admiration of mankind, a part of their
suc∣cess is owing to conduct, and a part to fortune. Of the latter Braddock
was totally forsaken; he was unsuccessful; and the ungrateful world are
unwilling to grant him the former.</P>
<P>Thus unfortunate were the beginnings of this war, with regard to
England; it was resolved therefore, that no measures were now to be
preserved with the <PB N="205" REF="208"/> French; and orders were given to
take their ships wherever found, though there was yet no formal de∣claration
of war. With this order the naval com∣manders very readily and willingly
complied, so that soon the English ports were filled with ships taken
from the enemy, and kept as an indemnification for these forts which the
enemy had unjustly possessed themselves of in America. The French
complained loudly against the injustice of this proceeding; they
represented it to the rest of Europe, as a breach of that faith which
should be observed among nations, as a piratical measure, disgraceful
to the most savage nation. Their memorials were answered by the
English, with some shew of reason. However, it must be owned, that as
a declaration of war was a ceremony easily performed, it would have been more
consistent with the honour of the ministry, to have pursued the usual
methods of contest which had been long established in Europe. The truth
is, that the ministry were now divided between peace and war; they saw the
necessity of vigorous measures, but they were afraid to throw off the
mask of peace intirely. Henry Pelham, who had long guided at the helm of
affairs with candour and capacity, had for some time been dead, and his place
supplied by Sir Thomas Robinson, who, though a sensible minister, and
a favourite of the King, was of no great weight in council, and,
consequently, soon under a necessity of resigning; and Mr. Fox was
put in his place. The administration was also new formed, in other
respects, by the taking in several other new mem∣bers. Those who had long
been in the ministry, were, it is thought, for peace; those, on the
contrary, who were newly taken into the direction of affairs, ex∣pected to
supplant their rivals by an opposite system, and were consequently
for war. The leader of this party, therefore, warmly solicited for war,
seconded by the justice of the cause, and the general voice of 
<PB N="206" REF="209"/> the people, those who opposed him expected to effect
by negotiation whatever arms could atchieve. Whatever might have been the
motives for protract∣ing the declaration, the French seemed to convince
Europe of their moderation upon this attack by sea, by neither declaring war,
nor making any reprisals by sea. However, they threatened England with a
formidable invasion; several bodies of troops moved to the coasts
adjacent to ours; their ministers threat∣ened loudly in foreign courts; and
such preparations were made as shewed a resolution of carrying the war
into the heart of Great Britain. These prepa∣rations had the desired
effect, filling the nation with consternation, turbulence, and clamour. The
people saw themselves exposed without arms, leaders, or dis∣cipline,
while the ministry were timid, unpopular, and wavering. In this situation
the Dutch were applied to for six thousand men, which, by treaty, they were
to send England, in case of its being threatened with an invasion. Which
demand, how∣ever, by affected delays, was put off so long, that the King,
unwilling to come to an open rupture with the republic, desisted from it;
for which they return∣ed his Majesty thanks. Such are the advantages England
is to expect, by relying on assistance from any other quarter than its
native strength and una∣nimity; and every day seems to convince us of the
absurdity of political alliances, which are never ob∣served, as wanting
friendship to bind, or force to compel.</P>
<P>In this timid situation the ministry were eager to catch at any
assistance; a body therefore of Hessians and Hanoverians, amounting
to about ten thousand, were brought over to protect about as many millions of
Englishmen, who, with swords in their hands, were able to defend
themselves; but such was the vile complexion of this period, that the whole
king∣dom presented nothing but one picture of discontent, 
<PB N="207" REF="210"/> terror, and distrust of their leaders. The
ministry was execrated for having reduced the nation to such
circumstances of disgrace, as to be thought to stand in need of
preservation from a few German merce∣naries; but what could be expected from
such a mi∣nistry, who were possessed neither of the arts, nor the
integrity of government.</P>
<P>However, the French were by no means serious in this intended
descent; the only design was to draw off the attention of the English
ministry from an ex∣pedition which was actually going forward against
Minorca, an island in the Mediterranean, which we had formerly taken from
Spain, and had been secured to us by repeated treaties. But the ministry of
Eng∣land were too much infected with the more domestic terror, to take
sufficient precautions to guard this place, though they had early notice of
the enemies intentions. Instead therefore of sufficiently guard∣ing the
island with a proper garrison in St. Philip's castle, the citadel, or of
detaching a squadron that, in all respects, should be superior to the
French fleet in the Mediterranean, they only sent ten men of war upon this
service, poorly manned, and indifferently provided, under the command of
Admiral Byng, whose character in the navy was by no means established,
and orders to reinforce the garrison of St. Philip's with one battalion from
Gibraltar; with which command, however, the governor of that place thought it
un∣safe to comply.</P>
<P>The Admiral sent upon this service reinforced his fleet by a
detachment of men at Gibraltar; and, sail∣ing towards Minorca, was joined in
the way by ano∣ther man of war, from whom he learned that Minorca was actually
besieged, and the French fleet destined to support the operations by
land. He soon knew the reality of this information, when, approaching the
island, he saw the French banners displayed, and the batteries opened
upon the castle of St. Philip's, <PB N="208" REF="211"/> which still
displayed the English flag. The appear∣ance of the French fleet, soon
after, still more strong∣ly engaged his attention; he drew up his ships
in line of battle, and determined to act upon the de∣fensive. Byng had been
formerly thought to be emi∣nent in naval operations, to which he was early
bred, but he had hitherto exhibited no proofs of courage. Men are generally
most apt to pride themselves upon those talents for which they are most
praised; and this was the case with this unfortunate commander; he
sacrificed his reputation for courage, to the hopes of being applauded for
his conduct. The French fleet advanced; a part of the English fleet engaged;
the Admiral still kept aloof, giving prudent reasons for his
remissness in coming to action; till, at length, the French Admiral,
taking the advantage of the Englishman's hesitation, sailed slowly away
to join the van of his fleet, which had been already discomfited. The
English, for a while, continued the pursuit; but the opportunity of coming
to a close engage∣ment was now lost, and never presented itself
again.</P>
<P>Byng was still resolved to act with his usual cau∣tion; he
called a council of war, wherein it was re∣presented that he was much
inferior to the enemy in ships and men; that the relief of Minorca was
im∣practicable; and that it was most adviseable to sail back to
Gibraltar, which might require immediate protection. This representation was
almost unani∣mously agreed to, and put accordingly in execution. His
pusillanimous conduct, however, soon reached his native country, where it
excited almost a phrenzy of resentment. The ministry were also thought
to fan the flame, which served to turn the public eye from their own
misconduct in sending so weak an armament. Byng, in the mean time,
remained at Gibraltar, no way suspecting the storm that was ga∣thering
over his head; but talked, and wrote, even as if he expected the thanks of his
King, and the <PB N="209" REF="212"/> applause of his countrymen; but he was
soon awaked from this dream of infatuation, by a letter from the ministry,
giving him notice, that he was recalled; and another soon after, by which
directions were given that he should be sent home under arrest; and, upon
his arrival in England, he was committed close prisoner in Greenwich
hospital. Numberless arts were used to inflame the populace against
this unhappy man; and, long before his tryal, several addresses were
sent up, from different counties, crying out for justice against the
delinquent. The industry of his friends, however, was not remiss upon this
occasion; they expostulated with the multitude, and attempted to divert the
whole of universal hatred upon the mi∣nistry, who, at worst, only
deserved a share. But, soon after the news of the surrender of fort St.
Phi∣lip to the French inflamed the people beyond all mea∣sure. This
fortress had been reckoned, next to Gi∣braltar, the strongest in Europe,
the works having been planned by the celebrated Vauban; and, both from the
nature of the soil, which was one solid rock, and the peculiarity of the
situation, it was thought al∣most impregnable. In order to make
themselves ma∣sters of this important fortress; the French, under the
command of the Duke de Richelieu, had landed near twenty thousand men, which,
by continual assault, and having, at length, gained an outwork, made
themselves masters of the place. The English gover∣nor, General Blakeney,
however, had very honour∣able terms of capitulation, and marched out with all
the ensigns of war. Yet, perhaps, in truth, the harder the conditions a
garrison is obliged to accept, the more honourable to the commander, as they
de∣note his extremity in being reduced to accept of them.</P>
<P>The English now saw themselves every-where de∣feated; in
America their armies were cut in pieces; in Europe their garrisons taken, the
people trembling <PB N="210" REF="213"/> under the dread of an invasion, a few
mercenarie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brought in for their
defence, who, in turn, becam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
formidable to the natives; all these circumstance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concurred to exasperate the people; but there was
n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> object on whom to wreck their
vengeance, but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unhappy Byng,
who, in a manner, was already de∣voted to destruction. War was now proclaimed
wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the usual solemnity,
though it was now but a denun¦ciation after having struck the blow. The
Hanove¦rians were sent back to their own country, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> preparations were made for trying Admiral Byng i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the usual form. On the twenty-eighth
day of De∣cember his tryal began before a Court-Martial, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the harbour of Portsmouth, where, after a scrutiny
of several days, his Judges came to a resolution, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had not done his utmost, during the engagement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to destroy the enemy, which it was
his duty to hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> engaged. They
therefore unanimously were of opi¦nion, that he fell under the twelfth
article of war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which positively
ordered death to any person, who in the time of action should withdraw,
keep back<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or not come into fight,
or who should not do his ut∣most, through either motives of cowardice,
negli∣gence, or disaffection. He was therefore adjudge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be shot on board such ship as the Lords of
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Admiralty should please to
direct; but his Judges, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the
same time, recommended him to mercy; as they could not tell the motives of
his keeping aloof. By such a sentence they expected to have satisfied the
national animosity against him, and yet to screen themselves from the
consciousness of severity. What∣ever the government might wish to do
is uncertain; but the cry of vengeance was too loud to be disre∣garded! his
Majesty therefore referred the sentence to the twelve Judges, who were
unanimously of opi∣nion that the sentence was legal; wherefore the King
resolved that he should suffer the extremity of the law. Still, however,
there was another attempt made <PB N="211" REF="214"/> to save him: One of
those who had been his Judges at Portsmouth, and was also a member of the
house of commons, informed that assembly, that he, as well as some
others who had sat upon the Admiral's tryal, desired to be released from
the oath of secrecy im∣posed upon Courts-Martial, that they might
disclose the grounds on which sentence of death had passed upon
Admiral Byng, and, perhaps, discover such cir∣cumstances as might shew
the sentence to be impro∣per. To this the house paid little regard; but his
Majesty thought fit to respite the execution, till the scruples of the
Court-Martial should be more clearly explained. A bill therefore past the
house of com∣mons for releasing them from their oath; but when it came to
be debated among the Lords, and after the members of the Court-Martial were
examined touch∣ing their reasons, the Peers found no reason for
pass∣ing the bill; and it was rejected. The Admiral be∣ing thus abandoned
to the stroke of justice, resolved at least, by the bravery of his
dying, in some mea∣sure, to shew the injustice of the imputation of his
being a coward. He maintained to the last his na∣tural serenity; and, on
the day fixed for his execu∣tion, when the boats belonging to the fleet, being
manned and armed, attended this solemnity in the harbour, the Admiral
advanced from the cabbin, where he had been imprisoned, to the deck, the
place appointed for execution, with a composed step, and resolute
countenance. He then delivered a paper, containing the following address: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>A few moments will now deliver me from virulent
persecution, and fru∣strate the malice of my enemies. Nor need I envy them
a life subject to the sensations my injuries, and the injustice done

reputation hereafter. The manner and cause of raising and keeping up the

words, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came forward, and

judgment only, it might have deen a proper cause for his dismission;
but it would have been cruelty to condemn him for it. Those

seem, however, at present, to bring their arguments from the necessity
there was of making some one commander an example to give greater
resolution to the rest, and from the good effects that seemed to at∣tend
his execution, by our repeated successes after it. These, however, are
such reasons as may silence, but not satisfy; we must be contented

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>EUROPE has often been compared to one re∣public obeying one law,
namely, that of na∣tions; and composed of provinces, each of which is
prevented from becoming too great by the universal jealousy of the rest.
A quarrel therefore between any two of these is apt to involve the whole in
war; but, particularly, if the dispute happens to arise between those who
are reckoned the leading powers in this assemblage of nations. A war begun
between France and England, for a desart and trackless wild in the remote
parts of Europe, seemed now spreading fast through the whole world; and
the appearance of their commotions revived all the ancient jealousies and
claims among the rest.</P>
<P>The French, at the breaking out of this new war, though they were
successful at its commencement, were very sensible that they could not
long hold their acquisitions against such a superiority as the
English were possessed of at sea, and the numberless resources
they had of assisting their colonies with all the neces∣saries for
war. Being therefore apprized that a naval war must, in the end, turn out to
their disadvantage, <PB N="214" REF="217"/> they made no scruple of
declaring that they would revenge the injuries they sustained in their
colonies, or by sea, upon the King of England's territories in Germany, which
they secretly hoped would be a mo∣tive to his complying with their demands,
or divid∣ing the English forces, or draining their finances with heavy
subsidies, as they knew his affection for his native country. In these
hopes they were not much disappointed; the court of London immediately, to
secure the Electorate of Hanover, entered into a treaty with the Empress of
Russia, by which a body of fifty-five thousand men should be ready to
act in the English service, in case Hanover should be in∣vaded, for
which the Russian Empress was to receive an hundred thousand pounds
annually, to be paid in advance.</P>
<P>His Prussian Majesty had long considered himself as the
guardian of the interests of Germany, and was startled at the treaty. This
was Frederic III, a Prince adorned with all the arts of peace, and whom you
have seen also acting as the most consummate General. He had learned to
read men, by being himself bred in the school of adversity; and to love
his subjects, by having experienced their attachment. He therefore took the
first opportunity to declare, that he would not suffer any foreign forces
to enter the Empire, either as auxiliaries or principals. This consummate
politician had, it seems, been already apprized of some secret
negotiations between the Austrians, whom he looked upon as concealed
ene∣mies, and the Russians, for entering his dominions, and stripping him
of the province of Silesia, which had been conceded to him in the last
treaty of peace. His Britannic Majesty, whose fears for Hanover guided his
present councils, now saw himself in the very situation he most
dreaded, exposed to the re∣sentments of France and Prussia, who could
at once invade and over-run his Electorate, while his Russian 
<PB N="215" REF="218"/> allies lay at too great a distance to assist
him. How∣ever, all he wished was to keep the enemy out of Germany; and this
the King of Prussia made a pro∣fession of doing, as well as he. From
the similitude of their intentions, therefore, these two Monarchs were
induced to unite their interests; and, as they both only desired the same
thing, they came to an agreement to assist each other mutually in keeping
all foreign forces out of the Empire.</P>
<P>From this alliance both powers hoped great ad∣vantages; the
preserving the peace of Germany was the apparent good, but each had other
peculiar bene∣fits in view. The King of Prussia knew the Au∣strians to be
his enemies, and the Russians to be in league with them against him; an
alliance therefore with the court of London kept back the Russians whom he
dreaded, and gave him hopes of taking an ample satisfaction from Austria,
whom he suspected. As for France, he counted upon it as a natural ally,
which, from the long and hereditary enmity with the Austrians, could not, by
declaring against him, join them to whom they had such various reasons
for political aversion. The Elector of Hanover, on the other hand, had
still stronger expectations of the benefits that would arise from this
alliance. He thus procured a near and powerful ally; an ally which he thought
the French, in their present circumstances, would not venture to
disoblige; he counted upon the Austrians as naturally attached to his
interests by former services and friendship; and the Russians, at
least, as likely to continue neuter, from their former stipulations and
subsidy. Such were the motives to this alliance; but both were deceived in
every par∣ticular. And though this alliance astonished Europe at that time,
it soon produced another still more ex∣traordinary. The Austrian Queen
had long medi∣tated designs for recovering Silesia, which, in her exigency,
the King of Prussia had invaded, and ex∣pected <PB N="216" REF="219"/> the
assistance of Russia to effect her purposes. By this last treaty,
however, she saw England joining with Prussia in frustrating her
hopes; and, deprived of one ally, sought about, in order to substitute
ano∣ther in the room. She therefore applied to France; and, in order to procure
the friendship of that power, gave up her barrier in the Netherlands, which
England had been for ages acquiring with its blood and trea∣sure. By this
extraordinary revolution the whole political system of Europe assumed a
new face, and it pretty clearly shews that events guide the politician, while
the politician seldom guides events; or, to use words of Tacitus, there is
but very little differ∣ence between the art and its futility.</P>
<P>In the mean time, this treaty between France and Austria, was no
sooner ratified, than the Empress of Russia was invited to accede to
it; which proposal she ardently embraced. By concurring with their
proposals, Russia had another opportunity of sending her forces into
the western parts of Europe, which was all she had hoped by the
subsidiary treaty with England. A settlement in the western parts of
Eu∣rope was what this fierce northern power long want∣ed an opportunity of
obtaining; for, possessed of that, she could then pour in fresh
forces at any time upon the more effeminate and contending states; and,
perhaps, at length, obtain universal Empire. The intrigues of France were
also successfully employed with Sweden. A war between that nation and
Prussia was kindled up, though contrary to the incli∣nation of their
Sovereign, who had the natural mo∣tives of kindred for being averse to that
measure.</P>
<P>Thus all the alliances which England had long been purchasing upon
the continent, and many of the treaties which she had been long making, with
all the bustle of negotiation, seemed now destroyed. The forces of the
contending powers therefore, now drawn out on each side, stood thus:
England opposed <PB N="217" REF="220"/> France in America and Asia; France
attacked Han∣over on the continent of Europe. This country the King of
Prussia undertook to protect, while England promised to furnish him
with troops and money to assist his operations. On the other hand,
Austria had designs upon Prussia, and drew the Elector of Saxony into
the same pursuits; she was also seconded in her views by Russia,
Sweden, and France, while the rest of the powers of Europe continued
spectators of the contention.</P>
<P>These designs of Austria, for the recovery of her lost
dominions, were too apparent not to be early discovered by so vigilant a
Monarch as that of Prus∣sia; he saw that preparations were making
against him by that power in Bohemia and Moravia, while the Elector of
Saxony, under the pretence of a mi∣litary parade, drew together about sixteen
thousand men, which occupied the strong fortress of Pirna. The secret
treaty also between the courts of Russia and Austria did not escape
his penetration; by this it was privately stipulated, that the treating
powers should, in case of apprehending any breach of the present peace,
unite against Prussia, and share the dominions of that crown between
them. This he considered as an offensive alliance; the treating powers
alledged, that it was only defensive. As preparations for war, however, were
carrying on with the utmost diligence on either side; the King of
Prussia, in order to be confirmed in what he al∣ready suspected,
ordered his minister at Vienna to demand a clear explication, and proper
assurances concerning the preparations he saw making. He at first
received an equivocal anwser; but, ordering his minister to demand a
categorical reply, whether the Empress Queen was for peace or war; and to
re∣quire a positive assurance, that she had no intention to attack him
that year, or the next; an ambiguous answer was returned to so plain a
question, which <PB N="218" REF="221"/> undoubted manifested an inclination
for war. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore thought
proper no longer to suspend his opera¦tions, but to carry the war into the
enemies country<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rather than to wait
for it in his own. He entere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with
a large army into Saxony, and, in the usua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> strain of civility, demanded from the Elector a pas∣sage
through that country, which he well knew the possessor of it was not
able to refuse. In the mean time, he disguised all his suspicions of
the Elector's having secretly treated with his enemies; and, upon the
latter's proposing to observe a strict neutrality, the King of
Prussia professed himself extremely pleas∣ed at the offer; but
desired, as a proof of the since∣rity of his intentions, to separate the
army of the Electorate, for which there could possibly be no oc∣casion,
in case of the neutrality proposed. This, however, the Elector of Saxony
thought it prudent to refuse, which was probably what the other eagerly
desired; for, in consequence of his refusal, the King formed a kind of
blockade about the Saxon camp, in order to reduce it by famine; for such was
the situation of this spot, on which the Saxons had en∣camped, that though
a small army could defend it against the most numerous forces, yet the
same diffi∣culty attended leaving it, that served to render it
in∣accessible to an enemy. Of this his Prussian Ma∣jesty took the
advantage; and, by blocking up every place of egress, thus cut off their
provisions, and the whole body was obliged to surrender prisoners of
war.</P>
<P>In a detail of the transactions of England it will not be
necessary to recapitulate the numerous marches, victories, sieges, and
repulses of this great foreign ally. Whatever either former history had
shewn, or even romance might feign, was outdone both by his expedition and
intrepidity. King only of a very small territory, assisted by England,
whose situation was too remote to give any considerable succours, 
<PB N="219" REF="222"/> opposed and surrounded by all the most formidable
powers of Europe, he still opposed them on every side; he invades
Bohemia, defeats the Au∣strian General at Lowoschtch, retreats, begins his
second campaign with another victory near Prague, is upon the point of taking
that city, but by a teme∣rity inspired by former successes, attacking
the Au∣strians at a disadvantage near Kolin, he is defeated, and obliged to
raise the siege: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Fortune,</HI> says he, <HI>has turned her back
upon me this day. I ought to have ex∣pected it; she is a female, and I am no
gallant; success often occasions a destructive confidence; but another
time we will do better.</HI></Q></P>
<P>One misfortune seemed to follow another; the Hanoverians, who had
joined with him and England, in the alliance, had armed in his favour,
command∣ed by the Duke of Cumberland. As this army, which consisted of
three thousand eight hun∣dred men, was greatly out-numbered by the French,
they were obliged continually to retire before them. The passage of the
river Weser might have been disputed with some hopes of success; yet
the Hano∣verians permitted them to pass it unmolested. Their army,
therefore, was now driven from one part of the country to an other, till, at
length, it made a stand near a village called Hastenback, where it was
judged they would be best able to sustain the superio∣rity of the
enemies numbers. However, notwith∣standing all the efforts of discipline,
and the advan∣tages of situation, the weaker side was still obliged to
retire; and, leaving the field of battle to the French, retreated towards
Stade. By taking this route they marched into a country, from whence they could
neither procure provisions, nor yet had an opportunity of attacking the enemy
upon equal terms. Unable, by their situation, to retire; or, by their
strength, to advance; they were compelled to sign a capitulation, by which
the whole army laid down <PB N="220" REF="223"/> their arms, and were
dispersed into different quarters of cantonment. By this remarkable treaty,
which went by the name of the treaty of Closter Seven, the Hanoverians were
quite subdued, and all the French forces let loose upon the King of
Prussia.</P>
<P>The situation of this Monarch was now become desperate; nor
could human prudence foresee how he could extricate himself from his
distress. The French forces, now united, invaded his dominions on one
side; the Russians, who, for some time, had hovered over his dominions
in another part, all at once hastened onward to overwhelm him, marking their
way with slaughter and cruelty; a large body of Austrians entered
Silesia, and penetrated as far as Breslau, and turning to Schweidnitz,
sat down be∣fore that important fortress, which, after a long siege,
surrendered. Another army of the same nation en∣tered Lusatia, made
themselves masters of Zittau, and pressing forward, laid the capital of
Berlin under contribution. Twenty-two thousand Swedes pierced into
Prussian Pomerania, took the towns of Anclam and Demmein, and exacted
tribute from the whole country. It was in vain that the King of Prussia
faced about to every invader, though his enemies fled before him, while he
pursued one body, another pe∣netrated his territories in the mean time; and
his do∣minions, even in the midst of victory, were every day contracting. The
greatest part were either taken or laid under contribution, and
possessed by his ene∣mies; and he was left without any alliance or
assist∣ance, but what the British parliament might think proper to
afford.</P>
<P>These succours could, at best, have been, for some time, but
ineffectual; however, it was resolved by the English ministry, that
something should be done, and accordingly an enterprize was planned
against the French coast, which, by drawing off their atten∣tion from their
German enemies, might give the latter <PB N="221" REF="224"/> kingdom time to
respire, and call off a part of the French to the defence of their own.
Beside this in∣tention, England also hoped to be able to give a blow to
their marine, by destroying such ships as were laid up, or building in
the harbour of Rochfort, the city against which this expedition was
destined. The English ministry had kept that object of their opera∣tions
a profound secret; and France was filled with alarms till, at length, it was
found that the fleet ap∣peared before Rochfort, where it spent some time in
deliberating upon what manner to proceed. At last it was resolved to
secure the little island of Aix, an easy conquest, which, while
performing, the militia of the country had time to assemble, and there was
an appearance of two camps upon the shore. The commanders therefore, who, by
the badness of the weather, were, at first, prevented from landing, now
feared equal danger from the numbers of the enemy which were to oppose them.
They took into consi∣deration the badness of the coast, the danger of
landing, the time the city had to prepare for a vigorous defence, and their own
unfitness for any other methods to reduce it but that of a sudden attack.
This consideration induced them to desist from further operations; and
they unanimously re∣solved to return home, without making any attempt.
Nothing could equal the discontent of the English upon seeing this
expedition, of which they had con∣ceived such expectations, return
unsuccessful. It pro∣duced, as usual, a contest between those who
plan∣ned, and those who were sent to execute it. The military men
represented it as useless and rash; the ministers exclaimed at the
timidity and delays of those from whose vigour success was to be
expected. A Court of Enquiry censured the commander; but a Court-Martial
acquitted him. This, like almost all the former operations, served to
embitter party, and increase despondence. A great man was even heard 
<PB N="222" REF="225"/> to say, upon a very solemn occasion, that he
believed the commanders of every military operation were re∣solved upon doing
nothing. The tumult of the people was now sunk from turbulent clamour into
sullen discontent; they saw only gloomy prospects on every side,
their armies destroyed, their fleets unactive, their expeditions ridiculous,
and the only ally they had left in Europe, that would fight their battles, upon
the point of being overwhelmed by superiority of numbers. Such were the
beginnings of this war, from which the timid foreboded national servitude,
and a total destruction of all maritime power, and even the most sanguine
only hoped for a peace that might restore them to former equality.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH was the ill success of the English arms, and of their
allies, at the beginning of this war. Every day the press, teemed with
productions which either reproached their cowardice, or foreboded their
undoing. Yet still the hopes of the parliament rose with their
disappointments, and every resource seem∣ed to augment with their
expences. Tho' the sup∣plies for this destructive and hitherto shameful
war, were enormous, yet they were raised as soon as grant∣ed. The officers
of the army seemed roused into vi∣gour by the national reproaches. Asia,
however, was the country in which success first began to dawn upon the
British interest, and where we first learned the art of again conquering
the enemy. A war in Europe could not be proclaimed between the two great
powers, without being felt in the remotest parts of the globe. This immense
tract of country, which was the theatre of an Asiatic war, comprehends the 
<PB N="223" REF="226"/> whole peninsula of India Proper. On the coasts of
this great territory, the English, the French, and se∣veral other powers of
Europe, had built forts, with the original consent of the Mogul, who claims
the sovereignty of the whole Empire. Whatever his right may be to this
dominion, his power is scarce felt or acknowledged in many of the remoter
pro∣vinces; and even the Governors or Nabobs, who were originally of his
appointment, have render∣ed themselves independent, and exert an absolute
dominion over their respective territories, with∣out acknowledging his
superiority, either by tri∣bute or homage. In the contests of these
Prin∣ces, therefore, instead of having recourse to the Mogul for redress,
they apply to the European powers, whom they can either purchase or
persuade to assist them. The war between England and France, in these
remote parts, first began by each power's siding with two contending
Nabobs, and thus, by degrees, becoming principals in the dis∣pute. The
success, on each side, for some time after the treaty of Aix la
Chapelle, seemed doubtful, till, at length, the affairs of the English
seemed to gain the ascendancy by the courage and conduct of Mr. Clive, a
gentleman who first entered into the service of the company as a clerk, but
soon shewed his ta∣lents more adapted for war. By his vigilance and courage
the province of Arcot was cleared of the enemy, the French General taken
prisoner, and the Nabob, whom the English supported, reinstated in the
government of which he had been formerly de∣prived. The French, discouraged
by these misfor∣tunes, and sensible of their own inferiority in this part
of the world, sent over a commissary with a view to restore peace; and
a convention between the two companies was accordingly concluded, im∣porting,
that the territories taken on either side since the last peace should
be mutually restored; that the <PB N="224" REF="227"/> Nabobs advanced by the
influence of either party, should be acknowledged by both; and that, for the
future, neither should interfere in the differences be∣tween the Princes of
the country. This cessation, however, was not of long duration; compacts
made between trading companies can never be of long con∣tinuance, when there is
a prospect of advantage to either side from their infraction. In a few
months after both sides renewed their operations, no longer as auxiliaries
but as rivals in arms and commerce. What the motives to this infraction were
are not suf∣ficiently known; wherever there is trade there must be a degree
of avarice; and that is a passion too often the parent of injustice and
cruelty. Certain it is that the Viceroy of Bengal, from motives of per∣sonal
resentment, declared against the English; and, levying a numerous army,
laid siege to Calcutta, one of their forts, which was in no situation to
endure the attack even of barbarians. It was taken by as∣sault; and the
garrison, to the number of one hun∣dred and forty-six persons, were
crowded into a nar∣row prison called the <HI>Black Hole,</HI> about eighteen
feet square, without any entrance for air, except by two iron windows to the
west, which, by no means, af∣forded a sufficient quantity for the
supporting life in such numbers. In such a burning climate it is
ter∣rible to conceive the situation of wretches thus im∣mured and
suffocating each other. Their first effort, upon finding the danger of
their horrid confinement, was to break open the door; but this being
impos∣sible, they endeavoured to excite the compassion or the avidity
of the guard, by offering him a large sum of money for his assistance,
in removing them to sepa∣rate prisons, with which he was not able to
comply, as the Viceroy was asleep, and no person durst dis∣turb him.
They were now therefore left without all hopes of relief to perish, and the
whole prison was filled with groans, shrieks, contest and confu∣sion. 
<PB N="225" REF="228"/> This turbulence soon after sunk into languor and
despair; and towards morning all was horrid silence and desolation. Of an
hundred and forty-six who had entered alive, but twenty-three only
sur∣vived, and of these several died by putrid fevers upon their being
set free.</P>
<P>The reduction of this important fortress served to interrupt the
prosperous successes of the English com∣pany; but the fortune of Mr.
Clive still vanquished every obstacle; a fleet, under the command of
Ad∣miral Watson, conspired with his efforts, and helped him in his
victories. Angria, a piratical Prince, who had long annoyed the company's
settlements in the neighbourhood of Bombay, first felt the weight of our
naval power. This Prince maintained a large number of gallies, with which he
would attack the largest ships, when he found a proper opportunity; and, by
this means, he exacted a tribute from every European power for a permission
to trade. To sub∣due such a dangerous enemy to commerce, Admiral Watson
and Colonel Clive sailed into his harbour of Geriah, though they
sustained a warm fire as they passed, and soon threw all his fleet
and his fort into flames. The next day the fort surrendered at discre∣tion,
where the conquerors found a large quantity of warlike stores, and effects to
the value of one hun∣dred and thirty thousand pounds.</P>
<P>From this conquest Mr. Clive went on to take revenge for the
treatment of the English at Calcutta, and about the beginning of December
arrived at Ba∣lasore, in the kingdom of Bengal. There was but small
opposition made to the fleet, or the army, till they came before Calcutta,
the scene of former cru∣elty; but as soon as the Admiral, with two ships,
arrived before the town, he received a furious fire from all the batteries.
This, however, he returned with still greater execution, and, in less than
two hours, the place was abandoned. Thus, by the con∣quest 
<PB N="226" REF="229"/> of this and the former fortress, the English be∣came
possessed of the two strongest settlements on the banks of the
Ganges. Soon after these successes, Hughly, a city of great trade was
reduced with as little difficulty, and all the Viceroy of Bengal's
store-houses and granaries were destroyed. This barbarous Prince,
incensed at these losses, assembled an army of ten thousand
horse, and fifteen thousand foot, fully resolved to expel the English
out of his domi∣nions. Upon the first intelligence of his march, Colonel
Clive begged from the Admiral a reinforce∣ment of men from the ships; and
six hundred sea∣men were accordingly soon added to his little army. The
numerous forces of the Viceroy of Bengal ap∣peared, and Colonel Clive advanced
in three columns to attack him. But, though the forces were so seem∣ingly
disproportioned, with respect to number, the victory soon declared in
favour of the English com∣mander. In fact, what could the timid Asiatic
sol∣dier do against European troops, hardened by war, and inured to all the
vicissitudes of climate. All the customs, habits, opinions, of the
Asiatics tend to enfeeble the body, and effeminate the mind. When we conceive
a body of men led up to the attack, dressed in long silk garments, with
no other courage but that inspired by opium; with no other fears from defeat
but that of changing their mode of slavery; their chief commander mounted on
an elephant, and consequently a more conspicuous object for aim; their
artillery drawn by oxen, impatient and furious upon the slightest wound;
every soldier utterly un∣acquainted with that cool intrepidity which provides
against danger, and only taught to fight by the same arts that raise
their passions. If we consider all these circumstances, it will be no
way surprising if one or two thousand Europeans should easily
discomfit thirty thousand Indians. And all the heroism of a Cyrus, or an
Alexander, in gaining such dispropor∣tioned <PB N="227" REF="230"/>
victories, will no longer be the subject of ad∣miration.</P>
<P>A victory so easily acquired by a foreign enemy, soon rendered
the Viceroy of Bengal contemptible to his subjects at home. His present
cowardice render∣ed him despicable; his former insolence and cruelty
odious. A conspiracy was projected against him by Alikan, his prime
minister, and the English having private intimations of the design,
resolved to seize the opportunity of seconding it with all their
endeavours. Accordingly Colonel Clive marched forward, took the town of Cutwa
in his march, and soon came up with the Viceroy's army; and, after a short
contest, put the whole to flight, with terrible slaughter. Ali∣kan, who had
first incited his master to this under∣taking, had hitherto concealed his
attachments, either through fear or perfidy; but, after this victory, he
open∣ly espoused the cause of the English, and was therefore solemnly
proclaimed Viceroy of Bengal, Bahar, and Oriza, in the room of the former
Viceroy, who was as solemnly deposed, and soon after put to death by his
successor. The new Viceroy was not insensible of the gratitude he
owed the English, for their as∣sistance in his promotion. He granted
liberally all their demands, satisfied them even to the most ex∣tended
wish of avarice, and took every method to demonstrate his pride in their
alliance.</P>
<P>Yet not the Indians alone, but the French also, submitted to
Colonel Clive's assiduity and courage, seconded by the endeavours of the
Admirals Watson and Pocock. Chadenagore, a French settlement higher up the
river than Calcutta, of great strength, and the most important of any
possessed by that na∣tion in the bay of Bengal, submitted to the
English arms. The goods and money found in the place were considerable; but
the chief damage the French sustained was, in the ruin of their head
settlement on the Ganges, by which they had long divided the 
<PB N="228" REF="231"/> commerce of this part of India. Thus, in one cam∣paign,
the English, in some measure, became posses∣sors of an immense
tract of country, superior in wealth, fertility, extent, and number of
inhabitants, to many of Europe. Above two millions sterling were paid to the
company and sufferers at Calcutta; the soldiers and seamen shared six
hundred thousand pounds, and the English forces became too formid∣able for
resistance. Yet, perhaps, this remote power will, one day, either serve
to drain from the mother-country all its useful hands, or our victories will
serve to teach the native barbarians to avail themselves of their numbers,
and, by being frequently defeated, they will, at last, learn to conquer.</P>
<P>The success of the English was not a little alarm∣ing to the
French ministry at home; and it is be∣lieved that even the Dutch themselves
entertained some jealousy of their growing greatness. A consi∣derable
reinforcement was therefore sent from France, under the command of General
Lally, an Irishman, who was reckoned one of the bravest, yet the most
whimfical man in the French service. He had been, from his earliest years,
bred a soldier of fortune, and carried the military spirit of honour to its
utmost li∣mits. Under his guidance the French affairs seem∣ed, for some
time, to wear a better face; he took fort St. David's, plundered a town
belonging to the King of Tanjour, in alliance with the English, and after
laid siege to his capital. Failing in his design upon this city, he entered
the province of Arcot, and prepared for laying siege to Madrass, the chief
settlement of our company, upon the coast of Coro∣mandel. In the siege of
this important fortress, a greater variety of difficulties presented than
he had expected. The artillery of the garrison was well ma∣naged, while, on
the other side, the French acted with the utmost timidity; it was in vain
that their commander exhorted them to proceed, though a <PB N="229" REF="232"/>
breach was made, and lay open for fifteen days, not one of them dared to
venture out to the assault. Beside this, they were ill supplied with
provisions; and the arrival of a reinforcement in the garrison soon
after, served to banish all hopes of success. After a brisk fire they
raised the siege; and this miscarriage so intirely depressed the
ardour of the enemy, that they appeared quite dispirited in almost every
ensuing en∣gagement. In this manner, therefore, their affairs went on
declining, not less by land than by sea. There were several engagements
between the two fleets, in which the French, though superior in number of
ships and men, always declined a decisive engagement.</P>
<P>But the French were not the only enemies the English had to fear
in this part of the world; the jealousy of the Dutch was excited by our
repeated success, and the late extension of our power. As this dispute,
however trifling it may seem, may, one day, be of greater consequence than
it appears at pre∣sent, I shall be more particular in my relation of
it.</P>
<P>Under a pretence of reinforcing their garrisons in Bengal, the
Dutch equipped an armament of seven ships, which was ordered to sail up
the Ganges, and render their fort at a place called Chincura so for∣midable
as to be able to bid defiance to the power of Britain, and thus secure to
themselves the trade for salt-petre, which this place afforded. This
design, however, Colonel Clive thought incumbent on him, if possible, to
defeat; and sending the Dutch com∣mander a letter, he informed him that he
could not permit his landing, and marching forces to Chincura. To this
message the Dutchman replied, that he had no such designs as were
imputed to him; and he only beg∣ged liberty to land his troops to refresh
them; a request which was readily granted. He made these concessions,
however, only till he knew that the ships which were to second his
operations, were come up the river, and <PB N="230" REF="233"/> then, throwing
off the mask, he began his march to Chincura, and took several small
vessels belonging to the English, to retaliate for the affront he
pre∣tended to have sustained in being denied permission to proceed.
Whether, upon this occasion the Cal∣cutta Indiaman was sent out to
interrupt their pro∣gress, or was only pursuing its way homeward, is not
clearly known; but certain it is, that the Dutch commander threatened to sink
it, if it presumed to pass him. The English captain seeing them point
their guns, as if they really resolved to put their threats in execution,
returned to Calcutta, where two other India ships lay at anchor, and reported
his adventure to Colonel Clive, who instantly or∣dered the three Indiamen to
prepare for battle. The Dutch fleet were not remiss in advancing to meet
them. After a few broadsides, however, the Dutch Commodore struck, and the
rest of his fleet followed the example. The victory being thus obtained
without any loss to the English, Captain Wilson, who com∣manded in the
expedition, took possession of the prizes which had greatly suffered,
and the crews were sent prisoners to the English fort. In the mean time
their land forces, which amounted to eleven hundred men, were totally defeated
by Colonel Ford, sent upon that duty by Clive. A considerable part were
killed, and the rest were made prisoners of war. During this contest, the
Nabob preserved a suspicious neu∣trality, ready, as it should seem,
to join with the conquerors. Fortune, however, no sooner deter∣mined in
favour of the English, than he offered them his services, and professed
himself ready to demolish the Dutch fortification of Chincura. This
contest was represented in very different lights to the re∣spective
governments at home; the Dutch declaim∣ed against the English,
oppressing all who at∣tempted to trade in the Indies; while the English,
on the other hand, reminded the Dutch of their <PB N="231" REF="234"/> former
cruelties, and of their desire of gain, even at the expence of every moral
obligation. However, soon after a negotiation ensued; the Dutch wisely
gave way to a power they were unable to withstand. A treaty was concluded,
and peace was restored, seemingly to the satisfaction of both parties.
Such is the present situation of this contest, which, proba∣bly, contains
the seeds of future dissension. The Dutch will, upon all occasions,
think it allowable to increase their power in India to whatsoever pitch
they think proper; and the English will ever find it their interest to
repel them. It may thus happen, that the amity of the two powers in Europe will
not be sufficient to preserve unanimity in so distant a part of the
world. In this manner, while Great Britain puts an end to one war, she often
lays the foundation for another; for, extended Empire ever produces an
increasing necessity to defend it.</P>
<P>Our success against the French on the coast of Coromandel
was not less conspicuous; our troops were headed by Colonel Coote, a native
of Ireland, a man of prudence and bravery; he marched against General Lally,
took the city of Wandewash in his way, reduced Carangoly, a fortress
commanded by Colonel O Kenedy; and, at length, came up with the French General,
who was equally desirous of the engagement. It is remarkable enough, that the
commanders, on either side, were countrymen; but this did not, in the
least, abate their attachment to the different crowns they served. In the
morning early the French advanced within three quarters of a mile of the
English line, and the cannonading be∣gan with great fury on both sides; the
engagement continued with much obstinacy till about two in the afternoon,
when the French gave way, and fled to∣wards their camp; which, however, they as
quick∣ly abandoned, and left their cannon, and the field of battle, to the
conquerors. Their losing the city of <PB N="232" REF="235"/> Arcot was the
consequence of this victory; and no∣thing now remained to them of all their
vast posses∣sions in India but Pondicherry, their strongest,
larg∣est, and most beautiful settlement in that part of the world. This
capital of the French Indian power, in the days of its prosperity, exceeded
all other Eu∣ropean settlements there, in trade, opulence, and splendor;
and was still the repository for all the French wealth, which remained
after repeated de∣feats. As soon as the fortresses adjacent to this
im∣portant place were reduced, Colonel Coote sat down before it, resolved
upon the blockade by land, while Admiral Stevens shut up their harbour by
sea. A regular siege was, at that time, impracticable; from the periodical
rains which in that climate were soon expected to obstruct such
operations. These disad∣vantages were even sufficient to repress any
attempts whatsoever; but, notwithstanding the inclemency of the climate,
the English commander continued be∣fore the place for full seven months.
Neither rains nor storms were, in the least, able to abate their
as∣siduity; they continued the siege, and pressed the garrison in
such a manner that they were reduced to the most extreme distress.
Lally, however, was re∣solutely bent on suffering every calamity rather
than yield this last stake of French power in India, though his soldiers
were obliged to feed on dogs and cats, and even bought such wretched
provisions extremely dear, (eight crowns having been given for the flesh of
a dog) yet still he determined to hold out. In the midst of this
distress, fortune seemed to give an oppor∣tunity of relief, had it been
properly seconded. In the beginning of January one of those terrible
storms which are common in those climates, but of whose violence we can
have but little idea in Europe, wreck∣ed a large part of the English fleet
that was block∣ing up the harbour of Pondicherry. This was a blow 
<PB N="233" REF="236"/> which once more elevated the hopes of the despairing
garrison. The General now flattered himself with the hope of being
supplied with provisions; and, once more, animated his soldiers, long
sunk with disease, famine, fatigue, and uninterrupted adversity. He
immediately wrote to one of the French residents at a Dutch settlement
sor instant assistance; his eager impatience appears in the letter he
sent. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>The English squadron is no more, Sir. Of the
twelve ships they had in our road, seven are lost, crews and all; the
other four dis∣masted, and no more than one frigate hath
escaped—lose not an instant in sending boats after boats loaded
with rice.—The saving of Pondicherry hath been in your power once
already; this opportunity neglected, the fault will be all yours. Offer great
rewards.—In four days I expect seven∣teen thousand
Morattoes.—In short, risque all, attempt all, force all, and send
us some rice, should it be but half a garse at a time.</HI></Q> This
singular letter, however, was inter∣cepted; and, in less than four days, he
had the mor∣tification to behold Admiral Stevens again appearing in the
harbour, who had repaired his losses with all possible celerity; and
the blockade now became as complete as ever. Still, however, he made no
pro∣posal to surrender; the siege was carried on by his countryman with
redoubled alacrity; and, at length, he found his troops half consumed with
fatigue and famine, a breach made in the rampart, and not more than one day's
provision of any kind remain∣ing. He was now reduced to an extremity that
would admit of no hesitation; a signal was therefore made to cease
hostilities; the principal of the Jesuits, together with two civilians,
came out, and offered terms of capitulation. Lally, however, could not be
prevailed upon to offer any terms; he sent a pa∣per, filled with reproaches,
against the English, to Colonel Coote; and alledged, that he would not
treat with an enemy upon the honourable terms of war, who had already forfeited
his honour in seve∣ral <PB N="234" REF="237"/> instances. He therefore
suffered the English troops to take possession of the place, but
refused to surrender it in the usual forms. This conquest ter∣minated
the power of France in India; the whole trade of that vast peninsula, from
the Indus to the Ganges, became our own. The Princes of the coun∣try knew the
English force, and learned to fear it. Since that time nothing considerable
has been done against us. Our East-India company have become the arbiters
of Empire. The Mogul himself has been defeated, and taken prisoner. The
British Em∣pire begins to vie even with that of ancient Rome; the extent of
its dominions on land is as wide, and its force at sea is infinitely greater.
Happy if we know when to bound our successes; happy if we can
distinguish between victories and advantages; if we can be convinced that
when a nation shines brightest with conquest, it may then, like a
wasting taper, be only hastening to decay.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>VICTORY, which thus first dawned upon us, from the East,
seemed to extend even to Eu∣rope and America. But some steps led to
these suc∣cesses which had been long wished for; and, at length, were
effected. The affairs of war were di∣rected by a ministry which seemed
utterly unequal to the weight and importance of such a charge; they were but
feebly held together among each other, and clamoured against by the united
voice of the people. It had long been their method to rule by party; and,
surrounding the throne, it was said, they attempted only to fill the royal
ear with whatever suggestions they thought most to their interests.
When any <PB N="235" REF="238"/> new measure was proposed, which could not
receive their approbation; or any new member was introduced into government,
whom they did not nominate, it was their method to throw up their places with a
se∣cret view of resuming them with greater lustre. Thus all hope of
preferment was to be expected only from them; public favours were conferred
only for private services; they were thought to govern in the senate and in
the field; the strength of the crown was actu∣ally declining; that of the
people was scarce any, while aristocracy filled up every avenue to the
throne with pride, ignorance, and faction.</P>
<P>The state of the King and nation, at that time, was truly
deplorable; the defeat of Braddock in Ame∣rica; the loss of Oswego; the
delay of armaments; the absurd destination of fleets and armies, all
served to reduce the people almost to a state of desperation, and
brought addresses to the throne from every part of the kingdom. The general
voice was, at length, too loud not to reach the throne; and the ministry
were, at length, obliged to admit some gentlemen into a share of the
government, whose talents and integrity might, in some measure,
counterbalance their own deficience. At the head of these newly introduced
were Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge; the for∣mer of these was appointed Secretary of
State, the other Chancellor of the Exchequer. To draw the characters of men
still living, would necessarily sub∣ject me to the imputation of
adulation or satyr; it is enough to say, that the people had high
expectations from their abilities; and, in the end, they were not
disappointed.</P>
<P>The pleasure of the nation, however, was but of short
continuance; a ministry composed of such jar∣ring principles could not
long continue united, being constituted of persons espousing different
measures, and actuated by different motives. The old juncto courted the
Sovereign's favour by their pretended at∣tachment <PB N="236" REF="239"/> to his
foreign dominions; the new cla∣moured against all continental connexions as
ut∣terly incompatible with the interest of the nation. Both, perhaps, might
have been wrong; but it is obvious, that these sentiments were sufficient
to sink the latter in the royal esteem; and this dislike was artfully
kept up, and increased by their old rivals in power. A few months, therefore,
after Mr. Pitt had been put into office, he was obliged to resign the
seals, by his Majesty's command; and Mr. Legge was dismissed from
being Chancellor of the Exche∣quer. The old ministry now thought themselves
secure in the unmolested possession of former power; but this very
step which they took for their own se∣curity turned out to them as
unfortunate as those they planned for the public were unsuccessful. The
whole nation seemed to rise up as one man in vindi∣cation of that part of
the ministry that was lately excluded. And the King, at length, thought
pro∣per to comply with the general solicitation. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge were
again restored, and a train of successes soon began to dignify their
designs.</P>
<P>For some time, however, the measures planned by the former
ministry were pursued in America; and though the English were superior
to the enemy, yet still they felt all the inconvenience of irresolute
coun∣cils and ill-planned operations. Our women and children in that part of
the world were exposed to the unparalleled cruelty of the Indian savages;
and, what is still more remarkable, two thousand Britons with arms in their
hands, continued tame spectators of these inhumanities. Bad success
ever produces complaint on all sides; and England now heard no∣thing but
invective and accusation. The Generals sent over to manage the operations
of war, loudly accused the timidity and the slowness of the natives, who
were to unite in their own defence; the natives, on the contrary, as warmly
expostulated against the <PB N="237" REF="240"/> pride, avarice, or
incapacity of those sent over to command them. General Shirley, who was
appoint∣ed to that command, had been superseded by Lord London; and this
nobleman soon after returning to England, three several commanders were put
at the head of separate operations; the most important be∣ing that
designed against Cape Breton, was com∣manded by General Amherst. The
taking possession of this island, and its fortress, was a
conquest great∣ly wished by all our colonies, as it had always been a
convenient harbour to the enemy, which, from thence annoyed our trade with
impunity. It was also a convenient situation for carrying on their
fishery; a branch of commerce of the utmost bene∣fit to the French nation.
The fortress of Louisburg was strengthened with all the assistance
of art; the garrison was numerous; the commander vigilant; and every
precaution taken to prevent a descent. An account of the operations of a
siege is tedious; be it sufficient to say, that the English
surmounted every obstacle with the most amazing intrepidity; their former
timidity seemed now converted into persever∣ing resolution; the place was
surrendered by capitu∣lation; and our troops, long used to disappointment
and repulse began to boast of victory in their turn.</P>
<P>Two other operations were carried on in America at the same time,
the one under General Abercrom∣bie, against Crown Point and Ticonderago; the
other, more to the southward, against fort Du Quesne; the latter
expedition was successful; but that against Crown Point and Ticonderago
was at∣tended with its usual bad fortune. This was now the second time that
the English army had attempted to penetrate into those hideous wilds by
which na∣ture had secured the French encroachments in that remote part of
America; Braddock was fallen in the attempt; his rashness contributed to
his defeat; and too much caution, perhaps, was the fault of his
suc∣cessor. <PB N="238" REF="241"/> Much time was spent in marching to
the place of action; and the enemy were thus perfectly prepared to give the
English troops a warm reception. They were found intrenched under the fort of
Ti∣conderago, behind a breast-work raised eight feet high, and still
farther secured by felled trees, with their branches pointing outwards.
These difficul∣ties, however, the English attempted to surmount; but as
the enemy, being secure themselves, took aim at leisure; a terrible
carnage of the assailants ensued, and the General, after repeated
efforts, was obliged to order a retreat. The English army, however, was
still superior to that of the enemy, and might, it was supposed, have
gone onward with success, if support∣ed by their artillery, which had not
yet arrived; but the General felt, too sensibly, the terrors of the late
defeat, to remain in the vicinity of a victorious ene∣my; he therefore
reimbarked his troops, and returned to his camp at Lake George, from whence he
had taken his departure.</P>
<P>The success of this campaign, however, was, upon the whole,
greatly in favour of the English. The taking of fort Du Quesne served to
remove from our colonies the terror of the incursions of barbarians, and
interrupted that continued correspondence, which by a chain of forts, one
part of the French settle∣ments had with the other. The ministry too
disco∣vered a spirit of vigorous resolution hitherto unknown, in this
part of the world; and the next campaign promised more brilliant
successes.</P>
<P>Accordingly, in the opening of the next session, 1759, the
ministry seemed sensible that a single ef∣fort carried in such wide
extended dominions, would never bring the enemy into subjection; it was
there∣fore resolved to attack them in several different parts of this
extensive Empire at once. It was therefore pro∣posed to attack the French
in all their places of strength at the same time Preparations were
therefore made, <PB N="239" REF="242"/> and expeditions went forward against
three different parts of the northern continent of America. Gene∣ral Amherst,
commander in chief, with a body of twelve thousand men, was to attack Crown
Point that had hitherto been the reproach of the English army. General Wolfe
was, at the opposite quarter, to enter the river St. Lawrence, and undertake
the siege of Quebec, the capital of the French dominions in this part of the
world, while General Prideaux and Sir William Johnson were to attempt a fort
near the cataract of Niagara. This last expedition was the first
successful. The fort of Niagara was a place of great importance, and
served to command all the communication between the northern and western
French settlements. The siege was soon commenced by the English, but
General Prideaux was killed in the trenches by the bursting of a cohorn; so
that the whole success of the expedition fell to General John∣son, and
his good fortune. He omitted nothing to promote the vigorous measures of his
predecessor, but added all his own popularity. The French knew the
importance of this fort, and attempted to relieve it. Johnson attacked them
with his usual intrepidity and success; in less than an hour their
whole army was put to the route, and the garrison, beholding the de∣feat of
their countrymen, surrendered prisoners of war. Nor was General Amherst
less successful, though, without meeting an enemy, upon his march to
Crown Point, he found both that fort and Ticon∣derago deserted and
destroyed. There now, there∣fore, remained but one grand and decisive blow
to put all North America in possession of the English. This was the
taking of Quebec, a city handsomely built, populous, and flourishing.
Admiral Saunders commanded the naval part of the expedition; that by land was
committed to the conduct of General Wolfe. This young soldier, who was not
yet thirty-five, had distinguished himself on many former occasions,
par∣ticularly <PB N="240" REF="243"/> in the siege of Louisburg, a part of
the suc∣cess of which was justly ascribed to him, who, unin debted to
family or connexions had raised himself by merit to his present command.
The war in this part of the world had hitherto been carried on with ex∣treme
barbarity; and each side seemed to have adopt∣ed the savage manners of
the Indians, whose country they disputed. Wolfe, however, disdained
these base proceedings, and carried on all the terrors of war with the
humanity of a truly civilized European. A description of the siege of this
city may instruct a soldier, but can scarcely inform a citizen; be it
suf∣ficient to observe, that its beginning appeared ex∣tremely
unpromising to the besiegers; and repeated repulses even served to
abate the hopes of the com∣mander. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I know,</HI> said he, <HI>that the affairs of
Great Britain require the most vigorous measures; but then the courage of
an handful of brave men should be exerted only where there is some hope of
a favourable event. At pre∣sent the difficulties are so various that I am
at a loss how to determine.</HI></Q> However, he resolved, though now
sinking under fatigue and sickness, to make one vi∣gorous attempt before
he gave up all; and accord∣ingly, in the night, part of his troops, with great
difficulty made themselves masters of an hill that commanded the town. A
battle ensued; Montcalm, the French commander, resolved not to survive
the defeat of his country. Wolfe, on the other side, re∣solved to conquer
or die. Both commanders had their wish; both fell; but the English were
victorious. The circumstances attending the death of Wolfe served to give
an example like that of the noble The∣ban. He, in the beginning of the
engagement, re∣ceived a wound in the hand, which he dissembled, wrapping it
round with his handkerchief, to stop the effusion of blood; he advanced
with uncon∣cern: a second ball, was more fatal; it pierced his breast, so
that, unable to proceed, he leaned on the <PB N="241" REF="244"/> shoulder of
a soldier who was near him. Now, struggling in the agonies of death, and
just depart∣ing, he heard a voice cry, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>they run;</HI></Q> he seemed to revive a
moment at the sound, and, asking who ran, was informed the <HI>French;</HI>
expressing his wonder that they ran so soon, and unable to gaze any
longer, he sunk on the soldier's breast, and his last words were, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I die happy.</HI></Q> Perhaps the loss of
such a man was greater to the nation than the conquering of all Ca∣nada was
advantageous; but it is the misfortune of humanity, that we can never know true
greatness till that moment when we are going to lose it.</P>
<P>The surrender of the city was the consequence of this victory,
and, with it, the total cession of all Canada. The French, it is true,
made, in the en∣suing season, a vigorous effort to retake it; but, by the
good conduct of our Governour, the town held out till relieved by an English
fleet, under the com∣mand of Lord Colville. Thus did this campaign make ample
reparation for all the losses that had been hitherto sustained by the
English. The French had now no force capable of making any resistance;
they held out the war now, not with hopes of victory, but honourable
capitulation; one place after another was invaded; Montreal, at last,
surrendered; and, in a short time, a country, which their own writers have
represented as being more extensive than the Roman Empire, fell totally
under the power of his Britannic Majesty.</P>
<P>How far the extending dominion tends to the in∣creasing the
strength of a nation, is an object worthy consideration. The splendour of
victory should never dazzle the eye of reason. No people ever could call
their country powerful, if it were not populous. For political force depends
upon the small frontier to be defended; and the vicinity of an army to every
place to be invaded; but extended Empire takes away both these advantages,
and, before the soldier <PB N="242" REF="245"/> can traverse half his proper
territories, his country may have already felt all the horrors of invasion.
Whatever joy therefore our country might have felt at these immense
acquisitions, of remote territory, I own it gives me no very pleasing
prospect. The manufactures, the trade, and the riches of these di∣stant
countries, can never recompence for the conti∣nual drain of useful and
industrious subjects, that must be derived from the mother country to
people them. Wherever the lower sort of people in any kingdom can fly from
labour, they will be ready to go; yet, upon the industry, and the valour of
these alone, every kingdom must hope for security. Not the effeminate,
and the luxurious, can defend their country in the day of battle; they may
increase ti∣midity by their example, but opulence can never give true relief.
The Spaniards and the Portuguese were much more powerful before they divided
their strength into all the torrid climates of Southern America. The state
thus got riches, but lost men; they had gold, but could not regain
industry. Thus are their nations now incapable of defending them∣selves
against powerful foreign invasion. The im∣mense wealth of the Indies that
every year comes home to their ports goes to inrich a few; their sub∣jects
are either in the extremes of wealth or poverty; the rich have only slaves
beneath them, who hate those for whom they must labour; the poor have no
acquisitions, nor property, to defend; so that their armies are composed
either of wretches pressed into the service, who only seek for
opportunities not to fight, but to fly; or of men, rich and noble, courageous
from pride, yet weak from luxury. Such is not, as yet, the case of England,
nor will ever be, if a passion for conquest is not mistaken for
national prosperity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE success of our arms in America was at∣chieved by moderate
efforts; on the contrary, in Europe the efforts we made, and the operations of
our great ally the King of Prussia, were astonish∣ing, yet produced no
very signal effects. Safety was all that could be expected; and this was
secured con∣trary to all human expectation. You have just seen that
Monarch surrounded by enemies; the greatest and most formidable powers of
Europe; you have seen almost the whole power of the continent united
against, and hovering over, his devoted dominions; and the only allies that
remained to him bound by treaty to retire, and give him no assistance. In
this terrible situation he still adhered to his fortitude, and, relying on
his natural subjects alone, resolved never to abandon his claims. Such was
the desperate condition of his affairs; yet they were still rendered more
hopeless, when he was informed that his only friend, the Monarch of that
generous people which had hitherto supplied him with money and stores, was
going to forsake him, and leave him to irreme∣diable ruin. It was thus he
expostulated with the doubting Monarch upon this occasion: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Is it possible that your Majesty can have
so little fortitude and constancy, as to be dispirited by a small
reverse of fortune. Are our affairs so ruinous that they cannot be
repaired? Consider the step you have made me undertake, and remember that
you are the cause of all my misfortunes. I should never have abandoned my
former alliances but for your flattering assurances. I do not now repent of
the treaty concluded between us; but I intreat you will not ingloriously
leave me at the mercy of my enemies, after having brought upon me all the
powers of Europe.</HI></Q> The French and Imperialists, after a
successful sum∣mer campaign, were, at this time, which was the depth of
winter, sat down to the siege of Leipsic. His Prus∣sian Majesty
dreaded the capture of this important <PB N="244" REF="247"/> city, and soon,
unexpectedly, seemed to rise up before it. Such was the terror of his arms,
even vanquish∣ed as he had been, that his approach raised the siege, and
the French, though superior in number, retreat∣ed. He, at length, overtook
them at a village called Rosbach, and gained so complete a victory, that
night alone saved their whole army from destruction. The Austrians were,
in another part of the Empire, still victorious, and had taken the Prince of
Bevern, his generalissimo, prisoner. The King, after a dreadful march of
two hundred miles, in the depth of win∣ter, came up with them near Breslau,
disposed his inferior forces with his usual judgment, and obtained
another bloody victory, in which he took not less than fifteen thousand
prisoners. Breslau, with a gar∣rison of ten thousand men, surrendered
soon after, These successes dispirited the enemy, and raised his
allies to new hopes.</P>
<P>After the capitulation of Closter-Severn was sign∣ed, between
the Duke of Cumberland and the Duke of Richelieu, both sides began to
complain of in∣fractions. The Hanoverians accused the rapacity of the French
General, and the insolent brutality of his soldiers; while the French
retorted the charge of insurrection against them, and began to think of
treat∣ing as a conquered enemy those whom they had only bound by treaty as
neutrals. Treaties have never been preserved longer than interest or
compulsion bound them; political faith is a word without mean∣ing; the French
oppressed the Hanoverians; the lat∣ter resumed their arms; and each
side complained, as usual, of infraction. A General was not long want∣ing
to assemble the collecting army. Prince Ferdi∣nand of Brunswic put
himself at their head, began by skirmishing with success; and, at
last, were in a capacity of becoming formidable to their late victors. From
this time the King of Prussia sought the enemy upon more equal terms than
ever; often victorious, <PB N="245" REF="248"/> sometimes repulsed; but ever
active and formidable. To name his victories, the towns he took, the dan∣gers
he escaped, and the losses he suffered, would take up more time than I
would chuse to grant to such accounts, or you should bestow. Never was
the art of war carried to such a pitch as by him. In this war Europe saw,
with astonishment, campaigns carried on in the midst of winter; great and
bloody battles fought, yet producing no visible advantage to the victors. At
no time, since the days of heroism, were such numbers destroyed, so
many towns taken, so many skirmishes fought, such stratagems
prac∣tised, or such intrepidity shewn. Armies now were considered as
composing one single machine, directed by the General, and animated with
one will. From the commentary of these campaigns, succeeding Ge∣nerals will
take their lessons for devastation, and im∣prove in the arts of
increasing human calamity.</P>
<P>England was, all this time, happily retired from the calamities
which drenched the rest of Europe in blood; yet, from her natural military
eagerness, seemed desirous of sharing those dangers of which she
was only a spectator. This passion for carrying on a continental war, was
not less pleasing to the Monarch from his native attachments, than to the
people from their natural propensity to arms. As soon as it was known that
Prince Ferdinand had put himself at the head of the Hanoverian army, his
Britannic Majesty, in a speech at the opening of the session of
parliament, observed, that the late successes in Germany had given an
happy turn to his affairs, which it would be necessary to improve. The
com∣mons therefore granted liberal supplies both for the service of the
King of Prussia, and for enabling the army formed in the Electorate of
Hanover, to act vigorously in conjunction with him. Soon after it was
considered, that men would be a more grateful <PB N="246" REF="249"/> supply
than money. The minister who had first come into power and popularity, by
opposing such measures, was now prevailed upon to enter into them with
even greater ardour than any of his predecessors. The hopes of putting a
speedy end to this war, by vigorous measures, his connexions, and, perhaps,
the pleasure he found in giving his Majesty pleasure, incited him eagerly
into a continental war. It is certain, no minister could more powerfully
second a warlike Monarch's intentions; that spirit of enter∣prize which
had, in a measure, taken birth with his administration, he could now direct
at will. The passion for military honour seemed diffused through all
ranks of people; and it only wanted a channel in which to flow. In order to
indulge this general in∣clination, the Duke of Marlborough was sent into
Germany with a small body of British forces to assist Prince
Ferdinand, where they behaved with bravery, and conspired in promoting that
Prince's successes. Each victory they gained, however, only served as a
pretext to call over new forces from Britain, while the English ministry
were taught to believe that every last battle would be decisive. The battle
of Crevelt was fought, in which the Hanoverians and English had the
advantage; but it produced no ef∣fect. The victory of Minden followed; but
laurels seemed to be all that England reaped from the con∣quered field. After
these two victories it was supposed, that one reinforcement more of
British forces would terminate the war in our favour; a reinforcement was
therefore sent. The British troops in Germany now amounted to above thirty
thousand men, yet no advantage of any consequence was the result of this
formidable assistance. War was the trade of some Generals, and, it
must be allowed, a gainful trade it was. Let me therefore, here again, pass
over this continued repetition of marchings, skirmishes, and 
<PB N="247" REF="250"/> rencounters, nor load the page with names of Ger∣man
Generals, too difficult to be pronounced by an English tongue, and equally
grating to a patriot ear. The victories of either side might, in fact, be
con∣sidered as a compact by which something was to be lost on either
side, and no advantage to be acquired. The English, at length, began to
open their eyes to their own interest; nor could all the splendours of
victory so far blind them, as not to see that they were waging unequal war,
and assuming new loads of taxes for conquests they could neither
preserve nor enjoy. Such were the growing discontents of the people, when
the King, who had inspired these measures, unexpectedly died. On the
twenty-fifth day of October, George II, without any previous disorder, was
found by his domestic servants, expiring in his chamber. He had arisen at
his usual hour, and observed to his attendants, that as the weather was
fine, he would walk out. In a few minutes af∣ter this, being left alone, he was
heard to fall down upon the floor. The noise of his fall brought his
attendants into the room, who lifted him into bed, where he desired, in a
faint voice, that the Princess Amelia might be sent for; but before her
arrival he expired. George II. died in the 77<SUP>th</SUP> year of his age, and the 33<SUP>d</SUP>
of his reign, in the midst of victory; and, at that very period, when the
univer∣sal enthusiasm of conquest began to subside for more sober
reflexions. If any Monarch was happy in the peculiar mode and time of his
death, it was he. The factions which had been nursing in his reign, had not
yet come to maturity; and all their virulence threat∣ened to fall upon his
successor. He was himself of no shining abilities; and,
consequently, while he was suffered to guide his German dominions, he
entrusted the care of Britain to his ministers at home. How∣ever, as we
stand too near this Monarch to view his <PB N="248" REF="251"/> real character
without partiality, take the following characters of him, by two writers of
opposite senti∣ments.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline"> "As to the extent of his understanding (says
one) or the splendour of his virtue, we rather wish for opportunities of
praising, than undertake the task ourselves. His public character was
marked with a predilection for his native country, to which he sacrificed all
other motives."</Q></P>
<P> On the other hand, says his panegyrist, 
<Q REND="inline">"On whatever side we look upon his character, we
shall find ample matter for just and unsuspected praise. None of his
predecessors in the throne of England lived to so great an age, or
enjoyed longer felicity. His subjects were still improving under him in
commerce and arts; and his own oeconomy set a prudent example to the nation,
which, however, they did not follow. He was, in his temper, sudden and
violent; but this, though it influenced his behaviour, made no change in his
conduct, which was generally guid∣ed by reason. He was plain and direct in
his in∣tentions, true to his word, steady in his favour and protection to his
servants; nor parting even with his ministers till compelled to it by the
vio∣lence of faction. In short, through the whole of life he appeared rather
to live for the cultivation of useful virtues than splendid ones; and,
satisfied with being good, left others their unenvied great∣ness."</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX.</HEAD>
<P>I Am sorry that praise bestowed on living merit is often found
to injure the goodness it applauds. The character of the successor of
George the second deserves the warmest panegyric; and all who love their
country only wish for a continuance of that spirit, and that virtue which
has hitherto appeared in him. Never did Monarch come to the throne at a more
critical period; the nation, flushed with con∣quest, yet tired of war;
expecting the lowest sub∣mission from their humbled enemies, yet
murmuring under the immense load of their taxes. One part of the people
acquiring immense wealth by the conti∣nuance of hostilities; another
reduced almost to bank∣ruptcy. Besides this, he saw the throne hedged
round by ignorance and faction, men intent only on their own interests, and
willing to persuade Monarchy that whatever conduced to their own wishes was
di∣rected for the welfare of the kingdom. It was in this disposition of
things, that George III. came to the crown. The kingdom began to divide into
two parties; or, more properly speaking, the very same individuals seemed
to wear, at once, a face of joy and discontent. They felt all the triumphs of
their successes, but justly dreaded the consequences of an
expensive continuance of them. The numberless victo∣ries they gained by
sea continued to keep them in spirits, and induced them to supply the
immense ex∣pences of the year with chearfulness. During the whole period of
the war succeeding the execution of Admiral Byng, nothing could be carried on
with more spirit and resolution, than all our naval engage∣ments. In every
enterprize the superior bravery, skill, and dexterity of the English were
obvious. Often with forces very much disproportioned, they 
<PB N="250" REF="253"/> took their adversaries ships, and effectually
disabled the enemies force by sea.</P>
<P>No history can furnish examples of such numerous fleets, or
more active commanders. This desire for victory seemed even to diffuse
itself to the lowest officers; and the captains of privateers seemed as
much enamoured of conquest as with a desire of gain. The Admirals, Hawke,
Howe, Boscawen, Pocock, &amp;c. were always victorious; the Captains, Tyrrel,
Foster, Gilchrist, Lockhart, and others, often fought at a disadvantage,
but never without honour. As an instance of the intrepid spirit of our
seamen in this war, I shall mention one action which posterity, if it
were only singly supported, might look upon as incredible. The annals of
mankind cannot shew an effort of more desperate courage than was exerted
under the command of captain William Death, commander of the Terrible
privateer. He had, in the beginning of his cruize, made prize of a rich
merchant-ship, and with this was returning home to England in triumph, when
he had the misfortune to fall in with the Ven∣geance privateer of St. Malo,
much his superior in force, he having but twenty-six guns, the enemy
thirty-six, and a proportionable number of men. The Terrible's prize was
soon taken, and converted against her; but, though so unequally matched,
cap∣tain Death maintained a furious engagement that cannot be paralleled in the
annals of any country. The French commander and his second were killed, with
two thirds of his company; but much more dreadful was the slaughter on board
the Terrible. When the enemy boarded it, they only found one scene of
slaughter, silence, and desolation. Of two hundred men only sixteen
were found remaining, and the ship itself so shattered as scarcely to
be kept above water.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="254"/> Such were the dear-bought naval victories of
France; and such was the obstinacy of the English, even when defeated,
that the court of Versailles, at length, seemed to demand peace at any
rate. To this request the English were ready to accede, and
Plenipotentiaries were sent from either court to ne∣gociate so wished-for
a reconciliation. France sent to London Mr. Bussy, a man rather skilled
in the arts of negotiation than the open integrity becoming the minister of a
great nation. England sent over, in exchange, Mr. Stanley, to Paris.</P>
<P>It seemed to be a fundamental principle in this treaty, which,
however, proved ineffectual, that each country was to be considered as
possessors of their re∣spective conquests; and that if any such
were to be given up on one side, it was to be only in exchange for such as
had been made by the other. Upon these terms it is obvious, that the
English were likely to be great gainers by a treaty, as they had taken
seve∣ral places and dominions from the French, and had lost only Minorca.
Whether the French had a real desire to proceed upon such terms is
uncertain; however, they soon gave the English ministry suffi∣cient
reasons to be dissatisfied with their proceedings. Mr. Pitt, who had for
a long time been successful, actuated all the English measures, and
guided their councils, had ever disdained that pedantry of po∣litical
refinement, of which others so vainly boast∣ed; he negociated therefore in
a plain simple man∣ner; his guide, sincerity; and his only object, his
country's good. Several points were agreed upon between each nation, that gave
great hopes that an ac∣commodation might speedily be the result. The French
agreed to give up all Canada, a fort upon the river Senegal in Africa, and to
restore Minorca. The chief objects in debate were, the privilege they claimed
of continuing to fish upon the Banks of Newfoundland, and of having the
damages repaired which they <PB N="252" REF="255"/> sustained by the taking
of their shipping before a de∣claration of war. These two points were
warmly negotiated on either side, not without hopes of speedy adjustment,
when, unexpectedly, the whole treaty was, at once, set aside by the
interposition of the Spanish minister, who desired to have the
interests of Spain also included in the treaty. Mr. Pitt very justly
con∣sidered, that as Spain had no part in the war, so it was impertinent in
that power to intermeddle in a treaty of peace; and he regarded this
interposition in its true light, namely, that of a confederacy be∣tween
France and Spain mutually to support each other's interest. Confident
therefore of his own in∣tegrity, and, perhaps, also too much elated by
popu∣lar applause, he began to treat the French negotiator with a great
share of haughtiness, of which he com∣plained to his court at home; and he
was soon re∣called.</P>
<P>This conduct of Mr. Pitt might have justly in∣curred reproach, had
he had no private intimations of a secret alliance between France and Spain.
The last named power had actually entered into a family compact with France,
by which they engaged to car∣ry on a war in conjunction. Of all this the
English secretary had been previously apprized, and proposed in the
privy council to anticipate the designs of Spain by an immediate declaration
of war against her. Vi∣gour, dispatch, and resolution, characterized all
the plans of this minister; he found, however, in the privy council men who
were willing to act with more deliberation, and who desired a certainty of
offence before they demanded a reparation. Spain, they said, has yet given no
certain proofs of their hostile inten∣tions; and the English minister at
the court of Ma∣drid still continues to assure us of their pacific
inten∣tions. These remonstrances were answered by the secretary, but
without producing the desired convic∣tion; seeing himself therefore
almost singular in his <PB N="253" REF="256"/> opinion, he was resolved to
leave an assembly wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he knew
himself maligned; and he threw up the di¦rection of measures, which, to
use his own expres∣sion, he was no longer allowed to guide. The council
was, at that time, divided between two parties, who were both equally pleased
at his resig∣nation. One part consisted of those who were at the head
of affairs during the preceding reign; the other such as had been taken into
favour in this; neither were displeased at the removal of a man whose
po∣pularity threw them into the shade, and whose ve∣hemence controlled
their moderation. But this po∣pular minister's being removed, did not
restore una∣nimity to the council. The parts which were held together by his
presence, now disunited, and a dis∣sention began, which still
continues to subsist.</P>
<P>The declaration of war with Spain, soon after, shewed how
well-grounded Mr. Pitt's measures were, when he proposed a former rupture.
However, the union of France and Spain, and the disunion of our own
ministry at home, did not seem to retard the progress of our arms. The
island of Martinico was conquered by Admiral Rodney and General Monck∣ton;
the island of St. Lucia surrendered soon after to Captain Harvey; Granada
was taken by Briga∣dier Walsh; and all the neutral islands submitted to
the English dominion. But a bolder blow was struck against the Spaniards;
a powerful fleet, and an army of fifteen thousand men, was sent against
the Havan∣nah, the key of all their possessions in South Ame∣rica. It
made a noble resistance; but in the end was taken. And now the enemies of
Great Britain were humbled on every side; the French left with∣out trade or
shipping; the source of Spanish oppu∣lence interrupted; nothing remained
for them, but to ask for peace, upon such terms as we were pleased to
grant. A negociation was accordingly once more begun between the three powers,
by the intervention <PB N="254" REF="257"/> of the King of Sardinia's
Ambassador; the Duke of Bedford was sent over to Paris, and the Duke De
Nivernois came to London; and, at length, the definitive treaty was signed at
Paris by the Duke of Bedford, the Duc De Praslin, and the Marquis De
Grimaldi, and arrived in London February 19, 1763. In order to purchase peace
the French gave up all Canada, their right to the neutral islands, the fort
of Senegal, and their right of fishing on the coasts of Newfoundland and
the gulph of St. Lawrence, but at a certain distance from shore. Spain
also gave up, on her part, the extensive country of Florida; so that the
English empire was thus greatly enlarged; and, if we compute its strength
by the quantity of land included in its dominions, it can now boast more
power than even the great Roman empire.</P>
<P>But no country should build upon remote strength; true power
must always subsist at home. When the branches of a large empire become
more powerful than the original stem, instead of assisting it's
growth, they only overload and exhaust it nourishment. The discontents,
therefore, which many have expressed at the conclusion of the late peace,
that we did not in∣sist upon harder terms, and increase our
possessions, were ill founded, since it is probable we are already
possessed of more than government can manage. There is ever a certain
extent of empire which po∣litics are able to wield; beyond this her
magnificence is but empty pomp, and her size but corpulence.</P>
