<HEAD>THE DEDICATION, To The <HI>QUEEN.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE it Possible for me to offer at your ROYAL FEET, a Tribute, so Important, as to MERIT your MAJESTY'S Acceptance, I had never paid my Debt of Duty, in so poor a Manner; But, since the
<PB REF="5"/>
Smile of HEAVEN, upon the WIDOWS MITE, Instructs us, that the WILL, not POWER, must Enrich the Offering; I am al∣most led to hope, YOUR MAJESTY will Stoop to the Reception of so Low a Present, when you shall be pleas'd to know, 'tis all, I have to give; For LIFE, and FORTUNE are so firmly Yours already, that I cannot hope to tast the Length of one, or Worth of t'other, but by holding BOTH in Your MAJESTY'S Disposal.</P>
<P>THE Sacred Power of PIOUS MAJESTY, Commands not only Love, and Loyalty, from Subjects, and Dependants, but (as the Attra∣ctive Virtue of the Wond'rous MAGNET draws the Sturdy IRON to its Sway,) may Challenge an Authority, to Rule the Salvage Minds of Independant Infidels. The Mighty Glories of your MAJESTY'S Successful Reign have bent more Kingdoms than You Govern, to an Envy of the <HI>BRITONS,</HI> Hap∣py in Your Influences; And Experience Taught me, that while <HI>BRITAINS NAME</HI>
<PB REF="6"/>
is NOW the Praise, and Wonder of such Na∣tions, as BEFORE scarce knew it, The Pro∣digious Honour, paid Her NAME, is on∣ly owing to the Virtues of Her MO∣NARCH.</P>
<P>TO whom then, MIGHTY QUEEN, shou'd I Address my Self for a Protection of my Labours, but to the THRONE of MA∣JESTY, where CRITIC'S Malice, and the Sting of CENSURE cannot Reach me, and where HEAVEN has seem'd to Point our Marks of Duty, and Humility to lie, as by the Seat of MERCY, and the VICEROY of <HI>OMNI∣POTENCE.</HI></P>
<P>BE therefore pleas'd, Great Ruler of the HEARTS, as well as PERSONS of Your People, to accept this humble Offering, which I lay, with Duty at Your GRACIOUS FEET; For, as the small Improvement, ma∣ny Years continued Travels, thro' the Rougher Corners of the World, have made me Consci∣ous of, may so be Crown'd with the
<PB REF="7"/>
Great Honour of YOUR NOTICE, all my Future Aims, and Utmost Applications shall be, how to make my Self attain one Step a∣bove the Character, which now I can with Honesty, and Faithfulness, lay hearty Claim to, of,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was an admirable Observation of Sir <HI>ROGER L'ESTRANGE,</HI> That <HI>a Book, that Fac'd the World without a PREFACE, shou'd be look'd upon, as much Unfinish'd, as a BEAU, who comes to Court without a PERRIWIG;</HI> For it is not only grown a kind of <HI>Law,</HI> by long continu'd <HI>Custom,</HI> but is even become a <HI>Necessary</HI> Labour for the <HI>Vindication</HI> of a Man, who <HI>dares</HI> assume the Name of <HI>Author,</HI> from the <HI>not alone Sharp Criticisms,</HI> but <HI>Reflections,</HI> and <HI>Scurrilities,</HI> he will be sure to meet with.</P>
<P>WE Live, it seems, in a <HI>Fault-finding Age,</HI> and 'tis almost become a <HI>Crime,</HI> or <HI>Argument of Soft∣ness,</HI> (a New-fashion'd Word for <HI>Folly</HI>) in a <HI>Gen∣tleman,</HI> to Read a <HI>Book,</HI> with any <HI>other Aim,</HI> than to <HI>Condemn,</HI> or <HI>Censure</HI> what he Ʋnderstands not.</P>
<P>I'M sure, I have just Reason to affirm a <HI>Truth,</HI> I have been taught by the <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> (I wou'd not wil∣lingly
<PB N="ii" REF="9"/>
make use of a more Sharp <HI>Expression</HI>) of some <HI>Country-Men</HI> of <HI>mine,</HI> who, by the <HI>Baseness</HI> of their <HI>Tempers,</HI> and <HI>Malicious Aims</HI> of <HI>Disappoin∣ted Envy,</HI> took, I hope, more Pains than Ʋsual, to Con∣vince me, that my <HI>Native BRITAIN,</HI> cou'd produce as <HI>Barbarous,</HI> and <HI>Sordid Wretches,</HI> as I ever met with in my Conversation with the <HI>Infidels.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Reasons,</HI> which induc'd me to Address the World, with an Account of what I had observ'd, in <HI>Tra∣velling</HI> so many Years together, were not <HI>Vanity, Am∣bition, Mercenary Hopes,</HI> or any of the <HI>Common Motives,</HI> which urge Great Numbers on to Write, <HI>and build them up</HI> to the <HI>Fond Name</HI> of <HI>Author: Heaven</HI> indu'd me with a <HI>Soul,</HI> too Honest to become a <HI>Prostitute</HI> to the <HI>Poor Dross</HI> of <HI>Interest;</HI> Nor were my <HI>Circumstances</HI> such, as might <HI>reduce</HI> me to a <HI>Want</HI> of those <HI>Advantages,</HI> which have <HI>too often</HI> made a <HI>Good Man, Infamous.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE, <HI>Perhaps,</HI> I found so many <HI>Enemies,</HI> for we are <HI>now</HI> Ʋnhappily Divided into such Disorder'd <HI>Factions, Open Discords,</HI> and Ʋnaccountable <HI>By-Interests,</HI> that <HI>Honesty it Self</HI> is measur'd by <HI>Opini∣on,</HI> and the <HI>Scale</HI> of <HI>Merit</HI> is <HI>Out-ballanc'd</HI> by <HI>Par∣tiality;</HI> so that, when a Man is recommended to the World, <HI>as worth Regard,</HI> The <HI>first Examination,</HI> made a∣bout him is, <HI>Who sides he with?</HI> And a Report is given of his <HI>Capacity,</HI> or <HI>Principles,</HI> according to the <HI>Party,</HI> he may Chance to <HI>Vote</HI> for.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="10"/>
POSSIBLY, I have been represented, as a <HI>Zealous Stickler</HI> for some <HI>Party,</HI> or <HI>perhaps,</HI> been thought to <HI>Side</HI> with <HI>None,</HI> as not too <HI>fond</HI> of <HI>Either;</HI> which of these have made me <HI>Enemies,</HI> I can't determine, or if I have <HI>Enemies at all,</HI> since it <HI>may be,</HI> 'tis the <HI>Fashion</HI> to Discourage VVriters, for endeavouring to take more <HI>Useful Pains</HI> than <HI>other People. Be it one, or t'other,</HI> I can only say, I shou'd (if any) be exempt from <HI>Prejudice</HI> on that Account, since I have been so little <HI>Resident</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> that I never yet found time to <HI>think</HI> on <HI>Par∣ties,</HI> any further than to wish there were no <HI>Ill-divided Ones,</HI> so much as dream't of in the <HI>Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>MY <HI>Friends Perswasions,</HI> when I came from <HI>Tra∣velling,</HI> engag'd me to comply with their Desires, in <HI>Pub∣lishing this Book,</HI> which I more readily Assented to, be∣cause I knew, I cou'd say somewhat more, than had been <HI>seen,</HI> or <HI>told</HI> the <HI>World</HI> by <HI>Former Travellers,</HI> and I was naturally led to hope, my <HI>Youth</HI> might plead a <HI>Pardon</HI> for my <HI>Errors,</HI> since an <HI>Author,</HI> who attempts to <HI>Write</HI> at <HI>Four and Twenty,</HI> might (I thought) be readily Ex∣cus'd for <HI>more Mistakes,</HI> than will, <HI>I hope,</HI> in the <HI>Succeeding Sheets,</HI> disgust the <HI>Reader.</HI></P>
<P>BƲT, there are a sort of <HI>People,</HI> who appear such <HI>Zealous Devotees</HI> to <HI>Malice,</HI> that no <HI>Reasonable Plea</HI> is Proof against 'em, <HI>Innocence</HI> it self is <HI>spurn'd</HI> by their <HI>Presumption,</HI> and they are so <HI>over-fond</HI> of
<PB N="iv" REF="11"/>
<HI>Warring</HI> against <HI>Common Sense, Humanity,</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> that, they generally <HI>blind</HI> their <HI>Judg∣ments</HI> to <HI>indulge</HI> their <HI>Vices,</HI> and <HI>Attack</HI> the <HI>Castle,</HI> where 'tis <HI>ablest</HI> to <HI>Repulse them.</HI></P>
<P>THIS has been my <HI>own Good-Luck,</HI> and the <HI>Ill-Fortune</HI> of my <HI>Censurers,</HI> whose <HI>Weak Objecti∣ons,</HI> spread abroad for <HI>Ends,</HI> I am about to mention, were so <HI>Innoffensively Ridiculous,</HI> as to <HI>swell up</HI> with <HI>huge,</HI> and <HI>threat'ning Venom,</HI> but <HI>then burst like Toads,</HI> with their <HI>Self-dangerous Poyson.</HI> Yet tho' they <HI>hurt</HI> not <HI>me,</HI> their <HI>Guilt</HI> and <HI>Baseness</HI> is not less, than if I had been made a <HI>Sufferer</HI> by their <HI>Ground∣less Malice</HI>: For as the <HI>Poet</HI> has it,

<Q><L>Who <HI>hurts me not,</HI> is not the <HI>Righteous Man,</HI></L>
<L>But <HI>He,</HI> who <HI>will not</HI> hurt me, when he <HI> can.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>THE Society of <HI>Booksellers</HI> have in a manner, quite <HI>engross'd</HI> the <HI>Press,</HI> and the <HI>Unhappy Circum∣stances</HI> of some <HI>Authors,</HI> having given them <HI>Oppor∣tunities</HI> to impose on their <HI>Necessities,</HI> by Purchasing for almost Nothing, their <HI>Ingenious Labours,</HI> and by making all the <HI>Gain</HI> their <HI>own Sole Property,</HI> In∣structed them, like <HI>Sting-less Drones,</HI> to feed upon the <HI>Honey</HI> of <HI>Industrious Bees;</HI> they made Advanta∣ges of <HI>such Occasions,</HI> and <HI>Encroach'd so far,</HI> by
<PB N="v" REF="12"/>
<HI>gradual Advances,</HI> that they us<HI>'d all Authors,</HI> as they did their <HI>Poor Ones,</HI> and <HI>assum'd</HI> not only the <HI>Prerogative</HI> of <HI>Purchasing,</HI> for <HI>Inconsiderable Sums,</HI> the <HI>Brightest Copies,</HI> but pretended to be <HI>Judges</HI> of the <HI>Work it Self;</HI> when, <HI>probably,</HI> they knew not, what it <HI>Treated of.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE they were Encourag'd to Impose upon the <HI>Town,</HI> by Printing <HI>Old Books,</HI> with <HI>New Titles,</HI> Selling Others at a <HI>Double Rate;</HI> and <HI>Authors,</HI> knowing, they cou'd reap no <HI>Profit</HI> from the <HI>Publication</HI> of their <HI>Writings,</HI> left 'em wholly to the <HI>Bookseller's Direction;</HI> whence the <HI>Press</HI> was commonly <HI>Corrected,</HI> and the <HI>Book</HI> ex∣pos'd to <HI>Publick View,</HI> with as much <HI>Nicety,</HI> and <HI>Learning,</HI> as became a <HI>Bookseller's Capacity.</HI></P>
<P>BY having Printed some <HI>Few Little Essays of my own, the Common way,</HI> I went as far, as any <HI>Line</HI> cou'd reach, towards <HI>Fathoming</HI> the <HI>Consci∣ence</HI> of a <HI>Bookseller,</HI> or <HI>Two,</HI> and <HI>thence</HI> became Acquainted with their <HI>Customs,</HI> well enough to care, as little as I cou'd, for Dealing with them; and, unwilling to have This <HI>Book</HI> come out, as <HI>Un∣correct,</HI> as it might probably have done, and see the <HI>Town</HI> impos'd on, by too <HI>High a Price,</HI> or let the <HI>Book come out</HI> too meanly Printed, or on <HI>Com∣mon Paper,</HI> I resolv'd to have it in my <HI>Power,</HI> to
<PB N="vi" REF="13"/>
use the <HI>Buyers,</HI> as I wou'd be us'd <HI>my Self;</HI> and therefore, at my own Charge, undertook the <HI>Printing it,</HI> but was advis'd, (that I might run as little Hazard of a Loss, as Possible,) to do it by <HI>Subscription.</HI></P>
<P>BƲT I was not <HI>thus</HI> deliver'd from the <HI>Impo∣sition</HI> of the <HI>Booksellers,</HI> who pretended it <HI>their Right</HI> to have <HI>Two Books Gratis</HI> for <HI>Six Sub∣scriptions;</HI> I refus'd to grant 'em this <HI>Extravagant Demand,</HI> and gave 'em often <HI>Publick Notice</HI> of my <HI>Resolution,</HI> whereupon, they made it their Endeavour to <HI>decry</HI> the <HI>Book</HI> with <HI>Open Malice,</HI> and discourage it as much as possible: But lest their <HI>Curr-like Howlings</HI> shou'd be <HI>scorn'd, alone,</HI> as <HI>Insignificantly Noisy,</HI> they procur'd some <HI>Little Pensioners</HI> of theirs to Act the <HI>Mastiff,</HI> and by <HI>joining</HI> in the <HI>Consort, bark</HI> the <HI>Base</HI> to their <HI>poor Trebles.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Justice</HI> of the Thing was, what they least regarded, 'twas enough for them to say, 'twas <HI>Bad.</HI> Tho' being ask'd the <HI>Cause,</HI> they cou'd reply no more than, that <HI>'Twas so, because it was so. Ar∣gument</HI> was a <HI>strange Plant,</HI> to their <HI>thin Gar∣dens.</HI> But it must be held, as an <HI>Undoubted Maxim,</HI> That it wou'd be an <HI>Unpardonable Crime,</HI> shou'd <HI>they promote</HI> an <HI>Author's Un∣dertaking,</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="14"/>
who refuses to <HI>promote</HI> their <HI>Lawless Interest.</HI></P>
<P>SOME have had the <HI>Simple Honesty</HI> to bring their <HI>Money</HI> to the <HI>Printer</HI> in a <HI>Rage,</HI> and <HI>Swear,</HI> they never had <HI>Subscrib'd,</HI> but that their <HI>Custo∣mers</HI> oblig'd 'em to it; owning freely, that they did the <HI>Book</HI> the greatest <HI>Injury,</HI> they cou'd, because the <HI>Author</HI> had refus'd to give 'em <HI>Two</HI> in <HI>Six</HI> for No∣thing.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>Sirs,</HI> go on with your Endeavours, I am above the <HI>Reach</HI> of your <HI>Detraction; Gain</HI> I sought not, and for other Matters, let the <HI>Book henceforward</HI> speak, <HI>in its own</HI> Vindication, I am only griev'd for those <HI>Unhappy Writing Gentle∣men,</HI> too much <HI>Depress'd</HI> by <HI>Fortune,</HI> and <HI>thence Subject</HI> to your <HI>Tyranny.</HI></P>
<P>I was grown so weary of the Mentioning the <HI>Book∣sellers,</HI> that I had resolv'd to say no more about 'em, when a certain <HI>Humour</HI> of a <HI>Member</HI> of that <HI>Good Fraternity,</HI> who has the Sign of the <HI>Green Dra∣gon</HI> for Distinction, made me laugh at the <HI>Remem∣brance,</HI> and record him for an <HI>admirable Bargain-Maker.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="15"/>
HE had, with much ado, my Promise, <HI>by a Friends Entreaty,</HI> to allow him <HI>Eight,</HI> as he desir'd, with a <HI>Proviso,</HI> he shou'd take 'em all <HI>Unbound.</HI> But tho' he was <HI>Solicitous</HI> for nothing more, before I granted it, he <HI>humm'd</HI> a while, with a <HI>Wise Air of Con∣templation,</HI> when I sent him Word, he might <HI>Sub∣scribe so,</HI> and reply'd, He thought, that <HI>Nine</HI> 'twixt Man and Man, were very <HI>Reasonable.</HI> Had I granted those, he wou'd have <HI>ask'd for Ten,</HI> and so encreas'd, till I had found, <HI>if possible,</HI> the <HI>Measure of his Conscience.</HI></P>
<P>MY Book lay <HI>Open,</HI> at the <HI>Printers,</HI> as it pass'd the <HI>Press,</HI> for <HI>free Perusal,</HI> and the <HI>Booksellers,</HI> and their <HI>Adherents,</HI> had thereby, an Opportunity to <HI>raise Objections,</HI> with <HI>Pretence</HI> of having read the <HI>Sheets,</HI> but, as I never heard <HI>one Censure yet, deserving Confutation,</HI> or indeed, requiring more than <HI>Com∣mon Sense,</HI> to Overthrow it, so I thought it only fit to let 'em <HI>Sink</HI> without regard, to their <HI>Original Ob∣scurity.</HI> But if there shall be found a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> who meets with any thing, He <HI>justly</HI> may <HI>Object a∣gainst,</HI> Let him be pleas'd to hint it, in a <HI>Letter</HI> for me, Directed to the <HI>Printer's</HI> House; and then, to Sa∣tisfie the <HI>World</HI> and him, I shall not think my Time Ill-spent, to Print it, with as <HI>large an Answer</HI> as is <HI>Necessary,</HI> in the <HI>Preface,</HI> I shall <HI>Publish,</HI> with the <HI>next Edition.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="16"/>
AND now, I leave the <HI>Booksellers</HI> to their <HI>Ad∣vantages,</HI> assuring them, I owe them no <HI>Ill-Will,</HI> and only say thus much, to Justifie my <HI>Book</HI> against their <HI>Calumnies;</HI> If <HI>Profit</HI> cou'd have brib'd my <HI>Tongue,</HI> or Hopes of their <HI>Good Character</HI> have stifled my <HI>Affection to Plain-Dealing,</HI> I had never been so <HI>Open,</HI> in my <HI>Declarations</HI> of their <HI>Artifices; Ju∣stice</HI> always <HI>guides</HI> my <HI>Pen,</HI> nor can <HI>Rewards, De∣sire of Praise,</HI> or <HI>Fear of any Man's Ill-Word,</HI> divert my <HI>Course</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> from its <HI>Direct,</HI> and <HI>Un∣corrupted Channel,</HI> Contrary to the Assertion of the <HI>Celebrated Juvenal.</HI>

<P>SOME <HI>Snarlers</HI> do, and many more <HI>may</HI> Cavil at the <HI>Style,</HI> I have made use of, and the <HI>Weigh∣tiest Arguments,</HI> they bring against it, are, that it appears <HI>Affected,</HI> and <HI>Elaborate;</HI> That 'tis Dress'd in a <HI>Romantic Air,</HI> and that in <HI>short,</HI> 'tis so like <HI>Poetry,</HI> that it runs into <HI>Blank Verse Mea∣sure,</HI> and becomes a kind of <HI>Prose-Poetic</HI> Composi∣tion.</P>

AS I have heard no more <HI>Objections,</HI> that the ve∣ry <HI>Weak Ones,</HI> I endeavour'd to <HI>Confute,</HI> in the <HI>Beginning</HI> of the <HI>Preface,</HI> I can <HI>now</HI> enlarge <HI>no further,</HI> in <HI>Defence</HI> of <HI>Book,</HI> or <HI>Author,</HI> but, since I have made so <HI>fair</HI> an <HI>Offer,</HI> of Obliging <HI>all Objectors</HI> with the utmost Satisfaction, <HI>Truth</HI> can give them, I wou'd willingly perswade my Self to hope, that none will be so <HI>Groundlessly Ill-Natur'd,</HI> as to <HI>force</HI> a <HI>War</HI> with one, who holds the <HI>Peaceful Palm</HI> before him, as a <HI>Tutelary Mark,</HI> for the Pro∣tection of his <HI>Labours.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING sure is <HI>Blacker,</HI> than <HI>Detraction; Hells Wide Store-House</HI> yields no <HI>Sin,</HI> of a more <HI>Damning Nature;</HI> and methinks, no <HI>Subject</HI> of a <HI>Christian Country,</HI> shou'd indulge his <HI>Malice,</HI> by a <HI>Blushless Declaration</HI> of <HI>Egregious Falshoods, with</HI> Design to Stain a <HI>Good-Man</HI>'s Character, <HI>when the Speaking Well of,</HI> nay, <HI>the Using Well those</HI> very <HI>Men, who most</HI> Abuse us, is by the <HI>Divine Decree</HI> of <HI>Christ Himself,</HI> Enjoyn'd us, as a <HI>Duty,</HI> and the very <HI>Maxim</HI> of a <HI>Heathen</HI> in the <HI>following Verses,</HI> serve to <HI>Shame</HI> the Daily Pra∣ctices of many <HI>Men, who</HI> openly <HI>Avow</HI> a Zealous Love of <HI>Conscience,</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Of the Vast Extent of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cause of the <HI>Turks</HI> Success.</NOTE>THE <HI>Turks</HI> arriv'd at their amazing Grandeur from so obscure an Origin, that the invaded World stood won∣dering at their Growing Fortunes, while they shou'd have endeavour'd to repulse, by a vigorous Opposition, the bold Incursions of their encroaching Numbers. And as at this Day they owe the quiet Possession of their former Acquisitions to the Supine Negligence, and Civil Discords of the Christian World; so the same Neglects, and dissonant Interests and Affecti∣ons, first built their Glory on the Entire Subversion of our Jarring An∣cestors. But 'twill be needless to insert here any more of their History than will be found necessary, for the more easy Comprehension of their present Condition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Origin of the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE>WHETHER push'd on by Famine, or expell'd by the prevailing Pow∣er of contending Neighbours, is altogether uncertain, A Body of Adven∣turous <HI>Scythians</HI> forsook their Country, in the Year of <HI>Christ</HI>; 844, and, inur'd to Hardships by the daily Prospects of Familiar Dangers, pass'd o'er the <HI>Caspian Mountains,</HI> and wrested forcibly the Possession of <HI>ARMENIA MAJOR</HI> from its surpriz'd Inhabitants. From the Appellation of its New-come Masters, it receiv'd its present Name of <HI>TƲRCOMANIA,</HI> who strengthen'd by the daily Accession of their Wand'ring Countrymen, grew strongly planted in their Conquer'd Habitation, and were, soon af∣ter, able to send 3000 Men, under the Command of <HI>Tangrolipix</HI> the Chief of the <HI>Selzuccians,</HI> a Family Eminent among them, to the Assistance of <HI>Mahomet</HI> the <HI>Persian Sultan,</HI> who by their prevailing Valour, gave a happy turn to his declining Fortune: But the <HI>Babylonian Caliph</HI> being Over∣thrown, <HI>Tangrolipix</HI> offering to withdraw his Forces, was detain'd unwil∣lingly by the Arbitrary Power of his ungrateful <HI>Ally:</HI> This bred a warm Resentment in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Soldiers, who retiring to a Wood, increas'd

their Numbers by a daily Reception of deserting <HI>Persians</HI>; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ad∣vancement to the Empires of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Babylon.</HI></NOTE>till at last, they Overthrew the <HI>Sultan</HI> in a bloody Battle, and by the mutual Consent of both Armies, <HI>Tangrolipix,</HI> in place of the deceas'd <HI>Mahomet,</HI> was declar'd <HI>Sultan</HI> of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Babylon.</HI> Stupendious Fortune favour'd the Attempts of his active Successors, till the Glorious Expedition of the United Christi∣ans redeem'd the Conquer'd <HI>Syria</HI> from their Usurp'd Dominion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ruin by the <HI>Tartars.</HI></NOTE>Vari∣ous was their future Fortune, sometimes Gaining, sometimes Losing, till the Empire of <HI>Tangrolipix</HI> was wholly Subverted by an unexpected Inun∣dation of the Conquering <HI>Tartars</HI>; <NOTE PLACE="marg">They rise again.</NOTE>To whom the Flying <HI>Turks</HI> abandon'd the Possession of their enlarg'd Dominions, and joining with their Coun∣try-Men of the <HI>Selzuccian</HI> Race in <HI>Asia Minor,</HI> they follow'd the Fortunes of the Successful <HI>Aladine,</HI> who Invading the neglected Corners of the <HI>Graecian</HI> Empire, then Warring with the <HI>Latines,</HI> Possess'd himself of <HI>Cilicia</HI> and the Neighbouring Countries, Erecting, at <HI>Sebastia,</HI> the Arbitrary Throne of a New-won Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Are entirely ruin'd in all Parts.</NOTE>BUT they enjoy'd not long a quiet Possession of their easy Conquests, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arring Sons of <HI>Aladine</HI> dismembred their Dominion by a mutual Opposition to each others Interest, till the fourth King from the Founder of that Monarchy, became a Tributary Vassal to the Victorious <HI>Tartar,</HI> who had now entirely broken their large Empire in the Greater <HI>Asia,</HI> as the Successful <HI>Mamalukes</HI> had drove their Country-Men out of <HI>Egypt</HI>: But the <HI>Tartars</HI> neglecting their numerous Acquisitions, the remaining <HI>Turks</HI> seeing no Power to prevent their Wills, divided with their Inter∣ests, the dismembred Country; And he that had Strength enough to take Possession, enjoy'd the Government of whatever Part his Inclination led him to make Choice of.</P>
<P><HI>ERTOGRIEL,</HI> the Son of <HI>Solyman,</HI> a Principal Member of the <HI>Oguzian</HI> Fa∣mily, had, with an unexpected Supply, successfully Assisted <HI>Sultan Ala∣dine</HI> in a doubtful Battle; and was Rewarded with the Possession of <HI>Siguta,</HI> a <HI>Bithynian</HI> Lordship, in which he settled his separated Family, whose unstable Residence had, till then, oblig'd them to wander thro' the various Mazes of an uncertain Fortune: And after a long and peaceable Possession, having gain'd the Affection of <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> by his mild Disposition, he dy'd in the Year of Christ, 1289, and left behind him three Sons, <HI>Osman, Saragutin,</HI> and <HI>Iundas.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rise and Antiquity of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire.</NOTE><HI>OSMAN</HI> was Elected by the <HI>Oguzians</HI> to his Fathers Government, who taking the opportunity of resenting some Outrages committed by the Neighb'ring <HI>Greeks,</HI> Invaded their Dominions, Overthrew their Armies in several Pitch'd Battles, and having made himself Master of the City of <HI>Nice,</HI> was, after the Death of <HI>Aladine,</HI> Elected to the Dignity of <HI>Sultan,</HI> and reigning 27 Years, he wrested from the <HI>Greeks, Cappadocia, Bithynia,</HI> and most of the Fortify'd Towns which border'd on the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea, till in the Year 1300, he chose <HI>Neapolis</HI> for his Regal Seat, and from thence we date the Original of the present <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Then succes∣sive Conquests.</NOTE><HI>OSMAN</HI> was Succeeded by his Son <HI>Ʋrchan,</HI> whose successful Attempts on the <HI>Graecian</HI> Provinces, so much enlarg'd his Dominions, that he fix'd his Seat of Empire at the Great City of <HI>Prusa</HI>; which retain'd that Ho∣nour until <HI>Mahomet</HI> the First, after several Acquisitions in the <HI>European Greece,</HI> removed it to <HI>Adrianople.</HI> The Successors of this Prince continued their Invasions on the remaining Branches of the <HI>Graecian</HI> Empire, till by the unparallell'd Negligence of the State, then disagreeing with their Em∣perour, they lost their Ancient City <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to the prevailing For∣ces of a Second <HI>Mahomet</HI>; who by this additional Glory, was justly Ho∣nour'd with the Title of <HI>Great</HI>; the Loss of their <HI>Metropolis</HI> was fatally succeeded, by an entire Subversion of their Shatter'd <HI>Empire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="45"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Continuati∣on of their History.</NOTE>THE Successors of <HI>Mahomet</HI> by yearly Acquisitions enlarg'd their Territories in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI>; which at last not contenting them, the Victorious <HI>Selym</HI> extended his Dominion over <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI>; bringing the <HI>Arabians</HI> under his Authority, and raising the Foundation of a Larger Power, on the bloody Ruin of the Subverted <HI>Mamalukes</HI>; since when, the latter <HI>Sultans</HI> have added to their Dominions most of the Islands in the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea; <HI>Rhodes,</HI> with those Noble Knights, who so vigorously De∣fended the Seat of their Order, submitted at last, to the Irresistible Power of the Successful <HI>Solyman; Cyprus</HI> was oblig'd to fall before the Conquering Armies of the Second <HI>Selym</HI>; and since then, so prodigiously have they spread their Conquests, that they now enjoy a free, and unmolested Pos∣session of the Noblest Parts of <HI>Asia, Europe,</HI> and the Remoter <HI>Africa,</HI> on which Extensive Foundation, they have certainly built the most absolute Empire, and Arbitrary Monarchy, that has ever flourish'd since the Worlds Original.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire.</NOTE>FOR First, the <HI>Western</HI> Part of its <HI>European</HI> Dominion, is extended to the very Borders of the once-lost <HI>Hungary,</HI> stretching to the <HI>Adriatick</HI> by the <HI>Ragusean</HI> Confines, bounded on the <HI>South</HI> by the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, on the <HI>East</HI> with <HI>Pontus, Propontis</HI> and the <HI>Aegean,</HI> even to the <HI>Scythian Chersonesus</HI>; <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Russia</HI> scarce bound its <HI>Northern</HI> Limits.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Policy.</HEAD>
<P>THE Political Maxims of an Arbitrary Government, may not improperly be compar'd to the spreading Roots and twisting Fibres of some Tall Oak, whose elevated Heigth exposing it to double Danger, by the raging Force of Stormy Winds a∣mong its Branches, has no Security but the Rooted Depth, by which it is supported against the strongest Efforts of contending Tempests; and certainly a Government so vastly Large, so inexpressibly Rich, and so strangely different from all other, must be supported strongly by some uncommon Policy; without which Guard, the daring Ambition of aspiring Princes, and the formidable violences of intestine Discords, would like some surprizing Earthquake, break fiercely thro' the Bands of Duty, and by their factious Consequences involve the Empire in most inevitable Ruin.</P>
<P>THAT I may with greater ease Describe the solid Foundations, upon which the <HI>Turks</HI> have built their Safety, 'twill be necessary to di∣vide their Maxims into Two Parts. The First, are those by which the <HI>Sultan</HI> supports securely his unrival'd Grandeur, and the sure Dominion of his extensive Empire. The Second, are such Notions as are taught his Subjects with the earliest Rudiments of their common Knowledge, and diffuse with ease a certain Awful Duty, or almost Idolatrous Veneration thro' the whole Country for the Person of their Emperour; and are the only causes of that mild Obedience and miserable Servitude, with which they own themselves his Slaves, and endeavour vigorously to exert an uncommon Industry, in hopes to gain some Mark of Fa∣vour from the inestimable Bounty of their Common Master.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Maxim of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Policy.</NOTE>I shall begin with the <HI>Sultan,</HI> whose first Maxim of Policy is to Depo∣pulate as much as may be the remoter Parts of his wide Empire, the more effectually to strengthen its Center. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reasons upon which this Maxim is founded.</NOTE>The Reasons he gives to prove the Usefulness of this Maxim are these, First, That Countries far di∣stant from his Eye, might with more ease and less danger be induc'd to some fatal Rebellion, were the Number of their Inhabitants but any way proportionable to the Conveniency of their Situation. Secondly, By the miserable and barren Condition of a dis-peopled Country, 'twould be found a matter of inconceivable difficulty, for an Invading Enemy to penetrate their Empire with a numerous Army; since their Troops without the chargeable Inconvenience of vast quantities of Pro∣visions, would never be able to subsist in a Country, whose flying hand∣ful of Inhabitants, would immediately convey what little Stores their Poverty afforded them, to Woods and Mountains, and Places inacces∣sible to People unacquainted with the Passes of the Country: Another Reason is, the utter impossibility, which Discarded Favorites (by this Means) find to escape the Anger of their Offended <HI>Sultan</HI>; for knowing no Place capable of Assisting or Concealing them, unless they Re∣tire to some <HI>Christian</HI> Country, they rather choose a voluntary Re∣signation of their Lives and Fortunes to the undisputed Will of their Great Master; and quietly submit their Necks to the Sword of the Exe∣cutioner.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="48"/>
BUT considering on the other side, that the Strength and Glory of a Prince does chiefly consist in the Numbers of his People, he is ever care∣ful not only to draw to the Center the Conquer'd Inhabitants of his dis∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opled Frontiers; but by the subtle Bait of some inveigling Privi∣leges, is constantly attracting innumerable Quantities of Tributary <HI>Christians,</HI> to Embrace the Doctrine of their Fallacious Religion, and by becoming Members of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith, enjoy the Possession of some little Marks of Distinction, purposely deny'd to their more honest Fel∣lows, who bravely prompted by the Dictates of their Vertue, can with∣out concern despise those gaudy Trifles of a fansied Happiness, and dare prefer the heavy Chains of honest Slavery, to all the guilty Pleasures of an Apostates Liberty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Second Maxim.</NOTE>HIS Second Maxim is, That the only way to preserve a Domestick Quiet, is to employ the Heads and Hands of his Subjects in some Foreign War: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Reasons.</NOTE>The numerous Advantages which accrue from this Maxim are so Conspicuous as scarce to need an Explanation; for by this means he is continually enlarging the Bounds of his Dominions, or at least improving the vast Numbers of his Soldiers, in an Instructive Practice of all the va∣rious and necessary Points of Military Discipline: By these means he pre∣serves himself secure from the sudden Violence of Domestick Rebellion; for the search of Glory firing the Breasts of Officers and Soldiers, they unanimously bend their utmost Endeavours to encrease the Power of their extended Empire, which a lazy Peace might rather prompt them to Destroy: For the working Brains of Men inur'd to War and Dan∣ger, will abhor the Rust of idle Sloth, and stir up gradually an Am∣bitious Fire in the Breast of the Soldier, to lay a sudden hold on some inviting Opportunity, and raise himself to Power and Honour, upon the bloody Ruin of his surpriz'd Commander.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Third Maxim.</NOTE>IN the Administration of his Justice he holds it a necessary Maxim, that a tedious Legality is far more dangerous than a swift Injustice: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Reasons.</NOTE>His Reasons for this are, First, The Fear and Awe which so rigid a manner of Proceeding infuses strongly into the Hearts of his Subjects, making them ever ready to obey his most irrational Commands with an unexampled Willingness; and terrifying their Reflections with so deep a Sense of his Power, as to deter them from the smallest Inclination to a dangerous Disobedience; and Secondly, tho' some by so hasty a Severity may unjustly suffer, yet Numbers are by their Examples fright∣ned from Villanous Actions, whose Natures and Necessities, would o∣therwise incline them, to a constant Practice of the blackest Vices.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourth Max∣im.</NOTE>ANOTHER Maxim teaches them, That Learning is of all things the most dangerous to an Arbitrary Monarchy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Reasons.</NOTE>For First, Was Knowledge encourag'd by the happy Advantages of a liberal Edu∣cation, the Genius of their People would soon become much more re∣fin'd, and consequently the gross Absurdities and fictitious Lessons of their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> be look'd upon with Indignation, when compar'd with the Brighter Doctrine of the Christian Religion. They would soon discover the fallacious Dreams and vain Delusions of their fansied Paradise, and throw off (with their Ignorance) the dull Stupidity of their slavish Ancestors, they would soon perceive the Felicity of other Nations in a Glorious Liberty, and casting off the Yoak they had so long submitted to, attempt unanimously some wondrous Revolution, and weary of a shameful Fate in their so long Subjection to a Tyrannical Govern∣ment, redeem their Honour with their long lost Liberties, and Tri∣umph in the Ruin of their Subverted <HI>Sultan.</HI> Another Reason for this Maxim is, a Notion commonly receiv'd in <HI>Turky,</HI> that the Use of Letters
<PB N="7" REF="49"/>
is altogether inconsistent with the rougher Genius of a Warlike Nation; and that Learning if encourag'd would lull their Faculties in a silent love of Study, till sinking in the soft indulgence of a Philosophical Solitude, they would neglect entirely the more noble Practice of those Martial Exercises, whose successful Application has bravely rais'd them to the glorious Em∣pire, which now distinguishes them from the less Powerful World.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fifth Maxim.</NOTE>BUT above all these, there is One Maxim the constant Care and Secu∣rity of the <HI>Turkish Sultans,</HI> and that is to be serv'd by such Men as they can Raise without Envy, and Destroy without Danger. This they put in Practice by admitting none to the Honour or Trust of great Preferments, but such as have been brought up under the strictest Discipline of a <HI>Seraglio</HI> Education: They are generally the Sons of <HI>Christian</HI> Parents, taken Cap∣tives by the wand'ring Incursions of the Roving <HI>Tartar,</HI> and sent by way of the <HI>Black Sea</HI> to <HI>Constantinople</HI> as to a Common Market: Out of great Numbers of these there are Yearly Chosen a certain Quantity for the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s <HI>Seraglio,</HI> where at their first Admission they are carefully In∣structed in the Rudiments of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language and Religion. Thence proceeding gradually as qualified in Body or Mind, from the laborious Practices of the meanest Drudgeries, to the loftiest Studies of their more Po∣lite Accomplishments, till their Knowledge and Experience encreasing with their Years, they are Preferr'd at last to some Place of <HI>Honour</HI> about the Person of their <HI>Emperour,</HI> and thence advanc'd as Occasion offers to the Government of some Principality, a Seat of Justice, or Command in the Army, whichsoever their Genius has chiefly seem'd to bend them to: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Reasons.</NOTE>And by these Means being Educated from their Infancy with a ser∣vile Awe upon their Spirits, their Endeavours are entirely bent to please their <HI>Sultan</HI>; and starting from so severe a Discipline to the Seat of <HI>Power,</HI> without Friend or Parent to assist them in their Enterprizes, they have no possibility of attempting with the smallest likelihood of Success the least Design against the Interest of their <HI>Sovereign</HI>: But besides this, The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> has another Method no less Politick, to prevent them from making an ill use of the Authority he trusts them with; and that is the frequent Change of Officers, often calling them from one <HI>Government</HI> to take <HI>Pos∣session</HI> of <HI>another</HI> in some far distant Part of the <HI>Country</HI>; by which means having no time to fix an Interest with the People that are under them, they are absolutely debarr'd from the smallest Hopes of Success in an At∣tempt against the <HI>Person</HI> or <HI>Power</HI> of their <HI>Sultan,</HI> who seldom continues them so long as Three Years in one Place; and as if in that time there was danger of a <HI>Revolt,</HI> takes care by other Methods to render it still more impracticable, for giving them no Money, when he prefers them to a <HI>Go∣vernment,</HI> and themselves Possessing nothing but what they receive from his Bounty, they are oblig'd to borrow great Sums on Credit to furnish out their Equipage, for which the <HI>Christian</HI> Merchants exacting often <HI>Cent per Cent</HI> Interest; they have no other way to pay these Debts, than by a bar∣barous Oppression of the <HI>Provinces</HI> they are sent to, and knowing their time to be but short, they seldom fail by Arbitrary Methods to enrich them∣selves for ever after, by a Three Years Plunder of the poor Inhabitants; by which means they become odious to the People, who would be so far from assisting them against the <HI>Sultan,</HI> as readily to embrace the smallest Oppor∣tunity for revenging their Misfortunes in the Death or Ruin of their Tyran∣nick Governour; By which the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Power stands more unshaken than that of <HI>Christian</HI> Princes, who have too often suffer'd by the Ambitious Inclinations of Rebellious Subjects.</P>
<P>THESE are the most noted Maxims of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Policy, whereby the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperours maintain an uncontroul'd Authority over their so vast Dominions: Others there are, which being taught the People as Es∣sential
<PB N="8" REF="50"/>
Points of Duty and Religion, oblige them quietly to bend their Necks, and calmly stoop to the galling Yoak of an Ignoble Slavery.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixth Maxim.</NOTE>AND First, Obedience to the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Will is taught them as a Duty, the neglect whereof, will draw down the Curses of God and <HI>Mahomet</HI> up∣on themselves and their Posterity: His Word must ever be a settled Law, and Infallibility a peculiar Perfection of his Nature: None dare believe he errs, and tho' his Actions appear altogether inconsistent with Reason or Humanity, they must rather question the perspicuity of their Senses, than presume to think he ever can be guilty: Nay, so widely has this crafty Lesson spread its Doctrine, that to die by the Hand or Mandate of their Emperour, is look'd upon by these deluded Wretches as a never failing Passport to the Gates of Paradise; and so Sacred a Veneration do they pay to the Person of this Idoliz'd <HI>Sultan,</HI> as if his People were destin'd as an in∣ferior Species of Mortality, to serve the mighty End of his Creation: The better to support this awful Sense of Fear and Duty, the Expounders of their Law have fix'd a Notion in the Superstitious Breasts of the Common Peo∣ple, that they can never pay too deep a Veneration to the Person of their Emperour, since the good or evil Fate of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire depends entirely on the Preservation or Extinction of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Family.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seventh Max∣im.</NOTE>ANOTHER Maxim among the <HI>Turks</HI> declares, That Merit is the only valuable Nobility, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Reasons.</NOTE>whereby the Meanest of their People exert their ut∣most Industry in the pursuit of Honour, as knowing they must owe their Fortune to their own Personal Worth, and not the Hereditary Possession of Lands and Tenements from the successful Labours of industrious Ancestors, for the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> is the common Heir to all Mens Estates, and distri∣buting some small Part among the Children, leaves them to cut out their own way to Riches and Preferment, and throws in the remainder amongst the numerous Heaps of his own prodigious Treasure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eight Max∣im.</NOTE>ANOTHER Opinion not a little conducive to the <HI>Turkish</HI> Interest is, That those who die in Battle against a <HI>Christian</HI> Enemy are immediately Transported into Paradise, as a Reward for their Courage. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Reasons.</NOTE>'Tis no great difficulty to guess the Effects of such a Notion on the thoughtless Crowd, who are thereby at all times willing to Invade a <HI>Christian</HI> Country, and hur∣ried forward to a zealous Madness by so encouraging a Doctrine, fall rash∣ly on, and prove too often fatal Instruments of Death and Vengeance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ninth Maxim.</NOTE>THERE is another Maxim of their Policy, which seems to have been owing to the vast Successes of their Arms in the Infancy of their Em∣pire, and that is, To look upon Prosperity as an infallible Sign of God's owning the Justice and Legality of their Endeavours: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Reasons.</NOTE>By these Means they have encourag'd their Armies to a constant Assurance of repeated Successes, from the favourable Consequences of one single Victory, and drawn in pro∣digious Numbers of Voluntary Soldiers to the assistance of a Cause, which such propitious Omens had induc'd them to believe must necessarily entitle them to the Smiles of Providence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tenth Maxim.</NOTE>THERE is a Law amongst the <HI>Turks,</HI> which I believe was introduc'd from an ancient Maxim of their Political Government, strictly prohibiting all Subjects to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> from Travelling for Improvement of their Knowledge and Experience, into any Country not under his Authority, especially such Parts of the World as are enlightned by the Heavenly Rays of <HI>Christian</HI> Doctrine; and so very nicely is this Law observ'd amongst them, that he who is accus'd of having broken it without a positive Order or Permission from the Court, is often punish'd in an Exemplary manner, and his Goods and Chattels forfeited thereby, to whatsoever Use the <HI>Sultan</HI> shall assign them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="51"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Reasons,</NOTE>THE numerous Advantages arising to their Government from so strict a Prohibition of a Custom, so diverting to the curious Inquisitions of our <HI>Europaean</HI> Gentlemen, are so obvious to the Judgment of a Common Reader, that they hardly need a farther Explanation; since every Body must per∣ceive, the chief Design of this so useful Maxim was to Cloak the Fallacies of their deceitful Doctrine, from the hoodwink'd Eyes of its Professors, whose clouded Apprehensions, fatally Illuminated by a <HI>Christian</HI> Conversa∣tion, might probably be brought to an entire Discovery of that inglorious Servitude in which they live, and tempt their Courage to assume new Fire, and redeem their Minds from an Erroneous Superstition, while they brave∣ly chang'd the base Subjection of their Insulted Bodies for the generous En∣joyment of a Nobler Liberty: And how far the continuance of this subtle Maxim may be serviceable to their Interest, does beyond dispute appear in the good Effects it has hitherto produc'd; and the frequent Insurrections and intestine Jarrs that almost Yearly happen on such of their Frontiers, as by their nearness of Situation to the <HI>Christian</HI> Countries, have render'd their Inhabitants no ways Strangers to the difference of their Government.</P>
<P>MANY besides these are the Political Maxims of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Nation, but I shall content my self with having nam'd the Chief, and those on which they build the Pillars of their Constitution; and will proceed in the next Chapter to give as full an Account as I can of the peculiar Form and artful Management of their <HI>Civil Government.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Civil Government of the <HI>Turks.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TIS Perhaps the most difficult Undertaking a Man can put himself upon, to write of the numerous Intricacies of Foreign Govern∣ments, and particularly One like that of <HI>Turkey</HI>; the Native Haugh∣tiness of whose Insulting People, and their coy Deportment to the Travelling Subjects of a <HI>Christian</HI> Country, are so many inaccessible Barriers to the Curiosity of their Observations: But 'tis a Task yet more difficult to endeavour a satisfactory Description of that Part of their Consti∣tution which composes this Chapter, since the Offices of their Religion are so closely interwoven with those of their Law, that 'tis almost impossible to treat of either without involving both in a promiscuous Confusion.</P>
<P>HOWEVER that I may the more easily avoid the disagreeable Ob∣scurity of so unnecessary a Conjunction, I shall gradually proceed to an Ac∣count of the Places of Trust and great Offices of their Empire, as they now differ from, or are dependant on, each other.</P>
<P>BY the foregoing Chapters, the prodigious Power and unlimited Autho∣rity of the <HI>Turkish Sultan</HI> has been fully taught the Reader: But tho' his Rule is Arbitrary, and his Sway Despotick and Tyrannical, he submits the Management of his Large Dominions to the depending Government of a deputed <HI>Viceroy</HI>; and indeed it has ever been the Custom of the <HI>Eastern</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="52"/>
Emperors to Constitute some favour'd Subject in a Degree of Honour next themselves, a Custom by many Authors condemn'd, as owing its Instituti∣on to the slothful Disposition of some Inglorious Monarch, wholly given up to Ease and Luxury; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Policy of Constituting a <HI>Vice-roy</HI> a great Support of the Sultans Power.</NOTE>but in my Opinion founded on the subtle Maxims of a deeper Policy; for by these means, the Emperours may not only, when they please, unbend their Minds from the fatiguing Cares of an intangled Government, but when the growing Anger of their injur'd Subjects provoke them to a Resentment of their oppressive Cruelties, they throw the odium of their own Injustice upon their Guiltless <HI>Viceroy</HI>; who skreening the Mis∣carriages of his Imprudent <HI>Sultan</HI> from the Revenge of a Rebellious Multi∣tude, becomes himself the Object of their Hatred, and lays the Foundati∣on of his Masters Safety, on the Peaceful Consequences of his own Destructi∣on.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of Creating a <HI>Grand Vizier.</HI></NOTE>THIS Officer among the <HI>Turks</HI> is distinguish'd by the Title of <HI>Vizier Azem,</HI> or Councellour in Chief to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> from whom all Power is immediately deriv'd to him, and by whom he is Created without any o∣ther Ceremony than the delivery of a large Golden Seal, whereon is En∣grav'd the Name and Age of the then Reigning <HI>Sultan</HI>; this Seal he always carries in his Bosom, and becomes thereby Invested with an Authority al∣most as Arbitrary and Unlimited as that of the Emperour himself.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Antiqui∣ty of this Office.</NOTE><HI>AMƲRATH</HI> the Third was the Institutor of this Office, at a time when breaking into <HI>Europe,</HI> he conferr'd the Dignity of General and Chief Councellour on one <HI>Lala Schabin</HI> his Tutor, since which time his Successors have continued to appoint some favour'd Subject to the Dignity of <HI>Vizier Azem,</HI> and honour those Officers with the Name of Tutor as often as they hold Conversation with them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Business and Authori∣ty.</NOTE>THE <HI>Vizier Azem,</HI> as in Title, so in Power, is the Head and Mouth of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Law; to him Appeals are brought from all their Courts of Judicature, and by him the former Sentences of Inferiour Judges are frequent∣ly disannull'd, and the Cause decided in favour of the Party who before had lost it. There lies no Appeal beyond him, unless to the Person of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>; and that so very difficult, that 'tis very rarely put in Practice. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of Appealing to the Grand Signior.</NOTE>The manner of doing it is so odd and different from the <HI>Europaean</HI> Customs, that the Reader will be inclin'd to pardon the Digression if I describe the Ceremony as briefly as is possible: At certain Hours of the Day, when the Gates of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> are set open for the Admittance of great Numbers of Citizens and Others, whose Business with the Officers of that Place require their daily Attendance there, the Persons who would complain of any grievous Injury they have suffer'd, and which the Injustice or Connivance of the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> has refus'd to redress, enter hastily the Outward Court, and putting Pots of Fire upon their Heads run swiftly forward, nor dare the greatest Officer presume to stop them, till they arrive in the Presence of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> and humbling themselves at his Feet, declare the weighty Wrongs they labour under, and implore the gracious Mark of his unquesti∣on'd Justice in a kind Redress of their Oppressive Injuries.</P>
<P>THERE is a private <HI>Divan</HI> or Court of Justice held in the Palace of the <HI>Vizier Azem</HI> every Wednesday and Thursday; on the other Days (ex∣cepting Friday, which is the <HI>Turkish</HI> Sabbaoth) the <HI>Divan</HI> is kept in an open Chamber of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> whither the <HI>Vizier</HI> is magnificently Attended by a great number of Pursuivants and Serjeants; at his Arrival he is saluted with the noisy Acclamations of the People, and guarded by a sort of Soldiers, maintain'd purposely for that Use, to his Place upon the Bench; where be∣ing Seated with the <HI>Cadeelescheer</HI> or Lord Chief Justice, and Six <HI>Viziers</HI> of the Ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, who are Grave Men that have formerly born Offices in the Govern∣ment,
<PB N="11" REF="53"/>
and are skill'd in the Knowledge of their Law, but not permitted to give their Opinions on any Point unless demanded by him. He listens to the Judgment of the Lord Chief Justice, who hears and determines all Causes, unless the <HI>Vizier</HI> shall disapprove his Sentence, and Reverse it as he thinks is most agreeable to the Justice of the Cause, or his own pri∣vate Inclinations.</P>
<P>THUS much may serve as to the Judicative Power of the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> but is far from expressing the utmost Limits of his Authority, which ex∣tends its self so far beyond that of the other Great Officers of the Empire, that tho' he cannot by virtue of his own immediate Order take off their Heads, or recall them from their Governments, he has so great an Interest in the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> that he can, without the smallest Difficulty obtain his Warrant for the Displacing or Beheading any Officer at Court or else∣where, who has unfortunately disoblig'd him, or stands obnoxious to the danger of his Envy.</P>
<P>IN time of War he has the Command in Chief of the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Armys, and leads them where he pleases, without the least necessity of waiting for his Master's Order. He gives Audience to the Embassadors of Foreign Princes, Receives and Answers the Contents of their Memorials, and is in short the only Master of the Executive Power over the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s whole Dominions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Splendour of his Court.</NOTE>ANSWERABLE to the vast Authority of this great Officer is the pompous State in which he Lives; his Court consisting frequently of Five and Twenty Hundred Servants, including the Officers about him; when he appears Abroad he is distinguish'd not only by the Splendour of his Equi∣page, but the bearing on the fore part of his Turbant Two large Feathers, set on with a great Knot of Diamonds and other Jewels of inestimable Va∣lue, the peculiar Mark of his Degree, the <HI>Bashaws</HI> being permitted to wear but One, and the <HI>Sultan</HI> himself never appearing with more than Three: Three Horse-tails are carried before him on a lofty Staff, another distinguishing Mark of his Authority. Great Numbers of stately Horses adorn'd with Trappings of Gold and Silver set thick with Precious Stones are led before him; his Stirrops held by the obsequious Hands of his sur∣rounding Slaves, and his Garment kiss'd with the most profound Respect by endless Crowds of prostrate Officers, whose servile Souls encline their Actions to the basest Practice of a vile Subjection to Men by Fortune plac'd above them, while they basely Triumph over the miserable Wretches that are under their Command, with all the haughty Marks of an insul∣ting Arrogance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Revenues and Advanta∣ges.</NOTE>PRODIGIOUS and beyond Belief are the amazing Profits arising from this Post to the Coffers of its Possessor: For tho' the Revenues of the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> or his immediate Salary from the Crown does scarce exceed Five Thousand Pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> 'tis yet impossible to guess the vast Ad∣vantages it brings him; for besides the great Sums of Money he receives from the Numbers of his Petitioners, who, be their Business of what nature it will, dare never move it empty Handed, there are daily Rivolets of Plenty from all Parts of the Empire flowing to his Treasury: No Subject to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> dares enter on a Place of Power, till by the moving Rhetorick of some considerable Present he has brib'd the Favour of the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>; without which he is always sensible his Head will surely pay the Forfeit of his Avarice. There are certain times of the Year, when all the Governours of Provinces are oblig'd to send Presents to the <HI>Sultan,</HI> after the manner of our <HI>New-Years-Gifts,</HI> and tho' there is no Obligation which compels them at that time to remember the <HI>Vizier,</HI> a fatal Experi∣ence
<PB N="12" REF="54"/>
of the Consequences of such a Neglect has often convinc'd them, that, tis highly Dangerous to forget him; The Rulers of the Remotest Branches of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire are Oblig'd to Court his Favourable Re∣presentation of their services with the Perswasive Oratory of their Golden Messengers, and in short no Man who omits his Duty this way can reason∣ably hope a long Possession of his Honours or Preferments.</P>
<P>BY these means a <HI>Vizier</HI> of a Covetous Disposition, who loses no Advantage he may Reap from his Authority, has such Incredible Oppor∣tunities of Encreasing his Wealth, that many at the Death which generally Attends their short liv'd Splendor, have been found Possessors of such Im∣mense Heaps of Treasure as have Equall'd if not exceeded that of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> their Master; But those very Riches which still render this High Office desireable in the Emulative Breasts of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Candidates, are the very Poyson of its Pleasures, and to a Genius blest with a se∣rious Contemplation on the Frailties of Humanity would open all the dangers of its Gawdy Glories and rather frighten him from their search than allure him to their Possession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Office of <HI>Vizier,</HI> a Dangerous Station.</NOTE>FOR few there are who long enjoy the Slippery Honours of this wish'd Preferment; the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Policy forbids a long Permission of such un∣bounded Power, and urges him to frequent changes of such dangerous Officers, nor are there many, who survive the loss of this High Post, for having some time serv'd like a necessary Sponge to gather Riches for the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s use, he Squeezes them at last into his own vast Treasure; and to free himself from all the fears of their Resentment, invents some Plausible pretence to take them off and put others in their Place, to grow up Gradually to the same Fate their Predecessors met with</P>

<P>THESE are the certain Salaries settled by the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> on the several <HI>Beylerbeys</HI> above-mention'd, but as I hinted before, are seldom the twentieth Part of the Profits into which they improve their Em∣ployments.</P>
<P>THE Provinces contain'd in these Twenty Two Arch-Dukedoms are at least Two Hundred and Sixty Four, every one of which, as I said be∣fore, has a Lord Provincial over it, whose Profits may be computed about half as much as those of the <HI>Beylerbeys</HI> their Superiour Governours: The <HI>Beys</HI> and <HI>Aga</HI>'s possessing smaller Salaries in a just Proportion to the Infe∣riority of their Offices: The <HI>Bashaws</HI> are all entitled to Revenues agree∣able to their Power, and both the one and the other are alike un∣bounded.</P>
<P>BY the prodigious Sums of Money amass'd this way, which any Cu∣rious Reader may nearly compute by the Account above-mention'd, and which, in comparison with the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Revenues, are as so many small Canals to the unfathom'd Ocean; you may guess at the surprizing Gran∣deur and inexhausted Riches of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperours, which shall be particularly Treated of in a more proper Place; I shall now proceed to inform the Reader in what manner the <HI>Turks</HI> Administer their Justice, and how the Forms of Law are practis'd by that People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Maxim of <HI>Tacitus.</HI></NOTE>'TWAS the Opinion of <HI>Tacitus</HI> that those Governments have most Laws who have least Policy, and the strenuous Support which the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire receives from few but necessary Maxims, does in a great measure justifie the Truth of his Assertion; for they have no confounding Volumes of one Lawyers Observations upon the Remarks of another, no <HI>COKE</HI> upon
<PB N="16" REF="58"/>
<HI REND="blackletterType">Littleton,</HI> to explain the different Interpretations of a Thing, that is, or ought to be the same: The Reports of such a Judge, or such a Lord Chancellour, have here no Power to guide the Sentence of a Court of Justice, by the prevailing Virtue of some forgotten Precedent: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The speedy dispatch of <HI>Turkish</HI> Justice.</NOTE>Their Laws are few, but always put in Execution with the utmost Severity; and tho' the Sentence <HI>Pro</HI> or <HI>Con</HI> depends entirely upon the undisputed Will of an Arbitrary Judge, whereby the Subject is depriv'd of that indulgent Liberty we tast in <HI>Britain,</HI> and sometimes Sacrific'd to the mercenary In∣terest of a brib'd Decider, he has yet this Happiness superiour to us, that he always loses a Cause before the melancholy Consequences of a tedious Controversy has disabled him to support that Loss, and depriving him of all possible means of a future Subsistance, unfortunately sink both the Cause and the Client in promiscuous Ruin, by one single Act of an unexpected Injustice.</P>
<P>THE Truth of this will evidently appear by the speedy Dispatch of their decisive Sentence, having no Form of Law but this which follows. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Deeds and Instru∣ments.</NOTE>What∣ever Land, Moneys, Goods, or any of the common Benefits of Life are bought by, or given to a Subject of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Dominions, or any other Inhabitant of that Empire, must be confirm'd to his Possession by virtue of a Seal'd Instrument call'd an <HI>Hodget,</HI> which being Sign'd by the <HI>Kaddee</HI> or Judge of the Place they live in, does certainly entitle them to as firm a Property as all the Deeds of Gift, Releases and other endless heaps of Parchment now in use amongst us; such an Instrument being once pro∣duc'd admits of no evasive Quirk to weaken its Authority; no Word mis∣plac'd, or Name mistaken by the adding or omitting some single Letter can baffle the Legality of a Subjects Endeavours by the Shock of a Nonsuit, but where the Justice of a Cause is undeniably conspicuous they very rare∣ly suffer by a partial Sentence; tho' where the Case is doubtful or obscure, the native Avarice of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Judge will generally incline him to a favou∣rable Opinion of that Side from whence most Money challenges his Grati∣tude; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bribery com∣mon among them.</NOTE>nor is the Curse of Bribery esteem'd so black a Crime in this Coun∣try as in the <HI>Western</HI> World, most Men practising it in a publick and au∣dacious Manner, wheresoever their occurring Interests make it Usefull.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Womens Oaths not taken.</NOTE>WOMENS Oaths are never taken but against a <HI>Christian,</HI> nor a <HI>Christians</HI> against a <HI>Turk.</HI> Among themselves the concurring Evidences of a plurality of Witnesses decide a Controversy. Their Punishments are either Bodily or Pecuniary; the first are rarely suffer'd when not deserv'd, but the latter sometimes inflicted unjustly by the malicious Prosecution of re∣vengeful People, or the partial Sentence of some poor and avaritious Ma∣gistrate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Office of a Saubashaw:</NOTE>THERE is no City which has not its <HI>Saubashaw</HI> or Head Constable o∣ver it, whose proper Business it is, to inspect as secretly and as narrowly as possible the Behaviour of the Inhabitants, having his inferiour Officers in e∣very Corner to detect the Misdemeanours of offending People, and seizing their Persons, deliver them over to such Punishments as upon Convicti∣on of their Guilt shall be judg'd agreeable to the nature of their Of∣fences.</P>
<P>THE Corporeal Punishments in use among the <HI>Turks</HI> are different, according to the several Crimes for which they are impos'd; the most Common, and that which is inflicted on Slaves, Servants, and the Practi∣cers of <HI>Petty-larcenys,</HI> is the Bastinado, or beating them on the Soles of the Feet. The method of putting this in Execution is as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="59"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Excecuting the Punish∣ment call'd Bastinado.</NOTE>FIVE or more Officers seizing the Offender by the Arms, conduct him roughly to some smooth piece of Ground or Grass-plat, where throw∣ing him upon his Back, the heaviest among them sitting down upon his Breast, prevents him from springing upwards to avoid the Blows, when two others by the help of a large Stick like the handle of a Broom, bor'd thro' at both ends, to receive a Rope there fastned by two Knotts, and hanging down in a bent Form like that of a Bow, lift his Legs from the Ground, and rowling the Stick downwards as far as the Rope permits them, prevent them from moving either one way or the other; this done another with a stiff Hazel Wand gives him as many Strokes upon the naked Soles of his Feet as he was order'd to undergo, which are some∣times several Hundred, and have often prov'd Mortal to the guilty Party.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Comical Story of an <HI>English</HI> Mer∣chant.</NOTE>I cannot forbear the Crime of a small Digression, to divert my Reader with the Comical Relation of a certain Passage, which once in this Coun∣try afforded me the pleasure of a very agreeable Amusement: There was an <HI>English</HI> Merchant who had for many Years been troubled with the <HI>Gout,</HI> in a very violent and uncommon Degree, nor could the daily Application of the richest Medicines procure him Ease, much less the Cure he sought in vain for, insomuch that being in a manner transported by the sharpness of his Pain, he became so very peevish that he could neither talk, walk, or sit still in Comfort: The pressure of this Gentleman's extraordinary Affairs requiring his presence at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> he undertook the Journey with a great deal of uneasiness, and met at the Entrance of a Town call'd <HI>Baba,</HI> a considerable Party of <HI>Turkish</HI> Soldiers, who were marching towards <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI>; the Officer, as is common in those Parts, took the liberty as he pass'd, to express himself a little disrespectfully in contempt of the <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> in the Merchant's Company; and he, unqualified at that time by the peevish Effects of his Distemper, to bear it patiently, made an ill Use of his Skill in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language, and return'd the Salutation as roughly as it was sent him: The Inhabitants of that Country are of all others least able to bear Reflections on their Government or Religion; and the Officer of these Men, forgetting that himself had been the Aggressor, resented the Affront so very highly, that he order'd the Merchant to be taken from his Horse, and undergo the Punishment of One Hundred and Fifty Basti∣nadoes in the manner above written: Vain was Resistance against a Num∣ber so much Superiour, and Complaints were altogether useless in a Country where the speedy Execution of an Arbitrary Order is the high∣est Qualification they believe themselves capable of: In short, the poor Merchant submitted aukwardly to the unwelcome Novelty, and was so sorely beaten on the Soles of his Feet, that for many Days he was oblig'd to continue in a House at <HI>Baba,</HI> nor was he able to stand upright for a long time after; but the Jest of this Story comes in the Conclusion, for the Bastinadoes it seems having frightned away his Gout, his Distemper went off with his Bruises, nor was he ever troubled with the return of one single Fit from that time forward: The unexpected Consequence of this lucky Beating, oblig'd the Merchant at his return to <HI>Constantinople</HI> to seek industriously after the Author of his Cure, that he might thank him for the Favour, but not being able to find him out, he contented himself with a grateful remembrance of the weighty Obligation, and to this Day (if he be still alive) as constantly Drinks to the Health of his <HI>Turkish</HI> Doctor as he sits down to his Table.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Subject in hand, they have several Punishments peculiar to the Military and other Orders, which shall be describ'd here∣after in their proper Place: One now in common Use amongst them is Impaling Alive; that is, thrusting in a sharp Pole at their Fundaments,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of Impal∣ing Alive.</NOTE>and Forcing it out at the Upper Parts of their Body, and so Fast∣ning the Pole upright in the Ground they leave them in some High way as Miserable Examples to Deterr others from the like Practices.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Pu∣nishments in use there.</NOTE>STRANGLING in a very Expeditious manner is the Death whereby they distinguish Suffering Noblemen. Hanging they seldom use; Breaking on the Wheel very Rarely; but the most common way of Execution is, Beheading the Condemn'd Person with a Broad <HI>Scy∣metar,</HI> while he Kneels upon a large Heap of Sand to that end pro∣vided. Other kinds of Punishments there are in <HI>Turkey,</HI> but such as be∣ing very rarely put in Practice, are altogether needless to be here mention'd and for that reason purposely omitted.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A great de∣cay in their Military Dis∣cipline.</NOTE>BUT tho' the present Managment of their Military Discipline falls greatly short of what in former Ages spoke them Matchless, they are not yet so sensibly Decayed, as to become an easy Conquest, were the United Arms of Warlike Christendom now bent against them; for tho' their Souldiers are not now Inur'd to War and Hardship, nor by the Frequent Victorys they were us'd to gain, familiar with the Face of Ruin and continual Contest, they are not less in Num∣ber

than they were, nor all so Ignorant as their Majority. The <HI>Turk∣ish</HI> Policy permits no loss of Power by the loss of Souldiers, and is perhaps the only Government that e'er grew Stonger by the Death of Subjects; for having Numbers ready upon all Occasions to Supply the Room of such as Die, their Places are Improv'd to double Worth by a surprizing Management peculiar to the <HI>Turks,</HI> which shall be told the Reader in its proper Place. They have no occasion on declaring War, or losing Battles, to dispatch their Officers for fresh <HI>Recruits</HI> about the Country, and supply with raw unpollish'd <HI>Rusticks,</HI> the Places of well disciplin'd and skilful Soldiers; They have formidable standing Armies, in every Corner of their Empire, which from time to time supply the Vacancies of their <HI>contending</HI> Bodies, which like the boundless Ocean tho' discharging endless Depths of Water appears no less in <HI>Ebb</HI> than <HI>Flow,</HI> but stands the same in every Season, never subject to perceptible <HI>Di∣minution.</HI></P>
<P>IN describing the present Establishment of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces, I will begin with that Order of Foot Soldiers commonly known by the Name of <HI>Janisaries</HI>; for the peculiar and remarkable Privileges whereby they are di∣stinguish'd from the ordinary Militia, may justly intitle them to the Ho∣nour of a Preference. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The derivati∣on and Ori∣ginal of the Word <HI>Janisa∣ry.</HI></NOTE><HI>Janisary</HI> is nothing but a Corruption of the Word <HI>Yani-Cherr,</HI> which in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language, signifies a <HI>New-Order</HI>; they took their Original from the Death of one <HI>Hodgy Bectash,</HI> an Old Religious Man of an <HI>exemplary</HI> Life and Conversation, in the Reign of <HI>Sultan Amu∣rath,</HI> the third King of the <HI>Turks</HI>: This Man had long endeavour'd to dissuade <HI>that</HI> Prince from dangerously exposing his Person, by too near a Familiarity with the Subjects of <HI>Servia,</HI> often Prophesying the sudden Death which afterwards befel the <HI>Sultan</HI> upon the Overthrow of <HI>Lazarus</HI> the Despot of that Country, when walking out to view the Heaps of Slain, one <HI>Miles Corbelitza,</HI> a <HI>Christian</HI> Soldier, rising heavily from a Mount of Carkasses, made shift to stagger in the Pangs of Death, and by expressive Motions of his Head and Hands desir'd admittance to the Person of the Emperour, who thinking he design'd to beg his Life permitted him to such a near Approach, that the undaunted <HI>Servian,</HI> falling on his Knees as if he would have sued for Mercy, snatch'd out a Dagger from his <HI>bleeding</HI> Bosome, and striking it with violence to the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Heart, reveng'd successfully his Countries Wrongs, and liv'd and dy'd like <HI>Israel</HI>'s <HI>Sampson</HI> a double Scourge to an Ambitious Enemy.</P>
<P>THE Death of <HI>Bectash</HI> immediately succeeded that of <HI>Amurath,</HI> for having often prophesy'd the Blow and not preventing it, tho' near the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Person, he was cut in pieces by the furious Guards, as a <HI>Party</HI> in the Treason; but foreseeing easily, what Fate would soon befall him, he rent off a long Sleeve, which he wore continually on his Right Arm, and putting it upon the Head of one of the Soldiers, cried out prophetically in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language,
<Q><L>Life from my Death shall like a Phoenix spring,</L>
<L>To Guard from Dangers your Succeeding King.</L></Q></P>
<P>THIS said, he Fell, a bloody Victim to the Soldiers Anger, but had his <HI>Prophecy</HI> compleatly verifi'd in the First Year of the next <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Reign, who reflecting seriously on the Fate of <HI>Bectash,</HI> resolved to take some Me∣thod of <HI>perpetuating</HI> his Memory, and Instituted a New Order of the Mili∣tia, by the Name of <HI>Janisaries,</HI> who to this Day in Imitation of the Sleeve which <HI>Bectash</HI> put upon the Soldiers Head, are all obliged to wear a Head∣piece fac'd with pollish'd Steel, to which is fastned a large piece of <HI>Buff,</HI> that falling in a moderate Breadth from the Crown of their Head spreads gradually wider to the midle of their Backs.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="62"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ancient Care to sup∣ply the Em∣pire with <HI>Ja∣nizaries.</HI></NOTE>THE Institution of this famous and formidable Militia, was Founded Originally on the surest Pillars of a deep but barbarous Policy, for Officers were continually dispatch'd to make triennial Seisures of the <HI>Christian</HI> Children, Inhabiting the Countries unhappily fallen under the galling Yoke of <HI>Turkish</HI> Slavery: These miserable Wretches thus violently ra∣vish'd from their sorrowful Parents, were distributed in Parties over all the Empire, till they reach'd the Age of Sixteen Years, at which time, com∣pleatly versed in the Knowledge of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language and Religion, they were severally disposed of, in the many <HI>Seraglio's</HI> belonging to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> where for the space of Five or Seven Years, they were in∣ur'd to Hardships by the laborious Practice of continual Drudgeries, such as cleaving Wood, bearing Burthens, working in Gardens, and every o∣ther toilsome Exercise; till having learn'd the Art of Patience, and sub∣missive Resignation to the Will of their Superiors, they were instructed diligently in the Art of War; and as the Death of other <HI>Janizaries</HI> afforded Vacancy, succeeded gradually to their Posts and Privileges, where Pra∣ctising with an emulative Courage, the Dictates of their Education, they give a fatal Proof how much the present Ties of Life exceed the Bands of weaker Nature; for not retaining the minutest Notion of their Parents or their Country, they bend entirely the Endeavours of their Arms for the wish'd Promotion of their <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Interest; and have in former Ages, by the Excellence of their Discipline and Greatness of their Courage, been Chief Supporters of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Glory; and by the Just Rewards their Va∣lour won, distinguish'd <HI>Honourably</HI> as the Flower of that Empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The present neglect of that Order occasi∣on'd by their former Inso∣lence.</NOTE>BUT far below the ancient Spirit of this Martial Order is the grovel∣ling Genius of the Modern <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who tasting largely of the Sweets of Power in the black Successes of their bold Resentments, grew madly Inso∣lent, and so familiar with Rebellion, that having dy'd their Weapons in the guiltless Blood of many <HI>Sultans,</HI> they became so terrible to succeeding Emperors, that they have long endeavour'd by the subtle Force of undis∣cover'd Policies, to Raise some Milder Order on the Ruin of the Former; least like unhappy <HI>Rome</HI>'s <HI>Pretorian Cohorts,</HI> the rough Effects of their au∣dacious Violence should one Day Ruin that declining Empire, whose Defence alone was the true Design of their Original Institution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Num∣ber and Pri∣vileges.</NOTE>THEIR Number was at first confin'd to Seven Thousand, but is now improv'd to more than Forty Thousand <HI>lawfully</HI> Enroll'd; besides vast Numbers who, by the winning Virtue of an annual Present, to the Officers of this Order, become Possessors of those innumerable Privileges, which exempt the <HI>Janizaries</HI> from Taxes, Prosecutions, or any other Ties of Ju∣stice, so that being own'd on all Occasions by the Muster Masters of that Militia, they stand secure above the Law, and practice Villanies by the favourable Connivance of an uncontroul'd Authority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Way of Living.</NOTE>THERE are now One Hundred Sixty Two Chambers or large Buil∣dings call'd <HI>Odaes</HI> at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> for the Lodging of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> but none in any other Part of the Empire, because the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s having ever look'd upon this Order, as the Safety and Support of their Authority, took care to have them always near their Persons, a Design well laid, but fatal in its Consequences. Over every Chamber is an Officer appointed, under the Title of <HI>Oda Basham,</HI> or <HI>Inspecter</HI> of the Chamber. The Creation of a <HI>Janizary</HI> is a peculiar Prerogative of this advantageous Office, and the man∣ner wherein it is perform'd deserves Remark.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of their Cre∣ation.</NOTE>WHEN the Persons to be Chosen have gradually proceeded thro' the tedious Counse of their probationary Labours, they are Summon'd <HI>in their Places,</HI> to a Personal Appearance before the Muster Master of that Order,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pay.</NOTE>THEY receive their Pay proportionable to their Merit, beginning with little more than a Penny a Day, and encreasing their Allowances upon e∣very worthy Action, till they reach the Salary of Seven Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week, which is the utmost Pay a <HI>Janizary</HI> can pretend to, till the <HI>Seniority</HI> of their Years, or <HI>peculiarity</HI> of their Actions, advances them to the Offices peculiar to their Order, and makes their Riches equal to their Authority: But by the way, the Reader must observe this Pay is only an <HI>additional</HI> Encou∣ragement to excite their <HI>Valour,</HI> for they have not only <HI>daily</HI> Meals provi∣ded in their Chambers, with all the other Necessaries of Life, but receive an annual Present of a Suit of Cloaths from the Bounty of their Emperour, which is generally made of very good and serviceable <HI>Green</HI> or <HI>Violet</HI> colour'd Cloth, the Form whereof may fully be perceived, by turning to the Cut relating to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Wedding, described at large in the One and Twen∣tieth Chapter of this Book.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Power and Interest of their Ge∣neral.</NOTE>THERE is an Officer appointed over this Militia, distinguish'd by the Title of <HI>Yani-Cherr Aga,</HI> or General of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> whose suspected Power alarms the Court with such preventive Jealousies, that the <HI>Sultan</HI> takes a constant Care to give that Charge to one intirely in his Interest: A Policy whose Effects have often sav'd the Modern Emperours from the threatned Violences of their fierce Rebellions: The boundless Power of this Arbitrary Officer extends it self to the decision of every intervening Ac∣cident, in favour <HI>of,</HI> or judgment <HI>against</HI> them: The common Punish∣ments of their less hainous Crimes are generally ordered by their Inferiour Officers, and executed by the <HI>Cooks</HI> of their respective Chambers; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of Executing a <HI>Janizary.</HI></NOTE>but if any of that Order is detected in a Guilt deserving Death, he is condemned immediately by the Sentence of his General, and thrown at Midnight with the greatest Secrecy imaginable with Weights about his Neck into the middle of the Sea.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Arms abroad and at home.</NOTE>THEIR Arms in War are Scymetars and Musquets wherewith they Fight on Foot, surrounding always the Person of their Emperour, or in his Absence the <HI>Vizier</HI> or <HI>General,</HI> they seldom Fight in other Order, than the Figure which of old compos'd the <HI>Macedonian Phalanx.</HI> When at Home they are appointed a the Guards of Honour to the <HI>Christiam</HI> Embassadors, to keep perpetual Watch in all the Gates and Avenues of their Imperial <HI>City</HI>; to Accompany and Protect, such Strangers as are Curious to behold the Rarities of the Country, from the barbarous Insolencies of the rude In∣habitants; which they will do with all imaginable Courtesy and Fidelity, for the small Reward of half a Crown a Day, and sometimes les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. They bear no other Arms at Home than a small Dagger call'd <HI>Hanjarr,</HI> which with a large smooth Cane, not much unlike the largest Staffs belonging to our Constables, are known so commonly, and so extreamly fear'd by all who meet them, that no Man dares presume to offer the least Affront to any <HI>Christian</HI> guarded by a <HI>Janizary,</HI> least his Blood should pay the Forfeit of his Insolence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Story of a <HI>Janizary</HI> at <HI>Constantinople.</HI></NOTE>I remember with concern that at my first Arrival in that Country, while I was a perfect Stranger to their Nature and their Language, I was promp∣ted by the Curiosity of my Temper, to walk about the Streets of <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="64"/>
and make my Observations on the Place and its Inhabitants, under the undoubted Convoy of a faithful <HI>Janizary</HI>; we were passing on a Caus∣way in a Publick Street, when the Misfortune of a Rude and Ignorant Pot∣ter, led him on to stop our Way, by the means of an Ass that he had loaden with brittle Ware to Sell his Customers about the City: The <HI>Janizary</HI> had already passed the Door of a large Shop, from whence the poor Fellow drove his Ass upon the Causway, and prevented me from following my Convoy; there was a fair Descent not much beyond him, whereby he might have gone down to the middle of the Street, had he turn'd his Asses Head the other way, but whether mov'd by a Religious Zeal which na∣turally teaches them to hate a <HI>Christian,</HI> or by the Native Haughtiness of his unpollish'd Temper, he press'd his Ass with fury forward, and the Pas∣sage wanting breadth to give him room, oblig'd me roughly to the incon∣venient trouble of an unwilling Squeeze to give him all the way I could, but finding the unwelcome pressure of the Asses Panniers a little incomo∣dious, I was forc'd to lay my Hands upon the Creature's Side, and pushing forward somewhat violently and unexpectedly together, both the Potter and his Panniers fell headlong from the Causway, which was al∣most Five Foot high, into the middle of the Street, almost half a Foot deep in Mud and Water: The Fellow somewhat hurt by the roughness of his Fall, and very much enraged at the Destruction of his Glasses, drew out a long Knife, which he wore within his Girdle, and running to the Causway endeavour'd furiously to reach my Legs with a revengeful Wound: The <HI>Janizary,</HI> who had heard the Fall, and was come back to my Assistance, leap'd swiftly down, and drawing his <HI>Hanjarr</HI> in hasty Passion, struck it to the Hilt in the poor Fellows Shoulder, who falling on his Knees amidst the Dirt, cry'd out with lifted Arms, <HI>O</HI> God, <HI>and</HI> Maho∣met <HI>his only Prophet, in what have I Offended to be made the Ʋictim of a Cur∣sed Infidel.</HI> Nay to so unreasonable a Degree was he transported by his Passion, that finding no Redress, he threw the Mud upon his Face, and rowled himself about in Blood and Water, while the <HI>Janizary</HI> march'd for∣ward unconcern'd and stately, leading me untouch'd, thro' Crowds of People, who tho' their Eyes declar'd their Anger, were oblig'd to hide their Thoughts in the deceitful Postures of a mild Neutrality.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A dangerous Privilege of the Militia.</NOTE>AMONG the numerous Privileges peculiar to the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> there is one a little inconsistent with the cautious Policy of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Government, that is a Permission of increasing their Common Treasury, by the successive Additions of what Sums of Money their <HI>Aga</HI>'s or Generals die possessed of, and the Grant of very considerable Profits, arising from the Tenure of se∣veral large Tracts of Land in <HI>Anatolia.</HI> How dangerous it is to Assign such Power and Riches, to a Standing Army ever Quarter'd in the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of their Empire, the <HI>Turkish Sultans</HI> have experienc'd dearly, by the frequent Effects of that audacious Insolence, which having long been nourished by the dictates of their Plenty, has often Flesh'd the Lawless <HI>Janzaries</HI> in the Murder of their Sovereigns: Nor do they only study their <HI>Revenge</HI> in the Success of their Rebellion, since 'tis the never failing Interest of this Order, to out-live the Reigns of many <HI>Sultans</HI>; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Abuses of an Inter∣regnum.</NOTE>for besides the sure Addition of a daily Penny to their former Pay, they gain an uncontroul'd Authority, to Rob and Plunder during the space of a small Interregnum, violently Pos∣sessing as a lawful Prize whatever Goods they lay their Hands on; and committing boldly black Outrages with the plausible Pretence of Griev∣ing out of measure for the mournful Death of their Indulgent Ma∣ster.</P>
<P>THE melancholy Consequences of this Abuse of Power, have as is be∣fore declar'd, induc'd the Government to study Means of ruining this Order, which not being able to accomplish by the dint of Force, they have inven∣ted
<PB N="23" REF="65"/>
many subtil Wiles to Weaken Gradually the Foundations of their Power; for whereas the Matchless Discipline of Ancient <HI>Janizaries</HI> gave bright Examples to Inferiour Orders, they are now admitted frequently without the Gradual Labours of Probationary Servitude. Marriage once de∣ny'd 'em with the Strictest Prohibition, is not only Suffer'd but En∣courag'd by their Officers; Trades are follow'd, and the Weekly Musters Slighted by Permission, insomuch that their Unfurnish'd Chambers, once the Nurseries of Successful Valour, can furnish few at Wars great Summons, who do not Artfully decline the Service, by the prevailing Pleas of Wife and Family, or some mean Shift, whose common Practice has al∣ready Weaken'd and will in time Entirely Ruin the declining Columns of that Dwindling Order.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turkish Spahee</HI>'s.</NOTE>NEXT to the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> I proceed to speak of that Order of the <HI>Turkish Horse,</HI> commonly distinguish'd by the Name of <HI>Spahee's</HI> and di∣vided into two Bodys, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Europaean,</HI> and the <HI>Asiatick.</HI> These <HI>Light-Horse Men,</HI> were in Ancient times the <HI>Noblest</HI> Cavalry the World could boast of, <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Formidable</HI> by the Plenty they were Masters of, never coming into the Field without the Stately Splendour of a Numerous and Magnificent Attendance, and Shining Brightly over all the rest of their <HI>Militia</HI> by the vast advantages they made of their Acquaintance <HI>with,</HI> or Interest <HI>in,</HI> the Greatest Officers of the Empire, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reasons of their late Decay.</NOTE>but Poisoning their Loy∣alty with the encrease of their Authority, they Sacrifis'd their Honour to the Dictates of Ambition, and Insolently Practic'd a continued Lesson of Mutiny and Rebellion, 'till the common Fate of Falling Treachery Involv'd their Order in a general Ruin, and from the Towring <HI>Pyramids</HI> of their Unrival'd Grandeur, reduc'd them Gradually to a common Le∣vel with the Inferior Orders of the <HI>Turks Militia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pay and Opportunities of Encreasing it.</NOTE>AT present the Number of Spahees exceeds not Five and Thirty Thousand, who Receive a Quarterly Payment in the Presence of the <HI>Vizier Azem,</HI> a Custom Introduc'd by the Famous <HI>Kupriuli,</HI> to prevent the Black effects of those Intestine Discords, <HI>common</HI> Formerly, from their Pay Day Quarrels; The lowest Salary of a <HI>Turkish Spahee</HI> is at the Rate of one Shilling a Day, to which they become Intituled to upon their first Pro∣motion to that Office, and encrease their Pay by Gradual Steps, such as the Favour of their Officers, the Addition of 2 Pence or 3 Pence a Day for the Head of every Enemy they bring their General, as much for the Infor∣mation of a <HI>Spahee's</HI> Death out of the Pay of the Deceas'd, a Custom Poli∣tickly Instituted to prevent the Fashionable Cheats Impos'd on Christian Princes by their Military Officers. Besides which casual Opportunities of Encreasing their Allowances, they Receive the Additional Reward of 4 Pence a Day upon the Accession of every New <HI>Sultan</HI> to the Throne of his Predecessors, so that by the Favourable turns of Merit or good Fortune they go on Encreasing by Successive Additions, till they attain at last their <HI>Ne plus Ʋltra,</HI> and sit down contentedly in the full Possession of Eight Shil∣lings and Four-Pence <HI>per</HI> Day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Arms in War.</NOTE>THE Common Arms in use amongst these Horse-Men are numerous and convenient, and so strangely differing from one another, that 'tis a Sight Compleatly curious to observe a Disciplin'd <HI>Spahee,</HI> as fully Arm'd as War requires him. For first a Glittering Helmet rather Graces than Defends their Heads, a Back and Breast Piece Guard their Bodies, and on their Shoulders Hangs a Bow with a Capacious Quiver of their Eastern Arrows, their Girdles often hold 4 Horse-Mens Pistols, a long Light Mus∣ket Slung like ours, hangs Neatly at their Sides, and on their proper Thigh, is Fast'ned a Large Weighty Scymetar, werewith when Broken in upon Disorder'd Enemies they do Prodigious Execution, and Riding

short in strong and spacious Stirrops, lift themselves with ease beyond their Saddle, and extend a Blow with double Fury: Besides these Arms, they bear upon the left side of their Horses beneath the Girt, ano∣ther strong and broader Back-Sword; which with an Iron headed Mace, for that purpose fasten'd on the contrary side, they use promiscu∣ously as they see Occasion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Disci∣pline rather desperate than regular.</NOTE>THEIR Discipline is mean and insignificant, for they never Form their Bodies according to the politer Practice of the <HI>Christian</HI> Nations, in∣to Regiments or Companies, Rank, File, or any other Order, but uniting strongly into one gross Multitude, observe attentively the Nod of their Commanders, and repeating loudly Exclamations upon God, under the Expressions <HI>Allah, Allah,</HI> fall rashly on with speed and vigour; and if re∣puls'd in their two first Endeavours, to break the Order of their Enemies, repeat with desperate Rashness their dangerous Attempt, and if repell'd that fatal time, forget their Courage, and disperse confusedly in all the hurry of a shameful Flight.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Punish∣ments.</NOTE>IN War, the Charge of those Rich Waggons, which contain the Mo∣ney for the Payment of the Troops, is constantly committed to the Custo∣dy of the <HI>Spahees</HI>; whose place it is to stand on Horseback as Centinels of Honour with a <HI>Janizary</HI> on Foot, at the end of every Rope which supports the stately Pavilion of their <HI>Sultan,</HI> or in his Absence the <HI>Vizier</HI> his Gene∣ral. When their Crimes deserve the Punishment of Death, they suffer pri∣vately like the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> but when Demerits of a lower Nature, call for Punishments of smaller Rigour, they are bastinadoed on their Feet as is be∣fore describ'd, while offending <HI>Janizaries</HI> feel the Cudgel on their fleshy But∣tocks, that the one may Ride and t'other Walk without uneasiness; by which means neither is prevented from the Service of his <HI>Sultan.</HI></P>
<P>SO much shall serve to have spoken of the two extraordinary Orders of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Militia, who receive immediate Salaries from the Treasures of the <HI>Sultan.</HI> I shall now proceed to Calculate as nearly as is possible the prodigious Numbers of their Cavalry, whose formidable Bodies have so often struck a panick Fear thro' the despairing Armies of con∣tending Governments.</P>

NOR is this large Account of their Prodigious Numbers Swoln be∣yond the fix'd Reality of their Existence, I might rather have ad∣vanc'd my Calculation in a High Degree, from the Natural Dictates of Conspicuous Probability, but shall Content my self with having given my Reader an Account, Sincerely void of all Extravagancies, and those Fashionable Practices (whether <HI>Justly</HI> or <HI>Ʋnjustly,</HI> I shall not here dispute) so Unfortunately Imputed to the too Prolifick Fancy's of our Modern Travellers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Order of the <HI>Tukish</HI> In∣fantry call'd <HI>Azapi.</HI></NOTE>PROPORTIONABLE to the Cavalry is the Unnumbred In∣fantry of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Nation, which consists of several Degrees in Honour or advantage, and all Maintain'd in War and Peace without the smallest Burthen on the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Treasury, the most Unvalued, Numerous, and Unpolish'd Souldiers of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army, are the <HI>Azapi,</HI> an Order void of Form or Discipline, who in the Storming Towns, defending Trenches, or Attacking Armies are like useless Blocks of Timber Push'd upon their Ruin, that falling Dead by Thousands they may as it were make Blunt the Weapons of the Enemy, and with their Bodys fill a Ditch or form a Bul∣wark for the Passage or Defence of their more Valued Followers.</P>
<P>BESIDES these General Bodies of the <HI>Turks</HI> Militia, every Province has some Peculiar Order for its own Defence, nor do the Guards of <HI>Viceroys</HI> and <HI>Provincials</HI> form an Inconsiderable Part of their Unshaken Strength and Power; no <HI>Bey, Bashaw,</HI> or any distant Governour, be∣lieving himself secure without the Guard of certain Thousands of Souldiers Appropriated to his Service, who when the Common Danger, or their Masters Loyalty speaks 'em necessary, are sent to serve their Country, where any Seat of War requires their Presence.</P>
<P>THERE are, besides these mention'd Orders several other sorts of Souldiery, such as Gunners, Armourers, Baggage-Guarders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which in <HI>Constantinople</HI> only, may be Reckon'd constantly the Number of 12 or 14 Thousand, whereby the Reader may be able to guess, what Propor∣tionable Swarms must be Distributed in all the Spreading Corners of that Spacious Empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> Auxiliary Forces from <HI>Valachia</HI> and <HI>Moldavia.</HI></NOTE>THE Subjects of <HI>Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Valachia</HI> are Oblig'd to send Auxiliary Forces to the Assistance of the <HI>Turks,</HI> whensoever their occasions Press 'em to Require it, the Settled <HI>Quota</HI> of each Country is about Eight Thousand Men, Commanded always by their Respective Princes, nor can the Weightiest Plea of Incapacited Poverty, Exempt 'em from that Duty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duty of the <HI>Tartar Han,</HI> in respect to the <HI>Grand-Sig∣nior</HI>'s Service.</NOTE>BUT the Greatest aid, the <HI>Turks</HI> Receive from their depending Allies, is the fix'd Supply of Fifty Thousand Horse, a Tribute due to the Occasions of the <HI>Sultan,</HI> from the Petty <HI>Tartar,</HI> to be led by the Young <HI>Han</HI> his Son, or the Chief Minister of the Country, when the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army is Commanded by the Grand <HI>Vizier,</HI> or any other Ge∣neral, but when the <HI>Emperour</HI> Commands in Person, the <HI>Tartar Han</HI> or Prince himself must come and joyn him with a Furnish'd Army of an Hundred Thousand Men.</P>
<P>HAVING Dwelt so long upon those Numerous Orders whose Unnum∣ber'd Multitudes Compose that Formidable Power whereunto in for∣mer Ages the Successfull <HI>Turks</HI> have ow'd their Fortune, it may not be Esteem'd Unnecessary to describe particularly that Accomplish'd Discipline so strictly Practis'd in the Longest Marches of their Nu∣merous Army.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="69"/>
THO' the <HI>Turkish</HI> Management of their Body Military has been Rendred void of Form and Discipline by the Mistaken Representations of some too Hasty Travellers, yet a Person who observes with a Cu∣rious Impartiality, the Artfull methods of their Warlike Government, will soon percieve a Matchless Order Shine Conspicuously throughout their Camp, whose Good effects Produce continually such Happy Con∣sequences, as will more than make a full Atonment for their known Deficiency in the Art of War,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The use of Wine denied Souldiers of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army upon pain of Death.</NOTE>FOR First, the use of Wine is there Deny'd 'em by so Strict a Prohibi∣tion, that the Smallest Quantity, when Discover'd, is a certain Sacri∣fice of that Mans Life who has it in Possession. Hereby those frequent Quarrels and Audacious Villanies so Fatal and Pernicious to the Chri∣stian Armies are Perpetually avoided, and the Noisy Clamours of Tu∣multuous War, Subservient Calmly to the Milder Influence of a Peace∣full Quietude, no Rapes or Murders Plead for Justice to the Base Abettors of a Countenanc'd Disorder, no Hopes or Prospect of Unlaw∣full gain can Tempt the Officers of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Army, to the Loose Permission of Licentious Insolencies; all is Mild and Serene and Silent, and the Horrid Face of Gloomy War Disguis'd or Painted by the Brighter Marks of Form and Discipline.</P>
<P>TIS for this the Officers of any Marching Troops throughout the <HI>Turks</HI> Dominions, Dispatch continually from Place to Place, a certain Number of the Trustiest <HI>Janizaries,</HI> to Search the Towns through the which their Men must Pass, and Seal or Stave what <HI>Buts</HI> of Wine or other Spirituous Liquor they find therein, at Least 4 Days before their Camp Arrives.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Curious sort of Torch∣es us'd in <HI>Turk∣ey.</HI></NOTE>ANOTHER Custom Prevalent amongst the <HI>Turkish</HI> Armies is to March 'em constantly from Town to Town, and never suffer them in Peace or War to Lie so long in any Place, as to Contrive such Mischiefs as our Christian Souldiers by their Tempting Opportunities do too often Study, and find means to Execute; nay so Carefull are their Chiefs to prevent Disturbances, that they will rather Travel all Night long than give their Men the means of Plundering those Miserable Wretches on whom they Quarter; and indeed it is a Sight Extreamly Pleasant to behold 'em Marching thro' the Thickest Gloom of Win∣ter Nights, with so Innumerable a Quantity of Bright Illuminations as almost Rival Day it self with their Extended Lustre; nor are these Lights like our small Torches, but Compos'd of Large and Massy Balls of Flax and Cotton, dip'd in Tarr or Turpentine, or oftner a sort of Oily, and Bituminous Wood, which certain <HI>Arabs,</HI> Purposely At∣tending on the <HI>Turkish</HI> Camp, and there Distinguish'd by the Name of <HI>Massalageelar,</HI> bear aloft in Iron Cages, carried on a Tall and Eleva∣ted Staff not much unlike those Ancient Lights Describ'd in Old and Valuable Tapesttry.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The form wherein the <HI>Turkish</HI> Gene∣rals Pitch their Camps.</NOTE>AND now, since I have so often mentioned the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army, 'twill no ways favour of a Disgressive Prolixity, if I Describe at Large that Gracefull Order and <HI>unthought</HI> Magnificence wherewith they Pitch their Camps in every Place they come to. First then, the Large Pavilions of the <HI>Sultan, Grand Vizier,</HI> or any other General then Marching at their Head, are Pitch'd directly in the midst of some Extensive Plain, Surrounded at Submissive Distance by the Tents of his Lord Treasurer, Chief Steward, Secretary and the Master of the Ceremonies; these Five Pavilions Plac'd as I have said before, at a Respectfull Distance, Extend themselves upon a vast Spot of Ground, leaving in the Mid∣dle
<PB N="28" REF="70"/>
one fine open <HI>Square,</HI> in whose delineated Center stand a double Row of stately Pillars, which support a lofty Canopy, under which all Punish∣ments when order'd by the General, are put in Execution: Here come the Officers of the Army, either led by Business or desire of Conversation, and walking up and down in several Companies, form agreeably a sort of <HI>Pro∣menade,</HI> diverting, tho' irregular.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turkish</HI> Treasury, how Guarded in the Camp.</NOTE>NOT far from hence are plac'd those valuable Chests which bear the Treasure for the Soldiers Payment, pil'd in gradual Order one upon the other, and rising in a Form directly circular: These Chests are guarded both within and without, by certain Chosen Horse-Men, who all Night long, keep strict and formidable Watch, with Spears and Fire-Arms.</P>
<P>THE Two abovemention'd Quarters are surrounded by the graceful Tents of the <HI>Bashaws, Beys, Beylerbeys, Sangiacks,</HI> and <HI>Aga</HI>'s, whose stately Form and vast Magnificence can never be imagin'd, but by such whose ocular Demonstration have convinc'd 'em of their Grandeur; for tho' the <HI>Turks</HI> delight but little in the outward Ornament of Houses, nor aspire in the least to overdo each other in the <HI>Europaean</HI> Custom of Polite and Solid Architecture, yet do they far more exceed us in the rich Ornaments and Contrivances of their Pavilions, than we outshine their homely Hutts, and miserable Cottages, by the stupendious Fabricks of our finest Mar∣ble, and the most lasting Statelyness of our most celebrated Edi∣fices.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The wonder∣ful Conveni∣ences of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Pavili∣ons.</NOTE>'TIS every way impossible to describe at large those tripple Walls, vast Rooms of State, innumerable Apartments, Kitchens, Butteries, Cel∣lars, and convenient Offices, wherein those Tents abound which form the Courts of some considerable Officers in their Army; their Rooms are square, and full of Windows, neatly form'd to open always from the Windy Quarter; and in short, nothing either Useful or Ornamental is omit∣ted to compleat them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Quarters of the <HI>Zaims, Timariots,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>BEHIND their Masters lie, in measur'd Order, a prodigious Number of the <HI>Zaims, Timariots</HI> and <HI>Beylerbeys,</HI> in Proportion to the <HI>Sul∣tan</HI>'s Army, who with their Horses, Camels, Mules and Carriages, ap∣pear a huge and formidable Body, of well-skill'd and disciplin'd Sol∣diers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarters of the <HI>Janizaries.</HI></NOTE>THe Chosen Glories of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Camp compose its Front, consisting chiefly of the bravest <HI>Janizaries,</HI> and such accomplish'd Voluntiers, as ha∣ving fully qualified themselves by a long Experience for the Duty of an Office, expect impatiently some profitable Employment, by gradual Suc∣cession to the vacant Posts of such as fall, or by the long-wish'd Favour of some Great Commander. These encompass at an aweful Distance, the <HI>Yani-Cherr-Aga,</HI> or General of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> whose Place and Power I have lately spoken of, in the foregoing Part of this Chapter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spahees</HI> Quarter'd in the Rear.</NOTE>THE Rear of their Army is generally compos'd of the Politest <HI>Spahees,</HI> who with many other Regular and Well-appointed Horsemen, of the most Esteem'd and Honourable Orders, maintain their Posts in case of need with wonderful Alacrity and Resolution, making Good the Retreat of their dis∣order'd Fellows, by bravely Sacrfising their Lives and Liberty, for the preferable Interest of their <HI>Sultan</HI> and his Country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Station of the Baggage and heavy Artil∣lery.</NOTE>'TIS generally under the Guard of these above-nam'd Horsemen, that the Baggage, Camels, and heavy Artillery belonging to the Army are safely Convoy'd; and really when a Man who seriously reflects on

what he sees, becomes a Witness of the numberless Attendants, Trains, and Carriages of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Armies, he cannot but with Wonder bless that God, who curbs in Mercy the Ambitious Arms of this prodigious Govern∣ment, and has kindly plac'd a powerful Hook in the presumptuous Nostrils of their Great <HI>Leviathan.</HI></P>
<P>THUS have I at large describ'd the fatal Instruments of those depo∣pulating Slaughters, whose raging Violence in former Ages, rais'd the Mo∣narchs of a ravish'd Empire, to the loftiest Throne of undivided Power and arbitrary Tyranny, which the World supports; and still continue to main∣tain the Swords Prerogative, whereby without respect to Justice or Religion, the <HI>Turkish Sultans</HI> trample proudly on the softer Dictates of Nature and Morality; removing violently whatever Rubs obstruct their Will; and to whose Inhumane Practices nothing can be more applicable, than the Precepts of <HI>Photinus,</HI> express'd as follows in the Eighth Book of <HI>Lu∣can.</HI>
<Q><L>Sceptrorum vis tota perit, si pendere justa</L>
<L>Incipit; evertitque arces respectus honesti.</L>
<L>Libertas Scelerum est, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of their Naval Force.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The conveni∣ent Situation of <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> in re∣spect to Na∣vigation.</NOTE>LET us now proceed to search a little into those extraordinary Conveniencies for attaining the highest Perfection in the Art of Navigation, so peculiar to the Capital of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire, that it seems as if the Hand of Providence had fix'd at <HI>Constanti∣nople</HI> the happy Seat of Universal Monarchy, and blest its Neighbourhood with all the mighty Helps that bounteous <HI>Nature</HI> can afford a Country, or the Hand of <HI>Art</HI> can possibly require, to extend Dominion over all the World, and spread Authority thro' distant Climates, vainly separated by the Watry Desarts of a Stormy Ocean.</P>
<P>NOT all the Kingdoms of the <HI>Christian</HI> World, shou'd they resolve to join their Forces, and partake promiscuously of one anothers Blessings, cou'd afford conjointly more Materials for Maritime Improvements, than
<PB N="30" REF="72"/>
grow commodiously within the beckon of the <HI>Turks</HI> Metropolis; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Timber whence brought them.</NOTE>for round the Shores whose ragged Cliffs encompass the <HI>Euxine</HI> or <HI>Black Sea,</HI> stand endless Numbers of Tall Woods, whose stately Timber fell'd for Use, sup∣ply the City thro' the <HI>Thracian Bosphorus,</HI> with the finest Wood requir'd for Building.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Canvas, Hemp Tar, Pitch, Tallow and Bisket.</NOTE>CANVAS for Sails, and Hemp for Rigging well what Ships they build, they have beyond all possible Necessity, from those Parts of <HI>Egypt</HI> which surround <HI>Grand-Cairo. Valachia, Moldavia, Epirus</HI> and <HI>Albania,</HI> supply them plentifully with Tallow, Pitch, and Tarr, the best in <HI>Europe</HI>; as for Bisket it abounds incredibly thro' every Corner of their vast Dominions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The prodigi∣ous Magni∣tude of the Arsenal at <HI>Constantinople.</HI></NOTE>THEIR Ports and Arsenals for building Ships are Numerous, and Convenient beyond Imagination; that at <HI>Constantinople</HI> is so vastly Large and full of Volta's or Docks for Building, as to be capable of Fitting out a∣bove One Hundred and Thirty Five Vessels at one and the same time; nor are the other Arsenals and Harbours of his Empire, less Convenient or Magnificently Splendid, in proportion to the several Magnitudes of the respective Towns or Places where they are; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence sup∣plied with Gally Slaves.</NOTE>and as for Gally-Slaves to tugg laboriously at the toilsom Oar, they neither <HI>do</HI> nor <HI>can</HI> want fresh Supplies, while the <HI>Barbarian</HI> Pirates or dreadful Ravages of the Inhumane <HI>Tartars,</HI> present or sell them yearly Thousands of such un∣happy Wretches, as have fallen unwarily into their Hands, and so be∣come the wretched Victims of their insatiate Avarice.</P>
<P>NOW may my Reader be induc'd to fansie from the Accounts above∣mention'd, that the Relation I shall give him of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleets will be proportionable to their Conveniencies for encouraging above the <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> World, the useful Art of Navigation; but he will find his Error with a deep Surprize, when he perceives their Naval Force, not only un∣improv'd by an industrious Application, to an equal Balance with the <HI>Christian</HI> Navies, but on the contrary, every way Inferior to the Maritime Improvements of those Poor Republicks, whose small Extent and insigni∣ficant Possessions, do scarce intitle them to the Name of Governments, when look'd upon in Competition with the far superior Power of <HI>Confe∣derated Christendom.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Turks</HI> grew weak in Navigation.</NOTE>YET is this great Misfortune rather owing to their <HI>Ignorance</HI> than <HI>Idle∣ness,</HI> having frequently Attempted to Equip vast Navies, and with some Success Invaded Hostile Nations with their sometime Formidable Squa∣drons, but their want of Knowledge in the Arts of Building, Rigging, or the Management of Vessels, still occasion'd Yearly Losses to the <HI>Sultan,</HI> by their dreadful <HI>Shipwracks</HI> when they met with Tempests, or more dreadful <HI>Overthrows</HI> when driven by the Turns of Chance to stand the Shock of a more Skillful Enemy, in the destructive Trial of some decisive Battle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gallies now chiefly us'd.</NOTE>'TIS for this alone they have of late dis-us'd their Large <HI>Maa-humes</HI> or Ships of War, and fallen wholly into building Gallies and Galleasses, so that trusting rather to the Oar, than their Strength or Courage, they preserve their Navies from those shocking Dangers which so often broke 'em, when they vainly thought themselves a Match by Sea as well as Land for <HI>Christian</HI> Enemies.</P>
<P>THERE are notwithstanding now at <HI>Constantinople</HI> so many Tall and Stately Ships of War, as might compose a Navy of Five or Six and Thirty Sail, from Twenty Four to One Hundred and Sixteen Guns;
<PB N="31" REF="73"/>
but these are never sent Abroad for Use but Oftentation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Form of <HI>Turkish</HI> Ships of War.</NOTE>They are beyond imagination high and broad, their Sterns and Heads built high, one Deck above another, for Conveniency of Lodging Officers, but so unweildy by their Form, and so unfit for Stormy Weather by the Green unseason'd Tim∣ber which is us'd about 'em, that tho' they put to Sea, with Drums and Trumpets Sounding, endless Crowds of Sailors Shouting, and their Strea∣mers Flying with a rich Magnificence, they soon return Unrigg'd and Shattered, less in <HI>Number</HI> as in <HI>Splendour,</HI> bearing shamefully the ragged Marks of Weakness and Disorder in their tatter'd Sails, and Planks just ga∣ping to admit the Ocean.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Turkish</HI> Gallies, which as I said before, are what they most de∣pend on, are jointly subject to the same Misfortunes with their Larger Vessels, and utterly unable to resist the Fury of a Winter Sea, wherefore being-fix'd in dry Docks belonging to the Arsenal, till the sharp extremity of that unfavour'd Season is a little over, there are Orders given to the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s <HI>Admiral,</HI> distinguish'd by the Name of <HI>Capitain-Bashaw,</HI> to call 'em from their Stations, and with all imaginable Expedition put to Sea, and Cruise all Summer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of their rai∣sing Seamen.</NOTE>PROCLAMATION is immediately hereupon, Issued carefully over all the <HI>Turks</HI> Dominions bordering on the Black and Midland Seas, that such as hold their Lands in Tenour of Sea Service, shall suddenly Re∣pair with their respective Quotas to their several Posts on Board their Gal∣lies, this is done with utmost speed, and generally brings together about Two Thirds of that great Number which their Fleet requires upon all Occasions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pay of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Sailor.</NOTE>TO fill the Vacancies which still require supply, they List immediately prodigious Numbers of a sort of Mariners, <HI>there</HI> distinguish'd by the Name of <HI>Tchurmah,</HI> who are kept as Slaves by People in the Towns which border on the Sea, and hir'd to serve the Summer out on board the Gallies, where for Six Months Drudgery at the laborious Oar, they receive a good Allow∣ance of Provision for the Voyage, and about the Sum of Five and Twenty Pounds at their Return, which is the sole Right and Property of their respective Masters, who live an Idle and Inglorious Life, upon the toilsom Labours and unpitied Miseries of their Fellow Creatures.</P>
<P>IN case there still requires a fresh Recruit, they send a certain Number of their sturdiest Seamen, to rove from Place to Place, about the Provin∣ces which border on their Capital, and there Impress the lustiest Clowns they find amongst them, till by this Addition they compleat the Number which the Service of the <HI>Sultan</HI> then demands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An admirable Policy.</NOTE>THESE last are call'd <HI>Azaps</HI> or Clowns, and as least Useful to the Necessities of their Emperour, are still least Burthensome to his Treasury, for tho' their Pay is equal to the rest, it Costs the Government not one sole Farthing, for out of every Five and Twenty Families they claim a Right to one <HI>Azap,</HI> and for his Maintenance that Summer, the other Four, and Twenty Houses are oblig'd to raise an equal Sum of Money to reward his Service.</P>
<P>BESIDES these several Orders of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Seamen, there remains another to be spoken of, which consists of those condemn'd Delinquents of the <HI>Christian</HI> Churches subject to their Tyranny, whose Crimes or evil Fate have chain'd their Bodies to the Oar of Slavery, whence Death alone has Power to free them; these, with such of the <HI>Maltese, Venetian, Spanish,</HI> or <HI>Italian</HI> Mariners, as have unfortunately been the Prize of War, are kept
<PB N="32" REF="74"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Misery of <HI>Gal∣ley-Slaves.</HI></NOTE>together void of Hope in endless Misery, never to enjoy their Ravish'd Li∣berty till the Pitying Sea demands their Bodies, Worn and Meagre by continual Labours, or the Happy turn of a Successfull Battle, shall with Joy give back again that Darling Blessing which it once took from 'em.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Yearly Voyage of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleet of <HI>Galleys.</HI></NOTE>THE <HI>Turkish</HI> Galleys thus Equip'd, set Sail for a large Port upon the <HI>Hellespont</HI> now call'd <HI>Gallipolis.</HI> Their Number ne'er exceeds one Hundred nor can the Mighty Power of the <HI>Turkish Sultan</HI> maintain a greater Fleet, tho' oft Attempted. Hence they Sail as <HI>War</HI> or <HI>Business</HI> leads their Admi∣ral, from Isle to Isle round all the Tributary Islands of the <HI>Archepilago,</HI> to awe the Natives from Rebellion or Disorder; or Preserve their Shoars from the Repeated Insults of their <HI>Christian</HI> Enemies, till having spent the time Allotted for their Absence, they return again to the Port of <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI> and Discharging all their Hired Seamen, Place the Galleys in their former Stations, and retire to their Respective Habitations, till Approach∣ing Spring Invites their Officers to Renew their Care, and Summon Back the Marriners to their Abandon'd Duty.</P>

<P>HE came amongst other Places to <HI>Leghorne,</HI> and took up Lodgings at an Inn, in order to Observe the Rarities of that well Peopled City, and Hapning to be Plac'd in an Appartment that Op'ned to the Pub∣lick Street, wou'd often take a Morning Walk about his Room, and looking Frequently upon the Street, Divert himself Agreeably by a Curious Observation of whatever Pass'd before him.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> for∣bid the Use of Wine.</NOTE>THE Use of Wine is in the <HI>Alcoran</HI> forbid the <HI>Turks</HI> on pain of the se∣verest Anger of their <HI>God</HI> and Prophet; yet they Publickly express their great Dislike of that Injunction, by the frequent drinking it in largest Quantities; in Men of Years and grave Appearance 'tis esteem'd a Crime beyond Excuse, to be inclin'd to common Drunkenness, and Men of High and <HI>Envied Posts,</HI> are careful how they show the smallest Inclination to the like Intemperance, lest they shou'd give a joyful Opportunity to their ob∣serving Enemies, to blame the Follies of their several Governments, as an impure Effect of lov'd Ebriety: But Men of Gay and Sprightly Tempers, Young, and unimploy'd in State Affairs, affect the Practice of continual Drinking; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet drink it to Extrava∣gance.</NOTE>nor is the Use of Wine by them conceiv'd as Sovereign by its <HI>Virtues,</HI> or <HI>enlivening</HI> Qualities, but by the downright Operation of a pow'rful <HI>Quantity,</HI> which skrews their Spirits to a strange Extravagance, and robs 'em wholly of their <HI>delug'd</HI> Reason, by the moist Effects of its <HI>in∣toxicating</HI> Nature.</P>
<P>THERE is a Custom I observ'd amongst the <HI>Turks,</HI> that they will often visit <HI>Christian</HI> Merchants, at their Country Houses, where, retir'd from fear of Publick Observation, they have convenient Time and Opportunity to Carouse at Pleasure, till becoming downright Drunk and Mad, they run immediately to mount their Horses, and tho' scarce able to continue on their Feet, when fix'd securely in their Saddles, begin to Spurr with rest∣less Fury, riding up and down from Hill to Valley, in a constant Gallop, till they grow again sedately Sober, and return to take a formal Leave of him whose Wine they quass'd so freely of.</P>
<P>THERE goes a pleasant Story of the Cause why <HI>Mahomet</HI> prohi∣bited the Use of Wine to all his Followers, which is related by the <HI>Turks</HI> themselves with these Particulars.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Story how <HI>Mahomet</HI> came to forbid his Followers the Use of Wine.</NOTE>THERE was a certain Shepherd in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Meccha,</HI> whose Possessions were so far Superior to the rest of his Fraternity, that he was Chosen as a Ruler of their whole Society, and exercis'd a sort of mild Authority, by the joint Permission of the Shepherds of that Country.</P>
<P>IT happen'd that this Man oppos'd with violence the Doctrine of the Impostor, then but newly vented in those very Parts wherein he liv'd, and all the Brotherhood depending upon him as on their Lord and Oracle, The crafty <HI>Mahomet</HI> perceiv'd it difficult without his Friendship to accomplish his Designs, and so resolv'd to court his Favour by the most respectful Marks of Honour and Civility.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY he came one Day to make a Visit to this pow'rful Shepherd, attended pompously by a magnificent and numerous Retinue; it hapned that a Daughter of this honest Mans was that Day Marry'd, and a splendid Entertainment made, to feast those many Guests who grac'd her Nuptials; when the Prophet enter'd, he saluted kindly all the Company with his most hearty Blessing, and sat him freely down among the rest, pretending great and wond'rous Satisfaction in their agreable and pleasant Conversation.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="86"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first and best Effect of Wine.</NOTE>THE merry Company a little Elevated with the Fumes of Wine, for∣got their Hatred to the Doctrine which he taught; and pleas'd to see him so familiar and respectful, grew extreamly fond of the Impostor's Person, shaking him by the Hand, embracing him with fervour, and saluting him with Kisses on his Cheeks and Forhead.</P>
<P>BUT Business leading him a little farther, he began to take his leave, and was detain'd against his Will by the uncommon Kindness of the Shep∣herd and his Family, who wou'd by no means suffer him to go, till he en∣gag'd himself by solemn Promise to return again as soon as he had ended what small Business he was then to go about. He went, and finish'd in an Hour or Two the utmost of his Task, and made all hast imaginable to be there again, imputing the Excess of their Civilities to the Virtue of the Wine they drank so plentifully, which he therefore bless'd, with oft repea∣ted Orders to his numerous Disciples, that they shou'd thenceforth drink a double Quantity of that Celestial Liquor, whose Effects produc'd such peaceable Engagements, and had Power to change the sharpest Hatred in∣to Love, and make a Friend of a profess'd and open Enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The last and worst Effect thereof.</NOTE>BUT when he came again among them, he perceiv'd a mighty Change in all their Humours; they were now become entirely Drunk, and turn'd the late Expressions of their Kindness, into rude, ungovern'd and tumultu∣ous Violence; him whom so lately they address'd with Kisses, now they Curse and strive to Murder; Noise and Discord, Fighting and Distraction, were the only Scenes he had before him; and in short, with much ado e∣scap'd alive, from their oppressive Injuries.</P>
<P>THE <HI>New Effect</HI> of this mistaken Liquor, urg'd the Prophet to a <HI>New Decree,</HI> as much against it, as the First had been in favour of it; for per∣ceiving now it cou'd excite Disorder, and give birth to <HI>Broils</HI> as well as <HI>Mirth,</HI> he chang'd the Sentence he so lately gave, and made it an <HI>Haraum</HI> for ever after, or <HI>Abomination</HI> not to be encourag'd by the Children of his People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> much divided in Re∣ligious Mat∣ters.</NOTE>THESE are the prevailing Tenets of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Faith, but differ widely from the <HI>Persian</HI> Doctrine; which last Nation, tho' the Followers of <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his Religion, do <HI>notwithstanding that,</HI> prefer before him <HI>Hali</HI> his Successor, and Usurper of his Empire, by the Claim of Marriage with the Prophet's Daughter, who in the end was overthrown and slain by <HI>Ebubeker, Omar</HI> and <HI>Osmyn,</HI> whose Opinions are at present follow'd, as believ'd Inspir'd like <HI>Mahomet</HI> himself, by all the <HI>Turks</HI> depending on the Government of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>: But as for <HI>Persia,</HI> She adheres intirely to the Thoughts of <HI>Hali,</HI> and esteems him not Inferior even to their fam'd Impostor.</P>
<P>THESE dissenting Notions and encreasing Differences in Opinion, have at last so far extended their pernicious Influences, that from small and gradual Breaches, they are now burst out to open Hatred of each others Persons; complaining mutually that either Side has added <HI>to</HI> or taken <HI>from</HI> the Substance of their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> as has been most agreable to their respective Interests, and the promotion of their own Opinions.</P>
<P>NAY to such unbounded Madness does their Hate arise, that not con∣tented to heap Loads of dreadful Curses on each others Heads, they set themselves in every Point directly opposite to one anothers Notions, the <HI>Turks</HI> remaining censur'd as <HI>Schismatical,</HI> by the adverse Exposition of the <HI>Persian</HI> Creed, and <HI>Persia</HI> Stigmatis'd for wilfull Heresy in more than <HI>Seven∣ty</HI> Places of the <HI>Turkish Alcoran.</HI></P>

<P>THE <HI>Persians</HI> never Shave the Hair upon their Upper Lip, but cut and trim the Beard upon their Chin, according to the various Forms their se∣veral Fancies lead 'em to make Choice of; whereas the <HI>Turks</HI> preserve with care a very <HI>long</HI> and <HI>spreading</HI> Beard, esteeming the Deficiency of that <HI>respected</HI> Ornament, a shameful Mark of servile Slavery.</P>
<P>SWINES-FLESH, and the Use of Wine, deny'd the <HI>Turks</HI> with strictest Prohibition, are by the <HI>Persians</HI> practis'd with a fond Indulgence; nor do the <HI>last</HI> distinguish Meats by <HI>Clean</HI> and <HI>Ʋnclean,</HI> but enjoy promi∣scuously the common Gifts of Nature's Liberality.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Persians</HI> when they wash their Feet before they Pray, do seldom more than stroke the outward Part with their Right Hand just dipp'd in Water, and hold it a superfluous Ceremony to rub hard as if they wash'd a∣way the Dirt; which <HI>last</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> believe a Duty of assur'd and <HI>indispensi∣ble</HI> Necessity.</P>
<P>A Number more of such-like opposite and contradictory Opinions, di∣vide the Faith and Interests of these Powerful Neighbours, who invent a yearly Store of black <HI>Invectives</HI> to attack alternately each others Doctrine; amongst which Curses none are more surprizing, odd and comical, than these which follow;</P>

A strange, uncommon, fatal Accident, fell out about the Year 1702, when I resided with his Excellency the Right Honourable the Lord <HI>Paget, then</HI> Embassador Extraordinary at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> Mediator and Plenipo∣tentiary at the Treaty of <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> whose truly Great and Noble Services have left behind him an Immortal Character, to the Interest and Honour of the <HI>British</HI> Nation, and the Admiration of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A most un∣happy Story of the total ru∣in of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Family.</NOTE>THERE was a <HI>Turk</HI> who liv'd in the abovenam'd City, not extrem∣ly <HI>Rich,</HI> but <HI>moderately</HI> stor'd with <HI>easy</HI> Plenty; he had a Wife so tenderly belov'd and gratefully returning a reciprocal Affection, that he wou'd not use the freedom of his Country, in regard to tolerated and indulg'd <HI>Poly∣gamy,</HI> but confin'd the Treasure of his honest Love, to the endearing Cen∣ter of his first Wife's Bosom: He had <HI>two</HI> Children by his Favorite Consort, one was <HI>then</HI> Four Years of Age, the other lay a Speechless Infant in its easy Cradle, when his Fruitful Wife became deliver'd of a Burthen, which de∣clar'd him Father of a Third and hopeful Son.</P>
<P>THE common Custom of a grateful Sacrifice on such Occasions, led him to prepare a splendid Feast, and summon all his near Relations to be Witnesses of his exceeding Joy for this new Blessing; they met together in an open Court, and after several usual Forms proceeded to the Place where many Sheep were kill'd to give the Poor. The Person who perform'd the Ceremony, cutting the Throat with a large Knife peculiar to that Office, and departing with the Company, to have the Sheep divided in another Place more fit for such an Action.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Cu∣riosity of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Infant.</NOTE>THERE was a Window open'd from the Room where the Child-bed Woman with her New-born Infant, lay upon a <HI>Saffrai</HI> elsewhere spoken of, at the Lettice of this Window stood the Eldest Son, and saw with pleasure the Performance of the Ceremony: He was much diverted to behold the Blood of the expiring Sheep run trickling from their Throats, and taking notice that the Knife wherewith 'twas done, was left behind by Chance or Negligence, and that the People who attended him, were <HI>some</HI> gone down to see the Sacrifice, and those above intently busied by his Mothers Mat∣tress; he endeavour'd slyly to escape Discovery, and stole away without so much as being any ways observ'd by those about him.</P>
<P>HE was no sooner out of Sight, but he descended by a Case of Marble Steps, directly to the Place where lay the Knife, yet <HI>red</HI> and <HI>reaking</HI> with the Blood of those poor Beasts, whose <HI>bleating</HI> Innocence it had so lately Sacrific'd.</P>
<P>HE took it up, and hiding it with all imaginable Cunning, underneath his Vest, return'd as slyly as he could, and enter'd the Appartment he so lately left, as unperceiv'd as he had just before departed from it.</P>

<P>I shall <HI>distinctly</HI> treat of all these Duties in their several proper and respe∣ctive Places; and as their Washing is a <HI>previous</HI> Ceremony to the other Four, it will be requisite I shou'd begin with an Account of that.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> de∣scended from the Race of <HI>Esau.</HI></NOTE>NOW tho' their Prophet has <HI>expressly</HI> order'd in the Lessons of his <HI>Al∣coran,</HI> that every <HI>Turk</HI> shall often Wash, declaring <HI>Cleanliness</HI> a valuable Part of his <HI>injoin'd</HI> Religion, yet the Custom is of more <HI>Antiquity</HI> than <HI>He,</HI> by many Ages; for the <HI>Turks</HI> derive it from the Days of <HI>Esau,</HI> whose <HI>Poste∣rity</HI> they boast themselves to be descended from, and therefore claim the Name of <HI>Ishmaelites.</HI> But tho' the ancient Institution of these Washings ow'd its being to the wholesome Practice of a cleanly People, and was ne∣ver meant a <HI>Sacred Ceremony,</HI> yet the fix'd Decree of their ador'd <HI>Impostor,</HI> has inclin'd the <HI>Turks</HI> to such a strange Opinion of its efficacious Virtues, that they now believe the Water they make use of, not alone sufficient for the cleansing all the <HI>outward</HI> Parts of their polluted Bodies, but of Sov'reign Power to wash away their Sins, and free from Guilt the most <HI>internal</HI> Pas∣sages of their impurest Souls.</P>

The reason why they are so cheaply serv'd, is ow∣ing to the great Revenues left to <HI>Bagnio</HI>'s by <HI>deceas'd Mahometans,</HI> who 'mongst the other Dictates of their <HI>Morality,</HI> hold it as a very <HI>meritorious</HI> Deed, to build a Publick <HI>Bagnio, Hospital,</HI> or other Place of Entertainment for <HI>benighted</HI> Travellers, and <HI>endow</HI> the same with an <HI>extensive</HI> Liberality.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Men deny'd Entrance, while the Wo∣men bathe.</NOTE>THESE <HI>Publick Baths</HI> are very common in their largest Cities, and receive <HI>at several Hours,</HI> prodigious Numbers of either <HI>Sex,</HI> and every <HI>Qua∣lity,</HI> for whose <HI>distinct</HI> and <HI>separate</HI> Accommodation, they afford <HI>divided</HI> and <HI>particular</HI> Conveniencies. When Women Bathe, a large and <HI>Ivory-headed Indian</HI> Cane is plac'd against the Door that opens from the Street, and no Man dares on pain of <HI>Death,</HI> at such a time as that, claim Entrance.</P>
<P>THE Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> obliges every <HI>Turk</HI> to bathe his Body when he has <HI>Caress'd</HI> a Woman, and the Ladies are oblig'd to do the same, so that e∣very Morning when they rise, the first Employment of the Day is washing in the <HI>Bagnio,</HI> where they are not only cleans'd with Water, but <HI>perfum'd,</HI> and dried with <HI>scented</HI> Linen. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hair,</HI> how taken off without the Razor.</NOTE>The Heads of <HI>Men</HI> are daily Shav'd, and <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women</HI> are alike injoin'd to leave no <HI>Hair</HI> on any other Part.

<P>BUT as the frequent use of the <HI>abovenam'd</HI> Powder is of <HI>dangerous</HI> Con∣sequence, if suffer'd to continue but a <HI>moment</HI> longer than the falling of the Hair; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some use Pincers.</NOTE>the more Polite and Fashionable Ladies, rather choose to use the help of Pincers, and <HI>irradicate</HI> it swiftly by a <HI>twitching</HI> violence; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Others shav'd by Waiting Maids.</NOTE>yet this is only done by such as would distinguish all their Actions from the custo∣mary Practices of other People, for the <HI>Generality</HI> of <HI>Turkish Ladies,</HI> caring little for the Pain of using Pincers, and unwilling to descend to vulgar Methods, constantly appoint some favorite <HI>Waiting-maid</HI> to play the <HI>Bar∣ber,</HI> and perform that Office with a <HI>sharp-edg'd Razor.</HI></P>

<P>HOWEVER, as 'tis natural for the working Brains of Man to fix <HI>attentively</HI> on some peculiar and selected Object, how wide soever from the fashionable Practice of the Times they live in; so <HI>some</HI> are found <HI>among the Turks,</HI> whose native Curiosity inclines them to the search of what <HI>small share of Knowledge</HI> they can <HI>possibly</HI> attain from the perusal of those <HI>few</HI> and <HI>tri∣fling Books</HI> they have among them.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of making <HI>Turkish</HI> Verse.</NOTE>THE <HI>Turkish</HI> Poetry consists of certain short and broken Measures, chain'd <HI>most commonly</HI> to double Rhymes, that so that <HI>jingle of the Numbers</HI> may atone <HI>as much as possible,</HI> for the unpleasant roughness of the Cadence; they confine their <HI>Muses</HI> for the most part, to <HI>low</HI> and <HI>doggrel</HI> Balads, or the whining Composition of some amorous Pastoral; yet some few are sound among them, of a very <HI>brisk</HI> and <HI>sprightly Wit,</HI> who will on <HI>Weddings, Victories,</HI> or other such occasions, exert their Faculties in forming some∣thing like a <HI>Panegyrick, Epithalamium, Ode,</HI> or witty <HI>Anagram,</HI> and hav∣ing done their utmost, with design to please the <HI>Patrons</HI> they address, receive a Present equal to the <HI>merit</HI> of the Work, or rather given accor∣ding

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Examples are the surest means of teaching any thing.</NOTE>BUT <HI>Examples</HI> will be most diverting, and inform the Reader more exactly of their peculiar Tast of several sorts of Poetry; I <HI>therefore</HI> now proceed to come as near as I can trace their Language, to some <HI>remarkable</HI> and <HI>celebrated</HI> Turns of <HI>Turkish Wit,</HI> whereby the <HI>Authors</HI> gain'd a great and lasting Reputation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A pleasant Story of a <HI>Turk</HI> who hir'd Poets to make Verses on his Wed∣ding.</NOTE>THERE was a noted <HI>Turk,</HI> who liv'd in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and had lately gain'd the Parents Approbation of a certain Lady, <HI>young,</HI> and <HI>beau∣tiful</HI>; they were married, and their <HI>Nuptials</HI> celebrated with a Splendour equal to their Fortunes, which were great and plentiful: The Sports, per∣form'd on such occasions, drew the Observation of all sorts of People, who were treated and caress'd with wonderful Civility; among the rest, <HI>un∣willing to omit the smallest point of lofty Liberality,</HI> the joyful <HI>Bridegroom</HI> sent an Invitation to the most esteem'd, and brightest <HI>Poets</HI> of the City; assur∣ing them they should receive an hearty welcome; and to tempt the trial of their utmost Skill, inform'd 'em, he design'd a good Reward for him, who made the finest Verses, in <HI>congratulation</HI> of his Marriage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Poets feasted by the Bridegroom.</NOTE>THE summon'd <HI>Bards</HI> appear'd immediately, and having feasted plen∣tifully on the Bridegroom's Entertainment, thought it proper to remember what they came for, and retiring severally to the private Arbours of their Patron's Garden, soon compos'd the <HI>mercenary</HI> Praises he expected from them, and returning to the Place where waited the impatient Company, repeated <HI>every Man his own Performance,</HI> each submitted, <HI>each in hopes of pre∣ference,</HI> to the decisive Judgment of a fair <HI>Majority.</HI></P>
<P>THE Consequences of this famous Battle of the <HI>Turkish Muses,</HI> having made some noise about the City, many Copies of their <HI>aukward Panegyricks</HI> were distributed about; and since I was oblig'd by an Acquaintance with an <HI>Italian</HI> Translation of them all, I wou'd not think the Pains too great, <HI>for the diversion of my Reader,</HI> to present him with their Verses in a <HI>British</HI> Dress; the first are these which follow.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Notions thereof a sort of Paradox.</NOTE>THE Notion of the <HI>Turks</HI> concerning <HI>Musick,</HI> will appear a <HI>Paradox,</HI> for they abhor the <HI>brisk</HI> and <HI>airy</HI> Tunes of <HI>Christian</HI> Composition, and alike despise the dulcid Notes and melancholy, soft, complaining Strokes of grave <HI>Sonata</HI>'s; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The shape of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Ghit∣tarr.</NOTE>yet are they never easy <HI>when alone,</HI> unless they have a kind of course <HI>Ghitarr,</HI> or such a sort of Instrument, consisting commonly of se∣veral Wires, upon a long and slender wooden Body, with a round, capa∣cious hollow head, the form whereof is represented in the <HI>Cutt</HI> relating to the <HI>Graecian Wedding,</HI> in the one and twentieth Chapter, above the Letter <HI>I</HI> on the right hand of the Figures.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of using it.</NOTE>WITH this dull Instrument the solitary <HI>Turks</HI> divert themselves, in e∣very Place, and every Company; they place it in the left hand, and tur∣ning its unweildy Belly to their Sides, with the unheeding Fingers of their other Hand, strike up and down <HI>at random</HI> all the Wires, and whine out horrid, and unpleasant Noises, to the <HI>hum-drum</HI> Echo's of their barbarous Instrument.</P>

<P>Q. <HI>What else are you requir'd to do to such poor Animals?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I am oblig'd to load my Camels and all other Beasts of Bur∣then, favourably, and with pity; buy the <HI>Birds</HI> that pine in <HI>Cages</HI> for their absent Mates, and let them fly away to seek lost Liberty.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> With the unfeign'd Duty of a meek Humility; as becomes the Honour of those Persons, from whom, <HI>next God,</HI> I had my Being.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How will you deal with your Neighbours?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Love those, who love me; hate those, who hate me; kill those, who strive to kill me; but never give back <HI>Ill</HI> for <HI>Good,</HI> nor <HI>Good</HI> for <HI>Evil.</HI></P>

<P>CONCERN'D to view so sad a Spectacle, the melancholy <HI>Sackah</HI> soon return'd, and telling every Man he saw the Accident he met with, endless Crouds of curious People flock'd to see the headless Trunk of this unknown, and miserable Object; for a <HI>Week</HI> or <HI>Two</HI> it made a mighty noise about the Town, and great Enquiries were <HI>for some time made,</HI> in or∣der to discover the inhuman Author of this strange Barbarity.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A usefull Pro∣ject for a skill∣full Brewer.</NOTE><HI>LONDON</HI> contains an unknown number of ingenious <HI>Brewers,</HI> who for want of Stock to carry on a creditable Trade, are forc'd to live in mean Conditions, Servants to the <HI>wealthier</HI> and more <HI>thriving</HI> Brothers of the same Profession: Let such as these consider well their present Circum∣stances, and learn by what I now proceed to treat of, how they may im∣prove them.</P>
<P>BRANDY, <HI>Wine,</HI> and all strong Liquors known in <HI>Turkey,</HI> are un∣lawfull to their Use, by the aforesaid Prohibition of their <HI>Prophet Mahomet,</HI> yet are these People so inclin'd to drinking, that <HI>for want of other pleasing Be∣verages</HI> they will often venture publick Scandal, and severest Punishments, to satisfie the Call of their insatiate Appetites, by drinking <HI>Wine</HI> in such prodigious quantities, that I forbear to mention what <HI>my Eyes</HI> have often witness'd, lest it shou'd <HI>with difficulty</HI> gain belief.</P>
<P>NOW this excessive love of <HI>Wine,</HI> proceeds from nothing else but their <HI>complain'd-of</HI> Ignorance, in Brewing other Liquors, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> ex∣treamly fond of <HI>English</HI> Beer</NOTE>for I frequently ob∣serv'd that when an <HI>English</HI> Ship had brought some Bottles of our Country <HI>Beer</HI> or <HI>Ale</HI> to <HI>Turkey,</HI> and presented 'em to such as afterwards wou'd com∣pliment the noted <HI>Turks</HI> of their Acquaintance with a share in drinking them, they constantly express'd a wonderfull Esteem, and eager Inclination to obtain a Quantity, assuring us <HI>repeatedly,</HI> that cou'd they make such

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Habits.</HEAD>
<P>GOVERNMENTS so <HI>absolute</HI> and <HI>tyrannical</HI> as that of <HI>Turkey,</HI> give us little reason, by the Notions we conceive of their unpo∣lish'd Constitution, to expect Examples of a <HI>common Decency,</HI> much less <HI>exact Oeconomy,</HI> from the untaught and rustical Deport∣ment of their rough Inhabitants.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An exemplary Prudence of the <HI>Turks</HI> in point of dress.</NOTE>YET to my great surprize, I found the <HI>Turks</HI> in many things, <HI>I speak it with concern,</HI> more prudent, or <HI>at least</HI> more orderly, than any part of <HI>Christendom, particularly so</HI> in that accomplish'd Regularity observ'd among them in respect to <HI>Dress</HI>; you may <HI>with ease</HI> distinguish there, the <HI>Mistress</HI> from her <HI>Waiting Maid,</HI> and know the <HI>Quality</HI> of any Man you meet by the peculiar Ornaments of his <HI>restrain'd Appearance; there,</HI> no <HI>Footmen</HI> huff along ridiculously vain, as if they wore their Master's <HI>Honour</HI> in the lining of his <HI>Livery:</HI> Those look great <HI>among the Turks,</HI> who really are so, and a mo∣dest Carriage, and sincere Humility adorn the <HI>Persons</HI> of the common People.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> observe the Custom of the Ancients in respect of Habit.</NOTE>THE ancient Custom of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Nations, who delighted much in <HI>long</HI> and <HI>open Habits,</HI> is <HI>to this Day</HI> prevalent among the <HI>Turks</HI>; nor do they ever change the Fashion of their Dress, esteeming little such as are misled to frequent Alterations of the Cloaths they wear, and hating with a <HI>fix'd</HI> and <HI>rancour'd Enmity,</HI> the modish Shape of <HI>Christian</HI> Habits, asserting that by openly exposing <HI>Legs</HI> and <HI>Thighs,</HI> and wearing <HI>Coats</HI> so <HI>short</HI> and <HI>close,</HI> we do not only act <HI>immodestly,</HI> but by the Follies of a <HI>fond, fantastic,</HI> and <HI>af∣fected Levity,</HI> (for which they willfully mistake our <HI>Conge's</HI> and genteel De∣portment) entirely rob our selves of that <HI>grave Majesty,</HI> which shou'd di∣stinguish <HI>Man</HI> from <HI>other Creatures.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inconve∣niencies of wearing 'em.</NOTE>ANOTHER Inconvenience which attends the wearing these above-nam'd Slippers, is the custom they have got of leaving 'em without, <HI>like Womens Clogs,</HI> at every Door they chance to enter, so that <HI>often,</HI> when I have been present at their stately <HI>Visits, Feasts,</HI> or <HI>Publick Ceremonies,</HI> com∣ing out amidst a Crowd of People, I have sometimes found my Slippers chang'd, and others, <HI>soil'd,</HI> and not worth <HI>wearing,</HI> left me in their room, nay very often have been forc'd to walk thro' all the Dirt, with nothing on my Feet but <HI>Mests,</HI> which letting in the wet, were worse than if I had gone home barefooted; <HI>Coaches</HI> are not found in <HI>Turkish Cities,</HI> as esteem'd an idle Proof of an <HI>Effeminate Indulgence.</HI></P>

ENCREASE <HI>and Multiply,</HI> is held a very good and necessary Max∣im by the <HI>Turkish Nation,</HI> and indeed they lose no time nor opportunity of putting it in execution to the best advantage; <HI>Wives, Slaves,</HI> and <HI>Concu∣bines,</HI> promiscuously granted them without controul, and every <HI>Tenet</HI> of their <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of their <HI>Lives,</HI> combining jointly to indulge their Wishes, in the gross Enjoyment of a sensual Appetite.</P>
<P>POLYGAMY was by <HI>Mahomet</HI> allow'd them, freely and unbounded, but the Dictates of their Policy oblig'd 'em to restrain that tolerated Li∣berty, and fix a certain <HI>Limit</HI> to that dangerous Privilege for the Reasons following.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reasons why the <HI>Turks</HI> restrain Poly∣gamy.</NOTE>WERE Men permitted to indulge their Senses in the various Pleasures of promiscuous Embraces, they wou'd Marry inconsiderately such a num∣ber of <HI>Wives,</HI> that on their Death, the <HI>major part</HI> of their Estates devolving to the <HI>Sultan,</HI> little wou'd be left to share amongst them, and the <HI>helpless Ladies</HI> consequently forc'd to <HI>Want</HI> and <HI>Beggary.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER Reason (and indeed the wisest of the two) is this, The numerous <HI>Doubts, Fears, Envies, Jealousies,</HI> and <HI>Quarrels,</HI> which al∣ternately possess a Womans Mind, where <HI>Rivals</HI> are respected, wou'd by tolerating many Wives, become so <HI>frequent, formidable,</HI> and <HI>ungovern'd,</HI> that those <HI>Fairy Pleasures,</HI> which invite to <HI>Matrimony,</HI> vanishing away, wou'd leave behind 'em little else but <HI>Noise</HI> and <HI>Discord, Troubles</HI> and <HI>Distraction.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How many Wives the <HI>Turks</HI> may Marry.</NOTE>HOWEVER, they are yet permitted by the common Custom, to espouse four <HI>lawful Wives</HI>; and lest their wand'ring Inclinations shou'd in∣duce 'em to believe they were denied a Pleasure <HI>Heaven</HI> design'd 'em, they are freely suffer'd to enjoy the Persons of as many <HI>Concubines,</HI> or <HI>purchas'd Slaves,</HI> as they may think agreable, nor are the Children so begot esteem'd in <HI>Turkey</HI> as in <HI>Christian Countries,</HI> spurious and illegitimate, but equally intit'led to their <HI>Father</HI>'s Love, and Honour of his Quality, with others born in Wedlock.</P>

<P>THUS they pass away the time till almost Midnight, when they take the <HI>Bride</HI> with one consent, and lead her to the <HI>Bagnio,</HI> if there is one in the House, <HI>if not</HI> a common <HI>Bathing Tub</HI> will serve the turn. <HI>Here</HI> every <HI>Gossip</HI> plucks a Feather, till having quite undress'd the <HI>helpless Virgin,</HI> they begin to <HI>wash</HI> and <HI>rub</HI> her soundly, smoothing o'er her Body, with a certain <HI>scented</HI> and <HI>balsamick Oyntment,</HI> the better to prepare her for approaching Pleasures; after this they put her on a Shift, and wrapping Night-Gown, thence conducting her to take her Rest till early the next Morning.</P>

<P>HE is not tedious <HI>we'll suppose,</HI> in dressing, but with all the Friends he entertain'd the Night before, sets forward from his House well mounted, and attended by a gallant Troop of Gentlemen on Horseback, Serenaded as they go, by several sorts of Musick, sounding with them thro' the Streets.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Bride receives him.</NOTE>BUT the tender natur'd Nymph, unwilling to confound at first Ap∣pearance, calls him back with gentle Phrases, and the mild Expression of <HI>Gehl Giacquir bennum,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Return, my good Angel</HI>; this encou∣ragement removes all fear, and tempts him forward till his new-made <HI>Consort</HI> takes him by the Hand, and leads him to a Table, little higher than the Ground; she seats him cross-leg'd there upon a fine embroid'red Cushion, and sits down herself in the same Posture, <HI>opposite</HI> to him; all the Company <HI>then</HI> place themselves on Cushions, six Foot distant from the <HI>ogling</HI> Spouses, till they form a fine and spacious Circle round the Table.</P>

<P>THEN put they both their Hands <HI>together</HI> on the Table, taking <HI>each</HI> one half of the divided <HI>Pidgeon; which</HI> denotes, that they shou'd live <HI>like harmless Turtles,</HI> and that tho' the <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Tail</HI> make some distinction, yet they ought to love and prize each other, as two diff'rent Parts of one sole Body.</P>
<P>THIS done, the <HI>Bride</HI> extends her Hand, and reaching from the other Plate a piece of the abovenam'd <HI>Barley-Sugar,</HI> directs her Fingers to her <HI>Husband</HI>'s Mouth, and makes him swallow it; <HI>he</HI> does the same to her a∣gain, by this expression of their silent Will, declaring <HI>mutually</HI> that it shall be always <HI>eithers</HI> chief endeavour to oblige the other, by a constant practice of the sweetest Carriage, and most tender Actions which can prove <HI>Af∣fection.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A very merry kind of Pra∣ctice for the Punishment of Levity.</NOTE>BUT the most diverting sort of a <HI>Divorce,</HI> that e'er was heard of, is the <HI>Oochey Tahalac,</HI> which having <HI>once</HI> disjoin'd a Pair, permits no second thoughts, or change of Inclination so as to be <HI>reconcil'd again</HI>; till, as a Pu∣nishment for his <HI>ridiculous</HI> and <HI>fickle Humour,</HI> the repenting Husband will contentedly stand by, and see his <HI>Wife in open Day,</HI> enjoy'd before his face, by some brisk Stranger, who is led by accident to pass the House, where they expect <HI>impatiently</HI> the first fair Comer.</P>
<P>A pleasant Passage hap'ning, some Years since, at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> will afford an <HI>entertaining</HI> and <HI>compleat Idea</HI> of this humorous Custom; it fell out as follows.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A pleasant Story of the Master of an <HI>English</HI> Vessel.</NOTE>THE Master of an <HI>English Merchant Ship,</HI> who understood but little <HI>Turkish,</HI> scarce enough to buy an <HI>Orange</HI> as he walk'd the Streets, wou'd needs be vent'ring frequently <HI>on Shoar,</HI> sometimes <HI>with Company</HI> and some∣times <HI>without,</HI> well dress'd, with <HI>Turbant, Dolamann,</HI> and every other part of Habit <HI>in the Turkish Fashion</HI>; he was often caution'd of the Dangers he might fall into, but never list'ned to his Friends Advice, returning always safely to his Ship, without the least Affront, or meeting any who ac∣costed him in the Country Language.</P>
<P>BUT rambling <HI>on a certain Day,</HI> about the City, he was beck'ned to by several <HI>Turks</HI> who stood <HI>together</HI> at the entrance of a House; surpriz'd at first, he wou'd have pass'd 'em slowly by, as if he took no notice of their Summons; but before he got five Yards beyond the Door, he felt himself <HI>pull'd back</HI> by one, who <HI>smiling,</HI> spoke a <HI>long</HI> and <HI>speedy Sentence,</HI> and retur∣ning towards the Door he came from, dragg'd him <HI>as it were by force</HI> to fol∣low him.</P>
<P>THE Master understood not one small <HI>Syllable</HI> of what he said, but went as he was led, without so much as speaking all the way, till coming to the Door, the other Company began to laugh, and talk with eagerness as if they were informing him of something very pleasant, and diverting; he seem'd to listen with a wonderfull attention, and to cloak the matter, laugh'd for Company, but durst not speak for fear of a Discovery; he <HI>then</HI> began to curse his forwardness and <HI>Turkish Habit,</HI> and to wish himself <HI>secure</HI> on board his Ship, resolving to attempt no more such <HI>single Wander∣ings.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A comical Surprize.</NOTE>MEAN while the <HI>Turks</HI> had led him forward, and conducted him to a large Chamber, on the <HI>elevated Floor</HI> whereof there lay a <HI>Bed,</HI> with <HI>Quilt</HI> and <HI>Mattress,</HI> after the Fashion of the Country; upon the Bed sat <HI>cross-leg'd</HI> a genteel, young Lady, gay, and beautifull, with Face <HI>unveil'd,</HI> and sprightly Countenance, who blush'd at his appearance; on a <HI>Cushion</HI> not far distant sat a grave <HI>Kaddee</HI> or <HI>Judge,</HI> the Master of the House; and in a corner of the Room, stood <HI>leaning,</HI> and <HI>disconsolate,</HI> a well-made <HI>Turk,</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="148"/>
who <HI>by the sequel,</HI> prov'd to be the Husband of <HI>the Lady on the Bed,</HI> and standing <HI>there,</HI> to be <HI>Spectator</HI> of a Duty he wou'd rather have ex∣cus'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A very doubt∣full State.</NOTE>THE Company withdrew at the approach of the Master, leaving none behind but the <HI>young Lady</HI> and her <HI>Husband,</HI> smiling as they pass'd him by, and pulling to the Door to keep them private. 'Tis not difficult to guess the wonder, which amus'd his thoughts at such an <HI>odd</HI> and unexpected Ac∣cident; he star'd about him like a Man distracted, ignorant what he was to do, and fearing <HI>every Moment</HI> some Design, which he conceiv'd was form'd against him.</P>
<P>AT last, the <HI>Husband</HI> looking roughly towards him, spoke a few low Words, which <HI>by the accent</HI> seem'd uneasy, and with <HI>a nod or two,</HI> and <HI>mo∣tion of his Hand,</HI> made Signs, that he shou'd do the Duty he was call'd to without delay; the Lady <HI>likewise,</HI> beck'ned with her Finger, and repeated often these Words, <HI>Gehl Adham Gehl,</HI> that is, <HI>Come Man come</HI>; he under∣stood <HI>so much,</HI> but no ways apprehending what they meant by those ex∣pressive Motions, instead of answering their repeated Invitations, <HI>stood still,</HI> and gaz'd about with mute <HI>Astonishment.</HI></P>
<P>THE Husband half amaz'd to see his Silence, and fix'd Posture, as al∣so eager, <HI>since he knew it must be done,</HI> to have it over, came grimly up, and pushing him with anger <HI>forward,</HI> cried out aloud. <HI>Geddi Brai, Boc Kahdin,</HI> that is, <HI>Go Fool, see the Lady:</HI> But the frighted <HI>Britain,</HI> all surpriz'd at this new step, was so confounded with the turns of the <HI>amazing Accident,</HI> that scarce rememb'ring <HI>who</HI> or <HI>where</HI> he was, he forc'd himself with fury from the <HI>Turk,</HI> and in the <HI>English Tongue</HI> cried out, <HI>Why in the Devil's Name d'ye push me thus? I know not what you wou'd be at, nor understand one Word you say to me.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An odd dis∣covery.</NOTE>THE shock'd <HI>Mahometan</HI> with all imaginable wonder started back, to hear him speak an unknown Language, and snatching off his <HI>Turbant,</HI> pre∣sently discover'd him a <HI>Christian</HI> by the manner of his being shav'd; and <HI>pointing to his Head</HI> cry'd loudly to his Wife, <HI>Vollah Boo Adham Gaour. By the Lord this Man's an Infidel.</HI> With that he drew his Dagger from his Gir∣dle, and his <HI>Wife</HI> began in passion to rise up and fall upon the <HI>Master,</HI> when the <HI>Turk</HI> bethought him of a cunning Stratagem to save his Honour, and having given the <HI>English Man</HI> his <HI>Turbant</HI> back again, endeavour'd <HI>partly by fair Words</HI> and <HI>partly by his Signs,</HI> to make him understand, he shou'd go out as silently as he came in, and seem to smile, as if he had been pleas'd with his Adventure.</P>
<P>THE trembling Master, glad of any opportunity to get away from such a dangerous Scene of Wonders, made abundance of expressive moti∣ons with his <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Hands,</HI> to thank him for his kindness, and was marching off, with counterfeited Smiles upon his Face, when all the Com∣pany still waiting in the outward Room, began to gather round him, and to ask him if he had been satisfied in his <HI>good-fortune</HI>; he answer'd as the <HI>Husband</HI> had made shift to teach him, <HI>Hevett Sultanum</HI>; that is, <HI>Yes noble Sir.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A merry Acti∣on of a <HI>Tur∣kish</HI> Lady.</NOTE>But the expecting Wife, who had <HI>it seems</HI> been baulk'd of her Desire, and was unwilling tho' she lost the <HI>Christian's Kindness,</HI> to deprive her self of some more qualified Person's, follow'd to the Door, and cried out <HI>Yoketer</HI> that is, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he lies,</HI> as loud as she was able.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Women, in General.</HEAD>
<P>IF by the Title of the Chapter, the Reader may be induc'd to expect a particular Account of the <HI>exterior</HI> Qualifications of the <HI>Turkish La∣dies</HI>; he must imagine a difference in their <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Complexions,</HI> answerable to the Climate of a <HI>hotter</HI> or <HI>colder</HI> Country; whose <HI>various Influences</HI> must unquestionably produce as <HI>various Effects</HI> in the Persons of its Natives: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turkish</HI> Wives submis∣sive and re∣spectfull to their Hus∣bands.</NOTE>But as the unlimited Authority, which the <HI>Turks</HI> usurp as a right of Nature, over their submissive Wives, extends its force to the re∣motest Borders of their <HI>unmeasur'd Empire.</HI> The continued Practice of a <HI>Con∣jugal Obedience,</HI> has bent the nature of their haughtiest Women, to acknow∣ledge readily an <HI>inferiority of Sex,</HI> and obey their Husbands with the strictest Duties of an unfeign'd Humility. This usefull Maxim which is for ever taught 'em, with the earliest Rudiments of their infant Knowledge, has, <HI>among many other,</HI> this one Effect, that by representing the <HI>Women,</HI> even in their own Imaginations, <HI>subservient</HI> to the Will of <HI>Man,</HI> it inspires them all with an ardent Zeal, in the daily Practice of those <HI>alluring</HI> Parts of Edu∣cation, which may render their Persons most charming and agreable to the happy Object of their exalted Wishes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Ad∣vantages thereof.</NOTE>MANY, <HI>besides this,</HI> are the great Advantages the <HI>Turks</HI> receive from their Wives <HI>Subjection</HI>; for it entirely frees 'em from the <HI>imperious</HI> Behavi∣our of <HI>insulting Yoke-Mates</HI>; keeps 'em secure from the uneasy Discords of a <HI>jealous Consort,</HI> and gives their leisure Hours an entire Possession of the fullest Pleasures, to be found in <HI>Matrimony</HI>; while the common Plagues, and
<PB N="110" REF="152"/>
bitter Minutes of some <HI>Europaean Marriages</HI> are altogether strangers to the sweet Enjoyment of their <HI>Consummate Happiness.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Wives are kept in <HI>Turkey.</HI></NOTE>'TIS a sense of awfull <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Duty,</HI> that obliges them contentedly to live <HI>at Home,</HI> without the smallest Power in Domestick matters, shut up <HI>together</HI> in a long Appartment, divided <HI>like our Hospitals</HI> for several Beds, where free from <HI>Envy, Pride</HI> or <HI>Jealousy,</HI> they <HI>Eat, Drink,</HI> and <HI>Work together,</HI> Guarded by the Watchful Observation of <HI>Industrious Eunuchs,</HI> and excluded from the Society of <HI>Men,</HI> above Ten Years Old, never Stirring from their Houses, nor making Visits to their Neighbours, but all entirely bent to please <HI>by turns</HI> the Wandring will of their Respected Husband.</P>
<P>THESE then are the <HI>Chief Accomplishments</HI> of their Womens Minds, which are Moulded by the <HI>same Customs,</HI> to the <HI>same Nature,</HI> in every Part of their Country: And tho' some Provinces have been esteem'd more Fa∣mous than others for the Beauty of their Women; the Following Account will serve as a Description of the <HI>Turkish Ladies.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Excel∣lence of their Complexions.</NOTE>THEIR <HI>Complexions</HI> are for the most Part, of a <HI>Lovely Fair,</HI> and with∣out the help of <HI>Art</HI> so exquisitely <HI>Smooth</HI> and <HI>Ruddy,</HI> that 'tis beyond the Power of <HI>Imagination</HI> to Guess at their <HI>Beauty,</HI> which Extraordinary Per∣fection they owe to their so frequent use of <HI>Bathing,</HI> and Perpetual Confine∣ment to their Houses, by which means they are never Ruffled by the <HI>Changes</HI> of the <HI>Weather,</HI> nor subject to the Sultry Influences of a <HI>Scorching Sun,</HI> but 'tis observable that they lose their Beauty much sooner than the Inhabitants of the <HI>Northern World,</HI> for the daily use of <HI>Bagnio</HI>'s, tho' it smooths their Skin, and softens their Complexions, does <HI>notwithstanding,</HI> prejudice their Constitu∣tions by the Warm effects of its <HI>Sulphureous Quality.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Discription of the Persons of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Ladies.</NOTE>Their <HI>Features</HI> are Gene∣rally most agreeably <HI>Regular,</HI> of an exact and sweet Proportion, their <HI>Eyes</HI> of a Piercing <HI>Black,</HI> almost Transparently <HI>Bright</HI> and <HI>Striking,</HI> and the larger they are, the more Esteem'd, for so vast a Value do the <HI>Turks</HI> Profess for <HI>Great Ey'd Ladies,</HI> that the Enjoyment of such is by <HI>Mahomet</HI> promis'd them as one of the Sublimest Joys of their <HI>Chimerical Paradise,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arch'd Eye-Brows Judg'd a Beauty by the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE>the <HI>Arched Excel∣lency</HI> of their <HI>Eye-brows,</HI> is no small Addition to the Beauty of their Features, and so Nicely sensible they are of this Perfection, that where <HI>Nature</HI> has de∣ny'd 'em so agreeable a Charm, they are never contented till by the <HI>repeat∣ed</HI> Applications of <HI>Artificial Endeavours,</HI> they raise their Brows to a lofty <HI>Semicircle,</HI> meeting over their Nose in a <HI>Sharp</HI> and <HI>Gracefull Angle.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Shapes and Aires.</NOTE>I can hardly speak of their <HI>Shapes,</HI> with so large <HI>Encomiums</HI> as I have done of their <HI>Beauty,</HI> since the Looseness of their <HI>Dress,</HI> denies them that <HI>forc'd Slenderness of Wast,</HI> so much admir'd by our <HI>Europaean Ladies</HI>; but tho' they boast not <HI>that one Excellency,</HI> Nature has adorn'd 'em with a <HI>Thousand others,</HI> which sufficiently supply its want, for their Bodies have somewhat of <HI>an agreeable turn,</HI> and their Motions carry a <HI>Peculiar Grace</HI> in an <HI>Easy</HI> and <HI>un∣affected</HI> Freedom of behaviour, the Native Chams of an <HI>Amorous Softness</HI> appear unfeignedly in <HI>every look,</HI> while <HI>every Step</HI> bears somewhat of an Air not altogether free from a <HI>Majestic Gravity,</HI> and yet entirely Govern'd by an <HI>Ʋncommon Easiness.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turkish</HI> Ladies are Lasciviously inclin'd.</NOTE>I am sorry (after so <HI>true,</HI> yet <HI>great</HI> a Character of their <HI>Persons</HI>) to De∣scend to the Weakness of their <HI>unguarded Vertue,</HI> which lies so open and <HI>Ʋn∣fortifyed by Principle,</HI> as to be Incapable of resisting the smallest Temptation of a Favourable Opportunity. This Vice of <HI>Incontinency</HI> is undoubtedly no <HI>Hereditary</HI> Misfortune deriv'd from their <HI>Ancestors,</HI> since most of the <HI>Modern Turks,</HI> especially those of <HI>Europe,</HI> are Descended from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the old Inhabitants of that Subverted Country; a Nation so entirely free from <HI>Lewdness</HI> and <HI>Immorality,</HI> that they Instructed all the World in the <HI>Sublimest</HI>

<HI>Vertues.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The reasons of their Lewd¦ness.</NOTE>The warm Desires which at present sway the looser Inclinations of the <HI>Turkish Ladies,</HI> are rather the effects of their unnatural Confinement, and the strict <HI>Prohibition</HI> they are under from the Society of <HI>Mankind,</HI> which raising their Imaginations to an opinion of a more elevated Bliss, than is really found in the Conversation of <HI>our Sex,</HI> enflames their <HI>Wishes,</HI> as it heightens their <HI>Curiosity,</HI> and renders the coldest Constitution of 'em all an easy Conquest to the first Addresses of an advent'rous Lover; and 'tis no wonder they have no more regard to their <HI>Vertue</HI> or their <HI>Honour,</HI> while the Duties of <HI>Religion</HI> are never taught 'em; but <HI>on the contrary,</HI> their Mind's possess'd, that as <HI>God</HI> has given them a Soul <HI>inferiour to that of Man,</HI> he exacts less Service from the <HI>Female Sex,</HI> whom he only created for the <HI>Ʋse</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of the <HI>nobler Males.</HI></P>
<P>BY these Notions, and the want of Liberty <HI>before-mention'd,</HI> they are all led to so vast an esteem of <HI>Men,</HI> that they scarce know a difference in their <HI>Merits,</HI> receiving <HI>promiscuously</HI> all such as <HI>Chance</HI> or <HI>Assurance</HI> throws in their way, and proceeding without the Ceremonies of a <HI>formal Courtship</HI> to a plenary Satisfaction of their lewd Desires; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lewd∣ness of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Ladies, when they can convey some Stranger into their Appart∣ments.</NOTE>and so <HI>lascivious</HI> are their Inclinations, that if <HI>by the ingenuity of their Contrivances</HI> they can procure the Company of <HI>some Stranger</HI> in their Chamber, they claim <HI>unanimously</HI> an equal share of his <HI>Caresses,</HI> and proceed <HI>by Lots</HI> to the Enjoyment of his Per∣son; nor can he be permitted to leave them, till having exerted his <HI>utmost Vigour</HI> in the Embraces of the <HI>whole Company,</HI> he becomes incapable of fur∣ther Service, and is dispatch'd with the <HI>Thanks</HI> and <HI>Presents</HI> of the oblig'd Family.</P>
<P>I will desire my Reader's Patience while I entertain him with a fair Ex∣ample of the <HI>Levity</HI> for which I thus accuse the <HI>Turkish Ladies</HI>; 'tis not now above eight Years since first it hap'ned to a fond <HI>Mahometan,</HI> who all pos∣sess'd with <HI>Europaean</HI> Dreams of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Beauty,</HI> wou'd neither <HI>marry</HI> Wife, nor take a <HI>Concubine,</HI> that was not Mistress of a tender Nature, and as he thought accomplish'd sweetly in those bright Perfections, which in spite of Fate, must make him happy; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The folly of our inconside∣rate love of Beauty.</NOTE>but oh! how vainly does deluded Man de∣pend on <HI>Beauty</HI> as a means of Bliss, when every frail Misfortune of defici∣ent Nature robs him of his Hope; it is a Blessing ever subject to a thou∣sand <HI>accidental</HI> shocks of Ruin, and even in its longest, and <HI>uninterrupted</HI> course of Sun-shine, but the transient Shadow of a <HI>momentary</HI> Satisfaction, excellently defin'd by <HI>Seneca</HI> in his Tragedy of <HI>Hippolytus.</HI>

<P>HOWEVER, whether <HI>Nature</HI> had not qualified him for the <HI>Womens Favourite,</HI> or whether <HI>every Lady</HI> thought her turn too long in coming, is not known, but this is certain, that the whole Society of Beauties, were ex∣treamly Melancholy, and wou'd pensively retire to a large Window, which look'd out upon a <HI>Garden</HI> on the backside of their Apartment, and by throwing up the <HI>Lettice,</HI> let in <HI>Air,</HI> which <HI>fan'd</HI> not <HI>cool'd</HI> the warmth of their Desires; their <HI>Lord</HI> it seems, was very covetous, and finding <HI>Eunuch's</HI> somewhat chargeable, maintain'd but one, and that an <HI>old</HI> and <HI>lazy</HI> Fellow, who wou'd always go to Bed before his <HI>Ladies,</HI> and by that means give them favourable Opportunities to open the above-nam'd Win∣dow and look out upon the <HI>Garden,</HI> or divert themselves with any Enter∣tainment they thought fit to pass the Night in.</P>
<P>'TWAS late <HI>one Evening</HI> and the Family secure in their repose, when a brisk <HI>English Sailor,</HI> who had lost his Company, in coming, <HI>not an Hour before,</HI> from drinking at a little <HI>Hovel,</HI> where a <HI>Greek</HI> sold Wine, had rambled up and down from Street to Street, till he arriv'd in a small narrow Lane, one Wall whereof belong'd to the above-nam'd Garden; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A lucky Curiosity.</NOTE>he was walking hastily along, not knowing whereabouts he was, when he was startled at the sudden noise of Womens Voices, and desirous to behold what sort of Creatures <HI>Females</HI> were in <HI>Turkey,</HI> he was led by <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Curiosity together,</HI> to ascend a sort of Wooden Scaffold, which he found there rais'd against the Wall, and had been built in order to repair some Breaches made by Time.</P>
<P>THE Art of his Profession had instructed him to climb, by which means he with ease got up so high, that hanging by his Hands and Feet, he overlook'd the ridge of the Wall, and cou'd perceive distinctly, by the favour of the <HI>Moon-shine,</HI> several Ladies almost in their Shifts, and sporting wantonly together in a Window, on the other side the Garden; he was wonderfully pleas'd to see a sight, he had been long a Stranger to, and not being able to express himself in <HI>Turkish,</HI> was resolv'd to show his Breeding in the <HI>English Language,</HI> and call'd out aloud, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A comical Salutation.</NOTE><HI>Ha! my dear Rogues, have I caught ye faith? Egad I wish I was among ye.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING cou'd have been a greater surprize to the discover'd <HI>Ladies,</HI> than to hear a <HI>Voice,</HI> at once appearing to be <HI>a Man</HI>'s, and <HI>Stranger</HI> to their <HI>Language</HI> or <HI>Acquaintance,</HI> but 'twas encreas'd <HI>if possible,</HI> when they beheld a <HI>Head, Chin high,</HI> looking o'er the Wall with <HI>short thick Hair,</HI> and <HI>Hat</HI> of <HI>English</HI> Fashion; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Surprize soon over.</NOTE>the fright at first oblig'd 'em to a <HI>Shriek,</HI> and drove 'em from the Window for about five Minutes, but perceiving none had overheard them in the House, they gather'd Courage and return'd again, believing <HI>Providence</HI> had sent a <HI>Man</HI> to gratifie their Wishes.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sailor</HI> had by this time got astride upon the Wall, and was be∣ginning an <HI>old Ballad</HI> in that merry Posture, not remembring he had chang'd

his <HI>Wapping Residence,</HI> for a short continuance in a <HI>Turkish City</HI>: But the <HI>Ladies</HI> gather'd in a <HI>knot</HI> about the <HI>Window,</HI> and by the <HI>cautionary Motions</HI> of their Fingers, hush'd him into silence, and began to beckon him with smi∣ling Looks and all the tempting Invitations of an <HI>amorous Deportment.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A very kind, familiar Invi∣tation.</NOTE>ENCOURAG'D by their unexpected, <HI>kind Behaviour,</HI> the adven∣t'rous <HI>Tarr</HI> forsook his Station, and leaping from the <HI>Wall</HI> into the <HI>Garden,</HI> express'd his Satisfaction in their beautifull Appearances, by all the <HI>aukward</HI> Bows, and <HI>apish Cringes</HI> his Marine Accomplishments had made him Ma∣ster of. He came at last, and stood directly under them, explaining by the Motions of his <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Eyes,</HI> and other Signs, that he was sorry such an inaccessible Heighth prevented him from reaching them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An obliging Condescenti∣on.</NOTE>THEY talk'd a while by <HI>Signs</HI> and <HI>Motions,</HI> but perceiving they cou'd reap but little Pleasure from so remote a Conversation, the obliging <HI>Ladies,</HI> loth to lose so rare an Opportunity, began to make <HI>successfull</HI> use of those <HI>inventive</HI> Faculties, which <HI>Nature</HI> constantly bestows on Woman, in her amorous Exigencies; and while certain of the Company continued at the Window, smiling in a sort of wanton Dalliance, with the <HI>raptur'd Sailor,</HI> others ran and tied as many of their Sheets together as wou'd reach the Ground, which having done, they came again, and making fast the <HI>hither end</HI> to certain <HI>Hooks within the Chamber,</HI> threw the other down to him, and kindly beck'ned him to make a proper use of their inviting Fa∣vours.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A bold Ad∣venture.</NOTE>HE was not <HI>backward</HI> in performing their desires, but <HI>never thinking of the Consequences which might happen,</HI> made a shift to reach the Window by the help of their Contrivance; they receiv'd him joyfully, and had begun to stare upon the strangeness of his Habit, when he interrupted them by roughly kissing all the Company, imagining, that since he always us'd his <HI>English Mistresses</HI> in that familiar manner, it was the Fashion so to do in every <HI>Foreign Place</HI> he came to.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Turkish Husbands</HI> never kiss their <HI>Women</HI> but in <HI>Bed,</HI> and conse∣quently this Behaviour of our merry <HI>Britain</HI> wonderfully diverted them, they laugh'd exceedingly and gather'd round him; every one ask'd some particular Question, but he cou'd not understand one Word they said, and finding more than he expected in the Chamber, look'd about him with a <HI>great amazement,</HI> but began at last, to catch them in his Arms, embracing them by turns, with so much <HI>zeal</HI> and <HI>rapture,</HI> that 'twas hard to tell which Party knew most pleasure; <HI>he</HI> in meeting such <HI>engaging, beautifull,</HI> and <HI>willing Creatures,</HI> or the <HI>Ladies</HI> in their accidental Satisfaction of admit∣ting to their Arms, a <HI>Lover</HI> of so brisk and airy a <HI>Deportment,</HI> and a Man so full of <HI>Mirth</HI> and <HI>Ʋigour.</HI></P>

<P>THIS then <HI>at last</HI> they all agreed to, and with <HI>Scissars</HI> cut a Crimson <HI>Ribband</HI> into <HI>five and twenty Pieces,</HI> each a little longer than the former; these they made the <HI>Sailor</HI> hold, and drew their <HI>Lots</HI> in order; she, who had the <HI>longest</HI> was that <HI>very Night</HI> to have him for her <HI>Bedfellow,</HI> and so <HI>proportionably</HI> she, who had unfortunately drawn the <HI>shortest Lot,</HI> was doom'd to be the <HI>farthest distant</HI> from his <HI>wish'd Embraces.</HI></P>

<P>I scarce believe our <HI>amorous Tarpawlin,</HI> when the cool reflection of his waking Senses, represented his condition, found himself so pleasant as the Night before; but he had gone too far to think of going back, till he had done the Duty they expected from him, and therefore <HI>wisely</HI> thought it best to seem transported with his <HI>present, past,</HI> and <HI>future Happiness.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Contri∣vance, which they made to hide him.</NOTE>In short they led him to a very high and spacious <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss,</HI> or rather <HI>Wardrobe,</HI> for it was the Place, wherein they us'd to hang their Cloaths; in this <HI>Repository,</HI> he was forc'd to <HI>stand</HI> or <HI>lie</HI> all Day, and had the Door <HI>by chance</HI> been op'ned, he had yet <HI>perhaps,</HI> continued undiscover'd, <HI>hid</HI> all over, by the Cloaths about him.</P>
<P>THE Master of the House wou'd often come, and pass some Hours every Day amongst his Women, so that all Day long the <HI>Sailor</HI> was con∣fin'd to keep his Station, yet wanted little else but Liberty, for he had <HI>Meat</HI> and <HI>Drink,</HI> far more than he requir'd, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their good na∣tur'd manner of getting him Provisions.</NOTE>which the <HI>good humour'd La∣dies,</HI> order'd to be set aside, pretending they wou'd eat it at another time, and taking some convenient Opportunity, when all was safe, they carry'd it directly to their <HI>pounded Amoroso.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Customs, and Ceremonies in Conversation.</HEAD>
<P>IN describing the general Customs of the <HI>Turkish Conversation,</HI> 'twill be the plainest Method to begin with their <HI>Morning Exercises,</HI> and trace them through the various Entertainments of a <HI>busy Day</HI>; for when you know what manner of Living is practis'd by the <HI>richest</HI> and <HI>most active</HI> of their People, you may easily guess at the less <HI>stately</HI> or <HI>stirring</HI> Life of the remainder.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Em∣ployment, whereto Great Men in <HI>Turkey</HI> put the Day.</NOTE>EACH then obeys <HI>for the most part,</HI> the Summons of the <HI>earliest Cock,</HI> and rising from his <HI>Mattress,</HI> for <HI>Feather-Beds</HI> are never us'd in <HI>Turkey,</HI> his <HI>Slaves</HI> attend in an obsequious Reverence to wait his Motions to the <HI>Bag∣nio,</HI> which <HI>Great Men</HI> constantly build in their Houses, <HI>others</HI> must be contented with the Publick ones: <HI>Here,</HI> when throughly cleans'd, they rub him with Napkins till he is dry, and then attend him silently to that part of his House he pleases to be dress'd in; every Servant knows his Office, one puts on his <HI>Shirt,</HI> another his <HI>Wastcoat,</HI> the third his <HI>Vest,</HI> and another his <HI>Turbant,</HI> till he is at last compleatly ready.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Diver∣sions when at Home.</NOTE>IF he intends a <HI>Visit,</HI> he commands his Attendants to put themselves in order, and in the mean time sits <HI>cross leg'd</HI> on a <HI>Cushion</HI> in the corner of some <HI>Saffrai, looking into his Gardens, smoaking Tobacco, drinking Coffee,</HI> or perhaps <HI>playing at Chess</HI> with some <HI>Favorite Eunuch,</HI> which are the only <HI>Do∣mestick Diversions</HI> in use amongst them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of making Visits.</NOTE>WHEN his <HI>Horse</HI> is ready, for they seldom visit <HI>on foot,</HI> he comes gravely down to the Gate of his House, thro' a double Row of his Atten∣dants,
<PB N="117" REF="159"/>
who laying their Hands on their Bosoms bow slowly to the Ground, and kiss the corners of his <HI>Vest,</HI> which is the common Salutation of the <HI>Turks</HI> to their <HI>Superiors</HI>; his Horse is cover'd with a stately <HI>Caparison</HI> of <HI>Cloath of Gold</HI> or <HI>Silver,</HI> sometimes adorn'd with <HI>Jewels,</HI> which reaches from under the Saddle to his Heels; his Stirrops are of <HI>Silver,</HI> and so large as to contain his whole Foot; they are held, <HI>while he mounts,</HI> by <HI>two</HI> of his Servants, and when he moves, he is follow'd by a great number of them on Foot, walking <HI>two by two</HI> at equal distance; <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they re∣ceive each o∣ther at their Houses.</NOTE>in this order he proceeds to the House of him he would visit (having before given him notice) where alighting at the bottom of the Stairs, he is conducted <HI>thro' double rows of Servants</HI> to the Presence of their <HI>Master,</HI> who meets him <HI>nearer to,</HI> or <HI>farther from</HI> his Room of State, according to the difference of their Quality, tho' to <HI>Christians</HI> they never stirr out of their Places, but receive them sitting; after the <HI>mutual Compliments</HI> of somewhat declining their Bodies with their Hand on their Bosom, they proceed thro' several Rooms to that, they are to sit in; the <HI>Stranger,</HI> as they walk, always taking <HI>the left Hand,</HI> preferr'd as the noblest Place in Conversation, because, whoever has it, is suppos'd to be Master of the others Seymetar, as <HI>I think</HI> I have in the foregoing part inform'd my Reader. When they are entred, they advance to that elevated part of the Floor, call'd the <HI>Saffrai,</HI> and place themselves <HI>cross-leg'd</HI> opposite to each other on Cushions richly cover'd, with their Hands upon their Laps <HI>like our Women.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they are Enter∣tain'd in Visits.</NOTE>NOW begins <HI>Discourse,</HI> which is hardly enter'd on, when several <HI>Pages</HI> richly dress'd bring in a Silk or Muslin Handkerchief finely embroi∣der'd, and spread it on the <HI>Strangers</HI> Lap; then comes another with a <HI>Sal∣ver,</HI> containing several sorts of Sweet-Meats in little Spoons, like those we use for <HI>Tea,</HI> some of these he eats, and is immediately attended by a third with a <HI>Dish of Coffee</HI>; that drank, the Handkerchief is taken away, and they withdraw; but the <HI>Visiter</HI> has hardly renew'd his Discourse, when they return again with another Handkerchief, which being spread <HI>as before, one</HI> sprinkles Sweet-Water in his Face from a Silver Bottle, and <HI>another</HI> smoak∣ing his <HI>Beard</HI> and the inside of his <HI>Vest</HI> with burnt Perfume from a golden Incense-Pan, they withdraw again; these two Ceremonies are usually per∣form'd at the <HI>Page's Discretion</HI> as to the time between them; but there re∣mains a <HI>third,</HI> which they must wait their <HI>Master</HI>'s call for, and that is the bringing in a large Dish of <HI>Sherbet</HI> of an excellent Flavour, which as soon as the <HI>Stranger</HI> has drank, he takes leave and goes away; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A very odd Custom.</NOTE>for 'tis their Custom never to call for that Liquor, till they grow weary of their <HI>Visiter's Company.</HI></P>
<P>THEY seldom eat above one <HI>Meal</HI> a Day, and <HI>that</HI> a <HI>Dinner</HI>; they are rarely known to be <HI>luxurious</HI> in their Appetite, and <HI>are yet extreamly covetous</HI> of heaping <HI>vast</HI> and <HI>numerous Sums</HI> of Money from the <HI>Offices</HI> they hold; unskill'd in that incomparable Doctrine of <HI>Horace</HI> in the twelfth Epi∣stle of his first Book.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turkish</HI> Diet.</NOTE>THEIR <HI>Diet</HI> is but course, and rarely varied, consisting generally of <HI>boil'd Hens,</HI> or <HI>Mutton,</HI> and a sort of <HI>butter'd Rice,</HI> of late much us'd in <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> where 'tis call'd according to the <HI>Turkish Name Pilowe</HI>; their <HI>Butter</HI> is not made like ours, but <HI>on the contrary,</HI> is nothing else but <HI>Sheeps Tail Fat</HI> once melted down, and so preserv'd in certain Skins for common Uses.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheep with Tails so large, that they are forc'd to draw them after 'em on Carriages.</NOTE>AND since I mention <HI>Turkish Sheep,</HI> it will not be digressive from the Subject I'm upon, to tell you that there are in many Provinces of <HI>Persia,</HI> and the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Country, <HI>Sheep,</HI> whose Tails are so prodigiously encumbred with an incredible load of <HI>Fat,</HI> that <HI>twenty, thirty,</HI> often <HI>forty English Pounds</HI> of Grease, are taken from the Tail of <HI>one sole Sheep</HI>; nay to such a <HI>bulk</HI> and <HI>weight</HI> they sometimes grow, that 'tis a very common <HI>Scene</HI> in many Parts of <HI>Turkey,</HI> to behold 'em dragging after them their <HI>pond'rous Rumps,</HI> on <HI>two-wheel'd Carriages,</HI> contriv'd on purpose.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turkish</HI> Pies.</NOTE>ANOTHER sort of Diet us'd among the <HI>Turks</HI> are certain <HI>Pies,</HI> in∣differently bak'd, and fill'd with Meats of various kinds, but so excessively, and <HI>past all relish</HI> mix'd with <HI>Garlick,</HI> that the strongest <HI>Appetite</HI> of <HI>France it self,</HI> cou'd scarce digest them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of dressing Roast-Meat.</NOTE>THEY seldom roast, and when they do, observe a very different manner from the <HI>Europaean</HI> Practice; all their <HI>Fires</HI> are made in <HI>holes</HI> cut <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> Foot deep in Earth, about the several Parts of all their Kitchins; an <HI>Iron Engine,</HI> shap'd not much unlike a <HI>Gibbet,</HI> holds a String, which, fast'ned to some part of any thing they roast, turns gradually round, and so prepares it for their easy Palates.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A very savory sort of Dish, in use among the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE>ONE Dish they have in frequent use, <HI>of relish not unsavory,</HI> which may be nam'd a sort of <HI>forc'd Meat</HI>; it consists of many kinds of <HI>Flesh,</HI> all minc'd and chop'd together, with the <HI>rind of Limons, Nutmegs, Pepper, Cloves,</HI> and <HI>Cinnamon,</HI> all this they roll when season'd, into <HI>Balls</HI> of reasonable sizes, wrapping them about with doubled <HI>Bay-leaves,</HI> newly gather'd, and pro∣ceeding so to roast 'em with a gentle Fire: This <HI>I think</HI> they call <HI>Kabobb,</HI> and is <HI>if my skill'd Country Cooks will take my Word,</HI> a sort of palatable Prepara∣tion worth the imitating.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their way of making Bread.</NOTE>AS for <HI>Bread</HI> they use no other than a sort of <HI>flat</HI> and <HI>dough-back'd</HI> Cake they call <HI>Ecmeck</HI>; they make it of a course, and ill-ground <HI>Flour,</HI> rend'red moist by <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Water</HI>; after it is kneaded they proceed to press it out with heavy <HI>rolling Pins,</HI> and cutting Cakes in Trencher form, lay many on an <HI>heated Hearth</HI> by one another, throwing over them the <HI>hot</HI> and <HI>burning Ashes,</HI> till they judge 'em bak'd sufficiently, by which means they are very harsh and grating in the Teeth, as if some <HI>Sand</HI> had fallen up∣on them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Eating.</NOTE>WHEN they eat, they use no <HI>Plates, Knives, Forks,</HI> or any thing but <HI>Wooden Spoons,</HI> not much unlike the fashion of our <HI>Ladles,</HI> these Cakes of Bread supply the place of Plates or Trenchers; upon them they lay their Meat, so throughly <HI>boil'd</HI> or <HI>roasted,</HI> that they tear with ease, what part they chuse, by the assistance of their Fingers, eating last of all the Plates themselves, as did <HI>Aeneas</HI> and his newly landed <HI>Trojans,</HI> thus describ'd by <HI>Virgil</HI> in his seventh <HI>Aeneid.</HI>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Po∣stures when they eat.</NOTE>THEY sit at Meals <HI>cross-legd,</HI> about a <HI>Table</HI> scarce so much as half Foot high, made hollow, and the inside plated o'er with <HI>Tin</HI> or <HI>Silver</HI>; in their Laps there lies a long course <HI>Towel,</HI> very narrow, reaching round the whole Table, whose uncover'd Surface contains their several Dishes, still remov'd as soon as tasted, to make room for others, only diff'ring in the Colour of the <HI>Soop</HI> wherein their Meat is brought before 'em.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Drink they use at Meals.</NOTE>AS for Drink, they rarely use at Dinner any other than the Fountain Water, commonly at hand in all their <HI>Dining Rooms,</HI> and taken up in <HI>Sil∣ver, Gold,</HI> or <HI>Earthen Cups</HI> that moment it is call'd for, by the <HI>Servants</HI> who attend them. It is seldom known that all the Family sit down together to their Meat, one <HI>Smoaks,</HI> another <HI>Sings,</HI> a third perhaps is playing on his <HI>Fiddle,</HI> one is <HI>Eating,</HI> and a fifth employ'd at <HI>Chess,</HI> with some Companion of no greater Stomach than him self; but that their ways of <HI>Eating,</HI> and their <HI>Postures</HI> when about it, may be understood more fully, I have here annex'd a <HI>Cut,</HI> wherein the Reader may behold 'em plainly repre∣sented.</P>
<P>THEY commonly delight in sprightly Exercises after Dinner, as be∣lieving 'em <HI>conducive</HI> to their <HI>Healths</HI> and <HI>Reputation</HI>; many Sports they use, all which I shall describe in proper order, and will <HI>first</HI> proceed to treat about their Hurling the <HI>Geritt,</HI> the <HI>favourite Exercise</HI> of all these Peo∣ple.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hurling the Dart, a com∣mon Exercise in <HI>Turkey.</HI></NOTE>THIS Manly Sport is not unlike, <HI>perhaps the same,</HI> with that <HI>ancient Roman</HI> Custom of <HI>darting Javelins</HI> from their Hands, the <HI>Vigour</HI> wherewith they threw them, and the <HI>Execution</HI> they perform'd when thrown, may be conceiv'd by the Description of the Death of <HI>Turnus</HI> in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s last <HI>Aeneid.</HI>

<L>Bearing <HI>grim Death</HI> with <HI>hissing</HI> force along,</L>
<L>Till thro' the edge of his broad sev'n-fold Shield,</L>
<L>It pierc'd his <HI>Coat of Mail</HI> unus'd to yield,</L>
<L>Transfix'd his Thigh with a surprizing Wound,</L>
<L>And nail'd, <HI>with folded Knee,</HI> great <HI>Turnus</HI> to the Ground.</L></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> how skill'd therein.</NOTE>NOR is the <HI>Turkish</HI> Skill inferior to the <HI>Roman</HI> in this celebrated Exer∣cise, which is so common, and <HI>thereby</HI> so exquisitely known, that some are found among them, <HI>who with one strong throw</HI> at fifty five Yards distance, will with <HI>blunt, unheaded Wooden Javelins,</HI> break a Door of near <HI>Inch thick∣ness</HI> into twenty Pieces.</P>
<P>NAY to such Perfection are the <HI>Turks</HI> arriv'd in this encourag'd Pra∣ctice, that they never miss the smallest Mark they aim at; using the Diver∣sion both on <HI>Horseback</HI> and on <HI>Foot,</HI> and catching with their Hands the Wea∣pons of their Enemies, in certain <HI>Skirmishes</HI> by way of <HI>Single Combat,</HI> or a Party of an <HI>Hundred, Twenty, Ten,</HI> or <HI>more</HI> or <HI>less,</HI> against an equal Num∣ber. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beauty of their grace∣full Forms of Exercising it.</NOTE>'Tis a curious sight and worthy observation to behold their admira∣ble <HI>Horsemanship,</HI> and dext'rous Management of these <HI>Gerits,</HI> at certain publick and appointed Trials, by the way of <HI>Challenge,</HI> where an <HI>emulative fire</HI> inspiring either side with hopes of Conquest, leads 'em on, to act as cautiously as if in earnest. 'Tis amazingly agreable to see these Men, a∣midst an hissing multitude of Darts, which fly continually from side to side, behave themselves with <HI>free</HI> and <HI>unaffected</HI> Carelessness, with ease defend∣ing every Part, and <HI>turning, prancing, rearing,</HI> and <HI>curvetting</HI> on their Warlike Horses, as if they were not two <HI>distinct</HI> and separated Bodies.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Story how a Gentleman was circum∣cis'd for pis∣sing against a <HI>Turkish Mosque.</HI></NOTE>I very well remember that I landed once at <HI>Candy,</HI> with about four more, all <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and Strangers to the Customs of the Country; we were busy in observing <HI>as we walk'd along,</HI> the Buildings of the City, and afforded as <HI>surprizing Objects</HI> as we look'd upon, by being dress'd in <HI>English Habits</HI>; till <HI>at last,</HI> an inconsiderate and unluckly Member of our Company, who found himself inclin'd to <HI>Ʋrinate,</HI> turn'd round with far more <HI>Confi∣dence</HI> than <HI>Wit</HI> to do it, just against the Corner of a <HI>Turkish Mosque.</HI></P>
<P>THE People with a sudden hollow flew about us, and began to use us somewhat roughly, but a mild Deportment, and submissive Carriage, sav'd all harmless but the <HI>frighted Criminal</HI>; he <HI>poor Man</HI> was doom'd to suf∣fer; certain insolent and <HI>unrestrain'd Levants,</HI> the Sailors of the Country, came about him with their <HI>Knives</HI> all drawn, and having a long time beaten him about the Head, oblig'd him to lie down upon his Back, and <HI>never waiting for the usual Ceremonies,</HI> Circumcis'd the <HI>strugling</HI> and complaining <HI>Gentleman</HI> with Butcher-like Incision.</P>
<P>THEY said abundance, but to little purpose, for we understood not then <HI>one Syllable of Turkish,</HI> yet suppos'd they were upbraiding the Offender, and advising him to err no more, lest he shou'd meet a <HI>second sort of Circum∣cision,</HI> far more <HI>fatal</HI> than the former; and indeed the suffering Person was beyond expression overjoy'd to find his Loss not half so great as he at first expected it. <HI>Complaints are vain, where Remedies are never found</HI>; so we were glad to march contentedly away, resolving for the future to avoid the dan∣ger, which our <HI>Friend</HI> had met with.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A comical Humour of the Gentle∣man, in rela∣tion to his Mistress.</NOTE>SHAME and regret so much confounded him, that he endeavour'd <HI>once</HI> or <HI>twice</HI> to drown himself, upon receiving a <HI>kind, amorous</HI> Letter from a <HI>Mistress</HI> he had left in <HI>England,</HI> and wou'd often swear he never wou'd re∣turn because of his Misfortune; but it <HI>seems,</HI> some merry <HI>Gentleman</HI> of his Acquaintance writ a Letter to the <HI>Lady,</HI> and inform'd her of his <HI>Resolution</HI> and the <HI>Accident,</HI> which caus'd it; and upon her writing to her <HI>Lover</HI> that she knew the Business and was glad it was no worse; the poor dispirited <HI>Gallant</HI> took Courage once again, and ventur'd to go back.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What the <HI>Turks</HI> hunt with Dogs.</NOTE>HUNTING is an Exercise in which the <HI>Turks</HI> take great delight, sometimes <HI>with Dogs</HI> and sometimes <HI>without</HI>: With <HI>Dogs</HI> but far inferior to our <HI>English Breed</HI> they course the <HI>Stagg, Fox, Hare,</HI> and other swift defense∣less Animals; but when they hunt the <HI>Lyon, Leopard, Tyger, Boar,</HI> or other Forest Beasts, they use the Dogs for nothing but to rouse the <HI>Game,</HI> and leave it to their Management.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Form they ride in.</NOTE>THE common form wherein they ride is that of an extended <HI>Crescent,</HI> or <HI>Half-Moon,</HI> whereby encompassing the corner of a Wood, they send in Dogs to rouse the Beasts about it, which the <HI>cautious Currs</HI> no sooner have perform'd, but they come barking back, and save themselves from dan∣ger by retiring underneath the Horses Heels: If 'tis a <HI>Lyon</HI> or a <HI>Tyger</HI> they disturb, those often have the Courage to run <HI>roaring</HI> forward and attack the Party.</P>
<P>WHEN the Beast is seen approaching, every Man prepares his <HI>Tar∣get</HI> for his own Defence, unknowing where he aims his Vengeance; while the furious Salvage makes directly at some singled Horseman, who oppo∣sing his sharp-pointed Shield, the leaping Beast is wounded deeply, and, while redoubling disappointed Efforts, clos'd upon by the surrounding Par∣ty, who discharge a shower of <HI>Javelins</HI> at his Body, till he falls and dies a∣midst a thousand Wounds.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Wild-Cats are hun∣ted.</NOTE>WILD-CATS, or Cats-of-<HI>Mountains</HI> there, afford an excellent Diver∣sion; they frequent the <HI>Woods,</HI> and leap about from <HI>Tree</HI> to <HI>Tree,</HI> insomuch that all, who hunt them, are oblig'd to wear a sort of Head-piece; for 'tis very common to behold 'em jump upon the Shoulders of their <HI>Hunters,</HI> and endeavour <HI>so</HI> to Wound them, till they are prevented by the <HI>Dart</HI> or <HI>Pistol-Shot</HI> of some behind them.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> all mourn in White.</NOTE>THEN come several Men, who bear along large <HI>Ensigns</HI> trailing far upon the Ground behind 'em; after them <HI>four, six,</HI> or <HI>Ten led Horses,</HI> at an equal distance, led by <HI>Grooms on foot,</HI> come slowly forward, cover'd <HI>to the Heels</HI> with fine <HI>white Cloth,</HI> (for that's the <HI>Turkish Mourning</HI>) treading with a <HI>grave</HI> and <HI>heavy step,</HI> as if they knew the Cause of their Appea∣rance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Bo∣dy lies upon the Bier.</NOTE>NOW comes the <HI>Body,</HI> carried on a <HI>Bier</HI> by four tall Men, half cover'd over with the <HI>Mourning Cloath,</HI> which falls about 'em from the <HI>Bier</HI> and hangs upon the Ground, the <HI>Corps</HI> is born <HI>head foremost</HI> through the City, wrap'd in <HI>Linen,</HI> with his Face uncover'd, and a <HI>Turbant</HI> at his Crown, whose <HI>shape</HI> or <HI>magnitude</HI> denotes his Quality; they never bury them in <HI>Coffins,</HI> so they lie all open to the publick View, bestrew'd with every <HI>Flower,</HI> which may happen <HI>then</HI> to flourish.</P>
<P>BEHIND the Corps immediately appear two venerable Priests, with <HI>Turbants</HI> of a <HI>large</HI> and <HI>stately size,</HI> who, <HI>all the way they go,</HI> with <HI>elevated Eyes,</HI> and <HI>Arms extended,</HI> sometimes striking furiously against their Breasts, call <HI>vehemently</HI> on the Name of <HI>God,</HI> pronouncing it a thousand times, with <HI>awfull Sound</HI> and melancholy Accent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Close of the Procession.</NOTE>IN the rear of the <HI>Procession</HI> walk his Friends, in gracefull Order <HI>two by two,</HI> with Handkerchiefs, to wipe away the <HI>Tears</HI> they shed for <HI>grief</HI> or <HI>fashion.</HI> Women go not to the <HI>Funerals</HI> of Men, nor Men to those of Wo∣men, unless it be a number for their <HI>Safety,</HI> and performance of the Cere∣monies requisite in <HI>Burials.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Church yards, how, and where plac'd.</NOTE>CHURCH-YARDS <HI>among the Turks</HI> are always plac'd without the <HI>Town,</HI> or in some <HI>wild</HI> and <HI>vacant</HI> Place within it; as for Ground they ne∣ver mind to chuse it <HI>level, Hills</HI> and <HI>Dales</HI> are all alike, and for the space of <HI>sometimes</HI> full three Miles about, you see a sort of <HI>Grove</HI> or <HI>Wood</HI> (if the Expression be allow'd) of lofty Stones, for at the <HI>head</HI> and <HI>foot</HI> of <HI>every Grave,</HI> is plac'd a Marble, of the shape and bigness of a <HI>common Man</HI>: The only way they have to signalize the Memory of Noblemen, <HI>I mean great Officers</HI> among them, is to carve the tops of both the Stones they fasten at his Grave, to represent a <HI>Turbant</HI> of a <HI>size</HI> or <HI>form,</HI> which speaks his Qua∣lity; they strow the Ground with <HI>odoriferous Flowers,</HI> and often plant such little <HI>Trees</HI> and <HI>Herbs</HI> as are for ever <HI>green</HI> and <HI>flourishing.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A charitable Custom of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Wo∣men.</NOTE>Three times a Week the Women meet in all their <HI>Coemitery</HI>'s, to condole the loss of <HI>dead Relations,</HI> with continued <HI>howlings</HI> for about two Hours, leaving, when they go away, <HI>on every Grave, Meat, Drink,</HI> and <HI>Money,</HI> as a charitable Offering to the numerous Poor, who afterwards come in, and taking what they find <HI>there left,</HI> do gratefully repeat a certain number of Petitions for <HI>the Soul of the Deceas'd,</HI> proportionable to the <HI>Alms</HI> bestow'd upon them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cere∣monies at the Grave,</NOTE>HITHER then they bring the Corps, and coming to the <HI>Grave,</HI> first lay it on the Earth and gather round it, every one repeating Prayers for his Delivery from the Punishment of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> for they hold (as I have said before) a middle State; this done, they bury him without a further Ceremony, and filling up the Grave with Earth, return again in order as they came.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A very strange Notion of an Examination in the Grave.</NOTE>NOW says the <HI>Turkish Doctrine,</HI> they no sooner leave the Body in the Ground, but up start two <HI>black, horrid Angels,</HI> with their Hands of <HI>Steel,</HI> and Heads of <HI>Fire</HI>; these immediately rejoin the <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Body,</HI> and by force oblige the frighted Wretch to <HI>sit upright,</HI> while they with great sharp Knives of fiery Substance, cut the Body widely open, and examine nicely

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Punish∣ments they fancy Ill-Men undergo.</NOTE>BUT if they find (as <HI>ten</HI> to <HI>one</HI> they do) that his <HI>ill Actions</HI> have sur∣pass'd his <HI>Good ones,</HI> one <HI>black Angel</HI> with an <HI>Hammer of a thousand Weight,</HI> with fury strikes him on the Head and beats him eighteen Fathoms under Ground; by which time <HI>being turn'd in passage like a Shuttlecock,</HI> the <HI>other Fiend</HI> receives him at the bottom with another Blow as fatal as the former, and thereby sends him swiftly up again, so continuing to knock him <HI>up and down,</HI> 'till <HI>Mahomet</HI> their Prince of Mercy, shall in gracious pity of his human Frailties, condescend to grant a short Reprieve, which being pass'd, the <HI>bloody Executioners</HI> strait fall to work again, as roughly as before; and this Opinion so prevails in their <HI>Imaginations,</HI> that they always, <HI>in their prayers for Friends deceas'd,</HI> implore the Mercy of <HI>Almighty God,</HI> to ease them from the Torture of the <HI>two black Angels.</HI> And it is for these two <HI>Fiend</HI>'s conveniency, that, <HI>as I said before,</HI> the <HI>Winding Sheet</HI> is left unty'd at top and bottom.</P>
<P>NINE Days <HI>successively</HI> the dead Man's Friends assemble <HI>at his Grave,</HI> and pray together for the Welfare of his Soul; that time of mourning over, they erect a <HI>Monument</HI> of little cost, (<HI>but not unless he was of a distin∣guish'd Quality</HI>) upon the flats whereof appear, engrav'd in <HI>Turkish Cha∣racters,</HI> the several <HI>Graces</HI> and <HI>accomplish'd Excellencies,</HI> which adorn'd his <HI>Person</HI> with peculiar Merit while he liv'd and flourish'd.</P>

<P>BUT the <HI>Royal Mosques,</HI> or such as have <HI>from Age to Age</HI> been founded by the mighty <HI>Turkish Emperors,</HI> deserve a more particular and full Descri∣ption, which take as follows; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> un∣skill'd in the ancient Or∣ders of Archi∣tecture.</NOTE>first observing that the <HI>Turks,</HI> unskill'd in an∣cient Orders of <HI>Iönick, Dorick,</HI> or <HI>Corinthian Buildings,</HI> practice methods independent on the Customs of our <HI>Europaean Architecture,</HI> and proceed by measures altogether <HI>new,</HI> and owing to the Product of their own <HI>In∣vention.</HI></P>

<P>THE Servants ran, and seiz'd the Nobleman, who stood confounded, like a speechless <HI>Statue,</HI> looking eagerly upon the Body of the <HI>murder'd Earl,</HI> nor aiming to defend himself from being taken: <NOTE PLACE="marg">A cruel Sen∣tence to di∣vide two Lovers.</NOTE>News was carried to the <HI>Emperor</HI> of every circumstance of the unlucky Action, who considering wisely all particulars, gave the Gentleman a present <HI>Pardon,</HI> but resolving to prevent them from conversing with each other ever after, order'd the young Lady, with two <HI>Aunts</HI> and all the Family, to be confin'd in the <HI>before-nam'd Tower,</HI> then call'd <HI>Stony Island,</HI> giving strict command to all, who guarded it, that they shou'd never suffer her to get away, nor give admission unto any Person, such excepted as were authoriz'd to claim it by his <HI>Royal Passport.</HI></P>
<P>A while the <HI>Lady</HI> mourn'd so deeply for her Father's Death; and the de∣sponding <HI>Lover</HI> for the Action he had done, that neither thought upon the hardship of their cruel separation; but when fleeting Time presented to their Minds the sharpness of their Fate in that severe Decree, they both for∣sook all hopes of Comfort; <HI>she, in Prison,</HI> grew quite weary of and hated Life, and <HI>he, at large,</HI> became abandon'd to encroaching Sorrows, <HI>melancholy, silent,</HI> and a Prisoner to his Grief, amidst the Tracts of <HI>disregarded Li∣berty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="191"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A melancholy way of Life.</NOTE>TWELVE tedious Months were now roll'd over, and the discon∣tented Lover still continued every Day to visit the remembred Scene of <HI>former Bliss,</HI> and <HI>present Misery</HI>; he wou'd often walk disconsolately up and down along the Bank of that delightfull River, which was us'd to mur∣mur out a melancholy harmony to sooth their Minds, oppress'd by fear of ill Success in their commenc'd Affection; and reflecting on the various Words and Actions, which had pass'd between them, wou'd <HI>now and then,</HI> let fall a mournfull Tear, to think on their Misfortunes.</P>
<P>AT last, despairing ever more to see his <HI>dear, contracted Mistress,</HI> he be∣gan to wish a <HI>period</HI> to his Life, which only serv'd to lengthen out his Mi∣sery, and as he walk'd <HI>one Day,</HI> perceiv'd a Rock, wherein he had heard talk of some dark Cave, so <HI>dismally forbidding,</HI> that no Man had ever yet been found, who durst attempt to enter it: Disdain of danger from a wea∣riness of living, urg'd him on to seek the Place with resolution to go in, re∣gardless of the Consequence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A bold and hazardous at∣tempt.</NOTE>HE found <HI>at last,</HI> the gloomy Entrance of the horrid Place, which o∣pen'd downwards with a very steep, and dangerous <HI>slope,</HI> and never wai∣ting for a second thought, went boldly in, and crept along the rugged sides; a narrow Channel from the neighb'ring River, running thro' a Pas∣sage 'twixt the Rocks, directly in the middle, for about an hundred Yards; he made a shift to crawl along with wond'rous difficulty, down a very deep and slippery Descent, but <HI>there</HI> perceiv'd the Water, which till then, had ran confin'd to proper bounds, encreas'd in breadth to such a vast de∣gree, that there was left no more dry Ground to stand upon; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange ex∣ample of the Power of De∣spair.</NOTE>however, as desiring Death, he was resolv'd to tempt it, and continued his advances thro' the Water, sometimes scarce above his <HI>Knees,</HI> then almost to his Neck, here running ten or twenty Yards indifferently smooth, then falling many Foot, and roaring round his head like some <HI>Egyptian Cataract</HI>; some∣times he fell, half drown'd with the impetuous fury of the Torrent, some∣times walk'd thro' the rushing Streams, which almost tripp'd him from his Feet, with their amazing swiftness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Curiosity.</NOTE>STILL he crept as near as possible to some one side, and held upon the edges of the <HI>Rocks</HI> he met with, till reflecting on the strangeness of the Place he walk'd in, and how much it was impossible to reascend those wat'ry Passages he had already pass'd, he was resolv'd to live as long as he was able, and observe by <HI>Touch</HI> and <HI>Ear,</HI> what further wonders the Descent might lead him to, for 'twas so void of the least <HI>glimpse</HI> of comfortable Light, that he had then no use of <HI>Eyes,</HI> for none cou'd pierce one Inch of the surrounding Darkness.</P>
<P>HE came <HI>at last</HI> so far, that he perceiv'd a sensible decrease in breadth, for he cou'd stretch his Arms with ease, and touch both sides; but <HI>on the contrary,</HI> the depth encreas'd exceedingly, and by the Waters doubled <HI>roaring,</HI> and beating back as from some Wall, he found the <HI>Cavity</HI> no fur∣ther capable of giving room to a continued Progress; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonderfull subterraneous Passage.</NOTE>yet considering there must be some passage of emission, and little caring whither it might lead, he dip'd his <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Body</HI> under Water, and with much ado, shot swiftly with the Eddy, thro' a very short and narrow Neck, and found himself im∣mediatly inlarg'd, but cover'd over with a flood of Waters, which he took to be the Sea, when finding Breath grow short upon him, he made use of strong and artfull Strokes, which he had learn'd by swiming while a Boy, by these means, thinking he shou'd soon be freed, and gain the Surface, or expire amidst the Waves, both which Events he form'd a swift <HI>Idea</HI> of, ex∣pecting <HI>either</HI> with a like indifference.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="192"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Escape.</NOTE>BUT he was much surpriz'd, when long before he guess'd it, he per∣ceiv'd his head above the Water, and as soon as he could see, beheld him∣self within a sort of <HI>Well</HI> or <HI>Cistern</HI> almost level with the brim: He swam a while about from side to side, at last observ'd a <HI>Channel,</HI> into which the Cistern disengag'd her rising Waters; there he soon got out, extreamly weak'ned by his <HI>subterraneous Journey,</HI> and the first <HI>fair Object</HI> he discover'd when he look'd about him, was his former Mistress walking in a Garden, with a very sorrowfull and pensive Countenance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The happy meeting of two real Lovers.</NOTE>THE unexpected shock was much alike to both the Lovers, but the <HI>Lady</HI> frighted at the odd appearance of a dropping Man, who look'd like some Inhabitant of an inferior World, began at first to <HI>shriek</HI> and <HI>fly,</HI> but when he faintly call'd her by her Name, she knew the Voice, mistook him for a <HI>Ghost,</HI> and fainted to the Earth, unable to support the weight of so surprizing a discovery.</P>
<P>BUT to conclude, the <HI>Guards</HI> came in upon the <HI>Ladies shrieking,</HI> and immediately laid hold on their advent'rous Visitor; but when the Emperor was told the Story, he commanded both the <HI>Lover</HI> and his <HI>Mistress</HI> to be brought before him, and considering the particulars of this amazing Acci∣dent, immediately revers'd his former Sentence, had them Married in his Royal Presence, grac'd them <HI>ever after</HI> with peculiar Favours, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Etymolo∣gy of the <HI>Maiden Tower.</HI></NOTE>and in me∣mory thereof, commanded that the Castle shou'd be call'd the <HI>MAIDEN TOWER,</HI> which <HI>commemorative</HI> Name it bears at present.</P>
<P>EXCUSE me, Reader, for the length of my digression, 'tis a Story con∣fidently told amongst the <HI>Turks,</HI> but <HI>Faith</HI> is every Man's undoubted Pro∣perty; believe it, or believe it not, I only <HI>quote,</HI> and not <HI>assert</HI> it, as I heard it told me for the strange Original of their <HI>old Castle's Etymo∣logy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. Of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Seraglio, and particularly the Apartment of his Women.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Introdu∣ction.</NOTE>I Told the Reader <HI>in the Preface of my Book,</HI> by what uncommon means I was so happy as to gain admission to a <HI>Palace,</HI> which for many Ages has been kept a secret to the searching Knowledge of our <HI>Europaean Travellers,</HI> and shall <HI>now</HI> proceed to entertain him with a wonderfull, but pleasant and sincere account of new Discoveries, which <HI>like the Golden Indian World,</HI> lay long unenter'd (as appearing barr'd against our View with unsurmountable Impediments,) but gain'd at last, will spread throughout our <HI>Western Regions,</HI> such surprizing Plenty of her valuable Product, as may more than recompence the patient stay of your expecting Curiosities.</P>
<P>I love not <HI>flattery</HI> from any hand, much less wou'd sooth my own Perfor∣mances, with elevated hopes of a success beyond their Merits; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Complaint against the malice of the fashionable Criticks.</NOTE>but of this the World will give me leave to be assur'd, that as I write the Beau∣ties of an <HI>earthly Paradise,</HI> and <HI>unimagin'd</HI> Scenes of <HI>amorous Royalty, till now</HI> unknown, not only to my <HI>Countrymen,</HI> but every part of distant <HI>Christen∣dom,</HI> I have at least deserv'd the thanks of an impartial Reader, and may be allow'd to blame the <HI>undistinguishing Ill-nature</HI> of such <HI>steely Criticks,</HI> as in∣stead of owning an agreeable surprize, in meeting Subjects <HI>new</HI> and <HI>enter∣taining,</HI> strive ungenerously to condemn a Labour meerly out of ignorance or <HI>incredulity,</HI> because they find it something odd, and full of Novelty.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, all that base <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> which meanly may endea∣vour to obscure the Worth of what I write, shall never boast that <HI>private fear</HI> of barking Malice cou'd prevent my Pen from boldly aiming at a <HI>pub∣lick Satisfaction:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Rea∣der may ex∣pect in this Chapter.</NOTE>I will not therefore only entertain the World with an <HI>agreable Amusement,</HI> but proceed by regular degrees to give the Reader an entire <HI>Idea</HI> of the fam'd <HI>Seraglio</HI> of the <HI>Turkish Sultan,</HI> not omitting any odd and pleasant Observation, but neglecting <HI>purposely</HI> the trifling repetitions of those things, <HI>preceding Authors</HI> were enabled to inform you of; and chiefly bending my design'd description, to those glittering Piles of stately Buil∣dings, <HI>Groves of Pine,</HI> and <HI>Bowers of Cypress, Paths of Love,</HI> and <HI>Labyrinths of Pleasure,</HI> which combine their Graces to adorn the Seat of <HI>one Great Lord,</HI> and render perfect the delightfull Mansions, where the amorous <HI>Sul∣tan</HI> toys away his Minutes in the wanton Raptures of his <HI>Ladies Con∣versation.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The lovely situation of the <HI>Grand Signiors</HI>'s <HI>Se∣raglio.</HI></NOTE>FIRST <HI>then,</HI> if ever <HI>Heaven</HI> decreed a part of this divided World shou'd shine conspicuously above the rest, and seem to beckon <HI>Ʋniversal Monarchy</HI> to fix its Throne on her delicious Surface, 'tis the very Ground, whereon now flourishes the glorious <HI>Palace</HI> of the proud <HI>Mahometan</HI>; for from that eminence of Ground, on which the <HI>Temple Sancta Sophia</HI> has its Situation, runs a narrow neck of Land, descending <HI>gradually,</HI> and on either side politely sloping downward, till it forms at last a charming Angle on the <HI>North-East</HI> Point of <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="196"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Form thereof.</NOTE>THE Form of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which is built hereon, appears a sort of <HI>long triangle,</HI> one whole side whereof is bounded by the neighb'ring Buil∣dings of the City, both the other shelving downwards to <HI>the Sea,</HI> which washes 'em, and with their utmost Angle pointing out <HI>amidst the Waves,</HI> directly opposite to the surprizing heighth, and rough appearances of cer∣tain wild and distant <HI>Asian Promontories; Thrace,</HI> with all the Beauties of her <HI>Europaean Landskips</HI> forms a <HI>prospect</HI> full of Pleasures on the other side; not one small <HI>Ship</HI> can anchor in the <HI>Haven,</HI> but must pass the Point of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> first, whose noble Situation leads the <HI>Eye</HI> to gaze <HI>astonish'd,</HI> at such strange variety, that all the ravish'd Sweets of <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> here seem join'd, as if they had agreed to mix their richest Excellencies, and com∣pleat a modern <HI>rival Paradise</HI> to that of <HI>Eden.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its strength and Circuit.</NOTE>IT is above <HI>three English Miles</HI> in measur'd Circuit, quite surrounded by a <HI>lofty Wall,</HI> defended strongly by a sort of <HI>Quey,</HI> of five yards breadth which runs all round it, where are planted numerous Pieces of prodigious <HI>Cannon,</HI> of an <HI>unexampled size</HI> and <HI>monstrous bore</HI>; One very deep and spaci∣ous <HI>Ditch</HI> encompasses the Wall, which is moreover strengthen'd by capa∣cious <HI>Ramparts,</HI> and a square <HI>Watch-Tower,</HI> at every hundred or two hun∣dred Paces end; in these stand <HI>Day and Night,</HI> selected numbers of the finest Soldiers in the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s <HI>Guard,</HI> who see that none presume to venture near the Walls of his <HI>forbidden Palace</HI>; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The beauty of its Prospect at a distance.</NOTE>all the inside is adorn'd with <HI>Spires</HI> and stately <HI>Balls,</HI> gilt round with <HI>Gold,</HI> and shining <HI>from afar</HI> with a ma∣jestic Lustre, which sublime appearance, gently <HI>soften'd</HI> by the mix'd disco∣very of extended <HI>Groves</HI> of lofty <HI>Cypress Trees,</HI> there planted in a sweet and natural Irregularity, and somewhat shadowing in many Places, the reful∣gent brightness of the <HI>Spires</HI> and <HI>Cupola</HI>'s, afford a Prospect to the distant view so full of Beauty, and unknown variety, that Words want Power to celebrate the Object; therefore see the <HI>Cut annex'd</HI> for further Satis∣faction.</P>
<P>BUT having given this short description of the <HI>Form, Extent,</HI> and <HI>Outward Beauties</HI> of the <HI>Sultan's Palace,</HI> I will <HI>now</HI> proceed to lead my Rea∣der with a gradual Curiosity, through every <HI>inmost</HI> Part of its discover'd Glories; yet as the unnumber'd differences, which alternately occur to claim our observation, may confound the Prospect, if I represent them jointly, 'twill be much the safest way to separate the Building into five De∣grees, and treat distinctly of them all, that so we may preserve an usefull <HI>regularity.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first great Court.</NOTE>FIRST <HI>then,</HI> I will describe the <HI>Outward Court,</HI> and all the <HI>Offices</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> of the <HI>Buildings,</HI> which surround and form it, into which all <HI>Travel∣lers,</HI> who please, have free access, and uncontroul'd admission.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Court.</NOTE>SECONDLY I will proceed to do the like, by a <HI>more spacious Square</HI> within the former, and compos'd of far more <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>lofty Architecture,</HI> in∣to which, as to the first, <HI>all Strangers</HI> are admitted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The third, where all <HI>Am∣bassadors</HI> re∣ceive their Au∣dience.</NOTE>THIRDLY I intend to open to your View another Court within them both, and far superior in its Order and Magnificence; for in the rich <HI>Apartments,</HI> which surround this Square, the haughty <HI>Sultans</HI> give their Audiences to every <HI>Minister of Foreign Nations,</HI> at their first arrival in the <HI>Turkish Court.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Royal Lodgings.</NOTE>NEXT I lose sight of former Writers, and visit with a Wonder equal to the Object, the prodigious Statelyness, and tow'ring Splendor of the <HI>ROYAL LODGINGS,</HI> so surprizingly transporting me with endless Scenes of <HI>artfull Pleasure, Pride</HI> and <HI>Grandeur,</HI> that for want of <HI>Models</HI> to express
<PB N="149" REF="197"/>
their form by, which is quite unknown, nay even <HI>undreamt of</HI> in the <HI>Chri∣stian World,</HI> I have been forc'd to draw in the course of this Chapter another <HI>Plan,</HI> of the amazing inside of that stupendious <HI>Fabrick,</HI> which will give the Eye a true <HI>Idea</HI> of its wonderfull Contrivances.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Discove∣ry of the Wo∣mens Lod∣gings, thought by most to be impossible.</NOTE>BUT now appears a <HI>SECRET</HI> worth the hearing, the Discovery where∣of I often (since 'twas made) stood by and heard the greatest <HI>Travellers</HI> of several Nations, join in one old <HI>fashionable Story,</HI> and affirm to be no less than a downright <HI>Impossibility:</HI> Yet I will not only trace the <HI>Sultan</HI> to his amorous Pastimes with the <HI>Virgins</HI> of his <HI>Pleasure,</HI> but admit the Reader to the close Apartments of the fair <HI>SERAGLIO LADIES,</HI> nay and into the retir'd Magnificence of their <HI>Bedchambers,</HI> but shew him all the various Scenes of Love and Courtship, which are practis'd daily by <HI>their Lord</HI> and <HI>them,</HI> even to the Consummation of their utmost Wishes; and if the <HI>British Ladies</HI> are desirous of a further Information, still advance a step or two beyond it.</P>
<P>AS I told you <HI>in my Preface,</HI> that the absence of the <HI>Sultan</HI> and his <HI>train of Ladies,</HI> then attending him at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> gave a liberty beyond the Wishes of our <HI>keenest Curiosity,</HI> as a Compliment bestow'd for Reasons there explain'd, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A double Cu∣riosity.</NOTE>so I was willing to improve the opportunity as for as possible, and while I pleas'd my <HI>Eyes</HI> with the delightfull Prospect of <HI>engaging Novel∣ties,</HI> I satisfied my <HI>Ear</HI> with list'ning eagerly to the accounts our <HI>Guides</HI> thought fit to give us, of the proper use of every Place, and entertaining Stories of the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s <HI>Customs.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the great Gate of the <HI>Seraglio.</HI></NOTE>FIRST then, The Great <HI>Seraglio</HI> opens to the <HI>Sea</HI> on either side, with several low and private Gates, but such as never are made use of but when the <HI>Emperor himself</HI> is pleas'd to order it; the only common Entrance faces the before-nam'd Temple, <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> and admits you through a vast and spacious <HI>Portal of white Marble, arch'd</HI> and strengthen'd in the an∣cient way of Building; round the edges of the <HI>Arch on either side</HI> appear, cut deeply in the Stone, (the hollow of the Letters, richly fill'd with lovely mixtures of <HI>Gold, Green, Red, Blue,</HI> and every <HI>other Colour,</HI>) some few <HI>Arabian Sentences,</HI> almost defac'd by <HI>mould'ring time,</HI> but such as <HI>Turkish Scholars</HI> told us signified as follows.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Chappel built by <HI>Con∣stantine the Great.</HI></NOTE>YOU are no sooner entred thro' this lofty Gate, than you perceive a <HI>Court,</HI> the Square whereof contains almost three hundred Yards, and is surrounded by a sort of <HI>Cloyster,</HI> which I will describe immediately.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pillars brought from <HI>Troy.</HI></NOTE>DIRECTLY from the Mosque abovenam'd runs an <HI>open Gallery,</HI> near thirty paces long, and thirteen broad, its Roof supported by great numbers of fine Marble Pillars, six whereof the <HI>Turks</HI> report to have been brought from <HI>Troy</HI> to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> when 'twas yet <HI>Byzantium</HI>; they are all of different colour each from other, one is <HI>blue,</HI> another <HI>green,</HI> and there∣fore held as sacred by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and every one so naturally bright, that they are falsly said by common Fame, to be <HI>transparent.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Curious Re∣liques of An∣tiquity.</NOTE>THE high rais'd <HI>Fret-work</HI> of the Floor, is wonderfully fine and stately, all compos'd <HI>Mosaicly</HI> of great and little Marble Squares, of all imaginable Colours, richly representing some <HI>Historical</HI> and <HI>Kingly</HI> Figures, which the superstitious <HI>Turks</HI> have now defac'd by picking out their Eyes, and quite deforming all their Heads; however the remaining beauty of this noble Gallery sufficiently demonstrates, that it was the Workmanship of <HI>Christian Architects,</HI> to grace some part of that illustrious Palace, while it flourish'd gloriously in the peacefull Residence of <HI>Graecian Emperors.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Trea∣sury.</NOTE>A very large and noble <HI>Portico,</HI> or large <HI>Piazza,</HI> terminates this <HI>Gallery,</HI> on either side extending to an equal distance, and compleatly forming a large <HI>Semicircle,</HI> at each end whereof there open two large Doors, each Door admits you to some one of four vast Chambers, which contain the <HI>Treasure</HI> of the <HI>Turkish Sultans.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY Chamber is alike for form and bigness, making four <HI>Half-Moons,</HI> or <HI>Semicircles,</HI> two on either side, at equal distance each from o∣ther, with their horns or points directly contrary to those of the <HI>Piazza</HI> just now mention'd, and betwixt one Building and another, all the spaces be∣ing planted with the finest <HI>Trees,</HI> and odoriferous <HI>Flowers</HI> in various artfull Figures, form a sort of charming Prospect, not to be imagin'd by the most capacious Apprehension.</P>
<P>SIX Seals on either Door, and three large Chains secure the Entrance, never open'd but upon express Command from the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to the <HI>Hasnadar Bashaw,</HI> or <HI>Lord High Treasurer</HI>; each Room is full of <HI>Cupboards, Coffers, Iron-Chests,</HI> and <HI>Shelves</HI> extreamly large, all fill'd with <HI>Riches</HI> of a different kind, and shining brightly with collected heaps of most inestimable <HI>Wealth,</HI> and <HI>curious Rarities,</HI> which have from time to time been freely <HI>given, bought,</HI> or <HI>taken</HI> from the distant Corners of the spacious Uni∣verse.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Royal Lodgings.</NOTE>DIRECTLY opposite to the <HI>Piazza,</HI> which contains the Doors, that open to this Treasure, stand the <HI>Royal Lodgings,</HI> which you enter by another great <HI>Piazza,</HI> not unlike the former, but with its Points so well

dispos'd, and so exactly opposite, that <HI>both Piazza</HI>'s make a Space of <HI>Circular design,</HI> and <HI>large extent,</HI> the midst whereof contains a <HI>Fountain,</HI> spouting from its sides large Streams of Water, which Descending in a Body on the <HI>Center</HI> of the <HI>Cistern,</HI> form a Figure Pleasantly un∣common.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Ancient Obelisks.</NOTE>AMIDST the space, between the <HI>Horns</HI> of the <HI>Piazza</HI>'s, stand two <HI>Obelisks</HI> of lofty Heighth, and wonderfull contrivance, but neglected by the <HI>Turks,</HI> no Lovers of the Venerable <HI>Reliques</HI> of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> are now o'ergrown with <HI>Bushes,</HI> and Surrounding Multitudes of <HI>Brambles.</HI></P>
<P>A Pavement leading to the midst of the <HI>Piazza</HI> brings you to the Entrance of the <HI>Royal Lodgings,</HI> which compleat another <HI>Semicircle,</HI> look∣ing out upon the inmost <HI>Gardens</HI> of the <HI>Great Seraglio,</HI> and together with the <HI>Gallery</HI> adjoining to it, looking like two C's affix'd together in the following manner, <FIGURE>

<P>ALL the space between these <HI>Wings,</HI> and the abovenam'd <HI>Treasury,</HI> is fill'd with Fountains, <HI>Cypress Trees,</HI> and curious Flower Gardens, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Melancholy Grotto's.</NOTE>and the Vacancy on either side, politely terminated by a <HI>Semicircular Grotto,</HI> Built of Shells, set here and there upon a rough hard substance, exactly repre∣senting <HI>Natural Rock,</HI> betwixt whose Hollows, artificial Groves of fine Im∣pending Coral seem to sprout, and thro' their dropping Branches <HI>Mur∣muringly</HI> discharge, small Streams of Water, gently Trickling down the Rock in many Places.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apartments of the Great <HI>Seraglio</HI> Offi∣cers.</NOTE>THE <HI>Left Wing</HI> is divided into many fine and large Apartments, where are Lodg'd the <HI>Selictar-Aga,</HI> or <HI>Royal Sword Bearer, Hichokadar-Bashaw,</HI> or <HI>Bearer of the Cloak,</HI> and many other of the Greatest Officers of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> such as always have Admission to the Presence of the <HI>Sultan.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Sultans Quarter</HI> Boasts no more than Three Great Rooms, but those so Splendid, and <HI>beyond Imagination</HI> Stately and convenient, that one, who never saw them, cannot comprehend the Twentieth Part of their Amazing Excellences.</P>

lie large Cushions, of a <HI>black, green, blue,</HI> or <HI>crimson Velvet,</HI> embroidred in the richest manner, with the finest Pearls, some <HI>long,</HI> some <HI>round,</HI> and some of every form and magnitude; in short, no part of all those Cham∣bers but possesses <HI>Ornaments,</HI> the most <HI>accomplish'd Grandeur</HI> of the stateliest Palaces of <HI>Europe</HI> cannot <HI>equalize.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonderfull River, flowing two ways.</NOTE>BEHIND the Royal Lodgings at about two hundred Paces distance runs a River, brought by Art from the adjoining Sea, thro' subterraneous Passages, to rise exactly in the middle of the highest Ground of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> where it forms a sort of Lake, and thro' an artificial Channel, runs along with mighty swiftness down the Hill on either side, quite cross the Palace, passing thro' the Garden Walls on either side, by a large Iron Grate, and so descending to the Sea two different ways, from which 'tis constantly sup∣ply'd, as fast as it emits the rising Waters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The impossi∣bility of ap∣proaching the Womens Quarter.</NOTE>IT is this River, that divides the <HI>Great Seraglio</HI> from the Quarters of the Ladies, hindring all Communication 'twixt the two Divisions, by the means of its impetuous Current, nor dares any Man, how bold soever, once presume to straggle from his Station, towards the <HI>Verge</HI> of this for∣bidden Ground, since cou'd he pass the numerous <HI>Guards</HI> of <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> which impede his Progress, tho' that <HI>barr</HI> alone is <HI>unsurmountable,</HI> he must un∣doubtedly be seen, by the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> or his <HI>Officers,</HI> and present <HI>Ruin</HI> follow his Discovery.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lovely Gar∣dens.</NOTE>FROM the Buildings, which contain the Lodgings of the <HI>Sultan,</HI> and the <HI>semicircular Wings</HI> thereto adjoining, runs a spacious and delightfull <HI>Flower-garden,</HI> curiously adorn'd with every kind of odoriferous Plant, and shady Tree, which can afford a Smell or Prospect any ways <HI>agreable</HI>; nu∣merous <HI>Fountains,</HI> each of different form, illustrate the Appearance, and the <HI>Gardens</HI> reaching from one Wall to the other, terminate their <HI>breadth</HI> upon the Bank of the abovenam'd River, all along whose edge there runs a row of Breast-high <HI>Iron Rails,</HI> as on the other side appears a line of gilded Banisters.</P>
<P>THERE runs a little Marble Pavement from the <HI>Sultan's Postern,</HI> through a very stately Wooden Arch, adorn'd with Trees and twining Jessamins, which twist about it in the middle of the Garden, not unlike the fam'd <HI>Triumphal Arches</HI> of the ancient <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Pavement is divided at about an hundred paces from the River, into two distinct and <HI>semicircular Galleries</HI> with Banisters on either side, a∣bout three Foot in heighth, adorn'd with <HI>Spires</HI> and <HI>Balls</HI> of <HI>Gold,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Draw-bridges, which lead you to the Ladies Apartment.</NOTE>which lead to two great <HI>Draw-bridges,</HI> each guarded by a Party of <HI>White Eunuchs</HI> on the hither side, and crossing the swift Current on each side of the be∣forenam'd <HI>Source</HI> of Waters, at the other Foot of either Bridge there waits a constant Guard of <HI>Black,</HI> or <HI>Negro Eunuchs,</HI> and two other <HI>Galleries,</HI> ex∣actly correspondent to the former, lead two ways to such another Pave∣ment, running also thro' an <HI>Arch</HI> adorn'd and built exactly like the other.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A winding Gallery.</NOTE>BUT to return again to what I was about, the Pavement on the other side the <HI>second Arch</HI> admits you to the entrance of a stately Gallery, perhaps the finest, that was ever heard of, for it reaches from one Garden Wall to the other, <HI>winding</HI> in and out exactly as we paint a folding Serpent, all the turnings at an equal distance from each other, and so often made, that those, who walk upon it lose the sight of one another every ten or fourteen Paces.</P>

<P>THE Reader <HI>I presume,</HI> will be inclin'd to think this Place, as I have now describ'd it so magnificent and beautifull, that it can scarce admit of an additional extravagance; he will be consequently much surpriz'd, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A lovely walking Place.</NOTE>when I inform him, that on either side within the Wall are very deep and artifi∣cial <HI>hollows,</HI> fill'd with <HI>Soil</HI> of a <HI>productive</HI> nature, where are planted <HI>Wood-bines,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Hony-suckles, Jessamins, low Flowers,</HI> and <HI>Tuberoses,</HI> which supported by a stronger and more spreading kind of lasting <HI>Greens,</HI> so sweetly intermix with one another, meeting at the top, and growing thick upon a frame of rich gilt <HI>Box Wood,</HI> that you walk as in a dream, thro' all the odoriferous extasies of <HI>Natures Blessings.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Of the Revenues of the <HI>Turkish Sultan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Reader must not here expect particular Accounts of those prodigious Sums of Money, wherewith the <HI>Emperors</HI> of <HI>Turkey</HI> still find means to fill their Coffers; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Private Trea∣sures, how a∣mass'd in <HI>Tur∣key.</HI></NOTE>I can only tell him, that besides the Publick <HI>Treasury</HI> I lately spoke of, there is kept in the <HI>Seraglio</HI> private <HI>Banks</HI> of Money in strong leather Baggs, the Sum, which each contains, inscrib'd upon a <HI>Label</HI> fast'ned to it; These have been amass'd by former <HI>Sultans,</HI> and are all distinguish'd from each other by the several Names of the collecting <HI>Monarchs</HI> deeply cut upon the Covers of large <HI>Iron Chests,</HI> which hold the leather Baggs abovenam'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To what Use reserv'd.</NOTE>THESE Private Treasures, tho' containing mighty Sums of Money, which instead of lying dead might be increas'd each Year by different Im∣provements, are esteem'd so Sacred by the superstitious <HI>Turks,</HI> that they believe it nothing less than hainous Guilt or <HI>Sacrilege</HI> it self, to make the smallest use thereof, till it may do their Country and Religion signal Ser∣vice at a time, if such a time ever happen, when the <HI>Christian Nations</HI> join against them and invade their Territories; a thing I fear, too much unlikely, but in which the <HI>Turks</HI> are apprehensive of a Universal Dan∣ger.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The yearly Revenue of the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI></NOTE>AS for the <HI>Revenues</HI> of the <HI>Turkish Sultan,</HI> such I mean as are his fix'd Propriety, and the undoubted Right of his <HI>Imperial Dignity,</HI> they are at present reckon'd at about <HI>eight Millions</HI> and <HI>three hundred thousand Pounds Sterling,</HI> yearly Income; a Sum becoming the Possession of a <HI>Prince</HI> so ab∣solute as the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of Collecting it.</NOTE>THE manner of Collecting this prodigious Sum, is by Assessing every Subject of his <HI>Empire,</HI> at an inconsiderable Yearly Tax, which he must pay as an Acknowledgment of his Dependance on, and Duty to the <HI>Sultan</HI>; and it is an admirable Method, they have got, of raising all this Money without any charge or trouble to the <HI>Emperor.</HI></P>
<P>THE Petty Governors of every little <HI>District,</HI> are oblig'd to gather the respective <HI>Quota</HI>'s of the <HI>Villagers</HI> about them, and set out with Guards suf∣ficient to defend the Money towards the next great <HI>Town</HI> to their dependant Residences; here they must deliver it to the Possession of the <HI>Aga,</HI> or the <HI>Governour</HI> of the Place, demanding his Discharge for their Acquittance of a Duty so incumbent on their Offices.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How carry'd to the Capi∣tal.</NOTE>THE <HI>Aga's</HI> adding to this Sum their own Collections, guard 'em in like manner to the <HI>Sangiacks,</HI> or the <HI>Lords Provincial</HI>; they, with the addi∣tion of their own deliver it to the Superior <HI>Beylerbeys,</HI> or Great <HI>Arch-Dukes</HI> of <HI>Turkey,</HI> and these last continue all in their Possession, till demanded by the <HI>Guards,</HI> who undertake to carry it in Waggons safely to <HI>Constan∣tinople.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="221"/>
THE Quarterly <HI>Collections</HI> never are behind hand, for on pain of Ruin no Man dares refuse immediate Payment on the Day appointed, so that <HI>ten Days</HI> after every <HI>Quarter,</HI> the <HI>remotest Provinces</HI> begin to send away their Money towards the <HI>City</HI> I so lately nam'd. In <HI>every Province,</HI> the <HI>Timari∣ots, Zaims,</HI> and other <HI>standing Soldiery,</HI> are summon'd to appear and form a general Muster; <NOTE PLACE="marg">How guarded on the Road.</NOTE>whence, with their <HI>Commanders</HI> at their <HI>Head,</HI> they all advance, and guard the Waggons to the Residence of the <HI>Sangiack</HI> of the adjoining Province.</P>
<P>HE with all his Soldiers, joining his additional Collections to the for∣mer, there receives the Custody of all together, and advances in like man∣ner till he reaches his next Neighbour, who relieves him with another Par∣ty; and in this settled Order they proceed, still swelling their Collections, till the last delivers all the <HI>Revenues</HI> of one Quarter, to the <HI>Lord High Trea∣surer</HI> at <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>IT is observable, that as the Provinces, which lie the nearest to their great <HI>Metropolis,</HI> must undertake the <HI>Convoy</HI> of far greater Sums than the <HI>remoter Places,</HI> so the number of their <HI>Soldiers</HI> is proportionably greater, as they are by far more populous, for reasons mention'd in the Chapter, treating of the <HI>Maxims</HI> of their <HI>Policy.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An admira∣ble Policy.</NOTE>NOW, tho' the <HI>Sultan's Treasure</HI> is thus brought him by the universal Labour of his Subjects; he is as I have said entirely free from any kind of Charge; this Duty being fix'd upon his <HI>Governors of Provinces,</HI> as one of those incumbent on their Places, and consequently to be manag'd only by those Officers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another way the Sultan has of raising Mo∣ney.</NOTE>BUT many are the means, whereby the <HI>Sultan</HI> daily adds prodigious Sums to his Revenues, such as, <HI>for Example,</HI> The obliging all the Great <HI>Bashaws</HI> and <HI>Governours</HI> of his Dominions every <HI>New-Years-Day</HI> to send him Presents, commonly in ready Money, which amounts to an incredible <HI>Amassment.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another, which he of∣ten uses.</NOTE>ANOTHER way he has, when his Occasions press him to Collect extraordinary Sums, by sending Orders to the <HI>Lords Provincial</HI> of his <HI>Em∣pire,</HI> immediately to raise as much as he requires, which they must do with∣out reply, by Means as absolute as the Command of their <HI>Great Master</HI>; oftentimes the <HI>Sultan</HI> takes occasion to demand such Sums from certain <HI>Provinces,</HI> as 'tis impossible they can supply him with; but sending in compliance with his Will as much as they can spare, excuse themselves, as <HI>incapacited for a further Contribution.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A barbarous Avarice.</NOTE>HERE the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> gains his end, and finds a thousand fair Pre∣tences for the Execution of the <HI>Governors</HI> of all such <HI>Provinces</HI>; he either sends 'em Word that they have quite Impoverish'd their Governments, by tyrannous Oppression of their <HI>People</HI> to enrich <HI>themselves,</HI> or that their Lives must pay the forfeit of their Disobedience, having fail'd to execute his Royal Orders, which obliges him to think them either <HI>Traitors</HI> to his <HI>Power,</HI> or unable to discharge the <HI>Trust</HI> he had conferr'd upon them.</P>
<P>EITHER of these Reasons or indeed a Weaker, <HI>often none at all,</HI> suf∣fice to ruin those, whose <HI>Riches</HI> speak 'em fit for Execution, which is done as I have said before, by <HI>Strangling,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Turks</HI> use Strangling.</NOTE>for it is esteem'd a Crime of an un∣pardonable nature, to spill the Blood of any <HI>Mussulman:</HI> The Treasure of such Governors is instantly declar'd Confiscated to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> and accordingly deliver'd into his capacious Coffers.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> ve∣ry Covetous.</NOTE>THUS does Possession of a splendid Wealth endanger those, who own it, yet it is observable that <HI>Turks</HI> of every Nation are the most inclin'd to aim at growing Rich, more zealously pursuing <HI>Gain,</HI> by how much faster it rolls in upon them; and this in every Age has been a Vice as <HI>epidemic</HI> as <HI>un∣reasonable.</HI> The <HI>Poor</HI> are commonly the most contented with their For∣tune, and <HI>Juvenal</HI> has left it as a Maxim, that,

The Vicissitudes of <HI>Fortune</HI> will a∣maze his Thoughts, when he Reflects Sedately on the Glorious State of <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Knowledge,</HI> in which they Flourish'd under the Instructive Discip∣line of their <HI>Jonick, Socratick, Cyrenaick, Platonick, Academick, Peripatetick, Stoick,</HI> and <HI>Pythagorean Philosophers,</HI> whose <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Vertuous</HI> Dictates in∣spir'd their Minds with an elevated Sense of <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI>; in the Practice of which, (as they exceeded and instructed most other Nations) they endeavour'd to out-vie each other: All contending with an <HI>Emu∣lative Zeal,</HI> for a wish'd Superiority of <HI>Speculative Learning,</HI> till, by the long continu'd Blessing of such Aspiring Inclinations, they raised the Fame of their Illustrious Governments above the rest of the Submissive World, and Built themselves a <HI>Glory,</HI> whose encreasing Brightness cou'd receive no Shadow from the affected Ignorance of contending Nations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Degene∣racy of the Moderns.</NOTE>BUT strangely different is the present Genius of that Metamorphos'd People, who have so Widely Deviated from the Footsteps of their An∣cestors, that, to describe them rightly, in their Modern State of <HI>Sla∣very,</HI> we must place 'em in a Diametrical Opposition to <HI>Honour, Worth</HI> and <HI>Industry.</HI> Their very <HI>Nature</HI> seems to have been chang'd with their <HI>Condition,</HI> as if their <HI>Principles</HI> had sunk with their <HI>Nobility,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomet's</HI> Massacre.</NOTE>whom <HI>Ma∣homet</HI> the Great (on his Taking <HI>Constantinople</HI>) endeavour'd to Extir∣pate by a general <HI>Massacre,</HI> imagining Politickly, that a Revolt of the Nation would be Dangerously, and Unsuccessfully attempted, when they should want a Head to guide the rough Resentments of an Undiscip∣lin'd Multitude. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Emperor Trodden to Death.</NOTE>Their last Emperour was Trodden to Death in one of the City Gates, and the greatest part of his Family most Barbarously Butch∣er'd by the Inhumane <HI>Conquerors.</HI> Those few, who with their Wives and Children escap'd the Tyrants Rage, retir'd to Woods, and Places far remote from the <HI>Imperial City</HI>; where in Disguises proper to con∣ceal their Quality, they wander'd up and down in all the Wants and Hardships of a Miserable <HI>Poverty,</HI> till, by the Course of Time, their mean Condition reduc'd the Nature of their untaught Posterity to so low an Ebb, that their so lofty Extract, (which some remaining Members of that Family now vainly boast of) serves but as an Arrow to Stab their Thoughts with the shamefull Idea of their present Miseries.

Practice of the most Mechanical Employments. I was never more sensibly Afflicted at the Misfortunes of another, than when I saw at <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> in the House of Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Merchant, now at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> one <HI>Constantine Paleologus,</HI> at that time a <HI>Groom</HI> of his Stables. <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Posterity reduc'd to ex∣tream Pover∣ty.</NOTE>This Man demonstrated by undeniable Proofs, that he was Lineally De∣scended from the Emperors of <HI>Greece</HI>; but was most sordidly Illiterate, and Inexpressibly Ignorant in any thing beyond the Dressing of his <HI>Horses</HI>; yet he had a peculiar Majesty in his Person, and somewhat uncommon distin∣guish'd his Extract from the Vulgar Dictates of his meaner Education; an Awful Gravity adorn'd his <HI>Countenance,</HI> and his silent Postures had somewhat Naturally Noble.

AFTER the Men, the Women come, in a <HI>Knott</HI> by themselves, and in the midst, the <HI>Bride,</HI> all cover'd with a <HI>Veil of Lawn</HI>; which reaches to her Heels, made like a Sack, without the smallest peeping Place for her imprison'd Eyes, ty'd pretty close about the Neck, and falling widely from the Head, o'er the sides of a <HI>square</HI> piece of <HI>Pastboard</HI> like a <HI>Trencher,</HI> over which is hung a <HI>Garland</HI> of the sweetest Flowers.</P>
<P>IN this Order they advance, guarded <HI>before</HI> and <HI>behind</HI> by <HI>Janizaries,</HI> for fear of <HI>Insults</HI> from the <HI>Turkish Rabble.</HI> At the <HI>Church,</HI> the <HI>Priest</HI> is sure to meet them, and ent'ring <HI>there,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A method to prevent En∣chantments.</NOTE>the <HI>Bridegroom</HI> leaves his <HI>Dagger</HI> sticking in the Door, for fear of <HI>Incantations</HI> or <HI>Enchantments,</HI> often practis'd in this Country, by which means, they pretend to render the most vigorous <HI>Bride∣groom</HI> altogether <HI>Impotent</HI> upon his <HI>Wedding Night.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, arm'd against so unlucky a Disappointment, they go <HI>into Church,</HI> and by the <HI>Priest</HI> are <HI>join'd,</HI> with several Prayers for the suc∣cessful Issue of their Marriage; after which, they change their <HI>Garlands,</HI> and retire to their Houses, where the remainder of the Day being spent in <HI>loud Carousing</HI> and making merry, the <HI>New-married Couple</HI> are put to Bed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A way to prove Virgi∣nity.</NOTE>and the next Morning <HI>early,</HI> the <HI>Mother,</HI> or nearest <HI>Female Relation</HI> of the <HI>Bride,</HI> coming into their Chamber, takes possession of the <HI>Wedding Sheets,</HI> to be preserv'd as a perpetual Proof of her Dear <HI>Daughter</HI>'s sure <HI>Virgi∣nity.</HI></P>
<P>I'LL tell you a pleasant Story, and leave your-self to guess, how ad∣mirably <HI>Nature</HI> has endued the <HI>nimble-minded Graecian Ladies,</HI> with the finest qualifications in the World, for <HI>Cuckolding</HI> their Husbands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A pleasant Story of a Graecian Lady.</NOTE>THERE is a little Village, call'd <HI>Belgrade,</HI> about fifteen Miles from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> wonderfully pleasant for its <HI>airy Situation</HI>; here a <HI>Greek,</HI> who was grown rich by <HI>Merchandizing,</HI> kept a very pretty <HI>Country House,</HI> and in it a young Wife, extreamly handsome, but, as somewhat brisker than he wish'd her, she alarm'd his Jealousy to watch her strictly, nor wou'd he often let her walk alone in the adjoining Groves and Meadows.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I was <HI>one Day</HI> going by a Wood-side, at the bottom of a <HI>Hill</HI> to Angle in a <HI>River,</HI> that ran by it, and perceiv'd upon the <HI>Bank</HI> a charming youthful Lady busy at her Needle, with a <HI>Pot of Water</HI> standing by her, I immediately imagin'd right, and guess'd her the <HI>fine Wife</HI> of the <HI>rich Greek</HI> abovenam'd; I must own I was surpriz'd to find her, so, beyond my expectation, gay and beautiful; I saw she was alone, and ventur'd to address her in <HI>Italian,</HI> she return'd my Salutation in that Language, and permitted me to sit down by her, and converse with all the Liberties of <HI>decent Familiarity.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Her familiar Temper.</NOTE>SHE presently began to make Complaint of the Restriction she was under, by her Husbands Jealousie, and the Restraint, which Women in that Country were oblig'd to undergoe, and really thence proceeded to make such kind advances, and so prettily encourage me to hope her fa∣vour, e'er I ask'd it, that I only wanted <HI>vanity,</HI> to think I might have met success in any kind of offer, <HI>Youth,</HI> or <HI>Inclination</HI> might have tempted me to make her.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonderful Presence of Mind.</NOTE>BUT on a sudden, in the Height of her Discourse and <HI>Gayety,</HI> we heard a Voice among the Trees upon the other side of the River, Im∣mediately she knew it was <HI>her Husband,</HI> and expecting every moment, when he wou'd appear in sight, was sure he must Discover me to have been talking with her, so the very minute, that he call'd her, she fell
<PB N="178" REF="230"/>
sideways on the Ground, extended both her Arms with natural negligence, let drop the <HI>Silk</HI> she was at Work upon, and seem'd as much Asleep, as if she really had been so.</P>
<P>TWAS no hard Task to guess the meaning of this <HI>Counterfeited Slum∣ber,</HI> so that, willing to prevent all cause of Jealousy, instead of striving to get out of Sight, I started up, and bending forward, look'd upon her Face, as if surpriz'd to find a <HI>Woman</HI> in that Place and Posture.</P>
<P>I had hardly time to regulate my <HI>Air of Wonder,</HI> when the <HI>Greek</HI> ap∣pear'd upon the Bank directly opposite; he <HI>Started,</HI> when he saw the Posture of his <HI>Wife,</HI> and me so near her. I pretended an <HI>Amazement</HI> equal to his own, at his appearance, and was just about to ask him, if he knew that <HI>Lady,</HI> when he Interrupted my design by <HI>Hallowing,</HI> as loud as he cou'd possibly, to wake his <HI>Consort.</HI></P>
<P>SHE, <HI>Poor Creature,</HI> was so fast asleep, that all his <HI>Noises</HI> were in vain, she Slumbred on, till I, as willing to give all the Countenance Imaginable to her <HI>Politic Contrivance,</HI> took her by the <HI>Arm</HI> and shook her pretty roughly; <NOTE PLACE="marg">An admirable Counterfeit.</NOTE>at this she Rous'd, and having rubb'd her Eyes with admirable Cunning, look'd about her, and was, <HI>doubtless,</HI> much surpriz'd to see me there, it having been so long, since we Discours'd together.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I was pleas'd to see, how excellently she contriv'd to humour wonder, mix'd with an <HI>alloy</HI> of Modesty, both which I fear, and ten to one, you'll think so by the Sequel, were alike Strangers to her <HI>Na∣ture</HI>; she started up upon her Feet, and fix'd her Eyes upon me with an Artful <HI>Wildness,</HI> running Backwards, as I offer'd to approach her, with a <HI>Shriek</HI> or two enough to Frighten all the <HI>Tygers</HI> in the <HI>Wilderness.</HI></P>
<P>THE more to take all cause of Apprehension from the <HI>Staring Husband,</HI> I advanc'd, as she retir'd, still bowing, and assuring her I meant no harm, desiring her to Apprehend no danger from my presence, who was drawn by Accident to Walk that way, and by her <HI>Charms</HI> detain'd to gaze upon her <HI>Person</HI>; all this while the <HI>Subtle Female Devil</HI> kept a <HI>Side-long-glance</HI> upon her Husbands Countenance, who seem'd diverted at the Fright, my <HI>Compliments</HI> had put her in; she saw him smile, and was resolv'd to keep up the <HI>Conceit,</HI> wherefore, while I still continued <HI>Bowing</HI> and Addrest her with a Thousand <HI>Congees,</HI> she <HI>Inhumanely</HI> stoop'd down, and snatching up the <HI>Earthen Pot,</HI> which stood upon the Ground, threw full three <HI>Pints of Water</HI> in my <HI>Face</HI> and <HI>Bosom.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An unexpect∣ed return of Civility.</NOTE>A Reasonable Woman, <HI>one wou'd think,</HI> had been contented with this first Attack, but she, it seems, was of another mind, for while I stoop'd to shake the Water from my <HI>Eyes</HI> and <HI>Linnen,</HI> she fell upon me <HI>like a Lioness,</HI> Tore of my <HI>Perriwig,</HI> and laid about her at so Merciless a Rate, that I began to think the Safest way wou'd be to <HI>Fly,</HI> where <HI>Fighting</HI> was esteem'd <HI>Dishonourable.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY I turn'd about in order to escape, but my <HI>she Adversary</HI> caught me by the <HI>Collar</HI> on the Back-part of my <HI>Neck,</HI> and push'd me on as fast as I well car'd to run, still <HI>Thumping</HI> me upon the <HI>Back,</HI> and calling <HI>Names</HI> as loud as possible, till being got at some considerable distance from her <HI>Husband,</HI> who was all this while half Dead with Laugh∣ing, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Pleasant way of Assig∣nation.</NOTE>she depress'd her Voice, and in the <HI>Softest Accents</HI> she cou'd utter, cry'd, <HI>Fail not to meet me here to Morrow,</HI> and as soon as she had spoke these Words, she push'd me forward, and ran back again as fast as she was <HI>Able.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="231"/>
THE turn of this <HI>last</HI> part of the <HI>Intrigue</HI> surpris'd me ten times more than all the rest; However, I ran back to fetch my Periwig, while she was crossing a <HI>small Bridge</HI> a little higher to get over to her <HI>Husband,</HI> who as soon as his long fit of Mirth allow'd an <HI>Interval,</HI> cry'd out to me, <HI>Excuse her Sir, the</HI> Graecian <HI>Wives are never us'd to Strangers Company, and only love their Husbands Conversation.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A mistaken Husband.</NOTE>As soon as he had made this Speech, he fell a <HI>laugh∣ing</HI> more than ever, and it was with much ado, I cou'd forbear to follow his Example, when I saw the <HI>Fool</HI> begin to <HI>kiss his loving Wife,</HI> and hug her in his Arms, till they got out of sight in their way <HI>homeward.</HI></P>
<P>I must confess I sped so <HI>Ill</HI> at first, that I had little cause to think my <HI>watry Entertainment</HI> was an <HI>Omen</HI> of <HI>Success</HI> in the Conclusion; <HI>Water</HI> will at any time extinguish <HI>Fires,</HI> that have but just <HI>begun</HI> to <HI>blaze,</HI> and she had cool'd my <HI>Flames</HI> a little too soon to tempt 'em to a second kindling, so that I forbore for many reasons going next Day to the aforesaid Place of <HI>Assignation.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A second Meeting.</NOTE>BUT 'twas about a <HI>Fortnight</HI> after, when, as I was walking up a Lane, which ran along the backside of her <HI>Husband's House,</HI> she saw, and bec∣kon'd me to a small <HI>Summer House,</HI> in which she sat at Work, as formerly; <HI>Good-Manners</HI> led me to embraee the <HI>Invitation,</HI> where the first Demand was, <HI>Why I did not come the Day appointed?</HI> I excus'd it as I cou'd, and she proceeded with a number of Assurances to tell me, <HI>how concern'd she was that she had been oblig'd, against her Will, to use me so uncivilly,</HI> and in short, pro∣ceeded to such kind Expressions, that <HI>I every moment</HI> look'd to have another <HI>Invitation</HI> to the Rivers side.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A surprize as bad as the former.</NOTE>BUT in the midst of her Discourse, instead of answering my Expectati∣on, by renewing her kind Summons, she <HI>on a sudden</HI> rais'd her Voice to double heighth, began to spit upon me, and abuse me to a wonderful de∣gree; <HI>however,</HI> I had hardly time to be surpriz'd, before I guess'd the reason of her Change, by seeing her turn round, and call as loud as she cou'd speak, <HI>Dear, Dear, come hither Dear, and shoot this Stranger thro' the Head, I cannot live in quiet for him:</HI> The moment after came the Husband, peep∣ing over his Wives Shoulder, looking after me, who never staid to justi∣fie my self against the <HI>Accusation,</HI> but made the utmost hast to get away, least he shou'd take an Opportunity to do, as his <HI>Good-natur'd Lady</HI> had com∣manded him.</P>
<P>I staid at <HI>Belgrade</HI> some Weeks longer, but took care to go no more that way, and by the strange Discovery I made <HI>hereby</HI> of Womens Temper, I re∣solv'd to bear in my Memory two <HI>Maxims</HI> of this Country, which are, if I mistake not, left as follows.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Merit of the ancient <HI>Grecian</HI> Church.</NOTE>THE <HI>Graecian Church</HI> in former Ages has been famous for Convert∣ing many Nations to the Doctrine of <HI>Christianity,</HI> but is as much decay'd at present as their <HI>Temporal Affairs,</HI> a barbarous <HI>Ignorance</HI> possessing <HI>Ʋniversally</HI> their Notions of <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>WIDELY do they differ, as to point of <HI>Faith,</HI> from <HI>Roman Principles,</HI> and tho' they often have profess'd a perfect Reconciliation to the <HI>Tenets</HI> of that <HI>Church,</HI> and frequently agree'd on certain Articles of <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> it was only at such times as being pinch'd by <HI>Poverty</HI> or other Inconveniencies, they hop'd <HI>Redress</HI> from flattering the <HI>Papal Clergy</HI> into a Belief, that they were willing to embrace the <HI>Romish Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Igno∣rance of the Modern.</NOTE>I have before inform'd you they are subject to the Power of four <HI>Patri∣archs,</HI> those in former times were Men of <HI>Learning,</HI> and <HI>undoubted Piety,</HI> chosen to their Offices for their <HI>Integrity of Life,</HI> and exemplary <HI>Gravity in Conversation</HI>; now the highest <HI>Briber</HI> carries it, and the declining Dignity is strangely sunk from ancient Worth to <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Poverty.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Notion of the Eucha∣rist.</NOTE>THEY Administer the <HI>Eucharist</HI> in both kinds, but as if the very Pra∣ctice of <HI>Religion</HI> shou'd submit to the <HI>Intemperance</HI> of a licentious People, they esteem the <HI>Wine,</HI> not any way <HI>available,</HI> unless they drink it in consi∣derable quantities, a sign <HI>say they,</HI> that what we do, we do with satisfacti∣on, and a <HI>heartiness,</HI> that proves we bear respect to the <HI>injunction</HI>; while the <HI>moderate sipping</HI> of your <HI>Western Churches</HI> seems to speak a kind of force upon your <HI>Inclinations.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Igno∣rance of Mo∣dern <HI>Greeks</HI> in Painting.</NOTE>NOW, tho' they seem to value Painting, they have nothing of the <HI>Ge∣nius</HI> of their fam'd <HI>Apelles</HI> left among them; what they do is very flat, and scarce deserves a better Name than that of daubing; and it is observable, that, notwithstanding their respect for Pictures, they abhorr all sorts of <HI>Sculpture,</HI> with a strange antipathy, refusing to admit them in their Chur∣ches, or even Dwelling Houses, out of a ridiculous Opinion, that the very looking on such <HI>Pieces</HI> savours of <HI>Idolatry.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ever burning Lamps.</NOTE>VAST quantities of Oyl they daily wast, by burning it in Lamps, in all their Churches, never suffering them to extinguish, as believing it a sort of Duty well receiv'd by God, and shewing their respect to the Receptacle of his Divinity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Notions of the State of the Soul after Death.</NOTE>THEY all agree in the necessity of using <HI>Extream Ʋnction,</HI> which they practice, as inducted by St. <HI>James</HI>; they rigorously dissent from the Opini∣on of the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> in relation to the <HI>Existence</HI> of a Purgatory; maintaining, most of them at least, <HI>that the departed Souls of Mortal Men are sensible of neither Joy nor Torment till the Day of Judgement.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fasts and Feasts.</NOTE>THEY Fast on <HI>Wednesdays, Fridays,</HI> and all <HI>Holy Eves,</HI> but Feast on <HI>Saturday,</HI> because <HI>say they,</HI> it was the ancient <HI>Sabaoth,</HI> but I rather am in∣clin'd to think, because they are unwilling to omit the least pretence, whereby they may indulge a craving Appetite.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How far they tolerate Ma∣trimony.</NOTE>THE Clergy are allow'd to Marry once, but <HI>Bigamy</HI> is look'd upon too wanton a desire to be permitted them, and <HI>Trigamy</HI> is so abhorr'd by all the <HI>Greeks,</HI> that it is never known among them, but forbidden with the strictest Prohibition even to the Laity themselves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Lents.</NOTE>THEY keep four <HI>Lents</HI> within the Year, so strictly, that in either 'tis esteem'd a damnable Transgression, and a Sin beyond excuse, to eat the smallest Piece of Flesh, or Fish, wherein there is a drop of Blood contain'd; yet one Exception may be made to this strict Rule, because the <HI>Lent</HI> preceeding <HI>Easter,</HI> is not held so rigid as the other, wherefore all the Laity are then allow'd to eat what kind of Fish their Fancy leads 'em to, or Circumstances can afford 'em.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Litur∣gies, and uni∣versal Igno∣rance, and Stupidity</NOTE>THEY read the Liturgy of St. <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> unless upon their Festivals, and then their Priests attir'd <HI>Pontifically,</HI> read St. <HI>Basil</HI>'s, but with little Signs of Decency or Devotion; and indeed so miserably are they led away by love of Idleness, and long Captivity, that they possess in any kind, but few of those Perfections, which, in former times, distinguish'd their Politer Countrymen, retaining nothing but their <HI>Name,</HI> their very Language be∣ing, as I said before, entirely lost among them; and that ruin'd Nation sunk so low, that from the dread and admiration of the distant World, they are become at present the contempt and pity of the vilest Wretches of the whole Creation; such is the uncertainty of <HI>humane Blessings,</HI> and the cer∣tain <HI>Frailty</HI> of our weak Mortality.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their patri∣archal Seat.</NOTE>AT <HI>Tyberis,</HI> a large City in the Territories of the last, they live in very great respect among the <HI>Natives,</HI> and are very Wealthy by the means of Traffick. Here their <HI>Patriarch</HI> has his Seat, and here the Richest and most Noble of their People fix their Dwellings.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Num∣bers subject to the <HI>Turkish Sultan.</HI></NOTE>BUT the occasion of my speaking of 'em here is, that there are Vast Numbers, like the <HI>Greeks,</HI> remaining subject to the Government of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> who possesses the Dominion of their Ancient Monarchs, by the unresisted force of an Illegal Usurpation, from the Right of <HI>Conquest,</HI> Handed down from Prince to Prince, for Ages long since past, so that they now retain no notion of their former liberty, but live dependant on the Pow'r of a Despotick Tyrant.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Privi∣leges.</NOTE>IN this however, they have better Fortune than their Fellow-Slaves, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> that they are free from that unnatural Duty of delivering their Children, to be sent upon Triennial Seizures to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and enjoy a Hundred Privileges more, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Why given them.</NOTE>because a certain Countryman of theirs, a Flatterer of <HI>Mahomets,</HI> and one, who us'd to Prophesie his Future Great∣ness, gain'd a Promise from him, that he wou'd injoin his Followers, if e∣ver they shou'd see occasion to Invade <HI>Armenia,</HI> and the will of <HI>God</HI> shou'd give it to their Power, that they wou'd distinguish the Inhabitants from other Conquer'd People, by such large Immunities, as shou'd allevi∣ate the Burthen of their <HI>Losses.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cha∣racter.</NOTE>THEY are very Ignorant, but very Honest, Industrious in their Na∣tures, Slow to Anger, and extreamly willing to forgive an Injury; Abste∣mious in their Diet, little Drinkers, and inclin'd to Melancholy and Sedate Retirements; Devout, and Superstitious in a High degree; Patient in Af∣fliction, nor too soon Buoy'd up beyond themselves, by the Successful turns of Chance, or their Endeavours.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Enmity between the <HI>Greeks</HI> and them.</NOTE>IN former Ages they were subject to the <HI>Graecian Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI> but about the time of the Eutychian Heresy, Revolted from his Jurisdiction, and had met with such unbecoming Usage, from the Proud De¦portment of the <HI>Greeks</HI> in those <HI>Old Times,</HI> that ever since, they have Ab∣horr'd their Memory, and now profess so rancour'd an Aversion to the Peo∣ple of that Name, that if by Chance (for it but rarely happens) any <HI>Greek</HI> be∣comes a Convert to the Faith of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> they refuse admiting him a Member of their Church, till they have Rebaptiz'd him after their own Me∣thod.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number, and piety of their Bishops.</NOTE>THERE are above three hundred Bishops of that Nation, scatter'd strangely up and down, with poor Allowances for the support of their De∣gree; which notwithstanding is sufficiently atton'd for, by the Veneration paid 'em from the common People, and the humble dictates of their own Morality, which teaches them contentedly to spend their <HI>Lives</HI> in peaceful Poverty, and raise their Wishes to a <HI>Future Prospect,</HI> far surpassing the chi∣merical Advantages, accruing from the gross and earthly Blessings, which attend the aim of <HI>Prosperous Ambition.</HI></P>
<P>THE Tenets of their Faith are gather'd from the several Opinions of the <HI>Eastern Churches,</HI> strangely shuffled into an obscure Collection; hardly one in fifty can inform a Stranger in the Principles and Grounds of the Re∣ligion he professes: But the Foundation of their <HI>Faith</HI> is altogether built upon the following Articles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Notion of one Na∣ture in Christ.</NOTE>THEY will allow in Christ one Nature only; but yet maintain this No∣tion with a difference from <HI>Eutyches,</HI> and the other Introducers of that Here∣sy; for whereas they taught the Nature of our Saviour to be one, by a com∣mixture of Divine and Human, the <HI>Armenians</HI> hold the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> of those Natures to be made by an entire Conjunction, as the <HI>Soul</HI> of Man is join'd to his <HI>corporeal Substance.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some other Tenets.</NOTE>THEY Administer the <HI>Sacrament</HI> in both kinds, but ardently deny all notion of the real Presence in it: They hold a Purgatory, but reject all praying for the Dead; they disallow of the Supremacy of the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> and joyn with that of <HI>Greece</HI> in their Assertion, that the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> pro∣ceeds but from the Father only, and that the <HI>Souls</HI> of the Departed, Good or Bad, must never feel the smallest share of <HI>Joy</HI> or <HI>Torment,</HI> till the dread∣ful Day of Universal <HI>Judgment.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The abstemi∣ousness of their Priests.</NOTE>THEIR Clergy, like the <HI>Greeks,</HI> are once, and only once, allow'd to Marry; and so very rigid and austerely Exemplary are their Lives, that they abstain from Flesh of any kind, nor can by any means be brought to <HI>eat it</HI> oftner than five times a Year; nor wou'd they then, but in compli∣ance with the humour of the common People, who, as Superstitious in a high degree, might be perswaded to imagine it a Sin to feed on Flesh, shou'd they observe their Priests refuse to do it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fre∣quent Fasting.</NOTE>THEY place the greatest Merit in the World, in duly keeping <HI>Lent,</HI> which they observe with wonderful Devotion and Austerity; and indeed, the vulgar Sort, as knowing little else of their Religion, take such care to be beforehand in this Point, that I have frequently observ'd them fast Day after Day without complaining; and it may be said, within the bounds of Truth, that they fast three Days out of every seven.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They Fast on <HI>Christmass Day.</HI></NOTE>AMONG the many other Days, whereon the Stamp of Custom has in∣joyn'd their Fasting, 'tis observable they always do it upon <HI>Christmass-Day</HI> with double Strictness; what their reason is they cou'd not tell me; use has made it now a <HI>Law,</HI> and they esteem it as their Duty to obey and keep it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their me∣thods of As∣sembling to Devotion.</NOTE>AS for Churches, they have very few, and those they have, are so de∣cay'd by Time, or Accident, that they are hardly fit to hold an Audience; wherefore they assemble to their publick Prayers, and other Ceremonies, in low, private Chambers, where they may be free from Noise, and un∣disturb'd in the calm Exercise of their Religion.

<P>I told my Reader in the beginning of the Chapter, that the People of this Nation are extreamly Poor, and yet entirely Honest; an extraordina∣ry Character, yet what they very well deserve, as what I am about to tell you is a fair <HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Story of a young <HI>Arme∣nian,</HI> land his Honesty.</NOTE>THERE was at the abovenam'd City of <HI>Tyberis,</HI> a young Man not thirty Years of Age, the only Son of an <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchant, who was yet so poor, as hardly to be capable of living in a tolerable Credit: This young Man was much in <HI>Love</HI> with the fair Daughter of a Countryman of his, who gratefully return'd his Passion with an equal value; But both these Families were Poor and Honest, therefore cou'd not see the smallest possi∣bility of doing well, shou'd they by Marriage suffer the fond Couple to encrease a Charge, they found it very difficult to bear without ad∣dition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A bad Condi∣tion.</NOTE>THE hardship of their Fortune, and sincerity of their Affection half distracted them, when they reflected, that the Barrier, which prevented their so much desir'd Bliss, was never likely to be taken off, and found that every Day, as <HI>Love</HI> encreas'd, their <HI>Poverty</HI> grew greater.</P>
<P>THE Poor young Man, industriously inclin'd, had try'd all ways of bettering his Circumstances, but had much ado by all his Labour to sup∣port a Livelyhood, and was become so melancholy by the misery of his Condition, oppress'd at once by <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Indigence,</HI> that he cou'd find no Comfort, but in the Conversation of his <HI>Mistress,</HI> and <HI>that</HI> a sort of <HI>anxious</HI>

<P>HE often walk'd disconsolately out of Town, and wandred up and down, unmindful of his Steps, indulging <HI>Solitude</HI> as a lov'd means of Con∣templation; <HI>one Evening</HI> very late the <HI>Moon</HI> shone bright, and led him on in a smooth <HI>Walk,</HI> that ran along the <HI>great high Road,</HI> till he was met by a <HI>grave Man</HI> in habit of a <HI>Pilgrim,</HI> who saluted him and beg'd he wou'd sup∣port him to the Town, or he shou'd faint before he reach'd it; the young <HI>Armenian</HI> looking earnestly upon his Face, perceiv'd his Colour gone, and all the Marks of sudden Illness plain to be discover'd.</P>
<P>HE ask'd the <HI>Pilgrim,</HI> whither he was bound, who told him, to <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> and again demanding, if he had any <HI>Friends</HI> within the City of <HI>Tyberis,</HI> was inform'd, that he was quite a Stranger, and design'd to take his Lodging in some <HI>publick Han,</HI> or open place of Entertainment, such as is elsewhere describ'd, for <HI>Inns</HI> and <HI>Houses</HI> of <HI>Accommodation,</HI> are not met with in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Countrys.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A compassio∣nate Action.</NOTE>THE good <HI>Armenian</HI> presently consider'd, that the Usage he wou'd meet with in a <HI>publick Han,</HI> cou'd no ways be agreable to his weak Condition, and invited him to lie a <HI>Night</HI> or two at his Father's House, by giving him a frank assurance of a hearty Welcome; this kind offer was immediately embrac'd with many thanks by the <HI>Sick Pilgrim,</HI> so he return'd again, and led his <HI>Guest</HI> back with him, using him with great Civility, and Entertain∣ing him in every kind, as well as the <HI>Condition</HI> of the one requir'd, or the o∣thers <HI>Purse</HI> cou'd possibly <HI>afford him.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Artifice, to prevent Discovery.</NOTE>FIVE Days the <HI>Pilgrim</HI> kept his Bed, and in that time wou'd often talk with the <HI>Armenian</HI> and his <HI>Father,</HI> still concealing who he was, and taking, every now and then, an occasion to complain of his <HI>Misfortunes</HI> and his <HI>Poverty,</HI> till on the fifth Day in the Evening he desir'd the Company of the <HI>Young Man alone,</HI> who came accordingly, and as he us'd to do, began to comfort the <HI>Sick Man</HI> with hopes of quick Recovery.</P>
<P>AT last the <HI>Pilgrim,</HI> interrupting his Discourse, began to <HI>weep,</HI> and ta∣king him by the Hand, inform'd him that he found himself so weak, that he had now no longer <HI>hopes</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> but begg'd him, as he wish'd for Happiness hereafter, to comply with the Request he was about to make him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. Of the <HI>Copties.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Original of the <HI>Copties.</HI></NOTE>TWAS in the <HI>Infancy</HI> of <HI>Christian Doctrine,</HI> that the old Inhabi∣tants of many parts of <HI>Egypt,</HI> chiefly such, as border'd upon <HI>Aethi∣opia,</HI> were Converted to the Faith of <HI>Christ,</HI> by the successful Preaching of the Noble <HI>Eunuch,</HI> who had been inspir'd by <HI>Philip</HI> with the purest Notions of <HI>Religion</HI> and Morality: Those early Converts, who embrac'd the <HI>Gospel there,</HI> transmitted it industriously to the Practice of <HI>Posterity,</HI> and Multitudes of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> constantly profess'd the Doctrine of <HI>Christianity,</HI> thro' all the <HI>Ages</HI> of inhuman <HI>Persecution</HI>; and the <HI>Modern Offspring</HI> of those Ancient People are the <HI>Sect</HI> nam'd <HI>Copties,</HI> whom this Chapter treats of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Causes of their Igno∣rance.</NOTE>BUT, as <HI>humane Nature</HI> is <HI>alone</HI> too weak a <HI>Prop</HI> for <HI>Faith,</HI> and the my∣sterious Knowledge of <HI>Religion,</HI> so, the want of <HI>Spiritual Directors</HI> thro the <HI>Labyrinth</HI> of Darkness, which attended the disorders of successive <HI>Persecutions,</HI> has involv'd them in a <HI>Gulph</HI> of <HI>zealous Ignorance,</HI> and taught 'em an <HI>unna∣tural</HI> and <HI>incoherent</HI> mixture of the Superstitious Practices of <HI>Pagan</HI> Ceremo∣nies, with the heavenly Rites of their profess'd <HI>Christianity.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Circumcision us'd among them, and why.</NOTE>'TIS this Misfortune has confounded their religious Observation of the <HI>Sa∣crament of Baptism,</HI> with the Heathenish Custom of an early <HI>Circumcision,</HI> which they still observe, but rather out of Veneration to the Practice of their <HI>Ancestors,</HI> than any Notion of its <HI>Efficacy</HI> in religious Matters: That it was an <HI>ancient Custom,</HI> we are undeniably convinc'd from the Assertion of so old a <HI>Pen</HI> as that of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> who declares it to have been observ'd among that People, long before the <HI>Age</HI> he liv'd in, they <HI>Circumcise</HI> their <HI>Children</HI> at <HI>eight</HI> Days old, but <HI>Baptise</HI> them not till on the <HI>fortieth.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tainted with the <HI>Jacobin</HI> Herely.</NOTE>THEY were originally tainted with the <HI>Jacobin Heresy,</HI> and rigidly maintain'd the Doctrine of <HI>one sole Nature in our Saviour,</HI> long before <HI>Jaco∣bus</HI> preach'd up that Opinion in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Parts of <HI>Syria</HI>; they are so very cautious, least by chance they shou'd expose his <HI>Person</HI> to the Proof of a <HI>Di∣vision,</HI> that, tho' they own him <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> and <HI>perfect</HI> in both <HI>Essences,</HI> they will not venture to distinguish one from t'other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How agree∣ing with, or dissenting from the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE>THEY administer the <HI>Sacrament</HI> in both kinds, especially to <HI>Infants just Baptiz'd:</HI> They stigmatize the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> with <HI>Heresy,</HI> yet by the too prevailing vigilance of <HI>Missionaries</HI> sent from many Parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> great num∣bers of them frequently embrace the <HI>Romish Doctrine</HI>; they value not the Resolutions of those <HI>General Councils,</HI> held since that of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and with an universal detestation of the Notions of a <HI>Purgatory, Praying for the Souls of the Deceas'd,</HI> and <HI>Extreme Ʋnction,</HI> dissent from those three favorite <HI>Points</HI> of <HI>Roman Doctrine.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their publick Prayers.</NOTE>THEY frequently exalt their Voices, and accompany the <HI>Priest</HI> in strange and unintelligible Noises, using <HI>some</HI> the ancient <HI>genuine Egyptian Language,</HI> now almost forgotten, <HI>some</HI> the <HI>Moorish Dialect,</HI> and <HI>some</HI> the <HI>Tur∣kish</HI>; oftentimes the <HI>Priest,</HI> not much unlike the <HI>Romish elevation of the Host,</HI> lifts up, above his Head, a <HI>Cloth</HI> of <HI>Crimson Colour,</HI> under which is plac'd the <HI>Consecrated Sacrament.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Cu∣stoms in usea∣mong them.</NOTE>THEY Sing the <HI>Psalms</HI> of <HI>David</HI> through at every Meeting, sometimes a Chapter of the <HI>Old,</HI> but oftner of the <HI>New, and more respected Testament,</HI> as Pen'd by <HI>Nicomedes</HI>; they pay no Reverence to the <HI>Pictures</HI> of <HI>our Saviour,</HI> and the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> nor permit them to be plac'd about the <HI>Altar,</HI> tho' they <HI>commonly</HI> are met with in the other <HI>Corners</HI> of their <HI>Churches.</HI></P>

<P>HOWEVER, whether it proceeds from <HI>real Inclination,</HI> or a Notion that the Character of <HI>Conjurer,</HI> wou'd better suit <HI>them,</HI> than another Peo∣ple, by the Stories, which the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and <HI>Tradition</HI> tell the World, of the prodigious Operation of those fam'd <HI>Magicians,</HI> among their Ancestors, who strove so wonderfully to excel the Power of <HI>God</HI> in <HI>Moses</HI>; I say, I know not, which of these excites their <HI>Study,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Lovers of Magick.</NOTE>but 'tis very certain that they all incline to practice <HI>Magick,</HI> or at least such <HI>juggling Arts,</HI> as <HI>with the Vul∣gar</HI> may intitle them to that denomination.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The History, and Original of the <HI>Zinga∣nees.</HI></NOTE>'TWAS in the Reign of <HI>Sultan Selym,</HI> the successful <HI>Turkish Emperour,</HI> who overthrew the Government of the <HI>Circassian Mamalukes,</HI> and added <HI>Egypt</HI> to his own Dominions, that the few remaining <HI>Soldiers</HI> of that Name, who had escap'd the Slaughter, and retir'd in little Numbers to the <HI>Borders</HI> of the <HI>Desart,</HI> were encourag'd by a <HI>certain daring Slave,</HI> nam'd <HI>Zinganeus,</HI> to assemble in one Body, and make use of those <HI>offensive Arms</HI> their hasty Flight had left them, to their best advantage; they consented to the moti∣on, and upon examination found themselves a formidable Body, able to defend their Ground by reason of the difficulty of access, against the Power of all Invaders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Salvage kind of Life.</NOTE>THUS they liv'd some time, made Nightly Inrodes to the fertil Pa∣stures on the Banks of <HI>Nilus, plunder'd Towns, destroy'd Inhabitants, drove off their Cattle,</HI> and committed all Outrages, void of fear, and free from Pu∣nishment, not only keeping so secure a Guard, that they defended their Possessions, but admitting daily Numbers of their <HI>old Companions,</HI> who de∣serted to their Party in considerable Bodies, as often as they found conveni∣ent Opportunities.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Turks,</HI> who dreaded what might be the Consequences of this threat∣ning growth of Power, sent Great Commanders with some regular Forces to <HI>reduce</HI> them to Obedience; who fell short in their Designs, and were sent back <HI>half ruin'd,</HI> to assure their Officers, they were to cope with greater Strength than they imagin'd.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="248"/>
IN short, the <HI>Turks</HI> perceiv'd so great a Difficulty in the Method they must take to bring 'em to Subjection, that they rather chose to offer Terms of Friendship, and Accommodation, which the <HI>Mamalukes</HI> as rea∣dily accepted of, as growing weary of the <HI>Dangerous Alarums</HI> they were Hourly Subject to, so that a Peace was soon concluded, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Articles of Accommoda∣tion.</NOTE>and the Articles thereof Obliging the <HI>Circassians</HI> to lay down their Arms, permitted them to exercise what other way of Living, their desires wou'd lead 'em to make choice of.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Civil Discipline</HI> agreeing rarely with the <HI>Military Genius</HI> of licen∣tious Multitudes, they grew unruly, and became so prejudicial to the common Interest, that the offended <HI>Turks</HI> at last grew weary of forgiv∣ing, and Enacted a degree, that every <HI>ZINGANEE, for they were so distin∣guish'd, from the Name of their Ringleader,</HI> shou'd in Fourteen Days depart the Kingdom: <NOTE PLACE="marg">They are Ba∣nish'd <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE>This was so severely put in Execution, that in less than two Months space, not one remain'd, who <HI>Publickly</HI> durst own himself of <HI>that Denomination,</HI> for it was made Lawfull for what Man soever met them, when their Date expired, to <HI>Take, Kill, Enstave,</HI> or <HI>Ʋse</HI> them as he thought convenient.</P>
<P>NO Man from that time forward e'er knew certainly, what became of <HI>Zinganeus</HI> their Commander, tho 'tis commonly believ'd he staid in <HI>Egypt,</HI> where at present <HI>his Posterity</HI> and that of <HI>his Companions,</HI> openly dare own themselves. A certain Prophecy is spread about, relating to some fu∣ture hopes, Predominant on the Opinion of the <HI>Zinganees,</HI> tho <HI>few</HI> among the <HI>Turks,</HI> regard or Value it. The <HI>Prophecy</HI> as 'tis Express'd in the <HI>Egypti∣an Language,</HI> varies nothing from the following purpose.

<P>HE <HI>try'd</HI> his <HI>Hatchet,</HI> which was neatly made, and had a fine <HI>turn'd Helve,</HI> and <HI>Leather Case</HI> to keep the Head from wet, and found it so ex∣ceeding Good, that he commended it extreamly to the Man, who made it, and profess'd he wou'd not lose it for its <HI>double Value.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Cheating Temper.</NOTE>NOTHING cou'd have been more <HI>welcom News,</HI> or <HI>fairer Invitation</HI> to the <HI>Zinganee</HI> than this, he presently resolv'd to find some opportunity of stealing back the <HI>Hatchet,</HI> that he might oblige the <HI>Gentleman</HI> to buy ano∣ther, or reward him well for the pretence of having found the <HI>old one.</HI></P>
<P>IN short, he <HI>watch'd</HI> a day or two, and having made his observation of the Place 'twas laid in, soon found means to get it, and was met one Mor∣ning by the Owner, as he hasten'd from the Chamber with the mark of <HI>Theft</HI> about him; The <HI>Gentleman,</HI> surpriz'd to see a <HI>Zinganee</HI> in his <HI>Apart∣ment,</HI> took him by the Arm as he was passing by, and ask'd him somewhat

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Story of an Accident, which befel the Author in his Travels.</NOTE>I Travell'd once, with a considerable Number of my Countrymen, and other People, thro this Country, and was musing <HI>Pensively</HI> behind my Company <HI>on Horseback</HI> in an easy Pace, when from a kind of <HI>Bushy Covert</HI> on one side the Road, there Started out a Man, of <HI>Venerable Age, Long Beard,</HI> and <HI>Decent Habit</HI>; In his Shrivel'd Hand he held a Staff, and a <HI>Con∣vulsive Palsie</HI> shook his Head with an Incessant Motion.</P>
<P>HE came forward Slowly, Beckning me to stay, as if he had some Busi∣ness of Importance to Communicate; I stop'd my <HI>Horse,</HI> whose <HI>Main</HI> he <HI>Strok'd</HI> with his <HI>Right Hand,</HI> when he came to me, and Seizing on my <HI>Boot Top</HI> with his <HI>Left,</HI> let fall his Staff, and look'd so earnestly upon my Face, that I was Struck with a Surprize at the uncommon method of his Salu∣tation.</P>
<P>I ask'd him, if he <HI>knew me,</HI> or had any thing to tell me, that he look'd upon me with such <HI>Eagerness</HI>; He <HI>Skook his Head</HI> with double force, and after having us'd some Wonderfull Expressions, which for certain Reasons I forbear to mention here, he told me that a dangerous Cloud hung o'er my Head, and Threaten'd me with Sudden Death; <NOTE PLACE="marg">An unwel∣come Salutati∣on.</NOTE>Perhaps, <HI>Young Man,</HI> says he, you have not half an Hour of Life to come, but <HI>Heaven,</HI> (which only can) avert the <HI>Omen!</HI></P>
<P>YOU must needs Imagine I was somewhat Startled at this declaration, which the Old Man had no sooner made, than he departed, Looking Back almost at every step he took, and lifting up his Eyes in seeming Sign of some concern, which look'd like Pity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Wonderful Adventure.</NOTE>AT last, I fansy'd him a kind of Madman, and converted Contempla∣tion to a fit of Mirth, so Gallop'd, on as fast as I cou'd Ride, to overtake my Company, and entertain 'em with the Story of my odd Adventure; But I had not Rode four Hundred Paces, when from a Cross Road, lead∣ing thro' a kind of Wood, on either side, appear'd some Horse-men Arm'd with <HI>Javelins,</HI> who with elevated Weapons stop'd my Passage, and made signs that I should presently alight, or they would throw them at me.</P>
<P>HERE the Sudden turn of a Reflection on the Probability of that short Space of Life, alloted me by the Old Man, more deeply terrify'd me than the presence of my Enemies; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Surprizing turn of For∣tune.</NOTE>I made a Shift, unknowing in a manner what I did, to lay my Hand upon a <HI>Pistol,</HI> and had just presented it when all the Horse-men Gallop'd off together, with a Motion equally Surprizing for its Swiftness and Occasion.</P>
<P>THAT very Moment struck my Ears with the loud Sound of a large <HI>Bra∣zen Trumpet,</HI> which a Member of our Company had carry'd with him, and the Noise of Horses-Feer, as if they Gallop'd; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A timely suc∣cour.</NOTE>Presently appear'd the Major part of my Companions, who had miss'd me, and came Back by the Ad∣vice of an Old Guide among them, who Inform'd 'em 'twas a Dangerous thing to Straggle from ones Company, in such a part of such a Country.</P>

<P>HOWEVER, as I was too curious in my Inclinations to rest content with the Reports of other Men, in Places, where I cou'd inform my self by ocular experience, I resolv'd to go on Shore, and was the more desi∣rous to become a Witness of the Miserable Blot, which had defac'd so fair a Copy, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grounds of that Mi∣stake.</NOTE>because I very well remembred to have met a <HI>Jew</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> who had assur'd me there was more to be Discover'd on the Shore of <HI>Troy,</HI> than commonly was credited, but the dangerous Barbarity of the Inhabitants was such, as rendred it a hazardous attempt, and consequently frighted many People from Landing in that Country.</P>
<P>THE Captain of the Ship, wherein I Sail'd, oblig'd me with his Boat, while adverse Winds detain'd us on the Coast, and one <HI>Francisco Condaliso,</HI> an <HI>Italian Priest,</HI> who had been long a <HI>Missionary</HI> in the <HI>Eastern Countries,</HI> and at present, if alive, resides at <HI>Padua,</HI> consented to Accompany me; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author Lands at <HI>Troy.</HI></NOTE>we Landed in a very Fair and spacious Harbour, probably the same, which formerly receiv'd the Boats of <HI>Greece,</HI> returning <HI>to and fro</HI> with <HI>Sol∣diers</HI> and <HI>Provisions.</HI></P>
<P>WE Walk'd about three Miles up thro' the Country, on a Ground still rising from the <HI>Sea</HI> with small Acclivity, but overgrown with Brakes and Brambles, as, indeed, is every part, which Borders on the <HI>Sea,</HI> for many Miles along that Land, so that the First Remark I made in this my <HI>Trojan</HI> Expedition, was that my <HI>old Country-man</HI> the <HI>Ballad-maker,</HI> was mistaken in his <HI>Calculation.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Piece of the Old Walls of <HI>Troy.</HI></NOTE>UPON a closer view, and digging up the Obstacles, which interpos'd themselves, we plainly found, it was a part of some <HI>Old Wall,</HI> and with our <HI>Scymetars</HI> removing all the Brambles, and low Bushes near it, we Disco∣ver'd it to be near Thirteen Foot in Breadth, but Narrower and Higher in some Places, than it was in others.</P>
<P>TRACING it with more than common difficulty, thro' a little Knot of Bushes, we had soon lost sight of it, and dug in vain, as deep as we cou'd thrust our Swords, to find if it continued farther on; However, hav∣ing met so fair encouragement, we chearfully proceeded near a <HI>Quarter of a Mile,</HI> and there Discover'd at considerable distance, something like a <HI>Rug∣ged Wall,</HI> or broken <HI>Ruin</HI> of an <HI>Ancient Building.</HI></P>

COMING near it, we perceiv'd it was the same continued Piece of Building, we had lately lost, and on a close Examination found it of a black and solid Stone, appearing join'd by Mortar, which the length of time had notwithstanding, hard'ned into Substance, of an equal firmness with the Stone it self.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A description of it.</NOTE>THE Sizes of the Stones were very different, but rather small, than of extraordinary Magnitude, for few exceeded half a Foot in their Diameter.

<P>A Dangerous Tempest forc'd <HI>our Ship</HI> to seek a <HI>Shelter</HI> in a certain <HI>Creek</HI> upon the <HI>Southward</HI> of this <HI>Island,</HI> where we Anchor'd pretty safely, and were drawn by the delightful Prospect of the <HI>Shore</HI> to <HI>Land</HI> upon it, <HI>about Six in Company.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A pleasant Accident.</NOTE>WE left the Boat, which brought us from the Ship, within a little <HI>Nook</HI> or <HI>Bay,</HI> nigh <HI>Land, lock'd</HI> by the <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Rocky Ground</HI> about it, and were Walking on the Shore in order to ascend the Country, when we Spy'd upon the <HI>Water-side</HI> a thing, which at a distance look'd not much unlike a <HI>Washing-Tub.</HI></P>
<P>WE Walk'd directly to it, and perceiv'd it was a <HI>Vessel</HI> of a very small and Incapacious Hollow, full of <HI>Oyl,</HI> in which were Swimming up and down near Twenty little <HI>Engines,</HI> which upon Examination, we discover'd to be <HI>Sponges,</HI> each containing upon either side, a little piece of <HI>Cork,</HI> which being
<PB N="211" REF="263"/>
fastned to the middle, kept the <HI>Sponge</HI> it self afloat, and only suffer'd half to move in, or imbibe the <HI>Oyl</HI> within the <HI>Vessel.</HI></P>
<P>WE were Busied a considerable time in looking on these things, and wondring what shou'd be their use in so remote a Place, from any <HI>Town,</HI> as that appear'd, whereon we found 'em, but at last resolv'd to sit us down upon the <HI>Sand,</HI> and wait the coming of an owner to the <HI>Vessel,</HI> for we thought it Probable there was one, and believ'd he cou'd not long be absent.</P>
<P>BUT, while we Talk'd to one another of the Wondrous Smoothness of the Waters in the <HI>Bay,</HI> while those without were Ruffled by the Storm, and cast our Eyes upon their stillness, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Strange sur∣prize.</NOTE>we were all surpriz'd to see a thing not much unlike a <HI>Basket,</HI> pop with force above the <HI>Surface,</HI> and continue Moving up and down a little Space; then up there started something like a Man, who shook his Head, rub'd clear his Eyes, and Swam directly in∣wards to the Place we sate on, pushing in the <HI>Basket</HI> just before him.</P>
<P>THIS Second Figure really startled us beyond the First, and brought to our remembrance an <HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Sea God Neptune,</HI> for we hardly cou'd believe him <HI>Mortal,</HI> who had risen from the Water, by whose side we had been sitting nigh ten Minutes.</P>
<P>THE Man, for such he prov'd to be, no sooner saw us, but he seem'd a little Shy of Landing, till we beckon'd him, and call'd as kindly as we could, and so perswaded him to come ashore, and bring the <HI>Basket</HI> with him. He had left his Cloathes, and other things behind the <HI>Rock</HI> not ten Yards from us, and immediately ran thither for them; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Diving <HI>Bas∣ket.</HI></NOTE>in the mean time we approach'd his <HI>Basket,</HI> found it quite bound round with <HI>Cork,</HI> and co∣ver'd with a <HI>Canvass,</HI> in the midst whereof appear'd a Slit, thro which we put our hands, and drew out <HI>Sponges</HI> of a surprizing Bigness.</P>
<P>THE Man return'd as soon as dress'd, and finding us more civil than he had expected, told us in a kind of <HI>Lingua Franca,</HI> that those <HI>Sponges</HI> grew on <HI>Rocks,</HI> Ten, Fifteen, sometimes Twenty Fathom deep; that there were many Hundred <HI>Divers</HI> in the <HI>Island,</HI> some of whom had left him just before, who got their <HI>Livelyhoods</HI> like him, by gathering <HI>Sponges.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A curious Di∣ving project.</NOTE>THEN he shew'd us how they were enabled to perform it, in the following manner. Half the <HI>Sponge,</HI> as I have said, is soak'd in <HI>Oyl,</HI> the other half is dip'd before in certain <HI>Stiptic Waters,</HI> to prevent the <HI>Oyl</HI> from Penetrating farther than it ought to go, when so prepar'd, they take the <HI>Sponge,</HI> and thrusting it within their Mouths, the <HI>Oyl'd</HI> part outward (but of that, almost an Inch within the Lips) they press their Teeth a little hard upon it, and by that means force the <HI>Oyly Sponge</HI> to close the En∣trance of their Mouths against the <HI>Water.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Sponges are gather'd.</NOTE>THUS they <HI>Dive,</HI> and with a little difficulty in a <HI>Streighten'd Suction</HI> make a Shift to tarry under <HI>Water</HI> a considerable time.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How long they tarry un∣der Water.</NOTE>BY constant Practice many of these <HI>Divers</HI> are arriv'd at such Perfecti∣on in the Art, that they can tarry under Water till the Oyl corrupts, which it will always do in less than two hours time.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Island <HI>Patmos.</HI></NOTE><HI>PATMOS</HI> is an Island, very small and full of Rocks, extreamly Bar∣ren, not affording even the common Necessaries for support of human Life, which therefore the Inhabitants supply themselves withall from other Islands of the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> The Land is Mountainous, and has no more
<PB N="213" REF="265"/>
than one small City, which Equips a Fleet of Trading Vessels to Import Conveniencies from Foreign Parts; the ancient Name is chang'd at present to <HI>Palmosa.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Place is famous for the Character it has of being the Seat, St. <HI>John</HI> made Choice of, while he Pen'd his <HI>Revelations</HI>; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Monastery on a Hill.</NOTE>and upon a Moun∣tain in the <HI>Northern</HI> Parts, there stands a Monastery of the <HI>Graecian Coloie∣ro's,</HI> who profess that Saint their Patron, and pretend to shew some Reliques to inquiring Travellers.</P>
<P>THE Notice, which I had hereof, oblig'd me to the hopes of seeing <HI>Patmos,</HI> and a Tempest was so favourable to my Wishes, that we anchor'd in a Haven not far distant from the Monastery; and the Opportunity invi∣ting me a Shore, I landed with design to Walk and Visit it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Northern</HI> side of <HI>Patmos</HI> is but very thinly Peopled, and as I was destitute thereby, of any means to get a <HI>Guide,</HI> so, either want of Curiosity, or Indisposition by the roughness of the Storm, disswaded those on board our Vessel from consenting to go with me.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author lands at <HI>Pat∣mos.</HI></NOTE>HOWEVER, since the Road appear'd but short, and seemingly conspicuous, I resolv'd to undertake the Visit single, so I landed with a pair of Pistols and a Scymetar, and cross'd a little kind of Plain, which brought me to the bottom of a Hill, on which the Monastery had its Situ∣ation.</P>
<P>THE Hill was overgrown with a large Wood, thro' which appear'd no other Passage than a small Foot Path, and that not beaten, but a very unfrequented way, which led me thro' an hundred several turnings to As∣cents extreamly steep, and intricate as Labyrinths.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Loses his way in a Wood.</NOTE>I came at last, where I perceiv'd the Wood grow thinner, and cou'd see a pretty way before me; there I stop'd, and looking up, discover'd on the Brow of an impending Precipice a little Hut, or Cave, which seem'd the Habitation of some melancholy <HI>Hermit,</HI> or unhappy Lover, like the Swains of ancient Times, who, being baffled in their Hopes, forsook the World for some forlorn and solitary Wilderness, to spend the remnant of their silent Days in Grief for their Misfortunes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovers a Cave.</NOTE>SURPRIZ'D at first, by the Romantic Air of this low Cave, I stood a while, to think if it were safe to venture forward, since it was a probable belief, that some wild Beast had chose that Den for the rough Scene of his Retirement; but that groundless Apprehension vanish'd instantly, for while I yet continued in suspense, methoughts I cou'd discover plainly something like a Door, that stood a jarr, and consequently rendred it a Place improper for a Salvage Mansion.</P>
<P>I advanc'd with equal Doubt and Curiosity, till, having gain'd the summit of the Precipice, I found it was a Cell, the Door of which stood half way open, and contain'd upon its smooth outside, a piece of course, and half-lost Painting, with the following <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence in a homely Cha∣racter.
<Q><L><NOTE PLACE="marg">With an In∣scription on the Door.</NOTE>Hic, &amp; in Coelo Quies.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Here, <HI>and in</HI> Heaven <HI>is</HI> Rest.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="266"/>
THE softness of this first Discovery invited me to make a Step beyond it, so that with a gentle Force I push'd the Door quite open, and was all amaz'd, when I perceiv'd the inside of the Cell as still as Possible; no Or∣nament appear'd to set it off, but just against the Entrance burnt a Lamp, on either side a little Altar, and the weak and broken Light, which they afforded, faintly striking thro' the dullness of the Place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Finds a Man in a black Coffin.</NOTE>discover'd in the midst, a large black Coffin, fill'd with something not to be distinguish'd, but as black, and dismal in its first appearance, as the Coffin it was laid in.</P>
<P>NOTHING (I then thought) cou'd add to my surprize, which yet was doubled, when there rose, with a deliberate Silence from within the Coffin, something like a Man, or rather Spirit, who no sooner sate up∣right, than looking on me with a frightful Aspect, he pronounc'd these Words in a low Voice,
<Q><L><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who invites him into the Place.</NOTE>Che sei, se un Christiano, ben-venuto.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Who are you? If a <HI>Christian,</HI> you are welcome.</L></Q></P>
<P>BY the Language of his Salutation I perceiv'd him an <HI>Italian,</HI> and the trembling of his Limbs perswaded me to think, that the appearance of my Scymetar and Pistols had as much surpriz'd him, as he had me. I there∣fore took immediate care to undeceive him in the apprehension he had fram'd, that I was some arm'd Robber, and inform'd him that I was a <HI>Briton,</HI> Travelling the World, and thrown by Chance upon that Island, where I landed with design to Visit the <HI>Greek</HI> Monastery.</P>
<P>THE old Man seem'd transported with the News, made shift to rise, and led me to a Seat, hewn roughly from the Rock within the Cell; he laid his Hands upon my Head, pronounc'd a grave and honest Blessing, and proceeded modestly to take the liberty of asking some few Questions, which I willingly oblig'd him with as ready Answers to.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Which proves to be a Her∣mits Cell.</NOTE>HE then abandon'd all the Coyness of his first deportment, and inform'd me, he had liv'd a Hermit's Life in that poor Cell nigh two and thirty Years together, that he frequently was visited by the Fryars of the Mona∣stery not far distant, that they sometimes brought him Meat and Wine, which he consented <HI>now and then</HI> to take for the support of Nature, tho' he rather chose to live on Roots and clear Spring Water; that he always Slept in that black Coffin, never to be absent from a strong <HI>Memento</HI> of his frail Mortality; that he was born (I think) at <HI>Zant,</HI> and nam'd <HI>Antonio, Giacomo Malaviso.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Chappel in the Wood.</NOTE>I purposely omit some Hours Discourse, I had with this old Hermit, because digressive from the Cause for which I mention him, and only will inform my Reader, that he wou'd accompany me to a small Chappel in the Wood, at no great distance from his Cell, built over the Stone Cave. wherein St. <HI>John</HI> is said to have resided, while he Writ his famous Book of <HI>Revelations.</HI></P>
<P>HE left me there, first recommending me to the Civilities of certain Priests, who kept the Chappel: They receiv'd and treated me with won∣derful Respect, and having talk'd away an Hour in Questioning each other, as we thought convenient, they proceeded to unlock a private Door, which open'd from a corner of the Chappel to a very dark and nar∣row Passage.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cave, wherein St. <HI>John</HI> is said to have Writt his Revelati∣ons.</NOTE>WE Descended some few steps, and having Walk'd about six paces far∣ther, came upon a sudden to a very large and lightsome Cave, the Light was introduc'd by very Artificial Hollows, from the Surface through the Rock, and in the midst of one of the Four Squares, which form'd the Cell, was cut a Seat, exactly like the <HI>Niches</HI> made for Statues in <HI>Cathe∣dral Churches.</HI></P>
<P>JUST before this <HI>Niche,</HI> there stands a solid Rocky Table, of about a yard Square, and here they wou'd perswade us to beleive, the <HI>Saint</HI> was seated at his daily Studies. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reliques in the Cave.</NOTE>To confirm me in belief of this Opinion, they made long Harangues of those Authentic proofs, which justified Tradition, and desir'd that I would take particular and serious Notice of a kind of round Impression on the <HI>Area,</HI> or <HI>Superficies</HI> of the Table, which they say was caus'd by the Perpetual standing of the Brazen Vessel, which contain'd his Ink, and on the Floor, they show'd me several little Marks like Spots of <HI>Black,</HI> which they assur'd me, were the Drops, occasion'd by the Shaking of the Pen, where∣with the <HI>Saint</HI> was us'd to Write the Dictates of his holy Inspiration.</P>

<P>HOW they came by <HI>St. John</HI>'s Right Hand, they cou'd not tell me, but attested that on every Second Sunday of the Month, the Nails were Cut, as close as possible, and that they always grew again.

The <HI>Voice</HI> re∣ply'd, As soon as thou art come to the <HI>Palodes,</HI> let it be Proclaim'd aloud, that <HI>Pan,</HI> Great <HI>Pan</HI> is Dead.</P>
<P>A sudden Horror seiz'd the Company, to hear this strange and unexpected Salutation; presently the Wind came fair, and as the Ship drew near the Place abovenam'd, <HI>Thamus,</HI> as he was desir'd, stood high upon the Poop, and with an elevated Voice, cry'd, <HI>Pan is Dead,</HI> when in a Moment, all the Air was torn with Groanings, and a mix'd Confusion of <HI>complaining Ac∣cents,</HI> so extreamly dismal, that it cannot be imagin'd.</P>

<P>BEFORE I enter on the Subject of the Chapter, promis'd by the Heads abovemention'd, 'twill possibly, be needfull, I should say a Word or two, to undeceive such Gentlemen, as by the General Title, I have given my Book, may be induc'd to think, I meant to Write a full Description of the Present State of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> in regard to its Extent, Inhabitants, and Forms of Government, which, tho' perhaps my Opportunities enabled me to do more fully than most former Writers, yet it would require a length too tedious and digressive from my purpose to en∣large upon that Subject.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How far the Author Treats of <HI>Aethiopia.</HI></NOTE>I only mean to speak so far of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> as the Country interferes with my Discourse upon the <HI>Source</HI> and <HI>Channel</HI> of the <HI>River Nilus,</HI> as I have had occasion elsewhere in this Book, to mention the Religion of the <HI>Persians,</HI> Customs of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and some other points relating to such Countries, as were widely distant from my purpose, and were therefore Treated of no farther than they had dependance <HI>on,</HI> or Interest <HI>in</HI> the <HI>Turkish Empire.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Discourse of <HI>Aethiopia.</HI></NOTE>HOWEVER, that vast Tract of Land, distinguish'd <HI>amongst Christians</HI> by the Name of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> is not as is commonly beleiv'd, commanded by the Arbitrary Nod of <HI>one Great Monarch,</HI> whom we vulgarly call <HI>Presler John,</HI> but by corruption of the Genuine Word, which is no more than <HI>Prissir-Jan,</HI> which in the Language of the Country, signifies <HI>Renown'd</HI> or <HI>Mighty Emperor.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How divided in their Inte∣rests,</NOTE>AND as the <HI>Int'rests</HI> of these Princes are so widely separated, so are their <HI>Professions of Religion</HI> and <HI>Morality:</HI> Those under the Dominion of the late nam'd <HI>Prissir Jan</HI> are <HI>Christians,</HI> or at least usurp that Title; I say <HI>usurp,</HI> because unfortifi'd by <HI>Truth</HI> or <HI>Learning,</HI> they have grossly mingled sordid Remnants of their <HI>old Idolatry</HI> with the diviner Practices of <HI>Christian Duty.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why difficult to Travel there.</NOTE>IT is <HI>perhaps,</HI> to their unreasonable <HI>Hatred</HI> of all kind of <HI>Strangers,</HI> that the Civiliz'd Inhabitants of <HI>Europe</HI> owe their Ignorance of those <HI>remote</HI> and <HI>dark'ned</HI> Corners of the <HI>distant World</HI>; for as they are prohibited by Princi∣ple to <HI>entertain,</HI> or even preserve the Lives of curious Travellers, it has been hitherto impossible to make Discoveries by the Endeavours of Adventurous Men <HI>alone,</HI> or <HI>amicable Parties</HI>; and the mighty distance, they are at from <HI>Christian Powers,</HI> the spacious Countries, interposing their extensive Lands; the <HI>Mountains, Lakes,</HI> and <HI>Desarts</HI> inaccessible to all Approaches, were in e∣very Age, and <HI>still</HI> continue formidable <HI>Barriers</HI> to the aim of <HI>Curiosity</HI> or efforts of <HI>Ambition.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The most re∣ceiv'd, and probable Opi∣nion.</NOTE>AMONG all these, the most receiv'd and probable Opinion is, the First belief of <HI>Diodorus Siculus, that the Encrease of the Waters is occasion'd by continual Rains, not Melting Snow, upon the Hills of Aethiopia</HI>; and the Rea∣sons, which are given in defence of this Assertion, are as follow.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Reasons.</NOTE><HI>FIRST,</HI> for many Days before the Inundation happens, all the Skies are seen in <HI>Egypt,</HI> full of Black and Treatning Clouds, incessantly produc∣ing <HI>rumbling Noises,</HI> and by <HI>Northern Tempests</HI> driven fiercely towards the <HI>Southern Parts,</HI> where always follows <HI>Rain</HI> in great abundance, frequently near Threescore Days together.</P>
<P>ANOTHER reason for this last opinion is, the <HI>Muddy thickness of the Waters, when they overflow the Country,</HI> for, Rushing violently thro' so many Tracts of Fertil Land, they tear up great and hourly quantities of fatning soil, which, mixing thickly with the swelling streams, is left upon the scorch'd and barren Sands of <HI>Egypt,</HI> of a very deep and <HI>slimy</HI> substance.</P>
<P>MANY other reasons are by the Inhabitants produc'd, to prove the Justice and Solidity of this accepted Modern Notion; but as tedious Ob∣servations, and unnecessary Repetitions grow <HI>Prolix</HI> and <HI>Heavy</HI> on a Reader, I will say no more upon the Present Subject, than that all the <HI>Naturalists,</HI> reputed Famous in the <HI>Eastern Countries,</HI> agree among themselves in full belief of this Assertion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The goodness of the Water of the <HI>Nilus.</HI></NOTE>I must inform my Reader now, that as this River boasts peculiar pro∣perties in <HI>Fractifying</HI> Nations to so rich a Plenty, so its Blessings many other ways are equally particular; his Waters are observ'd to be for ever free from <HI>Mists</HI> or <HI>Vapours, Sweet</HI> to such an Admirable and uncommon relish, that tis difficult (if hoodwink'd) to distinguish it from <HI>Milk.</HI></P>

<P>THE breadth of <HI>Nilus,</HI> when within the Bounds of its own natural Course, is equal to the <HI>Thames,</HI> a Mile or two below the Bridge at <HI>London,</HI> and upon the Banks on either side are built small, poor, and inconsiderable

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A necessary Caution.</NOTE>HOWEVER, led of late, to think of their own safety by the many fa∣tal <HI>Accidents,</HI> which have from time to time attended such, as rashly trusted to implor'd <HI>Good-Fortune,</HI> and were disappointed of her Favours, they have found a way to free the Passengers of their own Country or a Foreign one, from those presumptious Insolences of <HI>Arabian Robbers</HI>; for at present, none attempt a Voyage on the <HI>Nile,</HI> without providing usefull <HI>Fire-Arms,</HI> and ve∣ry frequently a <HI>Guardian Janizary,</HI> by whose faithful Care, and honest Courage they may be Protected safely from those villanous Outrages, whose effects have <HI>often</HI> prov'd unhappy to the headstrong Resolutions of <HI>unguarded Obstinacy</HI>; so cautious ought a Traveller to be, who <HI>ignorant of Danger</HI> from an <HI>ignorance of Custom,</HI> may, unknowingly, involve himself and Company in the unfear'd Misfortune of some treacherous, swift and unexpected Ruin.</P>

AFTERWARDS, they chose a <HI>Caliph</HI> of their own, who was suc∣ceeded in a long uninterrupted Line of full three hundred Years, when <HI>Alme∣ric</HI> the <HI>Sixth,</HI> King of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> invaded and reduc'd them to a great extremity.</P>
<P>AMIDST this <HI>exigency,</HI> they entreated Succour from the <HI>Syrians,</HI> whose designing <HI>Sultan</HI> sent immediately a greater Aid than was demanded from him; but as soon as they had beat the <HI>Christians</HI> back to their Pos∣sessions, <HI>Sarco,</HI> General of the <HI>Syrian</HI> Forces, murder'd basely the <HI>Egyptian Caliph,</HI> and usurp'd the Kingdom to his own Dominion.</P>

<P>BY the Assistance of these bold and hardy Men he grew successfull in the Wars, he made upon his Foes the <HI>Christians,</HI> till at last, the <HI>Slaves</HI> too well acquainted with the fatal Power, wherewith he trusted them, <HI>ungratefully</HI> Revolted from their just Obedience, murder'd <HI>Melec-Salha'a,</HI> and upon the bloody Ruins of his broken Power, erected a <HI>New Form of Government</HI> a∣mong themselves, inviting into <HI>Egypt</HI> all their Country-men, or purcha∣sing in every Place, as many of them, as had formerly been taken.</P>
<P>THUS the Government of these <HI>revolted Slaves</HI> became in time extreamly Powerfull, dreadfull to their Enemies, and rich in their Possessions, still main∣taining their Dominions strongly and with resolution very near three hun∣dred Years; whereby they grew a famous People, and were known by the denomination of <HI>Circassian Mamalukes,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Over∣throw and Downfall.</NOTE>till <HI>Sultan Selym,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Turks,</HI> in the Success of long and bloody Wars, o'erthrew their Govern∣ment, and so brought <HI>Egypt</HI> under his Subjection.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A pleasant Story of a Fidler and his Ass.</NOTE>A merry kind of Fellow, of a <HI>Moorish Extract,</HI> us'd to walk about the City with a sort of <HI>Fiddle,</HI> and divert the <HI>Passers by,</HI> with the re∣peated Airs of one dull Tune; and in return for this, 'tis true, he did not beg Reward, yet by a subtle <HI>Stratagem</HI> came off so well, that he succeeded generally better than a <HI>Down-right Beggar</HI> cou'd have reasonably hop'd for.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ingenious Fellow</HI> kept an <HI>Ass,</HI> that always follow'd him from Street to Street, without the trouble of his leading him along, he carried on his back a little Budget, which contain'd <HI>Provisions,</HI> and the necessary Utensils, his Master wanted in his daily Journeys.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ass of good address.</NOTE>EVERY Man, the <HI>Fidler</HI> met, he bow'd his Body to, by way of In∣formation, that he hop'd for the Receipt of a small piece of Money, from his grateful Liberality; and still, as often as the <HI>Fidler</HI> bow'd, the <HI>Ass</HI> bow'd too, as he had been instructed, in so strange a manner, and an <HI>Air</HI> so truly like himself, that all, who pass'd the Streets, were mov'd to Laugh∣ter, and not seldom, <HI>Gentlemen</HI> have given the <HI>Man</HI> a Present for the Pleasure, they receiv'd from the surprizing Prospect of his <HI>Asse</HI>'s No∣velty, who constantly, with such another <HI>Cringe,</HI> return'd the Compli∣ment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A cunning Practice.</NOTE>BUT, if it chanc'd, that any Man pass'd by regardless of the <HI>Fidler</HI>'s Musick, or Request, nor thought it worth his while to pay him for his Harmony; The <HI>Ass,</HI> who cunningly came on behind, at a considerable distance, and observ'd all Passages, but yet pretended not to mind 'em, watch'd their coming, and took care to snap a Piece, from off the <HI>Brit∣ches</HI> of the unsuspecting Person; or, if he went by at too great distance, on the other side the way, he frequently turn'd back, and bit out his Revenge, as soon as he had overtaken him: This pleasant Humour of the <HI>Fidler</HI> and his <HI>Ass</HI> became at last so very noted, that Both the <HI>Master's Profit,</HI> and the great <HI>Respect,</HI> they shew'd the <HI>Beast,</HI> grew daily more and more, for really 'twas a dangerous Accident to meet 'em in the Street, for such, as hap'ned to be unprovided of a Charm to soften his Resentment.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Trick, they have of Getting Money, is by training Camels up to dance about the Streets, upon the Sounding of a Drum, or any other Instrument of Musick. This they do with admira∣abe quickness in the manner following.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their way of teaching Ca∣mels to Dance.</NOTE>THEY make a large square hollow Place on some Stone Pavement, not unlike a Bath, of such a depth, that nothing, let down thither, can get out again but with the same Assistance, he was first put in by.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Stones of which the first is built.</NOTE>THE first Great <HI>Pyramid</HI> is built of vast and solid Stones, which some pretend were brought from <HI>Quarries</HI> in the Mountains of <HI>Arabia</HI>; but the gross Absurdity of that Opinion, is extreamly evident from many Demon∣strations, but by none more fully dis-anull'd than the <HI>remaining Pieces of Sawn Stone,</HI> which lying up and down upon the <HI>Sand</HI> about the <HI>Pyramid,</HI> sufficiently convince a thinking Man, that they were dug no farther

<P>SOME Stones, and those not seldom met with, near the top of this a∣mazing <HI>Structure,</HI> are no less than five and twenty, often thirty Foot in length, and depth proportionable: It is a wonderful but very pleasant and engaging Prospect, to observe the <HI>Art</HI> and strange <HI>Oeconomy,</HI> whereby this mighty <HI>Pyramid,</HI> was built so loftily. <NOTE PLACE="marg">To be ascen∣ded on the out-side.</NOTE>You may ascend it gradually on the <HI>external Sides,</HI> or <HI>Steps,</HI> which lead you safely to the <HI>Summit</HI> of the <HI>Buil∣ding.</HI></P>

<P>THIS Man, who knew full well the Power, he was Master of, and scorn'd to fear the <HI>Insults</HI> of a poor unthinking <HI>Mob,</HI> which he was sent to Govern, fram'd a bold and sudden Resolution to inform himself immedi∣ately, by the convincing Proofs of <HI>Ocular</HI> Demonstration, of the various Wonders and surprizing Strokes of Art, which he had often heard discours'd of, on occasionally mentioning the <HI>Pyramids</HI> of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>

<P>NOR fell he short in his expected ends of going thither, and as the Dis∣coveries, he made, were such, as never yet were told the World, it will not be unwelcome, since my self and five more <HI>Christian Travellers</HI> were suffer'd to accompany him, if I here particularize the <HI>gradual</HI> advan∣ces, which, with curious notice of the most <HI>minute,</HI> or <HI>great</HI> re∣mark, <HI>then</HI> led us leisurely thro' every part of that stupendious Fa∣brick.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Gal∣lery of the Pyramid.</NOTE>FROM <HI>hence</HI> we were oblig'd to clamber up an huge and massy kind of Stone, near ten Foot high, which brought us to the entrance of the low∣est <HI>Gallery,</HI> whose Pavement, of a polish'd white and shining Marble, gent∣ly rises with a smooth <HI>acclivity</HI>; the breadth thereof was near five Foot, the height a little more, the Sides and Roof were flagg'd with Stones, of an unpolish'd, rough, and softer Substance than the Marble of the Pavement; the height of this first Gallery, exceeded, rather than fell short of six score Foot of <HI>English</HI> Measure.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Gallery</HI> was terminated by a very thick and solid Wall, thro' which a <HI>Hole,</HI> about the bigness of the first, by which we entred to the <HI>Py∣ramid,</HI> admitted us directly to another <HI>Gallery,</HI> of very fine and stately <HI>Workmanship,</HI> but <HI>in its length</HI> inferior to the former; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A very dread∣ful horrid Well.</NOTE>hence we entred on an open space, which led us to the Brink of a most dreadful <HI>Well,</HI> a strange Descent of such <HI>forbidding horror</HI> in its black appearance, that the very ap∣prehensions of its <HI>Depth</HI> and <HI>Danger,</HI> has for many Ages frightned the desire of Curious Men, from <HI>even aiming</HI> at a further Satisfaction, than by passing hastily along its edges, to attain the entrance of another Passage, leading to Apartments, which I shall describe <HI>hereafter:</HI> Here we stop'd, and by direction from the <HI>Grand Bashaw,</HI> who was <HI>himself</HI> amongst us with a lighted Torch, surrounded the Descent, whose Mouth was near three Yards in its <HI>Diameter.</HI></P>

<P>THESE Balls, once set on fire and thrown down, discover'd, at the bottom of the Pit, a strange disorder'd heap of <HI>Sand</HI> and <HI>Rubbish</HI>; it was near ten Yards in <HI>depth,</HI> and had no Stairs, whereby Descent had formerly been made, but certain Hollows, cut like <HI>Pidgeon-Holes,</HI> quite round the inside of the Well, directed those, who would think fit to venture down, to use promiscuously their Hands and Feet, and so enable them to satisfy their Curiosity, without great danger to their Persons.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Wooden Coffin in it.</NOTE>WE found it no great labour to remove the <HI>Stone,</HI> which cover'd the <HI>Se∣pulchre,</HI> and were much amaz'd, when, contrary to expectation, we beheld therein a <HI>Wooden Coffin,</HI> or at least appearing to be <HI>Wood</HI> by <HI>Touch</HI> and <HI>Figure.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the <HI>Coffin Lid</HI> were represented, in a kind of <HI>Inlaid gilt Work,</HI> the distinct and several Figures following.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hieroglyphics</HI> on the Coffin Lid.</NOTE>AN <HI>Eagle</HI> first appear'd upon a sort of Throne, supported by four Wing'd Faces, not unlike the notions, we conceive of <HI>Cherubims</HI>; but by their swelling Cheeks and blustering Breath, sent forth four different ways, I rather guess they were at first, design'd to represent the four great Winds of <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Eagle</HI> with severe and sullen aspect lookt directly at a Man, who held in his <HI>Right</HI> Hand <HI>a pair of Compasses,</HI> and had his <HI>Left</HI> extend∣ed in a form, which represented him demanding Mercy, while half sinking in an opening Gulph, which loosening likewise the Foundations of a <HI>Towring Pyramid,</HI> which stood before him; <HI>that also</HI> seem'd just Tumb∣ling after him, kick'd downward by the Foot of an old Man, whose <HI>Right</HI> Hand held a <HI>Scyth,</HI> while with his <HI>Left</HI> he drew along a <HI>Cloud,</HI> which he appear'd designing to throw over both the <HI>Man</HI> and <HI>Pyra∣mid,</HI> thereby to cover their appearance in a thick obscurity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The meaning of them.</NOTE>NOW among the many <HI>Hieroglyphic Images,</HI> whereby the <HI>Old Egypti∣ans</HI> represented <HI>GOD,</HI> they often chose the <HI>Eagle</HI> in regard to the <HI>sharp Sightedness,</HI> that Bird is fam'd for, as an Emblem to express his Attri∣bute of sure <HI>Omniscience,</HI> as the four Winds <HI>there</HI> plac'd, were meant to represent the vast extent of his unbounded Power, over every Cor∣ner of the World, the Winds can blow upon.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Eagle</HI>'s looking so severely on the falling Man, may probably denote <HI>God's</HI> anger at the <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Vanity,</HI> wherewith he had indulg'd his Merits, on the Building that huge Fabrick, which appear'd before him; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authors Opinion, whose the Tomb was.</NOTE>for I take this sinking Man to have been done, for the Great <HI>Architect</HI> of the <HI>Egyptian Pyramids.</HI></P>

<P>SO that, if I may be allow'd to have guess'd right, in the <HI>Interpretation</HI> of these <HI>Hieroglyphic Figures,</HI> they'll be found to signify as much, as if in <HI>Com∣mon Characters,</HI> we should set down the following Sentences.

<P>FOREWARN'D by the Example of these Men, we <HI>cautiously</HI> pro∣ceeded to inspect the entrance of a <HI>dismal Cavity,</HI> and that we might the better see the nature of the Place, cast in before us many of the <HI>Balls,</HI> I late∣ly spoke of, which, by flaming greatly, did not only clear the Prospect of that <HI>gloomy Passage,</HI> but diffus'd an efficacious kind of <HI>Warmth,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">How dissipa∣ted.</NOTE>which, dis∣sipating soon the hurtful Vapours, or unwholesome Closeness of the Place, encourag'd us to enter with our <HI>lighted Torches.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hieroglyphic Figures.</NOTE>UPON the Sides, Floor, Roof, and the above-nam'd Benches, we discover'd plainly <HI>certain ancient Hieroglyphics,</HI> most of which were <HI>unintel∣ligible,</HI> or at least extreamly <HI>difficult</HI> to all our Apprehensions.</P>
<P>SOME <HI>however,</HI> I took pains to think upon, and flatter'd my Belief with the Opinion, that I could Interpret their <HI>Significations,</HI> and among the rest it may not be unpleasant, should I mention <HI>One,</HI> for the <HI>Diversion</HI> of the Reader.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First Figure.</NOTE>NEAR half a Foot above the Bench, the <HI>Hieroglyphic</HI> took beginning in the figure of an <HI>Infant,</HI> sleeping in a Cradle on the lowermost Stair of <HI>Ten,</HI> which reaching to the Roof upon the uppermost supported an <HI>Old Man,</HI> extreamly feble in his Aspect, bending with the Weight of <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Misery,</HI> and seeming ready to <HI>fall down</HI> and <HI>die</HI> immediately.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Second Fi∣gure.</NOTE>A Man, who seem'd to be of <HI>Middle Age,</HI> was represented on the sixth or seventh Step, his <HI>left Hand</HI> full of certain <HI>Chains,</HI> in number equal to the Stairs, he had ascended; to the respective <HI>ends</HI> of each long Chain, were fastned many things like <HI>Globes,</HI> of different sizes; his <HI>right Hand</HI> seem'd with eagerness employ'd, in grasping many other Chains, as he as∣cended further.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="306"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">These Fi∣gures, what design'd to re∣present.</NOTE>THE Stairs, which, as I said before, were <HI>Ten</HI> in number, were in∣tended (as I guess'd) to represent the <HI>Ten Great Stages</HI> of our human Life, which very rarely goes beyond <HI>one hundred Years:</HI> The Child <HI>there</HI> sleeping in a Cradle on the lowest Stair, I take to signify the ten first Years of <HI>help∣less Infancy:</HI> The <HI>Weak Old Man</HI> was <HI>Lifes great Period,</HI> and the utmost Age of <HI>frail Mortality.</HI></P>
<P>THE Man of <HI>Middle Age,</HI> upon the sixth or seventh Stair, was <HI>nothing,</HI> but an <HI>Emblem</HI> of our Mortal Life, 'twixt <HI>Theescore Years</HI> and <HI>Seventy</HI>: The Chains with <HI>Globes</HI> of different sizes, fastned to one end, which he endea∣vour'd eagerly to grasp, as he ascended, signifi'd no more than that a Man, who Travels toward <HI>Old Age,</HI> should make good use of <HI>every Moment,</HI> in collecting <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and retaining it with resolution; <NOTE PLACE="marg">How the old <HI>Egyptians</HI> in Hierogly∣phics, repre∣sented Wis∣dom.</NOTE>for the <HI>Old Egypti∣ans</HI> represented <HI>Wisdom</HI> by the <HI>Hieroglyphic Figure</HI> of a <HI>Globe</HI> or <HI>Circle,</HI> to de∣note that it was boundless, and the different Magnitudes of all those Balls express'd the great variety of <HI>Worth</HI> in <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences.</HI></P>
<P>THE Application therefore of this <HI>Hieroglyphical Contrivance,</HI> seems <HI>conspicuous</HI> to my <HI>probably mistaken Judgement,</HI> which, by putting the above∣nam'd Thoughts together, fram'd immediately the following Interpretati∣on of the <HI>dubious Emblem.</HI>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Moral Re∣flections.</NOTE>AND excellently Good is the Advice, this admirable <HI>Hieroglyphic</HI> gives Mankind; how heavily and full of sorrow sits <HI>Old Age,</HI> on that unhappy Wretch, who in the fruitless Journey of his <HI>growing Life,</HI> has still omitted all his Opportunities of laying up the <HI>Treasure,</HI> of a serious <HI>Contemplation,</HI> or <HI>im∣prov'd Capacity,</HI> whereby to soften the unpleasant <HI>harshness</HI> of the Burthen, <HI>Time mispent</HI> has laid upon his Shoulders.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Wiser Man,</HI> who never knew to live in vain, but daily ga∣thers an <HI>encreasing Stock</HI> of <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Discretion,</HI> to <HI>enrich</HI> the dry and barren <HI>Soil, Old Age</HI> must bring him to, will never feel the Stings of <HI>Igno∣rance</HI> and discontented <HI>Solitude</HI>; but, when he finds himself decay'd in <HI>Strength of Body,</HI> can reflect with <HI>Solon</HI> on the <HI>Vertues</HI> of his <HI>Mind,</HI> and ba∣nish <HI>Grief</HI> in the transporting Repetition of the following Sentence.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's own Opinion.</NOTE>INDEED I am the most inclinable to a <HI>Belief</HI> of this last <HI>Guess,</HI> for many Reasons; <HI>two especially,</HI> the first, because the numerous <HI>Hieroglyphics,</HI> carv'd upon the Rocks, have been such, as seem to 'em fansy'd for the <HI>Con∣templation</HI> of <HI>Religious Persons,</HI> and because, had all those Places been design'd for the conveying <HI>Water</HI> from the <HI>River Nilus, Hieroglyphic</HI> had been cer∣tainly a very <HI>odd,</HI> and <HI>needless Ornament.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Reasons.</NOTE>AND <HI>secondly,</HI> because <HI>without the Pyramids</HI> in many Places, still remain the <HI>rows of Caves, hewn</HI> deeply in the Rocks, where <HI>formerly</HI> the <HI>superstitious Priests</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> us'd to dwell, employ'd in several different Services in the <HI>Romantic</HI> Offices of their <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>WHATE'ER they be, we found the utmost of our <HI>Labour</HI> vainly spent in hopes of gaining further <HI>Knowledge,</HI> so return'd again the way, we had descended, till we came to the beforenam'd <HI>rugged Place,</HI> which brought us to the <HI>brink</HI> of the <HI>deep Well,</HI> I have been speaking of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Passage leading to a Square, with∣in the Pyra∣mid.</NOTE>ASCENDED from the <HI>Well,</HI> we went directly forward, and exactly in a Line with the before-nam'd <HI>second Gallery,</HI> we entred a small <HI>Neck</HI> or <HI>Passage,</HI> scarce five Yards in length, and very narrow; this admitted us to a large <HI>Square,</HI> a little <HI>finer</HI> than the <HI>former,</HI> but in <HI>Magnitude</HI> not far exceeding it; the <HI>Stones</HI> whereof 'tis built, are so extreamly large, and yet so wonder∣fully closely Jointed, that the nicest Eye can scarce distinguish, where abouts they join together; and it is the <HI>mighty Size</HI> of those prodigious Stones, and the Politeness of their <HI>Workmanship,</HI> that yields such cause for Travellers <HI>A∣mazement,</HI> when they see the <HI>Fabrick</HI> of those towring <HI>Pyramids.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The dimensi∣ons of the Square.</NOTE>WE found this Square no less than near an hundred Foot, and thence proceeded to a <HI>vaulted Chamber,</HI> sixteen Foot in height, near twenty long, and eighteen broad or thereabouts; the <HI>Stones,</HI> which flagg the angled Roof of this large Chamber, are of <HI>admirable smoothness</HI> and <HI>surprizing mag∣nitude</HI>; but all the <HI>Walls</HI> are plaister'd over with a <HI>Limy Substance,</HI> wonder∣fully <HI>firm,</HI> and not inferior even to Stone it self, for its appearance or dura∣tion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Niche in the Wall.</NOTE>JUST <HI>equidistant</HI> from the <HI>Eastern Angles</HI> of this Room, and on that side thereof, we found a kind of hollow <HI>Niche,</HI> which seem'd <HI>at first</HI> to have been made to hold some <HI>Statue,</HI> as an <HI>Ornament</HI> or <HI>Idol,</HI> but upon a <HI>nice Inspection,</HI> we imagin'd, it was possible, there might be something of a Passage into other <HI>undiscover'd Chambers</HI> of the <HI>Pyramid,</HI> whereupon the Men had Orders to endeavour <HI>by their Instruments,</HI> to find it out.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Enter'd.</NOTE>WE Entred, and Descended, strangely struck with <HI>Grave-like Smells,</HI> and <HI>dusty odours,</HI> there was cut a Passage down, by certain Stairs, whose Winding Turns, and <HI>Labyrinth of changes</HI> led us on with wonderfull sur∣prize, and eager curiosity, till we imagin'd, we had gone almost the Height of all the <HI>Pyramid</HI> below its Bottom. All the way was <HI>Hewn</HI> laboriously from the <HI>Rock</HI> it self, and commonly so very low and narrow, that but one cou'd possibly go down <HI>full-breasted,</HI> and <HI>that one</HI> was forc'd to stoop with incommodious Forwardness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Vaulted Passage, un∣der Ground.</NOTE>THE Bottom of these <HI>Stairs</HI> at last, admitted us to a low <HI>Vaulted Pas∣sage,</HI> strait but narrow, which continu'd in one form, for a considerable way together, letting in a <HI>Glimmering Light,</HI> which look'd like <HI>Day,</HI> thro certain little Holes, of almost undistinguishable size and Workman∣ship.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange As∣cent.</NOTE>IN all the Horrour and Amazement possible, from the surprizing odd∣ness of the Place, we Walk'd in, we proceeded, till we found the strait∣ness of the Passage terminated by another <HI>Winding Stair-Case,</HI> leading <HI>upwards,</HI> in as strange a manner as the other <HI>downwards.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Passage Clos'd.</NOTE>WE Ascended here, and found no difference in Form or Magnitude, be∣tween this Passage and the former, till we perceiv'd it clos'd by cer∣tain <HI>Massy</HI> Stones above our Heads, and several other, on each side the <HI>Stair-Case.</HI></P>
<P>HERE we stop'd, and for a while amus'd our selves with strange <HI>Re∣flections</HI> on the Nature of the Place, and <HI>Thoughts,</HI> which way we might get out, without returning the same Road, we came; some Passage out, we were assur'd, there was, else cou'd not comprehend the use of all those steps, by which we had ascended.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Moveable Stone Disco∣ver'd.</NOTE>AT last, some Men, belonging to the <HI>Great Bashaw,</HI> and famous Masters of the Art of <HI>Architecture,</HI> as in Fashion in the <HI>Eastern Countries,</HI> looking earnestly about the Place, perceiv'd one <HI>Stone,</HI> much smaller than the rest, and by the Application of their <HI>Irons,</HI> after many <HI>fruitless efforts,</HI> found it stir, and by <HI>repeated Labours,</HI> so prevail'd at last, that they quite lifted it from out the Place, it stood in, and by forcible addition of a doubled strength, quite thrust it from the Hole, it stop'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Storm of Sand.</NOTE>BUT we had little reason to be pleas'd with this success, for in the very Moment, that the Stone was lifted out, there Showr'd down on us such <HI>Impetuous Tides</HI> of <HI>Rolling Sand,</HI> that in the space of <HI>half a Minute,</HI> we were almost <HI>Buried Quick,</HI> and <HI>wholly overwhelm'd</HI> with its amazing violence.</P>
<P>NO sooner was this <HI>Sandy Storm,</HI> and our surprize thereat abated, but we open'd all our <HI>Eyes</HI>; and found our selves <HI>half Swallow'd</HI> by it, yet those Men, who stood the nearest to the <HI>Hole,</HI> perceiv'd it wider at the Top than Bottom, and the Stone, which fill'd it, being likewise so, had serv'd to stop it up effectually, and till then, prevented all that Sand, which lay upon it from a possibility of Entrance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author and his Com∣pany rise, without the <HI>Pyramid.</HI></NOTE>ON either side the <HI>Hole,</HI> and <HI>Rock below it,</HI> there were cut <HI>Square Nooks,</HI> wherein by thrusting Hands and Feet, a Man, without great difficulty, might ascend, and by those means we all got up, in order as we stood, and were beyond belief surpriz'd, not only to <HI>behold</HI> an open <HI>Sky,</HI> which plainly shew'd us, that we were without the <HI>Pyramid,</HI> but to <HI>perceive</HI> our selves within a Spacious <HI>Hollow</HI> on the lofty Head

<P>THESE three above-nam'd Uses are the only ones, to which the <HI>Turks</HI> apply the Sums, they gain from the <HI>Egyptian Tribute,</HI> nor is it law∣ful by the fix'd Decrees of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Empire, that the Sums thence rising, should be any ways perverted to what Use soever, devious from the ends, to which they are appointed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Re∣venue is so small.</NOTE>'TIS true, nine hundred thousand Pounds a Year are no great Income, from the Conquest of a Country, so exceeding famous for her known Fertility; that, when the <HI>Romans</HI> conquer'd her of old, she gain'd the Name of <HI>Granary</HI> to that successful Empire.

The Fellow was a little back∣ward, alledging, in excuse of his <HI>unwillingness,</HI> that 'twas an Inconvenien∣cy, to lie a Night abroad upon the <HI>Open Desart</HI>; but assuring him, we wou'd rather Travel all Night long, he consented to go with us.

We were pleas'd to see the Coast so clear, that not the smallest Tract of <HI>Man</HI> or <HI>Beast</HI> appear'd to give us cause of Jealousy. We alighted from our <HI>Mules,</HI> and tying them toge∣ther, went towards the <HI>largest</HI> Stone, we saw amongst them, and turning it with much ado aside, were all surpriz'd to see securely fastned, and rowl'd up on the inside, a <HI>Ladder</HI> of <HI>Ropes</HI>; but imagining it might have been left there, by some, who had descended <HI>formerly,</HI> we spar'd the trou∣ble of making use of a Conveniency, our <HI>Guide</HI> had with him, and having unfolded what we found <HI>there</HI> ready, went <HI>backwards down,</HI> with each Man a <HI>Pistol</HI> in one Hand, and a <HI>lighted</HI> Torch in the other: A strange <HI>un∣common</HI> Smell saluted our first Entrance, with an Odour, not to be imagin'd by such, as have not known it by Experience, and the <HI>blazing</HI> Torches, striking a faint glimmering Light thro' the thickness of the <HI>Gloom,</HI> discover'd, as we walk'd along on either side, the <HI>discolour'd</HI> Faces of the <HI>Dead,</HI> with a <HI>strange</HI> and <HI>inexpressible</HI> Horrour: We had scarce pass'd three Yards within the Vault, when the <HI>foremost</HI> of our Company, stumbling accidentally on something, that lay in his way, fell <HI>headlong</HI> over it; whereupon, holding down our Torches, we perceiv'd two Men in <HI>Christian</HI> Habits, extended cross each other, and appearing <HI>newly</HI> Dead, with all the <HI>pale</HI> and <HI>frightful</HI> Marks of a Convulsive Horrour, in their contracted <HI>Joints</HI> and <HI>Faces:</HI> Be∣tween the Feet of one there lay a <HI>Pocket Book</HI> and <HI>Pencil,</HI> which taking up and opening, we read with great Difficulty and more Concern the fol∣lowing Lines, <HI>there</HI> Written in <HI>Italian,</HI> but in a Character, that was hardly legible; for besides the Confusion of one Letter running into another, the Lines were <HI>here and there</HI> writ upon certain <HI>others,</HI> which seem'd to have been design'd, as <HI>Memorandums</HI> for several private Businesses.

<P>IT should seem by the melancholy Contents of this small <HI>Pocket Book,</HI> that these unfortunate Gentlemen had been observ'd to enter, by some <HI>Ara∣bian</HI> Murderers; and the <HI>sequel</HI> of this Relation will I think, incline the Reader to the same Opinion.

<P><HI>AMAZ'D,</HI> and half confounded at the miserable Objects, which we saw before us, we began to think upon the Danger, we were in; the Ap∣prehension whereof encreas'd immediately to a <HI>double</HI> Magnitude, by the <HI>ghastly</HI> Looks and <HI>trembling</HI> Agonies, which shook the heartless <HI>Guide</HI> with fierce Convulsions: <HI>As</HI> we knew him <HI>more</HI> familiar than our selves with the Customs of his Country, <HI>so</HI> we guess'd our Danger more extraordinary by the Fright, we <HI>saw</HI> him in; and judging it a necessary Prudence, to make the best of Time and Opportunity, <HI>we</HI> retreated with the utmost hast to the Place, <HI>we</HI> came in at, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A dangerous Surprize</NOTE>but to our great Surprize, perceiv'd the <HI>Stone</HI> plac'd over the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the Descent the very Moment, <HI>we</HI> came directly under it; with all the fright imaginable <HI>we</HI> began to seek the <HI>Rope,</HI> by which <HI>we</HI> had Descended, but 'twas taken up, and all the hopes of our Deliverance from that <HI>dreadful Prison,</HI> were entirely dash'd to nothing, by the unexpected turn of such a sad <HI>Catastrophe</HI>: 'Twas <HI>here we</HI> felt the fear of Death, in all its roughest <HI>Attributes</HI>; and the Guide, <HI>who</HI> shou'd have giv'n us Comfort in our deep Extremity, encreas'd the <HI>weight</HI> of our Concern, by piercing <HI>Cries</HI> and oft-repeated <HI>Curses</HI> on our rash Attempt, which had involv'd <HI>our selves,</HI> and <HI>him</HI> in one promiscuous Ruin; and would destroy in him, the chief Support and poor <HI>Subsistence</HI> of his unhappy <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Family.</HI> For my part, tho' expos'd in equal measure to the threatned Misery, I <HI>was</HI> so strongly mov'd by the Sighs, Groans, Tears, and <HI>wring∣ing</HI> Hands of this complaining Wretch, that I forgot the Nature of the Place, I walk'd in, and forming <HI>strange</HI> unreasonable Hopes, that <HI>we</HI> might find some other Passage, urg'd the Company to ramble farther thro' those dismal <HI>Cavities</HI>; but considering the Horror, <HI>which in such a Place,</HI> the want of Light wou'd soon produce, and <HI>willing</HI> to keep back the evil Hour, as long as possible, <HI>we</HI> extinguish'd Four of our Five Torches, and with the sickly Light of the <HI>remaining One,</HI> walk'd on with heavy Hearts from <HI>Vault</HI> to <HI>Vault,</HI> quite thro' those dismal <HI>Mansions</HI>; till at a little distance from the <HI>Guide,</HI> who bore the Light before us, <HI>we</HI> perceiv'd with <HI>more</HI> than <HI>common</HI> Terrour, the <HI>faint</HI> Idea's of six Pale Faces, close against the Wall, that stood before us; <HI>we started</HI> at the Sight, and saw them move as if they stalk'd to come upon us <HI>undiscover'd</HI>; so that rightly guessing they design'd no good, with one consent <HI>we fir'd our Pistols</HI>; 'tis impossible to make the Reader sensible, of the prodigious loud Report and rumbling Noise this <HI>one</HI> Discharge created in the <HI>Vault,</HI> it roll'd above our Heads like some uncommon Clap of <HI>Thunder,</HI> and continued, still encreasing, a consi∣derable time: Whether <HI>Fear,</HI> or some unlucky <HI>Accident</HI> produc'd the Cause, I cannot well determine, but the frighted <HI>Guide</HI> let fall his <HI>Torch,</HI> which presently extinguish'd, and running <HI>backwards</HI> with <HI>impetuous</HI> Fury, beat down a Gentleman of our Company, and tumbling on the Ground, lay still in a most <HI>profound</HI> and <HI>breathless</HI> Silence: When the <HI>Report</HI> was over, <HI>we</HI> expected every Moment to have <HI>heard</HI> or <HI>felt</HI> the Persons, <HI>we</HI> had seen before us; but all was strangely still, no <HI>Tread</HI> or <HI>Voice</HI> alarm'd our Fears nor could <HI>we</HI> guess, what Accident had rid us of our Danger; till thro' the Wall <HI>before us, we</HI> perceiv'd a sudden Ray of Light break briskly in; and coming to the Place, found <HI>there</HI> a Hole, dug thro' the Stone, or <HI>Brick,</HI>

which open'd largely into another <HI>Catacomb,</HI> thro' which <HI>we</HI> saw the Pas∣sage, that had let in so much Light upon us, and heard an <HI>unintelligible</HI> Noise of Hallowing descend, as from the Mouth of that uncover'd <HI>Cavity</HI>; thro' which, <HI>we</HI> could perceive distinctly <HI>Six</HI> Tall Men, climb swiftly up, and seem'd confus'd, as if afraid of some <HI>approaching</HI> Danger: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's strange Escape from the Vault.</NOTE>The fear of dying in that <HI>horrid</HI> Place, had banish'd every other from our Thoughts, so that getting <HI>eagerly</HI> tho' the broken Wall, <HI>we</HI> ran immediately to the Entrance of the <HI>Vault,</HI> and hearing neither <HI>Voice,</HI> nor any <HI>other</HI> Sign of their conti∣nuing above, <HI>we</HI> ventur'd to ascend, as <HI>they</HI> had done; and certainly the Light of Heaven did never more <HI>Enliven</HI> Man, than it did our joyful Com∣pany, at such a strange Deliverance.</P>
<P>NO sooner were <HI>we up,</HI> but looking round, <HI>we</HI> could perceive Four <HI>Arabs,</HI> riding hastily towards the left side of the <HI>Desart,</HI> leading away our <HI>Mules,</HI> as lawful Booty, and follow'd, at some distance, by <HI>Six others:</HI> On the right of our unlucky Station, <HI>we</HI> perceiv'd a Troop of <HI>Turkish Horse-Men,</HI> whom <HI>we</HI> knew by their Appearance, to belong to the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> and to be part of those convenient Forces, kept on purpose to <HI>Patrole</HI> from Place to Place, and guard the Country, from the presumptuous Insults of these <HI>Ara∣bian</HI> Villanies: <HI>Till then,</HI> I never met a <HI>Turkish</HI> Party with the smallest Sa∣tisfaction, but was now transported with a boundless Joy, at the <HI>welcome</HI> Prospect of their first <HI>Appearance.</HI></P>
<P>WE walk'd to meet them, and informing their <HI>Commanding</HI> Officer, of what had pass'd, he strait detach'd a Number of his Men to gallop after them, who were no sooner seen advancing by the <HI>Wary Arabs,</HI> but they set our <HI>Captiv'd</HI> Mules at Liberty, and soon outran the hopes of their <HI>less-swift</HI> Pursuers: However, <HI>we</HI> were very well contented to have sped so well, and fearing we might lose our Safety, by the dangerous Absence of our new-come Champions, <HI>we</HI> agreed to give the <HI>Officer</HI> the value of Five and Twenty Shillings <HI>a piece,</HI> upon Condition, he would see us safely to the <HI>Neighbourhood of Cairo</HI>; He accepted the <HI>Proposal,</HI> and invited us to de∣scend again, while <HI>he</HI> with several of his Men, would keep us Company, and leave the rest <HI>above</HI> to watch for our Security: His offering to accom∣pany us, <HI>convinc'd</HI> us of his <HI>Honesty,</HI> and missing the poor <HI>Guide,</HI> who had been left below, <NOTE PLACE="marg">They descend again.</NOTE><HI>we</HI> ventur'd once again, to visit the <HI>late</HI> Scene of our Mis∣fortune; being enter'd with <HI>three Lights,</HI> which the <HI>Captain</HI> order'd to be carried, such as I have <HI>elsewhere</HI> largely treated of, and which afford a Flame, much <HI>brighter</HI> and more <HI>powerful</HI> than our small Torches, <HI>we</HI> proceeded gra∣dually <HI>from Place to Place,,</HI> and search'd in vain o'er all the Vaults for the <HI>poor frighted Fellow,</HI> we had left behind us, till <HI>at last,</HI> arriving at the farthest end of that first <HI>Catacomb,</HI> which <HI>we</HI> descended, we observ'd one <HI>Mummy</HI> higher than the rest, and drawing near, to view it more particularly, <HI>we</HI> could perceive it stir, at which surpriz'd, and calling for the <HI>Lights,</HI> to know its meaning, the first thing, <NOTE PLACE="marg">They find the Guide, hid under a Mummy.</NOTE><HI>we</HI> saw, was the <HI>poor Guide,</HI> who, being crowded in between the <HI>Wall</HI> and the <HI>Mummy,</HI> was creeping under it, as far as he was able, and turn'd his Eyes upon the <HI>Lights</HI> and <HI>Company,</HI> with such a dismal Languish, that it threw us into a long and violent fit of Laughter. The Honest Man's Simplicity, had perswaded him that, if he lay close, he might pass for a <HI>Mummy,</HI> and having crawl'd <HI>from Vault to Vault,</HI> he chose that Place for his <HI>Asylum</HI> from those <HI>Arabs,</HI> for whom he <HI>now</HI> mistook the <HI>Turkish Soldiers.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A joyful Transport.</NOTE>HE heard us <HI>laugh,</HI> and looking earnestly about him, found with a sur∣prizing Joy, that he had been <HI>mistaken</HI> in his Apprehensions, and the rapid Transports, thence oppressing his recover'd Spirits, made him <HI>start</HI> from his unnecessary Shelter, and embracing me, who then unluckily stood nearest him, express'd the Sense, he had of his <HI>scarce credited Delivery,</HI> with such

Ungovernable signs of Satisfaction, in the Leaping <HI>up and down,</HI> that Treading frequently upon my Feet, I was oblig'd to shake him off with <HI>Roughness,</HI> unbecoming <HI>the Soft</HI> Airs of due Congratulation.</P>
<P>NOW had we time, without the <HI>fear</HI> of a succeeding Danger, to inspect, with all the <HI>Zeal</HI> of an unlimitted Curiosity, those gloomy Tracts of Death and Terrour, in whose dismal Paths we had <HI>before</HI> been so amazing∣ly surpriz'd, by dangerous Interruption.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Observa∣tions, they made in their Second Des∣cent.</NOTE>THE Observations <HI>then,</HI> which, favour'd by so fair an Opportunity, we made, were these; the Bodies of the <HI>Mummies,</HI> not exceeding <HI>in their Stature</HI> those of common Height <HI>now Living,</HI> are a certain confutation of that <HI>old mistake,</HI> which Teaches many to believe that, as the World In∣creases in her <HI>Age,</HI> Mankind decrease in <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Magnitude.</HI></P>
<P>THE many Thousand Folds, which <HI>Swath'd</HI> some Bodies <HI>in the Ca∣tacomb,</HI> were Wound about the <HI>Corps,</HI> with so much smoothness, and such admirable Art and Neatness of Contrivance, that the Nicest Hand <HI>Modern Times</HI> would fall so short of <HI>equalling,</HI> that they could never <HI>Imitate</HI> the Beauties of the Practice, should they <HI>now</HI> attempt it.</P>
<P>WE all took Notice, that the Heads of many <HI>Mummies</HI> were di∣vided from their Bodies, and perceiv'd <HI>that Part</HI> the Weakest, and most prejudic'd by Time, even in those <HI>Corps,</HI> which seem'd intire, and no ways Rob'd of their Original Proportion.</P>
<P>THE Faces of such Bodies, as appear'd the Richest, by their <HI>Orna∣ments</HI> and <HI>ways of Lying,</HI> we observ'd all coverd over with a very <HI>thin and Shining Aromatic Searcloath,</HI> of such admirable form and such a Skilful Preparation, that it only serv'd to keep the Head more <HI>lasting</HI> and <HI>en∣tire</HI> (which <HI>else</HI> was found a Part most subject to decay) without ob∣scuring the Appearance of the Countenance, or altering <HI>even the Mi∣nutest turn</HI> of any <HI>Feature.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Painted Rolls.</NOTE>THE <HI>Rolls,</HI> which lay on many of their Breasts, contain'd, <HI>as I have said before,</HI> a Thousand different kind of <HI>Hieroglyhic Figures,</HI> some done in <HI>Gold,</HI> some <HI>Red,</HI> some <HI>Blew,</HI> some <HI>Green,</HI> and others <HI>Black, in short</HI> of every <HI>Form</HI> and <HI>Colour</HI>; thence a Man may reasonably claim the Liberty to guess, he could distinguish many things, relating to the <HI>Age, Death, Quality, Life, Vertues,</HI> and <HI>Profession</HI> of the Person, to whose Breast they are Affix'd.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>for Example,</HI> on the Bosom of one <HI>Mummy, whole</HI> and <HI>Fair</HI> in every there, there lay a <HI>Roll,</HI> whereon in Lines of <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Azure,</HI> we distinguish'd plainly among many more the following <HI>Fi∣gures.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Emblem of crafty Treason.</NOTE><HI>BƲT on the other side the Rock,</HI> behind the Monarch's Back, appear'd a brisk and fiery <HI>Youth,</HI> who, having mounted by the help of a <HI>tall Ladder,</HI> was just steping, from its <HI>topmost Round</HI> upon the <HI>Rock it self,</HI> with seeming resolution to attack and kill the <HI>King,</HI> with a long Spear, presented at him, was witheld from his Intent by means of a <HI>large Chain,</HI> descending from a <HI>Cloud</HI> above his Head, and twining suddenly about his Arms, while <HI>he himself</HI> was wounded in the Bosom by a Sword, directed by a Hand, which issued likewise from the <HI>Cloud</HI> abovenam'd.</P>
<P>NOW in my Imagination, <HI>'tis a Task of no great difficulty,</HI> to unfold the Mystery, contain'd in this intelligible <HI>Hieroglyphic</HI>; perhaps I am mistaken, but as probably am not; however, right, or wrong, I'll give the Reader my <HI>Opinion,</HI> let him judge, as he thinks proper.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The meaning of the Hiero∣glyphic.</NOTE>THE <HI>Monarch,</HI> represented in his <HI>Regal Ornaments</HI> I take, to mean a <HI>King,</HI> who Rules with <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Power:</HI> The <HI>Sword</HI> denotes the Justice of his <HI>Office:</HI> The <HI>disdainful Look</HI> implies a scorn of <HI>Treason,</HI> and its <HI>Pra∣ctisers.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Rock,</HI> whereon he sits enthron'd, was doubtless meant, to signi∣fy his <HI>Governments Solidity; its craggy Roughness</HI> was design'd to show, what dangerous Precipices, we are led to by Ambition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Emblem of Open Rebel∣lion.</NOTE>THE <HI>Rash, arm'd Multitude,</HI> who strive <HI>in vain,</HI> before the Face of the above-nam'd <HI>Monarch,</HI> to ascend and wound him, are as <HI>Emblems</HI> of of those daring and imprudent <HI>Rebels,</HI> who will openly presume to carry on their Hate to <HI>just Authority,</HI> and prosecute the Dictates of their Impious Wishes in the <HI>Face</HI> of <HI>Majesty.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR <HI>numerous Repulses,</HI> and the <HI>fruitless Efforts</HI> of their eager Ap∣plication serve to <HI>shew,</HI> how much it is impossible, by open Practices of <HI>Lawless Villany,</HI> to <HI>shock</HI> the Throne of an <HI>establish'd Government,</HI> or succeed in the Endeavours of a <HI>treacherous Inclination.</HI></P>
<P>THE siery Youth, just mounting from a Ladder to the <HI>summit</HI> of the <HI>Rock</HI> behind the <HI>King,</HI> and holding up a <HI>Spear,</HI> as if with design to <HI>kill</HI> him, signifies in my Opinion, that more crafty kind of <HI>Treason,</HI> carried on by un∣derhand Intrigues and subtle Secrecy, and powerfully assisted by <HI>prevailing Parties.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Emblem of Heaven's Justice.</NOTE>THE <HI>descending Cloud,</HI> from which appears the <HI>Chain,</HI> that binds him, and the <HI>Hand,</HI> which wounds his Bosome with a <HI>Spear,</HI> was meant by the <HI>Egyptians of Antiquity</HI> to represent <HI>that Great,</HI> but <HI>unknown Power,</HI> by whose sure, tho' secret means of Justice, they perceiv'd the sacred Persons of <HI>Just Monarchs,</HI> safely guarded from <HI>designing Treachery,</HI> and very rarely knew a <HI>Villain</HI> Die unpunish'd.</P>
<P>NOW, if the Ingenious Reader will but <HI>put together</HI> these Interpretati∣ons of the <HI>Hieroglyphic Mystery,</HI> he will soon perceive a <HI>nice connexion</HI> of its several Parts, which we may read, as follows.
<Q><P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hiero∣glyphic lite∣rally Inter∣preted.</NOTE>That Prince's Throne, who governs justly, is so strongly seated on the Rock of Power, that he can look with scorn upon the vain Attempts of those Mad Rebells, who, invading his Prerogative with open Vi∣olence, encounter such prodigious and undreamt of Difficulties, that they fall in their Endeavours wretched Victims, to the disappointment of Ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="326"/>
But that more <HI>Crafty, Politic,</HI> and <HI>Private Traitor,</HI> who unge∣nerously aims at a Success in his Rebellion, from the undiscover'd Practices of close Disloyalty, tho' he may prosper for a while in unde∣tected Villanies, is, notwithstanding his great Cautions, watch'd in e∣very Step, he makes, by the <HI>unknown Omniscience</HI> of some Hea∣venly Being, who, when his Plot seems ripe for Execution, chains his Will, o'erthrows his Treason, and amazingly converts his un∣suspecting Malice to his own Destruction.</P></Q></P>

<P>INQUIRING, when we were return'd, if any News had reach'd the City, of the loss of <HI>two Italian Gentlemen,</HI> and hearing nothing of it, we imagin'd it our Duties to acquaint a Person of <HI>that Country,</HI> who resided there <HI>in Public Business,</HI> with the strange Particulars of the above-nam'd <HI>Ac∣cident:</HI> He presently inform'd us, that he knew too well the <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> we spoke of, that they had been recommended to him in their Travells <HI>thither,</HI> and had been forewarn'd, how <HI>dangerous</HI> it was to visit those <HI>remote,</HI> and <HI>dismal Catacombs</HI>; that they refus'd to listen to Perswasion, and had taken a <HI>Guide,</HI> and several <HI>Servants</HI> with them, none of which had <HI>since</HI> been heard of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What became of the dead Bodies of the two <HI>Italian</HI> Gentlemen.</NOTE>IN short, the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> with melancholy Marks of Thanks, rewarded our <HI>Civility,</HI> in giving him this sorrowful Intelligence; he hir'd the <HI>Captain,</HI> who had been our <HI>Convoy,</HI> to remove the Bodies of the <HI>two unhappy Brothers</HI> from the <HI>Catacomb</HI> to <HI>Cairo,</HI> whence he afterwards Embark'd them on a <HI>Vessel,</HI> which was bound for <HI>Europe,</HI> and which brought them soon (<HI>God</HI> knows a <HI>shocking</HI> and <HI>unwelcome Cargo)</HI> to their Country and Relati∣ons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they were betray'd.</NOTE>IT seems their <HI>Guide</HI> (since <HI>taken</HI> and <HI>Impal'd alive</HI> for his abominable Villany) had held a Correspondence with the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and betray'd his <HI>Charge,</HI> by ent'ring with them to the <HI>Catacomb,</HI> and giving them the <HI>Slip</HI> at a convenient Opportunity thro' the other <HI>Hole,</HI> set open purposely; the <HI>Servants,</HI> who remain'd <HI>above,</HI> were siez'd on, and made Prisoners by the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who return'd to Plunder their <HI>dead Masters</HI> at a time, when they un∣happily found <HI>us,</HI> an unexpected Booty in the Gin, they came to.</P>
<P>PROBABLY, the reason of their leaving the <HI>Italian Gentlemen</HI> un∣plunder'd, when they shut them in, was owing to the distant Prospect of some <HI>Turkish Party,</HI> frequently <HI>Patroling,</HI> as I said before, from Place to Place about those <HI>Desarts.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVIII. Of that Part of <HI>Egypt,</HI> formerly <HI>the Land of Goshen,</HI> and of the Passage of <HI>Caravans, thro'</HI> the <HI>Libyan Desarts.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Delta,</HI> why so call'd.</NOTE>AMONGST the many <HI>fertil</HI> Tracts of Land, enriching <HI>Egypt</HI> with an annual Plenty, there is one, call'd <HI>Delta</HI> by the <HI>Ancients,</HI> in regard to the Resemblance, it was thought to bear the <HI>Graecian</HI> Letter of that Name.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Streams of <HI>Nilus.</HI></NOTE>THE River <HI>Nilus,</HI> not above four Miles below <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> is divided into two distinct and navigable <HI>Streams,</HI> one running <HI>Eastward,</HI> and the other towards the <HI>West</HI>; the first emits his Waters into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> not far distant from the <HI>Old Pelusium,</HI> now call'd <HI>Damiata</HI>; and the second loses his swift Channel in the same <HI>Sea,</HI> just below <HI>Rosetta.</HI></P>
<P>THESE two abovenam'd <HI>Channels</HI> form, by their triangular Course, a very rich and spacious <HI>Island,</HI> even the fattest Soil, and most delightful Part of Fruitful <HI>Egypt,</HI> and it is this Portion of the Country, which, as I have said before, was once distinguish'd by the Name of <HI>Delta.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Land of <HI>Goshen.</HI></NOTE>THIS, Tho' many contradict the Notion, I imagine to have been in former Times, the <HI>Land of Goshen,</HI> and am much confirm'd in my Opinion, by the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> undeniable Authority. As, <HI>for Example,</HI> in the tenth Verse of the forty fifth Chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> where <HI>Joseph</HI> tells his <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI>
<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> chap. 45. v 10</NOTE>And thou shalt dwell in the Land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy Children, and thy Childrens Children, and thy Flocks, and thy Herds, and all, that thou hast.</Q></P>
<P>BY the Words <HI>near unto me,</HI> in this Verse, it's evidently <HI>certain,</HI> that we cannot guess with greater probability, than in believing <HI>Delta</HI> to have been the Place, since 'tis the nearest fruitful Spot of Ground to <HI>Memphis,</HI> (then the Residence of <HI>Joseph,</HI>) in the whole <HI>Egyptian</HI> Country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Goshen</HI> prov'd a fruitful Country.</NOTE>AND, that the <HI>Land of Goshen</HI> was not only <HI>near</HI> the <HI>Capital,</HI> but <HI>pre∣ferable</HI> in a thousand other Blessings to the rest of <HI>Egypt,</HI> we may be assur'd by the Authority, I just now quoted, and some other Places.</P>
<P>IN the fourth, fifth, and sixth Verses of the seven and fortieth Chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> we find the Sons of <HI>Jacob</HI> pleading for, and <HI>Pharaoh</HI> granting them the <HI>Land of Goshen</HI> in the following Sentences.
<Q><P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> chap. 4 v. 4, 5, 6.</NOTE>They said moreover unto Pharaoh, for to sojourn in the Land are we come; for thy Servants have no pasture for their Flocks, for the
<PB N="273" REF="329"/>
Famine is sore in the Land of Canaan: Now therefore we pray thee, let thy Sevants dwell in the Land of Goshen.</P>
<P>And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy Father and thy Brethren are come unto thee.</P>
<P>The Land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the Land make thy Father and Brethren to dwell, in the Land of Goshen let them dwell.</P></Q></P>
<P>AGAIN, in the six and fortieth Chapter, <HI>Pharaoh</HI> speaks to <HI>Joseph</HI> in the following manner,
<Q><P>And take your Father, and your Houshold, and come unto me: And I will give you the good of the Land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the Land.</P>
<P>Also regard not your Stuff: For the good of all the Land of Egypt is yours.</P></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Delta,</HI> by the Author, thought to be the Land of <HI>Goshen.</HI></NOTE>BY these abovenam'd Passages of <HI>Holy Writ,</HI> we may without absurdi∣ty conclude, that the triangular Tract of Land, call'd <HI>Delta</HI> by the An∣cients, or at least some part thereof is cettainly the same, which formerly was dwelt in by the <HI>Bondag'd Israelites,</HI> and bore the Appellation of the <HI>Land of Goshen.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The common Notion of it.</NOTE>BUT many are of an Opinion, opposite to this, and judge the <HI>Land of Goshen</HI> to have been that part of <HI>Egypt,</HI> situate betwixt <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> and the <HI>Libyan Desarts.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Why absurd.</NOTE>Not to enter into a Dispute on that account, I only shall beg leave to make one <HI>Observation,</HI> and that is, A Country, so extreamly <HI>Barren,</HI> nor Productive of the smallest Mark of competent <HI>Encrease,</HI> much less of flowing <HI>Plenty,</HI> cannot reasonably be imagin'd reconcilable to the Idea's of <HI>Fertility,</HI> we take from the Accounts, the <HI>Scriptures</HI> give us of the <HI>Land of Goshen.</HI></P>
<P>PROCEED we now from <HI>Egypt</HI> to the <HI>Holy-Land,</HI> to which the common Passage from <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> lies, thro' Part of <HI>Idumaea,</HI> and the dangerous <HI>Desarts</HI> of <HI>Arabia the Stony.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>New Jerusa∣lem,</HI> how Si∣tuated.</NOTE>MODERN <HI>Jerusalem</HI> has Chang'd her Situation, from the very Ground, on which the old one stood; for when she Flourish'd in her An∣cient Grandeur, <HI>Mount Moriah,</HI> and <HI>Mount Sion,</HI> stood directly in the Center of the City, and the <HI>Mount</HI> call'd <HI>Calvary,</HI> the <HI>Place of Crucifixion,</HI> was without the <HI>Northern Gate,</HI> at a considerable distance, but the <HI>New Jerusalem</HI> is built so much more towards the <HI>North,</HI> that <HI>Sion</HI> is with∣out the Wall, upon the <HI>South-side</HI> of the <HI>Modern City,</HI> and <HI>Mount Calva∣ry</HI> now stands almost directly in the <HI>Middle.</HI></P>

<P>SOME broken Remnants of old Buildings, which the <HI>Natives</HI> tell us, were the <HI>Palace of King David, Theatre of Herod,</HI> and the like, serve only to remind a <HI>Traveller,</HI> that <HI>once Jerusalem was,</HI> what she <HI>now is not:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">No <HI>Jews</HI> suf∣fer'd to Inha∣bit <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></NOTE>No <HI>Jews</HI> are suffer'd to Inhabit here, the Town being wholly Peopled by <HI>Zealous Christian Bigotts</HI> of promiscuous Nations, and such <HI>Turks,</HI> as Dwelling there, in hopes to use an Arbitrary Power to the best advantage, are <HI>Subservient</HI> to the Government of a <HI>Sangiack</HI> or <HI>De∣puty Provincial.</HI></P>

<P>THE rest I will proceed to treat of, as distinctly as I can, and first the <HI>Abyssens,</HI> more ancient than their <HI>Fellows</HI> in <HI>Conversion</HI> to the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Wor∣ship</HI> of our <HI>Saviour Christ,</HI> require the Preference.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Man</HI> at forty Days Old, and the <HI>Woman</HI> at threescore they con∣stantly <HI>Baptize,</HI> repeating every Year that <HI>Sacramental Ceremony,</HI> on the <HI>Twelfth Day of Christmas,</HI> in Commemoration only of the Condescention of our <HI>Lord,</HI> who stoop'd that Day to be <HI>Baptiz'd</HI> in <HI>Jordan</HI> by St. <HI>John the Baptist.</HI></P>
<P>CONFESSION, Keeping <HI>Lent,</HI> and Praying for the <HI>Dead,</HI> are Points, wherein they join exactly with the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> as they oppose them rigidly, in not admitting <HI>Images</HI> in <HI>Churches,</HI> or the <HI>Ʋse</HI> of <HI>Crucifixes,</HI> and permitting <HI>Priests</HI> to <HI>Marry freely.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVII. Of the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Red-Sea</HI> is so fully known already, by the <HI>Geographical</HI> De∣scriptions of our own Country Writers, and the exquisite Per∣formances of the <HI>Mathematic</HI> Authors of most <HI>Christian</HI> Nations, that I mean not <HI>here</HI> to Touch on those <HI>notorious</HI> Observa∣tions, which have <HI>long ago</HI> been made by others, but inform my Rea∣der of some <HI>new Discoveries</HI> of little matters, which I made my self.</P>
<P>BUT first, it will be Requisite to say a Word or two, relating to the <HI>Etymology</HI> and <HI>Ports</HI> of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> which having done, I will proceed to mention the Remarks, I made, as they occur to my Remembrance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> is so call'd.</NOTE><HI>RHYTHRA,</HI> in the <HI>old Egyptian Language,</HI> signifying <HI>Red,</HI> was for∣merly the Name of a <HI>great Monarch</HI> of that Country, who gave the <HI>Sea</HI> his own <HI>Denomination,</HI> which has been since mistaken, by affinity of Sound, and <HI>Mis-interpreted</HI> the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> by those, who fix'd the Name upon it, which it bears at present.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Second O∣pinion.</NOTE>OTHERS think, especially the <HI>Jews,</HI> Inhabiting the <HI>Eastern Coun∣tries,</HI> that it was call'd the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> from the prodigious ruin, and great overthrow of <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Army, in their Passage over it, in the <HI>pursuit</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> and his <HI>God-defended Israelites,</HI> but as the Blood, there Spilt, was very little, tho' such <HI>Multitudes</HI> were Drown'd, I look upon this guess, as an Improbable Opinion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Third, and the most pro∣bable.</NOTE>ANOTHER Notion, and perhaps the truest of the Three, is, that 'tis call'd the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> from the <HI>Redness</HI> of the <HI>Sands,</HI> o'erspreading all the Bottom, whence the Waves receive a kind of <HI>red Reflection,</HI> and the <HI>Water</HI> thence appears, as if 'twere stain'd with certain <HI>Juices,</HI> of a <HI>redish Colour</HI>; This is made more Reasonable from the Etymology of the <HI>Euxine,</HI> com∣monly call'd the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> from the <HI>Blackness</HI> of the <HI>Sands,</HI> which lie at the Bottom.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sea Port Towns</HI> are very numerous, and very different from each other, in <HI>Magnificence,</HI> or the <HI>conventency</HI> of <HI>Harbour,</HI> some are much ex∣pos'd to dangerous shelves, and Rocky Shallows, others both commodious, large, and stately, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aden, <HI>the great</HI> Sea-Port Town.</NOTE>but the only Place, deserving a particular Description, is the Port, call'd <HI>Aden,</HI> in Possession of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and not alone the Largest. but the Richest, and most celebrated <HI>Sea Port Town</HI> of all <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Descripti∣on.</NOTE>IT is Situated in about <HI>thirteen Degrees of Northern Latitude,</HI> direct¦ly in the Center of a kind of <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI> or <HI>Semicircular Ridge of Moun∣tains,</HI> jetting out prodigious <HI>Promontories</HI> into the <HI>Sea,</HI> for a considerable Length, on either <HI>Horn</HI>; the <HI>Harbour</HI> is not only safe, but capable of holding at an <HI>Anchor</HI> near a <HI>Thousand Sail of Ships,</HI> by the most modest Computation.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="371"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Town how built.</NOTE>THE Town it self consists of near four thousand Houses, built of Stone, and rendred Pleasant by vast <HI>Spaces,</HI> unemploy'd to other Uses, than the Planting <HI>Orchards, Gardens,</HI> and a kind of <HI>Favorite Wildernesses,</HI> much in Pra∣ctice with the <HI>Eastern People.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>General Inhabitants</HI> of <HI>Aden</HI> are considerably <HI>Wealthy,</HI> and enjoy their Pleasures with a greater Gust, than elsewhere is permitted them; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Now much decay'd.</NOTE>yet is the <HI>City</HI> much decay'd from what it has been formerly, for <HI>once</HI> the <HI>Town</HI> extended to a double Length to that, it <HI>now</HI> contains, and all the Buildings (tho' they are not despicable <HI>now)</HI> were <HI>anciently</HI> adorn'd with a far grea∣ter <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Magnificence.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fleets of the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI></NOTE>THE <HI>Turks</HI> build Vessels in the <HI>Ports,</HI> belonging to <HI>this Sea,</HI> and con∣stantly maintain a Fleet of Gallies, for support of their <HI>Authority,</HI> besides the <HI>Merchant Ships,</HI> which <HI>Trade</HI> about from Place to Place, and by the <HI>Customs,</HI> paid on the <HI>Commodities,</HI> they carry, bring considerable Profit to the Coffers of the <HI>Sultan.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Dis∣covery of a Monument, near the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI></NOTE>UPON the <HI>Northern Shore</HI> of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> not far from a small Haven now call'd <HI>Pozi,</HI> stand the <HI>Ruins</HI> of a <HI>Monumental Heap of Stones,</HI> appearing very ancient, by their Forms and way of Building: By the Remnant of the <HI>Work,</HI> we may suppose it to have been Erected <HI>Pyramidically,</HI> and about one hundred Foot in height, the breadth of each square of its <HI>Basis</HI> much the same; upon the <HI>bottom Stones,</HI> and certain <HI>fallen</HI> ones, we cou'd discover unintelligible <HI>Characters,</HI> which seem'd to have been <HI>Carv'd</HI> to tell succeeding <HI>Ages,</HI> what the <HI>Monument</HI> was there <HI>Erected</HI> to perpetuate the Memory of.</P>
<P>'TIS pity, <HI>Ignorance</HI> has incapacitated the Inhabitants from letting Strangers into any <HI>Light of Knowledge,</HI> in relation to <HI>Antiquity,</HI> else probably they had been able to inform us, what this <HI>Heap</HI> of <HI>Ruins</HI> was <HI>Originally</HI>; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thought to be the same, which <HI>Moses</HI> left in Memo∣ry of his Passage.</NOTE>Now we can no more than guess at random for its doubtful <HI>Origin,</HI> unless we will believe the <HI>not impossible</HI> Traditional Account, the <HI>Natives</HI> give us, who wou'd fain perswade us to believe, 'twas built by <HI>Moses,</HI> when the <HI>Israelites</HI> miraculously pass'd that <HI>Sea,</HI> and left by him, a <HI>Memorandum</HI> for <HI>Posterity,</HI> to make <HI>Mankind</HI> depend on <HI>God,</HI> and not diffide in his <HI>secure Pro∣tection,</HI> tho' reduc'd to never so fatiguing, and oppressive <HI>Exigencies.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Opium</HI> made of <HI>Poppies.</HI></NOTE>THERE grows upon the Shores of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> a certain heavy-headed <HI>Poppy,</HI> only differing, in the bigness of its <HI>Stalk,</HI> from ours in <HI>England:</HI> At a certain Season of the Year, I think it is <HI>July</HI> or <HI>June,</HI> they gather many of these <HI>Poppies,</HI> beat 'em in a <HI>Mortar,</HI> lay them by for many Days, then take 'em out, and adding several unknown Herbs, make <HI>Opium</HI> of the Composi∣tion, but of far less Efficacy than the other sort, more frequently <HI>Exported</HI> into Foreign Countries.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pearls found in the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI></NOTE>MIGHTY <HI>Rocks</HI> in many Parts of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> erect their Heads a∣bove the Water, and it is not seldom, that they find upon them something like a <HI>Shell-Fish,</HI> yet unlike an <HI>Oyster,</HI> which is open'd with the greatest Diffi∣culty imaginable, and contains within it, great round <HI>Pearls,</HI> sometimes but <HI>one,</HI> and sometimes <HI>more,</HI> of equal Value with the richest of their <HI>Magni∣tude,</HI> from any <HI>other</HI> Part, imported into <HI>Christendom.</HI></P>

<P>I Wou'd not have my Reader led to a Mistake of what I mean, or by the <HI>Title</HI> of this Chapter, be induc'd to think, I flatter my <HI>Belief</HI> with an Opinion, that I can inform the World more largely, than all other <HI>Writers,</HI> of the Present State of the <HI>Ten Captiv'd Tribes</HI> of <HI>Broken Israel.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Aim of this Chapter.</NOTE>MY <HI>only Aim,</HI> in touching on this <HI>Subject,</HI> is, to prove, that those, who guess the <HI>Race</HI> of <HI>Turks</HI> to be Descended from the <HI>Jews</HI> of the <HI>Ten Tribes</HI> a∣bovenam'd, may <HI>at least</HI> defend their Notion, by a very <HI>probable,</HI> and <HI>natural Chain</HI> of <HI>Arguments,</HI> if not <HI>incontrovertible,</HI> and <HI>certain Demonstration.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Many various Opinions.</NOTE>MANY <HI>notwithstanding,</HI> and extreamly <HI>various,</HI> are the odd <HI>Opinions,</HI> commonly receiv'd, not only in the <HI>Europaean World,</HI> but <HI>even</HI> in those <HI>Eastern Parts,</HI> which, by their <HI>Old Vicinity</HI> of <HI>Situation</HI> to that <HI>Bondag'd Peo∣ple,</HI> may be thought to have retain'd an eager <HI>Curiosity</HI> to know, <HI>if possible,</HI> the Present Fortunes of a <HI>Formidable Nation,</HI> which in ancient Times, they not alone <HI>Esteem'd,</HI> but held <HI>uninterrupted</HI> Correspondence with.</P>
<P>AMONG the several <HI>Judgments,</HI> or <HI>Conjectures,</HI> made upon this <HI>Fa∣mous Head,</HI> it may not, possibly, be thought <HI>unwelcome,</HI> shou'd I <HI>entertain</HI> the Reader with a <HI>Few</HI> of the most <HI>Celebrated Notions,</HI> prevalent in the <HI>Opinions</HI> of the <HI>Knowing Ʋniverse.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first No∣tion.</NOTE>ONE <HI>commonly receiv'd Opinion</HI> is, that these <HI>Ten Tribes</HI> of <HI>Captiv'd Jews</HI> went quite thro' <HI>Tartary</HI> to <HI>Green-Land,</HI> so to <HI>America,</HI> by passing by the <HI>Straight</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> where they fix'd themselves in the Dominions of <HI>Peru,</HI> and all those Parts, distinguish'd by the Name of <HI>Nova Hispania,</HI> or the <HI>Spanish West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Proofs.</NOTE>TO prove the Probability of this <HI>Assertion,</HI> its <HI>Defenders</HI> openly <HI>avouch,</HI> that there are many <HI>Ruins,</HI> extant to this Day, whose own <HI>Remains,</HI> and the <HI>Tradition</HI> of the <HI>Country,</HI> join to speak them <HI>formerly</HI> the Work of <HI>Jewish Ar∣chitects</HI>; In many of these <HI>Buildings</HI> they report to have discover'd Well-Wrought Nails, of mighty Size, which kept the <HI>Timber</HI> join'd together; this was judg'd <HI>Remarkable,</HI> because those <HI>Buildings</HI> were Erected, <HI>long</HI> before the <HI>Indian Natives</HI> are suppos'd to have been made <HI>acquainted with</HI> the <HI>Ʋse</HI> of <HI>Iron.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="385"/>
AGAIN, they judge it very Probable, because the <HI>Spanish Indians</HI> are not, of so Brown and Beardless a <HI>Complexion,</HI> as the rest, but much inclining to the <HI>Airs,</HI> and <HI>Features</HI> of the <HI>Ancient Jews,</HI> and thence believ'd to be de∣cended from them.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Reason, they produce, as a Persuasive to their <HI>Notion,</HI> is, that, when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Conquer'd <HI>Mexico, Peru,</HI> and all those Parts of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> they perceiv'd their <HI>Customs,</HI> as to <HI>Women, Altars, Jubilees, Divorces,</HI> and the Knowledge, they profess'd of the <HI>Creation of the World,</HI> and <HI>Ʋniversal Deluge,</HI> with a Thousand other of their <HI>Practices,</HI> and <HI>Ceremo∣nies,</HI> so entirely moulded to the Imitation of the <HI>Jewish Customs,</HI> that they cou'd not help concluding, that great Numbers of the <HI>Indians</HI> were them∣selves Descended from those <HI>Jews,</HI> of the <HI>Ten Tribes</HI> aforesaid, or at least had learnt from them the Numerous <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> they so long continued to in∣dulge the Practice of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Second Notion of the Ten Tribes of <HI>Israel.</HI></NOTE>ANOTHER Notion, not alone receiv'd among the <HI>Jews,</HI> but almost <HI>every Nation</HI> in the <HI>East,</HI> perswades them to believe, that many of those <HI>Tribes</HI> may now be found in certain <HI>Inland</HI> Parts of <HI>China</HI>; and, to prove the Probability of this <HI>Opinion,</HI> they produce a Thousand Instances of <HI>Roman Missionary Priests,</HI> and many other Travellers, who have discover'd mighty Numbers of those People, in the <HI>Land</HI> above-nam'd, who retain the Practice of the <HI>Ancient Jewish Ceremonies,</HI> but are altogether ignorant of either the <HI>Arrival, Doctrine,</HI> or <HI>Portentous Crucifixion</HI> of <HI>our Blessed Sa∣viour.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Third Notion.</NOTE>'TIS no improbable <HI>Conjecture,</HI> that some <HI>Tribes</HI> (if not all) inhabit in a Country, to the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Persia,</HI> commonly distinguish'd by the Name of <HI>Tabor</HI>; for the People <HI>there,</HI> obey one <HI>Great,</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary</HI> Monarch, and profess no other <HI>Faith</HI> than that of <HI>Judaism.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sixth Opinion.</NOTE>Mr. <HI>William Pen,</HI> in the Account, he gives of <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> tells us, he believes the Natives of that Place had no <HI>Original,</HI> but from the <HI>Jewish Tribes,</HI> and arms the Arguments, he uses on this Subject, with the following Observations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Reasons.</NOTE>THAT <HI>God</HI> cou'd point them out with ease a Passage to <HI>America,</HI> from the <HI>Eastern</HI> Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> and that, since they were Ordain'd to be remov'd to an <HI>Ʋntill'd,</HI> even <HI>Ʋndiscover'd Country,</HI> 'tis highly probable, that the <HI>West-Indies</HI> was the Place, since that was <HI>then</HI> the only unknown <HI>Quarter</HI> of the <HI>Habitable Ʋniverse.</HI></P>
<P>AND that they rather Peopled <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> than the other Parts of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> he imagines not unlikely, since the Natives of that Country so resemble <HI>Jews,</HI> in Features and Deportment, that they seem distinguishably Mark'd by <HI>God,</HI> as the Posterity of that Unhappy Nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jewish</HI> Cu∣stoms in <HI>Pen∣silvania.</HI></NOTE>AGAIN, their <HI>Feasts, Fasts, Sacrifices,</HI> and all other Rights, and Cere∣monies, with the great Affinity, their Language bears to <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and a∣bundance more concurring <HI>Circumstances</HI> in their ways of Life, agree so evidently with the <HI>Jewish Institutions, Government,</HI> and <HI>Customs,</HI> that he judges it a very reasonable <HI>Notion,</HI> to conclude they are descended from the <HI>long Lost Race</HI> of the <HI>Subverted Israelites.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Seventh Opinion.</NOTE>BUT having mention'd the <HI>foregoing</HI> Notions, <HI>now</HI> most common in the <HI>Eastern World,</HI> I will proceed to let you see, how probable it is, that all the <HI>Turks</HI> are of the <HI>Jewish Race,</HI> and that the Ten above-nam'd <HI>Tribes,</HI> at least the greatest Remnant of them, <HI>now</HI> reside in <HI>Tartary,</HI> and are the People so Notorious for their <HI>Inhumanity,</HI> so Formidable in their <HI>Government,</HI> Un∣known in their <HI>Condition,</HI> and so justly Dreaded by the <HI>oft Invaded World,</HI> who only know them by the Name of <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> De∣scended from the <HI>Jews.</HI></NOTE>I show'd the Reader in my Entrance on the Book, that <HI>Anciently</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> were an <HI>huge Body</HI> of <HI>Ʋngovernable Wandring Scythians,</HI> or <HI>Tartars,</HI> who forsook their Country for some unknown Cause, and over-running <HI>Turco∣mania,</HI> and a Boundless Tract of Fertile <HI>Land,</HI> became a People, formidably Numerous, and swell'd in time to that surprizing Pitch of <HI>Arbitrary Sway,</HI> they boast at present.</P>
<P>IT hence appears 'tis Universally allow'd, as an <HI>Ʋndoubted Certainty,</HI> that 'tis from <HI>Tartary</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> first took their <HI>Origin</HI>; It only then remains to prove, that those, we now call <HI>Tartars,</HI> may be rationally thought the True Posterity of the <HI>Ten Tribes</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> which the Conquering <HI>Salmane∣cer</HI> carried with him Captive, as aforesaid, which I shall endeavour to per∣form, as Briefly as is possible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Etymo∣logy of the word <HI>Tartar.</HI></NOTE>AND <HI>first,</HI> the Reader may observe, that <HI>Tarut-Har,</HI> or <HI>Tartar,</HI> in the <HI>Syrian</HI> Language, signifies the <HI>Remnant,</HI> or <HI>Remainder</HI> of a <HI>People,</HI> which tho' alone an Argument, of no small <HI>weight,</HI> is strongly aided by the following <HI>Particulars.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="387"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A very proba∣ble Argu∣ment.</NOTE><HI>MEDIA,</HI> Situated near the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> is <HI>now</HI> possess'd entirely by these <HI>Tartars,</HI> and as it appears by the abovenam'd <HI>Text</HI> of <HI>Holy Writ,</HI> that the <HI>Ten Tribes of Israel</HI> were Transported to the Cities of the <HI>Medes,</HI> so 'tis observable, that those <HI>few</HI> Cities, which the <HI>Tartars</HI> have, are call'd by <HI>Names,</HI> agreeing nearly with the <HI>Ancient Towns</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> when She <HI>Flou∣rish'd.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ancient Jew∣ish Names still retain'd.</NOTE>THUS, the Capital of <HI>Tartary</HI> is call'd <HI>Samar-yan,</HI> which is very little different from <HI>Samaria, once</HI> the Great <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI>'s <HI>Monarchs,</HI> and it is observable, that many <HI>Pillars, Buildings,</HI> and vast <HI>Reliques</HI> of <HI>Antiquity</HI> are yet remaining in this Town, adorn'd in so demonstrative a manner, that they plainly speak themselves, to have been <HI>Jewish Monuments.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A River call'd <HI>Jordan.</HI></NOTE>THEY have another <HI>Town,</HI> call'd <HI>Jericho,</HI> a <HI>Mount,</HI> nam'd <HI>Sion,</HI> and a∣nother <HI>Mount,</HI> distinguish'd by the <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>Tabor,</HI> with a River <HI>Yordan, (from the Hebrew Jordan</HI>) and a thousand other Names of Places, plainly prove a <HI>Jewish Etymology.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tartars</HI> divided into Ten Tribes.</NOTE>THEY are divided into <HI>Ten Great Tribes,</HI> or <HI>Parties,</HI> bearing <HI>Names,</HI> not much unlike the <HI>Ancient Patriarchs,</HI> from whom the <HI>Israelites</HI> receiv'd their <HI>Appellations:</HI> All these <HI>Tribes,</HI> tho' wholly <HI>Subject</HI> to one <HI>Common</HI> Go∣vernment, avoid confounding <HI>Kindred</HI> by a <HI>Marriage</HI> into one anothers <HI>Fa∣milies,</HI> a <HI>Nicety,</HI> which never was observ'd, but by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>now</HI> these <HI>Tartars, thence</HI> with Probability suppo'd their <HI>Off-spring.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Language of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></NOTE>THE Language of the <HI>Tartars</HI> is so very reconcilable to <HI>Hebrew,</HI> that the Difference there is between them, may be very well accounted for, when we consider they were mix'd <HI>so long</HI> with their Rough Conquerors, the <HI>Syrians,</HI> e're they found a Possibility to make a <HI>General Revolt,</HI> and the pro∣digious Ignorance, and strange Barbarity a Nation, for so many Ages, void of <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> or the Improvements of Humanity, by <HI>Trade</HI> or <HI>Conver∣sation</HI> with a more Polite, and Knowing People, must <HI>of Course</HI> degenerate to.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tradition of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></NOTE>ANOTHER Thing, which serves to prove the just <HI>Validity</HI> of this <HI>Opinion</HI> is, that all the <HI>Tartars</HI> do not only <HI>Circumcise,</HI> and <HI>Ʋse</HI> the ancient <HI>Jewish Rights,</HI> in almost every Point of <HI>Worship,</HI> but Traditionally boast themselves, to be Descended from those <HI>Israelites,</HI> who Conquering <HI>their</HI> Conquerors, became Possess'd of all the <HI>Territories</HI> by the <HI>Caspian Sea</HI>; and <HI>hence</HI> it was, that <HI>Tamerlain,</HI> or rather <HI>Tam-her-lane the Great,</HI> who led the <HI>Turkish Bajazet</HI> about his City, in an <HI>Iron Cage,</HI> wou'd often take occasion to be <HI>Vaunting</HI> of his <HI>Pedigree,</HI> affirming, he was <HI>Lineally</HI> De∣scended from the <HI>Tribe</HI> of <HI>Dan,</HI> in an uninterrupted <HI>Genealogy.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Design of this Chap∣ter.</NOTE>THE Generous Reader will, I doubt not, put a <HI>right</HI> Interpreta∣tion on my <HI>Meaning,</HI> in pretending to instruct the <HI>World,</HI> when <HI>I my self,</HI> as much as <HI>other People,</HI> want Instruction; All I aim at by the Subject, I am now about to take upon me, is to lay down <HI>Rules,</HI> which I have prov'd by <HI>oft Repeated,</HI> tho' but <HI>young</HI> Experience, to be safe and necessary, to the Practice of that <HI>Traveller,</HI> who wou'd to <HI>any Pur∣pose,</HI>spend his Time in Foreign Countries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Education of Youth, the Glory of a Nation.</NOTE>THE Infinite <HI>Advantages,</HI> the <HI>Honour, Glory, Riches,</HI> and <HI>Prosperity,</HI> accruing to a Nation, by the careful Training up the <HI>Youth,</HI> she shines with, and the great Necessity of <HI>sowing</HI> wisely all those <HI>Seeds</HI> of <HI>Liberal Education,</HI> which they hope to see <HI>securely</HI> Flourish in a full <HI>Maturity,</HI> are so Conspicu∣ous to Mankind, and Universally allow'd of, that I need enlarge no more, on so <HI>Incontrovertible</HI> an Argument.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Advan∣tages of Travel.</NOTE>IF then the Care of <HI>Youth</HI> be commonly allow'd a <HI>Duty,</HI> weightily In∣cumbent on a <HI>Common Wealth,</HI> 'twill easily appear a certain Truth, both from the Practice of the Ancient, and the Modern <HI>Times,</HI> that sending them to Travel into Foreign Parts, has ever been esteem'd, and doubtless is the greatest <HI>Blessing,</HI> and most sure <HI>Improvement,</HI> we can lead their Minds to, since they Learn thereby to study <HI>Men,</HI> instead of <HI>Books,</HI> and by a Free and Generous Conversation with the <HI>open World,</HI> not only shake off their Do∣mestick Dregs of <HI>Bashfulness,</HI> and <HI>Ignorance,</HI> but wholesomely digesting the Remembred Dictates of their <HI>late Minority,</HI> become <HI>Polite</HI> in the Deport∣ment of their <HI>Persons,</HI> and Refin'd extreamly, in the Notions of their <HI>Judg∣ment.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Folly of neglecting it.</NOTE>HENCE it follows that, as 'tis undoubtedly the greatest <HI>Policy,</HI> as well as <HI>Honour</HI> of a Prudent People, to encourage <HI>Youth</HI> to <HI>Early Travel,</HI> 'tis an unhappy <HI>Flaw</HI> in any Nations <HI>Character,</HI> to have it said, they stand <HI>Insensible</HI> of <HI>Evident Advantages,</HI> and rather <HI>stifle</HI> than <HI>promote</HI> a Practice, so Commendable.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">At what Age Young Men shou'd Travel.</NOTE>I am not for the speedy sending <HI>Youth</HI> abroad, before their <HI>Judgment</HI> is <HI>Mature</HI> enough, to give them a distinguishing <HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Ʋse,</HI> as well as <HI>Prospect</HI> of the Things, they meet with; Eighteen Years of <HI>Age</HI> is more too <HI>Early</HI> than too <HI>Late,</HI> for a <HI>Young Man</HI> to think of leaving <HI>England:</HI> This I know by <HI>Personal Experience,</HI> having been beholding to my <HI>Latter Travels,</HI> for a Full <HI>Digestion,</HI> and <HI>Improvement</HI> of the Unripe <HI>Observations,</HI> vainly ga∣ther'd in my <HI>Former.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Error common in the <HI>English</HI> Practice.</NOTE>IT is a Fault, <HI>too Common</HI> in our <HI>Modern Practice,</HI> to send <HI>Young Men</HI> Abroad, to see the Rarities of <HI>Italy,</HI> and <HI>other Countries,</HI> before they are at all acquainted with <HI>Domestick Curiosities,</HI> and Things as well deserving Obser∣vation, in the <HI>Heart</HI> of <HI>our own Kingdom,</HI> as he possibly can meet with, in the <HI>Places,</HI> he must Travel thro'.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Follies.</NOTE>BESIDES, it is a kind of unaccountable <HI>Simplicity,</HI> to think a Man is <HI>Qualified</HI> for <HI>Conversation</HI> in a Foreign Land, before he Understands, or has the smallest <HI>Notion</HI> of the <HI>Government,</HI> or any <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Whole Constitution,</HI> or <HI>Condition</HI> of his Native Country: For <HI>such</HI> an Ignorance must necessarily render him unfit for an <HI>Inquisitive,</HI> or <HI>Learn'd</HI> Society in any Place, he comes to, and consequently <HI>hinder</HI> him of all <HI>Advantages,</HI> he might have <HI>Reap'd</HI> from the <HI>Improvements</HI> of his <HI>Journey.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Error.</NOTE>ANOTHER <HI>Error,</HI> and no <HI>small one,</HI> is that most <HI>Young Men</HI> are sent <HI>Abroad,</HI> entirely Ignorant of <HI>German, Dutch, Italian,</HI> and too often <HI>French,</HI> or any <HI>Foreign Languages:</HI> This renders them <HI>depriv'd</HI> of even a <HI>Possibility</HI> of <HI>Living,</HI> as they <HI>ought,</HI> in <HI>Friendship</HI> and <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with their <HI>Equals</HI> or <HI>Superiors,</HI> where they come; for 'tis but seldom any <HI>Tongue</HI> but <HI>French,</HI> is thought worth bringing <HI>Home,</HI> or if some <HI>Few</HI> have <HI>Souls,</HI> and <HI>Memory</HI> enough to Compass more, by that time, they have learn'd to speak them tolerably, the short <HI>Space,</HI> allotted for their <HI>Absence,</HI> is expir'd, and they must return, to put an End to their <HI>Vain Journey,</HI> just as they are grown <HI>Capacitated</HI> to improve themselves by its <HI>Advantages.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="334" REF="390"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proper to be Reform'd.</NOTE>THIS I think an <HI>Error,</HI> that shou'd be Reform'd for many <HI>Reasons</HI>; If the <HI>Tutor</HI> be a <HI>Foreigner,</HI> I need not Nominate the many Disadvantages, the <HI>Pupil</HI> must be Subject to; and if an <HI>Englishman,</HI> of such <HI>Superior Age,</HI> as commonly they are, I humbly ask my Reader's leave, to say <HI>a Word or two</HI> on that Occasion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reasons for Reforming it.</NOTE>YOUNG MEN are naturally Prepossess'd with a Dislike, or Timo∣rous Apprehension of <HI>such Men,</HI> as are appointed for their <HI>Governors</HI>: They are their second <HI>Schoolmasters,</HI> and consequently look'd upon, as <HI>Objects</HI> of their <HI>Spleen</HI>; They are imagin'd <HI>Spies</HI> o'er all their <HI>Actions,</HI> and <HI>Informers</HI> of their <HI>Juvenile Extravagancies</HI>: Their <HI>Best</HI> Advice is <HI>Coldly</HI> list'ned to, for want of an <HI>Affection,</HI> and their <HI>Precepts rob'd</HI> of proper <HI>Force,</HI> because not back'd by <HI>Open Familiarity.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">More Reasons.</NOTE>AGAIN, 'tis natural for <HI>Young Men</HI> to reflect, <HI>What is this Man, who Curbs our Inclinations? Why a Tutor, that is, one, whose Business is to call those Pleasures Faults, which he has now, perhaps, outliv'd the Tast of; He forgets the Inclinations of his Youth, and wou'd oblige us to a Life, as Melancholy as his own, in spite of all the Disproportion, that appears betwixt our Ages.</HI> But were any of the <HI>Arguments,</HI> he <HI>us'd,</HI> made strong by both the <HI>Precept,</HI> and <HI>Example</HI> of some <HI>Wise Companion,</HI> not much Older than <HI>Himself,</HI> they wou'd undoubted∣ly prevail on his <HI>Belief,</HI> because he cannot look upon them the <HI>Effects</HI> of Pee∣vish Age, or Want of Relish, but occasion'd <HI>purely,</HI> by a Wise Restraint of Headstrong <HI>Passions,</HI> and a Swing of <HI>Vanity.</HI></P>
<P>AS I have Censur'd those Three <HI>Common Errors</HI> in our <HI>Practice,</HI> just afore∣nam'd, so I will, <HI>as Briefly as is Possible,</HI> set down the <HI>Rules,</HI> by which we may with ease avoid their Inconveniencies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the first Error might be mended.</NOTE>AND First, I wou'd advise, that <HI>Children</HI> shou'd be put to <HI>School</HI> so ear∣ly, that they may have gain'd a Competent Increase of <HI>Ʋnderstanding,</HI> in a <HI>Residence</HI> at either of the <HI>Ʋniversities,</HI> by that time, they have reach'd the <HI>Age</HI> of Eighteen Years at farthest.</P>
<P>THEN, it might be Proper that, in some <HI>Relation</HI>'s Care, he might Reside at <HI>London,</HI> one whole Winter, there to Learn the <HI>Fashionable Gayeties,</HI> which recommend a Gentleman for <HI>Breeding</HI> and <HI>Appearance.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A necessary Improvement.</NOTE>IN the <HI>Summer</HI> following, 'twou'd be a great <HI>Improvement</HI> to his <HI>Know∣ledge,</HI> if assisted by the <HI>Recommendatory</HI> Letters of his Friends, to their Ac∣quaintance in the Country, he shou'd undertake a <HI>Journey,</HI> quite thro' <HI>En∣gland, Wales,</HI> and Part of, if not all, <HI>North Britain.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>BUT he shou'd not only <HI>Travel</HI> thro' these <HI>Countries,</HI> but <HI>from Place to Place</HI> be Recommended to the <HI>House,</HI> and <HI>Care,</HI> of some Considerable Man, of <HI>Parts</HI> and <HI>Fortune,</HI> who shou'd not alone contrive to Entertain him <HI>Hospi∣tably,</HI> but be sure to Introduce him to the Knowledge, and Acquaintance of the <HI>Best</HI> and <HI>Wisest Part</HI> of all his <HI>Neighbourhood,</HI> by whose Assistance, and So∣ciety, he might not only be <HI>Diverted</HI> with a Sight of every <HI>Curiosity,</HI> but <HI>Taught</HI> at large the <HI>Charters,</HI> and <HI>Antiquity</HI> of every <HI>Corporation, Privileges, Laws,</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> of each County, <HI>Honour,</HI> and <HI>Descent</HI> of every <HI>Family,</HI> and all Things else, that might be fansy'd requisite to give him an entire <HI>Idea,</HI> of the Nature, and Condition of the <HI>Government,</HI> he is Sub∣ject to.</P>
<P>BY these means he is hardned, for the <HI>Accidental Dangers,</HI> and <HI>Fatigues,</HI> he probably may meet with in his longer <HI>Journey,</HI> and enabled, when he is <HI>Abroad,</HI> to give a <HI>Foreigner</HI> an <HI>Answer</HI> to a <HI>Question,</HI> full as easily, as ask one of him.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Second Er∣ror, how Cu∣rable.</NOTE>SECONDLY, in order to prevent the Inconveniencies, arising from a want of Knowledge, in the <HI>European</HI> Languages, I wou'd advise all Gen∣tlemen, who think of Travelling, to Qualifie themselves for true Improve∣ment, by some few Years <HI>Previous, Interwoven</HI> Application to the Study of the <HI>French, Italian, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>German</HI> Languages, which they may learn with ease at <HI>several times,</HI> by <HI>several Masters,</HI> or by <HI>one,</HI> while at their <HI>Latin</HI> School, or either <HI>Ʋniversity</HI>: Then, having made themselves indifferent <HI>Proficients,</HI> they may in their Six Months Continuance at <HI>London,</HI> after∣wards improve them to a fuller Height, by keeping Company, as much as possible, with <HI>Foreign Gentlemen,</HI> who Travel Yearly into <HI>England,</HI> and wou'd be glad of their Society.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Great Ne∣glect Re∣prov'd.</NOTE>AGAIN, I look upon it, as a mighty <HI>Error</HI> in the <HI>British Travellers,</HI> so strangely to neglect the Knowledge of <HI>Marine</HI> Affairs, unless their <HI>Educati∣on,</HI> or Pursuit of their <HI>Preferment</HI> calls them to their Practice; Nothing cer∣tainly can add a Brighter <HI>Ornament</HI> to any <HI>Englishman</HI>'s Capacity, than to be fully Vers'd, at least, made tolerably Knowing, in the Mysteries of <HI>Na∣vigation,</HI> and the many <HI>useful</HI> Sciences, and <HI>profitable</HI> Observations, which a <HI>few</HI> short Voyages will <HI>gild</HI> his Understanding with Considerable Noti∣ons of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Travelling by Sea Re∣commended.</NOTE>I wou'd therefore willingly advise all <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> who travel, to Embark on Board some Trading <HI>Vessel,</HI> (if in time of Peace) bound up the <HI>Straits</HI> from Port to Port, on either side; or if the speed <HI>one</HI> Vessel makes, may call him from a <HI>Place,</HI> before he has had time to make his <HI>Observations,</HI> he will constantly be <HI>sure</HI> to meet <HI>some Ship,</HI> or <HI>other,</HI> Bound directly to the <HI>Port,</HI> he has a mind to be Transported to, no matter, whether she be <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> or of any other <HI>Christian</HI> Nation, for the more <HI>Variety,</HI> he meets with in his Travels, so much more Extensive will become his <HI>Experience.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Great Ne∣glect.</NOTE>THERE is not a <HI>Neglect,</HI> more Common, nor of a more Fatal Con∣sequence, <HI>now</HI> suffer'd, than the sending <HI>Gentlemen</HI> Abroad, without a fur∣ther Charge of <HI>Letters,</HI> than such only, as are <HI>necessary,</HI> to procure Supplies of <HI>Money,</HI> when their <HI>Exigencies</HI> may require it.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Use of Recommen∣datory Let∣ters.</NOTE>HE ought to carry <HI>Recommendatory Letters</HI> for each <HI>Noted Place,</HI> he thinks of going to; Nor are those <HI>Letters</HI> worthy of <HI>that Name,</HI> which commonly are sent by Merchants, to their Correspondents in a <HI>Foreign Part,</HI> wherein the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> who <HI>bears</HI> them, is, in Fashionable Words of Course, so Coldly Recommended, that a Formal Visit, or a Drunken Entertainment is the most, he meets with, from the <HI>Persons,</HI> he is address'd to.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fault, pe∣culiar to <HI>En∣glish-Men,</HI> Abroad.</NOTE>AND here, I cannot help Complaining of a Fault, peculiar to the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Gentlemen, Abroad, and call'd by <HI>Foreigners,</HI> an <HI>Ʋnbred Pride,</HI> and <HI>Haughtiness</HI> of <HI>Temper,</HI> tho' 'tis rather owing to their want of <HI>Recommenda∣tory Letters,</HI> well Directed.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Best Re∣commendato∣ry Letters.</NOTE>THE only way is, to make Interest with the <HI>Foreign Ministers, Ambas∣sadors,</HI> or <HI>Envoys,</HI> who reside at <HI>London,</HI> and have doubtless, not alone a vast Acquaintance, but considerable Power with the Best, and most Capa∣citated Gentlemen of their own <HI>Country,</HI> and the Tenour of their <HI>Letters</HI> shou'd require their Favour, Friendship, and Good Offices in every kind, to the Young Traveller, who carries them, but more especially <HI>Sollicit</HI> their Assistance, and Directions in the Observations, most deserving a <HI>Remark,</HI> and their Advice, what <HI>Towns</HI> or <HI>Places</HI> in the Country may be worth <HI>Re∣gard,</HI> with the Additional Civility of <HI>Letters</HI> of Recommendation, which may <HI>urge</HI> their Friends in any Parts to do, as <HI>they</HI> have done, by the depar∣ting <HI>Traveller.</HI></P>
