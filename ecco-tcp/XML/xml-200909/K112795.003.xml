<HEAD>TO The Rev. JOSEPH WARTON, D. D. MASTER of WINCHESTER SCHOOL; AND TO The Rev. THOMAS WARTON, B.D. FELLOW of TRINITY COLLEGE, OXFORD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIENDS!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a conversation, some months ago, I happened to mention to you the idea I had long enter∣tained of that celebrated Epistle of Horace, com∣monly distinguished by the title of THE ART OF POETRY. I will not say that you acceded to my opinion; but I flatter myself that I, in some degree interested your curiosity, and engaged your attention: our discourse at least revived an intention I had once formed, of communicating my thoughts on the sub∣ject to the Publick; an intention I had only dropt for want of leisure and inclination to attempt a translation of the Epistle, which I thought necessary to accompany the original, and my remarks on it.
<PB N="iv" REF="11"/>
In the original, Horace assumes the air and style of an affectionate teacher, admonishing and instructing his young friends and pupils: but the following translation, together with the observations annexed, I address to You as my Masters, from whom I look for sound information, a well-grounded confirmation of my hypothesis, or a solution of my doubts, and a correction of my errors.</P>
<P>It is almost needless to observe, that the Epistle in question has very particularly exercised the critical sagacity of the literary world; yet it is remarkable that, amidst the great variety of comments and de∣cisions on the work, it has been almost universally considered, except by one acute and learned writer of this country, as a loose, vague, and desultory com∣position; a mass of shining materials; like pearls unstrung, valuable indeed, but not displayed to ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>Some have contended, with Scaliger at their head, that this pretended <HI>Art of Poetry</HI> is totally void of art; and that the very work, in which the beauty and excellence of <HI>Order</HI> (ORDINIS VIRTUS ET VENUS!) is strongly recommended, is in itself un∣connected, confused, and immethodical. The ad∣vocates
<PB N="v" REF="12"/>
for the writer have in great measure confessed the charge, but pleaded, in excuse and vindication, the familiarity of an Epistle, and even the genius of Poetry, in which the formal divisions of a prosaick treatise on the art would have been insupportable. They have also denied that Horace ever intended such a treatise, or that he ever gave to this Epistle the title of <HI>the Art of Poetry</HI>; on which <HI>title</HI> the at∣tacks of Scaliger, and his followers, are chiefly grounded. The title, however, is confessedly as old as the age of Quintilian; and that the work it∣self has a perpetual reference <HI>to Poets and Poetry,</HI> is as evident, as that it is, from beginning to end, in its manner, style, address, and form, perfectly <HI>Epistolary.</HI></P>
<P>The learned and ingenious Critick distinguished above, an early ornament to letters, and now a worthy dignitary of the church, leaving vain com∣ments, and idle disputes on the <HI>title</HI> of the work, sagaciously directed his researches to scrutinize the work itself; properly endeavouring to trace and in∣vestigate from the composition, the end and design of the writer, and remembering the axiom of the Poet, to whom his friend had been appointed the commentator.</P>
<Q><PB N="vi" REF="13"/>
<L><HI>In every work regard</HI> THE AUTHOR's END!</L>
<L><HI>For none can compass more than they intend.—</HI></L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>With this view of illustrating and explaining Horace's Art of Poetry, this shrewd and able writer, about thirty years ago, republished the original Epistle, giving the text chiefly after Dr. Bentley, subjoining an English Commentary and Notes, and prefixing an Introduction, from which I beg leave to transcribe most part of the three first paragraphs.</P>
<Q><P>It is agreed on all hands, that the antients are our masters in the <HI>art</HI> of composition. Such of their writings, therefore, as deliver instructions for the exercise of this <HI>art,</HI> must be of the highest value. And, if any of them hath acquired a credit, in this respect, superior to the rest, it is, perhaps, the <HI>following work:</HI> which the learned have long since considered as a kind of <HI>summary</HI> of the rules of good writing; to be gotten by heart by every young student; and to whose decisive authority the greatest masters in taste and compo∣sition must finally submit.</P>
<P>But the more unquestioned the credit of this poem is, the more it will concern the publick, that it be justly and accurately understood. The writer of these sheets then believed it might be of
<PB N="vii" REF="14"/>
use, if he took some pains to clear the sense, con∣nect the method, and ascertain the scope and pur∣pose, of this admired Epistle. Others, he knew indeed, and some of the first fame for critical learning, had been before him in his attempt. Yet he did not find himself prevented by their labours; in which, besides innumerable lesser faults, he, more especially, observed two invete∣rate errors, of such a sort, as must needs perplex the genius, and distress the learning, of <HI>any</HI> com∣mentator. The <HI>one</HI> of these respects the SUBJECT; the other, the METHOD of the <HI>Art of Poetry.</HI> It will be necessary to say something upon each.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> at large, is not the <HI>proper</HI> subject of this piece, is so apparent, that it hath not escaped the dullest and least attentive of its Criticks. For, however all the different <HI>kinds</HI> of poetry might appear to enter into it, yet every one saw, that <HI>some</HI> at least were very slightly considered: whence the frequent attempts, the <HI>artes et institutiones poeticae,</HI> of writers, both at home and abroad, to supply its deficiencies. But, though this truth was seen and confessed, it un∣luckily happened, that the sagacity of his nume∣rous Commentators went no further. They still
<PB N="viii" REF="15"/>
considered this famous Epistle as a <HI>collection,</HI> though not a <HI>system,</HI> of criticisms on poetry in ge∣neral; with this concession, however, that the stage had evidently the largest share in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Satyra haec est in sui saeculi poetas, PRAECIPUE vero in Roma∣num Drama. <BIBL>Baxter.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Under the influence of this prejudice, several writers of name took upon them to comment and explain it: and with the success, which was to be ex∣pected from so fatal a mistake on setting out, as the not seeing, <Q REND="inline">'that the proper and sole pur∣pose of the Author, was, not to abridge the Greek Criticks, whom he probably never thought of; nor to amuse himself with composing a short criti∣cal system, for the general use of poets, which every line of it absolutely confutes; but, simply to criticize the ROMAN DRAMA.'</Q> For to this end, not the tenor of the work only, but as will appear, every single precept in it, ultimately re∣fers. The mischiefs of this original error have been long felt. It hath occasioned a constant perplexity in defining the <HI>general</HI> method, and in fixing the import of <HI>particular</HI> rules. Nay, its effects have reached still further. For conceiving, as they did, that the whole had been composed out of the Greek Criticks, the labour and ingenuity
<PB N="ix" REF="16"/>
of its interpreters have been misemployed in picking out authorities, which were not wanted, and in producing, or, more properly, by their studied refinements in <HI>creating,</HI> conformities, which were never designed. Whence it hath come to pass, that, instead of investigating the order of the Poet's own reflexions, and scru∣tinizing the peculiar state of the Roman Stage (the methods, which common sense, and common criticism would prescribe) the world hath been nauseated with insipid lectures on <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Phalereus</HI>; whose solid sense hath been so attenu∣ated and subtilized by the delicate operation of French criticism, as hath even gone some way to∣wards bringing the <HI>art</HI> itself into disrepute.</P>
<P N="2">2. But the wrong explications of this poem have arisen, not from the misconception of the <HI>subject</HI> only, but from an inattention to the METHOD of it. The <HI>latter</HI> was, in part, the ge∣nuine consequence of the <HI>former.</HI> For, not sus∣pecting an unity of design in the subject, its in∣terpreters never looked for, or could never find, a consistency of disposition in the method. And this was indeed the very block upon which HEINSIUS, and, before him, JULIUS SCALIGER,
<PB N="x" REF="17"/>
himself stumbled. These illustrious Criticks, with all the force of genius, which is required to dis∣embarrass an involved subject, and all the aids of learning, that can lend a ray to enlighten a dark one, have, notwithstanding, found themselves utterly unable to unfold the order of this Epistle; insomuch, that SCALIGER <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Praef. in LIB. POET. et l. vi. p. 338.</NOTE> hath boldly pro∣nounced the conduct of it to be <HI>vicious</HI>; and HEIN∣SIUS had no other way to evade the charge, than by recurring to the forced and uncritical expedient of a licentious transposition. The truth is, they were both in one common error, that the Poet's purpose had been to write a criticism of the Art of Poetry at large, and not, as is here shewn, of the Roman Drama in particular.</P></Q>
<P>The remainder of this Introduction, as well as the Commentary and Notes, afford ample proofs of the erudition and ingenuity of the Critick; yet I much doubt, whether he has been able to convince the learned world of the truth of his main proposition, <Q REND="inline">"that it was the proper and sole purpose of the Au∣thor, simply <HI>to criticise the</HI> ROMAN DRAMA."</Q> His Commentary is, it must be owned, extremely seduc∣ing; yet the attentive reader of Horace will perhaps
<PB N="xi" REF="18"/>
often fancy, that he perceives a violence and con∣straint offered to the composition, in order to ac∣commodate it to the system of the Commentator; who, to such a reader, may perhaps seem to mark transitions, and point out connections, as well as to maintain <HI>a method</HI> in the Commentary, which cannot clearly be deduced from the text, to which it refers.</P>
<P>This very ingenious <HI>Commentary</HI> opens as fol∣lows:</P>
<Q><P>The subject of this piece being, as I suppose, <HI>one,</HI> viz. <HI>the state of the Roman Drama,</HI> and com∣mon sense requiring, even in the freest forms of composition, some kind of <HI>method,</HI> the intelligent reader will not be surprized to find the poet prose∣cuting his subject in a regular, well-ordered <HI>plan</HI>; which, for the more exact description of it, I distinguish into three parts:</P>
<P N="1">I. The first of them [from l. 1 to 89] is prepa∣ratory to the main subject of the Epistle, con∣taining some general rules and reflections on poetry, but principally with an eye to the follow∣ing parts: by which means it serves as an useful introduction to the poet's design, and opens with that air of ease and elegance, essential to the epi∣stolary form.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="xii" REF="19"/>II. The main body of the Epistle [from l. 89 to 295] is laid out in regulating the <HI>Roman</HI> stage; but chiefly in giving rules for Tragedy; not only as that was the sublimer species of the <HI>Drama,</HI> but, as it should seem, less cultivated and understood.</P>
<P N="3">III. The last part [from l. 295 to the end] ex∣horts to correctness in writing; yet still with an eye, principally, to the <HI>dramatick species:</HI> and is taken up partly in removing the causes, that pre∣vented it; and partly in directing to the use of such means, as might serve to promote it. Such is the general plan of the Epistle.</P></Q>
<P>In this general summary, with which the Critick introduces his particular Commentary, a very mate∣rial circumstance is acknowledged, which perhaps tends to render the system on which it proceeds, ex∣tremely doubtful, if not wholly untenable. The original Epistle consists of four hundred and seventy-six lines; and it appears, from the above numerical analysis, that not half of those lines, only two hun∣dred and six verses [from v. 89 to 295] are employed on the subject of <HI>the Roman Stage.</HI> The first of the three parts above delineated [from v. 1 to 89] cer∣tainly
<PB N="xiii" REF="20"/>
<HI>contains general rules and restrictions on poetry,</HI> but surely with no particular reference to the Drama. As to the second part, the Critick, I think, might fairly have extended the Poet's consideration of the Drama to the 365th line, seventy lines further than he has carried it: but the last hundred and eleven lines of the Epistle so little allude to the Drama, that the only passage in which a mention of the Stage has been supposed to be implied, [<HI>ludusque repertus, &amp;c.</HI>] is, by the learned and ingenious Critick himself, particularly distinguished with a very different inter∣pretation. Nor can this portion of the Epistle be considered, by the impartial and intelligent reader, as a mere exhortation <Q REND="inline">"to correctness in writing; taken up partly in removing the causes that pre∣vented it; and partly in directing to the use of such means, as might serve to promote it."</Q> <HI>Correctness</HI> is indeed here, as in many other parts of Horace's Satires and Epistles, occasionally inculcated; but surely the main scope of this animated conclusion is to deter those, who are not blest with genius, from attempting the walks of Poetry.</P>
<P>I much approve what this writer has urged on the <HI>unity of subject, and beauty of epistolary method</HI> observed in this Work; but cannot agree that <Q REND="inline">"the main
<PB N="xiv" REF="21"/>
subject and intention was <HI>the regulation of the Roman Stage.</HI>"</Q> How far I may differ concerning particu∣lar passages, will appear from the notes at the end of this translation. In controversial criticism differ∣ence of opinion cannot but be expressed, <HI>(veniam petimusque damusque vicissim,)</HI> but I hope I shall not be thought to have delivered my sentiments with petulance, or be accused of want of respect for a character, that I most sincerely reverence and ad∣mire.</P>
<P>I now proceed to set down in writing, the sub∣stance of what I suggested to you in conversation, concerning my own conceptions of the end and de∣sign of Horace in this Epistle. In this explanation I shall call upon Horace as my chief witness, and the Epistle itself, as my principal voucher. Should their testimonies prove adverse, my system must be aban∣doned, like many that have preceded it, as vain and chimerical: and if it should even, by their support, be acknowledged and received, it will, I think, like the egg of Columbus, appear so plain, easy, and obvious, that it will seem almost wonderful, that the Epistle has never been considered in the same light, till now. I do not wish to dazzle with the lustre of a new hypothesis, which requires, I think,
<PB N="xv" REF="22"/>
neither the strong opticks, nor powerful glasses, of a critical Herschel, to ascertain the truth of it; but is a system, that lies level to common apprehension, and a luminary, discoverable by the naked eye.</P>
<P>My notion is simply this. I conceive that one of the sons of Piso, undoubtedly the Elder, had either written, or meditated, a poetical work, most proba∣bly a Tragedy; and that he had, with the know∣ledge of the family, communicated his piece, or in∣tention, to Horace: but Horace, either disapproving of the work, or doubting of the poetical faculties of the Elder Piso, or both, wished to dissuade him from all thoughts of publication. With this view he formed the design of writing this Epistle, addressing it, with a courtliness and delicacy perfectly agree∣able to his acknowledged character, indifferently to the whole family, the father and his two sons. <HI>Epi∣stola ad Pisones, de Arte Poeticâ.</HI></P>
<P>He begins with general reflections, generally ad∣dressed to his <HI>three</HI> friends. <HI>Credite,</HI> PISONES!—PATER, <HI>&amp;</HI> JUVENES <HI>patre digni!</HI>—In these prelimi∣nary rules, equally necessary to be observed by Poets of every denomination, he dwells on the necessity of unity of design, the danger of being dazzled by the
<PB N="xvi" REF="23"/>
splendor of partial beauties, the choice of subjects, the beauty of order, the elegance and propriety of diction, and the use of a thorough knowledge of the nature of the several different species of Poetry: summing up this introductory portion of his Epistle, in a manner perfectly agreeable to the conclusion of it.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Descriptas servare vices, operumque colores,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cur ego si nequeo ignoroque, poeta salutor?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cur nescire, pudens pravè, quam discere malo?</HI></L></Q>
<P>From this general view of poetry, on the canvas of Aristotle, but entirely after his own manner, the writer proceeds to give the rules and history of the Drama; adverting principally to Tragedy, with all its constituents and appendages of diction, fable, character, incidents, chorus, measure, musick, and decoration. In this part of the work, according to the interpretation of the best Criticks, and indeed (I think) according to the manifest tenor of the Epistle, he addresses himself entirely to <HI>the two young gentlemen,</HI> pointing out to them the difficulty, as well as ex∣cellence, of the Dramatick Art; insisting on the avowed superiority of the Graecian Writers, and ascribing the comparative failure of the Romans to negligence and avarice. The Poet, having
<PB N="xvii" REF="24"/>
exhausted this part of his subject, suddenly drops a <HI>second,</HI> dismissing at once no less than <HI>two</HI> of the <HI>three</HI> Persons, to whom he originally addressed his Epistle, and turning short on <HI>the</HI> ELDER PISO, most earnestly conjures him to ponder on the danger of precipitate publications, and the ridicule to which the author of wretched poetry exposes himself. From the com∣mencement of this partial address, O MAJOR JUVE∣NUM, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> [v. 366] to the end of the poem, <HI>almost a fourth part of the whole,</HI> the second person plural, <HI>Pisones!—Vos!—Vos, O Pompilius Sanguis!</HI> &amp;c. is discarded, and the second person singular, <HI>Tu, Te, Tibi,</HI> &amp;c. invariably takes its place. The argu∣ments too are equally relative and personal; not only shewing the necessity of study, combined with natural genius, to constitute a Poet; but dwelling on the peculiar danger and delusion of flattery, to a writer of rank and fortune; as well as the inestima∣ble value of an honest friend, to rescue him from de∣rision and contempt. The Poet, however, in reve∣rence to the Muse, qualifies his exaggerated description of an infatuated scribbler, with a most noble enco∣mium on the uses of Good Poetry, vindicating the dignity of the Art, and proudly asserting, that the most exalted characters would not be disgraced by the cultivation of it.</P>

<P>It is worthy observation, that in the satyrical picture of a frantick bard, with which Horace con∣cludes his Epistle, he not only runs counter to what might be expected as a Corollary of an Essay on <HI>the Art of Poetry,</HI> but contradicts his own usual practice and sentiments. In his Epistle to Augustus, instead of stigmatizing the love of verse as an abominable phrensy, he calls it <HI>(levis haec insania) a slight mad∣ness,</HI> and descants on its good effects—<HI>quantas</HI> VIR∣TUTES <HI>habeat, sic collige!</HI></P>
<P>In another Epistle, speaking of himself, and his addiction to poetry, he says,
<Q><L><HI>—ubi quid datur oti,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Illudo chartis; hoc est,</HI> MEDIOCRIBUS ILLIS</L>
<L><HI>Ex vitiis unum,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>All which, and several other passages in his works, almost demonstrate that it was not, without a par∣ticular purpose in view, that he dwelt so forcibly on the description of a man resolved
<Q><L><HI>—in spite</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of nature and his stars to write.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="26"/>To conclude, if I have not contemplated my system, till I am become blind to its imperfections, this view of the Epistle not only preserves to it all that <HI>unity of subject, and elegance of method,</HI> so much in∣sisted on by the excellent Critick, to whom I have so often referred; but by adding to his judicious general abstract the familiarities of personal address, so strongly marked by the writer, scarce a line ap∣pears idle or misplaced: while the order and dispo∣sition of the Epistle to the Pisos appears as evident and unembarrassed, as that of the Epistle to Au∣gustus; in which last, the actual state of the Roman Drama seems to have been more manifestly the object of Horace's attention, than in the Work now under consideration.</P>
<P>Before I leave you to the further examination of the original of Horace, and submit to you the Translation, with the Notes that accompany it, I cannot help observing, that the system, which I have here laid down, is not so entirely new, as it may perhaps at first appear to the reader, or as I myself originally supposed it. No Critick indeed has, to my know∣ledge, directly considered <HI>the whole Epistle</HI> in the same light that I have now taken it; but yet <HI>parti∣cular passages</HI> seem so strongly to enforce such an
<PB N="xx" REF="27"/>
interpretation, that the Editors, Translators, and Commentators, have been occasionally driven to ex∣planations of a similar tendency; of which the Notes annexed will exhibit several striking instances.</P>
<P>Of the following version I shall only say, that I have not, knowingly, adopted a single expression, tending to warp the judgement of the learned or un∣learned reader, in favour of my own hypothesis. I attempted this translation, chiefly because I could find no other equally close and literal. Even the Version of Roscommon, though in blank verse, is in some parts a paraphrase, and in others, but an ab∣stract. I have myself, indeed, endeavoured to sup∣port my right to that force and freedom of translation which Horace himself recommends; yet I have faithfully exhibited in our language several passages, which his professed translators have abandoned, as impossible to be given in English.</P>
<P>All I think necessary to be further said on the Epistle, will appear in the Notes.</P>

<HEAD>THE ART of POETRY, an EPISTLE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Q. HORATII FLACCI EPISTOLA AD PISONES.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="title" TYPE="note">
<P>THE work of Horace, now under consideration, has been so long known, and so generally received, by the name of <HI>The Art of Poetry,</HI> that I have, on account of that notoriety, submitted this translation to the Publick, under that title, rather than what I hold to be the true one, <HI>viz. Horace's</HI> EPISTLE TO THE PISOS. The Author of the English Commen∣tary has adopted the same title, though directly re∣pugnant to his own system; and, I suppose, for the very same reason.</P>
<P>The title, in general a matter of indifference, is, in the present instance, of much consequence. On the title Julius Scaliger founded his invidious, and injudicious, attack. <HI>De arte quaeres quid sentiam. Quid? equidem quod</HI> DE ARTE, SINE ARTE <HI>traditâ.</HI> To <HI>ehe Title</HI> all the editors, and commentators, have
<PB N="38" REF="96"/>
particularly adverted; commonly preferring the Epistolary Denomination, but, in contradiction to that preference, almost universally inscribing the Epistle, <HI>the Art of Poetry.</HI> The conduct, however, of JASON DE NORES, a native of Cyprus, a learned and ingenious writer of the 16th century, is very remarkable. In the year 1553 he published at Ve∣nice this work of Horace, accompanied with a com∣mentary and notes, written in elegant Latin, in∣scribing it, after Quintilian, <HI>Q. Horatii Flacci</HI> LIBER DE ARTE POETICA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I think it right to mention that I have never seen the first edition, pub∣lished at Venice. With a copy of the second edition, printed at Paris, I was favoured by Dr. Warton of Winchester.</NOTE>. The very next year, how∣ever, he printed at Paris a second edition, enriching his notes with many observations on Dante and Pe∣trarch, and changing the title, after mature consi∣deration, to <HI>Q. Horatii Flacci</HI> EPISTOLA AD PISONES, <HI>de Arte Poeticâ.</HI> His motives for this change he as∣signs in the following terms.</P>
<Q><HI>Quare adductum me primum sciant</HI> AD INSCRIPTIO∣NEM OPERIS IMMUTANDAM <HI>non levioribus de causis, &amp; quod formam</HI> EPISTOLAE, <HI>non autem</HI> LIBRI, <HI>in quo praecepta tradantur, vel ex ipso principio prae se ferat, &amp; quod in vetustis exemplaribus Epistolarum libros sub∣sequatur,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="97"/>
<HI>&amp; quod etiam summi et praestantissimi homines ita sentiant, &amp; quod minimè nobis obstet Quintiliani testimonium, ut nonnullis videtur. Nam si</HI> LIBRUM <HI>appellat Quintilianus, non est cur non possit inter</HI> EPIS∣TOLAS <HI>enumerari, cum et illae ab Horatio in libros di∣gestae fuerint. Quod vero</HI> DE ARTE POETICA <HI>idem Quintilianus adjungat, nihil commoveor, cùm et in</HI> EPISTOLIS <HI>praecepta de aliquâ re tradi possint, ab eodem∣que in omnibus penè, et in iis ad Scaevam &amp; Lollium praecipuè jam factum videatur, in quibus breviter eos instituit, quâ ratione apud majores facile versarentur</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since writing and first publishing the above, I have seen the <HI>first</HI> Edi∣tion of DE NORES, and find the title of the Epistle to be the same as in his <HI>second</HI>; so that he here refers to his departure from the usage of others, not to any variation from himself.</NOTE>.</Q>
<P>Desprez, the Dauphin Editor, retains both titles, but says, inclining to the Epistolary, <HI>Attamen</HI> ARTEM POETICAM <HI>vix appellem cum Quintiliano et aliis: ma∣lim vero</HI> EPISTOLAM <HI>nuncupare cum nonnullis eruditis.</HI> Monsieur Dacier inscribes it, properly enough, agree∣able to the idea of Porphyry, <HI>Q. Horatii Flacci</HI> DE ARTE POETICA LIBER; <HI>seu,</HI> EPISTOLA AD PI∣SONES, PATREM, ET FILIOS.</P>
<P>Julius Scaliger certainly stands convicted of cri∣tical malice by his poor cavil at <HI>the</HI> SUPPOSED <HI>title</HI>;
<PB N="40" REF="98"/>
and has betrayed his ignorance of the ease and beauty of Epistolary method, as well as the most gross mis∣apprehension, by his ridiculous analysis of the work, resolving it into thirty-six parts. He seems, how∣ever, to have not ill conceived the genius of the poem, in saying that <HI>it relished of</HI> SATIRE. This he has urged in many parts of his Poeticks, parti∣cularly in the Dedicatory Epistle to his son, not omitting, however, his constant charge of <HI>Art with∣out Art. Horatius</HI> ARTEM <HI>cum inscripsit,</HI> ADEO SINE ULLA DOCET ARTE, UT SATYRAE PROPIUS TOTUM OPUS ILLUD ESSE VIDEATUR. This comes almost home to the opinion of the Author of the elegant commentaries on the two Epistles of Horace to the Pisos and to Augustus, as expressed in the Dedica∣cation to the latter: With the recital of that opinion I shall conclude this long note. <Q REND="inline">"The genius of Rome was bold and elevated: but Criticism of any kind, was little cultivated, never professed as an <HI>art,</HI> by this people. The specimens we have of their ability in this way (of which the most elegant, beyond all dispute, are the two epistles to <HI>Augustus</HI> and the <HI>Pisos</HI>) <HI>are slight occasional at∣tempts;</HI> made in the negligence of common sense, <HI>and adapted to the peculiar exigencies of their own taste and learning</HI>; and not by any means the re∣gular
<PB N="41" REF="99"/>
productions of <HI>art,</HI> professedly bending itself to this work, and ambitious to give the last finish∣ing to the critical system."</Q></P>

<P><HI>Translated from Horace.</HI>] In that very entertain∣ing and instructive publication, entitled <HI>An Essay on the Learning and Genius of Pope,</HI> the Critick recom∣mends, as the properest poetical measure to render in English the Satires and Epistles of Horace, that kind of familiar blank verse, used in a version of Terence, attempted some years since by the Author of this translation. I am proud of the compliment; yet I have varied from the mode prescribed: not be∣cause Roscommon has already given such a version; or because I think the satyrical hexameters of Horace less familiar than the irregular Iambicks of Terence. English Blank Verse, like the Iambick of Greece and Rome, is peculiarly adapted to theatrical action and dialogue, as well as to the Epick, and the more elevated Didactick Poetry: but after the models left by DRYDEN and POPE, and in the face of the living example of JOHNSON, who shall venture to reject rhyme in the province of Satire and Epistle?</P>

<P><PB N="42" REF="100"/>Monsieur Dacier, at a very early period, feels the influence of <HI>the personal address,</HI> that governs this Epistle. Remarking on this passage, he observes that Horace, anxious to inspire <HI>the Pisos</HI> with a just taste, says earnestly <HI>Trust me, my Pisos! Credite Pi∣sones!</HI> an expression that betrays fear and distrust, left <HI>the young Men</HI> should fall into the dangerous error of bad poets, and injudicious criticks, who not only thought the want of unity of subject a pardon∣able effect of Genius, but even the mark of a rich and luxuriant imagination. And although this Epistle, continues Monsieur Dacier, is addressed in∣differently to Piso the father, and his Sons, as ap∣pears by v. 24 of the original, yet it is <HI>to the sons in particular</HI> that these precepts are directed; a con∣sideration which reconciles the difference mentioned by Porphyry. <HI>Scribit ad Pisones, viros nobiles di∣sertosque, patrem et filios; vel, ut alii volunt,</HI> AD PISONES FRATRES.</P>
<P>Desprez, the Dauphin Editor, observes also, in the same strain, <HI>Porro scribit Horatius ad patrem et filios Pisones,</HI> PRAESERTIM VERO AD HOS.</P>
<P>The family of <HI>the Pisos,</HI> to whom Horace ad∣dresses this Epistle, were called Calpurnii, being

<P><Q REND="inline">71.—<HI>A cunning phrase.</HI>] <HI>Callida junctura.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Jason de Nores</HI> and many other interpreters agree that Horace here recommends, after Aristotle, the artful elevation of style by the use of common words in an uncommon sense, producing at once an air of familiarity and magnificence. Some however con∣fine the expression, <HI>callida junctura,</HI> to signify <HI>com∣pound words.</HI> The Author of the English Commen∣tary adopts the first construction; but considers the precept in both senses, and illustrates each by many beautiful examples from the plays of Shakespeare. These examples he has accompanied with much ele∣gant and judicious observation, as the reader of
<PB N="48" REF="106"/>
taste will be convinced by the following short ex∣tracts.</P>
<Q>The writers of that time had so <HI>latinized</HI> the English language, that the pure <HI>English Idiom,</HI> which Shakespeare generally follows, has all the air of <HI>novelty,</HI> which other writers are used to affect by foreign phraseology.—In short, the articles here enumerated are but so many ways of departing from the usual and simpler forms of speech, without neglecting too much the grace of ease and perspicuity; in which well-tempered li∣cence one of the greatest charms of all poetry, but especially of Shakespeare's poetry, consists. Not that he was always and every where so happy.

<P>The ingenious author of the English Commen∣tary, to whom I have so often referred, and to whom I must continue to refer, has discovered particular taste, judgement, and address, in his explication of this part of the Epistle. It runs thus.</P>
<Q>From reflections on <HI>poetry, at large,</HI> he pro∣ceeds now to <HI>particulars:</HI> the most obvious of
<PB N="55" REF="113"/>
which being the different <HI>forms</HI> and <HI>measures</HI> of poetick composition, he considers, in this view, [from v. 75 to 86] the four great species of po∣etry, to which all others may be reduced, <HI>the Epick, Elegiack, Dramatick, and Lyrick.</HI> But the distinction of the <HI>measure,</HI> to be observed in the several species is so obvious, that there can scarcely be any mistake about them. The diffi∣culty is to know [from v. 86 to 89] how far each may partake of the <HI>spirit</HI> of the other, without destroying that <HI>natural and necessary difference,</HI> which ought to subsist betwixt them all. To ex∣plain this, which is a point of great nicety, he considers [from v. 89 to 99] the case of Drama∣tick Poetry; the two species of which are as di∣stinct from each other, as any two can be, and yet there are times, when the features of the one will be allowed to resemble those of the other.—But the Poet had a further view in chusing this instance. For he gets by this means into the main of his subject, which was Dramatick Poetry, and, by the most delicate transition imaginable, proceeds [from 89 to 323] to deliver a series of rules, interspersed with historical accounts, <HI>and enlivened by digressions,</HI> for the regulation of the ROMAN STAGE.</Q>
<P><PB N="56" REF="114"/>It is needless to insist, that my hypothesis will not allow me to concur entirely in the latter part of this extract; at least in that latitude, to which the system of the writer carries it: yet I perfectly agree with Mr. Duncombe, that the learned Critick, in his observation on this Epistle, <Q REND="inline">"has shewn in gene∣ral, the connection and dependence of one part with another, in a clearer light than any other Commentator."</Q> His shrewd and delicate commen∣tary is, indeed, a most elegant contrast to the bar∣barous analysis of Scaliger, drawn up without the least idea of poetical transition, and with the uncouth air of a mere dry logician, or dull grammarian. I think, however, the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Method,</HI> observed in this Epistle, is stricter than has yet been observed, and that the <HI>series of rules</HI> is delivered with great re∣gularity; NOT <HI>enlivened by digressions,</HI> but passing from one topick to another, by the most natural and easy transitions. The Author's discrimination of the different stiles of the several species of poetry, leads him, as has been already shewn, to consider THE DICTION of the Drama, and its accommoda∣tion to the <HI>circumstances</HI> and <HI>character</HI> of the Speaker. A recapitulation of these <HI>circumstances</HI> carries him to treat of the due management of <HI>characters already known,</HI> as well as of sustaining those that are entire∣ly
<PB N="57" REF="115"/>
<HI>original</HI>; to the first of which the Poet gives the preference, recommending <HI>known</HI> CHARACTERS, as well as <HI>known</HI> SUBJECTS: And on the mention of this joint preference, the Author leaves further con∣sideration of <HI>the</HI> DICTION, and slides into discourse upon <HI>the</HI> FABLE, which he continues down to the 152d versa.
<Q><L><HI>Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum.</HI></L></Q>
Having dispatched <HI>the</HI> FABLE, the Poet proceeds, and with some Solemnity of Order, to the conside∣ration of <HI>the</HI> CHARACTERS; not in regard to suit∣able <HI>diction,</HI> for of that he has already spoken, but in respect to <HI>the manners</HI>; and, in this branch of his subject, he has as judiciously borrowed from <HI>the Rhe∣toricks</HI> of Aristotle, as in the rest of his Epistle from the <HI>Poeticks.</HI> He then directs, in its due place, the proper conduct of particular INCIDENTS <HI>of the fable</HI>; after which he treats of the CHORUS; from whence he naturally falls into the <HI>history</HI> of theatrical MU∣SICK; which is, as naturally, succeeded by an ac∣count of the Origin of <HI>the Drama</HI> itself, which the Poet commences, like his master Aristotle, even from the Dithyrambick Song, and carries it down
<PB N="58" REF="116"/>
to the establishment of the New Greek Comedy; from whence he passes easily and gracefully, to <HI>the</HI> ROMAN STAGE, acknowledging the merits of the Writers, but pointing out their defects, and assign∣ing the causes. He then subjoins a few general ob∣servations, and concludes his long discourse on <HI>the</HI> DRAMA, having extended it to 275 lines. This discourse, together with the result of all his reflec∣tions on Poets and Poetry, he then applies in the most earnest and <HI>personal</HI> manner to <HI>the</HI> ELDER PISO; and with a long and most pathetick <HI>peroration,</HI> if I may adopt an oratorical term, concludes the Epistle.</P>

of the couplet Monsieur Dacier justly prefers to the two long Alexandrines of his own country, which sets almost all the French poetry, Epick, Dramatick, Elegiack, or Satyrick, to the tune of <HI>Derry Down.</HI> In our language, the measures are more various, and more happily conceived.

<P>The same learned Critick also takes it for granted, that the Tragedy of <HI>Telephus,</HI> and probably of <HI>Pe∣leus,</HI> after mentioned, point at tragedies of Euripi∣des,

<P>It appears from hence, that it was <HI>common</HI> for the writers of that me, as well as Shakespeare's Jaques, to divide the life of man into SEVEN AGES, viz. <HI>In∣fancy, Childhood, Puberty, Youth, Manhood, Old</HI>

<HI>Age,</HI> and <HI>Decrepitude</HI>; <Q REND="inline">"which last, (says De Nores) in some sort answers to Infancy,"</Q> or, as Shakespere expresses it, IS SECOND CHILDISH∣NESS.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Before Shakespeare's time, says Warburton, <HI>seven acts</HI> was no unusual division of a play, so that there is a greater beauty than appears at first sight in this image."</Q> Mr. Steevens, however, informs us that the plays of that early period were not di∣vided into acts at all.

<P>Aristotle considers the powers of the body in a state of advancement till the 35th year, and the fa∣culties of the mind progressively improving till the 49th; from which periods they severally decline.

real life, which every man of sense perceives, and <HI>feels</HI> the want of upon our stage; a want, which nothing but such an expedient as the Chorus can possibly relieve. And, 2. The importance of its other office [l. 196] to the <HI>utility</HI> of the repre∣sentation, is so great, that, in a moral view, no∣thing can compensate for this deficiency. For it is necessary to the truth and decorum of cha∣racters, that the <HI>manners,</HI> bad as well as good, be drawn in strong, vivid colours; and to that end that immoral sentiments, forcibly expressed and speciously maintained, be sometimes <HI>imputed</HI> to the speakers. Hence the sound philosophy of the Chorus will be constantly wanting, to rectify the wrong conclusions of the audience, and pre∣vent the ill impressions that might otherwise be made upon it. Nor let any one say, that the au∣dience is well able to do this for itself: Euripides did not find even an Athenian theatre so quick∣sighted. The story is well known, [Sen. Ep. 115.] that when this painter of the <HI>manners</HI> was obliged, by the rules of his art, and the character to be sustained, to put a run of bold sentiments in the mouth of one of his persons, the people instantly took fire, charging the poet with the <HI>imputed</HI> vil∣lainy, as though it had been his <HI>own.</HI> Now if
<PB N="72" REF="130"/>
such an audience could so easily misinterpret an attention to the truth of character into the real doctrine of the poet, and this too, when a Chorus was at hand to correct and disabuse their judg∣ments, what must be the case, when the <HI>whole</HI> is left to the sagacity and penetration of the people? The wiser sort, it is true, have little need of this information. Yet the reflections of sober sense on the course and occurrences of the representa∣tion, clothed in the noblest dress of poetry, and enforced by the joint powers of <HI>harmony</HI> and <HI>action</HI> (which is the true character of the Chorus) might make it, even to such, a no unpleasant or unpro∣fitable entertainment. But these <HI>two</HI> are a small part of the <HI>uses</HI> of the Chorus; which in every light is seen so important to the truth, decorum, and dignity of the tragick scene, that the <HI>modern</HI> stage, which hath not thought proper to adopt it, is even, with the advantage of, sometimes, the justest moral painting and sublimest imagery, but a very faint shadow of the <HI>old</HI>; as must needs appear to those who have looked into the ancient models, or, divesting themselves of modern pre∣judices, are disposed to consult the dictates of plain sense.

<P>Though it is not my intention to agitate, in this place, the long disputed question concerning the ex∣pediency, or inexpediency, of the CHORUS; yet I cannot dismiss the above note without some farther observation. In the first place then I cannot think that <HI>the judgment of two such Crikicks</HI> as Aristotle and Horace, can be decisively quoted, as <HI>concurring with the practice of wise antiquity,</HI> TO ESTABLISH THE CHORUS. Neither of these <HI>two Criticks</HI> have taken up the question, each of them giving directions for the proper conduct of <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, considered as an established and received part of Tragedy, and indeed
<PB N="74" REF="132"/>
originally, as they both tell us, <HI>the whole</HI> of it, Aristotle, in his Poeticks, has hot said much on the subject; and from the little he has said, more arguments might perhaps be drawn, in favour of the omission, than for the introduction of <HI>the</HI> CHORUS. It is true that he says, in his 4th chapter, that <Q REND="inline">"Tragedy, after many changes, paused, <HI>having</HI> gained its natural form<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q></NOTE>:"</Q> This might, at first sight, seem to include his approbation of <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, as well as of all the other parts of Tragedy then in use: but he himself expressly tells us <HI>in the very same chapter,</HI> that he had no such meaning, saying, that <Q REND="inline">"to enquire whether Tragedy be perfect in its parts, either considered in itself, or with relation to the theatre, was foreign to his present pur∣pose<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q></NOTE>."</Q> In the passage from which Horace has, in the verses now before us, described the office, and laid down the duties of the CHORUS, the passage re∣ferred to by the learned Critick, the words of Ari∣stotle are not particularly favourable to the institution,
<PB N="71" REF="133"/>
or much calculated to recommend the use of it. For Aristotle there informs us, <Q REND="inline">"that Sopho∣cles alone of all the Grecian writers, made <HI>the</HI> CHORUS conducive to the progress of the fable: not only even Euripides being culpable in this instance; but other writers, after the example of Agathon, introducing Odes as little to the pur∣pose, as if they had borrowed whole scenes from another play.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q></NOTE>"</Q></P>
<P>On the whole therefore; whatever may be the merits, or advantages of <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, I cannot think that the judgment of Aristotle or Horace can be adduced in recommendation of it. As to <HI>the</HI> PRO∣BABILITY <HI>given to the representation, by the</HI> CHORUS <HI>interposing and bearing a part in the action</HI>; the Pub∣lick, who have lately seen a troop of singers assembled on the stage, as a CHORUS, during the whole re∣presentations of ELFRIDA and CARACTACUS, are
<PB N="72" REF="134"/>
competent to decide for themselves, how far such an expedient, gives a more <HI>striking resemblance of human life,</HI> than the common usage of our Drama. As to its importance in a <HI>moral</HI> view, to correct the evil impression of vicious sentiments, <HI>imputed</HI> to the speak∣ers; the story told, to enforce its use for this pur∣pose, conveys a proof of its inefficacy. To give due force to sentiments, as well as to direct their proper tendency, arises from the skill and address of the Poet, independent of <HI>the</HI> CHORUS.</P>
<P>Monsieur Dacier, as well as the author of the above note, censures the modern stage for having rejected <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, and having lost thereby <HI>at least half its probability, and its</HI> GREATEST ORNAMENT; so that our Tragedy is <HI>but a very faint shadow of the</HI> OLD. Learned Criticks, however, do not, perhaps, con∣sider, that if it be expedient to revive <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, all the other parts of the Antient Tragedy must be revived along with it. Aristotle mentions MUSICK as one of the six parts of Tragedy, and Horace no sooner introduces <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, but he proceeds to <HI>the</HI> PIPE <HI>and</HI> LYRE. If a CHORUS be really ne∣cessary, our Dramas, like those of the Antients, should be rendered wholly <HI>musical</HI>; the <HI>Dancers</HI> also will then claim their place, and the pretensions of

<P>The learned Critick seems here to believe, and the plays under the name of Seneca in some measure

warrant the conclusion, that <HI>the</HI> CHORUS of the Roman Stage was not calculated to answer the ends of its institution.

<Q><P><HI>The Chorus,</HI> says the poet, <HI>is to take the side of the good and virtuous,</HI> i. e. is always to sustain a moral character. But this will need some expla∣nation and restriction. To conceive aright of its office, we must suppose the <HI>Chorus</HI> to be a number of persons, by some probable cause assembled to∣gether, as witnesses and spectators of the great ac∣tion of the drama. Such persons, as they cannot be wholly uninterested in what passes before them, will very naturally bear some share in the repre∣sentation. This will principally consist in de∣claring their sentiments, and indulging their re∣flections freely on the several events and distresses
<PB N="75" REF="137"/>
as they shall arise. Thus we see the <HI>moral,</HI> attri∣buted to the Chorus, will be no other than the dictates of plain sense; such as must be obvious to every thinking observer of the action, who is under the influence of no peculiar partialities from <HI>affection</HI> or <HI>interest.</HI> Though even these may be supposed in cases, where the character, towards which they <HI>draw,</HI> is represented as virtuous.</P>
<P>A Chorus, thus constituted, must always, it is evident, take the part of virtue; because this is the natural and almost necessary determination of mankind, in all ages and nations, when acting freely and unconstrained.</P><BIBL><HI>Notes on the Art of Poetry.</HI></BIBL></Q>

<Q>This important advice is not always easy to be followed. Much indeed will depend on the choice of the subject, and the artful constitution of the fable. <HI>Yet, with all his care, the ablest writer will sometimes find himself embarrassed by the</HI> CHORUS.
<PB N="76" REF="138"/>
I would here be understood to speak chiefly of the moderns. For the antients, though it has not been attended to, had some peculiar advantages over us in this respect, resulting from the princi∣ples and practices of those times. For, as it hath been observed of the ancient Epic Muse, that she borrowed much of her state and dignity from the false <HI>theology</HI> of the pagan world, so, I think, it may be justly said of the ancient tragic, that she has derived great advantages of probability from its mistaken <HI>moral.</HI> If there be truth in this re∣flection, it will help to justify some of the ancient choirs, that have been most objected to by the moderns.</Q>
<P>After two examples from Euripides; in one of which the trusty CHORUS conceals the premeditated <HI>suicide</HI> of Phaedra; and in the other abets Medea's intended <HI>murder of her children</HI>; both which are most ably vindicated by the Critick; the note concludes in these words.</P>
<Q>In sum, though these acts of severe avenging justice might not be according to the express letter of the laws, or the more refined conclusions of the PORCH or ACADEMY; yet there is no doubt, that they were, in the general account, esteemed
<PB N="77" REF="139"/>
fit and reasonable. And, it is to be observed, in order to pass a right judgment on the ancient Chorus, that, though in virtue of their office, they were obliged universally to sustain a moral character; yet this moral was rather political and popular, than strictly legal or philosophic. Which is also founded on good reason. The scope and end of the ancient theatre being to serve the in∣terests of virtue and society, on the principles and sentiments, already spread and admitted amongst the people, and not to correct old errors, and in∣struct them in philosophic truth.</Q>
<P>One of the censurers of Euripides, whose opinion is controverted in the above note, is Monsieur Da∣cier; who condemns <HI>the</HI> CHORUS in this instance, as not only violating their <HI>moral</HI> office, but <HI>transgressing the laws of</HI> NATURE <HI>and of</HI> GOD, <HI>by a fidelity</HI> so VICIOUS and CRIMINAL, <HI>that these women,</HI> [<HI>the</HI> CHORUS!] <HI>ought to fly away in the Car of Medea, to escape the punishment due to them.</HI> The Annotator above, agrees with the Greek Scholiast, that <HI>the Co∣rinthian women</HI> (<HI>the</HI> CHORUS) <HI>being free,</HI> properly desert the interests of Creon, and keep Medea's se∣crets, <HI>for the sake of justice,</HI> according to their custom. Dacier, however, urges an instance of their infidelity
<PB N="78" REF="140"/>
in the Ion of Euripides, where they betray the secret of Xuthus to Creusa, which the French Critick de∣fends on account of their attachment to their mis∣tress; and adds, that the rule of Horace, like other rules, is proved by the exception. <Q REND="inline">"Besides (con∣tinues the Critick in the true spirit of French gal∣lantry) should we so heavily accuse the Poet for not having made <HI>an assembly of women</HI> KEEP A SE∣CRET?"</Q><HI>D'ailleurs, peut on faire un si grand crime à un poete, de n'avoir pas fait en sorte qu'une troupe de femmes garde un secret?</HI> He then concludes his note with blaming Euripides for the perfidy of Iphigenia at Tauris, who abandons these faithful guardians of her secret, by flying alone with Orestes, and leav∣ing them to the fury of Thoas, to which they must have been exposed, but for the intervention of Mi∣nerva.</P>
<P>On the whole, it appears that the <HI>moral importance</HI> of <HI>the</HI> CHORUS must be considered <HI>with some limita∣tions:</HI> or, at least, that <HI>the</HI> CHORUS is as liable to be misused and misapplied, as any part of modern Tragedy.</P>

<Q><PB N="79" REF="141"/><P>This, says the author of the English Com∣mentary, is one of those many passages in the epistle, about which the critics have said a great deal, without explaining any thing. In support of what I mean to offer, as the true interpreta∣tion, I observe,</P>
<P>That the poet's intention certainly was not to censure the <HI>false</HI> refinements of their stage-music; but, in a short digressive history (such as the di∣dactic form will sometimes require) to describe the rise and progress of the <HI>true.</HI> This I collect, 1. From <HI>the expression itself</HI>; which cannot, with∣out violence, be understood in any other way. For, as to the words <HI>licentia</HI> and <HI>praeceps,</HI> which have occasioned much of the difficulty, the <HI>first</HI> means a <HI>freer use,</HI> not a <HI>licentiousness,</HI> properly so called; and the <HI>other</HI> only expresses a vehemence and rapidity of language, naturally productive of a quicker elocution, such as must of course attend the more numerous harmony of the lyre:—not, as M. Dacier translates it, <HI>une eloquence temeraire et outrêe,</HI> an extravagant straining and affectation of style. 2. From <HI>the reason of the thing;</HI> which makes it incredible, that the music of the theatre should then be most complete, when the times were barbarous, and entertainments of this kind little
<PB N="80" REF="142"/>
encouraged or understood. 3. From <HI>the character of that music itself</HI>; for the rudeness of which, Ho∣race, in effect, apologizes in defending it only on the score of the imperfect state of the stage, and the simplicity of its judges.</P></Q>
<P>The above interpretation of this part of the Epistle is, in my opinion, extremely just, and exactly cor∣responds with the explication of De Nores, who cen∣sures Madius for an error similar to that of Dacier. <HI>Non rectè sentire videtur Madius, dum putat potius</HI> IN ROMANORUM LUXURIAM <HI>invectum Horatium, quam</HI> DE MELODIAE INCREMENTO <HI>tractasse.</HI></P>
<P>THE MUSICK, having always been a necessary appendage to <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, I cannot (as has already been hinted in the note on l. 100 of this version) consider the Poet's notice of the Pipe and Lyre, as a <HI>digression,</HI> notwithstanding it includes a short his¦tory of the rude simplicity of the Musick in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> earlier ages of Rome, and of its subsequent improve∣ments. <HI>The</HI> CHORUS too, being originally <HI>the whole</HI> as well as afterwards a legitimate <HI>part</HI> of Tragedy, the Poet naturally traces the Drama from its origin to its most perfect state in Greece; and afterwards compares its progress and improvements with the
<PB N="81" REF="143"/>
Theatre of his own country. Such is, I think, the natural and easy <HI>method</HI> pursued by Horace; though it differs in some measure from the <HI>order</HI> and <HI>con∣nection</HI> pointed out by the author of the English Commentary.</P>

<P>These lines, rather breaking in upon the continuity of the history of theatrical musick, create some ob∣scurity, which has given birth to various interpreta∣tions.

<P>This interpretation is ingenious; but Jason De Nores gives, I think, a more easy and unforced ex∣planation of this difficult passage, by supposing it to refer (by way of <HI>parenthesis</HI>) to what had just been said of the original rude simplicity of the Roman theatrical musick, which, says the Poet, was at least as polished and refined as the taste of the au∣dience This De Nores urges in two several notes, both which I shall submit to the reader, leaving it to him to determine how far I am to be justified in having adapted my version to his interpretation.</P>

<Q><P>This is the application of what hath been said, in general, concerning the refinement of theatri∣cal music to the case of <HI>tragedy.</HI> Some commen∣tators say, and to <HI>comedy.</HI> But in this they mis∣take, as will appear presently. M. <HI>Dacier</HI> hath I know not what conceit about a comparison be∣twixt the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> stage. His reason is, <HI>that the lyre was used in the Greek Chorus, as appears,</HI> he says, <HI>from Sophocles himself playing upon this in∣strument himself in one of his tragedies.</HI> And was it not used too in the Roman Chorus, as appears from Nero's playing upon it in several tragedies? But the learned critic did not apprehend this matter. Indeed from the caution, with which his guides, the dealers in antiquities, always touch this point, it should seem, that they too had no very clear conceptions of it. The case I take to have been this: The <HI>tibia,</HI> as being most proper to accompany the declamation of the acts, <HI>can∣tanti succinere,</HI> was constantly employed, as well in the Roman tragedy as comedy. This appears from many authorities. I mention only two from
<PB N="86" REF="148"/>
Cicero. <HI>Quam multa</HI> [Acad. l. ii. 7.] <HI>quae nos fu∣giunt in cantu, exaudiunt in eo genere exercitati: Qui primo inflatu Tibicinis, Antiopam esse aiunt aut An∣dromacham, cum nos ne suspicemur quidem.</HI> The other is still more express. In his piece entitled <HI>Orator,</HI> speaking of the negligence of the Roman writers, in respect of <HI>numbers,</HI> he observes, <HI>that there were even many passages in their tragedies, which, unless the</HI> TIBIA <HI>played to them, could not be dlstinguished from mere prose: quae, nisi cum Ti∣bicen accesserit, orationi sint solutoe simillima.</HI> One of these passages is expressly quoted from <HI>Thyestes,</HI> a tragedy of <HI>Ennius</HI>; and, as appears from the measure, taken out of one of the acts. It is clear then, that the <HI>tibia</HI> was certainly used in the <HI>de∣clamation</HI> of tragedy. But now the song of the tragic chorus, being of the nature of the ode, of course required <HI>fides,</HI> the lyre, the peculiar and appropriated instrument of the lyric muse. And this is clearly collected, if not from express tes∣timonies; yet from some occasional hints dropt by the antients. For, 1. the lyre, we are told, [Cic. De Leg. ii. 9 &amp; 15.] and is agreed on all hands, was an instrument of the Roman theatre; but it was not employed in comedy. This we certainly know from the short account of the
<PB N="87" REF="149"/>
music prefixed to Terence's plays. 2. Further, the <HI>tibicen,</HI> as we saw, accompanied the declama∣tion of the acts in tragedy. It remains then, that the proper place of the lyre was, where one should naturally look for it, in the songs of the Chorus; but we need not go further than this very passage for a proof. It is unquestionable, that the poet is here speaking of the Chorus only; the following lines not admitting any other possible interpreta∣tion. By <HI>fidibus</HI> then is necessarily understood the instrument peculiarly used in it. Not that it need be said that the <HI>tibia</HI> was never used in the Chorus. The contrary seems expressed in a passage of Se∣neca, [Ep. lxxxiv.] and in Julius Pollux [l. iv. 15: § 107.] It is sufficient, if the <HI>lyre</HI> was used sole∣ly, or principally, in it at this time. In this view, the whole digression is more pertinent, and con∣nects better. The poet had before been speaking of tragedy. All his directions from l. 100, respect this species of the drama only. The application of what he had said concerning music, is then most naturally made, 1. to the <HI>tibia,</HI> the music of the acts; and, 2. to <HI>fides,</HI> that of the choir: thus confining himself, as the tenor of this part re∣quired, to tragedy only. Hence is seen the mis∣take, not only of M. Dacier, whose comment is
<PB N="88" REF="150"/>
in every view insupportable; but, as was hinted, of Heinsius, Lambin, and others, who, with more probability, explained this of the Roman comedy and tragedy. For, though <HI>tibia</HI> might be allowed to stand for comedy, as opposed to <HI>tragoedia,</HI> [as in fact, we find it in l. ii. Ep. 1.98,] that being the only instrument employed in it; yet, in speak∣ing expresly of the music of the stage, <HI>fides</HI> could not determinately enough, and in contradistinction to <HI>tibia,</HI> denote that of tragedy, it being an instru∣ment used solely, or principally, in the Chorus; of which, the context shews, he alone speaks. It is further to be observed, that, in the applica∣tion here made, besides the music, the poet takes in the other improvements of the Tragic Chorus, these happening, as from the nature of the thing they would do, at the same time.</P> <BIBL><HI>Notes on the Art of Poetry.</HI></BIBL></Q>

<P>Of the use and propriety of these gestures, or dances, it will not be easy for us, who see no such things attempted on the modern stage, to form any very clear or exact notions. What we cannot doubt of is, 1. That the several theatrical dances of the antients were strictly conformable to the genius of the different species of composition, to which they were applied. 2. That, therefore, the tragic dance, which more especially accompanied the Chorus, must have been expressive of the high∣est gravity and decorum, tending to inspire ideas of what is <HI>becoming, graceful,</HI> and <HI>majestic</HI>; in which view we cannot but perceive the important assist∣ance it must needs lend to virtue, and how greatly it must contribute to set all her graces and attrac∣tions in the fairest light. 3.

<P>If I am not greatly deceived, all the Editors, and Commentators on this Epistle, have failed to observe, that the <HI>historical</HI> part of it, relative to the Graecian Drama, commences at this verse; all of them sup∣posing it to begin, 55 lines further in the Epistle, on the mention of Thespis; whom Horace as clear∣ly, as correctly, describes to be the first <HI>improver,</HI> not <HI>inventor</HI> of Tragedy, <HI>whose</HI> ORIGINAL he marks <HI>here.</HI> Much confusion has, I think, arisen from this oversight, as I shall endeavour to explain in the fol∣lowing notes; only observing in this place, that the Poet, having spoken particularly of all the parts of Tragedy, now enters with the strictest <HI>order,</HI> and greatest propriety, into its general history, which, by his strictures on <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, he most elegantly,

<Q><P>It is not the intention of these notes to retail the accounts of others, I must therefore refer the reader, for whatever concerns the history of the satiric, as I have hitherto done of the tragic and comic drama, to the numerous dissertators on the ancient stage; and, above all, in the case before us, to the learned Casaubon; from whom all that hath been said to any purpose, by modern writers, hath been taken. Only it will be proper to ob∣serve one or two particulars, which have been greatly misunderstood, and without which it will be impossible, in any tolerable manner, to explain what follows.</P>
<P N="1">I. The design of the poet, in these lines, is not to fix the origin of the satyric piece, in ascribing
<PB N="92" REF="154"/>
the invention of it to Thespis. This hath been concluded, without the least warrant from his own words, which barely tell us, <Q REND="inline">"that the represen∣tation of tragedy was in elder Greece followed by the <HI>satires</HI>;"</Q> and indeed the nature of the thing, as well as the testimony of all antiquity, shews it to be impossible. For the <HI>satire</HI> here spoken of is, in all respects, a regular drama, and therefore could not be of earlier date than the times of Aes∣chylus, when the constitution of the drama was first formed. It is true indeed, there was a kind of entertainment of much greater antiquity, which by the antients is sometimes called <HI>satyric,</HI> out of which (as Aristotle assures us) tragedy itself arose, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> But then this was nothing but a Chorus of satyrs [Athenaeus, l. xiv.] celebrating the festivals of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> with rude songs and un∣couth dances; and had little resemblance to that which was afterwards called <HI>satiric</HI>; which, ex∣cept that it retained the Chorus of satyrs, and turned upon some subject relative to Bacchus, was of a quite different structure, and, in every respect, as regular a composition as tragedy it∣self.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="93" REF="155"/>II. There is no doubt but the poem, here dis∣tinguished by the name of SATYRI, was in actual use on the Roman stage. This appears from the turn of the poet's whole criticism upon it. Par∣ticularly, his address to the Pisos, l. 235 and his observation of the offence which a loose dialogue in this drama would give to a <HI>Roman</HI> auditory, l. 248, make it evident that he had, in fact, the practice of his own stage in view.</P>
<P N="3">III. For the absolute merit of these satires, the reader will judge of it himself by comparing the Cyclops, the only piece of this kind remaining to us from antiquity, with the rules here delivered by Horace. Only it may be observed, in addition to what the reader will find elsewhere [<HI>n.</HI> l. 223.] apologized in its favour, that the double character of the satires admirably fitted it, as well for a sen∣sible entertainment to the wise, as for the sport and diversion of the vulgar. For, while the grotesque appearance and jesting vein of these fantastic per∣sonages amused the one, the other saw much fur∣ther; and considered them, at the same time, as replete with science, and informed by a spirit of the most abstruse wisdom. Hence important lessons of civil prudence, interesting allusions to public
<PB N="94" REF="156"/>
affairs, or a high, refined moral, might, with the highest probability, be insinuated, under the slight cover of a rustic simplicity. And from this in∣structive cast, which from its nature must be very obscure, if not impenetrable, to us at this day, was, I doubt not, derived the principal pleasure which the antients found in this species of the drama. If the modern reader would conceive any thing of the nature and degree of this pleasure, he may in part guess at it, from reflecting on the entertainment he himself receives from the cha∣racters of the clowns in Shakespeare; <HI>who,</HI> as the poet himself hath characterized them, <HI>use their folly, like a stalking horse, and, under the presentation of that, shoot their wit.</HI> [As you like it.]—</P><BIBL><HI>Notes on the Art of Poetry.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>This learned note, I think, sets out with a mis∣apprehension of the meaning of Horace, by involv∣ing his <HI>instructions</HI> on THE SATYRICK DRAMA, with his account of its <HI>Origin.</HI> Nor does he, in the most distant manner, insinuate, tho' Dacier has asserted the same thing, that <HI>the</HI> SATYRS owed their first in∣troduction to <HI>Thespis</HI>; but relates, that the very Poets, who contended in <HI>the Goat-Song,</HI> to which TRAGEDY owes its name, finding it too solemn and severe
<PB N="95" REF="157"/>
an entertainment for their rude holiday audience, interspersed the grave strains of tragedy with comick and <HI>satyrical</HI> Interludes, producing thereby a kind of medley, something congenial to what has appeared on our own stage, under the name of TRAGI-COMEDY. Nor, if I am able to read and comprehend the con∣text, do the words of Horace tell us, <Q REND="inline">"that the re∣presentation of Tragedy was, in elder Greece, <HI>followed</HI> by <HI>the</HI> SATYRS."</Q> The Satyrs composed a part of the Tragedy in its infancy, as well as in the days of Horace, if his own words may be quoted as authority. On any other construction, his direc∣tions, concerning the conduct of the <HI>God</HI> or <HI>Hero</HI> of the piece, are scarcely reconcilable to common sense; and it is almost impossible to mark their being incorporated with the Tragedy, in more expressive terms or images, than by his sollicitude to prevent their broad mirth from contaminating its dignity or purity.</P>

<P><HI>The</HI> CYCLOPS of Euripides, the only SATYRICK DRAMA extant, written at a much later period, than
<PB N="96" REF="158"/>
that of which Horace speaks in this place, cannot, I think, convey to us a very exact idea of <HI>the Tragick Pastorals,</HI> whose <HI>origin</HI> he here describes. <HI>The</HI> CY∣CLOPS, scarce exceeding 700 lines, might be played, according to the idea of some criticks, after another performance: but that cannot, without the greatest violence to the text, be supposed of the satyrick piece here mentioned by Horace. The idea of <HI>farces,</HI> or <HI>after-pieces,</HI> tho' an inferior branch of the Drama, is, in fact, among the refinements of an improved age. The writers of an early period throw their dra∣matick materials, serious and ludicrous, into one mass; which the critical chymistry of succeeding times separates and refines. The modern stage, like the antient, owed its birth to the ceremonies of Religion. From <HI>Mysteries</HI> and <HI>Moralities,</HI> it pro∣ceeded to more regular Dramas, diversifying their serious scenes, like <HI>the</HI> SATYRICK POETS, with lu∣dicrous representations. This desire of <HI>variety</HI> was one cause of the <HI>irregularity,</HI> as well as extraordi∣nary <HI>length</HI> of their pieces; of which, I believe, they never gave above <HI>one</HI> at the same time of repre∣sentation. <HI>Farce</HI> is, in point of age, as well as rank, but a younger brother of the Theatre.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="159"/>Other Criticks have taken the text of Horace in the same sense, that I have here considered it.</P>

<P>The distinction made by <HI>De Nores</HI> of <HI>the</HI> SATYRS not making a part of the Tragedy, but barely ap∣pearing between the acts, can only signify, that the Tragick and Comick Scenes were kept apart from each other. This is plain from his saying that they held the place of THE CHORUS; not sustaining their continued part in the tragick dialogue, but filling their chief office of singing between the acts. The antient Tragedy was one continued representation, divided into acts by the Chaunt of <HI>the</HI> CHORUS; and, otherwise, according to modern ideas, forming <HI>but one act,</HI> without any interruption of the per∣formance.</P>
<P>These antient SATYRICK SONGS, with which the antient Tragedians endeavoured to enliven the Di∣thyrambicks, gave rise to two different species of poetry. Their rude jests and petulant raillery en∣gendered <HI>the Satire</HI>; and their sylvan character pro∣duced <HI>the Pastoral.</HI></P>

<Q><P>It hath been shewn, that the poet could not intend, in these lines, to <HI>fix the origin of the sa∣tiric drama.</HI> But, though this be certain, and the dispute concerning that point be thereby deter∣mined, yet it is to be noted, that he purposely describes the satire in its ruder and less polished form; glancing even at some barbarities, which deform the Bacchic Chorus; which was properly the satiric piece, before Aeschylus had, by his regular constitution of the drama, introduced it under a very different form on the stage. The reason of this conduct is given in <HI>n.</HI> on l. 203. Hence the propriety of the word <HI>nudavit,</HI> which Lambin rightly interprets, <HI>nudos intro∣duxit satyros,</HI> the poet hereby expressing the mon∣strous indecorum of this entertainment in its first unimproved state.

<P>The beginning of this note does not, I think, perfectly accord with what has been urged by the same Critick in the note immediately preceding. He there observed, that <HI>the</HI><Q REND="inline">"SATYR here spoken of, is, <HI>in all respects,</HI> a regular Drama, and therefore <HI>could not be of earlier date,</HI> than the times of Aes∣chylus."</Q></P>
<P>Here, however, he allows, though in subdued phrase, that <Q REND="inline">"though this <HI>be certain, and the dispute</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="163"/><HI>concerning that point thereby determined,</HI> yet it is to be noted, <HI>that he purposely describes the Satyr.</HI> IN ITS RUDE AND LESS POLISHED FORM; <HI>glancing even at some barbarities, which deform</HI> THE BACCHIC CHORUS; WHICH WAS PROPERLY THE SATYRICK PIECE, <HI>before</HI> Aeschylus had, by his regular con∣stitution of the Drama, introduced it, <HI>under a very different form,</HI> on the stage."</Q> In a subsequent note, the same learned Critick also says, that <Q REND="inline">"the connecting particle, <HI>verum,</HI> [<HI>verum ita risores, &amp;c.</HI>] expresses the opposition intended between the <HI>ori∣ginal Satyr</HI> and that which the Poet approves."</Q> In both these passages the ingenious Commentator seems, from the mere influence of the context, to approach to the interpretation that I have hazarded of this passage, avowedly one of the most obscure parts of the Epistle.</P>
<P>The explanation of the words INCOLUMI GRA∣VITATE, in the latter part of the above note, though favourable to the system of the English Commentary, is not only contrary to the construction of all other interpreters, and, I believe, unwarranted by any ac∣ceptation of the word INCOLUMIS, but, in my opi∣nion, less elegant and forcible than the common in∣terpretation.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="164"/>The line of the Ode referred to,

<P><PB N="104" REF="166"/>The author of the English Commentary tells us, that <Q REND="inline">"Gods and Heroes were introduced as well into the <HI>Satyrick</HI> as <HI>Tragick</HI> Drama, and often the very same Gods and Heroes, which had borne a part in THE PRECEDING TRAGEDY; a practice, which Horace, I suppose, intended, by this hint, to re∣commend as most regular."</Q></P>
<P>The two short notes of Schrevelius, in my opinion, more clearly explain the sense of Horace, and are in these words.</P>
<Q><HI>Poema serium, jocis</HI> SATYRICIS <HI>ita</HI> COMMISCERE<HI>—ne scilicet is, qui paulo ante</HI> DEI <HI>instar aut</HI> HEROIS <HI>in scenam fuit introductus, postea lacernosus prodeat.</HI></Q>
<P>On the whole, supposing <HI>the</HI> SATYRICK <HI>Piece</HI> to be <HI>Tragi-Comick,</HI> as Dacier himself seems half in∣clined to believe, the precept of Horace only re∣commends to the author so to support his principal personage, that his behaviour in the SATYRICK scenes shall not debase the character he has sustained in the TRAGICK. No specimen remaining of the Roman SATYRICK Piece, I may be permitted to il∣lustrate the rule of Horace by a brilliant example from the <HI>serio-comick</HI> HISTORIES of the Sovereign of our Drama. The example to which I point, is the
<PB N="105" REF="167"/>
character of <HI>the</HI> PRINCE <HI>of</HI> WALES, in the two Parts of <HI>Henry the Fourth.</HI> Such a natural and beautiful decorum is maintained in the display of that cha∣racter, that the <HI>Prince</HI> is as discoverable in the loose scenes with Falstaff and his associates, as in the Presence Chamber, or the Closet. After <HI>the natural,</HI> though MIXT DRAMAS, of Shakespear, and Beau∣mont and Fletcher, had prevailed on our stage, it is surprising that our progress to <HI>pure</HI> Tragedy and Co∣medy, should have been interrupted, or disturbed, by <HI>the regular monster of</HI> TRAGI-COMEDY, nursed by Southerne and Dryden.</P>

<P>It should seem from hence, that the common cha∣racters of Comedy, as well as the Gods and Heroes of Tragedy, had place in <HI>the</HI> SATYRICK DRAMA, cultivated in the days of Horace. Of the manner in which the antient writers sustained the part of Silenus, we may judge from <HI>the</HI> CYCLOPS of Eu∣ripides, and <HI>the</HI> PASTORALS of Virgil.</P>
<P>Vossius attempts to shew from some lines of this part of the Epistle, [<HI>Ne quicumque Deus, &amp;c.</HI>] that <HI>the</HI> SATYRS were <HI>subjoined</HI> to the Tragick scenes, not <HI>incorporated</HI> with them: and yet at the same mo∣ment he tells us, and with apparent approbation, that DIOMEDES quotes our Poet to prove that they

<P>I cannot more satisfactorily conclude all that I have to urge, on the subject of the SATYRICK DRAMA, as here described by Horace, than by one more short extract from the notes of the ingenious author of the English Commentary, to the substance of which extract I give the most full assent.</P>
<Q>The Greek Drama, we know, had its origin from the loose, licentious raillery of the rout of Bacchus, indulging to themselves the freest sallies of taunt and invective, as would best suit to law∣less natures, inspirited by festal mirth, and made extravagant by wine. Hence arose, and with a character answering to this original, the <HI>Satiric Drama</HI>; the spirit of which was afterwards, in good measure, revived and continued in the Old Comedy, and itself preserved, though with con∣siderable alteration in the form, through all the several periods of the Greek stage; even when Tra∣gedy, which arose out of it, was brought to its last perfection.</Q>

<Q><L><HI>Syllaba longa, brevi subjecta, vocatur Iambus.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Horace having, after the example of his master Aristotle, slightly mentioned the first rise of Tragedy in the form of a CHORAL SONG, subjoining an ac∣count of <HI>the</HI> SATYRICK CHORUS, that was soon (MOX <HI>etiam</HI>) combined with it, proceeds to speak particularly of the Iambick verse, which he has be∣fore mentioned generally, as the measure best ac∣commodated to the Drama. In this instance, how∣ever, the Poet has trespassed against <HI>the order and method</HI> observed by his philosophical guide; and by that trespass broken the thread of his history of the Drama, which has added to the difficulty and ob∣scurity of this part of his Epistle. Aristotle does not speak of <HI>the</HI> MEASURE, till he has brought Tra∣gedy, through all its progressive stages, from the Dithyrambicks, down to its establishment by Aes∣chylus and Sophocles. If the reader would judge of the <HI>poetical beauty,</HI> as well as <HI>logical precision,</HI> of such an arrangement, let him transfer this section of the Epistle [beginning, in the original at v. 251. and ending at 274,] to the end of the 284th line; by which transposition, or I am much mistaken, he will
<PB N="109" REF="171"/>
not only disembarrass this historical part of it, rela∣tive to the Graecian stage, but will pass by a much easier, and more elegant, transition, to the Poet's application of the narrative to the Roman Drama.</P>

<P>It is surprising that Dacier, who, in a controversial note, in refutation of Heinsius, has so properly re∣marked Horace's adherence to Aristotle, should not have observed that his history of the Drama opens and proceeds nearly in the same order. Aristotle in∣deed does not name Thespis, but we cannot but in∣clude his improvements among the changes, to which the Critick refers, before Tragedy acquired a per∣manent form under Aeschylus. Thespis seems not only to have embodied <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, but to have pro∣vided a theatrical apparatus for an itinerant exhibition; to have furnished disguises for his performers, and to have broken the continuity of <HI>the</HI> CHORUS by an <HI>Interlocutor</HI>; to whom Aeschylus adding another per∣sonage, thereby first created DRAMATICK DIA∣LOGUE; while at the same time by a <HI>further diminu∣tion of the</HI> CHORUS, by improving the dresses of the actors, and drawing them from their travelling waggon to a fixt stage, he created <HI>a regular theatre.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="173"/>It appears then that neither Horace, nor Aristotle, ascribe <HI>the origin</HI> of Tragedy to THESPIS. The Poet first mentions the rude beginning of Tragedy, <HI>(carmen tragicum) the</HI> GOAT-SONG; he then speaks of <HI>the Satyrick Chorus,</HI> soon after interwoven with it; and then proceeds to the <HI>improvements</HI> of these Bacchic Festivities, by Thespis, and Aeschylus; though their perfection and final establishment is as∣cribed by Aristotle to Sophocles.</P>
<P>DACIER very properly renders this passage, <HI>On dit que Thespis fut le premier qui inventa</HI> UNE ESPECI DE TRAGEDIE AUPARAVANT INCONNUE AUX GRECS. <Q REND="inline">"Thespis is said to be the first inventor of <HI>a species</HI> of Tragedy, <HI>before unknown to the Greeks.</HI>"</Q></P>

<Q><P>Evidently because, though the <HI>jus nocendi</HI> was taken away, yet that was no good reason why the Chorus should entirely cease. M.

<P>The author of the English Commentary has a note on this passage, replete with fine taste, and sound criticism.</P>
<Q><P>This judgment of the poet, recommending do∣mestick subjects, as fittest for the stage, may be inforced from many obvious reasons. As, 1. that it renders the drama infinitely more <HI>affecting:</HI> and this on many accounts, 1. As a subject, taken from our own annals, must of course carry with it an air of greater probability, at least to the ge∣nerality of the people, than one borrowed from
<PB N="115" REF="177"/>
those of any other nation. 2. As we all find a personal interest in the subject. 3. As it of course affords the best and easiest opportunities of catch∣ing our minds, by frequent references to our man∣ners, prejudices, and customs. And of how great importance this is, may be learned from hence, that, even in the exhibition of foreign charac∣ters, dramatic writers have found themselves obliged to sacrifice truth and probability to the humour of the people, and to dress up their per∣sonages, contrary to their own better judgment, in some degree according to the mode and man∣ners of their respective countries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>"L'etude égale des poëtes de différens tems à plaire à leurs spec∣tateurs, a encore influé dans la maniere de peindre les caracteres. Ceux qui paroissent sur la scene Angloise, Espagnols, Françoise, sont plus Anglois, Espagnols, ou François que Grecs ou Romains, en un mot que ce qu'ils doivent être. Il ne faut qu'en peu de discernement pour s'appercevoir que nos Césarts et nos Achiles, en gardanr même un partie de leur charactere primitif, prennent droit de naturalité dans le païs où ils sont transplantez, semblables à ces portraits, qui sortent de la main d'un peintre Flamand, Italien, ou François, et qui portent l'empreinte du païs.

And, 4. as the writer himself, from an intimate acquaintance with the character and genius of his own nation,
<PB N="116" REF="178"/>
will be more likely to draw the manners with life and spirit.</P>
<P N="2">II. Next, which should ever be one great point in view, it renders the drama more generally use∣ful in its moral destination. For, it being con∣versant about domestic acts, the great instruction of the fable more sensibly affects us; and the cha∣racters exhibited, from the part we take in their good or ill qualities, will more probably influence our conduct.</P>
<P N="3">III. Lastly, this judgment will deserve the greater regard, as the conduct recommended was, in fact, the practice of our great models, the Greek writers; in whose plays, it is observable, there is scarcely a single scene, which lies out of the confines of Greece.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding these reasons, the practice hath, in all times, been but little followed. The Romans, after some few attempts in this way (from whence the poet took the occasion of de∣livering it as a dramatic precept), soon relapsed into their old use; as appears from Seneca's, and the titles of other plays, written in, or after the Augustan age. Succeeding times continued the
<PB N="117" REF="179"/>
same attachment to Grecian, with the addition of an equal fondness for Roman, subjects. The rea∣son in both instances hath been ever the same: that strong and early prejudice, approaching some∣what to adoration, in favour of the illustrious names of those two great states. The account of this matter is very easy; for their writings, as they furnish the business of our younger, and the amusement of our riper, years; and more especially make the study of all those, who devote themselves to poetry and the stage, insensibly infix in us an excessive veneration for all affairs in which they were concerned; insomuch, that no other subjects or events seem considerable enough, or rise, in any proportion, to our ideas of the dignity of the tragick scene, but such as time and long admiration have consecrated in the annals of their story. Our Shakespeare was, I think, the first that broke through this bondage of classical super∣stition. And he owed this felicity, as he did some others, to his want of what is called the advantage of a learned education. Thus uninfluenced by the weight of early prepossession, he struck at once into the road of nature and common sense: and with∣out designing, without knowing it, hath left us in his historical plays, with all their anomalies,
<PB N="118" REF="180"/>
an exacter resemblance of the Athenian stage, than is any where to be found in its most professed ad∣mirers and copyists.</P>
<P>I will only add, that, for the more successful execution of this rule of celebrating domestic acts, much will depend on the aera, from whence the subject is taken. Times too remote have almost the same inconveniences, and none of the advan∣tages, which attend the ages of Greece and Rome. And for those of later date, they are too much fa∣miliarized to us, and have not as yet acquired that venerable cast and air, which tragedy demands, and age only can give. There is no fixing this point with precision. In the general, that aera is the fittest for the poet's purpose, which, though fresh enough in our minds to warm and interest us in the event of the action, is yet at so great a distance from the present times, as to have lost all those mean and disparaging circumstances, which unavoidably adhere to recent deeds, and, in some measure, sink the noblest modern trans∣actions to the level of ordinary life.</P><BIBL><HI>Notes on the Art of Poetry.</HI></BIBL></Q>

<Q><P>Nothing in the art requires more attention and judgment, or more of that power of discrimina∣tion, which may not improperly be called Genius, than the steering between general ideas and indi∣viduality; for though the body of the whole must certainly be composed by the first, in order to communicate a character of grandeur to the whole, yet a dash of the latter is sometimes necessary to give an interest. An individual model, copied with scrupulous exactness, makes a mean style like the Dutch; and the neglect of an actual model, and the method of proceeding solely from idea, has
<PB N="123" REF="185"/>
a tendency to make the Painter degenerate into a mannerist.</P>
<P>It is necessary to keep the mind in repair, to replace and refreshen those impressions of nature, which are continually wearing away.</P>
<P>A circumstance mentioned in the life of Guido, is well worth the attention of Artists: He was asked from whence he borrowed his idea of beauty, which is acknowledged superior to that of every other Painter; he said he would shew all the models he used, and ordered a common Porter to sit before him, from whom he drew a beautiful countenance; this was intended by Guido as an exaggeration of his conduct; but his intention was to shew that he thought it necessary to have <HI>some model</HI> of nature before you, however you deviate from it, and correct it from the idea which you have formed in your mind of <HI>perfect beauty.</HI></P>
<P>In Painting it is far better to have a <HI>model</HI> even to <HI>depart</HI> from, than to have nothing fixed and certain to determine the idea: There is something then to proceed on, something to be corrected; so that even supposing that no part is taken, the model has still been not without use.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="186"/>Such habits of intercourse with nature, will at least create that <HI>variety</HI> which will prevent any one's prognosticating what manner of work is to be produced, on knowing the subject, which is the most disagreeable character an Artist can have.</P>

<P>We are now arrived at that portion of the Epistle, which I must confess I am surprised, that any Com∣mentator ever past, without observing the peculiar language and conduct of the Poet. There is a kind of awful affection in his manner, wonderfully cal∣culated to move our feelings and excite our atten∣tion. The DIDACTICK and the EPISTOLARY stile were never more happily blended. The Poet assumes the air of a father advising his son, rather than of a teacher instructing his pupils. Many Criticks have thrown out a cursory observation or two, as it were extorted from them by the pointed expressions of the Poet: but none of them, that I have consulted, have attempted to assign any reason, why Horace, having closed his particular precepts, addresses all the re∣mainder of his Epistle, on the nature and expediency of Poetical pursuits, to <HI>the</HI> ELDER PISO only. I have endeavoured to give the most natural reason for this conduct; a reason which, if I am not deceived, renders the whole of the Epistle interesting, as well as clear and consistent; a reason which I am the more inclined to think substantial, as it confirms in great measure the system of the Author of the English

The MUSE, and APOLLO, were the avowed patrons and inspirers of Poetry in general, whether Epick, Dramatick, Civil, Moral, or Religious; all of which are enumerated by Horace in the course of his panegyrick, and referred to in the conclusion of it, that PISO might not for a moment think himself degraded by his attention to poetry.</P>

<P>I have endeavoured, after the example of the learned and ingenious author of the English Commentary, though on somewhat different principles, to prove <Q REND="inline">"an unity of design in this Epistle,"</Q> as well as to illustrate <Q REND="inline">"the pertinent connection of its several parts."</Q> Many perhaps, like myself, will hesitate to embrace the system of that acute Critick; and as many, or more, may reject my hypothesis. But I am thoroughly persuaded that no person, who has considered this work of Horace with due attention, and carefully examined the drift and intention of the writer, but will at least be convinced of the folly or blindness, or haste and carelessness of those Criticks, however distinguished, who have pro∣nounced it to be a crude, unconnected, immethodi∣cal, and inartificial composition. No modern, I believe, ever more intently studied, or more clearly understood the works of Horace, than BOILEAU. His Art of Poetry is deservedly admired. But I am surprised that it has never been observed that the Plan of that work is formed on the model of this Epistle, though some of the parts are more in detail, and others varied, according to the age and country of the writer. The first Canto, like the first Section of <HI>the Epistle to the Pisos,</HI> is taken up in general pre∣cepts. The second enlarges on the Lyrick, and

Elegiack, and smaller species of Poetry, but cur∣sorily mentioned, or referred to, by Horace; but introduced by him into that part of the Epistle, that runs exactly parallel with the second Canto of Boi∣leau's Art of Poetry. The third Canto treats, en∣tirely on the ground of Horace, of Epick and Dra∣matick Poetry; though the French writer has, with great address, accommodated to his purpose what Horace has said but collaterally, and as it were in∣cidentally, of the Epick. The last Canto is formed on the final section, the last hundred and eleven lines, of <HI>the Epistle to the Pisos:</HI> the author however, judiciously omitting in a professed Art of Poetry, the description of the Frantick Bard, and concluding his work, like the Epistle to Augustus, with a com∣pliment to the Sovereign.</P>
<P>This imitation I have not pointed out, in order to depreciate the excellent work of Boileau; but to shew that, in the judgment of so great a writer, the method of Horace was not so ill conceived, as Scaliger pretends, even for the outline of an Art of Poetry: Boileau himself, at the very conclusion of his last Canto, seems to avow and glory in the charge of having founded his work on that of HORACE.</P>

<P>After endeavouring to vouch so strong a testimony, in favour of Horace's <HI>unity</HI> and <HI>order,</HI> from France, it is but candid to acknowledge that two of the most popular Poets, of our own country, were of a con∣trary opinion. Dryden, in his dedication of his translation of the Aeneid to Lord Mulgrave, author of the Essay on Poetry, writes thus. <Q REND="inline">"In this ad∣dress to your Lordship, I design not a treatise of Heroick Poetry, but write <HI>in a loose Epistolary way,</HI> somewhat tending to that subject, <HI>after the ex∣ample of Horace,</HI> in his first Epistle of the 2d Book to Augustus Caesar, <HI>and of that</HI> TO THE PISOS; which we call his ART OF POETRY. In both of which <HI>he observes</HI> NO METHOD <HI>that I can trace,</HI> whatever Scaliger the Father, or Heinsius may have seen, <HI>or rather</HI> THINK <HI>they had seen.</HI> I have taken up, laid down, and resumed as often as I pleased the same subject: and this loose pro∣ceeding I shall use through all this Prefatory
<PB N="145" REF="207"/>
Dedication. <HI>Yet all this while I have been sailing with some side wind or other toward the point I pro∣posed in the beginning.</HI>"</Q> The latter part of the comparison, if the comparison is meant to hold throughout, as well as the words, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>somewhat tend∣ing to that subject,</HI>"</Q> seem to qualify the rest; as if Dryden only meant to distinguish the <HI>loose</HI> EPIS∣TOLARY <HI>way</HI> from the formality of <HI>a Treatise.</HI> How∣ever this may be, had he seen the <HI>Chart,</HI> framed by the author of the English Commentary, or that now delineated, perhaps he might have allowed, that Horace not only made towards his point with some side-wind or other, but proceeded by an easy navi∣gation and tolerably plain sailing.</P>
<P>Many passages of this Dedication, as well as other pieces of Dryden's prose, have been versified by Pope. His opinion also, on the Epistle to the Pisos, is said to have agreed with that of Dryden; though the Introduction to his Imitation of the Epistle to Augustus forbids us to suppose he entertained the like sentiments of that work with his great prede∣cessor. His general idea of Horace stands recorded in a most admirable didactick poem; in the course of which he seems to have kept a steady eye on this work of our author.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="conclusion">
<P>☞ I have now compleated my observations on this popular Work of Horace, of which I at first attempted the version and illustration, as a matter of amusement; but which, I confess, I have felt, in the progress, to be an arduous undertaking, and a laborious task. Such parts of the Epistle, as cor∣responded with the general ideas of Modern Poetry, and the Modern Drama, I flattered myself with the hopes of rendering tolerable to the English Reader;
<PB N="147" REF="209"/>
but when I arrived at those passages, wholly relative to the Antient Stage, I began to feel my friends dropping off, and leaving me a very thin audience. My part too grew less agreeable, as it grew more difficult. I was almost confounded in the serio∣comick scenes of the Satyrick Piece: In the musical department I was ready, with Le Fevre, to execrate the Flute, and all the Commentators on it; and when I found myself reduced to scan the merits and demerits of Spondees and Trimeters, I almost fancied myself under the dominion of some <HI>plagosus Orbilius,</HI> and translating the <HI>prosodia</HI> of the Latin Grammar. Borrowers and Imitators cull the sweets, and suck the classick flowers, rejecting at pleasure all that ap∣pear sour, bitter, or unpalatable. Each of them travels at his ease in the high turnpike-road of poetry, quoting the authority of Horace himself to keep clear of difficulties;
<Q><L><HI>—et quae</HI></L>
<L><HI>Desperat tractata nitescere posse, relinquit.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>A translator must stick close to his Author, follow him up hill and down dale, over hedge and ditch, tearing his way after his leader thro' the thorns and brambles of literature, sometimes lost, and often benighted.</P>

<P>The reader, I fear, will fancy I rejoice too much at having broke loose from my bondage, and that I grow wanton with the idea of having regained my liberty. I shall therefore engage an advocate to re∣commend me to his candour and indulgence; and as I introduced these notes with some lines from a noble Poet of our own country, I shall conclude them with an extract from a French Critick: Or, if I may speak the language of my <HI>trade,</HI> as I opened these annotations with a <HI>Prologue</HI> from ROSCOMMON, I shall drop the curtain with <HI>an Epilogue</HI> from DA∣CIER. Another curtain now demands my attention. I am called from the contemplation of Antient Ge∣nius, to sacrifice, with due respect, to Modern Taste: I am summoned from a review of the mag∣nificent spectacles of Greece and Rome, to the re∣hearsal of a Farce at the Little Theatre in the Hay-market.</P>
<Q><P>Voila tout ce que j'ai cru necessaire pour l'in∣telligence de la Poetique d'Horace! si Jule Sca∣liger l'avoit bien entendue, il lui auroit rendu plus de justice, &amp; en auroit parlé plus modestement.
<PB N="149" REF="211"/>
Mais il ne s'estoit pas donnê la temps de le bien comprendre. Ce Livre estoit trop petit pour estre gouté d'un homme comme lui, qui faisoit grand cas des gros volumes, &amp; qui d'ailleurs aimoit bien mieux donner des regles que d'en recevoir. Sa Poetique est assurément un ouvrage d'une erudition infinie; on y trouve par tout des choses fort re∣cherchées, &amp; elle est toute pleine de saillies qui marquent beaucoup d'esprit: mais j'oserai dire qu'il n'y a point de justesse dans la pluspart de ses jugemens, &amp; que sa critique n'est pas heureuse. Il devoit un peu plus etudier ces grands maitres, pour se corriger de ce defaut, qui rendra toujours le plus grand savoir inutile, ou au moins rude &amp; sec. Comme un homme delicat etanchera mille fois mieux sa soif, &amp; boira avec plus de goût &amp; de plaisir dans un ruisseau dont les eaux seront clairs &amp; pures, que dans un fleuve plein de bourbe &amp; de limon: tout de même, un esprit fin qui ne cherche que la justesse &amp; une certaine fleur de critique, trouvera bien mieux son compte dans ce petite traité d'Horace, qu'il ne le trouverait dans vingt volumes aussi enormes que la Poetique de Scaliger. On peut dire veritablement que celuy qui boit dans cette source pure, <HI>pleno se proluit auro;</HI> &amp; tant pis pour celuy qui ne sait pas le

connoistre. Pour moi j'en ai un tres grand cas, Je ne say fi j'auray esté assez heureux pour la bien éclaircir, &amp; pour en dissiper si bien toutes les dif∣ficultés, qu'il n'y en reste aucune. Les plus grandes de ces difficultés, viennent des passages qu'Horace a imité des Grecs, ou des allusions qu'il y a faites. Je puis dire au moins que je n'en ay laissé passer aucune sans l'attaquer; &amp; je pour∣rois me vanter,
<Q><L><HI>—nec tela nec ullas</HI></L>
<L><HI>Vitavisse vices Danaum.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>En general je puis dire que malgré la foule des Commentateurs &amp; des Traducteurs, Horace estoit tres-malentendu, &amp; que ses plus beaux endroits estoient défigurés par les mauvais sens qu'on leur avoit donnés jusques icy, &amp; il ne faut pas s'en étonner. La pluspart des gens ne reconnoissent pas tant l'autoritè de la raison que celle du grand nombre, pour laquelle ils ont un profond respect. Pour moy qui say qu'en matiere de critique on ne doit pas comptez les voix, mais les peser; j'avoüe que j'ay secoüé ce joug, <HI>&amp; que sans m'assujetir au sentiment de personne, j'ay tâché de suivre Ho∣race, &amp; de démêler ce qu'il a dit d'avec ce qu'on luy a fait dire.</HI> J'ay mesme toûjours remarqué
<PB N="151" REF="213"/>
&amp; j'en pourrois donner des exemples bien sensibles) que quand des esprits accoûtumés aux cordes, comme dit Montagne, &amp; qui n'osent tenter de franches allures, enterprennent de traduire &amp; de commenter ces excellens Ouvrages, <HI>où il y a plus de finesse &amp; plus de mystere qu'il n'en paroist,</HI> tout leur travail ne fait que les gâter, &amp; que la seule vertu qu'ayent leur copies, c'est de nous dégoûter presque des originaux. Comme j'ay pris la liberté de juger du travail de ceux qui m'ont précedé, &amp; que je n'ay pas fait difficulté de les condamner tres∣souvent, je declare que je ne trouveray nullement mauvais qu'on juge du mien, &amp; qu'on releve mes fautes: il est dissicile qu'il n'y en ait, &amp; mesme beaucoup; si quelqu'un veut donc se donner la peine de me reprendre, &amp; de me faire voir que j'ay mal pris le sens, je me corrigeray avec plaisir: car JE NE CHERCHE QUE LA VERITV'E, QUI N'A JA∣MAIS BLESS'E PERSONNE: AU LIEU QU'ON SE TROUVE TOUJOURS MAL DE PERSISTER DANS SON IGNORANCE ET DANS SON ERREUR.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE TO PHILASTER. Revived on the first Appearance of Mr. POWELL, Spoken by MR. KING. <DATE>MDCCLXIII.</DATE></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHILE Modern Tragedy, by rule exact,</L>
<L>Spins out a thin-wrought Fable, Act by Act,</L>
<L>We dare to bring you one of those bold Plays</L>
<L>Wrote by rough English Wits in former days;</L>
<L>Beaumont and Fletcher! those Twin Stars, that run</L>
<L>Their glorious course round Shakespeare's golden Sun;</L>
<L>Or when Philaster Hamlet's place supplied,</L>
<L>Or Bessus walk'd the Stage by Falstaff's side.</L>
<L>Their Souls, well-pair'd, shot fire in mingled rays,</L>
<L>Their hands together twin'd the social Bayes,</L>
<L>Till Fashion drove, in a refining age,</L>
<L>Virtue from Court, and Nature from the Stage.</L>
<L>Then Nonsense, in Heroicks, seem'd sublime;</L>
<L>Kings rav'd in couplets, and maids sigh'd in Rhime.</L>
<L>Next, prim, and trim, and delicate, and chaste,</L>
<L>A Hash from Greece and France, came Modern Taste.</L>
<L><PB N="172" REF="231"/>Cold are her sons, and so afraid of dealing</L>
<L>In Rant and Fustian, they ne'er rise to Feeling.</L>
<L>O say, ye Bards of Phlegm, say, where's the name</L>
<L>That can with Fletcher urge a rival claim?</L>
<L>Say, where's the Poet, train'd in Pedant Schools,</L>
<L>Equal to Shakespeare, who o'erleap'd all Rules?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus of our Bards, we boldly speak our mind;</L>
<L>A harder task, alas, remains behind:</L>
<L>To-night, as yet by publick eyes unseen,</L>
<L>A raw, unpractis'd Novice, fills the Scene.</L>
<L>Bred in the City, his Theatrick Star</L>
<L>Brings him at length, on this side Temple-Bar;</L>
<L>Smit with the Muse, the Ledger he forgot,</L>
<L><HI>And when he wrote his name, he made a blot.</HI></L>
<L>Him while perplexing hopes and fears embarrass,</L>
<L>Skulking (like Hamlet's Rat) <HI>behind the Arras,</HI></L>
<L>Me a Dramatick fellow-feeling draws,</L>
<L>Without a fee, to plead a Brother's Cause.</L>
<L>Genius is rare; and while our Great Comptroller,</L>
<L>No more a Manager, turns Arrant-Stroller,</L>
<L>Let new adventurers your care engage,</L>
<L>And nurse the Infant Saplings of the Stage!</L>

<L>A Sempstress? No. A Princess let me be,</L>
<L>In all the pomp and state of Tragedy!</L>
<L>A Princess, with a Page, and sweeping Train,</L>
<L>A Bowl, a Dagger, and a Lover slain!</L>
<L>Oh how I'll rant! how loud I'll be, and glibber</L>

<LG>
<L>WELCOME, ye Generous, Polite, and Fair,</L>
<L>Who to our lowly Roof this Night repair!</L>
<L>Who come, invited by our humble Bill,</L>
<L>To the Old Theatre on Richmond Hill;</L>
<L>Where to those guests, whose raste not over-nice is,</L>
<L>We serve up common fare—at common prices.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No Cornice here, no Frieze to feast your eyes,</L>
<L>No Galleries on Dorick Pillars rise;</L>
<L>No gaudy Paintings on the Roof we deal in,</L>
<L>To break your Necks with looking tow'rds the Cieling;</L>
<L>No Theatre we boast superbly built,</L>
<L>A Gingerbread Round O, a Cock-pit gilt;</L>
<L>But a plain Booth, of Boards ill put together,</L>
<L>To raise a Stage, and keep out Wind and Weather.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="177" REF="236"/>
<L>Yet here shall Heroes in their Buskins stalk,</L>
<L>And Shakespeare's Ghosts in this small Circle walk;</L>
<L>Here Tragedy shall take three narrow Strides;</L>
<L>And laughing Comedy hold both her Sides:</L>
<L>Here shall the Moor say—"Haply for I am black!"</L>
<L>And here plump Falstaff—"Give me a Cup of Sack,"</L>
<L>Here Bobadill shall don his dirty Buff,</L>
<L>And cry—"the Cabin is convenient enough."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ovid (by those who read him I am told)</L>
<L>Says, one Philemon feasted Jove of old:</L>
<L>With Flitch of Bacon did the God regale,</L>
<L>While Goody Baucis fill'd the Jug of Ale!</L>
<L>—For Baucis and Philemon, 'tis well Known,</L>
<L>Were of those days the Darby and Old Joan.—</L>
<L>In Wicker-Chair well-pleas'd the Thunderer sat,</L>
<L>Laugh'd, sung, drank, smok'd, and join'd their rustick chat:</L>
<L>The naked rafters view'd not with disdain,</L>
<L>Nor sat beneath the humble Thatch in pain.</L>

<L>Thus, while you deign to visit our poor Cottage,</L>

<L>WHEN frighten'd Poets give the Town a Play,</L>
<L>Some bold or gentle Prologue leads the way:</L>
<L>But when new Players their weak powers engage,</L>
<L>And risque their future fortunes on the stage;</L>
<L>No Bard appears to plead their desp'rate cause,</L>
<L>To silence censure, or bespeak applause.</L>
<L>Authors too cautious to direct your choice,</L>
<L>Mere empty echoes of the publick voice,</L>
<L>With less Poetick Fire than Critick Phlegm,</L>
<L>Praise as you praise, and blame what you condemn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Actors, as Actors feel; and few so fear'd,</L>
<L>But well remember when they first appear'd;</L>
<L>When sudden tumult shook the lab'ring breast,</L>

<L>When the big tear stood trembling in the eye,</L>
<L>And the breath struggled with the rising sigh.</L>

<L>Appears to spring, like Venus, from the sea.</L>
<L>Founded on Piles it rises from the strand,</L>

<L>Some nights ago our couple, all alone,</L>

<L>Frances, said Henry, give up writing! Men,</L>

<L>Your sex of late all decency confounds,</L>
<L>And breaks 'twixt us and them the modest bounds.</L>
<L>Whether from passion, love of pow'r or riches,</L>
<L>Women, we see, all love to wear the breeches.</L>
<L>At sea some madcaps enter volunteers,</L>
<L>Some in the army list as grenadiers!</L>

<L>Women in vain to keep their place have striven;</L>
<L>From ev'ry trade, from each profession driven.</L>
<L>Men-Midwives swarm; men mantuas make, make stays,</L>
<L>Dress hair, dress meat—let women then write plays!</L>
<L>While narrow prejudice deform'd the age,</L>
<L>No Actress play'd, no Female trod the Stage;</L>
<L>Some smooth unrazor'd youth for Juliet rav'd,</L>
<L>And kings sat waiting till the queen was shav'd;</L>

<LG>
<L>IN Fletcher's days it was the favourite plan</L>
<L>Of Woman to dethrone the tyrant Man:</L>
<L>Our modern Fashions vary—yet their aim,</L>
<L>Howe'er pursu'd appears the very same.</L>
<L>The Starch-Ruff'd Maidens of Queen Bess's reign</L>
<L>Were doom'd a Starch demeanour to maintain;</L>
<L>Quill'd up like Porcupines, they shot their darts,</L>
<L>Slaughter'd whole rows of Knights, and wounded Hearts:</L>
<L>Their Virtue nought could shake, no siege could alter:</L>
<L>A rock, impregnable as Gibraltar!</L>
<L>In vain were sighs, and tears, and idle flattery,</L>
<L>Their red-hot balls laid low each hostile battery,</L>
<L>While they, bright stars, above all weak comparison,</L>
<L>Shone forth the Female Eliotts of the Garrison.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The modern maiden finds things alter'd quite,</L>
<L>A hundred Danglers, not one faithful Knight!</L>
<L>Nor coy, nor cruel, all her charms display'd,</L>
<L>Coldly she's seen, and trusting she's betray'd:</L>
<L><PB N="238" REF="297"/>Unfeeling coxcombs scorn the damsels pow'r,</L>
<L>And pass in Rotten-Row the vacant hour.</L>
<L>The Fair, her power thus lost in single life,</L>
<L>Reserves her policy till made a Wife.</L>
<L>The humble married dames of Fletcher's day</L>
<L>Thought wives must love and honour and obey;</L>
<L>Bound in the nuptial ring, that hoop of Gold,</L>
<L>Enchain'd their passions, and their will controll'd.</L>
<L>Too oft the modern Miss, scarce made a bride,</L>
<L>Breaks out at once all insolence and pride:</L>
<L>Mounted in Phaeton she courts the eye,</L>
<L>And eats, and games, and paints, and dresses high:</L>
<L>Who shall say nay? Content to drink and play,</L>
<L>His Lordship cries—"My Lady, take your way!</L>
<L>I've fixt your box at the opera—but am vext</L>
<L>That Polly Brilliant could not get the next."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such was the rigid line of ancient rule,</L>
<L>And such the freedom of the Modern School:</L>
<L>Chuse which, ye Fair; or else, to copy loth,</L>
<L>Compose a new <HI>Pasticcio</HI> out of both;</L>
<L>Or smit with nobler pride, on Nature look,</L>
<L>And read the brightest pages of her book!</L>
<L>Would you a spotless maid, chaste wife be known,</L>
<L>Show the young Virtues ripening or full blown,</L>
<L>Mark how they prop, and dignify the Throne!</L>
<L>Rival Their goodness with a loyal strife,</L>

<LG>
<L>THE Bard, whose Tragick strains we now re∣hearse,</L>
<L>Hath often charm'd you with his varied verse;</L>
<L>Beguiling o'er his lines the vacant hour,</L>
<L>Oft have you felt and own'd his Muse's pow'r!</L>
<L>Now to this roof we bring his favour'd page,</L>
<L>And force him, half-reluctant, to the Stage;</L>
<L>The Stage, where those who simple Nature paint,</L>
<L>Fear lest their strokes, too faithful, seem too faint.</L>
<L>For here, the artist, with a desperate hand,</L>
<L>And broad pound-brush, not pencil, takes his stand;</L>
<L>Anxious to make his cloth at distance strike,</L>
<L>Daubs, in distemper—rather large than like.</L>
<L>Thron'd in high car, and usher'd by loud drums,</L>
<L>From Bedlam some great Alexander comes!</L>
<L>Appals with noise, and labours to surprise</L>
<L>" The very faculties of ears and eyes!"</L>
</LG>

<L>Yet Britons never have disdain'd to grace</L>
<L>The natural heroes of a milder race!</L>
<L>Cato's firm bosom, and expiring groan</L>
<L>For virtuous liberty, they made their own.</L>
<L>Yet Cato's steel but sign'd his country's fate;</L>
<L>For with him died, the freedom of the state!</L>
<L>Your own calm Russell, by his nobler end,</L>
<L>Freedom's mild Martyr, prov'd her firmest friend:</L>
<L>Rous'd by his fate, a band of heroes rose,</L>
<L>To sov'reign tyranny determin'd foes;</L>
<L>Champions of Faith and Law, their aweful stand</L>
<L>Chac'd bigotry and slav'ry from the land.</L>
<L>To vindicate an injur'd nation's claims,</L>
<L>Nassau and Brunswick join'd their glorious names!</L>
<L>To Britain her dear liberty ensur'd,</L>
<L>Stamp'd her Great Charter, and her rights secur'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To guard those rights, Old England's noblest pride,</L>
<L>To guard those rights, our gallant Russell died.</L>

<LG>
<L>OUR Manager, long since, a Connoisseur,</L>
<L>To gain full houses throws out many a Lure.</L>
<L>By novelty all rivalship to smother,</L>
<L>Play follows play—one just as good as t'other;</L>
<L>And now, to lull the Dragons of the Pit,</L>
<L>Two Connoisseurs take counsel, Wit with Wit.</L>
<L>As thieves catch thieves, so Poet convicts Poet;</L>
<L>Their plan's all wrong—and I must overthrow it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I am an author too, my name is Bayes;</L>
<L>My trade is scribbling; my chief scribbling, Plays.</L>
<L>Many I've written, clapp'd by houses cramm'd—</L>

<L>But ne'er tryed aught so Low, or so Sublime,</L>
<L>As Tragedy in Prose, or Comedy in Rhyme.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Comedy in Rhyme! the Thought's not new:</L>
<L>'Twas tried long since—and then it would not do.</L>
<L>What happy point the dialogue can crown,</L>
<L>Set to the hackneyed tune of Derry-down?</L>
<L><PB N="259" REF="318"/>What Pegasus in flight can reach the spheres,</L>
<L>With bells, like pack-horse, gingling at his ears?</L>
<L>Smart Prose gives hit for hit, and dash for dash,</L>
<L>Joke after joke, like lightening, flash on flash;</L>
<L>Retort so quick, and repartee so nimble,</L>
<L>'Tis all Prince Prettyman, and sharp Tom Thimble!</L>
<L>As the Piece stands, no Critick could endure it;</L>
<L>'Twould die, but Bayes has a receipt to cure it.</L>
<L>And little Bayes, egad, has long been known</L>
<L>To make the works of others, all his own.</L>
<L>Whate'er your piece—'tis mine if you rehearse it;</L>
<L>Verse I transprose; and if Prose, I transverse it.</L>
<L>Say but the word, I'll pull this Drama down,</L>
<L>And build it up again, to please the town.</L>
<L>The Thing's unfashion'd—yet it has some soul;</L>
<L>The Fable's neat,—the Characters are droll;</L>
<L>The Scope and Moral has a right intention,</L>
<L>And asks no added labour of invention.</L>
<L>Rhyme's the mere Superstructure; down it goes;</L>
<L>The old foundation shall support my Prose.</L>
<L>If here and there some sparks of genius shine,</L>
<L>I will not drop a Thought, nor lose a Line—</L>

<LG>
<L>WELL, sirs! our English Antients are agreed</L>
<L>A Maid of Honour, is a Maid indeed!</L>
<L>'Tis not alone, among the virgin band,</L>
<L>Demure behind the Chair of State to stand;</L>
<L>To groan beneath the labours of the loom,</L>
<L>A walking pageant of the Drawing Room;</L>
<L>To hear the small talk of small lords in waiting,</L>
<L>Or trifle with White Wands, inclin'd to prating;</L>
<L>No! 'tis her province, firmly to support,</L>
<L>Intrench'd in the strong fences of a Court,</L>
<L>That citadel, where thousand dangers wait,</L>
<L>And Female Honour holds her aweful state!</L>
<L>Harmless, with busy hum and empty sound,</L>
<L>The silken Court-Flies buz and flutter round;</L>
<L>They, like Fulgentio, are with scorn dismist,</L>
<L>So weak, 'tis scarce a triumph to resist.</L>
<L><PB N="262" REF="321"/>But when Bertoldos, true blood Royal, vie—</L>
<L>Then, then's the glorious effort to deny!</L>
<L>To prove with all a woman's graces on her,</L>
<L>She's still a Maid, a real <HI>Maid of Honour!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, ah! Camiola, thy fate was hard!</L>
<L>Severe the sentence of our rigid Bard!</L>
<L>What! nip a beauteous maiden in her bloom,</L>
<L>And in a convent all her charms entomb!</L>
<L>Consign her fortune, blast her bud of youth,</L>
<L>Though one swain's Falsehood proves another's Truth;</L>
<L>While she, like Cato, finds from each adorer</L>
<L>" Her Bane and Antidote are both before her!</L>

<L>Sicilian Maids of Honour thus were undone—</L>
<L>Ah, Maids of Honour act not thus in London!</L>
<L>Here, in chaste dew sweet roses hail the morn,</L>
<L>Undoom'd to wither on the virgin thorn.</L>
<L>Stern Romish doctrines, strict Italian rules,</L>
<L>Suit not the freedom of our British schools:</L>
<L>Our wiser Law a sager code exhibits;</L>
<L>Our milder Church such sacrifice prohibits.</L>
<L>Should some false lord, betroth'd, his contract break,</L>
<L>And at the altar's foot the maid forsake,</L>
<L><PB N="263" REF="322"/>In comes the Serjeant to distrain his lands—</L>

<L>Here takes those <HI>Thirds</HI> our Maid of Honour leaves.</L>
<L>Not Rome herself so dreadfully enthralls:</L>

<L>LADIES and Gentlemen, <HI>I'll tell you what!</HI></L>
<L>Yet not, like Ancient Prologue, tell the plot—</L>
<L>But, like a Modern Prologue, try each way</L>
<L>To win your favour towards the coming play.</L>

<LG>
<L>Our author is a Woman; that's a charm,</L>
<L>Of power to guard Herself and Play from harm.</L>
<L>The Muses, Ladies-Regent of the Pen,</L>
<L>Grant women skill, and force, to write like men.</L>
<L>Yet They, like the Aeolian Maid of old,</L>
<L>Their Sex's Character will ever hold;</L>
<L>Not with bold Quill too roughly strike the lyre,</L>
<L>But with the Feather raise a soft desire.</L>
</LG>

<L>Our Poetess has gain'd sublimest heights!</L>

<L>For She, bright spirit, the first British fair,</L>

<L>MALE Criticks applaud to the skies the Male Scribblers;</L>
<L>When a Woman attempts they turn carpers and nibblers:</L>
<L>But a true patriot Female, there's nothing so vexes</L>
<L>As this haughty pre-eminence claim'd 'twixt the sexes.</L>
<L>The free spirit revolts at each hard proposition,</L>
<L>And meets the whole system with loud opposition.</L>
<L>Men, 'tis true, in their noddles, huge treasures may hoard;</L>
<L>But the heart of a Woman with <HI>Passions</HI> is stor'd:</L>
<L>With Passions, not copied from Latin or Greek,</L>
<L>Which the language of Nature, in plain English speak.</L>
<L>Girls, who grieve, or rejoice, from true feeling as I do,</L>
<L>Never dream of Calypso, or Helen, or Dido.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="267" REF="326"/>
<L>To the end of our life, from the hour we begin it,</L>
<L>Woman's Fate all depends on <HI>the Critical Minute!</HI></L>
<L>A Minute, unknown to the dull pedant tribe,</L>
<L>And which never feeling, they never describe.</L>
<L>'Tis no work of Science, or sparkle of Wit,</L>
<L>But a point which mere Nature must teach us to hit;</L>
<L>And which, in the changes and turns of my story,</L>
<L>A weak Woman's Pen has to-night laid before ye.</L>
<L>And say, ye grave Prudes! gay Coquettes too, ah, say,</L>
<L>What <HI>a Critical Minute</HI> was mine in the Play!</L>
<L>Here Poverty, Famine, and Shame, and Reproach!</L>
<L>There Plenty and Ease, and a Lord, and a Coach!</L>
<L>But perhaps our Bard held Mrs. Euston too mean,</L>
<L>And conceiv'd her disgrace would but lower the Scene:</L>
<L>Let us then, better pleas'd, to acquit than convict her,</L>
<L>On the ground of High Life, sketch the very same Picture!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Imagine some Fair plung'd in modish distress!</L>
<L>Her wants not less than mine, nor her agony less!</L>
<L>At Hazard, suppose, an unfortunate cast</L>
<L>Has swept her last guinea, nay more than her last!</L>
<L>Her diamonds all mortgag'd, her equipage sold,</L>
<L>Her husband undone, genteel friends looking cold!</L>
<L>At her feet his sweet person Lord Foppington throws,</L>
<L>The most handsome of Nobles, the richest of Beaux!</L>
<L><PB N="268" REF="327"/>At once too his love and his bounty dispenses,</L>
<L>Sooths with Thousands her grief, lulls with Flatt'ry her senses!</L>
<L>Alas! what a Minute! ah! what can be done?</L>
<L>All means must be tried, and our Drama shows one.</L>
<L>Let Papa in that Minute, that so frowns upon her,</L>
<L>Redeem the vile debts that encumber her Honour!</L>
<L>Let Papa in that Minute, that teems with undoing,</L>
<L>Step in, like my Father, and mar a Lord's wooing!</L>
<L>Let her know, as I've known, all the horror that's in it,</L>
<L>And feel the true force of <HI>the Critical Minute!</HI></L>

<L>No Lovers here, contending for a Wife,</L>

<L>No Julia here should find her virgin fame</L>
<L>Arraign'd for crimes she shudders but to name;</L>
<L>Safe from such horrors in a generous nation,</L>
<L>Where Madness only dreams Assassination.</L>
<L>No! tho' the moonlight walk, and precious Picture,</L>

<L>Tried, fairly tried, in our High Court of Drury,</L>
<L>She'll stand acquitted by an English Jury.</L>

<L>Wise was the man, who each returning morn</L>
<L>Thank'd his kind stars he was in England born;</L>
<L>And wiser still the Fair, that lot possessing,</L>
<L>Who proves she knows the value of the Blessing:</L>
<L>With pity who beholds poor Julia's fate,</L>
<L>Yet prizes, as she ought, <HI>her</HI> happier state;</L>

<P>☞ I did not know that the pen of Malice or Slander had ascribed the suppression of this Epilogue at the Theatre to the pretended <HI>Indelicacy</HI> of its

contents, till I had seen the generous Vindication of it by another hand. The Epilogue was written at the particular instance of a very worthy friend of Mr. Jephson, by whom and by the author it was received with cordial thanks and the warmest appro∣bation. Mrs. Siddons however seeming to expect the Epilogue, her Importance to the Piece rendered the friends of the Author unwilling to question her Claim, and a few alterations were made in the in∣troductory lines, which the change of the Supposed Speaker required.—<HI>Supposed,</HI> for Mrs. Siddons, after keeping the Epilogue some days, returned it with a declaration that she would not speak it; and a request of another. The alterations, with an ad∣ditional couplet, occurred between the 6th and 13th lines, and are here subjoined with the variations printed in Italicks.</P>

<LG>
<L>SINCE the new post-horse tax, I dare engage</L>
<L>That some folks here have travell'd in the Stage:</L>
<L>Jamm'd in at midnight, in cold winter weather,</L>
<L>The crouded passengers are glew'd together.</L>
<L>O'er many a rut, and ill-pav'd causeway jumbling,</L>
<L>They pass their Journey, justling, jolting, grumbling.</L>
<L>Sometimes a pleasing prospect strikes the eye,</L>
<L>Sometimes they chuckle when a good inn's nigh;</L>
<L>'Till many a squabble, some endearments past,</L>
<L>They part well-pleas'd, and with regret at last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So in our Stage, in which this Christmas Tide</L>
<L>As inside passengers you've deign'd to ride,</L>
<L>You thought yourselves perhaps not well convey'd,</L>
<L>The cattle broken-winded, roads ill made;</L>
<L>Yet fond of travel, some kind looks you bend</L>
<L>Tow'rds fellow trav'llers at your journey's end.</L>

<LG>
<L>May each, whom pleasure call'd awhile to roam,</L>
<L>Find double pleasure when arriv'd at home!</L>
<L><PB N="284" REF="343"/>May each kind husband meet a wife more kind,</L>
<L>And each fond wife a fonder husband find!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Meanwhile, Oh, think not <HI>Us</HI> beneath your care,</L>
<L>Nor drive your humble drivers to despair!</L>
<L>Shall Posthumus, his Imogen restor'd,</L>
<L>Be doom'd to wail his destiny deplor'd?</L>
<L>Shall Jachimo, who oft your cares beguil'd,</L>

<L>Each damns alike his neighbour's want of Taste.</L>
<L>One thro' the Devils-Ditch pursues the Race,</L>
<L>One breaks his neck in following the Chace;</L>
<L>Come, here' sa Bumper! says Sir John, half drunk,</L>
<L>Damn ye, d'ye flinch? have ye no Soul, no Spunk?</L>
<L>Away with business, and confound all thinking,</L>
<L>No joy in life to be compar'd to drinking!</L>

<L>Yes, says Lord Feeble, verging on threescore,</L>
<L>I like a Bottle, but I love a Whore!</L>
<L>For me I left poor little Sally weeping,</L>

<L>Stick you to Bacchus, and I'll stick to Venus,</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<L>I Am a poor Strolling Player—and my hapless condition</L>
<L>Obliges me to wait upon you with my Humble Petition.</L>
<L>Thro' England, South Wales, and North Wales,</L>
<L>I have travell'd many years since,</L>
<L>And represented Lover and Hero, Wit and Fool,</L>
<L>Statesman and Cuckold, Beggar and Prince;</L>
<L>Nay more than Roscius, Betterton, Booth, or Garrick himself could say,</L>
<L>I have acted every part—women as well as men—every part in every play.</L>
<L>Not long ago, at Oswestry, we did the falchion wield:</L>
<L>Now near this place we pitch our tent—very near here—even in Wrexham <HI>Field</HI>;</L>
<L>By Metaphor I say <HI>Field,</HI> for in fact, at a very great expence,</L>
<L>We have fitted up the Town Hall, and (for the first time) made it the Theatre of Common Sense.</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="347"/>Our bills all honestly paid, now new dangers we essay!</L>
<L>Rival Strollers have arisen, and are resolv'd to exhibit at Wynnstay:</L>
<L>And what I am sure in our cause will make you very hearty,</L>
<L>The little Manager from the Hay-market is one of the party.</L>
<L>They call themselves <HI>Gentlemen</HI> indeed, but still I say so much the worse!</L>
<L>For when Gentlemen act unlike Gentlemen, 'tis a private and a publick curse.</L>
<L>Why should a Gentleman pretend to more than he understands,</L>
<L>Take the bread out of our mouths, and our trade out of our hands?</L>
<L>All arts are best executed by the artists themselves;</L>
<L>Gentlemen Artists are mostly mere Dabblers and ignorant Elves.</L>
<L>Says Sir John, his round hat on his head, a Quid in his mouth, and long Whip in his hand,</L>
<L>I'll drive you, my Dear! at the door see the horses and Phaeton stand!</L>
<L>From high steps to the Chaise Sir John and the Lady mount three pair of stairs,</L>
<L>While the Mob in the street at the Cavalcade stares.</L>
<L><PB N="289" REF="348"/>Chuck, chuck!—off they go!—Jehu! oight, oight! till at some sudden pitch,</L>
<L>Sir John and the Lady come souse in a ditch.</L>
<L>Such are Baronet Drivers! and thus Country Squires hunt a pack, or ride matches;</L>
<L>Thus Generals write plays, and thus Nobles sing Catches,</L>
<L>Thus to-night a Welch Baronet and his Friends give a play,</L>
<L>And promise Dramaticks for the whole week to come at Wynnstay.</L>
<L>With <HI>Rule a Wife and Have a Wife</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Entertainments of the Season.</NOTE> they mean to make you sick,</L>
<L>And turn <HI>Shakespeare's Great Richard</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Entertainments of the Season.</NOTE> to tiny King <HI>Dick.</HI></L>
<L>Of <HI>BonTon</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Entertainments of the Season.</NOTE> they'll give you much more than you desire,</L>
<L>And when they promise entertainment no doubt they'll play the <HI>Liar!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Entertainments of the Season.</NOTE></L>
<L>But, after all, Ladies and Gentlemen, Peace is our plan,</L>
<L>And we wish to compromise this matter, if we can.</L>
<L>They have given some reasons which I think will hold water—</L>
<L>They have had a Christening it seems, and Sir</L>
<L>Watkin has got another daughter.</L>
<L><PB N="290" REF="349"/>Besides, the Former Worthy Mistress of this place</L>
<L>Now deigns, with her presence, their Gambols to grace.</L>
<L>Since the Country's call'd in we're determin'd not to vex 'em,</L>
<L>And so for this week have shut up our fine Theatre at Wrexham:</L>
<L>But since for this week we agree to lie mum,</L>
<L>You'll <HI>fill</HI> us, no doubt, for a fortnight to come.</L>
