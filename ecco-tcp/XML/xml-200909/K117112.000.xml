<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>SOME apology may be required for my making so free with an old favourite of yours. So many of you as are in the habit of admiring the <HI>sublime performances</HI> of our English Pindar, will, do doubt, exclaim against me for assigning a post at Court, the most humiliating of all others, to your darling Poet. But this is the very thing I intended: for this favourite of yours (like many other favourites) has been spoiled by too much indulgence, and is grown so intolerably saucy, that he ought to be taken down a little. But there may be others among you who will acknowledge P. Pindar to be fair game, and who may say that this gentle castigation is not half so much as he deserves for that impudent mockery and caricature which he has so often pointed at his S—n. To all such, it may not be amiss to intimate, that I have another birch in soak for Master Peter, which, I think, will give him a smart flagellation. The few lines which I now hazard the publication of, are only meant as preparatory to the introduction of this other labour of my sportive Muse, provided that I find this my first essay is tolerably well received, and that it is acknowledged to be of sufficient merit to intitle me, in some small degree, to the signa∣ture of</P>

<HEAD>SOP IN THE PAN, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<L>HAIL! funny Bard, of never-ceasing lay,</L>
<L>To Chelt'nham's fav'rite fountain speed thy way.</L>
<L>Where'er thy commons be, and mimic joke,</L>
<L>Whether with guzzling cits 'midst London smoke,</L>
<L>Or, far remov'd to thy own native moors,</L>
<L>With Cornish tinners, 'squires, or hugging boors;</L>
<L>Or whether thou'rt still at thy old fav'rite sport,</L>
<L>Eaves-dropping slily at St. James's Court,</L>
<L>To catch another Kitchen Tale,</L>
<L>In Ode Pindaric to retail;</L>
<L>Where'er this friendly call may find thee,</L>
<L>Quick, mount thy Pegasus, and take thy muse behind thee;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>(Not winged Pegasus in Poet's Fable,</L>
<L>But hackney Pegasus in liv'ry stable)</L>
<L>And whilst thou'rt jogging on the turn-pike road,</L>
<L>Set all thy brains at work to hatch a merry Ode</L>
<L>To tickle thy lov'd King</L>
<L>At Chelt'nham's purging spring:</L>
<L>So shall thy Muse the royal favour gain,</L>
<L>And give thee rank among the courtly train;</L>
<L>That rank for which, sure, Fate and Nature fram'd thee,</L>
<L>Since neither stocks nor pillory has claim'd thee.</L>
<L>Yes, witty Peter,</L>
<L>Thy merry metre,</L>
<L>If right I ween, will very soon</L>
<L>Exalt thee to be Court Buffoon,</L>
<L>With title and with pension,</L>
<L>And all that thou canst wish or mention.</L>
<L>No more Pindaric Ballads shalt thou sing,</L>
<L>Which poor, precarious, scanty dinner bring</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>To meagre Poetaster;</L>
<L>But pamper'd, courtly songster shalt thou be,</L>
<L>Of jolly plight, and full of heart-felt glee,</L>
<L>The darling of thy Master.</L>
<L>Thus when the K—g,</L>
<L>From Chelt'nham spring,</L>
<L>To Cloacina's temple shall repair</L>
<L>To pour the due libation,</L>
<L>His funny fav'rite only shall attend him there,</L>
<L>To help the operation.</L>
<L>Nor, faithless, thou this presage deem</L>
<L>Delusive sport of Poet's dream;</L>
<L>For whilst thy brother Bard of late</L>
<L>On Cloacina's tripod sat,</L>
<L>My fancy wand'ring to and fro,</L>
<L>I heard these accents rumble in the vault below.</L>
<L>"Haste thee Bard of funny lay,</L>

<L>The sounds which struck my ravish'd ear</L>
<L>Were more than mortal lugs could bear.</L>
<L>I sat amaz'd,</L>
<L>I gasp'd, I gaz'd,</L>
<L>So wond'rous was the strain,</L>
<L>It almost crack'd my brain.</L>
<L>My soul was struck with dire affray,</L>
<L>I button'd up and ran away.</L>
<L>Now, Peter, if thou'lt not believe this true,</L>
<L>Then, Peter, thou'rt an unbelieving Jew;</L>
<L>But if thou art a Jew, it may be prov'd from hence,</L>
<L>That thou art circumcis'd, by plainest consequence.</L>
<L>This thou know'st best, and 'tis thy own affair,</L>
<L>For, circumcis'd or not, I very little care.</L>
<L>But what I say is true as true can be,</L>
<L>And if thou'lt not believe, then hear and see.</L>

<L>Now, Peter, run with utmost speed,</L>
<L>To help thy K—g in time of need.</L>
<L>Put thy better foot before,</L>
<L>As thou didst in days of yore,</L>
<L>In thy youthful occupation;</L>
<L>Whether some pregnant Cornish dame,</L>

<L>Not one of all my subjects do I know</L>
<L>So fit to fill this pretty post as thou.</L>
<L>Act well thy part in this, and by and by</L>
<L>In other points thy talents I may try.</L>
<L>But, for the present, this will suit thee best,</L>
<L>'Twill give thee scope for many a merry jest;</L>
<L>For well I know that ev'ry thing thou'lt tell,</L>
<L>To make the people laugh at C—m well.</L>
<L>But, Peter, in this fun of thine there are</L>
<L>Some things in which thy jokes are push'd too far.</L>
<L>My r—l speech to make the ridicule</L>
<L>Of ev'ry little silly grinning fool;—</L>
<L>My words of Majesty for thee to play with,</L>
<L>Are liberties I neither can nor will away with.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>I fear thou'lt turn out one of that vile sort</L>

<L>Who wear our livery suits and spite us,</L>

<L>O, good my Liege, let me, your slave,</L>
<L>In humblest wise your pardon crave:</L>
<L>Perish that rhyme and doggrel jest,</L>
<L>If aught offends your r—l breast.</L>
<L>But, Sire, if you'll believe me,</L>
<L>You widely misconceive me,</L>
<L>Or else some courtier's envious tongue</L>
<L>Has done your slave this mighty wrong.</L>
<L>Where'er your sacred speech I quoted,</L>
<L>And in Pindarics fondly noted,</L>
<L>My sole intention was to prove</L>
<L>My zeal, my loyalty and love.</L>
<L>Of friends and lovers 'tis the usual way</L>
<L>To speak of all their fav'rites do and say,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>Of ev'ry little pleasing anecdote to tell,</L>

<L>How wond'rous wise and quick your questions flow,</L>
<L>To make your loving subjects all rejoice</L>
<L>To hear the pleasing echo of your voice,</L>
<L>For which, believe me, there is such demand,</L>
<L>From folks of all degrees throughout the land,</L>
<L>That Kearsley's presses groan both night and day,</L>
<L>And his poor Dev'ls have neither rest nor play.</L>
<L>Ev'n subterraneous tinners club their groats,</L>
<L>And hungry Scotchmen sell their very oats,</L>
<L>To purchase this delicious treat,</L>
<L>For which they gladly forfeit drink and meat.</L>
<L>O, if you knew how well your subjects love you,</L>
<L>I'm sure it would with joy and transport move you.</L>

<L>Peter, I fear, in coming to this water,</L>
<L>Thou'lt void thy wit, and only learn to flatter.</L>
<L>Already, I perceive, thou'st got thy cue,</L>
<L>I guess, from some of my St. J—s's crew.</L>
<L>But think not thou t' obtain my favour</L>
<L>By words of such insipid favour.</L>
<L>Think'st thou I'm hither for palaver come,</L>
<L>With which, thou know'st, I'm surfeited at home?</L>
<L>'Twas not for this thou heard'st me say</L>
<L>Funny Peter, haste and come away;</L>

<L>O come to meet thy lov'd and loving K—g.</L>
<L>Whilst here I live in vacant ease,</L>

<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>Whilst here I purge away my gout and bile,</L>
<L>Thy merry jests shall tickle me the while.</L>

<L>A witty and facetious rogue,</L>
<L>So full of humour and of comic matter,</L>
<L>Thy fun promotes the passage of this water.</L>

<L>Peter, leave off that hasty way of speaking,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>G—e.</SPEAKER>
<L>Aye, very like; for mocking's catching, I've heard say.</L>
<L>But let's digress no farther, lest we lose our way.</L>
<L>Now, Peter, know it is our r—l will,</L>
<L>That thou this merry office shalt fulfil.</L>
<L>In rhyme or prose display thy future jest;</L>
<L>But rhyme thou'st us'd me to, and so I like that best.</L>

<L>I long to put thy talents to the test,</L>
<L>And from thy answers now, I'll judge of all the rest.</L>
<L>Now, Peter, truths there are, I hear,</L>
<L>Deep lodg'd in courtly well,</L>
<L>Which seldom come to Princes' ear,</L>

<L>True, Peter, true; 'tis even so;</L>

<L>They taste of all my store</L>

<L>They're just like all my former friends,</L>

<L>O yes, I will, my Liege, and in a trice.</L>
<L>When saucy servants give themselves such airs,</L>

<L>Why, Peter, thy advice is full and round,</L>
<L>But whether altogether safe and sound,</L>

<L>When I have slept upon't.</L>

<L>I only wish your happiness and glory.</L>
<L>To me it matters not who guides the helm,</L>
