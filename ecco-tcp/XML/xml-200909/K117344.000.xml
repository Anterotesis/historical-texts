<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE ground which is described in the following Sheets, has been for some centuries passed over by the incurious Traveller; and has had the hard for∣tune of being constantly execrated for its dulness. To retort the charge, and clear it from the calumny, is my present business. To shew that the road itself, or its vicinity, is replete with either antient historic facts, or with matter worthy of present attention; is an affair of no great difficulty. Possibly my readers may sub∣scribe to the opinion, that the tract is not absolutely devoid of entertainment, and that the blame rests on themselves, not the country.</P>
<P>WHATSOEVER entertainment they may meet with, let them join with me in thanks to the following contri∣butors. Firstly and chiefly, to the Reveread Mr. COLE
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
of <HI>Milton,</HI> near <HI>Cambridge;</HI> after him, to the Reverend Doctor <HI>Edwards,</HI> of <HI>Nuneaton,</HI> near <HI>Coventry;</HI> to Mr. <HI>Greene,</HI> Surgeon, in <HI>Lichfield;</HI> and to the Reverend Arch∣deacon <HI>Coxe,</HI> of <HI>Flitton, Bedfordshire.</HI> To these Gentle∣men I owe great obligations for their assistance.</P>
<P>PUBLIC! smile on what is right: candidly convey cor∣rection of what is wrong.</P>

<HEAD>THE JOURNEY TO LONDON.</HEAD>
<P>IN MARCH 1780, I began my annual journey to <HI>London.</HI> At <HI>Chester</HI> some improvements had taken place since my last ac∣count of the city. A very commodious building has been erected in the <HI>Yatchfield,</HI> near the <HI>Watergate</HI> street, for the sale of the <HI>Irish</HI> linen at the two fairs. It surrounds a large square area; on each side of which are piazzas, with numbers of shops well adapted for the purpose.</P>
<P>IN digging the foundation for certain houses near the street, were discovered some <HI>Roman</HI> buildings, and a large <HI>Hypocaust</HI> with its several conveniences; and some other antiquities, par∣ticularly a beautiful altar <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Engraven in <HI>Moses Griffith</HI>'s Supplemental Plates to the Tours in <HI>Wales,</HI> tab. X.</NOTE>, dedicated <HI>Fortunae Reduci</HI> et <HI>Aesculapio.</HI> Much of its inscription is defaced; but the rudder, cornucopia, rod, serpent, and various sacrificial instruments, are in good pre∣servation.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7"/>
ON leaving the city, I passed under the fine arch of the East Gate: a work owing to the munificence of Lord <HI>Grosvenor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boughton,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">BOUGHTON.</NOTE> a suburb in the parish of St. <HI>Oswald,</HI> a little dis∣joined from this part of the city, had before the dissolution an hospital <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 65.</NOTE> for poor lepers, as early as the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> II. From an eminence, the retreat of the unfortunate brave, is a view of very uncommon beauty; of two fine reaches of the <HI>Dee,</HI> bounded on one part by meadows and hanging woods; on the other terminated by part of the city, the antient bridge, and over it a distant view of the <HI>Cambrian hills.</HI></P>
<P>ADJOINING to that part of <HI>Boughton</HI> which is within the liber∣ties of the city, is the township of <HI>Boughton,</HI> in the county of <HI>Chester;</HI> the inhabitants of which appear at the court of the dean and chapter of <HI>Chester,</HI> and pay there a chief rent: but usually clame and dispose of the wastes.</P>
<P>NEAR the two miles stone I crossed the canal to <HI>Christleton,</HI> a pretty village, seated, as usual with those of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> on the free∣stone rock. <HI>Cristetone,</HI> as it is called in the <HI>Doomsday</HI> book, was held before the Conquest by Earl <HI>Edwin.</HI> At that event, pro∣bably, it had a chapel, or very soon after. This manor had been bestowed by <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> on <HI>Robert Fitz Hugh,</HI> one of his follow∣ers, who gave the chapel of <HI>Cristentune,</HI> with the land belonging to it, and the land of a certain peasant, with the peasant himself, to the abbey of <HI>Chester</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale</HI> Mon. i. 201.</NOTE>. His great great grand-daughter <HI>Isabel,</HI> wife of Sir <HI>Philip Burnet,</HI> joined with her husband in suing the abbey for this, and some other contiguous manors. It is pro∣bable, that the monks might have taken an advantage of a fit of
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
remorse for some crime, or the weakness of an illness, to obtain this gift from her ancestor. They thought fit to compromise the matter with her; and on payment of two hundred pounds re∣ceived, in 1280, the ninth of <HI>Edward</HI> I. a confirmation of the grant: and at the same time full liberty was given to the abbot to make a reservoir of water, and to convey it to the abbey.</P>
<P>IN the year 1282, <NOTE PLACE="marg">FREE WARREN.</NOTE> <HI>William de Birmingham</HI> had <HI>free warren</HI> given him of all his demesne lands in this village; but it is appre∣hended he was only an inferior lord to the paramount privileges of the abbey. In the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, every man was allowed to kill game on his own estate, but on the Conquest, the king vested the property of all the game in himself, so that no one could sport, even on his own land, under most cruel penalties, without permission from the king, by grant of a chase or <HI>free warren.</HI> By this, the grantee had an exclusive power of killing game on his own estate, but it was on condition that he prevented every one else; so that, as our learned commentator <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judge BLACKSTONE.</NOTE> observes, this seeming favor was intended for the preservation of the beasts and fowls of <HI>warren;</HI> which were roes, hares, and rabbits, partridge, rails, and quails, woodcocks and pheasants, mallards and herons, for the sport of our savage monarchs. This liberty, which they allowed to a few individuals, being designed merely to prevent a general destruction.</P>
<P><HI>Christleton</HI> passed from the <HI>Birminghams,</HI> in <HI>Richard</HI> II.'s time; to Sir <HI>Hugh Brower:</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> lost it by his attachment to the house of <HI>York;</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth, in the fourth year of his reign, be∣stowed it on <HI>John Manwaring,</HI> of <HI>Over Peover,</HI> an attendant on his
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
son, afterwards <HI>Henry</HI> V <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leicester,</HI> 333.</NOTE>. <HI>Manwaring</HI> having no lawful issue, bestowed this place on Sir <HI>Thomas le Grosvenor,</HI> lord of <HI>Hulme;</HI> but it passed immediately from him to <HI>John de Macclesfield,</HI> in the 10th of <HI>Henry</HI> V. One of his descendants alienated it, in 1442, or the 21st of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. to <HI>Humphrey</HI> (afterward Duke) of <HI>Buck∣ingham. Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Stafford,</HI> son to <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham,</HI> sold it to Sir <HI>William Sneyde,</HI> of <HI>Keel;</HI> and Sir <HI>Ralph Sneyde,</HI> to Sir <HI>John Harpur,</HI> of <HI>Swerston,</HI> in <HI>Derbyshire;</HI> one of whose de∣scendants sold it to <HI>Thomas Brock,</HI> Esquire, the present lord of the manor. The living is a rectory, in the disposal of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn:</HI> the church dedicated to St. <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>FROM hence I took the horse-road across <HI>Brownheath,</HI> by <HI>Hoc∣kenball,</HI> formerly the seat of a family of the same name. The rising country to the left of this road appears to great advantage, opposing to the traveller a fair front, beautifully clumped with, self-planted groves.</P>
<P>PASSED over a brook, and reached the small town of <HI>Tarvin,</HI> which still retains nearly its <HI>British</HI> name <HI>Terfŷn,</HI> or the <HI>Boundary,</HI> and is so to the forest of <HI>Delamere.</HI> In Doomsday book, it is stiled <HI>Terve:</HI> the bishop at that time held it. It then contained six taxable hides of land. The bishop kept on it six cowmen, three radmen, seven villeyns, seven boors, and six ploughlands. The first were to keep his cattle; the second to attend his person in his travels, or to go wheresoever he pleased to send them; the third, by their tenure, to cultivate his lands; and the fourth, to supply his table with poultry, eggs, and other small matters. The <HI>ploughland,</HI> or <HI>caruca,</HI> was as much as one plough could
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
work in the year. This shews the establishment of a manor in those early times; which I mention now to prevent repetition.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Henry</HI> VI.'s time, the village and manor were estimated at £23 a year, and were held by <HI>Reginald,</HI> bishop of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> in the same manner as they were held by his predecessors, under the <HI>Prince of Wales,</HI> as earl of <HI>Chester.</HI> They continued possessed by them till the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when they were alienated to Sir <HI>John Savage,</HI> who procured for the town the privilege of a market. The church is a rectory, and still continues part of the see of <HI>Lichfield;</HI> being a prebendary, originally founded about the year 1226, by <HI>Alexander de Stavenby,</HI> bishop of that diocese. It is valued at £26. 13<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> the highest endowment of any prebend in that cathedral. It is called the prebend of <HI>Tarvin,</HI> which presents to the living.</P>
<P>THE same prelate also bestowed this church on the vice-pre∣bendal church of <HI>Burton,</HI> in <HI>Wiral</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra, i. 446.</NOTE>; and formed out of its reve∣nues an hospital for shipwrecked persons. This hospital was pro∣bably at <HI>Burton, Tarvin</HI> being too remote from the sea for so hu∣mane a design.</P>
<P>AGAINST the church-wall is a monument, in memory of Mr. <HI>John Thomasine,</HI> thirty-six years master of the grammar-school. The epitaph deservedly celebrates the performances of this ex∣quisite penman, as <Q>highly excelling in all the varieties of writ∣ing, and wonderfully so in the <HI>Greek</HI> characters. Specimens of his ingenuity are treasured up, not only in the cabinets of the curious, but in public libraries throughout the kingdom. He had the honour to transcribe, for her Majesty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
the <HI>Icon Basilike</HI> of her royal grandfather. Invaluable copies also of <HI>Pindar, Anacreon, Theocritus, Epictetus, Hippocrates</HI>'s <HI>Aphorisms,</HI> and that finished piece the <HI>Shield of Achilles,</HI> as de∣scribed by <HI>Homer,</HI> are among the productions of his celebrated pen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As his incomparable performances acquired him the esteem and patronage of the great and learned; so his affability and humanity gained him the good-will of all his acquaintance; and the decease of so much private worth is regretted as a pub∣lic loss.</Q></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Tarvin</HI> I travel on the great road, and at about two miles distance, leave on the right <HI>Stapleford,</HI> which retains the name it had at the Conquest, when it was held by <HI>Radulpus Venator</HI> from <HI>Hugh Lupus.</HI> After a long interval, it fell to the <HI>Breretons.</HI> In 1378, or the second of <HI>Richard</HI> II. it was held by Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> of the king, as earl of <HI>Chester.</HI> From that family it passed to the <HI>Bruyns,</HI> and was purchased by the late <HI>Randle Wil∣braham,</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P>Two miles farther, on the left, stood <HI>Utkinton Hall:</HI> the ma∣nor, with <HI>Kingsley,</HI> and the baileywick of the forest of <HI>Delamere,</HI> was given by <HI>Randle Meschines,</HI> earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> to <HI>Randle de Kingsley;</HI> whose great grand-daughter <HI>Joan,</HI> about the year 1233, conveyed it to the <HI>Dones. Richard Done</HI> was possessed of it in 1311, the sixth of <HI>Edward</HI> II. He held it by a quarter part of a knight's fee, and the master forestership of <HI>Mere (Delamere)</HI> and <HI>Mottram,</HI> by himself, and a horseman and eight footmen under him, to keep that forest, then valued at £10. 10<HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the failure of issue male of Sir <HI>John Done,</HI> in the begin∣ning of the last century, the manor of <HI>Utkinton</HI> came to his
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
daughters, and has been since held by them, or persons claming under them. <HI>Mary,</HI> the second daughter, married, in 1636, <HI>John,</HI> second son of Sir <HI>Randle Crew,</HI> of <HI>Crew;</HI> and <HI>Elinor,</HI> the younger, to <HI>Ralph Arderne,</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dones</HI> of <HI>Flaxyard,</HI> in this neighbourhood, were another considerable family, at constant feud with the former, till the houses were united by the nuptials of the heir of <HI>Flaxyard</HI> with the heiress of <HI>Utkinton.</HI> But at this time, both those antient seats are demolished, or turned into farm-houses.</P>
<P>FROM hence I soon reached <HI>Torporley,</HI> a small town, seated on a gentle descent. It had once been a borough town, of which <HI>Richard Francis</HI> was mayor in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> I. In the tenth of the same reign, <HI>Hugh de Tarpoley</HI> had licence to hold a market here every <HI>Tuesday,</HI> and a fair on the vigil, the feast-day, and the day after the exaltation of the <HI>Holy Cross;</HI> but he alienated this privilege, with his property, to <HI>Reginald de Grey,</HI> chief justice of <HI>Chester.</HI></P>
<P>IN the eighth of <HI>Richard</HI> II. this manor was divided into two moieties; one of which was held by <HI>John Done,</HI> the other by <HI>Reginald Grey,</HI> of the family of Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> of <HI>Ruthin.</HI></P>
<P>THE manor and rectory of <HI>Torporley</HI> are now divided into six shares: four belong to the <HI>Arderns;</HI> one to the dean and chap∣ter of <HI>Chester;</HI> and another to <HI>Philip Egerton,</HI> Esquire, of <HI>Oulton.</HI></P>
<P>THE living is a rectory in the gift of <HI>John Ardern,</HI> Esquire. The church is dedicated to St. <HI>Helen,</HI> the Empress of <HI>Constantius,</HI> the daughter of <HI>Coel,</HI> a <HI>British</HI> prince, a popular saint among us, if we may judge from the number of churches under her protec∣tion. That in question is of no great antiquity, in respect to the
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
building; nor yet of beauty. Within is much waste of good marble, in monumental vanity.</P>
<P>THE best, are two monuments in the chancel, seemingly copied from half-length portraits, included in carved borders of marble, in imitation of frames. The figures are included in them in <HI>mezzo-relievo:</HI> the one of Sir <HI>John Done,</HI> Knight, hereditary fo∣rester and keeper of the forest of <HI>Delamere,</HI> who died in 1629. His figure is picturesque, in a laced jacket, and a horn in his hand, the badge of his office: which horn descended to the different owners of the estate, and is now in the possession of <HI>John Ardern,</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P>WHEN that <HI>Nimrod, James</HI> I. made a progress in 1617, he was entertained by this gentleman at <HI>Utkinton;</HI> <Q>who ordered so <HI>wisely</HI> and <HI>contentfully,</HI></Q> says <HI>King</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vale Royal, ii. 106.]</NOTE> <Q>his Highness's sports, that <HI>James</HI> conferred on him the honor of knighthood.</Q> He married <HI>Dorothy,</HI> daughter of <HI>Thomas Wilbraham,</HI> Esquire, of <HI>Woodhey;</HI> who left behind her so admirable a character, that, to this day, when a <HI>Cheshire</HI> man would express some excellency in one of the fair sex, he would say, <HI><Q>There is Lady Done for you.</Q></HI></P>
<P>The other is of <HI>John Crew,</HI> Esquire, second son of Sir <HI>Randle Crew,</HI> of <HI>Crew,</HI> Knight, married to <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>John Done.</HI> His face is represented in profile, with long hair. He died 1670.</P>
<P>His lady, and her elder sister <HI>Jane Done,</HI> an antient virgin, lie at full length in the <HI>Utkinton</HI> chapel, with long and excellent cha∣racters. One lies recumbent; the other reclined and strait laced,
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
which give little grace in statuary. <HI>Jane</HI> died in 1662; Mrs. <HI>Crew</HI> in 1690, aged 86.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>John Crew,</HI> Knight, son of Mr. <HI>John Crew,</HI> lies reclined on an altar-tomb, with a vast perriwig, and a <HI>Roman</HI> dress, with a whimpering genius at head and feet. Sir <HI>John</HI> married, first, <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of <HI>Thomas Wagstaff,</HI> of <HI>Tachbrook,</HI> in <HI>Warwick∣shire,</HI> Esquire; and for his second, <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Wil∣lughby Aston,</HI> of <HI>Aston,</HI> Baronet. He died in 1711, aged 71.</P>
<P>I MUST not quit this place without letting fall a few tears, as a tribute to the memory of its honest rector <HI>John Allen;</HI> whose an∣tiquarian knowlege and hospitality, I have often experienced on this great thoroughfare to the capital. From the antient recto∣rial house, at the bottom of the town, is an aweful view of the great rock of <HI>Beeston,</HI> backed by the <HI>Peckfreton</HI> hills, tempting me to take a nearer survey.</P>
<P>THE distance is about two miles. In my way I crossed the canal at <HI>Beeston Bridge,</HI> and called at the poor remains of <HI>Beeston Hall,</HI> the manor-house, inhabited by the agent for the estate. This place was burnt by prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> during the civil wars. There is a tradition, that he had dined that day with the lady of the house. After dinner, he told her, that he was sorry that he was obliged to make so bad return to her hospitality; advised her to secure any valuable effects she had, for he must order the house to be burnt that night, least it should be garrisoned by the enemy.</P>
<P>THIS manor had been part of the barony of <HI>Malpas,</HI> and was held under the lords, by the family of <HI>De Bunbury;</HI> who changed their <HI>Norman</HI> name, <HI>St. Pierre,</HI> and assumed that of the place where they first settled.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="15"/>
IN 1271, or the fifty-sixth of <HI>Henry</HI> III. <HI>Henry de Bunbury,</HI> and <HI>Margery</HI> his wife, gave it to their nephew <HI>Richard,</HI> who made the place his residence, and assumed its name. It continued in his family for many generations. Sir <HI>George Beeston</HI> possessed it in the forty-fourth of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> At length, by the marriage of <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Hugh Beeston,</HI> with <HI>William White∣more,</HI> of <HI>Leighton,</HI> it was conveyed into that house; and as sud∣denly transferred, by <HI>Bridget,</HI> heiress of Mr. <HI>Whitemore,</HI> to <HI>Darcie Savage,</HI> second son to <HI>Thomas</HI> Viscount <HI>Savage,</HI> of <HI>Rock Savage;</HI> whose grand-daughter, another <HI>Bridget,</HI> brought it by marriage to Sir <HI>Thomas Mostyn,</HI> Baronet, with the lordships of <HI>Peckfreton, Leighton,</HI> and <HI>Thornton;</HI> in whose house they still remain. This lady was a <HI>Roman Catholic.</HI> Tradition is warm in her praise, and full of her domestic virtues, and the particular attention that she shewed in obliging her domestics, of each religion, to attend their respective churches. Her husband and she were lovely and plea∣sant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they died within a day or two of each other, at <HI>Gloddaeth,</HI> in <HI>Caernar∣vonshire,</HI> and were interred in the neighboring church of <HI>Eglwys Rbôs.</HI></P>
<P>AT a small distance from the hall, is the great insulated rock of <HI>Beeston,</HI> composed of sand-stone, very lofty and precipitous at one end, and sloped down into the flat country at the other. Its height, from <HI>Beeston Bridge</HI> to the summit, is three hundred and sixty-six feet. From the summit is a most extensive view on every part, except where interrupted by the <HI>Peckfreton</HI> hills. The land appears deeply indented by the estuary of the <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Mer∣sey,</HI> and the canal from <HI>Chester</HI> appears a continued slender line of water from that city to almost the base of this eminence. To this
<PB REF="16"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>BEESTON CASTLE.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
place its utility has been proved to all the market-women of the neighboring farmers, who have the benefit of <HI>Treck-schuyts</HI> to con∣vey their merchandize to their capital: a few coals also come up, and a little timber; and these form the sum of their present commerce.</P>
<P>THIS rock is crowned with the ruins of a strong fortress,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEESTON CASTLE.</NOTE> which rose in the year 1220; founded by <HI>Randle Blondeville,</HI> earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> on his return out of the <HI>Holy Land;</HI> for which purpose, and for the building, of <HI>Chartley Castle,</HI> he raised a tax upon all his estates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polychronicon cccvi.</NOTE>. At that time it belonged to the lords of the manor of <HI>Beeston;</HI> from whom he obtained leave to erect his castle. It de∣volved afterwards to the crown; for, according to <HI>Erdeswick,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Polychronicon,</HI> cccvi.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <HI>Hugh Beeston</HI> purchased it from Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and restored it to his lordship.</P>
<P>It had been a place of very great strength. The access, about midway of the slope, was defended by a great gateway, and a strong wall fortified with round towers, which ran from one edge of the precipice to the other, across the slope; but never sur∣rounded the hill, as is most erroneously represented in the old prince. Some of the walls, and about six or seven rounders, still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist. A square tower, part of the gateway, is also standing. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this cincture is a large <HI>area,</HI> perhaps four or five acres in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xtent. Near the top is the castle, defended, on this side, by an amazing ditch, cut out of the live rock; on the other, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upt precipice that hangs over the vale of <HI>Cheshire.</HI></P>
<P>THE entrance is through a noble gateway, guarded on each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by a great rounder, whose walls are of a prodigious thick∣ness.
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
Within the yard is a rectangular building, the chapel of the place. The draw-well was of a most surprizing depth; being sunk through the higher part of the rock, to the level of <HI>Beeston</HI> brook, that runs beneath. In the area just mentioned, was an∣other well: both at this time are filled up; but <HI>King</HI> remem∣bered the first to have been eighty, the other ninety-one, yards deep, although the last is said to have been half filled with stones and rubbish.</P>
<P>WE are quite unacquainted with the events that befel this strong hold, for several centuries after its foundation. <HI>Slow</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ais</HI> 321.</NOTE> says, that <HI>Richard</HI> II. lodged here his great treasures during his expe∣dition into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and garrisoned it with an hundred men of arms, chosen and able; who, on the approach of <HI>Henry</HI> duke of <HI>Lancester,</HI> yielded it to the usurper. But other historians assert, his treasures were placed in the castle of <HI>Holt.</HI></P>
<P>THE fortress certainly fell in ruins soon after this reign; for <HI>Ireland,</HI> in his poem on the birth of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. speaks of it as such, when he makes <HI>Fome</HI> to alight on its summit, and foretell its restoration.</P>

<P>The castle was restored to its former strength, between the days of <HI>Leland</HI> and the sad contentions betwixt the king and parle∣ment, in the times of <HI>Charles</HI> I. It was first possessed by the par∣lement;<NOTE PLACE="marg">SI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> but on the 13th of <HI>September</HI> 1643, was taken by the royalists, under the famous partizan Captain <HI>Sandford;</HI> who scaled the steep sides of the rock, and took it by surprize <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Genethliacon Eaduardi</HI> Pr. <HI>Walliae,</HI> L. 749.</NOTE>. <HI>Steel,</HI> the governor, was suspected of treachery, tried, and shot to death.</P>
<P>THE parlement made a vigorous attempt to recover a place of such importance, and besieged it for seventeen weeks; during which time it was gallantly defended by Captain <HI>Valet.</HI> At length, on the approach of prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> the enemy abandoned the attack, on the 18th of <HI>March</HI> 1644 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">MS. account.

<P><PB N="14" REF="20"/>
IN the following year it was taken, after a most vigorous de∣fence of eighteen weeks. The defendants were reduced to the necessity of eating cats, &amp;c. when the brave Colonel <HI>Ballard,</HI> out of mere compassion to the poor remains of his garrison, consented to beat a parley, and obtained the most honorable conditions, far beyond what would be expected in such extremity; <HI>viz.</HI> to march out, the governor and officers with their horses and arms, and their own proper goods (which loaded two waggons); the com∣mon soldiers with colors flying, drums beating, matches alight, aproportion of cannon and ball, and a convoy to guard them to <HI>Flint Castle.</HI> On <HI>Sunday,</HI> the 16th of <HI>March,</HI> he surrendered the castle to Sir <HI>William Brereton,</HI> and, according to articles, marched out with his men, now reduced to about sixty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rushworth,</HI> vol. i. part 4. p. 136.</NOTE>. The fortress soon after underwent the fate of the other seats of loyalty.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Beeston Castle</HI> I continued my journey about two miles to <HI>Bunbury;</HI> a village,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BUNBURY.</NOTE> and the seat of the parish church. This was the <HI>Boliberie</HI> of <HI>Doomsday Book;</HI> which, with several neigh∣boring places in the antient hundred of <HI>Riseton,</HI> now compre∣hended in that of <HI>Ledesbury,</HI> were possessed by <HI>Robert Fitzhugh.</HI> The family who assumed the name of the place, held it under him and his successors, till, <HI>Humphrey</HI> dying without issue, his sis∣ters, <HI>Ameria</HI> and <HI>Joan,</HI> became co-heiresses. <HI>Ameria</HI>'s share came to the <HI>Patricks,</HI> and from them to the <HI>St. Piers.</HI> At length <HI>Isa∣bel,</HI> daughter and heiress of <HI>Uriam St. Pier,</HI> brought it by mar∣riage to Sir <HI>Walter</HI> —; who sold his share of the ad∣vowson of the church to the famous Sir <HI>Hugh de Calvely. Joan</HI>'s moiety came to her son <HI>Alexander,</HI> who still continued the name <HI>De Bunbury.</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh de Calvely</HI> obtaining likewise
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
the other share of the church, erected here a college for a master and six chaplains; for which purpose he obtained li∣cence, dated <HI>March</HI> 12th 1386, from <HI>Richard</HI> II. on paying to the king the sum of forty pounds. It was instituted for the good state of the <HI>King</HI> and of Sir <HI>Hugh,</HI> as long as they lived; and on their death, for the souls of them and their progenitors, and those of all the faithful <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Monast.</HI> iii. part 2. p. 107.</NOTE>. Its revenue was an hundred marks, but at the dissolution, was £48. 2<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> when the foundation consisted of a dean, five vicars, and two choristers.</P>
<P>IN the fourteenth of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it was purchased of the crown by <HI>Thomas Aldersey,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> merchant-taylor, a second son of the house of <HI>Spurstow,</HI> in this parish. Here he founded a preacher's place, of 100 marks a year, with a good house and glebe; an assistant or curate, with £20 a year; the other for an usher <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A schoolmaster, with £20 a year.</NOTE>, with £10; ten pounds a year to the poor; and se∣veral other charitable gifts. The disposal of the places here are in the haberdashers company, <HI>London.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>King's Vale Royal,</HI> ii. 104, 105.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN respect to the succession of the manor, Sir <HI>Thomas Cokesey,</HI> in the latter end of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. having no issue, alienated his share to the <HI>Bunburies.</HI> In the thirty-second of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. <HI>Richard Bunbury</HI> was lord of the manor; from whom the family of the <HI>Bunburies</HI> of <HI>Stanny,</HI> in <HI>Wirral,</HI> and the present Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> is lineally descended.</P>
<P>THE church is a handsome building, embattled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH</NOTE> and the tower ornamented with pinnacles. The architecture seems of the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. It is dedicated to St. <HI>Boniface;</HI> from whom the
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
place takes its name. Whether the patron was <HI>Boniface,</HI> an <HI>Englishman,</HI> first archbishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> who died in 754, or Pope <HI>Boniface</HI> the First, who died in 423, I cannot determine; for both received their <HI>apotheosis.</HI></P>
<P>THE church is distinguished by the magnificent tomb of Sir <HI>Hugh de Calvely,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMB.</NOTE> whose effigies in white marble lies on it recum∣bent. He is armed in the fashion of the times; and, to give an idea of his vast prowess, his figure is represented seven feet and a half long. He was the <HI>Arthur</HI> of <HI>Cheshire;</HI> the glory of the county: accordingly the most prodigious seats are recorded of him. Whe∣ther, like <HI>Milo,</HI> he could kill a bull with a blow of his fist, is not said; but our ballads give Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> no more than the honor of devouring a calf at a meal. His head rests on a helmet, with a calf's head for the crest, allusive to his name; yet probably gave rise to the fable.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> sprung from a neighboring hamlet (of which I shall have occasion to speak) from whence he took his surname. Ac∣cording to the cast of the times, he fought adventures in the mi∣litary line; and, like a soldier of fortune, first appeared a princi∣pal commander of the <HI>Grandes Compagnies, Tard venus,</HI> or <HI>Malan∣drins,</HI> a species of <HI>banditti,</HI> formed out of the disbanded soldiery of different nations. On the captivity of king <HI>John,</HI> at the battle of <HI>Poitiers,</HI> they amounted at lest to above forty thousand veteran troops. They lived upon plunder; yet were ready to join the side most adverse to <HI>France.</HI> At the battle of <HI>Auray,</HI> in 1364, Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Froissart,</HI> i. ch. ccxxvi.</NOTE> served with a considerable body of them, under the <HI>English</HI> general, Lord <HI>Chandos;</HI> and had the honor of turning the fortune of the day, in which was taken the great <HI>De Gueselin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="23"/>
IN 1366, Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> was won over by that illustrious general, (again at the head of the armies of <HI>France</HI>) to join him in an expe∣dition into <HI>Spain,</HI> to dethrone <HI>Peter</HI> the Cruel, king of <HI>Castile.</HI> The enterprize was successful; but, on the express command of <HI>Edward</HI> III. to Lord <HI>Chandos,</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh de Calvely,</HI> and others of his subjects, leaders of the companies, to forbear hostilities <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer,</HI> vi. 480.</NOTE> against <HI>Peter,</HI> they deserted the quarrel they had espoused; and, on the appearance of the <HI>Black Prince</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> who, to his dis∣grace, took part with the tyrant, Sir <HI>Hugh,</HI> and a great body of the companies, joined him. The prince reinstated <HI>Peter</HI> on the throne, after the great victory of <HI>Najara</HI> over his rival <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Trastamare;</HI> to which the bravery of Sir <HI>Hugh,</HI> and his troops, was highly contributory. On the recall of the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> by his father, in 1367. Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> was left commander of the com∣panies. History gives him a royal consort, in reward of his va∣lour, and marries him to the queen of <HI>Arragon.</HI> If at this pe∣riod he took a most antiquated piece of royalty; for I can find no other dowager of that kingdom, unless <HI>Leonora,</HI> relict of <HI>Alonso</HI> IV. who became a widow in 1335, was then alive.

In 1382, we find him governor of <HI>Guernsey,</HI> and the adjacent isles.

<P>THIS tomb is kept always very neat; which is owing to the piety of Dame <HI>Mary Calveley,</HI> of <HI>Lea;</HI> who, in 1705, left the in∣terest of an hundred pounds, to be distributed annually among certain poor of this parish, on condition they attended divine ser∣vice while they were able and swept the chancel, and cleaned the monument.</P>

AT a small distance from <HI>Bunbury,</HI> I fell into the great road, opposite to <HI>Alpram,</HI> a hamlet, whose name is corrupted from the <HI>Saxon Alburgham,</HI> in the <HI>Doomsday</HI> book. In after-times it was the seat of the <HI>Pages,</HI> now extinct.</P>
<P>A LITTLE farther lies <HI>Calvely,</HI> long the property of that il∣lustrious family, now likewise lost. The place was bestowed on a <HI>Hugh,</HI> by <HI>Richard Vernon,</HI> Baron of <HI>Shipbrook,</HI> about the time of <HI>Richard</HI> I. In <HI>Edward</HI> the IlI.'s time, it came to the <HI>Davenports,</HI> by the marriage of <HI>Arthur</HI> to <HI>Catharine,</HI> daughter and heiress of <HI>Robert de Calvely:</HI> in which family it has continued till the pre∣sent time.</P>
<P>MY road lay along the low unpleasant lane that led towards <HI>Nantwich;</HI> the prospect frequently deformed by the great fosses of the unfortunate canal, falling in on each side of the road; for it crosses at <HI>Barbridge,</HI> and is finished from thence to <HI>Nantwich.</HI> This was only a secondary consideration, executed on the hopes of considerable profit in the carriage of salt and cheese. The ori∣ginal and principal object was, to continue the main trunk by <HI>Church Minshul</HI> to the great <HI>Staffordshire</HI> canal, near <HI>Middlewich,</HI> and by that means share in the freight of the goods of the oppo∣site side of the kingdom: but various causes have frustrated all hopes of that benefit; and this part of the plan remains un∣attempted.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Acton</HI> the prospect mends a little. That village,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ACTON.</NOTE> with its handsome new church, stand on a small rising, and command an∣other great extent of flat, beyond <HI>Nantwich.</HI> This place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">EARL MORKAR'S.</NOTE> before the Conquest, was possessed by <HI>Morkar,</HI> the gallant brother of the gallant earl <HI>Edwin,</HI> last earl of <HI>Mercia.</HI> At that time, the hun∣dred it lay in was called <HI>Warmundestreu,</HI> at present <HI>Namptwich.</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
<HI>Actune,</HI> as it is stiled in the <HI>Doomsday</HI> book, was a very con∣siderable place. There were eight hides of land taxable: there were thirty plough-lands; in the lord's demesn three: two ser∣vants, thirteen villeyns, and fifteen boors, with seven plough∣lands, a mill for the use of the court (<HI>curiae</HI>) and ten acres of meadow: a wood six leagues long, and one broad: an aery of hawks: two presbyters, who had a plough-land: two aliens, having a plough-land and a half: a servant: six villeyns: seven boors, with four plough-lands.</P>
<P>THIS not only shews the greatness of this <HI>Saxon</HI> manor, but that it was the seat of <HI>Morkar,</HI> by the provision made for his sup∣port. The tenants had likewise the right of pleas in the hall of their lord, and one house in <HI>Wich (Nantwich)</HI> where they might make salt without interruption. In the time of the Confessor, the manor was valued at ten pounds a year; at the Conquest, at only six. It may be observed, once for all, that the troubles oc∣casioned at that event, and the ravages committed, instantly sunk the value of the land.</P>
<P>AT the Conquest, this place was a member of the barony of <HI>Wich Malhang,</HI> or <HI>Nantwich. Hugh,</HI> second lord of <HI>Nantwich,</HI> bestowed the advowson of the living, with the lands belonging, on the abbey of <HI>Cumbermere,</HI> which he had founded in 1113 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Monast,</HI> ii. 914.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>IN 1498, the fourteenth <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and in 1541, the thirty-third of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. it was in the heirs of <HI>Ralph Ardens.</HI> In the reign of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> it was the property of the <HI>Wilbrahams</HI> of <HI>Woodhey,</HI> in this parish; and at present belongs to <HI>Wilbraham Tollemache,</HI> Esquire, by virtue of the marriage of <HI>Grace,</HI> eldest daughter of Sir <HI>Richard Wilbraham,</HI> Baronet, with his ancestor <HI>Lionel</HI> earl of <HI>Dysart.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT twenty years ago, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> the steeple and roof of the church were destroyed; but the whole has since been restored, in a very handsome manner. One monument is in good preservation, not∣withstanding this church was a temporary prison after the battle of <HI>Nantwich,</HI> in the civil wars of <HI>Charles</HI> I; but the prisoners were of the party which respected these memorials of the dead.</P>
<P>THE most ancient is one in St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s chapel, in memory of Sir <HI>William Manwaring,</HI> of <HI>Over Pever,</HI> and of <HI>Badely,</HI> in this neighborhood. This knight, before his departure on an expe∣dition to <HI>Guienne,</HI> in 1393, settled his estate, and next year made his will; by which he bequeaths his body to this church, and orders a <HI>picture</HI> in <HI>alabaster,</HI> to cover his tomb. He also left to the same church part of <HI>Christ's cross,</HI> which the wife of his half-brother had shut up in wax, and a competent salary for a chap∣lain to say a competent number of masses, in St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s chapel, for the sake of his son, for seven years, when it might be sup∣posed to have been redeemed from <HI>Purgatory,</HI> and

After his death, which happened in 1399, a magnificent tomb was erected beneath a Gothic arch, with a large embattled super∣structure. Under the arch lies Sir <HI>William</HI> in full armour, with suppliant hands. His head is cased in a conic helm, bound with a fillet entwined with foliage. From his helmet is a guard of mail, which covers his neck, and rises to his lips; over which flow two great whiskers. His head rests on a casque, with an ass's head for a crest. Above, within the arch, is a row of half-lengths, with a book opposite to each; probably religious, chaunt∣ing his <HI>requiem.</HI> The whole is painted. On the edge of the tomb was this inscription, now much defaced by time: <HI>Hic jacet William Manwaring quondam dominum de Badeleye, qui obiit die Veneris xx<SUP>o</SUP> ante festum Pentecostae, anno Dni. m<SUP>o</SUP>ccc<SUP>o</SUP> nonogessimo nono.</HI></P>
<P>THE tomb of Sir <HI>Thomas Wilbraham,</HI> Baronet, and his lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Roger Wilbraham,</HI> Knight, and one of the Masters of Request to <HI>James</HI> I. is very handsome. Their figures are placed on an altar-tomb, in white marble, recumbent: he in armour, long curled hair, and a turn-over, with one hand in his breast, the other by his side. Beneath him is spread a large cloak. The lady has a book in one hand; the other, like his, reclines on her breast. He died in 1660.</P>
<P>THIS tomb is a specimen of the first deviation of the old form: a greater ease of attitude began to prevail. The hands, which used to be erect, close, and suppliant, here vary in the attitude, and shew a dawning of the grace that reigned on the revival of sculpture. In <HI>England,</HI> monumental beauty was soon ruined by the servile copying the dress of the times; by having night-gowns

and flowing perriwigs cut out of the <HI>Parian</HI> blocks; or adding the great wig to the absurdity of the <HI>Roman</HI> habit.</P>
<P>THE church had been long the place of sepulture of the houses of <HI>Woodhey</HI> and <HI>Badeley.</HI> The vain attention of our forefathers to posthumous honors and superstitious rites, is well exemplified from the probate of the will of <HI>William Wilbraham,</HI> of <HI>Woodhey,</HI> who died in 1536; by which <Q>he bequeaths his body to be bu∣ried before the image of our Lady, in the chancel of the church of <HI>Acton,</HI> and bestows x<SUP>9</SUP>. to be laid out on a tenor bell, if the parish will provide the rest; but if not, then the money to be laid out on a <HI>pax</HI> and two <HI>cruytts</HI> of silver, to serve at the high altar on good days. He further wills, that 12 white gowns be given to 12 a poor men; as also, that 12 torches be made, to hold about his body the day of his burial; and that a light be over him, with viii. tapers, in the middle whereof a bigger taper should spring out; also, that penny-dole should be given at his burial, to every person that would take it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HE, moreover, requires his executors to buy a stone of mar∣ble to lie on him, in the said chancel of <HI>Acton,</HI> with pictures of himself and his wife, and their arms; also, that they put out xi £ under sure keeping, to pay xi<SUP>s</SUP>. yearly to a well-disposed priest, to sing (during twenty years) for him and his wife, chil∣dren, father and mother, and all that God would be prayed for; and the said service to be performed in his chapel of <HI>Woodhey;</HI> which priest should likewise have iv £ more yearly for his sa∣lary, if so be his heir is not pleased to give him his board and chamber-room <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collins's Baronets,</HI> ed. 1725. vol. ii. 291.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

THE monument alluded to, either never was executed, or was destroyed by the fall of the steeple.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Acton,</HI> I went down a gentle descent to <HI>Nantwich,</HI> about a mile distant. Antiently this place was known only by the name of <HI>Wich,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Skinner's Etymologicon.</HI> Notwithstanding the word does not appear to have any thing to do with salt, yet <HI>wich,</HI> or <HI>wych,</HI> is always applied, with us, to places where salt is found; as <HI>Droitwich, Nantwich,</HI> &amp;c and the houses in which it is made, are called <HI>wych</HI> houses.</NOTE> an <HI>Anglo-Saxon</HI> word for district, or habitation; and a very common termination of a multitude of places. Here the <HI>British Nant</HI> is added, to shew its low situation.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY before the Conquest, its revenues were divided between the <HI>king</HI> and earl <HI>Edwin.</HI> After that event, it was be∣stowed by the great proprietor of <HI>Cheshire, Hugh Lupus,</HI> on <HI>Wil∣liam de Malhedeng,</HI> or <HI>de Malhang,</HI> a <HI>Norman</HI> chieftain; from whom it was called <HI>Wich Malhang. Hugh</HI> erected it into a barony, in favor of <HI>Malhedeng,</HI> and honored him with a seat in his par∣lement.</P>
<P>THIS dignity continued only in him and his two sons, <HI>Hugh</HI> and <HI>William.</HI> The last died without issue male. Of his three daughters, <HI>Alionora,</HI> the eldest, by marriage of her daughter <HI>Joan,</HI> conveyed her share to the Lord <HI>Lovels; Philippa,</HI> the second, to the <HI>Audleys;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Doctor <HI>Gower.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Alda,</HI> the third, to the <HI>Vernons,</HI> barons of <HI>Shipbroke.</HI></P>
<P>BY these marriages, the barony became divided into four, reckoning the part which had been given by <HI>Hugh Malhang</HI> to the abbey of <HI>Cumbermere;</HI> and soon after, by different alliances, became split into multitudes of other shares.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="34"/>
WHEN entire, it was under the government of the lord, or his steward; who were vested with the usual baronial powers. This town had been governed by a bailiff; but the election of that officer being dropt, it is at present under the government of the constables. It has likewise several other officers, such as the <HI>rulers of walling,</HI> who were guardians of the salt-springs, and re∣gulated all matters respecting their important staple of the place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>History of Nantwich,</HI> 1774.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER them came the <HI>ale-tasters;</HI> whose office related to the assize of bread and drink.</P>
<P>THE next were the <HI>health-keepers;</HI> who attended to the right of the beam-heath, antiently called the <HI>creach;</HI> and took care to pre∣serve it from all incroachments, or trespassers.</P>
<P>THE <HI>leave-lookers</HI> superintended the markets, inspected the weights, and destroyed unwholesome meat of every kind. These corresponded a good deal with the <HI>Aediles cereales</HI> of the <HI>Romans;</HI> as the next officers, the <HI>fire-lookers,</HI> did to the <HI>triumviri nocturni.</HI> They had the care of the chimnies, and were to guard against all accidents that might arise from fire.</P>
<P>THE town is large, but consists chiefly of old houses. The <HI>Weever,</HI> which divides it in unequal parts, is here a small stream, and not navigable higher than <HI>Winsford Bridge.</HI> The inhabitants of <HI>Nantwich</HI> had, many years ago, an act for making this river navigable from that place to their town; but they never carried the power into execution. The <HI>Chester</HI> canal is now completed from that city, and finishes in a handsome broad bason, near the road between <HI>Acton</HI> and the town; but at this time, it remains
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
an almost useless ornament to the country; nor has it, as might have been expected, given the lest increase to the salt-trade, for which this antient town was once so distinguished. Unfortunately for it, the other salt-towns lie more conveniently for commerce, and abound almost to excess with that useful article.</P>
<P>THE chief trade of the place is in shoes, which are sent to <HI>London.</HI> Here is a small manufacture of gloves; but those of bone-lace and stockings, once considerable, are now lost. In the reigns of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and <HI>James</HI> I. the tanning business brought much wealth into the town.</P>
<P>THE salt made from the adjacent brine-springs, formed once a very important business. In the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> here were two hundred and sixteen salt-works, of six <HI>leads-walling</HI> each: in 1774, only two works, of five large pans of wrought iron. The duty produced from them amounts annually to near five thousand pounds: from the whole district, including the works at <HI>Lawton,</HI> and a small one at <HI>Droitwich,</HI> from eighteen to twenty thousand pounds. The tax on this useful article is very considerable; which it bears, as being of most cheap fabrick, and most universal use. It seems, for that reason, to have been one of the earliest taxes of the <HI>Romans;</HI> for <HI>Ancus Martius,</HI> near 640 years before <HI>Christ, salinarum vectigal instituit</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aurelius Victor,</HI> c. v.</NOTE>. This tribute was continued on the <HI>Britons</HI> when the <HI>Romans</HI> possessed our isle.</P>
<P>THE latter also made salt part of the pay of their soldiers, which was called <HI>salarium;</HI> and from which is derived our word <HI>salary.</HI></P>
<P>THE art of making salt was known in very early times, to the
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
<HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Germans:</HI> it is not, therefore, likely that the <HI>Britons,</HI> who had, in several places, plenty of salt-springs, should be ig∣norant of it. The way of making it was very simple, but very dirty; for they did no more than fling the water on burning wood; the water evaporated by the heat, and left the salt adher∣ing to the ashes, or charcoal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plinii Hist. Nat.</HI> lib. xxxi. c. 7. <HI>Galliae Germaniaeque</HI> ardentibus lignis aquam salsam infundunt.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is very probable that the <HI>Britons</HI> used the spring of <HI>Nant∣wich</HI> for this purpose; numbers of pieces of half-burnt wood being frequently dug up in this neighborhood. <HI>Salinis</HI> was a place not far from hence, one of the wiches; but I am uncertain which. The <HI>Romans</HI> made use of the springs, and made salt by much the same process as we do at present. The salt produced was white. It struck the natives, who stiled this place, perhaps the first place where they saw salt of this kind, <HI>Heledd-Wen,</HI> or the white brine-pits, to distinguish them from the springs which they used in so slovenly a fashion.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Romans</HI> were acquainted with rock-salt, but had not dis∣covered it within the limits of <HI>Italy.</HI> There were mountains of salt in <HI>India. Spain</HI> afforded the transparent colorless rock-salt, and <HI>Cappadocia</HI> the deep yellow <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Piiny,</HI> lib.xxxi. c. 7. <HI>Strabe,</HI> lib. xx. 1057. But the rock-salt of our island remained undiscovered till past the middle of the last century.</NOTE>. The <HI>Romans</HI> were conversant in the methods of producing this useful article from the brine <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fit et e putcis in salinas ingestis. <HI>Plin.</HI> xxxi. 7.</NOTE>, which they practised in our island, and communicated their in∣structions to the natives. Salt was an early import into <HI>Britain,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
but it was only to the <HI>Cassiterides,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo,</HI> 265.</NOTE> and the neighboring parts, which were remote from the salt-springs.</P>
<P>THESE advantages are but sparingly scattered over <HI>Great Bri∣tain: Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> are totally destitute of them. In <HI>Eng∣land</HI> there are several, but few that contain salt sufficient to be worked. Thus, there are some which rise out of the middle of the <HI>Were,</HI> in the bishoprick of <HI>Durham;</HI> others in <HI>Yorkshire, Cumberland, Lancashire,</HI> and <HI>Oxfordshire:</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Campbel's Politic, Survey,</HI> i. 76.</NOTE> all those are neglected, either on account of their weakness, or, in some places, by reason of the dearness of fuel. These in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and those at <HI>Droit∣wich</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> with the small works at <HI>Weston</HI> in <HI>Staf∣fordshire,</HI> are the only places where any business is done. <HI>Droit∣wich,</HI> and those in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> were worked by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and had the common name of <HI>Salinae.</HI></P>
<P>FROM that period to the present, they have been successively in use. The <HI>Saxons,</HI> according to their idea of liberty, divided them between the king, the great people, and the freemen. Thus, at <HI>Nantwich</HI> was one brine-pit, which gave employ to numbers of <HI>salinae,</HI> or works. Eight of them were between the king and earl <HI>Edwin,</HI> of which the king had two shares of the profits, the earl one. <HI>Edwin</HI> had likewise a work near his manor of <HI>Aghton,</HI> out of which was made salt sufficient for the annual consumption of his houshold; but if any was sold, the king had a tax of two pence, and the earl of one penny.</P>
<P>IN this place were likewise numbers of works belonging to the people of the neighborhood; which had this usage: From <HI>Ascension-day</HI> to the feast of <HI>St. Martin,</HI> they might carry home
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
what salt they pleased; but if they sold any on the spot, or any∣where in the county, they were to pay a tax to the king and the earl: but after the feast of <HI>St. Martin,</HI> whosoever took the salt home, whether his own, or purchased from other works, was to pay toll, except the before-mentioned work of the earl; which enjoyed exemption, according to antient usage.</P>
<P>IT appears, that the king and earl farmed out their eight works; for they were obliged to give, on the <HI>Friday</HI> of the weeks in which they were worked, xvi. boilings; of which xv. made one <HI>sum</HI> of salt. This is a measure, which, according to <HI>Spelman,</HI> amounts to a horse-load, oreight bushels. The pans of other people, from <HI>Ascension-day</HI> to that of <HI>St. Martin,</HI> were not subject to this farm on the <HI>Friday;</HI> but from <HI>St. Martin's day</HI> to <HI>Ascension</HI> they were liable to those customs, in the same manner as those of the king and the earl.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Welsh</HI> used to supply themselves from these pits, before the union of our country with <HI>England. Henry</HI> III. in order to distress them, during the wars he had with them, took care to put a stop to the works, and deprive them of this necessary article.</P>
<P>ALL these salt-works were confined between the river and a certain ditch. If any person was guilty of a crime, within these limits, he was at liberty of making atonement by a mulct of two shillings, or xxx. boilings of salt; except in the case of mur∣der or theft, for which he was to suffer death. If crimes of that nature were committed without the precinct, the common usage of the county was to be observed.</P>
<P>IN the time of the <HI>Confessor,</HI> this place yielded a rent of xx
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
pounds, with all the pleas of the hundred; but when earl <HI>Hugh</HI> received it, it was a waste.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Germans</HI> had an idea of a peculiar sanctity attendant on salt-springs; that they were nearer to heaven than other places; that the prayers of mortals were nowhere sooner heard; and that, by the peculiar favor of the gods, the rivers and the woods were productive of salt, not, as in other places, by the virtue of the sea, but by the water being poured on a burning pile of wood <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Taciti Annal.</HI> xiii. c. 57.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHETHER this notion might not have been delivered from the <HI>Germans</HI> to their <HI>Saxon</HI> progeny, and whether they might not, in after-times, deliver their grateful thanks for these advantages, I will not determine; but certain it is, that on <HI>Ascension-day</HI> the old inhabitants of <HI>Nantwich</HI> piously sang a hymn of thanksgiving, for the <HI>blessing of the brine.</HI> A very antient pit, called the <HI>Old Brine,</HI> was also held in great veneration, and, till within these few years, was annually, on that festival, bedecked with boughs, flowers, and garlands, and was encircled by a jovial band of young people, celebrating the day with song and dance <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Nantwich,</HI> 60.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS festival was probably one of the <HI>reliques</HI> of <HI>Saxon</HI> pagan∣ism, which <HI>Mellitus</HI> might permit his proselytes to retain, ac∣cording to the political instructions he received from <HI>Gregory</HI> the Great <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bede,</HI> lib. i. c. 31.</NOTE>, on his mission, least, by too rigid an adherence to the purity of the Christian religion, he should deter the <HI>English</HI> from accepting his doctrine. In fact, salt was, from the earliest times, in the highest esteem, and admitted into religious ceremonies: it
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
was considered as a mark of league and friendship. <Q>Neither shalt thou,</Q> says the <HI>Jewish Legislator,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Levit.</HI> ch. ii. v. 13.</NOTE> <Q>suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat-offering With all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt.</Q> <HI>Homer</HI> gives to salt the epithet of <HI>divine.</HI> Both <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> mixed salt with their sacrificial cakes. In their lustrations they made use of salt and water, which gave rise, in after-times, to the superstition of holy water; only the <HI>Greeks</HI> made use of an olive branch in∣stead of a brush, to sprinkle it on the objects of purification.</P>

<BIBL><HI>Theocritus, Idyl.</HI> 24.</BIBL></Q>
<P><HI>Stuckius</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Muscovites</HI> thought that a prince could not shew a guest a greater mark of affection, than by sending to him salt from his own table <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pane ipso princeps suam erga aliquem gratiam; <HI>Sale</HI> veto amorem ostendit. <HI>Antiq.

The dread of spilling of salt, is a known superstition among us and the <HI>Germans,</HI> being reckoned a presage of some future calamity, and particularly, that it fore∣boded domestic feuds; to avert which, it is customary to fling some salt over the shoulder into the fire, in a manner truly classical <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Horace,</HI> lib. iii. ode 23.</NOTE>:

<P>AMONG many other prisoners of distinction taken by Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> was Colonel <HI>George Monk,</HI> in after-times the famous in∣strument of the restoration of <HI>Charles</HI> II. <HI>Fairfax</HI> was so well ac∣quainted with his merit, that he was determined that he never should have an opportunity of exerting his courage again in the royal cause. He sent him up to <HI>London,</HI> where he was committed prisoner to the Tower, and confined near four years. On his re∣lease he joined the parlement; but, through a sense of honor, de∣clined acting against his old master: and employed his sword against the <HI>Irish</HI> rebels, in which service he was engaged till after the death of the King.</P>
<P><HI>Nantwich</HI> was the residence of the widow of the great <HI>Milton,</HI> during the latter part of her life. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Life of Milton</HI> by Bishop <HI>Newton.</HI> She died in a very advanced age, in <HI>March</HI> 1726.</NOTE> She was the daughter of Mr. <HI>Minshul,</HI> of <HI>Stoke,</HI> in this neighborhood. The poet married her in the fifty-third or fifty-fourth year of his age, wanting, in the season of his infirmities, assistance from a dearer relation than that of domestics. I fear that he was disappointed; for she is said to have been a lady of most violent spirit. Yet she maintained a
<PB N="36" REF="46"/>
great respect for his memory; and could not bear to hear the least imputation of plagiarism ascribed to him. She used to say, that he stole from nobody but the muse who inspired him; and that muse was <HI>God's grace,</HI> and <HI>the Holy Spirit, which vi∣sited him nightly.</HI> She probably had heard him say as much, in the composition of his invocation to <HI>Urania,</HI> in his 7th book:
<Q><L>—upled by THEE,</L>

<P>I CONTINUED my journey along the <HI>London</HI> road, flat, tedious, and heavy. At the fourth stone lieth, a little out of the way, <HI>Wibbunbury,</HI> a small village, supposed to have taken, its name from <HI>Wibba,</HI> second king of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> who died in 615. The manor was antiently in the great family of the <HI>Praers.</HI> Sir <HI>Ro∣bert de Praer</HI> gave it to his son <HI>Richard,</HI> about the reign of King <HI>John,</HI> upon condition of rendering to the heirs of his elder bro∣ther two barbed arrows yearly, on the feast of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in lieu of all other services. But the <HI>Praers</HI> remitted all their right in this manor, and the patronage of the church, to the bishop of <HI>Litchfield</HI> and <HI>Coventry,</HI> in 1276, the fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> I. and the bishops continued to be lords of the manor
<PB N="37" REF="47"/>
till the second of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> about which time it was alienated: but the bishops still continue patrons of the church.</P>
<P>THERE had been, in much earlier times, a family in this place which took their name from it; for <HI>Richard de Wibbunbury</HI> was sheriff of <HI>Cheshire</HI> in 1233. Whether the <HI>Praers</HI> ever assumed that name, is uncertain. It is probable, that the <HI>Richard</HI> above∣mentioned was the same with the sheriff, and took the addition on receiving the place from his father.</P>
<P>THIS village was formerly surrounded with gentlemen's seats. Among those was <HI>Lee,</HI> the residence of a family of the same name; from which were descended the <HI>Lees,</HI> earls of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> derived from <HI>Benedict,</HI> a son of this house, who made a settlement at <HI>Quarendon,</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> in the beginning of the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV.</P>
<P>THE church is a very handsome building, embattled and pin∣nacled: the tower lofty; the roof is timbered on the inside, and carved with the arms of the various benefactors. Part of the church was taken down in 1591; at which time many of the monuments were destroyed: of those remaining, are several in memory of the <HI>Delves</HI> of <HI>Doddington.</HI> The most antient is a large altar-tomb of alabaster, with the figures of a father, and son, and lady, engraven on the stone: at the feet of each is a dog, and be∣neath, a dolphin: on the front of the tomb, several figures, their progeny. The persons represented are Sir <HI>John Delves,</HI> his son <HI>John,</HI> and his wife <HI>Ellen,</HI> daughter of <HI>Ralph Egerton,</HI> of <HI>Wrinehill,</HI> in the county of <HI>Stafford;</HI> for which, probably on account of consanguinity, a dispensation was granted in 1439 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collin's Baronet.</HI> ed. 1720, p. 300.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>John</HI> was in high favor with <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and enjoyed several
<PB N="38" REF="48"/>
lucrative posts under him. This he repaid with the most faithful adherence, raised forces in his support, and lost his life valiantly fighting, in the fatal field at <HI>Tewkesbury,</HI> on <HI>Saturday, May</HI> the 4th, 1471. His son, with numbers of persons of distinction, took refuge in the abbey. The furious <HI>Edward</HI> pursued them, with his drawn sword, into the church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow's Annals,</HI> 424.</NOTE>; but was opposed by a resolute priest, who for the present diverted his vengeance by listing up the <HI>host,</HI> interposing the sacred mystery, and denied him admit∣tance till he obtained a promise of pardon; depending on the king's word, they neglected making their escape, and continued in the sanctuary till the <HI>Monday,</HI> when the relentless monarch caused them to be drawn out and beheaded, according to the custom of the times, without any process. The bodies of this unfortunate pair were at first buried at <HI>Tewkesbury</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland Itin.</HI> vi. 88.</NOTE>, but after∣wards translated to this place; where their remains lie, with the following inscription:</P>
<P>Hic jacet <HI>Johannes Delves,</HI> miles, et <HI>Elena</HI> uxor ejus, nec non <HI>Johannes Delves,</HI> armiger, filius et heres predicti <HI>Johis.</HI> qui quidem <HI>Johannes,</HI> miles obiit quarto die <HI>Maii,</HI> anno Dni.

<P><HI>Ralph,</HI> the second son of Sir <HI>John,</HI> and his wife <HI>Catharine,</HI> are represented on a tomb by two brass plates. The inscription im∣ports, that he died the 11th <HI>March,</HI> 1513.</P>
<P>THE tomb of Sir <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> of the <HI>Hough,</HI> in this parish, and his lady, is magnificent in its kind. Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> lies beneath a canopy, supported by four pillars of the <HI>Ionic order,</HI> of white marble, gilt and painted. He is represented recumbent and
<PB N="39" REF="49"/>
armed, with his gauntlets lying at his feet: his hair long, curled, and flowing: his visage bearded and whiskered. His lady (<HI>Anne,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI>) has a fashionable fore-top, a great ruff, and extended hood. Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> died on the 21st of <HI>December</HI> 1614; and his relict erected this monumental com∣pliment.</P>
<P>ON getting into the great road, I passed on the left the scite of the antient seat of <HI>Lee,</HI> and an iron forge.</P>
<P>A LITTLE farther stood the antient seat of <HI>Doddington,</HI> origi∣nally belonging to a family of the same name; but in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> II. passed to the <HI>Praers:</HI> in 1352, the twenty-sixth of <HI>Edward</HI> III. to the <HI>Brescies,</HI> by marriage with the heiress of the house: but in the thirtieth of the same reign, <HI>John Brescie,</HI> with <HI>Margaret</HI> his wife, alienated it to <HI>John Delves,</HI> of <HI>Delveshall</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> one of the four renowned 'squires who distinguished themselves under the Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> at the battle of <HI>Poitiers.</HI> Sir <HI>John Berniers,</HI> Lord <HI>Bourchier,</HI> the noble translator of <HI>Froissart,</HI> relates the deed with all the simplicity of the original. <Q>But when Lord <HI>James Audeley</HI> sawe that shoulde nedes fyght (he sayde to the Prynce) I have alwaies served truly my lorde your father, and you also, and shall do as long as I live.

Therefore I requyre your Grace, as in rewarde for any servyce that ever I dyde to the Kynge your father, or to you, that you will gyve me licence to departe fro' you, and to set up my self there, as I maye accomplyshe my vowe.

this daye that grace to be the best Knyght of all others, and to take hym by the hande. Than the Knyght departed fro the Prince, and went to the foremost front of all the batayles all, onely accompanyed with four Squyers, who promysed nat to sayle him. This Lorde <HI>James</HI> was a ryghte sage and a valiant knyght, and by hym was muche of the hooste ordeyned and governed the day before. — The Lord <HI>James Audeley,</HI> with his foure Squyers, was in the front of that battel, and these dyd marvels in armes; and by great prowes, he came and fought with Sir <HI>Arnolde Dandrchen,</HI> under his own banner; and there they fought longe togyder, and Sir <HI>Arnolde</HI> was there sore han∣dled. — And there was Sir <HI>Arnolde Dandrchen</HI> taken prysoner by other men than by Syr <HI>James Audeley</HI> or his foure Squyers; for y<SUP>t</SUP> daye he never toke prisoner, but always foughte and wente on his enemyes. — On the <HI>Englyshe</HI> parte, the Lord <HI>James Audeley,</HI> with the ayde of his foure Squyers, foughte alwayes in the chyefe of the batayle: he was sore hurte in the bodye, and in the vysage. As longe as his breth served him he fought: at last, at the end of the batayle hys foure Squyers toke and brought hym out of the felde, and layed hym under a hedge syde, for to refreshe hym. And they unarmed hym, and bounde up his woundes as well as they coude.—After the battle, the Prince demanded of the Knyghtes that were aboute him, for the Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> if any knewe any thing of him. Some Knights y<SUP>t</SUP> were there answered and sayde, Sir, he is sore hurt, and lieth in a litter here beside; by my faith, said the Prince, of his hurts I am right forye, go and knowe if he maye be broughte hider, or els I will go, and se him there, as he is.

countries abundant in grain, it affords a conveyance of corn un∣known to past ages. At present, nothing but a general dearth can create a scarcity in any part adjacent to this extensive work.</P>
<P>THESE, and many other advantages, are derived, both to indi∣viduals and the public, from this internal navigation. But when it happens that the kingdom is engaged in a foreign war, with what security is the trade between those three great ports carried on; and with how much less expence has the trader his goods conveyed to any part of the kingdom, than he had for∣merly been subject to, when the goods were obliged to be car∣ried coastways, and to pay insurance?</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it may be asserted, that no undertaking, equally ex∣pensive and arduous, was ever attempted by private people in any kingdom; and, in justice to the adventurers, it must be allowed, that, considering the difficulties they met with, owing to the na∣ture of the works, or the caprice of persons whose lands were taken to make the canal, that ten years and a half was but a short time to perform it in; and that satisfaction has been made to every individual who suffered any injury by the execution of the undertaking. The profits arising from tonnage is already very considerable; and there is no doubt but they will increase annually; and, notwithstanding the enormous sum of money it has cost in the execution, the proprietors will be amply repaid, and have the comfort to reflect, that, by the conclusion of this project, they have contributed to the good of their country, and acquired wealth for themselves and posterity.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after leaving <HI>Stonefield,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">STONE</NOTE> reached the little town of <HI>Stone,</HI> a place remarkable for religious antiquity. <HI>Legend</HI> tells
<PB N="57" REF="71"/>
us, that the before-mentioned <HI>Wulferus,</HI> then a Pagan, put to death his two sons, <HI>Wulfad</HI> and <HI>Rufin,</HI> on suspicion of favoring the Christian faith; <HI>Wulfad</HI> at this place, <HI>Rufin</HI> at <HI>Burston,</HI> about three miles distant. Over each, stones were erected, as usual, in memory of the dead; from whence the names of those places are derived. <HI>Wulfere,</HI> after this unnatural deed, was struck with the utmost remorse, and, by the influence of his queen and St. <HI>Cedda,</HI> or <HI>Chad,</HI> who lived in a neighboring hermitage, was converted to the religion he had so lately persecuted; and, by way of expiat∣ing his guilt, among other works of piety, founded at <HI>Stone</HI> a college of canons regular, <NOTE PLACE="marg">COLLEGE.</NOTE> about the year 670. His queen <HI>Er∣menilda</HI> is said to have also founded a nunnery here. On the in∣vasion of the <HI>Danes,</HI> the religious were dispersed; but on the abatement of the cruelty of those barbarians, it is probable they returned, or at left a new establishment was formed. This is certain, that religious were found here after the Conquest; for there is an idle tale of two nuns and a priest being slain there, by <HI>Enysan,</HI> a <HI>Norman.</HI> This <HI>Enysan,</HI> of <HI>Walton,</HI> was the true re-founder. Caution must be used in reading the his∣tories of these times, which are filled with pious romance. Little credit should also be given to the murder of the sons of <HI>Wulfere.</HI> The <HI>Saxon Chronicle</HI> is silent about the deed. That prince was a convert to Christianity, and seems to have founded the house through the common motives of zeal.</P>
<P><HI>Enysan,</HI> on his re-establishment of this house, filled it with canons from <HI>Kenelworth,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIORY.</NOTE> and made it a cell to that place. The <HI>Staffords,</HI> who were his superiors, assumed the honor of this new foundation; and a second <HI>Robert de Stafford,</HI> about the year 1260, rendered it free from <HI>Kenelworth,</HI> excepting the right of patron∣age,
<PB N="58" REF="72"/>
and a yearly pension. The church of this priory was the place of interment of several of this great family; and numbers of magnificent tombs, with their figures in alabaster, lay there till the dissolution; when they were removed to the <HI>Augustines,</HI> on <HI>Stafford Green.</HI> I see on the road-side a fragment of a thick wall, perhaps a remnant of the priory. The church is quite new, and is a very elegant building, dedicated to St. <HI>Wulfad,</HI> one of the supposed martyrs. At the time of the suppression, a tablet, giving the whole history of the house, was hung up in the priory: it is related in old <HI>English</HI> metre; but is so tedious, that I must refer the readers, who desire to peruse it, to the cited author. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Mon.</HI> ii. 126.</NOTE></P>
<P>As soon as I left <HI>Stone,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ASTON.</NOTE> I saw on the right a large house called <HI>Aston,</HI> originally the property of a branch of the <HI>Heveninghams</HI> of <HI>Suffolk. Walter,</HI> the last of the line, left two daughters; the se∣cond (who only had children) conveyed by marriage the estate to Sir <HI>James Simeon,</HI> who rebuilt the hall. He also built in the garden a <HI>mausoleum;</HI> in which, I think, he is interred. The place is at present the property of <HI>Edward Weld,</HI> Esquire, of <HI>Lulworth</HI> castle, in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> and descended to him of late years, by virtue of a marriage of an ancestor with a daughter of this house, in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>THE road from this place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BURSTON.</NOTE> for several miles, passes along a pretty vale, watered by the <HI>Trent,</HI> bounded by two hills, and much enlivened by the course of the canal. About the third mile from <HI>Stone,</HI> I went by <HI>Burston,</HI> a small hamlet, noted for∣merly for a chapel erected over the spot where <HI>Rufin,</HI> second son of <HI>Wulfere,</HI> was supposed to have been martyred; and on that account, in old times, greatly frequented by the devout.</P>
<P>ABOUT a quarter of a mile from hence, on the top of a hill,
<PB N="59" REF="73"/>
stands the church of <HI>Sandon.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SANDON.</NOTE> This manor, in the twentieth of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, was in the hands of the king; who be∣stowed it on <HI>Hugh Lupus;</HI> and he again gave it to <HI>William de Malbanc,</HI> or <HI>Nantwich.</HI> It passed from this family (by the gift of <HI>Adena,</HI> eldest daughter of <HI>William,</HI> grandson to the former) to <HI>Warren de Verdon;</HI> and by his daughter <HI>Alditha,</HI> to Sir <HI>William Stafford;</HI> and by the marriage of <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter of one of his descendants, in the twelfth of <HI>Edward</HI> III. to <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Erdes∣wik.</HI> It continued in possession of that family till the reign of <HI>James</HI> I. In his time it was sold to <HI>George Digby,</HI> groom of the stole to that monarch, by his half-brother <HI>Richard Erdeswik. Charles</HI> Lord <HI>Gerard,</HI> of <HI>Bromley,</HI> became master of it, by mar∣riage with a daughter of Mr. <HI>Digby;</HI> whose grand-daughter, by matching with <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> conveyed it to Lord <HI>Archibald Hamilton;</HI> who, in 1776, disposed of it to Lord <HI>Har∣rowby.</HI> A law-suit concerning this place gave rise to the fatal duel, in <HI>November</HI> 1712, between <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> and Lord <HI>Mohun;</HI> in which both combatants lost their lives.</P>
<P>THE antient mansion stood near the church, within a moat; but is now demolished, and a beautiful house, commanding a fine view, was built by Lord <HI>Archibald Hamilton,</HI> on an eminence im∣pending over the <HI>Chester</HI> road. The steep slope is beautiful, cloathed with plantations of recent date, but extremely flou∣rishing.</P>
<P>THE church is in the gift of Lord <HI>Harrowby.</HI> Before the dis∣solution, it belonged to the abbey of <HI>Cumbermere;</HI> being bestowed on it by the founder, <HI>Hugh de Malbanc.</HI></P>
<P>THE monuments are curious. The finest is in memory of the celebrated <HI>Sampson Erdeswik,</HI> the learned antiquary of the county;
<PB N="60" REF="74"/>
a faithful guide of all that concerned the families, till his death, which happened in 1603. He might have spared himself the ex∣pence of a monument; his work would have perpetuated his name. He erected one in his life-time; and is represented recumbent, a colossal figure in a jacket with short skirts, and spurs on his legs. Above, in two niches, are his two wives, kneeling: the one was <HI>Elizabeth Dikeswel;</HI> the other <HI>Maria Neale,</HI> widow to Sir <HI>Everard Digby,</HI> and mother to the unfortunate victim to the gunpowder plot. Besides inscriptions to these ladies, is a pedigree of the house; for which, as well as several other epitaphs of the <HI>Erdeswiks,</HI> the reader is referred to the Appendix. I shall only mention, that the tombs are of the altar-form, and have the figures of the per∣sons commemorated engraved on the stone.</P>
<P>THE inscription on a plain marble tomb, in memory of Mr. <HI>Digby,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">OF GRORGE DIGBY.</NOTE> once owner of the place, is very worthy of preservation: as it records a remarkable piece of history, I shall give it here at length, and add notes to the obscure parts.</P>

<P>FROM <HI>Sandon</HI> the hills recede to the north. I directed my course to <HI>Chartley,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARTLEY.</NOTE> about four miles and a half distant, and about three north from the great road. This venerable pile is built round a court, and great part of it curiously made of wood, em∣battled at top, and the sides carved. In many places are the arms of the <HI>Devereux;</HI> the devices of the <HI>Ferrars</HI> and <HI>Garnishes;</HI> and, in <HI>Saxon</HI> characters, the initials of the founder, W.

Within and without is a mortifying appearance of neglect and approaching decay <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A fire in <HI>July</HI> 1781, completed its destruction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AT a small distance from the house, on a knowl, are the poor remains of the castle; <NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> consisting of the fragments of two round∣ers, and a bit of a wall, almost hid in wood. This fortress was very soon permitted to fall in decay. <HI>Leland</HI> speaks of it as a ruin in his days. When the power of the nobility was broken, by the policy of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. numbers of the barons, finding their castle no longer a protection to their insolence, were glad to quit so in∣commodious a kind of habitation. We often see, as in the pre∣sent instance, an antient mansion near the remains, or on the scite of a more antient castle: the times were so much bettered, and monarchy had recovered so much rightful strength, that the for∣mer became useless against; their prince, or their rival <HI>reguli,</HI> who then began to acknowlege the power of law. Yet still some spe∣cies of castellated mansion, against popular commotions, or the attacks of bands of robbers, was requisite. Conveniency, and a sort of elegance, was affected in their houses; but a necessary suspicion still remained, and safety provided for by the deep sur∣rounding moat, by the gateway, and the strong door.</P>
<P><HI>Chartley</HI> castle was built by <HI>Randle Blundeville,</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> in 1220, on his return from the <HI>Holy Land;</HI> and to defray the expences of this, as also of <HI>Beeston,</HI> which he also founded, a tax was levied on all his vassals. By his death, this part of his estate devolved on <HI>William Ferrars</HI> Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> in right of his wife <HI>Agnes,</HI> third sister of <HI>Randle.</HI></P>
<P>His son <HI>Robert,</HI> entering into the factious views of the <HI>barons,</HI> received a defeat at <HI>Chesterfield</HI> in 1266. His estates were con∣fiscated, and the castle and manor bestowed by <HI>Henry</HI> III. on <HI>Ha∣mon</HI>

<HI>Le Strange;</HI> but, notwithstanding this, he possessed himself of it by force, and the king was obliged to order his brother, <HI>Edmund</HI> Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> to besiege the place; which he took, but not till after much loss on both sides. <HI>Edmund,</HI> and the nobility who assisted in the siege, thought proper to obtain his majesty's par∣don for the lives lost on the occasion. <HI>Ferrars</HI> himself received his pardon, was divested of the earldom of <HI>Derby,</HI> but was suf∣fered to retain this castle; possibly, being reduced so low as to be incapable of giving farther disturbance. It continued in his line till the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. when, in 1447, by the marriage of <HI>Anne,</HI> or <HI>Agnes,</HI> sole heiress to <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Ferrars,</HI> to <HI>Walter Devereux,</HI> sheriff of <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> it passed into another great race of peers. The lady was at that time only eleven years and eight months old; but by the king's special favor, in 1452, she had livery of her lands, without further proof of her age. This estate continued in his posterity (the Lords <HI>Ferrars,</HI> Viscounts <HI>Hereford,</HI> and Earls of <HI>Essex</HI>) till the year 1646, when it fell to Sir <HI>Robert Shirley,</HI> by his marriage with <HI>Dorothy,</HI> youngest sister to <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> the noted parlement-general; and is at present pos∣sessed by their descendant Earl <HI>Ferrers.</HI></P>
<P>IN hopes of finding, <NOTE PLACE="marg">STOW CHURCH.</NOTE> in the neighboring parish-church of <HI>Stow,</HI> the monumental honors usually attendant on great families, I vi∣sited it, at the small trouble of a mile's ride. I was disappointed; for I found only, one of this great line deposited in the place. This is very frequent with a race of heroes, whose active spirits carry them into scenes remote from their natal soil, or bring themselves to fates that prevent possession of their parental se∣pulchres. <HI>Walter Devereux,</HI> the first Lord <HI>Ferrars,</HI> fell in the field of <HI>Bosworth,</HI> fighting valiantly in behalf of <HI>Richard,</HI> and was
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>
buried among the undistinguished slain. <HI>Walter,</HI> his descendant, first Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> died Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland, September</HI> 22d. 1576, as supposed by poison, and was interred at <HI>Caermarthen.</HI> His son, the favorite of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> fell a victim to his indiscretion and ambition; perished by the ax, and was flung among the at∣tainted herd. His son, for a series of victories in the cause of liberty, received from his grateful party the magnificent honors of a public funeral in the capital, which his arms had defended.</P>
<P>I FOUND here only the tomb of <HI>Walter,</HI> first Viscount <HI>Hereford,</HI> grandson of the first Lord <HI>Ferrers,</HI> and founder of the house of <HI>Chartley.</HI> He served with honor in the <HI>French</HI> wars, under <HI>Henry</HI> VIII; and in the naval attack of <HI>Conquet,</HI> in 1512, he was honored with the garter by his royal master, and with the title of <HI>Hereford</HI> by his successor. His death happened in 1558. He lies here under a fine monument, erected in his life-time; his figure is represented in robes, with the collar of the garter round his neck: his head reposed on a plume of feathers, wreathed round a helmet. On one side of him is placed his first lady, <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of <HI>Thomas</HI> Marquis of <HI>Dorset;</HI> on the other, his second, <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter of <HI>Robert Garnyche,</HI> Esquire, of <HI>Kyngeton,</HI> in <HI>Suffolk.</HI> Around the side is represented, I suppose as mourners, six female and six male figures; the last begirt with swords.</P>
<P>NEAR this is another tomb of alabaster, with the figures of two persons engrav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n on it; but so cankered with age, that neither inscription nor distinction of sex, can be made out.</P>
<P>ON the chancel floor a brass plate preserves the memory of <HI>Thomas Newport,</HI> steward of the houshold to <HI>Walter,</HI> first Earl of Essex, and delivers his character in these terms:

<P>FROM <HI>Stow</HI> I hastened to the <HI>Chester</HI> road, <NOTE PLACE="marg">WYCH WESTON.</NOTE> which I reached at the hamlet of <HI>Wych,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Weston on the Trent,</HI> whose spire steeple appears at a small distance on the other side of the road. This place is productive of salt, and has been long noted: for its brine-pits, the property of Earl <HI>Ferrers.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER going about two miles farther, <NOTE PLACE="marg">HEYWOOD.</NOTE> I passed through <HI>Great Heywood,</HI> a village bestowed by <HI>Roger de Melend,</HI> alias <HI>Long Epee,</HI> a worthless prelate, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. on his valet <HI>Roger de Aston;</HI> whose family made it their residence, till the marriage of a descendant with the heiress of <HI>Tixal,</HI> occasioned it to remove to the new acquisition. In my memory the old seat was in pos∣session of the <HI>Whitbies.</HI> It has since been re-united to the house of <HI>Tixal,</HI> by purchase. The barn belonging to the manor-house of <HI>Heywood,</HI> was of a most magnificent size; but of late has been greatly reduced.</P>
<P>THE horse-bridge over the <HI>Trent,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS LONG BRIDGE.</NOTE> adjoining to <HI>Heywood,</HI> was not less remarkable, for I remember it to have consisted of two-and-forty arches; but the number at present is much lessened. There is a tradition, that it was built by the county, in a compli∣ment to the last <HI>Devereux</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who resided much at <HI>Chartley;</HI> and, being a keen sportsman, was often-deprived of his diversion for want of one. I am not clear about the truth, of this report. There certainly had been a bridge here long before, so that, if there was any foundation for such a mark of respect, it could only have been rebuilt after falling to decay.</P>

FROM the middle is a view, of very uncommon beauty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VALE OF SHUGBOROUGH.</NOTE> of a small vale, varied with almost every thing that nature or art could give to render it delicious; rich meadows, watered by the <HI>Trent</HI> and <HI>Sow.</HI> The first, animated with milk-white cattle, emulating those of <HI>Tinian;</HI> the last with numerous swans. The boundary on one side, is a cultivated slope; on the other, the lofty front of <HI>Cannock Wood,</HI> clothed with heath; or shaded with old oaks, scattered over its glowing bloom by the free hand of nature.</P>
<P>IT is more difficult to enumerate the works of art dispersed over this <HI>Elysium;</HI> they epitomize those of so many places. The old church of <HI>Colwich;</HI> the mansion of the antient <HI>English</HI> baron, at <HI>Welsely Hall;</HI> the great-windowed mode of building in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the house of <HI>Ingestre;</HI> the modern seat in <HI>Oak-edge;</HI> and the lively improved front of <HI>Shugborough;</HI> are embellishments proper to our own country. Amidst these arise the genuine architecture of <HI>China,</HI> in all its extravagance; the dawning of the <HI>Grecian,</HI> in the mixed gothic gateway at <HI>Tixal;</HI> and the chaste buildings of <HI>Athens,</HI> exemplified by Mr. <HI>Stuart,</HI> in the counterparts of the <HI>Choragic</HI> monument of <HI>Lysicrates,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antiquities of Athens,</HI> ch. iv. tab. 1. 3.</NOTE> and the octagon tower of <HI>Andronicus Cyrrhestes.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, ch. iii. tab. 1. 3.</NOTE> From the same hand arose, by command of a grateful brother, the arch of <HI>Adrian</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI> embellished with naval trophies, in honor of Lord <HI>Anson,</HI> a glory to the <HI>British</HI> fleet; and who still survives in the gallant train of officers who remember and emulate his actions.

the still paths of private life, and was the best qualified for its enjoyment of any man I ever knew; for with a most humane and the most sedate disposition, he possessed a mind most uncommonly cultivated. He was the example of true taste in this country; and at the time that he made his own place a paradise, made every neighbor partaker of its elegancies. He was happy in his life, and happy in his end. I saw him about thirty hours before his death, listening calmly to the melody of the harp, preparing for the momentary transit from an earthly concert to an union with the angelic harmonies. The unfinished improvements are carried on with great judgment, by his worthy nephew and suc∣cessor <HI>George Anson,</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P>AMONG the great number of statues which embellish the place, an <HI>Adonis</HI> and <HI>Thalia</HI> are the most capital. There is also a very fine figure of <HI>Trajan,</HI> in the attitude of haranguing his army. The number of rude <HI>Etruscan</HI> figures in the garden, shew the ex∣travagance of the earliest ages, and the great antiquity of the art of sculpture in <HI>Italy,</HI> long before the <HI>Romans</HI> became, a people. The beautiful monument in the lower end of the garden, does honor to the present age. It was the work of Mr. <HI>Schemecher,</HI> under the direction of the late Mr. <HI>Anson.</HI> The scene is laid in <HI>Arcadia.</HI> Two lovers, expressed in elegant pastoral figures, ap∣pear attentive to an antient shepherd, who reads to them an in∣scription on a tomb,</P>

memento of the certainty of that event. Perhaps, also, as a secret memorial of some loss of a tender nature in his early days; for he was wont often to hang over it in affectionate and firm medi∣tation. The <HI>Chinese</HI> house, a little farther on, is a true pattern of the architecture of that nation, taken in the country by the skil∣ful pencil of Sir <HI>Percy Brett:</HI> not a mongrel invention of <HI>British</HI> carpenters.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to the back-front of the house, on the banks of the <HI>Sow,</HI> stand the small remains of the antient mansion, which, according to <HI>Leland,</HI> originally belonged to <HI>Suckborrow with a long heard,</HI> and who, as some say, gave it to the mitre of <HI>Lichfield.</HI> It must have been in very early times; for the manor of <HI>Haywood</HI> (in which this is included) belonged to the see in 1085, the twentieth of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, and so continued till the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. who bestowed it on Lord <HI>Paget.</HI> The house was till that time one of the palaces of the bishops. The reliques, at present, serve to give the appearance of reality of ruin to some beautiful <HI>Grecian</HI> columns, and other fragments of an∣tient architecture; which were tacked to the front by the late Mr. <HI>Anson.</HI></P>

AT a very little distance from this heath lies <HI>Ingestre,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">INGESTRE.</NOTE> or <HI>Inges∣trent,</HI> a respectable old house, seated on the easy slope of a hill, and backed by a large wood, filled with antient oaks of vast size: this makes part of the pleasure-ground. The walks are partly bounded by enormous hedges of forest-trees, and partly wander into the antient wood, beneath the shade of the venerable trees.</P>
<P>THIS manor, about the time of <HI>Henry</HI> II. was the property of <HI>Eudo de Mutton;</HI> in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. it was transferred to the family of the <HI>Chetwynds,</HI> by the marriage of <HI>Isabel,</HI> daugh∣ter of <HI>Philip de Mutton,</HI> with Sir <HI>John de Chetwynd;</HI> in which line it continues, being at present owned by <HI>John Chetwynd Talbot,</HI> Esquire, grandson of <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Chetwynd.</HI></P>
<P>THE house is built in the stile of the reign of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> with great windows in the center, and a bow on each side: the last are of stone, the rest of the house brick. In the great hall, over the fire-place, is a very good picture of <HI>Walter Chetwynd,</HI> Esquire, in a great wig, and crossed by a rich sash. This gentleman was dis∣tinguished by his vast knowlege in the antiquities of his country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> and more so by his piety. The present church of <HI>Ingestre</HI> was rebuilt by him, and was consecrated in <HI>August</HI> 1677. A sermon was preached, prayers read, a child baptized, a woman churched, a couple married, a corpse buried, the sacraments administred, and, to crown all, Mr. <HI>Chetwynd</HI> made an offering on the altar of the tythes of <HI>Hopton,</HI> worth fifty pounds a year, to be added to the rectory for ever. The church is very neat, and is prettily stuccoed. In it is a mural monument, in memory of its great benefactor, who died in 1692.</P>

<P>BESIDES these, were two hospitals, and the free chapel of Saint <HI>Nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>as.</HI> in the castle.</P>
<P>THE town was defended partly by the river <HI>Sow,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FORTIFICATIONS.</NOTE> which bounds one half of it; the rest was guarded by a wall, and by a ditch, supplied by the river with water. It had formerly four gates; of these two are yet standing. The place never was defencible; at last ever stood a siege. Sir <HI>William Brereton,</HI> the parlement general, took it by surprize, in <HI>May</HI> 1643, with the loss only of a single man.</P>
<P>THE origin of <HI>Stafford</HI> is very uncertain: the first name of it is led to be <HI>Betheney,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ORIGIN OF STAFFORD.</NOTE> and that it had been the seat of an hermit called <HI>Bertelin,</HI> in high fame for his sanctity. The earliest au∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hentic mention of the place is in the year 913, when <HI>Ethelfleda</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Saxon C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 104.</NOTE> Countess of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and sister of <HI>Edward</HI> the Elder, built a castle her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

From thenceforth her delight was in arms, in con∣quests, and in securing her dominions.

<P><PB N="76" REF="90"/>
THE scite of this fortress is not precisely known. Doctor <HI>Plot</HI> is of opinion, that it lay within the entrenchments at <HI>Billington,</HI> at some distance from <HI>Stafford,</HI> and seems to found his conjecture from the lands wherein they are being still a remaining part of the demesne land of the barony of <HI>Stafford <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Staff.</HI> 416.</NOTE>. Cambden</HI> attributes a tower to <HI>Edward</HI> the Elder, founded in the year after that which was built by his sister, and places it on the north side of the river. A mount still remains near the new bridge, called by <HI>Speed, Castle-hill;</HI> at present named <HI>Bullyhill,</HI> on which it probably stood.</P>
<P>THE poor remains of the castle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> which was garrisoned in the civil wars, stand on a little insulated hill, a mile south from the town. The keep was on an artificial mount: the whole is sur∣rounded with a deep foss, which, on the south side, has besides the additional strength of a high rampart. This was founded by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, and was soon after demolished. It is supposed that during the time it stood, the custody of it was committed to <HI>Robert de Tonei,</HI> younger son of <HI>Roger,</HI> standard-bearer of <HI>Normandy,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale's Baron.</HI> i. 256.</NOTE> a follower of the Conqueror, who took from this circumstance the name of <HI>Stafford.</HI> It is conjectured, that the king at that time reserved this manor to himself, and that it was not included in the vast grant made by him to <HI>Robert,</HI> of eighty-one manors in this county, twenty-six in that of <HI>Warwick,</HI> twenty in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> two in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and one in each of those of <HI>Worcester</HI> and <HI>Northampton.</HI> It appears that it continued in the crown till the second of <HI>Edward</HI> II. when <HI>Edmund</HI> Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> received the grant, and held it <HI>in capite</HI> by barony, together with that of <HI>Bradeley</HI> and <HI>Madeley,</HI> by service, of finding for forty days, at his

Mr. <HI>Erdeswic</HI> says, it was <HI>Ralph de Stafford,</HI> a distinguished war∣rior, cotemporary with <HI>Edward</HI> III. It was garrisoned by the king in the last civil wars; was taken by the parlement forces, and demolished in 1644.</P>
<P>ABOUT a quarter of a mile south of the castle, in a low situa∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANOR-HOUSE.</NOTE> stood the manor-house of the family, fortified by the same <HI>Ralph;</HI> for I find from <HI>Dugdale,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Baron,</HI> i. 160.</NOTE> that he had permission, in 1348, to make castles of his manor-houses at <HI>Stafford</HI> and <HI>Madeley.</HI> This great family had in it barons, earls, and dukes; and in the year 1637 became extinct: at that time humiliated into barens again. The moat of their antient residence is still to be seen, surrounding a rectangular piece of ground, the scite of the house.</P>
<P>My curiosity led me about two miles further, to <HI>Billington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BILLINGTON BURY.</NOTE> to examine the supposed scite of the antient <HI>Stafford</HI> castle. Near the extremity of a high hill, steeply sloping on three sides, and commanding a most extensive and beautiful view, I found a large sea, surrounded in some parts with one, in others with two, deep fosses. This had been a <HI>British</HI> post, as it agrees with those we find in many parts of the kingdom; but as it retains the name of <HI>Billington Bury,</HI> it probably might have been occupied by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> whose posts are distinguished by the addition of <HI>Borough, Bury,</HI> and <HI>Berry.</HI></P>
<P>THE town of <HI>Stafford</HI> is governed by a mayor, recorder, ten al∣dermen, and twenty common-council-men; and was incorporated
<PB N="78" REF="92"/>
in the third of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. It first sent burgesses to parlement in 1294, the twenty-third of <HI>Edward</HI> I. They are elected by in∣habitants paying scot and lot, and are returned by the mayor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis,</HI> iii. 50.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE borough still retains one antient custom, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BOROUGH.</NOTE> the privilege of <HI>borough English,</HI> or the descent of lands, within its liberty, to the youngest sons of those who die intestate: an usage which is sup∣posed to have been originally founded on the presumption, that the younger child was the most incapable of providing for itself.</P>
<P>THE barony was, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BARONY.</NOTE> even at the Conquest, one of the greatest in <HI>England,</HI> and afterwards, like other great seigniories, stiled the <HI>Honor of Stafford.</HI> None were such originally, but which were royal; but were afterwards bestowed in see on some nobleman, as proved the case with this, as mentioned in page 76; when it was given to <HI>Edmund</HI> Lord <HI>Stafford,</HI> with eighty-one dependent manors, with sixty knights sees, <HI>viz.</HI> nine in his demesne, and fifty-one in service.</P>
<P>AFTER leading the town, I crossed the <HI>Wolverhampton Naviga∣tion</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Distances. <HI>Heywood,</HI> to its junction with the <HI>Birminghaus</HI> canal, near <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣verlampton,</HI> 22. 4. 0: rise 125 feet: <HI>Stainport on the Severn,</HI> 24. 0. c; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 301 feet.</NOTE> at <HI>Redford Bridge.</HI> This may be called a port to <HI>Stafford.</HI> A little further is <HI>Weeping Cross,</HI> so stiled from its vicinity to the antient place of execution.

the beautiful woody dingles that wind into the sides of the forest. When I was wandering through them, I imagined myself engaged in those of my native country. Here I suppose to have been the park of red deer, which <HI>Leland</HI> says the bishop of <HI>Lichfield</HI> had in his manor of <HI>Shugborow.</HI> I skirted part of the wood, which here ends boldly, almost driving the traveller into the <HI>Sow.</HI> This front has received from Mr. <HI>Anson</HI> a wonderful change.

<P>RETURNING over <HI>Heywood</HI> bridge, I passed through the two hamlets of that name; and within two miles of the first, reached the church and village of <HI>Colwich.</HI> I must imagine the traveller,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLWICH.</NOTE> as well as myself, blinded, if we rode this space insensible of the most elegant view of the vale.

<P>THE parsonage and church of <HI>Colwich</HI> contribute to the variety of the view, from another station: both are antient.

<P>AFTER riding a little way along the <HI>Lichfield</HI> road, I turned to the left, and crossing the vale, which now expands and grows less <HI>rionte,</HI> repass the <HI>Trent</HI> at <HI>Colton,</HI> on a bridge of a fine single arch.<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE BURBOT.</NOTE> Near this place is sometimes taken the <HI>Burbot,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plot,</HI> 241, tab. xxii. <HI>Br.

It is very voracious, and very pro∣lific. The noted old fisherman of the <HI>Rhine, Leonard Baltner,</HI> took out of a single fish not fewer than 128,000 eggs.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Erdeswik</HI> informs us, that at the time of the Conqueror, one <HI>Galfridus</HI> was lord of <HI>Colton.</HI> Soon after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLTON.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Hardulph de Gastenoys</HI> had either all, or shared it with another; for in the year 1315, Sir <HI>William Gastenoys</HI> and <HI>Anselm le Marshal</HI> were joint lords of it. After many generations, a female (<HI>Thomasine,</HI> sole heiress and daughter of Sir <HI>Thomas Gastenoys,</HI> last male heir of the fa∣mily, by marriage with Sir <HI>Nicholas Greislei,</HI> about 1379) trans∣ferred it to the house of <HI>Drakelow.</HI> The old hall, which was large enough to contain fourscore lodging-rooms, was burnt down in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> I. by the carelessness of a servant. It at that time belonged to Lord <HI>Aston.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Allen</HI>'s MSS.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE country now alters for the worse, and the soil becomes wet and miry. About two miles distance from <HI>Colton</HI> stands <HI>Blithefield,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BLITHEFIELD.</NOTE> the respectable old seat of the respectable family of the <HI>Bagots;</HI> a most antient and virtuous race.

<HI>Hervey Bagot;</HI> from which match sprung a long line of peers of every rank. The elder branch acquired this place by the mar∣riage of Sir <HI>Ralph Bagot</HI> (before the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> IV.) with <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> sole heiress of <HI>Richard Blithefield,</HI> lineally descended from a <HI>Saxon</HI> of the name of <HI>Hereman,</HI> or the warrior.</P>
<P>THE house is built round a court, and still retains, on the out∣side, the simplicity of appearance of that of an antient baron; and within, the old hospitality. The best rooms are, the hall, the library, and a large drawing-room, lately added. The first is a noble apartment, unadorned, excepting over the chimney-piece, where is a representation in bold and good sculpture, in free∣stone, of an event dear as life to every true <HI>Englishman;</HI> that of King <HI>John</HI> granting to his subjects the great charter of liberty.</P>
<P>AMONG the portraits, I observed on a board, in a flat manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LORD-TREASURER BURLEIGH.</NOTE> the head of lord treasurer <HI>Burleigh,</HI> with a white beard, bonnet, collar of the garter, the George, and a white wand. His abilities as a statesman were inimitable; his private virtues not beyond the power of the great to copy; his magnificence was attended with hospitality; his annual deeds of alms to the amount of five hundred pounds; his honesty, temperance, moderation, industry, and justice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden's Annals,</HI> year 1598.</NOTE>. As his life was excellent, so his death was happy; dying in the fulness of years and of glory, envied, as his greatest enemy declared, only because his fun went down with so much lustre; not clouded, as generally is the fate of great mi∣nisters.</P>

This preserves a likeness of a very different character, <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> lord president of the north, and one of the peers to whom the custody of the queen of <HI>Scots</HI> was entrusted. <HI>Burleigh</HI> created a fortune by his prudence; <HI>Huntington</HI> dissipated his, by being the dupe to the ministers of the rising fanaticism of the age, which, nurtured by such wooers of popularity as <HI>Leicester, Essex,</HI> and this noble peer, in the next age attained strength suf∣ficient to subvert the church it pretended to purify.</P>
<P>A NEIGHBORING statesman, Sir <HI>Walter Aston</HI> of <HI>Tixal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR WALTER ASTON.</NOTE> is painted on board. He appears with a firm countenance, short hair, and whiskers; in a black dress, laced with gold on the seams, and graced with a triple gold chain.

sent to command in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in 1573, and performed services wor∣thy of his character; but at length, worn out by the ill usage of the ministry, who with-held from him the necessary support, he came over to <HI>England,</HI> to lay his complaint before the queen. He was artfully received, and sent back with the promises of better usage. Grief, or, as others say, poison, administered by the instigation of <HI>Leicester,</HI> who loved his wife, cut him off at the age of thirty-five, at <HI>Dublin,</HI> in 1576. Perhaps the infamy of <HI>Dudley</HI>'s character, and the speedy and indecent marriage of the countess with that favorite, might give rise to the scandal; for an inquisition was made on his death, and the report in consequence was, that he died of the flux; a disorder very frequent in <HI>Ireland</HI> in those days.</P>
<P>HERE are several portraits of different persons, <NOTE PLACE="marg">COLONEL RICHARD BAGOT.</NOTE> of this worthy house.

<P>I QUIT the subject of paintings, notwithstanding there are mul∣titudes of pictures, by the best masters, in this house.

<P>THE park is at some distance from the house. <NOTE PLACE="marg">PARK.</NOTE> The oaks are of a very great size: a twin-tree was lately sold for £.120, and some single ones for half that sum; and I am told, that there are seve∣ral now standing equally large.</P>
<P>THE church is very near the house, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> in the gift of Sir <HI>William Bagot,</HI> dedicated to St. <HI>Leonard.</HI> Within, are several sculptured tombs, of the time of the fifteenth century; some with imaged figures, others engraven; mostly in memorial of the <HI>Bagots:</HI> one of an <HI>Aston</HI> of <HI>Broughton,</HI> and another expressed by a little skele∣ton of a <HI>Broughton,</HI> a child of three months old. The monument of Sir <HI>Edward Bagot,</HI> who died in 1673, is mural, and supersedes the ten commandments, being placed over the altar. The in∣scription tells us, that he was a true assertor of episcopacy in the church, and hereditary monarchy in the state; which probably
<PB N="87" REF="103"/>
entitled him, in those days, to this sacred place. On the outside of the church, two modest heaps of turf, parallel to each other, mark the spot where the remains of the last amiable owners of the place repose; whole merit survives in their successor.</P>
<P>I FOUND myself here not very distant from <HI>Whichenoure Hall,</HI> and could not resist the desire of visiting the seat of the celebrated <HI>Flitch,</HI> the desperate reward of conjugal affection.</P>

<P>THE church of <HI>Hermitage,</HI> seated on a small eminence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> forms another beautiful object. This belongs to the cathedral of <HI>Lich∣field,</HI> and is stiled the prebendary of <HI>Hansacre,</HI> a hamlet in this parish, founded by Bishop <HI>Clinton.</HI></P>
<P>ON the opposite side of the <HI>Trent</HI> is <HI>Maveston Ridware,</HI> a rec∣tory, <NOTE PLACE="marg">MAVESTON RIDWARE.</NOTE> whose church is dedicated to St. <HI>Andrew.</HI> This had been the property of the <HI>Mavestons,</HI> at left from the time of <HI>Edward</HI> I. to that of <HI>Henry</HI> IV.

<P>SUCH is the history of this memorable custom. I wish, <NOTE PLACE="marg">PRESENT STATE OF THE FLITCH.</NOTE> for the honor of the state matrimonial, that it was in my power to con∣tinue the register of successful clamants, from that preserved in the 608th <HI>Spectator;</HI> but, from the strictest enquiry, the flitch has remained untouched, from the first century of its institution to the present: and we are credibly informed, that the late and pre∣sent
<PB N="94" REF="110"/>
worthy owners of the manor, were deterred from entering into the holy state, through the dread of not obtaining a single rasher from their own bacon.</P>
<P>THE first pessessor of this manor was Sir <HI>Walter de Somervile,</HI> a <HI>Norman,</HI> on whom it was bestowed by the Conqueror. It rested in his family till the death of the above-mentioned Sir <HI>Philip de So∣mervile,</HI> who left two daughters, <HI>Joan,</HI> wife of Sir <HI>Rhys ap Griffith,</HI> Knight; and <HI>Maud,</HI> married to <HI>Edmund Vernon.</HI> This estate fell to the former, and remained in the family till the last century, when it was sold by <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter or widow to <HI>Henry Griffith,</HI> to — <HI>Offley,</HI> Esquire, ancestor to the late owner; who, within these few years, alienated it to the present <HI>John Levet,</HI> Es∣quire.</P>
<P>I CANNOT tell the precise year in which it was sold to Mr. <HI>Offley;</HI> but it appears that <HI>Henry Griffith</HI> was living in 1597.</P>
<P>IN compliance with my original plan, I took the same way, in order to return into the great road. Soon after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">RUDGLEY.</NOTE> repassing the <HI>Trent,</HI> at <HI>Colton</HI> bridge, I reached <HI>Rudgley,</HI> a small town, cele∣brated for its great annual fairs for horses of the coach breed.</P>
<P>THE church is a little north of the town, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> is dedicated to Saint <HI>Augustin,</HI> and is a vicarage belonging to the chapter of <HI>Lichfield.</HI> Opposite is a very antient timber-house, belonging once to the <HI>Chetwynds;</HI> at present to Mr. <HI>Anson.</HI> On an eminence, above the town, is beautifully situated a large house, formerly belonging to the <HI>Westons,</HI> greatly enlarged and improved by the present owner, <HI>Ashton Curzon,</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P>THE antient owners of <HI>Rudgley</HI> were of the same name with the town: some of the family had the honor of being sheriffs of the
<PB N="95" REF="111"/>
county, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III: another was knight of the shire, in the same period. The name continued here till after the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. <HI>Erdeswik</HI> mentions this to have been a ma∣nor belonging to the bishop of <HI>Lichfield;</HI> which I find was alien∣ated to the king by bishop <HI>Sampson,</HI> in 1547.</P>
<P>THE parish and village of <HI>Longdon</HI> succeeds that of <HI>Rudgley.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LONGDON.</NOTE> The church lies out of the road, on the left; is a vicarage, dedi∣cated to St. <HI>James;</HI> and belongs to a prebendship of <HI>Lichfield.</HI> The village consists of scattered houses, extending for a vast way on each side of the lane; from whence the name. This gave rise, to a common saying in these parts,
<Q><L>The stoutest beggar that goes by the way,</L>
<L>Cannot beg thro' <HI>Long'</HI> in a summer's day.</L></Q></P>
<P>THIS village antiently was full of gentlemen's seats; a most use∣ful species of population to the poor, whose distresses seldom fail reaching the ears of mediocrity, but whose cries rarely attain the height of greatness. Sir <HI>Edward Littleton</HI> had a house called <HI>Chestal; Simon Rudgley,</HI> sheriff of the county in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> III. had another; the younger brother of the <HI>Astons</HI> had a seat here, from the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I; the <HI>Broughtons</HI> had <HI>Broughton Hall,</HI> from the days of King <HI>John;</HI> and <HI>Adam Arblaster</HI> possessed <HI>Liswys</HI> (now <HI>Longball</HI>) in 1351, or the twenty-fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> III. in whose name it continued till of late, when it was purchased by <HI>Francis Cob,</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P>THIS manor is of vast extent. Above thirty other manors, lordships) and villages, owe suit and service, besides <HI>Cank, Hey∣wood</HI> and <HI>Rudgley,</HI> to the court-leet, which is held here every
<PB N="96" REF="112"/>
three weeks. It once belonged to the bishop of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> but was alienated by Bishop <HI>Sampson.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER winding up the steep of a high hill, an advanced part of the forest of <HI>Cank,</HI> I turned out of the road to <HI>Beaudesert,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BEAUDESERT.</NOTE> the princely seat of Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> placed on the side of a lofty sloping eminence, sheltered above, and on each side, by beautiful rising grounds, and embosomed with trees, commanding in front, over the tops of far subjacent woods, a most extensive and agreeable view; so that it well vindicates the propriety of its name.</P>
<P>THIS had been a place belonging to the bishops of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> which, with the manors of <HI>Longdon, Heywood, Berkswick, Cank, Rudgley,</HI> and <HI>Shugborrow,</HI> were part of the spoils of that see, wrested from it in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. with the connivance of <HI>Richard Sampson,</HI> then bishop, who accepted in their stead certain impro∣priations of the value of an hundred and eighty-three pounds a year. These livings at that time were good rectories; now poor vicarages, or mercenary curacies, annexed to the bishoprick.</P>
<P>THE leviathan who swallowed these manors, was Sir <HI>William Paget,</HI> created by <HI>Edward</HI> VI. Baron <HI>Beaudesert.</HI> He first appeared in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and from a low beginning, merito∣riously rose to the dignity of secretary and ambassador to <HI>Charles</HI> V. and <HI>Francis</HI> I. In the next reign, he was made chancellor of the dutchy of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and comptroller of the houshold; and obtained a peerage. In that of <HI>Mary,</HI> became lord privy-seal, and was re∣stored to the order of the Garter, from which he had been de∣graded in the time of her predecessor. At the accession of <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI> at his own request, he was permitted to retire from the service of the state, being zealously attached to the religion of his
<PB N="97" REF="113"/>
former mistress <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fuller's Worthies,</HI> 210.</NOTE>. Yet his zeal for the old religion, produced in him no scruples about sharing in the plunder of the church. The reforming <HI>Somerset,</HI> and the papal <HI>Paget,</HI> agreed in that single point. His posterity derive from him an uncommon extent of in∣terest and command.</P>
<P><HI>Beaudesert</HI> was rebuilt by <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> It is a very handsome stone edifice, in form of an half H; of late most admirably improved, and fitted up by the noble owner. It is totally disengaged from the gateway, walls, and other obstructions that encumbered it in the days of <HI>Plott;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See his plate viii. p. 126.</NOTE> and the grounds that environ it are layed with the sim∣plicity that forms true grandeur.</P>
<P>HERE is a gothic hall of eighty feet by twenty-one; a dining∣room of forty-two by twenty-seven; and a magnificent gallery of ninety-seven by seventeen. The other apartments are small.</P>
<P>IN the drawing-room is a fine portrait of the founder of the family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTRAIT OF LORD PAGET.</NOTE> the first Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> a three-quarters length; in a bon∣net, black gown furred, with a great forked beard, the George, a stick, and dagger. A fine performance of <HI>Holbein's.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the house I ascended to the summit of the hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE-HILL.</NOTE> on the verge of <HI>Cank</HI> heath, to an antient <HI>British</HI> post called the <HI>Castle∣hill.</HI> It is encompassed with a vast rampart and two ditches. The two entrances are opposite to each other, and before the eastern are several advanced works. It commands a vast view, and was well situated for the purposes of a temporary retreat. I refer the reader, for an account of the uses of these entrench∣ments, to my <HI>Welsh Tour</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. 412.</NOTE>; for they are common to most parts
<PB N="98" REF="114"/>
of <HI>Britain.</HI> Doctor <HI>Plott</HI> ascribes this work to King <HI>Canute;</HI> but I suspect it to be of earlier origin.</P>
<P>FROM hence is an extensive view of the chace, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CANK FOREST.</NOTE> or forest, of <HI>Cank,</HI> or <HI>Cannock,</HI> which <HI>Plott</HI> derives from the name of the <HI>Danish</HI> prince <HI>Canuti Sylva.</HI> This vast tract was once covered with oaks, but for some centuries past, has been spoiled of its honors; even old <HI>Drayton</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Polyolbion,</HI> song 12.</NOTE> deplores its losses, owing, as he says, to the avarice of the times.

<P>FROM <HI>Castle-hill</HI> I descended towards the great road, and passed by <HI>Fairwell</HI> church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Called <HI>Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae.</HI> DUGDALE.</NOTE>, once conventual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FAIRWELL CHURCH.</NOTE> belonging to a priory of <HI>Benedictine</HI> nuns.

<P>AFTER a short ride, I reached the summit of a long but gentle descent, from which is a fine view of the city of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> lying at the foot of it. The situation is delightful, in a fertile and dry soil, with small risings on almost every side. The cathedral, with its three spires, is a most striking object.</P>
<P><HI>Lichfield</HI> is a place of <HI>Saxon</HI> origin, <NOTE PLACE="marg">LICHFIELD.</NOTE> and owes its rise to <HI>Ceadda,</HI> or <HI>Chad,</HI> the great saint of <HI>Mercia.</HI> I omit the legend of the thousand Christians, disciples of St. <HI>Amphibolus,</HI> that were mar∣tyred here under <HI>Dioclesian;</HI> or the three kings slain at this place in battle, as sculptured over the-town-hall. I take up its history about the year 656, when <HI>Oswy,</HI> king of the country, established a bishoprick here, and made <HI>Dwina,</HI> or <HI>Dinma,</HI> the first prelate. To him succeeded <HI>Cellach</HI> and <HI>Trumberct;</HI> and on his demise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. CHAD.</NOTE> the fa∣mous <HI>Ceadda.</HI> This pious man at first led an eremitical life, in a cell, at the place on which now stands the church of his name, and supported himself by the milk of a white hind. In this place he was discovered by <HI>Rufine,</HI> the son of <HI>Wolphere,</HI> who was pri∣vately, instructed by him till the time of his martyrdom, before-recited. Remorse, and consequential conversion, seized the Pagan prince. As some species of expiation, he preferred the apostle to the vacant see. He built himself a small house near the church, and, with seven or eight of his brethren, during the interval of preaching, read and prayed in private. On the approach of his death, flights of angels, sang hymns over his cell. Miracles at
<PB N="101" REF="117"/>
his tomb confirmed the holiness of his life. A lunatic, that by accident escaped from his keepers, lay a night on it; and in the morning was found restored to his senses. The very earth taken out of it, was an infallible remedy for all disorders incident to man or beast.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bede Hist.</HI> lib. iv. c. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Ceadda</HI> was of course canonized; a shrine was erected in honor of him; great was the concourse of devotees: the place increased and flourished.</P>
<P>THE history of our cathedrals is; in its beginning, but the his∣tory of superstition, mixed with some truth and abundance of le∣gend: humiliating proof of the weakness of the human mind! yet all the fine arts of past times, and all the magnificent works we now so justly admire, are owing to a species of piety that every lover of the elegance of architecture must rejoice to have existed.</P>

<P>IN those of <HI>Winfrid,</HI> successor to St. <HI>Chad,</HI> in 674, <HI>Theodore,</HI> archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> thought fit to divide the bishoprick into two, and to establish the other at <HI>Sidnacester;</HI> in <HI>Lincoln∣shire,</HI> the present <HI>Stow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Winfrid</HI> disapproving this defalcation, was deprived for contumacy. The diocese might well bear di∣viding; for at that time it contained the whole kingdom of <HI>Mercia.</HI> At present, it comprehends all <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> except

<P>IN the time of Bishop <HI>Adulf, Ossa,</HI> king of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> pro∣cured liberty from the pope of erecting the fee into an arch∣bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick, in 786, and to assign him for suffragans <HI>Winchester, Hereford, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster (Leicester), Helmham,</HI> and <HI>Dunwick.</HI> This honor died with <HI>Adulf.</HI></P>
<P>A BISHOP <HI>Peter,</HI> in 1067, the year succeeding the Conquest, re∣moved the see to St. <HI>John</HI>'s, in <HI>Chester;</HI> where he died, and was interred, in 1085.</P>
<P>HIS successor, <HI>Robert de Limesey,</HI> smitten with the love of the gold and silver <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wharton's Augl. Sacr,</HI> i. 433.</NOTE> with which the pious Earl <HI>Leofric</HI> had covered the walls of his new convent at <HI>Coventry,</HI> in 1095 removed the see to that city, and at once scraped from a single beam, that sup∣ported a shrine, 500 marks worth of silver <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>William of Malmsbury,</HI> as quoted by <HI>Dugdale, Hist.

<P>I NOW speak of a prelate of a different temper;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>TON.</NOTE> to whose muni∣ficence both the church and city were highly indebted. <HI>Roger de Clinton,</HI> consecrated in 1129, took down the antient <HI>Mercian</HI> cathedral. We are not informed of the dimensions or nature of the building, any more than we are of that built by this bishop. It must have been, according to the reigning mode of the times, of the species of architecture usually called <HI>Saxon,</HI> with massy pil∣lars and round arches. There is not at present the left relique of this stile. But I am unacquainted with the accident, or calamity, which destroyed the labors of this pious prelate; who took up the cross, and died at <HI>Antioch,</HI> on a pilgrimage to the holy se∣pulchre.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="119"/>
AFTER a succession of twelve prelates, <HI>Walter de Langton,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">BISHOP LANGTON</NOTE> trea∣surer of <HI>England,</HI> was consecrated bishop of this see, in 1296. He was highly favored by <HI>Edward</HI> I. His prosperity was interrupted by the resentment of the prince, who meanly revenged on the bishop a short imprisonment he had suffered in the time of his father, for riotously destroying his deer. After a persecution and confinement of above two years, he emerged from all his difficul∣ties, and resumed his pastoral charge in a manner that did him great honor. He may be considered as the third architect of this cathedral: to him we are indebted for the present elegant pile. He laid the foundation for our Lady's chapel; an edifice of un∣common beauty, finished after his death with money left for that purpose. He built the cloysters, and expended £2,000 upon a shrine for St. <HI>Chad.</HI> He bestowed on the choir several rich vest∣ments, a chalice, and two cups of beaten gold, to the value of £200. To the vicars choral he gave a standing cup, and an annual pension of £20, and procured for them and the canons great immunities: in particular, there was an order from the king to the justices of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> that, without trial, they should hang upon the next gallows divers persons that by force kept their lands from them. This prelate also surrounded the close with a wall and ditch, made the great gate at the west end, and the postern at the south. He gave his own palace, at the west end of the close, to the vicars choral, and built a new one for himself at the east end. He partly built, or enlarged, the castle at <HI>Eccleshal,</HI> and the manors of <HI>Heywood</HI> and <HI>Shugborow,</HI> and the palace in the <HI>Strand.</HI> He finished his useful life in <HI>November</HI> 1321, and was buried in the chapel of his own founding.</P>
<P>THE cathedral continued in the state it was left by Bishop
<PB N="104" REF="120"/>
<HI>Langton,</HI> till the time of the dissolution, when the rich shrine of St. <HI>Chad,</HI> and other objects of similar devotion, fell a prey to the rapacity of the prince. The building continued in its pristine beauty till the unhappy wars of the last century, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CATHEDRAL FORTIFIED.</NOTE> when it suffered greatly by three sieges. The situation of the place on an emi∣nence, surrounded by water and by deep ditches, and fortified with walls and bastions, rendered it unhappily a proper place for a garrison.</P>
<P>IN 1643, it was possessed by the royalists of the county, under the Earl of <HI>Chesterfield:</HI> when it underwent the attack rendered memorable by the death of Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> commander of the parle∣mentary forces. His lordship, in reconnoitring the cathedral, in a wooden porch in <HI>Dams street,</HI> was shot into the eye by a mus∣ket-ball, on <HI>March</HI> 2d, 1643. This happened to be the festival of St. <HI>Chad,</HI> the patron of the church. The cavaliers attributed the direction of the fatal bullet to the influence of the Saint, in resentment of the sacrileges this nobleman was committing on his cathedral. What share the Saint had in this affair, I will not pre∣tend to say; but the musket was aimed, and the trigger drawn, by a neighboring gentleman posted in the leads, known by the name of dumb <HI>Dyot.</HI> The loss of Lord <HI>Brook</HI> gave very short respite to the garrison; which was taken almost immediately after, by Sir <HI>John Gell.</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>April,</HI> in the same year, it was attacked by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> At that time it was commanded by Colonel <HI>Rouswel;</HI> a steady governor over an enthusiastic garrison. He defended the plac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with vast resolution. A breach was made by the blowing up o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a mine. The attack was made with great bravery, but great loss
<PB N="105" REF="121"/>
At length the garrison gave up, on the most honorable con∣ditions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Clarendon,</HI> ii. 235.</NOTE>. The colonel took care to plunder the church of the communion-plate, during the time the fanatics were in possession. They used every species of profanation; hunted a cat in it with hounds, to enjoy the fine echo from the roof; and brought a calf, dressed in linen, to the font, and sprinkled it with water, in deri∣sion of baptism <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Greene</HI>'s MSS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE prince appointed Colonel <HI>Hervey Bagot</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">During the time this gentleman commanded at <HI>Lichfield,</HI> he received the following extraordinary challenge from a Captain <HI>Hunt,</HI> a parlementary com∣mander in <HI>Tamworth. Mercurius Aulicus,</HI> p. 1347.

<P>Colonel <HI>Bagot</HI> met him, and after a brisk action, whipped the fellow himself into his retreat, and narrowly missed taking him.</P>
<P>the governor; who kept possession till the ruin of the king's affairs, in 1646; when the colonel, and other commanders, being satisfied that the king had not an hundred men in any one place in the field, nor any garrison unbesieged, surrendered on very honorable terms, on the 10th of <HI>July,</HI> to Adjutant <HI>Louthian</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Articles of Surrender.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE state of this church, after so many sieges, may easily be conceived. The honor of restoring it to its former splendor, <NOTE PLACE="marg">RESTORED BY BISHOP HACKET.</NOTE> was reserved for <HI>John Hacket,</HI> presented to this see in 1661. On the very next day after his arrival, he set his coach-horses, with teams, to remove the rubbish; and in eight years time restored the ca∣thedral
<PB N="106" REF="122"/>
to its present beautiful state, at the expence of twenty thousand pounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Br. Biogr.</HI> iv. 2457. A MS. with which Mr. <HI>Greene</HI> favored me, makes the sum much less. See <HI>Appendix.</HI></NOTE>; one thousand of which was the gift of the dean and chapter; the rest was done either at his own charge, or by benefactions resulting from his own solicitations. He died in 1670. A very handsome tomb was erected in the choir to his memory, with his effigies laid recumbent on it, with a mitre on his head, and in his episcopal dress.</P>
<P>THE west front is of great elegance, adorned with the richest sculpture, and, till of late, with rows of statues of prophets, kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> &amp;c. and, above all, a very bad one of <HI>Charles</HI> II. who had contributed to the repair of the church, by a liberal gift of timber. This statue was the work of a Sir <HI>William Wilson,</HI> ori∣ginally a mason from <HI>Sutton Coldfield,</HI> who, after marrying a rich wife, arrived at the dignity of knighthood.</P>
<P>THE sculptures round the doors were very elegant; but time, or violence, hath greatly impaired their beauty.</P>
<P><HI>James</HI> II. when Duke of <HI>York,</HI> bestowed on this church the magnificent west window. The fine painted glass was given of late years, by Dean <HI>Addenbrook.</HI></P>
<P>THE northern door is extremely rich in sculptured moldings: <NOTE PLACE="marg">RICH NORTH DOOR.</NOTE> three of soliage, and three of small figures in ovals. In one of the lowest is represented a monk baptizing a person kneeling be∣fore him. Probably the former is intended for St. <HI>Chad;</HI> the lat∣ter for <HI>Wulferus.</HI> It is a misfortune, that the ornaments of this cathedral are made of such friable stone, that what fanaticism has spared, the weather has impaired.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="123"/>
IN the front are two fine spires, and a third in the centre, <NOTE PLACE="marg">FRONT.</NOTE> of a vast height, and fine proportion.</P>
<P>THE roof was till of late covered with lead, but grew so greatly out of repair, that the dean and chapter were obliged to substitute slates instead of metal, on account of the narrow revenues left to maintain this venerable pile; and, after the strictest oeconomy, they will be under the necessity of contributing from their own income, in order to complete their plan. The excellent order that all the cathedrals I have visited are in, does great credit to their members; who spare nothing from their own incomes to render them not only decent, but elegant.</P>
<P>THE body is lofty, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BODY.</NOTE> supported by pillars formed of numbers of slender columns, with neat foliated capitals. Along the walls of the ailes are rows of false arches, in the gothic stile, with a seat beneath.</P>
<P>THE upper rows of windows, in the body, are of an uncommon form, being triangular, including three circles in each.</P>
<P>IN each transept are two places, formerly chapels; at present consistory courts, and the vicar's vestry-room.</P>
<P>THE choir merits attention, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHOIR.</NOTE> on account of the elegant sculp∣ture about the windows, and the embattled gallery that runs be∣neath them. On each side are six statues, now much mutilated, placed in beautiful gothic niches, and richly painted. The first on the left is St. <HI>Peter;</HI> the next is the Virgin; the third is <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> with one leg bare, to denote her legendary wanton∣ness. The other three are St. <HI>Philip,</HI> St. <HI>James,</HI> and St. <HI>Christo∣pher,</HI> with CHRIST on his shoulders.</P>
<P>THE beauty of this choir is much impaired by the impropriety
<PB N="108" REF="124"/>
of a rich altar-piece, of <HI>Grecian</HI> architecture, terminating this ele∣gant gothic building.</P>
<P>BEHIND this is St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s chapel, <NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. MARY'S CHAPEL.</NOTE> with a stone skreen, the most elegant which can be imagined, embattled at top, and adorned with several rows of gothic niches, of most exquisite workman∣ship; each formerly containing a small statue. Beneath them are thirteen stalls, with gothic work over each. In this chapel are nine windows, more narrow, lofty, and of more elegant work than any of the others; three on each side, and three at the end.</P>
<P>In this chapel stood the shrine of St. <HI>Chad.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SHRINE OF ST. CHAD.</NOTE> Here was interred <HI>Ceolred</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Saxon Chr.</HI> 51.</NOTE>, king of the <HI>Mercians;</HI> and in later times, here was placed the magnificent tomb (on the site of the shrine) of the first Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> adorned with columns, <NOTE PLACE="marg">MONUMENTS.</NOTE> with two kneeling figures of a man and woman between the front and back pillars. These were destroyed in the blind fury of civil war; as was another fine tomb of a Lord <HI>Basset</HI> of <HI>Drayton,</HI> who died in 1389. Few indeed escaped. Of those are the effigies of the great Bishop <HI>Langton,</HI> with his pastoral staff in one hand, and the other hand in the action of benediction: another of <HI>Hugh de Pateshul,</HI> who died in 1241, remarkable for having the <HI>stigmata,</HI> or marks of our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s, wounds on the hands and feet: a respectful super∣stition of antient times. Dean <HI>Heywood</HI> is represented in his habit, and again naked, with the emaciated change which death oc∣casions.</P>
<P>HERE are several monuments within the walls, of a most fru∣gal nature, having no appearance of any part but the head and
<PB N="109" REF="125"/>
feet. From an intermediate bracket, it is probable some favorite saint might have been honored with a rich image.</P>

THE prebendal houses are built around the close. The whole property is in the church, except two houses on the south side, bordering on the pool, which, before the present causeways were made, were granted to the city, that the inhabitants might have landing-places, and access to the cathedral; which in old times had a vast concourse of devotees to the shrine of St. <HI>Chad.</HI></P>

<P>THE whole close is of exempt jurisdiction, <NOTE PLACE="marg">MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH.</NOTE> and quite indepen∣dent of the city. Its members are, a dean, precentor, chancellor, and treasurer, who have prebends annexed to their offices. There are twenty-seven other prebends, of which that of <HI>Eccleshal</HI> is an∣nexed to the bishoprick. Out of these thirty-one, the dean and four more are stiled canons residentiary; which four are chosen out of the prebendaries and dignitaries. Here are twelve minor canons: five of whom are called priest-vicars; the other seven, lay-vicars, or singing-men. Both these were formerly collegiated, and had their hall and houses. That of the priest-vicars is a handsome room, rebuilt, and usually is lent for the purposes of assemblies, and other amusements. A new house also stands on the ground once occupied by the house of the choristers: before it stood, within memory, a very pretty gate, which formed the entrance; on which was inscribed <HI>Domus Choristes.</HI></P>

In its north end formerly stood the shrine of St. <HI>Catherine,</HI> whose chauntry-priest had his stipend from the vicars-choral of the ca∣thedral. Near it is the well of the faint, where he had his first oratory; which in antient times was much frequented by de∣votees.</P>
<P>THE grey friars had a house here, <NOTE PLACE="marg">GREY FRIARS.</NOTE> founded about 1229, by Bishop <HI>Alexander,</HI> who gave certain free burgages, on which it was erected. It was destroyed by fire in 1291, but rebuilt in the thirty-sixth of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. It was granted to <HI>Richard Crum∣blethorn.</HI> At present, both house and land support an hospital at <HI>Seal,</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire.</HI> The water which now supplies the city, was granted, on St. <HI>James</HI>'s day, in 1301, by <HI>Henry Campanarius,</HI> son of <HI>Michael de Lichfield,</HI> bell-founder. <HI>Henry</HI> gave his foun∣tains
<PB N="113" REF="130"/>
at <HI>Foulwel,</HI> near <HI>Alreschaw,</HI> in pure and perpetual alms to the friars of this house, with power to cover them with a head of stones, and of carrying the pipes through his land, on condition that, whenever they wanted repair, the friars were to indemnify him and his heirs for the damage done to the ground. Several parts of the house are yet standing, and form a pleasant and com∣fortable habitation. In digging near it, was found a large tomb∣stone, with a cross fleury, surrounded by a singular inscription, to the following purpose:
<Q><L><HI>Ricardus</HI> mercator victus morte noverca</L>
<L>Qui cessat mercari pausat in hâc ierarca.</L>
<L>Exculit ephebus paucis vivento diebus</L>
<L>Ecclesiam rebus ditat variis speciebus,</L>
<L>Vivat ut in <HI>Caelis</HI> nunc mercator <HI>Michaelis.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L><HI>Richard</HI> the merchant here extended lies,</L>
<L>"Death, like a step-dame, gladly clos'd his eyes.</L>
<L>"No more he trades beyond the burning zone,</L>
<L>"But happy rests beneath this sacred stone.</L>
<L>"His benefactions to the church were great;</L>
<L>"Tho' young, he hasten'd from his mortal state.</L>
<L>"May he, tho' dead in trade, successful prove,</L>
<L>"Saint <HI>Michael</HI>'s merchant in the realms above."</L></Q></P>
<P>The stone is still to be seen there. A figure of it was sent to the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Greene,</HI> in this city. The inscription and translation are copied from the same magazine: for they ap∣pear to me to be equally faithful and ingenious.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond, stands the hospital of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, <NOTE PLACE="marg">HOSPITAL OF ST. JOHN.</NOTE> consisting of a master and twelve poor brethren. The master is a clergy∣man, who has a good house and stipend for superintending the
<PB N="114" REF="131"/>
charity, and reading daily prayers in the chapel belonging to it. The founder is uncertain. We only know that <HI>William Smith,</HI> while bishop of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. formed here a new foundation for a master, two priests, and ten poor men. <HI>Henry</HI> patronized the charity, and endowed it with the old hospi∣tal of <HI>Denhal,</HI> and the lands and impropriation of <HI>Burton</HI> church, both in <HI>Wiral,</HI> in <HI>Cheshire. Smith</HI> also founded the grammar-school in this city <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland Itin.</HI> iv. 117.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMONG other things worthy of attention in this city, is the ca∣binet of curiosities, antient, natural, and artificial, in the posses∣sion of Mr. <HI>Greene,</HI> surgeon. It contains numbers of most valu∣able and instructive pieces in each class. A visit to my worthy friend is the more agreeable, as he takes great pleasure in gratify∣ing the curiosity of all that favor him with their company.</P>
<P>THE city is divided from the close by a large piece of water, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY.</NOTE> originally three; at present remain only this and another, called <HI>Stowpool,</HI> a little to the east. Bishop <HI>Langton</HI> made the causeway, bridges, and dams, at each end of the pool. Before that, the great road went round <HI>Stowpool,</HI> near <HI>Stow</HI> church. The city is neat, and well built; contains little more than three thousand souls; is a place of great passage, has a considerable manufacture of sail-cloth, and a small manufacture of saddle-cloths and tammies.</P>
<P>IT was originally governed by a guild and guild-master; <NOTE PLACE="marg">HOW GOVERNED.</NOTE> which were the origin of corporations, and took rise before the time of the Conquest; the name being <HI>Saxon,</HI> signifying a fraternity, which unites and flings its effects into a common stock, and is derived
<PB N="115" REF="132"/>
from <HI>Gildan, to pay</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spelman,</HI> 260. <HI>Kennet's Gloss. to Paroch. Antiq.</HI></NOTE>. A guild was a public feast, to commemo∣rate the time of the institution; and the guild-hall the place in which the fraternity assembled: These (at lest after the Conquest) paid fines to the crown, and formed part of its revenue. <HI>Richard</HI> I. enabled it to purchase lands to the value of ten pounds; but it was not chartered till the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. who formed it into a regular corporation by its first charter. This was confirmed by Queen <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> II. granted a new one, confirming all the others.</P>
<P>IT is governed by a recorder, high steward, sheriff, two bailiffs, a town-clerk, and coroner. One of the bailiffs is elected by the bishop; the others to be elected annually by and out of the bre∣thren which form the corporation. The city has power of life and death within their jurisdiction; a court of record; and a pie-powder <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">So called from <HI>pier poudreux,</HI> or dusty feet, because country people usually come with dusty shoes to fairs. See Doctor <HI>Pettingal</HI>'s able dissertation on the word, <HI>Archaeol.</HI> i. 190.</NOTE> court, which regulated the disputes arising in fairs.</P>
<P>THE district of the city and county of <HI>Lichfield</HI> is called the sheriff's ride, <NOTE PLACE="marg">DISTRICT.</NOTE> and lies at unequal distances around. In this the corporation has exclusive jurisdiction.</P>
<P>THIS city sent representatives in the thirty-third of <HI>Edward</HI> I;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MEMBERS.</NOTE> the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> II. and first, fourteenth, and twenty-seventh of <HI>Edward</HI> III; from whose reign they were discontinued, till that of <HI>Edward</HI> VI <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis's Notitia Parliam.</HI> iii. 50.</NOTE>. The members are returned by the sheriff and bailiffs. The right of
<PB N="116" REF="133"/>
electing is in the freemen by servitude; in the burgage-holders, or such who live in the town and pay a small acknowlegement to the corporation; and in the freeholders of forty shillings a year, within the sheriff's ride.</P>
<P><HI>Lichfield</HI> is quite an open town: all the traces of the ditches made by Bishop <HI>Clinton</HI> are lost, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> as well as of the tower, on which he is said to have bestowed such great expence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Goodwin,</HI> 367.</NOTE>. The name only of <HI>Castle Ditch,</HI> in the east part of the town, preserves its memory. Probably in this fortress <HI>Richard</HI> II. kept his sump∣tuous <HI>Christmas,</HI> in 1397, when he consumed two hundred tuns of wine, and two thousand oxen <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow's Chr.</HI> 318.</NOTE>; but with more certainty we know that it was his place of confinement, in his road to the tower of <HI>London,</HI> in 1399, a captive prince. The unhappy <HI>Richard</HI> here attempted his escape, by slipping from the window of the high tower into a garden; but being seen, was carried back to his imprisonment <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same, 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Wall,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">WALL, OR ETOCETUM.</NOTE> the antient <HI>Etocetum,</HI> lies about a mile and a half from <HI>Lichfield,</HI> on the <HI>Watling-street</HI> road, on a rising ground. There are still some remains of the walls to be seen, mixed with roots of some very old ash-trees. Coins and tiles evince it to have been the <HI>Roman Etocetum,</HI> as well as its distance from <HI>Pennocrucium,</HI> a place somewhere on the river <HI>Penk,</HI> not far from <HI>Penkridge;</HI> but the site not well ascertained. The <HI>Watling-street</HI> road enters the county near <HI>Tamworth,</HI> and is continued into <HI>Shropshire,</HI> as far as <HI>Wroxeter.</HI> Near <HI>Wall,</HI> another <HI>Roman</HI> road crosses it; and at the intersection is an exploratory mount, about forty feet in dia∣meter, called <HI>Offlo,</HI> in sight of <HI>Borough Cop,</HI> near <HI>Lichfield,</HI> on which
<PB N="117" REF="134"/>
the martyrdom of the thousand Christians, in the tenth persecu∣tion, is said to have happened. This is asserted by <HI>John Ross,</HI> a <HI>Warwickshire</HI> antiquary, who died in 1491, near twelve hundred years after the event; which he alone relates.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>lows,</HI> which have the same signification as <HI>laws</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">LOWS.</NOTE> and mean a mount, and placed here in sight of one another, were usually designed as exploratory, and for the repetition of signals; and sometimes were sepulchral.</P>
<P>I MADE one day an excursion in search of the seven <HI>Tumuli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TUMULI.</NOTE> which are said, in the first volume of the <HI>Archaeologia,</HI> p. 57, to be near this town. As I could discover only <HI>Borough Cop</HI> and <HI>Offlo,</HI> which fall within the description, I was obliged to extend my ride. I passed through <HI>Whittington,</HI> a village with a church and spire-steeple, about two miles N. E. of <HI>Lichfield.</HI> Passed through <HI>Fisherwick</HI> park, a fine seat of the Earl of <HI>Donnegal,</HI> built from a design of Mr. <HI>Brown</HI>'s: the grounds bounded by the <HI>Tame,</HI> a beautiful river. <HI>Elford</HI> church, village, and house, the seat of the late Earl of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> form a pretty groupe of objects on the op∣posite bank. I forded the river, and went by <HI>Elford Low,</HI> a verdant mount, which Doctor <HI>Plott</HI> proved, from examination, to have been sepulchral; but, from its situation and elevation, I suspect it might have had on it a <HI>specula,</HI> or watch-tower; and that all the others might have been for the same use, and to repeat sig∣nals in time of danger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Vegelius,</HI> Not. ad lib. iii. 307.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Elford,</HI> before the Conquest, was possessed by Earl <HI>Algar;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ELFORD.</NOTE> after which the Conqueror himself seized it for his own use. About <HI>Henry</HI> the Third's reign, <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Arderne</HI> was lord of it, and
<PB N="118" REF="135"/>
his posterity was seised of it till the marriage of <HI>Maud,</HI> sole heir∣ess of Sir <HI>John Arderne,</HI> with <HI>Thomas,</HI> second son of Sir <HI>John Stanley</HI> of <HI>Latham,</HI> Knight; he dying in 1463, the 6th of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> IV. <HI>Margaret,</HI> his daughter, conveyed it by marriage to the <HI>Stantons:</HI> by the same means it passed from the <HI>Stantons</HI> to the <HI>Smiths;</HI> from the <HI>Smiths</HI> to the <HI>Huddlestons,</HI> and from the <HI>Huddle∣stons</HI> to the <HI>Bowes.</HI> So very rapid was the change of family in this place! It continued with the <HI>Bowes</HI> four or five genera∣tions; but, about the latter end of the last century, became the property of the Honorable <HI>Craven Howard,</HI> by marriage with <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of <HI>George Bowes,</HI> Esquire: and continued in his posterity (the Earls of <HI>Suffolk</HI>) till the death of the late able and honest peer; when it devolved to his sister, the Honorable <HI>Frances Howard.</HI></P>
<P>IN the church are several fine monuments, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> in the antient stile.</P>
<P>IN the north wall is a painted figure, with curled hair, gown down to his knees, buskins on his legs, sword, gold chain, his hands closed, and a ring on his thumb.</P>
<P>AN alabaster tomb of an <HI>Arderne,</HI> in a conic helmet, mail round his neck, chin, and shoulders, and a collar of S S: one of his hands clasps that of his wife, who has on a rich pearl bon∣net, a cloak, and gown. Around the tomb are various figures, in the dress of the times.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>William Smith,</HI> who died in 1500, lies armed, has a collar of S S. and is represented beardless. He lies between his two wives: <HI>Isabel,</HI> in long hair and a coronet, daughter of <HI>John Nevil</HI> Marquis of <HI>Montacute,</HI> brother to the great Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> and <HI>Anne,</HI> daughter of <HI>William Stanton,</HI> by whom he acquired this
<PB N="119" REF="136"/>
place. Monks, and coats of arms, surround the tomb: the first, to express his piety; the last, to gratify the vanity of sur∣vivors.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>John Stanley,</HI> son of <HI>Thomas Stanley</HI> and <HI>Maud Arderne,</HI> lies under an arch, with both hands supplicatory, in armor, with a mail muffler. His head rests on a helm, with the Eagle and Child, the cognizance of the <HI>Stanleys.</HI></P>
<P>UNDER another arch is his eldest son, a child with curled hair, and in a long gown, recumbent: one hand points to his ear; the other holds a ball, the unfortunate instrument of his death; on which was inscribed <HI>Ubi dolor ibi digitus.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT two miles further, in a place called <HI>Elford Park Farm,</HI> I discovered the site of the seven <HI>Tumuli,</HI> or <HI>Barrows:</HI> only one exists, the rest having been destroyed within a few years; that which remains is small, and evidently sepulchral. There had probably been a battle on this spot during the <HI>heptarchy:</HI> whe∣ther between <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI> or two <HI>Saxon</HI> princes, is un∣certain.</P>
<P><HI>Croxal</HI> church stands on an eminence. Within are two tombs, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CROXAL CHURCH.</NOTE> with the figures of an armed man and his wife, curiously engra∣ven on each. One commemorates <HI>John Horton,</HI> of <HI>Caton,</HI> and his spouse, <HI>Anne,</HI> daughter of <HI>John Curzon,</HI> of this place. He died in the year 1500. His name is expressed in form of a <HI>rebus;</HI> the word <HI>Hor</HI> cut upon a tun.</P>
<P>THE other tomb is of <HI>George Curzon,</HI> Esquire, and his wife <HI>Catharine,</HI> who died in 1605. By the marriage of their only daughter <HI>Mary,</HI> to the famous Sir <HI>Edward Sackville</HI> Earl of <HI>Dor∣set,</HI> it was conveyed to that noble family, in which it still re∣mains.
<PB N="120" REF="137"/>
The <HI>Curzons</HI> had been possessed of it ever since the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> I.</P>
<P>PASS by <HI>Hazelar</HI> hamlet and chapel. The last is prebendal, and at present converted into a pig-stye. Ride for some time by the side of the little river <HI>Mease,</HI> the boundary, in this part, be∣tween <HI>Staffordshire</HI> and <HI>Derbyshire.</HI> A little further is the village and church of <HI>Clifton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CLIFTON.</NOTE> usually called <HI>Clifton Camville,</HI> from a family of that name, who possessed it from the year 1200, or the second of King <HI>John,</HI> to about the year 1315. The spire of the church is extremely elegant, joined to the tower by flying buttresses. In the church is a tomb, with the effigies of Sir <HI>John Vernon</HI> of <HI>Har∣leston,</HI> in this neighborhood, and Dame <HI>Allen,</HI> his wife. He is dressed in a bonnet and long gown, with a chain from his neck, as usual with people of worship; for he had been one of the king's counsel, and <HI>custos rotulorum</HI> of the county of <HI>Derby.</HI> His wife is dressed in a square hood, with a purse, knife, and beads by her side. They died in 1545.</P>
<P>VISIT <HI>Thorp Constantine,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">THORP.</NOTE> a small church close by the seat of my matrimonial relation, <HI>William Inge,</HI> Esquire, who deservedly bears the respectable and useful character of being the best justice of any country gentleman in <HI>England.</HI> The living is in his gift, and the whole parish his property. The manor was once belonging to the see of <HI>Ely;</HI> for it appears that <HI>Hotham,</HI> bishop of that diocese in 1316, obtained for it a charter of free warren.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Scrope,</HI> favorite of <HI>Henry</HI> V. beheaded for his un∣grateful plot against his master, left to this church a vestment worth 26<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> on condition the priest should pray for his

<P>I CONTINUED this little ramble to <HI>Sekindon,</HI> a mile distant, on the edge of <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> remarkable for a lofty artificial mount, the keep of a <HI>Saxon</HI> castle, with a flat area beneath; at the bot∣tom are the remains of a great rampart, and the whole surrounded with a deep ditch. This place is celebrated for the battle be∣tween <HI>Ethelbald,</HI> king of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> and <HI>Cuthred,</HI> king of the <HI>West Saxons,</HI> in 755 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Saxon Chr.</HI> 59.</NOTE>, when <HI>Ethelbald,</HI> disdaining flight, was slain by <HI>Beonred;</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Brompton,</HI> 769. <HI>In∣gulphus,</HI> 853.</NOTE> one of his own officers, who, for a short space, usurped the kingdom.</P>
<P>ABOUT four miles farther lies <HI>Tamworth,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">TAMWORTH</NOTE> between the conflux of the <HI>Tame</HI> and the <HI>Ankor,</HI> which formed at this place the ap∣pearance of an island; its <HI>Saxon</HI> name being <HI>Tameneordige</HI> and <HI>Tamanweorthe; ige</HI> signifying an island. It had long been the residence of the <HI>Mercian</HI> princes, who preferred it on account of its pleasant situation, and the quantity of woodland, which afforded them in plenty the pleasures of the chase. <HI>Offa</HI> dates a grant, in 781, to the monks of <HI>Worcester,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A ROYAL RESIDENCE.</NOTE> from his royal palace at <HI>Tam∣worth. Ceonulf, Bernwulf,</HI> and <HI>Burthred,</HI> date other charters, in the years 814, 841, and 854, from the same place <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale's Warwicksh.</HI> ii. 1130. <HI>Plott's Staffordsh.</HI> 410.</NOTE>. The pre∣cinct of their residence was an enormous ditch, forty-five feet wide, protecting the town on the north, west, and east; the ri∣vers serving as a defence on the other side. The ditch is filled up in many places, yet still there are vestiges of it, and also of two mounts, on which probably stood two small towers.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="139"/>
<HI>Tamworth</HI> was totally ruined by the incursions of the <HI>Danes:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">RUINED BY THE DANES.</NOTE> at length was restored by the celebrated <HI>Ethelfleda,</HI> who, <NOTE PLACE="marg">RESTORED BY ETHELFLEDA.</NOTE> in the spring of 913, erected a tower <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Saxon Chr.</HI> 104.</NOTE> on the artificial mount on which the present castle stands. Here, in 920, she finished her glorious life, and in 922 she received, I may say, posthumous honors, by the assemblage of the <HI>Mercian</HI> tribes she had conquered, who, with the princes of <HI>North Wales,</HI> here acknowleged the sovereign power of her brother <HI>Edward,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 110.</NOTE> probably obtained by her valour and prudence.</P>
<P>THE town, or borough, as it was called on the Conquest, con∣tinued part of the royal demesne, but was afterwards set at a certain rent to the lords of the castle; the first of whom, after that event, <NOTE PLACE="marg">MARMIONS.</NOTE> was <HI>Robert Marmion,</HI> one of the followers of the Conqueror, on whom it was bestowed. His posterity remained masters of it for some generations, holding of the crown <HI>in capite,</HI> by the service of finding three knights at their own costs, for forty days, in the wars of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>ON the death of <HI>Philip Marmion,</HI> in 1291, the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> I. this fortress descended to his eldest daughter <HI>Joan,</HI> wife of <HI>William Mortein;</HI> who dying without issue, it fell three years after, by agreement among the co-heirs, to <HI>Joan,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">FREVILES.</NOTE> a relation of <HI>Philip Marmion,</HI> and wife of <HI>Alexander Frevile.</HI> The <HI>Freviles</HI> by this means owned it till the year 1419, or seventh of <HI>Henry</HI> V. when Sir <HI>Baldwyn Frevile</HI> dying childless, <HI>Thomas Ferrers,</HI> second son of <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Ferrers,</HI> of <HI>Groby,</HI> became master of it, in right of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his wife, eldest of the three sisters of Sir <HI>Baldwyn.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">FERRERS.</NOTE> The <HI>Ferrers</HI> held it till the beginning of the present

century; when it passed into the family of the <HI>Comptons,</HI> by the marriage of <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> with <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> sister to <HI>Robert</HI> Lord <HI>Tamworth,</HI> grandson and heir apparent to <HI>Robert</HI> Earl <HI>Ferrers,</HI> who had obtained it by his marriage, in 1688, with <HI>Anne,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Humphrey Ferrers,</HI> of this place. Lady <HI>Charlotte Compton,</HI> sole surviving daughter of the match, Baroness <HI>de Ferrers</HI> in right of her mother, married the present Lord <HI>Townshend,</HI> whose son, now Lord <HI>De Ferrers,</HI> enjoys the place. I must not forget to add, that Sir <HI>John Baldwyn,</HI> Knight, on the coronation of <HI>Richard</HI> II. claimed the honor of being the king's champion, by virtue of tenure of this castle (a service performed by his predecessors the <HI>Marmions);</HI> but it being found that the <HI>Marmions</HI> held their right only from the tenure of <HI>Scrivelsby</HI> ma∣nor, it was challenged by Sir <HI>John Dymock,</HI> the then owner, and adjudged to him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale's Warwicksh.</HI> ii. 1134.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TILL the present century it had been the seat of its lords. <NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLES.</NOTE> The rooms are numerous, but inconvenient and irregular, except a dining-room and drawing-room; each with large projecting windows. Around the first are painted great numbers of coats of arms of the family of the <HI>Ferrers,</HI> and its alliances. The chim∣ney-piece of the drawing-room is richly carved, in the old taste, and beneath the arms is the motto, <HI>Only one.</HI></P>
<P>THE beauty of the situation of <HI>Tamworth</HI> is seen from the castle to great advantage, varied with rich meadows, two bridges over the <HI>Tame</HI> and the <HI>Ankor,</HI> and the rivers wandering pic∣turesquely along the country. <HI>Michael Drayton,</HI> born on the

banks of the last, most elegantly paints out his love-complaints, and celebrates the last in the sweetest strain.
<Q><L>Clear <HI>Ankor,</HI> on whose silver-sanded shore</L>
<L>My soul-shrin'd saint, my fair idea lies:</L>
<L>A blessed brook, whose milk-white swans adore</L>
<L>Thy crystal stream, refined by her eyes;</L>
<L>Where sweet myrrh-breathing <HI>zephyr</HI> in the spring</L>
<L>Gently distils his nectar-dropping showers;</L>
<L>Where nightingales in <HI>Arden</HI> sit and sing</L>

<L>Say thus, fair brook, when thou shalt see thy queen:</L>

<L>And thou, sweet <HI>Ankor,</HI> art my <HI>Helicon.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>THE town is large and well-built; part is situated in <HI>Stafford∣shire,</HI> and part in <HI>Warwickshire;</HI> for which reason its members are returned by the sheriffs of both counties <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis Notitia Parl,</HI> iii. 51.</NOTE>. It first sent represen∣tatives in the fifth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> and was made a cor∣poration two years before; which consists of two bailiffs, a recor∣der, and twenty-four capital burgesses. The right of voting is in the inhabitants paying scot and lot.</P>
<P>THE church is large, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> built at different times. Near the chan∣cel are two great round arches, with <HI>zigzag</HI> moldings, which were prior to the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. when this species of arch fell into disuse. Here are numbers of monuments, some antient, of the <HI>Freviles</HI> and <HI>Ferrers,</HI> with their figures, and those of their wives.
<PB N="125" REF="142"/>
Here is also a handsome monument of <HI>John Ferrers,</HI> Esquire, who died in 1680, aged 52; and of his son Sir <HI>Humphry Ferrers,</HI> knight, who died in 1678, aged 25. Their figures are repre∣sented in marble, as big as life, in a <HI>Roman</HI> dress, long flowing hair, and half-kneeling. Sir <HI>Humphry</HI> was the last male heir of his line.</P>
<P>THE church is dedicated to St. <HI>Editha,</HI> daughter to king <HI>Edgar;</HI> who, preferring the cloistered life to the troubles of a throne, re∣ceived after death the honor of saintship. It has been said, that she founded here a nunnery, and that <HI>Robert Marmion,</HI> lord of this place, received from her very sensible marks of resentment, for daring to remove the holy sisters. St. <HI>Editha</HI> descended from heaven, and, while <HI>Marmion</HI> was lying down, after a costly feast, in <HI>Tamworth</HI> castle, she admonished him to restore them to their rights, and, by way of memorandum, gave him such a blow with her crosier on his side, that he rose in extreme torments; which instantly ceased on repentance and restitution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale, Baron,</HI> i. 375.</NOTE>.

<P>In 1286, <NOTE PLACE="marg">HOSPITAL.</NOTE> the fifteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> I. <HI>Philip Marmion</HI> dedicated here an hospital to St. <HI>James,</HI> intending to found a house of <HI>Premonstrensians;</HI> but, till he could execute his design, granted it to <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Combery-hall,</HI> with all its appurtenances, and pas∣ture in <HI>Ashfield</HI> for four oxen and two horses, on condition it should celebrate mass for his soul <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 502.</NOTE>.

<P>FROM <HI>Tamworth</HI> I returned to <HI>Lichfield,</HI> and resumed my jour∣ney along the <HI>London</HI> road.</P>
<P>ABOUT two miles from the city, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SWINFEN.</NOTE> see on the left <HI>Swinfen,</HI> the seat of a gentleman of the same name; happy in its beautiful de∣mesne, ornamented with an extent of water, meads, and hanging-woods.

The executors of the last of that line, a Doctor <HI>Swinfen,</HI> sold it, in the present century, to Mr. <HI>Swinfen,</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> in whose family it continues.</P>
<P>A LITTLE farther, the great <HI>Watling-street</HI> crosses the road near <HI>Weford,</HI> or the ford on the way. This is seated on <HI>Blackbrook,</HI> a small stream, now furnished with a bridge. The stream runs through a beautiful tract of narrow but rich meadows, prettily bounded by low and fertile risings. This spot had been the scene of much civil rage. A <HI>Purefoy</HI> was here slain by Sir <HI>Henry Wil∣loughby,</HI>

<P>NEAR this place I entered WARWICKSHIRE, in the parish of <HI>Middleton;</HI> from which the <HI>Willoughbies</HI> take their title. The road is over part of the common of <HI>Sutton Cofield,</HI> which is finely bounded on the left by a long-continued range of woods.</P>
<P>A FEW miles farther, I passed <HI>Moxhull</HI> hall, <NOTE PLACE="marg">MOXHULL.</NOTE> the neat-dressed seat of Mr. <HI>Hacket,</HI> a descendant of the worthy bishop of that name; whose son, by marriage with <HI>Mary,</HI> eldest daughter of <HI>John L'Isle,</HI> became owner of it, after it had been in the <HI>L'Isles,</HI> or <HI>de Insula,</HI> for some hundreds of years <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Warwicksh,</HI> ii. 936.</NOTE>.

<P>ABOUT half a mile from <HI>Curdworth,</HI> I crossed the <HI>Tame</HI> at <HI>Curd∣worth Bridge,</HI> and a mile further the <HI>Cole,</HI> The view from hence, of the stream watering a range of rich meadows, bounded on one side by hanging-woods, is extremely agreeable; as is, a little far∣ther, the town of <HI>Coleshill,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">COLESHILL.</NOTE> covering the steep ascent of a lofty brow, on whose top appears the handsome church and elegant spire.</P>
<P>THE place had been long a royal demesne; was possessed by <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and afterwards by the Conqueror. It fell, either in his reign or that of <HI>William Rufus,</HI> into the hands of the <HI>Clintons,</HI> in whom it continued till the year 1353, the twenty-seventh of <HI>Edward</HI> III; when it passed to Sir <HI>John de Mountfort,</HI> by virtue of his marriage with <HI>Joan,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>John Clinton.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Warwicksh.</HI> ii. 925.</NOTE> The <HI>Mountforts</HI> held it till the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. when, by the cruel attainder and execution of Sir <HI>Simon Mountfort,</HI> for send∣ing thirty pounds, by his younger son <HI>Henry,</HI> to <HI>Perkin Warbeck,</HI> on supposition that <HI>Perkin</HI> was the real son of his former master <HI>Edward</HI> IV.

<P>IN the upper part of the town is a small PLACE, neatly built. The church-yard commands a fine view of a rich country. The vicarage was formerly belonging to <HI>Markgate,</HI> in <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> but is now in the gift of its lord. The spire, lofty as it is, was fif∣teen feet higher, before it had been struck with lightning in 1550; when the inhabitants sold one of the bells towards the repairs.</P>
<P>IN the church are numbers of fine tombs of the <HI>Digbies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> with their figures recumbent. Among others, that of the above∣mentioned <HI>Simon,</HI> and his spouse <HI>Alice,</HI> who lie under a tomb erected by himself. He died in 1519: she survived him, and left by her will a silver penny to every child under the age of nine, whose parents were housekeepers in this parish (beginning with those next the church) on condition that, every day in the year, after the sacring of the high mass, they should kneel down at the altar and say five paternosters, an ave, and a creed, for her soul, that of her husband, and all Christian souls; and the annual sum of six shillings and eight pence to the dean, for seeing the same duly performed, and likewise for performing the same himself. At the reformation, this custom was changed. The inhabitants

<P>THE figure of <HI>Simon Digby</HI> is in armor, with lank hair, and bare-headed. His grandson <HI>John,</HI> and great grandson <HI>George,</HI> knighted at the siege of <HI>Zutphen,</HI> are represented in the same manner, with their wives. The first died in 1558; the last in 1586. These are of alabaster, and painted.</P>
<P>THE tomb of <HI>Reginald,</HI> son of <HI>Simon,</HI> who died in 1549, differs. His figure, and that of his wife, are engraven on a flat slab of marble, with twelve of their children at their feet.</P>
<P>ON a pedestal, with an urn at the top, is an inscription to <HI>Kil∣dare</HI> Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> of <HI>Geashil,</HI> in the kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who died in 1661; and on the opposite side is another, in memory of his lady, who died in 1692, drawn up by Bishop <HI>Hough,</HI> forming a character uncommonly amiable and exemplary; the integrity of that worthy prelate giving sanction to every line.</P>
<P>I FELT great pleasure in perusing an epitaph, by a grateful mistress, to the memory of a worthy domestic, <HI>Mary Wheely,</HI> whom she stiles an excellent servant and good friend; for what is a faithful servant but an humble friend?</P>
<P>BENEATH two arches are two antient figures of cross-legged knights, armed in mail, with short surtouts, in all respects alike; only one has a dog, the other a lion, at his feet. On their shields are two <HI>fleurs de lis,</HI> which denote them to have been some of the

<P>I OBSERVE, that the piety of the Catholics has given the same attitude to several of the <HI>Sherborns,</HI> in the church of <HI>Mitton,</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> who were interred in the last century; so that I suspect it to have sometimes been considered merely as a reverential sign of our SAVIOUR'S suffering.</P>
<P>THE deserted seat of the <HI>Digbies</HI> lies about a mile or two from the town, <NOTE PLACE="marg">COLESHILL HALL.</NOTE> in a fine park. The house consists but of one story, besides garrets; yet the apartments are numerous, approachable by strange and unintelligible access to all that are unacquainted with them, according to the stile of old buildings.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Coleshill</HI> I descended to pay a respectful pilgrimage to <HI>Blithe Hall,</HI> the seat of the great antiquary Sir <HI>William Dugdale;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BLITHE HALL.</NOTE> from whose indefatigable labors, his successors in the science draw such endless helps.

As lord keeper, dispirited, from the melancholy apprehensions he had of the approaching calamities of the times. For a while he temporized with the views of the opposition. At length, finding the resolution of the leaders to seize on the seals, and make use of them against his royal master, he gave them up to a messenger, appointed for that purpose, and followed them, at the hazard of his life, to the king at <HI>York;</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Clarendon,</HI> ii. 574.</NOTE> where he loyally resumed their use, till his death, at <HI>Oxford,</HI> in 1645; when he at once performed the functions of lord keeper, privy-counsellor, and colonel of a regiment of foot.</P>

Mr. <HI>Ashmole</HI> was doubly engaged to the worthy owner of this house: first, by the friendship resulting from the congenial turn of their studies; and again, by his alliance with Sir <HI>William,</HI> in his marriage with his daughter <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which proved a source of great generosity, on his part, towards his father-in-law and his family. By his portrait, drawn by <HI>Nave,</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Probably <HI>Neve.</HI></NOTE> in 1664, in his he∣rald's

coat, he appears to have been a good-looking man, in long hair, with a view of <HI>Windsor</HI> in the back-ground.</P>
<P>FROM hence I visited <HI>Maxstoke</HI> castle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">MAXSTOKE CASTLE.</NOTE> three miles south-east, most of the way through fields. The castle is very entire, and stands on a plain, in a most sequestered spot, surrounded with trees, and guarded by a moat. It is of a square form: at each cor∣ner is an hexagonal tower, and at the entrance a fine gateway, with a tower of the same form with the rest on each side. The gates are in their original state, covered with plates of iron. Above, are the holes for pouring of hot sand, or melted lead, on assailants, and the cavity which once held the portcullis. These gates were made in the time of <HI>Humphry Stafford</HI> earl (afterwards duke) of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> He fixed on them his arms (still remain∣ing) impaled with those of his wife, <HI>Anne Nevil;</HI> supported by two antelopes, derived from his mother, as one of the daughters of <HI>Thomas Woodstock,</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester;</HI> and added the burning nave, or knot, the cognizance of his own ancestors. Within the court the walls are pierced with divers cells, the antient casernes of the garrison.</P>
<P>MUCH of the habitable part is still standing, but part was burnt by accident; what remains is the dwelling-house of Mr. <HI>Dilkes,</HI> in whose family it has been for several generations. The great vault ribbed with stone, the old chapel, and kitchen, still remain; and the noble old hall, and a great dining-room with a most cu∣rious carved door and chimney, are still in use.</P>
<P>AFTER the Conquest, <NOTE PLACE="marg">OWNERS.</NOTE> it was given to <HI>Turchil de Warwick;</HI> from one of his posterity it was granted to the <HI>Limesies,</HI> lords of <HI>Long Icbinton</HI> and <HI>Solibull;</HI> from them to the <HI>Odingfells;</HI> and from the <HI>Odingfells,</HI> by <HI>Ida,</HI> eldest daughter of the last of the name, to the

great family of the <HI>Clintons</HI> before mentioned, who made it their chief seat. In 1437, the sixteenth of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. Sir <HI>William de Clinton</HI> exchanged it with <HI>Humphry</HI> earl of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> with whom it became a favorite residence. On the execution of his son <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> in 1483, the first of <HI>Richard</HI> III. it was seized by the king. <HI>Richard,</HI> on his march towards <HI>Notting∣ham,</HI> ordered all the inner buildings of <HI>Kenelworth</HI> castle to be re∣moved here <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale,</HI> ii. 995.</NOTE>. After his defeat and death in <HI>Bosworth</HI> field, this place reverted to <HI>Edward,</HI> son of the last duke; who fell a victim, in 1521, to <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. a tyrant greater, and more inexcusable, than him who destroyed the father. The estates, again forfeited, were granted to Sir <HI>William Compton,</HI> a favorite, and gallant tilter, in the reign of the former, and ancestor of the Earl of <HI>Northampton.</HI> In 1596, his great grandson, <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Compton,</HI> conveyed it to Lord Keeper <HI>Egerton,</HI> who, in two years after, sold it to <HI>Thomas Dilke,</HI> Esquire; in whose family it remains.</P>
<P>I DID not visit the neighboring priory of <HI>Maxstoke;</HI> so shall say no more of it; than that it was founded in 1336, by Sir <HI>William de Clinton,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> and peopled with canons regular of St. <HI>Augustin</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 583.</NOTE></P>
<P>RETURNED through <HI>Coleshill,</HI> and at a small distance, on the left of the road, digressed to <HI>Packington,</HI> the seat of the Earl of <HI>Ails∣ford.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PACKINGTON.</NOTE> The manor antiently belonged to the priory of <HI>Kenelworth,</HI> being granted to it by <HI>Geoffry de Clinton,</HI> lord chamberlain to <HI>Herny</HI> II: At the dissolution, it was sold for the sum of six hun∣dred and twenty-one pounds and one penny, to <HI>John Fisher,</HI> Esquire, gentleman-pensioner to <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and four succeeding

monarchs. By the marriage of <HI>Mary</HI> daughter and heiress of Sir <HI>Clement Fisher,</HI> Baronet, with <HI>Heneage,</HI> second Earl of <HI>Ailsford,</HI> the place was transferred to that noble family. The situation has of late years been highly improved by the change of the road. The grounds are prettily sloped by nature, are well wooded, and the bottom filled with two pleasing pieces of water. The house has also undergone many alterations; is a plain convenient building; except on one side, where opens a <HI>loggio</HI> (in our climate) most admi∣rably adapted for the encouragement of rheums and rheumatisms.</P>
<P>WITHIN is a good portrait of its founder, <HI>John Fisher;</HI> a half∣length, with a square white beard, close black cap, upright ruff, and black jacket.</P>
<P>A BEAUTIFUL picture of <HI>Henrietta Maria,</HI> consort to <HI>Charles</HI> I. She is represented sitting, in blue, with roses in her hand, and her thorny crown by her.</P>
<P>HERE is also a portrait of <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> in his robes, father to the Countess Dowager of <HI>Ailsford.</HI></P>
<P>THE country here begins to lose the comforts of a gravelly soil, and changes to the wet-retaining clay. At the pleasant village of <HI>Mireden</HI> it is uncommonly deep, <NOTE PLACE="marg">MIREDEN.</NOTE> but by the assistance of turn∣pikes become an excellent road. The pretty houses on each side of the way, and the magnificent inn, famed for time immemorial for its excellent malt-liquor, with the various embellishments (made by the old inn-keeper, <HI>Reynolds</HI>) of gateway, little ponds, statues, and other whims, enliven the spot greatly.</P>
<P>THE church is seated a little higher up, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> on an eminence. Within is a handsome alabaster tomb of <HI>John Wyard,</HI> in armour and mail, with sword and dagger by his side; his arms a cinquefoil on his breast. This gentleman had been 'squire (as the inscription re∣lates)
<PB N="137" REF="154"/>
to <HI>Thomas de Beauchamp</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and founder of a chauntry in this church; near which he had his residence. He was also knight of the shire for this county, in the second year of <HI>Richard</HI> II.</P>
<P>HERE is another tomb, with a figure in stone, supposed to have been that of one of the <HI>Walshes,</HI> the antient lords of this manor. His figure, as well as the former, is recumbent, with their hands in the action of supplication: but this gentleman has a short skirt over the lower part of his armour.</P>
<P>THE antient name of this place was <HI>Alspath,</HI> or <HI>Ailespede,</HI> even till the beginning of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI; about which time, becoming a great thoroughfare, it got the name of <HI>Myreden; den</HI> signifying a bottom, and <HI>myre,</HI> dirt: and I can well vouch for the propriety of the appellation, before the institution of turn∣pikes.</P>
<P>IN <HI>March</HI> 1739-40, I changed my <HI>Welsh</HI> school for one nearer to the capital, <NOTE PLACE="marg">OLD FASHION OF TRAVELLING.</NOTE> and travelled in the <HI>Chester</HI> stage; then no despi∣cable vehicle for country gentlemen. The first day, with much labor, we got from <HI>Chester</HI> to <HI>Whichurch,</HI> twenty miles; the second day, to the <HI>Welsh Harp;</HI> the third, to <HI>Coventry;</HI> the fourth, to <HI>Nor∣thampton;</HI> the fifth, to <HI>Dunstable;</HI> and, as a wonderous effort, on the last, to <HI>London</HI> before the commencement of night. The strain and labor of six good horses, sometimes eight, drew us through the sloughs of <HI>Mireden,</HI> and many other places. We were con∣stantly out two hours before day, and as late at night; and in the depth of winter proportionably later.</P>
<P>Families which travelled in their own carriages, contracted with <HI>Benson</HI> and Co. and were dragged up in the same number of days, by three sets of able horses.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="155"/>
THE single gentlemen, then a hardy race, equipped in jack∣boots and trowsers, up to their middle, rode post through thick and thin, and, guarded against the mire, defied the frequent stumble and fall; arose and pursued their journey with alacrity: while in these days their enervated posterity sleep away their rapid journies in easy chaises, fitted for the conveyance of the soft inhabitants of <HI>Sybaris.</HI></P>
<P>I CONTINUED my way to <HI>Coventry</HI> through <HI>Allesey,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ALLESEY.</NOTE> a village with a church and spire-steeple. The place was originally a member of that city, Bishop <HI>Clinton</HI> having permitted a chapel to be built here for the use of the poor, reserving the right of burial to the mother church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale,</HI> i. 129.</NOTE>. In a place called <HI>The Parks,</HI> stood a castle, doubly moated, probably the residence of the <HI>Hastings,</HI> who possessed this place in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> I. The present hand∣some seat is owned by — <HI>Neale,</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P>AFTER a ride of two miles from hence, <NOTE PLACE="marg">COVENTRY.</NOTE> I entered <HI>Coventry,</HI> a great and antient city. The time of its foundation is unknown. By the addition of <HI>tre,</HI> a town, it should seem as if it had been inhabited by the <HI>Britons,</HI> before the <HI>Saxons</HI> added the word <HI>coven</HI> to it, as is conjectured, from a nunnery very antiently established here. The site of the old town is supposed to have been on the north side of the present, not only because great foundations are discovered about the spot called St. <HI>Nicholas Church-yard,</HI> but, I may add, from the <HI>tumulus</HI> near it, on the <HI>Atherston</HI> road, called <HI>Barrs Hill,</HI> on which might have been a castelet.</P>
<P>THE certainty of there having been a convent here in the early times, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SAXON NUNNERY.</NOTE> depends on the authority of <HI>John Rous</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland</HI> (iv. 124.) says it was founded by king <HI>Canute.</HI></NOTE> who says, that
<PB N="139" REF="156"/>
when the traitor <HI>Edric</HI> ravaged this country, in 1016, he burnt the nunnery in this city, of which a holy virgin, St. <HI>Osburg,</HI> had been abbess.</P>
<P>ON its ruins, <HI>Leofric,</HI> fifth earl of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and his countess <HI>Godeva,</HI> founded a monastery. At that period <HI>Coventry</HI> must have been a considerable place, and its number of inhabitants great, otherwise the fair <HI>Godeva</HI> could never have made so great a merit of riding naked through the town, <NOTE PLACE="marg">STORY OF GODEVA.</NOTE> to redeem it from the intole∣rable taxes and grievances it at that time labored under. The cause must have been equal to the deed. Her husband long resisted her importunity in its behalf, on account of the profits that accrued to him: at length thought to silence her by the strange propo∣sal: she accepted it, and, being happy in fine flowing locks, rode, decently covered to her very feet with her lovely tresses. The history was preserved in a picture, about the time of <HI>Richard</HI> II. in which were portrayed the earl and countess. He holds a charter of freedom in his hand, and thus addresses his lady:
<Q><L>I <HI>Luriche (Leofric)</HI> for love of thee,</L>
<L>Doe make <HI>Coventre</HI> toll-free.</L></Q></P>
<P>Legend says, that previous to her ride, all the inhabitants were ordered, on pain of death, to shut themselves up during the time; but that the curiosity of a certain taylor, overcoming fear, took a single peep; which is commemorated even at present, by a figure looking out of a wall in the great street. To this day, the love of <HI>Godeva</HI> to the city is annually remembered, by a proces∣sion; and a valiant <HI>fair</HI> still rides (not literally like the good countess) but in silk, closely fitted to her limbs, and of color emulating their complexion.</P>

AFTER the Conquest, <NOTE PLACE="marg">NORMAN OWNERS.</NOTE> the lordship of this city fell, by the mar∣riage of <HI>Lucia</HI> (daughter to <HI>Algar,</HI> successor and son of <HI>Edwin,</HI> and grandson of <HI>Leofric</HI>) with her third husband <HI>Randle Meschine,</HI> to the earls of <HI>Chester</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leicester,</HI> 127. <HI>Cambden,</HI> i. 611.</NOTE>. <HI>Randle</HI> bestowed on it the same privileges that <HI>Linsda</HI> enjoyed, and bestowed great part of the city on the monks. When <HI>Henry</HI> III. took the earldom of <HI>Chester</HI> into his hands, the remainder of <HI>Coventry</HI> fell to <HI>William de Albany</HI> earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> in right of his wife <HI>Mabil,</HI> daughter of <HI>Hugh Cevelio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> On the death of <HI>Hugh</HI> earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> in 1243, it fell to <HI>Roger de Montalto,</HI> who had married <HI>Cecilia,</HI> his youngest sister. After that, it was granted by his grandson <HI>Robert,</HI> in default of issue, to <HI>Isabel,</HI> queen mother of <HI>Edward</HI> III. with remainder to <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Eltham,</HI> afterwards earl of <HI>Cornwall;</HI> and then to <HI>Edward</HI> king of <HI>England.</HI> It thus became annexed to the earldom of <HI>Cornwall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">INCORPORATED.</NOTE> and became more immediately the object of royal favor. <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> III. in the eighteenth of his reign, by letters dated the 20th of <HI>January,</HI> made it a corporation, consisting of a mayor and two bailiffs, whom the inhabitants were to chuse out of themselves. The first mayor was <HI>John Ward,</HI> who was chosen in the year 1348.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> VI. in 1451, bestowed on this city a very particular mark of his affection, by erecting it, with a considerable district around,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MADE A COUNTY.</NOTE> into a county<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Accurately laid down in Mr. <HI>Beighton</HI>'s map of <HI>Warwickshire.</HI></NOTE>, by the name of the city and county of <HI>Coventry;</HI> and ordered that the bailiffs from that time should be sheriffs: so that at present, it is governed by a mayor, recorder, two sheriffs, ten aldermen, thirty-one superior and twenty-five inferior common-council-men.
<PB N="141" REF="158"/>
<HI>Henry</HI> came expressly to <HI>Coventry,</HI> heard mass in St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s church, presented the church with a gown of cloth of gold, and then created the first sheriffs.</P>
<P>THE representatives are chosen by the citizens paying scot and lot, and are returned by the sheriffs. The city sent members the four first parlements of <HI>Edward</HI> I. That privilege was interrupt∣ed (except the eighth of <HI>Edward</HI> II. and twentieth and twenty-fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> III.) till the thirty-first of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. when it was resumed.</P>
<P>AMONG all its privileges, unfortunately for the magistrates, it has that of life and death.</P>
<P>Two parlements have been held in this city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PARLEMENTS HELD HERE.</NOTE> in the great cham∣ber of the priory. The first, in 1404, by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. which was stiled <HI>Parliamentum indoctorum;</HI> not that it consisted of a greater number of blockheads than parlements ordinarily do, but from its inveteracy against the clergy, whose revenues it was determined not to spare: whence it was also called the <HI>Laymen's Parle∣ment.</HI></P>
<P>THE other was held in the chapter-house of the priory, in 1459, by <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and was called <HI>Parliamentum diabolicum,</HI> by reason of the multitude of attainders passed against <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and his adherents.</P>
<P>THE trade of this city was originally the manufacture of cloth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">TRADE, CLOTH.</NOTE> and caps, or bonnets <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anderson's Dict.</HI> i. 262.</NOTE>, which arose to a great degree of conse∣quence, as early as 1436, and continued till the last century, when it was changed for the worsted business; and, for a long time, the making and sale of shags, camblets, lastings, tammies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="159"/>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> proved a very extensive and profitable trade; but this gra∣dually migrated into <HI>Leicestershire</HI> and <HI>Northamptonshire;</HI> and at present, only a few articles, such as camblets and lastings, con∣stitute the woollen trade.</P>
<P>I MUST remark, that in the beginning, or middle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BLUE THREAD.</NOTE> of the six∣teenth century, <HI>Coventry</HI> had a vast manufacture of blue thread; which was lost before the year 1581 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anderson's Dict.</HI> i 422.</NOTE>. So famous was it for its dye, that <HI>true as Coventry blue</HI> became proverbial.</P>
<P>ABOUT eighty years ago, <NOTE PLACE="marg">RIBANDS.</NOTE> the silk manufacture of ribands was introduced here, and, for the first thirty years, remained in the hands of a few people, who acquired vast fortunes; since which, it has extended to a great degree, and is supposed to employ at left ten thousand people; and has likewise spread into the neighboring towns, such as <HI>Nuneaton,</HI> and other places. Such real good results from our little vanities!</P>
<P>THERE are about a dozen traders in <HI>Coventry,</HI> who have houses in <HI>London;</HI> to which they send up weekly great quantities of ri∣bands; and, before our unhappy breach with <HI>America,</HI> a very ex∣tensive trade was carried on with the colonies: but the home-consumption has been always reckoned most material. A few ribands are exported to <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Russia;</HI> but the <HI>French</HI> undersell us at those markets.</P>
<P>WITHIN these few years, four or five houses have begun to in∣troduce the making of gauzes; and for that purpose chiefly, em∣ploy hands from <HI>Scotland.</HI> This branch is at present in its in∣fancy. Another of broad silks was likewise set up, which, I am sorry to find, does not go on with the expected success.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="160"/>
THE military transactions of this city are very few. It was an open town for many centuries, and, of course, incapable of sus∣taining a siege. The walls were not begun till the year 1355, <NOTE PLACE="marg">WALLS.</NOTE> and then by virtue of a licence granted by <HI>Edward</HI> III. twenty-seven years before; nor were they finished in less than forty. They were built by money raised by taxes, and by customs on the wine, malt, oxen, hogs, calves, and sheep, consumed in <HI>Co∣ventry.</HI> These walls were of great strength and grandeur, fur∣nished with thirty-two towers and twelve gates. These continued till the 22d of <HI>July</HI> 1661, when great part of the wall, and most of the towers, and many of the gates, were pulled down, with certain circumstances of disgrace, as a punishment for the disloy∣alty of the inhabitants, in shutting their gates against their mo∣narch <HI>Charles</HI> I. on the 13th of <HI>August</HI> 1642. His majesty, after setting up his standard at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> had sent to this city, to acquaint them that he meant to reside there for some time, and desired quarters for his forces in and about the place. The mayor and aldermen, with many expressions of affection, offered to receive the king, but refused admittance to any of the soldiery. Incensed at this, his majesty attacked the city, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY ATTACKED BY CHARLES I.</NOTE> and with his ord∣nance forced open one of the gates; but was repulsed by the valour of the citizens, and obliged to retire with loss <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vicar's Parliament, Chron.</HI> 141.</NOTE>. In the following month <HI>Coventry</HI> was regularly garrisoned by the parle∣ment <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitelock,</HI> 63.</NOTE>, and remained in its possession during the whole war.</P>
<P>I SHOULD have mentioned before, that in the fifteenth century another monarch had been denied the possession of this city. The great Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> armed it against <HI>Edward</HI> IV. in 1470,
<PB N="144" REF="161"/>
when he attempted entering on the side of <HI>Gosford Green.</HI> The king amply repaid the insult on the citizens, who perhaps acted by constraint. He deprived them of their privileges, and made them pay five hundred marks for the recovering of them, by having the sword restored to them.</P>
<P>BEFORE the building of the walls, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> there had been, from very early times, a castle on the south side of the town, near <HI>Chyles∣more,</HI> with a park belonging to it. This had been the residence of the kings and earls of <HI>Mercia:</HI> it afterwards fell to the earls of <HI>Chester,</HI> and at length was vested in the royal line. No vestige of it is now to be seen: in its place is a very antient wooden building, the remains of the manor-house of <HI>Chylesmore,</HI> probably built after the demolition of the castle.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Stephen</HI> forcibly took this fortress from <HI>Randle de Gernons</HI> earl of <HI>Chester.</HI> The earl, in 1146, attempted to reduce it, not by siege, but by erecting a fort near it, in order to distress the gar∣rison, by cutting off supplies. The king twice attempted its re∣lief; the first time without success, but in the second action he defeated the earl; forced him to fly, covered with wounds; <NOTE PLACE="marg">DEMOLISHED.</NOTE> and then demolished the castle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leicester's Cheshire ex gestis Stephani,</HI> 124.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I SHALL take notice of the ecclesiastical history, churches, re∣mains of religious houses, and the public buildings, in the course of my walk about the city, in which I was accompanied by the Reverend Doctor <HI>Edwards;</HI> whose hospitality and politeness I have more than once had occasion to experience.</P>
<P><HI>Coventry</HI> is seated on ground gently sloping on most sides: <NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY DESCRIBED.</NOTE> its length, from <HI>Hillstreet-gate</HI> to <HI>Gosford-gate,</HI> is about three quarters
<PB N="145" REF="162"/>
of a mile, exclusive of the suburbs. The streets in general are narrow, and composed of very antient buildings, the stories of which, in some, impend one over the other in such a manner, as nearly to meet at top, and exclude the sight of the sky. By the appearance of the whole, it is very evident that it never under∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent the calamity of fire; which, deprecated as it ought to be, is usually the cause of future improvement.</P>
<P>THE number of inhabitants, taken at different periods, <NOTE PLACE="marg">NUMBERS.</NOTE> in the last two hundred years, is very different. Before 1549, they were found to have been 15,000; but on that violent convulsion, the Dissolution, trade grew so low, and occasioned such a dispersion of people from this city, as to reduce them to 3,000. To re∣medy this evil, <HI>Edward</HI> VI. granted the city a charter for an ad∣ditional fair. To this cause perhaps was owing the increase, by the year 1586, to 6502. In 1644, when the inhabitants were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umbered, from the apprehension of a siege, they were found to amount to 9,500 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dagdale,</HI> i. 146, 150, 152.</NOTE>. By <HI>Bradford</HI>'s <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Published by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in 1750.</NOTE> <HI>Survey of Coventry,</HI> made in 1748 and 1749, there appears to have been 2,065 houses, and 1211, people. The accounts at present vary from 20,000 to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0,000; but, from my enquiries, the middle sum between both may come nearest the truth.</P>
<P>THE city is watered by the <HI>Radford</HI> and the <HI>Sherborn</HI> brooks, which, from N. and S. meet within the walls, and, after a short <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, bound the north-eastern parts without the walls.</P>
<P>WE began our progress from the <HI>Chester</HI> road, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SPONNE HOSPI∣TAL, FOR LEPERS.</NOTE> on the western side of the city, at the reliques of <HI>Sponne</HI> hospital, consisting of the chapel and gateway. It was founded for the lepers which
<PB N="146" REF="163"/>
happened to be in <HI>Coventry,</HI> by <HI>Hugh Ceveilioc</HI> earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> out of affection to <HI>William de Auney,</HI> a knight of his houshold, afflicted with the leprosy. Here was also a priest, to pray both for the living and the dead; also certain brethren and sisters, to pray, with the lepers, for the good estate of all their benefactors. This hospital is said once to have belonged to the abbey of <HI>Basing∣werk,</HI> in <HI>Flintshire;</HI> but at length was appropriated to the monk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Coventry,</HI> from whom it passed to the crown, in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> IV; who gave it to the canons of <HI>Studley,</HI> in order to obtain their prayers for him, and all his connections.</P>
<P>THAT loathsome disorder, which gave rise to this, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> APPEARANCE IN ENGLAND.</NOTE> and number<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of other similar foundations, was introduced into <HI>England</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> I. and was supposed to have been brought out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> or perhaps the east, by means of the crusades. To add to the horror, it was contagious; which enhanced the charity of a provision for such miserables, who were not only naturally shunned, but even chaced by royal edict, from the society of their fellow-creatures <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Edward</HI> III. drove from <HI>London</HI> all the lepers, except fourteen, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dmittance into St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s hospital.</NOTE>.

waggons, loaden beyond the height of arches erected when war was our chief trade.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY within the walls, on the left, stands the church of St. <HI>John,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH OF ST. JOHN.</NOTE> a very handsome building, with a neat but not lofty tower, placed in the centre: the inside is in form of a cross, in∣tersected by a short transept: the windows high, and form a long range, with very narrow divisions. This church was originally a chapel to the merchants gild, the most antient in <HI>Coventry,</HI> licensed by <HI>Edward</HI> III. in 1340, for a fraternity of brethren and sisters, with a warden, or master, to be elected out of the body; who might make chauntries, bestow alms, and do other works of piety; constitute ordinances, and purchase lands to the value of £20 a year, within the liberty of the city, for the founding of a chauntry of six priests, to sing mass every day in the churches of the holy <HI>Trinity</HI> and St. <HI>Michael,</HI> for the soul of king <HI>Edward,</HI> queen <HI>Philippa,</HI> their children, and for the souls of the gild, and others. Soon after, <HI>Isabel,</HI> queen-mother, assigned the land on this spot, then called <HI>Bablake,</HI> for the building a chapel, in which masses were to be sung daily for the same purposes; which was finished and dedicated in 1350. At length, in 1399, licence was given for celebrating divine service here, provided it might be done without injury to the mother-church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugd. W.</HI> i. 188.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the dissolution, its revenues were found to be £111. 13<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> and that they supported a warden and eight priests, who had chambers in the precinct; a master of a grammar-school, two singing-clerks, and two singing-boys, and several poor men, who had been brethren of the gild. The church has of late years
<PB N="148" REF="166"/>
been rebuilt; made a rectory by act of parlement, in 1734, and settled on the master of the free-school of <HI>Coventry</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ecton,</HI> 93.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BEHIND this church is <HI>Bablake</HI> hospital, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BABLAKE HOSPITAL.</NOTE> an old building, with a court in the middle: one part is occupied by <HI>Bond</HI>'s alms-houses, founded in 1506, by <HI>Thomas Bond,</HI> mayor of <HI>Coventry</HI> in 1497, for ten poor men and one poor woman, with a priest to pray for the soul of the founder, his grandfather, father, and all Christian souls. At that time the revenues were £49. 11<HI>s.</HI> 7<HI>d.</HI> In the first of <HI>Edward</HI> VIth's time, they were vested in the city; and, the revenues being improved, at present they maintain eighteen old men and a nurse, each of whom have three shillings a week, a black gown, and other emoluments <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugd. W.</HI> i. 193.</NOTE>. About the year 1619, an infernal ambition of becoming chief of the house, seized one of the alms-men; who, to attain his end, poisoned eight of his bre∣thren; five of whom instantly died. On detection, the wretch effected his own destruction by the same method, and was buried with the usual marks of infamy. Had his fortune flung him into a higher station, his deeds would have paralleled him with <HI>Cesar Borgia,</HI> or his more monstrous father, Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VI.</P>
<P>THE other part of the building is allotted for the blue boys: a foundation owing to a very singular accident. Mr. <HI>Thomas Wheatly,</HI> mayor of <HI>Coventry</HI> in 1556, and ironmonger and card∣maker by trade, sent his servant, <HI>Oughton,</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> to buy some barrels of steel gads; which he thought he did, in open fair. When they were brought home and examined, they were found to contain cochineal and ingots of silver. Mr. <HI>Wheatly</HI> kept them for a considerable time, in hopes of discovering the owner;
<PB N="149" REF="167"/>
for his servant did not know from whom he bought them. At length he applied the profits, as well as much of his own estate, for the support of poor children.</P>
<P>FROM thence my walk was continued along the west side of the city, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CANAL.</NOTE> to <HI>Bishopgate-street.</HI> A little without is the head of the great canal, which, passing by the neighboring collieries at <HI>Hawkesbury,</HI> is to extend to <HI>Brinklow, Hill-Morton, Branston</HI> in <HI>Northampton∣shire,</HI> return into <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> and, after passing by <HI>Banbury,</HI> con∣clude at <HI>Oxford</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Distances. <HI>Coventry</HI> to <HI>Hill Morton,</HI> 20 1 0. <HI>Napton Napton Field,</HI> 17 1 5, rise 88. f. <HI>Claydon,</HI> — 8 5 1 <HI>Oxford,</HI> — 36 0 7, fall 204.</NOTE>.

<P>AT the lower end of this street is the free-school: it sprung out of an hospital, <NOTE PLACE="marg">FREE SCHOOL.</NOTE> founded in the beginning of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. by <HI>Laurence,</HI> prior of <HI>Coventry,</HI> and his convent, at the request of <HI>Edmund,</HI> archdeacon of <HI>Coventry,</HI> for the reception of the sick and needy. At the dissolution, <HI>John Hales,</HI> a gentleman
<PB N="150" REF="168"/>
who had large share in the plunder of the church, and having neither wife or child, converted this foundation, which he had purchased at a very cheap rate, into a free school, and endowed it with CC marks a year in land. At first, the boys were in∣structed in the church of the <HI>White Friers;</HI> but the magistrates finding that Mr. <HI>Hales</HI> had bought the lands but not the church, took advantage of the flaw, and removed the scholars to the pre∣sent place, and pulled down the church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugd.

<P>PASS by <HI>Cookstreet Gate,</HI> on the outside of the city, and a little further, by the <HI>Three Virgins,</HI> or <HI>Priory Gate,</HI> between which there is a complete part of the wall. On the outside was a paved road, in imitation of the military way from turret to turret on the famed wall of <HI>Severus:</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour Scotl.</HI> vol. iii. 288.</NOTE> and besides, here were four others, which went a mile each way from the city.</P>
<P>AT a small distance without the <HI>Priory Gate,</HI> is <HI>Swanswell Pool,</HI> which supplies the city with water. This did belong to the priory, but was at the dissolution purchased by the corporation from the crown <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugd. W.</HI> i. 146.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM hence I returned to the priory, <NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIORY.</NOTE> seated on the south side of the brook <HI>Sherburn.</HI> What bears that name is an uninhabited house, of much later date than that monastery; but built on some part of the site of this great foundation.</P>
<P>ABOUT the year 1043, earl <HI>Leofric</HI> and his fair countess more than repaired the loss in 1016, in the destruction of the famous
<PB N="151" REF="169"/>
<HI>Saxon</HI> nunnery, by founding in its stead a magnificent monastery. They placed here an abbot, and twenty-four monks of the <HI>Bene∣dictine</HI> order; enriched the very walls and the church with massy gold and silver, and endowed it with half the town and twenty-four manors. All this they did with the advice of king <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor and the reigning pope, and dedicated the church to the honor of God and his blessed mother, St. <HI>Peter,</HI> St. <HI>Osburg,</HI> and all saints. The pious founders were buried, according to the custom of the times, in the porches; for the distasteful custom of church interment did not prevale till long after.</P>
<P>THE first abbot was <HI>Leofrin;</HI> but that dignity was of short du∣ration, for, on the removal of the see of <HI>Lichfield</HI> to this place, in 1095, by <HI>Robert de Limisie,</HI> the office was suppressed, the bishop being in such cases always esteemed supreme of the house <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis's Abbeys,</HI> i. 70.</NOTE> in his stead; a prior was appointed, but without derogating from the honor of the house; for the priors were barons in parlement as well as the preceding abbots, and the place a mitred abbey. This first prelate was more attracted by the wealth of the house than by any spiritual call; for he at once scraped from a single beam five hundred marks worth of silver, in order to carry on the intrigue at <HI>Rome</HI> against the poor monks. He reduced them to such short commons, that he depressed their spirits, discouraged all sorts of knowlege among them, and, in short, rendered them too dejected to think of obtaining any redress.</P>
<P>THIS was a prelude to greater misfortunes. In the latter end of the following century, <HI>Hugh Novani,</HI> a <HI>Norman,</HI> became bishop. He soon fell at variance with the monks; who, in a synod held
<PB N="152" REF="170"/>
before the high altar, doubtless on some high provocation, broke his head with the holy cross.
<Q>Tantaene animis caelestibus irae!</Q></P>
<P>This enraged the proud prelate (as he was called by those meek monks) to lay his complaint against them at <HI>Rome.</HI> The pope attended to it, expelled the antient inhabitants, and placed in their room a set of secular canons. The monks, now driven into the wild world, had only the satisfaction of seeing their per∣secutor struck with deep remorse; for, in 1198, lying on his death-bed, in the abbey of <HI>Bec,</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> he was seized with fierce horrors at his conduct towards those holy men; implored forgiveness, and desired their intercession with the Almighty in his behalf. He requested to be buried in the habit of the order, that he might receive the benefit of its protection in the other world, and finally consigned himself to purgatory, <HI>ibi in diem ju∣dicii cruciandus.</HI></P>
<P>LUCKILY at the time of this event, <HI>Thomas,</HI> a monk of <HI>Coven∣try,</HI> happened to be at <HI>Rome</HI> soliciting the cause of his brethren: he so enraged <HI>Innocent</HI> III. (then pope) by his importunities, as to order him to withdraw. The poor monk, with tears, replied, <Q>Another pope will come, to whom I shall not sue in vain. I therefore will patiently wait your death, as I have that of your two predecessors.</Q> "Here is a devil of a fellow" (says his Ho∣liness, in high wrath, to his attendants) <Q>by St. <HI>Peter!</HI> He shall not wait for my death; so I will not put him off any longer, but make out the purpose of his petition before I put a morsel more into my mouth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale W.</HI> i. 161.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="171"/>
THIS troublesome affair ended, they were replaced with double advantage; their privileges, as if by way of atonement for their short sufferings, increased beyond all reason; for in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> III. they obtained, that they and their tenants, except those who held by knight service more than half a knight's see, should be quit of murder, robbery, suit to the county or hundred courts, aid to the sheriffs, view of frankpledge, and repair of the king's castles or pools <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale,</HI> i. 161.</NOTE>. Reign after reign they received fresh emoluments; so that in the end it became possessed of re∣venues to the amount of £731. 19<HI>s.</HI> 5<HI>d.</HI> or, after reprises, £499. 7<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 567.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMONG the sacred furniture was an image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> adorned with a chain of gold enriched with gems, bestowed by the Countess <HI>Godeva</HI> on her death-bed: to which the devotees were to say as many prayers as there were in it precious stones.</P>
<P>AND besides this, an arm of St. <HI>Augustine</HI> of <HI>Hippo,</HI> which <HI>Agelnethus,</HI> archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in 1020, bought at <HI>Rome</HI> from the pope, for the small sum of C talents of silver, and one of gold <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale W.</HI> i. 158. <HI>Goodwin,</HI> 78.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT even this arm had not power to ward off the blow given by the more irresistible one of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII; who, not content with the expulsion of its inhabitants, and seizure of the revenues, di∣rected this noble pile to be levelled with the ground; which he did, notwithstanding the earnest prayers of its bishop, <HI>Rowland Lee,</HI> one of his most servile tools. A deed equally wanton and impious!</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="172"/>
THE loss is the more to be regretted, as this cathedral is sup∣posed to have been built on the model of that of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> and equally beautiful. Nothing remains except a fragment, consti∣tuting part of a private house, to be seen with difficulty, and after some search. The palace stood between the priory and Saint <HI>Michael</HI>'s, and was sold in 1651, for its materials, to <HI>Nathaniel Lacy</HI> and <HI>Obadiah Chambers,</HI> for the sum of an hundred guineas. The last prior, <HI>Thomas Camsel,</HI> in 1538, was prevaled on to make a surrender of the house, either through fear of death, for with∣standing the tyrant's pleasure, or through lucre of pension; for he had not less than £133. 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> annuity, besides other al∣lowances to the monks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stevens,</HI> i. 223. <HI>Willis's Abbeys,</HI> i. 72.</NOTE>. The site was then granted to <HI>John Combes</HI> and <HI>Richard Stansfield,</HI> after flourishing under monastic government above five hundred years.</P>
<P>WHEN the cathedral was standing, <HI>Coventry</HI> possessed a match∣less group of churches, all standing within one coemetery.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. MICHAEL'S CHURCH.</NOTE> Saint <HI>Michael</HI>'s at present is a specimen of the most beautiful steeple in <HI>Europe:</HI> a tower enriched with faintly figures on the sides; an octagon rising out of it, and that lengthened into a most elegant spire. Every part is so finely proportionable, that it is no wonder that Sir <HI>Christopher Wren</HI> spoke of it as a master∣piece of architecture. The outside is extremely handsome; the inside light and lofty, consisting of a body and two ailes, divided by four rows of high and airy pillars and arches. The height of the steeple and length of the church are the same, three hundred and three feet; the width of the latter an hundred and four.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="173"/>
IN king <HI>Stephen</HI>'s time, this church was a chapel to the monks; became afterwards a vicarage, and on the dissolution fell to the gift of the crown. This, <HI>Trinity,</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI>'s, form the pa∣rishes of this great city; so numerous are the dissenters.</P>
<P>ITS beautiful steeple was begun in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. in 1372, by two brothers, <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>William Bota,</HI> at their own charges, which amounted annually to one hundred pounds; nor was it finished in less than twenty years. By the stile of architecture, I agree with Sir <HI>William Dugdale,</HI> that the present body was built in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. Some ornament was also added to the steeple at the same time. <HI>Coventry</HI> seems to have been particu∣larly favored by <HI>Henry,</HI> or, to speak more properly of that meek prince, by the heroine <HI>Margaret;</HI> for this city used to be stiled the secret harbour of that queen.</P>
<P>TRINITY church, and its spire, would be spoken of as a most beautiful building, was it not eclipsed by its unfortunate vicinity to St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s. Within are two epitaphs, which I give for their singularity. One is on <HI>Philemon Holland,</HI> the famous translator. He was school-master and physician in the city. A wag made this distich on one of his labors:
<Q><L>Philemon with translations doth so fill us,</L>
<L>He will not let <HI>Suetonius</HI> be <HI>Tranquillus.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>HE was called translator-general of his age; acquired much credit by his fidelity, but none greater than by his translation of <HI>Cambden,</HI> in that great antiquarian's life-time, and by his consent; to whose work he made considerable additions.</P>
<P>HE wrote a great folio with one pen, and, as he tells us, did not wear it out.

<P>AT length (if I may be allowed to pun with <HI>Fuller</HI>) death translated this translator to the other world, in 1636, at the good old age of eighty-five; leaving behind this epitaph of his own composition.</P>

<P>ON leaving of these churches, I surveyed with indignation, such as antiquaries experience, the site of the elegant and antient cross, till of late years such an ornament to the city. <NOTE PLACE="marg">CROSS.</NOTE> I am not furnished with an apology for the corporation who destroyed this beautiful building; so must leave it doubtful, whether the gothic resolution was the result of want of money, or want of taste.

<P>IT was built, or rather begun, in 1541, to replace another

cross, taken down some years before. The founder was Sir <HI>Wil∣liam Hollies,</HI> lord mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and son of <HI>Thomas Hollies</HI> of <HI>Stoke,</HI> near this city, who left by his will two hundred pounds towards the design. The base was hexangular, finely ornamented with gothic sculpture; above, rose three stories of most light and elegant tabernacle-work, lessening to the summit. In the niches were saints and <HI>English</HI> monarchs, from <HI>Henry</HI> II. to <HI>Henry</HI> V. and around each story variety of pretty figures with flags, with the arms of <HI>England</HI> or the rose of <HI>Lancaster</HI> expressed on them: and on the summit of the uppermost plate Justice, and other gracious attributes.</P>
<P>A LITTLE south of St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s, <NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. MARY HALL.</NOTE> stands St. <HI>Mary Hall,</HI> at pre∣sent used for corporation-assemblies. This place was built in the beginning of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI: a venerable pile, whose en∣trance is beneath a large gateway, over which are the figures of a king and queen sitting; probably <HI>Henry</HI> and his consort <HI>Mar∣garet.</HI> Within this building is a fine old room: in the upper end is a noble semicircular window, divided into nine parts, ele∣gantly painted with figures of several of our monarchs, with coats of arms and ornaments, but now very imperfect: those in the win∣dows on the one side are lost; several of those on the other are entire, and were designed to represent some of our great nobility, who had honored this hall with their presence as brothers and sisters of the gild, for whose use this hall was founded. This had been the gild of St. <HI>Katherine,</HI> established by certain citi∣zens of <HI>Coventry,</HI> in 1343, by licence of <HI>Edward</HI> III; after which it was united to those of the <HI>Holy Trinity, Our Lady,</HI> and Saint <HI>John the Baptist.</HI></P>

FROM hence we proceeded to the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> or <HI>White Friars;</HI> whose house stands at the east end of the city: another order de∣voted to poverty, who lived on charity both from the living and the dead; for they often received legacies, supposed expiations for sins.

<P>HERE are considerable remains of the building: part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed cloisters; the refectory and dormitory, and vast vaulted room, which served as magazines for provisions.

<P>IN the course of my walk a chamber was shewn me, in <HI>Gosford-street,</HI> noted for the melancholy end of <HI>Mary Clues,</HI> in <HI>February</HI> 1772, who was found almost consumed by fire, occasioned by an accident of a most uncommon nature. She had been confined to her bed by illness, the consequence of intemperance. The room was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ored with brick; the bed furnished with only one curtain, and that was next to the window. The fire-place was on the other side. She was left, the evening before the accident, with two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall bits of coal put quite back in the grate, and a rush-light on the chair, by the head of the bed.

smoke was perceived in the room. On bursting open the door <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> flames appeared, which were easily extinguished. The re∣mains of the woman lay on the floor, but the furniture of the room was only slightly damaged; the bedstead superficially burnt but neither sheets, feather-bed, nor blankets destroyed.</P>
<P>THE solution of this phaenomenon is rather ridiculous. Mrs. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was excessively addicted to dram-drinking: she would drink a quart in a day, either of rum or anise-seed water; and by that means, filling her veins with pure spirits, became as inflam∣mable as a lamp.

<Q>At the time appointed, the king came to <HI>Coventrie,</HI> where the two dukes were readie, according to the order prescribed therein; comming thither in great arraie, accompanied with the lords and gentlemen of their linages. The king caused a sumptuous scaffold, or theater, and roial listes there to be erected and prepared. The <HI>Sundaie</HI> before they should fight, after dinner, the duke of <HI>Hereford</HI> came to the king (being lodged about a quarter of a mile without the town, in a tower that belonged to Sir <HI>William Bagot</HI>) to take his leave of him. The morrow after, being the daie appointed for the combat, about the spring of the daie came the duke of <HI>Norfolke</HI> to the court, to take leave likewise of the king. The duke of <HI>Here∣ford</HI> armed him in his tent, that was set up neere to the lists; and the duke of <HI>Norfolke</HI> put on his armor betwixt the gate and the barrier of the town, in a beautiful house, having a fair perclois of wood towards the gate, that none might see what was done within the house.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The duke of <HI>Aumarle</HI> that daie being high constable of <HI>England,</HI> and the duke of <HI>Surrie</HI> marshal, placed themselves betwixt them, well armed and appointed. And when they saw their time, they first entered into the lists with a great company of men, apparelled in silke sendal, imbrodered with silver both richlie and curiouslie; everie man having a tipped staff, to keep the field in order. About the houre of prime came to the barriers of the lists the duke of <HI>Hereford,</HI> mounted on a white courser, barded with green and blew velvet, imbroi∣dered sumptuously with swans and antelopes of goldsmiths worke, armed at all points. The constable and marshal came to the barriers, demanding of him what he was? he answered,
<PB N="170" REF="190"/>
'I am <HI>Henrie</HI> of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> duke of <HI>Hereford:</HI> which am come hither to do mine indevor against <HI>Thomas Mowbraie</HI> duke of <HI>Norfolke,</HI> as a traitor untrue to God, the king, his realme, and me.'—Then incontinentlie he sware upon the holie Evangelists, that his quarrel was true &amp; just; and upon that point he re∣quired to enter the lists. Then he puts up his sword, which before he held up naked in his hand, and, putting down his visor, made a cross on his horsse, and with speare in hand entered into the lists, and descended from his horsse, and set him down in a chaire of green velvet, at the one end of the lists, and there reposed himself, abiding the comming of his adversarie.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Soone after him entered into the field, with great triumph, King <HI>Richard,</HI> accompanied with all the peerses of the realme; and in his companie was the earle of <HI>Saint Paule,</HI> which was come out of <HI>France,</HI> in post, to see this challenge performed. The king had there above ten thousand men in armour, least some fraie or tumult might rise amongst his nobles, by quar∣relling or partaking. When the king was set in his seat, which was richly hanged and adorned, a king at arms made open proclamation, prohibiting all men, in the name of the king, and of the high constable and marshal, to enterprise or attempt to approach, or touch any part of the lists, upon pain of death, except such as were appointed to order or marshal the field. The proclamation ended, another herald cried, 'Behold here <HI>Henrie</HI> of <HI>Lancaster</HI> duke of <HI>Hereford,</HI> appelant, which is entered into the lists roiall, to do his devoir against <HI>Thomas Mowbraie</HI> duke of <HI>Norfolke,</HI> defendant, upon paine to be found false &amp; recreant.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="191"/>
<Q>The duke of <HI>Norfolke</HI> hovered on horsseback at the entrie of the lists, his horsse being barded with crimson velvet, imbro∣dered richlie with lions of silver and mulberie trees; and when he had made his oth before the constable and marshal, that his quarrel was just &amp; true, he entered the field manfullie, saieng aloud, 'God, and him that hath the right;' and then he departed from his horsse, &amp; sate him downe in his chaire, which was of crimson velvet, courtined about with white and red damaske. The lord marshall viewed their spears, to see that they were of equall length, and delivered the one speare himself to the Duke of <HI>Hereford,</HI> and sent the other unto the Duke of <HI>Norfolke</HI> by a knight; then the herald proclamed, that the traverses &amp; chaires of the champions should be removed, commanding them, on the king's behalf, to mount on horssebacke, and address themselves to the battel and combat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Holinshed's Chr.</HI> 494.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The duke of <HI>Hereford</HI> was quicklie horssed, and closed his bauier, and cast his speare into the rest; and when the trum∣pet founded, set forward couragiouslie towards his enemie six or seven pases. The duke of <HI>Norfolke</HI> was not fullie set for∣ward, when the king cast downe his warder, and the heralds cried 'Ho, ho.' Then the king caused their speares to be taken from them, and commanded them to repaire againe to their chaires; where they remained two long houres, while the king and his councell deliberatlie consulted what order was best to be had in so weightie a cause. Finallie: after they had devised, and fullie determined what should be done therein,
<PB N="172" REF="192"/>
the heralds cried 'Silence;' and Sir <HI>John Bushie,</HI> the king's secretarie, read the sentence and determination of the king and his councell, in a long roll; the effect whereof was, that <HI>Henrie</HI> duke of <HI>Hereford</HI> should, within fifteene daies, depart out of the realme, and not to returne before the terme of ten yeares were expired, except by the king he should be repealed againe; and this upon paine of death: and that <HI>Thomas Mow∣braie</HI> duke of <HI>Norfolke,</HI> bicause he had sowen sedition in the relme by his words, should likewise avoid the realme, and ne∣ver returne againe into <HI>England,</HI> nor approch the borders or confines thereof, upon pain of death: and that the king would sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the profits of his lands, till he had levied thereof such summes of monie as the duke had taken up of the king's trea∣suror, for the wages of the garrison of <HI>Calis;</HI> which were still unpaid.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When these judgements were once read, the king called be∣fore him both parties, and made them to sweare that the one should never come in place where the other was, willinglie, nor keepe any companie togither in any forren region: which oth they both received humblie, and so went their waies. The duke of <HI>Norfolke</HI> departed sorrowfullie out of the realme into <HI>Almanie,</HI> and at the last came into <HI>Venice,</HI> where he, for thought and melancholie, deceassed; for he was in hope (as writers record) that he should have beene borne out in the matter by the king; which, when it fell out otherwise, it greeved him not a little. The duke of <HI>Hereford</HI> tooke his leave of the king at <HI>Eltham,</HI> who there released foure yeares of his banishment; so he tooke his jornie over into <HI>Calis,</HI> and from thence went into <HI>France,</HI> where he remained.</Q></P>

<Q>A woonder it was to see what number of people ran after him, in everie towne and street where he came, before he tooke the sea, lamenting and bewailing his departure; as who should saie, that when he departed, the onlie shield, defense, and comfort of the commonwealth was vaded and gone.</Q></P>
<P>ABOUT two miles from <HI>Coventry,</HI> I crossed the little river <HI>Sow</HI> at <HI>Binly</HI> bridge, a little beyond which stands the beautiful small church of the name, dedicated to St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BINLY CHURCH.</NOTE> formerly be∣longing to the monks of <HI>Coventry;</HI> now a curacy in the gift of Lord <HI>Craven,</HI> who rebuilt the church with uncommon elegance.

<P><HI>Combe Abbey,</HI> or, to spell it with propriety, <HI>Cwm,</HI> from its low situation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">COMBE ABBEY.</NOTE> lies about two miles farther. Notwithstanding its con∣version to the seat of a nobleman, it retains in part the form of its conventual state. The cloisters are preserved on three sides of the antient court, glazed as when occupied by the antient owners, and their walls enriched with the spoils of the chace. Methinks the jovial abbot is now before me, formed out of the monk so admirably described by old <HI>Chaucer.</HI>
<Q><L>A monk ther was, a fayre for the maistrie,</L>
<L>An out rider that loved venerie;</L>
<L>A manly man, to ben an abbot able;</L>
<L>Full many a deinte hors hadde he in stable.</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="194"/>
And when he rode, men mighte his bridel here,</L>
<L>Gingeling in a whistling wind as clere</L>
<L>And eke as loude as doth the chapell belle.</L>
<L>Ther as this lord was keper of the celle,</L>
<L>The rule of Seint <HI>Maure</HI> and of Seint <HI>Beneit,</HI></L>
<L>Because that it was olde &amp; somedele streit,</L>
<L>This ilke monk lette olde thinges pace,</L>
<L>And held after the newe world the trace.</L>
<L>He yave not of the text a pulled hen,</L>
<L>That saith that hunters ben not holy men;</L>
<L>Ne that a monk, when he is rekkeles,</L>
<L>Is like a fish that is waterles:</L>
<L>This is to say, a monk out of his cloistre,</L>
<L>This ilke text held he not worth an oistre.</L>
<L>And I say his opinion was good:</L>
<L>What shulde he studie, &amp; make himselven wood,</L>
<L>Upon a book in cloistre alway to pore,</L>
<L>Or swinken with his hondes, &amp; laboure</L>

<L>Let <HI>Austin</HI> have his swink to him reserved.</L>
<L>Therefore he was a prickasoure a right;</L>
<L>Greihounds he hadde as swift as soul of flight:</L>
<L>Of pricking, &amp; of hunting for the hare,</L>
<L>Was all his lust; for no cost wolde he spare.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE abbot is now represented by a jovial <HI>English</HI> baron, not less a lover of the generous exercise. He derives his right to the place from his ancestor Sir <HI>William Craven,</HI> Knight, great grand∣son of <HI>Henry Craven,</HI> elder brother to Sir <HI>William,</HI> lord mayor of <HI>London</HI> in 1610; one of the richest men of his time. It was purchased from that squanderer <HI>Lucy</HI> countess of <HI>Bedford,</HI> who in∣herited it from her brother Lord <HI>Harrington,</HI> who derived it from his mother <HI>Anne,</HI> daughter of <HI>Robert Kelway,</HI> who received
<PB N="175" REF="195"/>
it in lease after the forfeiture of <HI>John Dudley</HI> duke of <HI>Northumber∣land,</HI> to whom it had been granted by <HI>Edward</HI> VI. It had been founded by <HI>Richard de Camville,</HI> in 1150, and peopled with <HI>Cis∣tercian</HI> monks; <NOTE PLACE="marg">FOUNDER.</NOTE> who were at the dissolution found to be endowed with upwards of three hundred pounds a year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Robert Bates,</HI> alias <HI>Kymmer,</HI> was the last abbot; who, for his surrender, was re∣warded with a pension of eighty pounds a year <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis,</HI> ii, 241.</NOTE>, and his thirteen or fourteen religious with small pittances, as the merit of the deed rested in the former.</P>
<P>THAT accomplished nobleman Lord <HI>Harrington</HI> was the re∣founder of this house; which <HI>Cambden</HI> says arose from the ashes of the antient abbey. His taste is evident, in his preservation of the venerable cloisters. It is indebted to the owners of the pre∣sent name for its instructive furniture of portraits; probably en∣tirely to the hero <HI>William Craven,</HI> a most distinguished personage of this family.</P>
<P>IN the north parlour is a fine full-length of his great master in the art of war, <NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTRAITS.</NOTE> <HI>Gustavus Adolphus;</HI> under whose banners he de∣fended the Protestant cause in <HI>Germany,</HI> and, when very young, gained immortal honor at the desperate storming of the fortress of <HI>Creutenach,</HI> in the palatinate.</P>
<P>A FULL-LENGTH of <HI>James Stewart</HI> duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> in black, with long flowing flaxen hair, and a dog by him. This illustri∣ous nobleman forms one of the most amiable characters in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I. His attachment and affection to his royal re∣lation was unequalled: he is even said to have offered his own life, to save that of his devoted master <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Perichef,</HI> as quoted by Mr. <HI>Hume.</HI></NOTE>. He was permitted to
<PB N="176" REF="196"/>
attend the funeral of the beloved remains; then lingered away a few years, and died a victim to grief on <HI>March</HI> 30, 1655.</P>
<P><HI>Frederick</HI> V. elector palatine, a full-length, in robes, and with the unfortunate crown which he wore, as short-lived king of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> elected by the revolted state in 1619, when it attempted to shake off the yoke of the emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI> II. The battle of <HI>Prague,</HI> in the following year, deprived <HI>Frederick</HI> of his new kingdom and his hereditary dominions, and, from a potent prince, reduced him hereby to that of a fugitive beggar in <HI>Hol∣land.</HI> He survived his own misfortunes twelve years, but died with grief, on the death of his great friend <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> in 1632.</P>
<P>NEAR him is his queen, dressed in black, and with a melan∣choly look. She was the daughter of our peaceful monarch <HI>James</HI> I; who, either through hatred of war, or disapprobation of his son-in-law's ambition, reluctantly undertook his defence, and made, under <HI>Mansfield,</HI> an unfortunate essay. His daughter <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI> supported her unhappy situation with uncommon dignity, and shewed, amidst the most distressful poverty, an illustrious example of magnanimity. She visited the army of <HI>Gustavus,</HI> which had in view her husband's restoration, as well as the giving liberty to the <HI>German</HI> Protestants. The <HI>English</HI> volunteers seem to have fought her battles, inspired by love. She was the admi∣ration of the camp, and had votaries among every nation. The young <HI>Craven</HI> was among her warmest devotees, and continued his attachment to the last moment of her life; possessed her de∣served confidence, directed all her affairs, and gave a most distin∣guishing proof of his esteem, by building for her use, at his estate in <HI>Berkshire,</HI> a magnificent palace. The difference of rank alone
<PB N="177" REF="197"/>
prevented the publication of their union, which is generally sup∣posed to have taken place. Her spotless fame was never aspersed with improper connection.</P>
<P>I MUST step to another room, the picture-gallery, for the por∣trait of her admirer; a fine head, with the body armed, and crossed with a sash. Let me finish his history with saying, that after the death of <HI>Gustavus,</HI> he retired from the <HI>Swedish</HI> army into the service of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and, notwithstanding he never interfered in the civil wars of his own country, yet, in 1650, his estates were confiscated by the parlement (as is said) through false accu∣sations of favors done the exiled king. On the restoration he came over, and in 1670, on the death of the Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> he was appointed colonel of the <HI>Coldstream</HI> regiment of guards. His gallant spirit never forsook him: he braved the pestilence in its greatest fury, and, with a few other worthies, undertook the care of <HI>London</HI> in 1665, during the desolation of the plague; and in every fire, was so active in preventing the devastation of that other scourge, that it was said, <Q>his very horse smelt it out.</Q></P>
<P>I MUST return to the parlour, to mention a fine conversation-piece, consisting of prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and the duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> at table, in the manner of <HI>Dobson,</HI> by <HI>Honthurst.</HI> Those of the king of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and his queen are by the same hand; <HI>Honthurst</HI> having had the honor of instructing that unfortunate princess and her family.</P>

<P>I RETURNED through <HI>Coventry,</HI> and, passing over the site of the <HI>New gate,</HI> soon entered on a long common. At about a mile's distance from the city, on the left side of the road, stood the <HI>Chartreux,</HI> now inhabited by — <HI>Inge,</HI> Esquire. Little of the antient building remains. The wall of the precinct is still stand∣ing and in a wall in the garden are the marks of many small doors, the entrance into the cells of the austere inhabitants.</P>
<P>THIS religious house arose from the pious intentions of <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Zouch</HI> of <HI>Harringworth,</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> who obtain∣ing, in 1381, fourteen acres of land in this place from Sir <HI>Baldwyn Frevile</HI> the elder, determined on that to erect a monas∣tery of <HI>Carthusians,</HI> and endow it with ample revenues. Death prevented the execution; but in his last illness he left sixty pounds towards a future establishment.</P>
<P>THE design was speedily completed by various pious persons. <HI>Richard Luff,</HI> a mayor of <HI>Coventry,</HI> and <HI>Richard Botoner,</HI> a fellow-citizen, bestowed four hundred marks on the church-choir, clois∣ters,
<PB N="182" REF="202"/>
and three cells: others followed their example. <HI>Richard</HI> II. on his return from <HI>Scotland,</HI> in 1385, assumed the honor of being the founder, and, at the instance of his queen <HI>Anne,</HI> laid the first stone of the church with his own hands, declaring, in the pre∣sence of his nobility, and of the mayor and citizens of <HI>Coventry,</HI> that he would bring it to perfection. After this, it received con∣siderable endowments, and at the dissolution was found, accor∣ding to <HI>Dugdale,</HI> to be possessed of £131. 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> above all re∣prizes. The prior seemed to want the resolution of this severe and conscientious order; for more of this than any other resisted the will of their cruel monarch, and underwent martyrdom in support of the trusts committed to them. It is probable that <HI>John Bochard,</HI> the last who presided over the house, was prevaled on to surrender for the consideration of the great pension of forty pounds a year: after which it was granted to <HI>Richard Andrews</HI> and <HI>Leonard Chamberlain.</HI></P>
<P>A LITTLE farther I crossed the <HI>Sherbourn,</HI> leaving on the right <HI>Whitley,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHITLEY.</NOTE> a large old house, in which <HI>Charles</HI> I. resided during the attempt upon <HI>Coventry.</HI> I was told, that the history of many of his actions had been painted on the wainscot. About a mile and a half from hence I passed the <HI>Avon,</HI> at <HI>Finford</HI> bridge. This is the river that runs by <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Stratford,</HI> and discharges itself into the <HI>Severn,</HI> near <HI>Tewkesbury;</HI> still retaining the <HI>British</HI> name <HI>Afon,</HI> or river, as is the case with several others watering <HI>English</HI> ground.</P>
<P>ASCEND an extensive brow, commanding a rich and vast view toward the north and west. On the summit is a <HI>tumulus,</HI> from which the spot, which gives name to the hundred, is called <HI>Knightlow,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">KNIGHTLOW.</NOTE> or mount. It seems to have been sepulchral, and to
<PB N="183" REF="203"/>
have covered the ashes of some <HI>Roman eques,</HI> or knight, from which it was denominated. It lies very near a great <HI>Roman</HI> road, as customary with similar memorials. On it in after-times stood a cross; on whose base the inhabitants of several towns in this hundred still attend, and pay the dues to the lord on <HI>Martinmass</HI>-day: the sums are from 1<HI>d.</HI> to 2<HI>s.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> each. These rents are called <HI>Wroth-money,</HI> and <HI>Warth</HI> or <HI>Swarff penny,</HI> and are sup∣posed by <HI>Dugdale</HI> to be the same as ward-penny: <HI>Vicecomiti aut aliis castellanis persoluti ob castrorum praesidium vel excubias agendas.</HI> They must be paid at this cross before sun-rise, and the party paying must go thrice round the cross, say <HI>wroth-money,</HI> and put it into the hole in the stone before good witness, or on omission to forfeit thirty shillings and a white bull <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale,</HI> i. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A SMALL space beyond, the <HI>Roman</HI> foss-way crosses the road: <NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN ROAD.</NOTE> it enters this county at <HI>High Cross,</HI> on the verge of <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> where it is intersected by the great <HI>Watling-street,</HI> and traverses direct to <HI>Stafford upon Foss,</HI> near the edge of <HI>Glocestershire.</HI></P>
<P>Go over <HI>Dunsmore</HI> heath (now inclosed) and, after riding in a tedious avenue of elms and firs for five miles, reach <HI>Dunchurch,</HI> or the church on the hill; a small village, whose church once be∣longed to the monks of <HI>Pipwell,</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire.</HI></P>
<P>DESCEND the hill, and about three miles further go near <HI>Willoughby,</HI> or the <HI>place of willows;</HI> a little village, <NOTE PLACE="marg">WILLOUGHBY.</NOTE> with a church dedicated to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> formerly appropriated to the hospital of St. <HI>John,</HI> without <HI>East-gate, Oxford;</HI> now in the patronage of <HI>Magdalen College.</HI> This bottom, at present enlivened with the windings of the canal, assumes a commercial appearance, by the number of new buildings rising on its banks, and the magazines

of coal and limestone laid up for sale. The former gives a most comfortable prospect to the half-starved inhabitants of <HI>Northamp∣tonshire,</HI> by flattering them with the speedy approximation of the means of warmth, and giving to their poor good fuel, instead of the wretched substitute of horse-dung, which they collect in scanty portions for that purpose.</P>
<P>IT would be ungrateful to leave <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> without paying a tribute to the memory of Mr. <HI>Henry Beighton,</HI> author of the map of this county, surveyed by him in 1722, 23, 24, and 25. As it was the earliest, so it was the best performance of the kind. He had an estate of about a hundred a year, in the parish of <HI>Coton,</HI> in this county. He assisted his income by surveying, in which, for elegance, accuracy, and expedition, he had few equals. He left behind him, in his neighborhood, numbers of excellent surveyors, who own him for their master. His account of <HI>London</HI> bridge, in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions,</HI> shews his skill in mechanics. He was interred at <HI>Chilvers Coton;</HI> where a small monument barely tells that he lived and died, without men∣tioning his merit, neglected by his countrymen during life; for he never met with encouragement to publish his admirable map: which was done about the year 1750 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He begun his survey in 1725, and finished it in 1729.</NOTE>. by subscription, for the support of his widow.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Willoughby</HI> I instantly entered NORTHAMPTONSHIRE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRAUNSTON.</NOTE> in the parish of <HI>Braunston.</HI> The village, church with spire steeple, and the number of narrow inclosures, appear on the side
<PB N="185" REF="205"/>
of a slope, on the left of the road. This is among the few places I neglected to visit. I must therefore speak from Mr. <HI>Bridges</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Twenty-six.</NOTE> of its cross, twenty-four feet high; of the effigy of the Knight Templar in the church; and of the instance of the longevity of <HI>William Bren,</HI> of this village, who attained the age of an hundred and twenty-one.</P>
<P>AFTER the Conquest, the <HI>D' Aiencourts</HI> and the <HI>Peverels</HI> held land here. From the last it fell, by marriage, to <HI>Albricius de Harcourt;</HI> by his daughter, to <HI>William de Trussebot,</HI> a man raised from a low situation, by his desperate valour, to great estates. In the reign of king <HI>Stephen,</HI> being attacked in <HI>Bonville,</HI> of which he was governor, he set fire to his own house in four places; which so terrified the enemy, that they instantly evacuated the town.</P>
<P>BY his daughter <HI>Roese,</HI> it fell to <HI>Everard de Roos;</HI> a family who flourished here for several centuries, a distinguished race. One of them, <HI>William,</HI> was clamant to the crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> under the arbitration of <HI>Edward</HI> I <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>David Dalrymple's Annals Scotl.</HI> i. 203.</NOTE>.

<P>THE present lord of the manor is — <HI>Web,</HI> Esquire; who keeps in the small manor-house a court-leet and baron. <NOTE PLACE="marg">SINGULAR TENURE.</NOTE> The te∣nure of a considerable portion of land in the parish is very singular.

<P>FROM <HI>Dunchurch</HI> the country grows hilly, and till of late un∣inclosed; pleasant during the verdure of the young, and the rich yellow of the ripened corn. About three miles from <HI>Braunston</HI> appears <HI>Daventry,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">DAVENTRY.</NOTE> on the side and top of a hill. The place is populous, and carries on a considerable manufacture of whips: is an incorporated town, governed by a bailiff, twelve burgesses, and a recorder; has two serjeants at mace, and one town-clerk. The bailiff for the time is justice of the peace, and also the year following; and is likewise coroner of the inquest. The ser∣jeants may arrest any within their jurisdiction for a sum under one hundred pounds, and the cause is to be decided here. No county justice hath power in this place; the justices of the bo∣rough having power of commitment to the county-jail in crimi∣nal causes. The inhabitants also enjoy the privilege of exemp∣tion from serving on juries at the county assizes.</P>
<P>ITS charter is said to have been first granted by king <HI>John,</HI> and was renewed by queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> The place is of considerable antiquity; especially if we give into the derivation of its name, <HI>Dwy Avon tre,</HI> the town of the two <HI>Avons,</HI> or rivers, from its situation between them. Certainly it was a place of note at the Conquest; had in it sixteen plough-lands; in the manor three, with three slaves, twenty villeyns, a presbyter, and ten boors, and twelve acres of meadow. It had been worth three pounds: after that event improved to eight.</P>
<P>THIS was part of the great possessions of the countess <HI>Judith,</HI> niece to the Conqueror, whom he had married to the brave <HI>Waltheof</HI> earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> and farther to engage his fide∣lity,
<PB N="187" REF="207"/>
he gave with her this county, and that of <HI>Huntingdon. Wal∣theof</HI> unfortunately engaged in a conspiracy; and, notwithstanding he repented, and flung himself at the king's mercy, was beheaded in 1074, at the instigation of his wife <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Order Vital.</HI></NOTE>. It seems she had cast a favorable eye on another person: but was disappointed; for the king offered to her <HI>Simon de Liz,</HI> a noble <HI>Norman,</HI> lame of one leg: him she rejected; which so enraged her uncle, that he de∣prived her of the two earldoms, and gave them to <HI>De Liz,</HI> with her eldest daughter; which obliged <HI>Judith</HI> to a state of peniten∣tial widowhood during life.</P>
<P>HERE are some remains of the priory, <NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIORY.</NOTE> inhabited by poor fami∣lies. The place is easily discovered, by several gothic windows, and a door accessible by a great flight of steps. Four <HI>Cluniac</HI> monks were originally placed at <HI>Preston Capes,</HI> in this county, by <HI>Hugh de Leycester,</HI> sheriff of the county, and steward to <HI>Maud,</HI> sister to the first <HI>S. Liz</HI> earl of <HI>Huntingdon;</HI> but finding the situa∣tion inconvenient, for want of water, he built a priory here; to which place he removed them, about the year 1090. It was dedicated to St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> and was subordinate to St. <HI>Mary de Caritate</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 375.</NOTE>. Its spiritualities were valued at £115. 17<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d. per annum;</HI> its temporalities £120. 10<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> Cardinal <HI>Wolsey</HI> made five of his emissaries to pick a quarrel with the poor monks, about certain lands of theirs; and, causing the dispute to be referred to himself, took occasion to dissolve the house, and, as <HI>Stow</HI> says, to be given to his own college. <Q>But of this irreligious robbery, done of no conscience, but to patch up pride, which private wealth could not furnish, what punish∣ment
<PB N="188" REF="208"/>
hath since ensued by God's hand (sayeth mine author) partly ourselves have seen; for of those five persons, two fell at discord between themselves, and the one slew the other; for which the survivor was hanged: the third drowned himself in a well: the fourth, being well known, and valued worth two hundred pounds, became in three years so poore, that he begged till his dying-day: and the fift, called Doctor <HI>Allane,</HI> being cheefe executor of these doings, was cruelly maimed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> even at such time as he was bishop <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Annals,</HI> 522.</NOTE></Q>.—The pious his∣torian then traces the judgment to the cardinal, who died under the king's displeasure: to the colleges which occasioned the sacri∣lege; that of <HI>Ipswich</HI> being pulled down; that of <HI>Christ-church</HI> never finished under <HI>Wolsey</HI>'s patronage: and lastly to the pope, who permitted these violences on religious houses; for he was besieged in his holy see, and suffered a long imprisonment.</P>
<P>THE parish-church had been the conventual: <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> of late years it was handsomely rebuilt; but is no more than a curacy in the gift of <HI>Christ-church</HI> college. The arms of the college, and of the earl of <HI>Winchelsea,</HI> lord of the manor, grace the east window.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Daventry</HI> I visited the noted camps on <HI>Borough-hill,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">BOROUGH-HILL.</NOTE> or <HI>Danes-hill,</HI> about a mile south-east of the town. It is lofty and insulated. The area is of an oblong or oval form, about a mea∣sured mile in length, and near two in circumference. The whole is surrounded by two, three, or four deep trenches, and the same number of great ramparts, or banks; according as the strength or weakness of the ground required. These
<PB N="189" REF="209"/>
run on the margin of the hill, and on the slope; and hav∣ing the entrance on the eastern and western sides opposite to each other.</P>
<P>WITHIN the area, near the middle, is a bank, which passes strait from the western side towards the eastern: the remainder is destroyed. Farther on is the vestige of another, running paral∣lel. These, when entire, would have formed a rectangular camp, by the assistance of part of the ditches on the sides of the hill.</P>
<P>NEAR this camp are several <HI>tumuli</HI> of the sepulchral kind; but since Mr. <HI>Morton</HI>'s time, their number is evidently lessened; for in his days, he informs us, there were eighteen.</P>
<P>THE northern end of the hill is formed into a third camp, of a circular shape, and of vast strength. Two ditches, of prodigious depth, with suitable ramparts, and a deep entrance, cross the area, and fall into the general surrounding ditches, which have been deepened to add to the strength of the third part. There is like∣wise the imperfect remains of another ditch and bank on the out∣side, a little south, designed to add to the security.</P>
<P>ON the north-west part of the great rampart of this round camp, is a great mount, either exploratory, or the spot where the chieftain pitched his tent.</P>
<P>I MUST differ with Mr. <HI>Morton</HI> about the makers of the first of these camps or posts, which were the <HI>Britons</HI> themselves. It has every agreement with the multitudes of others scattered over the kingdom, and suits exactly with the description left by <HI>Tacitus</HI> of the method of defence used by our ancestors, <HI>Tunc montibus arduis, et si qua clementer accedi poterunt in modum valli saxa praestruit.</HI> I
<PB N="190" REF="210"/>
shall not here repeat what I have fully dwelt on in my Tours in <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour Scotl.</HI> 1772, part ii. 159. <HI>Tour Wales,</HI> 413.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS post was in all probability made use of when the victo∣rious <HI>Ostorius</HI> was traversing this island, to quell the commotions he found on his arrival in <HI>Britain.</HI> It is evident, that the <HI>Britons</HI> at this period made use of the same species of defence which is proved to have been common to the whole country. The <HI>Iceni</HI> lodged themselves within a post of this kind, against this very general <HI>(Locum pugnae delegere septum agresti aggere et aditu angus∣to ne pervius equis foret)</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Taciti Annal.</HI> lib. xii. c. 31.</NOTE> but it did not avale. The <HI>Coritani</HI> of these parts had recourse to the strong hold of what I dare say they called <HI>Ben Avon,</HI> or the head over the river; one of the streams which form the <HI>Nen,</HI> the river of this country, passing be∣neath.</P>
<P>THIS post proved no obstacle to the Conqueror; he found it sit for a station: he contracted its limits east into the shape of the camps of his people, and made this a summer station, as he did the warm bottom, near the fort, a winter station. Numbers of <HI>Roman</HI> coins found on the spots, evince the conjecture. The <HI>Romans,</HI> as is frequently the case, latinized the <HI>British</HI> name, and formed from it their <HI>Benvenna;</HI> which I beg leave to place here, rather than at <HI>Wedon,</HI> a place destitute of all classical traces.</P>
<P>I MUST add, that on the south-east side of <HI>Borough-hill,</HI> about two or three hundred yards below the ditches, is a lesser camp, surrounded by a foss and bank. Mr. <HI>Morton</HI> guesses it to have
<PB N="191" REF="211"/>
been the receptacle of the carriages of the greater camp: I ima∣gine it to have been a <HI>procestria,</HI> a sort of free post attendant often on camps, where provisions and other necessaries were brought.</P>
<P>As to the third division of the area of this hill, it is probably <HI>Saxon;</HI> the words <HI>borough, burgh, berry,</HI> and <HI>bury,</HI> being the constant appellation left by the <HI>Saxons</HI> to similar places. It is my belief, that every post of this nature, occupied by that nation in our island, had been originally <HI>British;</HI> which they altered to their conceptions of strength and defence; which was usually done by deepening the ditches, raising the ramparts, and clearing the area, and often exalting one part into what was called the <HI>dunjeon,</HI> or keep. These places were stationary, not properly camps; for the antient <HI>Germans,</HI> from whom these invaders were derived, and whose cus∣toms they retained, made use of no other defence to their camps than a barrier of waggons, with which they formed the precinct. <HI>Omnes Barbari,</HI> says <HI>Vegetius, carris suis in orbem connexis ad simili∣tudinem castrorum securas a supervenientibus exigunt noctes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. iii. c. 10.</NOTE>. Caesar</HI> twice <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bell. Gal.</HI> lib. 1. &amp; lib. iv.</NOTE> mentions this custom among the <HI>German</HI> nations; and I am told, that even in later days, this mode of defence has been used, and called <HI>Waggenburg,</HI> or the camp of <HI>waggons.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY thing on this hill must not be attributed to remote an∣tiquity; for <HI>Charles</HI> I. a few days before the fatal battle of <HI>Naseby,</HI> occupied this post, and fortified it: so possibly some of the entrenchments might be the work of the unfortunate mo∣narch <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitelock,</HI> 150.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="212"/>
I MUST not quit this place without mentioning a spot which I overlooked. <NOTE PLACE="marg">BURNT WALLS.</NOTE> This is what Mr. <HI>Morton</HI> calls the <HI>Burnt Walls;</HI> where many loads of walls and foundations have been dug up. The precinct is about six acres, and was moated round. The water that filled the moat was conveyed from pools in <HI>Daventry Park,</HI> a place not remote. Tradition says, that within the area stood a seat of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt;</HI> which is probable, as this manor was once possessed by the earls and dukes of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> in <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> III's time, annexed to that dutchy, and assigned to that great duke <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Northampt.</HI> 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CONTINUE my journey: turn a little out of my road, on the left, <NOTE PLACE="marg">DODFORD CHURCH.</NOTE> to <HI>Dodford</HI> church; and found there a tomb of a cross-legged knight, armed in mail, with both hands upon his sword, as if in the attitude of drawing it. On his shield are, ill-blazoned, <HI>vaire, argent</HI> and <HI>azure;</HI> two bars <HI>gules,</HI> which denote the person here deposited to have been a <HI>Keynes,</HI> one of the antient lords of the place; and, from the attitude of his legs, to have lived during the fashionable madness of crusades.</P>
<P>Two ladies, in hoods, recumbent, said to have been two sisters, co-heiresses of the manor, and probably <HI>Margaret</HI> and <HI>Maud de Ayote,</HI> who were possessed of this manor, I think, in the time of <HI>Richard</HI> II; which descended to their father, <HI>Laurence,</HI> from his mother, <HI>Lettice,</HI> sister to <HI>William de Keynes.</HI></P>

<P>IN this manor, the <HI>Watling-street</HI> crosses the road to <HI>Wedon:</HI> it enters the county at <HI>Dowbridge,</HI> on the edge of <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> passes close by <HI>Borough-hill,</HI> and proceeds from <HI>Wedon</HI> to <HI>Toucester</HI> and <HI>Stoney Stratford,</HI> where it enters the county of <HI>Bucks.</HI></P>
<P>NEAR the sixty-eighth mile-stone is the entrance to the new turnpike-road to <HI>Northampton,</HI> which is above seven miles dis∣tant; and on an eminence, a little to the left, is pleasantly seated the church and village of <HI>Flore,</HI> or <HI>Flower.</HI></P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond, on the right, lies the village of <HI>Wedon on the Street,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WEDON.</NOTE> or <HI>Weedon Bec;</HI> from which I chuse to transfer the old <HI>Bennevenna</HI> to <HI>Borough-hill,</HI> on account of deficiency of classical evidence at this place, and the little difference of distance from the other stations.</P>
<P>SUFFICIENT honor will remain to <HI>Wedon,</HI> in allowing it to have been the site of the royal palace of <HI>Wulfere</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bridges,</HI> 93.</NOTE>, the <HI>Mercian</HI> mo∣narch; afterwards converted into a nunnery, at the instance of his daughter, St. <HI>Werburg;</HI> who presided for a time over it. Here she performed the miracle of the wild geese; who, at her word, forgot their nature, were driven by her steward from their ravages among the corn, into the grange, and, after receiving from her a severe check for their depredations, were commanded to take wing, and never appear in her demesns. They obeyed in part, but kept hovering about, till one of their companions, which had
<PB N="194" REF="214"/>
been stolen (and some say eaten) by a servant, was restored; on which they bid an eternal adieu to the fields of <HI>Wedon</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cressy's Cb. Hist.</HI> 427.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS nunnery was destroyed by the <HI>Danes;</HI> but the memory of the foundress was preserved in <HI>Leland</HI>'s day, by a fair chapel dedicated to that saint <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland Itin.</HI> i. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the Conquest, <HI>Roger de Thebovil</HI> gave a moiety of lands in this monastery to the abbey of <HI>Bec,</HI> in <HI>Normandy;</HI> which was, with many other grants to the same house, confirmed by <HI>Henry</HI> II. That abbey afterwards became possessed of the whole, when it was made dependent on their great cell or priory at <HI>Okeburn,</HI> in <HI>Wilt∣shire.</HI> Vast privileges were bestowed in favor of the monks of this abbey; such as exemption from suit and service to the county and hundred courts; from toll passage and pontage; and exemption from forest laws. They had also free warren, and right of determining in murder, manslaughter, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> all which perished at the dissolution of the priories; and this manor, as part of the possessions of <HI>Okeburn,</HI> was vested in the provost and fellows of <HI>Eton</HI> college, by <HI>Henry</HI> VI; in which it still con∣tinues <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Northampt.</HI> 93; in which Mr. <HI>Bridges</HI> denies that there ever was a priory here, as Sir <HI>W. Dugdale</HI> and Bishop <HI>Tanner</HI> imagine.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM hence, I was led by my curiosity about two miles west∣ward, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE DIKES.</NOTE> to <HI>Castle Dikes,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Farthingstone,</HI> remarkable for some antient works attributed to the <HI>Saxons.</HI> They are placed on the brow of a steep hill, commanding a vast view; but at pre∣sent so overgrown with thick woods, that I had but a very in∣distinct sight of them. They appeared to comprehend near thir∣teen
<PB N="195" REF="215"/>
acres of ground, and to consist of strong holds, divided from each other by a ditch of stupendous breadth and depth. A plat, called the <HI>Castle-yard,</HI> stands to the south-west of these, entrenched on all sides but the south-west, comprehending about seven acres, on which, tradition says, a town was situated.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Morton</HI> informs us, that a vaulted room, formed of squared stones, was discovered in his time, and beneath that another, which falling in accidentally, a smell, resembling that of putrid carcases, issued from it. Two or three, rude sculptures were also discovered among the rubbish.</P>
<P>IT is conjectured that this place was burnt by the <HI>Danes;</HI> for vast masses of cinders, mixed with pebbles and clay, have been found in different parts; and many of the stones had on them the marks of fire <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Morton,</HI> 543.</NOTE>. There is no account left of the particulars of their ravages; so this rests upon conjecture, as well as the notion of <HI>Ethelfleda</HI> having been founder of this place, among her other great works performed in 913.</P>
<P>ON my return to the great road, about two miles from the place, I visited the church of <HI>Stow-nine-Churches,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">STOW-NINE-CHURCHES.</NOTE> to see the most elegant tomb which this or any other kingdom can boast of; that of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> fourth daughter of <HI>John</HI> lord <HI>Latimer,</HI> wife, first to Sir <HI>John Danvers,</HI> of <HI>Dantrey, Wiltshire,</HI> and afterwards to Sir <HI>Edmund Cary,</HI> third son of <HI>Henry</HI> lord <HI>Hunsdon.</HI> Her figure is of white marble, lying recumbent on a slab of black. The attitude is the most easy possible, that of one asleep; her head, covered with a loose hood, reclines on a rich cushion. One hand is placed on her breast, the other lies on one side. Round her neck is a
<PB N="196" REF="216"/>
quilled ruff. The fashionable stiffness of her embroidered stays is a disadvantage to this elegant sculpture. Her gown flows to her feet in easy folds, and covers them. She lies on a long cloak, lined with ermine, fastened at her neck with rich jewels. At her feet is a <HI>griffin</HI> holding a shield of the family-arms. The whole rests on a white marble altar-tomb, with inscriptions and arms on the sides. After informing us of her parentage, marriages, and children, are these lines:
<Q><P>Sic familia praeclara</P>
<P>Praeclarior prole</P>
<P>Virtute praeclarissima</P>
<P>Aetatis 84,</P>
<P>Anno</P>
<P>Dni. 1630.</P>
<P>Commutavit Saecula; non obiit.</P></Q></P>
<P>She left three sons and seven daughters by her first husband. Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> the eldest, lost his head through his unfortunate attach∣ment to the ill-fated Earl of <HI>Essex; Henry,</HI> an able warrior, died Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> full of years and glory; Sir <HI>John</HI> married into the great family of the <HI>Newports,</HI> in <HI>Shropshire.</HI></P>
<P>THIS noble monument was erected by the lady in her life∣time, and was the <HI>chef d'oeuvre</HI> of that great statuary <HI>Nicholas Stone,</HI> master-mason to king <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> I. statuary and stone cutter; so humbly does he stile himself. It appears by a note of his, that, <Q><HI>March</HI> the 16. 1617.

I refer the reader to that elegant performance for a list of his works. Let me add, that the first time I saw this beautiful tomb, it was going fast to de∣cay; but, since that time, has been fully restored, by the care of the worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ector and (I think) patron of this church, Doctor <HI>Lloyd.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>OPPOSITE to this is a very handsome <HI>cenotaph,</HI> in memory of the Reverend Doctor <HI>Thomas Turner,</HI> born at <HI>Bristol</HI> in 1645, and buried in 1714, in <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> college, <HI>Oxford,</HI> of which he had been president.</P>
<P>HE laid out his great income in acts of hospitality and cha∣rity; and on his death, after bequeathing £4000 to his rela∣tions and friends, left the rest of his wealth to pious uses. He augmented the stipends of the poorer members of <HI>Ely</HI> cathedral, in which he was prebend: he left £100 to be expended in ap∣prenticing poor children of that city: he left £6000 for im∣proving the buildings of the college he presided over: and fi∣nally, left £20,000 to be laid out by his executors in estates and lands, to be settled by them on the governors of the charity for the relief of the poor widows and children, of the clergy. Ac∣cordingly they purchased this manor, and other estates here, and at <HI>West Wratling</HI> in <HI>Cambridgeshire,</HI> to the amount of up∣wards of £1000 a year, and settled them, in 1716, agreeable to his will <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis's Cathedrals,</HI> ii. 389.</NOTE>. This manor was purchased from <HI>Edward Hooley,</HI> Esquire, for £16,000; which occasioned the honorable mark of gratitude in this church. It is singular, that <HI>Francis Turner,</HI> bi∣shop
<PB N="198" REF="218"/>
of <HI>Ely,</HI> lost his preferments in 1690, for refusing the oaths to <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> when this gentleman, his brother, had the good fortune to preserve his, without injuring his conscience.</P>
<P>IN 1702, the last year allowed for undergoing the test, he left <HI>London</HI> on the 28th of <HI>July,</HI> and went to <HI>Oxford</HI> with a full reso∣lution to sacrifice all his preferments on the first of <HI>August,</HI> the last day allowed by the act. He wisely made no resignation, well knowing that his refusal would be ample deprivation. Whether he was forgotten, or whether the omission was winked at, does not appear; but he retained all his benefices to his dying day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bentham's Hist. Ely,</HI> 263.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS charitable divine is placed standing in a graceful atti∣tude, in his master of arts robes, in his own hair, under a canopy supported by two fluted pillars of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> order, of colored marble. On the side of him is Religion, represented by a woman on a celestial globe, with a cross in one, and a font in the other hand. On the last is inscribed <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The doctor stands on a terrestrial globe, with a book in his hand, in which is written <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The account of his various charities is placed on the pediment.</P>
<P>IN a corner of an aile, to make room for this sumptuous monu∣ment, was removed the tomb of a cross-legged knight, armed in mail, and partly covered with a surtout. One hand is on his breast, the other on his sword. On an enormous shield, which is belted to his body, is a rude figure of a lion passant guardant, and crowned. He is supposed to be one of the <HI>Gilbert de Gants,</HI> the
<PB N="199" REF="219"/>
antient owners. There were five of them. The first was great nephew to the Conqueror; the last died in 1295.</P>
<P>FROM hence I descended to the great road: the country hilly and clayey. The quarries are of a coarse grit stone, often filled with shells, but of too shattery a nature to be used, except in or∣dinary buildings. A few miles farther is an eminence, called <HI>Forster's Booth,</HI> so named from a booth erected here by one <HI>Forster,</HI> a poor countryman. It grew at length into a scattered street, of several houses and carriers inns, through which runs the <HI>Wat∣ling-street</HI> road in a direct line to <HI>Toucester,</HI> four miles distant.</P>
<P>THIS is a pretty considerable town, seated on a plain, <NOTE PLACE="marg">TOUCESTER.</NOTE> on a small stream called the <HI>Tove,</HI> from which the name is derived; <HI>Tou∣cester,</HI> or the castle on the <HI>Tove.</HI> The great <HI>tumulus</HI> on the east side of the town, points out of the site of the <HI>speculum</HI> or watch∣tower. The <HI>Roman</HI> coins found in digging about, prove it to have been an appendage to a <HI>Roman</HI> station, whose name has ne∣ver reached us. The <HI>Saxons</HI> profited of this little fortress, and added the foss which surrounded it. From them it received its present title of the <HI>Bury,</HI> or <HI>Borough,</HI> to which has been since added the double tautology of <HI>Berry Mounthill.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Saxons</HI> called the town <HI>Tofeceastre.</HI> In the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Elder it was almost ruined by the ravages of the <HI>Danes;</HI> but in 921, the king determined to restore it, and for that purpose detached part of his forces; who, soon after their arrival, were at∣tacked by the <HI>Danes</HI> resident in <HI>Northampton</HI> and <HI>Leicester</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sax. Chr.</HI> 107.</NOTE>; but, assisted by the townsmen, they repelled the barbarians; and <HI>Ed∣ward,</HI> in order to prevent future insults, fortified the whole place
<PB N="200" REF="220"/>
with a stone wall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sax. Chr.</HI> 108.</NOTE>. But time hath destroyed every vestige of it.</P>
<P>THIS manor, after various changes, became the property of the famous Sir <HI>Richard Empson,</HI> one of the instruments of the avarice and oppression of <HI>Henry</HI> VII; who, in 1509, lost his head, with <HI>Edmund Dudley,</HI> on <HI>Tower-hill;</HI> perhaps more deservedly than le∣gally. <HI>Empson</HI> had been the son of a sieve-maker in this town: by his great abilities in the profession of the law, he was promoted to the chancellorship of the duchy of <HI>Lancaster;</HI> but by his un∣bounded submission to the will of his rapacious master, fell a vic∣tim, in the next reign, to the demands of an enraged nation. At present, the manor belongs to the Earl of <HI>Pomfret,</HI> who derives it from his ancestor <HI>Richard Fermor,</HI> a merchant of <HI>Calais,</HI> and a younger brother of the antient house of <HI>Fermors,</HI> of <HI>Oxford∣shire.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was a church here at the Conquest, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> which was given by the Conqueror to the abbey of St. <HI>Wandragasile,</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI> In the present, is nothing remarkable, excepting the tomb of <HI>William Sponne,</HI> archdeacon of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and rector of this parish in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. who founded here a college and chantry for two priests to say mass for his soul, and the souls of his friends. At the dissolution, it was worth £19. 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> a year <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 388.</NOTE>. He was also a great benefactor to the town, and his charities are still felt here, governed by feoffees, consisting of fifteen of the principal inha∣bitants.</P>
<P>HIS figure is represented recumbent, dressed in a red gown, which reaches round his feet, with ermine hood and sleeves. Be∣neath is another representation of him after death, with a sunk

nose and emaciated body, and all the changes wrought by that fell monster on the human frame.</P>
<P>THE town is supported by the great concourse of passengers, and by a manufacture of lace, and a small one of silk stockings. The first was imported from <HI>Flanders,</HI> and carried on with much success in this place, and still more in the neighboring county of <HI>Buckingham.</HI></P>
<P>I TOOK a walk about a mile east of the town, to see <HI>Easton-Neston,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">EASTON-NESTON.</NOTE> the seat of the Earl <HI>Pomfret.</HI> The wings were built by Sir <HI>Christopher Wren,</HI> in 1682; the center by <HI>Hawkesmore,</HI> about twenty years after, who is said to have departed greatly from the original design. It has nine windows in front, and is enriched with pilasters. The inside has been long since despoiled of its curious portraits and valuable statues: the latter having been presented to the university of <HI>Oxford,</HI> by the late Countess of <HI>Pomfret,</HI> grandaughter to the lord chancellor <HI>Jeffries.</HI></P>
<P>THIS manor was purchased by the same <HI>Richard Fermor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MANOR.</NOTE> in 1530, from <HI>Thomas,</HI> son of Sir <HI>Richard Empson.</HI> The antient house stood below the church, in a park inclosed by Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> by licence from <HI>Henry</HI> VII, at the time it came into the possession of Mr. <HI>Fermor.</HI> He lived here with boundless hospitality, till the year 1540, when, for sending 8<HI>d.</HI> and a couple of shirts, to one <HI>Nicholas Thane,</HI> his confessor, then in prison at <HI>Buckingham</HI> for denying the king's supremacy, he incurred the tyrant's displea∣sure. He fell under a praemunire, and, in his old-age, being stripped of all he had, was forced to live with the parson of, <HI>Wapenham</HI> (whom he had presented); which he did for seve∣ral years, with consummate piety and resignation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bridges,</HI> 290.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="222"/>
THE recovery of part of his fortune was owing to a singular accident. During his prosperous days he kept, as usual in those days, in the establishment of people of rank, a fool or jester: his was the noted <HI>Wil. Sommers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WIL. SOMMERS.</NOTE> who, for his drollery, was promoted to the same office under <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. I have a very scarce print of this illustrious personage, by <HI>Delaram,</HI> with all the insignia of his place about him. <HI>Wil.</HI> with a gratitude not frequent at courts, remembered his old master; and in the latter days of <HI>Henry,</HI> when his constitution was weakened by infirmities, took occasion, by some well-timed speech, to awaken the king's conscience; who, touched with a compunction rarely known to him, ordered restitution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collins's Peerage,</HI> v. 50.</NOTE>; but died before it could be effected. His pious successor, <HI>Edward</HI> VI. restored to him this manor, that of <HI>Touces∣ter,</HI> and some others of his estates, and added many grants, by way of compensation for the injury done him; but all fell short of the great losses he had sustained from the cruel father. He returned to his house, which he enjoyed only two years, dying in <HI>January</HI> 1552-3. He seemed to have a presage of his end; for on the day of his death he had invited a number of his friends and neighbors, took his leave of them, retired to his closet, and was found dead in an attitude of devotion <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. His tomb, with his figure in brass, and that of his wife, are still to be seen in the ad∣jacent church.</P>
<P>THERE are, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> besides, several other family-monuments. Sir <HI>John Fermor</HI> (son of <HI>Richard</HI>) and <HI>Maud</HI> his wife, are represented kneel∣ing at a desk, beneath an arch: she is dressed in a great ruff and lappets. He, perhaps out of respect to his father's sufferings in
<PB N="203" REF="223"/>
the cause of the see of <HI>Rome,</HI> received the honor of Knight of the Bath at the coronation of queen <HI>Mary.</HI> He died in 1571.</P>
<P>His son Sir <HI>George</HI> lies in alabaster, recumbent and armed, with peaked beard and small whiskers. His wife, <HI>Mary</HI> daughter of <HI>Thomas Curzon,</HI> of <HI>Addington, Bucks,</HI> lies by him, dressed in a gown tied neatly with ribands from top to bottom, a quilled ruff, and great <HI>tete à caleche.</HI> Beneath are represented, kneeling, their seven sons and eight daughters. Above all, is a vast quantity of ornaments, arms, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> This gentleman might, like Sir <HI>Fulk Grevil,</HI> have boasted of being the friend of Sir <HI>Philip Sydney,</HI> having contracted an intimacy with him in the wars in the <HI>Ne∣therlands,</HI> where he served all his youth, under <HI>William</HI> prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and walked at the funeral of the celebrated <HI>English</HI> hero. He also improved himself by foreign travel; lived at home with vast splendor and hospitality; and, on <HI>June</HI> 11, 1603, his house had the honor of being the place of meeting between <HI>James</HI> I. and his queen, on her journey from <HI>Scotland,</HI> to receive her new crown. Here they dined, and were entertained, with all their trains, in a princely manner <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collins, 52.</HI></NOTE>. He quitted this life in 1612.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Hatton Fermor,</HI> who with nine other gentlemen were knighted at the above interview, is also buried here. He died of the consequences of a broken leg, in 1620. He and his lady are very elegant figures, placed standing: he armed; in great boots, flapping down; vast whiskers; peaked beard; and, what was not in use at the time of his death, a cravat. It seems the monument was not erected till 1662, when his widow <HI>Anna,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>William Cockain,</HI> lord mayor of <HI>London,</HI> gave this proof of her affec∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="224"/>
She is dressed in a loose gown, and with long flowing tresses: her hand is on an hour-glass; his on a scroll: between, is a bust of a man in long hair: above, are three most aukward figures of kneeling women. I must not quit the lady, without saying she suffered, with exemplary patience, a long imprisonment and great confiscations, on account of the loyalty of her family; which were rewarded with a peerage in the person of her son Sir <HI>William Fermor.</HI></P>
<P>FROM hence I continued my journey southward, and much of the way near the borders of <HI>Whittlewood,</HI> or <HI>Whittlebury Forest,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">WHITTLEBURY FOREST.</NOTE> which still continues wooded for several miles in length, and of different extents in breadth, in a most deep and clayey country. Much of the timber is cut in rotation, but in parts towards the edge of <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> are considerable quantities of good oak. This forest remained in the crown till the year 1685, when <HI>Henry Fitz-roy,</HI> first duke of <HI>Grafton,</HI> was appointed hereditary ranger. The present duke hath an elegant house, called <HI>Wakefield Lodge</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Designed by <HI>W. Kent.</HI></NOTE>, originally built by Mr. <HI>Claypole,</HI> son-in-law to <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> and ranger of the forest. This was one of the five tracts, called walks; <HI>viz. Wakefield, Shelbrook, Hazelbury, Shrob,</HI> and <HI>Hanger.</HI> Fourteen townships are allowed the right of common in the open coppices and ridings, from the principle of justice, that some re∣paration might be made to them for the damages sustained by the deer. In this great tract here are two lawns, <HI>i. e.</HI> spots in∣closed with pales, for pasture for the deer: one is <HI>Wakefield Lawn,</HI> the other <HI>Sholbrook Lawn,</HI> which are secluded from the forest cattle.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="225"/>
THAT fierce animal the wild cat, is still met with in this forest. In the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> I. the abbot and convent of <HI>Peterborough</HI> had a charter for hunting in this place the hare, the fox, and the wild cat; which was confirmed to them, in 1253, by <HI>Henry</HI> III <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Morton,</HI> 443.</NOTE>. By these charters, the wild cat should be added to the beasts of forest, or of venerie; which the book of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> and old Sir <HI>Tristram,</HI> in his <HI>worthie Treatise of Hunting,</HI> confined to the hart, the hynde, the hare, the boare, and the wolfe: the hart and hind being separated, because the season of hunting them was diffe∣rent; yet they remain in species still the same. Beasts of the chace (which was an inferior sort of forest) were the buck, the doe, the fox, the martion, and the roe <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Manwood's Forest Laws,</HI> 39.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fondness that seized the regular clergy for the pleasures of the chace, did not appear till after the Conquest. The <HI>Saxon</HI> clergy were expressly forbidden the amusement. King <HI>Edgar</HI> directs the priest <Q>to be neither a hunter nor hawker, nor yet a tippler; but to keep close to his books, as becomes a man of his order <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leges Saxon.</HI> 86.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE canon law still preserved its severity, and forbad to spi∣ritual persons the amusement of the chace. This probably was rather designed to check what might by the excess estrange them from their sacred function. The common law, from a principle of good sense and humanity, permitted the recreation, from these ar∣guments; that nothing could contribute more effectually to the performance of their duty than good health, resulting from fit ex∣ercise; as nothing could disqualify them so greatly as the disor∣ders arising from a sedentary life. This indulgence probably
<PB N="206" REF="226"/>
soon ended in abuse. In the twelfth century, we find <HI>Abelard</HI> un∣happy in presiding over a monastery of huntsmen. <HI>Chaucer,</HI> as I have before quoted, flings a fine ridicule on the sporting monk. Finally, the chace became so necessary an appendage to the ec∣clesiastical state, that every see had a number of parks: that of <HI>Norwich,</HI> thirteen; and the sixth mortuary which the king clamed on the death of a prelate, was his kennel of hounds.</P>
<P>PASS by <HI>Potters Pery,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">POTTERS PERY.</NOTE> a village which takes its name from the manufacture of coarse ware, such as flower-pots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which has been long carried on here. The clay is yellowish, pure, and firm; yet the pots made with it are very brittle, unless glazed; when they endure the weather as well as any.</P>
<P>THE post-road is still continued the whole way on or near the <HI>Watling-street.</HI> Near <HI>Potters Pery</HI> I quitted it, <NOTE PLACE="marg">PASSENHAM.</NOTE> through curiosity of visiting <HI>Passenham,</HI> about a mile or two distant, on the banks of the <HI>Ouze,</HI> near this village. <HI>Edward</HI> the Elder encamped here to cover his workmen, who were employed in building the walls of <HI>Toucester</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Saxon Chr.</HI> 108.</NOTE>, from being interrupted by the <HI>Danes.</HI> A square en∣trenchment is supposed to have been cast up by him, and garri∣soned for that purpose.</P>
<P>THE church is small, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> and without ailes; dedicated to <HI>Guth∣laius,</HI> the saint of the fens. It was rebuilt in 1626, at the sole ex∣pence of Sir <HI>Robert Banastre.</HI> This gentleman was lord of the manor; he died in 1649, aged about eighty. His figure is a half∣length, with a book in his hand, placed against the wall. His epitaph informs us, that he was born at <HI>Wem,</HI> in <HI>Shropshire;</HI> that he was bred at court, and served three princes; that he had three
<PB N="207" REF="227"/>
wives, and by the last an only daughter, who conveyed the estate, by marriage with <HI>William</HI> lord <HI>Maynard,</HI> into that family; a younger branch of which possesses it, as I apprehend, at pre∣sent.</P>
<P>I REGAINED the great road, and passed through the hamlet of <HI>Old Stratford,</HI> seated on rich meadows, <NOTE PLACE="marg">OLD STRATFORD.</NOTE> watered by the <HI>Ouze'</HI> which rises in this county, not remote from <HI>Brackly.</HI> This place is reasonably supposed to have been the <HI>Lactodorum,</HI> or <HI>Lactoro∣dum,</HI> of the <HI>Itinerary,</HI> as the distance suits extremely well, and <HI>Roman</HI> coins have been found in the neighboring fields. Anti∣quaries derive it from <HI>Llech dwr,</HI> and <HI>Llech rhyd:</HI> one signifying the stone on the water; the other, the stone on the ford <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Gale,</HI> 60, and <HI>Burton,</HI> 144.</NOTE>: a name bestowed on it by the <HI>Britons,</HI> probably because the bank of the river was marked by a military stone on this great military way. I here cross the river into BUCKINGHAMSHIRE; which, with <HI>Bedfordshire</HI> and <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> formed the country of the <HI>Catticuchlani.</HI> The present name is, according to Mr. <HI>Camb∣den,</HI> taken from the quantity of beeches found in parts of it; a word derived from the <HI>Saxon bucken.</HI> Two arguments serve to confirm the assertion of <HI>Caesar,</HI> that this tree was not found in <HI>Britain</HI> at the time of his invasion: one is, that the woods of it are merely local, and confined to a very few of our southern counties: the other is, that the <HI>Britons</HI> had no name for it, but

<P>ON crossing the <HI>Ouze</HI> I entered <HI>Stoney Stratford,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">STONEY STRATFORD.</NOTE> a town built on each side of the <HI>Watling-street.</HI> It suffered greatly by fire on <HI>May</HI> the 19th, 1742, which almost destroyed the whole place; but it was soon restored by the vigour of <HI>English</HI> charity. One church (that of St. <HI>Giles</HI>) has never been rebuilt; the body of the other (St. <HI>Magdalene</HI>'s) is restored in a very handsome manner, by Mr. <HI>Irons,</HI> architect in <HI>Warwick,</HI> and, I suppose, enlarged sufficiently to supply the want of the other. St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s had been a chantry, valued at £20. 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> a year; and was at the time of its ruin a curacy: St. <HI>Magdalene</HI>'s was a chapel belonging to <HI>Wolverton,</HI> but now in the presentation of the parishioners.</P>
<P>MY journey was continued along the <HI>Street</HI> road to the 47th stone, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BLECHELEY CHURCH.</NOTE> where, tempted by the same of certain monuments in <HI>Blecheley</HI> church, I digressed about a mile and a quarter to the right. I found there a very fine alabaster tomb of <HI>Richard</HI> lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Wilton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMB OF LORD GREY.</NOTE> restored by the celebrated antiquarian <HI>Brown Willis,</HI> Esquire, who added an inscription, and in the front the arms. From the former we find, that besides <HI>Richard,</HI> his son <HI>Reginald,</HI> who died <HI>February</HI> 22, 1493; and his great granson <HI>Edmund,</HI> who died <HI>Water-hall,</HI> on <HI>May</HI> 6th 1611; were interred here.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Richard</HI> lord <HI>Grey,</HI> by will, dated at <HI>Blecheley, August</HI> 12, 1442, bequeaths his body to be buried in the church of the <HI>B. V.

<P>THE tomb is of alabaster: his figure is armed, his hair cropt, his face without a beard; round his neck is a collar of SS, and round the lower part of his armour is another collar of jewels, in the midst of which is a small shield with the cross St. <HI>George;</HI> for he was made Knight of the Garter by <HI>Richard</HI> II.

<P>A CELL, consisting of a prior and a few <HI>Benedictines</HI> from St. <HI>Albans,</HI> was placed here.

beautiful risings varied with woods, and inclosures dressed with a garden-like elegance.

<P>THIS manor was, from very antient times, part of the lands of the abbey of St. <HI>Albans:</HI> the original name is not delivered to us; that which it has at present was derived from <HI>Robert de Gorham,</HI> elected abbot of the house in 1151.

Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> makes a most finical appearance: his habit elegant: has on a sash, a hat with a white feather, laced turnover, a long love-lock extended on his left arm, an ear-ring in one ear, a spear in the other, and brown boots. Thus he is represented as a smart office-clerk, walking in his new-acquired park; for he was clerk of the privy council to two kings: and got possession of <HI>Gorhambury</HI> from his master, who conveyed it to him on foreseeing his fall. Like a grateful servant, <HI>Meautys</HI> erected a handsome monument to him in a neighboring church, more to shew his respect, than from any necessity of endeavouring to preserve the memory of one self-immortalized.</P>
<P>FROM the heirs of Sir <HI>Thomas Meautys,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR HARBOTTLE GRIMSTON.</NOTE> this place passed by sale to Sir <HI>Harbottle Grimston,</HI> Baronet; whose portrait is here at full length, in black, with a turnover and black coif, leaning on a slab. On the picture is this motto, <HI>Nec pudet vivere, nec piget mori.</HI> This gentleman was one of those worthy persons who set out with a view of reforming the abuses of the arbitrary court of <HI>Charles</HI> I. but whose moderation and good sense made them op∣pose their own party, when it attempted measures subversive of the constitution: in consequence, he, with several others, were excluded the house. In 1656, he was elected one of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s parlement; but not being approved by the slavish council of the usurper, was laid aside. He was active in promoting the Resto∣ration; was chosen speaker of the parlement; was rewarded with

This generous peer stepped forward in the cause of liberty, in the beginning of the troubles of <HI>Charles</HI> I. while he held the post of lord high admiral: a post he was displaced from by the popular party, by reason of his mo∣deration; which they suspected would be a check to their unrea∣sonable views. He was constantly a mediating commissioner in all treaties on the side of the parlement; in which he behaved with dignity, spirit, and integrity. He was appointed governor of the king's children while they were separated from him, and behaved to them with respect and affection. He joined with op∣posing the ordonnance for the trial of his master; and, after his death, retired to <HI>Petworth,</HI> and took no part with the usurping powers. He joined heartily in the Restoration; but, like a true friend to his country, wished for it on terms of security to the people, and advantage for the nation.

<P>THIS gentleman was comptroller at <HI>Calais,</HI> at the time it was taken by the duke <HI>de Guise</HI> in 1558. He had frequently wrote to the ministry, to inform them how ill provided it was against a siege.

He quitted <HI>England,</HI> for which, as lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> says, he had little other affection than as he had a great share in it, in which, like a great leviathan, he might sport himself. He was a man of a noble presence, and affected a plain garb. He accordingly is here dressed in a dark habit, robed with fur.

<HI>Buckingham</HI> was possessed of abilities, clouded by the violence of his passions, and almost rendered useless.

His imperious nature led him to give frequent offence; yet his timi∣dity obliged him to make humiliating concessions to the very people he had offended. He had a strange curiosity to learn what the persons injured said of him; the knowlege of which always brought on fresh troubles; as he would expostulate with them for their severe sayings, as if he had never given cause for them; by which he would often discover the mean informant of his fruitless intelligence.

In her diary, which is preserved in manuscript, I find she suffered even to poverty, and complains of her ill usage in a most suppliant and pathetic manner. Her lord felt heavy com∣punction on his death-bed. I cannot help relating two of the <HI>minutiae</HI> of her journal.

I SHALL conclude with a very singular portrait on wood, <NOTE PLACE="marg">PHILIP LE BON DUKE OF BURGUNDY.</NOTE> called <HI>Sylvester de Grimston,</HI> a noble <HI>Norman,</HI> standard-bearer to the Con∣queror at the battle of <HI>Hastings,</HI> and afterwards his chamberlain. He held lands in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> of the lord <HI>Roos;</HI> among others, that of <HI>Grimston</HI> in <HI>Holderness;</HI> from whence he took the name. The picture is antient and curious, but wants four centuries of the great period in which <HI>Sylvester</HI> lived; neither did that age afford any artists that could give even a tolerable representation of the human figure, much less convey down a likeness of the fierce heroes of their times. I premise this, to shew the impossibility of this portrait having been a copy of some original of this great ancestor. The dress is singular: a large bonnet, with a very long silken appendage; a green jacket, hanging sleeves: a collar of SS held in one hand: his face beardless. On the back of the picture is <HI>Petrus</HI> xoi. <HI>me fecit, anno</HI> 1416. The artist is unknown to me: but the habit of the person is that of the date; for I find in <HI>Monfaucon's Monarchie Francoise</HI> several persons of rank in the dress, particularly <HI>Philip Le Bon</HI> duke of <HI>Burgundy:</HI> between whom and this portrait, there is so strong a resemblance of fea∣ture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the book cited, vol. iii. p. 260. tab. xlix. fig. 2.</NOTE>, that I do not hesitate to imagine that the <HI>Gorhambury</HI> portrait is no other than one of this illustrious prince.

<P>I NOW resume my journey, and, in my way to St. <HI>Albans,</HI> about a mile and a half distant, pass by the site of St. <HI>Mary de la Pre, de Pratis,</HI> or the Meadows; an hospital for leprous women, founded

about 1190, by <HI>Warine,</HI> abbot of <HI>St. Alban's.</HI> It afterwards rose to a priory of <HI>Benedictine</HI> nuns; but fell in 1528, when <HI>Wolsey,</HI> commendatory abbot, obtained from <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. a bull for its suppression, and for annexing it to the abbey; after which he got a grant of it for himself from the king; who, on the ruin of the cardinal, gave it to Sir <HI>Ralph Rowlet</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 185.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after quitting this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VERULAMIUM.</NOTE> I entered the celebrated <HI>Verulamium,</HI> at a spot distinguished by a great fragment of the antient wall, known by the name of <HI>Gorhambury-block,</HI> which pro∣bably bounded one side of one of the <HI>portae,</HI> or entrances, being exactly opposite to that on the eastern part.

It inclines to an oval shape; is placed on a slope, and the lower side bounded by the river <HI>Ver,</HI> which in former times might have spread into a lake, and given greater security to the town.

It probably was at or near <HI>Coway Stakes. Cesar</HI> leaves us no room to depart from that opinion, as he expressly tells us that he led his army to the river <HI>Thames,</HI> towards the borders of the territories of <HI>Cassive∣launus,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Caesar cognito consilio eorum ad flumen <HI>Tama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in</HI> in finos <HI>Cassivelauni</HI> exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣citum duxit. <HI>Bel.

the golden-locked leader of the country of the <HI>Cassi:</HI> and these <HI>Cassi</HI> are reasonably supposed to have been a clan of the <HI>Cattieuchlani,</HI> and to have inhabited the hundred of this county now called <HI>Cashio,</HI> in which <HI>Verulamium</HI> stood. But I must con∣tend, that the distance of that city is far too remote from the fordable parts of the <HI>Thames,</HI> to admit it to have been the town of the <HI>British</HI> leader destroyed by the invader. It lies, in the nearest line, thirty-seven miles from those parts of the river: a distance too great for the time given to <HI>Cesar</HI> for his second cam∣paign in <HI>Britain.</HI> The town, or rather post, which was forced by him, was not remote from the camp occupied by him on the side of the river; and most likely was that which is still very entire, in the park of her Grace the dutchess dowager of <HI>Portland,</HI> at <HI>Bulstrode,</HI> about fifteen miles distance from the <HI>Roman</HI> camp; whose vestiges are still to be seen, not far from the famous ford<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sylves Paludibusque munitum.</HI></NOTE>. Partly by length of time, partly by constant cultivation, this post has lost some of the characters ascribed by <HI>Cesar</HI> to the town of <HI>Cassivelaunus;</HI> for it wants at present the marshy defence it had in his days.</P>
<P>THE town alluded to was within the territories of the <HI>British</HI> chieftain, and one of the strong holds into which the <HI>Britons</HI> were used to drive their cattle in time of danger. This, by <HI>Cesar</HI>'s ac∣count, was certainly not the most capital; for his first relation in∣forms

<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erulamium</HI> was the capital of this country, and the residence of its princes. I do not reckon <HI>Cassivelaunus</HI> among them; he was a chieftain of the <HI>Cassi,</HI> and, for his great abilities, elected general on the <HI>Roman</HI> invasion, if our <HI>British</HI> history is to be trusted. He was a guardian to his nephews, <HI>Anarwy</HI> and <HI>Tenafan</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stukely Itin.</HI> i. 117.</NOTE> (the last) father to <HI>Cunoboline,</HI> whose coins are so frequent. Here was one of the <HI>British</HI> mints; for we find the word <HI>Ver</HI> on the coins, but no prince's name to distinguish the reign.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Romans</HI> had effected their conquest, they added walls to the ordinary <HI>British</HI> defence of ramparts, and ditches. Many great fragments of the former still remain, proofs of the strength and manner of the <HI>Roman</HI> masonry. On the one side is a vast foss; on another, two. The walls are twelve feet thick, where entire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WALLS.</NOTE> formed of flints bedded in mortar, now grown into amazing hardness. By intervals of about three feet distance, are three, and in some places four, rows of broad and thin bricks, or tiles, which were continued the whole length of the walls, which seem designed as foundations to sustain the layers of flints and lime, while the last was in a moist state. There were, besides, round

holes, which penetrated quite through<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Doctor <HI>Stukely</HI>'s admirable plan of this place.</NOTE>; but these are either filled up, or escaped my notice. According to Doctor <HI>Stukely</HI>'s measurement, the area is five thousand two hundred feet in length, and the greatest breadth about three thousand. It is at present inclosed into fields; but under the hedges, in many places, are vestiges of buildings, and, as I am told, when it is under tillage, the sites of the streets appear, by the different color of the corn above them. The <HI>Watling-street</HI> comes to the <HI>Porta Decumana,</HI> the gate on the western side, and passes quite through the city. There is another road goes on the outside of the south side; a small military way, like that which passed from turret to turret on <HI>Severus</HI>'s wall<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour Scotl.</HI> 1772, part ii. p. 288.</NOTE>, for the conveni∣ency of external passengers.</P>
<P>THIS place, by its attachment to the conquerors, acquired the privileges of a free borough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A MUNICIPIUM</NOTE> a <HI>municipium,</HI> or municipal city, whose inhabitants enjoyed all the rights of the <HI>Roman</HI> citizens; for which reason such towns derive their name <HI>a muneribus capiendis,</HI> their power to bear public offices. They had their senators, knights, and commons; magistrates and priests; censors, ediles, questors, and flamens.</P>
<P>THE attachment of this town to its new masters, proved the cause of a heavy misfortune, which befel it under the reign of <HI>Nero. Boadicea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SACKED BY BOADICEA.</NOTE> widow of <HI>Prasutagus,</HI> king of the <HI>Iceni,</HI> enraged at the cruel indignity offered to her and her daughters, raised an insurrection against the <HI>Romans</HI> and their friends, and repaid with
<PB N="253" REF="281"/>
the most dreadful cruelties the injuries they had received. <HI>Camo∣lodunum, Londinium,</HI> and <HI>Verolamium,</HI> suffered from the fury of the <HI>Britons;</HI> and seventy thousand citizens and allies fell by the edge of the sword. This city was remarkable for its wealth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Taciti Annal.</HI> lib. xiv. c. 31, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>; which was another incentive for the <HI>Britons</HI> to attack it, added to a particular animosity against a people who had forsaken the cus∣toms and religion of their ancestors.</P>
<P>THE place in a short time emerged from its misfortune; and had the honor of producing <HI>Albanus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">OF ST. ALBANUS.</NOTE> the proto-martyr of <HI>Britain,</HI> a wealthy citizen of <HI>Verulamium,</HI> and, by privilege, of <HI>Rome</HI> also. He had been a <HI>Pagan,</HI> but was converted by means of a guest, whom he had sheltered during the great persecution of <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> as I have before related. St. <HI>Alban</HI> suffered in the year 302. Let not legend destroy the credibility of the martyrdom, by assigning attendant miracles, long after their cessation. We are told, that after he had refused to sacrifice to the heathen gods, the usual test of the alleged crime of Christianity, he was, as customary, whipped with rods, and then led to execution, and beheaded on <HI>Holmhurst,</HI> where the town of <HI>St. Alban's</HI> at present stands. In his passage, the torrent, which then divided the place from <HI>Ve∣rulamium,</HI> like the Red-sea, divided its waters, and gave dry passage to the Saint and his followers: a fountain sprung up where the martyr kneeled: one of the executioners relenting, was con∣verted, and suffered with <HI>Albanus;</HI> another, who performed the deed, lost his eyes, as a penalty for his cruelty; for they dropped out of his head in the moment in which he gave the blow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bede Hist.

<PB N="254" REF="282"/>
St. <HI>Alban</HI> was interred on the spot; and his remains were mira∣culously discovered several centuries after their interment.</P>
<P>IN 429, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SYNOD HOLD HERE.</NOTE> this place was honored with a synod, in which St. <HI>Germanus</HI> and <HI>Lupus,</HI> two <HI>French</HI> prelates, assisted. A chapel was erected, about the year 945, by abbot <HI>Ulsin,</HI> in honor of the former, on the spot in which he preached; whose ruins were to be seen the beginning of this century.</P>
<P>AFTER the <HI>Saxon</HI> invasion, the name of the town was changed for that of <HI>Verlamcester</HI> and <HI>Watlincester.</HI> The <HI>British</HI> hero, <HI>Uther Pendragon,</HI> after a long siege, wrested it out of the hands of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and held it during his life; after which they soon reco∣vered it; but by reason of the cruel wars that raged during the contest between them and the <HI>Britons,</HI> the place became totally desolated.</P>
<P>LIKE the antient <HI>Deva <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> p. 108.</NOTE>, Verulamium</HI> had its great vaults, <NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT VAULTS.</NOTE> or subterraneous retreats, strongly and artfully arched. These are supposed, by Sir <HI>Henry Chauncy,</HI> to have been designed as places of retreat in time of war for the women and children, and for the concealing of the most valuable effects. In 960, they were found to give shelter to thieves and prostitutes; which caused <HI>Eldred,</HI> the eighth abbot, to search after these sousterrains, and found se∣veral ways and passages; all which he caused to be destroyed, but preserved the tiles and stones for the rebuilding the church, then in ruins<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chauncy,</HI> 431.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE present <HI>St. Alban's</HI> arose from the ruins of <HI>Verulamium. Offa</HI> king of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> directed, says legend, by a vision from

heaven, discovered the reliques of St. <HI>Alban,</HI> by beams of glory springing from the grave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cressy,</HI> lib. xxv. c. 6.</NOTE>. In 793, he erected on the spot the magnificent monastery, for the maintenance of a hundred <HI>Benedic∣tine</HI> or black monks, and in a parlementary council, which he held in the same year, bestowed on it most liberal endowments. <HI>Verulamium</HI> was now reduced to the state elegantly described by <HI>Spencer,</HI> assuming the character of the Genius of the place.

<P>ON ascending into St. <HI>Alban's,</HI> up <HI>Fishpool-street,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FISHPOOL.</NOTE> the bottom on the right reminded me of the great pool which once occupied that tract.

Anchors have been found on the spot; which occasioned poets to fable that the <HI>Thames</HI> once ran this way. One of them, speaking to the <HI>Ver,</HI> says,

But <HI>Offa</HI> did not trust to this solely: he made a penitential pilgrimage to <HI>Rome,</HI> and, by the merit of his monastic institution at <HI>St. Alban's,</HI> readily obtained absolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS GREAT PRIVILEGE.</NOTE> and not only procured for the house exemption from the tax of <HI>Peter-pence,</HI> but power to collect the same for its own use, through the whole province of <HI>Hertford:</HI> a privilege which no per∣son in the realm, the king himself not excepted, ever enjoyed. By the same bull, his holiness granted, that the abbot, or monk, whom he appointed archdeacon, should have pontifical jurisdiction over the priests and laymen of the possessions of this church; and that no person whatsoever, save the Pope himself, should offer to inter∣fere. It was, by the charter of the king, to be free from all taxes, repair of bridges and castles, and free from making entrenchments against an enemy; to be exempt from episcopal jurisdiction; and that the fines for crimes, which belonged to the king, should be given for ever to this monastery. <HI>Offa,</HI> not content with this, inclosed the body of the Saint in a shrine of beaten gold and sil∣ver,

<P>THE abbots lived in splendor, suitable to their rank and reve∣nues. They dined in the great hall, at a table to which there was a flight of fifteen steps. The monks served up the dinner in plate, and in their way made a halt at every fifth step, where there was a landing, and sung on each a short hymn. The abbot usually sat alone in the middle of the table; and when any per∣sons of rank came, he sat towards the end of the table. After the monks had waited some time on the abbot, they sat down at two other tables, placed on the sides of the hall, and had their ser∣vices brought in by the novices; who, when the monks had dined, sat down to their own dinners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antiquarian Repertory,</HI> iii. 60.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE church, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> in its present state, is a most venerable and great pile: its form that of a cross, with a tower. At the intersection the length is six hundred feet; that of the transepts one hundred and eighty. The height of the tower one hundred and forty-four feet; that of the body sixty-five; of the ailes thirty; the breadth of the body two hundred and seventeen.</P>
<P>BY neglect, <NOTE PLACE="marg">RUINED.</NOTE> or by the ravages of war, the original church fell to decay. Abbot <HI>Ealdred,</HI> who lived in 969, designed to pull down and rebuild it; and for that purpose collected, from the ruins of <HI>Verulamium,</HI> all the stone, tiles, and timber, he could find. Death put a stop to his intention. His successor, <HI>Eadmer,</HI> re∣sumed the task of getting together the materials; and in his
<PB N="261" REF="289"/>
search, found great quantities of curious antiquities; such as altars, urns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which the pious man broke to pieces, as hea∣then abominations. He also, as is said, discovered several books, some in <HI>British,</HI> others in <HI>Latin;</HI> and a great one in a language and character unknown to any but an old priest. This was found to be the authentic life of St. <HI>Alban;</HI> which was carefully trea∣sured up, being a confirmation of what <HI>Bede</HI> had wrote on the same subject. The other books, being only accounts of heathen mythology, inventions of the devil, were instantly condemned to the flames<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stevens,</HI> i. 237.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A FAMINE stopped the design of the new church, under the abbot <HI>Leofric.</HI> The troubles that ensued, under the remaining <HI>Saxon</HI> monarchs, and the unsettled state of the kingdom at the Conquest, occasioned the plan to lie dormant till the year 1077, when it was executed by abbot <HI>Paul,</HI> a <HI>Norman</HI> monk. He ap∣plied to that purpose the timber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AND REBUILT.</NOTE> the stones, and tiles, collected by his predecessors<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ex lapidibus et tegulis veleris civitatis <HI>Verolamii</HI> et materie lignea quam in∣venit a praedecessoribus suis collectam et reservatam. <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> 1001.</NOTE>: accordingly we see the far greater and more antient part of the walls a motley composition of stones and <HI>Roman</HI> tiles.</P>
<P>MANY other parts afterwards were pulled down, <NOTE PLACE="marg">ALTERATIONS.</NOTE> and rebuilt in the stile of the times; and I suspect that, in general, the pre∣sent windows are long posterior to those coeval with the walls; being painted, and of a taste of another age. The windows in the great tower, and perhaps the range along the nave, are of time intervening; for they differ from the mode of each of the
<PB N="262" REF="290"/>
others. I find this confirmed in the lives of the abbots. <HI>John</HI> (first of the name) who died in 1214, pulled down the front∣wall, which was built of old tiles, so strongly cemented with mor∣tar, that it proved a work of great labor. Master <HI>Hugh Goldcliff,</HI> a most excellent workman, was employed; who, consulting more the ornaments of sculpture, of images and flowers, neglected the security of his building; so that it fell down, and was left un∣finished during the life of this good abbot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> 1047.</NOTE>. His successor, <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> of <HI>Trampington,</HI> had the honor of completing his design. He not only rebuilt that front, but made new windows, and put glass into them, so as to give more light to the church. He also raised the steeple much higher, covered it with lead, and died full of good works, in 1235 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 1054, 1063.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the abbacy of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Whethamstead,</HI> this church received the most considerable alterations. To avoid prolixity, I omit the nu∣merous works of that most munificent abbot: I shall only note the change he made in the exterior part, by enlarging and glazing the windows on the north side of the church, which was before dark, and by causing a large window to be made at the west end of the north a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, which was as destitute of light as the other part<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stevens,</HI> i. 262.</NOTE>. <HI>John</HI> died in 1464; before which time the narrow win∣dows had been changed for those more expanded, lightsome, and less painted.</P>
<P>IT is in the inside only that any part of the original building, <NOTE PLACE="marg">PART STILL SAXON.</NOTE> or the genuine <HI>Saxon</HI> architecture, is preserved; which is to be seen in the round arches which support the tower, and some of

<P>ON the south side of the chapel of St. <HI>Alban</HI> is the magnificent tomb<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Finely engraven in <HI>Sandford's Genealogical History,</HI> p. 318.</NOTE> of <HI>Humphry</HI> duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMB OF HUMPHRY DUKE OF GLOCESTER.</NOTE> distinguished by the name of <HI>The Good.</HI> He was uncle to <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and regent of the king∣dom, under his weak nephew, during twenty-five years. His many eminent qualities gained him the love of the people; his popularity, the hatred of the queen and her favorites. His life was found to be incompatible to their views. They first effected the ruin of his dutchess by a ridiculous charge of witchcraft, and after that, brought as groundless a charge of treason against him∣self. He was conveyed to St. <HI>Edmund's Bury,</HI> where a parlement was convened in 1446; before which the accusation was to be made. His enemies, fearing the public execution of so great and so beloved a character, caused him to be stifled in his bed, and then pretended that he died of vexation at his sudden fall. His body was interred in this church, the scene of his detection of the pre∣tended miracle of the blind restored to sight at the virtuous shrine of St. <HI>Alban.

<P>THIS beautiful tomb was once insulated, as appears by one of these <HI>items.</HI> In the middle is a pervious arch, adorned above with the coat of arms of the deceased; and others again along a freeze; with his supporters, two antelopes with collars. From the freeze arises a light elegant tabernacle-work, with niches; containing on one side the effigies of our princes; the other side is despoiled of the figures.</P>
<P>IN 1703, the vault in which reposed the remains of this illus∣trious personage was discovered. The body was preserved in a

leaden coffin, in a strong pickle; and over that was another case, of wood, now perished. Against the wall is painted a Crucifixion, with four chalices receiving the blood; a hand pointing towards it, with a label, inscribed <HI>Lord have mercy upon me.</HI></P>
<P>THE epitaph has long since been defaced; but was as follows:

<P>ABBOT <HI>Whethamsted</HI>'s, <NOTE PLACE="marg">WHETHAMSTED'S CHAPEEL.</NOTE> tomb (or <HI>Johannes de loco frumentario,</HI> as he stiled himself) is covered by a small chapel, erected by him∣self. It is a plain building, on the south side of the choir. His arms, allusive to his name, are three ears of wheat; and the motto, allusive to the flourishing state of the monastery under his government, is <HI>Valles abundabunt,</HI> twice repeated. <HI>Weever,</HI> from p. 562 to 567, enumerates all his munificent works. He had a great turn towards ornamental generosity; and caused this church, the Lady's chapel, and several parts of the house, to be adorned with historical paintings, and inscriptions of his own composition to be placed under them. He also was a great
<PB N="269" REF="300"/>
composer of epitaphs. The reader will accept, as a specimen of the first, a distich placed in our Lady's chapel:
<Q><L>Dulce pluit manna, partum dum protulit <HI>Anna,</HI></L>

<P>His artist was <HI>Alan Strayler,</HI> painter; <NOTE PLACE="marg">STRAYLER, THE PAINTER.</NOTE> who is said to have been so well paid for his work, that he forgave the convent three shil∣lings and four pence of an old debt, for colors; and on that ac∣count was probably complimented with the following epitaph:

<L>Qui sine fine choris celestibus associetur<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Idem, 578.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>I BELIEVE, some of his labors are yet extant in the roof of the choir; on which is painted, in compartments, an Eagle and a Lamb. Under others, in our Lady's chapel, was this line:
<Q>Inter oves Aries, ut sine cornubus Agnus.</Q>
<PB N="270" REF="301"/>
under the other,
<Q>Inter aves aquila veluti fine felle columba.</Q></P>
<P>IN the middle of the cieling of the north aile, is a painting of the martyrdom of St. <HI>Alban,</HI> (as is said) over the very spot on which he suffered. There is, besides, a rude sculpture of his death in a small aile on the back of his chapel, expressing the manner how the executioner lost his eyes for his impiety.</P>
<P>IN the center of another cieling, is a rude painting of king <HI>Offa;</HI> and this inscription beneath:
<Q><L>Fundator ecclesiae circa annum 793</L>
<L>Quem malé depictum, et residentem cernitis altè</L>
<L>Sublimem solio <HI>Mercius Offa</HI> fuit.</L></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BRASS MONUMENTS.</NOTE> IN the choir are some fine brasses of mitred abbots. That of <HI>Thomas de la More,</HI> a most munificent and pious man, <NOTE PLACE="marg">ABBOT THOMAS.</NOTE> who died in 1396, is very richly engraved. His figure lies in the center, surrounded by the twelve Apostles in miniature: a proof that this art was arrived at great perfection at so early a period.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit the modest epitaph of an antient abbot.

<P>ON a large brass plate is engraven the figure of a warrior. <NOTE PLACE="marg">HEIR OF EDMUND EARL OF KENT.</NOTE> Fragments of the inscription are given by Mr. <HI>Salmon;</HI> which in∣form us, that it was in memory of the son and heir to <HI>Edmonde</HI> erle of <HI>Kent.</HI> The date 1480. The historian says, that he was

killed in the second battle of <HI>St. Alban's.</HI> This must be a mis∣take; for none of the name of that family fell on that day, except Sir <HI>John Grey</HI> of <HI>Groby.</HI> This must therefore have been a <HI>ceno∣taph</HI> in honor of <HI>Anthony Grey,</HI> eldest son of <HI>Edmund</HI> earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> buried at <HI>Luton,</HI> who died before his father<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vincent's Discoverie,</HI> &amp;c. 287.</NOTE>; the earl dying in 1489: which might bring the son's death to the date on the brass.</P>

<P>A LONG inscription<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This, and many others, are nearly defaced with white; but may be seen in <HI>Weever.</HI> 567.</NOTE> against a column, on the north side of the body of the church, clames the honor of having the body of the celebrated Sir <HI>John Mandeville</HI> interred beneath. We admit that this place gave him birth; <NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR JOHN MANDEVILLE.</NOTE> but he found a grave at <HI>Liege,</HI> in the convent of the <HI>Gulielmites,</HI> in 1371. He was the greatest traveller of his or any other age; having been out thirty-four years; and in the character of pilgrim, knight-errant, and man of observation, visited the greatest parts of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> then known. It is probable that he penetrated as far as <HI>China.</HI> He left an account of his travels, which were shamefully falsified by the monks; who destroyed much of their credit, by mingling with them legendary tales, and stories out of <HI>Pliny:</HI> but still truth appears so frequently, that the authenticity of the ground∣work is by no means impaired. He was called <HI>Johannes de Man∣devile,</HI>

<P>THE magnificent brazen font, <NOTE PLACE="marg">FONT.</NOTE> brought from the plunder of <HI>Leith</HI> by Sir <HI>Richard Lee,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was again stolen in the civil wars.

<P>THE last inscription I shall mention, is that in memory of two hermits, now almost defaced, inscribed near a benetoire, by the door in the south aile leading into the cloisters.

<P>THE door adjacent is extremely beautiful; rich in sculpture. The cloisters lay on the other side. Nothing but the marks of their junction with the outside of the church now remains; a se∣ries of tripartite arches: nor is there the lest relique of the vast and magnificent buildings, which once covered a large space on this side.</P>
<P>ADJOINING to the east end of the church is the chapel of St. <HI>Mary,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPEL OF SAINT MARY.</NOTE> supported by light and elegant pillars. The roof is of stone; the sides of the windows ornamented with a fine running foliage; and little images adorn the pillars of each widow. The stair-case from hence to the leads has a beautiful imitation of cordage cut in stone, following the spiral windings. All the arches are of the sharp-pointed gothic.</P>
<P>I CANNOT trace the founder of this elegant building. It was prior to the days of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Whethamsted;</HI> for he caused<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Weever,</HI> 562.</NOTE> <Q>our Lady's chapel to be new trimmed, and curiously depicted with stories out of the Sacred Word; and caused some verses (be∣fore quoted by me) to be curiously depensed in gold.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Edmund Beaufort</HI> duke of <HI>Somerset, Henry Percy</HI> earl of <HI>North∣umberland, John</HI> lord <HI>Clifford,</HI> and others of the nobility and gen∣try, to the amount of forty-seven, slain in the first battle of <HI>St. Alban's,</HI> were interred in this chapel.</P>

<PB N="274" REF="305"/>
of the abbey, now a vicarage in the patronage of the bi∣shop of <HI>Ely.</HI> This church received the overflowings of the bodies of the men of rank slain in the same battle. There is still a perfect brass of Sir <HI>John Entwysle,</HI> in complete armor. He was born in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and was viscount and baron of <HI>Brikbeke</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI> He died on <HI>May</HI> 28th, 1455, of the wounds he received on fight∣ing in the cause of <HI>Henry.</HI></P>
<P>THE two <HI>Ralph Babthorps</HI> of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> father and son (the one sewer, the other squire to that unfortunate prince) found their graves here; slain in the same cause.</P>
<P>ON a stone is this inscription: <HI>Edithe le Vineter gist: ici: Dieu: de: sa: alme: eie: merci.</HI></P>
<P>A LARGE marble monument, with a bust, commemorates the reward of ingenuity and honest industry. <Q>Beneath, lie the remains of <HI>Edward Strong,</HI> a shepherd's boy near this town, who took to masonry, worked at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s cathedral, and laid the last stone. He acquired a good fortune, with a fair character, and died aged 72, in 1723.</Q></P>
<P>AT the bottom of the town is a small brick house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Treasurer <HI>Godolphin</HI> died in that house.</NOTE>, <NOTE PLACE="marg">HOLYWELL HOUSE.</NOTE> called <HI>Holywell;</HI> once the residence of <HI>Sarah</HI> dutchess of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> Her portrait, in white, exquisitely handsome, is preserved here; as is that of her aged mother, Mrs. <HI>Jennings.</HI> In the first, are not the lest vestiges of her diabolical passions, the torments of her queen, her husband, and herself.</P>
<P>TWO little pictures in this house are so charmingly finished, as to merit a visit. One is of a beautiful woman, with red hair
<PB N="275" REF="306"/>
parted in the middle; a close cap, placed far behind; with a long black coif, edged with pearl.</P>
<P>SHE is dressed in a scarlet gown, with sleeves and mantle of purple: breasts and shoulders naked. She appears a deep de∣votee, reading a rich illuminated missal, seated in a chair. Her middle is surrounded with a chain, a rosary of gold and colored beads pendent from it. On a table, behind, is a chalice of gold, set with pearls.</P>
<P>THE other is a head of an old man, in a black gown; his beard grey and square, finely finished.</P>
<P>THE town of <HI>St. Alban's</HI> is large, and, in general, <NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWN.</NOTE> filled with antient buildings. It originally sprung from a few houses built by king <HI>Offa,</HI> for the conveniency of the officers and servants of the monastery. About the year 950, it was so increased, that king <HI>Ethelred,</HI> at the intercession of abbot <HI>Ulfin,</HI> gave it a grant of a market, and the rank of a borough. In the <HI>Doomsday Book,</HI> it appears at the Conquest to have been rated for ten hides. The <Q>arable was sixteen ploughlands. In demesne, three hides, two ploughlands, and another may be made. There were four aliens, sixteen villeyns, and thirteen boors, having thirteen ploughlands: forty-six burgesses: the toll, and other rents of the town, eleven pounds fourteen shillings a year: three mills, forty shillings a year: meadow, two ploughlands in quantity: wood to feed a thousand hogs in pannage-time: and seven shillings rent. The total twenty pounds at that time; in that of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, twenty-four. There are now twelve cottagers, a park of deer, and a fish-pond.</Q></P>
<P>THE town was always considered as part of the demesne of the abbey; and at the Conquest it was part of its possessions.
<PB N="276" REF="307"/>
<HI>Richard</HI> I. by charter, confirmed it to them, with a market, and all the liberty attending a borough: the abbot holding, as he al∣leged, of the king <HI>in capite,</HI> and holding the burgesses as de∣mesned men of the abbey. This tenure the burgesses wished to force from him; which they attempted by the following stratagem: —In the thirty-fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> I. they had sent representatives to parlement, and also in the first and second of <HI>Edward</HI> II; but in the fifth of the same reign, the sheriff of <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> by the con∣trivance of the abbot, to save the expence, had omitted the usual summons. This the burgesses complained of, asserting that they held of the king; hoping thereby to get released of the services they owed their lord abbot: or, if they succeeded in sending members, to be freed of those which they owed the king. Both of which expectations, in the opinion of Mr. <HI>Madox,</HI> were ill∣founded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antiquities of the Exchequer,</HI> i. 760.</NOTE>. Burgesses were returned to parlement the fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> II. and in the second, fourth, and fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> III; after which the load, or the privilege, as it was respectively thought by the disputants, ceased. At the time of the dissolu∣tion, the town, with the other possessions of the abbey, fell to the king <HI>(Henry</HI> VIII.) and from him to his heir, <HI>Edward</HI> VI; who, by letters patent, dated <HI>May</HI> 12th, 1553, <NOTE PLACE="marg">INCORPARATED</NOTE> made the town of <HI>St. Alban's</HI> a body corporate, by the name of the mayor and bur∣gesses, and granted to the said mayor and burgesses, and their successors, the said profits, and other franchises; they to hold the premises in free burgage, and to render yearly to the crown XL. as a fee-farm, at the feast of St. <HI>Michael</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Madox,</HI> i. 762.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="308"/>
THESE were changed, by <HI>Charles</HI> II. into a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four assistants. The members are returned by the inhabitants and freemen (about a thousand in number) and the returning-officer is the mayor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis Notit. Parl.</HI> iii. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE remarkable events, which befel this town in earlier times, were, as usual, of the sanguinary kind. During the rage of the barons wars, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. the burgesses fortified the place, and defended it with strong gates, well secured. They were particularly jealous of horsemen; therefore refused passage to all cavaliers. The constable of <HI>Hertford,</HI> displeased at this prohibition, in a bravado, boasted that he would enter the town with three youths (knights) and four of his best villeins. He did so; and, walking up and down with great insolence, asked his companions which way the wind was. The townsmen, alarmed at the question, thought he designed to fire their houses. In a sum∣mary way they executed justice, by knocking down and beheading him, his youths, and villeins; placing their heads on poles, at the corners of their streets. The king resented this invasion of his prerogative, and fined the town in a hundred marks; which was immediately paid<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chauney,</HI> 442.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II. they underwent a mortification of a far heavier nature. In 1381, after the bloody insurrection of <HI>Wat Tyler,</HI> a court of justice was held here, by the famous Sir <HI>Robert Tresilian. John Ball,</HI> a priest of <HI>Coventry,</HI> was tried and executed. Several of the inhabitants had favored the rebels, or, taking advantage of the turbulence of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mes, had de∣manded
<PB N="278" REF="309"/>
from the abbot a release from all their services. Several of them were condemned and put to death, and orders given, that their bodies should remain on the gallows <HI>in terrorem.</HI> The bur∣gesses, in contempt of the king, took them down; but when a discovery was made, <HI>Richard,</HI> in a rage, commanded the towns∣men to make chains, and hang the putrid carcases on the same places they took them from; which, disgusting and horrible as the task was, they were obliged to perform<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Holinshed,</HI> 438.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the civil wars between the houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRST BATTLE AT ST. ALBAN'S.</NOTE> this town was the scene of dreadful carnage. Here was shed the first blood in that fatal quarrel. As soon as ever the weak <HI>Henry,</HI> or rather his queen and ministers, found themselves free from the power of his rival the duke of <HI>York,</HI> they armed their forces, and marched from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s to meet their enemy, who was advancing towards them with a mighty host. They met on the 22d of <HI>May,</HI> 1455. The peaceful prince sent out a herald to <HI>York,</HI> strictly commanding him to keep the peace as became a dutiful subject, and to avoid effusion of blood. <HI>York</HI>'s answer was humble, yet resolute; demanding the duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> and other delinquents, to be delivered into his hands, that justice might be executed on them, for the miseries they had brought on the realm. <HI>Somerset,</HI> who had been regent of <HI>France,</HI> was charged in particular with the loss of <HI>Normandy.</HI> The king determined to stand the event of the day, rather than give up his friends. His banner was placed in St. <HI>Peter's street.</HI> Orders were issued by <HI>Henry</HI> (but most probably by the bloody <HI>Margaret</HI>) that no quar∣ter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow,</HI> 399.</NOTE>
<PB N="279" REF="310"/>
should be given to his opponents. The <HI>Yorkists</HI> began the attack in three places. The famous <HI>John</HI> lord <HI>Clifford</HI> defended the barriers with his accustomed valour. The king-making <HI>Warwick,</HI> who at this time espoused the cause of <HI>York,</HI> collected his force, and broke in through the gardens into <HI>Holywell-street</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow,</HI> 399.</NOTE>: his soldiers shouted his tremendous name. The duke of <HI>York</HI> entered at the same time, and a dreadful fight ensued. Victory declared in his favor. Numbers of the nobility and gentry, with about eight hundred common men, fell on the side of <HI>Henry:</HI> the valiant <HI>Clifford,</HI> usually called <HI>The Old,</HI> though only forty years of age; the earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> son to the noted <HI>Hotspur;</HI> and the great duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> were slain. The last lost his life be∣neath the sign of the <HI>Castle,</HI> to fulfil the prophecy thus delivered by <HI>Shakespeare:</HI>
<Q><L>Let him shun castles.</L>
<L>Safer shall he be on the sandy plains,</L>
<L>Than where castles mounted stand<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> VI. part ii. act 1. <HI>Hulle's Chronicle,</HI> lxxxvi.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>Numbers of the nobility were wounded, and numbers fled till the fury of the battle was over. None were executed by the vic∣tor: the barbarity of civil feuds had not yet taken place, pro∣voked by the reciprocal cruelties which speedily followed.</P>
<P><HI>Henry,</HI> wounded in the neck by an arrow, which hurtled in showers on him, retreated to a poor cottage, where he was found by the conquerors. They asked forgiveness on their knees; which the humane prince readily gave, on condition they would stop
<PB N="280" REF="311"/>
the carnage. He became their prisoner, and they of course be∣came governors of the kingdom. The abbey escaped plunder; for fortunately the king did not make it his head-quarters.</P>
<P>THE king, from this time to the year 1461, remained a mere shadow of royalty, entirely under the directions of the <HI>Yorkists,</HI> His queen was driven from him, under the terror of a proscription. That spirited woman did not employ her time in prayers, or counting her beads, like her weak husband; but, by the assistance of her northern friends, raised a potent army, fought and slew the duke of <HI>York</HI> at the battle of <HI>Wakefield,</HI> on <HI>December</HI> 30th, 1460; and, marching towards <HI>London,</HI> gave occasion to a second battle at <HI>St. Alban's.</HI></P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECOND BATTLE AT ST. ALBAN'S.</NOTE> now in possession of the king, hastened from <HI>London</HI> with the captive monarch, and took post in <HI>St. Alban's. Margaret,</HI> attempting to pass through the town, was re∣pulsed by a storm of arrows, directed from the market-place; but she quickly forced her way through a lane into St. <HI>Peter's street.</HI> The conflict became then very bloody; and, after great slaughter, both parties quitted the town, and continued the battle, with the animosity usual in civil feuds, on <HI>Bernard Heath,</HI> north of <HI>St. Alban's,</HI> as far as the village of <HI>Sauntbridge,</HI> and even beyond it, at a place called <HI>No Man's Land</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow,</HI> 413.</NOTE>. There a <HI>corps de reserve</HI> of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s army, to the number of four or five thousand, made so vigorous an onset on the <HI>Lancastrians,</HI> as to render the victory for some time doubtful. At length the treachery or cowardice of a captain <HI>Lovelace,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Kentishmen,</HI> determined the
<PB N="281" REF="312"/>
day: he quitted the field, and left a complete victory to the queen. The confederated lords fled, and left the king in com∣pany of Lord <HI>Bonvil</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Kiriel,</HI> a gallant knight of <HI>Kent,</HI> both <HI>Yorkists.</HI> These gentlemen <HI>Henry</HI> had prevaled on to stay with him, assuring them of pardon and security; but his barbarous queen, in contempt of the royal word, and in defiance of all good faith, caused them to be beheaded in presence of her son <HI>Edward</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Halle,</HI> p. c.</NOTE>, as it were to familiarize the young prince with blood, and train him to cruelty.</P>
<P>THREE-AND-TWENTY hundred men perished in this battle. Only one man of rank was slain, Sir <HI>John Grey</HI> of <HI>Groby;</HI> who had that morning, with twelve others, been knighted by the king at <HI>Colney.</HI> His widow became queen to <HI>Edward</HI> IV. and occasioned fresh calamities to the kingdom; and proved the in∣nocent cause of the destruction of her kindred.</P>
<P>ON quitting <HI>St. Alban's,</HI> I passed by the long wall which in∣closed the nunnery of <HI>Sopewell,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SOPEWELL.</NOTE> made of stone mixed with great quantities of <HI>Roman</HI> tiles. The religious house took its rise from two pious women, who on the site built a hovel with boughs of trees, and covered it with bark, in order to indulge in privacy their fondness for prayer and fasting. Abbot <HI>Jeffry,</HI> about the year 1140, encouraged their virtue, by founding a nunnery of <HI>Benedictines.</HI></P>
<P>IN this house <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was privately married, by Doctor <HI>Rowland Lee,</HI> afterwards bishop of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> to <HI>Anna Bullein.</HI> It maintained thirteen nuns: on the dissolution, only nine; when

<P>THE great earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> resentful of the injuries he had re∣ceived of that prince, deposed him from the throne he had enabled him to mount. So popular was the character of this po∣tent baron, that a numerous army flew to his standard: every one was proud of bearing his cognisance, the bear and ragged staff, in his cap: some of gold, enamelled; others of silver; and those who could not afford the precious metals, cut them out of white silk, or cloth. When he visited <HI>London</HI> in peaceful times, he came attended by six hundred men, in red jackets, embroidered
<PB N="283" REF="314"/>
with ragged staves before and behind. He kept house at his pa∣lace in <HI>Warwick-Lane.</HI> Six oxen were consumed at every break∣fast; and every tavern was full of his meat; and every guest was allowed to carry off as much, roasted or boiled, as he could bear upon his long dagger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow's Hist. London,</HI> edit. 1611, p. 130.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Edward,</HI> on his return to <HI>England,</HI> was joyfully received in <HI>London.</HI> Hearing that <HI>Warwick</HI> was on his march towards the capital, he hastened to meet him, and posted himself at <HI>Barnet.</HI> So bad was the intelligence in those days, that <HI>Edward</HI> advanced in the night so near to <HI>Warwick</HI>'s camp, that the earl, unapprized of his vicinity, kept firing his ordnance over that of the king the greatest part of the night, without the lest execution. On the morning, being that of <HI>Easter-day, April</HI> 14th 1471, both the lead∣ers placed their armies in order. <HI>Warwick</HI> wore as his cognisance an ostrich's feather <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 422.</NOTE>, the badge of <HI>Edward,</HI> the son of king <HI>Henry:</HI> his friend <HI>Vere</HI> earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> a star; the fatal cause of the loss of the day. <HI>Edward</HI> wore a sun; from a fancy, that before the bat∣tle of <HI>Mortimer's Cross,</HI> he saw three distinct suns at last unite in one <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hollinshed,</HI> 660. <HI>Shakespeare, Henry</HI> VI. part iii. act 2.</NOTE>. The battle began at four in the morning, which opened in a thick mist, with that deadly hate which the long series of civil wars had created. The battle raged with various success, as might be expected from the undaunted courage and animosity of the leaders, and from the reflection on the certain destruction consequential of defeat. They fought obscured in fog till ten o'clock: victory seemed to incline to <HI>Warwick;</HI> when his people, mistaking the stars in the helms of <HI>Oxford</HI>'s soldiers, for the suns of
<PB N="284" REF="315"/>
<HI>Edward</HI>'s party, charged their own friends; who, crying Treason! Treason! fled with eight hundred men. The mar∣quis of <HI>Montacute,</HI> with the fickleness usual in those times, had privily agreed with <HI>Edward</HI> to desert his brother <HI>War∣wick,</HI> and had changed his livery. This was discovered by some of the earl's men; who instantly put him to death: a fit reward of fraternal perfidy! <HI>Warwick,</HI> seeing his brother slain, <HI>Oxford</HI> fled, and the fortune of the day turned against him, leaped on a horse, in hopes of escaping; but coming to an im∣passable wood, was there killed, and stripped naked; and, after being exposed, with the body of <HI>Montacute,</HI> for three or four days, in the church of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, was interred in the abbey of <HI>Bisham</HI> in <HI>Berkshire,</HI> founded by the <HI>Montacutes,</HI> his maternal ancestors. About four thousand were slain on both sides; who were interred for the most part on the spot. <HI>Edward</HI> built here a chapel, and, according to the custom of the times, appointed a priest to say mass for the souls of the deceased. This place, in the days of <HI>Stow</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Annals,</HI> 423.</NOTE>, was converted into a dwelling-house.

<HI>John Pennant;</HI> who, during forty years, was the worthy minister of the place.

The present church is built with flints. Over the west door is the date 1498, and the sculpture of a rose and a wing. The same is found under the upper window of <HI>Enfield,</HI> and on a gateway opposite to the <HI>Curtain</HI> in <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> once belonging to the <HI>Benedictine</HI> nunnery of <HI>Haliwell.</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Lovel,</HI> who lived at the period in which this church was built, was a great benefactor to the nunnery, and had his residence at <HI>En∣field.</HI> Whether he contributed to the building of <HI>Hadley,</HI> does not appear; otherwise it would seem to have been a badge of his: but others have conjectured it to have been a rebus, expres∣sive of the name of an architect, <HI>Rosewing.</HI></P>
<P>ON the top of the steeple there remains an iron pitch-pot, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BEACON.</NOTE> de∣signed as a beacon, occasionally to be fired, to alarm the country in case of invasion.

<P>ABOUT two miles from <HI>Northampton,</HI> I passed through the vil∣lage of <HI>Upton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">UPTON.</NOTE> and by <HI>Upton-hall,</HI> the seat of Sir <HI>Thomas Samwell,</HI> Baronet, and property of his ancestors since the year 1600; when it was purchased from Sir <HI>Richard Knightley</HI> by <HI>William Samwell,</HI> Esquire, a gentleman of antient <HI>Cornish</HI> descent.</P>
<P>AFTER a short space, I crossed the northern water, or <HI>Naesby∣head,</HI> a river that rises due north, and by its junction a little be∣low with another stream, which flows from <HI>Fawsley-pools,</HI> forms that which receives at <HI>Northampton</HI> the name of <HI>Nen.

I ENTERED this beautiful town at the west gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NORTHAMPTON.</NOTE> and passed be∣neath the site of the castle. Nothing, excepting an outer wall and foss, remains; in part of which is a vast stratum of ferru∣ginous <HI>geodes.</HI></P>
<P>OPPOSITE to the castle is a great mount,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> once the foundation of some more antient fortress; perhaps one of the line of forts which crossed this and the neighboring counties. One exists at <HI>Toucester,</HI> and another I shall have occasion to speak of, lying about three miles to the east. I cannot speak with certainty of the period in which it was occupied by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who gave it the name of <HI>Hamtune.</HI> Mr. <HI>Bridges</HI> supposes it to have risen from the ruins of <HI>Eltavon,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> station on the side of the town. It appears that the <HI>Danes</HI> were possessed of <HI>Northampton</HI> in 917; and from thence long made their barbarous excursions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sax. Chr.</HI> 104, 106.</NOTE>. Before the year 1010, they had quitted the place; but in their inroads in that year, they burnt the town, and desolated the country.</P>
<P>IN 1064, it found in the <HI>Northumbrians,</HI> under <HI>Morcar,</HI> who had advanced as far as <HI>Northampton,</HI> a cruel set of banditti, who committed most unprovoked outrages. They murdered the in∣habitants, burnt the houses, and carried off thousands of cattle, and multitudes of prisoners. But in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, here were LX burgesses in the king's lordship, and LX houses. At the time of the Conquest, fourteen were waste; but at the time of the survey, there were forty burgesses in the new borough<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Doomsday-book, <HI>in</HI> Mortor's Northampt.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="331"/>
<HI>Simon de Sancto Licio,</HI> or <HI>Senliz,</HI> a noble <HI>Norman,</HI> founded here the castle. He had married <HI>Maude,</HI> daughter of <HI>Waltheof,</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> and succeeded to the title.</P>
<P>THE Conqueror had bestowed this town, and whole hundred of <HI>Fawsley,</HI> then worth forty pounds a year, on <HI>St. Liz,</HI> to provide shoes for his horses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blunt's Antient Tenures,</HI> 16.</NOTE>. From that period it became considerable, and frequently was the seat of parlements, and was on several other occasions honored with the royal presence.</P>
<P>I MUST particularize the great council held there in 1164, in which the contumacy of <HI>Thomas Becket</HI> was punished by a heavy fine. At this time, <HI>the whole people came, as one man;</HI> and yet all were unequal to the pride and obstinacy of the single prelate<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lord Lyttelton's Henry</HI> II. 41 to 56.</NOTE>. The other great council, or parlement, was summoned in 1176, to confirm the statutes of <HI>Clarendon;</HI> in which the rights of the crown and customs of the realm, especially as to judicial pro∣ceedings, had been established<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same, V. 264, octavo, 2d edit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING the civil contests which <HI>England</HI> was so unhappily afflicted with, it came in for its share of the calamities incident to war. In that between king <HI>John</HI> and the barons; it was stoutly defended on the part of the king against <HI>Robert Fitzwalter,</HI> fana∣tically stiled marshal of <HI>the army of God and the holy church</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden,</HI> i. 519.</NOTE>; who, for want of military engines, was obliged to raise the siege<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Baron,</HI> i. 219.</NOTE>. This post was of such importance, that, after the charter of liber∣ties was extorted from <HI>John,</HI> the constable for the time being was sworn (by the twenty-five barons appointed as a committee to
<PB N="301" REF="332"/>
enforce its execution) to govern the castle according to their pleasure. This was done in the fullness of their power; but as soon as the perjured prince got the upper hand, he appointed <HI>Fulk de Breans</HI> (a valiant but base-born <HI>Norman</HI>) to the com∣mand, as one in whom he could entirely confide<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Baron,</HI> i. 743.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the year 1263, the younger <HI>Mounfort</HI> and his barons held it against their sovereign <HI>Henry</HI> III. The king marched against them with a great force; and having with his battering-rams made a great breach in that part of the town-walls nearest to the monastery of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> entered the place, and, after a short but vigorous resistance, made the whole garrison prisoners<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Carte,</HI> ii, 141.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN 1460, <HI>Henry</HI> VI. made <HI>Northampton</HI> the place of rendezvous of his forces. The strength of his army encouraged his spirited queen to offer battle to his young antagonist, the earl of <HI>Marche,</HI> then at the head of a potent army. A conference was demanded by the earl, and rejected by the royal party; who marched out of the town, and encamped in the meadows between it and <HI>Har∣dinston.</HI> The battle was fierce and bloody; but by the treachery of <HI>Edmund</HI> lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Ruthen;</HI> who deserted his unhappy master, victory declared in favor of the house of <HI>York.</HI> Thousands were slain, or drowned in the <HI>Nen:</HI> among them the duke of <HI>Bucking∣hum,</HI> earl of <HI>Shrewsbury, John</HI> viscount <HI>Beaumont,</HI> and lord <HI>Egre∣mont.</HI> The duke was interred in the church of the <HI>Grey Friars;</HI> others of the men of rank, in the adjacent abbey of <HI>De la Prè;</HI> and others, in the hospital of St. <HI>John,</HI> in the town.</P>
<P>THE town had been inclosed with a strong wall, probably be∣fore

the reign of king <HI>John;</HI> for mention is made, in the second year of his reign, of the east-gate, one of the four. The walls were of breadth sufficient for six men to walk abreast. Both walls and castle were early neglected; for they appear to have been in 1593 in a ruinous state<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Norden,</HI> as quoted by <HI>Bridges,</HI> 432.</NOTE>; yet part of it was used as a prison before the year 1675: and within had been a royal free-chapel, dedicated to St. <HI>George;</HI> to which a chaplain was pre∣sented by the crown, with a salary of L<HI>s.</HI> a year.</P>
<P>IN the civil wars of the last century, <HI>Northampton</HI> was seized by lord <HI>Brook,</HI> for the use of the parlement. In 1642, he forti∣fied it with a foss and ramparts; converted the bridges into draw-bridges; and brought several pieces of cannon here to de∣fend it, in case of attack. Whether it distinguished itself by any particular acts of disloyalty beyond other places, I cannot say; but in 1662, pursuant to an order of council, the walls, gates, and part of the castle, were demolished<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bridges.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">RELIGIOUS HOUSES.</NOTE> THE most antient of the religious houses in this town was the priory of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ST.

convent of <HI>Osney.</HI> He was one day respectfully waited on by the students; who were insolently refused admittance by the <HI>Italian</HI> por∣ter. At length, after intolerable provocation from the clerk of the kitchen, a <HI>Welsh</HI> student drew his bow, and shot him dead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wood's Hist. Ox.</HI> i. 89.</NOTE>. The resentment of government, and the fear of punishment, caused the first secession of the students to <HI>Northampton,</HI> and other places. In succeeding years fresh riots arose, and occasioned farther migra∣tions. At length, these migrations were made under sanction of the king; who imagined that the disturbances arose from the too great concourse of scholars to one place. It is said, that not fewer than fifteen thousand students settled in this town. Whe∣ther from resentment of former proceedings against them, or from the usual dislike youth has to governing powers, they took the part of the barons. They formed themselves into companies, had their distinguishing banner, and, when <HI>Henry</HI> III. made his attack on <HI>Northampton,</HI> proved by far his most vigorous oppo∣nents. After the king had made himself master of the place, he determined to hang every student; but being at length appeased, he permitted them to return to <HI>Oxford,</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Simon Mountfort,</HI> and abolished the university of <HI>Northamp∣ton</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bridges,</HI> 426.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE town is extremely finely situated on an eminence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWS DESCRIBED.</NOTE> gently sloping to the river, which bounds it on the south, as it also does on the west. The streets are in general strait, and very handsomely built. The great market-place is an ornament to the town: few can boast the like. Much of the beauty of
<PB N="307" REF="338"/>
<HI>Northampton</HI> is owing to the calamity it sustained by fire, on <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> 20th, 1675; when the greatest part was laid in ashes. The houses were at that time chiefly wooden. Twenty-five thousand pounds were collected by briefs and private charity towards its relief; and the king gave a thousand tons of timber, out of <HI>Whit∣tlewood</HI> forest, and remitted the duty of chimney-money in this town for seven years: so that it was soon rebuilt; and changed its wooden edifices for more secure and ornamental houses of stone.</P>
<P>THE church of <HI>All Saints</HI> fell a victim to the flames. The old church was a large pile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCHES.</NOTE> with a tower in the center. It was re∣built with great magnificence, and is a considerable ornament to this pretty town. The portico is very elegant, supported in front by eight columns of the Ionic order. The body stands on four lofty columns, and has a neat dome in the middle. The roof beautifully stuccoed. This church, and that of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> were be∣stowed on the priory of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> by <HI>Simon de St. Liz,</HI> the founder. <HI>All Saints</HI> is at present in the gift of the members of the corporation, who are inhabitants of the parish.</P>
<P>THE church of the <HI>Holy Sepulchre</HI> was supposed to have been built by the Knights Templars, on the model of that at <HI>Jerusa∣lem.</HI> The imitative part is round,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOLY SEPULCHRE.</NOTE> with a nave issuing from it. In the round part is a peristyle of eight round pillars, thirteen feet eight inches high, and twelve feet three in circumference. The capitals consist of two round fillets: the arches sharp and plain. The space from the wall to the pillars is eleven feet: the diameter, from the inside of one pillar to that of the opposite, is twenty-nine feet two inches. In the center of the area stands, in
<PB N="308" REF="339"/>
the church at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the supposed sepulchre<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Sandys's Travels.</HI></NOTE>; and it is pro∣bable a model might be placed in those which we find of the same kind in our island; for, besides this, the <HI>Temple</HI> church in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and St. <HI>Sepulchre</HI>'s in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> are built on the same plan. The steeple, and some other parts of that in question, have been added after the building of the circular church.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church is a singular building.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. PETER'S.</NOTE> Two corners of the tower are ornamented with three round pillars: above these are two, and above them one; all gradually lesser than the others. The middle of the tower is ornamented with small round arches, which are continued along the outside of the body of the church, and have a good effect. Within are two rows of round arches, carved with zigzag work: the pillars which support these are al∣ternately single and quadruple. A small monument commemo∣rates <HI>John Smith,</HI> that eminent metzotinto scraper<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. WALPOLE, <HI>Engravers,</HI> 105.</NOTE>, who died in <HI>January</HI> 1742, aged ninety.</P>
<P>THE advowson of this church was given by <HI>Edward</HI> III. to the hospital of St. <HI>Catherine,</HI> near the Tower, in <HI>London,</HI> and still re∣mains under its patronage.</P>
<P>WHOSOEVER intended to clear himself of any criminal accusa∣tion in this town, was obliged to do it in this church only; having here first performed his vigil and prayers in the preceding evening<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bridges,</HI> 445.</NOTE>. St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s church stands in the east skirts of the town; but contains nothing worthy notice.</P>
<P>IN old times <HI>Northampton</HI> was possessed of three other
<PB N="309" REF="340"/>
churches, which are now destroyed. St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s stood on the east side of the road going to <HI>Kingsthorp;</HI> and was bestowed by <HI>St. Liz</HI> on his convent of St. <HI>Andrew.</HI> St. <HI>Edmund</HI>'s stood without the east gate, and was also under the patronage of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s: and the church of St. <HI>Gregory</HI> was the third; also the property of that much-favored house.</P>
<P>AMONG the public buildings, I first speak of the county infir∣mary;<NOTE PLACE="marg">INFIRMARY.</NOTE> not on account of the beauty or magnificence of the house; for it is laudably destitute of both; but because the subscription which supports it does honor to the province, by proving the be∣nevolence of its inhabitants. That of 1779 amounted to near eight hundred pounds; and the number of patients perfectly cured, from its foundation in 1744 to the former year, is not fewer than thirteen thousand one hundred and fifty.</P>
<P>THE county hall is a very handsome building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COUNTY HALL.</NOTE> and ornamented in the manner which gives dignity to courts of justice. The vulgar are affected with external shew, and never pay half the respect to a judge scampering in boots and bob-wig up the stairs of a barn-like court, as they would to the same person, who adds solemnity to his merit, and assumes the garb suited to his cha∣racter.</P>
<P>THE jail is at a small distance from the sessions house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JAIL.</NOTE> and was originally a house built by a Sir <HI>Thomas Haselwood,</HI> and sold by him to the justices of peace.</P>
<P>THE town or guild hall, is an antient building, in which the corporation transacts its business. <HI>Northampton</HI> was incorporated by <HI>Henry</HI> II. <HI>Henry</HI> III. gave it power of chusing annually a mayor, and two bailiffs, to be elected by all the freemen; but <HI>Henry</HI> VII. ordered by charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARTER</NOTE> that the mayor and his brethren,
<PB N="310" REF="341"/>
late mayors, should name forty-eight persons of the inhabitants, with liberty of changing them as often as was found necessary; which forty-eight, with the mayor and his brethren, and such as had been mayors and bailiffs, were annually to elect all future mayors and bailiffs. There are, besides, a recorder, chamberlain, and town-clerk. The mayor, late mayor, and one other mem∣ber of the corporation, nominated by the mayor, aldermen, and bailiffs, are justices of the peace within the town for one year. The mayor, recorder or his deputy, and one justice, are neces∣sary to form a sessions: they have power in criminal causes to try all offenders; but wisely leave all but petty larcenies to the judges of the great sessions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bridges,</HI> 433.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Northampton</HI> is among the most antient boroughs. In the par∣lement held at <HI>Acton Burnel,</HI> in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> I. it was one of the nineteen trading towns which sent two members each. Every inhabitant, resident or non-resident, free or not free, has liberty of voting: a cruel privilege for such who have of late years been ambitious of recommending their representatives.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Northampton</HI> I visited <HI>Castle Ashby,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE ASHBY.</NOTE> the princely seat of the <HI>Comptons</HI> earls of <HI>Northampton.</HI> It lies about six miles south-east of the town, in a wet country, and without any advantage of situation. It is a large structure, surrounding a handsome square court, with a beautiful skreen, the work of <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> bounding one side. More is attributed to that great architect. Some is more antient than his time; yet he probably had the restoring of the old house, as the finishing appears, by a date on the stone ballus∣trade, to be 1624, preceded by the pious text, <HI>Nisi</HI> DOMINUS <HI>aedificaverit Domum, in vanum laboraverunt qui aedificant cum.</HI></P>

<P>THAT favorite of fortune Sir <HI>Stephen Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR STEPHEN FOX.</NOTE> is represented sitting, in a long wig and night-gown: a good-looking man. He was the son of a private family in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> but raised himself by the most laudable of means, that of merit.

him to <HI>France,</HI> and was entertained by <HI>Henry</HI> lord <HI>Percy,</HI> then lord chamberlain to our exiled monarch. To young <HI>Fox</HI> was committed the whole regulation of the household; "who," as lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> observes, <Q>was well qualified with the languages, and all parts of clerkship, honesty, and discretion, as was neces∣sary for such a trust; and indeed his great industry, modesty, and prudence, did very much contribute to the bringing the family, which for so many years had been under no government, into very good order.</Q> On the Restoration he was made Clerk of the Green Cloth; and on the raising of the two regiments, the first of the kind ever known, he was appointed paymaster, and soon after paymaster-general to all the forces in <HI>England.</HI> In 1679, he was made one of the lords of the Treasury; and in the same year, first commissioner in the office of master of the horse; and in 1682, had interest to get his son <HI>Charles,</HI> then only twenty-three years old, to be appointed sole paymaster of the forces, and himself, in 1684, sole commissioner for master of the horse. <HI>James</HI> II. continued to him every kind of favor; yet Sir <HI>Stephen</HI> made a very easy transition to the succeeding prince, and enjoyed the same degree of courtly emolument. <HI>James</HI> thought he might have expected another return from this creation of the <HI>Stuarts:</HI> accordingly excepted him in his act of grace, on the intended in∣vasion of 1692.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Stephen</HI> made a noble use of the gifts of fortune: he re∣built the church of <HI>Early,</HI> his native place; built an hospital there for six poor men, and as many poor women; erected a chapel there, and handsome lodgings for the chaplain, and en∣dowed it with £188 a year: he founded in the same place a charity-school; he built the chancel of a church in the north of

<HI>Wiltshire,</HI> which the rector was unable to do. He also built the church of <HI>Culford</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and pewed the cathedral of <HI>Salis∣bury:</HI> but his greatest act was the founding of <HI>Chelsea</HI> hospital, which he first projected, and contributed thirteen thousand pounds towards the carrying on; alleging, that he <HI>could not bear to see the common soldiers, who had spent their strength in our service, beg at our doors</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collins,</HI> v. 368.</NOTE>.</P>

HIS grandson, Sir <HI>Henry Yelverton,</HI> Baronet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIS SON HENRY.</NOTE> is dressed in a brown mantle and large wig.

Their figures are placed recumbent, and painted: he in his robes, and square cap, and an artichoke at his feet; she, in a black jacket and petticoat, and great distended hood. At her feet a <HI>cat,</HI> allusive to her name.</P>
<P>OVER them are two arched canopies of veined marble, sup∣ported by six square pillars of shell-stone. On one side of the tomb are eight females; on the other, two male figures, and a little girl.</P>
<P>THE other monument is of his son Sir <HI>Henry.</HI> His figure is placed in his robes: and on one side his lady <HI>Anne,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>William Twisden</HI> of <HI>Rawdon-hall,</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> lies by him, wrapped in a black cloak from head to feet. Round her neck is a ruff: in one hand an open book. Above them is a vast canopy, with various statues on the top. This is supported on each side by two full-length figures of almsmen, in black gowns and hoods, with great white beards; the arch resting on their heads. This probably alludes to some charitable foundation with which I am unacquainted. In front, beneath Sir <HI>Henry,</HI> is an altar, at which kneel two men in armour, and two in cloaks, and five women.

<P>BETWEEN this place and the town, in 1460, encamped <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and his insolent nobility, immediately before the bloody battle of <HI>Northampton.</HI> The king (or rather queen) de∣pending on the strength of their entrenchments and warlike en∣gines, returned a haughty answer to the humble proposals sent by the earls of <HI>March</HI> and <HI>Warwick.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE OF NORTHAMPTON.</NOTE> These spirited commanders led

their troops instantly to the attack, and forced the camp, favored by the treachery of <HI>Edmund</HI> lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Ruthen;</HI> who, on some disgust, changed sides, and assisted the enemy in forcing their way into the works. "Ten thousand talle <HI>Englishmen</HI> and their "king," says <HI>Halle</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">xxiv. xxv.

<P>ON the road-side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">QUEEN'S CROSS.</NOTE> on an ascent near this place, stands one of the pledges of affection borne by <HI>Edward</HI> I. to his beloved <HI>Eleanor;</HI> who caused a cross to be erected on the spot whereso∣ever her body rested, in its way from <HI>Hareby</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> where she died, in 1290, to <HI>Westminster,</HI> the place of her inter∣ment. It is kept in excellent repair: is of an octagonal form, and stands on a base of seven steps. Coats of arms and an open book adorn the lower compartments. Above, in six gothic niches, are as many female figures, crowned. Above them, are four modern dials, facing the four cardinal points; and above those is the cross.</P>
<P>AROUND this spot are frequently found <HI>Roman</HI> coins and me∣dals; from which it is conjectured, that this might have been the site of <HI>Eltavon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ELTAVON.</NOTE> or <HI>Eltabon</HI> (from the <HI>British Ael,</HI> a brow, and
<PB N="323" REF="357"/>
<HI>Avon,</HI> a river); and is supposed to have been the <HI>Eltanori,</HI> or <HI>Eltavori,</HI> of the geographer of <HI>Ravenna</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Morton Northampton,</HI> 504. <HI>Gale's Iter. Br. Com.</HI> 145.</NOTE>. The dry and elevated situation, and its vicinity to a river, makes it very probable that this was a <HI>Roman</HI> station, at left a summer camp.</P>
<P>NEAR this place, on the summit of the hill called <HI>Hunsborough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HUNSBOROUGH.</NOTE> are some antient works, of a circular form; <HI>i. e.</HI> conforming to the shape of it; consisting of a foss and double rampart, with a single entrance. Mr. <HI>Morton</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Morton,</HI> 538.</NOTE> attributes this to the <HI>Danes,</HI> and imagines it to have been a summer-camp of one of the plunder∣ing parties which infested the kingdom of <HI>Mercia</HI> about the year 921. Another was raised, about the same time, at <HI>Temsford,</HI> in the county of <HI>Bedford,</HI> for the same purpose. This has very much the appearance of a <HI>British</HI> post; but as there is great simi∣litude between the early fortifications of the northern nations, I will not controvert the opinion of that ingenious author; yet I have probability on my side, as he admits that the <HI>Danes</HI> had possession of <HI>Hamtune,</HI> i. e. <HI>Northampton,</HI> in 917. I think they would scarcely trouble themselves with raising these works so near their former quarters, which, for any thing that appears, was as open to them in 921, as in the former year.</P>
<P>ABOUT five miles from <HI>Queen's Cross</HI> I turned a little out of my road, to see <HI>Horton</HI> church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORTON CHURCH.</NOTE> remarkable for a fine monument of <HI>William</HI> lord <HI>Parr,</HI> uncle, to <HI>Catherine,</HI> the last queen to <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. His lordship is represented in alabaster, recumbent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WILLIAM LORD PARR.</NOTE> with his lady, <HI>Mary Salusbury,</HI> by his side; in right of whom he

became master of this manor. He is dressed in armour, with a collar of SS, and a rose at the end. His head rests on a helmet, whose crest is a hand holding a stag's horn. His upper lip is bare, but his beard is enormous, regularly curled in two rows. He was called to the House of Peers on this second marriage of his niece, was appointed her chamberlain, and, during the queen's regency, on the king's expedition to <HI>France</HI> in 1544, had the re∣spect shewn him to be named as a council to her majesty, occa∣sionally to be called in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herbert's Henry VIII.</HI> 577.</NOTE>.

<P>ON the floor are the figures of <HI>Roger Salusbury,</HI> between his two wives, in brass. He died in 1482, first owner, of his name, of this estate; whose grandaughter became mistress of it on the death of her father <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Lanes</HI> kept it for some generations. On the death of Sir <HI>William,</HI> it was found to be held of Sir <HI>Richard Chetwood,</HI> as of his manor of <HI>Woodhall,</HI> by the service of one knight's see, suit of court, and the annual payment of 6<HI>s.</HI> towards the guard of <HI>Rockingham</HI> castle. The estate passed from the <HI>Lanes</HI> (I believe by purchase) to Sir <HI>Henry Mountague,</HI> first earl of <HI>Manchester,</HI> and, by descent, fell to the earl of <HI>Halifax;</HI> and is now possessed by lord <HI>Hinchinbroke,</HI> in right of his lady, daughter and heiress of the last earl.</P>
<P>THE house is in a very unfinished state; part modern, part antient and embattled.</P>

FROM the <HI>Queen's Cross</HI> to this place the country is uneven, unwatered, and far from pleasant. It is now, in general, in∣closed; but the hedges are young, and, till within these few years, quite a novelty.</P>
<P>NEAR the fifty-eight mile-stone enter the county of BUCKINGHAM. Here the country improves. After passing <HI>Stoke Goldington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">STOKE GOLDINGTON.</NOTE> a small village, a beautiful vale opens on the left, watered by the <HI>Ouze,</HI> running through rich meadows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE OUZE.</NOTE> and embellished with the spire of <HI>Oulney</HI> church. This river rises near <HI>Sysam</HI> in <HI>Northamp∣tonshire,</HI> and, after watering this country, becomes navigable above <HI>Bedford,</HI> by means of locks; runs by <HI>Huntingdon;</HI> and, after creep∣ing almost undistinguished amidst the canals of the fenny tracts, falls into the sea at <HI>Lynn Regis.</HI> The name is probably derived from the <HI>British,</HI> perhaps signifying a river<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Skinner.</HI></NOTE>; being, in common with <HI>Avon,</HI> the name of numbers of <HI>British</HI> streams.</P>
<P>ABOUT half a mile from its banks, on a rising ground on the right, stands <HI>Gothurst,</HI> antiently <HI>Gaythurst;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GOTHURST.</NOTE> whose venerable form has not been injured by inconsistent alterations. It was begun in the forty-third of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and was greatly improved, a few years after, by <HI>William Mulsho,</HI> Esquire. The windows are glazed with propriety: only part of the back-front is modern∣ized. The lands are very finely dressed, and swell into extensive lawns. One before the house consists of a hundred and twenty-eight

acres; and on the sides are others of great extent. The woods are vast, and cut into walks extensive and pleasing. Several pretty pieces of water, the view of the <HI>Ouze</HI> and its verdant mea∣dows, and the old respectable house of <HI>Tyringham,</HI> with its church, on the opposite side, are no small embellishments to the place.</P>

She had not been married three years, before her husband was snatched from her by an ignominious and merited death, for his deep concern in the plot, which, thanks to the charity of the times, is execrated by each religion. It is very probable, that a mind so tinctured with bigotry as his was, soon devoted itself to the most desperate resolutions, for the restoration of the antient church. He foresaw the certain consequences of ill success, and, preparing against the event, took every method to preserve his infant son from suffering from the fault of the father. Before he committed any acts of treason, he secured to his heirs his estates, in such a man∣ner as to put it out of the power of the crown to profit by their confiscation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wright's Antiq.

<P>MOST of the particulars relative to this great family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DIGBY PEDIGREE.</NOTE> I owe to the friendship of my worthy neighbor <HI>Watkin Williams,</HI> Esquire, who favored me with the use of the famous genealogy of the <HI>Digbys</HI> of <HI>Tilton;</HI> a book compiled by the direction of Sir <HI>Kenelm</HI> in 1634, at the expence of twelve hundred pounds. This tradi∣tion, is very credible, to any who have seen the book: a large folio, consisting of five hundred and eighty-nine vellum leaves; the first hundred and sixty-five ornamented with the coats of arms of the family and its allies, and of all the tombs of the <HI>Digbys</HI> then extant, illuminated in the richest and most exquisite manner. The rest of the book is composed of grants, wills, and variety of other pieces, serving to illustrate the history of the family; drawn from the most authentic records, as the title sets forth. Several of the wills are curious proofs of the simplicity of the manners of the times; and another, of the magnificence, superstition, and va∣nity of our greater ancestors.

<P>I NOW return to the period when the family emerged from its misfortune; and in the person of Sir <HI>Kenelm,</HI> the son of the last Sir <HI>Evarard,</HI> was restored to its former honor, by the uncommon merits of the successor. He married <HI>Venetia,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Edward Stanley</HI> of <HI>Tongue Castle, Shropshire,</HI> Knight of the Bath. His eldest son, <HI>Kenelm,</HI> was slain in 1648, in the civil wars, at <HI>St. Neots:</HI> his second son, <HI>John,</HI> succeeded to the estate, and sur∣vived
<PB N="334" REF="369"/>
his father many years. He left by his wife <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Edward Longueville</HI> of <HI>Wolverton,</HI> in this county, Baronet, two daughters; the eldest, <HI>Margaret Maria,</HI> married Sir <HI>John Conway</HI> of <HI>Boddruddan,</HI> in <HI>Flintshire;</HI> the younger, <HI>Char∣lotta,</HI> married <HI>Richard Mostyn</HI> of <HI>Penbedw,</HI> in the same county, Esquire. These two gentlemen, in 1704, sold this manor, with <HI>Stoke Goldington,</HI> and the advowson of both the churches, to <HI>George Wright,</HI> Esquire, son of the lord keeper, Sir <HI>Nathan Wright;</HI> in whose posterity it still remains. By the preceding owners, the reliques of Sir <HI>Kenelm</HI>'s collection came into my country; but the leaving behind the two beautiful busts of lady <HI>Venetia,</HI> impress no favorable idea of their taste.</P>
<P>SOME portraits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTRAITS.</NOTE> belonging to the former possessors, still keep a place in the house. In the parlour is a full-length of old Mr. <HI>Digby,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">OLD MR. DIGBY.</NOTE> father to the unhappy Sir <HI>Everard.</HI> He is represented in a close black dress, a laced turnover ruff, and with lace at his wrist: his hair black, his beard round, with one hand on his sword, the other</P>
<P>HIS lady,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIS LADY.</NOTE> <HI>Mary</HI> daughter of <HI>Francis Neile,</HI> Esquire, of <HI>Prest∣wold,</HI> and <HI>Keythorp,</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> and widow to the <HI>Staffordshire</HI> antiquary, <HI>Sampson Erdeswik.</HI> Her dress is black, pinked with red; has a high fore-top adorned with jewels, a thin upright ruff, round kerchief, a farthingale, with gloves in her hand.</P>
<P>THEIR son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR EVERARD.</NOTE> the victim to bigotry, is here at full-length, in a black mantle and vest, the sleeves slashed, and pinked with white, large turnover, and turn-ups at his wrists: one hand holds his gloves; the other is gracefully folded in his mantle.</P>

belt, a bonnet with a white feather in it, flowered belt, with one hand on his sword. Above him, in a tablet, is represented a lady, in a most supplicatory attitude, with a lute in one hand, and a purse in the other, offering it to him. He stands by her, with averted look, one hand on his breast, and with an air which shews his rejection of her addresses, and horror at the infamy of merce∣nary love; and as if uttering to her the words inscribed near to him, <HI>his majora</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This portrait is inscribed on the back <HI>John Digby;</HI> but from the romantic circumstance attending it, the dress, and the likeness to other pictures of Sir <HI>Kenelm,</HI> I cannot help supposing it to be his.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS is a portrait of the famous Sir <HI>Kenelm,</HI> in his youthful days; that prodigy of learning, credulity, valour, and romance, whose merits, although mixed with many foibles, entirely oblite∣rated every attention to the memory of his father's infamy. The circumstance of the lady painted along with him, is a strong con∣firmation of the truth of the story related by <HI>Lloyd,</HI> that an <HI>Italian</HI> prince, who was childless, earnestly wished that his princess might become a mother by Sir <HI>Kenelm,</HI> whom he esteemed as a just mo∣del of perfection. It is probable that the princess would not have disobeyed the commands of her lord: but whether the painting alludes to our knight's cruelty on this occasion, or whether it might not describe the adventure of the <HI>Spanish</HI> lady, recorded in an elegant old ballad<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antient Songs and Ballads,</HI> ii. 231.</NOTE>, I will not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>IN the long room above stairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LADY VENETIA.</NOTE> is the picture of his beloved wife <HI>Venetia Anastatia Stanley,</HI> in a <HI>Roman</HI> habit, with curled locks. In one hand is a serpent; the other is on a pair of white doves.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="371"/>
She is painted at <HI>Windsor</HI> in the same emblematic manner, but in a different dress, and with accompaniments explanatory of the emblems. The doves shew her innocency; the serpent, which she handles with impunity, shews her triumph over the enve∣nomed tongues of the times. We know not the particulars of the story. Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> must allude to her exculpation of the charge, whatsoever it was, when he mentions her as <Q>a lady of an extraordinary beauty, of as extraordinary same<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lord Clarendon's Life,</HI> 34.</NOTE>.</Q> In the same picture is a genius about to place a wreath on her head. Beneath her is a Cupid, prostrate: and behind him is Calumny, with two faces, flung down and bound; a beautiful compliment on her victory over Malevolence. Her hair in this picture is light, and differs in color from that in the other. I have heard, from a descendant of her's, that she affected different hair-dresses, and different-colored eye-brows, to see which best became her.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Kenelm</HI> was so enamoured with her beauty, that he was said to have attempted to exalt her charms, and preserve her health, by a variety of whimsical experiments. Among others, that of feed∣ing her with capons fed with the flesh of vipers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I am told, that the great snail, or <HI>Pomatia, (Br. Zool.</HI> iv. N<SUP>o</SUP> 128) is found in the neighboring woods, which is its most southern residence in this island. It is of exotic origin. Tradition says, it was introduced by Sir <HI>Kenelm,</HI> as a medicine for the use of his lady.</NOTE>; and that, to improve her complexion, he was perpetually inventing new cos∣metics. Probably she fell a victim to these arts; for she was found dead in bed, <HI>May</HI> 1st, 1633, in the thirty-third year of her age. She was buried in <HI>Christchurch, London,</HI> under a large insu∣lated

tomb of black marble, with her bust on the top. This pe∣rished in the great fire; but the form is represented in the <HI>Pedigree-book,</HI> and from that engraven in the <HI>Antiquaries Reper∣tory.</HI></P>
<P>BOTH the pictures are the performances of <HI>Vandyck.</HI> In this at <HI>Gothurst</HI> are two of her sons, of a boyish age, and in the dress of the times.</P>
<P>HERE are, besides, two most beautiful busts of the same lady,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BUSTS OF LADY VENETIA.</NOTE> in brass; whether by <HI>Le Soeur</HI> or <HI>Fanelli,</HI> I am not certain. One is in the dress of the times: an elegant laced handkerchief falls over her shoulders, leaving her neck bare. Her hair is curled, braided, twisted, and formed on the hind part of her head into a circle; beneath which fall elegant locks. On this bust is in∣scribed,
<Q><HI>Uxorem vivam amare voluptas, defunctam, religio.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE other is <HI>a l'antique.</HI> The head is dressed in the same man∣ner, only bound in a fillet: the drapery covers her breast; but so artificially, as not to destroy the elegancy of the form.</P>
<P>I KNOW of no persons who are painted in greater variety of forms and places, than this illustrious pair: possibly because they were the finest subjects of the times. Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> is in possession of several most exquisite miniatures of the lady, by <HI>Oliver,</HI> bought from the heirs of <HI>Boddrudan</HI> and <HI>Pembedw,</HI> at a very high price. The most valuable is one in a gold case, where she is painted in company with her husband. There is another, said to be painted after she was dead; and four others, in water-colors.</P>
<P>THE same gentleman is in possession of a beautiful miniature
<PB N="338" REF="374"/>
of her mother, lady <HI>Lucy Percy,</HI> purchased at the same time. She is dressed like a citizen's wife, and with dark hair.</P>
<P>AMONG other portraits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LORD KEEPER WRIGHT.</NOTE> is a full-length of the lord keeper, Sir <HI>Nathan Wright,</HI> in his robes, and a head of Sir <HI>Joseph Jekyll,</HI> with a long wig and robes. The first received his appointment in the year 1700, unfortunately for him, as successor to lord <HI>Somers;</HI> whose precipitate dismission, in favor of a Tory, hardly allowed time for reflection on the impropriety of the choice. Sir <HI>Nathan</HI> kept his place till the year 1703, when he was dismissed, not without disgrace; more through defect of ability than want of integrity: but contemned by both parties.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Joseph</HI> was a very different character: a staunch Whig, and a man of great abilities and worth. He died Master of the Rolls, in 1738. His wig was probably none of the best, if we are to trust these complimentary lines of <HI>Pope</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Epilogue to the Satires.</HI></NOTE>:
<Q><L>A horse-laugh, if you please, on honesty;</L>
<L>A joke on <HI>Jekyll,</HI> or some odd old Whig,</L>
<L>Who never chang'd his principle, or wig.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE church is at a little distance from the house;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> is new, and very neat, having been rebuilt, in pursuance of the will of <HI>George Wright,</HI> Esquire, son of the keeper. The figures of father and son face you as you enter the church: the first in his robes; the other in a plain gown: both furnished with enormous <HI>Parian</HI> perri∣wigs.</P>
<P>In the old church was a grave-stone, lying in the chancel, sup∣posed
<PB N="339" REF="375"/>
to have been laid over <HI>John de Nouers,</HI> who lived in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> III. The inscription was in <HI>French</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Communicated by Mr. <HI>Cole,</HI> from church-notes, taken in 1634.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>FROM <HI>Gothurst</HI> I crossed the <HI>Ouze,</HI> to the respectable old house of <HI>Tyringham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TYRINGHAM.</NOTE> (once the seat of a family of the same name) which stands very high in point of antiquity. <HI>Giffard de Tyringham</HI> gave the church of <HI>Tyringham</HI> to the priory of <HI>Tickford,</HI> near <HI>Newport Pagnel,</HI> in 1187. Sir <HI>Roger</HI> was one of the knights who attended <HI>Edward</HI> I. into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and <HI>Roger,</HI> his son, was sheriff of this county as early as the fifteenth of <HI>Richard</HI> II<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In 1322, or the fifteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> II. <HI>Roger de Tyringham</HI> was appointed to superintend the estates forfeited in this county, on the earl of <HI>Lancaster</HI>'s rebel∣lion. <HI>Rymer,</HI> iii. 963.</NOTE>. A Sir <HI>John Tyring∣ham</HI> had the honor of losing his head in the cause of <HI>Henry</HI> VI; being, with several others, put to death unheard, in 1461, for the murder of the duke of <HI>York;</HI> that is, for being present at the battle of <HI>Wakefield,</HI> where that prince fell by some unknown hand. It continued in this antient family till 1685, when, on the death of Sir <HI>William Tyringham,</HI> it devolved to <HI>John,</HI> son of <HI>Edward Backwell,</HI> alderman of <HI>London,</HI> who had married his only daughter.</P>
<P>THE house has been neglected for some time, but not wholly unfurnished. Several family-portraits still continue there: such as a head of lady <HI>Tyringham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTRAITS.</NOTE> in a yellow laced cap and ruff, of
<PB N="340" REF="376"/>
the same kind with that in which the famous Mrs. <HI>Turner</HI> went to be hanged, for her concern in <HI>Overbury</HI>'s murder.</P>
<P>A VERY curious picture, full-length, of an aged lady, in a great quilled ruff and gauze cap, distended behind, with an enor∣mous gauze veil falling to the ground; a black gown spotted with white; jewels, in form of a cross, on her breast; another on her arm, and great strings of pearl round her wrists. She stands beneath a canopy, on which is a crown and coat of arms.</P>
<P>ANOTHER, of a young lady leaning on a chair, in a gauze cap, falling back; yellow petticoat flowered with red, and a feather-san.</P>
<P>A HALF-LENGTH of Colonel <HI>Backwell,</HI> in blue, gold sleeves and frogs, a sash; and a battle in view.</P>
<P>A SMALL portrait of <HI>Edward Backwell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">EDW. BACKWELL.</NOTE> Esquire. He is repre∣sented in long hair and a flowered gown, with a table by him. I have a fine print of him, given me by the late Mr. <HI>Backwell,</HI> one of his descendants. He was, says Mr. <HI>Granger,</HI> an alderman of <HI>London</HI> and a banker, of great ability, industry, and integrity, and of most extensive credit; but ruined in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. by the infamous project of shutting up the Exchequer. He retired to <HI>Holland,</HI> where he died, and was brought over to be interred in the church of <HI>Tyringham;</HI> where he lies embalmed. A glass is placed over his face; so his visage may possibly be seen to this time.</P>
<P>I COULD not but admire a spirited picture of a Falcon stooping at Bitterns.</P>
<P>IN the hall is a curious table, of an ash-colored marble. I should call it a polynesious marble, being veined like a chart filled with little islands, nicely shaded at their edges.</P>

As my curiosity led me to explore the kitchen, I found on the walls the rude portraits of me following fish, recorded to be taken in the adjacent river, in the years below-mentioned.</P>

<P>These are the records of rural life; important to those who were perhaps happily disengaged from the bustle and cares attendant on politics and dissipation.</P>

<P>ABOUT eight miles from <HI>Newport,</HI> at the forty-four mile-stone, at <HI>Hogsty-house,</HI> enter the county of BEDFORD, on <HI>Woburn Sands,</HI> seated on the extremity of the range of hills which traverse the east end of the former county,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WOBURN SANDS.</NOTE> and contain the parishes of the three <HI>Brickhills.</HI> Near the road side are the noted pits of fullers earth, that invaluable substance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FULLERS EARTH.</NOTE> which is supposed to give that great superiority to the <HI>British</HI> cloth (honestly worked) over that of other nations.</P>
<P>THE beds over this important marl are, firstly, several layers of reddish sand, to the thickness of six yards; then succeeds a stra∣tum of sand-stone, of the same color; beneath which, for seven or eight yards more, the sand is again continued to the fullers earth; the upper part of which, being impure, or mixed with sand, is
<PB N="344" REF="380"/>
flung aside, the rest taken up for use. The earth lies in layers; under which is a bed of rough white free-stone, about two feet thick, and under that sand; beyond that the laborers never have penetrated.</P>
<P>THE great use of this earth is cleansing the cloth, or imbibing the tar, grease, and tallow, which are so frequently employed by the shepherds, in healing the external diseases which sheep are liable to; neither can the wool be worked, spun, or woven, unless it be well greased. All this grease must be gotten out, before the cloths are fit to wear. Other countries either want this species of earth, or have it in less perfection. The <HI>British</HI> legislature there∣fore have, from the days of <HI>Charles</HI> I. guarded against the expor∣tation, under severe penalties. The <HI>Romans</HI> attended to the full∣ing business by their <HI>lex Metella,</HI> which was made expressly to re∣gulate the manufacture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keque enim pigebit hanc quoque partem attingere, cum lex <HI>Metella</HI> extet fullonibus dicta, quem <HI>C.

AT a little distance from the town was situated the abbey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ABBEY.</NOTE> founded, in 1145, by <HI>Hugh de Bolebec,</HI> a nobleman of great property in this neighborhood; who, inspired by God, made a visit to the abbot of <HI>Fountains,</HI> to advise with him about his pious design<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugale Monast.</HI> i. 829.</NOTE>. The abbot encouraged him to proceed; and <HI>Hugh</HI> erected the buildings, endowed them, and peopled them with monks of the <HI>Cistercian</HI> order, and placed over them, as first abbot, <HI>Alan,</HI> brought from the monastery of <HI>St. Mary,</HI> at <HI>York.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis,</HI> ii. 4.</NOTE>. The place prospered, by several benefac∣tions; and at the dissolution, was found, according to <HI>Dugdale,</HI> to be possessed of revenues to the amount of £391. 18<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> a year, or to £430. 13<HI>s.</HI> 11<HI>d.</HI> according to <HI>Speed</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE last abbot, <HI>Robert Hobbs,</HI> was hanged at <HI>Woburn,</HI> in <HI>March</HI> 1537, for not acknowleging the king's supremacy. The monas∣tery and its revenues, in 1547, were granted by <HI>Edward</HI> VI. to lord <HI>Russel,</HI> soon after created earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> by the same prince. No one profited so greatly by the plunder of the church as this family: the fortune, even to the present time, doth principally originate from gifts of this nature. To the grant of <HI>Woburn</HI> it owes much of its property in this county, and in <HI>Bucks;</HI> to that of the rich abbey of <HI>Tavistoke,</HI> vast fortunes and interest in <HI>Devon∣shire;</HI> and, to render them more extensive, that of <HI>Dunkeswell</HI> was added. The donation of <HI>Thorney</HI> abbey gave him an amazing tract of fens in <HI>Cambridgeshire,</HI> together with a great revenue. <HI>Melchburn</HI> abbey (I should have before said) increased his property in <HI>Bedfordshire;</HI> the priory of <HI>Castle Hymel</HI> gave him footing in
<PB N="347" REF="383"/>
<HI>Northamptonshire;</HI> and he came in for parcels of the appurtenance of <HI>St. Alban's,</HI> and <HI>Mountgrace</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> not to mention the house of the friars preachers in <HI>Exeter,</HI> with the revenues belong∣ing to the foundation: and finally, the estate about <HI>Covent Gar∣den,</HI> with a field adjoining, called <HI>The Seven Acres,</HI> on which <HI>Long Acre</HI> is built, appertenances to the convent of <HI>Westminster;</HI> the first, a garden belonging to the abbot.</P>
<P>THE superstitious will stand amazed, that no signal judgment has overtaken the children of sacrilege; yet no house in <HI>Britain</HI> has thriven more than the house of <HI>Russel.</HI></P>
<P>THE house is situated in a very pleasant park, well wooded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUSE.</NOTE> but defective in water; the several pieces being too much di∣vided, and the dams too conspicuous. The present house was built by the late duke, excepting a paltry grotto, by <HI>Inigo Jones</HI> (which shews that his taste was superior to such childish perfor∣mances) and the great stables, which were part of the antient cloisters, and still preserve their pillars and vaulted roof. The offices are also the work of the late duke, and form two magni∣ficent but plain buildings, at a small distance from the mansion.</P>
<P>THIS house is a treasure of paintings; of portraits of the great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTRAITS.</NOTE> now illustrious by their figure they make in the eyes of posterity, undazzled with their wealth, rank, power, or qualifica∣tions, mental or corporeal, which concealed their failings, and made them pass at lest unnoticed openly by their cotemporaries. They now undergo a posthumous trial, and, like the <HI>Egyptians</HI> of old, receive censure or praise according to their respective merits.</P>
<P>THE first which struck me was a lady, who defied the strictest
<PB N="348" REF="384"/>
scrutiny; a small full-length, in widow's weeds, with her head reclined on one hand, and a book by her;<NOTE PLACE="marg">RACHEL LADY RUSSEL.</NOTE> with a countenance full of deep and silent sorrow: the sad relict of the virtuous lord RUSSEL, and daughter to the good and great <HI>Wriothesly</HI> earl of <HI>Southampton.</HI> I imagine her in the third month of her affliction, filled with the following meditation:</P>
<P><Q>LORD, let me understand the reason of these dark and wounding providences, that I sink not under the discourage∣ment of my own thoughts. I know I have deserved my pu∣nishment, and will be silent under it; but yet secretly my heart mourns, because I have not the dear companion and sharer of my joys and sorrows: I want him to talk with, to eat, and sleep with. All these things are irksome to me now: the day unwelcome, and the night so too. All company and meals I would avoid, if it might be; yet all this is, that I enjoy not the world in my own way; and this sure hinders my comfort. When I see my children before me, I remember the pleasure he took in them! This makes my heart to shrink. Can I regret his quitting a lesser good for a bigger? O! if I did stedfastly believe, I could not be dejected! But I will not injure myself, to say I offer my mind any inferior consolation to supply this loss: no, I most willingly forsake this world, this vexatious, troublesome world, in which I have no other business but to rid my soul from sin; secure, by faith and a good conscience, my eternal interest; with patience and courage bear my eminent misfortunes, and ever hereafter be above the smiles and frowns of it; and when I have done the remnant of the work ap∣pointed me on earth, then joyfully wait for the heavenly per∣fection, in GOD'S good time; when, by his infinite mercy, I
<PB N="349" REF="385"/>
may be accounted worthy to enter in the same place of rest and repose, where he is gone for whom only I grieve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lady Russel's Letters,</HI> Letter vi.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>I NOW turn my eyes to a lady, whose felicity consisted in a dif∣ferent fate; in being early cut off from the embraces of a capri∣cious tyrant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LADY JANE SEYMOUR.</NOTE> whose inconstancy and whose lusts would probably have involved her in misery, had not heaven, in its mercy, taken her to itself. Lady <HI>Jane Seymour,</HI> the lady in question, became queen to <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in 1536, and was released from him by death, 1537. The portrait expresses the elegance of her person. She is dressed in red, with great gold net-work sleeves, and rich in jewels. Her print, among the illustrious heads, does her little justice.</P>
<P>THAT gloomy insipid pair, <HI>Philip</HI> II. and his consort <HI>Mary,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PHILIP AND MARY.</NOTE> are painted in small full-lengths, by Sir <HI>Antonio More.</HI> The first of these ungracious figures is dressed in a black jacket, with gold sleeves and hose; the queen sitting, in a black-and-gold petticoat, and furred sleeves. Her black conic cap is faced with gold and jewels. A rich chain of great pearls and small vases, red and gold, are other ornaments to our bigotted sovereign. The date is 1553. Sir <HI>Antonio</HI> was sent from <HI>Spain</HI> to draw her picture; so has placed them in a scene of aukward courtship; for they were not married till the following year.</P>
<P>ANOTHER remarkable portrait, by the same painter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ED. COURTENEY EARL OF DEVONSHIRE.</NOTE> is that of <HI>Edward Courteney,</HI> last earl of <HI>Devonshire</HI> of his name; who, for his nearness in blood to the crown, was imprisoned by the jealous <HI>Henry,</HI> from the age of ten till about that of twenty-eight. His daughter <HI>Mary</HI> set him at liberty, and wooed him to share the king∣dom with her. He rejected her offer, in preference to her sister
<PB N="350" REF="386"/>
<HI>Elizabeth;</HI> for which, and some false suspicion of disaffection, he suffered another imprisonment with <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> He was soon re∣leased. He quitted the kingdom, as prudence directed, and died at the age of thirty, at <HI>Padua.</HI></P>
<P>HE is represented as a handsome man, with short brown hair, and a yellow beard, a dark jacket, with white sleeves, and breeches; behind him is a ruined tower; beneath him this in∣scription, expressive of his misfortunes:
<Q><L>En! puer et insons et adhuc juvenilibus annis;</L>
<L>Annos bis septem carcere clusus eram.</L>
<L>Me pater his tenuit vinclis, quae filia solvit:</L>
<L>Sors mea sic tandem vertitur a superis.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Fourteen long years in strict captivity,</L>
<L><HI>Tyrant-condemn'd,</HI> I pass'd my early bloom,</L>

<P>SIR <HI>Philip Sydney</HI> is painted in the twenty-second year of his age;<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR. PHILIP SYDNEY.</NOTE> in a quilled ruff, white slashed jacket, a three-quarter length. He was a deserved favorite of queen <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> who well might think the court deficient without him; for, to uncommon knowlege, valour, and virtuous gallantry, was joined a romantic spirit, congenial with that of his royal mistress. His romance of <HI>Arcadia</HI> is not relished at present: it may be te∣dious; but the morality, I fear, renders it disgusting to our age. It is too replete with innocence to be relished. Sir <HI>Philip</HI> was to the <HI>English,</HI> what the Chevalier <HI>Bayard</HI> was to the <HI>French, Un Chevalier sans peur, et sans reproches.</HI> Both were strongly tinctured with enthusiastic virtue: both died in the field with the highest sentiments of piety.</P>

LORD TREASURER <HI>Burleigh,</HI> the able statesman of <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> a favorite,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TREASURER BURLEIGH.</NOTE> whom she chose, as she expressed it, not for his <HI>bad legs, but for his good head</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lloyd's Worthies,</HI> i. 360.</NOTE>.

<P>THIS great statesman is represented sitting. His countenance comely, his beard grey, his gown black and furred, and adorned with a gold chain. His mistress lost this faithful servant in 1598, aged seventy-seven.</P>
<P>HIS second son is placed near him, standing: a mean, little,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROBERT EARL OF SALISBURY.</NOTE> deformed figure, possessed of his father's abilities, but mixed with deceit and treachery. His services to his master and his country, will give him rank among the greatest ministers; but his share in bringing the great <HI>Raleigh</HI> to the scaffold, and the dark part he acted, in secretly precipitating the generous, unsuspecting <HI>Essex</HI> to his ruin, will ever remain indelible blots on him as a man. His dress is that of the <HI>Spanish</HI> nation (though he was averse to its politics) a black jacket and cloak, which add no grace to his figure.</P>

<P><HI>Anne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HIS DUTCHESS.</NOTE> daughter of that infamous pair, <HI>Robert Car</HI> earl of <HI>Somer∣set</HI> and his countess, is painted by <HI>Vandyck,</HI> in blue, drawing on a glove: a most beautiful half-length. She was the wife of Sir <HI>William Russel,</HI> above mentioned, married to him in the year 1637. She proved worthy of the alliance she made. It is said that she was ignorant of her mother's dishonor, till she read it in a pam∣phlet she found accidentally left in a window. It is added, that the was so struck with this detection of her parents guilt, that she fell down in a fit, and was found senseless, with the book open before her. She died on <HI>May</HI> 10th, 1684. The anecdote is omitted in the histories of the family, probably to avoid the re∣vival of a disgraceful tale. <HI>Francis</HI> earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> was so averse to the alliance, that he gave his son leave to chuse a wife out of any family but that. Opposition usually stimulates desire: the young couple's affections were only increased. At length the king interposed, and, sending the duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> to urge the earl to consent, the match was brought about. <HI>Somerset,</HI> now reduced to poverty, acted a generous part; selling his house at <HI>Chiswick,</HI> plate, jewels, and furniture, to raise a fortune for his daughter of twelve thousand pounds, which the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> demanded; saying, that seeing her affections were settled, he chose rather to undo himself than make her unhappy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>British.

I can only pretend to point out some principal facts, that the spectator, who may honor me with his company through this il∣lustrious assemblage, may not have to reproach me, with suf∣fering him to depart wholly uninformed.</P>
<P>THE first I shall point out, is a head of lord WILLIAM RUSSEL,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LORD WILLIAM RUSSEL.</NOTE> the sad victim to his virtuous design of preserving our liberties and constitution from the attempts of as abandoned a set of men as ever governed these kingdoms. True patriotism, not ambition nor interest, directed his intentions.

The law of politics gives sanction to the removal of every obstacle to the designs of statesmen. At the same time, we never should lessen our admiration and pity of the generous characters who fell sacrifices to their hopes of delivering purified to their descendants, the corrupted government of their own days. To attempt to clear lord RUSSEL from the share in so glorious a design, would be to deprive him of a most brilliant part of his character. His integrity and ingenuity would not suffer even himself to deny that part of the charge. Let that re∣main unimpeached, since he continues so perfectly acquitted of the most distant design of making assassination a means; or of in∣triguing with a foreign monarch, the most repugnant to our re∣ligion and freedom, to bring about so desired an end.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this nobleman was inferior in abilities to his younger brother, yet was he a man of spirit and of parts.

Her heart was lost to him at the preceding tournaments; in which she had opportunity to compare her feeble bridegroom with the dexterity, the grace, and strength of her valiant knight; who, at single combat, overthrew man and horse. The <HI>French,</HI> envious of his prowess, introduced into the lists a gigantic <HI>German,</HI> in hopes of bringing the <HI>English</HI> hero into disgrace. He treated the <HI>Almain</HI> so roughly, that the <HI>French</HI> interfered; but, in a second trial, <HI>Suffolk</HI> caught him round the neck, and pummelled him so severely about the head, that they were obliged to convey the fellow away secretly; who had been surreptitiously introduced in disguise, merely on account of his great strength<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Halle,</HI> xlix. <HI>Holinshed,</HI> 833.</NOTE>.</P>

I need not enlarge on the well-known marriage and divorce of this lady from the earl of <HI>Essex.</HI> They are too well known to be in∣sisted on; as is her weakness, in having recourse to the impostor <HI>Forman</HI> for philtres to debilitate <HI>Essex,</HI> and impel the affections of <HI>Somerset</HI> towards her. Her wickedness, in procuring the death of <HI>Overbury,</HI> who obstructed this union; her sudden fall, and con∣fession of guilt on her trial, need no repetition. Her earl avowed his innocency; he had been more covert in his proceed∣ings. Her passions were more violent, her resentments greater, and, of course, her caution less. They both obtained an unme∣rited pardon, or rather reprieve, being confined in the Tower till the year 1622, and then confined, by way of indulgence, in the house of lord <HI>Wallingford.</HI> The little delicacy which people of rank too frequently shew, by countenancing the vices of their equals, was conspicuous at this time. The countess felt their pity, and was visited even by the stern <HI>Anne Clifford.

In her end may be read a fine lesson on the vengeance of Providence on the complicated wickedness of her life.

This lady, who is less talked of than
<PB N="374" REF="410"/>
others, was by far the most illustrious character of the age in which she lived. Her virtues, domestic and public, were of the most exalted kind. Hospitality, charity, and piety, were in her pre-eminent. I speak not of her great maternal cares; nature dictates that, more or less, in all the sex: but her abilities in the management of the vast affairs of her family, perplexed with numberless litigations, gave her a distinguished character. She at left equalled her lord in loyalty, and was indefatigable in inciting the nobility, who had quitted the cause of majesty, to expiate their error. After the battle of <HI>Worcester,</HI> she lived three years in privacy at her brother's house at <HI>Ampthill,</HI> and had cor∣respondence with several great personages, on the subject of re∣storing the exiled king. The reserved <HI>Monk</HI> had such an opinion of her prudence, as to communicate to her the signal by which she might know his intentions on that subject. She lived in high esteem, to a very advanced age; died in 1674, and was interred by her beloved lord, at <HI>Derby.</HI></P>
<P>IT is no wonder that so illustrious a character should attract the powers of the poets. She had the honor of being celebrated by one equal in rank to her own. That accomplished nobleman <HI>William</HI> earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> wrote several poems to her, and dedicated a col∣lection of them to her. <Q>There is wit and ease in several; but a great want of correction, and often of harmony.

<P>FROM <HI>Woburn,</HI> for the sake of variety, I left the great road, and, crossing the county, went through the village of <HI>Ridge∣mont,</HI> and, soon after, through that of <HI>Millbrook,</HI> whose church is pleasantly seated on the bluff point of a hill. Abou<SUP>t</SUP> two miles farther, reach <HI>Ampthill,</HI> a small market-town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AMPTHILL.</NOTE> on a rising ground, noted in old times for the magnificent mansion built by lord <HI>Fanhope,</HI> as <HI>Leland</HI> says, with <HI>such spoiles that he wanne in Fraunce</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Itin,</HI> i. 115.</NOTE>.

in the field, and in the lists of arms. At <HI>York</HI> he fought and vanquished, in the presence of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. two valiant knights; one a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> the other an <HI>Italian.</HI> In reward for his prow∣ess, <HI>Henry</HI> created him knight of the Garter. He signalized him∣self at the battle of <HI>Azincourt,</HI> where he took prisoner <HI>Louis de Bourbon</HI> count of <HI>Vendome,</HI> and had his ransom confirmed to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sandford's Genealog.

He had no lawful issue; neither were the large grants made to him by the crown, for more than term of life; so that they reverted on his decease.</P>
<P>THE place was afterwards bestowed by <HI>Edward</HI> IV. on <HI>Edmund</HI> lord <HI>Grey.</HI> The gift was not (as <HI>Leland</HI> supposes) founded on the ruin of lord <HI>Fanhope,</HI> after the battle of <HI>Northampton;</HI> for that event did not take place till seventeen years after <HI>Fanhope</HI> died peaceably in his bed. It continued in the family of the <HI>Greys</HI> till the death of <HI>Richard</HI> earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> who made it over to <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.

What is singular in this monument is, the preservation of the very ball with which he was killed, a five or six pounder; which is placed within the pe∣diment, inlaid in the marble; and on the molding of the pedi∣ment, on each side of the bullet, are the words,

Sir <HI>John Robinson</HI>'s portrait is preserved here: a half-length, in a great wig, cravat, sash, and buff coat. He was an eminent loyalist; was lord mayor of <HI>London</HI> in 1663, and lieutenant of the Tower, from the Restoration to the time of his death. His double employ is expressed by a distant view of the Tower, and the gold chain placed by him on a table.</P>

years after the death of her husband. He had left the senate of <HI>Venice</HI> protectors of her, and the child with which she was preg∣nant at the time of that event. The infant son lived only ten months; and the <HI>Venetian</HI> state considered itself as heir to the kingdom, in right of its daughter <HI>Catherine.</HI> Apprehensions arose, that the <HI>Turkish</HI> emperor <HI>Bajazet,</HI> and the <HI>Christian</HI> mo∣narch <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> had designs on it: they determined to frustrate both, and sent <HI>George Cornaro,</HI> brother to the queen, to assist her in the government. By his eloquence, he succeeded in the ardu∣ous task of persuading a lady out of her love of power. He pro∣mised her regal state in her native county. She accepted the terms, and erected the <HI>Venetian</HI> standard in her capital; and, on her arrival at <HI>Venice,</HI> was met by the whole senate, and the ladies of rank, and received, during life, every mark of esteem which her patriotism merited; with a magnificent establishment, equal to the dignity she had so generously quitted. This event happened about the year 1489<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gratiani's Wars of Cyprus,</HI> 10, 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Albert</HI> archduke of <HI>Austria,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Cardinal In∣fant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CARDINAL INFANT.</NOTE> in black, a great ruff, and with a sword.

His talents were more fitted for the field and cabinet. Accordingly, we find him in universal esteem, for his prudent administration as regent of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and a brave and enterprizing general in the Low Countries, in the reign of <HI>Philip</HI> II. who had invested him with their government. In the

He lived till the year 1621, and died universally lamented by his subjects. He was a patron of the arts. He was so struck with the merit of <HI>Rubens,</HI> that he detained that able painter some time at <HI>Antwerp;</HI> and to him we owe the portrait of this illustrious prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anecdotes of Painting,</HI> ii. 81.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><HI>Ampthill Park,</HI> and that of <HI>Houghton,</HI> contiguous to it, were granted by <HI>James</HI> I. to Sir <HI>Edward Bruce</HI> of <HI>Kinloss</HI> (a favorite, brought by his majesty out of <HI>Scotland</HI>) or to his son <HI>Thomas</HI> earl of <HI>Elgin.</HI> It continued for some time in his posterity, earls of <HI>Elgin</HI> and of <HI>Aylesbury.</HI> It became, about the year 1690 (by purchase) the property of lord <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> who built the house; which still retains nearly the original form. It was alienated by <HI>John,</HI> the first earl of that title, between the years 1720 and 1730, to lord viscount <HI>Fitz-William.</HI> His lordship sold it, in the year 1736, to lady <HI>Gowran,</HI> grandmother to the present lord <HI>Ossory.</HI></P>
<P>FROM hence is a very short ride to <HI>Houghton Park,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUGHTON PARK.</NOTE> formerly part of the estate of <HI>Ampthill.</HI> As soon as that honor was alien∣ated from the crown, the earl of <HI>Elgin</HI> pulled down the old castle,

<FIGURE>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="381" REF="418"/>
and built what is now called <HI>Houghton House,</HI> and inclosed the park which goes by that name; and then <HI>Old Ampthill Park</HI> be∣came only the second park to the seat. The house is seated on a bold eminence, and commands a fine view. Two of the fronts are very beautiful; each has an elegant portico and loggio above. On the intervening space are variety of cyphers, devices, and crests; such as bears and ragged staves, staves and palms, crowned lions and crowns, and beards of arrows, or hedge-hogs and porcupines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In an old edition of the <HI>Arcadia,</HI> date 1629, is a hedge-hog, or porcupine, as a crest to the top of a frontispiece. A proof, perhaps, of a <HI>Sydney</HI> being con∣cerned in the plan.</NOTE>. Some of these certainly relate to the <HI>Sydnies.</HI> This gave rise to the assertion of the editor of <HI>Cambden,</HI> that it was built by the countess of <HI>Pembroke,</HI>
<Q><HI>Sydney</HI>'s sister, <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s mother;</Q>and that the model was contrived by her brother, the incompa∣rable Sir <HI>Philip Sydney,</HI> in his <HI>Arcadia.</HI> From the letters on the south front, I. R. with a crown over them, it is evident that the house was built in the time of <HI>James</HI> I; and, as there is great rea∣son to suppose that <HI>Inigo Jones</HI> was the architect, it is possible that he might have been recommended by that lady, wife to <HI>William</HI> earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> one of <HI>Inigo</HI>'s great patrons; from whose designs the earl built the noble front of his seat at <HI>Wilton.</HI> Let this be admitted, we are not to wonder at seeing the devices, of her beloved brother ornamenting a place, with which she might have no connections, but those of friendship.</P>
<P>THE portico and loggio are of stone, and ornamented with
<PB N="382" REF="419"/>
columns of the Doric and Ionic orders: the rest of the house is of brick. The fronts are unequal; one being a hundred and twenty-two feet in extent; the other, only seventy-three feet six inches.</P>
<P>THE house and manor were purchased by the late duke of <HI>Bed∣ford,</HI> from <HI>Charles</HI> earl of <HI>Aylesbury,</HI> and with it the stewardship of the honor of <HI>Ampthill,</HI> hold under the crown.</P>
<P>THIS place must not be confounded with <HI>Houghton Conquest:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUGHTON CONQUEST.</NOTE> a very antient house, at the foot of the hill. This had been the property of the very old family of the <HI>Conquests,</HI> and was pur∣chased, with the manor, from the last Mr. <HI>Conquest,</HI> by the late earl of <HI>Ossory.</HI></P>
<P>I DID not leave the neighborhood without visiting the church of <HI>Maulden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMBS IN MAULDEN CHURCH.</NOTE> a mile or two to the east of <HI>Ampthill.</HI> This is noted for the octagonal <HI>mausoleum</HI> erected by <HI>Thomas Bruce</HI> earl of <HI>Elgin,</HI> in honor of his second wife <HI>Diana,</HI> daughter of <HI>William</HI> lord <HI>Burgbly,</HI> and by her first husband countess of <HI>Oxford.</HI> Her tomb, of white marble, is placed in the center. On it is a sarcophagus, or at lest what was designed to represent one; out of which rises a miserable figure of the countess in her shroud: on whom the country people, by a very apt similitude, have bestowed the title of <HI>The lady in the punch-bowl.</HI> In a niche in the wall of the building is the bust of her husband, with long hair, a short beard, and turnover; and on the floor is another bust (I think) of her son-in-law, <HI>Robert</HI> earl of <HI>Elgin,</HI> placed at a respectable distance, as well as the other, for the reason given in the inscription, <HI>Eminus stantes venerabundi, quasi contemplabuntur</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the whole epitaph in the <HI>Appendix. Thomas</HI> earl of <HI>Elgin</HI> died in 1663; the countess in 1654.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="420"/>
IN the church are the brasses of <HI>Richard Faldo</HI> and his family, inlaid on a tomb of shell-marble.</P>
<P>AFTER a short ride, I reached the large house of <HI>Wrest,</HI> seated in a low and wet park, crossed with formal rows of trees. The pleasure-grounds have, since their first creation, been cor∣rected by <HI>Brown:</HI> his hand appears particularly in a noble ser∣pentine river. Several parts are graced with obelisks, pavilions, and other buildings, the taste of the age before.
<Q><L>From his melon-ground the peasant slave</L>
<L>Had rudely rush'd, and levell'd <HI>Merlin</HI>'s cave.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the quarters of the wilderness are to be seen two cenotaphs, for the late duke and dutchess, erected by the duke himself: and, if you gain a steep ascent, from the hill-house is a most extensive view of the country. The front is plain and extensive. Within, is a great court. This place is the property of the earl of <HI>Hard∣wick,</HI> in right of his lady <HI>Jemima,</HI> marchioness <HI>Grey,</HI> daughter to <HI>John</HI> earl of <HI>Breadalbane,</HI> by <HI>Amabel;</HI> daughter to <HI>Henry Grey,</HI> thirteenth earl and first duke of <HI>Kent</HI> of the name.

<P>THE portraits and their history would take up a volume. I must, therefore, be excused for giving a more brief account than their merits might demand.</P>

Every engine was then employed to hurt his private ease: she affected amours, of which she never was guilty, and permitted fa∣miliarities, which her pride would probably have never conde∣scended to. <HI>James</HI> was armed with indifference. At length, in 1619, he saw her descend to the grave; but not with the resigna∣tion of a good Christian monarch, as might have been expected from her conduct.</P>

<P>LADY <HI>Rich,</HI> in black.

When <HI>Blount,</HI> after some years absence in the <HI>Irish</HI> wars, returned laden with glory, and, by the death of his elder brother, honored with the title of <HI>Mountjoy,</HI> he commenced a criminal connection with his former mistress.

<P>HIS successor <HI>Anthony,</HI> grandson of <HI>Anthony,</HI> third son of <HI>George</HI> earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> is drawn in black, with his hand on a book: a meagre personage.

<P>THE old dining-room is most curiously furnished: mock pilas∣ters finished with stripes of velvet, and worked silk festoons be∣tween each. This is said to have been done for the reception of <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>IN this apartment is the portrait of that eminent statesman and honest man Sir <HI>William Temple:</HI> a copy from one by <HI>Lely;</HI> yet a most beautiful picture. He is placed sitting, and looking to∣wards you, in a red vest; his hair long, black, and flowing; his whiskers small.

<P>IN the chapel-closet is the glory of the name, lady <HI>Jane Gray,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LADY JANE GRAY.</NOTE> the sweet accomplished victim to the wickedness of her father-in-law, and the folly of her father. Her person was rather plain; but that was amply recompensed by her intellectual charms. She was mistress of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> tongues; versed in <HI>Hebrew,</HI>
<PB N="383" REF="425"/>
<HI>Chaldee, Arabic, French,</HI> and <HI>Italian;</HI> skilled in music; and excel∣lent at her needle. I have seen in the library at <HI>Zurich</HI> several of her letters, wrote in a most beautiful hand, to <HI>Bullenger,</HI> on the subject of religion; and a toilet, worked with her own hand, is preserved there with great reverence. She fell at the age of se∣venteen. Could there be wanting any proof of her amazing for∣titude, it was supplied near her last moments with the most invincible one: — As she was passing to the scaffold (whether by accident, or whether by the most cruel intention) she met the headless body of her beloved husband. A line in <HI>Greek,</HI> to the following purpose, was her consolation: <Q>That if his lifeless body should give testimony against her before men, his most blessed soul should give an eternal proof of her innocence in the presence of GOD.</Q></P>
<P>THE dress of this suffering innocent is, a plain white cap, a handkerchief, fastened under her arms, and a black gown: a book in her hand.</P>

This is the lady who is fabled to have died of the prick∣ing of her finger with the needle, and who is shewn as such in <HI>Westminster</HI> abbey. She looks as pale as if the fact was true. Her gown is finely flowered; her petticoat white and striped; her robe lined with ermine; her veil vast and distended; her wedding-ring hanging from her wrist by a silken string.</P>
<P>IN another room is the portrait of Sir <HI>Randle Crew,</HI> in a bon∣net,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR RANDLE CREW.</NOTE> ruff, gold chain, and robes, as lord chief justice of the King's Bench: a dignity he filled with credit in the last year of <HI>James</HI> I. and first of <HI>Charles</HI> I. He had the honor of being displaced in 1626, for his disapprobation of the imprisonment of those gentle∣men who refused the arbitrary loan proposed by the court. He discovered, says <HI>Fuller,</HI> no more discontentment at his discharge, than a weary traveller is offended at being told that he is arrived at his journey's end<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>British Worthies, Cheshire,</HI> 178. It must not be forgot that Sir <HI>Randle</HI> had been speaker of the House of Commons in 1614.</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="390" REF="427"/>
THE next portrait is that of his younger brother Sir <HI>Thomas Crew,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR THOMAS CREW.</NOTE> in red robes, and a coif as king's serjeant. He was among the most active supporters of the rights of the commons in the reign of <HI>James</HI> I. The king, under pretence of redressing certain matters in <HI>Ireland,</HI> sent him, and several of the most obnoxious members, into that kingdom, with proper commissions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Drake,</HI> v. 525.</NOTE>. In 1623 he was chosen speaker, and made a speech, which his ma∣jesty heard with no more patience than approbation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, vi. 10.</NOTE>; yet, by his lord keeper, thanked him for several parts of it. He was again speaker to the first parlement of <HI>Charles</HI> I. and died in <HI>February</HI> 1633, aged sixty-eight. By his marriage with <HI>Tem∣perance,</HI> fourth daughter of <HI>Reginald Bray,</HI> Esquire, he obtained the manor of <HI>Stene,</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire;</HI> which became the set∣tlement of him and his posterity, till it devolved to this house, by the marriage of <HI>Henry</HI> duke of <HI>Kent</HI> with <HI>Jemima,</HI> eldest daughter of <HI>Thomas</HI> lord <HI>Crew.</HI></P>
<P>HIS son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JOHN LORD CREW.</NOTE> <HI>John</HI> lord <HI>Crew,</HI> is represented in his baronial robes, with long grey hair, and a small coif. He was created lord <HI>Crew</HI> of <HI>Stene,</HI> in 1661, having been active in promoting the Restora∣tion, and freeing his country from the confused government it had long labored under. No one was more active in defence of the liberties of his country, in the beginning of the troubles of the former reign, than himself. He had been member for <HI>Northamptonshire</HI> in the long parlement; was chairman to the committee of religion; and was committed to the Tower, for re∣fusing to deliver up the petitions and complaints<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same, viii. 489.</NOTE>.

nominated one of the commissioners for the treaty of <HI>Uxbridge:</HI> he was one of those entrusted with the receipt of the king's per∣son from the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the conveying him to <HI>Holmby House.</HI> He again acted as commissioner in the treaty of the <HI>Isle of Wight;</HI> and finally, was so far in the favor of the usurper, as, in 1657, to be constituted one of the sixty which formed the upper house of his mock parlement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitelock,</HI> 233, 334, 666.</NOTE>. The game being soon over, he conci∣liated himself to the approaching change, and proved so active an instrument in the Restoration, as not only to make amends for his past demerits, but to obtain, in 1661, the honor of baron of <HI>Stene.</HI> He died in 1679, after attaining the good old age of eighty-two.</P>

This was the fiery zealot who fat in judgment on <HI>Mary Stuart,</HI> and, with the earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> was deputed to see execution done on the unhappy princess. They, with true bigotry, refused her the consolation of her almoner in her last moments; and <HI>Kent</HI> had the brutality to give a most reluctant assent to her request of having a few of her domestics to perform their final duties to their dying mistress. <HI>Kent</HI> even burst into the exclamation of saying, <Q>Your life will be the death of our religion, and your death will be the life of it.</Q> A cause of triumph to <HI>Mary Stuart.</HI> He founded this building, and took possession of it in the begin∣ning of the year 1614.

His beard is small, his lip whis∣kered; one hand is on his breast, the other on his sword. She is dressed in an ungraceful pair of slays; her hands before, hold∣ing her robes; her neck naked; her hair curled, and enormously bushy. He died in 1651; she finished her excellent life in 1698, aged ninety-two.</P>

He valiantly supported the royal cause at the first battle of <HI>St. Alban's,</HI> and was carried out of it dreadfully wounded; yet, with the fickleness of the times, he joined the duke of <HI>York,</HI> in 1459, and was of course attainted by the <HI>Lancastrian</HI> parlement.

the fierce attack he had made on the enemy, he returned, enraged, to see the cause. He found lord <HI>Wenlock,</HI> with his troops, standing in the market-place. Whether a panic had seized him, or whe∣ther, through a mutability of mind, he was meditating a new re∣volt, does not appear; but the earl, unable to curb his fury, rode up, and with one blow of his battle-ax clove the skull of the supposed traitor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Halle's Chr.</HI> xxxii.</NOTE>. He was interred at <HI>Tewkesbury;</HI> and his tomb is still to be seen in that noble church.</P>
<P>IN this chapel are several tombs: one very magnificent, in the altar-form, with a rich canopy, open beneath on each side. On the top various arms, some inclosed in a garter. On a wreath is a crest, a plume of feathers.</P>
<P>ON the tomb lie the effigies of <HI>William Wenlock,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WILLIAM WENLOCK.</NOTE> in the habit of a shaven priest: his hands closed as if in prayer; beads hang from them; and on a label from his mouth is a small shield of a chev∣ron, between three croslet gules, and these words:

This also directs us to the origin of lord <HI>Wenlock.</HI> It is most likely that his father was related to this prebend, and that he left his possessions to him; and that lord <HI>Wenlock,</HI> in the height of his prosperity, paid this ostentatious compliment to the memory of his kinsman.</P>
<P>IN the middle is an altar-tomb of shell-marble, with the brass plate of a woman.</P>
<P>IN the wall, beneath two arches, are the tombs, I think, of the <HI>Rotherhams,</HI> owners of this chapel after the <HI>Wenlocks.</HI> On one had been an inscription to a <HI>Rotherham,</HI> who had married <HI>Catherine,</HI> daughter of a lord <HI>Grey;</HI> and was himself nephew to <HI>Scot,</HI> alias <HI>Rotherham,</HI> archbishop of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>THE following odd medley of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> merits trans∣cribing. It is on the tomb of <HI>John Ackworth,</HI> Esquire, who died in 1513; and is represented here with his two wives, eight sons, and nine daughters.

<P>NEAR the altar is a large mutilated figure in the wall, in a priestly habit, with a pastoral staff, or a crosier, lying on him. He was an abbot, and probably of <HI>St. Alban's,</HI> for the abbots had a seat near this town <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland Itin.</HI> vi. 63.</NOTE>. The chancel appears to have been re∣built by abbot <HI>Whethamsted;</HI> whose motto, VAL LES HA BUN DA BUNT VAL LES, is to be seen on the walls.</P>
<P>PART of this place was said to have been bestowed by king <HI>Offa</HI> on the monks of <HI>St. Alban's, Gilbert de Clare</HI> earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> had the patronage of the church; which they bought from him in 1166, for eighty marks, and kept in their own hands, till they were compelled to appoint a vicar. The purchase was in the time of abbot <HI>Robert</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chauncy,</HI> 438.</NOTE>. It appears that this place, <HI>Houghton,</HI> and <HI>Potesgrave,</HI> had been bestowed on the monastery, for the support of the kitchen for the guests. This is seen in the charter of con∣firmation, made by king <HI>John,</HI> in the first year of his reign <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Man.</HI> i. 179. <HI>Henry</HI> I. had confirmed the same. In his charter the names are mis-spelt. See <HI>Chauncy,</HI> 434.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The church is dedicated to St. <HI>Mary,</HI> and is a vicarage in the gift of the earl of <HI>Bute.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Luton Ho,</HI> the seat of that nobleman, lies near the <HI>London</HI> road; <NOTE PLACE="marg">LUTON HO.</NOTE> about three miles from the town. I lament my inability to

record his taste and magnificence; but alas! the useful, talent, <HI>Principibus placuisse viris,</HI> has been unfortunately denied to me. I must therefore relate the antient story of the favored spot. In the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> I. it was possessed by <HI>Robert,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chauncy,</HI> 352.</NOTE> who took the addition of <HI>de Hoo,</HI> from the place; which signifies a high situ∣ation. His grandson, <HI>Thomas,</HI> was created lord <HI>Hoo</HI> and <HI>Hastings,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> VI. in 1447. He, if no mistake is made in the ac∣count, settled two parts of the tithes on the abbey of <HI>St. Alban's,</HI> for the use of strangers. Lord <HI>Hoo</HI> left only daughters. From one, who married Sir <HI>Geofry Bullen,</HI> was descended queen <HI>Eliza∣beth.</HI> I do not discover the time in which the tower in <HI>Luton Park</HI> was built. It is an antient structure, of flint and <HI>Tottenhoe</HI>-stone intermixed.</P>
<P>ABOUT two miles to the north-east of <HI>Luton Hoo,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SOMMERIS.</NOTE> is the village of <HI>Sommeris,</HI> where, as <HI>Leland</HI> informs us, lord <HI>Wenlock</HI> had begun sumptuously a house, but never finished it: that the gatehouse of brick was very fair and large. The gateway and part of a tower are yet to be seen. In the last are fourteen or fifteen brick steps; and there was originally a hole, or rather pipe, which conveyed the lowest whisper from bottom to top. Part of this, and of the other building, was pulled down by Sir <HI>John Napier,</HI> about forty years ago. <HI>Leland</HI> also acquaints us, that these estates of lord <HI>Wenlock</HI> passed, by marriage of an heir general <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland,</HI> vi. 63.</NOTE> of his, to a relation of <HI>Thomas Scot,</HI> alias <HI>Rotherham,</HI> archbishop of <HI>York</HI> from 1480 to 1500: a prelate remarkable for nepotism, and the prefer∣ment of his kindred by marriage, and other ways <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Goodwin Pros. Angl.</HI> 70.</NOTE>. This family assumed the name of <HI>Rotherham,</HI> and flourished here for some cen∣turies.
<PB N="401" REF="438"/>
<HI>John</HI> was sheriff of the county in the seventeenth of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> IV. and others, in after-times, enjoyed the same honor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fuller's British Worthies,</HI> 123, 124.</NOTE>. <HI>Luton Hoe</HI> and this place became the property of the <HI>Napiers;</HI> from them they passed to Mr. <HI>Hearn,</HI> who sold them to the earl of <HI>Bute.</HI></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Luton</HI> I pursued my journey southward: near the twenty-sixth mile-stone, passed through the village of <HI>Hardin,</HI> or <HI>Har∣pedon,</HI> and by its chapel, dependent on <HI>Whethamsted.</HI> This manor belonged, in 1292, to <HI>Robert Hoo,</HI> and continued in his line till the death of <HI>Thomas</HI> lord <HI>Hoo</HI> and <HI>Hastings,</HI> about the latter end of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI; when it devolved to his three daughters <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chauncy,</HI> 525.</NOTE>. The manor was sold soon after their marriages to <HI>Matthew Cressy,</HI> in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. It continued in his line till the reign of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when, by the marriage of a female descendant, it fell to the <HI>Bardolfs. Richard Bardolf</HI> sold it to Sir <HI>John Witherong,</HI> created baronet in 1662; and it is now possessed by <HI>John Bennet,</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P>ABOUT four miles from this village, passed through <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s street, in ST. ALBAN'S, and turning towards the east, after a ride of about five miles, reach the small town of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">HATFIELD.</NOTE> prettily seated on a gentle ascent. Its <HI>Saxon</HI> name was <HI>Haethfeld,</HI> from its situation on a heath. The important synod, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SYNOD.</NOTE> held during the heptarchy, at the instance of <HI>Theodore,</HI> consecrated archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in 668, in which the most interesting tenets of Christianity were declared and confirmed <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Beda,</HI> lib. iv. c. 17. p, 160. <HI>Beda</HI> had been an eleve of this venerable archbishop.</NOTE>, is generally sup∣posed
<PB N="402" REF="439"/>
to have been held at a place of the same name in <HI>York∣shire. Hatfield</HI> was part of the revenues of the <HI>Saxon</HI> princes, till it was bestowed by <HI>Edgar</HI> on the monastery of <HI>Ely.</HI> At the time of the Conquest, it was found to be in the possession of that great house; in which it continued, till that abbey was converted into a bishopric, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> I. It then became one of the resi∣dences of the prelates; for they had not fewer than ten palaces be∣longing to the see <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bentham's Ely,</HI> 163.</NOTE>; and from that was called <HI>Bishop's Halfield,</HI> to distinguish it from other places of the same name. It probably fell into decay during the long wars between the houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster;</HI> for I find it was rebuilt and ornamented by bishop <HI>Morton,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. 181.</NOTE> Among the shameful alienations made from the bishopric of <HI>Ely,</HI> by queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (by virtue of the imprudent statute, which gave her power of ex∣changes over all) must be included the manor of <HI>Hatfield.</HI> The palace had at times been an occasional royal residence, notwith∣standing it was the property of the church. <HI>William,</HI> second son of <HI>Edward</HI> III. was born here in 1335, and was called, from that circumstance, <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Hatfield.</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> resided here many years before she came to the crown <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See the curious account of the practices of the lord admiral on her at this place, in 1548, in <HI>Burghley's State Papers,</HI> 99, 100.</NOTE>; and, on the death of her predecessor, removed from hence, on the 23d of <HI>No∣vember,</HI> to take possession of the throne. This place did not continue long a part of the royal demesne. <HI>James</HI> I. in the fifth year of his reign, exchanged it for <HI>Theobalds,</HI> with his mi∣nister, Sir <HI>Robert Cecil,</HI> afterwards earl of <HI>Salisbury;</HI> who built,
<PB N="403" REF="440"/>
on the site of the palace, the magnificent house now standing; and inclosed two large parks, one for red, the other for fallow deer. At the bottom of the first was a vineyard, in being when <HI>Charles</HI> I. was conveyed there a prisoner to the army <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herbert's Memoirs,</HI> 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE building is of brick, and of vast extent; <NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUSE.</NOTE> in form of an half H. In the center is an extensive portico of nine arches: over the middlemost rises a lofty tower, on the front of which is the date 1611, and three ranges of columns, of the Tuscan, Doric, and Composite orders. Between the second are the arms of the family, in stone <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Among <HI>Kip's Views</HI> is one of this house, engraven from a drawing by <HI>Thomas Sadler,</HI> Esquire.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the chapel is a small antient organ; <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPEL.</NOTE> a fine window of stained glass, in twelve compartments; and a gallery, on the front of which are painted the twelve apostles.</P>
<P>OVER the chimney-piece of the hall is a painting of a great clumsy grey horse, <NOTE PLACE="marg">HALL.</NOTE> given by queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to Sir <HI>Robert:</HI> a sign our breed was at that time far from excellent.</P>

He had been in two reigns so supple a courtier, as to over-act every thing he was required to do.

<P>OVER the chimney a fine half-length of lady <HI>Latimer,</HI> by <HI>Lely.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">CURIOUS HISTO∣RICAL PIECE.</NOTE> IN the dressing-room is a picture, on board, uncommonly cu∣rious; a representation of some of the amusements of the court of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who often relaxed his savage disposition in little pro∣gresses about the neighborhood of the metropolis.

<P>THERE are great numbers of other figures; many of which appear to have been portraits. In one group is a lady with a gold chain, between two men with white beards. The utmost festivity is exhibited. There are four fiddlers, and a number of dancers. Behind the king is his 'squire, carrying his dagger and buckler; and near <HI>Henry</HI> are a boy and a girl; perhaps the chil∣dren of <HI>Charles Brandon,</HI> by the king's sister, <HI>Mary</HI> dowager of <HI>France;</HI> for at this time <HI>Henry</HI> had only one child, <HI>Mary,</HI> after∣wards

<P>OTHER figures are, a man on foot, with a buckler on his back: a yeoman of the guard, in red, with a rose and crown on his breast: five figures on horseback; the first with a hawk on his hand, and a portmanteau before him; the second on a bay horse, followed by a lady on horseback; after her a cavalier with another lady behind him.</P>

<P>THE portrait of queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> is extremely worth notice; <NOTE PLACE="marg">QUEEN ELIZABETH.</NOTE> not only because it is the handsomest we have of her, but as it points out her turn to allegory and apt devices. Her gown is close-bodied: on her head is a coronet and long aigret, and a long distended gauze veil: her face is young; her hair yellow, falling in two long tresses; her neck adorned with a pearl neck∣lace, her arms with bracelets. The lining of her robe is worked with eyes and ears, and on her left sleeve is embroidered a ser∣pent: all to imply wisdom and vigilance. In the other hand is a rainbow, with this flattering motto, "<HI>Non</HI> sine <HI>sole</HI> IRIS."</P>
<P>IN the gallery, <NOTE PLACE="marg">THE GALLERY.</NOTE> which is a hundred and twenty feet long, are two vast marble chimney-pieces. The portrait furniture are, first, a curious half-length of the first earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> in mosaic.</P>

Their passion seems to have been of the seraphic kind. She devoted herself to religion, and persuaded him to do the same. She died in the convent of the <HI>Cordeliers,</HI> in <HI>Avignon, April</HI> 6th, 1348: he, in 1374, in <HI>Italy,</HI> his native country; to which he had retired after the loss of <HI>Laura.</HI> Her age was probably about forty; his seventy. Both of them be∣came the subject of the finest pens for centuries after their deaths. <HI>Francis</HI> I. celebrates her memory in a beautiful epitaph. The tender and amorous earl of <HI>Surrey</HI> made them the subjects of two sonnets <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Songes, &amp;c.</HI> ed. 1585, p. 74.</NOTE>.

She signalized herself, during life, by her piety, charity, hu∣mility, and chastity. The first appeared in her rigorous attendance on the duties of the church, and her admittance into the fraternity of five religious houses: the second, in her noble foundations of <HI>Christ College</HI> and that of <HI>St. John,</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> besides a number of other great deeds of charity: the third, in her declaration, that, <Q>if the princes of <HI>Christendom</HI> would undertake a crusade, she would chearfully be the laundress of the army:</Q> and then, for her chastity, in her last husband's days she obtained a licence from him to live chaste, and took the vow of celibacy from bishop <HI>Fisher</HI>'s hands, at the age of sixty-four.

This little beast, being an emblem of chastity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gwillim's Heraldry,</HI> 14.</NOTE>, is placed here as a compliment to the virgin queen.</P>
<P>SINCE this account of these pictures was taken, they have been differently arranged. I have the pleasure to learn, that the house has undergone a complete repair, in the original stile, under the conduct of Mr. <HI>Donowell,</HI> the architect; the pictures have been re∣paired by Mr. <HI>Tomkins;</HI> the grounds disposed in the modern taste; a considerable tract of road is going to be removed to a proper distance from the park; and the splendor of this noble family is reviving with all the magnificence of the <HI>Cecils.</HI></P>
<P>THE church is dedicated to St. <HI>Ethelreda.</HI> In an adjoining chapel is a beautiful monument to the first earl of Salis∣bury; <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> who is represented in his robes, in white marble, lying on a slab of black, which is supported by the four cardinal
<PB N="412" REF="449"/>
Virtues, with their attributes. Beneath, is a skeleton, in white marble, lying on a well-counterfeited mat of the same, also placed on a slab of black marble.</P>
<P>IN the church is a monument of Sir <HI>John Brocket</HI> of <HI>Brocket Hall,</HI> knight, who died in 1598: and not far from him are the figures of two ladies: one is his first wife, <HI>Helen Litton;</HI> the other a younger figure, with a scull in her hand, representing his second lady, widow of <HI>Gabriel Fowler.</HI> Both lie on their sides, one above the other.</P>
<P>FROM hence I continued my journey along the great road; <NOTE PLACE="marg">GOBIONS.</NOTE> passed by <HI>Gobions,</HI> in the parish of <HI>North Mims.</HI> It took its name from the old family of the <HI>Gobions,</HI> its antient lords, as early as the time of king <HI>Stephen.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Salmon's Herts,</HI> 46.</NOTE> The <HI>Mores</HI> afterwards possessed it for some generations. Sir <HI>John,</HI> the father of the celebrated Sir <HI>Tho∣mas More,</HI> owned it in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII; and it became the residence of that illustrious character till the time of his cruel sacrifice; when the son was stripped of every part of his fortune, by the most arbitrary attainders. It reverted again to the fa∣mily; but the grandson of Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> being ruined by the civil wars, sold it to Sir <HI>Edward Desbovery.</HI> It afterwards passed, by sale, to Mr. <HI>Pitchford,</HI> and to Sir <HI>Jeremiah Sambroke.</HI> From his sisters it devolved to Mr. <HI>Freeman</HI> of <HI>Hammels;</HI> and was after∣wards sold to the present owner, Mr. <HI>Hunter.</HI></P>
<P>NOT far from a place called <HI>Potters Bar</HI> (probably from some pottery, such as is still carried on at <HI>Woodside,</HI> about two

miles to the north, on the same road) I entered the coun∣ty of MIDDLESEX: kept along the edge of <HI>Enfield Chace</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This chace was inclosed by act of parliament, 1779; and of the 8000 acres whereof it consisted, 2584 were appropriated to the use of the Crown, and the re∣sidue divided between the four adjoining parishes of <HI>Enfield, Edmonton, Hadley,</HI> and <HI>South Mims.</HI></NOTE> to <HI>Hadley;</HI> passed through <HI>Cheping Barnet,</HI> and, in less than a mile beyond, quitted the great road at <HI>Pricklers Hill;</HI> again skirted the <HI>Chace,</HI> descended <HI>Winch∣more Hill,</HI> and concluded the day's journey at my friend RICHARD GOUGH'S, Esquire, at <HI>Enfield,</HI> the object of this little digression.</P>
<P>THE New River, <NOTE PLACE="marg">NEW RIVER.</NOTE> the work of my illustrious countryman Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See some account of it in my <HI>Welsh Tour,</HI> vol. ii. p. 29.</NOTE> (which on the north edge of this parish, for some yards, as till lately at <HI>Islington,</HI> is conveyed in a trough of wood lined with lead, called <HI>The Boarded River,</HI> over a brick arch fifteen feet high) was the first object of my attention.</P>
<P>I NEXT visited the antient brick house called <HI>Enfield Palace,</HI> built by Sir <HI>Thomas Lovel,</HI> knight of the Garter, and privy coun∣sellor to <HI>Henry</HI> VII; where he died in 1524 <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Camden,</HI> i. 398.</NOTE>.

It is now divided into several dwellings.</NOTE>. Here <HI>Edward</HI> VI. received the first news of his father's death, and his own accession. On the chimney-piece of the great parlour are the arms of <HI>England</HI> in a Garter, supported by a Lion and a

Griffin; on the sides, the Rose and Portcullis crowned; with E. R. beneath. These initials are also on the stucco in front of the house.</P>
<P>QUEEN <HI>Elizabeth</HI> used sometimes to make this place a visit. <HI>Robert Cary</HI> earl of <HI>Monmouth</HI> informs us he once waited on her Highness at this place; where she went to take a dinner, and had toiles set up in the park, to shoot at bucks, after she had dined <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His <HI>Memoirs,</HI> 2d edit. p. 136.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the time of the great plague, in 1665, a very flourishing school was kept here by Mr. <HI>Uvedale.</HI> That gentleman was very fond of gardening, and, among other trees, <NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT CEDAR.</NOTE> planted here a cedar of <HI>Libanus;</HI> which is still in being. The storm of 1703 broke off eight feet of the top. The dimensions of it at present are these:</P>

<P>NOT far from hence, on the north side of <HI>Fourtree-hill,</HI> stood <HI>Worcester House,</HI> built by the accomplished <HI>John Tibetot,</HI> or <HI>Tiptoft,</HI> earl of <HI>Worcester</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Norden's Middlesex,</HI> 19.</NOTE>, who was beheaded in 1470. The manor, which still retains his title, descended to him from his father, Sir <HI>John Tiptoft.</HI> The house was rebuilt on higher ground,
<PB N="415" REF="452"/>
by Sir <HI>Nicholas Raynton,</HI> knight, lord mayor of <HI>London</HI> in 1640<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who died in 1647, and has a splendid monument in <HI>Enfield</HI> church. The place is now owned by <HI>Eliab Breton,</HI> Esquire, who married a co-heiress of the <HI>Raynton</HI> and <HI>Wolstenholme</HI> families.</P>
<P>UNDER the conduct of my friend before mentioned, I made a visit to <HI>Waltham Abbey,</HI> seated in ESSEX, about three miles from <HI>Enfield,</HI> on the west side of the river <HI>Lea.</HI> I past by <HI>Waltham Cross,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">WALTHAM CROSS.</NOTE> one of the affectionate memorials of <HI>Edward</HI> I. towards his beloved queen <HI>Eleanor.</HI> The cross is in excellent preservation, and richly adorned with gothic sculpture. This tract is a rich flat of verdant meadows, watered by the <HI>Lea,</HI> and bounded on each side by gentle risings. The meads belonging to the abbey are distinguished by the name of <HI>Halifield,</HI> or <HI>The holy field.</HI></P>
<P>THE present church of <HI>Waltham</HI> is only the nave of the antient structure, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> which was in form of a cross, with a central tower; which fell down after the dissolution, and the new tower was built at one end, 1555. Within are six massy pillars; some carved with spiral, others with zigzag furrows, like those of the nave of <HI>Durham</HI> cathedral. The arches are round; above them two rows of galleries, in what is called the <HI>Saxon</HI> stile. At the east end remains one vast round arch of the tower.</P>
<P>THE only monuments of any note, are those of the <HI>Dennies.</HI> That of Sir <HI>Edward Denny,</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI> his wife, has on it their figures, in a reclined posture; he in armour: and in front are the figures of six of their sons and four of their daughters kneel∣ing. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was of the privy chamber to queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> governor of <HI>Kerry</HI> and <HI>Desmonde,</HI> and colonel of some <HI>Irish</HI> forces. He died in 1599, aged about fifty-two; and, I hope, merited this eulogy inscribed on the tomb:
<Q><PB N="415" REF="453"/>
<L>Learn, carious reader, how you pass;</L>
<L>Your once Sir <HI>Edward Denny</HI> was</L>
<L>A courtier of the chamber,</L>
<L>A soldier of the field;</L>
<L>Whose tongue could never flatter;</L>
<L>Whose heart could never yealde.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE tombs of earl <HI>Harold,</HI> founder of the abbey; of the famous <HI>Hugo Nevill,</HI> who slew a lion in the Holy Land; and of several others, are now lost; having perished with the fall of the tower on the eastern part of the church, in which they were placed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Weever,</HI> 644.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE abbey stood near the church. Its only remains are a gate and postern, with the arms of <HI>England</HI> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> III; part of a cloister; and an elliptic bridge over the moat. The edifice was pulled down after the dissolution, and the materials applied to building a mansion by Sir <HI>Anthony Denny</HI> (father of Sir <HI>Edward</HI>) to whom the place had been granted by <HI>Edward</HI> VI. His lady afterwards purchased the re∣version in see of <HI>Waltham</HI> manor, from the same prince, for be∣tween three and four thousand pounds, with several large pri∣vileges in the adjoining forest <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fuller's Hist. Waltham Abbey,</HI> 13.</NOTE>. This, and the great estate of the family, passed afterwards to the luxurious <HI>Hay</HI> earl of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> by his marriage with the heiress of <HI>Edward Denny</HI> earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> grandson of Sir <HI>Anthony.</HI> The fortune was soon dis∣sipated; and the estate sold by their heirs to Sir <HI>Samuel Jones</HI> of <HI>Northamptonshire;</HI> who gave it to the <HI>Wakes:</HI> and it is at present owned by Sir <HI>William Wake,</HI> baronet.</P>
<P>THE abbey was founded in 1062, <NOTE PLACE="marg">ABBEY.</NOTE> by earl <HI>Harold,</HI> afterwards king
<PB N="417" REF="454"/>
of <HI>England.</HI> It might more properly be stiled a college, being supplied by a dean and eleven secular black canons, who were excellently provided for; the dean having six manors, and each canon one. A copy of the charter of confirmation by <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor is preserved by Sir <HI>William Dugdale</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Monast.</HI> ii. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the battle of <HI>Hastings, Githa,</HI> the mother of <HI>Harold,</HI> and <HI>Osegod,</HI> and <HI>Ailric,</HI> by their prayers and tears moved the Con∣queror to deliver to them the corpse of the <HI>Saxon</HI> monarch, and of his brethren <HI>Girth</HI> and <HI>Leofwin,</HI> to be interred here. <HI>Harold</HI>'s tomb was of rich grey marble, with a cross fleury on it, and sup∣ported by four pedestals <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fuller's Waltham,</HI> 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> II. in 1177, changed the foundation into an abbot and regulars, of the order of St. <HI>Austin</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 119.</NOTE>. The first abbot was <HI>Walter de Gaunt;</HI> who obtained the privileges of the mitre, and of being exempt from episcopal jurisdiction <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis,</HI> i. 191.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Fuller</HI> was the last abbot; who, with seventeen of his re∣ligious, resigned the monastery to the king, <HI>March</HI> 23d, 1540. Their whole number was twenty-four. Their revenue, according to <HI>Dugdale,</HI> was £900. 4<HI>s.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> to <HI>Speed,</HI> £1079. 12<HI>s.</HI> 1<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>THE largest <HI>tulip-tree,</HI> I believe, in <HI>England,</HI> stands within the abbey precinct; being fourteen feet in circumference near the bottom.</P>
<P>FROM hence, at a distance, on a rising ground, I saw <HI>Copthall,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">COPTHALL.</NOTE> once a villa and park belonging to the abbots. <HI>Richard</HI> I. be∣stowed the lands on <HI>Richard Fitz-Auchor,</HI> to hold them in see, and hereditarily of the abbey. He fixed himself at this seat. At
<PB N="418" REF="455"/>
length the abbot became possessed of it, and retained it till the dissolution. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted it to Sir <HI>Thomas Heneage.</HI> His daughter, afterwards countess of <HI>Winchelsea,</HI> sold it to the earl of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> in the reign of <HI>James</HI> I. <HI>Charles</HI> earl of <HI>Dorset</HI> sold it, in 1700, to <HI>Thomas Webster,</HI> Esquire, created Baronet in 1703: and he sold it to <HI>Edward Conyers,</HI> Esquire, of <HI>Waltham∣stow;</HI> whose grandson, <HI>John,</HI> is the present possessor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Mr. <HI>Conyers</HI> took down the old house (of which a print may be seen in <HI>Farmer's History of Waltham Abbey</HI>) and built the present on a higher site, about thirty years ago. The beautiful east window in St. <HI>Margaret</HI>'s church at <HI>Westminster,</HI> came originally from the chapel of this old mansion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>RETURNING the same way over the <HI>Lea,</HI> I could not but re∣flect on the different appearance this tract made, to what it did in the days of king <HI>Alfred,</HI> when it was navigable for ships to the <HI>Thames,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ALFRED'S EXPLOITS IN 896.</NOTE> and by which the piratical <HI>Danish</HI> navy came up quite to <HI>Hertford.</HI> Our great monarch instantly set about frittering this vast water into various small streams; and, to the amazement of the free-booters, left their fleet on dry land <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Saxon Chr.</HI> 96. <HI>Chr. J. Bromton,</HI> 813.</NOTE>. At present a useful canal passes along the country.</P>
<P>CLOSE to <HI>Cheshunt</HI> stood the magnificent palace of <HI>Theobalds,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">THEOBALDS.</NOTE> built by lord treasurer <HI>Burleigh.</HI> When <HI>James</HI> I. came from <HI>Scot∣land</HI> to take possession of the <HI>English</HI> throne, on <HI>May</HI> 3d, 1603, he was received here by the lords of the privy council, and was most sumptuously entertained by the owner, Sir <HI>Robert Cecil,</HI> af∣terwards earl of <HI>Salisbury. James</HI> fell in love with, the place; obtained it from <HI>Cecil</HI> in exchange for <HI>Hatfield;</HI> enlarged the park, and inclosed it with a brick wall ten miles in circuit. The place was resigned to the king and queen, on the 22d of <HI>May</HI>
<PB N="419" REF="456"/>
1607. A poetical entertainment was made on the occasion, by <HI>Ben Jonson,</HI> and suitable scenery invented, in all probability by <HI>Inigo Jones</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> ii. 142.</NOTE>. The Genius of the place is at first very anxious about her lot; at last is reconciled to it by <HI>Mercury</HI> and the Fates: and the piece concludes with a most flattering chorus <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ben Jonson's Works,</HI> v. 226.</NOTE>. <HI>James</HI> was particularly fond of this palace, and finished his days here in 1625. In 1651, the greatest part of this magnificent place (so particularly described by <HI>Heutzner</HI>) was pulled down, and the plunder given to the soldiers. The small remains (such as the room in which the king died, and a portico with the painting of the genealogical tree of the house of <HI>Cecil</HI>) were demolished in 1765, by the present owner, <HI>George Prescot,</HI> Esquire; who leased out the site to a builder, and built himself a handsome house a mile south of it; so that the memory of it is only preserved by the picture in possession of earl <HI>Poulet,</HI> at <HI>Hinton St. George;</HI> and the description, from lord <HI>Bur∣leigh</HI>'s own hand-writing, preserved in <HI>Murden's State Papers</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. GOUCH'S <HI>Br.

<P>I RETURNED by <HI>Enfield,</HI> pursued the direct road to <HI>London,</HI> passed by <HI>Tottenham High Cross</HI> (so called from a wooden cross formerly placed on a little mount) and in a short space joined my friends in the great metropolis.</P>

<HEAD>N<SUP>o</SUP> V. ON THE DEATH OF THE COUNTESS OF SOMERSET. See p. 372.</HEAD>
<Q>HER death was infamous: and though she died (as it were) in a corner (in so private a condition) the loathsomeness of her death made it as conspicuous as on a house-top: for that part of her body which had been the re∣ceptacle of most of her sin, grown rotten (though she never had but one child) the ligaments failing, it fell down, and was cut away in flakes, with a most nauseous and putrid savour; which to augment, she would roll herself in her own ordure in her bed; took delight in it. Thus her affections varied; for nothing could be found sweet enough to augment her beauties at first, and nothing stinking enough to decypher her loath∣someness at last. Pardon the sharpness of these expressions; for they are for the glory of God; who often makes his pu∣nishments (in the balance of his justice) of equal weight with our sins. <BIBL><HI>Wilson's Life of King James I.</HI> p. 83.</BIBL></Q>

<HEAD>N<SUP>o</SUP> VIII. EPITAPH IN FLITTON CHURCH, ON THE GOOD COUNTESS OF KENT. p. 394.</HEAD>
<P>HERE lyes the Right Hon<SUP>ble</SUP>. <HI>Amabella,</HI> late countess dowager of <HI>Kent,</HI> entombed by her dear lord <HI>Henry</HI> earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> to signifie her resolution to dye with him to the rest of y<SUP>e</SUP> world, and to live after so great a loss only to God, &amp; the interest of this noble family. This she made good, by her exemplary piety &amp; regular devotion in her chappel; whereto she obliged all her domesticks, every morning &amp; evening, to attend her.</P>
<P>And, surviving her own monument 45 years, she had time to raise to herself a more lasting one, by restoring the fortune of this illustrious family, which she found under an eclipse, to near the height of it's antient splendour.</P>
<P>This she effected by her wise conduct &amp; large acquisitions, &amp; by the advantageous disposal of her only son <HI>Anthony</HI> earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> in marriage, with <HI>Mary,</HI> sole daughter and heiress of the R<SUP>t</SUP>. Hon<SUP>ble</SUP>. <HI>John</HI> lord <HI>Lucas,</HI> baron of <HI>Shenfield,</HI> in <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
<P>To the concerns of her children &amp; grandchildren she confined her thoughts; &amp; fixed her residence at <HI>Wrest,</HI> their usual seat; which she wonderfully improved &amp; imbellished; continually adding to the profit or ornament of the place, until death gently seiz'd her, <HI>Aug<SUP>st</SUP>.</HI> 17<SUP>th</SUP>, 1698, in the 92<SUP>d</SUP> year of her age; &amp; was here interred by the R<SUP>t</SUP>. Hon<SUP>ble</SUP> <HI>Anthony</HI> earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> her most
<PB N="452" REF="489"/>
dutiful son; who would have caused y<SUP>•</SUP> to be engraven, had not a sudden death prevented him; but it was afterwards performed, in due acknowledgement of her great beneficence, &amp; to per∣petuate her precious memory to all his posterity, by her grand∣son, Henry Duke of Kent.</P>
<P><HI>Mary,</HI> one of the daughters of Sir <HI>George Cotton</HI> of <HI>Combermere,</HI> in y<SUP>•</SUP> county of <HI>Chester,</HI> knight, first espowsed to <HI>Edward</HI> earle of <HI>Derby,</HI> &amp; after, to this <HI>Henry</HI> earle of <HI>Kent;</HI> who deceased the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>November,</HI> in the yeare of our Lord God 1580, and lieth bu∣ried at <HI>Great Gaddesden,</HI> in the covnty of <HI>Hertford.</HI> In tender af∣fection &amp; good respect of w<SUP>t</SUP> lady, the said earle of <HI>Kent,</HI> her husband, caused this remembrance to be made of her.</P>
