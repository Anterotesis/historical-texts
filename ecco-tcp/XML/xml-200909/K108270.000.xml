<P>REMARKS On the Opinions of some of The most celebrated Writers on CROWN LAW, Respecting the due Distinction between MANSLAUGHTER and MURDER:</P>
<P>Being an attempt to shew</P>
<P>That the plea of <HI>sudden Anger</HI> cannot remove the imputa∣tion and guilt of <HI>Murder,</HI> when a <HI>Mortal Wound</HI> is wil∣fully given <HI>with a weapon:</HI></P>
<P>That the indulgence allowed by the Courts to <HI>voluntary Manslaughter</HI> in Rencounters, and in sudden Affrays and Duels, is <HI>indiscriminate,</HI> and without foundation in Law:</P>
<P>And that <HI>impunity</HI> in such cases of <HI>voluntary Manslaughter</HI> is one of the principal causes of the continuance and pre∣sent increase of the <HI>base</HI> and <HI>disgraceful</HI> practice of Duelling.</P>
<P>To which are added some thoughts on the particular case of <HI>the Gentlemen of the Army</HI> when involved in such disa∣greeable <HI>private</HI> differences.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>UNIVERSAL BENEVOLENCE, including <HI>gentleness, patience</HI> and an unaf∣fected <HI>placability</HI> in our behaviour, even to∣wards those men who injure and affront us, is manifestly required of all men, who profess the true religion; and yet, unhappily for the Christian world, this most obvious doc∣trine of the <HI>gospel of peace,</HI> is too com∣monly either misunderstood, or else abso∣lutely rejected, though the <HI>temporal</HI> as well as the <HI>eternal happiness</HI> of mankind, greatly depends upon a conscientious and proper observation of it. For a man can∣not be a true Christian without observing this doctrine; and yet, so generally received is the opposite and contradictory doctrine, concerning the necessity of revenging every personal affront with sword and pistol, for
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>the sake of, what is falsely called, <HI>honour,</HI> that a true Christian is rarely to be met with! Nay, we are fallen into such gross depravity, that the writer of a late pub∣lication on <HI>"the principles of penal law,"</HI> has ventured to assert, (though he is in other respects, as I am informed, a sensible and in∣genious young gentleman) that <Q>the judge condemns the duellist, whilst he scarcely knows how in his own heart to disap∣prove his behaviour.</Q> (p. <HI>224.</HI>) So that one would suppose Christianity to be almost entirely extinct amongst us, if its principles are so little regarded, <HI>even in our courts of justice,</HI> where they ought to be held most sacred. My readers, perhaps, will start at such an idea in these enlightened days of reformation; but I will even go further, and venture to assert, that the Europeans not only cease to be Christians, but will no longer deserve the name even of
<PB N="v" REF="6"/><HI>men,</HI> if they persist in such a brutal and diabolical contradiction to the most indis∣pensible principles of the laws of God and nature: for nothing deserves to be esteemed <HI>human</HI> that is <HI>unreasonable;</HI> and the de∣pravity, of which I complain, is not only in∣compatible with the laws of God, but ab∣solutely inconsistent with <HI>common sense.</HI></P>
<P>Let us view the character of the <HI>mo∣dern man of honour</HI> (falsely so called) who thinks it inconsistent with his reputa∣tion, to pass over a personal affront with that Christian submission, which the gospel requires of all men, without exception.</P>
<P>Such an one perhaps will alledge, that his <HI>honour</HI> obliges him, whenever he re∣ceives an affront, to <HI>call out</HI> his adver∣sary, or <HI>to accept his challenge,</HI> lest his <HI>courage</HI> should be questioned; and therefore in such case, the one must give, and the other take, what is commonly called
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/><HI>gentleman-like Satisfaction.</HI> But let us examine this perversion of words. The <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to both parties is the risk both of <HI>body</HI> and <HI>soul,</HI> in the perpetration of a most <HI>dishonourable, base,</HI> and <HI>cow∣ardly felony;</HI> which cannot, therefore, be <HI>gentleman-like,</HI> whatever the <HI>satisfaction</HI> of it may be. It is <HI>Felony;</HI> because no man can give, or accept, a challenge, with∣out being guilty of <HI>Wilful Murder,</HI> if he <HI>kills</HI> his antagonist; which I hope is proved in the course of the following tract.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is <HI>dishonourable,</HI> because it is an open violation of the indispensible prin∣ciples enjoined in the two great command∣ments of the supreme Law, viz. the <HI>love of God,</HI> and the <HI>love of our neighbour:</HI> for, in this respect, the offender is upon the same foot∣ing as culprits for <HI>burglary, theft,</HI> or any other felony; the <Q><HI>not having the fear of God before his eyes,</HI></Q> being equally
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>applicable to all of them; and the common law of England esteems no man qualified to be a member of society, who wants this principle. The act is therefore highly <HI>dis∣honourable;</HI> and to use a still more humi∣liating term of the same import, I must ob∣serve, Thirdly, that it is also <HI>base;</HI> because it affords the most apparent proof of a <HI>little Soul</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><Q>Nec Christiani veteres hoc tantum viderunt, sed et philosophi, qui dixerunt <HI>pusilli esse animi con∣tumeliam ferre non posse,</HI> ut alibi ostendimus,</Q> says the learned Grotius, in his 2d book De jure Belli et Pacis, p. 172.</NOTE>; being, <HI>in reality,</HI> a <HI>brutal</HI> revenge; <HI>brutal</HI> because <HI>unreasonable;</HI> (for how can <HI>Honour</HI> be vindicated or retrieved by the com∣mission of a <HI>notorious Felony?)</HI> and what is <HI>unreasonable,</HI> must be disgraceful to hu∣man nature, and therefore is truly <HI>base.</HI> And lastly, it is <HI>cowardly,</HI> (that is, when it can∣not be imputed to <HI>Ignorance</HI> or <HI>Folly</HI>) be∣cause a man submits to it contrary to the light of his own reason, <HI>for fear</HI> his <HI>courage</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>should be called in question; and yet <HI>he has not courage enough</HI> to withstand the bar∣barous prejudices of a depraved world, lest he should suffer some temporal inconvenien∣cies: and <HI>the slavish Fear</HI> which he enter∣tains of these (for <HI>cowards</HI> always dread the present evil most) deprives him of that <HI>reasonable fear,</HI> which he ought to entertain of God's judgment, because he thinks it at a distance, though, he knows, it must inevita∣bly follow!—I condemn no man in particular; God forbid! I speak of the question only in ge∣neral: inveterate prejudices and customs may perhaps afford some excuse in particular cases to some <HI>Individuals,</HI> who have <HI>igno∣rantly</HI> yielded thereto: but as <HI>ignorance</HI> is disgraceful to <HI>humanity,</HI> I sincerely wish that all persons may enter into as careful an examination of this question as I have done, by which they will not only be enabled to avoid a repetition of their crime, but also
<PB N="ix" REF="10"/>be prevented from attempting to defend what is past, and thereby afford the best proof of an ingenuous and honourable heart.</P>
<P>This abominable practice of duelling, which of late years has increased to a most alarming degree, may chiefly be attributed (I humbly conceive) to the improper indul∣gence which our English courts of justice, for about two centuries back, have shewn to persons <HI>convicted of killing in sudden affrays and rencounters,</HI> through a false idea of mercy due to human frailty, in cases of <HI>sudden provocation</HI> without pre∣serving the proper distinction of those cases wherein homicide, in <HI>sudden anger,</HI> is really excusable by the laws of God, and of this kingdom; and the improper precedents, which have arisen from this <HI>indiscriminate and corrupt practice,</HI> have so misled the more modern writers on <HI>Crown Law,</HI> that
<PB N="x" REF="11"/>even the greatest and most respectable of them have been unhappily induced to admit doctrines on the subject of Manslaughter, which are absolutely incompatible with the <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>necessary distinctions</HI> to be ob∣served between <HI>wilful murder</HI> and <HI>man∣slaughter,</HI> which they themselves have laid down in other parts of their works: and it is on the authority of these just <HI>distinctions,</HI> with the necessary consequences arising therefrom, (and not on my own presumption,) that this censure is founded; which the following tract I hope will clearly demon∣strate.</P>
<P>But as my readers might seem to give too much credit to an inconsiderable person like myself, were they, (without a previous intimation of what is proposed,) to risque any loss of time in the perusal of the argu∣ments and proofs at large, on which my
<PB N="xi" REF="12"/>vindication for this attempt depends, I think it my duty to state the subject and intention of the tract, as briefly as I can, in this pre∣fatory address, that my readers may, thereby, be enabled to judge, without much loss of time, whether the matter is of suf∣ficient consequence to merit any more of their attention.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned my opinion, that <Q>No man can give or accept a chal∣lenge to fight <HI>with weapons,</HI> on any private difference whatever, without being guilty of <HI>wilful murder</HI> if he <HI>kills</HI> his antagonist.</Q> And the intention of the following tract is to shew, that the writers on Crown Law have no just war∣rant for admitting the contrary doctrines, which they have laid down concerning <HI>sud∣den affrays</HI> and <HI>rencountres,</HI> viz. that <HI>the voluntary killing</HI> of a man on a <HI>sudden
<PB N="xii" REF="13"/>provocation</HI> is only to be esteemed <HI>Man∣slaughter,</HI> and, as such, is intitled to the be∣nefit of clergy. And they have also supposed that <HI>an assault</HI> is a sufficient provocation to justify a <HI>voluntary manslaughter.</HI></P>
<P>Now, certain it is, that some allow∣ance ought to be made for heat of blood upon a <HI>sudden provocation,</HI> in considera∣tion of the extreme frailty of human na∣ture, provided that there are no circum∣stances of <HI>malice</HI> in the case. As if (for in∣stance) a man, <HI>in sudden anger,</HI> should strike another, merely <HI>with his fist,</HI> or a small <HI>cane,</HI> or <HI>stick,</HI> meaning only to correct, and should <HI>accidentally kill;</HI> this would be, properly, <HI>manslaughter;</HI> which, tho' it is deemed <HI>Felony</HI> (as the act of striking, or beating another person is, in itself, <HI>unlaw∣ful,</HI>) is nevertheless <HI>pardonable</HI> both by the laws of God and man. But when two persons fight with <HI>dangerous weapons,</HI> an
<PB N="xiii" REF="14"/><HI>intention of killing</HI> is <HI>expressed</HI> by the <HI>weapons;</HI> and <HI>such intention</HI> renders the manslaughter <HI>voluntary,</HI> which is the same thing as <HI>wilful;</HI> and consequently the <HI>"ma∣lice prepensed"</HI> (which excludes the be∣nefit of clergy) is necessarily <HI>implied,</HI> though the sudden anger be but a moment before the fatal stroke; for <HI>"malice prepensed"</HI> is thus defined by Sir Edward Coke, <Q>That is (says he) <HI>voluntary,</HI> and of set pur∣pose, though done <HI>upon a sudden occa∣sion:</HI> for if it be <HI>voluntary</HI> the law implieth <HI>malice.</HI></Q><HI>3</HI> Inst. <HI>c. xiii. p. 62.</HI></P>
<P>And yet the same great lawyer in p. <HI>55,</HI> speaks of <HI>voluntary manslaughter</HI> upon <HI>some sudden falling out,</HI> as distinct from <HI>murder;</HI> which cannot, in reason, be true; for if the <HI>killing be voluntary,</HI> the evil and <HI>malicious intention</HI> is necessarily in∣cluded in the act, even though the fatal blow be given merely with <HI>the hand,</HI> or a
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"/><HI>small cane</HI> or <HI>stick,</HI> which I have before mentioned as pardonable cases, when the <HI>killing</HI> is not intended; for a <HI>voluntary striking,</HI> without intention to kill, is indeed pardonable, though death ensues; but a <HI>vo∣luntary killing</HI> is so far from being so, that the law, according to lord Coke's own rule, <HI>implieth malice;</HI> and, consequently, the same must, necessarily, be esteemed <HI>Murder,</HI> and not meerly <HI>Manslaughter;</HI> because the necessary marks, whereby <HI>manslaughter</HI> ought to be distinguished, are absolutely wanting therein: for <HI>manslaughter</HI> must be "without <HI>malice</HI> express or implied" (<HI>1</HI> Hale <HI>466. 4</HI> Blackstone <HI>191</HI>) "<HI>Murder</HI> being ag∣gravated" (says lord Hale) <Q>with malice presumed or <HI>implied,</HI> but manslaughter not.</Q> And yet all these great and excel∣lent lawyers have unhappily fallen into the same error of treating the <HI>voluntary branch</HI> of killing, as bare <HI>Homicide,</HI> or <HI>manslaugh∣ter;</HI>
<PB N="xv" REF="16"/>whereas, all the oldest writers agree, that <HI>killing</HI> is pardonable only in cases <HI>of inevi∣table necessity</HI> (Bracton, lib. <HI>iii.</HI> c. <HI>4.</HI> p. <HI>120.</HI> b. Fleta lib. <HI>i.</HI> c. <HI>23.</HI>) And the learned judge Staunford says <Q>That the whole matter consists in the <HI>inevitable necessity;</HI> without which the <HI>killing</HI> is by <HI>no means excusable,</HI> (n'est ascun voi excus∣able.</Q> P. C. lib. <HI>i.</HI> c. <HI>7.</HI>)</P>
<P>Now, the absurd and depraved notions of <HI>honour,</HI> and <HI>gentleman-like satisfaction,</HI> of which I complain, could not possibly exist, if every conqueror in a duel, who kills his antagonist, was sure of being <HI>hanged up</HI> as an ignominious <HI>felon,</HI> for his own <HI>gentleman-like satisfaction;</HI> and there∣fore I apprehend, that the diabolical practice of settling private differences with sword and pistol is chiefly to be attributed to the want of punishment due to <HI>voluntary man∣slaughter,</HI> through the mistaken concessions of the Writers on Crown Law, and the false
<PB N="xvi" REF="17"/>mercy of Juries, in consideration of <HI>sudden anger;</HI> because <HI>impunity</HI> fosters vice and depravity; but more especially in cases of <HI>wilful manslaughter,</HI> impunity ought to be esteemed the bane of society; as <HI>the guilt of blood</HI> is thereby thrown upon a whole na∣tion or country; for it is a supreme law, that <Q>whoso sheddeth <HI>man's blood,</HI> by <HI>man</HI> shall <HI>his blood</HI> be shed.</Q> Gen. <HI>ix. 6.</HI> And I hope I have proved by incontrovertable extracts from the laws of God, that the said judgment is inevitably incurred by all <HI>voluntary killing,</HI> except in the legal pro∣secution of justice, and in the necessary de∣fence of our lives and properties; so that <HI>no Man on earth</HI> (and much less in Eng∣land<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">For in England, not only the laws of God, but the laws of the land forbid the pardoning of <HI>wilful manslaughter,</HI> so that even <HI>the king himself</HI> is abso∣lutely restrained from it. See an act of the 2 Edw. III. whereby it is ordained, that a charter of pardon <Q>shall not be granted, but only where the king may do it by his oath; that is to say, where a man slayeth an∣other in <HI>his own defence,</HI> or <HI>by misfortune.</HI></Q></NOTE> has any legal or just right to par∣don
<PB N="xvii" REF="18"/>or remit the punishment due to <HI>mur∣der,</HI> or <HI>voluntary manslaughter</HI> (which are the same crime, and equally <HI>unpardon∣able</HI> in this world); for such an indulgence is not only a manifest sin against Almighty God, but also against the community at large, or country; <Q>for <HI>Blood it defileth the land;</HI> and the <HI>land</HI> cannot be cleansed of <HI>the blood</HI> that is shed therein, but <HI>by the blood of him that shed it,</HI></Q> Numb. <HI>xxxv. 33.</HI> This is not a ceremonial law, but a law of morality, founded in divine justice, which must, therefore, be ever binding.</P>
<P>I may probably be charged with an un∣pardonable temerity for presuming to cen∣sure the writings of some of the greatest and most learned men that this nation, per∣haps, ever produced; and I am thoroughly sensible of the risk and ill consequences to
<PB N="xviii" REF="19"/>myself, in case I am mistaken; but a sincere persuasion of being in the right (arising from a laborious research and careful ex∣amination of the most celebrated and ap∣proved writers on Crown Law) obliges me to prefer, what I conceive to be <HI>truth,</HI> be∣fore the authority of the greatest names.</P>
<P>And even, though I should not have suc∣ceeded according to my own conceptions of the subject, yet, I trust, that my impartial readers will pardon any <HI>involuntary errors,</HI> that they find in the performance, especially if they see no cause to suspect any want of uprightness in the intention of it: and, at all events, I hope, that the attempt may, at least, be considered as a proof, that I am not afraid of difficulties and labour, nor of the risk of personal inconveniences, when I un∣dertake any point with a view of serving my country, or mankind in general.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NO MAN can give or accept a chal∣lenge to fight <HI>with weapons,</HI> and <HI>kill</HI> his antagonist (on any private difference whatever) without being guilty of <HI>Wil∣ful Murder,</HI> such as ought to be excluded from the benefit of clergy. For <HI>Wilful Murder</HI> is the killing of a man <HI>ex ma∣litia praecogitata</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pleas of the Crown 1678, p. 35. also 1 Hal. P. C. 425.</NOTE>; which <HI>malice</HI> is either <HI>implied</HI> or <HI>express,</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fitzherbert's Justice of Peace, p. 21. Lambard's Eirenarcha, c. 7. p. 240. also 3 Inst. c. vii. p. 47.</NOTE> or, as judge Hale calls it, <HI>Malice in Law,</HI> or <HI>ex presumptione Le∣gis</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Hal. P. C. 451.</NOTE>; and <HI>malice</HI> must necessarily be <HI>im∣plied</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="21"/>when a man <HI>wilfully strikes</HI> or wounds another with any <HI>offensive weapon</HI> whatever, because that is <Q>an act that must apparently introduce harm</Q><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">P. C. 1678, p. 36.</NOTE>, and the intention to do harm <HI>makes it murder</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 36.</NOTE>; so that the allowance which the writers of the two last centuries have made for <HI>sudden anger</HI> (without preserv∣ing a proper <HI>distinction</HI> of the case where∣in it really deserves consideration) is un∣just in itself, as well as dangerous to so∣ciety; for few men would entertain such absurd notions of honour, as to think themselves obliged to revenge affronts with their <HI>swords</HI> or <HI>pistols,</HI> if they were <HI>sure</HI> to be hanged up as felons and murderers for their own <HI>gentleman-like satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P><Q>In every charge of murder, <HI>the fact of killing being first proved,</HI> all the circum∣stances of Accident, Necessity, or In∣firmity
<PB N="3" REF="22"/>are to be satisfactorily proved by the prisoner, unless they arise out of of the evidence produced against him: for the law presumeth the fact to have been <HI>founded in malice,</HI> until the contrary appeareth.</Q> Judge Foster, 255.</P>
<P>The cases of homicide which are justifi∣ed or excused by the above-mentioned <HI>cir∣cumstances</HI> of <HI>Accident</HI> and <HI>Necessity,</HI> are well understood, and, by many eminent writers, sufficiently explained under the heads of <HI>Misfortune</HI> and <HI>Self-defence.</HI> But with respect to those cases of Homicide, which are attended with circumstances of <HI>infirmity</HI> (the third branch of circumstan∣ces mentioned above) thewriters on crown law in general have been very indiscrimi∣nate, notwithstanding that the true dis∣tinction between <HI>Murder</HI> and <HI>Manslaughter</HI> depends entirely on a clear stating of those
<PB N="4" REF="23"/>cases of <HI>infirmity,</HI> which really deserve consideration and excuse.</P>
<P>Judge Foster, indeed, is, for the most part, nice and accurate in his distinctions; yet he has paid so great a regard to the authority of <HI>precedents,</HI> that he has been unwarily led away (as well as other wri∣ters) from the necessary conclusions of his own arguments upon this point; I shall, nevertheless, make use of his words as far as they express my own opinion of the subject.— <Q>Whoever would shelter himself under the plea of <HI>Provocation</HI> must prove his case to the satisfaction of his jury. The presumption of law is against him, till that presumption is repelled by contrary evidence. What degree of <HI>Provocation,</HI> and under what circumstances Heat of blood, the <HI>Fu∣ror brevis,</HI> will or will not avail the Defendant is now to be considered.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="24"/><Q>Words of Reproach, how grievous soever, are not a Provocation suffi∣cient to free the Party killing from the <HI>guilt of murder.</HI> Nor are indecent pro∣voking actions or gestures expressive of contempt or reproach, <HI>without an assault upon the person.</HI></Q> (p. 290.) But I think myself obliged to add that even <HI>an assault</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See my Remarks (in p. 58, &amp;c.) on Mr. Haw∣kins's assertions relating to this point.</NOTE> <HI>upon the person</HI> is NOT <Q>a Provocation sufficient to free the Party killing from the <HI>guilt of murder,</HI></Q> (though this learned judge seems to think otherwise. See Sect. iii. p. 295) un∣less all the circumstances which are ne∣cessary to render it excusable by the plea of <HI>self-defence</HI> can clearly be proved. For if <HI>the Killing</HI> in a sudden fray is not <HI>ex necessitate,</HI> (as in Self-defence, or in the lawful Defence of others), it must be esteemed <HI>voluntary;</HI> and <HI>voluntary</HI> is the
<PB N="6" REF="25"/>same thing as <HI>wilful;</HI> which necessarily in∣cludes "<HI>malice.</HI> For Bracton says, <Q>Cri∣men non contrahitur nisi <HI>Voluntas no∣cendi</HI> intercedat &amp; voluntas et propo∣situm distinguunt <HI>Malificium,</HI></Q> &amp;c. lib. iii. c. 17.) So that <HI>malice</HI> must necessarily be <HI>presumed,</HI> whenever the <HI>killing</HI> is not <HI>ex necessitate,</HI> especially if the fatal blow be <HI>wilfully</HI> given with <HI>a weapon;</HI> for in that case a man must necessarily be supposed to strike, <HI>"cum occidendi animo,"</HI> because the <HI>Voluntas nocendi</HI> is apparent; and, consequently, the <HI>malice,</HI> in such a case, is not only <HI>implied</HI> but clearly <HI>expressed;</HI> so that the <HI>sudden anger</HI> is only a further proof of <HI>the malice</HI> and "<HI>intention</HI> to do harm."</P>
<P>Bracton has accurately laid down the proper distinction to be observed in the plea of <HI>an excusable Necessity</HI> for killing.</P>
<P><Q>Quo casu distinguendum est utrum <HI>Necessitas</HI> illa fuit <HI>evitablis</HI> vel non. Si
<PB N="7" REF="26"/>autem <HI>evitabilis,</HI> et evadere posset abs∣que occisione, tune erit <HI>reus homicidii</HI></Q> (and a felonious <HI>homicide</HI> or <HI>manslaughter,</HI> in the days of Bracton, had the same meaning that we now apply to <HI>Murder</HI>). <Q>Si autem <HI>inevitablis,</HI> quia occidit homi∣nem sine odii meditatione <HI>in metu &amp; do∣lore animi,</HI> se et sua liberando cùm ali∣ter</Q> (<HI>mortem propriam</HI> Fleta, lib.

And Staunford remarks, that <HI>the necessity</HI> ought to be so great, that it ought to be esteemed <HI>inevitable,</HI> or otherwise it shall not be excused; so that the whole mat∣ter consists (says he) in the <HI>inevitable necessity,</HI> without which the <HI>killing is by no means excusable</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Nota que la necessite doit etre cy graunde; que il doit estre existimé <HI>inevitable,</HI> ou autrement il n'ex∣cusera, &amp;c. eins tout la matier consist in le <HI>inevitable necessite,</HI> sans quel, <HI>le tuer</HI> n'est <HI>ascun voi excusable.</HI> Staunford, P.C. lib. i. c. 7.</NOTE> so that the learned judge Foster certainly goes too far, when
<PB N="8" REF="27"/>he insinuates, in the passage before cited, "that <HI>an assault</HI> upon the person" (with out mentioning the necessary exception concerning <HI>inevitable Necessity</HI>) <Q>is a provocation sufficient to free the party killing from the guilt of murder.</Q> For a farther distinction (besides that of <HI>ine∣vitable necessity</HI>) is also to be observed, which is very accurately laid down, even by judge Foster himself, in p. 291, though the same would be useless, if <HI>an assault upon the person</HI> was to be admitted as a <HI>sufficient provocation</HI> to the act of <HI>killing.</HI><Q> It ought to be remembred (says he) that in all other cases of homicide upon slight provocation<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">But I have already shewn that <HI>no provocation</HI> whatever can justify a <HI>voluntary</HI> or <HI>wilfull killing.</HI></NOTE> if it may be rea∣sonably collected <HI>from the weapon</HI> made use of, or from any other circum∣stance, that the Party <HI>intended to kill,</HI> or to do some great bodily harm, <HI>such
<PB N="9" REF="28"/>Homicide</HI> will be Murder. The mischief done is irreparable, and the outrage is considered as flowing rather from <HI>brutal rage</HI> or <HI>diabolical malignity than from human frailty.</HI> And it is to <HI>human frailty,</HI> and to that alone, the Law indulgeth in every case of felonious Homicide.</Q></P>
<P>The first Instance which he gives by way of illustration to this doctrine is cited from Judge Hale, Vol. i. p. 473. If <Q><HI>A.</HI> come into the wood of <HI>B.</HI> and pull his Hedges, or cut his wood, and <HI>B.</HI> beat him, whereof he dies, this is <HI>man∣slaughter,</HI> because, tho it was not lawful for <HI>A.</HI> to cut the wood, it was not lawful for <HI>B.</HI> to beat him, but either to bring him to a justice of peace, or punish him otherwise according to law.</Q> But here Lord Hale is not suffi∣ciently distinct in stating the case; because Circumstances are wanting, which are ne∣cessary
<PB N="10" REF="29"/>for the determination of such a case, whether it ought to be esteemed <HI>manslaughter</HI> or <HI>murder.</HI> The accurate judge Foster was sensible of this want of <HI>necessary circumstances,</HI> and therefore adds, <Q>But it must be understood (says he) that he beat him, <HI>not with a mischievous intention,</HI> but meerly to chastise for the trespass, and to deter him from committing the like. For if he had knocked his Brains out with <HI>a bill or hedgestake,</HI> or had given him <HI>an outrageous beating</HI> with an ordinary cudgel beyond the the bounds of a <HI>sudden resentment,</HI> whereof he had died, <HI>It had been Murder.</HI> For these circumstances are some of the genuine symptoms of the <HI>Mala Mens,</HI> the heart bent upon mis∣chief, which, as I have already shewn, enter into the true notion <HI>of Malice</HI> in the legal sense of the word.</Q> p. 291.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="30"/>The next instance he mentions is that of the parker tying the boy to his horse's tail. Which was (says he) <Q><HI>held to be murder.</HI>" "For it was a deliberate act, <HI>and savoured of cruelty.</HI></Q> But the third instance, viz. that of Stedman the soldier killing a woman <HI>with a sword</HI> (which judge Foster mentions as a case that <HI>was held clearly to be no more than manslaughter</HI>) was, most certainly, <HI>wil∣ful murder:</HI> for though it appeared, that the woman had struck the soldier on the face with an iron patten; yet she after∣wards fled from him, and he <Q><HI>pursuing</HI> her, <HI>stabbed her in the back.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now if such a case of <HI>wilful killing</HI> is to be esteemed only manslaughter, it entirely perverts the just arguments already quoted from the same author concerning the cases wherein <HI>human frailty</HI> deserves to be <HI>indulged!</HI> May I not use his own words against him?
<PB N="12" REF="31"/>That "these circumstances" (the pur∣suing, and stabbing the woman in the back) <Q>are some of the genuine symp∣toms of the <HI>mala mens,</HI> the <HI>heart bent upon mischief.</HI></Q> Whereas, if he had <HI>struck her</HI> merely with his fist, or with a small stick <HI>not likely</HI> to kill, and had unluckily, and against his <HI>intention, killed,</HI> it had been but <HI>manslaughter.</HI> For this is the necessary distinction for which I contend <HI>in all cases of killing</HI> where the <HI>striking</HI> (not the killing) is <HI>voluntary:</HI> and I cannot so well express my meaning as in the words of judge Foster himself, though that sensible and acute reasoner is afterwards misled from the truth of his own doctrine by paying too much regard to the practice of the Courts, which, in this point, has frequently been erroneous.</P>
<P>In page 290, after the 1st section (already quoted) concerning the cir∣cumstances, which <Q>are not a pro∣vocation
<PB N="13" REF="32"/>sufficient to free the Party Killing from the Guilt of Murder,</Q> he adds, <Q>This rule will, I conceive (says he) govern every case where the Party Killing upon such provocation <HI>maketh use of a deadly weapon,</HI> or otherwise <HI>manifesteth an intention to kill,</HI> or to do some great bodily harm. But if he had given the other a box on the ear, or had struck him with a stick or other weapon <HI>not likely to kill,</HI> and <HI>had unluckily and against his intention</HI> killed, it had been but <HI>manslaughter.</HI> The difference between the cases is plainly this. In the former <HI>the malitia, the wicked vindictive disposition</HI> already mentioned, <HI>evidently appeareth:</HI> in the latter it is <HI>as evidently wanting.</HI> The Party in the first transport of his pas∣sion intended to chastise for a piece of insolence which few spirits can bear. In this case the benignity of the law interposeth in favour of human frailty;
<PB N="14" REF="33"/>in the other its justice regardeth and <HI>punisheth the apparent malignity of the heart.</HI></Q> p. 290 and 291.</P>
<P>Nevertheless the same author, in p. 296, endeavours to excuse killing in <HI>sudden rencounters,</HI> without preserving this necessary distinction concerning <Q>the use of a deadly weapon,</Q> and <Q><HI>the intention to kill.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>To what I have offered (says he) with regard to <HI>sudden rencounters</HI> let me add, that the blood, already too much heated, kindleth afresh at every pass or blow. And in the tumult of the passions, in which <HI>meer instinct self-preservation,</HI> hath no inconsiderable share, the voice of reason is not heard. And therefore the law <HI>in condescension</HI> to the infirmities of flesh and blood hath extenuated the of∣fence.</Q> But <HI>the Law,</HI> in reality, makes no such <HI>condescension,</HI> though <HI>the Courts of
<PB N="15" REF="34"/>Law</HI> have, indeed, <HI>indiscriminately</HI> done so, and have occasioned a multitude of bad precedents, wherein <HI>wilful murder</HI> has been excused under the name of <HI>manslaughter;</HI> and this unhappy differ∣ence between <HI>the Law,</HI> and the corrupt practice of <HI>the Courts,</HI> with respect to this point, has unwarily led the more mo∣dern writers on crown law into conces∣sions, which are absolutely contradictory to the just doctrines laid down in other parts of their excellent works.</P>
<P>When I speak of such respectable and justly revered authors as Sir Edward Coke, Sir Matthew Hale, lord chief justice Holt, &amp;c. No person can conceive that I am misled by per∣sonal or party prejudice against their opi∣nions; and as I have, really, the highest esteem and veneration for their memory, not only as great and learned lawyers, but as true patriots, and, above all, as sin∣cere
<PB N="16" REF="35"/>Christians, and worthy honest men, I should not presume to controvert any point that has been laid down by such excellent lawyers <HI>(so accomplished as above)</HI> was I not armed by <HI>their own authority;</HI> for <HI>no other authority</HI> is-suf∣ficiently authentic for the purpose of cor∣recting such deservedly esteemed wri∣ters; though I must acknowledge my obligation to the more ancient writers for the discovery of the errors of which I complain.</P>
<P>The proper distinction to be observed between <HI>murder</HI> and <HI>manslaughter</HI> is well laid down by Sir Matthew Hale. <Q><HI>Mur∣der</HI> (says he) being aggravated with malice <HI>presumed</HI> or <HI>implied, but man∣slaughter</HI> Not.</Q> 1 Hale's P. C. 466.</P>
<P>This rule is good and unexceptionable; and therefore it must appear, that even Sir Matthew Hale himself is mistaken in
<PB N="17" REF="36"/>the paragraph preceding this quotation, where he says that <Q><HI>Manslaughter,</HI> or <HI>sim∣ple homicide,</HI> is the <HI>voluntary killing</HI> of another without <HI>malice express</HI> or <HI>impli∣ed:</HI></Q> for though there may be a <HI>volun∣tary striking</HI> without <HI>malice,</HI> yet I hope I have already proved, that there cannot be a <HI>voluntary killing</HI> without <HI>malice express</HI> or <HI>implied,</HI> except in the legal execution of jus∣tice, and in the case of <HI>self-defence</HI> and its several branches, which some writers (ra∣ther improperly) have, indeed, called <HI>vo∣luntary</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Lambard's Eirenarcha 255. Sir Edward Coke's 3 Inst. p. 55 and 56.</NOTE>, though they proceed from an <HI>inevitable necessity</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See the note in page 45.</NOTE>. Nevertheless even the great Sir Edward Coke (and before him the learned Lambard in his Eiren∣archa, p. 250.) was guilty of this same impropriety of expression. <Q>Some manslaughters (says Sir Edward Coke, 3 Inst. cap. viii. p. 55.) <HI>be voluntary,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="37"/>and not of <HI>malice forethought,</HI> upon some <HI>sudden falling out.</HI> Delinquens per iram provocatus puniri debet mi∣tius. And this for <HI>distinction sake</HI> (says he) is called <HI>manslaughter.</HI></Q> But it is a very <HI>indiscriminate distinction</HI> (if I may use such an expression concerning the writ∣ings of so great a man,) because the maxim "Delinquens per iram" &amp;c. can only be admitted in cases where the <HI>malice</HI> is <HI>neither express</HI> nor <HI>implied:</HI> for instance, when the <HI>Striking</HI> is <HI>voluntary;</HI> but the <HI>Killing,</HI> or <HI>Manslaughter,</HI> is <HI>invo∣luntary,</HI> and <HI>unexpected;</HI> as when a man, <HI>in sudden anger,</HI> gives an unlucky blow merely with his fist, or with a small stick, or small stone,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See judge Foster's comment on Rowly's case, wherein the difference of striking with a <HI>dangerous weapon,</HI> and with a small stick, or <HI>cudgel not likely to destroy,</HI> is well expressed, pages 294 and 295. <Q>I have always thought Rowly's case (says he) a very extraordinary one, as it is reported by <HI>Coke,</HI> from whom <HI>Hale</HI> cites it. The son fights with another boy and is beaten; he runs home to his father all bloody; the father takes a staff, runs three quarters of a mile, and beats the other boy, who dieth of this beating. This is said to have been ruled man∣slaughter, <HI>because done in sudden heat and passion,</HI></Q> (for which he cites 12 Rep. 87. and 1 Hale 453.) "Surely" (continues judge Foster) <Q>the provocation was not very grievous. The boy had fought with one who happened to be an overmatch for him, and was worsted; a disaster slight enough, and very frequent among boys. If upon this provoca∣tion the father, after running three quarters of a mile, had set his strength against the child, had dispatched him with <HI>an hedgestake</HI> or <HI>any other deadly weapon,</HI> or by repeated blows with his cudgel, it must, in my opinion, <HI>have been murder;</HI> since any of these circumstances would have been a plain indication of the <HI>malitia,</HI> the mischievous vindictive motive before explained. But with regard to these circumstances, <HI>with what weapon,</HI> or to <HI>what degree</HI> the child was beaten, <HI>Coke</HI> is totally silent. But <HI>Croke</HI> setteth the case in a much clearer light, and at the same time leadeth his readers into the true grounds of the judgment. His words are, Rowly struck the child with a <HI>small cudgel</HI> (Godbolt calleth it a rod, meaning I suppose <HI>a small wand</HI>) of which stroke he afterwards died. I think it may be fairly collected from <HI>Croke</HI>'s manner of speaking, that the accident happened by <HI>a single stroke</HI> with a cudgel <HI>not likely to destroy,</HI> and that death did not immediately ensue. The stroke was given in heat of blood, and not with any of the circumstances which import the <HI>malitia,</HI> the malig∣nity of the heart attending the fact already explain∣ed, and therefore <HI>Manslaughter.</HI> I observe that lord <HI>Raymond</HI> layeth <HI>great stress</HI> on this circum∣stance, <HI>That the Stroke was with a Cudgel not likely to Kill.</HI></Q></NOTE> (meaning only to correct)
<PB N="19" REF="38"/>which, <HI>undesignedly,</HI> occasions death; for, in such cases, the <HI>malice</HI> is not <HI>implied;</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="39"/>whereas, in a <HI>voluntary homicide,</HI> even a <HI>Malice prepensed</HI> is implied, according to Sir Edward Coke's own definition of that term, viz. <Q>That it is <HI>voluntary,</HI> and of set purpose, <HI>though it be done upon a Sudden Occasion:</HI> for if it be <HI>Voluntary,</HI> the law <HI>implieth Malice,</HI></Q> 3 Inst. c. xiii. p. 62.—Sir William Black∣stone has also fallen into the same error in his 4th vol. chap. xiv. p. 191. where he informs us that Manslaughter is <Q>the unlawful killing of another, with∣out malice either <HI>express</HI> or <HI>implied:</HI> which may be either <HI>voluntarily</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="40"/>upon <HI>a sudden heat;</HI> or involuntarily, but in the commission of some <HI>un-unlawful act.</HI></Q> In both of which he is also mistaken; for, with respect to the latter, his doctrine cannot be admitted, except in cases where the circumstances of the <HI>unlawful act</HI> amount only to <HI>a bare trespass</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Which he himself elswhere allows.
<P>Judge Foster in his second discourse of homicide, p. 258. where he treats of <HI>involuntary homicide</HI> in the commission of an <HI>unlawful act,</HI> informs us, <Q>that if it be done in the prosecution of a <HI>felonious inten∣tion</HI> it will be <HI>Murder,</HI> but if the intent went no farther than to commit <HI>a bare trespass,</HI> Man∣slaughter. Though I confess (says he) lord Coke seemeth to think otherwise.</Q> That is, Lord Coke did not even make an allowance for <HI>"a bare trespass,"</HI> but seems to have been of opinion, That every case of <HI>invo∣luntary homicide</HI> is to be treated as <HI>Murder,</HI> whenever the act which occasions death may be esteemed <HI>unlaw∣ful.</HI> See 3 Inst. p. 56. to which judge Foster refers. But that learned judge could not mean, that he differed in opinion from lord Coke concerning the first case there stated under the head of <HI>unlawful,</HI> viz. the unlawful shooting at a deer, whereby a boy was killed by the glance of the arrow; because that case must necessarily be esteemed <HI>Murder</HI> according to judge Foster's own rule above-mentioned; for lord Coke has clearly stated a <HI>felonious intention,</HI> viz. <Q>A. meaning <HI>to steal</HI> a deer in <HI>the park</HI> of B. &amp;c.</Q> It must therefore appear; that he refers only to the 2d case, there mentioned, of a man shooting at a cook or a hen, or any <HI>tame fowl of another man's;</HI> for a person might wantonly shoot at another man's pigeons, or poultry, without any in∣tention to <HI>steal them;</HI> which, I conceive, would amount to no more than <HI>a bare trespass</HI> in judge Foster's sense of the word; because "voluntas et propositum distin∣guunt <Q>maleficia; <HI>furtum</HI> vero non committitur <HI>sine affectu furandi.</HI></Q> Fleta lib. i. c. 33. p. 48. Whereas if lord Coke had added, in the supposed case, that there was an intention <HI>to steal</HI> the tame fowl, judge Foster could not, reasonably, have dissented from his opinion; because the crime must necessarily have been adjudged <HI>Murder</HI> according to his own rule; for the very same case has been so laid down by lord chief justice Holt in a very clear manner, (see pages 49 and 50 of this tract) in order to explain lord Coke's assertion; tho' Judge Holt himself is, as apparently, mistaken in his Judgment of the other Case wherein the occasion was an intention to <HI>steal a Deer,</HI> which is, at least, as <HI>felonious</HI> as the intention of <HI>stealing a Hen,</HI> that is, if the Deer be tame and <HI>inclosed</HI> in <HI>a Park</HI> (as stated by lord Coke) by which the <HI>property</HI> is rendered ap∣parent: but if the case had been stated that the Deer was in a <HI>Forest</HI> or open chase, the offence <HI>(without the accident)</HI> would be only a <HI>Trespass,</HI> (See Hawkins P. C. Book i. c. xxxiii. § 26); and the idea of this latter position may probably, have occasioned lord Holt's mistake; for this circumstance would have ren∣dered the <HI>accidental Killing</HI> of the Boy, only <HI>Man∣slaughter,</HI> agreeable to his opinion. Compare pages 47 and 50, wherein Lord Holt's opinion of these 2 Cases are mentioned.</P></NOTE> For I propose, in the
<PB N="22" REF="41"/>course of this tract, to mention several allowed cases, on good authority, where∣in
<PB N="23" REF="42"/>even the <HI>involuntary</HI> or undesigned kill∣ing is not deemed <HI>manslaughter,</HI> but <HI>mur∣der,</HI> when the acts, which occasioned death, were <HI>unlawful:</HI> and with respect to the former, it is a manifest <HI>inconsistency,</HI> in all these great writers, to rank <HI>voluntary killing</HI> under the head of <HI>manslaughter,</HI> in the modern <HI>confined</HI> sense of that <HI>once gene∣ral</HI> term; because a <HI>voluntary killing</HI> (ex∣cept in the case of <HI>self-defence,</HI> through ine∣vitable necessity, which some writers have, rather improperly, called <HI>voluntary</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Lambard's Eirenarcha 255. "The last member (says he) of <HI>voluntarie homicide</HI> is where one man kill∣eth another in his <HI>own defence,</HI> &amp;c." and Sir Edward Coke, speaking of self-defence in 3 Inst. p. 55 and 56. says, "this is <HI>voluntary,</HI> and yet no felony." Sir Mat∣thew Hale is more accurate; for when he speaks of homicde <HI>ex necessitate,</HI> he informs us <Q>that this necessity makes the homicide not <HI>simply voluntary,</HI> but mixed, partly voluntary and partly involuntary, and is of two kinds,</Q> &amp;c. 1 vol. 478.</NOTE>) is
<PB N="24" REF="43"/>certainly the same thing as a <HI>wilful kill∣ing;</HI> and either of them must be allowed to be the proper definition of what we now understand by the term <HI>Murder</HI> (though the meaning of that word was, originally, very different. See le Mirroir de justice, 1642, c. i. sect. xiii. p. 104. and Lambard's Eirenarcha, c. vii. p. 239.) be∣cause, in <Q><HI>a voluntary or wilful killing, ma∣lice</HI> is necessarily <HI>implied;</HI></Q> and, conse∣quently, <HI>voluntary killing</HI> is excluded from the favour due to manslaughter by the rule which these learned writers them∣selves admit, <HI>viz.</HI><Q>that manslaughter is without malice <HI>express</HI> or <HI>implied;</HI></Q> so that they are really guilty of a <HI>contradiction in terms;</HI> because the <HI>malice,</HI> or <HI>inten∣tion of killing,</HI> is <HI>undeniable,</HI> if the <HI>kill∣ing</HI>

Cent. fo. 16.) I am compelled to reject the definition of <HI>manslaughter</HI> given by these learned writers, as far as it is contradictory to that excellent rule, already cited, for the distinction of <HI>manslaughter</HI> from <HI>mur∣der,</HI> which they themselves admit, viz. that <Q><HI>manslaughter is without malice ex∣press or implied.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The errors, of which I complain, were not originally occasioned by thefe cele∣brated authors, but by a previous corrupt practice in the courts, which had been in∣troduced by degrees, and at last unhappily prevailed, through a false idea of mercy
<PB N="26" REF="45"/>and consideration for <HI>sudden anger,</HI> and also through the want of preserving the <HI>pro∣per distinction</HI> of cases, wherein <HI>manslaugh∣ter</HI> in <HI>sudden anger</HI> is really excusable. The proper distinction to be observed is, when the <HI>intention</HI> of <HI>killing</HI> is not necessarily <HI>implied</HI> in the act itself; as when a man strikes another merely with his hand, or fist, in sudden anger; or thrusts him sudden∣ly from him, whereby he falls and receives a hurt, which occasions death; in these, and similar cases, the striking, or thrust∣ing is, indeed, <HI>voluntary,</HI> yet the <HI>killing,</HI> or <HI>manslaughter,</HI> is not so, but entirely un∣designed and unexpected; which proper and necessary distinction the Law Com∣mentators have unhappily neglected. For, though the act of <HI>striking or thrust∣ing in anger</HI> bears some resemblance to <HI>malice,</HI> and though such an act is cer∣tainly <HI>unlawful in itself,</HI> yet it is reason∣able to make some allowance for the
<PB N="27" REF="46"/>frailty of human nature, and the sudden passion of a man that is provoked, when∣ever <HI>a more criminal malice</HI> is not neces∣sarily <HI>implied</HI> in <HI>the act itself,</HI> which oc∣casions death. And in this lenity we are justified by the laws of God, whereby such cases of manslaughter <HI>in sudden anger,</HI> as I have mentioned, were excused without any other penalty than that of banishment to a city of refuge. <Q>If he <HI>thrust</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>The thrusting,</HI> here mentioned (which some wri∣ters seem to have misunderstood) does not mean a <HI>thrust</HI> with a sword or other weapon; for the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> has no such meaning, but properly signifies a violent thrusting or shoving away, as with the hand; or a sudden-driving away, as chaff is drove before the wind, as Bythner remarks, <Q>Proprie dicitur de vento, qui rapta prosequitur.</Q> Lyra prophetica, p. 6</NOTE> him <HI>suddenly</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)without <HI>enmity</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Here a proper distinction is preserved between <HI>sudden anger</HI> and <HI>enmity.</HI></NOTE> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Numb. xxxv. 22.)— the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, &amp;c.</Q> (v. 25.)

<PB N="28" REF="47"/>the hand <HI>in enmity,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> see the 21st verse, apparently meaning, when there was any <HI>express proof of malice,</HI> or inten∣tion to kill,) were to be deemed <HI>unpar∣donable;</HI> "he shall surely die."</P>
<P>But it is remarkable, that these are the <HI>only</HI> two <HI>cases</HI> wherein <HI>an express proof of malice</HI> was required; for in all the examples given in the same chapter of killing <HI>with a weapon,</HI> or with <HI>a stone wherewith a man may die,</HI> (meaning such a stone as from its shape or size might be deemed a sufficient weapon to occasion death) there is not the least mention made of <HI>malice</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Hatred, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Enmity) which is a sufficient, proof that the same were necessarily <HI>implied</HI> from the stroke, when given with a <HI>weapon;</HI> for, in that case, the command was peremptory. <Q>If he smite him with an instrument of iron</Q> so that he die, he is a <HI>murderer</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>

<PB N="36" REF="55"/><Q>Delinquens per iram provocatus pu∣niri debet mitius,</Q> 3 Inst. 55.</P>
<P>But a false idea of mercy, and consi∣deration for <HI>sudden anger</HI> unhappily pre∣vailing in the Courts, this lenity was <HI>in∣discriminately</HI> extended even to cases where the <HI>prepensed malice</HI> was necessa∣rily <HI>implied</HI> by the stroke; so that the wretch, who stabbed his neighbour in <HI>brutal anger,</HI> escaped with impunity, to the scandal of public justice. The bad effects of this <HI>false mercy,</HI> and injustice, became so notorious in the reign of King James I. that the legislature was obliged to seek a remedy; and a statute was then made (I Jac.

<PB N="37" REF="56"/>c. xiv. p. 193. But unfortunately this remedy proved almost as <HI>indiscriminate</HI> as the abuse intended to be corrected by it; for it takes no notice of any other crime than that of <HI>stabbing;</HI> as if <HI>sudden anger</HI> was not <HI>equally criminal,</HI> when a man is killed <Q><HI>by throwing a hammer or other weapon;</HI></Q> or by <HI>"a shot with a pistol."</HI> Ibid. p. 194. Whereas, in truth, no new law was wanted: nothing but a better ad∣ministration of the old laws before-men∣tioned; for, in all such furious sallies of <HI>sudden anger,</HI> the <HI>malice</HI> was necessarily <HI>implied,</HI> or <HI>presumed, from the weapon,</HI> as well in the laws of God (which I have already shewn) as in the law of nations:— <Q><HI>Ex telo praesumitur malum consilium</HI> (says the learned Grotius) <HI>nisi contrarium appareat.</HI></Q> And in his second book, de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis, he remarks, that either <HI>iron, a club, or a

<P>The reason of the severity in the di∣vine law, against striking <HI>with a weapon,</HI> is well expressed by Dr. Wells in his paraphrase on Numbers xxxv. 16 to 19. <Q>Forasmuch (says he) as tho' he might have no malice to him before-hand, yet his striking him <HI>with a sword,</HI> or <HI>hatchet,</HI> &amp;c. shews he had <HI>an inten∣tion</HI> to do him mischief;</Q> and, as Dr. Dodd remarks <Q>though perhaps he had no <HI>formed intention to kill</HI> the person; yet he ought to have moderated his passion, and could not be ignorant that <HI>such an instrument</HI> was capable of inflicting <HI>a deadly wound.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And, therefore, when a man is <HI>killed with a weapon</HI> (except it be by <HI>misfor∣tune,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="58"/>or in <HI>self-defence</HI> <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><Q>Regularly, it is necessary that, the person, that kills another <HI>in his own defence,</HI> fly as far as he may to avoid the violence of the assault before he turn upon his assailant, for tho in cases of hostility between two nations it is a reproach and piece of cowardice to fly from an enemy, yet in cases of as∣saults and affrays between subjects under the same law, <HI>the law owns not any such point of honour,</HI> because the king and his laws are to be <HI>vindices in∣juriarum,</HI> and private persons are not trusted to take capital revenge one of another.</Q> 1 Hale, p. 481.</NOTE>, when the Slayer could retire no further to save himself without striking; or else in such law∣ful and reasonable cases, wherein a man is not obliged to give back; as in the case of a peace officer<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><Q>If a gaoler be assaulted by his prisoner, or if the sheriff or his minister be assaulted in the execu∣tion of his office, <HI>he is not bound to give back to the wall,</HI> but if he kill the assailant, it is in law adjudged <HI>se defendendo,</HI> tho he <HI>gave not back to the wall.</HI> The like of a constable or watchman,</Q> &amp;c. 1 Hale, p. 481.

Also, <Q>If a theif assault a true man, either abroad or in his house, to rob or kill him, <HI>the true man is not bound to give back,</HI> but <HI>may kill</HI> the assailant, and it is not felony.</Q> 1 Hale, p. 481. for which he quotes Co.

See the preceding quotation from Bracton.—Judge Hale, indeed, seems to think that a thief may lawfully be killed, if he cannot otherwise be taken. <Q>If a person (says he) be in∣dicted of felony, and flies, or being arrested by warrant or process of law upon such indictment, escapes and flies, and will not render himself, where∣upon the officer or minister <HI>cannot take him without killing of him,</HI> this is not felony,</Q> &amp;c.
<P><Q>But if he <HI>may be taken without such severity,</HI> it is <HI>at least manslaughter</HI> in him that kills him: there∣fore the jury is to enquire whether it <HI>were done of necessity or not.</HI></Q> 1 Hale 489. for which he cites 3 E. 3. Coron 288.22 Assiz. 55. Stamf. P. C. lib. 1. cap. 5. fol. 13, b. But this doctrine requires some further restriction; for the <HI>Necessity</HI> of <HI>taking</HI> a thief, or retaking a prisoner, or that of executing a civil writ is not so great as to justify <HI>killing</HI> when the person endea∣vours to escape merely by flight; the <HI>Necessity</HI> can only be founded <HI>in his resistance,</HI> from which no man is bound to give back: and this will appear by Lord Hale's own words in another place, viz. <Q>But if the prisoner <HI>makes no resistance,</HI> but flies, yet the offi∣cer, either for fear that he or some other of his party will rescue the prisoner, strikes the prisoner, whereof he dies, this is <HI>murder,</HI> for here was no assault first made by the prisoner, and so it cannot be <HI>se defendendo</HI> in the officer.</Q>—And again, <Q>If a man be in danger of arrest by <HI>a capias</HI> in debt or trespass, and <HI>he flies,</HI> and the bailiff kills him, <HI>it is murder,</HI></Q> &amp;c. 1 Hales 481. The same point is still more accurately explained by judge Foster, chap. 2. p. 271. <Q>I rather choose to say (says he) it will be <HI>murder</HI> or <HI>manslaughter,</HI> as circumstances may vary the case. For if the officer in the heat of the pursuit, and meerly in order to overtake the de∣fendant, should trip up his heels, or give him a stroke with an ordinary cudgel, or other weapon, <HI>not likely to kill,</HI> and death should unhappily ensue, I cannot think that this will amount to more than <HI>Man∣slaughter,</HI> if in some cases even to that offence. The blood was heated in the pursuit, his prey, <HI>a lawful prey,</HI> just within his reach, and no signal mischief <HI>was intended.</HI> But had he made use of a <HI>Deadly Weapon,</HI></Q> (here is the proper distinction for which I contend) <Q>it would have amounted to <HI>Murder.</HI> The mischievous vindictive spirit, the <HI>Malitia,</HI> I have already explained, which always must be collected from circumstances, determineth the nature of the offence.</Q></P></NOTE>. I say, excepting
<PB N="42" REF="61"/>these, and similar cases, if a man <HI>will∣fully</HI> strikes another <HI>with a weapon</HI> in
<PB N="43" REF="62"/><HI>sudden anger,</HI> the design <HI>of killing</HI> is, by the <HI>weapon,</HI> rendered <HI>express,</HI> as I have
<PB N="44" REF="63"/>before observed, though the <Q><HI>prepensed malice</HI></Q> may, perhaps, more properly (upon a <HI>sudden provocation</HI>) be said to be <HI>implied;</HI> and it, certainly, is <HI>implied</HI> or <HI>pre∣sumed</HI> in law, though the <HI>sudden anger</HI> was but a moment before the fatal stroke; so that, if no proof can be produced by the prisoner, of <HI>an inevitable necessity,</HI> as in <HI>se defendendo,</HI> the act must, in reason and justice, be deemed <Q><HI>wilful murder of malice prepensed,</HI></Q> such as was sufficiently excluded from the benefit of clergy by two express acts of parliament (23 Hen. VIII. c. 1. and 1 Edw. VI. c. xii.) pre∣vious to the undistinguishing act of James I. against stabbing.</P>
<P>By an act of the 2 Edw. III. it was or∣dained that a charter of pardon <Q>shall not be granted, but only where <HI>the king may do it by his oath;</HI> that is to say, where a man slayeth another
<PB N="45" REF="64"/>in his <HI>own defence,</HI> or by <HI>misfortune.</HI></Q> Now with respect to the first case, viz. <Q><HI>in his own defence,</HI></Q> (or <HI>se defendendo</HI>) all writers, both antient and modern, agree, that the killing of a man must be<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">"It must be <HI>inevitable necessity.</HI>" (Pleas of the Crown, 1678, p. 33.) "upon <HI>an inevitable cause.</HI>" 3d Inst. chap. 8. p. 55 and 56. — <Q>but care must be taken that the resistance does not exceed the bounds of <HI>mere defence</HI> and <HI>prevention;</HI> for then the defender would himself become an aggressor.</Q> 3 Blackstone 4.— <Q>this is not excuseable <HI>se defendendo,</HI> since there is no <HI>absolute necessity,</HI></Q>—&amp;c. 4 Blackstone 191. <Q>Eins toutla matier consist <HI>in le inevitable necessite,</HI> sans quel <HI>le tuer n'est Ascun Voi Excusable.</HI></Q> Staun∣ford, P.

<PB N="46" REF="65"/>which cannot be admitted in favour of a Man, who has accepted a challenge; or who has drawn his sword, in <HI>sudden anger,</HI> merely to revenge an affront.</P>
<P>And with respect to the second <HI>pardonable case,</HI> mentioned in the said act of Edw. III. viz. <HI>by Misfortune,</HI> I must observe, that there are some cases of homicide that may even be said to happen <HI>by misfor∣tune,</HI> or <HI>without intention,</HI> which are, nevertheless, deemed <HI>Murder.</HI> And the severity of the law, in this respect, will enable me, by comparison, to point out, more clearly, the absurdity and injustice of excusing homicide, in consideration <HI>of sudden anger,</HI> when the mortal stroke is given <HI>with a weapon</HI> in rencounters.</P>
<P>The cases of <HI>Misfortune or Accident,</HI> which are deemed <HI>Murder,</HI> are those
<PB N="47" REF="66"/>wherein the act, which undesignedly oc∣casions death, is in itself <HI>unlawful</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><Q>For if the act be <HI>unlawful,</HI> I mean, if it be Malum in se, the case will amount to felony, either <HI>murder</HI> or <HI>manslaughter,</HI> as circumstances may vary the nature of it.

Lord chief justice Holt, indeed, says it is but <HI>manslaughter;</HI> in which he is mistaken<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See note in p. 21, and Judge Holt's own opinion on another case quoted in p. 49.</NOTE>. (See his Edition of Kelyng. Rex versus Plumber, 117.) But whether
<PB N="48" REF="67"/>this be deemed <HI>murder</HI> or <HI>manslaughter,</HI> the <HI>killing</HI> is merely accidental, or by <HI>misfortune;</HI> and, therefore, is certainly a much less crime than that of aiming at, and striking a man <HI>with</HI> a <HI>weapon,</HI> or shooting at him in <HI>sudden anger,</HI> howso∣ever great the previous affront may have been. For, in the former case, though the <HI>shooting</HI> at a <HI>deer</HI> belonging to an∣other person is both <HI>unlawful,</HI> and <HI>vo∣luntary,</HI> yet the <HI>manslaughter,</HI> which it accidentally occasions, is <HI>involuntary,</HI> and without intention; whereas in the <HI>volun∣tary</HI> aiming, and shooting at a man, the act itself is not only <HI>unlawful,</HI> but <HI>im∣plies malice;</HI> or rather, I may say, the <HI>malice</HI> is <HI>expressed</HI> by the act; and the <HI>sudden anger</HI> is so far from being an <HI>ex∣cuse,</HI> that it is, absolutely, a further proof of the <HI>malice</HI> and <HI>intention</HI> of <HI>killing.</HI> The <HI>malice</HI> was also <HI>implied</HI> in the case of the lord Dacres, though his lordship
<PB N="49" REF="68"/>was not half so criminal in <HI>his unlawful hunting,</HI> as the passionate man who strikes <HI>with a weapon.</HI> See how the case is mentioned by lord chief justice Kelyng, Rep. p. 87.</P>
<P><Q>The Lord Dacres and Mansell, and others in his company came <HI>unlawfully</HI> to hunt in a <HI>forest</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Judge Kelynge is mistaken in this point: for the lord Dacres probably would not have been treated with such severity, if <HI>the Trespass</HI> had been in a <HI>Forest</HI> or open chace; but it was in a <HI>Park</HI> belonging to Mr. Pelham in Surry (Crompton 25.) so that the <HI>unlawful</HI> Hunting was more than <HI>a bare trespass.</HI> See note, p. 21, 22, and 23. See also 1 Hawkins cap. xxxi. § 46. where another Ground for the imputation of <HI>Murder,</HI> in that case, seems to be assigned, viz. a Resolution of Divers Persons to resist all opposers in the commission of <HI>a breach of the peace;</HI> though it be only, as he calls it, a <HI>bare breach</HI> of the peace.</NOTE>, and being resisted, one of the company, when the lord Dacres was a great way off, <HI>and not

<P>Lord chief justice Holt supposes a case in his Rep. of Rex versus Plummer, p. 117. in the same book, which is in some de∣gree similar. <Q>So (says he) if two men have a design to steal a hen, and the one shoots <HI>at the hen</HI> for that purpose, and <HI>a man be killed,</HI> it is <HI>murder</HI> in both, because the <HI>design was felonious.</HI></Q> See also the last paragraph of p. 56.3 Inst. concerning the shooting at a <HI>tame fowl,</HI> of which this case, supposed by judge Holt, is an explanation. But surely <HI>the design</HI> must be much more <HI>felonious</HI> when a man <HI>wilfully</HI> strikes his neigh∣bour <HI>with a weapon in sudden anger;</HI> because this must necessarily be allowed to be an act <Q>committed <HI>felleo animo,</HI>

<P>The <HI>implication of malice</HI> in the owner of a beast that kills a man, after warn∣ing given, will also further illustrate what has been said; for though mere carelessness or inconsideration might oc∣casion his neglect, so that the accident may, in some degree, be esteemed a <HI>mis∣fortune,</HI> yet the law implies <HI>malice;</HI> <Q>for if one keep a mastiff dog (says Sir James Astry, in his charge to grand juries, p. 18.) that is used to bite people near the common highway; or bull or beast, that hath hurt any one (after notice) they kill any one, <HI>that will be murder in the Owner,</HI> altho' not present when the fact was done; and yet in this, and the other precedent cases, here is no <HI>express malice to be proved,</HI> but what the law construes to be so:</Q> this
<PB N="52" REF="71"/>is agreeable to the doctrine of judge Staunford, P. C. lib. i. cap. 9. <Q>Que si home ad un jument que est accus∣tomé a male faire et le Owner ceo bien sachant, negliga luy, eins luy suffra d'aller a large, et puis le jument tua un home: que ceo <HI>est felonie</HI> in le owner, eo que, per tiel sufferance: <HI>le owner semble daver volunté a tuer.</HI></Q> See also Crompton, p. 24. b. and 1 Hawkins, c. xxxi. § 8. And, according to Bracton, the Common Law <HI>imputes</HI> the death of a man by a beast, to any man, who follows, or drives the beast at the time of the misfortune;— <Q>vel dum insequitur quis equum <HI>vel bovem,</HI> et aliquis <HI>a bove</HI> vel <HI>equo</HI> percussus fuerit, et hujusmodi <HI>hoc imputatur ei.</HI></Q> Bract. lib iii. c. iv. p. 120. b. If this law were still enforced, we should not have such continual complaints of acci∣dents in the streets, by cattle, that are en∣raged, and made mad, through the cruelty of the two-legged brutes who drive them.
<PB N="53" REF="72"/>For the first step that ought to be taken, in such cases, is, to seize <HI>the drivers;</HI> and nineteen times out of twenty, it will be found, that the poor beast will reco∣ver it-self (when they are gone) from the excess of fear and rage which the the Brutality of the <HI>hurrying Drivers</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">— <Q>Si quis operam rei dederit illicitae, ut cum quis <HI>Boves velociter fugaverit,</HI> quorum unus ob∣viando hominem cornu occiderit, <HI>fugatori imputabi∣tur,</HI> quia diligentiam quam potuit non adhibuit.</Q> Fleta, lib. i. c. xxiii. p. 34.</NOTE>. had occasioned; so that it is plain where the guilt is to be <HI>imputed:</HI> but yet even a brutal driver is not so base and detestable as the man who wilfully strikes <HI>with a weapon</HI> in sudden anger. And again, he who aims to strike or shoot <HI>at a man,</HI> and accidentally kills a <HI>dif∣ferent person</HI> (whom perhaps he did not see) contrary to his intention (or <HI>by misfor∣tune</HI> as it were) is, nevertheless, deemed guilty of <HI>wilful murder,</HI> though he had not the least <HI>anger,</HI> or resentment, against
<PB N="54" REF="73"/>the <HI>person killed</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Homme sagitta a un <HI>ex malicia praecogitata,</HI> et luy misse, et tue autre qui estoit decost, et a qui nad malice, unc'il est <HI>murder,</HI> eo que il <HI>ad intent</HI> de <HI>mur∣der.</HI> Crompton's edition of Fitzherbert's Justice of Peace, p. 23.— <Q>As if a man, says judge Holt, out of malice to A. shoots at him to kill him, but misses him and kills B. it is <HI>no less</HI> a <HI>murder</HI> than if he had killed the person intended.</Q> Lord chief-justice Holt's Rep. of Rex versus Plummer, in Kelyng's Rep. p. 111. for which he quotes Dyer, p. 128. Cromp. p. 101. Plowden's Com. p. 474. Saun∣ders's case, 9 Rep. 91. Agnes Gore's case.</NOTE>. But surely the man who <HI>actually kills</HI> the person <HI>he aims at, in his anger,</HI> is at least as culpable! so that if <HI>sudden anger</HI> deserves no lenity in the for∣mer case, it certainly deserves none in the latter. Several cases also are mentioned by Sir William Blackstone, wherein <HI>sudden anger</HI> is not excusable, even though the death may be said to be <HI>"by misfortune,"</HI> as there was no real <HI>intention of killing, yet rendered by the circumstances</HI> <Q><HI>equivalent to a deliberate act of slaughter.</HI></Q> See
<PB N="55" REF="74"/>Comment. b. iv. chap. xiv. p. 199 and 200. <Q>Also if <HI>even upon a sudden pro∣vocation</HI> (says he) one beats another in a cruel and unusual manner, so that he dies, <HI>though he did not intend his death,</HI> yet he is guilty of <HI>murder</HI> by an <HI>express malice; that is by an</HI> ex∣press <HI>evil design</HI> the genuine sense of <HI>ma∣litia.</HI> As when a park-keeper tied a boy that was stealing wood, to a horse's tail, and dragged him along the park; when a master corrected his servant with an <HI>iron bar,</HI> and a schoolmaster stamped on his scholar's belly; so that each of the sufferers died; these were <HI>justly held to be murders,</HI> because the cor∣rection being excessive, and such as could not proceed but from a bad heart, it <HI>was equivalent to a deliberate act of slaugh∣ter.</HI></Q> But is not <HI>an express evil design</HI> as apparent, in the act of striking a man with <HI>a weapon, in anger,</HI> (be the <HI>anger</HI> ever
<PB N="56" REF="75"/>so sudden) as it is in these cases where death was <HI>not really intended?</HI> For surely the <HI>design of killing,</HI> is by the weapon, ren∣dered <HI>express</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><Q>If one executes his revenge upon <HI>a sudden pro∣vocation</HI> in such a cruel manner, with a <HI>dangerous weapon,</HI> as shews a malicious and deliberate intent to do mischief, and death ensues, it is <HI>express malice</HI> from the nature of the fact, and <HI>murder.</HI></Q> Wood's Inst. 3 Book, p. 608. And this must always be the case when men presume to decide their quarrels <HI>with dan∣gerous weapons,</HI> be quarrels <HI>even so sudden or unpre∣meditated:</HI> for the <HI>"malice"</HI> is by the weapons, <HI>expressed,</HI> and the <HI>"malice prepensed"</HI> is therefore <HI>im∣plied.</HI></NOTE>; which equally fulfils <HI>"the genuine sense of malitia,"</HI> though, perhaps, the <HI>prepensed malice</HI> may, more properly (<HI>upon a sudden provocation</HI> as above) be said to be <HI>implied</HI> than <HI>express.</HI> But whether it be <HI>express</HI> or <HI>implied,</HI> it undoubtedly constitutes <HI>murder;</HI> for <HI>malice</HI> is the leading circumstance which distin∣guishes <HI>manslaughter</HI> from <HI>murder,</HI> and
<PB N="57" REF="76"/>therefore <HI>an express evil design,</HI> such as is apparent in the <HI>voluntary killing</HI> of a man, cannot be admitted under the head of <HI>simple homicide</HI> or <HI>manslaughter,</HI> because the necessary difference is wanting <HI>in the degree of the offence</HI> according to the ex∣cellent rule before cited from Sir Mat∣thew Hale, viz.— <Q>murder being ag∣gravated with <HI>malice presumed or im∣plied;</HI> but manslaughter <HI>not,</HI></Q> &amp;c. 1 Hale, P. C. 466.</P>
<P>I may probably seem guilty of much tautology in this little Work; but hope my Readers will excuse it, in consideration of the necessity I am under, of repeatedly comparing the Crimes of <HI>striking with a weapon</HI> in <HI>sudden Anger,</HI> and of <HI>voluntary Killing,</HI> with so many other different cases, wherein even <HI>involuntary</HI> and <HI>acci∣dental</HI> Killing have been solemnly adjudged <HI>Murder:</HI> and I apprehend that <HI>the seve∣rity</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="77"/>of the Law, in the last-mentioned cases, must sufficiently demonstrate such <HI>a general abhorrence in our Law</HI> to the shedding of <HI>Human Blood,</HI> that we can∣not reasonably suppose <HI>the same Law</HI> ca∣pable of admitting an excuse for <HI>volun∣tary Manslaughter</HI> on any private differ∣ence, howsoever great the provocation. Nevertheless, Mr. Hawkins ventures to assert a very different doctrine in his Pleas of the Crown, 1 Book c. xxviii. § 24. <Q>I see no reason (says he) why a person, who without Provocation is assaulted by another in any place whatsoever, in such a Manner as plainly shews an intent to murder him, as by discharg∣ing a Pistol, or pushing at him with a drawn Sword, &amp;c. may not <HI>justify Kill∣ing</HI> such an Assailant, as much as if he had attempted to rob him: for is not he, who attempts to Murder me (says he) more injurious than he
<PB N="59" REF="78"/>who barely attempts to rob me? And can it be more justifiable to fight for my goods than for my Life? And it is not only highly agreeable to reason, that a Man in such circumstances may <HI>lawfully Kill</HI> another, but it seems also to be confirmed by <HI>the general Tenor of our Law-books,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But howsoever specious this argument may appear, I hope I have already pro∣ved <HI>"by the general Tenor of our Law∣books;"</HI> that the <HI>Justifiable Killing</HI> of a Man must be through <HI>an inevitable necessity:</HI> and therefore what Mr. Haw∣kins afterwards advances, in his com∣parison of such a case with Homicide in <HI>se Defendendo,</HI> cannot in the least justify either his opinion on that point, or his assertion concerning <Q>the general Tenor of the Law-books.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="79"/>He endeavours to represent <HI>the Volun∣tary Killing</HI> of a Man as <HI>Justifiable Ho∣micide,</HI> and consequently he must sup∣pose it a less crime than <HI>Excusable Ho∣micide,</HI> in <HI>se Defendendo.</HI></P>
<P>He founds his opinion in the suppo∣sition of "some <HI>precedent Quarrel</HI>" in the latter, "in which" (says he) <Q>both parties always are, or at least may <HI>justly be supposed</HI> to have been, in some fault, so that the necessity, to which a Man is at length reduced to kill another, is in some measure pre∣sumed to be owing to himself:</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But may it not, as <HI>"justly be supposed"</HI> that the person, who <HI>Kills</HI> without <HI>such ne∣cessity,</HI> is also <HI>"in some fault?"</HI> Is not the <HI>Presumption of Law</HI> against him (as I have elsewhere shewn) by the <HI>bloody</HI> FACT, when he cannot prove that <HI>he endea∣voured,</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="80"/>at least, to retreat, in order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed? And is not FACT a more substantial ground for a criminal charge, than any idea that a Court can possibly form concerning the <HI>Murderous Intentions,</HI> which <HI>the Killer</HI> may attribute to <HI>the person Killed?</HI></P>
<P>The single circumstance that <HI>the Killer</HI> was under <HI>no necessity</HI> of endeavouring to retreat, and avoid the assailant, is not only a proof that <HI>his own intentions</HI> (though he might not be the first aggressor) were nearly as criminal, as those he attri∣butes to the <HI>person Killed,</HI> but it also af∣fords a strong presumption, that <HI>the latter</HI> was not very strenuous or sanguine, either in his attack, or in his supposed <HI>inten∣tion to commit murder:</HI> so that the very pretence, by which Mr. Hawkins en∣deavours to justify such a <HI>voluntary Kill∣ing,</HI> must necessarily fall to the ground,
<PB N="62" REF="81"/>whenever <HI>the Killer</HI> is unable to prove, that he endeavoured to avoid the attack<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">I have already made the necessary exceptions con∣cerning Civil Officers in the legal Execution of jus∣tice, &amp;c.</NOTE>. And though the Deceased might have had <HI>"a Weapon Drawn,"</HI> yet that cir∣cumstance affords no positive proof of his <HI>criminal intention;</HI> for he might have thought himself obliged to draw in his own defence, through a reciprocal suspi∣cion of his adversary's <HI>criminal intentions:</HI> and as he cannot plead his own cause, it is reasonable that the Law should <HI>presume,</HI> that he really did draw in his own de∣fence, especially as the circumstance, that <HI>the Killer</HI> was under no necessity of en∣deavouring to avoid him, affords a suffi∣cient Ground for such <HI>a presumption:</HI></P>
<P>And even in cases where it may be supposed that the <HI>person Killed</HI> might
<PB N="63" REF="82"/>really have had <HI>"an intent to murder,"</HI> we ought to remember that the Laws of England do not punish men <HI>merely</HI> for their <HI>"criminal intentions"</HI> without some fact! and, therefore, it would be highly absurd to suppose, that the Law, without some apparent necessity, would entrust every individual, indiscriminately, with a supream Authority, which it de∣nies <HI>even</HI> to the Highest and most solemn Courts of Justice; I mean an Authority to inflict capital punishment without a previous Trial <HI>per pares;</HI> and that mere∣ly for <HI>"a Criminal Intention;"</HI> which, in many cases, might as easily, (through fear, passion, or violent prejudice) be mistaken, or imaginary, as be real!</P>
<P>And therefore <Q><HI>an Assault upon the Person</HI></Q> is not (as I have before in∣sisted in p. 5. against the opinion of Judge
<PB N="64" REF="83"/>Foster) <Q>a Provocation sufficient to free <HI>the Party Killing</HI> from the Guilt of Murder.</Q></P>
<P>The case of Gentlemen in the Army, nevertheless, seems peculiarly hard upon such unhappy occasions. The first prin∣ciple of their profession is <HI>Courage;</HI> and the World, in general, is too de∣praved to distinguish in what cases a Man of <HI>true Courage</HI> may retreat <HI>with honour</HI> from the Assault of an Enemy; so that Military Men are liable to be <HI>un∣justly</HI> despised, whenever they act <HI>rea∣sonably</HI> in cases either of insult, or as∣sault!</P>
<P>Yet, at the same time, it ought to be remembered, that those men who submit to <HI>the Slavish Yoke</HI> of other Men's de∣praved opinions or unreasonable customs
<PB N="65" REF="84"/>(in contradiction to that <HI>natural Know∣ledge</HI> of <HI>Good and Evil,</HI> which they in∣herit, in common with the rest of Man∣kind, from our first Parents), cannot <HI>justly</HI> be deemed <HI>Men of Honour;</HI> and, conse∣quently, are unworthy of <HI>Rank</HI> in the honourable Profession of Arms. And though such men may support an out∣ward <HI>appearance</HI> of <HI>Courage</HI> in the eye of the world, by <HI>daring</HI> to violate the Laws of God and Man in <HI>private</HI> Quarrels, yet that very act affords the most manifest token of the Want of <HI>real</HI> and <HI>steady Courage;</HI> for unless the submission to that depraved custom can be attributed to <HI>inconsideration, or</HI> to <HI>the want of Know∣ledge,</HI> it must necessarily be supposed, that the <HI>Duellist had not sufficient Courage</HI> to assert his <HI>natural Right</HI> of Acting agree∣able to the Dictates of his <HI>own reason and conscience;</HI> and was <HI>unable to face the Ter∣rors</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="85"/>of <HI>an</HI> adverse Fortune <HI>in a good Cause;</HI> and therefore, like a wretched <HI>Coward,</HI> he yielded himself a prisoner and slave to the fashionable Depravity!</P>
<P>I am far from meaning however to charge all Soldiers with Cowardice that have fought Duels: sometimes Passion and false Pride, but more frequently in∣consideration, and ignorance of the Laws of God and Man (as I have before hinted) occasion the base submission and conformity to those <HI>false</HI> and <HI>unreasonable notions of Honour,</HI> which almost universally prevail.</P>
<P>Nor do I so much blame the Military Gentlemen, for this unnatural depravity, as I do the Professors of the Law; who ought to have set them a better example, and yet, have rather contributed to <HI>the ignorance of the times,</HI> by the many <HI>gross perversions</HI> of <HI>our Law,</HI> which they
<PB N="67" REF="86"/>have admitted into the Books. Gentle∣men of the Army are not obliged, in∣deed, to acquire a critical knowledge of the Law, but they must not forget that they are <HI>Men,</HI> as well as <HI>Soldiers;</HI> and that if they do not maintain the Natural Privilege of <HI>Men,</HI> (viz. that of thinking for themselves, and acting agreeable to the Dictates of their <HI>own Conscience,</HI> as Members of the Community), they are unfit for <HI>British Soldiers,</HI> of whom the <HI>Law</HI> requires an acknowledgment of <HI>her supremacy.</HI></P>
<P>For the Law will not excuse an <HI>un∣lawful Act</HI> by a Soldier, even though he commits it by <HI>the express Command</HI> of the highest military Authority in the King∣dom: and much less is the Soldier obliged to conform himself <HI>implicitly</HI> to the mere opinions and false Notions of
<PB N="68" REF="87"/>Honour, which his Superiors may have unfortunately adopted. — Even in pub∣lick military Service, or warlike Expe∣ditions by <HI>National authority,</HI> the Law manifestly requires the Soldier <HI>to think for himself;</HI> and to consider, before he acts in any war, whether the same be <HI>just;</HI> for, if it be otherwise, the Com∣mon Law of this Kingdom will <HI>impute</HI> to him <HI>the Guilt</HI> of <HI>Murder.</HI></P>
<P>And though the Law does not actually punish such general Crimes, as may un∣fortunately have obtained, at any time, the Sanction of Government, yet the time will certainly come, when all such temporizing military <HI>Murderers</HI> must be responsible for the innocent blood that is shed in an <HI>unjust</HI> War, if they have ren∣dered themselves <HI>accessaries to it by an im∣plicit,</HI> and, therefore, <HI>criminal</HI> obedience
<PB N="69" REF="88"/>to the promoters of it. <Q>Item fit Ho∣micidium <HI>in Bello,</HI></Q> (says the learned Bracton) <Q>et tunc videndum utrum <HI>Bellum</HI> sit <HI>justum</HI> vel <HI>injustum.</HI> Si au∣tem <HI>injustum,</HI> tenebitur occisor: si au∣tem <HI>justum,</HI> sicut <HI>pro defensione pa∣triae,</HI> non tenebitur, nisi hoc <HI>fecerit corrupta voluntate et intentione</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bracton, Lib. 3. c. 4. <HI>de Corona,</HI> p. 121.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Men of <HI>true honour,</HI> therefore, at the same time that they are sensible of their duty as <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Subjects</HI> to their King, must be mindful that they are <HI>subject also to the empire of reason,</HI> and are bound thereby, in common with all mankind, to maintain the <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>natural freedom</HI> of Human Nature: and those Soldiers, who, in addition to their natural reason, have a true sense of Religion, will not only be mindful, that they are Soldiers and
<PB N="70" REF="89"/>Subjects to an earthly King, but that they are also <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Subjects</HI> to <HI>the King of Kings;</HI> whose Laws and precepts they will, on all occasions, prefer <HI>to every other command;</HI> and will obey the same with such a <HI>steady courage,</HI> as may be equal to every adversity, and undeserved suffering that threatens them.</P>
<P>It was this indispensible, this happy disposition, and sense of <HI>superior duty,</HI> which prevailed even in an unlawful stand∣ing Army, that had been <HI>raised,</HI> and was <HI>expresly designed</HI> for arbitrary purposes, and which, nevertheless, contrary to all expectation, exerted itself in saving this Kingdom, at the Glorious Revolution, from the Political Slavery, which then threatened it, as well as from the more intolerable Tyranny of the Romish Re∣ligion.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="90"/>The Soldier, therefore, who has not <HI>Courage enough</HI> to profess, on all occasions, a strict obedience to the <HI>Laws of his Country,</HI> according to the dictates of his <HI>own reason</HI> and <HI>Conscience, in preference to every command, and every other opinion what∣ever,</HI> is unworthy of the British military service; being qualified rather to be in∣listed with the slavish Troops of the <HI>Grand Monarch</HI> of France; or to serve in the Black Banditti of the Emperor of Morocco!</P>
<P>But I must return once more to the opinions of the Professors of Law— <Q>it is said <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">This opinion is in the true stile of a <HI>Tradition,</HI> such as those, by which the Jews of old <HI>"perverted the Law."</HI></NOTE>, that if he who draws upon an∣other <HI>in a sudden Quarrel,</HI> make no pass at him <HI>till his sword is drawn,</HI> and then fight with him, and <HI>Kill him,</HI> he is guilty
<PB N="72" REF="91"/>of <HI>Manslaughter</HI> only,</Q> &amp;c. 1 Haw∣kins Pleas of the Crown, c. xxxi. § 28. for which he quotes Kelynge 55. 61. and 131: but <HI>the pretence</HI> for this indul∣gence is as <HI>frivolous</HI> as the Doctrine is <HI>false,</HI> viz. <Q>because (says Mr. Hawkins) that by neglecting the opportunity of Killing the other before he was on his guard, and in a condition to defend himself, with like Hazard to both, he shewed that his <HI>intent</HI> was not so much to <HI>kill,</HI> as to <HI>combat</HI> with the other, in compliance with those <HI>com∣mon notions of Honour,</HI></Q> &amp;c.—But is "not the intent <HI>to kill,</HI>" or to do some bodily harm, and certainly, at least, the Risque of <HI>Killing,</HI> included in the intention <HI>"to Combat" with dangerous weapons?</HI> And is it <HI>Justice?</HI> Nay! is it <HI>common Sense</HI> to excuse a <HI>Notorious Crime,</HI> by the Plea of an <HI>intention</HI> to commit another Crime almost as bad?</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="92"/>I have already shewn, by fair com∣parison with a variety of cases, that the crime of wilfully <HI>striking</HI> or <HI>Combating with weapons in sudden Anger,</HI> is a much more <HI>unlawful act</HI> than many others, wherein even <HI>involuntary and accidental Homicide</HI> has been solemnly ajudged <HI>Murder,</HI> and has been generally admitted as such by the Sages of our Law in their Reports; and it will therefore be highly disgraceful to our Law, but more parti∣cularly (because <HI>deservedly</HI>) to the pro∣fessors of it, if they should still persist in the <HI>unreasonable</HI> and <HI>unjust</HI> practice of pu∣nishing <HI>lesser</HI> Crimes with <HI>more</HI> severity than the crying <HI>Sin</HI> of <HI>voluntary Man∣slaughter,</HI> which (as I have already proved in my preface) is absolutely <HI>un∣pardonable in this World,</HI> by the Laws of God!</P>
