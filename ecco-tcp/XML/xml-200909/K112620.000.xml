Thus Your Com∣mand giving Rise to this Undertaking, I have presumed to make the Dedication to Y. GR.</P>

<P><PB REF="4"/>Among these things for which You stand Obliged to the Wise Conduct of Providence, One is, That You have been so well Directed in the Happy Choice of Your Consorts: Your Present LADY of a Sweet and Gentle Temper, Her Carriage Obliging and Discreet to all, Her Loving to Entertain Pious and Religious Dis∣course, Her Modest and Exemplary Dress: I wish She may prove a Blessing to Y.

<HEAD>PREFACE To the READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> shall not insist on an Apology, why I trouble the Sweating Press, tho I might use and plead the common Topicks taken from the Advice and Impor∣tunity of others, and to prevent the Publishing of some of these Remarks, excerpt from my Papers, by some, into whose hands, they had fallen, after they had lien by me several Months.</P>
<P>There are several Grave Persons in these Isles of good and solid Judgment, both Ministers and Others, who being better acquainted with the Places of their ordinary Residence, then it can be supposed I had occasion to be, might have Published some∣thing more Valuable on this Head, and set their Remarks in a clearer Light. As likewise some of my Dear Brethren of the <HI>Commission,</HI> might have done it to greater Advantage. Yet the En∣gagements that lay on me, to Transcribe the most Remarkable Occurrences, and the Solicitation of some thereupon, to Publish them, have some way obliged me to make this Appearance. However if others
<PB REF="9"/>
hereby shall be excited to serve the Publick, by giv∣ing a fuller and clearer <HI>Description</HI> of these Gener∣ally little known Places, this Essay will not prove al∣together unuseful. And if I had known that any in∣tended to have Published something of this nature, the World had not been troubled with my Scribling.</P>
<P>I hope none will judge, that I Act without my Line, in giving Descriptions of this Nature, see∣ing all are called to <HI>Remember the Works of the Lord and Talk of His Doings,</HI> as they have occasion: And all along, I endeavour to keep in mind the Character I bear, dropping something of a Spiritual Improvement.</P>
<P>Our Historians, such as I have consulted, have given but a very brief and lame, and in some things a false Account of these places, especially <HI>Zetland,</HI> which is unknown to the most of the Nation, if not that they have only heard, there were such Isles, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Zetlandick.</HI> It is true, there is one Mr▪ <HI>Wallace</HI> a late Minister in <HI>Orkney,</HI> who hath gratified the World, by giving a Description, of the <HI>Orkney-Isles;</HI> But neither <HI>Zetland</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Caithness</HI> doth he meddle with: And as to <HI>Ork∣ney,</HI> there are several things which deserve their own Remark, he makes no mention of; And others have fallen out since his time, which I have noticed So that, on the whole, the Account now given even of <HI>Orkney,</HI> will appear almost new to any, who shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be pleased to compare the two Descriptions together.</P>
<P>No doubt but such as know these Places, will de∣siderate several things no less Remarkable, then wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are Observed; But still my Reader would remem∣ber, That this is but a Diary Transcribed. Yet thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="10"/>
may say, as I have not willingly suffered my self <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be imposed on, so neither have I imposed any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Credulous World, but delivered such things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich either I was witness to, or had good ground <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beleive from Persons worthy of Credit. So that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any thing appear Questionable, I have ordinarly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n general given my Author for it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Omne tulit punctum qui mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cuit uti∣le dulci.</NOTE></P>
<P>I suppose the judicious Reader in perusing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollowing sheets, will find things borh Curious and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstructive, affording matter of Meditation to the Wise Observers of Providence.</P>
<P>As to any Philosophical or Philological Observes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s I am unfit for, so am I far from a Magisterial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ictating of them to any, but soberly proposed my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn Sentiments, which if my Reader do not relish, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e may follow his own.</P>
<P>Altho the Style be not Quaint and Elegant, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbellishd with the Ornaments of Art; yet I hope it will be found plain and intelligible; and tho sometimes obliged to express my self in the Dialect or Idiotism of the Countrey, yet ordinarily such Words and Phrases are some way explained. So when I speak of <HI>Orkney</HI> or <HI>Zetland,</HI> as not in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho depending thereupon, I express my self, as the Countrey do.</P>
<P>As to the Commissions Work I have not meddled therewith, except when the threed of the History did require me to touch it. However this I may add, Our weak endeavours, for the Advance∣ment of the Interest of Our <HI>LORD JESUS,</HI> in these remote Corners, have not been found, by Su∣periour Judicatories, altogether unsuccessful; And, I suppose, it repents none of us, of our Voyage thi∣ther; however dangerous it did prove.</P>

<P>It is observable that the Names of the Descendants of the old Inhabitants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Names.</NOTE> differ from the Names of others now numerous among them, for these only have a Name without a Sirname, save what is taken from their Fa∣thers Name, and by adding Son or Daughter thereun∣to, <HI>Exemp.

Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Minister of the place told me, that about 20 years agoe there were two Fisher-boats there, who coming nig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Wells, the Men in the one Boat seing their dan¦ger, one of these men thus afraid took hold of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other Boat by them, and both Boats were swallowed up. One of the Ministers of <HI>Zetland</HI> told me, ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were three of these Boats, it so falling out, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passed the Firth the very day after they perished: Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> notwithstanding of these dangers, the Fishers will no desist from fishing about these Wells, for they observ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the nearer they come to them, they have the Fishe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both greater, better and more numerous, so the Fish¦es draw the Men, and the Wells draw both.</P>
<P>Near to these Skerries, before <HI>Barwick</HI> formerly mentioned, are also 2 or 3 Wells, called the <HI>Wells o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tiftala,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And of <HI>Tiftala</HI></NOTE> only dangerous in a Flood as the <HI>Wells of Swin¦na</HI> are in an Ebb, these Wells, as some do judge ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> caused by an Hiatus or Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Earth below: Further I would offer this consideration, that whereas all these Wells are nigh unto ragged Rocks, con∣stantly beat upon by the Tides, there may be some secre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conveyances of the Water into Cavernes at the bottom of the Rock, from which they may pass into some other places, where they rise again, and that even in the same Firth, tho such places be unknown, as it is storied of many Rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they come to whirle and be so dan∣gerous.</NOTE> which fall into, and run many Miles below the Earth and come out again in other places. But that which I judge to be more simple, is that several Tides running upon the Rocks, and thence returning and meeting with other Tides cause such a Whirle, as we see behind Mill-wheels some of the water coming from, and another part as it were appear∣ing

suffer the Fishes to go in, but not to go out, out of which sometimes they will take several Horses burdens of Fish. The other way they take them is by a Net; where with they Fish a Pool, which lyeth a little be∣low the Crues, and is about a pair of buts in length: They having spread the net upon the bank, which is long enough to reach the breadth of the Water, they go in with it, and one Man on each side drawing it down the Pool, it is followed with 18. or 20. Men. going in a breast behind it, with long staves or Poles in their hands; wherewith they keep the net to the ground, and loose it when any way entangled; the Pool in some places will rise to the height of the breasts of the wa∣ders, but there is no danger. So they bring down the Net softly and warily to the mouth of an Enclo∣sure, which they call a <HI>Stem,</HI> into which the Fishes are driven, where the Fishers standing with this larger Net, others take a lesser Net and going therewith into the <HI>Stem,</HI> catch the Fishes so enclosed, that scarce one can escape, for up the Water they cannot run, because of the larger Net, and neither down can they go, be∣cause of the Stem, or Stones laid together in form of a Wall, We saw as we could conjecture at one draught upwards of 300. good Salmonds taken, and these who have this Fishing told us that 3 Years ago, they took 500. at a draught, and going through the Pool at the same time with the Net again, they catched other 200, which Salmond for the most part they salt in barrels and sends abroad. It is also to be observed that the Salmond keep this Water of <HI>Thurso</HI> all the Year over, and in the Winter Season in Frost and Snow if you break the ice, they are to be had.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ, yet are there many evils from which we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>purged until this Day, For beside the abounding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andals, breaking out to the Dishonour of God, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eproach of Religion, and the Grief of the Godly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere are many Superstitious Fopperies, Charms, Heath∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish and Popish Rites, to which some especially in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose Isles, are so much addicted, that it proves a most difficult peice of Work to the most zealous Ministers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>get them reformed.</P>
<P>As all should have it much upon their hearts, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere should be any such dreadful evils now remaining, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all invested with Authority Civil or Ecclesiastick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t called to employ their utmost endeavours, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rpation of all Idolatrous Monuments, and rasing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> old Chappels so much abused, and that conform to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct of Assembly: The Government commanding the Magistrates of these respective bounds so to do, for un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that this be, Ministers endeavours whither by Do∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rine or Discipline will be the less successful.</P>
<P>Which obstinacy of these poor deluded Souls per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting in their sin and folly, sheweth the Malice and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>btilty of that early and grand Enemie of Man's Sal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, labouring to keep some footing in these Isles, so be his deadly wound might be healed, which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaching of the Gospel, the Rod of Gods Power hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven him.</P>
<P>That which gives great advantage to Satan, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ameful Ignorance that abounds in this Day of Gos∣pel-Light, this is to him an useful Handle, whereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> keeps his Subjects under his Empire in his Hellish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amnable Service, for while this Vail is on the eye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Soul, poor People are not capable of discerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is right or wrong and so are led hood-winkt to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell; "Tenebrae sunt Visus impeditivae.

<P>Blessed are they then who are priviledged with t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Means of Knowledge, Schools for the Education their Youth, and to whom the doors of the Sanctua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stand open from time to time, where God by his M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦nisters teacheth Knowledge to those who enquire his Mouth. Happy they who know and improve the Mercy, the joyful Sound given by the Silver-Trumpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Gospel every Lord's-Day; who do receive t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Truth in Love; And so must we account for our Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦cy; if from the heart we have believed and obeyed t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gospel.</P>
<P>Beside the Book of Grace, giving light to the Chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Christ, we have also the large expanded Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Creation, whose lines are gone out through all t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Earth, whence we may spell the Being of a God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wisdom, Goodness and Power; The Heavens decla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Glory, and the Firmament sheweth his hand Work; the various Tides; the Ebbing and the Flowi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sea, bounded by the Sand and Rocks, which it da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beateth on, the Fowls of the Air and Fishes of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> each frequenting their proper habitation, do all Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦claim aloud the Glory of him who created them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Almighty Power preserving them in their beautiful a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wonderful order, and his Infinite Wisdom governi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and directing them to their several ends, to which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are by him appointed.</P>

<P>To conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.9; 10.12.</NOTE> We see now but through a glass dark∣ly, we know only in part, but when that which is per∣fect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away, And this also we may apply to the Works of Creation. Most happy we if after all our Travels, Voyages and Labours of whatever kind, we arrive at that place of perfection, where the Militant State of the Church, shall be changed into that of a Triumphant, where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary be at rest; When tears shall be wiped from the eyes, sorrow and sighing shall flee away; When that desirable Day shall break, and all shadows be gone; When Satan shall be bruised under our feet, and Death and all its black Retinue be swallowed up in Life and Victory; When no more Darkness in the Understanding, Perverse∣ness in the Will, Disorder in the Aflections, or sense of Guilt in the Conscience. When our Duty shall be Praise, our Grace a burning Love even to a bodily present Christ, and our Work shall be to follow the Lamb, whi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hersoever he goeth, and so be for ever with the Lord.</P>
