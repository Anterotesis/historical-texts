<HEAD>LETTER FROM <HI>THOMAS PAINE &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>August, 3, 1796.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS censure is but awkwardly softened by apology, I shall offer you no apology for this letter. The eventful crisis, to which your double politics have conducted the affairs of your country, requires an investigation uncramped by ceremony.</P>
<P>There was a time when the fame of America, moral and po∣litical, stood fair and high in the world. The lustre of her revolution extended itself to every individual, and to be a ci∣tizen of America, gave a title to respect in Europe. Neither meanness nor ingratitude had then mingled in the composition of her character. Her resistances to the attempted tyranny of England left her unsuspected of the one, and her open ac∣knowledgment of the aid she received from France precluded all suspicion of the other. The politics of Washington had not then appeared.</P>
<P>At the time I left America (April 1787) the continental Convention, that formed the federal constitution, was on the point of meeting. Since that time new schemes of politics, and new distinctions of parties, have arisen. The term <HI>An∣tifederalist</HI> has been applied to all those who combated the de∣fects of that constitution, or opposed the measures of your administration. It was only to the absolute necessity of estab∣lishing some federal authority, extending equally over all the States, that an instrument so inconsistent as the present federal constitution is, obtained a suffrage. I would have voted for it myself, had I been in America, or even for a worse, rather than have had none; provided it contained the means of re∣medying its defects by the same appeal to the people, by which it was to be established. It is always better policy to leave removable errors to expose themselves, than to hazard too much in contending against them theoretically.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3"/>I have introduced these observations not only to mark the general difference between Antifederalist and Anticonstitution∣alist, but to preclude the effect, and even the application, of the former of these terms to myself. I declare myself opposed to several matters in the constitution, particularly to the man∣ner in which what is called the executive is formed, and to the long duration of the senate; and it I live to return to America, I will use all my endeavours to have them altered. I also de∣clare myself opposed to almost the whole of your administra∣tion; for I know it to have been deceitful, if not perfidious, as I shall show in the course of this letter. But as to the point of consolidating the States into a federal government, it so happens, that the proposition for that purpose came originally from myself. I proposed it in a letter to chancellor Livingston in the spring of the year 1782, whilst that gentleman was mi∣nister for foreign affairs. The five per cent duty recommended by congress had then fallen through, having been adopted by some of the States, altered by others, rejected by Rhode Island, and repealed by Virginia, after it had been consented to. The proposal in the letter I allude to, was to get over the whole difficulty at once, by annexing a continental legislative body to Congress; for in order to have any law of the Union uni∣form, the case could only be, that either Congress, as it then stood, must frame the law, and the States severally adopt it without alteration, or, the States must elect a continental le∣gislature for the purpose. Chancellor Livingston, Robert Morris, Governor Morris, and myself, had a meeting at the house of Robert Morris on the subject of that letter. There was no diversity of opinion on the proposition for a continen∣tal legislature: the only difficulty was on the manner of bring∣ing the proposition forward. For my own part, as I considered it as a remedy in reserve, that could be applied at any time, <HI>when the States saw themselves wrong enough to be put right</HI> (which did not appear to be the case at that time,) I did not fee the propriety of urging it precipitately, and declined being the publisher of it myself. After this account of a fact, the leaders of your party will scarcely have the hardiness to apply to me the term of Antifederalist. But I can go to a date and to a fact beyond this. for the proposition for electing a conti∣nental convention. To form the continental government is one of the subjects treated of in the pamphlet <HI>Common Sense.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus cleared away a little of the rubbish that might otherwise have lain in my way, I return to the point of time at which the present federal constitution and your administra∣tion began. It was very well said by an anonymous writer in Philadelphia, about a year before that period, that <HI>"thirteen
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>staves and ne'er a hoop will not make a barrel;"</HI> and as any kind of hooping the barrel. however defectively executed, would be better than none, it was scarcely possible but that conside∣rable advantages must arise from the federal hooping of the States. It was with pleasure that every sincere friend to Ame∣rica beheld as the natural effect of union, her rising prosperity, and it was with grief they saw that prosperity mixed, even in the bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>om, with the germ of corruption. Monopolies of every kind marked your administration almost in the moment of its commencement. The lands obtained by the revolution were lavished upon partizans; the interest of the disbanded soldier was sold to the speculator; injustice was acted under the presence of faith; and the chief of the army became the patron of the fraud. From such a beginning what else could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e expected, than what has happened? A mean and servile sub∣mission to the insults of one nation; treachery and ingratitude to another.</P>
<P>Some vices make their approach with such a splendid ap∣pearance, that we scarcely know to what class of moral dis∣tinctions they belong. They are rather virtues corrupted than vices originally. But meanness and ingratitude have nothing equivocal in their character. There is not a trait in them that renders them doubtful. They are so originally vice, that they are generated in the dung of other vices, and crawl into ex∣istence with the filth upon their back. The fugitives have found protection in you, and the levee-room is their place of rendezvous.</P>
<P>As the federal constitution is a copy, though not quite so base a the original, of the form of the British government, an imitation of its vices was naturally to be expected. So inti∣mate is the connection between <HI>form</HI> and <HI>practice,</HI> that to adopt the one is to invite the other. Imitation is naturally progres∣sive, and is rapidly so in matters that are vicious.</P>
<P>Soon after the federal constitution arrived in England, I re∣ceived a letter from a female literary correspondent (a native of New York) very well mixed with friendship, sentiment, and politics. In my answer to that letter, I permitted myself to ramble into the wilderness of imagination, and to anticipate what might hereafter be the condition of America. I had no idea that the picture I then drew was realising so fast, and still less that Mr. Washington was hurrying it on. As the extract I allude to is congenial with the subject I am upon, I here tran∣scribe it:</P>
<Q><P>You touch me on a very tender point, when you say, <HI>that my friends on your side the water cannot be reconciled to the idea of my abandoning America even for my native England.</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>They are right. I had rather see my horse Button eating the grass of Bordentown or Morrissania, than see all the pomp and shew of Europe.</P>
<P>A thousand year hence, for I must indulge a few thoughts, perhaps in less, America may be what England now is. The innocence of her character, that won the hearts of all na∣tions in her favour, may sound like a romance, and her inimitable virtue as if it had never been. The ruins of that liberty, which thousands bled to obtain, may just furnish materials for a village tale, or extort a sigh from rustic sen∣sibility: while the fashionable of that day, enveloped in diffication, shall deride the principle, and deny the fact.</P>
<P>When we contemplate the fall of empires, and the ex∣tinction of the nations of the ancient world, we see but little more to excite our regret than the mouldering ruins of pompous palaces, magnificent monuments, lofty pyra∣mids, and walls and towers of the most costly workman∣ship: but when the empire of America shall fall, the sub∣ject for contemplative sorrow will be infinitely greater than crumbling brass, or marble can inspire. It will not then be said. Here stood a temple of vast antiquity, here rose a Babel of invisible height, or there a Palace of sum∣tuous extravagance; but, Here, ah painful thought! the noblest work of human wisdom, the greatest scene of human glory, the fair cause of freedom, rose and fell: Read this, and then ask if I forget America!</P></Q>
<P>Impressed as I was, with apprehensions of this kind, I had America constantly in my mind in all the publications I afterwards made. The First, and still more, the Second Part of the Rights of Man, bear evident marks of this watchful∣ness; and the dissertations on First Principles of Government goes more directly to the point than either of the former. I now pass on to other subjects.</P>
<P>It will be supposed by those into whose hands this letter may fall, that I have some personal resentment against you: and I will therefore settle this point before I proceed further.</P>
<P>If I have any resentment, you must acknowledge that I have not been hasty in declaring it, neither would it now be declared (for what are private resentments to the public) if the cause of it did not unite itself as well with your public as with your private character, and with the motives of your political conduct.</P>
<P>The part I acted in the American revolution is well known. I shall not here repeat it. I know also, that, had it not been for the aid received from France, in men, money, and ships, your cold and unmilitary conduct (as I shall shew in the course
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>of this letter) would in all probability have lost America; at least she would not have been the independant nation she now is. You slept away your time in the field, till the finances of the country were completely exhausted, and you have but little share in the glory of the final event. It is time, sir, to speak the undisguised language of historical truth.</P>
<P>Elevated to the chair of the presidency, you assumed the merit of every thing to yourself; and the natural ingratitude o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your constitution began to appear. You commenced your presidental career by encouraging and swallowing the grossest adulation; and you travelled America from one end to the other to put yourself in the way of receiving it. You have as many addresses in your chest as James the Second. As to what were your views, for if you are not great enough to have ambition you are little enough to have vanity, they cannot be directly inferred from expressions of your own; but the par∣tizans of your politics have divulged the secret.</P>
<P>John Adams has said, (and John it is known was always a speller after places and offices, and never thought his little ser∣vices were highly enough paid) John has said, that as Mr. Washington had no child, the presidency should be made he∣reditary in the family of Lun Washington. John might then have counted upon some sinecure for himself, and a provision for his descendants. He did not go so far as to say also, that the vice presidency should be hereditary in the family of John Adams. He prudently left that to stand upon the ground, that one good turn deserves another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two persons, to whom John Adams said this, told me of it. The secretary of Mr. Jay was present when it was told to me.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>John Adams is one of those men who never contemplated the origin of government, or comprehended any thing of first principles. If he had, he might have seen, that the right to set up and establish hereditary government never did, and never can, exist in any generation at any time whatever; that it is of the nature of treason, because it is an attempt to take away the rights of all the minors living at that time, and of all succeeding generations. It is of a degree beyond com∣mon treason; it is a sin against nature. The equal rights of generations it is a right fixed in the nature of things, it belongs to the son when of age, as it belonged to the father before him. John Adams would himself deny the right that any former de∣ceased generation could have to decree authoritatively a succes∣sion of governors over him or over his children, and yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e assumes a pretended right, treasonable as it is, of acting it him∣self. His ignorance is his best excuse.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>John Jay has said, (and this John was always the sycophant of every thing in power, from Mr. Girard in America, to Gren∣ville in England) John Jay has said, that the senate should have been appointed for life. He would then have been sure of never wanting a lucrative appointment for himself, and have hand no fears about impeachment. These are the disguised traitors that call themselves federalists<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If Mr. John Jay desires to know on what authority I say this, I will give that authority publicly when he choses to call for it.</NOTE></P>
<P>Could I have known to what degree of corruption and per∣fidy the administrative part of the government of America had descended, I could have been at no loss to have understood the reservedness of Mr. Washington towards me during my impri∣sonment in the Luxembourg. There are cases in which silence is a loud language. I will here explain the cause of that impri∣sonment, and return to Mr. Washington afterwards.</P>
<P>In the course of that rage, terror and suspicion, which the brutal letter of the Duke of Brunswick first started into exist∣ence in France, it happened that almost every man who was opposed to violence, or who was not violent himself, became suspected. I had constantly been opposed to every thing which was of the nature, or of the appearance of violence; but as I had always done it in a manner that shewed it to be a principle founded in my heart, and not a political manoeuvre, it precluded the pretence of accusing me. I was reached however under another pretence.</P>
<P>A decree was passed to imprison all persons born in England; but as I was a member of the Convention, and had been com∣plimented with the honorary style of citizen of France, as Mr. Washington and some other Americans have been, this decree fell short of reaching me. A motion was afterwards, made and carried, supported chiefly by Bourdon de l'Oise, for expelling foreigners from the Convention. My expulsion being thus affected, the two committees of public safety and of general surety, of which Robespierre was the dictator, put me in ar∣restation under the former decree for imprisoning persons born in England. Having thus shewn under what pretence the imprisonment was affected, I come to speak of such parts of the case as apply between me and Mr. Washington, either as a president, or as an individual.</P>
<P>I have always considered that a foreigner, such as I was in fact, with respect to France, might be a member of a conven∣tion for framing a constitution, without affecting his right of citizenship, in the country to which he belongs, but not a
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>member of a government after a constitution is formed; and I have uniformly acted upon this distinction. To be a member of a government requires a person being in allegiance with that government and to the country locally. But a constitu∣tion, being a thing of principle, and not of action, and which after it is formed, is to be referred to the people for their ap∣probation or rejection, does not require allegiance in the per∣sons forming and proposing it; and besides this, it is only to the thing after it is formed and established, and to the country after its governmental character is fixed by the adoption of a constitution, that the allegiance can be given. No oath of allegiance or of citizenship was required of the members who composed the Convention: there was nothing existing in form to swear allegiance to. If any such condition had been re∣quired, I could not, as citizen of America, in fact, though citizen of France by compliment, have accepted a seat in the Convention.</P>
<P>As my citizenship in America was not altered or diminished by any thing I had done in Europe (on the contrary, it ought to have been considered as strengthened, for it was the Ameri∣can principle of government that I was endeavouring to spread in Europe), and as it is the duty of every government to charge itself with the care of any of its citizens who may happen to fall under an arbitrary persecution abroad, and this is also one of the reasons for which ambassadors or ministers are appointed, it was the duty of the executive department in America, to have made, at least some, enquiries about me, as soon as it heard of my imprisonment. But if this had not been the case, that government owed it to me on every ground and principle of honour and gratitude. Mr. Washington owed it to me on every score of private acquaintance, I will not now say friendship; for it has some time been known by those who know him, that he has no friendships, that he is incapable of forming any; he can serve or desert a man, or a cause, with constitutional indifference; and it is this cold hermaphrodite faculty that imposed itself upon the world, and was credited a while by enemies, as by friends for prudence, moderation, and impartiality.</P>
<P>Soon after I was put into arrestation, and imprisonment in the Luxembourg, the Americans who were then in Paris, went in a body to the bar of the Convention to reclaim me. They were answered by the then president Vadier, who has since absconded, that <HI>I was born in England,</HI> and it was sig∣nified to them, by some of the committee of general surety, to whom they were referred (I have been told it was Billaud Varennes), that their reclamation of me was only the act of
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>individuals, without any authority from the American govern∣ment.</P>
<P>A few days after this, all communication between persons imprisoned, and any person without the prison was cut off by an order of the police. I neither saw nor heard from any body for six months; and the only hope that remained to me was, that a new minister would arrive from America to super∣sede Morris, and that he would be authorised to inquire into the cause of my imprisonment: but even this hope, in the state to which matters were daily arriving, was too remote to have any consolatory effect, and I contented myself with the thought that I might be remembered when it would be too late. There is, perhaps, no condition from which a man, conscious of his own uprightness, cannot derive consolation; for it is in itself a consolation for him to find, that he can bear that condition with calmness and fortitude.</P>
<P>From about the middle of March (1794) to the fall of Ro∣bespierre, July 29, (9th of Thermidor) the state of things in the prisons was a continued scene of horror. No man could count upon life for twenty hours. To such a pitch of rage and suspicion, were Robespierre and his committee ar∣rived, that it seemed as if they feared to leave a man to live. Scarcely a night passed in which ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or more, were not taken out of the prison, carried be∣fore a pretended tribunal in the morning, and guillotined be∣fore night. One hundred and sixty-nine were taken out of the Luxembourg one night, in the month of July, and one hundred and sixty of them guillotined. A list of two hun∣dred more, according to the report in the prison, was prepar∣ing a few days before Robespierre fell. In this last list I have good reason to believe I was included. A memorandum in the hand writing of Robespierre was afterwards produced in the Convention, by the committee to whom the papers of Robespierre were referred, in these words: <Q>Demander que Thomas Paine soit decreté d'ac∣cusation pour l'interét de l'Amerique, autant que de la France.</Q> <Q>Demand that Thomas Paine, be decreed of accusa∣tion for the interest of America, as well as of France.</Q></P>
<P>I had been imprisoned seven months, and the silence of the executive part of the government of America (Mr. Washing∣ton) upon the case, and upon every thing respecting me, was explanation enough to Robespierre that he might proceed to extremities.</P>
<P>A violent fever which had nearly terminated my existence,
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>was, I believe, the circumstance that preserved it. I was not in a condition to be removed, or to know of what was pas∣sing, or of what had passed, for more than a month. It makes a blank in my remembrance of life. The first thing I was informed of was the fall of Robespierre.</P>
<P>About a week after this, Mr. Monroe arrived to supersede Governor Morris, and as soon as I was able to write a note le∣gible enough to be read, I found a way to convey one to him by means of the man who lighted the lamps in the prison; and whose unabated friendship to me, from whom he had never received any service, and with difficulty accepted any recompence, puts the character of Mr. Washington to shame.</P>
<P>In a few days I received a message from Mr. Monroe, con∣veyed to me in a note from an intermediate person, with as∣surance of his friendship, and expressing a desire that I would rest the case in his hands. After a fortnight or more had pas∣sed, and hearing nothing farther, I wrote to a friend who was then in Paris, a citizen of Philadelphia, requesting him to in∣form me what was the true situation of things with respect to me. I was sure that something was the matter, I began to have hard thoughts of Mr. Washington, but I was unwilling to encourage them.</P>
<P>In about ten days, I received an answer to my letter, in which the writer says, <Q>Mr. Monroe has told me that he has no order (meaning from the president, Mr. Washington) respecting you, but that he (Mr. Monroe) will do every thing in his power to liberate you; but, from what I learn from the Americans lately arrived in Paris, you are not con∣sidered, either by the American government, or by indi∣viduals, as an American citizen.</Q></P>
<P>I was now at no loss to understand Mr. Washington and his newfangled faction, and that their policy was silently to leave me to fall in France. They were rushing as fast as they could venture, without awakening the jealousy of America, into all the vices and corruptions of the British government; and it was no more consistent with the policy of Mr. Wash∣ington, and those who immediately surrounded him, than it was with that of Robespierre or of Pitt, that I should survive. They have, however, missed the mark, and the reaction is up∣on themselves.</P>
<P>Upon the receipt of the letter just alluded to, I sent a me∣morial to Mr. Monroe, which the reader will find in the ap∣pendix, and I received from him the following answer. It is dated the 18th of September, but did not come to hand till about the 18th of October. I was then falling into a relapse, the weather was becoming damp and cold, fuel was not be
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>had, and the abscess in my side, the consequence of those things, and of want of air and exercise, was beginning to form, and has continued immoveable ever since. Here fol∣lows Mr. Monroe's letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>September 18, 1794.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I was favoured, soon after my arrival here, with several letters from you, and more latterly with one in the character of memorial upon the subject of your confinement; and should have answered them at the times they were respectively written, had I not concluded, you would have calculated with certainty upon the deep interest I take in your welfare, and the pleasure with which I shall embrace every opportunity in my power to serve you. I should still pursue the same course, and for reasons which most obvious occur, if I did not find that you are disquieted with apprehensions upon interesting points, and which justice to you and our country equally forbid you should entertain. You mention that you have been informed you are not considered as an American citizen by the Ameri∣cans, and that you have likewise heard that I had no instruc∣tions respecting you by the government. I doubt not the person who gave you the information meant well, but I sus∣pect he did not even convey accurately his own ideas on the first point: for I presume the most he could say is, that you had likewise become a French citizen, and which by no means de∣prived you of being an American one. Even this however, may be doubted. I mean the acquisition of citizenship in France, and I confess you have said much to show that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not been made. I really suspect that this was all that the gentleman who wrote to you, and those Americans he heard speak upon the subject, meant. It becomes my duty, how∣ever to declare to you, that I consider you as an American citizen, and that you are considered univ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in that cha∣racter by the people of America. As such you are entitled to my attention; and so far as it can be given consistently with those obligations which are mutual between every government and even a transient passenger, you shall receive it.</P>
<P>The Congress have never decided upon the subject of citi∣zenship, in a manner to regard the present case. By being with us through the revolution, you are of our country as ab∣solutely as if you had been born there, and you are no more of England, than every native American is. This is the true doctrine in the present case, so far as it becomes complicated with any other consideration. I have mentioned it to make
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>you easy upon the only point which could give you any dis∣quietude</P>
<P>Is it necessary for me to tell you how much all your coun∣trymen, I speak of the great mass of the people, are inte∣rested. in your welfare! They have not forgotten the history or their own revolution, and the difficult scenes through which they passed; nor do they review its several stages with∣out reviving in their bosoms a due sensibility of the merits of those who served them in that great and arduous conflict. The crime of ingratitude has not yet stained, and I trust never will stain, our national character. You are considered by them, as not only having rendered important services in our own revolution, but as being, on a more extensive scale, the friend of human rights, and a distinguished and able advocate in favour of public liberty. To the welfare of Thomas Paine the Americans are not, nor can they be, indifferent.</P>
<P>Of the sense which the President has always entertained of your merits, and of his friendly disposition towards you, you are too well assured, to require any declaration of it from me. That I forward his wishes in seeking your safety is what I well know; and this will form an additional obligation on me to perform what I should otherwise consider as a duty.</P>
<P>You are in my opinion, at present menaced by no kind of danger. To liberate you, will be an object of my endeavours, and as soon as possible. But you must, until that event shall be accomplished, bear your situation with patience and for∣titude; you will likewise have the justice to recollect, that I am placed here upon a difficult theatre<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I presume alludes to the embarrassments which the sirange conduct of Governor Morris had occasioned, and which. I well know had created suspicions of the sincerity of Mr. Washington.</NOTE>, many important ob∣jects to attend to, and with few to consult. It becomes me in pursuit of those, to regulate my conduct in respect to each, as to the manner and the time, as will in my judgment, be best calculated to accomplish the whole.</P>
<P>With great esteem and respect consider me personally your friend.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>JAMES MONROE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The part in Mr. Monroe's letter, in which he speaks of the President, (Mr Washington) is put in soft language. Mr. Monroe knew what Mr. Washington had said formerly, and he was willing to keep that in view. But the fact is, not only that Mr. Washington had given no orders to Mr. Monroe, as the letter stated; but he did not so much as say to him, inquire if Mr. Paine be dead or alive, in prison or out, or see if there be any assistance we can give him.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13"/>While these matters were passing, the liberations from the prisons were numerous; from twenty to forty in the course of almost every twenty-four hours. The continuance of my imprisonment after a new minister had arrived immediately from America, which was now more than two months, was a matter so obviously strange, that I found the character of the American government spoken of in very unqualified terms of reproach; not only by those who still remained in prison, but by those who were liberated, and by persons who had access to the prison from without. Under these circumstances, I wrote again to Mr. Monroe, and found occasion to say, among other things, <Q>It will not add to the popularity of Mr. Washington, to have it believed in America, as it is be lieved here, that he connives at my imprisonment.</Q></P>
<P>The case, so far as it respected Mr. Monroe, was, that hav∣ing to get over the difficulties, which the strange conduct of Governor Morris had thrown in the way of a successor, and having no authority from the American government, to speak officially upon any thing relating to me, he found himself ob∣liged to proceed by unofficial means with individual members; for though Robespierre was overthrown, the Robespierrian members of the Committee of Public Safety, still remained in considerable force, and had they found out, that Mr. Monroe had no official authority upon the case, they would have paid little or no regard to his reclamation of me. In the mean time my health was suffering exceedingly, the dreary prospect of winter was coming on; and imprisonment was still a thing of danger. After the Robespierrian members of the Com∣mittee were removed, by the expiration of their time of serv∣ing, Mr. Monroe reclaimed me, and I was liberated the 4th of November. Mr. Monroe arrived in Paris the beginning of August before. All that period of my imprisonment, at least, I owe not to Robespierre, but to his colleague in pro∣jects, George Washington. Immediately upon my liberation, Mr. Monroe invited me to his house, where I remained more than a year and half; and I speak of his aid and friendship, as an open-hearted man will always do in such a case, with respect and gratitude.</P>
<P>Soon after my liberation the Convention passed an unani∣mous vote, to invite me to return to my seat among them. The times were still unsettled and dangerous, as well from without as within, for the coalition was unbroken, and the constitution not settled. I chose, however, to accept the in∣vitation; for as I undertake nothing but what I believe to be right, I abandon nothing that I undertake; and I was willing also to show, that, as I was not of a cast of mind, to be de∣terred by prospects or retrospects of danger, so neither were
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>my principles to be weakened by misfortune or perverted by disgust.</P>
<P>Being now once more abroad in the world, I began to find that I was not the only one who had conceived an unfa∣vourable opinion of Mr. Washington; it was evident that his character was on the decline as well among Americans, as among foreigners of different nations. From being the chief of the government, he had made himself the chief of a party; and his integrity was questioned, for his politics had a doubtful appearance. The mission of Mr. Jay to London, notwithstanding there was an American minister there already, had then taken place, and was beginning to be talked of. It appeared to others, as it did to me, to be enveloped in myste∣ry, which every day served either to increase or to explain into matter of suspicion.</P>
<P>In the year 1790, or about that time, Mr. Washington, as president, had sent Governor Morris to London, as his secret agent, to have some communication with the British ministry. To cover the agency of Morris it was given out, I know not by whom, that he went as an agent from Robert Morris, to borrow money in Europe, and the report was per∣mitted to pass uncontradicted. The event of Morris's nego∣ciation was, that Mr. Hammond was sent minister from Eng∣land to America, Pinkney from America to England, and himself minister to France. If, while Morris was minister in France, he was not an emissary of the British ministry and the coalesced powers, he gave strong reason to suspect him of it. No one who saw his conduct, and heard his conversation, could doubt his being in their interest; and had he not got off at the time he did, after his recall, he would have been in arrestation. Some letters of his had fallen into the hands of the Committee of Public Safety, and enquiry was making after him.</P>
<P>A great bustle has been made by Mr. Washington about the conduct of Genet in America, whilst that of his own minister, Morris, in France was infinitely more reproachable. If Genet was imprudent or rash, he was not treacherous; but Morris was all three. He was the enemy of the French re∣volution, in every stage of it. But notwithstanding this con∣duct on the part of Morris, and the known profligacy of his character, Mr. Washington, in a letter he wrote to him at the time of recalling him on the complaint and request of the Committee of Public Safety, assures him, that though he had complied with that request, he still retained the same esteem and friendship for him as before. This letter Morris was foolish enough to tell of; and, as his own character and con∣duct
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>were notorious, the telling of it could have but one effect, which was that of implicating the character of the writer, Morris still loiters in Europe, chiefly in England; and Mr. Washington is still in correspondence with him.—Mr. Wash∣ington ought, therefore, to expect, especially since his conduct in the affair of Jay's treaty, that France must consider Morris and Washington as men of the same description▪ The chief difference, however, between the two is (for in politics there is none) that the one is profligate enough to profess an indifference about moral principles, and the other is prudent enough to conceal the want of them.</P>
<P>About three months after I was at liberty, the official note of Jay to Grenville, on the subject of the capture of Ame∣rican vessels by the British cruisers, appeared in the American papers that arrived at Paris. Every thing was of a piece—every thing was mean. The same kind of character went to all circumstances public or private. Disgusted at this na∣tional degradation, as well as at the particular conduct of Mr. Washington to me, I wrote to him (Mr. Washington) on the twenty-second of February, 1795, under cover to the then secretary of state (Mr. Randolph) and entrusted the letter to Mr. Letombe, who was appointed French consul to Philadel∣phia, and was on the point of taking his departure. When I supposed Mr. Letombe had failed, I mentioned the letter to Mr. Monroe, and as I was then in his house, I showed it to him. He expressed a wish that I would recall it, which he supposed might be done, as he had learned that Mr. Letombe had not then failed. I agreed to do so, and it was returned by Mr. Letombe under cover to Mr. Monroe. The letter will, however, now reach Mr. Washington publicly in the course of this Work.</P>
<P>About the month of September following, I had a severe relapse, which gave occasion to the report of my death. I had felt it coming on a considerable time before, which occa∣sioned me to hasten the work I had then on hand, <HI>The Second Part of the Age of Reason.</HI> When I had finished the work, I bestowed another letter on Mr. Washington, which I sent under cover to Mr. Franklin Bache, of Philadelphia. The let∣ter was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>September <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0, 1795.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD written you a letter by Mr. Letombe, French con∣sul but, at the request of Mr. Monroe, I withdrew it, and
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>the letter is still by me. I was the more easily prevailed upon to do this, as it was then my intention to have returned to America the latter end of the present year (1795); but the illness I now suffer prevents me. In case I had come, I should have applied to you for such parts of your official letters (and your private ones, if you had chosen to give them) as contained any instructions or directions either to Mr. Monroe, or to Mr. Morris, or to any other person, res∣pecting me; for after you were informed to my imprisonment in France, it was incumbent on you to have made some en∣quiry into the cause, as you might very well conclude that I had not the opportunity of informing you of it. I cannot understand your silence upon this subject upon any other ground, than as connivance at my imprisonment; and this is the manner it is understood here, and will be understood in America, unless you will give me authority for contradicting it. I therefore write you this letter, to propose to you to send me copies of any letters you have written, that I may remove this suspicion. In the preface to the Second Part of the <HI>Age of Reason,</HI> I have given a memorandum from the hand-writing of Robespierre, in which he proposed a decree of accusation against me, <HI>"for the interest of America as well as of France."</HI> He could have no cause for putting America in the case, but by interpreting the silence of the American government into connivance and consent. I was imprisoned on the ground of being born in England; and your silence in not enquiring the cause of that imprisonment, and reclaiming me against it, was tacitly giving me up. I ought not to have suspected you of treachery; but whether I recover from the illness I now suffer, or not, I shall continue to think you treacherous, till you give me cause to think otherwise. I am sure you would have found yourself more at your ease, had you acted by me is you ought; for whether your desertion of me was intended to gratify the English government, or to let me fall into de∣struction in France, that you might exclaim the louder against the French revolution; or whether you hoped by my extinc∣tion to meet with less opposition in mounting up the Ameri∣can government; either of these will involve you in reproach you will not easily shake off.</P>

<P>Here follows the letter above alluded to, which had been withdrawn:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
<HEAD>TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>Feb. 22, 1795</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>As it is always painful to reproach those one would wish to respect, it is not without some difficulty that I have taken the resolution to write to you. The danger to which I have been exposed cannot have been unknown to you, and the guarded silence you have observed upon that circumstance is what I ought not to have expected from you, either as a friend or as president of the United States.</P>
<P>You knew enough of my character to be assured, that I could not have deserved imprisonment in France; and, with∣out knowing any thing more than this, you had sufficient ground to have taken some interest for my safety. Every motive arising from recollection ought to have suggested to you the consistency of such a measure. But I cannot find that you have so much as directed any enquiry to be made whether I was in prison or in liberty, dead or alive; what the cause of that imprisonment was, or whether there was any service or assistance you could render. Is this what I ought to have expected from America, after the part I have acted towards her? or will it redound to her honour or to your's that I tell the story? I do not hesitate to say that you have not served America with more fidelity, or greater zeal, or more disinterestedness, than myself, and perhaps not with better effect. After the revolution of America had been established, you rested at home to partake its advantages, and I ventured into new scenes of difficulty to extend the princi∣ples which that revolution had produced. In the progress of events, you beheld yourself a president in America, and me a prisoner in France; you folded your arms, forgot your friend, and became filent.</P>
<P>As every thing I have been doing in Europe was connected with my wishes for the prosperity of America, I ought to be the more surprised at this connuct on the part of her govern∣ment. It leaves me but one mode of explanation, which is, <HI>that every thing is not as it ought to be amongst you,</HI> and that the presence of a man who might disapprove, and who had credit enough with the country to be heard and believed, was not wished for. This was the operating motive with the despotic faction that imprisoned me in France (though the pretence was that I was a foreigner) and those that have been silent and inactive towards me in America, appear to me to have acted from the same motive. It is impossible for me to disco∣ver any other.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18"/>After the part I have taken in the revolution of America, it is natural that I feel interested in whatever relates to her character and prosperity. Though I am not on the spot to see what is immediately acting there, I see some part of what she is acting in Europe. For your own sake, as well as for that of America, I was both surprised and concerned at the appointment of Governor Morris, to be minister to France. His conduct has proved, that the opinion I had formed of that appointment was well founded. I wrote that opinion to Mr. Jefferson at the time, and I was frank enough to say the same thing to Morris, that <HI>it was an unfortunate appointment.</HI> His prating insignificant pomposity rendered him at once offensive, suspected, and ridiculous; and his total neglect of all business had so disgusted the Americans, that they proposed drawing up a protest against him. He carried this neglect to such an extreme, that it was necessary to inform him of it; and I asked him, one day, <HI>if he did not feel himself ashamed to take the money of the country, and do nothing for it?</HI> but Morris is so fond of profit and voluptuousness, that he cares nothing about character. Had he not been removed at the time he was, I think his conduct would have precipitated the two countries into a rupture; and in this case, hated <HI>systematically</HI> as America is, and ever will be, by the British Government, and at the same time suspected by France, the commerce of America would have fallen a prey to both.</P>
<P>If the inconsistent conduct of Morris exposed the interest of America to some hazard in France, the pusillanimous con∣duct of Mr. Jay in England has rendered the American go∣vernment contemptible in Europe. Is it possible that any man, who has contributed to the independence of America, and to free her from the tyranny and injustice of the British govern∣ment, can read without shame and indignation the note of Jay to Grenville? It is a satire upon the declaration of indepen∣dence, and an encouragement to the British government to treat America with contempt. At the time this minister of petitions was acting this miserable part, he had every means in his hands to enable him to have done his business as he ought. The success or failure of his mission depended upon the success or failure of the French arms. Had France failed, Mr. Jay might have put his humble petition in his pocket, and gone home. The case happened to be otherwise, and he has sacrificed the honour, and perhaps the advantage of it, by turning petitioner. I take it for granted, that he was sent over to demand indemnification for the captured property; and, in this case, if he thought he wanted a preamble to his demand, he might have said, <Q>That, though the government
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>of England might suppose itself under the necessity of seiz∣ing American property bound to France, yet that supposed necessity could not preclude indemnification to the proprie∣tors, who, acting under the authority of their own govern∣ment, were not accuntable to any other.</Q> But Mr. Jay sets out with an implied recognition of the right of the British government to seize and condemn; for he enters his complaint against the <HI>irregularity</HI> of the seizures, and the condemnation, as if they were reprehensible only by not being conformable to the terms of the proclamation under which they were seized. Instead of being the envoy of a government, he goes over like a lawyer to demand a new trial. I can hardly help thinking but that Grenvile wrote that note himself and Jay signed it; for the style of it is domestic, and not diplomatic. The term <HI>his Ma∣jesty,</HI> used without any descriptive epithet, always signifies the king whom the minister represents. If this sinking of the demand into a petition was a juggle between Grenville and Jay to cover the indemnification, I think it will end in another juggle, that of never paying the money; and be made use of afterwards to preclude the right of demanding it: for Mr. Jay has virtually disowned the right by appealing to the <HI>magnani∣mity of his Majesty against the capturers.</HI> He has made this magnanimous majesty the umpire in the case, and the govern∣ment of the United States must abide by the decision. If, Sir, I turn some part of this business into ridicule, it is to avoid the unpleasant sensation of serious indignation.</P>
<P>Among other things which I confess I do not understand, is your proclamation of neutrality. This has always appeared to me as an assumption on the part of the executive. But passing this over as a disputable case, and considering it only as political, the consequence has been that of sustaining the losses of war, without the balance of reprisals. When the pro∣fession of neutrality, on the part of America, was answered by hostilities on the part of Britain, the object and intention of that neutrality existed no longer; and to maintain it after this was not only to encourage farther insults and depredations, but was an informal breach of neutrality towards France, by passively contributing to the aid of her enemy. That the government of England considered the American government as pusillanimous, is evident from the increasing insolence of the conduct of the former towards the latter, till the affair of Ge∣neral Wayne. She then saw that it might be possible to kick a government into some degree of spirit. So far as the procla∣mation of neutrality was intended to prevent a dissolute spirit of privateering in America under foreign colours, it was un∣doubtedly laudable; but to continue it as a government neu∣trality,
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>after the commerce of America was made war upon, was submission, and not neutrality.—I have heard so much about this thing called neutrality, that I know not if the unge∣nerous and dishonourable silence (for I must call it such) that has been observed by your part of the government towards me, during my imprisonment, has not in some measure arisen from that policy.</P>
<P>Though I have written you this letter, you ought not to suppose it has been an agreeable undertaking to me. On the contrary, I assure you, it has cost me some disquietude. I am sorry you have given me cause to do it; for, as I have al∣ways remembered your former friendship with pleasure, I suffer a loss by your depriving me of that sentiment.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>THOMAS PAINE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>That this letter was not written in very good temper, is very evident; but it was just such a letter as his conduct ap∣peared to me to merit, and every thing on his part since has served to confirm that opinion. Had I wanted a commentary on his silence, with respect to my imprisonment in France, some of his faction have furnished me with it. What I here allude to, is a publication in a Philadelphia paper, copied af∣terwards into a New-York paper, both under the patronage of the Washington faction, in which the writer, still supposing me in prison in France, wonders at my lengthy respite from the scaffold. And he marks his politics still farther, by saying, <Q>It appears, moreover, that the people of England did not relish his (Thomas Paine's) opinions quite so well as he ex∣pected; and that for one of his last pieces, as destructive to the peace and happiness of their country (meaning, I sup∣pose, the <HI>Rights of Man</HI>) they threatened our knight-errant with such serious vengeance, that, to avoid a trip to Botany Bay, he fled over to France, as a less dangerous voyage.</Q></P>
<P>I am not refuting or contradicting the falsehood of this publication, for it is sufficiently notorious; neither am I cen∣suring the writer: on the contrary, I thank him for the expla∣nation he has incautiously given of the principles of the Wash∣ington faction. Insignificant, however, as the piece is, it was capable of having some ill effects, had it arrived in France during my imprisonment, and in the time of Robespierre; and I am not uncharitable in supposing that this was one of the intentions of the writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know not who the writer of the piece is, but some late Americans say it is Phineas Bond, an American refugee, and now a British consul; and that he writes under the signa∣ture of Peter Skunk, or Peter Porcupine, or some such sig∣nature.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21"/>I have now done with Mr. Washington on the score of private affairs. It would have been far more agreeable to me, had his conduct been such as not to have merited these re∣proaches. Errors, or caprices of the temper, can be pardoned and forgotten; but a cold eliberate crime of the heart, men as Mr. Washington is capable of acting, is not to be washed away — I now proceed to other matter:</P>
<P>After Jay's note to Grenville arrived in Paris from America, the character of every thing that was to follow might be easily foreseen; and it was upon this anticipation that my letter of February the twenty-second was founded. The event has proved that I was not mistaken, except that it has been much worse than I expected.</P>
<P>It would naturally occur to Mr. Washington, that the se∣cresy of Jay's mission to England, where there was already an American minister, could not but create some suspicion in the French government, especially as the conduct of Morris had been notorious, and the intimacy of Mr. Washington with Morris was known.</P>
<P>The character which Mr. Washington has attempted to act in the world, is a sort of non-deseribable cameleon coloured thing, called Prudence. It is, in many cases, a substitute for Principle, and is so nearly allied to Hypocrisy, that it easily slides into it. His genius for prudence furnished him, in this instance, with an expedient that served (as is the natural and general character of all expedients) to diminish the embarrass∣ment of the moment, and multiply them afterwards; for he caused it to be announced to the French government as a con∣fidential matter (Mr. Washington should recollect that I was a member of the Convention, and had the means of knowing what I here state) — he caused it, I say, to be announced, and that for the purpose of preventing any uneasiness to France, on the score of Mr. Jay's mission to England, that the object of that mission, and Mr. Jay's authority, were restricted to the demanding of the surrender of the western posts, and in∣demrification for the cargoes captured in American vessels. — Mr. Washington knows that this was untrue; and knowing this, he had good reason, to himself, for refusing to furnish the House of Representatives with copies of the instructions given to Jay, as he might suspect, among other things, that he should also be called upon for copies of instructions given to other ministers, and that in the contradiction of instructions his want of integrity would be detected. Mr. Washington may now perhaps learn, when it is too late to be of any use to him, that a man will pass better through the world with a thousand open errors upon his back, than in being detected
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>in <HI>one</HI> sly falsehood. When one is detected, a thousand are suspected.</P>
<P>The first account that arrived in Paris of a treaty being ne∣gotiated by Mr. Jay (for nobody suspected any) came in an English newspaper, which announced that a treaty, <HI>offensive</HI> and <HI>defensive,</HI> had been concluded between the United States of America and England. This was immediately denied by every American in Paris, as an impossible thing; and though it was disbelieved by the French, it imprinted a suspicion that some underhand business was going forward. At length the treaty itself arrived, and every well-affected American blushed with shame.</P>
<P>It is curious to observe how the appearances of characters will change, whilst the root that produces them remains the same. The Washington faction having waded through the slough of negociation, and, whilst it amused France with pro∣fessions of friendship contrived to in ure her, immediately throws off the hypocrite and assumes the swaggering air of a bravado. The party papers of that imbecile administration were on this occasion filled with paragraphs about sove∣reignty. A poltroon may boast of his sovereign right to let another kick him, and this is the only kind of sovereignty shown in the treaty with England. But those dashing para∣graphs, as Timothy Pickering well knows, were intended for France, without whose assistance, in men, money, and ships, Mr. Washington would have cut but a poor figure in the American war. But of his military talents I shall speak here∣after.</P>
<P>I mean not to enter into any discussion of any article of Jay's treaty; I shall speak only upon the whole of it. It is attempted to be justified on the ground of its not being a violation of any article or articles of the treaty pre-existing with France. But the sovereign right of explanation does not lie with George Washington and his man Timothy; France, on her part, has, at least, an equal right: and when nations dispute, it is not so much about words as about things.</P>
<P>A man, such as the world calls a sharper, as versed as Jay must be supposed to be in the quibbles of the law, may find a way to enter into engagements, and make bargains, in such a mahner as to cheat some other party, without that party being able, as the phrase is, <HI>to take th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> law of him.</HI> This often happens in the cabalistical circle of what is called law. But when this is attempted to be acted on the national scale of treaties, it is too despicable to be defended, or to be permitted to exist. Yet this is the trick upon which Jay's treaty is
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>founded, so far as it has relation to the treaty pre-existing with France. It is a counter-treaty to that treaty, and per∣verts all the great articles of that treaty to the injury of France, and makes them operate as a bounty to England, with whom France is at war. The Washington administra∣tion shows great desire that the treaty between France and the United States be preserved. Nobody can doubt its sincerity upon this matter. There is not a British minister, a British merchant, or a British agent or factor, in America, that does not anxiously wish the same thing. The treaty with France serves now as a passport to supply England with naval stores, and other articles of American produce; whilst the same articles when coming to France are made contraband, or seiz∣able, by Jay's treaty with England. The treaty with France says, that neutral ships make neutral property, and thereby gives protection to English property on board American ships; and Jay's treaty delivers up French property on board Ame∣rican ships to be seized by the English. It is too paltry to talk of faith, of national honour, and of the preservation of treaties, whilst such a bare-faced treachery as this stares the world in the face.</P>
<P>The Washington administration may save itself the trouble of proving to the French government its <HI>most faithful</HI> inten∣tions of preserving the treaty with France; for France has now no desire that it should be preserved; she had nominated an envoy extraordinary to America, to make Mr. Washington <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd his government a present of the treaty, and to have no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore to do with <HI>that</HI> or with <HI>him.</HI> It was at the same time officially declared to the American minister at Paris, <HI>that the French republic had rather have the American government for an open enemy than a treacherous friend.</HI> This, sir, together with the internal distractions caused in America, and the loss of character in the world, is the <HI>eventful crisis</HI> alluded to in the beginning of this Letter, to which your double politics have brought the affairs of your country. It is time that the eyes of America be opened upon you.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow France would have conducted herself towards Ame∣rica, and American commerce, after all treaty stipulations had ceased, and under the sense of services rendered, and injuries received, I know not. It is, however, an unpleasant reflec∣tion, that in all national quarrels, the innocent, and even the friendly part of the community, become involved with the culpable and the unfriendly; and as the accounts that arrived from America continued to manifest an invariable attachment, in the general mass of the people, to their original ally, in opposition to the new-fangled Washington faction, the reso∣lutions
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>that had been taken in France were suspended. It happened also, fortunately enough, that Governor Morris was not minister at this time.</P>
<P>There is, however, one point that yet remains in embryo, and which, among other things, serves to show the ignorance of the Washington treaty makers, and their inattention to pre-existing treaties, when they were employing themselves in framing or ratifying the new treaty with England.</P>
<P>The second article of the treaty of commerce between the United States and France says, <Q>The Most Christian King and the United States engage mutually not to grant any particular favour to other nations, in respect to commerce and navigation, that shall not immediately become common to the other party, who shall enjoy the same favour freely, if the concession was freely made, or on allowing the same compensation if the concession was conditional.</Q></P>
<P>All the concessions therefore made to England by Jay's treaty are, through the medium of this second article in the pre-existing treaty, made to France, and become engrafted into the treaty with France, and can be exercised by her as a mat∣ter of right, the same as by England.</P>
<P>Jay's treaty makes a concession to England, and that un∣conditionally, of seizing naval stores in American ships, and condemning them as contraband. It makes also a concession to England to seize provisions and <HI>other articles</HI> in American ships. <HI>Other articles,</HI> are <HI>all other articles;</HI> and none but an ignoramus, or something worse, would have put such a phrase into a treaty. The condition annexed to this case is, that the provisions and other articles so seized, are to be paid for at a price to be agreed upon. Mr. Washington, as president ra∣tified this treaty after he knew the British government had recommenced an indiscriminate seizure of provisions, and of all other articles in American ships: and it is now known that those seizures were made to fit out the expedition going to Quiberon Bay, and it was known beforehand that they would be made. The evidence goes also a good way to prove that Jay and Grenville understood each other upon that subject. Mr. Pinkney, when he passed through France in his way to Spain, spoke of the recommencement of the seizures as a thing that would take place. The French government had by some means received information from London to the same purpose, with the addition, that the recommencement of the seizures would cause no misunderstanding between the British and American governments. Grenville, in defending himself against the opposition in parliament, on account of the scarcity of corn, said (see his speech at the opening of the
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>parliament that met October 29, 1795) that <HI>the supplies for the Quiberon expedition were furnished out of the American ships,</HI> and all the accounts received at that time from England stated that those seizures were made under the treaty. After the supplies for the Quiberon expedition had been procured, and the expected success had failed, the seizures were counter∣manded; and had the French seized provision vessels going to England, it is probable that the Quiberon expedition could not have been attempted.</P>
<P>In one point of view, the treaty with England operates as a loan to the English government. It gives permission to that government to take American property at sea, to any amount, and pay for it when it suits her; and, besides this, the treaty is in every point of view a surrender of the rights of American commerce and navigation, and a refusal to France of the rights of neutrality. The American flag is not now a neutral flag to France; Jay's treaty of surrender give a monopoly of it to England.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the treaty of commerce between America and France was formed on the most liberal principles, and cal∣culated to give the greatest encouragement to the infant com∣merce of America. France was neither a carrier nor an ex∣porter of naval stores, or of provisions; those articles belonged wholly to America; and they had all the protection in that treaty which a treaty can give. But so much has that treaty been perverted, that the liberality of it on the part of France has served to encourage Jay to form a counter-treaty with England; for he must have supposed the hands of France tied up by her treaty with America, when he was making such large concessions in favour of England. The injury which Mr. Washington's administration has done to the character, as well as to the commerce of America, is too great to be re∣paired by him. Foreign nations will be shy of making treaties with a government that has given the faithless exam∣ple of perverting the liberality of a former treaty to the in∣jury of the party with whom it was made.</P>
<P>In what a fraudulent light must Mr. Washington's character appear in the world, when his declarations and his conduct are compared together! Here follows the letter he wrote to the Committee of Public Safety, whilst Jay was negociating in profound secresy this treacherous treaty:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>George Washington, President of the United States of America, to the representatives of the French peo∣ple, members of the Committee of Public Safety <HI>of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> French republic, the great and good friend and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly of the United State.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Was it by entering into a treaty with England to surrender French property on board American ships, to be seized by the English, whilst English property on board American ships was declared by the French treaty not to be seizable, <HI>that the bonds of friendship between America, and France were to be drawn closer?</HI> Was it by declaring naval stores contraband when coming to France, whilst by the French treaty they were not contraband when going to England, that the <HI>connection between France and America was to be advanced?</HI> Was it by opening the American ports to the British navy in the present war, from which ports that same navy had been expelled by the aid solicited from France in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>merican war (and that aid gra∣tuitously given), that the gratitude of America was to be shewn, and the solicitude spoken of in the letter demonstrated?</P>
<P>As the letter was addressed to the Committee of Public Safety, Mr. Washington did not expect it would get abroad in the world, or be seen by any other eye than that of Robes∣pierre, or be heard by any other ear than that of the Com∣mittee; that it would pass as a whisper across the Atlant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c from one dark chamber to the other, and there terminate.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>It was calculated to remove from the mind of the Com¦mittee all suspicion upon Jay's mission to England, and in this point of view it was suited to the circumstances of the moment then passing; but as the event of that mission has proved the letter to be hypocritical, it serves no other pur∣pose of the present moment than to shew that the writer is not to be credited. Two circumstances served to make the reading of the letter necessary in the Convention; the one was, that they who succeeded on the fall of Robespierre, found it most proper to act with publicity; the other, to extinguish the suspicions which the strange conduct of Morris had occa∣sioned in France.</P>
<P>When the British treaty and the ratification of it by Mr. Washington were known in France, all further declarations from him of his good disposition, as an ally and a friend, passed for so many cyphers; but still it appeared necessary to him to keep up the farce of declarations. It is stipulated in the British treaty, that commissioners are to report, at the end of two years, on the case of <HI>neutral ships making neutral property.</HI> In the mean time neutral ships do <HI>not</HI> make neutral property according to the British treaty, and they <HI>do</HI> according to the French treaty. The preservation therefore of the French treaty became of great importance to England, as by that means she can employ American ships as carriers, whilst the same advantage is denied to France. Whether the French treaty could exist as a matter of right after this clandestine perversion of it, could not but give some apprehensions to the partizans of the British treaty, and it became necessary to them to make up by fine words what was wanting in good actions.</P>
<P>An opportunity offered to that purpose. The Convention, on the public reception of Mr. Monroe, ordered the Ameri∣can flag and the French flag to be displayed unitedly in the hall of the Convention. Mr. Monroe made a present of an American flag for the purpose. The Convention returned this compliment, by sending a French flag to America, to be presented by their minister, Mr. Adet, to the American go∣vernment. This resolution passed long before Jay's treaty was known or suspected: it passed in the days of confidence;—but the flag was not presented by Mr Adet till several months after the treaty had been ratified. Mr. Washington made this the occasion of saying some fine things to the French minister; and the better to get himself into tune to do this, he began by saying the finest things of himself.</P>
<P><Q>Born, Sir,</Q> said he, <Q>in a land of liberty; <HI>having</HI> learned its value; <HI>having</HI> engaged in a perilous conflict to
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>defend it; <HI>having,</HI> in a word, devoted the best years of my life to secure its permanent establishment in my own country; <HI>my</HI> anxious recollections, <HI>my</HI> sympathetic feelings, and <HI>my</HI> best wishes, are irresistibly excited, whenever, in any country, I see an oppressed people unfurl the banner of freedom.</Q>—Mr. Washington, having expended so many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine phrases upon himself, was obliged to invent a new one for the French, and he calls them "Wonderful people!"—The coalesced powers acknowledge as much.</P>
<P>It is laughable to hear Mr. Washington talk of his <HI>sympa∣thetic feelings,</HI> who has always been remarked, even among his friends, for not having any. He has, however, given no proof of any to me. As to the pompous encomiums he so liberally pays to himself on the score of the American revola∣tion, the propriety of them may be questioned; and, since he has forced them so much into notice, it is fair to examine his pretensions.</P>
<P>A stranger might be led to suppose, from the egotism with which Mr. Washington speaks, that himself, and himself only, had generated, condu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted, completed, and established, the revolution. In fine, that it was all his own doing.</P>
<P>In the first place, as to the political part, he had no share in it; and therefore the whole of <HI>that</HI> is out of the question with respect to him. There remains, then, only the military part; and it would have been prudent in Mr. Washington not to have awakened inquiry upon that subject. Fame then was cheap; he enjoyed it cheaply; and nobody was disposed to take away the laurels that, whether they were <HI>acquired</HI> or not, had been given.</P>
<P>Mr. Washington's merit consisted in constancy. But con∣stancy was the common virtue of the revolution. Who was there that was inconstant? I know but of one military defec∣tion, that of Arnold; and I know of no political defection, among those who made themselves eminent when the revolu∣tion was formed by the declaration of independence. Even Silas Deane, though he attempted to defraud, did not betray.</P>
<P>But when we speak of military character, something more is to be understood than constancy; and something more <HI>ought</HI> to be understood than the Fabian system of <HI>doing nothing.</HI> The <HI>nothing</HI> part can be done by any body, Old Mrs. Thompson, the housekeeper of head-quarters (who threatened to make the sun and the <HI>wind</HI> shine through Rivington of New-York) could have been as good as Barak.</P>
<P>Mr. Washington had the nominal rank of commander in chief, but he was not so in fact. He had, in reality, only a
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>separate command. He had no control over, or direction of, the army to the northward under Gates, that captured Bur∣goyne; or of that to the south under Greene, that recovered the southern states<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Winterbotham's valuable History of America, lately published.</NOTE>.—The nominal rank, however, of com∣mander in chief, served to throw upon him the lustre of those actions, and to make him appear as the soul and centre of all military operations in America.</P>
<P>He commenced his command June 1775, during the time the Massacauset army lay before Boston, and after the affair o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bunker's Hill. The commencement of his command was the commencement of inactivity. Nothing was afterwards done, or attempted to be done, during the nine months he remained before Boston. If we may judge from the resistance made at Concord, and afterwards at Bunker's Hill, there was a spirit of enterprise at that time, which the presence of Mr. Wash∣ington chilled into cold defence. By the advantage of a good exterior he attracts respect, which his habitual silence tends to preserve; but he has not the talent of inspiring ardour in an army. The enemy removed from Boston to Halifax in March 1776, to wait for reinforcements from Europe, and to take a more advantageous position at New-York.</P>
<P>The inactivity of the campaign of 1775, on the part of General Washington, when the enemy had a less force than in any other future period of the war, and the injudicious choice of positions taken by him in the campaign of 1776, when the enemy had its greatest force, necessarily produced the losses and misfortunes that marked that gloomy campaign. The positions taken were either islands, or necks of land. In the former, the enemy, by the aid of their ships, could bring their whole force against a part of General Washing∣ton's, as in the affair of Long Island; and in the latter, he might be shut up as in the bottom of a bag. This had nearly been the case at New-York, and it was so in part: it was actually the case at Fort Washington; and it would have been the case at Fort Lee, if General Greene had not moved preci∣pitately off, leaving every thing behind, and, by gaining Hackinsuch-bridge, got out of the bag of Bergin-neck.—How far Mr. Washington, as general, is blamable for those matters, I am not undertaking to determine; but they are evidently defects in military geography. The successful skir∣mishes at the close of that campaign (matters that would scarcely be noticed in a better state of things) make the bril∣liant exploits of General Washington's seven campaigns.—
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>No wonder we see so much pusillanimity in the <HI>president,</HI> when we see so little enterprise in the <HI>general!</HI></P>
<P>The campaign of 1777 be ame famous, not by any thing on the part of General Washington, but by the capture of General Burgoyne and the army under his command, by the northern army at Saratoga, under General Gates. So totally distinct and unconnected were the two armies of Washington and Gates, and so independent was the latter of the authority of the nominal commander in chief, that the two generals did not so much as correspond, and it was only by a letter of General (since Governor) Clinton, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> General Washington was informed of that event. The B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>sh took possession of Philadelphia this year, which they eva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ated the next, just time enough to save their heavy baggage and sleet of trans∣ports from capture by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ench admiral D'Estaign, who arrived at the mouth of the Delaware soon after.</P>
<P>The capture of Burgoyne gave an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lat in Europe to the American arms, and facilitated the alliance with France. The eclat, however, was not kept up by any thing on the part of General Washington. The same unfortunate languor that marked his entrance into the fiel, continued always. Dis∣content began to prevail strongly against him, and a party was formed in Congress, whilst sitting at York Town in Pen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lvania, for removing him from the command of the army. The hope however of better times, the news of the alliance with France, and the unwillingness of showing discontent, dissipated the matter.</P>
<P>Nothing was done in the campaign of 1778, 1779, 1780, in the part where genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Washington commanded, except the taking Stony-Point by general Wayne. The southern states in the mean time were overrun by the enemy. They were afterwards recovered by general Greene, who had in a very great measure created the army that accomplished that recovery. In all this general Washington had no share. The Fabian system of war, followed by him, began now to un∣told itself with all its evils; for what is Fabian war without Fabian means to support it? The finances of Congress, de∣pending wholly on emissions of paper-money, were exhausted. Its credit was gone. The continental treasury was not able to pay the expence of a brigade of waggons to transport the necessary stores to the army, and yet the sole object, the esta∣blishment of the revolution, was a thing of remote distance. The time I am now speaking of is in the latter end of the year 1780.</P>
<P>In this situation of things it was found not only ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>i∣ent, but absolutely necessary, for Congress to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the whole
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>case to its ally. I know more of this matter (before it came into Congress, or was known to general Washington), of its progress, and its issue, than I choose to state in this letter. Colonel John Laurens was sent to France, as an envoy ex∣traordinary on this occasion, and by a private agreement between him and me, I accompanied him. We sailed from Boston in the Alliance frigate, February eleventh, 1781. France had already done much in accepting and paying bills drawn by Congress; she was now called upon to do more. The event of colonel Laurens's mission, with the aid of the venerable minister Franklin, was, that France gave in money, as a present, six millions of livres, and ten millions more as a loan, and agreed to send a fleet of not less than thirty sail of the line, at her own expense, as an aid to America. Co∣lonel Laurens and myself returned from Brest the first of June following, taking with us two millions and a half of livres (upwards of one hundred thousand pounds sterling) of the money given, and convoying two ships with stores.</P>
<P>We arrived at Boston the twenty-fifth of August follow∣ing. De Grasse arrived with the French fleet in the Chesa∣peak at the same time, and was afterwards joined by that of Barras, making thirty-one sail of the line. The money was transported in waggons from Boston to the bank of Phila∣delphia, of which Mr. Thomas Willing, who has since put himself at the head of the list of petitioners in favour of the British treaty, was then president. And it was by the aid of this money, of this fleet, and of Rochambeau's army, that Cornwailis was taken; the laurels of which has been unjustly given to Mr. Washington. His merit in that affair was no more than that of any other American officer.</P>
<P>I have had, and still have, as much pride in the American revolution as any man, or as Mr. Washington has a right to have; but that pride has never made me forgetful whence the great aid came that completed the business. Foreign aid (that of France) was calculated upon at the commencement of the revolution. It is one of the subjects treated of in the pamph∣let <HI>Common Sense,</HI> but as a matter that could not be hoped for, unless independence was declared. The aid however was greater than could have been expected.</P>
<P>It is as well the ingratitude as the pusillanimity of Mr. Washington, and the Washington faction, that has brought upon America the loss of character she now suffers in the world, and the numerous evils her commerce has undergone, and to which it is still exposed. The British ministry soon found out what sort of men they had to deal with, and they dealt with them accordingly; and if further explanation was
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>wanting, it has been fully given since, in the snivelling ad∣dress of the New York chamber of commerce to the presi∣dent, and in that of sundry merchants of Philadelphia, which was not much better.</P>
<P>When the revolution of America was finally established by the termination of the war, the world gave her credit for great character; and she had nothing to do but to stand firm upon that ground. The British ministry had their hands too full of trouble to have provoked a rupture with her, had she shown a proper resolution to defend her rights: but encouraged as they were, by the submissive character of the American admi∣nistration, they proceeded from insult to insult, till none more were left to be offered. The proposals made by Sweden and Denmark to the American government were disregarded. I know not if so much as an answer has been returned to them. The minister <HI>penitentiary,</HI> (as some of the British prints called him) Mr. Jay, was sent on a pilgrimage to London, to make all up by penance and petition. In the mean time, the lengthy and drowsy writer of the pieces signed <HI>Camillus</HI> held himself in reserve to vindicate <HI>every thing;</HI> and to found in America the tocsin of terror upon the <HI>inexhaustible</HI> resources of England. Her resources, says he, are greater than those of all the other powers. This man is so intoxicated with fear and finance, that he knows not the difference between <HI>plus</HI> and <HI>minus</HI>— between a hundred pounds in hand, and a hundred pounds worse than nothing.</P>
<P>The commerce of America, so far as it had been established, by all the treaties that had been formed prior to that by Jay, was free, and the principles upon which it was established were good. That ground ought never to have been departed from. It was the justifiable ground of right; and no tem∣porary difficulties ought to have induced an abandonment of it. The case is now otherwise. The ground, the scene, the pretensions, the every thing is changed. The commerce of America is by Jay's treaty put under foreign dominion. The sea is not free for her. Her right to navigate it is reduced to the right of escaping; that is, until some ship of England or France stops her vessels, and carries them into port. Every ar∣ticle of American produce, whether from the sea or the land, fish, flesh, vegetable, or manufacture, is by Jay's treaty made either contraband, or seizable. Nothing is exempt. In all other treaties of commerce the article which enumerates the contra∣band articles, such as fire-arms, gunpowder, &amp;c. is followed by another which enumerates the articles not contraband; but it is not so in Jay's treaty. There is no exempting article. Its place is supplied by the article for seizing and carrying into port; and
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>the sweeping phrase of provisions and <HI>other articles</HI> includes every thing. There never was such a base and servile treaty of surrender, since treaties began to exist.</P>
<P>This is the ground upon which America now stands. All her rights of commerce and navigation are to be begin anew, and that with loss of character to begin with.—If there is sense enough left in the heart, to call a blush into the cheek, the Washington administration must be ashamed to appear.—And as to you, sir, treacherous in private friendship (for so you have been to me, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the day of danger) and a hypocrite in public life, to world will be puzzled to decide, whether you are an APOSTATE, or an IMPOSTOR? Whether you have abandoned good principles, or whether you ever had any?</P>

<HEAD>MEMORIAL OF THOMAS PAINE TO MR. MONROE, <HI>Alluded to in the foregoing Letter.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Luxembourg, <DATE>September: 10, 1794.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I ADDRESS this memorial to you, in consequence of a letter I received from a friend 18th Fructidor, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pt. 14th) in which he says;— <Q>Mr. Monroe has told me, that he has no orders (meaning from the Congress) repecting you; but I am sure he will leave nothing undone to liberate you. But, from what I learn from all the late Americans, you are not con∣sidered either by the government, or by the individuals as an American citizen. You have been made a French citi∣zen, which you have accepted, and you have further made yourself a servant of the French republic; and therefore it would be out of character for an American minister to in∣terfere in their internal concerns.—You must therefore
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>either be liberated out of compliance to America, or stand your trial, which you have a right to demand.</Q></P>
<P>This information was so unexpected by me, that I am at a loss how to answer it. I know not on what principle it ori∣ginates;—whether from an idea, that I had voluntarily aban∣doned my citizenship of America, for that of France, or from any article of the American constitution applied to me.—The first is untrue with respect to any intention on my part; and the second is without foundation, as I shall show in the course of this memorial.</P>
<P>The idea of conferring honour of citizenship upon fo∣reigners, who had distinguished themselves in propagating the principles of liberty and humanity, in opposition to despotism, war, and bloodshed, was first proposed by me to La Fayette, at the commencement of the French revolution, when his heart appeared to be warmed with those principles. My mo∣tive in making this proposal was to render the people of dif∣ferent nations more fraternal than they had been, or then were. I observed that almost every branch of science had possessed itself of the exercise of this right, so far as it regarded its in∣stitution. Most of the academies and societies in Europe, and also these of America, conferred the rank of honorary mem∣ber, upon foreigners eminent in knowledge, and made them, in fact, citizens of their literary or scientific republic; with∣out affecting or anywise diminishing, their rights of citizen∣ship in their own country, or in other societies: and why the science of government should not have the same advantage, or why the people in one nation, should not by their represen∣tatives, exercise the right of conferring the honour of citizen∣ship, upon individuals eminent in another nation; without a affecting <HI>their</HI> rights of citizenship, is a problem yet to be solved.</P>
<P>I now proceed to remark on that part of the letter, in which the writer says—that, <Q><HI>from all he can learn from the late Ame∣ricans, I am not considered in America, either by the government or by the individuals, as an American citizen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In the first place I wish to ask, what is here meant by the government of America? The members who compose the government, are only individuals when in conversation, and who most probably, hold very different opinions upon the sub∣ject.—Have Congress as a body made any declaration respect∣ing me, that they now no longer consider me as a citizen? If they have not, any thing they otherwise say, is no more than the opinion of individuals, and consequently is not legal authority, or anywise sufficient authority to deprive any man of his citizenship. Besides, whether a man has forfeited his
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>rights of citizenship, is a question not determinable by Con∣gress, but by a court of judicature, and a jury; and must de∣pend upon evidence, and the application of some law or ar∣ticle or the constitution to the case. No such proceeding has yet been had, and consequently I remain a citizen until it be had, be that decision what it may; for there can be no such thing as a suspension of rights in the interim.</P>
<P>I am very well aware, and always was, of the article of the constitution which says, as nearly as I can recollect the word, that <Q>any citizen of the United states, who shall accept any title, place, or office, from any foreign king, prince, or state, shall forfeit and lose, his right or citizenship of the United States.</Q></P>
<P>Had the article said, that <HI>any citizen of the United states, who shad be member of any foreign convention, for the purpose of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a free con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ation, shall forfeit and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the United States,</HI> the article had been directly applicable to me; but the idea of such an article never could have entered the mind of the American Convention, and the present article is altogether foreign to the case with respect to me. It supposes a government in active exis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence, and not a government dis∣solved; and it supposes a citizen of America, accepting titles and offices under that government, and not a citizen of Ame∣rica who gives his assistance in a convention chosen by the people, for the purpose of forming a government <HI>de now,</HI> founded on their authority.</P>
<P>The late constitution and government of France was dis∣solved the tenth of August 1792. The national legislative assembly then in being, supposed itself without sufficient au∣thority to continue its sittings, and it proposed to the depart∣ments to elect, not another legislative assembly, but a conven∣tion for the express purpose of forming a new constitution. When the assembly were discoursing on this matter, some of the members said, that they wished to gain all the assistance possible upon the subject of free constitutions; and expressed a wish to elect and invite foreigner, of any nation to the con∣vention, who had distinguished themselves in-defending, ex∣plaining, and propagating, the principles of liberty. It was on this occasion that my name was mentioned in the assembly. After this, a deputation from a body of the French people, in order to remove any objection that might be made against my assisting at the proposed convention, requested the assembly, as their representatives, to give me the title of French Citizen; after which, I was elected a member of the French Conven∣tion, in four different departments, as is already known.</P>
<P>The case therefore is, that I accepted nothing from any
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>king, prince, or state; or from any government: for France was without any government, except what arose from com∣mon consent, and the necessity of the case. Neither did <HI>"I make myself a servant of the French Republic,"</HI> as the letter alluded to expresses; for at that time France was no republic, not even in name. She was altogether a people in a state of revolution.</P>
<P>It was not until the Convention met that France was de∣clared a republic, and monarchy abolished; soon after which a committee was elected, of which I was a member, to form a constitution, which was presented to the Convention, the fifteenth and sixteenth of February following, but was not to be taken into consideration till after the expiration of two months, and if approved by the Convention, was then to be referred to the people for their acceptance, with such additions or amendments as the convention should make.</P>
<P>In thus employing myself upon the formation of a consti∣tution, I certainly did nothing inconsistent with the Ameri∣can constitution. I took no oath of allegiance to France, or any other oath whatever. I considered the citizenship they had presented me, as an honorary mark of respect paid to me not only as a friend to liberty, but as an American citizen. My acceptance of that, or the deputyship, not conferred on me by any king, prince, or state, but by a people in state of revolution, and contending for liberty, required no transfer of my allegiance or of my citizenship, from America to France. There I was a real citizen, paying taxes; here I was a volun∣tary friend, employing myself on a temporary service. Every American in Paris knew, that it was my constant intention to return to America, as soon as a constitution should be establish∣ed, and that I anxiously waited for that event.</P>
<P>I ever must deny, that the article of the American consti∣tution already mentioned, can be applied either verbally, in∣tentionally, or constructively, to me. It undoubtedly was the intention of the Convention that framed it, to preserve the parity of the American republic, from being debased by fo∣reign and foppish customs; but it never could be its intention to act against the principles of liberty, by forbidding its citi∣zens to assist in promoting those principles in foreign countries; neither could it be its intention to act against the principles of gratitude. France had aided America in the establishment of her revolution, when invaded and oppressed by England and her auxiliaries. France in her turn was invaded and oppressed by a combination of foreign despots. In this situation I con∣ceived it an act of gratitude in me, as a citizen of America, to render her in return the best services I could perform. I came to France (for I was in England when I received the
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>invitation) not to enjoy ease, emoluments, and foppish ho∣nours, as the article supposes; but to encounter difficulties and dangers in defence of liberty; and I much question whe∣ther those who now malignantly seek (for some I believe do) to turn this to my injury, would have had courage to have done the same. I am sure Governor Morris would not. He told me the second day after my arrival (in Paris), that the Austrians and Prussians, who were then at Verdun, would be in Paris in a fortnight. I have no idea, said he, that seventy thousand disciplined troops can be stopt in their march by any power in France.</P>
<P>Besides the reasons I have already given for accepting the invitation to the Convention, I had another that has reference particularly to America, which I mentioned to Mr. Pinckney the night before I left London to come to Paris: <Q>That it was to the interest of America that the system of European governments should be changed, and placed on the same principle with her own.</Q></P>
<P>It is certain that governments upon similar systems agree better together, than those that are founded on principles dis∣cordant with each other; and the same rule holds good with respect to the people living under them. In the latter case they offend each other by pity, or by reproach; and the dis∣cordancy carries itself to matters of commerce. I am not an ambitious man, but perhaps I have been an ambitious Ameri∣can. I have wished to see America the <HI>Mother Church</HI> of go∣vernment.</P>
<P>I have now stated sufficient matter to show that the article in question is not applicable to me; and that any such appli∣cation to my injury, as well in circumstances as in rights, is contrary both to the letter and intention of that article, and is illegal and unconstitutional. Neither do I believe that any jury in America, when they are informed of the whole of the case, would give a verdict to deprive me of my rights upon that article. The citizens of America, I believe, are not very fond of permitting forced and indirect explanations to be put upon matters of this kind. I know not what were the merits of the case with respect to the person who was prosecuted for acting as prize-master to a French privateer, but I know that the jury gave a verdict against the prosecution. The rights I have acquired are dear to me. They have been acquired by honourable means, and by dangerous service in the worst of times, and I cannot passively permit them to be wrested from me. I conceive it my duty to defend them, as the case in∣volves a constitutional and public question, which is, how far the power of the federal government extends, in depriving any citizen of his rights of citizenship, or of suspending them.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38"/>That the explanation of national treaties belongs to Con∣gress, is strictly constitutional; but not the explanation of the constitution itself, any more than the explanation of law in the case of individual citizens. These are altogether judiciary questions. It is however worth observing, that Congress, in explaining the article of the treaty with respect to French prizes and French privateers, confined itself strictly to the let∣ter of the article. Let them explain the article of the consti∣tution with respect to me in the same manner, and the deci∣sion, did it appertain to them, could not deprive me of my rights of citizenship, or suspend them, for I have accepted nothing from any king, prince, state, or government.</P>
<P>You will please to observe, that I speak as if the federal government had made some declaration upon the subject of my citizenship; whereas the fact is otherwise; and your say∣ing that you have no orders respecting me, is a proof of it. They, therefore, who propagate the report of my not being considered as a citizen of America by government, do it to the prolongation of my imprisonment, and without authority; for Congress, <HI>as a government,</HI> has neither decided upon it, nor yet taken the matter into consideration; and I request you to caution such persons against spreading such reports.—But be these matters as they may, I cannot have a doubt that you find and feel the case very different, since you have heard what I have to say, and known what my situation is, than you did before your arrival.</P>
<P>Painful as the want of liberty may be, it is a consolation to me to believe, that my imprisonment proves to the world, that I had no share in the murderous system that then reigned. That I was an enemy to it, both morally and politically, is known, to all who had any knowledge of me; and could I have written French as well as I can English, I would pub∣lickly have exposed its wickedness, and shown the ruin with which it was pregnant.—They who have esteemed me on former occasions, whether in America, or in Europe, will, I know, feel no cause to abate that esteem, when they reflect, that <HI>imprisonment with preservation of character, is preferable to liberty with disgrace.</HI></P>
<P>The letter before quoted in the first page of this memorial, says, <Q>it would be out of character for an American minister to interfere in the internal affairs of France.</Q>—This goes on the idea that I am a citizen of France, and a member of the Convention; which is not the fact. The convention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> declared me to be a foreigner; and consequently the citizenship and the election are null and void. It also has the appearance of a decision, that the article of the constitution
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>respecting grants made to American citizens by foreign kings, princes, or states, is applicable to me; which is the very point in question, and against the application of which I con∣tend. I state evidence to the minister to show, that I am not within the letter or meaning of that article, that it cannot operate against me; and I apply to him for the protection that, I conceive, I have a right to ask, and to receive. The internal affairs of France are out of the question with respect to my application, or his interference. I ask it aot as a citi∣zen of France, for I am not one; I ask it not as a member of the Convention, for I am not one; both these, as before said, have been rendered null and void; I ask it, not as a man against whom there is any accusation, for there is none; I ask it, not as an exile from America, whole liberties I have honourably and generously contributed to establish; I ask it as a citizen of America, deprived of his liberty in France, under the plea of being a foreigner; and I ask it, because I conceive I am entitled to it upon every principle of constitutional justice and national honour.</P>
