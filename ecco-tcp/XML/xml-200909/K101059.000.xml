<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FRUITFUL in good and ill, the teaming earth</L>
<L>To wheat and tares affords promiscuous birth:</L>
<L>At once, from nature's womb, rise woe and weal;</L>
<L>The springs that poison, and the streams that heal.</L>
<L>Nay more, her offspring each and all contain,</L>
<L>Within themselves, both antidote and bane.</L>
<L>Each is a jarring world, where death yields life;</L>
<L>And concord rises out of endless strife.</L>
<L>Each seems distinct, yet all together bound:</L>
<L>And separate and collectively is found</L>
<L>A hoard of infinite; a countless mass</L>
<L>Of miracles within a blade of grass.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First of the tribe, and master of the whole,</L>
<L>Man stands erect; the sovereign and the soul.</L>
<L>In him all union and disunion shine:</L>
<L>He's now above half brute; now more than half divine.</L>
<L>Wayward in humour; infinite in wit;</L>
<L>The slave of all, to none will he submit;</L>
<L>In act an idiot; in conceit a sage;</L>
<L>Mov'd by a breath, he'll brave the tempest's rage;</L>
<L>Now soar, a demi-god; now sink, a straw;</L>
<L>Now weep, a child; now give the planets law.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Railing at wretchedness, in folly wise,</L>
<L>Alive to all the bliss that he denies,</L>
<L>Worthy your laughter or perhaps your tears,</L>
<L>Brain-sick of errors past, to night appears</L>
<L>A moody mortal; sketch'd on this mad plan;</L>
<L>A surly misanthrope, and yet a man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Within his orbit other beings move;</L>
<L>Some urg'd by av'rice, others spurr'd by love,</L>
<L>To aid or injure him, as passion drives;</L>
<L>The worst of servants; and the best of wives:</L>
<L>With many more, all waiting here within;</L>
<L>My task being ended, ready to begin.</L>
<L>Hear, and decide, like men who think and feel:</L>
<L>For, from this night's decree, there's no appeal.</L>

<P>He has various tormentors; his wife, or ra∣ther her proud relations, are among the chief; and he dreads they should come to the knowledge of this se∣cret.

A nonentity. Ex∣istence? A misfortune, a burthen. None but fools condescend to live. Men exert their whole faculties to torture one another. Animals are the prey of ani∣mals. Flowers bloom to be plucked and perish. The very grass grows to be torn and eaten: trees to be mangled, sawed, rooted up, and burned. The whole is a system of exquisite misery, and I have my full pro∣portion!—Oh! this girl!

<P>Let me do her justice: She is a miracle of forbearance. I have hated and spurned at the kindness I did not deserve. Her perseverance in good has been my astonishment and my torture.</P>

<P>Indeed you are wrong. Had I not been guilty of a thousand errors, you never would have had occasion for this self reproach. Like cowards, we both have shunned inquiry. Let us be more cou∣rageous; let us affectionately communicate our mutual mistakes, and while we examine we shall correct the mind, expand the heart, and render ourselves dear to each other, and beneficent to the whole world.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> POPE.</SPEAKER>
<L>AND now, thrice gentle friends, our plotting ended,</L>
<L>We hope you're pleas'd—at least not much offended?</L>
<L>Surely, you'll own it was a little moving,</L>
<L>To see a modern wife so very loving!</L>
<L>Who deems the marriage vow a thing expedient!</L>
<L>And is at once meek! faithful! and obedient!</L>
<L>Such whims were common in the golden age:</L>
<L>And still they may be met with—on the stage:</L>
<L>But grant they now are false, past contradiction,</L>
<L>We hope they yet may be endur'd—in fiction.</L>

<L>Whose courtly trade it was to wait upon her;</L>
<L>To quaff brown stout, yet not be overtaken,</L>
<L>Breakfast on beef, and sup on eggs and bacon?</L>
<L>In those strange days, I can't say what might happen!</L>
<L>Virtue might, then, be thought the woman's weapon!</L>
<L>But daughters now like me, whate'er we feign,</L>
<L>No where exist; but in a poet's brain!</L>
<L>Such blunders are too gross! No soul can brook 'em!</L>
<L>And yet I wish, for once, you'd overlook 'em.</L>

<L>Begins to cant of conscience, love, and duty?</L>
<L>Was such stuff ever heard? Ye sprigs of fashion,</L>
<L>Say, is it thus you treat the tender passion?</L>
<L>'Ere such shall come, and prophets shall speak truth!</L>
