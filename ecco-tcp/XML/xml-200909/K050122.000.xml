<P>If this addle pate of mine play me no trick, marry, thus it was—during the troubles of the late reign—peaceful right was elbow'd out by warlike might—then Rodomsko our present Lord, taking 'vantage of the time, when our troops were on the frontier, tugging with the common enemy, made inroad on us: On this, Radzano hied him back to his castle; but, alack! might cuffed down right, and, in the encounter, our good and brave lord was slain—Ah! stranger, that was a grievous day.</P>

<P>By my faith! well, urged—Lord Cardinal your words befit as well the objects of true policy, as they attune with the holy mandate of your calling. Yes! our country shall have peace! true; these Teutonic Knights have disgraced their order, turning from chris∣tian service and true chivalry, to deeds of usurpa∣tion and dominion! yet nerved, tho' we are to check these ravagers; it befits us rather with firm expostulation to meet our enemy than risk our subjects blood in keen encounter—let conquerors astound the ear with the din of war, the trumpets clangor, and the groans of captives—be mine the clamours of my people's love.</P>

<P>A woman good, my liege, and fair as fortune e'er was pictured, yet, in sooth, without her fickleness; and only blind in her fond love of me. My King may well remember when I left the embattled frontier.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rad.</SPEAKER>
<P>I reached my castle time enough to see its ruin—Rodomsko triumphed. In a remote apartment, constructed for concealment, I lay hid, hoping for life and better days; that apart∣ment was selected for Rodomsko's daughter, the beauteous Rosolia, to her pitying ear I told my story; and her soft bosom, rich in nature's best
