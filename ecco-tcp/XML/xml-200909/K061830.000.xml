<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>YE warbling songsters of the vocal grove,</L>
<L>Why waste you thus your soothing melody?</L>
<L>Sweet bubbling fountains, wherefore mix your voice</L>
<L>With the soft murmurs of the sighing breeze?</L>
<L>Were ye not given to charm the ear of peace,</L>
<L>The fair associate of liberty?—</L>
<L>These unpropitious regions claim you not!</L>
<L>Haste to Zanfara, and the happy shades</L>
<L>That crown her river's banks and crowd her shores;</L>
<L>From whence you long, too long, have been estrang'd,</L>
<L>With your Jaqueena; whom alas! such dark</L>
<L>And dire mischance involves, that hitherto</L>
<L>Her weak and wandering hope no period sees,</L>
<L>But in the arms of death!—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>enters.</STAGE>
<L>—I seek my maid</L>
<L>With anxious steps, and still some solemn scene</L>
<L>Invites her melancholy stay, and owns</L>
<L>Her tears; shall not Amelia partake</L>
<L>Your woes, and with her love alleviate</L>
<L>The griefs that rend dear Laura's tender heart?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>If kind Amelia was not made so fair,</L>
<L>If she was not of Christian principles,</L>
<L>I might be led to trust her female heart</L>
<L>Possess'd compassion; but the frozen hue</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>That nature plants upon her outward form,</L>
<L>And what prescribes the maxims of her breast,</L>
<L>Make me at once to tremble and distrust:</L>
<L>And poor Jaqueena lives without a friend!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Laura's sweet benevolence of heart,</L>
<L>And the intelligence that forms her mind,</L>
<L>Should lift her far above such prejudice:</L>
<L>Or fair or dusk the hue that climate gives,</L>
<L>The blood that warms the veins with streams of life,</L>
<L>In both the same, with equal passion fires</L>
<L>The soul, with equal ardour in the sacred cause</L>
<L>Of honour beats, and forms the heart for love.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>There is such soft delusion in your words,</L>
<L>(And what we wish we readiest believe)</L>
<L>I almost am persuaded in my mind,</L>
<L>Amelia holds a sister heart to mine.</L>
<L>But your stern deity still looks unmov'd</L>
<L>On massacre and blood, on slavery</L>
<L>And woe, avenging not—alas! I sink</L>
<L>Under the horror of his devotees.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>The time will come, my Laura, when you'll know</L>
<L>The wretches, who commit such dreadful crimes,</L>
<L>Are not of the religion you accuse.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Were they not Christians that on Niger's flood,</L>
<L>On board their dreadful bark, receiv'd the lost</L>
<L>Jaqueena? (for the name of Laura bears</L>
<L>The badge of slavery, and my reproach.)</L>
<L>Are they, not Christians, who, in all this land,</L>
<L>Make the poor Africans perform the task</L>
<L>Of beasts; not barely to sustain the toil,</L>
<L>But to endure the torture; and with stripes,</L>
<L>With nakedness and hunger, to lie down,</L>
<L>Stall'd worse than beasts, to rankle in their sores?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>This is too much, sweet Laura; thus with tears,</L>
<L>See me lament my country's hapless crimes;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>And the vile prejudice which clogs the wheel</L>
<L>Of partial justice.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Can a slave then hope</L>
<L>For your humanity?—for tho' the blood</L>
<L>Is of one dye, without congenial suns</L>
<L>It ripens not, nor meliorates to love.</L>
<L>Yet will I not forget your bounteous gifts,</L>
<L>For Africans know not ingratitude!</L>
<L>I am a slave, not knowing bondage here,</L>
<L>But in detention from my native land;</L>
<L>For my kind mistress, as Amelia kind,</L>
<L>Nor gives me chains nor stripes, nor wears a frown.</L>
<L>There are some Christians of a milder soul,</L>
<L>And such poor Laura happily protect;</L>
<L>For if Amelia calls me by that name,</L>
<L>Its terrors cease, tho' it still comprehends</L>
<L>The tenor of my fortune.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Whilst your mind</L>
<L>Seems thus imprest with favourable thoughts,</L>
<L>And you confess Amelia's not severe,</L>
<L>Trust to my ear the story of your life,</L>
<L>And make me more your friend by sorrowing more,</L>
<L>By mingling mutual griefs with Laura's tears.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>A soothing melancholy still succeeds</L>
<L>The repetition of each solemn tale,</L>
<L>Misfortune has to tell.—In silence, grief</L>
<L>Preys most upon the soul; from sympathy,</L>
<L>From soft compassion of our sorrowings,</L>
<L>A sweet alleviation gently breathes.</L>
<L>Not of inferior race, my father rul'd</L>
<L>A province of the realm of Benin.—</L>
<L>Oft approbation shone upon his eye,</L>
<L>Oft fond affection fill'd my mother's looks,</L>
<L>Whilst on their smiling progeny they gaz'd,</L>
<L>And call'd, and kiss'd their daughter, now your slave.</L>

<L>Propitious fortunes to their darling child.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nor were their hopes mere shadows of the mind;</L>
<L>For with affection's tenderest concern</L>
<L>My steps were follow'd, and my looks pursu'd;</L>
<L>They rul'd another's fate:—with breasts of ice,</L>
<L>As barren as the snows they emulate,</L>
<L>You fair ones call such truths mere vanity;</L>
<L>The great Manzaro kneel'd to win my heart:</L>
<L>What wretchedness is mine!—I lov'd the Prince,</L>
<L>Whom only death can to my love restore:</L>
<L>On his tremendous wing he'll bear me hence,</L>
<L>And to Zanfara waft this spirit safe,</L>
<L>Superior to the frauds of cruel men.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Some better Iot, sweet Laura, may betide.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hope has departed hence, and left my soul</L>
<L>To follow after, when all earthly griefs</L>
<L>Are dissipated by the hand of death.</L>
<L>It soothes the sorrows of my wretched mind,</L>
<L>To grave the rock with piteous characters,</L>
<STAGE>(Points to the rock.)</STAGE>
<L>That move the fountain's never-ceasing tears,</L>
<L>To weep for ever o'er Manzara's name;</L>
<L>Whilst gentle spirits in the sighing winds,</L>
<L>On the sad sculptures mourn, that memorize</L>
<L>My mother and my brothers.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA</SPEAKER>
<L>—What of them?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Within the forest's skirts our tents were pitch'd,</L>
<L>For more commodious hunting; far advanc'd</L>
<L>The men were on the chase; when we, who held</L>
<L>The little camp, were taken prisoners:</L>
<L>A horrid tribe of robbers, then in league</L>
<L>With Europeans, trading to our states,</L>
<L>Had stolen upon our unsuspicious guards.</L>

<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of what complexion, of what country born,</L>
<L>Were those base violators of the land?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>The cruel leaders were of British birth,</L>
<L>The rest of Africa; but long possess'd</L>
<L>By the fell demons of Europa's shores,</L>
<L>They, to recruit the heart for wickedness,</L>
<L>Imbibe infernal furies in their drink,</L>
<L>From deepest hell by chymic magic rais'd,</L>
<L>That drive the brain to madness, and impel</L>
<L>The hand to deeds of darkness.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—What ensued?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Our men were bound in fetters, neck to neck,</L>
<L>And hand to hand, and we their woeful steps</L>
<L>Must needs pursue:—when, frantic with her grief,</L>
<L>My mother seiz'd a javelin for revenge,</L>
<L>And by her angry arm one chieftain fell:</L>
<L>But anger and resistance were in vain!</L>
<L>She dy'd beneath a thousand dreadful wounds;</L>
<L>Whilst to her bleeding bosom, grasping close,</L>
<L>In agonies of death, her youngest son,</L>
<L>A cruel lance transfix'd both breasts at once;</L>
<L>And as the boy hung writhing on the shaft,</L>
<L>The wretches made diversion of his pangs.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O Britain! where's thy boasted excellence?</L>
<L>Thy fame, that sounds on every peopled shore?</L>
<L>Thy vaunted jurisprudence, and thy love</L>
<L>Of liberty?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—I then conceiv'd no thought</L>
<L>Of what might follow, what should be our fate;</L>
<L>But in immediate sorrows my sad mind</L>
<L>Was all absorb'd.—We were receiv'd on board</L>
<L>A vessel, crowded with a wretched race:</L>
<L>Description finds no language to express</L>
<L>The horrors of the voyage.—The hand of fate</L>

<L>My soul is full of grief; and yet a ray</L>
<L>Of hope divine, like some prophetic light,</L>
<L>By influence of guardian angel given,</L>
<L>Takes hold upon my mind. —But we're observ'd;</L>
<L>You must avoid the person that draws near;</L>
<L>Retire, and spare your grief; the tale he brings</L>

<L>That no felicity can e'er attend</L>
<L>Riches obtain'd by such inhuman ways.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Are these untoward sentiments conceiv'd</L>
<L>From Laura's guileful tears and whining tales?</L>
<L>Can my Amelia estrange her mind</L>
<L>From reason, and her proper judgment yield</L>
<L>To errors, which prevail alone through fraud?</L>

<L>What inhumanity disturbs your thoughts?</L>
<L>The navigator is not culpable;</L>
<L>He takes the common traffic of the land,</L>
<L>And by his toil brings riches to the state;</L>
<L>The police of the nations there is such,</L>
<L>Like other animals, the herdsman sells</L>
<L>The Negro drove.—</L>

<L>—I tremble at the thought!</L>
<L>They that promote the sin, partake the crime.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Inferior in creation, tho' in form</L>
<L>Of human kind;—each race of animals</L>
<L>Knows its gradations;—and from perfect man,</L>
<L>The Negro tribe is intermediate;</L>
<L>It links the series, that straight descend</L>
<L>Into the monkey line.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—If you would save</L>
<L>My mind from detestation, treat not thus</L>
<L>A subject, over which my labouring soul</L>
<L>Endures acutest pangs; if you would win</L>
<L>My better sentiments, this traffic leave;</L>
<L>The generous association join,</L>
<L>Who labour in humanity's great cause,</L>

<L>'Tis well, Antonio, and my confidence</L>
<L>Renews: my Laura's sorrows fill my mind;</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>And when obtain'd, what prospect will ensue?</L>
<L>Where are the means of giving happiness?</L>
<L>You'll only send her forth to meagre want,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>And in a foreign land, a vagabond,</L>
<L>Expose her to a thousand miseries.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>She must return to Africa again,</L>
<L>Her country, and her friends.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Romantic thought!</L>
<L>The wand'ring tribe she left, perhaps dispers'd,</L>
<L>The government dissolv'd, new tyrants reign;</L>
<L>And warfare, the rough habit of their lives,</L>
<L>With chequer'd fortunes marks each petty Prince,</L>
<L>Now reigning, now in chains,—on Afric's coast,</L>
<L>To greater perils, greater woes expos'd;</L>
<L>There's not a slave that in this province toils,</L>
<L>But, if return'd, would worship the dire name</L>
<L>Of slavery, that makes them tremble now.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your arguments enlarge the dreadful bounds</L>
<L>Of that vast sin which on your traffic rests;</L>
<L>If restitution is impossible,</L>
<L>The base captivity, (that thus cuts off</L>
<L>All human hope, and no kind limit yields</L>
<L>To the sad injury, but in the tomb,)</L>
<L>Of all the crimes on earth, becomes the worst:</L>
<L>My weary mind now finds no resting-place,</L>

<L>—Desist, desist,</L>
<L>I'll hear no more.—'Tis in the human mind</L>
<L>The various estimates of happiness</L>
<L>Are rang'd, whilst free and voluntary will</L>
<L>Directs the choice.—It is not luxury,</L>
<L>With all its artificial wants and woes,</L>
<L>That points out the criterion to mankind:</L>
<L>It is not circumstance, prescrib'd and bound</L>
<L>Within the limits of necessity,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>(For that's a term mere fashion has assum'd)</L>
<L>That points where Happiness shall stay her foot:</L>
<L>'Tis habit that prepares the mind for ease;</L>
<L>And knowing no restraint, contentment gives</L>
<L>The various types that various nations hold,</L>
<L>Whence to characterise the heavenly gift,</L>
<L>Each calls felicity.—The human soul</L>
<L>Finds liberty so innate, through the world</L>
<L>The love of it prevails.—See, Pembroke comes,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CALABAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>THIS was a glorious voyage!—The sturdy knaves</L>
<L>Are fit for any labour, and we bring</L>
<L>Full fifteen hundred safely to the port.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>What province are they of?—For much depends</L>
<L>Upon the breed; some of the upland slaves,</L>
<L>That border on the desert, are of mind</L>
<L>So dark and so indocile, that they seem</L>
<L>Of one gradation only above brutes;</L>
<L>Those of more eastern clime are indolent,</L>
<L>(As bears are sluggish, and not mov'd by stripes,)</L>
<L>They'll neither serve the mill nor till the ground.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CALABAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, master, mine are of the fav'rite breed;</L>
<L>Twice ten degrees remov'd from the baboon;</L>
<L>Their form is human, and they're almost men:</L>
<L>Boney and strong, of countenance acute,</L>
<L>And as hyaenas savage:—they're the slaves</L>
<L>For labour; as the mind is fierce and quick,</L>
<L>Their bodies in proportion active are;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="16"/>On mountains skirts and wilds of Zara bred,</L>
<L>The topsmen drove the herd to Niger's banks,</L>
<L>The mart of Africa.—</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Five hundred males</L>
<L>I purchase at your price; but in the lot</L>
<L>I'll not receive that brute, that stands aloof,</L>
<L>And looks as if he held high estimate</L>
<L>Of his own consequence; a slave like him</L>
<L>Would soon create a mutiny, and stir</L>
<L>My whole plantation into plots and vile</L>
<L>Conspiracies.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CALABAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>—The creature's only mad,</L>
<L>Through separation from his concubines:</L>
<L>So the fierce bull would bellow and rebound,</L>
<L>When from the pasture driven that holds his kine:</L>
<L>Keep him but low in food, and hard at work,</L>
<L>And all those fiery sparks his nature holds,</L>
<L>Will in free perspiration dissipate.</L>

<L>Dost thou, Martino, purchase any slaves?</L>
<L>Here is the carcase-man.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CALABAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>—And thou the knave</L>
<L>That would destroy thy country by thy wiles;</L>
<L>For if the council, mov'd by such men's cries,</L>
<L>Should pass the curs'd emancipation vote,</L>
<L>The envious Britons, who could not subdue,</L>
<L>Will triumph in the ruin, treachery</L>
<L>Can soon effect, by wretches such as thee.</L>

<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah! horrid spectacle of misery</L>
<L>And foul disgrace!—Are these thy wretched sons,</L>
<L>Long suffering Afric?—These of thy race</L>
<L>Of mighty men, whose hardy sinews draw</L>
<L>The sounding bow, and launch the javelin</L>
<L>With mortal strength?—Who, destitute of fear,</L>

<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Was this the land where that celestialdrug,</L>
<L>That cures a thousand evils of the mind,</L>
<L>Was planted by the seraphs of the sun,</L>
<L>And by fair daughters of the silent moon</L>
<L>Water'd with dew of heaven, here I might find</L>
<L>The godlike gift of liberty; perhaps</L>
<L>In its vicinity doth justice grow;</L>
<L>Of these I'd mix a potion should disgorge</L>
<L>The monsters of the deep.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>

<L>—Away—revile me not;—</L>
<L>Compassionate my fortune, not contemn</L>
<L>My impotence!—behold these shameful chains;</L>
<L>Are they not peaceable! are not these hands</L>
<L>Submissive?—and this neck obedient?</L>
<L>This is not worthy thy more feeling heart!</L>

<L>Thy moderation merits our esteem;</L>

<L>—I mark thee wond'rous well;</L>
<L>And if the spirits of my ancestors</L>
<L>Have not forsaken me, or lost their course</L>
<L>O'er the wide desert of the dreary main,</L>
<L>Perhaps the deity which we adore</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="19"/>Will not forget me in a foreign land;</L>

<L>He knows not what he says.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>—Too true, alas!</L>
<L>Mad with my injuries, and scoff'd at too:</L>
<L>As stubble to the lightning, I could shake</L>
<L>These links to atoms, that my vengeful eyes</L>
<L>Might see thy heart's blood spout; but that my views</L>
<L>Are larger, and this friend to human kind</L>
<L>Has breath'd into my soul a nobler hope,</L>
<L>And made me dream of justice.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CALABAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>—And thy dream</L>
<L>Will, like the vision of the rolling cloud,</L>
<L>Dissolve, and only mock thy sickly brain:</L>
<L>Return,—and at the lodge where thou art stall'd</L>
<L>Wait for to-morrow's market.—</L>

<HEAD><HI>ACT III.</HI> Scene, the Groves near the Governor's Palace.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> ANTONIO <HI>with the</HI> MOOR.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>I Mark'd his countenance, and tho' there seem'd</L>
<L>A want of openness, simplicity,</L>
<L>The character of truth, stood in his looks:</L>
<L>His words were few, but pertinent and strong;</L>
<L>And thence persuaded into confidence,</L>
<L>I trusted one chief secret to his ear.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>If nothing more was trusted, all is well.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>You entertain some doubts.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Hypocrisy</L>
<L>Can mask the guileful measures of the heart</L>
<L>With fairest guise:—when he assumes too much,</L>
<L>He gives distrust:—no outward show's requir'd</L>
<L>By virtue.—Tho' the homely dress denies</L>
<L>The power of riches, avarice prevails,</L>
<L>Lucre of gold, and traffic is his God.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ha!—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Next of kin to griping avarice</L>
<L>Is fraud.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Am I betray'd?—Has he deceiv'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Be not alarm'd; perhaps I doubt too much.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Attend,—are we perceiv'd?—can no one hear?</L>
<L>All's safe.—In infancy my father plac'd</L>
<L>His first-born son with a most holy seer,</L>
<L>The high-priest of the Gods, to educate</L>
<L>In all the sacred learning of the sage;</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="28"/>Who, having gift of prophecy, would oft</L>
<L>Gaze on my face with tears, and cast his signs,</L>
<L>To try if some good star might still prevail</L>
<L>Against predestin'd evils, which he saw</L>
<L>Wrote in the book of fate; from study deep</L>
<L>And science most divine, discovering</L>
<L>A favourable planet, he divulg'd</L>
<L>His thoughts.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—I'm all attention.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>—"Still the Gods</L>
<L>"Are willing to preserve thee from the woes</L>
<L>"That shall beset thy steps; in time to come,</L>
<L>"(Nor distant far the years) captivity</L>
<L>"Shall be thy wretched fate.—A charm I hold</L>
<L>"Will from the misery of that estate</L>
<L>"Have power to liberate thee, if apply'd</L>
<L>"With wisdom."—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Strange anxiety pursues</L>
<L>Thy story.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Straight he bound my trembling limbs</L>
<L>Fast to the sacred altar, and my eyes</L>
<L>With mystic fillet clos'd; then on my thigh</L>
<L>Incision made, and introduc'd the charm,</L>
<L>Extorting vows, that, till occasion call'd,</L>
<L>If there should rest conceal'd; and if such ill</L>
<L>As was foretold might yet averted be</L>
<L>By pious works, or aid of powers above,</L>
<L>That to the grave the holy boon I'd bear,</L>
<L>Where he had plac'd it.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—A prescience</L>
<L>Astonishing!—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>—The dire event was come,</L>
<L>And now the time and due occasion call'd</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="29"/>For this important gift to make its way</L>
<L>To light, and give me liberty.—I told</L>
<L>The secret to my friend, to Pembroke told</L>
<L>What gift I held; and tho' he would deny</L>
<L>What superstition seem'd, he lent his hand,</L>
<L>And with a lancet brought a jewel forth</L>
<L>That would have ransom'd all the slaves you hold.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis well I know the secret of this trust;</L>
<L>Perhaps he may prove faithful; but if not,</L>
<L>I am thy witness to confront his fraud:</L>
<L>So great a trust, for avarice to tempt,</L>
<L>Will prove his virtue to its very source.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>You see what inadvertency pursu'd</L>
<L>The strange event;—for had I known what charm</L>
<L>The holy priest bestow'd, more privacy</L>
<L>Would have prevail'd:—but full of pious faith,</L>
<L>I thought I merely held some mystic gift</L>
<L>To influence the powers invisible.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>To what intent was Pembroke then to hold</L>
<L>The gem?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>—To change it into ready gold,</L>
<L>Or borrow on its value what might serve</L>
<L>For my redemption, and supply the calls</L>
<L>Of other exigence.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—The time draws near</L>
<L>When 'tis accustom'd that the council sits.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>You'll be my friend?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Depend upon my word.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Whilst I look after Pembroke, should you meet,</L>
<L>Use the intelligence as may seem best.</L>

<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'll see you at the hall—
<STAGE>(Exit Moor.)</STAGE></L>
<L>—A second claim</L>
<L>Calls forth humanity.—The subtle knave!</L>
<L>Should he betray the injur'd Moor in this,</L>
<L>The act would prove of greater cruelty</L>
<L>Than bondage.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>How fruitless are our hopes!—my troubled heart</L>
<L>Some gleams of consolation entertain'd</L>
<L>To soothe this gloomy lot of adverse life,</L>
<L>In the attention and the gracious smiles</L>
<L>Teresa shew'd her slave: but now, alas!</L>
<L>Without offence, unconscious of the cause,</L>
<L>I meet her frown austere, and angry pride</L>
<L>Sits low'ring on her brow.—</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>JEROME</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>enters.</STAGE>
<L>—Still sunk in grief!</L>
<L>In all her woe there's such a dignity,</L>
<L>Such unfeign'd virtue shines from out her mind,</L>
<L>As testifies superior sentiment.
<STAGE>(aside)</STAGE></L>
<L>Where haste you, Laura?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—That I may, my lord,</L>
<L>Not interrupt your privacy.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Stay, stay!</L>
<L>For I would speak to thee, would dry those tears,</L>

<L>Nay hold me not.—</L>

<L>Spare me, my lord, spare your poor abject slave.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>—Then let me pass.</L>

<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, I must plant upon those velvet lips</L>
<L>Ten thousand kisses.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Am I not your slave?</L>
<L>Is yet my dreadful ruin incomplete,</L>
<L>Whilst I retain one gift deriv'd of Heaven,</L>
<L>My virtue?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Banish all thy fears, sweet maid;</L>
<L>I will not rob thee.—</L>

<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Alas! my lord,</L>
<L>If I possess'd such quality of mind</L>
<L>As might your pity still have merited,</L>
<L>It was my hatred of vile perfidy,</L>
<L>My firm integrity, my steady truth,</L>
<L>And yet unblotted fame.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—All these I love,</L>
<L>Nor would I tempt thee into perfidy,</L>
<L>But have thee true as magnet to the pole.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then think of your Teresa, sacred name</L>
<L>Of wedded love.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Thy fair integrity</L>
<L>I would not stain, nor virtue would seduce,</L>
<L>But try t'engage them both on my behalf.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And break them with Amelia?—</L>

<L>And dost thou talk of virtue?—Afric's maids</L>
<L>Are not so coy.—</L>
</SP>

<L>—Disgrace not your great mind</L>
<L>With sentiments so far beneath the cast</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="33"/>Of that high erudition you have known.</L>
<L>In ev'ry clime fair virtue is the same;</L>
<L>And tho' the vertic sun pours forth his beams</L>
<L>Upon the eastern world, and whilst the frosts</L>
<L>With torpid fetters bind the northern climes,</L>
<L>Yet virtue has her sanctity in each:</L>
<L>In each rever'd by Heaven, and priz'd on earth,</L>
<L>Inestimable gift!—If pure is light,</L>
<L>(God's emanation here)—if fair the moon,</L>
<L>If bright the stars,—(those brilliant eyes of night)</L>
<L>If heaven's blue vault's unspotted and serene,</L>
<L>The great Supreme on purity must look</L>
<L>With love divine.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—To prate, to argue thus,</L>

<L>Was it for this the nobles of my house</L>

<L>For what, Teresa?—</L>

<L>Can sorrow lift her footsteps then so high?</L>

<L>Shame scarce permits the tale:—the governor</L>

<L>My mother's heart is fir'd with jealousy;</L>
<L>And for our household peace, poor Laura's fate</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>SUCH is the subtlety of this man's mind,</L>
<L>That to disarm me of my chief pretext,</L>
<L>As he conceives, on an appeal to justice,</L>
<L>He has restor'd me these habiliments;</L>
<L>But with rapacious hand has torn from thence</L>
<L>Those ensigns which my injuries explain;</L>
<L>The evidence which might maintain my cause,</L>
<L>My tablets, in whose records stood enroll'd</L>
<L>My country and my name.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Will you decline</L>
<L>The application which you had design'd,</L>
<L>And trust to Pembroke's ransoming?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>—I think</L>
<L>'Twere better to try both.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—I wait your will.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>If from the force of truth I might prevail,</L>
<L>If Heaven should send some unforeseen relief,</L>
<L>Or move by secret influence the minds</L>
<L>Of those whom we address, more honour stands</L>
<L>Confess'd than when the price that liberates</L>
<L>The meanest son of slavery obtains</L>
<L>The indiscriminate effect.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Behold,</L>
<L>The council sits,—draw near and make thy plea.</L>

<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>With sacred awe and pious reverence</L>
<L>This high tribunal I approach; I'm told</L>
<L>Here Heaven's vicegerents sitting to dispense,</L>
<L>As secondary causes, wise decrees,</L>
<L>Will judge my plaints, and my petition hear:</L>
<L>If justice holds a balance that defies</L>
<L>All undue influence, and pois'd aloft</L>
<L>Preponderates alone to truth, report</L>
<L>Will not have trifled with my miseries.</L>
<L>Behold the victim of an adverse fate</L>
<L>Bends with humility before the seat</L>
<L>Of government, and tho' an African,</L>
<L>Craves for the common benefit of laws</L>
<L>That scorn partiality—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Proceed to state</L>
<L>The grievances you hope we may redress:</L>
<L>Justice and right humanity's great cause</L>
<L>Are not confin'd to subjects of this land,</L>
<L>But from the jurisprudence of the state</L>
<L>Are equally the claim of all mankind.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Brought here by force, and from my country torn,</L>
<L>By one who steer'd his vessel to our coasts;</L>
<L>Depriv'd of property, and suff'ring ills</L>
<L>Which shock the human ear in their detail;</L>
<L>Should he not shew on what pretence of right</L>
<L>He perpetrates such deeds?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Call forth the man.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st COUNSEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Wherefore do you detain the Moor?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CALABAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>—I bought</L>
<L>The slave.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>—'Tis false.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
<SPEAKER>2d COUNSEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Your supercargo call</L>
<L>To prove the fact.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CALABAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>—If you hold out this law,</L>
<L>The trade is much in jeopardy; each slave</L>
<L>May controvert the truth, and call for proofs</L>
<L>The navigator never thought to have.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>Was this man gain'd by private sale, or came</L>
<L>Promiscuously with other slaves?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CALABAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Alone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st COUNSEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Have you no witnesses?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CALABAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>—If such I had,</L>
<L>I would not for the fatal precedent</L>
<L>Produce them here.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d COUNSEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Where is the supercargo?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know not whence, or how he was obtain'd;</L>
<L>When first I saw him, on the deck he lay,</L>
<L>Benumb'd, and totally depriv'd of sense,</L>
<L>By some most powerful dose of opiate;</L>
<L>His garb uncommon led me to enquire</L>
<L>Concerning him, but no intelligence</L>
<L>Was gain'd.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—What sayest thou?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Your patient ear</L>
<L>Must hear captivity's unhappy tale;</L>
<L>As little hope depends on passions mov'd,</L>
<L>The influence I seek is truth.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st COUNSEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>—To facts,</L>
<L>And not to flow'ry phrase, confine your plea.</L>

<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>The former year, by some rapacious bands,</L>
<L>(A roving tribe that rang'd the forest's skirts</L>
<L>In search of captives to supply the trade</L>
<L>Which Europeans hold) the scatter'd tents</L>
<L>Of princes hunting, and by females held,</L>
<L>Were sack'd and pillag'd, and the families</L>
<L>Were driven to the shores, and sold for slaves.</L>
<L>Of them a maid, whom love had made my own,</L>
<L>And sacred rites had form'd our union:</L>
<L>This sad catastrophe I much had mourn'd,</L>
<L>And, tho' despair possess'd my aching heart,</L>
<L>In th' ensuing season I came down</L>
<L>To Niger's banks, and pass'd the friendly states</L>
<L>With slender equipage, not fearing ill;</L>
<L>That if enquiry might my grief allay,</L>
<L>And I could learn where the dear maid was gone,</L>
<L>I might redeem her.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—What ensu'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>—I brought</L>
<L>Some gems of price, gold dust, and ivory,</L>
<L>To influence such navigators hearts</L>
<L>As might be there.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st COUNCIL.</SPEAKER>
<L>—An influence, 'tis true,</L>
<L>But often misapply'd—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>—It was my fate</L>
<L>To meet a foe like aligator bred,</L>
<L>Amphibious, whose savage love of prey</L>
<L>Alike by land or water rag'd:—I told</L>
<L>My anxious tale with tears,—and might have wept</L>
<L>Unto some statue cut of Parian stone</L>
<L>And rais'd as much emotion:—for his heart</L>
<L>Nor felt compassion, nor compunction's touch;</L>
<L>But from my tent deluding with such cates</L>
<L>As his pernicious cookery prepar'd</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="43"/>In specious friendship and for banquet gay,</L>
<L>I drank a poison that straight reach'd my brain,</L>
<L>And lock'd up ev'ry sense in mimic death;</L>
<L>Then seizing on my treasures, seizing too</L>
<L>My wretched person:—you behold the man!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>What says the captain?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CALABAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>—All the tale is false;</L>
<L>And frantic with his sorrows, here he raves</L>
<L>Of objects which a being never knew.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>How was the gold and ivory bestow'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>We touch'd at many places in our voyage.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st COUNSEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Did you dispose of merchandise?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—We did;</L>
<L>The captain too of ivory and gems.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>What territory did you leave,—or whom</L>
<L>Shall we believe you are?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>—My lords, my birth</L>
<L>Was of Cassaena, and my station there</L>
<L>Superior:—to talk of dignities</L>
<L>Would ill befit my fortune thus revers'd.</L>
<L>Look on the clasp that girds my turban's front,</L>
<L>Where stands engraven the illustrious names</L>
<L>Of the bright sun that rules the golden day;</L>
<L>On every stud, the characters of stars</L>
<L>That fill the firmament;—my pedigree</L>
<L>They note.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Is here an African to prove</L>
<L>One fact insisted on?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Without a friend</L>
<L>You see the suffering Moor:—if that great eye</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="44"/>Of nature, where the radiant seraph sits</L>
<L>Dispensing God's benevolence, could pierce</L>
<L>The stubborn heart of man with rays divine,</L>
<L>There need not evidence.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Was Zangae here,</L>
<L>He'd give some information.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st COUNSEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>—See the man</L>
<L>Entranc'd and prostrate!—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—What occasion moves</L>
<L>This veneration? —</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZANGAE,</SPEAKER>
<L>—I behold my prince,</L>
<L>The great Manzara; of Cassaena's realm</L>
<L>The mighty potentate; a thousand states</L>
<L>Surround his throne, and to his sceptre bow.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Who is it owns Manzara?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZANGAE.</SPEAKER>
<L>—E'en a Moor</L>
<L>From Africa estrang'd, who once obey'd</L>
<L>Thy sov'reignty, and gloried in the name</L>
<L>Of vassal in Cassaena's wealthy land.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou knowest then the titles that I bear.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZANGAE.</SPEAKER>
<L>The names inscrib'd are of thy ancestors,</L>
<L>Whom the prophetic priests in origin</L>
<L>Deduc'd from the bless'd Sun, whose daughters fair</L>
<L>Rule each a star in heaven, whilst you on earth</L>
<L>Know not the limits of your vast domain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Look on that scymeter, and read aloud.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZANGAE.</SPEAKER>
<L>"May the Supreme with great Manzara walk,</L>
<L>"Whose mighty kingdoms neither Cancer girds,</L>
<L>"Nor Capricorn with tropic limit bounds."</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
<SPEAKER>1st COUNSEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>The evidence is singular,—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—The light</L>
<L>Of heaven prevails!—the servants of the Sun</L>
<L>Descend to bless the intellectual mind,</L>
<L>And bring forth holy truth!—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—So very clear</L>
<L>The case, and the discovery so strange,</L>
<L>We cannot hesitate to liberate</L>
<L>The injur'd prince;—and henceforth you are free.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I reverence at once your happy laws,</L>
<L>And the just dispensation that's display'd.</L>
<L>Thanks are indignities to your high trust;</L>
<L>For to such sentence, thanks would but prescribe</L>
<L>The bounds of bounty; whilst the center form'd</L>
<L>By justice is without perimeter.</L>
<L>To prove my mind's not heated for revenge,</L>
<L>The chief possession of the earth regain'd—</L>
<L>My liberty; my goods esteem'd as trash</L>
<L>I yield to his possession:—to the Gods</L>
<L>That brought about this wonderful event</L>
<L>I give the rest; vindictive power is theirs.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exeunt Governor, Council, &amp;c. &amp;c.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>ZANGAE</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>kneels.</STAGE>
<L>Look on poor Zangae, on your humble slave,</L>
<L>Whose most ambitious wish could never soar</L>
<L>To such exalted duty, or his hope</L>
<L>Conceive this glorious service, that he should</L>
<L>Redeem his prince.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Arise, my faithful friend;</L>
<L>If thou wilt henceforth my misfortunes share,</L>
<L>Thou shalt be in my bosom as the gift</L>
<L>Of Heaven, by miracle dispos'd to save</L>
<L>Cassaena's captive lord.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
<SPEAKER>ZANGAE.</SPEAKER>
<L>—By strongest bonds</L>
<L>Of gratitude I serve the governor.</L>
<L>If he—'tis more than I may ask!—my heart</L>
<L>Is rent with woe, whilst duty holds my stay;</L>
<L>For if I follow not my prince, my soul's</L>
<L>In grief:—and if my lord I should forsake,</L>
<L>As faithless,—I should thence unworthy grow.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hereafter I will move it:—still remain</L>
<L>In that distinguish'd service; to his ear,</L>
<L>As the occasion serves, to speak of me;</L>
<L>And thence facilitate my measures here.</L>
<L>Didst thou e'er know Zanfara's beauteous maid?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZANGAE.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis now five years since I became a slave;</L>
<L>I knew her not.—
<STAGE>(retires.)</STAGE></L>

<SPEAKER>MANZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Go and remember me.
<STAGE>(Exit Zangae.)</STAGE></L>

<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Warmer congratulations I could give</L>
<L>Were Pembroke here.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—From this first great event</L>
<L>Much force will be deriv'd; he'll never dare</L>
<L>To injure me.—But as precautions safe,</L>
<L>Let us look after him; there's no success</L>
<L>Attends delay: I wish to hire a ship</L>
<L>To carry me again to Gambia's streams;</L>
<L>There's danger always in a foreign state.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Our thoughts still correspond, let us move on.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEMBROKE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Much secrecy is not requir'd, the fact</L>
<L>Already is too public;—th' alarm</L>
<L>Affects the planters much: conspiracy</L>
<L>Has been discover'd, and a double guard</L>
<L>In some plantations now is necessary.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>What cause to charge Manzara with the crime?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEMBROKE.</SPEAKER>
<L>His name is gone abroad; some slaves were brought</L>
<L>From his dominions, and he oft was seen</L>
<L>In secret converse, pleading earnestly</L>
<L>With much gesticulation.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—To receive</L>
<L>Such vague report and information void</L>
<L>Of proof will not induce the legislative power</L>
<L>To interfere.—There is a dignity</L>
<L>In this much-injur'd man that proves itself;</L>
<L>Such perspicuity in all his phrase,</L>
<L>As shews an erudition none but those</L>
<L>Of the first consequence could e'er attain:</L>
<L>We are not left to doubt his high estate;</L>
<L>From a full sense of those base injuries</L>
<L>He has sustain'd, we gave him liberty;</L>
<L>And now to charge him with such heinous crimes</L>
<L>Against the state, is singular.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEMBROKE.</SPEAKER>
<L>—'Twas I</L>
<L>That pledg'd his ransom to relieve his chains;</L>
<L>'Twas I that mov'd him to his late appeal;</L>
<L>And is it possible, without a cause,</L>
<L>I should accuse the man whom I espous'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>The circumstance appears to me so dark,</L>
<L>That I distrust what I can't comprehend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEMBROKE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I hate the name of slavery, and aid</L>
<L>Emancipation by all powerful means:</L>
<L>But whilst humanity promotes one cause,</L>
<L>Another it preserves,—my country's weal:</L>
<L>When I discover'd that this bosom held</L>
<L>So treacherous a thought as mutiny</L>
<L>Among the slaves, and in its consequence</L>
<L>Subversion of the government, and spoil</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="48"/>Of individuals, I straightway turn'd</L>
<L>Attention to his plots, and found him out.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>How found him out?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEMBROKE.</SPEAKER>
<L>—I held his confidence,</L>
<L>And when he had enlarg'd on golden dreams,</L>
<L>And promises of Afric's wealth, he own'd</L>
<L>Revenge rag'd in his heart; a wish to gain</L>
<L>Retaliation for his country's woes,</L>
<L>And to let loose a bloody hand,—t'appease</L>
<L>The horror which he saw imprest me deep,</L>
<L>He talk'd of vast rewards.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—In consequence</L>
<L>Of confidence like this, would'st thou impeach,</L>
<L>On the mere strength of thy veracity,</L>
<L>This stranger prince?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEMBROKE.</SPEAKER>
<L>—If justice should require,</L>
<L>The deepest secret of my bosom yields</L>
<L>To public good.—But see, Horatio comes,</L>
<L>Perhaps he bears yet more important truths.</L>

<L>—I am in fear;</L>
<L>They gather in cabals, and sullen seem,</L>
<L>Working reluctantly. —</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—But are there grounds</L>
<L>To doubt conspiracy?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—My spies report</L>
<L>That some strange faction has possess'd their minds;</L>
<L>Their priests exhort with vehemence; and oft</L>
<L>They sing the war-song, and they hail their prince,</L>
<L>Whom they rejoice is landed on our coast.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>This may alarm:—but have you cause to charge</L>
<L>Manzara as a secret instrument,</L>
<L>Or as the object of the people's joy?</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have inquir'd; my spies know not his name.</L>

<SPEAKER>MARTINO</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>enters.</STAGE>
<L>We must intreat the aid of government,</L>
<L>Ten thousand slaves now threaten a revolt;</L>
<L>Through my plantation strange commotions reign,</L>

<L>Perhaps upon assembling of the troops,</L>
<L>This ferment may subside.</L>

<L>The fatal consequence a night may bring.</L>
</SP>

<L>What cause appears?—</L>

<L>Were it not best to put the Moor in chains?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>It may be necessary.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEMBROKE.</SPEAKER>
<L>—If th' offence</L>
<L>On full investigation is disprov'd,</L>
<L>He'll stand discharg'd: and no great injury</L>
<L>Sustaining, may depart:—but when compar'd,</L>
<L>The consequences fear'd, with his arrest,</L>
<L>The latter's light as air.—</L>

<L>YOU are deceiv'd and trifled with,—the prince</L>

<L>To stratagems like these.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>—It was a charge</L>
<L>So grounded, and the facts established</L>
<L>By proofs so strong, I could not hesitate</L>
<L>To send him into durance, till we heard</L>
<L>The slaves were peaceful, and the tumult hush'd.</L>

<L>The war-song.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—All a fiction,—all is false;</L>
<L>A tale just calculated to reduce the price</L>
<L>Of my imported cargo, by advice</L>
<L>Of Pembroke, to affect the planters minds</L>
<L>With terror, and prevent their bargaining</L>
<L>In times of pressing danger.—</L>

<L>Protect us from such wiles!—what could induce</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—A hope</L>
<L>Of robbing the afflicted prisoner,</L>
<L>Avoiding justice, and escaping hence,</L>
<L>With such a booty as his avarice</L>
<L>Could not resist:—Integrity</L>
<L>Is a mere outside semblance he assumes,</L>

<L>I know not what's alluded to.—</L>

<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>—A fact,</L>
<L>Will strike you with abhorrence;—having plac'd</L>
<L>Much confidence in this perfidious wretch,</L>
<L>He to his care entrusted a rich gem,</L>
<L>By which he might his ransom and return</L>
<L>Obtain;—in order, with impunity,</L>
<L>To rob the captive stranger he procur'd</L>
<L>First, his imprisonment by a false charge,</L>

<L>What the event?—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>

<L>The stone, nor try'd to hide his purpos'd fraud</L>
<L>By throwing it in the sea; on search,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>

<L>My conscience is disturb'd;—I own my crimes,</L>
<L>And wish that retribution could be had:</L>
<L>The guilty passions were inflam'd with love,</L>

<L>Under pretext of service to the state,</L>

<L>—Manzara! oh much lov'd lord!</L>
<L>From whose dear image fancy never stray'd;</L>
<L>Imprest upon this heart thy character,</L>
<L>Which love conceiv'd, nor day nor night remov'd:</L>
<L>Thou wert the vision of my happiest dream,</L>
<L>And in the gloom of the detested cell,</L>
<L>As o'er the vast Atlantic we were borne,</L>
<L>And when America her slave receiv'd,</L>
<L>Thou held my thoughts, and all my wishes fill'd!</L>
<L>But hope was fled, and black despair was come;</L>
<L>Whilst death alone held out a saving hand:</L>
<L>Rash was the deed, and hapless it has prov'd,</L>
<L>(The gods condemn my want of confidence)</L>
<L>The poison, which my bracelet long conceal'd,</L>
<L>Was—</L>

<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Horrible, and heart distracting tale!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then all my wish'd for happiness is fled,</L>
<L>And launch'd again upon the stormy sea</L>
<L>Of wretchedness, new fortunes I must try;</L>
<L>Pleasures sweet prospects Africa has lost!</L>
<L>Manzara is undone!</L>

<L>Haste for assistance, Zangae,—med'cine</L>

<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Impossible!</L>
<L>The bane is of such subtle quality,</L>
<L>Compounded by Zanfara's wisest dames,</L>
<L>It scorns repelling powers!—the hand of death</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="64"/>Lies heavy on my heart;—and every nerve</L>
<L>Aches with convulsion.—</L>

<L>—Oh misery extreme!</L>
<L>All the monition's lost, which thy fair hand</L>
<L>Inscrib'd upon the rocks, that might have led</L>
<L>To thy discovery and sav'd despair!</L>
<L>There Pembroke too deceiv'd!—and I, employ'd</L>
<L>Too much on selfish views, neglected those</L>
<L>That should have sav'd us both!—but 'tis too late!</L>

<L>Whilst there is life, indulge me with thy gaze,</L>

<L>Sustaining such extremity of woe?</L>

<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<L>If ever more authority I shew,</L>

<L>Compassion for my woes, embalm the corpse,</L>
<L>That Africa may yet receive its own.</L>
<L>We must depart,—must tear ourselves from hence,</L>
<STAGE>(to Jerome.)</STAGE>
<L>The scene of so much terror and distress!</L>
<L>Zangae shall be the partner of my tears:</L>
<L>Tho' seas may shake the helm,—tho' adverse winds</L>
<L>May hang upon the dilatory sail;</L>
<L>Perhaps relenting fates will yet retain</L>
<L>Some pity for the Moor,—that he may land</L>
<L>On native shores,—and there erect on high</L>
<L>A monument, that shall command the hearts</L>
<L>Of our posterity (whilst man exists)</L>
<L>To an abhorrence of <HI>the Trade in Slaves.</HI></L>
