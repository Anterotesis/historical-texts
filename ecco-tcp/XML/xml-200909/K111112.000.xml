<HEAD>AN ELEGY ON A PILE OF RUINS.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the full prospect yonder hill commands,</L>
<L>O'er forests, fields, and vernal-coated plains;</L>
<L>The vestige of an ancient abbey stands,</L>
<L>Close by a ruin'd castle's rude remains.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Half buried, there, lie many a broken bust,</L>
<L>And obelisk, and urn, o'erthrown by TIME;</L>
<L>And many a cherub, here, descends in dust</L>
<L>From the rent roof, and portico sublime.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>The rivulets, oft frighted at the sound</L>
<L>Of fragments, tumbling from the tow'rs on high;</L>
<L>Plunge to their source in secret caves profound,</L>
<L>Leaving their banks and pebbly bottoms dry.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Where rev'rend shrines in Gothic grandeur stood,</L>
<L>The nettle, or the noxious night-shade, spreads;</L>
<L>And ashlings, wafted from the neighb'ring wood,</L>
<L>Through the worn turrets wave their trembling heads.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>There Contemplation, to the crowd unknown,</L>
<L>Her attitude compos'd, and aspect sweet!</L>
<L>Sits musing on a monumental stone,</L>
<L>And points to the MEMENTO at her feet.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Soon as sage ev'ning check'd day's sunny pride,</L>
<L>I left the mantling shade, in moral mood;</L>
<L>And seated by the maid's sequester'd side,</L>
<L>Thus sigh'd, the mould'ring ruins as I view'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Inexorably calm, with silent pace</L>
<L>Here TIME has pass'd—What ruin marks his way!</L>
<L>This pile, now crumbling o'er its hallow'd base,</L>
<L>Turn'd not his step, nor could his course delay.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>Religion rais'd her supplicating eyes</L>
<L>In vain; and Melody, her song sublime:</L>
<L>In vain, Philosophy, with maxims wise,</L>
<L>Would touch the cold unfeeling heart of TIME.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Yet the hoar tyrant, tho' not mov'd to spare,</L>
<L>Relented when he struck its finish'd pride;</L>
<L>And partly the rude ravage to repair,</L>
<L>The tott'ring tow'rs with twisted Ivy tied.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>How solemn is the cell o'ergrown with moss,</L>
<L>That terminates the view, yon cloister'd way!</L>
<L>In the crush'd wall, a time-corroded cross,</L>
<L>Religion like, stands mould'ring in decay!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>Where the mild sun, through saint-encypher'd glass,</L>
<L>Illum'd with mellow light that brown-brow'd isle;</L>
<L>Many rapt hours might Meditation pass,</L>
<L>Slow moving 'twixt the pillars of the pile!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>And Piety, with mystic-meaning beads,</L>
<L>Bowing to saints on ev'ry side inurn'd,</L>
<L>Trod oft the solitary path, that leads</L>
<L>Where, now, the sacred altar lies o'erturn'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>Through the grey grove, between those with'ring trees,</L>
<L>'Mongst a rude group of monuments, appears</L>
<L>A marble-imag'd matron on her knees,</L>
<L>Half wasted, like a Niobe in tears:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>Low levell'd in the dust her darling's laid!</L>
<L>Death pity'd not the pride of youthful bloom;</L>
<L>Nor could maternal piety dissuade,</L>
<L>Or soften the fell tyrant of the tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>The relicks of a mitred saint may rest,</L>
<L>Where, mould'ring in the niche, his statue stands;</L>
<L>Now nameless, as the crowd that kiss'd his vest,</L>
<L>And crav'd the benediction of his hands.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>Near the brown arch, redoubling yonder gloom,</L>
<L>The bones of an illustrious Chieftain lie;</L>
<L>As trac'd upon the time-unletter'd tomb,</L>
<L>The trophies of a broken fame imply.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>Ah! what avails, that o'er the vassal plain,</L>
<L>His rights and rich demesnes extended wide!</L>
<L>That honour, and her knights, compos'd his train,</L>
<L>And chivalry stood marshall'd by his side!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="18">
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<L>Tho' to the clouds his castle seem'd to climb,</L>
<L>And frown'd defiance on the desp'rate foe;</L>
<L>Tho' deem'd invincible, the conqueror, TIME,</L>
<L>Levell'd the fabrick, as the founder, low.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="19">
<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<L>Where the light lyre gave many a soft'ning sound,</L>
<L>Ravens and rooks, the birds of discord, dwell;</L>
<L>And where Society sat sweetly crown'd,</L>
<L>Eternal Solitude has fix'd her cell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="20">
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>XX.</HEAD>
<L>The lizard, and the lazy lurking bat,</L>
<L>Inhabit now, perhaps, the painted room,</L>
<L>Where the sage matron and her maidens sat,</L>
<L>Sweet-singing at the silver-working loom.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="21">
<HEAD>XXI.</HEAD>
<L>The traveller's bewilder'd on a waste;</L>
<L>And the rude winds incessant seem to roar,</L>
<L>Where, in his groves with arching arbours grac'd,</L>
<L>Young lovers often sigh'd in days of yore.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="22">
<HEAD>XXII.</HEAD>
<L>His aqueducts, that led the limpid tide</L>
<L>To pure canals, a chrystal cool supply!</L>
<L>In the deep dust their barren beauties hide:</L>
<L>TIME'S thirst, unquenchable, has drain'd them dry!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="23">
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>XXIII.</HEAD>
<L>Tho' his rich hours in revelry were spent,</L>
<L>With Comus, and the laughter-loving crew;</L>
<L>And the sweet brow of Beauty, still unbent,</L>
<L>Brighten'd his fleecy moments as they flew:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="24">
<HEAD>XXIV.</HEAD>
<L>Fleet are the fleecy moments! fly they must;</L>
<L>Not to be stay'd by masque, or midnight roar!</L>
<L>Nor shall a pulse amongst that mould'ring dust,</L>
<L>Beat wanton at the smiles of Beauty more!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="25">
<HEAD>XXV.</HEAD>
<L>Can the deep statesman, skill'd in great design,</L>
<L>Protract, but for a day, precarious breath?</L>
<L>Or the tun'd follower of the sacred Nine,</L>
<L>Sooth, with his melody, insatiate Death?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="26">
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>XXVI.</HEAD>
<L>No—Tho' the palace bar her golden gate,</L>
<L>Or monarchs plant ten thousand guards around;</L>
<L>Unerring, and unseen, the shaft of fate</L>
<L>Strikes the devoted victim to the ground!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="27">
<HEAD>XXVII.</HEAD>
<L>What then avails Ambition's wide stretch'd wing,</L>
<L>The Schoolman's page, or pride of Beauty's bloom!</L>
<L>The crape-clad hermit, and the rich-rob'd king,</L>
<L>Levell'd lie mix'd promiscuous in the tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="28">
<HEAD>XXVIII.</HEAD>
<L>The Macedonian monarch, wise and good,</L>
<L>Bade, when the morning's rosy reign began,</L>
<L>Courtiers should call, as round his couch they stood,</L>
<L>"PHILIP! remember, thou'rt no more than man.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="29">
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
<HEAD>XXIX.</HEAD>
<L>"Tho' glory spread thy name from pole to pole;</L>
<L>"Tho' thou art merciful, and brave, and just;</L>
<L>"PHILIP, reflect, thou'rt posting to the goal,</L>
<L>"Where mortals mix in undistinguish'd dust!"</L>
</LG>
<LG N="30">
<HEAD>XXX.</HEAD>
<L>So SALADIN, for arts and arms renown'd,</L>
<L>(Egypt and Syria's wide domains subdu'd)</L>
<L>Returning with imperial triumphs crown'd,</L>
<L>Sigh'd, when the perishable pomp he view'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="31">
<HEAD>XXXI.</HEAD>
<L>And as he rode, high in his regal car,</L>
<L>In all the purple pride of conquest drest;</L>
<L>Conspicuous, o'er the trophies gain'd in war,</L>
<L>Plac'd, pendent on a spear, his burial vest:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="32">
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<HEAD>XXXII.</HEAD>
<L>While thus the herald cry'd—"This son of pow'r,</L>
<L>"This SALADIN, to whom the nations bow'd;</L>
<L>"May, in the space of one revolving hour,</L>
<L>"Boast of no other spoil, but yonder shroud!"</L>
</LG>
<LG N="33">
<HEAD>XXXIII.</HEAD>
<L>Search where Ambition rag'd, with rigour steel'd;</L>
<L>Where Slaughter, like the rapid lightning, ran;</L>
<L>And say, while mem'ry weeps the blood-stain'd field,</L>
<L>Where lies the chief, and where the common man?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="34">
<HEAD>XXXIV.</HEAD>
<L>Vain are the pyramids, and motto'd stones,</L>
<L>And monumental trophies rais'd on high!</L>
<L>For TIME confounds them with the crumbling bones,</L>
<L>That mix'd in hasty graves unnotic'd lie.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="35">
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
<HEAD>XXXV.</HEAD>
<L>Rests not, beneath the turf, the peasant's head,</L>
<L>Soft as the lord's, beneath the labour'd tomb?</L>
<L>Or sleeps one colder, in his close clay bed;</L>
<L>Than t'other, in the wide vault's-dreary womb?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="36">
<HEAD>XXXVI.</HEAD>
<L>Hither, let LUXURY lead her loose-rob'd train;</L>
<L>Here flutter PRIDE, on purple-painted wings:</L>
<L>And, from the moral prospect, learn—how vain</L>
<L>The wish, that sighs for sublunary things!</L>
