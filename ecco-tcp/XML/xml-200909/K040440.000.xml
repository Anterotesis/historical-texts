<P>THE following valuable communication, respecting the pre∣sent
state of Husbandry in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and the means of its
improvement, drawn up for the consideration of the Board of Agriculture, is now
printed, merely for the purpose of its being circulated there, in order that
every person interested in the welfare of that county, may have it in his
power, to examine it fully, before it is published. It is therefore requested,
that any remark, or additional obser∣vation, which may occur to the reader, on
the perusal of the following sheets, <HI>may be written on the margin,</HI> and
trans∣mitted to the Board of Agriculture, at its office in London, by whom the
same shall be properly attended to; and when the returns are completed, an
account will be drawn up, of the state of agriculture in the West Riding, from
the informa∣tion thus accumulated, which, it is believed, will be found greatly
superior to any thing of the kind ever yet made public.</P>
<P>The Board has adopted the same plan, in regard to all the other
counties in the united kingdom; and, it is hardly ne∣cessary to add, will be
happy to give every assistance in its power, to any person, who may be desirous
of improving his breed of cattle, sheep, &amp;c. or of trying any useful
experiment in husbandry.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is requested, that this Paper, may be returned to the Board of
Agriculture, as soon as may be convenient.</P>
<P>It is hardly necessary to add, that the Board does not con∣sider
itself responsible, for any fact or observation contained in these Reports,
which, at present, are printed and circulated, for the purpose merely of
procuring additional information, and of enabling every one, to contribute his
mite, to the im∣provement of his country.</P>

<HEAD>To Sir JOHN SINCLAIR, Bart. President of the Board of
Agriculture.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with your request, we have surveyed the West Riding
of Yorkshire, and from the annexed Report, we trust the Board will receive
satisfactory information, respecting the stock and husbandry of that important
district.</P>
<P>During our survey, we used every means in our power, to ob∣tain
accurate information of the different systems under which the practice of
husbandry was carried on, and made particular inquiries, into the mode by which
estates are managed, as well as the nature of the connection that subsisted
between landlord and tenant. It is possible, that from the extent of the West
Riding, and the comparative shortness of time we could conve∣niently devote to
this business, that some parts of the country, and some practices prevailing in
it, may have escaped our atten∣tion. These circumstances, will, we hope, be
duly considered by those, who peruse this Report. Any mistakes we may have
inadvertently committed, we trust to the candour of the pro∣prietors and
farmers, to excuse and to rectify.</P>
<P>It gives us pleasure to acquaint you, that, in the course of our
survey, we experienced every possible politeness and attention; all ranks in a
manner vying with each other, to promote the public undertaking entrusted to
us. Agreeable to your desire, a return is herewith made, of those persons who
gave us assistance and information.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="6"/> As very little has been written upon the
general state of this dis∣strict, and still less upon its agriculture; these
circumstances ren∣dered drawing up the Report, more difficult than it would
other∣wise have been. Mr. Young, in his Northern Tour, made several excursions
in the West Riding; but the time since elapsed, makes his work, however
valuable in other respects, of little use upon the present occasion. Mr.
Marshall's Treatise upon the York∣shire Husbandry, is almost wholly confined to
the East Riding. No other agricultural writings, relative to the district, have
come to our knowledge; but it is proper to acknowledge, that some infor∣mation
about the geographical and natural history of the Riding, is drawn from a
publication called Magna Britannia, as well as from the Histories of
Knaresborough and Halifax. We are also indebted to several respectable
individuals, for a variety of local information, which we gratefully
acknowledge.</P>
<P>As no interested motives can influence us upon this occasion, so
we hope the causes we have stated as obstacles to improve∣ments, and the
remedies we have suggested for removing them, will be impartially considered by
the inhabitants of the District; and if this Report in any shape contributes to
promote their pro∣sperity and happiness, we will account the time spent in
making the survey most beneficially employed.</P>

<PB REF="8"/>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE West Riding of Yorkshire is situated nearly in the centre of
the kingdom, and although an inland District, yet from its numerous rivers and
canals, it possesses all the advantages of a maritime province. It is 95 miles
in length, 48 in breadth, and 320 in circumference: contains 2,450 square
miles, or 1,568,000 statute acres, and about 400,000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>The West Riding is bounded on the East, by the river Ouse; on the
North, by the North Riding; on the West, by parts of Westmoreland, Lancashire,
and Cheshire; and on the South, by the counties of Nottingham and Derby. It is
divided into nine Wapentakes, or Hundreds, and contains 28 Market-towns, the
chief of which are Leeds, Sheffield, Wakefield, Halifax, Don∣caster, and
Rotheram, besides a very great number of populous villages.</P>
<P>The face of the country is in many parts strongly irregular. In
the western and northern divisions of the District, a consi∣derable portion is
hilly and mountainous; but in these situations, it is intersected with numerous
vales, carrying grass of the richest quality. The remainder is chiefly a flat,
with no more risings than serve to variegate the prospect. The whole District
is al∣most completely inclosed with stone dikes and hedges, which are kept in
the most perfect condition; and there are few open fields, except where the
ground is common or waste.</P>
<P>The nature and quality of the soil in this extensive District
differs materially. There are all sorts, from the deep strong clay, and rich
fertile loam, to the meanest peat earth. It is impossible to say, without an
actual mensuration, which particular kind most prevails. Vicinity to great
towns and superior culture have, no doubt, rendered a considerable part, that
was originally barren, fertile and productive. In general it may be said, that
a large moiety is of a quality naturally favourable to the purposes of 
<PB N="10" REF="9"/> husbandry; and under a proper system of management, will
amply repay the farmer for his trouble and expence.</P>
<P>The climate is, in general, moderate. In the eastern parts of the
Riding it is not esteemed so healthy, being subject to fogs and damps, from its
low situation. The harvest over the greatest part may be styled early,
commencing usually by the middle of August, and, except in backward seasons, is
finished by the end of September. In the western parts, which are upland and
hilly, the harvest is nearly a fortnight later than about Pontefract and
Doncaster; and, from their vicinity to the Irish Channel, a great deal more
rain falls than in the eastern parts of the Riding.</P>
<P>The West Riding is eminent for the number of its great and
navigable rivers. 1st. The Ouse, which takes th's name at York, being formerly
called the Eure, and in its course to the Humber receives all the other rivers
that run through the District; 2dly, The Don, or Dune, which is navigable
nearly to Sheffield, and of great advantage to the trade of that neighbourhood:
3dly, The Calder, which flows along the borders, betwixt this Riding and
Lancashire, and running east the country, falls into the Aire, five miles
beyond Wakefield: 4thly, The Aire, or Air, a large river issuing from the
mountain Penigent, which, with the aid of canals, is navigable to Leeds,
Bradford, and Skipton. This river holds on a long course quite across the
Riding, and falls into the Don near Snaith. 5thly, The Wharfe, which has its
rise at the foot of the Craven hills, and after a course of more than 50 miles
across the Riding, keeping a great way at an equal distance of 10 miles from
the Aire, discharges itself into the Ouse. Besides these principal ones, there
is a number of rivers of less importance.</P>
<P>The establishment of manufactures in the West Riding has been the
principal cause of its present wealth. It is difficult to ascertain the period
when they were first introduced, but there is reason to suppose, it was about
the beginning of the fifteenth century. Camden, in his Britannia, fixes the
introduction of manufactures to have been during the reigns of Henry the Eighth
and Edward the Sixth. This aera may, however, be suspected; <PB N="11" REF="10"/> for there is a copy of a court-roll, as we were informed, still
ex∣tant, dated at the court of the Prior of Lewes, held at Halifax on the
Thursday after the Feast of St. Thomas, 2 Henry the Fifth, 1414, wherein
Richard de Sunderland, and Joan his wife, surrender into the hands of the lord
of the manor, an inclosure at Halifax, called the <HI>Tenter Croft;</HI> which
is a strong presump∣tion that manufactures were carried on there before that
period.</P>
<P>The country chosen for carrying on these manufactures is
ad∣mirably adapted to that purpose. The raw materials are abun∣dant on every
hand; and coals, which are indispensably neces∣sary, are plentiful and cheap.
The ground in the vicinity of the manufacturing towns has in general been
originally barren, and in many parts little better than waste; but from the
great in∣crease of population, and the additional quantity of manure
oc∣casioned by the manufactures, the soil is now equal in value to that of
places originally more fertile.</P>
<P>It appears to us, that manufactures have had a sensible effect in
promoting agriculture in this District. By them a ready mar∣ket is afforded for
every particle of provisions that can be raised, without which agriculture must
always be feeble and languid. They have, no doubt, raised the rate of wages
considerably: this always follows of course, where trade prospers, and is a
sure sign of wealth; but they have at the same time raised the value of the
produce of land, which much more than enables the farmer to pay the increased
rate of wages.</P>
<P>From all the inquiries we could make, we did not find that the
effects of manufactures were detrimental to agriculture, by ren∣dering hands
scarce for carrying it on. In harvest the manufac∣turers generally leave their
looms, and assist in reaping the crop. We could not hear of any season but what
there were sufficient to answer the demand, except in 1792, at which time the
manu∣facturers had orders to an uncommon extent. Even then, this scarcity was
no further felt in the West Riding than by a great rise of wages; although we
were informed that in the East Rid∣ing a very heavy loss was sustained.</P>
<P>Having now given this short description of the West Riding 
<PB N="12" REF="11"/> of Yorkshire, it remains only in this place to add, that
it is by far the most valuable of the three Districts into which that County is
divided; and whether it is considered with respect to magnitude, fertility of
soil, local advantages, manufactures, or population, it will be found deserving
the most minute attention, and worthy to be ranked with any province in the
kingdom.</P>
<P>Without entering into a minute detail, for which we had col∣lected
the materials, should the Board at any time wish for it, we shall at present
restrict ourselves to the giving of a general view of the present state of this
important District, and of the ob∣stacles to, and the means of, its
improvement.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="part">
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>I. PRESENT STATE OF THE AGRICUL∣TURE OF THE DISTRICT.</HEAD>
<P>The husbandry of the West Riding differs so materially, that it is
absolutely necessary, before discussing its particular parts, to give a few
preliminary observations, tending to explain the re∣spective systems that
prevail in the several parts of that extensive District.</P>
<P>1st. There is the pasture lands, where grass is the chief object,
and where cultivation by the plough is only considered in a se∣condary
light.</P>
<P>The parts of the Riding where this system prevails, are at least
one third of the whole. From Ripley to the western extremity of the Riding,
almost all the good land is in grass; and where corn is raised, it is only upon
the inferior soils. During the time we were in that part of the country, we
hardly ever saw a plough; and a stack of corn was as great a rarity. Upon the
higher grounds, there are immense tracts of waste, which are generally common
among the contiguous possessors, and pastured by them with cattle and sheep.
Some of them are stinted pastures, but the greatest part are under no
limitations: the consequences of which are,—the grounds are oppressed,
the stock upon them starved, and little benefit derived from them by the
proprietors.</P>
<P>2dly. There are the lands adjoining to the manufacturing towns.
The greatest part of the ground is there occupied by persons who do not
consider farming as a business, but regard it only as a matter of convenience.
The manufacturer has his in∣closure, wherein he keeps milk cows for supporting
his family, and horses for carrying his goods to market, and bringing back raw
materials. This will apply to the greatest part of the land adjoining to the
manufacturing towns; and although much ground is not, in this case, kept under
the plough, yet compara∣tively more corn is raised, than in the division above
described.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/> 3dly. Those parts of the Riding where tillage
is principally attended to, and grass only considered as the mean of bringing
the corn husbandry to perfection.</P>
<P>If we run an imaginary line from Ripley southward by Leeds,
Wakefield, and Barnesley, to Rotheram, we may affirm, that the greatest part
eastward of it, till we come to the banks of the Ouse, which separates the West
from the East Riding, is princi∣pally employed in raising corn. About
Boroughbridge, We∣therby, Selby, &amp;c. there is about one half of the fields
under the plough. Further south, about Pontefract, Barnesley, and Ro∣theram,
there is two-thirds; and to the eastward of Doncaster, to Thorn and Snaith,
three-fourths of the land is managed in a similar way. There is not much waste
in this division, and what is in that situation, is capable of great
improvement.</P>
<P>4thly. The common fields. These are scattered over the whole of
the last division, but are most numerous in that part of the country to the
eastward of the great north road, from Doncaster to Boroughbridge. It is
impossible even to guess at the quan∣tity of land under this management. In
general, it may be said they are extensive, and from the natural good quality
of the soil, and the present imperfect state of culture, great room is afforded
for solid and substantial improvement being effected upon all land coming under
the description of common field.</P>
<P>5thly. The moors. These, besides the large tracts that abound in
the first division, mostly lie in the south-west parts of the Rid∣ing, above
Penneston and Sheffield. Upon them sheep are chiefly bred, and afterwards sold
to the graziers in the lower parts of the country. A great part of them is
common, which lays the proprietors under the same inconveniences as are already
pointed out; and which might easily be remedied, by dividing and ascertaining
the proportion which belongs to the respective proprietors.</P>
<P>Having finished this introductory sketch, we proceed to give a
comprehensive view of the result of our inquiries during the survey.</P>
<P><HI>Proprietors.</HI>—A considerable part of the landed
property of <PB N="15" REF="14"/> the West Riding is in the hands of small
freeholders and copy∣holders: but there are likewise a great number of
extensive pro∣prietors. Few of the latter reside upon their estates, at least
for a considerable part of the year; and the management of them is chiefly
devolved upon their stewards or factors.</P>
<P><HI>Size of farms.</HI>—A great majority of farms are
comparatively small, and there are very few of that size, which in some other
counties of the kingdom would be considered as large ones. The size varies so
much that it is not easy to fix upon an average. Upon the arable lands we heard
of none exceeding 300 acres, and for one of that extent, there are a dozen not
fifty. In the grass divi∣sion of the county, they are still smaller, and we
often heard the occupier of 100 acres styled a great farmer.</P>
<P><HI>Leases</HI>—The greatest part of the land is set without
lease; or, which is the same thing, the occupiers are removable upon six months
warning. The leases, which in the common accepta∣tion of the word can be
considered as such, are of different du∣rations, from 3 to 21 years; but
three-fourths of the Riding are possessed from year to year, and this practice,
which to us seems destructive of all good farming, is upon the increase. The
Duke of Norfolk, and several other proprietors, much to their honour, act
otherwise; and are convinced of the propriety of giving the farmer a security
of reaping the fruits of his improvements.</P>
<P>We shall, in another part of this work, endeavour to shew the
ruinous consequences to agriculture that proceed from giving no leases; and how
absurd it is to expect the ground is to be im∣proved by persons who may be
removed from their possessions whenever the proprietor, or, more properly
speaking, his steward, is disposed from whim or caprice to do so.</P>
<P><HI>Covenants</HI>—The covenants that prevail betwixt
landlord and tenant are many and various. We were favoured with copies of some
leases, and had opportunities of seeing others in the hands of the possessors.
We shall give an abstract of the clauses in some of them now lying before
us.</P>
<P>In one, the covenants are as follows.—The landlord sets the
ground for 10 years, and gives entry to the land on the 2d day 
<PB N="16" REF="15"/> of February, and to the houses upon the 12th of May: the
rent to be paid in equal portions, at the first terms of Whitsuntide and
Martinmas thereafter. Reserves the liberty of hunting and fishing on the
premises, and the property of all mines and quar∣ries, and the iron ore, coal,
lead, or other minerals contained in them. Reserves liberty to go into the
inclosures to cut and dig trees of all kinds, with access to carry them off.
The tenant obliges himself to pay all taxes, as well parliamentary, as other
ones already imposed, or to be imposed during the currency of the lease,
without defalcation from the rent. Obliges himself also to eat all his
<HI>bay</HI> and straw upon the premises, and to dung a part of his meadow
ground every year. Agrees not to plough any of his old pasture under a penalty
of £ 10. per acre, nor to have above one-fourth of his farm under the
plough at one time.</P>
<P>The lease also contains a great many clauses, about attending
courts, repairing fences, grinding malt and corn, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which
it is unnecessary to mention.</P>
<P>In another we observe the following conditions. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Restricted from ploughing any of the meadow or pasture
land.</ITEM>
<ITEM> Obliged to fallow the third part of the tillage land
annually, and to lay two chalders of lime upon every statute acre.</ITEM>
<ITEM> To pay all parliamentary and parochial taxes at present
ex∣isting, or that may be laid on during the currency of the lease.</ITEM>
<ITEM> To keep up all fences, roads, bridges, &amp;c. upon the
farm.</ITEM>
<ITEM> To pay the rent within twenty days after it becomes due,
under forfeiture of the lease.</ITEM>
<ITEM> To pay a penalty of £ 10. for every acre not managed
agreeable to the covenants, over and above the rent.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Conditions of a third lease. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Entry to the farm at Candlemas.</ITEM>
<ITEM> Rent payable at Whitsuntide and Martinmas
thereafter.</ITEM>
<ITEM> No <HI>bay</HI> or straw to be sold.</ITEM>
<ITEM> No meadow or pasture to be ploughed without consent of the
proprietor.</ITEM>
<ITEM> When land is sown down for grass, to be done with 12
bushels of fine hay seeds and 4lbs. of Dutch white clover per acre.</ITEM>
<ITEM> <PB N="17" REF="16"/> Tenant removable at 6 months
warning.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In other leases we saw, the tenant is expressly prohibited from
breaking up all grass lands that have lain 6 years, which renders the situation
of the pasture and meadow fields as immutable at the laws of Media and Persia
were of old. In short, the very nature of most of the subsisting covenants are
destructive to im∣provements; and, as it is well said in the Journal by Mr.
Potter, at Tadcaster—<Q REND="inline">"A good farmer will manage much better want∣ing
them, and as for a bad farmer, they never will mend him."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Rent.</HI>—It is difficult for us to say what may be the
real rent of land. We could not, with propriety, push the farmer upon this
point, when he was ignorant what use we were to make of his answer; and even
where we got sufficient information of what was paid the landlord, we found
there was a long train of public burthens, over and above, which were not
easily computed. There is, in the first place, the land tax, which is uniformly
paid by the tenant, and generally amounts to 1 <HI>s.</HI> per pound upon the
real rent. 2dly. The tithes, which are levied in so many various ways, that it
is impossible to say what proportion they bear to the pound rent, much
depending upon the actual state of the farm, and not a little upon the
character and disposition of the drawer. Upon arable lands, where they are
annually valued, the payment in money may be from 5 to 8 <HI>s.</HI> per acre,
in some cases more. 3dly. The roads, the expence of which to the tenant is
about £ 7. per cent. upon the rent. 4thly. The poors rates, for which no
fixed sum can be set down. The lowest we heard of was 18 <HI>d.</HI> in the
pound; and the highest 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.;</HI> but from the very nature of
the tax they are continually fluctuating. 5thly. The church and constables
dues, which are about 1 <HI>s.</HI> in the pound.—From all these things
it may be supposed, that in many places the sums payable by the farmer to the
church, the public, and the poor, are nearly as great as the nominal rent paid
to the landlord. It will appear surprising to many, that rents are higher for
grass fields than for those under the plough. This is however actually the
case, and we account for it in the following manner. When in grass, few or no
tithes <PB N="18" REF="17"/> are paid, at least the burthen is comparatively
light. The want of leases, and the restrictions do not operate half so severely
upon the grazier as upon the corn farmer. The grass farmer has few improvements
to make; he goes on in the same course from year to year; and the want of a
lease, though it keeps him from the certainty of possession, yet does not hurt
him so far as to cramp his operations. At Settle and Skipton, we found land let
so high as 40 <HI>s.</HI> and 50 <HI>s.</HI> per acre, while, from the best
accounts we could receive in the corn country, 20 <HI>s.</HI> and 30
<HI>s.</HI> was considered as a high rent, and in many places it is much
lower.</P>
<P><HI>Tithes.</HI>—This is a most important subject, which we
shall af∣terwards have occasion to mention. At present it is only necessary to
observe, that they are collected in various ways. In some parts, the small
tithes are only drawn in kind, and a modus is taken in lieu of the great ones.
In other parts, it is the custom for the tithe-owner to send a person before
harvest to value the tithes in the parish, and afterwards to deliver an
estimate of their va∣lue to the farmer, giving him the alternative of paying
that sum (which for various reasons is generally agreed to), or having the
tithes drawn in kind.</P>
<P><HI>Poors Rates.</HI>—This is another burthen upon the
farmer, which has of late greatly increased. In a country, such as the West
Riding of Yorkshire, where employment abounds for per∣sons of all ages, and
even for children who are able to do any thing, it excites great surprise that
the poor should be so nu∣merous, and the rates so excessive. The subject is
important, and well deserves the attention of those concerned. As for our
parts, we do not pretend to understand the laws by which the support of the
poor is regulated, nor have we the least knowledge upon what system the
workhouses are kept. We have heard of workhouses in Norfolk, and other parts of
the kingdom, that, un∣der proper management, have either supported, or nearly
sup∣ported themselves. We feel very sensibly for the infirmities of old age,
and are fully of opinion that due attention ought to be paid to the distresses
of our fellow-creatures who are unable to sup∣port themselves. This is a
Christian duty, and ought never to <PB N="19" REF="18"/> be forgotten. But we
have reason to suspect the provident support held out by the poors laws, is
often the cause of making the lower ranks more thoughtless and extravagant in
the days of health and strength than they would otherwise be. Holding out large
funds is the sure way to increase the number of the poor. We speak from our
personal knowledge, when we say, that in the northern parts of the island,
where employment is not only scarce, but wages not half so great, the lower
ranks, by being temperate and frugal, well bring up large families, and are
very seldom a bur∣then upon the parish where they reside. We know of country
parishes where the number of souls is near 2,000, and the rental of the ground
more than £ 4,000, where the annual charge of the poor does not exceed
£ 50; and of this sum not one half falls upon the land, as it is mostly
collected on Sunday at the church doors. In Scotland there is no law against
settlements; no restrictions against building cottages wherever a man can
pro∣cure ground to build upon, nor no bars thrown in the way of common people
marrying; and yet the number of poor, who are a burthen upon the parishes, is
comparatively small. From these things there are reasons for concluding, that
the English poor laws stand much in need of revision; and that the laws against
settlements, and building cottages, have not prevented the increase of the
poor, but are only detrimental to sound morality and real religion.</P>
<P><HI>Rotation of Crops.</HI>—There are many rotations of
crops adopted, but the one most generally practised is turnips, barley, clover,
wheat. Where the turnips are properly cleaned, a better one cannot be followed,
upon all soils fit for this rotation. But this succession of crops also takes
place upon much land that cannot be farmed in this manner to advantage. Upon
other lands, where only two crops are allowed to a fallow, wheat and beans, or
wheat and oats are generally the crops. In the western parts of the Riding,
oats is the principal crop, which is indeed very proper, so long as the plough
is confined to the higher grounds.</P>
<P>The grasses that are cultivated are red clover, when it is to be 
<PB N="20" REF="19"/> followed with wheat, and white clover and hay seeds for
pasture. Sometimes hay seeds are sown by themselves, and a good deal of
sainfoine is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Tadcaster and Ferrybridge. As
for the old rich pastures about Skipton, Settle, and other places, it is not
easy to say, what they have originally been sown with. There appears, among
other grasses, a great quantity of what is usually called honeysuckle grass,
which we suppose to be the same plant sold under the name of <HI>cow-grass</HI>
by the London seedsmen. Most of the vale of Skipton has been 50 years in the
same situation as at present; and the proprietors do not seem anxious for
changing it. The quantity of hay seeds sown upon an acre is very great; no less
than three-quarters. Probably some people may sow less; but we had accounts
from some very judicious farmers that the above, when sown with 18lbs. white
Dutch clover, afforded them the best pasture. In∣deed none of them can say what
these hay seeds are; they may be weeds, or other noxious trumpery; this they
could not ex∣plain.</P>
<P>There is very little rye-grass sown. The people in general have a
mortal aversion to it; and the clover crops, from a want of this mixture make
exceeding bad hay. The old pastures are therefore frequently cut, which makes a
hay of great repute, and is generally used over the whole Riding.</P>
<P><HI>Turnips.</HI>—Although the turnip husbandry prevails
over a great part of the Riding, yet the proper cultivation of them is not
attended to so carefully as it ought. Except by a few indi∣viduals, they are
universally sown broad-cast, and most imper∣fectly cleaned. We understand that
it is not much more than twenty years since they were hoed at all; and that the
intro∣duction of this most necessary practice, was principally owing to the
indefatigable exertions of that truly patriotic nobleman the late Marquis of
Rockingham. It may readily be supposed that a people, who so lately thought
hoeing unnecessary, will still think an imperfect hoeing sufficient, which we
are sorry to say is too much the case. Indeed it is only by drilling and
horse∣hoeing that large fields of turnips can be kept in proper order, 
<PB N="21" REF="20"/> at a moderate expence. We saw some fields very well
dressed, and carrying good crops, particularly upon Mr. Beaumont's estate near
Wakefield, in the neighbourhood of Rotheram; and at Snaith; but the greater
number were full of weeds, in some places too thick, in others very blanky, and
would not be considered as half a crop, where the management of turnips is well
understood.</P>
<P><HI>Rape, or Cole-seed.</HI>—It did not appear to us that
rape was much cultivated in any part of the West Riding; and it is only on the
eastern parts that any quantity is sown at all. It is raised both for feeding
sheep, and upon account of the value of the seed; al∣though we apprehend, in
the last case, it will be found a very scourging crop. There are two ways in
which it is consumed by sheep; first, by sowing it in July, and feeding it off
both before winter, and again in the spring, in which method it is an
excel∣lent preparation for barley; secondly, it is sown upon the wheat stubbles
that are next season intended for turnips. The land is ploughed as soon as the
wheat crop is got off, which is usually before the end of August, and it is
eaten in spring, previous to working the turnip land. Both these modes are
excellent, and deserve imitation. When rape is intended for seed, it is sown
about the 1st of August, upon land fallowed and dunged. It is cut in the month
of July thereafter, by which means it remains near a whole year on the
ground.</P>
<P><HI>Winter Tares.</HI>—Tares are sown in many places,
particularly about Sheffield and Rotheram; and are excellent spring food for
horses before the clover crops are ready. They are sown from September to the
1st of November, and by being cut in April and May, afford sufficient time to
prepare the ground for turnips. As they are found to answer so well, we cannot
but recommend the cultivation of them, upon all rich warm soils, the
mainte∣nance of horses being at that time particularly expensive.</P>
<P><HI>Flax.</HI>—Considerable quantities of flax are raised in
that part of the Riding next the river Ouse, which is a very proper soil for
it. We were favoured with a list of the claims given in this year to the clerk
of the peace for the West Riding, from which it ap∣pears, that the bounty
allowed by parliament for encouraging <PB N="22" REF="21"/> the growth of flax,
is claimed for no less a quantity than 59,000 stones. Upon a proper soil,
nothing will pay the farmer better than flax; and if care and attention are
bestowed on the pulling of it, and due pains afterwards used to the scutching
and clean∣ing, there is no doubt but flax of as good quality may be raised at
home, as what is imported from the Baltic, or Holland.</P>
<P><HI>Inclosures.</HI>—Almost the whole of the West Riding is
in∣closed, except the common fields and moors; and too much praise cannot be
bestowed upon the perfect state in which the fences are kept. The inclosures
are, however, generally too small, at least for corn-fields, and are the means
of wasting a great part of the land. It did not appear to us, that either the
conveniency of water, or uniformity of soil had been much studied in planning
them out. The advantages of inclosing are great and manifold. The rent to the
landlord is immediately raised at least one-fourth; and how could this be paid
if more corn and grass were not pro∣duced than by open field management? They
enable the farmer to practise a more improved system, by introducing the grass
husbandry in all its perfection; and the improvement of all kinds of stock is
necessarily great.</P>
<P>We often asked the question, Does inclosing decrease popula∣tion?
and were uniformly answered, that it certainly increased it. Can it even be
supposed, that a practice which enables the farmer to pay more to his landlord,
which is the means of increasing food both for man and beast, will ever lessen
the number of the people. It affords employment for additional hands, from the
great increase of labour necessarily required by this improved system, which
must consequently tend to augment population. These things are so obvious to
every person acquainted with the subject, or who will take the trouble to
examine the present state of the common fields and wastes, that we would hardly
have mentioned them, if some popular writers, particularly the late Dr. Price,
had not attempted to shew that the number of the people in this island was
decreased, and assigned inclosing as the principal cause:</P>
<P><HI>Farm Houses, and Offices.</HI>—The greatest part of
these are <PB N="23" REF="22"/> very inconveniently situated, being generally
crowded into town∣ships or villages, and not upon the fields the farmer has to
culti∣vate. It is sufficiently plain, that the nearer the farmer is to his
fields, the more work he will perform, and at less expence.</P>
<P>This has lately been more attended to than formerly, but great
room is still left for further improvement in this respect. As no∣thing tends
more to promote the happiness and comfort of the farmer than by having his
farmstead properly constructed, and conveniently situated, we shall here take
the liberty to throw out our opinion on the subject.</P>
<P>The farm house and offices should be placed, as near as pos∣sible,
in the centre of the farm, provided good water can be had in plenty, which
always ought to be first inquired after. The farm-yard, or fold-yard, should be
a long square, proportioned to the size of the farm, and the number of
buildings intended to be erected. The dwelling house should stand at one of the
ends of the yard, fronting the south; the barns upon the west side; the stables
and byres upon the east; and sheds, &amp;c. on the north side, for holding
husbandry utensils. This affords complete con∣veniences of all kinds; and keeps
every thing within the reach and sight of the farmer, which is an object of
great importance; and the yard, by being inclosed on all sides, keeps the dung
in a proper state for fermenting, and affords shelter to whatever cattle may be
wintered there.</P>
<P>We do not admire the large barns we saw at several places,
particularly those of Messrs. Walkers, at Rotheram, and Mr. Drummond, at
Baubey, which are liker churches than barns. The building such edifices at
first is very expensive; and the interest of the money originally laid out,
when added to the sums re∣quired for keeping them in repair, must be great;
while at the same time, they are productive of no real good to the farmer.</P>
<P>We are clearly of opinion, that corn can never be kept so well in
a house, as when properly built and stacked in a yard. It will always be found
healthier and drier in that case, than when kept long in the house, which it
must necessarily be, wherever large barns are used: besides, in backward
seasons, corn can be <PB N="24" REF="23"/> got much sooner ready for the stack
than the barn; and it is an important article in the economy of farming, to
have corn as soon out of danger as possible.</P>
<P>It is said, housing of corn saves expence: this we doubt. It will
take as many people to put it into the barn, in harvest, as af∣terwards; and
the difference of expence betwixt harvest and common wages, will build it in
the yard. At any rate, the ex∣pence of the barns, and the danger of the corn
turning mouldy in them, far more than exceeds every possible advantage, that
can be derived from this practice.</P>
<P>We do not think corn, in the yard, can be built more easy and
convenient than in round stacks. These may be made of any size, and from their
shape and construction, they allow air to pe∣netrate into the heart with
greater facility, than when built in the present form. We thought much
unnecessary trouble was be∣stowed upon heading and covering both hay and corn
stacks, over the whole Riding. The straw is laid on in very great quan∣tities,
and with as much accuracy, as if it were thatched for a dwelling house. As for
the roping, it is as strongly applied, as if the stacks were to stand twenty
years. We are far from con∣demning these practices, merely because they are
accurate; corn ought always to be properly secured; but we think them a
wast∣ing of labour and expence, and that the corn would be as well defended
from the weather, if half the trouble was saved.</P>
<P><HI>Cottages.</HI>—There is a very great want of dwelling
houses for husbandmen and labourers; and this deficiency may be traced to the
poors laws for its source. The farmer, from a dread of heavier rates falling
upon him, keeps as few houses as possible; and hence, almost the whole of farm
servants are young, unmar∣ried men, who have board in the house; while those
that are styled day-labourers, reside in the villages. This practice is very
troublesome to the farmer: it decreases the number of people employed in
husbandry; and has, for its certain attendant, a great rise of wages.</P>
<P>We venture to recommend, that proper houses should be built for
farm servants, contiguous to every homestead. This will <PB N="25" REF="24"/>
not only promote the welfare and happiness of that class of men, by giving them
an opportunity of settling in life, which is not at present an easy matter, but
will also be highly beneficial to the farmer himself, as he will at all times
have hands within his own bounds, for carrying on his labour; and have them of
that de∣scription, that are generally esteemed most regular and careful.</P>
<P><HI>Wages.</HI>—This is an important article to every corn
farmer in the West Riding, as wages, for these some years past, have greatly
increased. We suppose the wages of a house servant (of which kind, as already
said, most of the ploughmen are) may be estimated from £. 25 to £.
30 a year, including maintenance. There is a practice which prevails over a
considerable part of this district, of giving them drink both forenoon and
afternoon, be the work what it will; which is a ridiculous custom, and ought to
be abolished without loss of time. What can be more absurd, than to see a
ploughman stopping his horses half an hour, in a cold winter day, to drink ale?
We suspect the practice is so deep rooted, that it will not be easily removed
without a compensation. This ought to be done at once, as being, like the
tythes, an en∣couragement to idleness; and, from wasting much time, a great
obstruction to improvements.</P>
<P><HI>Provisions</HI>—are abundant over the whole Riding,
though from the extensive demand from the manufacturing towns, they are high in
price. Butcher's meat, upon an average, is about 4 <HI>d.</HI> per pound, but
often more during the spring, and early summer months. The corn markets are
full as high as in any part of the island; there not being any thing like a
sufficient quantity raised within the Riding for the consumption of its
in∣habitants. In the grazing parts, where very little corn is grown, they are
supplied from places at a distance, which no doubt causes a considerable
increase in the price. Potatoes are in abundance, though very inferior in
quality. The cheapest articles of provi∣sions, are poultry. For which, reasons
might be easily as∣signed.</P>
<P><HI>Fuel.</HI>—This most necessary article is plenty, and
compara∣tively cheap. In those parts, where any scarcity exists, they can 
<PB N="26" REF="25"/> be supplied without any material inconvenience, by means
of those numerous navigable rivers and canals that intersect the whole
country.</P>
<P><HI>Woods.</HI>—There is a great deal of oak and ash wood
grown in the West Riding, which meets with a ready market at the ship∣ping and
manufacturing towns. The woods appear to be under a very proper system of
management, which will be seen from a paper relative to them in the Appendix.
There are also large quantities of logs and deals imported from the Baltic,
which at a future period, might be rendered unnecessary, if Scotch firs, and
larches, were planted upon the waste grounds.</P>
<P><HI>Manures.</HI>—This is a subject, that deserves
particular atten∣tion, as it is upon the solid foundation of manuring, that
every good system of husbandry must be built.</P>
<P>The manures used in the West Riding, besides those generally used
in other parts of the kingdom, are, bones, horn shavings, and rape dust; and
from the accounts we received, their effects are highly beneficial. With regard
to the lime husbandry and the collection, and application of home made dung, we
are of opinion that the present practice is very faulty, and defective. As this
is an important subject, we will give our opinion upon it at some length.</P>
<P>1st. In the pasture parts of the country, the hay is consumed upon
the field, and from its being thrown indiscriminately upon the ground, the dung
may be said to be in great measure lost, at least the value of it is much
reduced in comparison to what it would be, if the hay was eaten at home in the
house, or the yard; and the dung carefully collected together in a heap, so as
fermen∣tation might properly take place. We decidedly condemn the eating hay in
the field, as occasioning great waste of that necessary article, independant of
the loss sustained by the improper appli∣cation of the dung.</P>
<P>2dly. The home made dung, in the above parts of the country, is
generally laid upon the rich pasture fields, which have been cut that season
for hay, and not upon the tillage lands. We have doubts, whether dung can ever
be applied with equal propriety, <PB N="27" REF="26"/> as upon well wrought
fallows. If the dung exceeds the quantity necessary for the fallows, which in
few situations will be the case, it ought to be laid upon other parts of the
farm, which are under the plough, and not upon the grass fields, which when
properly laid down, will sufficiently improve themselves. These observa∣tions
apply to those parts of the Riding, that are first described in the
introductory sketch to this result.</P>
<P>In the corn districts, dung is applied with more judgment, it
being generally laid upon the fallow or turnip brick or break, though even
there it is sometimes laid upon the grass. We are of opinion, a great deal more
dung might be accumulated, if the stubbles were cut lower, than is presently
done. Barley and oats are generally cut with the scythe, which so far obviates
this argument; but wheat, which is the prevailing crop, is always cut with the
sickle.</P>
<P>From not seeing the crops upon the ground we cannot say to a
certainty, what proportion of the stubbles might be left. But from a careful
examination of the stubbles we suppose it at least one-third. This not only
occasions a great loss of grain, as all the straggling heads are thereby left,
but also deprives the farmer of a large portion of home manure,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Some time ago, an experiment was made in East Lothian to
ascertain the difference betwixt high and low cutting. Four ridges of wheat
were cut, which were of equal length and breadth, and apparently the same in
quality. Two of them were cut close by the ground, and the other two
con∣siderably higher, though not so high as in many places of the West Riding.
The measure of each two ridges was a very trifle more than a quarter of a
Scotch acre, which is one-fifth more than the English statute measure. The low
cutting was done by 8 shearers in 1 hour 24 minutes: the high cutting in 48
minutes by the same hands. The wheat was threshed separately, and the corn and
straw measured and carefully weighed.</P>

upon <PB N="28" REF="27"/> the field, will never ferment, it is therefore of no
use to enrich the ground, and occasions great inconvenience, when the land is
ploughed down.</P>
<P>The farmer is also often deprived of a due quantity of dung, by
keeping too many cattle. We venture to lay it down as a rule, that no greater
number should be kept, than is necessary to reduce the straw to putrefaction.
When more are kept, although the quality of the dung may be improved, yet the
quantity is curtailed.</P>
<P>The lime husbandry seems to us to be practiced upon very im∣proper
principles. Whenever we speak against the general prac∣tice, we wish to be
diffident; but we are so much dissatisfied with the manner in which lime is
applied, that we cannot refrain from expressing our sentiments upon it.</P>
<P>The farmer is too often obliged, by the covenants subsist∣ing
between him and his landlord, to throw lime upon land, where, in the real sense
of the word, it is truly thrown away. It must appear exceedingly absurd to any
person, who knows the manner in which lime operates, and the number of years
its effects continue, that the farmer should be obliged to lime his land every
third year, whether it needs it or not. This is in effect done by every lease,
where two crops are only allowed to a fallow, and where it is covenanted to lay
lime upon that fallow. The specified quantity is in many cases so small, being
sometimes one chalder, or a chalder and a half, that it never can produce
effects adequate to the expence, or indeed any expence at all. It may be said,
that by frequently laying on small quantities, that a suf∣ficient dose is given
at last. This argument is plausible, but it <PB N="29" REF="28"/> should be
remembered, that the effects of the first partial liming, is probably wore off,
before the second comes to its assistance; and that if the first is stimulating
and fermenting the land, the second is only a prodigal waste of expence.</P>
<P>But why oblige the farmer to lay lime upon his land at all? If it
be for his interest, he will do it without any obligatory clause in his lease;
if it is not for his interest, a burden is laid on his shoulders, that can give
benefit to none. It is surprising, pro∣prietors should insist upon this; for
lime has never been under∣stood to improve the <HI>real</HI> value of the soil,
but is generally con∣sidered as a stimulus, or used to procure a temporary
exertion.</P>
<P>We were particularly anxious to ascertain the quantity of lime
laid upon an acre, and we found it to be, in different places, from 1 chalder,
or 32 bushels, to 100 bushels. Some people may use rather more, but from 60 to
70 bushels per acre, may be regarded as an average; a quantity very inadequate,
in our humble opi∣nion, to the intended purpose.</P>
<P>Lime, in the West Riding, is principally applied to fallow, and
spread upon the ground immediately before the last ploughing. We judge, unless
in some particular situations, it would be used with greater advantage upon the
grass fields. For instance, in∣stead of laying it upon the fallow, preparatory
to turnips, or upon the clean summer fallow, let it be laid upon the clover
crop, which is the third of the usual sequence; or, upon the pasture lands,
previous to breaking them up for corn. The land is ge∣nerally at that time in a
situation proper for the operation of lime, and it can be applied at different
periods, with less trouble and inconvenience to the farmer.</P>
<P><HI>Watering or floating land.</HI>—In many parts,
especially in the manufacturing district, great improvement is made upon the
grass fields, by watering or floating them. Mr. Walker, at Crow∣nest, is the
most particular in this respect, and has his water so admirably disposed, that
he can float the greatest part of his fields, whenever he thinks convenient. We
do not pretend to be acquainted with this branch of husbandry; but in some
places, we were told, its advantages were equal to a top dressing of
manure.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29"/> <HI>Draining.</HI>—This most useful
practice ought never to be neglected by the farmer; as where the nature of the
soil, and si∣tuation of the ground requires it, no money can be so
advanta∣geously expended. In our survey of the West Riding, we found draining
was assiduously attended to, in many places; but that in others, it was either
totally neglected, or imperfectly per∣formed: in particular, that useful
measure of clearing out the water furrows, upon the tillage fields, which is
absolutely neces∣sary upon most soils, was very negligently executed. As soon
as possible after a field is either ploughed or sown, the whole furrow along
the end of the field, betwixt and the headridge, to∣gether with such parts of
the field itself, where the water, from want of level, cannot get off, should
be digged of a proper depth, and perfectly cleaned out. This lays the field in
such a situa∣tion, that the greatest falls of rain run off immediately; and a
due attention to this practice, constitutes, in a material manner, the
difference betwixt the good and the bad farmer.</P>
<P>Hollow drains are filled up in various ways. In some places the
shoulder drain prevails. This is done by digging the bottom of the drain
narrower than the top, and covering it with the sur∣face sod, which may do in
some cases where the sward is strong, but never can be fully depended upon.
Where they are filled with stones, sometimes the largest are set upon their
edge cast∣ing inwards, till they join, which leaves a small vacuity for the
water running, and they are then filled up with small stones. In other places
this is done with bricks; but where plenty of mate∣rials allow it, we never
could discern a more efficacious method of filling drains, than by doing it
with round land stones thrown in indiscriminately, which, if care is taken that
no earth is mix∣ed amongst them, and the top well covered with straw before
they are filled up, will run longer, and be less liable to interrup∣tion than
when a vacuity is left by either setting the first stones upon their edge, or
by walling the sides, and covering with flat stones, and at the same time is
considerably cheaper.</P>
<P><HI>Paring and Burning.</HI>—Our information on this head,
was various and contradictory. In some places, the practice is pro∣hibited, 
<PB N="31" REF="30"/> unless with the consent of the proprietor. In others, it
is deemed the best method for breaking up all grass grounds, and is not
supposed to waste the soil in any shape. Our opinion is, that upon some
grounds, paring and burning may be good management, particularly upon rough
coarse sward, which cannot otherwise be easily brought into a proper state of
cultivation. But that upon the whole, it is a practice that should be gently
used, as it tends in a material degree to exhaust and impoverish the soil. The
expence of paring and burning of land with spread∣ing the ashes, is from 18
<HI>s.</HI> to 24 <HI>s.</HI> per acre.</P>
<P><HI>Horses.</HI>—There are not many horses bred, except in
the eastern parts of the Riding. The size of those employed in the western
parts, is generally small; but they are hardy, and capa∣ble of great fatigue.
In other parts of the Riding, they are large, and sufficiently able for any
field operations. Those used in the waggons are strong and well made.</P>
<P><HI>Cattle.</HI>—The stock of cattle may be classed under
four dif∣ferent heads. There is the short horned kind, which principally
prevail in the east side of the Riding, and are distinguished by the names of
the Durham, Holderness, or Dutch breeds. There is the long horned or Craven
breed, which are both bred and fed in the western parts, and also brought from
the neigh∣bouring county of Lancashire. These are a hardy sort of cattle, and
constitutionally disposed to undergo the vicissitudes of a wet and precarious
climate. There is another breed which appears to be a cross from the two
already mentioned, and which we esteem the best of all. A great number of milk
cows of this sort are kept in Nidderdale and the adjacent country, which are
both useful and handsome. They are perhaps not altogether such good milkers, as
the Holderness cows, but they are much har∣dier, and easier maintained. They
are, at the same time, sooner made ready for the butcher, and are generally in
good order and condition, even when milked. Beside these, there are immense
numbers of Scotch cattle brought into the country, which after being fed for
one year, and sometimes two, are sold to the butcher. Beef of this kind always
sells higher in the market, than that of <PB N="32" REF="31"/> the native breed;
and from the extent of population, there is a constant demand for all that can
be fed.</P>
<P><HI>Sheep.</HI>—There are so many kinds of sheep, both bred
and fed, and they have been so often crossed, that it is not easy to de∣scribe
them. The sheep bred upon the moors in the western part of the Riding, and
which, we presume, are the native breed, are horned, light in the fore quarter,
and well made for exploring a hilly country, where there is little to feed
them, but heath and ling; these are generally called the Peniston breed, from
the name of the market town, where they are sold. When fat they will weigh from
14 lb. to 15 lb. per quarter. They are a hardy kind of sheep, and good
thrivers. When brought down, at a proper age, to the pastures in the low parts
of the country, they feed as cleverly, and are as rich mutton as need be. We
suppose crossing ewes of this sort with a Bakewell ram, would pro∣duce an
excellent breed for the low country pastures, as the Bake∣well kind have
exactly the properties, that the Peniston wants.</P>
<P>There are great quantities of Scotch sheep from Teviotdale,
&amp;c. fed in the country; numbers of ewes are also brought annually from
Northumberland, which, after taking their lambs, are fed that season for the
butcher. Many two years old of this kind are also fed upon turnips; and in the
southern parts there are a good many of the flat ribbed, Lincolnshire sheep,
which are ugly beyond description.</P>
<P>Upon the waste commons, scattered up and down the Riding, the kind
of sheep bred, are the most miserable that can be ima∣gined. As they generally
belong to poor people, and are mostly in small lots, they never can be
improved. This will apply to the whole of the sheep kept upon the commons, that
are not stinted; the numbers that are put on beggar and starve the whole stock.
In many parts of the Riding, a superior attention is now beginning to be paid
to this useful animal, by selecting rams of the best properties, and breeds;
which, it is to be hoped, will be more and more attended to.</P>
<P><HI>Wool.</HI>—From the extent of the woollen manufactory in
the Riding, it may be necessarily supposed, there is a constant de∣mand 
<PB N="33" REF="32"/> for wool of all sorts. Prices, however, owing to the
stag∣nation of trade, have decreased considerably this season. From the best
information we could procure, it has fallen from 15 to 25 per cent.; and good
wool may now be purchased at 7 <HI>d.</HI> and 8 <HI>d.</HI> per-pound
averdupois weight.</P>
<P><HI>Common Fields.</HI>—The system under which that part of
the Riding, composed of common fields, is managed, cries out for immediate
improvement. It has been already said, in the intro∣ductory sketch, that these
fields are numerous and extensive; and that the husbandry practised upon them
is uniformly bad. Hence land rises in value the moment it is divided, and free
scope al∣lowed to the genius and talents of the farmer. They are gene∣rally of
the best soil, and yet from what we learned, they carried the worst crops.
Every hour lost in accomplishing a division of them, brings a loss upon the
public greater than can be esti∣mated.</P>
<P><HI>Waste Lands.</HI>—A considerable part of the West Riding
is waste land and moor. It may appear rash to guess at the pro∣portion, but we
think it may be computed at one-sixth part of the whole. The quantity is
lessening every day, as inclosure bills are frequently passed for that purpose;
but still a great deal remains to be done. There are many parts of these wastes
capa∣ble of great improvement, if divided and inclosed. But the far greatest
part would not repay the expence of inclosing; at same time it is our opinion,
that larches and Scots firs would thrive in many situations. Wood of these
kinds is much wanted, and we apprehend, would pay the proprietor well, and
contribute to the public convenience. At any rate, as the wastes are mostly
com∣mon, the proportion belonging to each proprietor ought to be as∣certained,
which would enable him to improve his share in the manner he may see most
advantageous.</P>
<P><HI>Ploughs and Carts.</HI>—In nothing are the farmers of
the West Riding more deficient, than in the construction and ma∣nagement of
their ploughs and wheel carriages. These are essen∣tial articles in the
practice of husbandry, and are generally most perfect where the best farming
prevails.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33"/> The same plough, with a few trifling
alterations, is univer∣sally used over the whole district: it is generally
called the Dutch, or Rotheram plough; and was first made by a Mr. Jo∣seph
Foljambe, about 70 years ago, who got a patent for it. The fault of this plough
lies more in the manner it is yoked, than in the principles upon which it is
made. The practice of yoking horses in a line, which prevails over a
considerable part of the district, renders it necessary, when putting in the
beam, to turn it considerably to the furrow, in order to give the plough what
is technically called <HI>land.</HI> Owing to this, the horses draw in a
contrary direction to the share and coulter, which conse∣quently makes the
plough go very unsteady; and from the dif∣ference betwixt the direction of the
draught, and the head upon which the share is fixed, the force of the
resistance must neces∣sarily be increased.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the necessity of turning the beam towards the
furrow is entirely owing to the yoking horses in a line, yet so forcible is
custom, that even when horses draw abreast, the ploughs have all, more or less,
of this crooked beam. We ob∣served that the sock or share is much shorter and
broader in the point than those we are accustomed with, which must make them
difficult to work in all gravelly soils, and even in clays, when they are
dry.</P>
<P>The half of the mould board is of cast metal; the upper half is
wood, which is very proper, as it is only the under side that wastes with the
work.</P>
<P>The prevailing practice over more than one half of the dis∣trict,
of yoking horses in a line, is truly absurd. A horse never works so easy, nor
draws so fair, as when going abreast, or in pairs. If land is in that
situation, as not to bear a horse upon the unploughed part, it is unfit for
labouring, and ought not to be touched. But this cannot be sustained as a
reason for this prac∣tice, for we repeatedly saw three horses in a line,
sometimes four, ploughing tender clover leys. Every person knows the power of
old customs and prejudices, and we can only assign this for such an absurd
practice.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34"/> We apprehend every part of plough work may be
accomplished by two horses, if they are of sufficient strength, and properly
maintained. We speak from what we see daily done on our own farms, and those of
our neighbours; where land, fully as strong as any we saw in Yorkshire, is
constantly ploughed with two horses, and the furrow generally taken deeper.
There is no ques∣tion, but where the land is hard and stiff, so much cannot be
done in a given time, as upon lighter soils. But this argument will have the
same weight, whatever number of horses are yoked. All we contend for is, that
two good horses yoked abreast in a plough, properly constructed, are able to
labour any ground, when it is in a proper situation for being wrought.</P>
<P>It is proper to notice, that owing, as we suppose, to ploughing in
a line, the work is often very badly performed. There is scarcely a straight
ridge to be seen, except in a very few places. The land is generally kept too
flat; nor being properly accli∣vated to defend it against the winter rains; we
observed this par∣ticularly betwixt Thorn and Snaith, where, notwithstanding
the soil is upon a wet bottom, yet the ridges are narrow, and not raised at
all. At the same time the land near these places, was full straighter, and
neater ploughed, than any we had seen.</P>
<P>We often remarked in the course of our survey, that the land was
in general ploughed too shallow, which not only curtails the pasture of the
plants, but also exposes them to be hurt by drought in one season, and drenched
by moisture in another. We would lay it down as a rule, never to be departed
from, that all land ought to be ploughed in direct proportion to its depth, and
that where the soil will admit, it ought to be done substan∣tially.</P>
<P><HI>Farm Carriages.</HI>—These are carts and waggons of
various sizes. The carts, in general, are badly proportioned, being too long in
the body, and straight; which makes them heavy upon the back of the horse in
going down hill, and the contrary ex∣treme in going up. They are difficult to
unload when driving out dung, or performing any home work, and often the sides
fold inward, in place of casting out to the wheel, which makes them 
<PB N="36" REF="35"/> hold much less than they would otherwise do. They are
drawn by two, three, and four horses, and are very unhandy about a farm. The
waggons are both upon broad and narrow wheels; they are destructive to the
roads, and, in our opinion, of no ad∣vantage in carrying on the work of the
husbandman.</P>
<P>We suppose, that a cart much shorter, and at same time broader,
with sides throwing out, and of a size to be drawn by two horses, is a much
better machine for the farmer than the one presently used. If a person will
attentively consider the unequal manner in which horses do work, they will soon
be convinced of the impropriety of yoking too many together. We think, the
lighter the cart, and the fewer the horses, the more will propor∣tionally be
drawn; at same time, a great saving is afforded in the important articles of
<HI>tear</HI> and <HI>wear.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oxen.</HI>—Very few oxen are wrought in the West Riding;
and these only upon the farms of landed proprietors. We know working of oxen is
a popular topic; but, from what we could learn upon this subject, the practice
is not likely to become ge∣neral. From their being almost universally given up,
in those places where they were formerly in repute, a suspicion arises that
working them is not attended with profit. Those who ob∣ject to the use of oxen
say, that there is nothing saved, but the original cost of the ox; which, from
the difference between the value of their labour and that of a horse, is soon
compensated. At same time, it is a business of infinite difficulty, to get
per∣sons to work them. This is a point, however, that cannot be de∣cisively
determined without much investigation and inquiry; particularly in those parts
of the kingdom where the practice is still continued.</P>
<P><HI>Roads.</HI>—The utility of good roads, is at first sight
so evi∣dent, that we need hardly say this subject deserves particular
at∣tention. In the West Riding, there are a great number of very good roads,
and likewise a number that are indifferent. From what we could learn, they are
generally under good management, and the funds well applied. In many places of
the district, par∣ticularly near the manufacturing towns, materials are bad. To
<PB N="37" REF="36"/> this circumstance, more than any impropriety of
management, we attribute their insufficiency. At same time, the ingenuity of
the surveyors was conspicuous, in burning free stones, and brick, to supply the
want of harder materials.</P>
<P>As these burnt materials make at the best but a very imperfect
covering, and need to be frequently repeated, it occurs to us, that hard stones
might be brought, by water carriage, from the more eastern parts of the
district. This might probably be ex∣pensive at first, but we are convinced,
would be found cheapest at the long run. From Halifax to Wakefield, the road is
in the most miserable situation; and if it was so when we travelled it, in the
end of October, it must be nearly impassable during the winter months. This is
a very public road, and no expence ought to be spared, to render it good and
sufficient.</P>
<P>We apprehend, the weight of the numerous waggons that pass over
this, and other roads in the manufacturing part of the coun∣try, must always
render them bad, so long as they are repaired with soft materials. We saw some
roads, that had been newly covered with burnt stones and bricks, crushed down
at once by the weight of these carriages: let us suppose rain to fall, and
re∣main in the track or rut so made; another waggon comes, and cuts down still
further; and a third puts them in as bad condi∣tion as before they were
repaired. By these waggons, an endless expence is created to the public, and
still bad roads are the con∣sequence.</P>
<P>There was nothing gave us greater satisfaction, than the paved
foot paths upon the sides of most of the roads in the manufac∣turing part of
the country. This shews an attention to the com∣fort of foot passengers that is
very laudable. We have noticed in the Journal, these foot paths are also made
"bridle roads;" a practice which can only be excused by the peculiar badness of
the main road.</P>
<P>The roads are a very heavy article of expence to the farmer; and
here, as well as in most other parts of the island, the burden is chiefly laid
upon the occupiers of land. It cannot be properly called a part of the rent; as
if the work is rightly laid out, full <PB N="38" REF="37"/> value is received
from it: the farmer travels the road with more case and convenience to himself;
and is enabled, from the im∣provement made by his labour, and money, to carry
more corn to market, and to return with a heavier load of dung, than he could
do if the roads were in their natural state. Road expence, there∣fore, cannot
be viewed in the same light as tithes and poors rates; for these can, in no
sense of the word, be considered as paid for value received.</P>
<P>It has often appeared surprising to us, how the support of the by
roads should be thrown upon the possessors of land; and persons of almost every
other rank allowed the benefit of them, free of all charge whatever. In many
cases, those who pay least for the making good roads, have the greatest share
of the profit. The turnpike laws are not founded upon such false principles,
but every person by them, is obliged to contribute his share of the expence for
supporting the roads, in a direct proportion to the use and benefit he receives
from them.</P>
<P>The statute labour paid by the farmer for the support of the
roads, is six days labour of a team with three horses, or four oxen and one
horse, and two able servants, for every £ 50. of rent, or less or more
proportionally, together with an assessment in money of 6<HI>d.</HI> per pound
upon the rent, or higher if the justices see necessa∣ry. Statute labour is also
paid by the inhabitants and occupiers of tenements, woods, tithes, and
hereditaments. The surveyors are nominated annually, upon the 22d September, at
a meeting of the inhabitants of each parish or township, who make up a list,
not exceeding ten persons, whom they think fit for that office; which is given
in to the justices, who appoint one or more out of the list, as they see
necessary. The surveyor or surveyors collect the assessment, see the work
properly executed; and when their time in office is expired, they lay their
accounts before another meeting of inhabitants, and afterwards before a justice
of the peace, who may pass, or postpone them to the special sessions, to whom
every person who thinks himself aggrieved may appeal.</P>
<P>This mode of managing the roads appears more eligible and proper
than what is practised in many other parts of the island.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38"/> In making up the list of surveyors, the
inhabitants place the person they wish appointed first, and the justices
generally ap∣point accordingly. If the surveyor is deficient in his duty, he is
fined in a sum not exceeding £ 5. nor less than £ 2. for every
neglect; and as he must produce his accounts at a vestry meet∣ing, he can
hardly escape if culpable. The auditing the ac∣counts annually is a very proper
step, and prevents that disorder and confusion, which has been well known to
have taken place in some other counties.</P>
<P><HI>Manufactures.</HI>—It is unnecessary to speak here of
manu∣factures, further than as they are connected with agriculture. It will
appear from many passages in the Journal, that they are of material advantage
towards promoting good husbandry, and that to them the West Riding is indebted
for its present flourish∣ing state. A considerable portion of the land is
occupied by per∣sons whose chief dependance is upon manufactures. We are not,
in this case, to expect the same attention to the minutiae of farming, as from
those who make it their sole occupation. Their minds and capitals are generally
fixed upon their own business, and land is solely farmed by them as a mere
matter of convenience or amusement. In the vicinity of the manufactur∣ing
towns, great numbers of milk cows are fed, and there is a constant demand, not
only in those places, but over the whole Riding, for milk, and the articles of
cheese and butter, which are produced from it.</P>
<P><HI>Agricultural Societies.</HI>—In our progress through the
West Riding, we could not learn, after the minutest inquiry, that a single
society subsisted for the improvement of agriculture. We heard of three that
were formerly established for that useful pur∣pose, viz. at Sheffield, Bautry,
and Doncaster, but these for some time past have been discontinued.</P>
<P>As improvements in agriculture very often locally take place, and
are slow in travelling from one part of a country to another, we should esteem
the institution of societies upon proper princi∣ples, an excellent method for
disseminating knowledge in this science; if these societies were to correspond
with one another, <PB N="40" REF="39"/> every new improvement, either in
cultivation, stock, or husbandry utensils that was devised in one part of the
country, would be im∣mediately known in its most distant parts. For want of
these means of communication at present, the great body of farmers are almost
as ignorant of what their brethren in other counties are doing, as if they
lived in a foreign land.</P>
<P>In constituting agricultural societies, we are far from
recom∣mending an intermixture of proprietors and farmers together. It is
absolutely necessary, for many obvious reasons, they should be separate.
Without dwelling upon these, it may only be said, that in presence of his
landlord the farmer is too ready to be diffident, and will not propose his
opinions in that free and un∣restrained manner he would do, if only amongst the
company of his brethren and equals. We heard of the Sheffield society, where
gentlemen, clergy, and farmers, met promiscuously; the consequence of which
was, that the latter were in a manner prohibited from mentioning improvements,
in case they should be a watch-word for the one increasing the rent, and the
other raising the rate of tithes.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>II. OBSTACLES TO IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Having given a comprehensive view of the present state of
husbandry in the West Riding, we shall now proceed to point out the obstacles
that, in our humble opinion, stand in the way of its further improvement. These
we consider to be, want of leases; injurious and improper covenants betwixt
landlord and te∣nant; payment of tithes in kind, or by annual valuation; and
the smallness of farms. Many other causes of less consequence might be pointed
out, but these are the great and leading obsta∣cles, and it is unnecessary to
pick at pebbles, while mountains are in the way.</P>
<P><HI>Want of Leases.</HI>—That celebrated agricultural
writer, Arthur Young, in his Political Arithmetic, published twenty 
<PB N="41" REF="40"/> years ago, has said that, 
<Q REND="inline">"the improvements which have taken place in
England, have been almost owing to the custom of granting leases, and that in
those countries where it is unusual to grant them, agriculture continues much
inferior to what it is to be found where they are usual."</Q> If this doctrine
be admitted, (and in our opinion it is founded upon principles that cannot be
disputed,) the general custom of not granting leases in the dis∣trict we are
now treating of, must deserve reprehension, and if we are to judge of its
husbandry by the rule here laid down, we would be under the necessity of
declaring, that however flourishing the country may be, and however much it may
be improved in every branch of its agriculture, still if leases had been
granted, and a security thereby offered to the farmer for enjoying the fruits
of his labour, these improvements would have increased; and consequently the
interest not only of the public, but also of the proprietors themselves, would
have been materially pro∣moted. This is an important subject, and well deserves
the at∣tention of every landed gentleman in the kingdom.</P>
<P>Before a farm can be put in proper order, a considerable time must
elapse, and much money must be expended. The fruits of improvements are not
gained all at once, and a number of years are required to accomplish the best
digested plan. Suppose, for in∣stance, a person entering to a farm that was
worn out and exhausted by long and successive tillage, and that he wishes to
refresh the land by laying it down to grass; it will be six years at least
before he can go over it all with fallow, and unless he sow it down clean, he
is neither doing the land nor himself justice. If he continues it in grass five
or six years more, which is little enough time for ground so exhausted, it will
be found that near twenty years must take place before he receive the reward
for his improved cultiva∣tion; and to receive this reward he has a claim both
from his superior management, and as an incitement to his future industry: but
what security has he for this reward, or what incentive has he to industry, if
he sits upon the premises by virtue of an an∣nual lease. In the midst of his
career he might be interrupted by a <HI>six months warning,</HI> and the toil
of his hands, and the <PB N="42" REF="41"/> fruits of his improvements, go to
another. These are not ima∣ginary apprehensions, but arguments founded upon
real and solid principles; and which will operate less or more upon every
farmer, according to his situation and circumstances.</P>
<P>Again, we shall suppose a farmer wishing to improve his breed of
sheep; the first step he has to take is to hire, or purchase rams at an
extravagant rate, or otherwise he will not get them at all. If he is removable
upon six months warning, sentence may be pronouncing against him, when his ewes
are but lambing, and all his schemes of improvement blasted at once; as a
reflec∣tion upon his precarious settlement would probably make the former
farmer continue in the usual routine of cropping his ex∣hausted fields, and
taking what he could find in the old beaten path; so similar considerations
would probably influence the other to refrain from improving his flock in such
a manner as he would otherwise do; which is not only detrimental to his
in∣terest as an individual, but a great loss to the public at large.</P>
<P>From these things we hope it will appear, that before any real and
solid improvements can ever be effected by the farmer, he must have the
security of a lease, for affording him time to reap the fruits of these
improvements. There is, in the course of farming, as much often laid out upon a
single acre of ground, as many succeeding crops can repay; in this case, where
the farmer has a lease, he looks to a future period for being reimbursed: if he
has none, can it ever be expected that any man of common sense will throw away
his money by improving another person's estate, and cast himself upon the mercy
and discretion of his landlord for time and opportunity to gain it back again?
The farmer who would do this, is not guided by the same principles that
influence the rest of mankind.</P>
<P>The higher a farm is improved, the greater the quantity of manure
laid upon it, the cleaner the fields are, the richer the pastures and meadows,
the completer the fences, and the more convenient the buildings and offices,
are all circumstances that may operate against the farmer who has no lease, and
be the means of alluring a covetous neighbour to attempt wresting his 
<PB N="43" REF="42"/> possession from him, or may be used as arguments by a
design∣ing steward for raising his rent. Such being the case, every
con∣siderate man is deterred from expending a halfpenny more than he is
necessarily obliged to do; and therefore it follows, that the withholding
leases is a real and certain obstacle in the way of far∣ther improvements.</P>
<P>We might also mention arguments of another kind, for grant∣ing
leases, which, however contemptuously they may be consi∣dered by others, have
great weight with us. The farmer who sits without a lease, has scarcely the
privilege of thinking and acting for himself;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We were
informed the tenants on an estate in the northern part of Eng∣land had got
warnings of removal, merely because <HI>they had turned methodists.</HI> There
are not many landlords that find fault with their tenants for being re∣ligious.
This instance is only given to shew upon what trivial grounds re∣movals are
made.</NOTE> it is needless to bring forward arguments in support of this
proposition, for it cannot be contradicted. We have often heard it said, that
the liberty enjoyed by the farmer, and the security afforded by the
constitution to his property, were the principal causes why agriculture
flourished more in this island than in other nations. We beg leave to inquire,
where is the liberty enjoyed by the farmer who sits without a lease? his words
and actions are under the most absolute sub∣jection to another, who carries
along with him a never failing argument upon all occasions. Let the abject
situation of such a man, placed under a capricious landlord, be considered, his
best actions may be misinterpreted; he is exposed to every in∣dignity without
daring to complain: or if the spirit of a man gets up in him, what security
does the constitution afford to his situation?<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The custom of the country in allowing what is called tillage, and
half tillage to the out-going farmer, is no reimbursement for any improvement
he may have made. The time of entry is at Candlemas, and the in-coming tenant
enters to the wheat that is sown, and to the labour done upon the farm by his
predecessor, the former of which must be carefully improved and at∣tended to,
while every possible advantage is taken of the latter; for these things, as
well as the manure laid on, and the grass seeds sown the preced∣ing year, he is
allowed. This practice is rather against the out-going tenant, as he receives
no more than he actually expended, and another person reaps what he had sowed.
His time, personal industry, and all other improve∣ments, go for
nothing.</NOTE> If he has made improvements, the fruits of them are 
<PB N="44" REF="43"/> wrested from him by an arbitrary removal. Another farm
can∣not always be got, and he may be turned upon the wide world without the
hopes of redress. A prudent man will reflect upon these things, and if he is so
critically situated, will often rather part with his natural rights than expose
himself to misery: he may have a numerous family; his farm may be doing well
with him; he may have contracted an affection for his <HI>natale solum,</HI>
and be uncertain, if he makes a change, how he is next to be put up. The
picture may be still higher coloured; but from the above, we contend that the
want of a lease precludes the farmer from acting as a free agent, and renders
his property in∣secure and precarious.</P>
<P><HI>Covenants or Restrictions.</HI>—That covenants in a
lease are obstacles to improvements cannot be disputed, for the very na∣ture of
a covenant supposes that the practice to be regulated by it had arrived at its
<HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> and could not be mended. These covenants subsist more
or less in every lease we heard of: and the shorter the lease, the more
numerous they are. In annual leases there appears an absolute necessity for
them; as the farmer, from having no certain prospect of enjoying his
pos∣session, would otherwise be tempted to disregard every branch of good
husbandry.</P>
<P>It will hardly be alleged, in defence of this practice, that
agri∣culture has already arrived at its utmost pitch of perfection, and that
improvements in that art can be carried no farther. We will not suppose that
any person acquainted with the subject will offer such defences. The very
appointment of the Honourable Board, for whose consideration this is drawn up,
is a public tes∣timony that the practice of husbandry may still be improved.
But how is this to be done if the farmer, who is the first wheel of the
agricultural machine, be restricted in his management? If the crops he is to
sow be marked out by the drawer of his lease, <PB N="45" REF="44"/> how is more
approved rotations to be introduced? The fact is, that all good farming is
local, and must in a great measure be re∣gulated by the soil and the weather.
It is therefore absurd to lay down in a lease particular rules for a number of
years practice; as from circumstances many fields are often both richer and
cleaner after carrying 5 or 6 crops, than others after two; conse∣quently,
without leaving every thing to the wisdom and judgment of the farmer, the
ground can never be properly cultivated, nor made to produce its greatest
value.</P>
<P>Restrictions in a lease necessarily suppose that the framer of
them possessed more knowledge of farming than he whose opera∣tions are thus to
be directed. We leave the public to judge whether this can actually be the case
or not. Leases are of∣ten copied from one generation to another, without paying
any attention to more recent improvements. How is it possible for an attorney
or his clerk to lay down rules for the farmer's direc∣tion? Allowing it is the
steward, or even the proprietor him∣self, that dictates these rules, we are
warranted to say it is naturally impossible they can be wisely and judiciously
framed. Laying aside the consideration of their fettering the farmer's mind and
clogging his operations, such restrictions or rules may, from alteration in
markets, be unprofitable; and from the vicissitudes of seasons, improper to be
executed.</P>
<P>Every farmer knows from experience that the proper manner of
cultivating any land is only to be learned from an intimate ac∣quaintance with
the nature of its soil, and that what is very good management upon one farm, is
often very bad upon another. The covenants suppose all to be alike, that grass
is of equal benefit on all lands, and that the same quantity of lime should be
administered to a light loam as to a strong clay. Besides, in framing these
covenants, it is taken for granted that a person from a cursory view, is at
once able to determine upon the best mode of management for the endurance of a
whole lease; or, in other words, that his judgment is equal to that of the
whole tenantry of an estate. In short, covenants are inimical to all good
husbandry. They sink the farmer into a state of insigni∣ficance. 
<PB N="46" REF="45"/> They contract his mind, and lock up his ideas from
searching after new schemes, which is the only method by which improvements can
ever be found out; and therefore it follows, that a continuation of covenants
is highly detrimental not only to the public good, but even to the interest of
the proprietor him∣self, by lessening the rent that a superior cultivation,
arising from a spirit of improvement, would be able to pay.</P>
<P>We are ready to admit that general rules of management are very
proper in leases, such as, to keep the farm under a husband∣like management, to
consume all the straw raised upon it, and to sell no dung. These restrictions
we will allow; and every good farmer will follow them whether he is obliged or
not. Nay, we will go farther—If leases of a proper duration were granted,
it is very reasonable that the property of the landlord ought to be protected
by restricting clauses for the 3 years previous to their expiration. But after
all, it will be found that no clause can be inserted, besides the general ones
already mentioned, that will serve to enhance the value of the land, but
obliging the farmer, to leave a proportional quantity of such land in grass at
the ex∣piration of the lease. Other clauses serve only to distress the farmer,
but will never promote the interest of the landlord.</P>
<P><HI>Tithes.</HI>—The next obstacle to improvements is the
collec∣tion of tithes in kind, or by an annual valuation; and they are a
burthen upon agriculture that must ever damp the operations of the husbandman.
Indeed where the tenth of the actual produce is drawn, it is peculiarly
exceptionable. The tithe-holders may have a right, by the laws of the land, to
the tenth part of the <HI>natural</HI> produce of the earth. This we are not to
contest; but is it not an impediment to cultivation, that they shall also
receive the tenth part of the farmer's labours, and the tenth of the
ad∣ditional crop produced by the improvements he has made, whereby 
<Q REND="inline">"two stalks of corn have grown, where only one
grew before?"</Q> Surely not; unless the drawer is at the tenth of the expence
oc∣casioned by these improvements: otherwise he not only draws a tenth of the
natural produce of the earth, but also a tenth of the superior cultivation and
additional manure bestowed upon <PB N="47" REF="46"/> the land; and more than
that, a tenth of the farmer's industry, merit, and abilities.</P>
<P>We have already stated that sometimes the tithes are paid
ac∣cording to an annual valuation. Although at first sight this may appear as
so much more rent, and is in fact considered by a num∣ber of people in that
light, yet it operates much more severely upon the farmer, than the same sum
agreed upon by him in the lease to be paid. This we will now endeavour to
substantiate.</P>
<P>The rent paid to the landlord is a known definite, sum which
neither falls nor increases whatever crops are raised by the far∣mer. If by
good cultivation or strength of manure, he raises ever so luxuriant a crop, he
only pays the same rent to the landlord, as if the ground had produced a more
inferior one: therefore the farmer, so far as he is concerned with the
landlord, receives the fruits of his superior management. But with regard to
the tithe∣holder the case is very different. He comes before harvest, in∣spects
the fields, and finding them carrying rich crops, increases the rate of the
tithe accordingly. Instead of paying 5 <HI>s.</HI> per acre, as perhaps he used
to do, he is now obliged to pay 10 <HI>s.</HI> or 12 <HI>s.</HI> merely because
he has managed his land in a manner supe∣rior to his neighbours. The case is
exactly in point, if we sup∣pose the landlord's rent was to be fixed by the
goodness of the crops; the fatal consequences of which need no illustration.
But whatever detriment this might occasion to improvements, it would not be a
bit heavier than the other. The landlord has as good a right to a share of the
extraordinary cultivation, manure, industry, merit, and abilities of the
farmer, bestowed upon the fields he cultivates, as the tithe-holder can
possibly claim.</P>
<P><HI>Smallness of Farms.</HI>—The last thing we have to
state, as an obstacle to improvements in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is the
general small size of farms, which necessarily occasions the ground to be
cultivated by persons, whose minds and stocks are incapable of carrying on
spirited undertakings.</P>
<P>The proper size of a farm, is a question upon which theorists have
often disputed. In our inquiries, we wish to be regulated <PB N="48" REF="47"/>
by practical principles; and although we are fully convinced, that a farm of
extent, operates as a spur to activity and diligence, yet we are not advocates
for any system that would monopolize the lands of any country, by throwing them
into the hands of a few.</P>
<P>An improved system of husbandry, requires that the farm upon which
it is to be carried on should be of some extent, or else room is not afforded
for the different crops necessary to com∣plete a perfect rotation of
management. The farmer, who prac∣tises husbandry upon proper principles, should
not only have his fields under all sorts of grain, but likewise a sufficient
quantity of grass and winter crops, for carrying on his stock of cattle and
sheep through all the different seasons of the year. By laying out land in this
style, the economy of a farm is so regulated, that too much work does not occur
at one time, nor any occasion for idleness at another. This, when the expences
of farm culture are so extravagant as at present, deserves particular
attention; but cannot, in the nature of things, be justly and accurately
ar∣ranged, where the farm is of small size.</P>
<P>It may be imagined, that the arrangement of farm labour, and the
cultivation of the ground, whatever the size of the farm may be, is but a Rule
of Three question; and that the smallness of the possession, only reduces the
scale upon which improvements are to be carried on. In some senses of the word,
this may be true; but will the result of the question be favourable to
improvements? Upon 50 acres, labour may not be afforded for half a team; the
inclosures would perhaps be a few acres, and the farmer would go to market to
buy a single beast, thereby affording opportunity for spending half the year in
idleness, wasting the ground by a number of fences, and occasioning more
expence than the whole profit would repay. These things are the necessary
consequences of arranging farm management as a Rule of Three question, and are
great drawbacks upon the profits of farming.</P>
<P>Besides, an improved system of husbandry requires the farmer
should be possessed of an adequate stock, a thing in which small farmers are
generally deficient. It is an old proverb, the truth of <PB N="49" REF="48"/>
which we have too often seen exemplified, 
<Q REND="inline">"that the poor farmer is always a bad one."</Q>
Allowing he has knowledge, he cannot re∣duce it to practice, for want of the
necessary means of putting it in execution. The smallness of the West Riding
farms, and the precarious situation of the farmer's condition, arising from
want of leases, as well as the trammels under which he is obliged to work,
have, in a great measure, thrown capitals into another line. Before an
alteration of these things takes place, persons of abili∣ties, and possessed of
stock, will be tempted to look down upon the profession, and agriculture will
not be carried on in its most improved state.</P>
<P>With regard to the question, whether large or small farms are
generally best managed? we apprehend very few words will suffice. Who keeps
good horses, and feeds them well? Who makes the completest fallow, takes the
deepest furrow, and ploughs best? Who has the greatest number of hands, and
sufficient strength for catching the proper season, by which the crop upon the
best of grounds is often regulated? Who drives the most manure, and raises the
weightiest crops? We believe, in the general, these questions must be answered
in favour of the large farmer. If so, it follows that the prevalence of small
farms in the West Riding of Yorkshire, retards its improvement.</P>
<P>It is a popular doctrine, that large farms are unfriendly to
po∣pulation, and that they ought to be discouraged. We suspect this is founded
in prejudice, and will not stand the test, if accurately examined. No doubt, if
farms are increased in size, the number of farmers are lessened; this is
granted: but with regard to the great scale of population, we are clearly of
opinion it is not af∣fected. If a more superior practice is carried on upon a
large farm than a small one, this must be accomplished by employing a greater
number of hands. What, therefore, is lost in one class, is gained in another.
Besides, we have often noticed, that upon large farms most married servants are
kept, which affords encou∣ragement to the increase of population. Upon a small
farm, from 50 to 100 acres, what is the farmer to do? he has not suffi∣cient
business for employing his attention, and the smallness of <PB N="50" REF="49"/>
his possession will not allow him to be idle. He therefore must work with his
hands, which brings the question precisely to the same issue, as if all work
was performed by hired servants, inde∣pendant of the arguments we have adduced,
that more work is executed, and more hands employed, upon a large farm, than
upon the same extent of land divided into a number of small ones.</P>

<HEAD>III. IMPROVEMENTS SUGGESTED.</HEAD>
<P>Agriculture is the parent of all the arts, and the practice of it
may be considered as a standard for the flourishing of others. It has for some
years past been a principal object in the se∣veral governments of Europe, to
frame laws and regulations for its encouragement; and the establishment of a
Board for pro∣moting Agriculture and Internal Improvement, shews it is not
neglected in our own country. We have already presented to the consideration of
that Honourable Board, a state of the husbandry in the West Riding of
Yorkshire, and also pointed out for their information, the principal obstacles
which are in the way of fur∣ther improvements: we now proceed to suggest how
these ob∣stacles may be removed, and what alterations ought to be intro∣duced
into the husbandry of the district.</P>
<P>The improvements we suggest are, 
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st. That all land should be let upon lease.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 2dly. That the covenants that presently subsist betwixt
land∣lord and tenant should be discontinued.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 3dly. That the payment of tithes should be fixed by a
perma∣nent valuation.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 4thly. That a general bill should pass for dividing the
common fields and waste grounds.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These we account the leading articles of improvement; without
which no material encouragement can be given to the husbandry 
<PB N="51" REF="50"/> of the district. In the hopes that the Board of
Agriculture will consider them in the same light, we shall proceed to
recommend, 
<LIST>
<ITEM>5thly. More approved rotations of crops.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 6thly. Breaking up the grass fields, and frequent changes
of corn and grass.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 7thly. Drilling and horse-hoeing beans and turnips.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 8thly. Planting the waste grounds.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Many other articles of lesser importance might be added, but as
most of them are already noticed in the foregoing parts of this work, we shall
not now enter upon them.</P>
<P>1st. <HI>That all Lands should be let upon Lease.</HI>—We
have of∣ten had occasion in the preceding pages to shew the baneful
con∣sequences attending want of leases, and how few real improve∣ments will
ever be introduced into the practice of agriculture so long as the farmer has
no security for enjoying his possession more than one year. We therefore
recommend, as a necessary step to encourage good farming, that leases should be
granted of a proper duration. This would not only operate in favour of the
farmer, but would likewise be the means of increasing the rent-roll of the
proprietor; for no man will ever pay as much for an acre of land, while he is
removable at pleasure, as when a permanency is granted him. Upon all lands
already in a state of cultivation, we apprehend 19 or 21 years are very proper
terms for the continuance of a lease. They afford the farmer time and
opportunity to make improvements, and to receive a proper return for the money
so laid out, without depriving the landlord, farther than necessary, of any
advantages that might arise to him from a progressive increase in the value of
his grounds. Without this security, no farmer will engage in any expensive or
spirited management; and the state of the country will remain for ever
precisely as it is.</P>
<P>2d. <HI>That Covenants or Restrictions should be
discontinued.</HI>—If leases are granted of a proper duration, there will
remain lit∣tle occasion for covenants betwixt landlord and tenant, or
re∣strictions upon the management of the latter. If it is thought necessary for
protecting the landlord's property to restrict the <PB N="52" REF="51"/> tenant
for the three last years of the lease, we see little harm that would arise
either to individuals or the public from that measure. Our ideas of a lease
are, that it is a mere bargain betwixt land∣lord and tenant, wherein the
former, for a valuable consideration, conveys over to the latter all his rights
in the premises for a specified number of years, and that it ought to be left
to the wis∣dom and abilities of the farmer to manage the land in such a manner
as he may think most proper for enabling him to make good his engagements to
the landlord. If leases were granted upon these principles, a great deal of
unnecessary trouble would be saved to both parties; improvements would increase
with ra∣pidity, and the peace, comfort, and happiness of that useful body of
men, the farmers, be materially promoted.</P>
<P>Our opinions upon the clauses that should be inserted in a lease
are plain and simple, and we beg leave to state what the heads should be.</P>
<P>Landlord agrees for a specified rent, to be paid at the terms of
Candlemas, Whitsunday, and Lammas, after the crop is off the ground, to set
such a portion of land for 21 years, and to put all the houses, offices, and
inclosures upon the premises in habitable and fencible situation.</P>
<P>Tenant agrees to pay rent as aforesaid, and to forfeit his lease
if payments are not made within six months after they fall due, with interest
for the intervening time; to manage the land in a husband-like manner, and not
to sell straw or dung off the pre∣mises; to support all the houses and fences
during the continu∣ance of the lease, and to leave them at its expiration in a
habit∣able and fencible condition; to leave <HI>one fourth</HI> of the farm in
grass at least three years old, and likewise a <HI>sixth part</HI> of the
re∣mainder as fallow to the in-coming tenant, upon allowance being made him by
valuation of neutral persons; and if any difference arise, either during the
lease, or about the situation of the houses and fences at the conclusion, such
difference to be referred to ar∣bitrators mutually chosen. If land was set
agreeably to this me∣thod, the management of an estate would comparatively be
an easy task to what it is at present; and while no injury was done 
<PB N="53" REF="52"/> to the landlord, the condition of the farmer, from being
uncer∣tain, would be respectable and happy.</P>
<P>We may offer another argument for meliorating the situation of the
farmer, and that we hope is a laudable one. Without a lease, and bound up with
fetters on every hand, his interest in the welfare or prosperity of his country
is not equally strong. What∣ever takes place, a shorter lease than an annual
one cannot be granted. In a few words, the best security for the peaceable
deportment of any man, is to place him in a situation that will be much
affected by a change.</P>
<P>The farmers over Great Britain are a numerous body of men, and in
every agricultural county, their influence over the lower ranks must and will
be considerable. We speak from our feel∣ings, when we say their general
situation well deserves attention. If landlords neglect their own interest as
well as that of the pub∣lic, and persist in setting land without lease, and
under absurd and pernicious restrictions, the subject deserves to be taken up
by the supreme legislature itself. It may be asked, would you in∣terfere with
private property, and restrain individuals from ma∣naging their own concerns as
they saw fit? Certainly, if that ma∣nagement is detrimental to the public good.
To compare great things with small—Parliament have already interposed
their au∣thority in a case nearly similar. By the act of regulating the number
of outside fares upon stage coaches, commonly called Mr. Gamon's Act, the
legislature very laudably interfered with the management of private property,
in order that the lives of the passengers might not be sacrificed for private
gain. The only difference in the two cases would be, that in the one the
coach∣man's profit was lessened by the regulation; whereas in the other the
income of the landed proprietor would be increased by en∣forcing the measure
now recommended.</P>
<P>We neglected to mention in its proper place, that the period fixed
for the farmer's removal is both improper and inconvenient.</P>
<P>We believe that Candlemas is the general term over the West
Riding, and that the in-coming tenant then enters to the farm precisely in the
state it stands. That the wheat and grass sown <PB N="54" REF="53"/> for that
crop, and all the labour by that time performed imme∣diately becomes his, upon
paying his predecessor the value of the labour, manure, and seed expended. We
apprehend, if these ar∣ticles <HI>can</HI> be properly ascertained, there is no
injustice done to the out-going tenant, as he would receive the same advantages
at his entry. It might however happen, from this custom, that a farmer would
never cut the crop he had sown himself; for where he had no lease, an unlucky
concurrence of accidents might give him an annual removal. At any rate, the
practice is not eligible, for it cannot be supposed that, after a warning is
given, the out∣going tenant is to pay the greatest attention to the ploughing
or sowing a crop he is not to reap; besides, it interferes with the time for
which servants are hired, and if a person cannot find another farm at once,
what is he to make of them? We are also of opinion, that it is not the best
time of the year for disposing of stock. We look upon the custom of removing
from the houses at Whitsunday, and the last crop belonging to the out∣going
tenant, as practised in Scotland, to be far more convenient and advantageous to
both parties, as it does not oblige the in∣coming tenant to have any
unnecessary interference with the property of his predecessor.</P>
<P><HI>Tithes.</HI>—The commutation of tithes has been long and
ar∣dently wished for by every real friend to the prosperity of his country, and
till this is accomplished, agriculture must always struggle with great
difficulties. We would be the last persons that would wish to injure private
property of any kind, or trench upon the rights of so respectable a body as the
Church of Eng∣land, whose learning, character, and merit, require no fresh
eu∣logiums. But surely, if the mode of collecting that property is injurious to
the public welfare, and detrimental to its pros∣perity, some other method ought
to be devised by which this tax might be paid, without occasioning such
injury.</P>
<P>We have heard of many plans for reforming the tithe system, and
all are attended with considerable difficulties. We are decidedly against
giving land in lieu of them, as there is too much land in mortmain already in
the kingdom. We shall mention two schemes, <PB N="55" REF="54"/> any of which
will remove the obstacle occasioned by tithes to improving agriculture, and
will be attended with beneficial con∣sequences to the tithe-holders
themselves.</P>
<P>1st. Let all the tithes be valued by proper persons in each
pa∣rish, under the authority of a Board instituted for that purpose; this
valuation to remain unalterable, and be the rule of payment in all time coming.
This would make proper compensation to the holders, whether laymen or
ecclesiastics, and would remove the complaints of those who compare the present
mode of pay∣ment to the taille or old land-tax of France, which was collected
by the different intendants according to the goodness of the crop.</P>
<P>2dly. There is another plan, which we think best of. After the
tithes are valued as aforesaid, let them be offered to the re∣spective
proprietors of land at 30 years purchase, which every man, who knows his own
interest, would gladly accept in order to be quit of them. The purchase-money,
where they belonged the clergy, to be vested in government stock in name of the
par∣ticular parish from whence it is produced, and the interest regu∣larly paid
to the incumbent. Where tithes are the property of laymen, the purchase-money
might be immediately paid into their own hands.</P>
<P>Considering the subject in a moral point of view, every well
dis∣posed person must lament that the collection of a tax, purposely given for
the support of religion, should be the means of creating disrespect for its
ministers. There are no arguments necessary to prove, that where the clergyman
differs with his parishioners upon this subject, the usefulness of his office
is totally frustrated; which makes not only the practice, but even the
profession of religion, be disregarded.</P>
<P><HI>Division of the Common Fields and Waste
Grounds.</HI>—The common fields in the West Riding afford greater scope
for prac∣tical improvements than any other department of its husbandry, and are
at present generally under most wretched management. This the proprietors must
be sensible of, but the expence of a particular act of division intimidates
many from applying to parliament for its interposition. It would therefore be
of great <PB N="56" REF="55"/> utility that a <HI>general bill</HI> was passed
for that purpose, as is al∣ready the case in Scotland, leaving it to the judge
ordinary of the bounds to put it in execution, when application for that
purpose was made by any of the proprietors. It would be necessary in this bill
to define the extent of manorial rights, and to settle the proportion to be
allowed for tithes, in case they are not previously regulated. If the fields
are divided, we see no necessity to force the proprietor to inclose whether he
will or not, as is done at present, in consequence of the powers vested in the
commissioners appointed to execute the respective inclosure bills. If the
pro∣prietor is attentive to his own interest, he will do it himself with∣out
compulsion, and at the same time do it more frugally, than when it is executed
under a public commission.</P>
<P>With regard to the waste grounds which are very extensive, they
ought to be divided wherever they are common. At pre∣sent they are of very
little profit to the different proprietors, being in general vastly
overstocked, unless where they are stinted pas∣tures, which is not frequent. If
each person's proportion was duly ascertained, he could manage his own part as
he saw most conducive to his interest. If it was worth while, he would in∣close
and improve. If it answered for planting, he might im∣prove it in that manner;
or he would manage it as uninclosed moors have hitherto been treated in other
parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>As we have mentioned the Scots laws for dividing commons, we give
the following extract of the act of parliament passed in 1695, for regulating
that business.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"All commons, excepting those belonging to the
king in pro∣perty, or royal burghs in burgage, may be divided at the in∣stance
of any individual having interest, by summons raised against all persons
concerned before the lords of session, who are empowered to discuss the
relevancy, to determine upon the rights and interests of the parties concerned,
to divide the same amongst them, and to grant commission for perambulating, and
taking all other necessary probation, to be reported to the lords, and the
process to be ultimately determined by them, declaring, that the interest of
the heritors having right in the common <PB N="57" REF="56"/> shall be estimated
according to the valuation of their respective lands and properties; and that a
portion be adjudged to each adjacent heritor in proportion to his property;
with power to the lords to divide the mosses, if any be in the common, among
the parties having interest; or in case they cannot be con∣veniently divided,
that they remain in common, with free ish and entry, whether divided or
not."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Introducing more approved Rotations of Crops.</HI>—If
leases of a proper duration are not to be granted, and if the practice of
binding up tenants with strict covenants is continued, it would be perfectly
unnecessary to suggest any improvement in the mode of cropping the ground, as
however willing the farmer may be to adopt new practices, he is in a manner
prohibited from doing so by the conditions under which he holds his possession.
But entertaining the sanguine expectations, that these invincible obstacles to
good husbandry will soon be removed, we proceed to point out such alterations
as in our humble opinion are pro∣per to be introduced into the husbandry of the
district.</P>
<P>Viewing the present state of farming in a general manner, it
appears that the land in the West Riding is cultivated in two separate and
distinct ways, and not managed so as to make im∣provements in one branch
contribute to the advantage of the other. The fields which are laid down in
grass continue in a state of pasture a greater number of years than is
necessary for refreshing them, after being exhausted with corn crops; while the
fields kept under the plough are hackneyed and worn out by successive crops of
corn, without receiving any collateral as∣sistance but what is given them by
fallow and manure, with some passing clover crops.</P>
<P>We consider it as essential to good husbandry, to connect these
different systems, and that the ground in no other way can be kept in a
perpetual state of fertility, and made to produce its utmost value. While we
decidedly condemn the keeping land exclusively in grass, we as warmly reprehend
the contrary ex∣treme of persisting uniformly in raising crops by the plough.
The last named practice may be said to have necessity upon its side, whereas no
excuse can be offered as a palliation for the other.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="57"/> Upon the supposition that the system of
keeping lands con∣tinually in grass will be departed from, and that the farmer
will be allowed to cultivate his fields in such a way as he thinks most
beneficial, we shall give our opinion upon the most advantageous method of
cropping a farm; or in other words, shew how it may be kept in continual good
order, so as to enable the possessor to pay the highest rent, while at the same
time it is understood he is to receive a proper recompense for the expence and
labour he is at in cultivating it.</P>
<P>The first thing that is absolutely necessary for farming land
well, is to lay it clean and dry. Where land is foul, carrying either quickens,
or other weeds, it is impossible artificial plants, such as corns and grasses,
can thrive. The ground is bound up, and the food that should go for the support
of the plants sown by the husbandman is exhausted by these natural inhabitants
of the ground. The crops, therefore, are scanty, being stinted in their
produce, and inferior in their quality. Every good farmer will therefore use
his earliest efforts to make his land clean. This he will do by complete summer
fallows, or by fal∣low crops adapted to the different soils he possesses; and
having once accomplished his purpose, he will studiously endeavour to preserve
it in the same husband-like order.</P>
<P>That land may be kept clean, a powerful assistant is gained from
having it previously laid dry, or in a proper situation for carrying off the
superfluous water that falls upon it from the clouds, or rises from the veins
of the earth by springs, or from being situated upon a wet spongy bottom. This
is done by ridging the land sufficiently high, for defending it against falls
of rain, by casting out the water furrows, provincially "griping the land;" and
by digging hollow drains, which when covered carry off the superabundant
moisture, and occasion no loss of ground. These two things, laying the land
dry, and keeping it clean, are in the power of every farmer, although they are
more difficult to execute in some situations than in others; but there is
another principle requisite for bringing farming to its greatest improve∣ment,
which is to keep the land also rich; this is often not in the power of the best
farmer to command, and must in a <PB N="59" REF="58"/> great measure be
regulated by local situation, or by the particu∣lar quality of the land he
possesses.</P>
<P>Having premised these things, which we consider to be the
fundamental principles of good farming, we shall now throw out our ideas upon
the way in which a farm should be managed, and the particular crops most
advantageous to be raised upon diffe∣rent soils.</P>
<P>Upon all gravelly, sandy, and sharp soils, allowing there may be a
degree of hardness in them, we recommend the turnip hus∣bandry to be
assiduously practised. Upon such soils turnips may be introduced every fourth
or fifth year. In those parts where cutting the clover crop for hay, is
attended with profit, they come in with propriety every fourth year; but in
many si∣tuations, we judge it as advantageous, in place of sowing the bar∣ley
crop with red clover, to sow it with white clover, trefoil, and rye grass, and
to pasture it for two years with sheep; as red clover is found from experience
not to answer well, when too often repeated. This gives the ground a proper
cessation from tillage, invigorates its powers, prepares it for carrying a
weighty crop of oats, with very little collateral assistance from manure, and
allures nature with variety, which is always agree∣able.</P>
<P>A farm managed in this style, will consist of five bricks or
parts. 1st. Turnips. The first half of the turnips that are con∣sumed, to be
sown with wheat, the last half with barley, and both sown with grass seeds;
pastured the third and fourth years with sheep, and limed if thought necessary
upon the sward, or with the turnip crop, as is thought most advantageous; fifth
year, broke up for oats, which will always be found in this way a profitable
crop.</P>
<P>A farm managed in this manner (and the West Riding land, from
being mostly inclosed is admirably calculated for it), will pay both proprietor
and farmer better than most other soils. Expences of management, which is a
great consideration, are comparatively trifling; and no foreign manure, when
once the rotation is properly arranged, will ever be needed.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="59"/> The same mode of cropping, although not with
equal advan∣tages, may be carried on upon all loamy soils, unless they have too
great a portion of clay in them; but if the farm is of a mixt nature, and has
both dry gravel and loam in it, we recommend that the turnip brick may be so
arranged as to take in both soils, and that those upon the loam be eaten off
first, and the land ridged up immediately, which will both lay it dry, and
afford opportunity for correcting the stiffness and adhesion it may have
contracted by the pressure and poaching of the sheep.</P>
<P>Upon land where clay is a principal component part, or where the
bottom is wet, we cannot recommend the cultivation of tur∣nips at all, as often
the profit gained from them is lost upon the following crops. The same
objection holds against cabbages, rape, or any other plants that are to be
eaten off in the winter months.</P>
<P>Lands of this nature are more difficult to manage, than those
already described, and from being cultivated at a greater expence, are never
able to afford so much rent to the proprietor, allowing the crops raised upon
them should be as productive as those raised upon the dry soils. Beans is the
only crop that can be introduced for cleaning the ground; but although these
are an excellent assistant, they can never preclude a complete summer fallow
from being absolutely indispensable.</P>
<P>A farm of this sort ought to be divided into seven bricks or
parts, and the following rotation is in our opinion most advise∣able: 
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Fallow, with dung.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Wheat.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Beans, drilled and horse hoed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Barley, sown with grass seeds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Pasture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Pasture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Oats.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In order that a proper season for sowing the wheat upon such soils
may not be missed, we recommend it to be sown by the middle of September. Crops
early sown, though they never yield proportionably to their bulk, yet are
generally most pro∣ductive per acre; and it is an important matter upon all
clay soils that the seed should be put in dry. Wet harrowing not 
<PB N="61" REF="60"/> only dibbles in the seed beyond the power of vegetation,
but also poaches and binds the land, by which the plants are prevented from
stooling, or tillering, and gives an encouragement to the growth of any quicken
that may be left in the ground. The beans should get two furrows, the first
across, and particular pains af∣terwards taken to water-furrow the land. The
seed should be put in as early as possible, after the land is in a situation to
stand a second ploughing, as the quantity and quality of the crop de∣pend much
upon an early seed time. Barley may be sown after two furrows, as if proper
attention has been given to the bean crop the preceding year, the ground should
be in good order, and spring ploughing upon clay land is always critical.</P>
<P>In the above rotation, a proper arrangement of labour is made for
the whole season. The part destined for wheat is prepared during the summer
months: the first furrow given for the beans as soon as the wheat is removed:
next the barley land is fallowed down: then one of the pasture fields ploughed
for oats, and the first furrow given to the next year's summer fallow. This
con∣cludes the winter operations. And in the spring, begin with the bean seed,
next sow the oats, and finish with the barley seed; which concludes the work of
the season, and allots to each par∣ticular period a proper quantity of work,
without hurrying too much at once; which ought always to be regarded,
especially upon clay soils, as a material object.</P>
<P>The thin, poor clays are the most difficult to farm of any kind of
land, and nothing can be done upon them to the purpose, without the aid of a
superior quantity of manure to what can be raised upon the premises. At same
time it is perfectly unneces∣sary to lay a great quantity of manure of any kind
upon them at once, for they possess a quality so corroding, that the aid so
given to vegetation is soon wasted and lost. Where local situa∣tion will allow,
we recommend such land to be kept in 5 bricks, and cropped as follows: 
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Fallow.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Wheat.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Oats.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Pasture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Oats.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="61"/> This rotation will pay very well, if manure
can be got suffi∣cient to cover the fallow brick. The pasture should lie only
one year, as land of this kind does not improve in grass; and the oats will be
found superior, in such a case, than if the grass had been older.</P>
<P>In order that the rotations above recommended, be followed out to
the utmost advantage, it is absolutely necessary to pay particular attention to
the fallow, or the turnip crop substituted in its place. As many different
opinions prevail relative to the manner in which a fallow should be conducted,
we beg leave to state our sentiments upon that head.</P>
<P>Upon all clay soils (and upon such only, we understand a complete
summer fallow to be necessary) the first ploughing ought to be given during the
winter months, or as early in the spring as possible, which promotes the
rotting of the sward and stubble. This should be done by gathering up the
ridge, which both lays the ground dry, and rips up the furrows. As soon as seed
time is over, the ridge should be cloven down, preparatory to cross ploughing;
and, after lying a proper time, should be harrowed and rolled repeatedly, and
every particle of quickens that the harrows have brought above should be
carefully picked off with the hand. It is then proper to ridge or gather it up
immediately, which both lays the land in proper condition for meeting bad
weather, and opens up any fast land that may have been missed in the furrows
when the cross ploughing was given. After this harrow, roll, and gather the
root weeds again; and continue so doing till the field is perfectly clean.</P>
<P>We observe that the celebrated Mr. Marshall, in his Treatise upon
the Yorkshire Husbandry, recommends a practice quite different. In his opinion,
ploughing is only necessary, and tak∣ing out live roots by the harrow, and
carrying them off, is an evident impropriety. Mr. Marshall lately used similar
arguments to one of us who had the pleasure of a personal conversation with
him. We shall therefore do our best endeavours to obviate his arguments.</P>
<P>Frequent turning over the ground, although absolutely neces∣sary 
<PB N="63" REF="62"/> while the process of fallowing is going on, can never
eradi∣cate quickens, couch-grass, or other root weeds. In all clay soils, the
ground turns up in lumps, which the severest drought will not penetrate, or at
least not so far as to kill the plant contained in the heart of them. When the
land is ploughed again, these lumps or clods are simply turned over, and no
more; and the action of the plough serves in no shape to reduce them, or at
least in a very imperceptible manner. If ever there was a season for making
good fallow by ploughing, it was last year, viz. 1793; there was hardly a drop
of rain the whole summer; the drought was excessive, and attended with an
almost continued sun shine. Notwithstanding all these advantages, the fallows
which were not properly reduced in the beginning of the season, took on a
growth as soon as moisture came, about the beginning of harvest. Even when they
were completely harrowed and rolled, it was found dif∣ficult to extirpate
couch, as the dryness of the ground did not allow it to part so well from the
clod as in seasons more moist.</P>
<P>If this was the case in such a dry season as last, what would the
consequences be if the fallows were at all times to be wrought with the plough,
without attempting to drag the roots to the sur∣face by the operation of
harrowing? In wet weather, the land might appear black above for a few days;
but the enemy, being still in the house, would soon make his appearance. By
carefully gathering all the root weeds, when the land is reduced by harrow∣ing,
which on many soils is only practicable after the roller is used, an enemy is
converted into a friend; for if the stuff so ga∣thered is accumulated into a
heap, frequently turned over, till it rots, and mixed with lime, a most
excellent compost is pro∣duced.</P>
<P>There is very little danger that clay land will ever be too much
reduced by the different harrowings and rollings proposed to be given; as the
last furrow, if taken deep, will raise a mould suffi∣cient for covering the
seed, and for protecting the wheat during the winter. Upon such soils, nothing
but frost will reduce and mel∣low the land perfectly; and we have seen the
necessity of leaving <PB N="64" REF="63"/> fields of this description to be
wrought in the spring, from the absolute impossibility of eradicating or
killing the couch, till re∣inforced by this powerful auxiliary.</P>
<P>We shall just mention another argument in favour of gathering root
weeds:—that in no other way can the purpose for which fal∣lowing is
intended, be so cheaply attained. Every furrow that is given, will at least
stand the farmer 7 <HI>s.</HI> per acre; and if hand gathering will save one
single ploughing, its expence is amply repaid; while at same time we contend,
that more root weeds are taken off by gathering them once, than will be
destroyed by a couple of ploughings, allowing the season to be ever so
fa∣vourable.</P>
<P>We have heard of some other writers, that condemn clean summer
fallow altogether, as an unnecessary waste of rent and labour; which, in their
opinion, might be saved, and the ground kept in perfect good order by a proper
rotation of crops. We apprehend upon all clay soils this is impossible; as
every farmer who possesses such soils, knows by experience the difficulty of
keeping them clean, even with the assistance of summer fallows. They are so
often ploughed wet, from necessity, that a sourness and adhesion are
contracted, which cannot be corrected without exposing it to the hot summer
sun, and reducing it by frequent ploughing and harrowing. No crop can be
substituted in place of fallow, for turnips are destruction itself. Drilled
beans, as is already said, will do well as an assistant to fallow; but however
much this crop may tend to <HI>keep</HI> land clean, that is already in good
order, we apprehend, from the necessity of sowing them early, they will never
answer as a substitute for one of the most radical of all improvements,—a
clean summer fallow.</P>
<P>But want of fallows is not the fault of the Yorkshire husbandry:
there they prevail to a much greater extent than necessary, and, unless where
turnips can be introduced, occasion great drawback upon the farmer's profits.
If good land be fallowed pro∣perly, can it ever be supposed necessary to repeat
it after carry∣ing only wheat and beans? When this practice is too often
re∣peated, it also loses much of its effects, as the superior advan∣tages 
<PB N="65" REF="64"/> arising from a first fallow are known to all farmers: and
while we condemn the system that would throw out the benefi∣cial practice
altogether, we are as decidedly against an unneces∣sary repetition of it.</P>
<P><HI>Sowing down Land for Pasture.</HI>—We have in many
places of this work described the manner in which the ground is sowed down for
pasture, and mentioned that hay-seeds are the grasses most generally sown. The
quality and kind of these hay-seeds are not easily ascertained, for the very
sowers of them in most cases are absolutely ignorant of their properties. To us
it ap∣pears they are sown in a wanton and unnecessary extent, and that good
pasture could be got from sowing grasses of other sorts, the qualities of which
are better known, and which would be easier eradicated when the ground is broke
up for tillage.</P>
<P>The grasses that in our opinion are most profitable to the farmer
for pasture, are white clover, trefoil, and rye grass; per∣haps where sheep
pasture is intended, a small quantity of rib grass is not improper. The
quantities of the above seeds that we recommend for making at once a good and
close bite, are, 12 lb. white clover, 12 lb. trefoil, and one bushel of well
cleaned rye grass for a statute acre. We are much mistaken if these will not at
once fully cover the ground, and from their springing at different periods,
fresh grass is always afforded to the stock. The expence of sowing an acre in
this way, will upon an average of prices be from fifteen to sixteen
shillings.</P>
<P>Where grass is intended for a hay crop, very different manage∣ment
is required. In this case, thick sowing weakens the plants, and deprives them
of their vigour and strength. 14 lb. of red or broad clover, and half a bushel
of rye grass is prefectly sufficient, and with these quantities, we have often
seen as strong grass as could stand. Clover by itself always makes bad hay,
although we are ready to acknowledge, that rye grass is detrimental, if wheat
is intended to succeed. But considering the clover as a crop intended for
eating green, or for making hay, there is a ne∣cessity for giving it a body and
strength, by a small intermixture of rye grass, and the above quantity is
sufficient.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="65"/> It remains to mention that wherever grass
seeds are sown, it is indispensably necessary that the ground be in a proper
state of culture, and reduced as fine and equal as possible, or else the one
half of the seeds will be lost. For want of attending to these precautions,
great loss is often sustained, as not only the crops of grass are rendered
small and scanty, but a failure in this re∣spect is detrimental to the
succeeding rotation.</P>
<P><HI>Drilling Beans and Turnips.</HI>—The present mode of
sowing beans and turnips broad cast is pernicious, and renders two crops, which
are well calculated for cleaning the ground, instru∣ments of its destruction.
Beans and turnips are the only two crops that can be drilled to advantage.
Wheat, barley, and oats are found both better in quality and quantity when sown
broad cast; and the reasons are these.—When drilled, they are too much
exposed to the weather, and are liable to be broke down and thrashed with every
gale. Besides, they tiller or stool as long as any interval is left, which
necessarily causes the grain to be unequal. While we are warm advocates for
drilling and horse∣hoeing beans and turnips, we cannot recommend the practice
farther.</P>
<P>We have reason to suspect that the intricate nature, and
ex∣pensive cost of a number of drill machines, have deterred a num∣ber of
farmers from adopting this mode of husbandry. We venture to affirm, that the
simpler the machines are the better, and that a bean drill, which is made by
every common wright for 7<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> and a turnip one for about
double the price, sowing one row or drill at a time, will be found of more real
utility than all the expensive complicated patent machines in the kingdom.</P>
<P>When beans are drilled, we recommend an interval to be left of 24
or 27 inches, and where turnips are meant as a complete fal∣low, about 30 or 32
inches. These admit a small plough drawn by one horse perfectly well, which,
with the addition of the hand hoe, is the cheapest and most effectual way of
cleaning these crops.</P>
<P>Horse-hoeing beans and turnips has this advantage, that it is the
fault of the farmer, if his fields under these crops, in the 
<PB N="67" REF="66"/> most adverse season, be foul and dirty. It is well known
that beans, from being an open plant at the root, give opportunity to weeds
thriving amongst them, which in a dry season, such as the last, will ruin them
altogether. By horse-hoeing the intervals at proper periods, and running the
hand along the drill, they are constantly kept clean; and a well managed field
of them or tur∣nips will necessarily be as clean, as the same crops in a
garden.</P>
<P><HI>Breaking up the Grass Grounds.</HI>—We have already
men∣tioned that a considerable portion of the West Riding is continu∣ally kept
in grass, and a stranger would be apt to think, from the vigilance with which
it is preserved, that estates were entail∣ed with that burthen upon them. As
this exclusive system is, in our opinion, detrimental to the public, we shall
now attempt to shew that breaking up these grass grounds could in no shape hurt
the proprietor, but on the contrary would materially pro∣mote his interest.</P>
<P>Does ploughing the ground in a proper manner reduce the natural
value of the soil? or, in other words, will it hinder land from carrying grass
when it is laid down again? So far from that, it is often found necessary to
convert pasture into tillage merely, that better crops of grass may be
afterwards produced. Land, when uniformly kept in one course, tires for want of
variety: and a farmer might as well expect his land to carry wheat every year,
by the force of manure, as look for grass of equal value for a continued space
of time. It is found that the two first years of grass, when the land is sown
down properly, afford a greater return than the same number of subsequent
years. They are considerably earlier, therefore of greater value; and from the
youthful vigour of the plants, a large additional quantity of pas∣ture is
procured.</P>
<P>But allowing, for argument sake, that the land when in grass
continues in a progressive state of improvement, still a consider∣able sum is
lost to the proprietor from not ploughing his fields. We hold that land, after
it has lain a certain number of years in grass, is able to pay an extra-rent.
This, by continuing it in <PB N="68" REF="67"/> the same state is totally lost;
because if it were ploughed for some years, and then sown down clean in good
heart, it would carry more grass than ever.</P>
<P>A very great loss is sustained by the public, from the practice of
this exclusive system. It requires no figures to shew that by breaking up land,
at proper intervals, a great deal more corn would be raised, an additional
quantity of manure procured for enriching barren soils, and much employment
consequently to the people at large. These are important matters, and should be
seriously weighed by every proprietor who keeps his estate principally in
grass.</P>
<P>It may be asked, if the grass grounds are broken up, how are
cattle to be fed for supplying the butcher? We answer, by lay∣ing down the old
ploughed fields, which would be as much bene∣fited by a cessation from
ploughing, as the other renovated by it. We apprehend as much grass would be
raised in the way we are describing as ever, while at the same time the
quantity of corn would be greatly increased.</P>
<P>With regard to the western parts of the Riding, where there is at
present nothing but grass, we are dubious whether we can recommend cultivation
by the plough in the same extent. The climate is wet, and corn husbandry must
be precarious. But we are convinced of the propriety of raising as much as is
neces∣sary for supporting the inhabitants. Corn has already been cul∣tivated
there, for all the low fields have at one time or other been ploughed; and we
suppose, the climate would then be simi∣lar to what it is at present. We have
no doubt but that by sow∣ing grain very early, it might all be harvested in
proper time. Fallow wheat might be sown by the end of August, or first of
September, which with Dutch, or Poland oats, would always make an early
harvest. But before any of these rich fields can be broke up, the tithe system
must undergo a change, as it would be a notable affair for a tithe holder to
have a tenth of the weighty crops they would produce. From respectable
au∣thority we learned, that the payment of tithes, was in a great 
<PB N="69" REF="68"/> measure the cause of laying these fields totally in grass,
and that they continue to operate as a prohibitory restriction against breaking
them up.</P>
<P><HI>Planting the Wastes.</HI>—If the wastes were divided, we
are fully convinced that much improvement might be made by plant∣ing Scots firs
and larches upon many parts of them. These kinds of wood are at present held in
little repute, and are indeed scarcely known in the West Riding. As a great
deal of fir wood is at present imported from the Baltic, they might in time
render that in a great measure unnecessary. They would answer for roofing
cottages, for fences, and many other useful purposes. The subject deserves
attention, and we are humbly of opinion that the far greatest part of the moors
in this district can never be improved in any other way.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>We have now finished this Report, in the course of which we have
been under the disagreeable necessity of attacking many practices and customs,
which we think pernicious and destruc∣tive to the improvement of agriculture.
While we have spoken upon these subjects in a style, that may be probably
thought warm, we have never entertained the most distant idea of giving
personal offence. The proprietor may perhaps think at present that by
with-holding leases he gives no discouragement to agri∣culture, and that
covenants are necessary, to prevent his pro∣perty from being injured. We have
attempted to show the per∣nicious consequences these practices have upon
agriculture, and that it is impossible for the farmer to introduce solid
improve∣ments, till these obstacles are removed.</P>
<P>With regard to the tithe holders, they are perhaps of opinion,
that the full value of them is as much their property, as any landed freehold
would be, and therefore may stand justified in their own sight, for a rigorous
collection. We have attempted to prove that a collection in kind, or by an
annual valuation, is <PB N="70" REF="69"/> hurtful to agriculture, by operating
as a tax upon the farmer <HI>pro∣portionally to his merit and abilities,</HI>
and that the public good requires that a general valuation of them should take
place. We have further shewn, that this valuation would not lessen the pre∣sent
amount of the tithes, although it would prevent them from being a continued and
increasing burthen upon the possessors of land; and that a payment in this
manner would not only be conducive to the public good, but also promote the
welfare and utility of the clergy themselves.</P>
<P>With regard to the interests of that useful body of men, the
farmers, we have endeavoured to shew how much their situa∣tion would be
meliorated, and the practice of agriculture im∣proved by the proprietors
granting leases of a proper duration, free of these useless restrictions and
covenants that now sub∣sist in agreements for land, whether annual, or for a
greater number of years.</P>
<P>These things we humbly submit to the consideration of the Board of
Agriculture, and we entertain the sanguine hopes, if the improvements we have
suggested are sanctioned by their approbation, that this sanction will have
great influence in cor∣recting the abuses we have described, and contribute to
im∣prove the husbandry of the West Riding of Yorkshire: by which means the
interest of the landed proprietor will be augmented, the peace and happiness of
the farmer increased, and conse∣quently the public good materially
promoted.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>A very ingenious paper upon the management of cows in the
neighbourhood of London has been laid before the Board of Agriculture by Baron
D'Alton, a foreign nobleman; and from the accurate calculations therein given,
it appears, keeping cows in the house is more profitable husbandry than
pasturing them in the fields, as is commonly done. During our survey of the 
<PB N="71" REF="70"/> West Riding we made repeated inquiries whether any such
prac∣tice prevailed in that district; the result of which were, it was only
done by a few cow-keepers in towns, who had little or no land. By a letter,
received since our return from Mr. Stockdale, at Knaresborough, we were
informed that this practice was com∣mon at Leeds. We therefore wrote to a
gentleman there, de∣siring him to inquire if it was found beneficial. The
following is a copy of his answer.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Leeds, <DATE>Jan. 15, 1794.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>There are a few cows kept in the house all summer, and the way
in which they are managed, is by giving them grass fresh cut, and watering the
ground as the grass comes off, with the urine from the cows. The urine is
preserved by a cistern placed on the outside of the cow house, and is conveyed
to the land at almost all seasons, but the most profitable time for doing it is
March, April, and May; by which means, and the addition of horse dung applied
during the winter months, the field may be cut 4 or 5 times during the season.
I am told 4 acres of land will, in this method, maintain 10 cows; and the
winter they are fed with grains from the brewers, which are very high in price,
being 3 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> per quarter. It will take about four pounds
worth of grains to maintain a cow for the winter months, and two pounds for
grass during the summer: so the expence of a cow for the whole year is about
six pounds.</P>
<P>I kept 13 cows one winter, which were fed upon turnips and oat
straw, and never got a mouthful of hay. They yielded me 30 gallons of milk per
day, which, six years ago, sold upon the spot, to the retailers from Leeds, at
5½ <HI>d.</HI> per gallon. They carried it a mile, and sold it out at
6½ <HI>d.</HI> and 7 <HI>d.</HI> per gallon; but it is now advanced to 8
<HI>d.</HI> and 9 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>I must notice to you, that the taste of the turnip is easily
taken off the milk and butter, by dissolving a little nitre in spring water,
which being kept in a bottle, and a small tea-cup full put among 8 gallons of
milk, when warm from the cow, entirely re∣moves any taste or flavour of the
turnip.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="71"/> In the management of cows, a warm stable is
highly necessary, and the currying them, like horses, not only affords them
plea∣sure, but makes them give their milk more freely. They ought always to be
kept clean, laid dry, and have plenty of good sweet water to drink. I have had
cows giving me 2 gallons of milk at a meal, when within 10 days of calving, and
did not upon trial find any advantage by allowing them to go dry two months
before calving. The average of our cows is about 6 gallons per day after
quitting the calf.</P>
<P>If this statement affords the Board of Agriculture any
in∣formation worthy their notice, I will be happy at being the instrument of
it; and all I have said is from experience. You have my sincere wish for the
laudable work you are engaged in being crowned with success, and I am,
&amp;c.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>In addition to the above very sensible letter, we may add, that
one of us for some years has kept his cows in the house upon red clover and rye
grass during the summer months. They are put out to a small park in the evening
after milking, for the convenience of getting water, and tied up in the house
early in the morning. One acre of clover has been found to go as far in this
way, as two when pastured. More milk is produced, and the quantity of rich dung
made in this method, is supposed to compensate the additional trouble of
cutting and bringing in the grass.</P>

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF THE DIVISION OF THE FOREST OF
KNARESBOROUGH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ROBERT STOCKDALE, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<P>THE Forest of Knaresborough, till the year 1775, consisted of a
great extent of an∣cient inclosed land, comprized within eleven constableries,
or hamlets; to which be∣longed a tract of upwards of 30,000 acres of common,
whereon Knaresborough, and several other towns, not within the eleven
constableries, claimed, and had exercised a right of common, and turbary,
equally with the owners of property within these ele∣ven constableries. This
waste, in its open state, yielded the inhabitants fuel, and pasturage for their
sheep, horses, and stock of young cattle; and some opulent yeo∣manry profited
exceedingly thereby; but to the necessitous cottager and indigent farmer, it
was productive of more inconvenience than advantage; if not to them∣selves, at
least to the public at large, who was by that means deprived in a great
mea∣sure of the exertions of the farmer, and the labour of the cottager and
their families; for it afforded their families a little milk, yet they would
attempt to keep a horse, and a flock of sheep. The first enabled them to stroll
about the country in idleness, and the second, in the course of every three or
four years, were so reduced by the rot, and other disasters, that upon the
whole they yielded no profit.</P>
<P>In 1770, after various struggles, an act was obtained to divide
and inclose this ex∣tensive waste, and the powers thereof committed to no less
than five commissioners, and three surveyors, all or most of them unequal to
the undertaking, from whom both great delay and expence were incurred. After
four years had elapsed, an amend∣ment of this act became necessary, which was
obtained in 1774. Thereby a sixth commissioner was named, who had been
appointed a surveyor by the first act, and who had thought proper to execute
his duty by a deputy. In 1775, the commissioners <PB N="76" REF="74"/> made out
a description of their intended allotments; and in or about the year 1779, they
executed their award, which unfortunately is deficient in every essential
requi∣site: but with all these inconveniences, the generality of proprietors,
to whom allot∣ments were made, and particularly the small ones, set about a
spirited line of im∣provement. The poor cottager and his family exchanged their
indolence for active industry, and obtained extravagant wages; and hundreds
were induced to offer their labour from distant quarters; labourers of every
denomination, carpenters, joiners, smiths, and masons, poured in, and met with
constant employment. And though before the allotments were set out, several
riots had happened; the scene was now quite changed; for with all the foreign
assistance, labour kept extravagantly high, and the work was executed
defectively, and in a few years many inclosures almost prostrate, and of course
required making a second time. All these circumstances, taken together, were a
heavy load upon the allotments, and in general rendered them very dear
purchases. The forest, however, got in a great measure cultivated, and rendered
a wonderful increase of product to the public, though at the expence of
in∣dividuals. A public, or turnpike road was opened through the centre of the
forest, which opened an easy communication between Knaresborough and Skipton in
Cra∣ven, and the manufacturing towns in the north-east of Lancashire. And
though scarce a single cart was before seen in the market of Skipton, not less
than 200 are weekly attendant on that market at present.</P>
<P>In consequence the product is increased beyond conception, the
rents more than trebled, and population advanced in a very high degree; indeed
the lands, both an∣cient and those newly inclosed, being exonerated from tithe,
a full scope was given to spirited cultivation; and to the credit of small
proprietors, they took the lead, and brought their small shares first into the
completest state of cultivation. I wish it was in my power to say as much of
the large proprietors, but facts will not warrant it. On the contrary, I know
of very few men of independent fortune, or others to whom large tracts were
either assigned as their stipulated share, or acquired by purchase, under the
clause for sale to defray the expence of the act, who have made any
im∣provement, or scarcely effectually ring-fenced their property.</P>
<P>Many impediments prevented their activity; first, what was to be
done must be committed to the care of servants, or agents; secondly, the
extravagance of wages, by reason of the want of inhabitants; and above all, the
impossibility of letting large tracts as farms, where it must be a series of
years before any returns could be expected, or even winter provision obtained
for their working horses. These obstacles operated to a total neglect, or
desertion; and in consequence, large tracts indeed at this hour are in their
wild uncultivated state.</P>
<P>It I may be allowed to offer my sentiments how to turn these
tracts to better ad∣vantage, I should advise building a number of cottages,
with suitable small outbuild∣ings, and laying to each not more than 10 acres of
land; tempt individuals by suffering them to live rent-free for the first seven
years, but obliging them to break up two acres annually, till the whole was
improved, then fix a reasonable rent; and add 10 acres more for the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>me term, and conditions; and so
proceed gradually, till the whole of such part, as would admit of cultivation,
was gone through. The land thus improved, would be considered by the
inhabitants as the work of their own crea∣tion, and nothing but cruel treatment
by their landlords would drive them away. In <PB N="77" REF="75"/> a few years
population would improve, and that once locally obtained, every other
difficulty would vanish.</P>
<P>Several considerable tracts of this forest have fallen to my
lot, both as assign∣ments in right of former property, and by purchase; most of
them were of the worst strata, being either confined bogs, or cold steril clay,
mixed with white sand, and the surface pared off for fuel. Little profit could
be expected from such kind of pro∣perty; but nevertheless, I attempted
improvements, which many condemned me for; and I frankly confess, my
expectations were not gratified, though I still flatter my∣self my efforts are
not wholly useless, as my errors may probably enable others to be∣nefit, by
shunning the like plan.</P>
<P>I will state the means I first took, and then point out the
errors, or propriety of them; and afterwards give a short account of my present
mode of management.</P>
<P>When I first took possession of the clay parts, so injured as
stated, by being pared for fuel, I was eager to get my ring-fences completed,
and thereby was led to give ex∣travagant wages, and by employing strangers had
them badly executed; these men wanting subsistence-money, while completing a
contract, were generally in advance before their labour, and rarely finished
them, even in their own defective mode, and the work, particularly stone
fences, was to do over again; this was folly. I then pur∣chased oxen to plough
with, and ploughed as deep as possible; by which means stones were ploughed up,
where none were expected, which would have made the fences, and saved a great
deal of the former expence of leading from a distance. Had I now to begin, I
should first plough as deep as I could with oxen, collect the stones raised
thereby, and make a broad case of a fence, at least 30 inches, and raise the
wall no higher than the stones would serve to surround the allotment; and rest
satisfied therewith till the next ploughing, whereby more stones would arise,
which I would use in raising the wall gradually to its proper height; by this
means, the walls would be more substantial, and raised at one-third of the
expence.</P>
<P>After the first deep ploughing, I left it in that state a year,
exposed to frost and heat, then harrowed well, and ploughed across, and added
three chaldron, or nearly 100 bushels of lime per acre, to make the land fall,
and correct the acidity; and in the spring following sowed with oats, after a
third ploughing; and the next year, pease or vetches; then fallowed, and limed
as before, and took two crops to each fal∣low, so limed; until I found the
repetition of lime did harm, instead of being of ad∣vantage. In place of this,
I now take one crop to each fallow, have better crops, and save two guineas per
acre by withholding the lime, which cost me 14 <HI>s.</HI> per chaldron; by
this means I get only six crops in twelve years, but which produce more than
eight crops by the other mode, keep the land in better condition, and save
eight guineas, before expended on lime. Probably lime may be again necessary at
a future day; but I am confident, that with some sorts of lime, you may use it
till the land will neither produce corn nor grass. The quality of lime varies
much; we have two sorts, one burnt near Ferrybridge, and another at and near
Knaresborough; where the heaps of the first are laid, there is always the best
crop; but where the heaps of the other are laid, you will frequently find the
land steril for several years. The first sort is burnt from compact strong
stone, the other from a porous marly stone. At proper intervals I sow with
grass seeds, eat them the first year with sheep, and lay all my fold-yard
compost on the grass, except where some small parcels that will grow 
<PB N="78" REF="76"/> turnips demand it. But this kind of clay land will neither
answer well long in til∣lage, nor in grass, but must be frequently changed. By
treating this cold clay soil in this mode, building small houses and barns, and
working with oxen, I have improved the land so as to be able to let it at 10
<HI>s.</HI> per acre; but I must observe, that had it been titheable, the tithe
alone would have utterly precluded my efforts, for the value of the tithe would
often have been more than my profit.</P>
<P>In making my subdivisions, I divided them into 10 inclosures as
nearly as possible, and the year preceding the planting quick wood, or white
thorns, I prepared the ground, where the fences were intended, by frequent
ploughings, and planted pota∣toes. In the autumn, after these were gathered, I
made a ditch, breasted the caw with stones, and planted the wood behind the
caw, taking care to have the ditch on the higher side of the fence, so as to
intercept the water before it reaches the roots of my quick-wood; and as warmth
and shelter are desirable attainments in all high exposed situations, within my
fences I make a border plantation about 20 feet wide, fence this off with
quick-wood, and also fill my subdivision fences with forest trees most adapted
to the soil. For though these may ultimately prove injurious both to the fences
and the land, yet when that begins to be the case, they are easily taken down,
and serve for stakes and bindings, when the hedges require cutting. As water is
not always to be had in every situation where it is wanted, I make a square, or
round pond, where the fences intersect one another, so as to make one pond
serve to supply four closes, thus: 
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>plan of agricultural inclosures</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>By this means, I can either plough or pasture any close without
inconvenience, and if the strata be ever so open or porous, yet other ponds are
easily made retentive, by digging them deep, then laying a covering of lime, or
lime ashes, at the bottom and sides, which will prevent worms and moles
working; afterwards puddle it well with earth and water, and when that is got
dry, pave with small stones the inlets out of each close for the cattle to
drink at; and then open ditches to let water into the ponds; and if well
executed, they will afford a due supply of water during any dry season. A farm
of this unkindly soil, and high situation, will turn to best account in having
it occupied in regular courses of one-third arable, one-third meadow, and the
remainder pasture, stocked with young breeding stock; and by changing the land
from meadow to pasture, and pasture to arable in due succession, and always
win∣tering as much or more stock than you can support in summer, you will of
course raise considerable portions of dung, and thereby ultimately improve the
soil. This <PB N="79" REF="77"/> plan is, however, to be far exceeded in rapid
improvement where inhabitants abound, so as to enable you to let your property
in small parcels, by building small, yet such buildings as are calculated to
answer the purpose of any established manufactory.</P>
<P>In the cultivation of my boggy allotments, I was equally
erroneous in my first out∣set; for I rushed hastily to effect a drainage, and
pursued the advice and plan of one very well versed in that operation, where
the defects were only surface water, or day springs; my drains were judiciously
placed, well cut, properly filled, and ample bot∣tom apertures left; but
unfortunately the nature of the springs or water was of the same hard
incrustinating quality as the dropping well at Knaresborough, and this soon
adhered to the sides, and every obstructing particle within the drains, so as
to block them up; I was then obliged to open them, and suffer them to remain
open, at least for a considerable time; even some of them yet emit such hard
water as not to allow of covering. This occasioned much expence, and some
delay; but having got the surface water off, I pared and burnt, and took rape
or turnip, and a succes∣sion of oats and fallow, till I could get it into a
state for grass; and then I sowed such parts as were become firm by draining,
with hay seeds, and a species of clover called cow grass, being our native
honeysuckle grass, which is perennial, and having a solid stem, does not
contain so much fixed air as red clover, and consequently never blows
cattle.</P>
<P>In this state it has remained eight or ten years, is very good
pasturage, and will even feed a Scotch bullock. Such parts as were too boggy to
be totally corrected, I have made into willow garths, and plantations of other
aquatics, which thrive tolerably well; and in a few years I have no doubt will
yield considerable profit. I still keep draining them where defects appear; and
when I am fully convinced the covered drains will not require opening again,
and that the land will bear the opera∣tion of the plough, I will turn the
swarth down, roll, and then sow with oats before I harrow, afterwards harrow
the seeds in, and roll again. The next autumn, winter fallow, and in the
succeeding spring prepare the land for turnips; and in the year following, if
the land is sufficiently clean, sow oats and hay seeds, cow grass, and white
clover, and then convert it to pasturage.</P>
<P>When the land, which is of a loose black earth, was last in
turnips, it happened to be a very frosty hard winter, yet I observed that the
turnips that grew thereon were less affected by the weather, and lasted good
longer in the spring, than any that grew on much better soils; and this I have
since often noticed on land of the same quality in other situations.</P>

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF THE VALE OF SKIPTON. IN A LETTER FROM A GENTLEMAN
IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Nov. 9th, 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would have given me particular pleasure, as a sincere
well-wisher to your under∣taking, if I could have acquitted myself more
successfully in the inquiries you ho∣noured me with; but I shall give you the
best information in my power.</P>
<P>With regard to the ancient state of this vale, I do not find,
upon inquiry, that there has been any material alteration or improvement for
the last century or more: in some parts of Craven, though not near this town, I
understand that, even within the last forty years, there was a considerable
portion of land in tillage; the ploughing was then performed by four or six
oxen, and one or two horses; and I am informed that mode of husbandry answered
very well. Craven was then famous for a breed of long horned cattle,
particularly oxen; but since the introduction of Scotch cattle and grazing into
the country, the long horned breed, and of course the tillage, has been
neglected. One cause of this is the easy expence that attends this mode of
hus∣bandry; with one servant, and two horses, a farmer can very conveniently
manage seven or eight hundred acres of land; indeed, most of the grazing farms
in this vale are very large, often three or four are united under one
occupier.</P>
<P>The Earl of Thanet is the principal proprietor of land in
Skipton; and, I am told, is not willing that his fine land should be ploughed;
but it would certainly be a great advantage to the neighbourhood, if a proper
mixture of grazing and tillage could be introduced; for though the country is
not, or ever will be populous, while the pre∣sent mode of husbandry and
monopolizing farms prevail, yet corn is generally higher in Craven than in most
parts of the kingdom, because so very little is produced. If you suggest to
them, that the uplands may be kept in tillage; the reply is, that they are so
much exposed to mists, and the situation so cold, that corn, particularly
wheat, cannot feed or ripen. This may be in part just; but the stronger reason
with them seems to be, that the uplands are very useful to them upon their
present plan, to pre∣pare the lean cattle for the better pastures; which some
say, would be too rich for them in that state; nor would their improvement, at
first, be equal to such keeping.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="79"/> The extent of the Vale of Skipton cannot be
accurately ascertained; indeed, a very small part bears that name, being
generally included in the vale of the river Air, which extends from Leeds, in a
north-west direction, to the source of the river, about thirty-five miles, is
upon the average about a mile broad, in some places more, yet not so much (I
think) as to add a quarter to the average. Grazing is the general mode of
occupation in this vale, except in the neighbourhood of the manufacturing
towns, where convenience will command a higher rent than the grazier can afford
to pay. Six pounds per statute acre, and sometimes more, will be given for land
in such situations:—grazing will not answer to half that price.</P>
<P>The greatest improvement I hear of is in the mode of draining,
which is now done with stones above and below, and walled with them on each
side: the price of this work for a yard deep, is about 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6
<HI>d.</HI> per rood of seven yards, including the stones, a cart load of which
will complete a rood, and is worth about 3 <HI>d.</HI> at the quarry. There is
likewise a kind called a shoulder drain, practicable only in clay lands, which
is made by using a narrower pointed spade at the bottom, which leaves a kind of
shelf, or shoulder, on each side, to prevent the earth with which it is filled,
from falling to the bottom: the uppermost spadeful is first laid in with the
turf downwards, it is then filled with the mould; the surplus (as there is
always some) is either made into a compost with lime, or spread immediately
upon the land. The price of this sort of draining is about 6 <HI>d.</HI> per
rood, at a yard deep; and so on in proportion. The drains, before these
abovementioned were introduced, were usually covered with brush-wood, or
perhaps straw or rushes.</P>
<P>It is worthy of notice, as it appears to me of great service to
the land, as well as very profitable to the occupier, that most of the
principal graziers take all their stock out of some of their best pastures in
the beginning of July, and put nothing in them till about Michaelmas, when they
are equal or superior to the best fog; indeed they call this, fogging their
pastures. The favourite grazing stock here, are the black Scotch cattle, some
sheep; but on the lowlands very few, and on the uplands and moors not very
numerous:—it is much to be wished that the propagation of this useful and
profitable animal was more attended to.</P>
<P>Price of labour. A man servant about ten guineas per year, with
board and wash∣ing in his master's house; a woman about five guineas, with the
same; day labourers in husbandry about 2 <HI>s.</HI> or 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6
<HI>d.</HI> per day, finding their own victuals: about ten years ago, 1
<HI>s.</HI> or 1 <HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> was the common price; the advance
owing to the intro∣duction of the cotton manufactory into a country so little
populous. They work from six to six in summer, and from eight to dark in
winter.</P>
<P>Price of provisions for the last year: beef, mutton, veal, and
pork, about 4½<HI>d.</HI> per pound, of 16 ounces; butter about 1
<HI>s.</HI> or 1 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> per pound, of 22 ounces: wheat about
8 <HI>s.</HI> per Winchester bushel: oats 28 or 30 <HI>s.</HI> per quarter.</P>
<P>The climate and weather are unfavourable: we have sometimes very
cold east winds in the spring for three months, often to the middle or end of
May; in autumn we have very often heavy and continued rains from the west,
owing to our situation among so many hills; from the same cause, we have
frequent thunder storms in summer.</P>
<P>Our roads are very much improved of late; the canal which is
carried through this valley, seems to have taught us the possibility of making
tolerably level roads, even in <PB N="82" REF="80"/> a mountainous country;
several excellent ones have been made within the last five years; the materials
chiefly lime-stone, broken to about the size of an egg.</P>
<P>Tithes are generally collected in kind, and are very reluctantly
and ill paid. Since the introduction of grazing into the country, they are
reduced in an astonishing de∣gree; the lands which are most profitable to the
occupier, are least, or indeed not at all so to the clergyman;—he must
either submit to this, or involve himself in a te∣dious and expensive law suit,
for agistment tithe, perhaps against an obstinate and powerful combination of
the farmers and land-owners. It is the opinion of the most intelligent people
here, that the present mode of collecting tithes is one principal cause of the
high price of corn. Large quantities are continued in grass, which would be
ploughed to advantage, if a certain and general commutation for tithes could be
established. I wish the above hints may be of any service to your business; if
you think me capable of further information, I shall always be happy to
contribute my assistance to so laudable an undertaking. I am, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Information received from MESSRS. TWEEDAL and NOBLE, Stewards
to Mr. BEAUMONT, relative to his Woods and Sheep:—trans∣mitted by Mr.
THOMAS HAGUE, Farmer at Bullcliffe.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Sheep.</HI> The Herefordshire sheep have had a better
pasture than what the Shetland sheep have had, but they have not made so much
improvement as might have been ex∣pected, nor have they fatted their lambs so
well as what a Peniston ewe does upon the same ground. We are of opinion, that
with a Herefordshire tup, and a Peniston ewe, there would be a good stock
produced for this country; of which we are making a trial: it is also thought
that their wool will be very good.</P>
<P>The Shetland sheep have improved a good deal in size, but do not
make themselves fat; nor has their wool improved in fineness, but has grown
longer. We are of opi∣nion that these sheep are more adapted for mountainous
countries, or drier land than what it is about this neighbourhood.</P>
<P><HI>Woods.</HI> It is the custom in this part of the country,
when a wood is ready to go down, to set out, and leave as follows, viz.</P>
<P> <PB N="83" REF="81"/>Every 21 years. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Poles, supposed to be left for a future fall, being
judged to be 20 years old, which in 40 years more, it is supposed, would be
timber trees,—left on an acre upon an average — 180</ITEM>
<ITEM>Trees, supposed to be 40 years old, left on an average
per acre — 10</ITEM>
<ITEM>Timber trees, supposed to be 60 years old at the time
they are ready to go down, judged to be taken down on an average per acre
— 10</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Reasons why the underwood is not kept cut quite down, viz. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>The brush or underwood would not turn to any profit,
except that it stands for 21 years, and then it is taken down along with the
timber, for different uses; such as binding hedges, making riddles, burning for
charcoal, and many other uses. The trees that are left are at such a distance
from one another, that they do not prevent any thing from growing, but what
will pay in twenty years time: but if the brush or underwood was kept quite cut
down, it would neither be so well for the timber and younger wood; that method
having been tried, it was found that neither the wood nor the bark made so much
improvement, owing to its being starved in the bottom, when the underwood was
not admitted to grow.</ITEM>
<ITEM> A tree left for a future fall, is chiefly one that grows
from its own stem, and what we call a lording, and perhaps only forty years
old, which, to stand twenty years more, in general pays better than to take it
down at that age.</ITEM>
<ITEM> It is supposed, when a fall of wood is ready to go down,
that with the poles, under∣wood, &amp;c. it is worth fifty-five pounds per
acre, upon an average.</ITEM>
<ITEM> The value of wood set out to stand for a future fall, is
judged at the time of its being left, to be upon an average worth eighteen
pounds per acre.</ITEM>
<ITEM> The woodlands in general, if they should be quite
cleared of all the wood, under∣wood, &amp;c. and put into cultivation, which
would be at an enormous expence, it is sup∣posed, would only upon an average be
worth five shillings per acre.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It remains to be added, as another reason for taking down wood
in the manner we do, that by this method we have wood for all sorts of
customers; and as such can dispose of it to more advantage and convenience. The
small wood is used for laths, baskets, puncheons for coal pits, hedge stakes,
&amp;c. the larger for husbandry imple∣ments of every description; the large
timber for house-carpenters, ship-carpenters, coopers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Leases.</HI>—It is the general opinion that a notice
for a tenant to quit a farm ought to be two years, instead of six months, which
is the practice in this part of the country; and it is thought it would be more
proper, that at the time a notice is given by the landlord or tenant, that the
farm should be looked over immediately, and a valuation made of the same, so
that a farm should be kept in the same condition for the two years, as what it
was at the time the notice was given; and that there should be an ad∣ditional
allowance for land which has been laid down for one, two, or three years, if
the same has been pastured with sheep or cattle; for at present there is not
any allow∣ance made for laying down the land, but only for what tillage has
been laid thereon; and if the land has been once mown since manuring, then an
allowance is only made for half tillage; but should the land have been mown
twice after manuring, then not any allowance at all is made to the tenant.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER FROM DR. HUNTER, OF YORK. DATED DEC. 6. 1793.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the pleasure of seeing you at York, I remember that
our conversation turned upon the use of rape dust as a manure, which the
farmers round Aberford, in the West Riding of this county, employ for their
barley and wheat crops; their land is a thin lime-stone. The rent per acre is
not considerable, but lies at such a dis∣tance from any large town, that if it
were not for this article, the farmers could not procure manure sufficient for
their corn lands; the quantity used is two quarters for barley, and three
quarters for wheat. It is sown by hand, and harrowed in with the grain. If rain
falls within a few weeks after sowing the barley, the crop is generally good;
but if no rain falls the benefit of the dust is lost, without any advantage
being gained in the succeeding crop. For wheat it is always a certain manure,
in consequence of the wet season that follows the sowing of that grain. The
price of rape dust is 14 <HI>s.</HI> to 19 <HI>s.</HI> per quarter; but from
the improvements made in the mechanical powers employed at the mills, the dust
is not so good as formerly. I do not think that suf∣ficient attention is paid
to top dressings when the soil is light. A large quantity may be obtained by
putting sawdust on the floors of the necessaries; which should also be
receptacles for excrementitious substances of all kinds. In large towns,
sawdust can be obtained at a low price. Moor earth may be employed as a
substitute.</P>
<P>My numerous avocations in the line of my profession deprive me
of the satisfaction of gaining much practical knowledge in agriculture. What
little I know may be found in the "Georgical Essays," published a few years
ago. I am, &amp;c.</P>
<P>N. B. In the neighbourhood of Tadcaster, it is said that the
rape dust is as good in quality as ever. It was formerly bought for 7
<HI>s.</HI> but that is now worth 18 <HI>s.</HI> or 19 <HI>s.</HI> per quarter.
It will answer for two or three following crops. Barley requires four quar∣ters
per acre, which should be thrown upon the land early in the spring before the
barley is sown, if soon after Christmas the better. Three quarters per acre is
sufficient for wheat, to be laid on when the wheat is sown.</P>
<P>The rent of land, where rape dust is used, is in general from
ten shillings and six∣pence to eighteen shillings per acre.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM WM. PAYNE. ESQ. OF FRICKLEY NEAR
DONCASTER. DATED NOV. 30, 1793.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LAST week saw your queries on the state of agriculture in the
West Riding, in∣serted in the Doncaster paper, and have taken the liberty of
answering them, accord∣ing to your request, in the address that precedes them.
And having understood, that the indefatigable President of the Board of
Agriculture was desirous of obtaining a <HI>detailed</HI> survey of England, I
shall principally confine my replies to your inquiries to the parish in which I
reside, Frickley cum Clayton, and the extensive and populous one adjoining it
northward, South Kirkby. Yet these answers will, I believe, <HI>generally</HI>
apply to the whole tract of country lying between the market-towns of
Doncaster, Rotheram, Pontefract, Barnsley, and Thorne; in divers parts of which
district I have resided, and practised agriculture, as a freeholder; not having
been without the means and inclination of acquiring some intelligence in many
departments of its rural economy. As a true friend to the solid prosperity of
my country, I am a sin∣cere well wisher to its agriculture, as the only sound
basis of its real and permanent interest; and though I do not wish manufacture
in general to be depreciated, yet I am convinced, that if a considerable
portion of the public industry and capital which for some years past has been
applied to the manufacture of foreign materials, had instead thereof, been
employed in the cultivation of our extensive wastes, the profits on the
<HI>whole</HI> of such employment to the <HI>public</HI> would have been
immensely superior. On this view of the subject, the institution of a Board of
Agriculture may be impor∣tant to the national welfare, if the public spirited
activity of true patriotism abounds in its members; but if there is not a
degree of that liberal principle, sufficient to pro∣mote, and obtain some
modification of certain impediments to the extension of our agriculture, the
attention of the Board to any other means of exciting and encouraging rural
industry will ultimately be contracted, by the mere expedients of the day, and
the labours of its useful members prove in vain.</P>
<P>The soil of this district is of three kinds, with their
varieties, viz. 1st. A dry loamy hazle soil, on a rock of soft gritstone; 2d. A
wet or clay soil, which abounds most <PB N="86" REF="84"/> here. 3d. a fine dry
loam, on a rock of lime-stone. I think the climate more favour∣able and mild
than in some other parts of the county, with less rain.</P>
<P>Nearly three-fourths of the lands are employed in tillage, the
other fourth part is chiefly clay land, meadow, and pasture: but the practice
of ploughing old swards, and laying new ones, prevails on all the soils. Red
and white clover, trefoil, with common hay seeds, not of the best sort, and
sainfoin on the lime-stone soils, are cul∣tivated as grasses. The common
rotation of crops, on the drier soils, is: 1st. turnips, 2d. barley, 3d. clover
or beans, 4th. wheat; on the wet or clay soils, 1st. fallow, 2d. wheat, 3d.
oats, 4th. wheat; sometimes the course is, 1st. fallow, 2d. barley, or oats,
3d. clover or beans, 4th. wheat; which is generally esteemed the better course;
in a few instances, potatoes and cabbages are cultivated in lieu of
turnips.</P>
<P>Summer fallowing is universally practised on the dry soils; and
good spring dress∣ings on the drier ones, for turnips, &amp;c. Turnips are
generally sown broadcast; but the expertness of our hoers sufficiently
compensates for the want of drilling. That excellent mode of cultivation, the
hoeing of turnips, has been practised in this part of the country upwards of
thirty years; being introduced about that time into the township of Wath upon
Derne, by that excellent cultivator, Wm. Payne of New∣hill Grange, my late
honoured father; as it was to the county, by that truly patriotic nobleman, and
benefactor to his country, the late Marquis of Rockingham. Yet I am sorry to
observe, this most beneficial practice is still much neglected in some parts of
this Riding, particularly in the neighbourhood of Thorne and Hatfield.</P>
<P>The manures used here are, 1st. farm-yard rotten muck; from
eight to twelve 3-horse cart load of which are applied to the statute acre of
fallow; 2d. ashes, about eight loads per acre; 3d. soot, chiefly as a top
dressing for wheat, from twenty to thirty bushels per ditto; 4th. Bone dust and
horn shavings, from three to five quarters per ditto; 5th. dove manure, ditto;
6th. soap ashes, ditto; 7th. rape-dust, ditto. Lime is gene∣rally employed as a
manure for the first fallow after an old lay, apparently with suc∣cess, at the
rate of two or three chaldrons per acre. My own practice for turnips is, one
chaldron of lime well mixed with the soil, and six loads of fresh muck, or
three quarters of dove manure per acre, with full success; this compound
manuring, I think, insures its due operation on the soil in most cases better
than the simple one, and has many other advantages. The sheepfold is not used
here, except on turnips, which are generally eaten on the land by sheep.</P>
<P>The common sort of both broad and narrow wheeled carts, with
three or four horses, are generally used, with a few one-horse carts; scarcely
any other plough is seen than the common single one. The work is almost
entirely performed by horses; very little use is made of oxen at present;
though where they are employed, they are found to answer very well, and I have
no doubt of their superiority over the heavy draft horses in point of
<HI>real</HI> utility to the farmer. I have used a pair of oxen several years
in harness like that of the horses, working them at the plough and on the road,
in every respect as we use our heavy draft horses; and as far as I can judge,
they are equal to them for <HI>use,</HI> though the pride of the drivers will
never allow it. However, in the stage of fattening them, we are all agreed,
that <HI>their beef</HI> is preferable to the <HI>carrion</HI> of an old horse.
The advantage to the community of working oxen on farms is beyond dispute, or
calculation.</P>
<P>A considerable proportion of the arable land is uninclosed, to
the great obstruction <PB N="87" REF="85"/> of agricultural improvement; the
advantages of inclosing are numerous and import∣tant. The liberal occupier of
<HI>inclosed</HI> land, whose mind is actively employed in the improvement and
increase of his produce, with whom innovation has no fault, but when it is
useless, this man on <HI>inclosed</HI> land has not the <HI>vis inertiae</HI>
of his stupid neighbour to contend with, before he can commence any alteration
in his manage∣ment, that he is clearly convinced will be to his advantage; he
is completely master of his land, which in its open state is scarcely <HI>half
his own.</HI> This is strongly evident in the cultivation of turnips, or other
vegetables for the winter consumption of cattle; they are constantly cultivated
in inclosures, when they are never thought of in the open fields in some parts;
and I know no township in this Riding, except that of Wath upon Derne, where
the turnips are cultivated in any degree of perfection in open fields. At that
place, they have long been wisely unanimous on the management of their common
fields, and in selling the whole turnip crop by a valuation to a person
engaging to stock them entirely, with sheep on the land: but even
<HI>there</HI> they cannot apply their own produce to the improvement of their
<HI>own</HI> stock, nor have they it in their power to vary their management by
the introduction of any grasses for more than one crop in their rotation; both
essential articles, when the improvement of live stock, parti∣cularly sheep, is
in contemplation; this argument for inclosure might be very amply dilated on,
were I writing a treatise instead of a letter, for it is clearly of importance
to the cause.</P>
<P>Common fields are frequent; the difference of value at present
between common field, and inclosed land of similar quality, is about one-third
greater in favour of the latter; but if the spirit of improvement was a little
more awakened, this difference would be greatly increased.</P>
<P>There are large tracts of waste land in the neighbourhood; I may
extend this re∣mark to the whole county; lands now utterly lost to the
community, even in this rich and populous Riding; and be it mentioned to the
utter disgrace of every thing in the country, that after a long period of
years, in which this island has depended on foreigners for a part of its
necessary consumption, these lands are still waste; they are a complete
nuisance to every occupier, who has the misfortune to border upon them; whose
inclosures are certainly exposed to the inroads of their pining inhabi∣tants,
which you scarcely <HI>guess</HI> to be <HI>sheep,</HI> but for the bits of
ragged wool they car∣ry on their backs; the <HI>feats of activity</HI> of these
animals are such, that no fence can prevent their performing them. These wastes
are certainly capable of every improve∣ment by inclosure, which is their
<HI>sine qua non.</HI></P>
<P>The rate of wages is low, the price of necessaries considered;
and hands for the purposes of agriculture, in its present imperfect state, are
not wanting.</P>
<P>Paring and burning are practised generally on the breaking up of
old lays, the ex∣pence of which is from 16 <HI>s.</HI> to 21 <HI>s.</HI> per
acre.</P>
<P>Proper attention is paid to the draining of <HI>arable</HI>
lands, but I cannot so fully an∣swer for it in other respects.</P>
<P>Few leases are granted, and I rather think few are asked for;
the nature of the covenants between landlord and tenant, has a general
reference to law and custom, which secure to the landlord quiet entry on due
notice, with recovery of damages if any be done to the farm; and to the tenant
on quitting, a fair valuation of his pro∣perty and labour, in the ground; as
fallows, crops, manure, &amp;c. &amp;c. being part of his <PB N="88" REF="86"/>
<HI>stock</HI> in <HI>trade.</HI> It is an article essential to a good and
spirited agriculture, and which cannot be too much insisted on, that the farmer
be scrupulously allowed on quitting his farm a fully and fairly appraised
valuation of his <HI>stock</HI> in <HI>trade.</HI> It forms a security and bond
of entire confidence, equally to landlord and tenant, a security which sets all
leases, parchments, bonds, and seals at defiance; it secures to the landlord
the payment of his just demands, with a certain improvement of his es∣tate: and
to the <HI>tenant</HI> an easy mind, under the application of his ingenuity,
indus∣try, and cash, to the prospect of increasing his produce, and
ameliorating his farm. I wish this matter was more attended to; I have seen
many painful deviations from jus∣tice in this respect, to the great injury of
the <HI>cause.</HI> An act of the legislature might probably extend this
<HI>real</HI> benefit, and promote the improvement of the lands already
inclosed, more than <HI>millions</HI> expended in the way of premium,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>There is no other obstacle to improvement but the payment of
tithes in kind; an obstacle, the effects of which upon agriculture might be
much diminished, if not <HI>en∣tirely removed,</HI> if the Members of the Board
could unite their labours in so important a cause, with a sincere zeal and
regard for justice, and the religion of Christ. The ob∣stacles to the
improvement and inclosure of waste lands, in many places, amount nearly to a
<HI>prohibition;</HI> viz. 1st. The tithes, the dislike of which, with the
freeholders, &amp;c. makes a very difficult commutation, the absolute condition
of their concurrence. 2dly. Manorial claims and powers. 3dly. The heavy expence
and trouble of obtain∣ing acts of the legislature. To which may be added, the
caprice, <HI>partial</HI> interest, and disinclinatton to all improvement of
some of the claimants in many cases. All these obstacles might be much lessened
by a law, specifying and <HI>explaining</HI> the claims, and <HI>limiting</HI>
the <HI>powers</HI> of tithe and manorial proprietors, in such manner, that
<HI>their sim∣ple opposition</HI> should not hang <HI>in terrorem</HI> over the
very threshold of every such inclo∣sure; and also <HI>facilitating</HI> and
<HI>encouraging</HI> such applications to the legislature; per∣haps a general
act of inclosure upon a good plan might be a wise and seasonable mea∣sure to
liberate the <HI>active improvers</HI> from the torpid dominion of indolence
and stu∣pidity; however the government can scarcely do wrong in this matter,
except by <HI>suf∣fering</HI> the <HI>wastes</HI> to remain as they are.</P>
<P>Entirely owing to one or all of the obstacles I have mentioned,
very few indeed of inclosing bills have passed these twenty years, in the whole
district comprised be∣tween the towns I mentioned above, notwithstanding the
value of the lands, and the great scarcity and smallness of farms; in the few
instances that have occurred, their beneficial consequences to the stock of
public industry and produce have been con∣spicuous.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACTS FROM A LETTER WRITTEN BY A FARMER IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD OF PONTEFRACT—DATED DEC. 14, 1793.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE land betwixt Doncaster and Ferrybridge, is chiefly
lime-stone, or gravelly soil. All along the road there are many open fields,
which are capable of great improve∣ment, by inclosing, sowing grass-seeds, and
pasturing with sheep.</P>
<P>The present tenants are in general poor, and the farms small;
poverty causes a kind of stupidity to take possession of them; and I have often
spent my time in attempt∣ing to convince them of their errors; but though many
of them may be convinced, it is not in their power to get out of the old mode,
for want of the one thing needful.</P>
<P>The lands I allude to, are chiefly in tillage, the labour of
which, and the necessary manure eats the poor tenant up. I beg leave to refer
you to the letter above-mentioned for my opinions upon this head.</P>
<P>Westward of this road, we have useful land, that can feed cattle
and breed good sheep. Mr. Sayle has done much good in these respects; some of
us are following him as fast as we can in the Dishley breed; but he has got the
lead, and I wish him success, for he deserves it.</P>
<P>Common hay-seeds are going out of fashion with the best farmers,
and clovers and rye grass daily gain ground. Sainfoin is very useful in barren
or poor lands, and in good seasons, as great crops of it are produced, as we
can have of other grasses upon our most fruitful soils: happy it is for the
occupiers of such land, it was found out. We have a very indifferent breed of
cattle. If gentlemen would send good bulls amongst their tenants, and let them
serve their cows <HI>gratis,</HI> it would, I think, be the only probable means
of attaining success in this most essential point.</P>
<P>There is no land watered here, but many situations are well
adapted for that pur∣pose. I myself have 30 or 40 acres, which I have long
wished to float, but as I have no lease, the expence deters me. I have been at
Dishley several times, and am well sa∣tisfied as to the utility of watering
grass land. I have had thoughts of applying to Mr. Bakewell for a man to
superintend the work. He is so great a friend to the pub∣lic, that I make no
doubt but he would readily do any thing to forward such im∣provements; but as I
have already said, the expence deters me.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="88"/> The succession of crops we have after
fallows, is barley, clover, and wheat. Tur∣nips are taken wherever the land is
proper for them; but we have not much of that kind hereabouts. Upon strong
lands, we sow wheat after fallow, then beans, and con∣clude with wheat or oats.
Tares are now coming in fashion.</P>
<P>Oxen are not much used for work here, and never will become
general; they are thought too slow by the active farmer; though I approve much
of them, think∣ing the question of them, and horses, to be an essential one, as
<HI>Mr. Cully justly observes.</HI></P>
<P>There are many fields open over the country, which would be far
more valuable if inclosed; also several common wastes, to which the same
observations will apply.</P>
<P>The advantages arising from inclosing are obvious, by an
increase of labour, and an increase of food, both of which are for the public
good. It produces disadvantages to none, unless it be a few individuals. In the
village where I live, and where we have had no inclosure bills, the increase of
poors rates has been incredible. I am not very old, and can remember the time,
when we had only one poor woman upon us at 6 <HI>d.</HI> a week; but for these
some years back, the expence of supporting the poor has been from £ 150
to £ 180 a year; and this chiefly paid by tenants not renting above
£ 1,000 all together.</P>
<P>Wages are much advanced. I have two labourers, which cost me not
less than £ 60 a year: in short, the expence of labour is become
unsupportable. Draining is used often among us; perhaps more might be done if
it was not a heavy expence. Paring and burning are also used, and are without
doubt an excellent practice on some lands. I have no notion it wastes the soil,
which is the chief objection our young agricul∣turalists have against it. The
expence is from 20 <HI>s.</HI> to 28 <HI>s.</HI> per acre.</P>
<P>The modern farm houses, and offices, are much superior to those
formerly built. I would have every farmer reside in the middle of his farm; and
every house and homestead built in an uniform and convenient manner.</P>
<P>Leases are not universal enough for the encouragement of
experimental agricul∣ture; and the nature of the covenants is according to the
liberal or illiberal disposi∣tion of the landlord. One will smile upon the
arts, and lead rural industry by the hand, whilst another casts a damp upon the
honest heart by oppression, and clips the wings of rising genius.</P>
<P>With regard to improvements, some have the will but not the
power to make them; others the power, but not the will. Nothing but numerous
and repeated ex∣amples can influence the ignorant and stupid. Those who have
the inclination, but not the means, should be assisted by their landlords, and
pay poundage for it. Where land is to be watered, this should particularly be
the case, for it will enable the tenant to pay interest with a smile.</P>
<P>Cabbages might be grown upon many lands improper for turnips;
and if planted with intervals of four feet, as at Dishley, the ground would be
kept clean at little ex∣pence. I have found them exceedingly useful. No land
should lie dormant for a year; and if no man ploughed more than he ought, he
would always be enabled to turn his fallow brick to some useful purpose.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>As many disputes often arise in dividing common fields and
waste lands, about the extent of manorial rights, and also about the extent of
the claims of those who have servitude upon them, we here insert some decisions
of the Scotch Court of Session, given in consequence of the act 1695, for
dividing commons; which we have been favoured with by Mr. JOHN CRAW, Writer in
Haddington.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<P>IN the division of commonties between a proprietor, and others
having servitudes, the proprietor ought to have a fourth part allocated to him,
<HI>tanquam praecipium,</HI> as the value of his property, and the remainder
ought to be divided proportionally, con∣formably to the act 1695, amongst the
neighbouring heritors, who have possessed the same as commonty, allowing the
proprietor likewise a share in that division effeiring to his lands, whereof
the tenants had promiscuous possession with the heritors of the dominant
tenement. Home, 7th Jan. 1724. Hog.—In this case the suit was at the
instance of a fewar. But in a process of division of the commonty of Bigger, at
the Earl of Wigtown's instance against his fewars, some of whom were conjunct
pro∣prietors of the moor, others had only servitude of pasturage upon it; it
was objected against the <HI>praecipium</HI> by those who had servitudes, that
the rights were derived from the pursuer's predecessors, and were a burden upon
his property; that there was no foundation upon the act 1695 for pursuing a
division, unless in the case of common property, that the defenders must be
allowed to enjoy their servitudes as stipulated to them; that the proprietor
was impowered to confine them to ground sufficient for their servitude, but
that further he could not go. The lords found the defenders having rights of
servitude are entitled to have a proportion of the commonty set apart to them,
equivalent to these rights, 23d Jan. 1739. Wigtown.—In a process of
di∣vision upon the act 1695, at the instance of a superior against his vassals,
to whom he had granted servitudes of common pasturage on a moor which was his
property, it was found, that the act gives no title to sue a division in this
case, 1st Feb. 1740. Stewart.—In a process of division upon the act 1695,
of a common property be∣longing to two neighbouring barons, the rule of
division was found to be, not the value of the tenements that lay contiguous to
the commonty, but only of the tene∣ments which had been in use to the pasture
there. Nov. 6th, 1739. Dalrymple.</P>
<P>The owners of dominant tenements are not entitled on the
division of the servient moor, to have any share of the property; but the
surface may be divided. Falc. Vol, I. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>36. Stewart, 3d June, 1748.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="90"/> Lands, of which a moor is pertinent as
common property, are entitled on a division to a share effeiring to their
valued rent, notwithstanding they have also pasturage on another moor. Falc.
Vol. I. p. 352. Sharp, 16th June, 1748.</P>
<P>The proprietor of a barony is only entitled to a share in a
commonty, effeiring to the valued rent of such of his lands as have possessed
the commonty, and not to the valued rent of his whole barony. Fa. Col. Vol. I.
p. 68. Moncrief, 15th Dec. 1752.</P>
<P>In the division of a commonty, the possession of part of a
barony was found to preserve the right of the whole barony, where the whole had
formerly been in use to be possessed. Fac. Col. Vol. II. p. 100. Balfour, 23d

<HEADNOTE>
<P>The following EXTRACTS from two letters, written by a
farmer in the West Riding, contain so much natural good sense, expressed in
forcible language, upon the obstacles to improvement, and the means necessary
for rectifying the practice of husbandry in that district, that we have given
them a place. At same time we beg leave to observe, that this gentleman's
sentiments, so far as they go, are nearly similar to those we have formed in
consequence of our survey.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<P>BEING desirous to encourage an undertaking which has for its
object the improve∣ment of agriculture, and of course the general benefit of
the public, I have ventured to communicate my thoughts to you upon some of the
most important obstacles to that useful science, which I thought might be more
clearly done upon paper than in the short time I had the honour to spend with
you. I will begin my observations upon the third of your queries. The lands in
this part being chiefly occupied by small <PB N="93" REF="91"/> farmers, they
are deprived of making that improvement which a man of property, with two or
three hundred acres of land, can do. A small farmer, not having room to change
his land from tillage to seeds, and pasture with sheep, which is the grand
improvement of the land in this part, he lets a small portion lie in grass, to
keep his milk cows and horses, and the rest perpetually in tillage, excepting
now and then a little broad clover. By this method it gets wore out, requires a
heavier dressing of manures, more working by the plough and harrows, and
becomes so fixed and cemented together (the greater part of our land being of a
clayey glutinous nature), that it is deprived of receiving the benefit of the
sun and air, which is the principal life of vegetation; whereas by laying down
with red clover, and white and yellow clovers alternately, and occasionally a
few grass seeds, the soil is kept in a freer state. The fibrous threads of
those seeds running among the soil, communicate the warmth of the sun and air
in every part, render the soil more malleable, easier to work, and in a better
state for the reception of any kind of grain. These advantages it receives from
the culture of seeds, exclusive of the <HI>rest and manure,</HI> which is
scattered upon it by that most provident of all cattle, sheep, as great a
portion of which I should re∣commend to be kept upon every farm as is
consistent with this mode of management. They enrich the soil more than any
other cattle; and give employment by their fleece, and the most approved food
in their carcass, to our manufactures. Another obstacle to improvement here is,
that a small farm is not worth the attention of a man of inge∣nuity and
property; and this, together with the refusal of leases and arbitrary clauses,
prevents men of property from educating their sons in this line of business.
Every man therefore that experiences these oppressions, and who can give his
son a fortune to stock 150 or 200 acres of ground, if he is a lad of genius,
puts him apprentice either in the mercantile line, or some of the genteel
professions. I know this sort of reasoning will draw upon me many enemies; and
it will be objected, that by laying a number of small farms together you will
depopulate a country. Far be it from me to deprive any man of his property, or
to wish to do any thing that may tend to decrease population: on the contrary,
it is my wish to promote it; convinced that the riches of a country depend upon
it. I would not deprive the old farmers of their land; I would have them
educate their sons in the useful manufactories, and as they die, lay them
together, or convert them into manufactories where <HI>properly situated,</HI>
and lay a sufficient portion of land for their convenience: and the rest lay
together for the purpose of farming. Four farms, of 50 acres each, laid
together under proper ma∣nagement, would be made to produce one-fourth more for
the public market than in separate allotments; and I think it will be generally
confessed, that in a country like this, abounding with men of property,
ingenuity, and enterprize, that there generally will be found employment in our
manufactories for as many inhabitants as there can be found provisions to
support; consequently, more land is made to produce, and more it will tend to
increase population. I shall next beg leave to repeat my method of management;
which, though you have seen, and I verbally communicated to you, I think may
here be more clearly described.</P>
<P>Upon sand land, loamy, sand, or dry hazle soils, I cultivate
turnips dressed with bones, mixed with a portion of fold manure, as
communicated to you; next barley, red clover, and wheat; then turnips, barley,
white and yellow clovers, pasturing with sheep one or two years; then wheat,
and so on. Upon clay and wet soils, after <PB N="94" REF="92"/> fallow, wheat,
red clover, wheat or oats, then fallow, wheat or barley (if the fallow be limed
we always sow wheat; if fold manure, sometimes barley, as I change the tillage
as much as possible), next small seeds as above, mixing a few grass seeds, and
pastur∣ing with sheep, one, two, or three years as convenient, or apparently
most useful. I then plough out for wheat or oats; if laid more than one year,
oats. I have found this, from 20 years experience, to be the most beneficial
method of cultivating land; having brought some poor soils to considerable
greater value within that period. The farm I occupy is but small, 150
<HI>statute acres,</HI> and, though as well managed 20 years hence as any in
the circuit, and as heavily manured, did not then feed more than 20 sheep upon
grass, and 40 upon turnip, upon an average. I can now fatten 60, sometimes 80
upon grass, and 100 or 120 upon turnip; and get one-fourth more corn than was
formerly raised, besides some increase of other cattle. Here, however, ought to
be understood the great expence I am at in artificial manures, these adding to
the natural ones in a very considerable proportion. Last year I spread on
eighty pounds worth of bones, forty pounds worth of lime, and ten or twelve
pounds worth of soot and rape dust upon this small farm, besides the natural
manures it pro∣duced: and upon an average it costs me at least £ 100 per
year in different sorts of tillage. This ought to be considered as a principal
means of improvement, and is more by one half than is bought upon an average by
the general run of farmers.</P>
<P>I come now to speak of the necessity of leases, which, with the
forementioned thoughts on small farms, will give answer to your 35th question.
The greater part of this country is either tenanted at the will of the
proprietor, that is, from year to year, or upon leases clogged with arbitrary
clauses, such as being restrained from ploughing out certain pleces of ground
under heavy penalties, or confined in some measure to one mode of management,
which restrains the genius of the farmer, and ties him from experiments and
every useful improvement. There may indeed be a few men found, who will exert
their abilities and risk their property under a yearly farm, yet the generallty
will not: for out of the whole of my acquaintance (and I know a great number or
clever farmers), whenever I have asked them, why do you not manage such a plece
of land so and so, how much more would it be made to produce? The answer always
is, we are tenants at will, and fear advantage would be taken of our
improvements. This, I presume, will appear to every one a natural conclusion.
There are two clauses which I think necessary in this country where tillage is
so dear, and where they are at an inconvenient distance from great towns that
manure cannot be replaced, and that is, to be restrained from selling of the
hay and straw from the premises; and four or five years previous to the end of
the term, to lay down one-third of the ground in a good husbandry style. These,
in my opinion, are all the restraints necessary for the security of the
proprietor, and, I think, would not militate against the farmer's interest, but
leave him at full liberty to pursue his improvements.</P>
<P>Lime husbandry, which was more practised some time past than at
present; for it is found, that where lands have been long under the plough, and
often dressed over with it (which has been the general practice for a century
past), it has very little ef∣fect. The old
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> used no other tillage, till
very lately, but what was made in the farm-yard, and many of them no other yet,
always liming their clay land fallows, and sowing wheat,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> oats, beans or broad clover,
and again wheat. They have thus fallowed and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, again and again, for 30 or 40
years together, laying on the <PB N="95" REF="93"/> rate of about 120 bushels of
Knottingly stone-lime upon an acre, which will be two 4-horse cart loads. This
stone is brought from near Pontefract, about 15 miles by water. Since we got
the navigation, it is burnt by the river side, about 3 miles dis∣tance from us:
it costs at the kiln about 4½ <HI>d.</HI> per bushel; the expence of
conveyance from the kiln to the land (to average a circuit of six miles) will
be about 1 <HI>d.</HI> per bushel, and the expence of watering and spreading
nearly ½ <HI>d.:</HI> so that the whole ex∣pence will be about 6
<HI>d.</HI> per bushel, or £ 3. for a statute acre. This is collected
during the summer, and spread on at any convenient time, a little before wheat
sowing.</P>
<P>But in my opinion, this time is too late, as I find the sooner
it is spread on in the spring, and the oftener it is ploughed afterwards, the
more intimately it gets mixed with the earth; having perfectly absorbed its own
air and water, the better it fertilizes the soil, and fits it for the produce
of a crop. The season of laying it on is not however regarded by the generality
of farmers, nor scarcely any other property re∣specting it, but convenience for
their other employments. The most improved me∣thod I am acquainted with, and
which I find to answer best, is to lay upon clay soils about 180 or 200 bushels
of Knottingly stone-lime upon an acre. This stone, upon being analyzed, is
found to be mixed with a strong sand, about one-third of its weight (for we
have two sorts of lime of very different properties). The earlier in the
sum∣mer it is laid on, the better, for the fallow to receive a few ploughings
afterwards. It also answers best to be laid on the first fallow after seeds, as
the fresher the land, the greater its effects. I think it not prudent to lime
two fallows together, except there has been an interval of rest, and other
manures spread on in the mean time; nor do I find it answer upon old ploughed
wore out soils. Hence arises the philosophical opi∣nion of some ingenious
farmers, that lime, possessing neither oils nor salts, acts only as a stimulus
or forcer to other manures, bringing such vegetative qualities, as are in the
soil, into more powerful life and activity. Upon dry land that is proper for
tur∣nips, I lay 80 or 100 bushels of Emsall lime per acre. This is mixed with a
strong clay about the same proportion, as the other of sand; there is some
cautilus quality mixed with this lime, that if too great a quantity be laid on,
instead of assisting it, de∣stroys vegetation: but about this quantity is
helpful, it stiffens the straw, makes it stand firmer at the root, and heavier
in the ear. I do not use this as a complete, but only an assistant dressing
betwixt fallows; laying it on in the autumn before the last crop before fallow,
as soon as possible after the preceding crop is reaped. I then plow down and
sow with either wheat or oats, to either of which it is helpful, and the
following year will be more serviceable to the turnip crop, than if spread on
the same summer. This lime costs about the same price as the other. It is to be
observed, that these lands are kept altogether fresh by being sown with seeds,
and pastured with sheep every other fallow; and always dressed with bones or
fold manure, or both, for turnips.</P>
<P>The sheep that are kept in this extensive county are as variable
as the soil and climate, and in some degree suited to each. Most of them have
made, and are yet capable of great improvement. Those bred above Peneston are
well adapted to those unculti∣vated barren mountains, where they have little to
feed upon but ling or heath, and are perhaps the least capable of improvment of
any other: but as you have seen them, I need not be particular in describing
them. I imagine their fleece, taking ewes, wethers, and hogs, together will
average about 2½ or 3 lb. which will be worth <PB N="96" REF="94"/> 2
<HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.;</HI> of late years a little more. Those bred upon York
wolds are very nume∣rous, and far the best in the county. It being a dry,
flinty, lime-stone soil, and capa∣ble of cultivation; by growing turnips for
their winter support, they raise some of them to good weights, 27 or 28 lbs.
per quarter when fatted. Those farmers occu∣pying large districts of land, can
keep great flocks, which makes it worth their atten∣tion to improve them, and
great improvement some of them have made by crossing with Bakewell's rams, and
breeding from the best Northumberland ewes. This has rather decreased the
weight of the fleece, but improved the staple, and given them a property to
feed much quicker and fatter. Those sheep will weigh when fat, from 14 to 28
lb. per quarter, in proportion as they are supported with food; and the fleece
upon the best walks will average 6 lb. or better, which this year is worth
about 4 <HI>s.</HI> those on the poorer walks from 4 to 5 lb. worth from 2
<HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> to 3 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>What are bred in this neighbourhood upon waste grounds are of
small consequence. They are the worst in the county, being bred from all sorts;
and belonging chiefly to poor people, in small lots of 10, 15, or 20 each, will
never be bettered till the lands are inclosed. We have a few gentlemen farmers
begun to breed from Northumber∣land ewes and Bakewell's rams, which I think,
makes far the best and most profitable stock; but for want of room, nothing of
consequence can be done here in the breed∣ing line. The chief practice of our
farmers is to buy ewes at Peneston, or from York wolds, or Northumberland, at
Michaelmas, fatten the lamb in the spring, and the ewe afterwards, changing
every year. Being near a manufacturing country, full of opulent tradesmen and
merchants, lamb always bears a good price, being worth 6 <HI>d.</HI> per lb.
nearly, on an average, all spring and summer. Where there is room to breed a
few of our own best ewe lambs every year of the above sort, to keep up a stock
in pro∣portion to the size of the farm, I believe it most profitable, as stock
bred upon our own soils, if of a proper sort, will fatten their lambs and
themselves too, much sooner than those brought from any other part. The fleece
of these, where gentlemen have brought them to tolerable perfection will be 6
lb. average, and 4 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> or 5 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>In respect to horses, very few are bred in this neighbourhood,
scarcely any for sale. The farmers and manufacturers breed a few for their own
use; as such every man gets of a sort that is most likely to be adapted to his
own business; some galloways, worth at 5 years old, from £ 10. to £
15. some half bred horses, fit for either plough or saddle, about 15 hands,
worth, at 5 years old, from £ 18. to £ 25.; and a few of the heavy
black ones, which will be worth from £ 25. to £ 30. if free from
blemishes: those will get to 16 hands high. But the East Riding is the circuit
for horses: there the best road and coach horses are bred in England, and of
any price almost, from 20 to 60 guineas at 5 years old. This circuit is by no
means adapted to the breed of horses. Sheep is my favourite stock, with a few
good short horned heifers, of the Northallerton or Darlington sort.</P>
<P>In respect to the value of land, it is a very dubious question
to answer. We have much let for the convenience of trade; but I shall only
speak to that let for the pur∣pose of farming. This is rented from 7<HI>s.</HI>
6<HI>d.</HI> to 40<HI>s.</HI> per statute acre, subject to every other
incumbrance, which, in some places from tithes, poors rates, high-ways, and
other taxes, is very considerable. Where they have a manufactory amongst them,
the poors rates only will be 4<HI>s.</HI> in the pound rent. I think more than
two-thirds of my neighbourhood is of a wet clayey nature, unfit for turnips.
The average rent of <PB N="97" REF="95"/> these lands may be about 15<HI>s.</HI>
per acre, and the dry turnip soils about 24<HI>s.</HI> per ditto. As to the
produce, good farmers will average from 27 to 30 bushels of wheat per acre, 40
or 44 bushels barley, 64 or 70 bushels oats, and 30 bushels beans. Small
farmers and indifferent managers, which occupy, I suppose, 3-fourths of our
lands, will not average more than 20 bushels of wheat, 30 bushels barley, 48
bushels oats, and 20 bushels beans. Thus have I communicated to you my opinion
upon your different questions to the best of my knowledge, observation, and
experience; and where I have erred, it is an error in judgment, which I should
be glad to be corrected in. You are at liberty to make use of my name in any
way you think proper: for though I should draw upon me the re∣proach of the
haughty and ignorant farmers, I regard not the censure of such narrow and
contracted minds; conscious that it is a duty which every man owes to himself
and mankind, to exert himself for the public welfare, and being convinced that
nothing is more necessary, nor can tend more to promote the general interest,
than the object you have in view. You have therefore my sincere wishes for its
success. I am, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF THE ROTHERAM PLOUGH, BY JOSHUA WALKER, ESQ. AT
CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<P>THE following is the general outlines of the history of this
useful implement of hus∣bandry.</P>
<P>It was invented by a Mr. Joseph Foljambe of Eastwood, near this
place, about se∣venty years ago, for which he took out a patent; he afterwards
sold the patent right to a Mr. Staniforth, of Firbeck in this neighbourhood,
who at first gave the farmers the privilege of using his ploughs for 2
<HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> each; he afterwards attempted to ad∣vance them to 7
<HI>s.</HI> or 7 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> but this not meeting with the
approbation of the farmers, a combination took place, and the validity of the
patent was contested and set aside, upon the ground of its not being <HI>a new
invented plough,</HI> but <HI>a plough im∣proved.</HI> Since the first
introduction of this plough, the only improvement on it has been the
lengthening the head or sock, which keeps it steadier to its work; a certain
indication that the inventor or improver of ploughs had well digested his plan
before he made it public. The ploughs in use, before the introduction of the
new one, were such as are now used in that part of this district called the
Levels, between Doncas∣ter and Thorne, which require four horses to do the work
done by two.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="96"/> The dimensions and construction of the
plough will appear sufficiently evident from the following drawing and
description.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACTS FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE OF MR. PARKINSON, AT
DONCASTER: ADDRESSED TO MR. BROUN.</HEAD>
<P>IN answer to your request concerning the sheep-farming of this
neighbourhood;—a great part of this country is not proper to breed upon,
yet sheep ought to be kept by every farmer for improving his land; and in my
opinion the most profitable way is to buy draft ewes in September, and to feed
their lambs; after that, keep on the mothers till fat. As our clay soils are
liable to rot sheep, by floods, &amp;c. the farmer, by this method, will not
run any risk; for if his sheep take the rot, they will, if managed properly, be
ready for the butcher at all times. The turnips upon the clay should be eaten
early in the season, to make the most of them, and those upon the lime-stone
and sandy soils afterwards.</P>
<P>I will now describe the kind of sheep proper to be bred on the
sand and lime-stone farms; and these, I think, are the Dishley, or as they are
commonly called, the Bake∣well breed; the properties of which are well known.
Their wool may be consider∣ably improved; it being in general of too short a
kind, and producing various sorts in one fleece: viz. mossy on the back, hairy
on the thighs, or breech, and fine and soft on the shoulders and necks, which
causes one part to be sold at Bury St. Edmonds, and the other at Halifax, to
make the most of it.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of some, that long wool injures the carcass: I
do not believe it, or at least it is scarcely perceptible; therefore I would
have the wool on these sheep to be of a fine combing quality, nine or ten
inches long, bearing a very even top, as that prevents both loss of wool and
labour, by not having the tag end to cut off. The weight of the fleece to be
from eight to twelve pound, if properly fed, if not, it will perhaps be only
from five to seven pound. The carcass to weigh from 20 to 25 pound per quarter
with common food; extraordinary feed, from 25 to 40 pound.</P>
<P>We have a sort of sheep from Northumberland that feeds well, and
pays a great deal of money. I had last year 20 ewes from that country: bought
them October, 1791, put them to a Dishley tup, and kept them on till December,
1792.—Profit as follows: <PB N="100" REF="98"/>

<P>This year I have 30 ewes which are not yet sold. One of their
lambs, aged four months, weighed 16 pound per quarter; which sold in Sheffield
market at 5½ per pound, or £. 1 13 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI>
besides skin, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The sheep at present bred in this country, I mean those bred
upon the commons, are not worth describing. Their fleeces weigh from one to
five pound, but very few so much. The carcass will feed from nine to fifteen
pound per quarter—general run about twelve pound. It is my opinion,
several thousand pounds are annually lost in the neighbourhood of Doncaster,
for want of a more improved breed of sheep.</P>
<P>I think the Dishley sheep are generally too small: their bone
and shape are beau∣tiful, but their skin, or pelt, is too thin for bearing the
cold. They can neither stand the extremities of heat nor cold; and it is
sometimes found necessary to clothe them, where this breed is newly introduced.
The wool of the Northumberland sheep stands in need of great improvement: upon
many of them the staple is much too short, and some carry a hairy sort of wool,
not profitable. The carcass, though not so inclined to feed as the Dishley
sheep, yet being far larger, pays very well.</P>
<P>The Durham, or Tees sheep, if improved, might pay very well; but
from what I have seen, I think little attention has been paid to them, every
flock being of various sorts, both in respect of wool and carcase. There is a
number of them pretty good, but a greater number not so. I am of opinion, a
careful and knowing observer of sheep, would raise a fine breed from the
Dishley ram and Tees ewes. Sheep are an animal difficult to bring to
perfection, as both wool and carcass are to be attended to; but one thing I am
clear in, that the best carcasses will produce the best wools; like as good
land affords good grain.</P>
<P>It is too often little considered how much may be raised from
land under good ma∣nagement. It appears to me, that it would be a good scheme
for the Board of Agri∣culture to take a farm into their own hands, and shew by
improved practice what might be done: this would be of great utility. As to
driving any thing into old farmers, it is easier to make new ones. There is
land near Doncaster now let at 7 <HI>s.</HI> per acre, which, if managed in a
proper manner, and fed by sheep, would pay 20 <HI>s.</HI> and where the sheep
that are bred never sell higher than 12 <HI>s.</HI> or 16 <HI>s.</HI> might be
fed to 30 <HI>s.</HI> and 40 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>The usual produce per acre, where a rotation of turnips, barley,
clover, and wheat, is adopted, is as follows:</P>
<P>Upon poor sands, 3½ quarters of barley, 2 of
wheat:—turnip and clover precarious. Upon clay soils, 4 quarters barley,
3 quarters wheat, 3 quarters beans,—clover and turnips both good. Upon
lime-stone, 4 quarters barley, 3 quarters wheat, 2½ quar∣ters 
<PB N="101" REF="99"/> beans,—clover and turnips good. Loamy land, 5
quarters barley, 3½ quarters wheat, pease 3 quarters,—clover and
turnips good.</P>
<P>The mode of cultivation, however, is very irregular: as the
farmers have no leases, they make hay when the sun shines, and often crop the
ground as long as it will carry. I know a great many farmers who keep their
land in a poor state, to prevent the own∣ers from advancing it.</P>
<P>Draining very little known in this part of the country. The wet
lands improveable; but the dry lands much more so.</P>
<P>With regard to the poor sands betwixt this place and Bautry,
which are at present in a very shabby state, my opinion is, that the best way
of going to work with them would be, first to begin with a good turnip fallow,
and 10 loads of manure, of two tons each to the acre, which may be had at
Doncaster at 5 <HI>s.</HI> per ton, as they have scarce any themselves. This
will produce a good crop of turnips, which ought to be eat off with sheep, and
the land sown with barley and seeds—quantity of seeds, 1 peck of rye
grass, 14 pound white clover, and 14 pound trefoil. I would pasture it with
sheep for two years, break it for wheat or rye, and return to turnips. My
reasons for this are; rye grass is a very good winter plant, and scarce can be
eaten too near in the spring, when grass is of most value. If it run to a bent,
it exhausts itself for that season, and is worth nothing till autumn. Trefoil
is more early than white clover; therefore, with these mixtures, three
different springs are got. Many farmers like red clover; I do not, except for
cutting, and I think it much the better of a little rye grass. Red clover, on
many soils, stands but for one year, therefore is very improper seed for
pasture, which those sands should be applied to as much as possible, to fasten
them. All artificial grasses should bear two years eating at least, the expence
of seeds being great; but none will scarcely bear more than three years. No
poor sand or lime-stone ought to be pastured longer than it will keep a
sufficient number of sheep to leave a good top dressing when ploughed up; by
reason the land is then losing what was put into it before, and returning to
its natural state. In time, a hot-bed will come to earth. Manure, mixed with
soil, causes fermentation in some measure, like yest put amongst wort, and will
soon go off, and cease to operate.</P>
<P>The land in its present state of cultivation lets high; though
worth double the sum if properly managed. Sheep are much wanted, as there is no
improvement equal to the sheep-farming: it is both the cheapest and best upon
all dry soils. If the farmer could only be made to understand he had a sort of
inheritance in his farm, which can no way be done but by giving leases, it
would be of general utility to the kingdom at large. The farmers are the first
and the grand machine of all improve∣ments, and therefore ought to have every
possible encouragement given them. I never was in any part of the country where
the people were more flat to improvement than in this neighbourhood. I
apprehend the cause is this, a great many gentlemen live in it, consequently
near their tenants, and are curbs upon their ingenuity. Most experiments are
costly, and the farmer is afraid his landlord will look upon his at∣tempts to
improve as acts of extravagance,—such as hiring a Dishley ram for 100
guineas the season, and other things of the same kind.</P>
<P>There is an absurd idea some men have, that the scheme I have
adapted for the sands will diminish the quantity of grain: I say no,—it
will only add to it; for an acre managed in the way I have described, will
produce as much as two do now. As <PB N="102" REF="100"/> for the small mutton
and fine wool that would be lost by my scheme, there will al∣ways be plenty of
the former on the mountains, for the tables of the great; and if lambs are
clipped, they will produce fine carding wool, which does away these
objections.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>During our Survey a Journal was regularly kept, wherein was
inserted the whole in∣formation received at the different places we visited,
which was always taken down, as nearly as possible, in the words of the persons
who gave us the intelli∣gence. Considering the great extent of the West Riding,
the different qualities of soil, and the various modes of cultivation adopted,
the following abridge∣ment of its contents, in which a number of observations
daily made by ourselves are included, will, we hope, present to the public as
just a picture of the present state of Husbandry in that district, as could
well have been accomplished, had any other method been adopted.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<P>OCTOBER 18th, 1793, received our commission from Sir John
Sinclair, President of the Board of Agriculture, to draw up an account of the
stock and husbandry of the West Riding of Yorkshire, and to inquire into the
state of manufactures, so far as they were connected with the agriculture of
that district.</P>
<P>October 22d, set off from East Lothian, and arrived at
Boroughbridge on the 24th.</P>
<P>Borough bridge is a market-town, situated upon the great north
road, and about half way betwixt London and Edinburgh. It elects two members to
Parliament, in consequence of a peculiarly qualified burgage tenure, and was
first summoned to send members by Queen Mary in 1553. It is a town of small
extent, enjoys the benefit of inland navigation from the river Eure, which
passes this place, and is navigable to Rippon. Here we received the following
information relative to the husbandry of the neigh∣bourhood.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="101"/> The land generally belongs to small
proprietors, and farms are of various sizes. Soil good; mostly deep loam; and
the rent about 20 <HI>s.</HI> per statute acre, besides public burthens, which
may be about 12 <HI>s.</HI> more. Rate of wages 14 <HI>d.</HI> per day for
winter half year, and 16 <HI>d.</HI> for summer, with extra allowance in hay
time and harvest. Wheat cut with the sickle at 5<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> and 6
s. per acre. Harvest early; generally over by the end of September. A great
part of the land kept in grass. Rotation upon the clay land, two crops and a
fallow, and these crops are wheat and beans; the fallow limed with 32 bushels
Winchester measure, per acre, and the dung chiefly applied to the grass: upon
light land the rotation is, turnips, barley, clover, and wheat, sometimes oats
in place of wheat. Mr. Fretwell drills turnips, but the general practice of the
neighbourhood, is to sow broadcast: where the soil is proper for it, the
turnips are eat upon the ground with sheep, which is considered as most
advantageous. Some cattle bred, but not a fourth part of the necessary
quantity: those that are bred, are chiefly for cows, the males being killed
when calves. Few or no sheep bred. Mr. Fretwell, and Mr. Flet∣cher buy their
ewes from Northumberland: bought them this year at 22 <HI>s.</HI> per head;
sold the lambs at 15 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.;</HI> and the ewes in autumn, after
being fatted, at 29 <HI>s.;</HI> value of the fleece 3 <HI>s.</HI>—about
3½ fleeces to the stone. An acre of good pasture will carry four ewes,
and their lambs. Land almost totally inclosed, and the inclosures small.
Difference of rent betwixt open and inclosed land, ten shillings per acre. Some
waste unimproved common in the neighbourhood, which ought to be divided and
inclosed. No land is watered here.</P>
<P>Prices of corn this year higher than usual, but markets in
general steady. What corn is more than necessary for home consumption, is
disposed of at Knaresborough mar∣ket, and from thence carried to the western
parts of the county. Corns mostly stacked in the fields, as there is found less
loss by vermin than in the stack-yard. Some threshing machines in the
neighbourhood. Roads in good order. The bye∣roads supported by the statute
work, which consists of 2 <HI>s.</HI> from each householder, and six days
labour of a team of three horses, and two labourers from the farmer for each 50
<HI>l.</HI> of rent, with an assessment of 6 <HI>d.</HI> in the pound upon his
rent. Paring and burn∣ing is only practised upon the waste lands; expence about
18 <HI>s.</HI> per acre. The first year it is sown with rape seed; produce from
two to five quarters per acre, generally about four quarters; price at present
thirty guineas per last, but very fluctuating; ex∣pence of reaping and
threshing about 20<HI>s.</HI> per acre, if stacked and threshed in winter; but
according to the general practice it is impossible to calculate the expence,
the whole neighbourhood being gathered to the threshing, when it is done in the
field. In this mode it is a perfect feast, where all comers are welcome: but
this <HI>good old cus∣tom</HI> is fast going out, and the thriftier practice of
stacking it in the yard, and thresh∣ing it in the winter, introduced in its
place.—The straw of the rape is sold to the soap boilers at about 5
<HI>s.</HI> per acre. The plough used here is of the Rotheram kind, drawn with
two horses upon light land, and three upon clay. A ploughman works his horses
only; labours generally 10 hours per day, when the season allows. The want of
leases one great obstacle to improvement. Most part of the farmers are upon
yearly leases, filled with innumerable restrictions; and leases of this kind
are as good as none.</P>
<P>From Boroughbridge we proceeded to Copgrove, the seat of Henry
Duncombe, Esq. M. P. for the county. Upon the road to Copgrove we passed
several common fields, which appeared to be of good quality, but under
execrable management. The <PB N="104" REF="102"/> far greatest part of the land
was inclosed, and the grass very rich; those inclosures adjoining to Mr.
Duncombe's house particularly so.</P>
<P>The information received at Copgrove was to the following
purport.</P>
<P>SOIL in general light, well adapted to turnips, carrots, and
other drilled crops. The whole parish of Copgrove possessed by Mr. Duncombe;
but there is a consi∣derable number of small proprietors in the neighbourhood.
The majority of the farms are small, not exceeding 150 acres. The land is
employed both in pasture and tillage; about two-thirds in pasture. Of the
tillage part, one-third annually under fallow, and turnips taken upon it. Mr.
Duncombe drills a few, but they are other∣wise universally broadcast. Two crops
of corn allowed to a fallow, and these crops are either wheat and oats, or oats
and wheat. Mr. Duncombe's steward thinks it best to take outs first. Mr.
Duncombe sometimes sows rape upon the fallow, eats it off in autumn with sheep,
and sows it with wheat: at other times, after eating it in autumn, lets it
stand till spring, when it is eat again with sheep, and sown with barley or
oats. When land is sown down for grass, if intended only to stand one year, red
clover is sown by itself; if for sheep pasture, white clover, yellow clover,
and rib grass; and if for meadow, white clover and hay seeds. The stock kept
upon the pastures are a mixture both of sheep and cattle. A considerable part
of the fallow is limed; the turnips all dunged, and the remainder of the dung
laid upon grass. Horses chiefly employed in the plough, being found most
expeditious, though a few oxen are also kept. Harvest generally commences about
the middle of August, and is finished be∣fore Michaelmas. The land is mostly
inclosed, there being but few open fields. The value of the land is increased
one-half by inclosing; inclosures in general small; average not above 10 acres:
inclosing not injurious to population. Some common fields, which are very
detrimental both to the proprietors and the tenants. Some waste lands, but not
extensive, which might be improved if they were divided. Prices of labour
greatly advanced; farmer's servants, by the year, £ 12 of wages, and
vic∣tuals; labeurers, 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> per day, with their victuals
in hay time and harvest; hay cut at 2 <HI>s.</HI> per acre; oats and wheat, 6
<HI>s.;</HI> threshing wheat 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> per quarter; oats, 10
<HI>d.;</HI> barley, 6 <HI>d.</HI> Some part of the land in the neighbourhood
is meadow, but being common, has not been drained, which would prove highly
advantageous. Par∣ing and burning greatly practised; of use to break up grass
lands in this manner; expence 20 <HI>s.</HI> per acre. Not much wood in the
neighbourhood; but the quantity is sufficient to answer the demands of the
inhabitants. Provisions high; beef and mut∣ton 4 <HI>d.</HI> and 4½
<HI>d.</HI> per lb. and keep pretty equal for the season. Roads in good order;
the bye-roads supported by the statute work. Farm-houses and offices, in
general, not well constructed, nor properly situated, and might be greatly
improved. No leases are granted. The tenants are mostly under covenants and
restrictions; some of which are <HI>detrimental</HI> both to the interest of
landlord and tenant. No ma∣nufactures here, but a number of cotton mills in the
neighbourhood; as they are lately established, their effects are not yet known.
No agricultural societies. The Dutch or Rotheram plough is used by Mr.
Duncombe.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="103"/> Arrived at Knaresborough.—Waited
upon Robert Stockdale, Esq. from whom we received a great deal of valuable
information. The forest of Knaresborough, consist∣ing of 33,000 acres, was
divided in consequence of an act of parliament passed in 1770; and his account
of this transaction, as published in the Appendix to this survey, will throw
great light upon the system by which common lands are at present divided and
inclosed.</P>
<P>Knaresborough is a market-town of great antiquity, and formerly
a place of consi∣derable strength. It is almost encompassed with the deep river
Nid, and strengthened by a castle situated upon a craggy rock, whence the name
of the place is supposed to be derived. It has a weekly market on Wednesday, at
which great quantities of corn and provisions of all kinds are sold. A good
deal of linen is manufactured in this place and neighbourhood; but little or
nothing done in the woollen way.</P>
<P>Information received here from Mr. William Bramley, steward to
Sir Jo. Coghill, Bart.</P>
<P>Soil about Knaresborough part light, upon a clay bottom, and a
considerable part a deep rich loam. The majority of proprietors small, and
generally occupy their own land. The fields about the town mostly in grass, and
employed in feeding milk cows. The cows are chiefly of the Holderness breed:
farther west, they are of the long horned or Craven kind, which are hardier,
and answer better for the soil and climate. When land is broke up from grass,
two crops of oats are taken, then fallow, which is sown with wheat or barley
and grass seeds. Sheep, both bred in the neigh∣bourhood, and bought at the
adjoining fairs. Wool sells at about 10 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> per stone of
15 lb. avoirdupois, three fleeces to the stone. General rotation of
crops;—fallow, wheat, beans, and oats; but some take only two crops after
fallow. The fallows are limed, 2 chalders, or 64 bushels to the acre. Turnips
often taken for a fallow which are worth £ 5. per acre, when eaten upon
the ground; after them, barley. Plough of the Dutch or Rotheram kind, wrought
with 3 horses in a line. No oxen used. Wheat sown about Michaelmas, if the
season answers, beans in March, or as early as possible, oats in April, and
barley immediately afterwards. Land almost wholly in∣closed, and supposed to be
worth 5 <HI>s.</HI> more rent per acre than the same soil in open field.
Inclosures from 3 to 10 acres. Thinks it would be of great utility to inclose
all the common fields; and that inclosing can never have a bad effect upon
popula∣tion. A waste common in the neighbourhood, which might be greatly
improved. Planting the waste lands not supposed advantageous; as there were
some of the higher parts of the forest planted, which have done no good. Wages
high; in har∣vest 2 <HI>s.</HI> per day for men, and 15 <HI>d.</HI> for women.
Hours of labour, in summer, from six to six; but in harvest, do not enter till
eight o'clock. Paring and burning greatly practised; expence 14 <HI>s.</HI> per
acre. A good deal of wood in the neighbourhood. Provisions plenty; beef and
mutton at 3½ <HI>d.</HI> and 4 <HI>d.</HI> per lb. avoirdupois.
Farm∣houses not very good, and stand in need of improvement. A number of leases
granted; some for 7, others for 14, and a few for 21 years. Thinks it would
greatly promote the interest of both landlord and tenant, if the whole of the
lands were under lease; thinks also that covenants, or restrictions upon the
tenant, during any part of the lease, except the three last years, are a great
hardship, and very detrimental to <PB N="106" REF="104"/> good farming. No
agricultural societies in this neighbourhood, but the farmers in general seem
fond of improvements.</P>
<P>We also received answers to the queries from Mr. Stockdale,
where his information agrees with Mr. Bramley; it is unnecessary to repeat it.
The substance of his answers is therefore only given.</P>
<P>The soil and climate vary according to situation, exposure,
vicinity to rivers and towns; as also to the quantity of lime, composts, and
other manures that are used. Farms are in general small, and divided nearly
into equal portions of arable and grass; all kinds of clover and grass-seeds
are cultivated. A mixed stock of horses, cattle, and sheep are kept upon the
pastures, the breeds by no means properly attended to, except by some
particular persons. Very little land is watered, but many situations would
admit of it. Fallowing practised invariably upon strong soils, and even upon
all such as are not friendly to the turnip husbandry. Turnips, when eat by
sheep, seldom fail to improve the ground, and secure a succession of good
crops; but red∣clover, when too often sown, is found not so good a succession
as trefoil and white clover, or even beans, occasionally introduced in its
stead. Lime is principally used as a manure, when stable-dung cannot be
obtained. Compost dunghills are now more attended to than formerly, but not so
much as they ought to be. Many of the common fields are inclosed annually,
under particular acts of parliament, and by them population has been greatly
increased. The extent of waste land is very great in this wapentake, and
principally depastured by half starved sheep, horses, and young cattle; it may
be improved in various ways, as the commons in this district differ much in
soil, exposure, and other circumstances. The land is not so much drained as it
ought to be, the drains are mostly filled with stones, and covered, very few
filled with wood or <HI>straw.</HI> If the soil be sound and strong, it is
common to turn the first sod, with the grass side downwards, letting it rest
for support on a piece of the bottom of the drain on each side not thrown out;
this is called a shoulder drain, and in strong land answers well, and is done
cheap. Paring and burning is practised, and found to answer well in all sour
rushy land, and is done by men, with a push or breast spade. In some parts of
the country wood abounds, and where it is attended to, thrives well. The roads
are in general good; those are best which are made wide, not too much raised in
the middle, and the stones broke small, by which means they unite and bed
firmer. The farm-houses and offices, when made in consequence of new
inclosures, are usually placed near the centre of the farm, and are well
constructed. Few leases are granted, which is to be lamented, as it can never
be expected that improvements will be made, where the tenant has no certainty
of reaping the benefit of them. The people certainly have a great turn to
improvements, and were reasonable leases given, would make a rapid progress
therein. The intermixture of property, a great obsta∣cle to improvement. If a
general inclosure bill could be obtained, and tithes com∣muted, it would
obviate a great many of the present impediments, and contribute more to
extensive and general improvement than any other measure.</P>
<P>We had the pleasure to fall in at Knaresborough with Mr.
Bainbridge, steward to Lord Loughborough, from whom we received a variety of
important information, made use of in its proper place. The poors rate is
generally 4 <HI>s.</HI> in the pound in this neighbourhood, which raises a
suspicion that the funds are either badly administered, or that the laws
themselves are founded upon wrong principles. By in∣formation 
<PB N="107" REF="105"/> received from other sources, it appeared that a person
in the workhouse fares full as well as if he derived his subsistence from his
own labour; a method of ma∣nagement inconsistent with sound policy, and highly
inimical to virtue and industry, amongst the lower ranks.</P>
<P>Visited Harrowgate; country about that place wild and
uncultivated; in the division of Knaresborough forest, a tract of land about
200 acres, was set apart for the use of the company who resort there.</P>
<P>Arrived at Ripley. Sir John Ingilby, a great friend to
improvement in this neigh∣bourhood, unfortunately from home. The land here
mostly belongs to small free∣holders;—farms about 120 acres in extent,
but a great deal larger upon the poor lands. Rents, in the vicinity of Ripley
30 <HI>s.</HI> per acre, besides public burthens; about a third of the land
kept in tillage, no clover sown, no land watered, wheat and oats the gene∣ral
crops, and two crops to a fallow. One-third of the tillage land annually limed,
and 3 chalders, or 96 bushels applied to the acre. Harvest later than in the
lower parts of the country; nine quarters of Friesland oats per acre, sometimes
got upon fresh land. Land all inclosed. Rents increased by inclosing;
inclosures from 5 to 25 acres. No common fields; little waste land. Labourers 9
<HI>s.</HI> per week, ploughmen 20 <HI>l.</HI> per annum, with a free house,
and fuel. Very little land pared and burned, roads good; farm houses might be
improved; seldom any leases granted, but the want of them thought a great loss,
as the farmers have thereby no encouragement to improve their lands; strict
covenants betwixt landlord and tenant, which are thought detri∣mental to both.
One of the greatest obstacles to improvements here, is confining the tenants to
keep their lands in old pasture grass.</P>
<P>From Ripley to Paitley-bridge, the face of the country alters
exceedingly. A great deal of woodland; road very unequal, and great part of it
shaded with trees on each side. There is a fine valley or strath of land,
called Nidderdale, or Netherdale, as we approached Paitly; in the midst of
which runs the river Nid, and the whole dale appeared exceeding populous. Land
in the dale all inclosed, mostly with stone dykes. Observed a number of fine
cows pasturing in the fields, something of a cross betwixt the Holderness and
Craven breeds: indeed we saw scarce any other stock but milk cows, great
quantities of butter being made in the dale. Farms very small, and al∣most
wholly in grass. Some turnips, and those taken great care of, for we noticed in
several fields the tops cut off, and the turnip carrying home to be built in
the barn. Little hay; and as for corn, we have not seen one stalk since our
departure from Ripley.</P>
<P>Paitley is a fine thriving place: It being market day when we
were there, the town was much crowded, and the shambles presented a sight which
declared that the in∣habitants were in no danger of starving for want of
butcher meat. A great deal of linen is manufactured in this place and
neighbourhood. The yarn is generally bleached before it is woven, which, we
were told, makes the cloth much stronger than when it is wove before bleaching.
Much butter is also salted here, and sent to York for the London market. One
person alone exports from 700 to 800 firkins annually of 561b. per
firkin—the price for which it is contracted at, is 38 <HI>s.</HI> per
firkin. A cow in the dale, produces about 3 firkins during the season; but upon
the higher grounds only 2 firkins. We learned that wool is greatly reduced in
price this season, fine wool 15 <HI>l.</HI> per cent. below last year, and
inferior qualities, at least 25 <HI>l.</HI> per cent. <PB N="108" REF="106"/> A
number of hogs are fed upon oatmeal, and sold to the Lancashire manufacturers
at 7 <HI>s.</HI> per stone of 14 pound. The hams are generally sent to the
London market, as nothing will do with the Lancashire people but the fattest
part of the beast.</P>
<P>At this place we spent the evening with—Moss, Esq. and
received from him the following important accounts of the husbandry of
Nidderdale.</P>
<P>The climate bad; very wet, and the harvest late. Some large
estates, but the great∣est part in the possession of small freeholders. Land
occupied by small farmers, who are also manufacturers, miners, or people
engaged in trade—generally kept in grass, and pastured with milk cows. No
land watered; but thinks it may be useful in many cases. Oats the principal
crop; best management, a fallow and three crops, and tur∣nips taken to the
fallow. Plough of the Rotheram kind. Land all inclosed, except the moors.
Inclosing a great advantage. Approves of small inclosures on that wet, cold
climate; and thinks inclosing has greatly increased population. Planting, in
certain places, would be a great improvement—the moors incapable of
improvement other∣wise. Wages very high, owing to the mines and
manufactories—average 2 <HI>s.</HI> per day. Thinks paring and burning
advantageous, but it is not much practised. A great de∣mand for wood to the
mines, and the quantity not adequate. Beef and mutton 3½ <HI>d.</HI> per
pound, wheat 6 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> per bushel, barley 4 <HI>s.</HI> 10
<HI>d.</HI> oats 3 <HI>s.</HI> beans 6 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> Corn generally
brought from Knaresborough and Rippon, as little is raised here in propor∣tion
to the demand. Land let both upon lease and at will. Length of leases, when
granted, 21 years. The linen manufacture doubled within these 25 years. Lead
mines carried on to a great extent. Thinks manufactures have served agriculture
very much. Sheep fed in the dale, are of the Mug breed; those in the moors, of
the Scotch kind. Is of opinion it would be of advantage if all the lands were
under lease.</P>
<P>From Paitley-bridge to Grassington, we went through a large
common, which ap∣peared very improveable. Observed large flocks of sheep,
mostly of the Scotch breed, of bad quality and condition. Examined the lead
mines in the neighbourhood, which are numerous and valuable. Before we arrived
at Grassington, the land improves in quality, and is all inclosed. A large
woollen mill here, which formerly did much bu∣siness; but since the stagnation
of trade, occasioned by the war, has done little. Few or no turnips are
cultivated about this place, and the most part of the people em∣ployed in the
mines.</P>
<P>Substance of information received at Grassington.</P>
<P>Land chiefly possessed by small proprietors, and mostly occupied
by them. Some extensive commons, consisting of many thousand acres—one of
them lately divided, and the consequences beneficial. Oats the principal grain
that is sown, but almost the whole of the neighbourhood is in grass; and
employed in feeding cattle and sheep for the Skipton market. Lime produces
great advantages upon the moors. Small tithes only drawn, and a modus taken for
the great ones. Very few leases granted; but the gentleman from whom we had
this information, was of opinion that the want of them was a great bar to
improvements.</P>
<P>Leaving Grassington, we crossed the hills, and arrived at
Settle. The far greater part of the way, for we cannot call it a road, lay
through uncultivated moors. Consi∣derable <PB N="109" REF="107"/> parts of these
moors appeared very improveable. We went through a large extent of stone
inclosures, which we understood to have been common, and lately di∣vided; but
did not see the vestige of a house for more than 10 miles; so could make no
inquiry whether the inclosing had produced beneficial consequences or not.</P>
<P>At Settle the low grounds are all inclosed, and the fences in
the most complete state. The greatest part of the land is in grass, which for
quality and verdure, can hardly be exceeded. Land in the neighbourhood of
Settle, sets at 50<HI>s.</HI> and £3 per acre. It appears well worthy of
it, for we received a well attested account of a 10 acre close, that fed in
1792, 20 head of cattle, and 40 sheep. Indeed the richness of the soil is
hardly credible to those who have not seen it; and the possessors seem
unanimously to think that it is of greater value when kept in grass, than to
break it up and culti∣vate with the plough.</P>
<P>Settle fair being upon the day we were there, had an opportunity
to see a great show of cattle of the county breed. They are universally long
horned, and seem in shape, skin, and other circumstances, to be nearly the same
as the Irish breed. We learned that there has not been the same attention shown
of late, to keep the breed pure, by selecting proper bulls, as formerly. We
are, however, of opinion, that the breed of long horned cattle, which prevails
over the western part of the island, is ad∣mirably adapted, from the thickness
of their skin, and hardiness of constitution, to undergo the vicissitudes of
this climate: and that the short horned breed, upon the eastern coasts, would
never answer in this part of the country.</P>
<P>We received the following answers to the queries here, from
David Swale, Esq.</P>
<P>The cultivated lands in the lower part of this district, consist
of excellent feeding pastures; the higher grounds are rushy and spouty,
occasioned by neglect of drain∣ing; a mode of improvement which has answered in
a surprising degree, when applied judiciously. The soil of the low grounds
generally rich mould, of the loamy and hazle kinds; the higher lands mostly
turbary or clay. In this district there is a number of freeholders, from and
under £ 10 a year, to £ 4 or 500. The greatest proprietors are, the
Duke of Devonshire, Lord Thanet, Lord Grantham, Thomas Lester, Esq. Edward
Parker, Esq. and several others. The lands of good quality, are generally
employed in feeding. The tillage land is of an inferior sort, and lies in
higher situations. Black oats are principally sown. Turnips are but little
culti∣vated. The cattle that are bred, are of the long horned kind; the grazing
stocks principally consist of Scotch cattle and sheep. Most of the high land is
injured by water, and the want of fencing. There are considerable commons,
consisting of many thousand acres, capable of great improvement, by inclosing
and draining. This mode of improvement is checked by the necessity (as the law
now stands) of having them divided by act of Parliament, as such commons have
many proprietors. The rotation of management, upon the higher grounds, is
mostly laying them down, after three years ploughing, for three years more,
without any other cultivation than pasturing it with a breeding stock. In low
situations, turnips are cultivated, and clover would answer, but is not adopted
here; which is probably owing to the high price the land bears. In higher
situations, these crops are very uncertain, and depend upon the weather.
Fallowing is very little practised. Oxen were formerly used, but horses are now
generally employed. The ploughs, carts, &amp;c., are of the kind com∣monly used
in the country. The land is generally inclosed, except the out-moors or 
<PB N="110" REF="108"/> commons. Considerable advantage has arisen from
inclosing, and the value has in∣creased. Where cattle or sheep are pastured,
the stock grows better, and although the quantity of wool is not so great, yet
its quality is finer. The extent of waste lands is great, and the improvement
by fencing and draining might be considerable. Some might, in that case, be
converted into pasture land, others into arable, and others into planting, with
a promising prospect of success. Paring and burning upon the high lands is much
exploded, as wasting the soil where it can be ill spared. This district, in
most parts, wants wood. Of late there has been a good deal planted, which
promises well; but this article is not so much attended to, as might be wished.
It would be of great utility to have the tithes properly regulated. Obstacles
to im∣provement, are short leases, and the great scarcity of coal, which might
be remedied by lords of the manors making trials to discover them, and by
holding out rewards, and granting favourable leases to such persons as are
willing to adventure in those un∣dertakings. Poors rates very high here, not
less than 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> per pound rent.</P>
<P>At Settle we had also the good fortune to fall in with Mr.
Barbeck, banker there, who took the trouble to introduce us to several
intelligent farmers; the substance of whose information we now proceed to
give.</P>
<P>Soil in the neighbourhood of Settle, of a hazle mould, upon a
dry bottom: climate wet; land chiefly in the natural possession of small
proprietors. Farms small, from £ 50 to £ 200 a year. Several
commons, but the stock upon them stinted. All the low lands are in grass, and
pastured with large cattle of their own breed, and the higher grounds by Scotch
cattle and sheep: the sheep that are bred here, are called the <HI>Mallam
breed.</HI> Wool disposed of at Huddersfield and Wakefield, and sold this
season at 10<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> per stone, of 16lb. 3½ fleeces to
the stone. The wool of the Scotch sheep from Teviotdale, sold at 8<HI>s.</HI>
per stone, and 3 fleeces made a stone. The salve used for smearing them, is one
gallon of tar, and 17lb. of butter, which serves from 25 to 30 sheep. A great
quantity of the high grounds capable of improvement; oats almost the only grain
cultivated; no summer fallow, no turnips, no red clover, and but very little
barley; lime very sparingly applied; plough of the Dutch kind, and drawn by
four horses in a line. Think planting would thrive well upon the moors, and is
much wanted. Labourers high, 2<HI>s.</HI> per day all the summer months, with
vic∣tuals, in hay-time and harvest; draining advantageous and much practised,
done with walls and covered; paring and burning not thought good farming. Farms
both set upon leases and at will. Leases from 7 to 11 years; no manufactures
but spinning cotton, which has not as yet proved detrimental to agriculture. No
agricultural societies; but think the people have a turn for improvements.</P>
<P>Left Settle, and proceeded to Ingleton. The land all inclosed,
and near wholly in grass, which was of the richest quality. No turnips to be
seen since we left Pately∣bridge, and hardly a blade of corn. In short, for
these some days, from the plenty of grass, and scarcity of corn fields, we were
ready to conjecture that the inhabitants of this part of Yorkshire lived upon
butcher meat altogether.</P>
<P>Information received at Ingleton.</P>
<P>A large common in the neighbourhood, which is stocked with sheep
by the farm∣ers around, and which would be of great advantage to have divided.
Land mostly <PB N="111" REF="109"/> possessed by small proprietors, and almost
totally kept in grass. A good deal of wool spun here for the Bradford
market.</P>
<P>Leaving Ingleton, we proceeded for Dent-dale, the most western
extremity of the county. Upon the road we called upon Bryan Waller, Esq. at
Maisongill; from whom we had the following accounts of the husbandry in his
neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Soil a strong loam, and, from the wetness of the climate, unfit
for ploughing—gene∣rally possessed by small proprietors, and partly set
upon leases of 3, 7, and 9 years. Land set here by the customary acre, 3 acres
of this measure being equal to 5. statute acres. Small tithes paid in kind, and
a modus taken in lieu of hay. The farmer allowed but to plough a small part of
the land, often but eight acres, where he possesses a hundred. Ploughing more
practised formerly, but breeding and feeding cattle is now thought more
profitable. No turnips. Cattle fed in the house during the winter months, upon
hay, which renders beef very high in the spring. A number of Scotch cattle
wintered upon the pastures, which are disposed of by Midsummer—the
commons are stocked with Scotch sheep, the large breed being thought above the
pasture. Cattle that are bred here are all of the long horned kind. No land
watered here—thinks it would be hurtful in this cold country. Very little
fallow, and no attention paid to the plough. Lime applied to the pasture grass:
and mixed with earth and cow-dung—the remain∣der of the dung laid upon
the field that hath been cut for hay. Plough wrought with three horses, often
sour, and all yoked in a line. Land all inclosed, except the com∣mons, partly
with hedges, and partly with stone dykes.—Inclosing has increased rents
greatly. A great deal of waste land in the moors, which he cannot say is
improvable, as planting is not found to answer. Wages high—labourers 1
<HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> per day and victuals, during hay-time and harvest.
Some of the lands are drained—shoulder drains have been found to answer
upon mossy soil, where it is improper to put stones; but in general all drains
are built with walls, and covered with flags. Thinks paring and burning not
good farming. Wood very scarce in this part of the country. Farm houses rather
stand too much in the villages, and therefore inconvenient. Some cot∣ton mills,
which employ a good number of hands—no other manufactures. Does not think
the people trouble their heads much about improvements, and thinks the pre∣sent
stock of sheep well adapted for the soil and climate.</P>
<P>Continued our journey to Dent.—A great deal of good land,
but the general qua∣lity of the soil, thin and moist bottom. Learned that there
was a considerable quan∣tity of butter salted in this tract, and disposed of at
Skipton. Upon our road this day, saw two rams in an inclosure, chained
together; which is an excellent scheme to make them settle. Arrived at Dent,
after a tedious and disagreeable journey, having in the course of it passed
through a small part of Lancashire, and travelled about eight miles in the
county of Westmoreland.</P>
<P>We entered Dent dale from the west, and proceeded down the dale
to the town of Dent, which is nearly in the centre. This dale is entirely
surrounded with high moun∣tains, and has only one opening from the west, where
a carriage can enter with safety. It is about 12 miles in length, and from one
and a half to two miles in breadth. The whole dale is inclosed; and, viewed
from the higher grounds, presents the picture of a terrestrial paradise.</P>
<P>At Dent we received the following information relative to the
state of the dale.</P>
<P>Estates are small, and chiefly in the natural possession of the
proprietors. Inclo∣sures small, and mostly in grass. No farms above £ 50
a year, and none but yearly <PB N="112" REF="110"/> leases granted. Sheep mostly
from Scotland. Few cattle are fed, but a great number of milk cows are kept,
and large quantities of butter and cheese produced. The hills in the
neighbourhood of the dale, are all common, and dividing them among the
diffe∣rent proprietors, it is supposed, would be attended with beneficial
consequences. A considerable quantity of stockings wrought by women upon wires,
which are disposed of at Kendal. Very few turnips cultivated, hay being the
chief dependance in winter. Small tithes only drawn in kind, and a modus taken
in lieu of the great ones.</P>
<P>Returned from Dent to Ingleton, where we met, agreeable to
appointment, with Mr. Ellershaw, of Chappel le Dale, about four miles from this
place. Mr. Ellershaw gave us the first account of watering land, which is done
by him, and several of his neighbours, to great advantage: he floats it early
in the spring, which not only rots the moss, but enriches the land
considerably. The commons here are all stinted, every man who enjoys a
privilege upon them being restricted to the quantity of stock he is to put on
them. There is not much land limed in the neighbourhood, and what is done, is
applied very sparingly. Few or no leases granted; and where they are, but of
short duration. Tithes drawn in kind; but Mr. Ellershaw thinks it would be for
the peace and interest of the community to have them valued. No turnips raised.
Sheep generally of the Scotch kind. Wool sold at 6<HI>s.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> per
stone this season. Some stock∣ings knit for the Kendal market.</P>
<P>Visited Settle again on our road to Skipton. From Mr. York's
steward, at Long Preston, we learned that they had pared and burned a great
deal of the higher grounds, which had turned out well; and had tried wheat, but
found it did not answer. Oats is now their principal crop. After them the land
is fallowed and limed, and laid down with grass seeds. Their management, in
other respects, being similar to the rest of the country, it is unnecessary to
repeat it. At Gargrave, half way between Settle and Skipton, we saw most
excellent fields of grass. It is impossible to say what sorts of seeds had been
sown, or whether any had been sown at all: they seemed a mixture of all sorts
of hay-seeds, but richer grass cannot grow.</P>
<P>Arrived at Skipton. This place, which stands in the middle of
the district of Cra∣ven, is for distinction, usually called Skipton in
Craven.</P>
<P>At Skipton there is a large house employed in sorting and
combing wool. About 3000 packs are bought each season from Lincolnshire,
Nottingham, Leicester, and Rutland shires. After it is sorteo and combed, it is
spun at the Company's mills, at Linton and Addingham, in the neighbourhood, and
made into stuffs, viz. shalloons, calimancoes, and all sorts of double goods.
The noyles from the combing are used for the Duesbury and Rochdale
trade.—We received the following information from Mr. Hales, steward to
the Earl of Thanet.</P>
<P>The proprietors in the vale are, the Duke of Devonshire, Lord
Thanet, and a num∣ber of small freeholders. Farms of different sizes, but the
majority rather small. Soil deep and rich. The whole vale almost in grass,
being from the wetness of the climate accounted unfit for corn. What land is
ploughed, is upon the higher grounds, and oats the principal crop. Few or no
turnips cultivated. All the vale inclosed. Inclo∣sures small. Cannot say
whether inclosing has affected population or not, as it is such a long time
since the vale vas inclosed. No common fields here, but thinks, wherever they
are, they ought to be divided. Wages high—labourers from 18 <HI>d.</HI>
to 2 <HI>s.</HI> per day, women 1<HI>s.</HI> Not much paring and
burning—does not approve of it. Very little wood, <PB N="113" REF="111"/>
but thinks a great part of the moors might be planted to advantage. Provisions
high; beef being at this time 4 <HI>d.</HI> and often 5 <HI>d.</HI> and
5½<HI>d.</HI> Corn brought here from Rich∣mond in the North Riding.
Roads good. Farm houses in general well situated. Lord Thanet's estate upon
lease of 14 years. Duke of Devonshire grants none. Lord Tha∣net formerly
granted leases for 21 years, and the estate was much improved. Other es∣tates,
where leases have not been granted, are not half so much improved. The
cove∣nants laid down by Lord Thanet, are only to fallow, lime, and manage in a
husband∣like manner. No manufactures, except some cotton mills, which have done
no harm to the agriculture of the country. Grass lands in the vale, set from
40<HI>s.</HI> to 50<HI>s.</HI> per acre, and some at £3. Plough yoked
with three horses—no oxen used. Thinks it would be for the general good
that leases were always granted; and also that the pay∣ment of tithes was
regulated upon proper principles.</P>
<P>The management from Paitley-bridge to the western extremity of
the county, is almost uniformly the same, and grass the sole object. The people
unanimously think that corn will not pay so much rent as grass, therefore raise
very little, except upon the higher grounds; and at the same time lay all their
manure upon the rich, fertile fields in the vale. By this means they are
reduced to the absolute necessity of purchas∣ing corn, at an advanced price,
from other places, where more attention is paid to the cultivating it. From
what we could learn, a great deal more corn was formerly raised than now; which
is evident from tithes having decreased four-fifths in value within these
thirty or forty years.</P>
<P>We learned from the Rev. Mr. Wethnell, that the husbandry at
Keightly is much in the same style as here, only rather more corn raised, and
that the moors and high∣grounds are used for breeding cattle.</P>
<P>From Skipton proceeded down Wharfdale to Otley. For the first
four miles the soil is barren moor, and perfectly unimproveable, unless
planting will answer, which, from the highness of the situation, is very
doubtful, unless the larch will prosper. At Addingham, the soil turns good, and
the whole way to Otley remarkably rich. At Sir James Ibbelson's, at Denton,
there are fine large haughs of grass, and the inclosures larger than we have
seen in Yorkshire. Saw some corn fields upon the road, but not in good order;
and a few fields of fallow, not half wrought. Observed some turnips, the first
we have met with for a long time. Examined a plough; the first we have seen
these four days, and it appeared to be of the Dutch or Rotheram kind, but of
wretched construction. The field it was lying in was full of
quickens—provincially whickens. The land almost wholly inclosed.</P>
<P>At Otley we received a variety of information—We give the
substance of it:—</P>
<P>Soil very good. Climate dry. Some large proprietors, but a
greater number of small ones. Farms chiefly small, few above £ 50 rent.
Land mostly employed in pasture, and sown with white clover and hay-seeds.
Little land watered; but understood some people have done it to good effect.
When land is broke up from grass, three crops are taken, and then a fallow. Few
turnips are cultivated. Some lime used. Harvest early. Land all inclosed, and
thought much more valuable than when open field. Wood much scarcer than
formerly, but a great deal of the waste land might be planted to advantage.
Tithes compounded at 5 <HI>s.</HI> and 6 <HI>s.</HI> per acre. Rent of land
here 40 <HI>s.</HI> per acre, and all public burthens. Want of leases greatly
complained of. Some <PB N="114" REF="112"/> cotton mills, which have done good,
by employing young people. A common lately divided in the neighbourhood, which
has turned out well.</P>
<P>Arrived at Leeds.</P>
<P>Leeds is situated on the river Aire. It is a very ancient, and
populous town, and was of considerable repute during the Saxon government. The
woollen manufac∣tory has flourished here for several ages, which has both
enriched the inhabitants, and increased the value of all the land in the
neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The following is the most accurate accounts we could procure of
the state of hus∣bandry near Leeds.</P>
<P>The soil variable—a great part of it good, generally loam
upon a clay bottom. Climate dry. Land possessed by small proprietors, and
mostly occupied by manu∣facturers: a few of what are here called large farmers,
having from 100 to 150 acres of land. Land employed partly in pasture, partly
in meadow, and a propor∣tion in tillage, but ought to be all in grass upon
account of the great demand from Leeds for milk. Some clover, and rye-grass
sown. The stock kept upon the pastures are cows and horses belonging to the
manufacturers. Part of the land watered and turns out well. Grains cultivated
are wheat, barley, oats, and beans; also some rape, and turnips, which are
generally sown broadcast. A few beans are drilled. Fallowing much practised.
Large quantities of potatoes raised, and a great demand for them. Much lime is
used, and both grass, and fallow dunged. An ex∣cellent manure is got from the
sizing boilers' waste, which is the bones and remains of sheep feet, cows feet,
and sloughs of horns. Horses only used.—Seed time, and har∣vest early.
Land mostly inclosed, and rents greatly raised thereby. Inclosures from 5 to 8
acres, and the smallest ones most valuable, being possessed by clothiers, who
have no use for large ones. Inclosing in a manufacturing county must increase
po∣pulation. Very little waste land but what might be improved by dividing and
inclos∣ing. Wages.—Masons 15<HI>s.</HI> to 18<HI>s.</HI> per week.
Carpenters the same. Mill-wrights, 18<HI>s.</HI> to 21<HI>s.</HI> and day
labourers 9<HI>s.</HI> to 12<HI>s.</HI> Journeymen clothiers each from
9<HI>s.</HI> to 15<HI>s.</HI> per week. Ploughmen £ 12. per annum, with
victuals and beer. Very lit∣tle paring and burning, unless where commons are
newly divided—the expence from 19<HI>s.</HI> to 27<HI>s.</HI> per acre.
Not much wood, as land can be used to far greater advantage otherwise.
Provisions high—Beef 4½<HI>d.</HI> and 5<HI>d.</HI> and much
higher in spring. Roads in general but tolerable, owing to their being let to
undertakers, who neglect them. Houses for manufactures well constructed; and a
great many more wanted. Few leases—when granted, their duration from 3 to
15 years. The nature of the covenants in them is, that the tenant pays all
taxes, keeps all in repair, is bound not to break up any grass land, under
penalties, that run from 5<HI>s.</HI> to £20. per acre, and to have at
least two-thirds of the farm in grass; upon the tillage part he must not take
above 3 crops without fallowing, and all the fallows must be limed.</P>
<P>Broad cloth and other different manufactures are carried on
here, which have greatly increased rents. There are no agricultural societies,
but the people have a great turn for improvements—the expence is not
regarded. Several inclosure bills have passed for moors in the neighbourhood,
which have produced the most beneficial consequences. Tithes both small and
great, drawn in kind, but the general opinion <PB N="115" REF="113"/> is, that a
compensation in money, in place of them, would operate as a great
encou∣ragement to improvements. It was also the opinion of our informers, that
a general inclosure bill, upon proper principles, would be of great public
utility; as by it, they said, much expence would be saved to individuals,
houses would be provided for ma∣nufacturers, and the people prevented from
emigrating.</P>
<P>Left Leeds, and proceeded to Bradford. Rather more corn land
than we have as yet seen during the survey, but all in bad order. A good deal
of oak wood about Kirkstall Abbey, about 3 miles from Leeds. Observed a plough
at work, and drawn by 4 stout horses all in a line. The plough of a very
indifferent construction, and taking a very ebb furrow, not the depth of what 2
horses will do when yoked properly abreast—the land very much damaged by
the large sweep the horses took when turning. Saw another plough upon a soft
moor going with 3 horses—a very ebb furrow but the straightest we have as
yet seen in Yorkshire. Indeed in those parts of the coun∣try we have hitherto
surveyed, ploughs are so scarce, that they may almost, like horses at Venice,
be shewn as a curiosity.</P>
<P>Information got at Bradford.</P>
<P>The nature of the soil various, some parts being rich loam, and
others of a cold watery quality. Climate healthful. Land is possessed by small
proprietors, and occu∣pied by small farmers and manufacturers. It is almost all
in grass, and the seeds sown are mostly those called, natural hay-seeds. Cows
are the principal stock that is kept. Where the land is in tillage, wheat and
beans are sown in small quantities, but oats are the principal crop. Some good
farmers adopt the modern rotation of turnips, barley, clover, and wheat.
Fallowing is practised, but often in a very slovenly manner, and the rotation
in that case is, wheat, oats and oats; or wheat, beans, and oats. The country
is all inclosed; inclosures small, few exceeding 6 acres, and by them the
country has both been enriched and the land improved. Labourers wages,
9<HI>s.</HI> per week. Plough∣men £ 12 per annum, with victuals, lodging,
and washing. Paring and burning only practised where heath ground is broke up.
Few leases are granted, those that are, are generally for 11 years, and the
covenants are, to lime all the fallows; not to take more crops than 3; to keep
the premises in repair; not to sell hay, straw, or manure, provinci∣ally,
tillage; and not to assign. No practices can be pointed out here, that would be
of advantage in other districts, the inhabitants having both their minds and
capitals fixed upon trade.</P>
<P>Arrived at Halifax—the whole country from Bradford to this
place, being almost a continued village; roads bad ever since we lest Leeds,
and materials very scarce. Ob∣served most of the roads are provided with a
foot-path, paved with free stones, which is a most useful measure; but, strange
to tell, every person upon horseback uses the foot-paths. The first person we
saw going upon these large polished stones at full speed, we thought wrong in
the head, and every moment expected his horse would come down, and break the
rider's neck; but a short time convinced us that it was the universal
practice.</P>
<P>Halifax is a large and populous town, and is situated upon the
river Calder. It stands upon a gentle descent from east to west, which makes it
pleasant and conve∣nient. <PB N="116" REF="114"/> The houses are, in general,
built of brick, though free-stone appears to abound in the neighbourhood; and
as little attention appears to have been paid to the laying out the town at
first, the streets and buildings are rather irregular and confused. The woollen
manufacture has here flourished for near three centuries; and though the soil
in the neighbourhood has been originally barren, and probably, for that reason,
was chosen as a proper place for carrying on manufactures, yet the industry of
the people has been so great, as to improve almost every spot near the place,
thereby making good the old proverb, that a barren soil is an excellent
whetstone to promote industry.</P>
<P>The parish of Halifax is in the warpentake of Morley, and
consists of 26 townships or hamlets. The parish is of great extent, and
supposed equal in size to the whole county of Rutland. It is about 17 miles in
length, and 11 in breadth. From this extent it clearly appears that the ground
must have been a barren waste, and the po∣pulation of small amount, when the
parish was formed.</P>
<P>Several parts of the parish afford coals, which are absolutely
necessary for carrying on that extensive trade, for which this neighbourhood is
famous. The air is good, and chiefly blows from the west and south-west, and
often attended with heavy falls of rain; but, as there is but little level land
in the parish, the rain which falls soon runs off, and of consequence the
country is clean and dry, which contributes both to the ease and health of the
inhabitants.</P>
<P>We observed some fences of a very uncommon kind in this
neighbourhood. Large flag stones of 3 feet height, set upon their end, are
fastened in the ground, which make a fence both complete and agreeable. We
cannot speak to the expence, but as stones of that kind are here in plenty; we
suppose a fence of this kind will be com∣paratively cheap.</P>
<P>The cloth hall at Halifax, is a large building, the area being
300 feet in length, by 240 in breadth. Part of it is 3 stories high, the
remainder 2 stories, and it contains, no less than 315 different rooms, where
the manufactures of the town and neighbour∣hood are exposed to sale. It is open
each Saturday at 10 o'clock, and is shut by 12 o'clock. A bell is rung when the
market commences, and ceases; and those who purchase before or after market are
liable to a penalty. The original cost of the building was £ 12,000; and
we were informed that the value of goods in the hall is never considered at
less than £ 50,000 at a time.</P>
<P>Waited upon William Walker, Esq. at Crownest near Halifax, and
examined his im∣provements, which are executed with singular taste and
ingenuity. Mr. Walker waters his ground with great success, and it is all laid
off with great attention for this purpose. All his inclosures are in perfect
order, and his farm offices in the neatest condition.</P>
<P>Mr. Walker was so kind as to favour us with the following
accounts of the husbandry in the parish of Halifax.</P>
<P>The soil varies much, but in general is naturally poor.
Proprietors both large and small. Farms mostly small, and occupied by
manufacturers for the conveniency of keeping a cow or two, for the use of their
families, and conveying their goods to the mill and to the markets. The land is
principally in meadow pasture grass, and is sown with natural hay-seeds,
rib-grass, and rye-grass; and where it is not used for the manufac∣turer, as
mentioned above, it is pastured with a mixed stock of horned cattle and sheep.
Great advantages are found to result from overflowing the meadows at proper
sea∣sons, <PB N="117" REF="115"/> and particularly in time of floods. Land is
generally fallowed after the third crop. Sometimes turnips are taken upon the
fallow, then barley, clover, wheat, or oats. A small quantity of wheat is sown,
and very few beans. The lands, except the heath moors, are mostly inclosed, but
there are doubts, whether any advantages at all have resulted from inclosing
the waste lands in this parish. The size of inclo∣sures are in general from 2
to 4 acres. Inclosing in this parish has certainly had no tendency to decrease
population. The extent of waste ground, if we include the heath, can scarcely
be guessed at. It is, however, very considerable, and there is some worth the
expence of inclosing for cultivation: at any rate, it is worthy of
con∣sideration, whether it is not a desirable object, that each freeholder's
property be as∣certained, that such as are inclined to improvement, may do so
by planting or otherwise. Wages high, husbandmen get from 18<HI>d.</HI> to
20<HI>d.</HI> per day; in time of harvest 2<HI>s.</HI> Great attention is paid
to draining, which is done in a complete manner with stones. A very
inconsiderable quantity of wood-land in this parish. Price of provisions,
butter 12<HI>d,</HI> beef 3½<HI>d.</HI> and 4½, mutton 4½
and 5<HI>d.</HI> veal 4<HI>d.</HI> and 4½. The roads are very bad. The
houses and offices are built for the accommodation of the ma∣nufacturer, not of
the farmer. Leases are granted for various terms, from 7 to 21 years; but very
frequently no leases at all are granted. The principal manufacture here is
woollen and worsted goods, and some cottons. Manufactures are the grand object
of persons of all descriptions, and the land is divided into small farms, in
aid of the ma∣nufacturer. There are very few who attend, in any degree, to the
cultivation and improvement of the ground, which is regarded only as a
secondary object.</P>
<P>Set off for Wakefield. The soil appeared thin for a considerable
part of the way, and rather of an inferior quality. At Dewsbury the ground
turned better, and a num∣ber of fine fields appeared upon the banks of the
Calder below this place. The road from Halifax to Wakefield in most shocking
condition, and the heaviest stage we have travelled. Observed the materials are
of bad quality, and that to render them harder, a great part of them are burnt
before they are laid on the road; also that clay was burnt into a kind of
brick, and used likewise for repairing the roads. Want of proper materials is a
local disadvantage, for which the road surveyors can never be blamed. They
seemed however to us, to be carrying on the repairs upon bad prin∣ciples:
instead of filling up the old ruts, which were very deep, and levelling the
sur∣face, a new covering was laid indiscriminately on, which will never bed
firmly, or consolidate in any situation. Besides, the repairs were carrying on
at an improper season, for the roads appeared to receive considerable damage
from driving the materials.</P>
<P>Saw 3 large strong horses this afternoon, drawing a light break
harrow, which might have been easily worked with two. The horses go uniformly
in a line, and seem much stronger than any we saw in the northern parts of the
Riding.</P>
<P>Wakefield is a large well-built market town, and possesses a
considerable share of the cloathing trade. It is very populous, and has two
market days weekly, at which great quantities of cloth, wool, corn, and
provisions of all kinds are sold. It stands upon the river Calder, which by an
act of Parliament 1698 was made navigable as far as this place. A canal is, at
this present time, making from hence to Barnsley.</P>
<P>From Wakefield to Pontefract, the soil is much drier, and corn
fields more nume∣rous. Passed a large common field, which appeared in very bad
order. Arrived at Pontefract, and met with a number of intelligent farmers,
from whom we received <PB N="118" REF="116"/> much information. They all
concurred in one sentiment with regard to tithes, viz. that it would be a
material encouragement to improvements if they were commuted; also that every
common field in the kingdom ought to be divided. Provisions very high. Barley
sold in the market this day at 40<HI>s.</HI> per quarter.</P>
<P>Information received at Pontefract, about the cultivation of
Liquorice, from Mr. Hally, seedsman and nurseryman there.</P>
<P>The soil most proper for liquorice, is that of a deep, light,
sandy loam. It is trenched three feet, well dunged, and planted with stocks and
runners in the months of February and March, on beds of one yard wide, thrown
up in ridges, with alleys betwixt them, and the beds hoed and hand-weeded. The
first year a crop of onions, is taken in the alleys, and the tops of the
liquorice cut over every year. The ground is trenched when the liquorice is
taken up, and all the fibres cut off. A considerable quantity more than 100
acres, is cultivated in this neighbourhood. It is a very pre∣carious plant,
often rotten by wetness, and also hurt by sharp frosts in the spring, and dry
weather afterwards. Rent of the land, upon which it is cultivated, about 3
<HI>l.</HI> per acre.</P>
<P>Mr. Halley also cultivates rhubarb, and has done it to
advantage. The quality is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ed good,
and he lately received a medal from the society of arts for the culture of it.
Land about Pontefract of very fine quality, sets from 40 to 50<HI>s.</HI> per
acre, and is kept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>early in equal
proportions of pasture and tillage.</P>
<P>Waited upon Mr. Green at Cridling Park near Ferrybridge. Mr.
Green rents this farm from one of the colleges at Cambridge. Is a complete
farmer, and keeps his land in good order, but is
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>surdly restricted by his lease
from breaking up old grass. Here we received the following information.</P>
<P>Soil of various qualities, lime-stone, clay, and sand, being the
prevailing ones. Upon the lime-stone the following rotation is adopted. 1st.
fallow, 2d. barley, 3d. clover, 4th. wheat. Upon the clay, 1st. fallow, 2d.
wheat, 3d. beans, 4th. wheat or oats. Upon the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nd, turnips, barley, clover, and
wheat. Both estates and farms generally large, and the farms kept in equal
proportions of pasture and tillage. Does not water his land, but wishes it was
in his power, as he thinks the practice ad∣vantageous. A great deal of lime
used; about 48 bushels applied to the acre, and repeated every fallow. The
fallow also manured with stable and pigeon dung. Ploughs of the Dutch kind, and
wrought sometimes with two horses abreast, at other times with three abreast,
and often with four, yoked in pairs. Seed time and harvest early. Land all
inclosed, and the size from 5 to 12 acres. Advantages of inclosing great, and
population increased by it. Some common fields, which would be greatly improved
by dividing and inclosing. Very little waste land; servants wages 10<HI>s.</HI>
per week, and find themselves in victuals; and from 5<HI>s.</HI> to
6<HI>s.</HI> when kept in the house. Paring and burning only practised upon the
commons that are taken in, and upon old coarse land; expence from 16<HI>s.</HI>
to 24<HI>s.</HI> Wood sufficient to serve country purposes. Provisions high,
beef and mutton about one penny per pound higher in the spring months than at
this time of the year. Farm houses and offices might be greatly improved; some
leases granted for 21 years; but the practice of giving them from year to year,
is fast coming in, which is both a loss to the farmer, and a bar to
im∣provements. <PB N="119" REF="117"/> Thinks restrictions in the lease a
hardship upon a good farmer. The people have a turn for improvements. Thinks
that a general inclosure bill would be of material advantage to the public.</P>
<P>Proceeded southward for Mr. Gill's at Natton. The lands upon the
road of good quality, and well farmed. Fallows clean. Saw some very large
fields of wheat making a vigorous appearance.</P>
<P>Information from Mr. Gill.</P>
<P>Soil generally of good quality, part of it gravel, the rest
clay, upon a wet bottom. About two-thirds of the ground kept in tillage, and
one-third in pasture. Red and white clover sown with rye-grass. Breeds a few
horses, and feeds both cattle and sheep. Rotation—fallow, upon which
turnips are taken, barley, clover, and wheat, sometimes oats. Uses a good deal
of lime, but applies only 30 bushels to the acre. Brings great quantities of
bones from Sheffield, which is at 20 miles distance, and lays on 50 bushels per
acre; costs from 15<HI>d.</HI> to 18<HI>d.</HI> per bushel, besides carriage.
Plough of the Dutch kind, and wrought mostly with two horses abreast, but
some∣times with four in strong land. Carts of the ordinary construction of the
country, and drawn by three horses. Land all inclosed, which Mr. Gill thinks of
great ad∣vantage. Size of inclosures from 2 to 14 acres. Thinks small
inclosures very hurt∣ful. There are several common fields in the neighbourhood,
which should be divided and inclosed; very little waste land; wages of a
ploughman, £ 11 per annum, and victuals. A good deal of land is drained,
big stones being set in the bottom of the drain, leaning towards one another,
and filled up with small stones. Paring and burn∣ing practised here; but the
landlord's consent must be got—expence 20<HI>s.</HI> per acre. Roads
generally good and well managed, but materials bad. Funds are 6 days labour of
a team for £50 rent, and 9<HI>d.</HI> per pound assessment upon the rent.
No leases granted, which he thinks retards improvements. Tithes paid for in
money, at the rate of 6<HI>s.</HI> or 7<HI>s.</HI> per acre. Sheep in this
neighbourhood are either of the Scotch kind, or purchased at Peniston, from the
moors in the western parts of the county: the wool of the former sells for
about 8<HI>d.</HI> per lb. the other 9<HI>d.</HI> People have a turn for
improvements, and know no obstacles but the want of leases, and payment of
tithes.</P>
<P>Having a letter for Mr. Spencer Stanhope, of Cannon hall, we
went there, but un∣luckily he was from home, being with the West Riding
Militia, at Tinmouth barracks. Called for the steward;—who gave it as his
opinion that it would be for the public interest, that all land was set under
lease, with proper restrictions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are not fond of
introducing into this work, subjects that are not connected with Agriculture,
or the state of the country; but the inscription which we saw under the picture
of a dog, in the hall here, was so remarkable, that we cannot help inserting
it.—<Q REND="inline">"Rover, a hound, the property of John Spencer,
Esq. in the year 1753, being very mangy, and suspected of madness, was
condemned to the gallows, where, on 16th August, he was hanged for the space of
a quarter of an hour, by Thomas Beck, the huntsman: being let down, and some
small symptoms of life appearing in him, he was tucked up for another quarter
of an hour, and then thrown into a coal pit, 30 yards deep; from which he was
extracted on the 13th November, by the said Thomas Beck, alive and in good
health.—He was twelve weeks and five days in the coal
pit."</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>Arrived at Bretton hall, the seat of Mr. Beaumont, and
experienced the greatest at∣tention from that gentleman. He was at the trouble
personally to shew us a part of <PB N="120" REF="118"/> his large estate, which
is farmed in as complete a style as any in Yorkshire. Saw very fine broadcast
turnips at Mr. Brook's, one of Mr. Beaumont's tenants: they were re∣markably
clean, a thing rather uncommon in this country. Were introduced to se∣veral of
the tenants, whom we found sensible, industrious men. They were busy sow∣ing
their clover leas with wheat. Their young grasses were making a most vigorous,
close, and equal appearance. Mr. Beaumont has a good deal of wood upon his
estate, which is very thriving and profitable. Farm-houses and offices are
excellently constructed, and well situated. Understood the late Sir Thomas
Blacket, Mr. Beaumont's father-in-law, was very attentive to these matters; and
although he granted no leases, was other∣wise a kind and indulgent master.</P>
<P>Examined Mr. Beaumont's flock of sheep: those of the Shetland
breed are not doing well; whether the climate is against that kind or not, we
cannot say, but the fact is, they are not thriving in body, and their wool is
fallen off.</P>
<P>The Ryeland or Hereford breed are doing but middling, and the
Peniston or country breed, best of all. It will be a curious fact, if it turns
out that the original breed of every country is best adapted to the nature of
the soil and climate. Saw some good sheep at Mr. Hague's one of Mr. Beaumont's
tenants. Mr. Hague, had three sorts, one from the Duke of Newcastle in
Nottinghamshire, one of his own breed, and the other of the Peniston. We
thought his own excellent. Mr. Hague has got a tup of the Bakewell sort, with
whom he is to cross his own ewes, which we thought would produce a capital
breed.</P>
<P>Saw two threshing machines of the small construction, each drawn
with two horses, and making clean work, One of them was threshing wheat, the
other oats, and the draught appeared quite easy to the horses.</P>
<P>Went and viewed a large cloth manufacture at Netherton, upon Mr.
Beaumont's es∣tate. The whole progress is here carried on, from buying the
wool, to finishing the goods. Every thing appeared carried on in a regular
manner, by Mr. Bryant the manufacturer. Wool chiefly from Norfolk and Sussex,
with some Spanish. Mr. Bryant has 80 acres of land, adjoining his manufactory,
which he has highly improved by bruised bones, and the refuse of the boiled
size used in his manufactory.</P>
<P>From Mr. Beaumont's steward and tenants, we received instructing
information relative to the husbandry practised upon his estate. Is would take
too much of this journal to give the whole of it, must therefore content
ourselves with an abridge∣ment.</P>
<P>The soil is variable, chiefly hazle kind of earth, mixed with
clay and a loamy sand, both retentive of water. Some parts dry and sharp, well
adapted for turnips, which are generally cultivated upon all the fallows, and
eaten with sheep. Proprietors here, are Mr. Beaumont, Mr. Wentworth, Mr.
Stanhope, &amp;c. Size of farms from 150 to 200 acres. Land chiefly in tillage;
one-third only kept in pasture; several rotations of crops are practised; 1st.
fallow, wheat, oats, and barley. 2d. turnips, barley, clo∣ver, and wheat. Often
hay-seeds and white clover is sown with the barley, upon which sheep are
pastured for two or three years. No land watered, but thought ad∣viseable when
opportunity allows. Manures used are dung, lime, rape dust, and lately a great
deal of bones. Mr. Hague, says bones answer best on the turnip land, 100
bushels of bone, and four loads of dung, mixed with good earth, is laid upon a
statute acre. Quantity of lime applied to the acre, generally about 90 bushels.
<PB N="121" REF="119"/> Rape dust one chalder per acre, price £ 3.
12<HI>s.</HI> besides carriage. Rape often sown for sheep feed, but not
cultivated for seed; at least what is done, is in very small quantities.
Carriages with broad wheels are used for the fields, and narrow wheels for the
roads. Ploughs used, are of the Dutch or Rotheram kind, yoked sometimes with
two horses abreast, at other times three in a line. No oxen used; wheat sown
from the beginning of October, to the end of November; sometimes to February,
after turnips: but that season not approved of: spring corn in March and April.
Harvest variable, generally commences about the 18th August, and over by
Michaelmas. Land chiefly inclosed; inclosing of great advantage, and thought to
be one-fourth more value than open field. Inclosures from two to twenty acres;
average about ten acres; inclosing thought to increase population. A few common
fields in the neighbourhood, and these thought to be under bad management; very
little waste land: wages for ploughmen £ 12 per annum, with victuals,
washing, and drink. In harvest, labourers 2<HI>s.</HI> per day, and
2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> with beer. Hours of work from six to six, with one
hour allowed to din∣ner, and another for the two drinkings: in winter from
light to dark. Draining a most necessary article of improvement, and great
attention bestowed on it; two stones being set up leaning on each other, and
the drain filled up with small stones. Paring and burning practised, but not
thought good farming; expence when done 21 <HI>s.</HI> per acre, with beer,
which makes it equal to 24<HI>s.</HI> A good deal of oak and ash wood in the
neighbourhood, generally cut once in 21 years, a regular portion being done
annually, sometimes sells so high as £80. per acre. Provisions—beef
from 3<HI>d.</HI> to 5 <HI>d.</HI> mutton 4½<HI>d.</HI> butter 11
<HI>d.</HI> and 1 <HI>s.</HI> all avoirdupois weight. Roads in this township
good, but bad in many others; supported by the statute work of six days labour
of a team for every £50. rent, and 6 <HI>d.</HI> a pound assessment; but
this rate may be raised higher by the justices, if they see necessary. Farm
houses and offices good, and well con∣structed for serving the purposes of
husbandry. Some manufactures creeping in, which are raising wages. The people
here have a great turn to improvements, and have no obstacle but want of
leases; which from the kindness of their landlord, is little felt. There is no
restriction upon their management that is hurtful, but one, which prevents them
from breaking up their grass land that has lain six years, without the
landlord's consent.</P>
<P>Mr. Slinger at Emly Woodhouse, upon Mr. Beaumont's estate,
practises the drill husbandry both for wheat, pease, and beans; but does not
think drilling at all times and in every situation, adviseable. Mr. Slinger
uses a machine for threshing his corn, which he thinks does the work much
better than is done by the flail: and which machines are particularly necessary
here, since wages became so extravagantly high. No want of hands in this
neighbourhood to cut the crop. In the year 1792, the scarcity was great in the
East-Riding, but felt here no farther than rising wages. An inclosing bill
lately passed for dividing land near Wakefield; but as it is not yet put in
execution, cannot say how it will operate,—are unanimously of opinion
that all commons ought to be divided, as they know some that formerly carried
only some beggarly sheep, now improved into good fields.</P>
<P>Arrived at Barnsley.</P>
<P>Barnsley, or Black Barnsley, is a town of considerable size, and
situated in the wa∣pentake of Staincross; it carries on a considerable trade in
wire, and has a manufactory <PB N="122" REF="120"/> for bleaching and weaving
linen yarn, which is in a flourishing state. There is a weekly market held
here, where corn and all sorts of provisions are sold. It being mar∣ket day
when we were there, had an opportunity to see the quality of the different
grains. Wheat and barley good, but the oats very indifferent, which in general
we found to be the case over all the West Riding.</P>
<P>At Barnsley we received information from several persons,
relative to the agricul∣ture of the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Soil generally clay and gravel. Climate mild. The greatest part
of the land in the hand of small proprietors. Size of farms 20 acres and
upwards. Greatest part of the land in tillage. Pasture sown with white clover,
trefoil, and hay-seeds. Some red clover which is ploughed down for wheat. All
kinds of grain sown, 3 crops to a fallow. Rota∣tion, as usually practised upon
the dry land, is turnips, barley, clover, and wheat. A good deal of lime used,
4 chalders applied to the acre, with some bone manure. Plough of the Dutch
kind; 3 horses commonly yoked in a line, and sometimes 4 upon the clay land.
Land mostly inclosed, the inclosures from 4 to 10 acres. Some common fields,
but thought one-third less in value than inclosed lands. Paring and burning
practised—thought useful when old grass land is broke up. Country
sufficiently wooded, both with oak and ash. The people have a turn for
improvements, if they were not prevented by want of leases and injurious
covenants betwixt them and their landlords.</P>
<P>The land to the southward of Barnsley of the finest quality,
being either a clay or a loam fit for turnips, and a great proportion of it
kept in tillage. Mr. Hemmingway at Wombwell, gave us an account of his
practice, which is very correct. He keeps about one-fourth of his farm in
pasture, which is sown down with white clover and hay∣seeds; sometimes sows red
clover by itself, pastures it in the spring, and then lets the crop stand for
seed; sows white clover for the same purpose, and has often 6 bushels red per
acre, and 4 bushels white. If good in quality, a bushel weighs 66 lb. Employs
his pasture to support his farm stock, and in feeding ewes and lambs—ewes
of the long woolled kind from Northumberland, and rams of the Bakewell breed.
Does not water any land but approves of it when situation allows. Cultivates
turnips in large quantities, some of them drilled. Fallows every fourth year,
and manures with dung, rape dust, and bones. Plough of the Dutch kind, and
wrought with two horses abreast. Carts long in the body, and of the same
construction with the rest of the country. Land mostly
inclosed—inclosures from 5 to 15 acres. Does not think inclosing can ever
decrease population. Pares and burns old grass land, expence 21<HI>s.</HI> per
acre. Pays great atten∣tion to draining—makes the drains 2 feet deep, 18
inches wide at top, and 12 at bot∣tom, and fills them with stones. Roads very
bad, and materials scarce. Few leases granted, which he thinks a bad plan.</P>
<P>From Barnsley to Peniston the country falls off, and is of a
moorish soil near the lat∣ter place. A market for sheep is held, and large
quantities of those that go by that name, are sold weekly. They are bred on the
moors to the westward of Peniston, and on those of Cheshire and
Derbyshire—prices at present low, and sale dull. Had a meeting with
several farmers, who communicated to us the following information con∣cerning
the husbandry of the adjoining country.</P>
<P>The climate cold and backward to vegetation. Soil very variable,
but mostly wet and spongy, and a great deal of moor carrying little but heath.
Proprietors small, <PB N="123" REF="121"/> Mr. Bosville of Gurthwaite, the
representative of one of the oldest families in the county, being the only
large one. Farms likewise small, except upon the moors. In the vicinity of the
town about one half is ploughed, but in the moors there is little or no tillage
at all. The stock is sheep and long horned cattle, of the Derbyshire breed,
which are smaller than the Craven breed. Little grain is cultivated, except
oats and a small quantity of wheat. Dung chiefly applied to the meadow land
that has been cut for hay, and 2 chalders of lime per acre laid upon the
fallows. Plough wrought with 4 horses yoked in a line. Few oxen used. Seed time
and harvest late, sometimes November before the harvest is concluded. Some land
about the place inclosed, but to the westward it is all common moors; which
ought at least to be divided, and every man's property laid by itself. A great
deal of the land needs draining, but the proper method of doing it, not well
understood. Farmers generally debarred from paring and burning, but thought a
great means of improvement upon some lands. Few proprie∣tors grant leases, but
it would be for the advantage of the farmer to have them.—The Rev. Mr.
Horsefall, in answer to this question said, if he was a farmer, he would lay
out his money more frankly under the security of a lease, than if he had none.
Many restrictions are in the leases, or yearly bargains.—Some farmers
thought to need them, but an active industrious man hurt by limitations.</P>
<P>Left Peniston for Sheffield. Most of the way the soil
indifferent.—Saw some patches of turnips, but none of them good. Road to
Sheffield high, and very un∣equal: Fine country to the northward, and abounding
with oak-wood.</P>
<P>Sheffield is situated upon the river Don, and has long been a
staple place for cut∣lery ware of all kinds. It is a populous town, containing
not less than 40,000 inha∣bitants. The lord of the manor is the Duke of
Norfolk, who likewise possesses a large estate in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Information from Mr. Peach at the Angel Inn, who occupies
several farms.</P>
<P>Soil generally of a deep clay, and from the quantity of manure,
very rich.—Cli∣mate moderate. Some great proprietors, such as the Duke of
Norfolk; but a number of small freeholders. In the neighbourhood, most part of
the farms are small, and the Duke of Norfolk is reducing their size, as fast as
the leases expire, for the con∣veniency of the inhabitants. About a third part
of the land is kept in tillage. Grasses sown for pasture are, white clover, and
hay-seeds, and red clover, and a little rye-grass for cutting. Rotation
practised by Mr. Peach is, after breaking up his pasture land,—oats,
winter tares, oats again, frequently wheat, pease, and then summer fal∣low;
which is ploughed as often as possible. Limes most of the fallows from
Derby∣shire, with 2 five-horse waggon loads per acre, the prime cost of which
is, £1. 2<HI>s.</HI> carriage £2. 10<HI>s.</HI> in all £3.
12<HI>s.</HI> per acre, lays it on before harvest. The Derby∣shire lime answers
better than the kind brought from the neighbourhood of Doncas∣ter; but the
latter sort thought superior for building. Cultivates a good deal of turnips,
all in broadcast; sold some this season, to be drawn, at £12. per acre.
Uses bone dust, which answers well upon wet land. Yokes 2 horses in a plough,
but sometimes, when the land is stiff, employs more. Wishes to sow as early as
possible, as the harvest is rather late. Wages high, a good ploughman
£14. per annum, with victuals and beer; labourers 10<HI>s.</HI>
6<HI>d.</HI> per week, with beer. In hay time and harvest gives them victuals
also. Inclosing a great improvement, and increases population. 
<PB N="124" REF="122"/> No common fields here, but thinks them bad things. A
great deal of waste land within a few miles of the town, which would be
valuable if divided and inclosed. Leases generally granted here.—The Duke
of Norfolk grants them for 21 years; where they are not granted, thinks there
is no encouragement to improve. Thinks there should be no restrictions in any
lease, but for the last 3 years.—Provisions high, beef and mutton
4½<HI>d.</HI> veal 5<HI>d.</HI> and much higher in spring. Is not fond
of paring and burning, unless in particular situations. Drains a great deal; in
wet bot∣toms, lays brush-wood first, and stones above. Roads generally bad, but
more atten∣tion paid to them since the mail-coach came this way.—Thinks
the agriculture of the neighbourhood is greatly improved by trade and
manufactures; they provide a large quantity of additional manure, and a good
market for the produce, which much more than compensates for the increase of
wages occasioned by them.</P>
<P>Waited upon John Booth, Esq. of Brush-house, about three miles
from Sheffield, who obligingly favoured us with the following information.</P>
<P>Soil in this neighbourhood a hazle loam, well calculated for
turnips—Climate mid∣dling—Average gage of rain 33 inches in a
season, which is about a medium be∣twixt what falls in Lancashire, and on the
east coast. Large proprietors are the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Fitzwilliam, and
Countess of Bute; but there is a number of small freeholders. Farms small; in
the neighbourhood of Sheffield, from 20 to 60 acres. Near that place
three-fourths of the land is in pasture, and at a greater dis∣tance, about
one-half. Some red clover, and rye-grass is sown, but the general practice is
to sow white clover, with hay-seeds. The pasture grass is chiefly stocked with
milk cows, and a few sheep, which are mostly of the Peniston breed. Little land
is watered, but approves of it when it can be conveniently practised. Rotation
of crops most approved of is turnips, barley, clover, and wheat. Fallow
practised, but not on a large scale, unless in case of turnips. A great deal of
bone dust used, 40 bushels to the acre, at 18<HI>d.</HI> per bushel; but has
done it to the extent of 80 bushels per acre, with advantage; ploughs with two
horses abreast; does not approve of the large carts and waggons, and thinks
carts of a smaller construction of more utility to the husbandman. Wages for
labourers are 10<HI>s.</HI> per week, and a free house. Mow∣ing corn, from
6<HI>s.</HI> to 10<HI>s.</HI> per acre, grass 3<HI>s.</HI> No want of hands for
harvest work; approves of paring and burning on old grass land, expence 21
<HI>s.</HI> per acre. Country not sufficiently wooded, a great deal more
wanted. Duke of Norfolk has about 1500 acres of wood in this parish; cuts once
in 24 years, and leaves a number of trees of different ages each cutting.</P>
<P>Thinks if the waste lands and moors were divided, planting upon
them would thrive and do well. Roads might be greatly improved; surveyors
recommended by a vestry meeting; and reports made of the work annually. Farm
houses and offices impro∣perly constructed, and badly situated; often built at
random, without any attention paid to the situation or convenience of the farm.
Most part of the proprietors here grant leases, and think it impossible to
practise good farming without them. Thinks many of the covenants in the leases
are destructive to improvements; manufactures of great use to agriculture; no
agricultural societies here at present; but remembers one formerly at
Sheffield, which subsisted for a number of years. Several inclosing bills have
lately passed for fields in this neighbourhood, which have produced very
be∣neficial consequences. Thinks people have a turn for improvements.</P>
<PB N="125" REF="123"/>
<P>Information from Mr. Odey, at Darnhill near Sheffield.</P>
<P>Soil in general loamy, and inclined to moisture, and the land in
the immediate vi∣cinity of Sheffield chiefly employed in pasture, hay, and
gardens; all grains cultivated, but no regular rotation. Little land fallowed
in this neighbourhood; manures used, are stable dung, lime, and bone dust;
fresh land when taken up, is sown with wheat, then beans; and continued under
the same crops as long as possible. Difference be∣twixt common field and
inclosed land of similar quality, £ 25. per cent. Paring and burning
practised, even upon the stubbles, which are often pared every year. The
country not sufficiently wooded, owing to the great demand from the
manufacturers. Leases generally granted from 11 to 21 years. Restricted in
general by them, to keep two-thirds in grass; manufactures have a good effect
on agriculture, but the manufacturing interest preponderates so much here, that
agriculture becomes only a secondary object. Thinks that tithes are a hardship,
and a great bar to the improvement of agriculture. When Mr. Odey first occupied
this farm, only four loads of wheat were produced upon the acre; but now owing
to the improvements made by him, at a great expence, twelve loads are
produced.</P>
<P>Bone dust, or as it is here called, hand tillage, is used to
great extent upon all the fields for twenty miles round Sheffield. Bones of all
kinds are gathered with the greatest industry, and are even imported from
distant places. They are broke through a mill made for that purpose; are
sometimes laid on the ground without any mixture; but it is supposed most
advantageous to mix them up with rich earth, into a compost, and when
fermentation has taken place, is the proper time to lay them on the ground. We
also heard of another manure, which can never be more than a local one, viz.
the refuse of hogs bristles from the brush manufactories. One gentle∣man
informed us that he had manured four acres with this refuse, and that its
effect greatly surpassed that of street dung, which the rest of the field had
been covered with.</P>
<P>Leaving Sheffield, we came to Rotheram, which is a place famous
for iron works. Examined several farms in the neighbourhood, which are
generally in good order, par∣ticularly that of Mr. Taylor at Canklaw Mills.
This farm is held upon a lease of 21 years from the Duke of Norfolk, and
appears under excellent management.</P>
<P>Mr. Taylor deals largely in the turnip and grass husbandry. His
land intended for turnips next season had, when we were there, (November 9th)
got three plough∣ings, and appeared almost as clean as many summer fallows. His
inclosures are in ca∣pital order, all hedges being neatly dressed, and
completely fencible. Keeps a great many sheep, which are of the Dishley breed,
and his pastures are of fine quality, be∣ing as close at the bottom as if 10
years old, although but newly sown down.</P>
<P>At Aldwark near Rotheram, we received the following information
from Mr. Wig∣full.</P>
<P>The soil about two or three miles round this place, is in
general a rich hazle loam, and the climate is warm and dry. The principal
proprietors are the Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Leeds, Earl Fitzwilliam, Earl of
Strafford, Mr. Foljambe, and the Messrs. Walkers. But there are also a great
number of small proprietors. Farms small in size, being mostly from 20 to 70
acres, and kept nearly in equal proportions of pas∣ture and tillage. The
grasses cultivated, are chiefly white clover and hay-seeds. Red 
<PB N="126" REF="124"/> clover is sown by itself, and reserved for seed. Not
many cattle or sheep bred in the neighbourhood, but a good number of horses
since they advanced in price. All kinds of grain are cultivated here; and the
general rotation is fallow or turnips, barley, clo∣ver, and wheat. The manures
used, are stable dung, rape dust, bone dust, horn shavings, &amp;c. Land mostly
inclosed, which Mr. Wigfull thinks has increased the value of land one-fourth.
The wages here are high; ploughmen 10<HI>s.</HI> per week, be∣sides drink.
Labourers eighteen pence and two shillings per day. Farm houses and offices are
very improperly situated. They ought to be placed, if possible, in the middle
of the farm, and not in a corner, as at present. The public roads are
gene∣rally good, but a number of the by ones are in miserable order.
Manufactures of iron and steel, are carried on in the neighbourhood to great
extent, which are found to produce good effects upon agriculture, by increasing
the riches of the country, and consequently affording a ready market for every
article the farmer raises. The peo∣ple have a great turn for improvements, but
their genius is cramped for want of leases, and by injurious restrictions laid
on them by the proprietors. Tithes are generally drawn here in kind, both small
and great. Mr. Wigfull suggested that it would be a great improvement in other
places of the country, to introduce the sowing winter
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ares, which are excellent spring
food for horses when their keep is very dear; and was likewise of opinion, it
would be a great improvement in his own neighbourhood, if the corn was cut
lower, which would not only take the crop up much cleaner, but also be the
means of accumulating a large additional quantity of manure.</P>
<P>Mr. Wigfull was of very great service to us during our stay in
the neighbourhood, and was the means of introducing us to a large company of
intelligent farmers, at the house of Mr. John Hall, at Icklea, from whom we
received most interesting informa∣tion. We here give an abstract of it.</P>
<P>The majority of farms are small, and about two-thirds of them
kept in tillage. A variety of grasses are sown; such as red and white clover,
trefoil, rye grass, and above all, hay-seeds. These seeds, when intended for
pasture, are sown very thick, no less than eighteen pounds weight white clover,
and three quarters of hay-seeds, to the sta∣tute acre. Cattle are of the long
horned breed, but most of the pasture is eat by sheep of the Bakewell kind;
which breed is fast spreading in this part of the country. Very little land
watered here; but the practice thought advantageous, and in proper situations
esteemed of equal value to a top dressing of manure. All sorts of grains are
cultivated, red wheat especially. Rotation; turnips upon the dry land,
otherwise summer fallow, barley, clover, wheat, oats, or pease; four crops
generally taken to a fallow. A great deal of lime used; applied at the rate of
one hundred bushels per acre; expence 50<HI>s.</HI> Almost the whole land
inclosed, which is supposed an advantage equal to one-third, and is the means
of increasing population. Paring and burning much practised; expence
21<HI>s.</HI> per acre.</P>
<P>Farm houses and offices, in general very badly constructed, and
improperly situated. People have a great turn for improvements, but are
prevented by the following ob∣stacles; want of leases; restrictions in the mode
of management, which hinders the farmer from exerting his abilities, and
introducing new practices; and tithes, when taken in kind. Mr. Hall informed
us, that the tithes of wheat were sometimes com∣muted for fifteen shillings per
acre, when the landlord's rent was only twelve shillings. <PB N="127" REF="125"/> Mr. Hall has a rape mill; and manufactures a great deal of oil,
which is generally sold to Lancashire. Purchases rape seed in the East Riding,
and Norfolk; pre∣sent price £ 3 per quarter, and five quarters often
raised upon an acre.</P>
<P>Having a letter from Sir John Sinclair to Earl Fitzwilliam, we
proceeded to Went∣worth-house, but unluckily his lordship was in
Northamptonshire. Delivered the let∣ter to Mr. Bounds, his chief steward, who
paid us every attention, and from whom we received full information relative to
the management of his lordship's large and va∣luable estate. Mr. Bounds was at
the trouble of bringing some of the principal farmers in the neighbourhood to
us, from whom we received full and accurate answers to the different queries we
had circulated. The following is the substance of the intelligence we
received.</P>
<P>Soil variable; both clay upon a wet bottom, and a hazle loam;
farms small, not many above £ 100 rent, and chiefly kept in tillage, not
above a fourth part being in pasture; grasses cultivated are natural hay-seeds,
white clover and tresoil; little red clover sown; both sheep and cattle fed
upon the pastures. The cattle are generally of the Craven breed; sheep partly
of the polled sort, and a good many from the moors above Peniston. General
rotation of crops is turnips, barley, clover, and wheat. Where the land is
strong, it is clean summer fallowed, and sown with wheat at Mi∣chaelmas; of all
the manures that are used, bone dust is sound to have the most effect; 60
bushels applied to the acre, and often bought so high as 20<HI>d.</HI> per
bushel. Ploughs and carts are of the common sort; the carts are 7½ feet
in length, 3 feet 2 inches in breadth, and 2 feet 2 inches deep, and will hold
1 chalder, or 32 bushels, ge∣nerally drawn by 3 horses in a line. Few oxen
wrought; Lord Fitzwilliam uses some, but the farmers use horses from their
being most expeditious. Land mostly inclosed, the advantages of which are
great, being estimated equal to £ 25 per cwt.; the inclosures are small,
being regulated by the size of the farms; few townships but what have common
fields, and these ought to be divided. Not much waste land, but what is of this
kind is highly improvable. Wages very high; ploughmen £ 14 a year,
besides victuals, drink, and washing; labourers 2<HI>s.</HI> per day in summer,
and 16<HI>d.</HI> in winter. Drains of various sizes, and filled with stones,
but the extent depends upon the goodness of the farmer. A good farmer always
drains where necessary, a bad one neglects it in all situations. Paring and
burning practised upon strong rush land, but thought bad husbandry upon light
soils. A good deal of wood in the country, but from being too early cut, woods
are turning weaker and weaker; cut one in 21 years, a part being left each
cutting; some trees left to the age of 60 years, a few particular ones longer,
mostly used in the collieries. Provisions at present high; beef and mutton
4½<HI>d.</HI> per lb.; wheat 6<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> per bushel,
barley 5<HI>s.</HI> oats 3<HI>s.</HI> and beans 6<HI>s.</HI> Farm houses and
offices, in general, properly constructed for the size of the farms and stock
kept. Leases seldom granted. No agricultural societies; but the people have a
great turn for improvement, the principal obstacle to which is pay∣ing tithes
in kind. There are few estates in the neighbourhood exempt from paying both
small and great tithes, but they are more usually compounded for than drawn in
kind. The greatest benefits that have been produced from inclosing open fields
and waste land, are in those places where the great and small tithes have been
com∣muted for, either in land or money.</P>
<P>From a paper communicated to us, we can speak with precision
upon the nature of the covenants that are here entered into by landlord and
tenant.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="126"/> The tenant covenants to keep all the
buildings and fences in repair; to pay all par∣liamentary and parish taxes; not
to plough up grass land without consent of the landlord; not to take more than
3 crops of corn before a fallow; to lay 12 cart loads of dung upon every acre
so fallowed; not to sell any hay, straw, or other fodder from off the premises,
but eat and consume the same thereupon; to spread all the manure arising from
the premises upon some part thereof, and leave the last year's manure
thereupon. The landlord covenants to allow the tenant, on quitting his farm,
which is by the custom of the country at Candlemas, what two indifferent
persons shall deem reasonable for what is generally called full tillage, and
half tillage, being for the rent and assessments of his fallow ground, the
ploughing and managing the same; the lime, manure, or other tillage laid
thereon; the seed sown thereupon, the sowing and harrowing thereof; also for
the ploughing, harrowing, manuring, and managing any turnip fallow, which he
may leave unsown; also for any clover seed sown on the pre∣mises, and the
harrowing and rolling in of such seed; and for every other matter and thing
done and performed in a husbandry-like manner on such fallow lands, in the two
last years of the terms; also for the last year's manure left upon the
premises; and for any manure and tillage laid upon the grass land.</P>
<P>The custom of the country is now so well established for the
tenant to have all the before-mentioned allowances on quitting his farm, that
the land is at all times in a proper state of cultivation, and the in-coming
tenant always prefers paying such al∣lowances, to the entering upon a farm in
an impoverished and mismanaged state.</P>
<P>Wentworth House is situated between Rotheram and Barnsley, and
is one of the largest and most magnificent houses in the kingdom. It is
unnecessary here to give any description of it, as Mr. Young, in his Northern
Tour, has already given a very just and complete account of it. It is
surrounded by a park, which we were told con∣sisted of 1,500 acres, carrying
grass of the most exquisite quality, and upon which large droves of cattle,
sheep, and deer are fed.</P>
<P>Returning back by Rotheram, we proceeded for Parkhill, the seat
of Michael An∣gelo Taylor, Esq. M. P. We were received by Mr. Taylor with the
greatest kindness: walked over a number of the adjoining fields with him, and
received much valuable in∣formation from him, respecting the husbandry of the
neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The soil here is thin, rather wet, and upon lime-stone. Few
turnips are cultivated, and they are all sown broadcast. Mr. Taylor shewed us a
mill for breaking bones, which are in great repute in this neighbourhood, and
found to answer better upon lime-stone land than any other manure. Sixty
bushels are applied to the acre. Has very little effect the first year, but
afterwards operates for a considerable time—we think 10 or 12 years.
Prime cost at the mill 18<HI>d.</HI> per bushel, and the demand greater than
can be supplied. Road from Rotheram, till we came near Parkhill, very bad, and
all cut into deep tracts: a considerable part of it was almost impassable. Saw
some common fields of good natural quality, near a place we think called
Maltby, which were under very bad management.</P>
<P>Substance of information received from Mr. Arch. Taylor, farmer
at Letwell, near Parkhill.</P>
<P>The soil is a thin lime-stone, and the climate moderate. Farms
in general too small, which Mr. Taylor thinks is the cause they are occupied by
a number of poor, bad farmers, as they are not worth the notice of a man of any
property. Two-thirds of the <PB N="129" REF="127"/> land is kept in pasture,
which is sown with common hay-seeds, white clover, and fre∣foil, and fed with
the Leicester breed of sheep, and long horned cattle. Mr. Taylor does not think
the long horned kind good for milk, but considers them to answer best upon his
thin, wet ground. Mr. Taylor's mode of farming is to plough six years, and
graze five years. When he breaks up his swarth, applies 2½ chalders, or
80 bushels of lime to the acre, and sows turnips for the first crop, 2d.
barley, 3d. clover, or pease and beans, 4th. wheat, 5th. clean summer fallow,
6th. wheat with grass seeds. The first year of the grass it is pastured with
sheep, and manured in the following winter; next year cut for hay, from which a
good crop of seeds is got; 3d, 4th, and 5th years, it is pastured with sheep.
Mr. Taylor said it was not usual to grant leases, but thinks a farmer has no
encouragement to improve, wanting them. Lands in this neighbourhood subject
both to great and small tithes, which, Mr. Taylor says, damps every spirit of
improvement. Mr. Taylor uses a great deal of bone dust, 50 bushels of which,
mixed with some short manure, is sufficient for an acre. Although it is a very
expensive dressing, yet as it is very durable, he considers himself well paid
for the ap∣plication. Does not much practise paring and burning, as he
considers it to impove∣rish the soil. The land is all inclosed, and has been so
for near one hundred years. Size of inclosures from 5 to 20 acres. Cannot say
whether inclosing has decreased po∣pulation or not, being so long since it took
place.</P>
<P>From Parkhill to Bautry the road is good. Passed by Sandbeck,
the seat of the Earl of Scarborough, and found the name of the place
corresponded with the nature of the soil.</P>
<P>Information at Bautry.</P>
<P>Soil generally of a sandy nature, well adapted for turnips,
carrots, and other drilled crops. The land is mostly in tillage, and occupied
by small farmers and tradesmen. Mr. Fisher informed us, he sows red and white
clover, and rye-grass; but that the greatest part of the pastures are sown with
hay-seeds, the people having an antipathy to rye-grass. Rotation of crops here,
are turnips, barley, clover, and rye, which an∣swers well upon soft, sandy
soil. Manures are dung and bone dust. The fallows are limed with two chalders,
or sixty-four bushels to the acre. Ploughs wrought with two horses abreast. Mr.
Drummond here works oxen. Saw one drawing his water-cart, and working quite
calm and docile. The carriages generally used, are upon six-inch wheels, and
drawn with three or four horses. Lands all inclosed, which sets for double
rent; but the inclosures by far too small. The land here does not stand much in
need of draining, but where it is wanted, the drains are filled with brick.
Paring and burning practised upon new taken in land. Expence, when done by the
plough, 5<HI>s.</HI> per acre, 13<HI>s.</HI> when done by the hand, and
2<HI>s.</HI> for spreading. Few leases granted. Mr. Fisher informed us he took
a farm, and, upon the faith of its not being raised, made consider∣able
improvements; but as soon as these improvements were discerned, the rent was
raised immediately—therefore Mr. Fisher thinks the want of leases must
always be a bar in the way of improvements. The tithes are commuted at about
8<HI>s.</HI> per acre. The great tithes belong to the Duke of Norfolk, and the
small ones to the clergy. There was lately a society at Bautry for improving
Agriculture, which did much good, but it has been given up for two years
past.</P>
<P>Waited upon Mr. Drummond here, who is a complete
gentleman-farmer, and has all his operations carried on in the most perfect and
accurate style. His fold yard is <PB N="130" REF="128"/> nicely constructed, and
his offices are numerous and convenient. The fold yard is paved, and having a
gentle slope to the middle, where there is a reservoir, with a pump fixed, into
which all the moisture produced from the dung is accumulated, and drove out in
a barrel daily to his pasture fields. Care is at same time taken to keep every
drop of water that falls upon the houses from going to the dunghill, as spouts
for car∣rying off the rain are placed round the whole fold. Mr. Drummond's
attention to his manure cannot be too much commended, as in many places not the
least care is paid to collecting it properly. In short, we venture to recommend
Mr. Drummond as a most perfect pattern to every gentleman-farmer; although we
have our doubts whether the expensive nature of his buildings are not too much,
for being followed in the common routine of husbandry operations.</P>
<P>From Bautry to Doncaster, the land is of a light, sandy nature,
upon a wet springy bottom. A great part of it has been lately inclosed, and the
fences in general not thriving. Turnips very bad, and little care taken to have
the land laid dry, as we observed much water standing on the fields.</P>
<P>Doncaster is a neat, clean town, and there is a deal of fine
land in the neighbour∣hood of it.</P>
<P>Information received at Doncaster from Mr. Parkinson, and Mr.
Foster.</P>
<P>There is a great variety of soils in this neighbourhood. A good
deal of a sandy na∣ture. Part of it a white clay; and others black earth, or a
fine, sharp, light loam. The climate is mild and dry, and both seed-time and
harvest are early. The farms are generally small, and mostly kept in tillage.
The pastures have usually been sown with natural hay-seeds, but artificial
grasses fast coming into practice. Few horses or cattle are bred, and the
improvement of sheep but just beginning to be attended to. The rotation of
crops upon the light land, is turnips, barley, clover, and wheat; and often a
crop of oats taken after the wheat, because there are no leases. Upon the clay
land, a clean summer fallow, barley, clover, and wheat, and often wheat taken
as the first crop in place of barley. Manures used, are stable dung, lime,
street dung, bone dust, rape dust, and pigeon dung—about 40 bushels of
the last laid upon an acre. Lime applied to the fallow, from 60 to 100 bushels
per acre—costs three-pence per bushel. No oxen are used; but this
supposed to be owing to the smallness of the farms. Land mostly inclosed, which
has produced great advantages. Inclosures from two to thirty acres, but chiefly
small. There is a very large common field near Don∣caster, of the finest land
in England, which is at present let at 31 <HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> per acre,
that Mr. Foster thinks would be worth £3. 10 <HI>s.</HI> if divided and
inclosed. More than twenty freeholders concerned about it. Their common
rotation is, fallow, barley, wheat, and rye, and grass-seeds are sown at
different times with all the grains. Another common field is managed
differently; the rotation is greatly superior, being turnips, barley, clover,
and wheat—the turnips all broadcast, and the most part of them this
season are bitter bad. Upon a third common field, another rotation is adopted,
viz. fallow, one half of which is sown with wheat, and the other with barley;
then beans and clo∣ver; lastly, wheat; and there is a meadow field, which,
after being cut for hay, is pastured in common, from the 10th September to the
25th March—above 1200 acres are under the above mode of management. The
proprietors are Sir Geo. Cooke, who possesses about one-half; Mr. Wrightson,
who has one-eighth; and a number of small <PB N="131" REF="129"/> freeholders.
Very few leases are granted, which both Mr. Parkinson and Mr. Forster think
detrimental even to the interest of the proprietor himself, as land in that
case would set higher. No manufactory here, except one for coarse sacking; but
where they do prevail, they are thought to have good effects in encouraging
agriculture. Great im∣provements may be made upon the stock and land in this
neighbourhood. Mr. Par∣kinson is of opinion, the horse for the team might be
improved by the Derbyshire breed, and that the cattle might be improved, by
crossing the Durham cows with the best of the Craven bulls.</P>
<P>With regard to sheep—The Bakewell sort esteemed best for
all the sandy and lime∣stone pastures, and a cross of the large Tees ewes with
the Bakewell ram for the strong clay soils. Mr. Parkinson thinks the grass land
is not sown down properly, being hitherto sown with nasty rubbish, called
hay-seeds, whereas he is of opinion, it should be done with white clover,
trefoil, and rye-grass; and where intended for cut∣ting, with red clover and a
small quantity of rye grass. Thinks also that turnips should be drilled, by
which method the land is kept much cleaner, and hoed at far less expence than
when broadcast.</P>
<P>Waited upon William Childers, Esq. at Cantley Lodge, and
examined his improve∣ments. The farm in Mr. Childers' own possession, which is
tithe-free, consists of 320 acres, and by fallowing with turnips, and laying
down with plenty of grass seeds, he has made uncommon and substantial
improvements. Mr. Childers brings manure from Doncaster, and uses great
quantities of lime. He has also a marley clay in his own lands, which he
applies to the dry, gravelly, and sandy soils, at the rate of 80 and 100 cart
loads to the acre, which produces good effects.</P>
<P>From Doncaster eastward to Thorn, the land is capable of greater
improvement than any we have seen in Yorkshire. There is a great deal of common
field, superior in quality to most land, and there is also large tracts of
waste. At Hatfield there are very large common fields, the rotation upon which
is turnips, barley, clover, wheat, and barley; and one of the fields not
ploughed, but kept in meadow grass. We examined the turnip field, which
consisted, as we were told, of 150 acres, and although of a soil ex∣ceedingly
proper for that root, they were a crop not worth 20 <HI>s.</HI> per acre. We
heard afterwards they were only valued at 15 <HI>s.</HI> The turnips were quite
small—few bigger than an egg, and the ground in the most wretched and
dirty condition. It appeared to us they had not been hoed at all, or at least
very imperfectly, a large proportion was covered with weeds; and worse culture
cannot be figured.</P>
<P>If the cultivation was bad, the manner of consuming them was
still worse. The whole 150 acres were eating at once, and the stock appeared to
be cattle and sheep of all ages and descriptions; such management needs no
comment, it speaks for itself.</P>
<P>Betwixt Hatfield and Thorn, there are great quantities of waste
land, and much under water. Upon the whole, the land we have seen this day
stands in the greatest need of improvement, which cannot be done without a
previous division. The common fields to the eastward of Doncaster are
abominably crooked and unequal. Some parts of the ridges being twice the
breadth of another, and one solitary ridge of wheat often standing by
itself—more wretched husbandry could not have existed a century ago.</P>
<P>We received the following information at Thorn.—The
proprietors are chiefly small copyholders, holding of Lady Irwin. Farms mostly
small, and the greater part kept in <PB N="132" REF="130"/> tillage. The pasture
generally employed in supporting farm stock, and a few cattle for the butcher.
The soil is chiefly clay, and the climate moderate, but foggy and damp:
Rotation upon the farm land is turnips, barley, clover, wheat, and barley; but
in the common fields, every man sows what he thinks best. Some rape is sown,
which is ge∣nerally allowed to stand for seed. The common fields here set at 30
<HI>s.</HI> per acre, besides public burdens; but from the goodness of the
land, thought to be able to pay more, if they were divided and inclosed. A
great deal of waste land in the three parishes of Thorn, Hatfield, and
Fishlock, amounting at least to 4000 acres, which is all capable of great
improvement. Wages high—ploughmen £ 15. and victuals; labourers
1<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> and 2<HI>s.</HI> and no scarcity of hands. The tithes
are either drawn in kind, or valued an∣nually—7<HI>s.</HI> per acre is
usually paid for corn fields, and a small modus taken for grass, hay, and
turnip.</P>
<P>Left Thorn and proceeded northward to Snaith—most parts of
the land till we came within two miles of that place, are exceeding wet, and
large tracts little better than in a state of nature. The land, though wet and
marshy, is generally rich strong soil.—Ridges much straighter ploughed
than is generally the case over the West Riding, but kept by far too narrow and
flat. Crossed the river Don upon a wooden bridge, a part of which turns upon a
pivot, (and gives a passage for the nu∣merous shipping that navigate this
river). As we approached Snaith the soil turn∣ed as fine as could be
wished.—Great quantities of turnips, and those of good quality.</P>
<P>Snaith is a small market town situated upon the river Aire, not
far from its con∣junction with the Don. The land round the place is of
exceeding rich quality, and but moderately rented. We examined a farm occupied
by Mr. John Latham, and found it exceedingly well cultivated. Mr. Latham upon
his light lands practises a ro∣tation that has already been often mentioned,
viz. turnips, barley, clover, and wheat; but he follows out this rotation in a
manner superior to most persons. His turnip crop this year, when so many other
people's have failed, is good, and are set to a job∣ber from Leeds at £6.
per acre, to be eat upon the ground. His turnips although not drilled, are all
in rows, about sixteen inches wide, which enables him to hoe them with greater
accuracy.—His method to do this, is to give the last furrow very broad,
which takes all the seed when harrowed into the furrow, and so gives the field
an appearance of regularity. Mr. Latham said this plan was fallen on by
accident, which indeed is often the parent of many improvements;—when
ploughing one of his fields some years ago, he ordered his servants to finish
it that night. There being a feast in the neighbourhood, the ploughmen were
anxious to be early at it, and so gave a furrow much broader than usual. When
the young plants came up, Mr. Latham was surprised to see them in regular
lines, and inquired into the cause of it; which pleased him so well, that he
has since continued the practice.</P>
<P>Mr. Latham sows rape upon his wheat stubbles, that are next year
to be turnips. His method is to plough the field as soon as the wheat is
carried off, and sow the rape immediately, which is generally got down by the
middle of September, and af∣fords him feeding for his sheep in spring equal in
value to 20<HI>s.</HI> per acre.</P>
<P>A part of Mr. Latham's farm is what is called warp-land, or land
enriched with the sediment left by the river Aire, when its banks are
overflown. Upon such fields he does not venture to sow wheat, as it stands in
danger of being perished; but from the richness of the soil great crops of
spring corn are raised.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="131"/> Mr. Latham is a most able and complete
farmer; his fences are all good; the whole of his land clean; his pastures rich
and luxuriant. We are happy to have this opportunity of expressing the high
sense we entertain of his merit and abilities:</P>
<P>From Snaith to Ferrybridge there are a number of common fields,
which were under no better management than those we have formerly described. We
saw a large common field of turnips to the eastward of Kellington, which were
middling good, but very imperfectly cleaned. At least 40 acres were stocked off
at once, and cows, bullocks, young cattle, and sheep were feeding
indiscriminately. Saw also upon this road some fields of rape intended for
seed, which looked well.</P>
<P>Waited upon Richard Slater Milnes, Esq. M. P. for York, at his
house at Fryston. From his information, and that of others, the following
account of the husbandry in the neighbourhood of Ferrybridge is given.</P>
<P>The soil is composed of lime-stone, clay, sand, &amp;c. in the
vallies, and rich pasture, and meadow lands near the rivers. The land is
chiefly possessed by large proprie∣tors; such as Lord Mexborough, Mr. Mills,
Mr. Crow, &amp;c. Farms contain from 50 to 300 acres, and mostly kept in
tillage. Large quantities of red clover and sainfoin are sown for cutting,
which answer well; and white clover, trefoil, and hay∣seeds are sown for
pasture. Some lucern is sown, but the quantity inconsiderable; many horses are
kept on account of the collieries, lime works, drawing vessels along the river
Aire, and other purposes besides that of husbandry; which consume the red
clover and sainfoin. The pasture inclosures are generally stocked with sheep;
and the lands near the water side are eaten by milk cows.</P>
<P>Rotation of crops upon the clay land is, wheat, or barley upon
the fallow, and afterwards oats, or beans. No more than two crops are taken to
a fallow, unless the land is of superior quality. Turnips are sown upon the
tithe land, and followed with barley, clover, and wheat. The manures used are,
stable dung, pigeon dung, and sometimes bone dust. A great quantity of
lime-stone is burned at Knallingley and Brotherton, which is laid on, from two
or three chalders per acre. Ploughs are of the usual kind kept in the country,
and generally drawn by two horses abreast. Carts with wheels of 3, 6, and 9
inches broad, and drawn by three, and by four horses in a line are used. Very
few oxen are wrought, and those only by gentlemen. Land mostly inclosed, but
the inclosures thought too small. Inclosing is reckoned to pro∣duce the
following advantages. It enables the possessor to cultivate the land in a
superior style, which in its open state, it was out of his power to do. From
such cultivation a greater produce is obtained; and on the light soils the
turnip, clover, and seed husbandry cannot otherwise be practised to advantage.
Provisions are cheaper here than in the manufacturing part of the country, at
least one halfpenny per pound. Roads, both turnpike and by ones, are in good
condition. Sometimes the assessment for supporting them is 18<HI>d.</HI> per
pound upon the valued rent. Much improvement has been made by draining, and
great attention paid to it. The farm houses and offices are in general very
inconveniently situated, most of them are in vil∣lages, which of course renders
a number of them at a great distance from the land. Some leases are granted;
but it is not the general practice to give them for more than one year. No
modes of husbandry prevail here that would be of advantage to other places,
except sowing sainfoin, which answers well upon all chalky, or lime∣stone land.
Some bills have passed for dividing common lands, which have produced great
advantages. Plentiful crops have been raised at little expence, and an
oppor∣tunity <PB N="134" REF="132"/> given of laying down the old going land
into grass; also an exemption from tithes is procured by them.</P>
<P>We proceeded to Selby. This is a populous market town, situated
upon the river Ouse, and was the birth place of King Henry I. on which account
his father Wil∣liam the Conqueror built an abbey here. From John Foster, Esq.
we received the following important intelligence relative to the agriculture of
this part of the country.</P>
<P>The soil is various, part of it sandy, and part a hazle clay.
The climate is mode∣rate; the proprietors are Lord Petre, the Archbishop of
York, and a great many copyholders. Farms are small, and kept in equal
proportions of pasture and tillage. All sorts of grasses are cultivated; which
are used both in breeding and feeding. Sheep are generally of the
Northumberland kind, and the cattle of the short horned or Holderness breed.
Great numbers of horses are bred. The rent of the land is from 5<HI>s.</HI> to
50<HI>s.</HI> per acre. Rotation of crops; when land is broke up from grass,
flax is generally the first crop, then rape, afterwards wheat, and a fallow;
but no fixed rotation is kept. Ploughs of the common kind, drawn by two horses
are used; but a number of oxen are wrought in the waggons. There are no common
fields in this parish, but many in the neighbourhood. The difference of value
betwixt open and inclosed lands, is estimated at one-third, or 33 per cent.
Here is a considerable deal of waste ground, which produces little or nothing
at present, but is capable of great improvement. Strict attention is necessary
in keeping the ditches clean, and letting the water off the fields, which are
greatly hurt by rain water stagnating upon them; but as there are no spouts,
little other draining is required. Provisions are plenty and moderate; roads
tolerable, great improvements have lately been made upon them. Farm houses and
offices are well enough constructed, but very improperly si∣tuated, as they are
mostly in villages. A number of landlords do not grant leases, which is
destructive to good farming.</P>
<P>Mr. Foster informed us that woad for dyers is raised in the
neighbourhood of Selby, among red clover. When it is in full bloom, it is
pulled by women and boys, who go before the mowers. It is placed in small heaps
with the tops uppermost, and when completely dried, is put into the barn, and
sold to the dyers from 15<HI>d.</HI> to 3<HI>s.</HI> per stone. Woad grows well
on all lands fit for turnips, and is sometimes taken by itself as a crop.</P>
<P>Large quantities of potatoes are raised here. They are all of
the kidney kind, and no less than seven or eight thousand tons are annually
exported from the banks of the Ouse, for the London market.</P>
<P>A great deal of flax is grown near Selby, which is almost all
cleaned and dressed in the country; a small proportion is allowed to stand for
seed.</P>
<P>We received the following information from Mr. James Foster,
Farmer at Wiston.</P>
<P>The soil is very indifferent; there is warp, occasioned by the
sediment left by the overflowing of the river Ouse; there is loam, or a mixture
of clay and sand, but not very deep, and also some clay and sandy soils. There
are both large and small pro∣prietors, and none of the farms are large. Land is
employed both in pasture and tillage, generally in equal proportions. There is
not much rye-grass sown, hay-seeds being more esteemed. Sheep are both bred and
fed on the pastures, fleece weighs from 5. to 8lb. avoirdupois, and sold to the
manufacturers in the western parts of the Riding, at 7<HI>d.</HI> and
8<HI>d.</HI> per pound.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="133"/> The rotation of crops is, fallow, wheat,
beans, and oats; or turnips, barley, grass seeds, and oats, as suits the soil.
Some rape is sown; the land, after being fallowed and dunged, is sown about the
first of September, with half a peck or three quarterns of seed per acre; the
produce is from four to five quarters, and sold from 45<HI>s.</HI> to
60<HI>s.</HI> per quarter. Mr. Foster sows a considerable quantity of flax; the
produce per acre, is from 24 to 40 stone of 14lb. avoirdupois of rough dressed
flax, and sold from 7<HI>s.</HI> to 10<HI>s.</HI> per stone. Little or no seed
is preserved. The flax is all scutched by the hand, there being no mills for
that purpose in this part of the country. Dung is brought by water from Hull;
prime cost and expence, is nearly £ 6. per acre. Lime is used in large
quantities, 140 bushels being applied to the acre, expence £ 50.</P>
<P>There are no common fields. He thinks, on the general question,
that inclosing renders land of one-third more value. Wages run from
16<HI>d.</HI> to 2<HI>s.</HI> per day—no drink∣ings allowed, excepting in
harvest. Wheat is cut with the sickle, at the rate of 7<HI>s.</HI> per acre;
but he is of opinion, it would be a great advantage and profit to cut it much
lower than is usually done, supposing the expence should be more. Barley and
oats are cut with the scythe—expence of cutting, binding, &amp;c.
5<HI>s.</HI> per acre. There are few covered drains, there being no springs;
but great occasion for ditching and griping to carry off the top water. Few
leases are granted; and Mr. Foster thinks, in the gene∣ral, that these are
absolutely necessary, where improvements are carried on. He is of opinion, he
would be able to give more rent for his farm, if he was not under
restric∣tions, and that no restrictions ought to exist in a lease, but for the
three last years.</P>
<P>The people have a great turn for improvements; and he knows of
no other ob∣stacles, but the above two, and the mode by which tithes are at
present paid. No in∣closing bills have lately passed for land in this
neighbourhood; but, from the advan∣tages he has seen take place in consequence
of such bills, he is of opinion, that all the waste land in the kingdom ought
to be divided immediately.</P>
<P>We proceeded for Tadcaster. Great part of the country is upon a
lime-stone, and lies very well: but the ridges in general are too flat, and no
attention paid to letting off the water. We saw several common fields. After
passing Sherborn (at which place great quantities of the Winesower plum grows),
the country appeared very thinly inhabited; few or no houses being to be seen,
till we arrived in the immediate neighbourhood of Tadcaster.</P>
<P>At Tadcaster we were recommended to a Mr. Potter, as one of the
best farmers in that place; and we found that his practice was accurate and
correct, in the highest degree. We received the following information from
him.</P>
<P>The soil is a dry lime-stone; the climate kindly and moderate.
The proprietors mostly have large estates; but the farms are small, few
extending to 300 acres. The greatest part of the land is in tillage, not above
one-third being in pasture. The grasses sown, are red and white clover,
trefoil, and sainfoin. Rye-grass is out of re∣pute, and hay-seeds fast
following. Sheep are kept upon the pasture land, and cattle fed upon turnips.
No land is floated or watered. General rotation of crops is, tur∣nips, barley,
clover, and wheat; often a crop of oats taken after the wheat. The manures
used, are dung, made upon the farm, and gathered at Tadcaster; some lime
brought by water from Hull, and horn shavings from York. The ploughs are of the
Dutch kind, and drawn by two horses abreast. No oxen used, but those kept by
Lord Hawke. The sowing of wheat commences about the end of September, and 
<PB N="136" REF="134"/> continues all the month of October. Spring crops are
sown as early as possible. The harvest is early. Here are some common fields;
and Mr. Potter supposes, the dif∣ference of value betwixt open and inclosed
land to be one-fourth. Inclosures are small, few exceeding ten acres. There is
a good deal of waste land, some of which is under division, and capable of
great improvement. The wages of a labouring man is 9<HI>s.</HI> per week;
ploughmen get £ 10 per year, besides victuals and washing; the head man
gets equal to £ 30 per year. Hours of labour are 10 in summer, and 7 in
winter. Paring and burning are very seldom practised. A great quantity of the
Winesower plum grows in this neighbourhood. Farm-houses and offices might often
be more conveniently situated. Mr. Potter thinks it would be highly beneficial
to the public interest, that all land was set under lease; and further thinks,
there is no necessity for imposing restrictions on the good farmer, as he will
manage much better wanting them; and as for the bad farmer, he cannot be mended
by them. The people here have a great turn for improving their lands; but have
no opportunity of doing this to purpose, from the want of leases. He thinks the
small size of the farms serves to retard good management.</P>
<P>We received also information from another gentleman, about the
husbandry in the neighbourhood of Tadcaster; but as he only corroborates what
Mr. Potter has al∣ready said, it is unnecessary to repeat it.</P>
<P>Waited upon Mr. Beck, steward to Lord Hawke, upon his estate of
Scarthingwell and T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wton.—His
lordship has taken about 1,600 acres into his own hands; and is very properly
putting it into good order, by fallowing, manuring, and laying parts of it down
with grass seeds, with a view to set it in proper sized farms to substantial
te∣nants. Besides the manure raised on this farm, his lordship has expended
yearly above three hundred pounds in purchasing manure, principally dung, from
the towns and villages in his neighbourhood, and by water from Hull, York,
&amp;c. We use the free∣dom to recommend to his lordship's attention, that the
land now in hand, will make four very complete farms; and that, after the
outlines of each are marked out, the farm∣houses and offices should be placed
as near as possible in the centre of each farm; keeping always in view the
conveniency of good water: an attention to these things is an important object
of agricultural economy: and we now understand Lord Hawke has not only always
had these ideas, but that specific spots have long since been set out, where
the buildings will at a proper time be erected.</P>
<P>We select from the information communicated by Mr. Beck, and
Lord Hawke, the following particulars.</P>
<P>The soil is of many different kinds: it is good loam in general:
there is also clay upon lime-stone; strong clay upon a blue till; hazle earth
upon sand; and about 50 acres of moss, or peat earth, upon Lord Hawke's estate.
About a fourth part is kept in pasture, though less pasture in general is kept.
He cultivates sainfoin, red clover, and trefoil, with white clover, and
hay-seeds. He bred 350 sheep last year, and has this year increased his
breeding ewes to 440: they are of the Oxford and Gloucester∣shire polled
breeds; they have a cross also of the Bakewell and Fowler breeds; and the
wethers are fed off when shearing, at 38<HI>s</HI> each. He folds his ewes
always from May∣day to Michaelmas. He feeds also a few Scotch and Irish cattle.
The general rotation of crops is turnips, barley, clover, and wheat. His plan,
now adopted, is to sow half <PB N="137" REF="135"/> his clover land with twelve
pounds of red clover per acre; to mow it once, and then feed it. The other half
is sown with 6lb. of white clover, 3 lb. of rib-grass, and 6lb. of trefoil per
acre, and fed, but not mown. By this rotation of crops, red clover is sown but
once in eight years on the same land. His plan is to lay down one hundred and
fifty acres to sainfoin, the seed of which he sows with his barley; and has
sometimes sown it on a clean fallow. When the ground laid down with sainfoin
would have been broken up for wheat had it been sown with clover, he breaks up
an old worn-out pasture ground, and sows it in the spring following with oats;
after which it is fallowed, and falls regularly into course, instead of the
ground sown down with sainfoin. The manures used, are rape dust, pigeon,
farm-yard, and bought dung, by Lord Hawke; soot, rape, bone-dust, and farm-yard
dung, by Mr. Beck. Lord Hawke ploughs with two oxen abreast, without a driver,
and sometimes with horses, but depends principally, and almost entirely on
oxen, for his ploughing and harrowing. His land in hand is all inclosed;
inclosures vary from 8 to 30 acres. There are some small pastures from 5 to 8.
We think small arable inclosures hurt∣ful in a corn country; and Lord Hawke is
altering and enlarging the size of his fields, from 15 to 20 acres. Mr. Beck is
of opinion that inclosing is very beneficial, and never can decrease
population. Lord Hawke had land in a common field, for which he got only
5<HI>s.</HI> 9<HI>d.</HI> per acre, and can let the same land, when it is now
divided and inclosed, at 20<HI>s.</HI> Wages are high; house servants cost in
board and wages £ 30 per annum. Draining is much required here; but for
want of a law to oblige neigh∣bours to clean out their contiguous ditches, it
cannot be done to advantage; although Lord Hawke is attempting it, and has
induced many to drain with him. Paring and burning are practised on old grass
land, and thought an excellent method of breaking up all coarse sward. Lord
Hawke approves of it on low grounds, but on high ground, thinks burning
unnecessary, and rather detrimental. The old farm-houses and offices are badly
constructed, and inconveniently situated, being built in villages; but Lord
Hawke has built for his own use a large farm-yard, conveniently formed and
situated, with a threshing machine, a mill for grinding rape-cake, and stabling
for twenty-five horses, and thirty-two oxen; besides cow sheds, barns for hay
and corn, &amp;c. The whole is walled in by walls nine feet high, and coped
with stone, and divided by the barns, stables, &amp;c. into four yards; two of
which have ponds, be∣sides the pumps. The stables for horses are placed on the
east and west side of the farm-yard, which is free from buildings on the south,
and sheltered on the north by the barn and ox-houses, which separate it from
the principal stack-yard. This yard is divided from the two others by open
hay-barns, tiled whith slate eaves, and with chimnies also of brick, to let out
the steam. The average of the boarded granaries, amounts in length to one
hundred and sixty feet, and in breadth to twenty-one. There are trap-doors
contrived in them, to let down the corn when sacked, into wag∣gons, which may
be loaded and locked up at the same time. The corn is stacked on wooden frames,
placed on stone pillars and caps. Lord Hawke still proposes to make further
improvements to it, and to pull down a cottage now placed at the western
ex∣tremity of it, and build a house in its place for his steward. The whole
covers from an acre to two acres of ground. Mr. Beck is of opinion, when land
is set it should be by leases of 21 years at least; and that shorter ones are
productive of bad conse∣quences to both parties, as time is wanting to improve
and reap the benefit. Mr. <PB N="138" REF="136"/> Beck thinks that restrictions
in the lease, where the tenant is a man of abilities and property, are a bar to
improvement. But for the safety of the proprietor, it is necessary that
one-third of the farm be left in grass, properly laid down after fallow or
turnip, with a sufficiency of seeds, as might be mutually agreed upon.</P>
<P>A particular species of plum grows here, and in the
neighbourhood, called the Winesower. It grows well, both upon gravel and
lime-stone, is hardy, a good bearer, and answers upon any soil; but does not
bear so well, nor its flavour so good on any, as on lime-stone or gravel. On a
strong deep land, the trees run too much to wood, and do not bear fruit in
proportion. These plums blossom better than any other sort, and are produced
from suckers. The fruit sells from 21<HI>s.</HI> per peck, when sound and good,
to 4<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> when cracked and damaged. They are very easily
hurt by rain.</P>
<P>Left Tadcaster, and took the road westward to Harewood. Observed
some com∣mon fields by the way. The land in general is upon a wet bottom; and
from the late rains, and the little attention paid to clearing out the furrows,
is in a very bad si∣tuation.</P>
<P>We delivered a letter to Mr. Samuel Poplewell, steward to Lord
Harewood, and re∣ceived satisfactory information from him. Harewood is a neat
little village. His lordship's residence is a little distance from it. He
grants no leases, but is esteemed a kind landlord.</P>
<P>The following is the substance of information received from Mr.
Poplewell.</P>
<P>The soil is generally clay, upon a bottom retentive of moisture;
the climate showery and wet. Land is chiefly possessed by large proprietors,
and occupied by tenants paying from £ 20. to £ 200. yearly rent. It
is employed both in pasture and in tillage, in proportions nearly equal. The
pastures are mostly eaten by sheep, which are purchased from Northumberland;
their fleece sells from 3<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> to 4<HI>s.</HI> Many Scotch
and Irish cattle are fed upon the sides of the river Wharfe. Upon the tillage
land two crops are generally taken to a fallow, and turnips sown upon all the
fallows proper for them. Mr. Poplewell drills his turnips, and has never missed
a crop since he practised that method. The manures used are, home made dung,
rape dust, malt coombs, and dung and soot from Leeds. Little lime is used,
except∣ing on new broken up land. Ploughs are generally drawn by three horses
in a line. No oxen are used for work, excepting a few by Lord Harewood. Some
rape is sown, which is often eaten by sheep, but sometimes stands for seed.
Here are no common fields, but there are some in the neighbourhood, which he
thinks should be divided. He estimates the difference betwixt the value of open
and inclosed land, to be at least 25 per cent. He also is of opinion, that it
would be of great service to agriculture, if all lands were set under lease;
and that if these were granted, there would be no ne∣cessity for restrictions,
unless during the concluding years. A bill passed about three years ago, to
divide a common in this neighbourhood, which has produced be∣neficial
consequences; and Mr. Poplewell is of opinion, most part of the waste land in
the Riding might be improved, by planting Scotch firs upon it.</P>
<P>We arrived at Wetherby, which is a great thoroughfare on the
London road. Here we received the following information.</P>
<P>The soils in this neighbourhood are lime-stone and strong clay.
There are a few small freeholders, but the land almost wholly belongs to the
Duke of Devonshire. <PB N="139" REF="137"/> Farms are generally small, the most
part not exceeding £ 30. per annum. Rent is about 20 <HI>s.</HI> per
acre, and the public burdens. Rotation of crops upon the lime-stone is,
turnips, barley, clover, and wheat; on the clay, fallow, wheat, and beans. The
manures used, are great quantities of rape dust, price 2 <HI>s.</HI> 4
<HI>d.</HI> per bushel; horn shav∣ings from York, soot, and all the dung that
can be collected at home. Lime is ap∣plied to the fallow, 100 bushels to the
acre; it costs 9 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d,</HI> per chalder of 32 bushels. Ploughs
are of the common kind, and drawn by two horses upon the lime-stone, and by
three and four upon the clay land. No oxen are used. Harvest is early; begins
generally about the first of August, and is all finished by the middle of
Sep∣tember. The land is all inclosed; the size of inclosures from 3 to 12
acres. Wages are high; ploughmen, that are masters of their work, get fifteen
guineas per annum, be∣sides victuals; and labourers never less than
18<HI>d.</HI> per day, and more in harvest; no scarcity of hands to reap the
crop, excepting in the year 1792. The corn is mostly cut with the sickle; wheat
is done for 7<HI>s.</HI> per acre. Provisions are plenty, but high priced.
Farm-houses and offices are improperly situated, as they are all placed at the
corner of the lordship.</P>
<P>The Duke of Devonshire formerly granted leases, but now intends
to act otherwise; which we were told would be a great bar to improvements. The
covenants that for∣merly subsisted were, to keep two-thirds in grass. Tithes
are generally commuted here, and 7 <HI>s.</HI> per acre paid in their
place.</P>
<P>In our route northward, we again visited Boroughbridge and
Knaresborough; and received additional information, relative to the husbandry
practised in their respective neighbourhoods.</P>
<P>We arrived at Rippon.—This is a place of great antiquity;
being, it is said, in∣corporated by King Alfred; and is a pleasant and well
built town. The river Ure was made navigable to this place about twenty years
ago, and a number of vessels are em∣ployed thereon, to the great convenience
and benefit of this place and neigh∣bourhood.</P>
<P>We received the following information from Mr. Peacock, at
Lendrick near this place.</P>
<P>The soil near Rippon is partly of a sandy nature, and partly
strong clay upon a lime-stone; the climate healthy, and moderate. Estates are
generally large, and farms of va∣rious sizes, from 20 to £300. yearly
rent. The lands are mostly in grass and meadows, little more than the fourth
part being kept in tillage. Artificial grasses are just begin∣ning to be
introduced into the husbandry of this neighbourhood. A few cattle of the short
horned kind are bred, and a good many long woolled sheep, which when fatted at
two years of age, will weigh 25 lb. per quarter. The rotation of crops is,
turnips, barley, clover, hay-seeds, and wheat, upon the light and sandy soils;
and on the strong soils, fallow, wheat, and beans. Lime and common dung, with a
little rape dust, are the only manures used. A large heavy plough, drawn by 4
and 6 horses, yoked in pairs, is employed upon the strong lands. Upon the light
soils, a smaller plough drawn by two horses is used. The country is mostly
inclosed. Inclosures are from 5 to 40 acres. Mr Peacock thinks, land when
inclosed is of double value, to that of similar quality, when lying in common
field. There are some thousand acres of waste or common in the neighbourhood;
most of which is capable of great improvement. Wages for labourers are at
2<HI>s.</HI> per day in summer, and from 1<HI>s.</HI> to 1<HI>s.</HI>
4<HI>d.</HI> in winter. Little of the country requires draining; but where this
improvement is necessary, it <PB N="140" REF="138"/> is well attended to, plenty
of materials for this purpose being at hand. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> price of butcher meat is
3½<HI>d.</HI> per pound.</P>
<P>Farm-houses and offices lately erected, are in general good, and
conveniently si∣tuated; but those that have stood long are not so. Mr. Peacock
thinks, that the principal obstacles to improvements are, the want of leases of
a proper duration, and the restrictions from ploughing up the old grass fields,
which effectually prevents any new systems of husbandry from being
introduced.</P>
