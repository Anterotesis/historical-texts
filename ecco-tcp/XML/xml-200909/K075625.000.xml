<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> believe you are a gentleman, <HI>who is not unwilling that his actions should be faithful∣ly transmitted to posterity;</HI> and as nobody can have a more sensible regard for your great virtues and abilities than my self, I beg leave to make the world acquaint∣ed with them in the following dedication.</P>
<P>YOU came into the world, sir, under the influence of a lucky planet, being born of an ancient and worthy family, to a plentiful fortune, as well as great natural endowments and hereditary virtues; all which you have since im∣proved by a liberal education, under the care of one of the ablest pillars of our church, and (as his ingenious friend Mr. MIST emphatically stiles him) the <HI>brightest ornament of the brightest body in the world;</HI> by his pre∣cepts and example you have finished in your self one of the finest gentlemen and greatest scholars of our age.</P>
<Q><L>Transplanting, one by one, into your life</L>
<L>His bright perfections, till you shine like him.</L></Q>
<P>IT is impossible that one thus richly endowed by na∣ture and improved by art, should not make a very extra∣ordinary figure. You discovered the earliest marks of a great genius, and at an age when we say of others that they are promising youths, you were arrived at the high∣est
<PB REF="3"/>
perfection and maturity of manhood. You brought with you from school a thorough knowledge of the classical writers and the learned languages, so that you had no∣thing to interrupt your stricter academical studies; by which means and a close application, you soon became a deep logician, a profound philosopher, and an excellent mathematician. In short, you grew a compleat master of most arts and sciences (particularly necromancy and metaphysicks) and no part of learning has entirely escap∣ed your knowledge.</P>
<P>NOR have you cultivated your <HI>Head</HI> only, (which in this age is the least part of a liberal character) but e∣ven your <HI>heels,</HI> sir, discover the marks of an academi∣cal education; that pretty flutter in your gait, that care∣less swing of your arms, and that polite turn of your head may, to some people, seem only to be the natural effect of well proportion'd limbs and a regular body; but, to a nice observer, every motion will appear <HI>syllogisti∣cal,</HI> and strictly conformable to <HI>Mode</HI> and <HI>Figure:</HI> How often have I seen you come into a room in <HI>Barbara</HI> and salute the company in <HI>Darii?</HI> how often do you pay your devotions in <HI>Ferio,</HI> and dance in <HI>Baralipton?</HI> as this is an art perhaps peculiar to yourself and the author of <HI>Mathe∣matical rules for Dancing,</HI> it is no wonder that you have gain'd the character of the politest gentleman in the u∣niversity and triumph'd over all your rivals in the affec∣tions of the ladies.</P>
<P>BUT I must not dwell too long upon one of your most trifling qualifications, considering how many there are still behind, and how narrow a compass my bookseller has prescribed me to celebrate them in.</P>
<P>GIVE me leave therefore, learned sir, in a cursory man∣ner to mention your humanity, candour, and publick spirit; your acute wit, unbyass'd judgment, and penetrat∣ing understanding; your nice sence of honour, magnani∣mity, and intrepid courage; your chastity, sobriety, and unspotted virtue; but above all, your unshaken loyalty
<PB REF="4"/>
(in the true sence of the word) your invincible orthodoxy and strict adherence to the catholick church.</P>
<P>YOUR intimate acquaintance with the <HI>modern Langu∣ages</HI> and your profound skill in <HI>modern History</HI> are so well known, that it would be matter of great astonish∣ment to me, how you could escape being nominated to a certain Prof—ip lately established, if I did not con∣sider how some people — I can hardly keep it in, not∣withstanding all their <HI>pains</HI> and <HI>penalties;</HI> but we were pretty even with them at last; and I am sure it is no disappointment to you, who choose to do good and pro∣pagate knowledge, <HI>without any Reward.</HI></P>
<P>WITH all these shining accomplishments (however you may be despised elsewhere) you could not fail of acquir∣ing a very popular reputation in the famous university of OXFORD, which, amidst the general depravity of man∣kind, and the lamentable increase of fanaticism both in church and state, has maintained its antient purity in the worst of times, even (as our ingenious professor of poetry once observed) <HI>whilst armed Forces were within our Walls.</HI> Accordingly you have proceeded in the re∣gular method prescribed by our statutes (too slow indeed for your aspiring merit) to the highest degree which our university can confer, and whenever you shall please to oblige the world with any of those valuable manuscripts which enrich your cabinet, you may dignify the title page with <HI>Fellow of a College and Doctor of civil Law.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING said thus much (which is much too lit∣tle) of you, my present most honoured Patron; give me leave, Sir, (with the imputation of as little va∣nity as possible) to say something of my self and my following performance.</P>
<P>YOU must know, Sir, that I have been several years a matriculated son of this antient university; and though, for want of the same natural talents, and the same application, I have not done the good old lady half the honour which you have done, nor re∣ceived
<PB REF="5"/>
half so many honours from her hands; yet I shall never forget the obligations which I lie under to her, for that small portion of learning which I pos∣sess, and that little figure which I make in the world. A due sense of these obligations join'd with a violent indignation to see her traduced and vilified by some persons, who ought to know and practice bet∣ter, has occasioned the following sheets; in which I have endeavoured to perpetuate her name, and to raise up a column of my own gratitude, that it may not be said of me in future ages (as I fear it will be of too many) that I would not <HI>look to the rock from whence I was hewn, nor to the pit from whence I was digged.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot, in this place, forbear assuring you, that when I first resolved upon this undertaking, you jump'd immediately into my head, as the fittest person to pa∣tronize it; and I have not been able, with all my deli∣beration, to alter my opinion ever since: so that, you see, it was by a sort of inspiration that I desire your protection of this Work.</P>
<P>I know the conclusion of my <HI>POEM,</HI> where I presage my own future glory, will be particulary cavil'd at, and I shall be call'd a vain conceited coxcomb for my pains; but in answer to this, without insisting on the examples of <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Ovid</HI> in the same case, I say that it is an intolerable grievance upon modern authors to be restrained from commending their own works. No body expects that the good wives of <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣lingsgate</HI> should cry stinking fish, or that any vintner in town should tell you that his wine is sour: nay, e∣very surly rascal of a shoemaker shall take the liberty to look you saucily in the face, when he puts you to execrable torture with a pair of new shoes, and swear that they sit as easy as your mistress's gloves; whereas it is expected of an author that he should cry down his own ware, and though he publishes a better poem
<PB REF="6"/>
than ever <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI> did, should make a thou∣sand excuses for troubling the world with such indiffer∣ent stuff, as he is obliged to call it, to the manifest hinderance of his market, and against the fullest con∣viction of his own mind. I think therefore every ma∣nufacturer of the brain ought to rise up against this growing evil, and assert the same right, with all other tradesmen and artificers, to warrant his goods, and thereby promote the sale of them as much as he can.</P>
<P>FOR my part (though I do not think my self vain∣er than other men) I will venture to affirm (in defi∣ance of all the criticks and ignorant carping rascals in <HI>England</HI>) that the following poem is a perfect finish'd peice, according to the strictest rules of <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Longinus,</HI> whom (I will be again bold to say) no body has studied more, or understands better than my self; I maintain, that the model is just and regular, the diction truely sublime, and the panegyrick well hit off: if it be ob∣jected, that I have now and then introduced little sar∣casms and strokes of satire, I have <HI>Virgil, Horace,</HI> and all the best authors, both antient and modern, to justi∣fy me in such occasional deviations.</P>
<P>I have also their authority (as I could easily prove from a multitude of instances) to apologize for the many <HI>beautiful similes</HI> and <HI>useful digressions,</HI> with which I have thought fit to illustrate and diversify the whole: they are all on my side, and so I have no apprehensions from them; but I am terribly afraid of a certain merry gentleman in this town, who frequently says, that <HI>there is nothing in the world so</HI> unlike <HI>as similes:</HI> he might with the same reason add, and I hope he will do it, <HI>that nothing is so pertinent as digressions;</HI> this will make us some amends, and give us with one hand, what he takes away with the other.</P>
<P>As for my self I have laboured to make my <HI>similes</HI> as <HI>like,</HI> and my <HI>digressions</HI> as <HI>pertinent</HI> as possibly I could; I am sure it has cost me a great deal of pains
<PB REF="7"/>
(as, I doubt not, it has most authors) to bring them in and make them look pat to the purpose; nay, I could not with all my pains, lug in some, which I was not a little fond of, and particularly the following distich.</P>
<Q><L>So barren <HI>chalk,</HI> which no production yields,</L>
<L>Burnt into <HI>lime,</HI> manures the neighbouring fields.</L></Q>
<P>YOU must allow, sir, that this is a very pretty simile, and if it could but be handsomely applied, would make a good figure in my poem; but after the strictest examination, I could not hedge it in any where in the following pages, and being loth that so uncom∣mon a thought should be lost, I have inserted it in this place, making it my request, that if you, or any of my candid readers can think of any method to in∣troduce it properly into the body of my work, you will oblige me with the hint, and the favour shall be grate∣fully acknowledged in the second edition.</P>
<P>I had also a mind to foist in a digression against the late bills for <HI>inspecting drugs, medicines, &amp;c.</HI> and for <HI>ex∣cising</HI> of <HI>tea, coffee,</HI> and <HI>chocolate;</HI> but not being able to discover any relation which they have to the univer∣sity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> I was obliged to reserve it for a more proper occasion.</P>
<P>SIR, I was going on to acquaint you with some more of my projects; but my bookseller is just come in, and tells me, that I must break off immediately, and that he cannot afford a line more for a shilling, which is the price we have agreed to fix upon this summer-piece of entertain∣ment for gentlemen and ladies: what therefore I have farther to say to you, upon this and all other occasions, must be defer'd till another opportunity, which, you may depend upon, shall not be neglected by</P>

<L>Make a <HI>Welsh</HI> pedigree harmonious chime,</L>
<L>Or put the <HI>Russian</HI> army into rhime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>UNHAPPY bards! but others may be found,</L>
<L>Whose gentle names in verse melodious sound,</L>
<L>BACON in easy numbers glides along,</L>
<L>And TRAP and WHARTON melt upon the tongue,</L>
<L>Egregious wits! and criticks both sublime,</L>
<L>Whose kindred talents so exactly chime,</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="55"/>That hard it is to say, in verse or prose</L>
<L>Which happy genius more divinely flows;</L>
<L>In this alone the former does excel,</L>
<L>That TRAP writes most, but WHARTON writes as well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT above all, record the female race,</L>
<L>The reigning Toasts and beauties of the place,</L>
<L>Whether in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The</HI> Drury-Lane <HI>of</HI> Oxford.</NOTE> <HI>Bullock's-lane</HI> they chuse to rove,</L>

<L>IN love too often interest sways the mind</L>
<L>And sordid riches our affections blind,</L>
<L>Some squeamish fops, fantastically nice,</L>
<L>For virtue sigh and puke at modish vice;</L>
<L>Others for titles languish and would scorn</L>
<L>Ev'n beauty's goddess, if obscurely born.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BY no such borrow'd charms, nor spurious arts,</L>
<L>Our <HI>Oxford</HI> ladies reign o'er youthful hearts;</L>
<L>In their own native, naked charms they shine,</L>
<L>Smug chamber-maids and sempstresses divine,</L>
<L>Smart laundresses on <HI>Saturdays</HI> so clean,</L>
<L>And bed-makers on every day between,</L>
<L>The beggar's off-spring to the parish left,</L>
<L>And college bastards of their sires bereft,</L>
<L>Nymphs without smocks our tender hearts sur∣prize,</L>
<L>And deities in rags attract our eyes.</L>

<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
<L>UNHAPPY COBURNE! lately laid in dust,</L>
<L>How to thy ashes shall the muse be just?</L>
<L>For to what member of APOLLO'S race</L>
<L>Did ever she deny the soft embrace?</L>
<L>What slighted lover or despairing swain</L>
<L>Can of her wrongs or cruelty complain?</L>
<L>No jilting tricks nor coying arts she knew,</L>
<L>But to the amorous kind was ever true,</L>
<L>To every sighing youth resign'd her charms,</L>
<L>And bless'd, at easy rates, his longing arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MOURN, all ye sons of learning, SABY'S fate,</L>
<L>In verse and prose the mighty loss relate:</L>
<L>With tropes and figures,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our most ingenious professor of <HI>Oratory.</HI></NOTE> COTES, embalm her name,</L>
<L><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Our inimitable professor of <HI>Poetry.</HI></NOTE> WHARTON, in grateful metre chaunt her fame,</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="58"/>Let each surviving Toast her garland bring,</L>
<L>And lavish o'er her grave the flowery spring;</L>
<L>In streams of blood let conscious <HI>Isis</HI> flow,</L>
<L>Let <HI>Charwell</HI> swell the sympathetick woe,</L>
<L>Let <HI>Christ-church Tom</HI> her loss vociferous roar,</L>
<L><HI>Tom,</HI> who ne'er mourn'd for aught but kings before;</L>
<L>In hymns of woe let every college join,</L>
<L>In social grief let every voice combine,</L>
<L>Let every heart with bursting sighs approve</L>
<L>Our sorrow as diffusive as her love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHILE she surviv'd, indulgent to our cause,</L>
<L>We bilk'd our founders and defy'd their laws,</L>
<L>Those grave old blockheads, whose religious pride</L>
<L>Would quench love's flame and check old na∣ture's tide,</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="59"/>Asswage hot blood, explode the genial tast,</L>
<L>And make mankind unnaturally chast.</L>
<L>Reliev'd by her from these imperious chains,</L>
<L>We knew the sweets of love, without the pains,</L>
<L>Clasp'd to her bosom, every college round</L>
<L>The joys of marriage, without marriage, found;</L>
<L>Spight of their musty statutes all the night</L>
<L>We roll'd in bliss and revel'd in delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AMIDST these transports, to our joys a slave,</L>
<L>Death praematurely snatch'd her to the grave;</L>
<L>That rank disease that fierce corroding flame,</L>
<L>Which takes from <HI>Venus</HI> its venereal name,</L>
<L>Siez'd on her bloom, polluted all her charms,</L>
<L>And with contagion fill'd her circling arms,</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="60"/>Through every vein the spreading poison rag'd,</L>
<L>And with her life could only be asswag'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DREAD foe to love! of human ills the worst!</L>
<L>Thou sorest plague, with which mankind is curst,</L>
<L>In distant climes, amongst the savage kind,</L>
<L>O! hadst thou ever, ever been confin'd,</L>
<L>Content the wild <HI>Barbarian</HI> to defile,</L>
<L>Nor with thy breath prophan'd the <HI>British</HI> isle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SAY, muse, in strains of elegiack woe,</L>
<L>What dire effects from such disasters flow,</L>
<L>That the precaution'd reader may beware,</L>
<L>And, conscious of the mischiefs, shun the snare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOON as it pierces with its subtle dart,</L>
<L>The coast of love, that weak unguarded part,</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="61"/>In doleful sounds the wounded youth complains</L>
<L>Of pungent sores, and sharp nocturnal pains,</L>
<L>His nerves are all relax'd, his eyes grow dim,</L>
<L>And rigid aches torture every limb,</L>
<L>His hot envenom'd blood corrupts within,</L>
<L>And loathsome ulcers stain his fading skin;</L>
<L>At length his nose dismantled sinks away,</L>
<L>His flesh turns rotten and his bones decay;</L>
<L>Too late repentance comes! and pills too late!</L>
<L>Nor can ev'n MISAUBIN reverse his fate;</L>
<L>Living, his wholesome friends avoid his sight,</L>
<L>And dying he pollutes the realms of night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AGAINST this ill (to vary from my tale)</L>
<L>But two specifick remedies prevail;</L>
<L>Virtue is one and purity of heart;</L>
<L>But if the flesh subdues the better part,</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="62"/>Another still remains, the fam'd <HI>machine</HI></L>
<L>(No doubt the reader guesses what I mean)</L>
<L>That modern rare device, whose injur'd name</L>
<L>Is grown opprobrious, though it covers shame;</L>
<L>Without this guard, if my advice prevail,</L>
<L>On venal joys you never will regale;</L>
<L>Then against fire-ships you may stand the test,</L>
<L>And trust the warmest nymph — <HI>probatum est.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO ancient warriours, buckled up in steel,</L>
<L>Laugh'd at the drubbings, which they could not feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>POOR COBURNE'S fate these sad reflections drew,</L>
<L>O! most unhappy, hapless nymph, adieu.</L>
<L>Tormenting loss! too grievous for the mind!</L>
<L>If gentle DUTTON were not left behind;</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="63"/>In her surviving charms we find relief,</L>
<L>On her soft bosom intermit our grief,</L>
<L>The painful hours in soft endearments waste,</L>
<L>And in our present joys forget the past.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HAIL charming fair! O! may'st thou ever prove</L>
<L>Free from the bane and pestilence of love;</L>
<L>Long may'st thou live, a soft luxurious life,</L>
<L>By turns of twenty colleges the wife,</L>
<L>With charms unfading glut the studious swains,</L>
<L>The favourite Toast of all our <HI>Oxford</HI> plains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ON this delighful subject, big with praise,</L>
<L>How could the muse prolong her wanton lays?</L>
<L>Unnumber'd beauties, equally divine,</L>
<L>Attract her eyes, and in her fancy shine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
<L>SALACIOUS CHILD the neighb'ring dons em∣brace,</L>
<L>And SHEPHARD blesses all the <HI>Cambrian</HI> race;</L>
<L>CRASSA with luscious beauties charms the sight,</L>
<L>And melts in greasy volumes of delight;</L>
<L>In TATHAM'S kitchen as she basts the meat,</L>
<L>The <HI>Maudlin</HI> smarts their tender vows repeat;</L>
<L>Oft as she plies the sauce-pan in her hand,</L>
<L>The <HI>Lincoln</HI> wits in silent rapture stand;</L>
<L>Oft as with whirling arms she winds the jack,</L>
<L>They suck the dewy moisture from her neck,</L>
<L>The savoury odors from her lips they kiss,</L>
<L>And wallow in a dripping-pan of bliss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FORGIVE me fair ones, who remain unsung,</L>
<L>Sound and unsound, ye tribe of old and young;</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="65"/>To praise you all who swarm in every plain,</L>
<L>Would swell my verse beyond an epick strain;</L>
<L>Each college stew a volume would require,</L>
<L>And BL—RE in the tedious task would tire.</L>

<L>No more with us contend for age or place;</L>
<L>At length confuted, quit the learned field,</L>
<L>And to your rival the precedence yield.</L>
<L>In times remote, before the <HI>Cam</HI> was known,</L>

<L>Arts now forgot her temples did adorn,</L>

<L>HAIL, honour'd madam! hail for arts renown'd,</L>
