<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE History, and Present State of China, as far as relates to its government, its sciences, and its arts, has long been considered worthy of the deepest research; and much information has been collected on these subjects, with considerable labour and expence, under the auspices of several of the most powerful courts in Europe. If the natural productions of that country have attracted less attention, it is only because their value and importance are less generally known; upon better acquaintance they would at once excite our astonishment, and convince us of their utility.</P>
<P>General readers are sometimes disposed to consider the Insect World as too minute and fri∣volous to deserve investigation. Let them remember, however, that to a foreign Insect the staple commodity of this kingdom is indebted for its richest dye; that from another we derive the most costly articles of dress, and splendid ornaments of luxury; and the utility of many others is appa∣rent in various branches of medicine, the arts, and domestic economy.</P>
<P>Prompted by these reflections, the Author determined to submit to the Public a Series of En∣gravings illustrative of the Entomology of China.—But flattering as the prospect of encourage∣ment to his project appeared, he would not presume to publish his Work till the result of the late Embassy of Earl Macartney to that country was fully known: of that the public are now in pos∣session; and, though, in common with every friend to the commercial advantages and scientific inquiries of this country, the Author must regret its issue, it is perhaps, on the whole, more favourable to the present Publication than if the event had been different. If indeed a more general intercourse had been established between the two nations, and the language of China had been better understood, it is impossible to calculate the advantages which Entomology, amongst other sciences, might have derived; for the Chinese, like their neighbours the Japanese, are well acquainted with the natural productions of their empire, and Zoology and Botany, in particular, are favourite studies amongst them. To what degree of excellence they have arrived in their scientific researches we are not informed, but we must not affect to despise the instruction of a people amongst whom the most useful arts, and sciences, first dawned and acquired a high degree of perfection, when "Europe had scarcely a few savages scattered over her forests."</P>
<P>The few, but interesting hints, which Sir George Staunton has given on the practical Ento∣mology of China, induces us to look forward to a period when some of the Insects, as well as Plants, of that vast empire may be no less objects of curiosity, than of national utility and im∣portance; the Chinese Cochineal Insect<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr. Anderson has found eight species of Cocci at Madras. One of these, he says, was found on a young citron-tree, Citrus Sinensis, just landed from China; it was more deeply intersected between the alxlominal rings than any of those of the coast, and he names it therefore C. Diacopeis.—<HI>Collection of Letters from Madras, Jan.</HI> 28, 1788.—The Cactus Cochinilifer has lately been found by Mr. Kincaid, at Canton; its Chinese name is <HI>Pau wang.</HI>—This has been transmitted to the <HI>Nopalry</HI> of the Hon. East India Company, at Madras, and promises to be of future advantage to the commercial concerns of Great Britain. We have been unable to procure any of the Chinese Cochineal insects, and purposely omit that species which Sir G. Staunton has noticed, because it has no relation to the productions of China.</NOTE> and that from which the wax of the cast is procured, 
<PB REF="3"/>are two species that deserve particular attention. The medical precepts of the Chinese will cer∣tainly find few votaries in Europe, but as articles of medicine, amongst others, the Meloe Ci∣chorei, which were the cantharides of the ancients, and are now used by the Chinese, may be of importance, as it possesses more virtues than the Meloe Vesicatorius used in our pharmacy: the Curculio regalis, Buprestis vittata, and many others, are also employed in articles of jewellery in the eastern parts of the world, and may vie with the richest gems in beauty and splendour.</P>
<P>These observations we presumed to offer on the Entomology of China, in submitting the Design of this undertaking to the public. We have solicitously endeavoured to gratify the cu∣riosity and expectation such observations were calculated to excite, and trust not altogether un∣successfully. On the economical purposes of the Chinese Insects we can offer little except con∣jectures; those may, however, assist the inquiries of future observers; and the general reader will not be disposed to regard it with less favour, if novelty and beauty supply the deficiency of useful information. It embraces, in one view, a variety of the most uncommon and brilliant species of that fertile region, portrayed in an elegant and faithful manner; and classically arranged accord∣ing to the favourite system of <HI>Linnaeus.</HI> Thus, whilst our Epitome of the Chinese Insects ex∣hibits a splendid display of this beauteous race, it may insensibly lead to a comprehensive survey of the system itself; and, by conveying instruction in its most pleasing form, facilitate the study of this charming, but much neglected science.</P>
<P>From its commencement, the Author has been encouraged by the liberal attention of several persons, whose names would reflect honour on this undertaking, were he at liberty to mention them. He has already observed that his own collection includes several thousand specimens, collected by amateurs of the first celebrity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The late Duchess Dowager of Portland, —Tunstall, Esq. Governor Holford, Smeethman, Ellis, Keate, Yeats, Forster, Baily, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. To this he may add, that every other collection he was desirous of consulting, has been kindly open to his inspection; and every information com∣municated with a readiness that merits his warmest thanks. Amongst these, he cannot refrain noticing the valuable collection of Drawings and MSS before alluded to; the specimens of In∣sects collected in the journey of his Excellency Earl MACARTNEY, in the late embassy to China; and the very magnificent collections of Mr. FRANCILLON and Mr. DRURY, from both of whom he had unreserved permission to figure and describe whatever his own cabinet could not furnish. And, finally, he must own himself particularly indebted to the favours of the Right Hon. Sir J. BANKS, Bart. K. B. whose invaluable cabinet and library have afforded him every assistance in completing his design, and for which he begs leave to testify his most grate∣ful acknowledgments.</P>

<P>S. Molossus and S. Bucephalus are very common in China. The first seems a local species, the latter is said to be found in other parts of the East Indies. <HI>Olivier</HI> has given three varieties of Scarabaeus Molossus. The specimen figured in the annexed plate is the <HI>var. c.</HI> of that author.</P>
<P>The larvae of the larger kinds of coleopterous insects, abounding in unctuous moisture, are not less esteemed as food among some modern nations, than they were by the epicures of antiquity. In Jamaica, and other islands in the West Indies, the Macokko<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prionus damicornis. <HI>Fab. Ent. Syst.</HI>— Cerambyx damicornis. <HI>Linn. Mant.</HI></NOTE> larva is an article of luxurious food; and in China most insects in that state are appropriated to the same purpose. Thus also the Romans introduced the larvae of the Lucani<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stag beetles.</NOTE> and Cerambyes<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Capricorn, or Goat beetles.</NOTE> in their voluptuous repasts; previously feeding them on farinaceous substances to give consistence to the animal juices.</P>
<P>The learned author of the last account we have of China, says, "Under the roots of the canes is found a large white grub, which being fried in oil is eaten as a dainty by the Chinese." Perhaps this is the larva of Scarabaeus Molossus, which, like many other of the Scarabaei,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The larvae of the Scarabaei live in the trunks of decayed trees, in putrid and filthy animal substances, or in the earth. The last are the most injurious, because they destroy the roots of plants. All the known kinds of these larvae are of an unwieldy form, and whitish colour, the skin free from hairs, and only the head and sore feet defended with a shelly covering.</NOTE> may live sedentary in the ground, and subsist on the roots of plants: the general description and abundance of this insect in China favours such opinion. The same author observes, in another part of his work, that "the aurelias of the silk worm which is cultivated in China, after the silk is wound off, furnish an article for the table." This also is a very ancient custom among the Asiatics, and even Europeans, before the sixteenth century, if we may credit Aldrovandus:<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The German soldiers sometimes fry and eat silk worms. <HI>Aldrov.</HI></NOTE> it is certain the worms, if not the aurelias, were administered in medicine in early ages,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Silk worms dried, powdered, and put on the crown of the head, help the <HI>vertigo</HI> and <HI>convulsions;</HI> mundify or cleanse the blood, &amp;c. &amp;c. <HI>Schroderus, Serapio, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>Scarabaeus Sacer is a native of China; it is also found in other parts of the East Indies, in Egypt, Bar∣bary, the Cape of Good Hope, and other countries of Africa, and throughout the south of Europe.</P>
<P>A few remains of ancient monuments, and some fragments of historic information, preserved from an early period of the world, afford certain and interesting details of this inconsiderable creature. Those remains evince indeed but the first dawning of natural and moral philosophy on the human mind, but, connected with the history of the insect before us, are too important to be passed over in silence.</P>
<P>The Scarabaeus was held in profound veneration by the people of Egypt.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The species worshipped by the Egyptians is precisely noted by Linnaeus. <HI>Scarabaeus sacer:</HI> and also by Olivier. <HI>Scarabé sacré.</HI> "Cet insecte étoit autrefois en veneration en Egypt." <HI>Oliv.</HI></NOTE> They regarded it as a visible deity; but a more refined system of religious worship prevailed in their temples among the priests and sages.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Eschenbach, Jablouski, Savary, &amp;c.</NOTE> They deemed it only the symbol of their god, and, ascribing both sexes to the <HI>Scarab,</HI> it became a striking emblem of a self-created and supreme first cause.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">"The father, mother, male and female art thou." <HI>Synesius. Hymn. Phtha.</HI>—"The Egyptian spirit <HI>Phtha</HI> gave chaos form, and then created all things." <HI>Jamblichus de Mysteriis, sect.</HI> 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>This insect was more especially the symbol of their god Neith,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neith.</HI> The disposer of all things, &amp;c. <HI>Jablonski.</HI> "Sais," of the Delta, "the capital of its district, is a considerable city, of which Amasis was king. <HI>Neith,</HI> the Minerva of the Greeks, is the titular divinity." <HI>Plato in Timaeo.</HI>— "On the door of the temple of <HI>Neith</HI> was engraved in hieroglyphics, 'I am what is, what was, what shall be; mortal has never raised my veil; the sun is the fruit of my womb." <HI>Proclus Commentary on the Timaeus of Plato,</HI> &amp;c.—These passages demonstrate Neith and Phtha to be two attributes of one spirit. The third attribute is Cneph, or divine goodness. <HI>Savary.</HI></NOTE> whose attribute was power supreme in governing the works of creation, and whose glory was increased, rather than diminished, by the presence of a superior being, <HI>Phtha,</HI> the creator. The theological definition of the two powers being independent, yet centering in one spirit, is implied by the figurative union of two sexes in the Scarab. In the latter sense it signified therefore but one omnipotent power. The Scarab, typifying Neith, was carved or painted on a
<PB REF="7"/>ring, and worn by the soldiers, as a token of homage to that power who disposed of the fate of battles;<NOTE N="l">Authors quote a doubtful passage in <HI>Herapollo Hieroglyph. lib.</HI> 1. to support this opinion. That such rings were worn by the ancient Egyptians is beyond conjecture, many remains of them, and some very perfect, have been found in the subterranean caverns and sepulchres in the Plain of Mummies near Saccara and Giza. Those which we have examined, are remarkable for the convexity, or full <HI>relievo</HI> of the figure sculptured on them, in some it is of the natural size of the insect, but generally smaller; the stone, cornelian, without a rim, and turning on a swivel ring of gold.</NOTE> and sculptured on astronomical tables, or on columns,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus says the Scarabaeus facer is sculptured on the antique Egyptian columns in Rome. "Hic in columnis antiquis Romae exsculptus ab Aegyptiis." <HI>Syst. Nat.</HI> Does Linnaeus allude to any remains of those colossal obelisks, which Augustus trans∣ported to Rome when he subjugated Egypt, or others of more recent date? It would increase the interest of our enquiries, to learn, that the Scarabaeus was among the hieroglyphics, on the two very ancient obelisks, carried from Heliopolis, the city of the Sun.
<P>The indefinite and visionary interpretations, imposed on most Egyptian hieroglyphics through a long series of ages, will barely support a few conjectures on their original signification. Those which related to local incidents, history, or the arts, are veiled in profound obscurity. The phaenomena of nature, and astronomical calculations, inscribed in those characters, are scarcely better understood, though the knowledge of those sciences have been in part handed down to us from the learned Egyptians in remote ages. We are informed by ancient writers, that the Scarabaeus engraved on the astronomical tables of these people, implied the divine Wisdom which governed the motion and order of the celestial bodies; that those tables were huge and massy stones, or columns of granite, with the characters and figures, large, and highly embossed; in short, such as were supposed capa∣ble of long resistance to the corroding hand of time. Among those the Scarab was probably the most conspicuous, its size gigantic, and the figure frequently repeated; for this we have observed, even on small Egyptian antiques.</P>
<P>Various valuable remains of tablets, with figures of the <HI>Scarabaeus sacer,</HI> are preserved in the British Museum and other col∣lections of antiquities in this country. Those we have examined are of various descriptions, some smaller than the insect itself, others of a monstrous size. The stones on which they are sculptured generally <HI>green nephritic</HI> or <HI>jade stone,</HI> or a kind of <HI>basaltes,</HI> and black marble; the figure <HI>basso relievo,</HI> on a tablet or slab, but oftener in <HI>relievo,</HI> with the prominent characters of the insect very accurately defined, particularly the six dentations of the clypeo, and those of the tibiae. The reverse of the embossed side is flat and smooth, and abounds in characters altogether unknown, though, from the number of religious objects of worship occasionally interspersed, we may presume they contain an ample store of the ancient sacerdotal language: the most remarkable were the scarab, the sceptre and eye,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Osyris,</HI> or the sun.</NOTE> the human figure with a dog's head,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Anubis.</NOTE> the hawk,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Horus,</HI> a famous deity, had three cities dedicated, called by the Greeks the cities of <HI>Apollo.</HI></NOTE> and the Ibis,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The mummies of these birds are found in urns, in the subterranean galleries called the well of birds near <HI>Sacc..ra,</HI> supposed from the size to be the Tantalus Ibis of Linnaeus.</NOTE> or sacred bird. On the thorax of one fine specimen we remarked four elegant figures. One of them is holding a <HI>cornucopia</HI> in the left hand, and a branch in the right: this is perhaps a subordinate deity of the Nile, that river having been once found depictured on an an∣tique Alexandrian coin, like an aged man, holding the cornucopia, and a branch of the Papyrus; denoting its abundance and produce.</P>
<P>The digression on the mythological history of this insect may be considered by some as a tedious deviation from the pursuit of the naturalist; with others we trust it will be more favourably received; for it proves to the unprejudiced mind how deeply the history of nature, and in the present instance the science of Entomology, involves a most important enquiry into the first philosophical opinions of the human race. The means, however trifling, must not be contemned, which illumine the most sublime of all human researches,—<HI>The Study of Mankind.</HI></P></NOTE> it expressed the divine wisdom which regulates the uni∣verse and enlightens man.</P>

<P>The Buprestides form an extensive, and most brilliant tribe of coleopterous insects. Brasil and New Holland produce some gigantic species, but none more beautiful than those of India. We need adduce no other proof of this, than Buprestis chrysis, sternicorus, attenuata, ocellata, and vittata. These wrought into various devices, and trinkets, decorate the dresses<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">A pair of slippers embroidered with little pieces of the wing cases of this insect is preserved in the Leverian Museum</NOTE> of the natives in many parts of India. The Buprestis vittata in particular, is much admired among them. It is, we believe, entirely peculiar to China, where it is found in vast abundance, and distributed from thence at a low price among the other Indians. The Chinese, who always profit by the curiosity of Europeans, collect vast quantities of this Buprestis, and other gay insects, in the interior of the country, and traffic with them.</P>
<P>A considerable error seems to have arisen concerning this species, and the true Buprestis ignita of Lin∣naeus. All authors, except Fabricius and Olivier, have considered the Buprestis vittata, and ignita, the same. Fabricius, in his <HI>Species Insectorum,</HI> refers to <HI>Mus. Dom. Banks</HI> only, for the Buprestis vittata; and to the 14th figure, plate 6, in <HI>Sulzer</HI>'s work, for a figure of Buprestis ignita. In the <HI>Entomologia Systematica</HI> we however find the same reference to the figure of <HI>Sulzer,</HI> for B. vittata<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. part 2. p. 186. 5.</NOTE>; and, to increase the perplexity, precisely the same reference under that of B. ignita<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. part 2. p. 192. 28.</NOTE> also.</P>
<P><PB REF="24"/>The Buprestis ignita of Linnaeus, we imagined, was unknown in the cabinets of the curious in this country, till we discovered an insect nearly corresponding in character with it, in the collection of Mr. Drury, and which we presume is the B. ignita, or at least a variety of it. It has not the brilliance of colours that so eminently distinguishes B. vittata, but in form and size it agrees with it. The only figure of that species is given by Olivier, from a specimen formerly in the cabinet of Gigot d'Orcy, of Paris. We have exa∣mined the specimen in the cabinet of Sir J. Banks, referred to by Fabricius as B. vittata, and find the figure in Sulzer is of that species, as well as the specimen we have represented.</P>
<P>Fabricius has given as a part of the specific distinction of these insects, that B. ignita has <HI>three spines</HI> at the end of each wing case, or elytron, and B. vittata no more than <HI>two.</HI> This may form a sufficient cha∣racteristic in those species; but we must remark, that it is not so in Buprestis ocellata. We have two speci∣mens that have two spines at the end of each elytron, and another with three, as Fabricius has described it. We also find several insects nearly allied to B. vittata, the stripe of gold on each side excepted; one of these has six teeth, another four teeth, and a third only two.</P>
<P>The Buprestides are supposed, for the most part, to undergo their transformations in the water, or marshy ground.</P>

<P>The Buprestis ocellata is a native of China, and is very rare: specimens of it have been found in parcels of the common sort. Olivier says it is from <HI>Chandernagore</HI> in the East Indies. Mr. Drury has an extra∣ordinary variety of this insect from China, in which the two spots unite at the future so as to form only one large spot on the back when the wing cases are closed.</P>
<P>These spots on the wing cases are strikingly characteristic of this species; at least we have not ob∣served them in any other of the Buprestis genus. They are usually situated in the centre of each elytron; are somewhat pellucid, and in fine specimens are cream colour, surrounded with a crimson circle. These spots are sometimes brown; probably they become so after the insect dies.</P>

<P>This insect is very common in China, and some other parts of the East Indies. The small specimen is

According to Olivier, the Meloe cichorei is used by the Chinese in their medical preparations instead of the Cantharis vesicatorius of the Europeans, and is supposed to be more efficacious in certain cases. The same author quotes a passage in <HI>Dioscoride Med.

"The most efficacious sort of Cantharides," says Dioscoride, "are of many colours, having yellow transverse bands; the body oblong, big, and sat; those of only one colour are without <HI>strength.</HI>" The description Dioscoride has given, does not agree with our species of Cantharides, as they are of a fine green colour, but is more applicable to the <HI>Mylabre de la Cichorei,</HI> which is very common in the country where Dioscoride lived. <HI>Olivier's Entomologie, ou Hist.

<P>The Cantharides of the ancients, are by no means to be confounded with those of medical writers in the last century. By the term Cantharides, in an European <HI>Pharmacopeia,</HI> we understand the Meloe vesicatorius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Geoffroy calls this a Cantharis. The Linnaean Cantharis is a distinct genus.</NOTE> of Linnaeus, an insect whose medicinal properties are very generally known<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Applied externally to raise blisters. It is a violent poison taken inwardly, except in small portions.</NOTE>. The Cantharides of the ancients can scarcely be ascertained; it was a term indiscriminately applied to several kinds of insects, and too often without regard to their physical virtues. Pliny speaks of the Cantharis as a small beetle that eats and consumes corn; and of another that breeds in the tops of ashes and wild olives, and shines like gold. The ancients were certainly well acquainted with our common sort, though it is confounded with others in a general appellation<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The common sort has been called <HI>Musca Hispanica</HI> by some Latin authors, and hence Spanish fly by Boyle.</NOTE>. <HI>Hippocrates, Galen, Pliny, Matthiclus,</HI> and other physical writers of antiquity, treat of the medicinal uses of Cantharides; but it is not clear that they alluded to only one species<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Olivier endeavours to prove that the Mylabris Cichorei is the ancient Cantharides; the authority of his opinion is cre∣dible, and the inference natural, if not conclusive. But if it were in use, so also might the common sort, for Dioscoride, whom he quotes, mentions those of only one colour also. The ancients often confounded the term Scarabaeus with Cantharis; but whether because they knew that the common kinds of Scarabaei produce the same effects as the Cantharis, is uncertain.—<HI>The Scarabaeus auratus,</HI> and <HI>Melolontha,</HI> several <HI>Coccinellae, Cimex nigro-lineatus, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> have a place in the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> as <HI>Cantharides.</HI></NOTE></P></NOTE></P>

<P>This Mantis is described by Fabricius only. Stoll has given the figure of an insect not unlike it in his publication; and we have seen a specimen similar to it, which was found by Professor Pallas near the Caspian sea. It is allied to Mantis Gongyloides, a native of Africa and Asia, but bears a closer affinity to Mantis Pauperata<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Figured by Stoll under the name of <HI>La Mante Goutteuse Brune?</HI></NOTE> from Java, Molucca, and perhaps other islands in the Indian sea.</P>
<P>Fabricius enumerates fifty-one species of this genus in his last system; a considerable portion of these are from Asia: had he included the lately discovered kinds in America and New Holland, his genus would have been far more comprehensive. Few naturalists have had the opportunity of observing the manners of these creatures in distant countries; nor can we always rely on the information those few have given. Of the European species we can speak with more precision, because some indefatigable naturalists have at∣tended minutely to them; Roesel in particular has treated at considerable length on the manners of the Mantis Religiosa of Linnaeus.</P>
<P>Descriptions can only convey an imperfect idea of the extraordinary appearance of many creatures in∣cluded in the Mantis and Locusta genera. Among them are found species that bear a similitude to the usual forms of other insects; but, from these we almost imperceptibly descend to others, bearing as strong a simi∣litude to the vegetable part of creation; seeming as if Nature designed them to unite the appearance of a vegetable with the vital functions of an animal, to preserve them from the ravages of voracious creatures, or to connect that chain of progressive and universal being, which</P>
<Q>" The great directing MIND of ALL ordains."</Q>
<P>Many of these creatures assume so exactly the appearance of the leaves of different trees, that they fur∣nish
<PB REF="33"/>the entomologist with unerring specific distinctions; thus we have <HI>L. citrifolia, laurifolia, myrtifolia, oleifolia, graminifolia,</HI> and others, equally expressive of their resemblance in form, and colours, to the leaves of those respective plants. Travellers in countries that produce these creatures, have been struck with the phaenomenon, as it must appear, of animated vegetable substances; for the manners of the Mantis, in addition to its structure, are very likely to impose on the senses of the uninformed. They often remain on the trees for hours without motion, then suddenly spring into the air, and, when they settle, again appear lifeless. These are only stratagems to deceive the more cautious insects which it feeds upon; but some travellers who have observed it, have declared they saw the leaves of those trees become living crea∣tures, and take flight.</P>
<P>M. Merian informs us of a similar opinion among the Indians, who believed these insects grow like leaves on the trees, and when they were mature, loosened themselves and crawled, or flew; away. From the credulous, and unscientific, marvellous reports of such extraordinary creatures may be expected; but, to these we must add the authority of a naturalist, whose works are a valuable addition to our present knowledge of the history of nature: these are the works of Piso<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gulielmi Pisonis, Amsterl. <HI>1657.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

The feet are fixed into the ground first; from these, when necessary humidity is attracted, roots grow out, and strike into the ground; thus they change by degrees, and in a short time become a perfect plant. Sometimes only the lower part takes the nature and form of a plant, while the upper part remains as before, living and moveable: after some time the animal is gradually converted into a plant. In this Nature seems to operate in a circle, by a continual retrograde motion."</P>
<P>Has the father of inventive romance outdone this account of Piso in his well-known extravagant poetical effusions<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Luna quater junctis implêrat cornibus orbem, &amp;c. OVIDII Metamorph. —<HI>Sorores Phaëthontis in Arbores.</HI>

<P>We quote this part of the poem at length; for as we peruse it, every successive line, bears a stronger similitude to the wonderful transformation of the Mantis as related by <HI>Piso;</HI> we might be almost tempted to condemn the description of the naturalist as a servile copy of Ovid's verses, if the similar transformation of other insects above noticed, had not occurred to the knowledge of every entomologist.</P></NOTE>? It may be imagined he has not; but before we dismiss his account with a hasty
<PB REF="34"/>censure, let us attend to the opinion of a few authors, nearly contemporary with himself: we find these collected in the criticisms of Roesel on that passage.</P>
<P>From these it appears that the works of Piso were much admired when first published, but we rely less implicitly on the information it contains, than his readers in the last century. Roesel treats his account with more than merited severity; not because he could contradict the relation of Piso, but, because he had never observed the same circumstance attend the Wandering Leaf, or Mantis Oratoria, in Europe<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Among the annotations on the last edition of Roesel's <HI>Insecten Bellustigung</HI> we find one relating to this part of the works of Piso. "<HI>Der seel Her geheime Rath Trew, &amp;c.</HI> Couns. Trew assures Mr. Roesel that <HI>Piso</HI> not only very often gave out the credible observations of others, as his own, but himself believed the most incredible relations, and pretended to be an eye witness thereof." We quote this in justice to the remarks of Roesel. <HI>Note in page</HI> 10, <HI>section Das Wandlende Blat.</HI></NOTE>. This reasoning is neither so conclusive, or liberal, as we should expect from Roesel; and more especially as he afterwards describes even the first symptom of the transformation as related by Piso. When he speaks of the death of the European species his words are, "As their dissolution approaches, their green eyes become brown, and they unavoidably lose their sight: they remain a long while on the same spot, till at last they fall quite exhausted and powerless, as if asleep." What is this but substantiating part of the evi∣dence of Piso, which he has laboured before to discredit? As to the change after they remained long on the ground, such as sending forth fibres, roots, and stems, from the body of the insect, it is only astonishing such a well-informed naturalist should have deemed it matter of surprise. Could he be ignorant of the many instances that occur, of animal substances producing plants<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Such as Mucor crustaceus, &amp;c.</NOTE>? or was lie not informed that the pupa which commonly sends forth a bee, a wasp, or cicada; has sometimes become the nidus of a plant, thrown up stems from the fore part of the head, and changed in every respect into a vegetable, though still re∣taining the shell and exterior appearance of the parent insect at the root<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Specimens of these vegetated animals, are frequently brought from the West Indies; we have one of the cicada from the pupa, as well as others produced from wasps and bees in the perfect or winged slate. Mr. Drury has a beetle in the perfect slate, from every part of which, small stalks and sibies have sprouted forth; they are very different from the tufts of hair that are observed on a few coleopterous insects, such as the Buprestis sascicularis, of the Cape of Good Hope; they are certainly a vegetable production.</NOTE>? We own at first sight with Roesel that the account of Piso seems " an inattentive and confounded observation," but that an insect may strike root into the earth, and, from the co-operation of heat, and moisture, congenial to vegetation, produce a plant of the <HI>cryptogamia</HI> kind, cannot be disputed. We have seen species of <HI>clavaria</HI> both of the undivided and branched kinds, four times larger than the insect from which they sprang; and can we then deny that the insect mentioned by Piso might not produce a plant of a proportionate magnitude? In short, are we so well acquainted with the productions of Brasil as to contradict any of his assertions, concerning this transformation? Piso does not say of what kind this vegetable was; it must surely be of the fungi
<PB REF="35"/>kind: reasoning then from analogy, it might be an unknown species of <HI>clavaria</HI> with numerous and spreading branches; and, finally, the colour of his plant, on which authors lay much stress, might be green, though a colour not so predominant in that tribe of vegetables as some others.</P>
<P>The largest and most interesting of the Indian species of Mantis is found in the isle of Amboyna. Stoll contradicts the account of <HI>Renard</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Poissons des Molucques par M. Renard, Amsterl. 1754.</NOTE>, who says these creatures are sometimes thirteen inches in length; but we have a specimen almost of that size. It is related by Renard, and others, that the larger kinds of Mantes go in vast troops, cross hills, rivers, and other obstacles that oppose their march, when they are in quest of food. If they subsisted entirely on vegetables, a troop of these voracious creatures would desolate the land in their excursions; but they prefer insects, and clear the earth of myriads that infest it: if these become scarce from their ravages, they fight and devour one another. When they attack the plants, they do great mischief. It is said of some Locusts and Mantes that the plants they bite wither, and appear as if scorched with fire: we have not heard of this pestilential property in any of the larger species of Mantes.</P>
<P>Of the smaller kinds, the Mantis Oratoria is the most widely diffused, being found in Africa and Asia as well as in all the warmer parts of Europe. These creatures are esteemed sacred by the vulgar in many countries, from their devout or supplicating posture. The Africans worship them; and their trivial names in many European languages imply a superstitious respect for them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Louva Dios by the Portuguese. Presque Dieu by the French.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>England produces no species of this tribe. The entomologists in this country must consequently rely on the accounts of those, who have observed them in other parts of the world. We shall select a few remarks from Roesel's extensive description of Mantis Oratoria and Gongyloides, because, if we may pre∣sume from the analogy they bear in form to Mantis Flabellicornis, the history of one will clearly elucidate that of the other.</P>
<P>Roesel says, some of the Mantes are local in Germany; they are found chiefly in the vintages at Moedting in <HI>Moravia,</HI> where they are called <HI>Weinhandel</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Probably a provincial term for a dealer in wine.</NOTE>. The males die in October, the females soon after<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Goetz, in his Beytrage, observes, that they live sometimes ten years.</NOTE>. The young brood are preserved in the egg state, in a kind of oblong bag, of a thick spongy substance; this bag is imbricated on the outside; it is fastened lengthwise to the branch of some plant<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">To that of the vine in Mantis Oratoria.</NOTE>. As the eggs ripen they are protruded through the thick substance of the bag, and the larva, which are about half an inch in length, burst from them. Roesel, wishing to observe the gradual progress of these creatures, to the winged state, placed the bag containing the eggs in a large glass, which he closed, to prevent their escape. From the time they were first hatched they exhibited marks of a savage disposition. He put different sorts of plants into the glass, but they refused them, to prey on one another: this determined him to supply them with other insects to eat: he put <HI>ants</HI> into the glass to them, but they then betrayed as much cow∣ardice,
<PB REF="36"/>as they had barbarity before; for the instant the Mantes saw the ants they tried to escape in every direction. By this Roesel found the ants were the greatest persecutors of the Mantes. He next gave them some of the common musca (house flies), which they seized with eagerness in their fore claws, and tore in pieces: but, though these creatures seemed very fond of the flies, they continued to destroy one another through savage wantonness. Despairing at last, from their daily decrease, of rearing any to the winged state, he separated them into small parcels in different glasses; but, here, as before, the strongest of each community destroyed the rest.</P>
<P>Another time, he received several pair of Mantes in the winged state; profiting by his former obser∣vation, he put each pair [a male and female] into a separate glass, but they still shewed signs of an eternal enmity towards one another, which neither sex nor age could soften; for the instant they were in sight of each other, they threw up their heads, brandished their fore legs, and waited the attack: they did not remain long in this posture, for the boldest throwing open its wings, with the velocity of lightning, rushed at the other, and often tore it in pieces with the crockets and spines of the fore claws. Roesel compares the attack of these creatures to that of two hussars; for they dexterously guard and cut with the edge of the fore claws, as those soldiers do with their sabres, and sometimes at a stroke, one cleaves the other through, or severs its head from the thorax. After this the conqueror devours his vanquished antagonist.</P>
<P>We learn from Roesel also, the manner in which this creature takes its prey, in which respect we find it agrees with what is related of the extra European species. The patience of this Mantis is remarkable, and the posture to which superstition has attributed devotion, is no other, than the means it uses to catch it. When it has fixed its eyes on an insect, it very rarely loses sight of it, though it may cost some hours to take. If it sees the insect a little beyond its reach, over its head, it slowly erects its long thorax, by means of the moveable membranes that connect it to the body at the base; then, resting on the four posterior legs, it gradually raises the anterior pair also; if this brings it near enough to the insect, it throws open the last joint, or crocket part, and snaps it between the spines, that are set in rows on the second joint. If it is unsuccessful, it does not retract its arms, but holds them stretched out, and waits again till the insect is within its reach, when it springs up and seizes it. This is the uncommon posture before alluded to. Should the insect go far from the spot, it flies, or crawls after it, slowly on the ground like a cat, and when the insect stops, erects itself as before. They have a small black pupil or sight which moves in all directions within the parts we usually term the eyes, so that it can see its prey in any direction without having occasion to disturb it, by turning its head.</P>
<P>The most prevalent colour of this tribe of insects is fine green, but many of these fade or become brown after the insect dies: some are finely decorated with a variety of vivid hues; the most beautiful of these, that we have seen, are from the Moluccas.</P>

<P>The Gryllus morbillosus appears in the early addition of the <HI>Systema Naturae,</HI> and the works of Roesel, as an Indian species: Mr. Drury assures us he has received it several times from China. Another sort is
<PB REF="44"/>also found at the Cape of Good Hope, which is rather larger and deeper in colour than the Chinese variety.</P>
<P>When this insect is at rest, the wings are folded, and much of its beauty is concealed: but when these are expanded, its appearance is altogether magnificent. It has nothing of the shining and metallic splen∣dour of the Coleopterae, for its colours are translucent, and assume their richest hues when they pass before the light. The elytra are purple, variegated with yellow: the wings of a glowing crimson, spotted with black. The abdomen is surrounded with alternate zones of black and yellow, and the legs are throughout of an elegant scarlet, inferior only in brightness to the coral red of the head and thorax. Upon the whole, this species is embellished with such a profusion of various and beautiful colours, that it may be considered as a most splendid example of the Hemipterous order of insects. It is represented on the <HI>Iris Chinensis</HI> in a flying position.</P>
<P>This is not supposed to be a numerous species in China; on the contrary, it is probably uncommon. Several others of the locust are abundant in that country, and in seasons favourable to their increase, do incredible mischief<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">"Famines sometimes happen in this part of the province. In some seasons inundations, produced by torrents from the mountains, and as often the depredations of locusts are causes of this disaster." <HI>Vide Sir J. Staunton, Chap. on Tien-sing.</HI></NOTE>. Both the Gryllus tartaricus, and Gryllus migratorius, inhabit Tartary on the northern confines of China, from whence, at certain periods, they descend like an impetuous torrent over the neighbouring countries in quest of food, strip the earth of verdure, and scarcely leave the vestige of vegetation behind them. The Gryllus migratorius, whose myriads are said to darken the face of heaven in their flights, sometimes direct their course westward; cross rivers, sea, and an immense extent of country, till they reach Europe; and though many are lost in these bold migrations, the survivors are in sufficient numbers to commit vast depredations. This species has been known to visit England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The last appearance of this species in England was in 1748. We have a specimen of it from Smyrna, Germany, and China, and deem it too common and general an inhabitant to merit a figure as a Chinese insect.</NOTE>, but not in any abundance. In Little Tartary, and the European provinces of Turkey: in Italy, and in Ger∣many<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Roesel speaks of this locust infesting the provinces of Wallachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania, in such immense numbers, in the years 1747, 1748, and 1749, that an <HI>Imperial and Royal Hungarian edict</HI> was issued, with printed instructions for the best means of exterminating them. <HI>Vide Der Heuschrecten-und Grillensammlung, &amp;c. &amp;c. Vol. II. page</HI> 193.</NOTE>, they do great mischief in these migrations. The Gryllus flavicornis and nasutus, are two other abundant species in China, and no doubt there are many other common kinds in that country we are at present unacquainted with. The locust is only detrimental when in immense numbers, for in China, as in other eastern countries, they are considered as an article of food, and regularly exposed for sale in the public markets<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Sir G. Staunton likewise speaks of "a large species of Gryllus" that is kept in cages for amusement in China, and was exposed for sale, with other insects, in the shops of Hai-ten.

<P>The phenomena resulting from the properties and effects of light, having engaged the attention of the earliest philosophers, we must conclude, that phosphorical appearances, and those especially of animated bodies, could not fail to attract their particular notice. Indeed it is evident, from the writings of the ac∣curate observers of nature in remote ages, that they were acquainted with certain insects that have the property of shining in the night. These were known only by general terms, expressive of that property; yet it is probable that some of the Linnaean lampyrides, which are abundant in the south of Europe, as well as in Asia, and some parts of Africa, were the first of the illuminated insects known to them<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The lampyris of <HI>Pliny</HI> is expressly the insect with a shining tail.</NOTE>. Some of the males which are furnished with wings, and are illuminated like the semales, were striking objects of natural history, and could scarcely have escaped their notice. The Greeks included all shining insects under the name lampyris; and the Latins called them cicindela, noctiluca, luciola. lucernata, &amp;c. Whether any of the <HI>Fulgorae,</HI> were known to the ancients is uncertain: probably they were not, the most remarkable species being peculiar to the warmest parts of America. Asia, once the feat of learning, does indeed pro∣duce a few species; but we have no account of these in ancient natural history.</P>
<P><PB REF="47"/>The Fulgorae seem to have been entirely unknown in Europe till the latter end of the last century; when two writers published descriptions and figures of <HI>Fulgora Lanternaria.</HI> Madame Merian, of Holland, in her splendid work on the Metamorphosis of the Insects of Surinam, and Dr. Grew, of London, in his Rarities of Gresham College.</P>
<P>Reaumur<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire des Insectes. 1734.</NOTE> is the next author who described the <HI>Fulgora Lanternaria,</HI> and after him Roesel, in his "Amusing History (or recreation) of Insects<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Insecten Belustigung.</NOTE>." This brings us to the period in which <HI>Fulgora Candelaria,</HI> our Chinese species, was first known in Europe: a circumstance of much importance to naturalists at that time, because the first mentioned species was a solitary example of its singular genus. The transactions of the Stockholm academy includes the earliest figure and description of this extraordinary insect; from these Linnaeus described it in his <HI>Systema Naturae;</HI> but his arrangement has undergone many alterations since that time. At first he included it among the Coleopterous insects; then he called them Lanternariae; and again, they were classed with the Cicadae;. These have been since corrected, and a new genus formed of insects with elongated trunks on their foreheads exclusively, under the name Fulgora, a name that has been adopted by later authors, and finally by Fabricius.</P>
<P>Roesel has given three figures and a description of the <HI>Fulgora Candelaria;</HI> from his account we learn that it was known in England before he was acquainted with it. On its peculiar qualities, he observes he must be entirely silent, because he had been unable to derive any information concerning it; his description is notwithstanding extremely prolix, and occupies four quarto pages; as he notices every trifling particular of the spots, colours, &amp;c. of the insect. We have selected the most interesting passage, because it clearly marks the progressive advancement of the knowledge of natural history in Europe, so late as the middle of the present century.</P>
<P>"According to my promise," says Roesel<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Versprochener massen lieseve ich nunmehr die zwente Sorte des Lanternen-Tragers, &amp;c. Vol. 1. pl. 30. Locust, page 189.</NOTE>, "I now produce the second sort of Lantern-carrier, which I never saw before; and of which I have never read in any work on insects. The scarcer however it may be, the more I am indebted to Mr. Beurer, apothecary of this place<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Nurenberg.</NOTE>, &amp;c. for the permission he has granted me to draw and enrich my collection with it. Mr. Collinson has sent it to him from London, under the name Lanternaria Chinensis, for which reason I have called it the Asiatic or Chinese Lantern-carrier." Roesel being a respectable entomological writer of his time, we must infer that <HI>Fulgora Candelaria</HI> was extremely scarce in Europe when his plate and descriptions were published. The commercial concerns of Europeans with the Chinese having greatly increased since that period, has facilitated many inquiries con∣cerning the natural productions of China; and a mongst a variety of other insects that are now usually brought from that country, specimens of Fulgora Candelaria are not uncommon. In China few insects are found in greater abundance.</P>
<P><PB REF="48"/>The authors who have figured or described the Chinese Fulgora, since Roesel, are De Geer<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">De Geer. Histoire des Insectes. 1752.</NOTE>, Seba<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Seba. Thesaurus Naturae. 1765.</NOTE>, Sulzer<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Kenwzeichen der Insecten (Characteristics of Insects). 1761.</NOTE>, and our countryman Edwards<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Edwards's Birds, 410. London, 1743.</NOTE>. De Geer gives a very concise description, and no figure; and Seba merely observes, in his description of Fulgora Candelaria, "La Chine produit une autre espéce du même genre mais beaucoup plus petite et toute differente." Edwards has given a figure of it in one of the plates in his work of Birds.

<P>Having noticed the several authors who have treated on this insect, we come to consider the peculiar properties of its fingular genus; and among these we find the most astonishing that insects can possess, that of emanating light: not merely a momentary shining appearance, as is produced by many viscous substances, but a clear and constant resemblance to the element, fire; and capable of diffusing light to sur-rounding objects, though totally destitute of every principle that can do mischief. To the unphilosophical mind it appears at first impossible, and it cannot fail to astonish the best informed. Indeed, some readers might be inclined to doubt the veracity of travellers in foreign countries, who have seen a vegetable<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">An instance of this occurs its the south of Europe. An account in the Philosophical Transactions relates of the Dictamnus Albus (Fraxinella), that "it in the still evenings of dry seasons it emits a n inflammable air, or gas, and flashes at the appproach of a candle. There are certain instances of human creatures who have taken fire spontaneously, and been totally consumed."</NOTE> or an animal produce light, if our own country could not supply us with abundant analogous proofs of such phaenomenae. The presence of this animated phosphorus, if we may so express it, is observed on several insects that are natives of England: it is needless to enumerate them, because the most striking example must be recollected by every rural inhabitant, or admirer of poetical simplicity.</P>

It is indeed a digression from the account of <HI>Fulgora Candelaria,</HI> but will tend to prove, that insects of this genus emit a more vivid light than any of the illuminated kinds hitherto known.
<P>"Once," says Madame Merian, "when the Indians brought me a number of these Lantern carriers, I put them into a wooden box, without being aware of their shining at night; but one night, being awakened by an unusual noise, and much frightened, I jumped out of bed, and ordered a light, not knowing whence this noise proceeded. We soon perceived that it originated in the box, we opened with some inquietude, but were still more alarmed, after opening it, and letting it fall on the ground, for a <HI>flame</HI> appeared to issue from it, which seemed to receive additional lustre, as often as another insect slew out of it. When we observed this some time, we recovered from our terror, and admired the splendour of these little animals." <HI>Dissert. de generatione et metamorphibus Insectorum Surinamensis.</HI></P></NOTE> was greatly discredited, though Dr. Grew had related some surprising particulars of a specimen of it
<PB REF="49"/>from Peru<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cucujus Peruvianus.
<P>"That which, beside the figure of the head, is most wonderful in this insect, is the shining property of the same part, whereby it looks in the night like a lantern, so that, two or three of these fastened to a slick, or otherwise conveniently disposed of, will give sufficient light to those who travel or walk in the night" <HI>Grew.

It is admitted, that the <HI>Chinese Fulgora</HI> has an illuminated appearance in the night. "The foreheads of many Fulgorae (especially those found in China) emit a lively shining light in the night time, which, according to some authors, is sufficient to read by."— <HI>Yeats</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Yeats. Institutions of Entomology.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The light of the Fulgorae is generally imagined to issue from the trunk, or elongated projection of the forehead; but Roesel offers a conjecture on the light of the Fulgora Lanternaria, which, on further inves∣tigation, may enable naturalists to determine whether the light is entirely produced by an innate property of the trunk, or receives additional splendour from some external cause. He notices a white farinaceous substance on several parts of the wings and body, as well as the trunk, which, he observes, looks like the decayed wood which shines at night. We mention this conjecture of Roesel, though the same occurred to us before we perused his observations. We have invariably found a similar white powder on other insects of this genus, but usually upon the trunk only. The remarks of Roesel were necessarily very limited, two species of the Fulgorae only being then known. We possess twelve distinct species, and have made dissections and observations on several others; from all which we are inclined to imagine, that the white powder has a phosphoric appearance in the living insect, and increases the light, when the end of the trunk is illu∣minated.</P>
<P>One of the Fulgorae of considerable magnitude, from the interior of India, enabled us to make many observations, The trunk is of the same form as that of the <HI>Fulgora Candelaria.</HI> The colour is a dark but beautiful purple: the apex scarlet, of a perfectly pellucid appearance, and still retains a reddish glare. The spots of while, sprinkled on the purple colour of the trunk, exhibit also a slight appear∣ance of phosphoric matter. On the trunk of the Fulgora Candelaria these white spots are very conspi∣cuous.</P>
<P>Though the generic name Fulgora seems to imply some effulgent property in the insects that compose the genus, it is uncertain whether all possess that property. They are indeed furnished with a trunk, but it is smaller in proportion, in several species, than in F. Lanternaria, Candelaria, Flammea, Phospho∣rea,
<PB REF="50"/>and some others. It has not been determined whether any of the European Fulgorae shine in the night time. The genus is very limited, including the discoveries of modern naturalists. Fabricius de∣scribes only twenty-five species; of these, seven are European, and eighteen extra-European. Two species are found in England.</P>
<P>Chrysanthemum Indicum.—Indian Chrysanthemum.</P>
<P>This is a very lately introduced species in England. It is mentioned by Sir G. Staunton among the plants collected in the provinces of <HI>Shan-tung</HI> and <HI>Kiang-nan.</HI> Thunberg describes it as a native of Japan in the <HI>Flora Japonica.</HI> A variety of it is figured in the <HI>Hortus Malabaricus;</HI> and in the <HI>Herbarium Amboinense</HI> is another. We observe a great dissimilarity between the figures of this plant in different works. That figured in the <HI>Herb. Amb.</HI> has very small flowers, scarcely broader than our large daisy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chrysanthemum Leucanthemum.</NOTE>: the leaves in clus∣ters, some very large, and others small. In the <HI>Hort. Malab.</HI> the flowers are twice the size of the former, and the leaves are placed much asunder. The flowers of our specimen are considerably larger than either of these; yet not of the magnitude represented in the plate of Mr. Curtiss Botanical Magazine.</P>
<P>This Chrysanthemum is not peculiar to China, though it has been long cultivated in that country. It grows spontaneously in some parts of Japan; and from the name it bears in the Arabic, Persic, and other languages, is probably known in most parts of Asia.</P>

<P>Though the observations that Sir G. Staunton has made on the natural production of China, in his late publication, were necessarily very general, the science of insects appears to have engaged his particular attention; and on that account we must lament, that untoward events, precluded him from observing more minutely, the peculiarities of some kinds, and the economical purposes of others.</P>
<P>In the general histories of unknown countries, (and we can scarcely consider China in any other view) the entomologist musf expect to find his favourite science neglected, or treated in a manner more likely to excite curiosity than reward enquiry. The work of this learned writer is an exception to our remark; though a few inaccuracies occur in it. We peruse the following account of an unknown species of Cicada with particular regret, because, it withholds information interesting to the naturalist, and, from its air of novelty, is likely to promote an erroneous opinion concerning that singular tribe of insects.</P>
<P>"The low and sometimes marshy country, through which the river<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pei-ho.</NOTE> passes, is favourable to the pro∣duction of insects; and many of them were troublesome, some principally by their sting; and others by their constant stunning noise. The music emitted by <HI>a species of Cicada</HI> was not of the vocal kind; but produced by the motion of two flaps or lamellae which cover the abdomen or belly of the insect. It is the signal of invitation from the male of <HI>that species</HI> to allure the female, which latter is quite unprovided with these organs of courtship<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chap. 3. Vol. II. octavo.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Again, when deseribing a town higher up the river, that author says, "The shops of Hai-tien, in addi∣tion to necessaries, abounded in toys and trifles, calculated to amuse the rich and idle of both sexes, even to cages containing insects, such as the <HI>noisy Cicada,</HI> and a large species of the Gryllus<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Chap. 4. Vol. II.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The reader may imagine from the first account, that the music of every other species of Cicada is of the vocal kind, or that it is peculiar to this Chinese insect to be furnished with lamellae that cause a sound. The latter account confirms such conjecture, by alluding in a specific manner to the <HI>noisy Cicada,</HI> as to an insect described in a former part of the work. We must remark, that not only the males of the species mentioned by that author, are furnished with those lamellae, but the whole of that section of the Linnaean Cicadae which Fabricius has called Tettiogonia<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">This includes all the larger species of Linnaean Cicadae, such as <HI>C. Orni, Tibicien, reticulata, haematodes, stridula,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. for in some editions of the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus we find <HI>Cicada Noctilucae,</HI> which in later editions are the <HI>Fulgorae,</HI> and also the <HI>C. cruciatae, mannifera, spumantes</HI> and <HI>deflexae</HI> included in one genus.</NOTE>. The males of the species included in the other sections of that genus are certainly furnished with them also; though some of them are too minute to be observed without a glass. These lamellae vary in size in different species; but the accounts we have of them from travellers in foreign countries, and naturalists both ancient and modern, prove they all emit a certain sound to allure the female. As we are unable to ascertain the Chinese species Sir George mentions, neither figure or description accompanying his account of it, we must therefore, speak generally of the whole genus, and then confine our remarks to those species we are acquainted with from China. Among these are C. <HI>spendidula, sanguinea,</HI> and <HI>atrata.</HI> The latter, we believe, is the largest species of the Chinese Ci∣cadae known in Europe.</P>
<P>Some species of this tribe were known to the ancients. With them it was the emblem of happiness and eternal youth<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Probably because it was supposed to live only a short time. The renewal of youth is illustrated by the story of the Tithonus transformed by Aurora into a Cicada.</NOTE>; and if we examine the legends of pagan mythology, we find they were deemed a race of creatures beloved by gods<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><L><HI>Phaebus</HI> is thy sire divine;</L>

<P>This singular insect, and the plant on which it is represented, have an equal claim to attention, both as objects of natural curiosity, and importance in domestic economy.

<HEAD>De la Cire Blanche, Faite par des insectes, et nommée Tchang pe la, c'est-a-dire, Cire blanche d'insectes.</HEAD>
<P>Ki <HI>dit.</HI> La Cire blanche dont il s'agit ici, n'est pas la même que la cire blanche des Abeilles. Ce sont de petits insectes qui la forment. Ces insectes succent le suc de l'espéce d'arbres nommée <HI>Tong tçin,</HI> et à le longue ils le changent en une forte de graisse blanche, qu'ils attachent aux branches de l'arbre.</P>
<P>Il y en a qui disent que c'est la fiente de ces insectes, qui s'attachant à l'arbre, forme cette Cire, mais ils se trompent. On la tire en raclant les branches dans la saison de l'Automne; on la fait fondre sur le feu, et l'ayant passée, on la verse dans l'eau froide ougrave; elle se fige, et se forme en pains. Quand on l'a rompuë, on voit dans les morceaux brisez, des veines comme dans la pierre blanche ou congélation nommée Pe che cao; elle est polie et brilliante: on la mêle avec de l'huile, et on en fait des chandelles. Elle est beaucoup superiéure à celles que font les Abeilles.</P>
<P><HI>Chi tchin</HI> dit. Ce n'est que sous la Dynastie des <HI>Yuen</HI> qu'on a commencé à connoître la cire formée par ces insectes. L'usage en est devenu fort commun, soit dans la médecine, soit pour faire des bougies. Il s'en trouve dans les Provinces de <HI>Se tchuen,</HI> de <HI>Hou quang,</HI> de <HI>Yunnan,</HI> de <HI>Fo kien,</HI> de <HI>Tche kiang,</HI> de <HI>Kiang nan,</HI> et genéralement dans tous les quartiers du Sud-Est.

<P>L'arbre qui porte cette cire, a les branches, et les feüilles semblables à celles du <HI>Tong çin.</HI> Il conserve sa verdure durant toutes les saisons : Il pousse des fleurs-blanches en bouquets durant la cinquiéme Lune; il porte des fruits en bayes, gros comme le fruit du <HI>Kin</HI> rampant.</P>
<P>Quand ils ne sont pas mûrs, ils sont de couleur verte; et ils deviennent noirâtres, lorsqu'ils mûrissent, au lieu que le fruit de <HI>Tong çin</HI> est rouge. Les insectes que s'y attachent sont fort petits. Quand le soleil parcourt les quinze derniers dégrez des Gemeaux, ils se répandent en grimpant sur les branches de l'arbre; ils en tirent le sue, et jettent par la bouche une certaine bave, qui s'attachant aux branches encore tendres, se changent en une graise blanche, laquelle se durcit, et prend la forme de cire. On diroit que c'est de la gelée blanche que le froid a durcie.</P>
<P>Quand le soleil parcourt les quinze premiers dégrez du Signe de la Vierge, on fait la récolte de la Cire, en l'enlevant de dessus les branches. Si l'on différe à la cuëillir que le Soleil ait entiérement parcouru ce Signe, il est difficile de la detacher, même en la raclant.</P>
<P>Ces insectes sont blanes quand ils sont jeunes, et c'est alors qu'ils sont leur cire. Quands ils deviennent vieux, ils sont d'un châtain qui tire sur le noir, C'est alors que formant de petit pelotons, ils s'attachent aux branches de l'arbre. Ces pelotons sont au commencement de la grosseur d'un grain de mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vers l'entrée du printemps ils commencement a grossir et à s'étendre. Ils sont attachez anx branches de l'arbre en forme de grapes, et à les voir, on diroit que l'arbre est chargé de fruits. Quand ils font fur le point de mettre bas leurs oeufs, ils font leur nid de même que les chenilles. Chacun de ce nids ou pelotons contient plusieurs centaines de petits oeufs blancs.</P>
<P>Dans le tems que le soleil parcourt la seconde moitié du Taureau on les cüeille, et les ayant enveloppez dans des feüilles de <HI>Yo</HI> (espece de simple à larges feüilles;) on les suspend à différens arbres. Après que le Soleil est forti du Signe de Gemaux, ces pelotons souvrent, et les oeufs produisent des insectes, qui sortant les uns après les autres des feüilles dont ils font enveloppez, montent fur larbre où ils font ensuite leur cire.</P>
<P>On doit avoir soin dentretenir le dessous de larbre toûjours propre, et de le garentir des fourmis qui mangent ces insectes. On voit deux autres arbres ausquels on peut attacher les insectes, et qui porteront également de la cire; lun qui se nomme <HI>Tien tchu,</HI> et lautre qui est un espéce darbre aquatique, dont les feüilles resemblent affez à celles du Tillcul.</P>

</TEXT></Q></NOTE><HI>&amp; l'arbre qui porte le suif.</HI> His relations are, perhaps, too prolix, but they are evidently the result of attentive observation, and serve to illustrate the Natural History, and economical purposes, of the subjects we are noticing: they are briefly these. The white wax of China is called <HI>Tchang pe la;</HI> it is not the same as the white wax of bees, but is the produce of a sort of insect that feeds on a tree called <HI>Tong tçin:</HI> these insects form a kind of white grease which attaches to the branches of the tree, hardens, and becomes wax. It is scraped from the branches of the trees in autumn, melted on the fire, strained; then poured into cold water, where it coagulates and forms itself into cakes. This wax is very white and glossy; it is mixed with oil and made into candles, and is much superior to the wax of bees for that purpose.</P>
<P><PB REF="61"/><HI>Chi tchin,</HI> a Chinese writer, says, it was not till the dynasty of <HI>Yuen</HI> that the wax made by these insects began to be known; the custom then became very general to employ it both in medicine and making candles. Its medicinal virtues are highly extolled by the Chinese physicians, and particularly by <HI>Tchi hen.</HI> It is said to be a drug absolutely necessary to surgeons, that it makes the flesh close, stops bleeding, appeases pain, unites the nerves, rejoints the bones, and taken in pills, kills the worms that occasion consumptions. It is found in most of the south-east provinces of China; but the best is brought from <HI>Sc tchuen</HI> and <HI>Yunnan,</HI> and from the territories of <HI>Hen tcheou,</HI> and <HI>Yung tcheou.</HI></P>
<P>These insects are white when young, and it is then they make their wax. When old, they are of a blackish chesnut colour, and form little pelotons on the branches of trees. These pelotons, at first, are about the size of a grain of millet; towards the beginning of the spring they increase in bulk and spread; they are attached to the branches like grapes, and at first sight, the trees that bear them, appear loaded with fruit. About the beginning of May, they gather them, and having enveloped them in the leaves of <HI>Yo</HI> (a species of broad-leaved grass), they are suspended to the trees. At the end of June, and in July, the pelotons open, and the insects come forth, crawl about the leaves, and form their wax.</P>
<P>Sir G. Staunton, in his learned work, has also described the Wax insect; he found it at Turon Bay, in Cochin China, and has caused it to be represented in a vignette plate, with the following description. "Among other objects of natural curiosity, accident led to the observation of some swarms of uncommon
<PB REF="62"/>insects busily employed upon small branches of a shrub, then neither in fruit or flower, but in its general habit bearing somewhat the appearance of a privet. These insects, each not much exceeding the size of the domestic fly, were of a curious structure, having pectinated appendages rising in a curve, bending to∣wards the head, not unlike the form of the tail feathers of the common fowl, but in the opposite direction. Every part of the insect was, in colour, of a perfect white, or at least completely covered with a white powder. The particular stem frequented by those insects, was entirely whitened by a substance or powder of that colour, strewed upon it by them. The substance or powder was supposed to form the white wax of the East. This substance is asserted, on the spot, to have the property, by a particular manipulation, of giving in certain proportions, with vegetable oil, such solidity to the composition as to render the whole equally capable of being moulded into candles. The fact is ascertained, indeed, in some degree, by the simple experiment of dissolving one part of this wax in three parts of olive oil made hot. The whole, when cold, will coagulate into a mass, approaching to the firmness of bees wax."</P>
<P>From the accurate description and figures of the latter author, it is evident, the creature that produces the white wax of China, is an imperfect insect, or, technically speaking, the pupa of an insect, which, in its mature state, is furnished with wings. This is clearly the fact, for the rudiments of wings are visible in the figures alluded to<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">This may account for a passage in <HI>Gordon</HI>'s description of China, where he says, "In the plains" of Houquang "are vast numbers of little <HI>worms</HI> that produce wax, in the same manner as bees do honey," if we understand by <HI>worms,</HI> insects not arrived at maturity; for the larva of Bombyx Mori, is also termed a silk worm, though it belongs to the moth tribe when perfect.</NOTE>. The metamorphose of insects are so various, and their appearance so changed in passing from one state to another, that the identity of any species in the larva or pupa can only be proved by actual observation; neither do the larva or pupa possess those characteristic differences by which naturalists determine one species from another; and this consideration deters us from deciding on the precise species, to which the pupa before us should be referred.</P>
<P>STOHL, a Dutch author, has been more fortunate; he has ascertained this identical creature to be the pupa of Cicada Limbata, and in his work on <HI>Cimices</HI> and <HI>Cicades,</HI> gives a figure of it under the title of <HI>De Waldraagster</HI> (Nymphe) or <HI>La Cigale Porte Laine,</HI> fig. 144, together with the winged insect at fig. 145; and it is on this authority Cicada Limbata is introduced in the annexed plate.</P>
<P>We are strongly inclined to credit the accuracy of Stohl in this instance; there is much similarity be∣tween the pupa and the cicada, and some striking characteristics are common to both. They agree in the structure of the antennae, and proboscis, or sucking trunk; the abdomen of the winged insect is also loaded with a fine white powder, and is furnished at the extremity with a tuft of down and hairs, similar to that so eminently conspicuous in the pupa state. We have, however, observed the white powder, and tuft on the abdomen of Cicada lanata, and have reason to imagine it also forms a white wax, similar to that of the present species.</P>
<P><PB REF="63"/>The Cicada limbata is of a light green colour, with a red margin; that which Stohl has figured is of a pale brown, with a black margin. These are the <HI>species</HI> and <HI>variety</HI> Fabricius describes, for the specimens he refers to, in the collection of Sir Joseph Banks, agree precisely with our insects. Fabricius notes the <HI>habitat</HI> Africa. Stohl received the green specimen from the Island of Ceylon; the pale sort from Africa. The larva we have represented is from China; and the Cicada was brought from the East Indies, by the late Mr. Ellis.</P>
<P><HI>Croton Sebiferum—Poplar-leaved Croton, or Tallow-tree.</HI></P>
<P>The Tallow-tree is not the natural food of the Wax insect, but as they mutually illustrate the same in∣quiry, they are represented in the same plate; and it is further presumed, that a short account of this use∣ful plant, will be deemed a proper sequel to the history of the insect.</P>
<P>Du Halde, when describing the Tallow-tree, says, "Il est de la hauteur d'une grande cerifier. Le fruit est renfermée dans un écorce qu'on appelle <HI>Yen Kiou,</HI> et qui s'ouvre par le milieu quand il est mûr, comme celle de la châtaigne. Il consiste en des grains blancs de la grosseur d'un noisette, dont la chair a les qualitez du suif; aussi en fait-on des chandelles, après l'avoir fait fondre, en y mêlant souvent un pen d'huile ordinaire, et trempant les chandelles dans la cire qui vient fur l'arbre dont je vais parler: il s'en forme autour du suif une espéce de croûte qui l'empêche de couler<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">"It is of the height of a large cherry-tree; the fruit is inclosed in a shell, called <HI>Yen Kiou,</HI> which, when ripe, opens in the middle like the chesnut. The fruit consists of white kernels of the size of a small, or hazel nut, whose substance has all the qualities of tallow; so that they make candles of it, after having melted and mixed it with a small portion of common oil, and then dipping the candles into the wax before mentioned, it forms a kind of crust round the tallow that prevents its run∣ning, or wasting.</NOTE>. Page 18. Vol. I.</P>
<P>Sir G. Staunton speaks nearly to the same effect: "From the fruit of the <HI>Croton sebiferum,</HI> of Lin∣naeus, the Chinese obtain a kind of vegetable fat, with which they make a great proportion of their candles. This fruit, in its external appearance, bears some resemblance to the berries of the ivy. As soon as it is ripe, the capsule opens and divides into two, or, more frequently, three divisions, and falling off, discovers as many kernels, each attached by a separate foot-stalk, and covered with a fleshy substance of a snowy whiteness, contrasting beautifully with the leaves of the tree, which, at this season, are of a tint between a purple and a scarlet. The fat, or fleshy substance, is separated from the kernels by crushing and boiling them in water. The candles made of this fat are firmer than those of tallow, as well as free
<PB REF="64"/>from all offensive odour. They are not, however, equal to those of wax or spermaceti." This author further adds, "The wax for candles, is generally the produce of insects, feeding chiefly on the privet, as is mentioned in the chapter of Cochin China. It is naturally white, and so pure as to produce no smoke; but is collected in such small quantities, as to be scarce and dear. Cheap candles are also made of tal∣low, and even of grease of too little consistence to be used, without the contrivance of being coated with the firmer substance of the tallow-tree or of wax." <HI>Vide Chapter on Sou-choo foo.</HI></P>
<P>The tallow-tree is now cultivated in the West Indies, where it thrives well, and produces fruit, and by proper attention may hereafter become useful.</P>
<P><PB REF="65"/>In the infant state of music, men, seem to have preferred the natural sounds of some animals, to those of their uncouth instruments. We cannot otherwise account for the extravagant praise, bestowed on the noise of this little creature. It is true, authors agree that the sounds of some kinds are exceeding loud and harmonious, and in the early ages of the world these might have a powerful influence on the human mind. It is related that the <HI>ancient Locri,</HI> a people of Greece, were so charmed with the song of the Cicada, that they erected a statue to its honour<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Some say that once a certain player of <HI>Locri,</HI> contesting in the art of music with another, would have lost the victory, by the breaking of two strings of his instrument; but a <HI>Cicada</HI> flew to his aid, and resting on the broken instrument, sung so well, that the Locrian was de∣clared victor. The Locrians erected a statue to the Cicada as a testimony of their gratitude. It represented the player with the insect on his instrument.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ancients had attentively observed the manners of its life, though they indulged in many poetical fictions concerning it; and particularly, when they affirmed that it subsisted on dew. They have told us that it lives among trees<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Martyn</HI> supposed this refers to the smaller branches in hedges, rather than to the lofty trees in forests: we cannot entirely coin∣cide with that opinion.</NOTE>, which circumstance discountenances the opinion of those moderns, who imagine the grashoppers<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><HI>Grashopper. Cicada.</HI> They live almost every where in hot countries. <HI>Lovel. Hist. Animal.</HI> containing the summe of all authors ancient and modern, <HI>p.</HI> 274, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>
<P><HI>Cicada,</HI> a Sauterelle,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sauterelle,</HI> forte d'insecte. A locust or grashopper. <HI>Boyer.—Cigale,</HI> a flying insect. The Cicada of the ancients, unknown in England. <HI>Boyer.</HI></NOTE> or, according to others, a <HI>balm cricket.</HI>—Non est quod vulgò, a <HI>grashopper,</HI> vocamus; fed insectum longè diversum, corpore et rotundiore et breviore, qui arbusculis insidet et sonum quadruplo majorum edit. a <HI>grashopper,</HI> rectè <HI>locustum</HI> reddideris, <HI>Morl</HI> ex <HI>Ray. Ainsworth.</HI></P></NOTE> were the Cicadae of the ancients.</P>
<P>Neither were they ignorant that the males only were furnished with those instruments which externally appear to produce its sound, or the purpose for which that sound was emitted<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Xenarchus, an old Grecian play-writer, used to fay jocosely that "the Cicadae were very happy because they had silent wives." Aristotle also knew the sexual difference of them; he mentions them as a delicious food: he preferred the males when young, but more so the females before she laid her eggs.</NOTE>; though it was reserved for more accurate naturalists to discover the complex organs by which it was caused and modulated. Aldrovandus, near two centuries ago, described the lamellae, which he compares to the fruit of some herbs, called by modern botanists <HI>Thlaspi</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Thalaspi parvum Hieraciifolium, sive Lunariam luteam Monspel. et Leucoium luteum marinum. <HI>Lobel. Stirpium Adversaria nova, p.</HI> 74.—<HI>Aldrov.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among later naturalists who have noticed the Cicadae of foreign countries are Merian<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Merian. Insecta Surinamensia.</NOTE>, Margravius<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Georgi Margravii rer. nat. Brasiliae. <HI>Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>p.</HI> 257.</NOTE>, &amp;c. Merian says, its tune resembles the sound of a lyre, which is heard at a distance; and that the Dutch in the
<PB REF="66"/>plantations of Surinam (where they are very plenty) call it the Lyre-playr<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">De Lierman.</NOTE>. Margravius, in his natural history of Brasil, compares it to the sound of a vibrating wire: he says the tune begins with <HI>Gir, guir,</HI> and continues with <HI>Sis, sis, sis.</HI> One species is called Kakkerlak<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>Scopoli carn.</HI> Yeats describes the Kakkerlak of the American islands as a species of <HI>Blatta,</HI> cock-roaches. Are there not two insects of that name?—one of them is, we believe, a <HI>Blatta.</HI></NOTE> in the Indies, perhaps because the sound emitted by it may be likened to the pronunciation of that word. Mr. Abbot, an accurate observer and collector of natural history in <HI>North America,</HI> has discovered four new species of Cicada, one of them nearly equal in size to our Cicada Atrata. This, he says, was found in great abundance one season, in some swampy grounds near Susquehanna river, and was remarkable on account of their loud noise, which at a little distance resembled the ringing of <HI>horse-bells.</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Communicated by Mr. Abbot in North America to Mr. Francillon in London.</NOTE></P>
<P>Some naturalists have supposed that the sound of the Cicada, is caused by the flapping of the lamellae against the abdomen; and others, that it is only a noise occasioned by the rustling of the segments of the body in the contractile motion of that part. Beckman<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><HI>Roes. Insecten Bellustigung.</HI>—CHRISTIANI BECKMANNI, Bornensis, manuductionem ad latinam linguam: nec non de originibus latinae linguae, &amp;c.</NOTE> imagines it is caused by beating the body and legs against the wings: he has endeavoured to explain the meaning of ancient authors, and deduce its etymology from that circumstance.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">It is the common opinion that the word <HI>Cicada</HI> has its origin from <HI>quod cito cadat,</HI> which, after a general interpretation, implies that the Cicadae <HI>soon vanish,</HI> or are <HI>short-lived.</HI> Beckman maintains that this opinion is absurd, and proves that its name is derived from singing, because <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies a sound produced by the motion of a little skin; and that <HI>ciccum</HI> or <HI>cicum</HI> is a thin little skin of a pome∣granate, that parts the kernels.—Beckman not knowing the insect, or not imagining that the <HI>little skin</HI> was an appendage to the abdomen, concluded it must mean the transparent wings, and consequently that the sound was produced by beating them against the body: but this interpretation, if applied to the lamellae instead of the wings, will directly prove the origin of its name, and knowledge of the an∣cients.</NOTE></P>
<P>Reaumur and Roesel have dissected several of the Cicadae, and discovered that the lamellae cannot have that free motion necessary to cause such a sound; but that it is produced by some internal organs of the insect, and only issues through the opening, concealed under the lamellae, as through the mouth of a mu∣sical instrument<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">For the satisfaction of the curious reader, we detail the most interesting particulars concerning the organization of these parts from <HI>Reaumur's Histoire des Insectes,</HI> and <HI>Roesel's Verschiedene auslaendische sorten von Cicaden, &amp;c.</HI>
<P>The music of the Cicada is not caused by the motion of the <HI>lamellae,</HI> as some have supposed. Reaumur observes, that although the <HI>lamellae</HI> have a kind of moveable hinge, they have also a stiff and pointed tooth, or spine, that prevents them from being listed far back; and, if strained, are very liable to be broken.</P>
<P>From the anatomical description of Roesel, we find that, within the two hollows that are seen when the lamellae are listed up, two very smooth skins are visible; these are highly polished, of nearly a semicircular shape, and reslect prismatic colours: there is between those a hard brown projection, or corner which unites with another piece above them in a longitudinal direction, to the under part of the breast. This longitudinal piece divides a triangular red space or field into two parts, one on the right side, and the other on the left. Above these, in a transverse direction, is seen two small yellow skins; the lamellae in their natural position conceal these organs because they fold exactly over them.</P>
<P>Reaumur, in the exterior appearance of these parts, could discover nothing that could lead to determine the organs of the sound; and he was not satisfied that the slight motion of the lamellae on these parts could produce the loud singing noise of the Cicada. He opened a few cicadae on the back part of the body, so that the inner structure of the under side was displayed, and especially the parts connected to the curious organs he had discovered under the lamellae. At last he discovered two large muscles, which at their point of union formed a space almost square, and were connected with the red triangular fields he had observed on the under side: as he concluded these formed a material part of the organs he wished to discover, he examined them attentively, and found that, by moving them backwards and forwards, he could make a cicada sing that had been dead many months. Although the sound was not strong, it tended to prove that he had discovered the instrument that produced it.—In another part he says it is evident the sound is caused by the little skins connected to the muscles, because when they were rubbed: with a bit of paper they emitted that kind of sound.</P>
<P>Roesel has discovered two little pieces of horny substance that arc connected by a sort of fibre within the skins, in the body, and he supposes when this is in motion, it strikes against the before-mentioned thin skins, and produces a sound, by the same means as a hollow body, or drum, when struck with a stick: and also that this noise may be varied or modulated by a slight motion of the lamellae, but cannot be produced without the assistance of the internal nerves and muscles connected with the organs first described.</P>
<P>Authors agree that the Cicadae of hot countries emit the loudest sound. It appears from the papers of Mr. Smeethman (who resided it considerable time in Africa) published by Mr. Drury, that the sound of some kinds peculiar to that part of the world is so loud as to be heard at half a mile distance; and that the singing of one within doors, silences a whole company.— The same attentive observer says, the open parts of the country are never without their music, some singing in the evening and others only in the day.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The suppositions of these authors seem well founded; we have examined many species that were un∣known to them, and find the spine before mentioned, so placed in many insects, as to prevent the motion
<PB REF="67"/>of the lamellae. We have a specimen from America, which, in addition to the usual organs of sound, have two large hollow protuberances or drums; one on each side of the abdomen; and must, we imagine, produce a louder sound than any yet discovered: a species very similar to this is also brought from New Holland.</P>
<P>The proboscis of those insects is a hard or horny tube, in which a very acute; slender sucking-pipe is con∣cealed. The horny tube is not unlike a gimlet in form, and is used by those creatures to bore through the bark of trees, to extract the juices, on which it feeds. Linnaeus has named the species of one division in his System, <HI>Mannifera,</HI> because they had been observed to fly among ash trees, bore many holes in them, and when the manna had oozed out, return and carry it off.</P>
<P>With this proboscis they bore holes in the small twigs of the extreme branches of trees, and deposit their eggs in them, sometimes to the amount of six or seven hundred. As each cell contains no more than from twelve to twenty eggs, it does great damage to the trees they frequent. Stohl says, "the common one<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Lu Cigale Vicilleuse. Cicad. Tibicien.</NOTE>, which is sound at Surinam in the coffee plantations, greatly injures those trees; the females deposit∣ing their eggs in the young shoots, and in holes they bore with their sheath. They live on the juices of the trees."</P>
<P><PB REF="68"/>M. Merian gives a figure and account of the metamorphose of a cicada found in Surinam. She has mistaken the winged insect to be only the pupa of the <HI>Fulgora Lanternaria,</HI> which is too absurd to deserve contradiction; in other respects her account is interesting, and particularly that part which relates to the pupa state, or chafer, as it is termed. "The pomegranate tree," says Merian, "so well known in all other countries, grows also in the fields of Surinam. On them I have found a species of chafer, which is naturally very lazy, and consequently very easy to be caught. It carries underneath the head a long trunk, with which it easily penetrates the flowers, in order to extract the honey from them. On the 20th of May, when they were laying quite quiet, the skin of the back burst open, and green flies, with transparent wings, issued from them. These flies are found in abundance in Surinam, and have such a rapid flight, that it took me many hours to catch one."</P>
<P>The pupa we received from China with our Cicada atrata, very much resembles that figured by Merian. It has the long sucking trunk or proboscis; but the most formidable of its weapons seem to be the fore feet, which are thick, strong, and armed with spines or teeth; with these it may do more injury to the plants, by tearing off the tender shoots, than by wounding the trunk to extract the moisture.</P>
<P>We have represented the upper and under side of a male of this interesting species, Cicada atrata, not only to illustrate our preceding remarks, but because we believe no figure has been given of it by any author, unless <HI>De Zwarte Chineesche cicade</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">La Cigale Chinoise noire, pres de Canton en Chine. Cab. de Mons. <HI>L.F. Holthusen, pl.</HI> 20. <HI>fig.</HI> 118.</NOTE> of Stohl is intended for this insect. The Fabrician description has no synonyms.</P>
<P>The general appearance of both sexes of Cicada atrata is very similar, except that the female is fur∣nished with a sheath, and the male with lamellae. The sheath of the female is partly concealed within a valve at the extremity of the abdomen, and is only protruded when the creature lays her eggs. In the figure of the under surface of a male insect, exhibited in the annexed plate, the lamellae are distinguished by two stars: the single star denotes the situation of the spine, mentioned by Roesel and Reaumur.</P>
<P><HI>Laurus Camphora.—Camphor-tree.</HI></P>
<P>The tree which produces the useful drug <HI>camphor</HI> is very abundant in Japan and China. Sir G. Staunton says it is the only species of the laurel genus growing in China, where it is a large and valuable timber, and is never cut up for the sake of the drug; but that substance is obtained by decocting the small branches, twigs, and leaves, and subliming the camphor in luted earthen vessels. A purer sort is brought from the island of Borneo and Japan, which is supposed to be a natural exudation from the tree when the bark is wounded. Sir G. Staunton says the Camphor-tree is felled in those countries for the sole purpose of finding the drug in substance among the splinters.</P>

<P>M. Merian has given a plate and description of this species in her work on the Insects of Surinaim. We learn from that account, that in the larva and pupa state it lives in the water; that it is a voracious creature, and feeds not only on the weaker kinds of aquatic insects, but on some animals much larger than itself.

<P>Insects in general discover an extraordinary degree of care, and ingenuity, in depositing their eggs in the most secure situations, or places where the infant brood, when hatched, may be provided with proper sustenance. Those of the aquatic kind usually lay them in recesses in the mud or sand, or under loose stones that lie at the bottom of the water: others, with as much care, and more ingenuity, hollow out the interior substance of the large stalks of water plants, and deposit their eggs in them; or, rising out of the water, lay them in the extreme branches of those plants, to secure them from other aquatic depredators. The Nepa rustica displays even more sagacity, or attachment for its eggs, than those creatures; for it never leaves them. Till they are hatched, it bears them on its back, in a cluster of an oval shape; these eggs are of an oblong form, and are fastened by the narrowest end to a thin film, or plate of cement, that causes them to adhere to the polished surface of the wing cases; when these eggs, about an hundred in number, are hatched, it casts off the exuviae of the cluster, and differs no longer in general appearance from the male of the same species.</P>
<P>Our figures represent the situation of the eggs on the back, and the insect also after they are cast off. It is not commonly received with the eggs upon it. Found on the coast of Coromandel, as well as China.</P>

<P>This curious insect is among the number of those lately brought from China. A figure of the upper surface is represented on a leaf of the <HI>Camellia Sesanqua,</HI> one of the vignette plates of Sir G. Staunton's History of the late Embassy to that country; a coloured figure and a short account of it may therefore prove acceptable to the readers of his volumes.</P>
<P>Professor Thunberg of Upsal discovered this insect in his travels in Japan, and described it among his <HI>new species</HI> under the name Cimex Ocellatus. Stoll, in a work recently publised on Cimices, has also given a figure of it: he has likewise represented another sort, which he considers as the female <HI>(letter A);</HI> it has no black points in the yellow spots of the thorax and scutellum: he mentions the Isle of Formosa as the native country of his specimens.</P>
<P>Fabricius has rejected the specific name <HI>Ocellatus,</HI> which was given by Thunberg, and has called it Dispar: he has added a very minute account of its characteristic marks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>We have represented the insect in a flying position, to display the singular wings, that are concealed under the scutellum when it is at rest. The other figure, distinguished also by a star, exhibits the under side of the insect, which for variety and beauty of colours is not less interesting than the upper surface.</P>

<P>The simile proposed by Linnaeus for the arrangement of Butterflies, is gleaned from ancient and fabulous history. The species are divided into sections of Trojan and Greek princes, heroes, deities, nymphs, and plebeians: this allegorical system, which is well conducted, seems liable to less objection, than the cha∣racters assigned to each section: for many species placed among the Equites, and a more considerable num∣ber with the Plebeii, are inconsistent with the essential criterion Linnaeus has given. This arrangement has undergone some material alterations in the <HI>Entomologia Systematica</HI> of Fabricius; alterations, perhaps justified, by the comprehensive view, its author has taken of this pleasing branch of Entomology. The Equites, with many additions, and a few exceptions, are the same as those in the two Linnaean sections: Papilio Priamus, is however, removed from the head of the <HI>Equites Trojani,</HI> and the precedence given to Papilio Paris.</P>
<P>Papilio Paris is an insect of considerable beauty. The general colour on the upper surface obscure brown, nearly approaching black, but finely contrasted with brilliant green atoms, that are profusely sprinkled over it. The posterior wings are adorned with a large blue spot, which derives additional lustre from the dusky colour surrounding it. Another species, very similar to Papilio Paris, but without this spot, is also found in China. It is the supposed female of our species.

<P>The singular delicacy and beauty of this Papilio is not the only claim it has to the particular attention of Entomologists: it is clearly an undescribed species; and perhaps the only specimen of it yet brought to Europe, is that from which our figure is copied.

<DIV4 TYPE="description">
<P>Most naturalists are undetermined whether Papilio Menelaus and the supposed variety, Papilio Rhetenor, should not be considered distinct species. The colour of the upper side is nearly the same in both insects; but the under sides are very different. The Linnaean description of the male, P. Menelaus, agrees with Papilio Rhetenor, and probably he considered them the two sexes of one insect. Fabricius would certainly have made a new species of it, if he had not been of the same opinion. We have both insects before us, and should most assuredly make a new species of P. Rhetenor, as Cramer and Sulzer have done, if the authority of the last work of Fabricius were not opposed to us.</P>
<P>Papilio Menelaus is a native of South America. Sulzer's specimen of Papilio Rhetenor came from China. Foreign Entomologists, for this and other reasons, have considered them distinct species. The curious in insects, says Cramer, call this butterfly <HI>Le Satiré bleu oblong,</HI> to distinguish it from P. Menclaus, or <HI>Le Satiné bleu vulgaire.</HI>—Cramer has also given a third and much smaller kind of these blue butterflies, <HI>Pap. Adonis,</HI> which Fabricius also considers a variety of Menclaus.</P>
<P>Whatever effect the artist can produce by a combination of the most brilliant colours employed in painting, he must shrink from comparison of it with this splendid creature. It is impossible to find in any part of the animal creation colours more beautiful or changeable. Pale blue is the principal colour, but new tints meet the eye in every direction, varying from a silvery green to the deepest purple; and the whole surface glittering with the resplendence of highly polished metal.</P>
<P><PB REF="94"/><HI>Thea Laxa.—Bohea, or broad-leaved Tea.</HI></P>
<P>Sir G. Staunton says the bohea tea is supplied in China from the province of Fochen: the green tea from Kiang-nan. The leaves of these teas vary in some degree in form according to the age of the plant; those of the bohea are the broadest; Thea stricta has much longer leaves, they are lanceolated, and more deeply serrated than those of the bohea. Many authors have considered them varieties of the same species. —Flowers in England in August and September.</P>

<P>The number of Chinese species of this genus, already described, is very limited: our present insect is the largest of them; but, as this is inferior in size to several kinds found in Europe, we conceive there must remain many larger species of the genus unknown to collectors of foreign insects, and yet very com∣mon in China. In the latter part of Sir G. Staunton's work, that author mentions the larva of a <HI>Sphinx Moth</HI> which furnish an article for the table of the Chinese. We regret that the indefinite expression can∣not not assist us to determine the species, and scarcely the genus, of the insect alluded to<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">European naturalists are entirely ignorant of the Chinese insects in the state of larva and pupa, if we except a sew species of the Cimices, Cicada, and some altogether uninteresting insects, that have been accidentally brought among others from that country. Hence it must remain undetermined whether they correspond in form with those of other parts of the world. It is, however, highly probable, from their great affinity to those, in the perfect state, that in the state of larva they may also agree. The extensive collection of the larva of sphinges made by Mr. Abbot in North America affords no singularly constructed animal distinct from those sound in Europe; they vary indeed in their colours, but preserve uniformly the characters found on the same genus in other countries. We noticed among the drawings of the late Mr. Bradshaw the figure of a Chinese sphinx, apparently <HI>S. Hylas,</HI> together with a larva similar to that of the Sphinx Stellatarum: it was green, and, like all the known larva of the genus, (except the <HI>Adscitae</HI> division) was perfectly free from hairs: it was also furnished with a horn at the posterior part of the body.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The specimen figured in the annexed plate, is in the collection of Mr. Francillon, who received it from China. A small variety of the same species is found in North America, and figured by Cramer.

<P>It is altogether perplexing, and mysterious to us, that Fabricius, throughout all his works, and even in his last enlarged and corrected systematic arrangement, has given a Papilio Thallo in the <HI>Heliconii</HI> division of that genus, when it is clear no such Papilio has existence. Linnaeus has, undoubtedly, so named an in∣sect figured in a plate of Edwards's birds, tab. 226, with a reference to that work; yet it is certain the insect there figured is not a butterfly, but a lepidopterous Insect, to which antennae of dubious structure have been added, to perfect its appearance<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Coincident observations on perfect specimens of several insects, nearly allied to this species, tend to convince us, that the artist had only a mutilated specimen to copy from. Indeed, though the antennae in his figure are terminated in a kind of capi∣tulum, like that of the butterflies, the filaments are somewhat jagged, as if intended to appear slightly pectinated. Cramer notices the very close affinity between his insect, <HI>P. Tiberina,</HI> and that in Edwards's work; which, he observes, differs neither in form nor colour, but only in having clubbed antennae: those parts of his insect being pectinated or feathered.—"Mr. Edwards a représenté un Papillon, qui ne differe de celui-ci, ni pour la coleur, ni pour la dessein, mais qui a des antennes à boutons. Celui que nous donnons ici est gravé d'apres une Phalêne qui a des antennes plumacées," &amp;c. <HI>Cram.</HI> C. D. Pl. 32.
<P>Edwards calls this insect the little black and white Butcher fly, because it is figured on a plate with the black and white Butcher bird.</P></NOTE>. No later author has figured the same species; and specimens of it being extremely scarce, it is probable Fabricius has been unable to detect the error. In admitting this, however, we must necessarily notice the synonyms of <HI>Sphinx pectinicornis,</HI> where he also quotes the same figure in the works of Edwards. Thus we find, throughout all the editions of the Fabrician System, a <HI>Papilio Thallo</HI> and <HI>Sphinx pectinicornis</HI> formed of the solitary figure of one insect. Cramer has finally increased the ambiguity of its genera, by making an insect of close affinity, perhaps the same species, a Phalaena. <HI>Vide P. Tiberina.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="122"/>With specimens of both the insects figured by Edwards and Cramer before us, we cannot hesitate to consider them Sphinges of the <HI>Adscitae</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The Adscitae differ from the other sphinges, in their general appearance, but have all the characters assigned to that genus.</NOTE> family, and of the <HI>Zygaena</HI> of Fabricius. In removing our insect to the sphinx genus, we have retained the specific name <HI>Thallo,</HI> as more likely to denote the species than any newly adopted name. The insect figured by Cramer does not precisely agree with Edwards's figure. In the first, the disk of the posterior wings are yellowish, with a deep border of black: in the other, the yellow occupies only a space near the base, and forms a semi-lunar mark near the anterior margin of those wings. We suspect, with Cramer, that they are but the two sexes of one species. Cramer says both his specimens came from China, from whence our insects were also received.</P>

<P>The Phalaenae are a tribe of insects remarkable for the neatness and simplicity of their colours. Their elegancies consist in the infinite variety, and delicacy of intermingled tints: the contrast of spots, speck∣lings, and lineations, which constitute the minutiae of insect beauty. Some species are to be excepted in this remark; the larger kinds are often gaudy, and the smallest exhibit a display of the richest colours, fancifully disposed, and most elegantly diversified.</P>
<P>The European species are numerous, and pretty well ascertained: those of remote countries remain in great obscurity. The species inhabiting China are almost unknown<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fab. Ent. Syst.</HI> These are chiefly described from insects in the collection of <HI>Monson Londini,</HI> of which no figures are extant, and the collection unknown.</NOTE>; for the latest systematic writer describes not more than twenty species in all the cabinets in Europe. From this scanty number a few are selected to illustrate the genus, and if these appear deficient in point of interest or variety, it may stimu∣late others to collect new species, whenever an opportunity occurs. The Phalaena tribe, not only of China, but every country, except of Europe, are a <HI>desideratum</HI> of entomology. In Europe the number of this tribe exceeds that of any other: on the contrary, the extra European species are comparatively the most inconsiderable of our acquisitions. The Papiliones, or Butterflies, are a showy and lively race: they sport in the open fields in day, and attract the traveller's curiosity; hence our cabinets abound with them. But the moth, infinitely more numerous, and not less pleasing, is seldom seen; in the gloominess of its dispo∣sitions,
<PB REF="125"/>it seeks the obscurity of the forest in the day, and only ventures on the wing when the sun is down. In Europe we visit its nocturnal haunts without difficulty or dread; but in hotter climates these are often∣times impenetrable, or the lurking places of ferocious animals; and few will expose themselves to their attacks, to increase the catalogue of exotic Phalaenae<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The far greater number of Phalaenae can only be taken in the woods at night. This is termed <HI>mothing</HI> by collectors. The moths begin to stir about twilight, and when almost dark, commence their flight. The collector is furnished with a large gauze folding-net, in which the insects are caught indiscriminately, for it is impossible to distinguish one species from another, and often is so dark, that the object itself can barely be discerned. Different species have their favourite haunts, some the lanes, and skirts of woods, but many of them prefer the open breaks in the most retired places. As it would be unsafe, or im∣possible, to penetrate the woods in many countries, it it better to collect the larva, or caterpillar, for these may be found on the trees in day-time, and if kept in little gauze cages, and carefully fed, will change into chrysalis, and produce the fly. This is certainly tedious, and few travellers will divert their attention from more important observations; but were they to appropriate their leisure to this branch of science, they would materially improve entomology. Mr. Abbot has investigated a small district of Georgia, in North America, in this manner, and our cabinet is indebted to his labours for several hundred species, altogether new in Europe. The reader may estimate the importance of these discoveries, by referring to the two expensive volumes of North American Insects, lately published; and reflecting, that the originals of all the species included in that work, are but a small selection from those he has furnished us with. Viewing these as the result of one man's research, in an inconsiderable portion of North America, what a variety of new and splendid kinds would be the reward of those, who should explore the more genial regions of Asia, Africa, and South America, with equal diligence and information!
<P>We have hazarded an assertion which may seem inadmissible, that the Phalaenae are infinitely more numerous than the Papiliones, or any other tribe of insects. Not that we possess more; but because, in every country that has been investigated, experience justifies such opinion. For instance, in Great Britain, we have only sixty Papiliones, and by mere accident two or three local species have lately been added; of the Phalaenae we have more than 900. The same comparative proportion is observed throughout the countries of the European continent; and it is singularly analogous, that our opinion is confirmed, by the recent discoveries of Mr. Abbot in America also.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Phalaena Atlas is the first species we have to notice. It is the largest of the moth tribe<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">When Linnaeus described it, few of the very large species of Phalaena were known. We have two species from the interior of Africa, that are larger than the Chinese <HI>var.</HI> of Atlas, and several others scarcely inferior in magnitude.</NOTE>, and is, in∣deed, gigantic creature. The species is common, but not peculiar to China, being found in other parts of Asia, and in America. The influence of climate is easily traced in the <HI>varicties</HI> from different countries; that from Surinam is the largest, and of the deepest colours. The Chinese kind is the next in size; the colours incline to orange, and the anterior wings are more falcated or hooked at the ends. We have two other Asiatic <HI>varieties</HI> still smaller, with the wings extremely falcated.</P>
<P>The larva of Phalaena Atlas is figured by <HI>M. Merian,</HI> in the <HI>Insecta Surinamensia,</HI> plate 52: it is about four inches in length, green, with a yellow stripe disposed longitudinally. Upon each segment are four distinct round tubercles of a coral-like orange colour, which are surrounded with very delicate hairs. The pupa is large, and is inclosed in a web of an ochre colour. The silk of this web is of a strong texture, and it has been imagined, if woven, would be superior in durability to that of the common silk worm. <HI>Seba</HI> has also represented the larva at fig. 1. plate 57. vol. 4. <HI>Thesaurus Naturae.</HI> It is nearly six inches in length, and bulky in proportion; the Phalaena is also larger than that figured by Merian, which is a
<PB REF="126"/>small specimen of the Surinam kind. According to Merian, there are three broods of this insect in a year; they are very common, and feed on the orange trees. Linnaeus says, they adhere so tenaciously to the leaves, that they can scarcely be taken off<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Larva verticillata verrucis pilosis nec folliculos grandes, tenaces, vix extricandos. <HI>Linn. Syst. Nat.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The common silk worm, or Phalaena Mori, is of this family, and merits observation as a native of China. The art of weaving its threads into silk is of the earliest date. The discovery is attributed to the <HI>Seres,</HI> a people of the East Indies, supposed the Chinese<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Velleraque ut foliis depectant tenuia Seres. <HI>Virg. Georg.</HI> II. 122.</NOTE>. In the days of Solomon, we are told, a woman named Pamphilia, of the Island of Co, was skilled in the art of making cloth, of the silk brought from the country of the Seres. The most ancient of the Chinese writers ascribe the invention to one of the women of the emperor <HI>Hoang ti,</HI> named <HI>Si ling,</HI> and in honour <HI>Yuen fei</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">DU HALDE, <HI>Des Soycries.</HI> Les plus anciens écrivans de cet Empire, en attribuent la découverte à une des femmes de l'Empereur <HI>Hoang ti,</HI> nommée <HI>Si ling,</HI> et furnommée par honneur <HI>Yuen fei.</HI></NOTE>. When Rome degenerated into voluptuousness, Persia, its dependency, furnished this article of luxury; but it is supposed they were in∣debted to the Chinese for it, and being supplied only in small quantities, it was consequently dear. In Rome it was so scarce, as to be worn only by persons of the first distinction.</P>
<P>The Chinese historians affirm, that the discovery was considered at first of such importance, that all the women in the palace of the emperor were engaged in rearing the insect, and weaving its silk. In after times, the silk of China was a principal article of commerce, but latterly its value has been materially lessened, by the culture and fabrication of silk in other countries. As the Chinese know little of the use of linen, the silk is a staple article of their own consumption. The jesuit missionaries mention several sorts of it, in use among the Chinese; some admired for beauty, and others for durability. It is gene∣rally supposed these are not merely the effect of different manufacture, but are the produce of dis∣tinct insects<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. Merian says, in the description of the Surinam variety of Phalaena Atlas: "Telam ducunt fortem, quare bonum fore sericum rata, istius aliquam collegi copiam &amp; in Belgium transmisi, ubi eadem optima judicata est: ut itaque, si quis Erucas istas congregandi laborem non detrectaverit, et bonae notae bombycem, et maximum hinc lucrum sibi comparare posset." The thread of which this coccon's web is composed, is so strong, that it has been imagined it would make good silk. I have brought some of it into Holland, which has been esteemed such. So that if any one would take the trouble to collect a number of these caterpillars, they would be found good silk worms, and produce great profit. MERIAN.—Abbot informs us, the Moths of the Emperor tribe, in general, are called Silk worms by the people of Georgia, and in the description of Phalaena cecropia, is still more explicit: for he says, "the caterpillar spins on a twig. The outside web is coarse, the inner covered with silk, like a silk worm's coccon. It is said this silk has been carded, spun, and made into stockings, and that it will wash like linen." <HI>Abbot's Ins. by Dr. J. E. Smith.</HI>—These insects are all of the same natural order, P. Cecropia is rather smaller, but very similar to P. Atlas, and this information at least corroborates the assertion of Merian.
<P>An opinion, that the Chinese rear several kinds of insects for the sake of their silk, has long been prevalent. Dr. Lettsom proposes a query on this subject, "Which species of moth or butterfly is it, the caterpillar of which, in China, affords that strong grey kind of silk, and how is it manufactured or wore? How are these silk worms or caterpillars preserved, fed, and managed? The introduction of such a new silk into England would be it useful acquistion, and redeem entomology from the censure it is now branded with, of being a mere curiosity, void of any real utility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Naturalist and Traveller's Companion, 1774.</NOTE>." If <HI>Lesser</HI> and <HI>Lyonet</HI> are to be relied on, The <HI>Theologie des Insectes</HI> answers this query. "At this day there are to be found in China, in the province of Canton, silk worms in a wild state, which, without any care being taken of them, make in the woods a kind of silk which the inhabitants afterwards gather from the trees. It is grey, without lustre, and is used to make a very thick and strong cloth, named there Kien Tcheon. It may be washed like linen cloth, and does not stain." A Gentleman resident in the East Indies, speaks of a large Phalaena, producing silk in that country. "We have a beautiful silk worm north-east of Bengal, that feeds on the Ricinus, whence I call it Phalaena Ricini: it is sea green, with soft spines, very large, and voracious, and spins a coarse, but strong and useful silk. The moth is of great size, with elegant dark plumage.—Is it known to European Naturalists?"—<HI>In a collection of papers published by</HI> Dr. ANDERSON, <HI>in</HI> MADRAS, 1788, 1789.—M. Le Bon, Reaumur, Roesel, and several others, have attempted to weave the silk of spiders, as a substitute for that of silk worms, but their experiments rather amuse, and point out the ingenuity of the proposers, than promise to be useful; for after many trials, it appears that the silk of spiders would be inferior in lustre, and far more expensive than that of silk worms. Sir G. Staunton alludes to these experiments in his descrip∣tion of the Java forests. "In some open spots were found webs of spiders, woven with threads of so strong a texture, as not easily to be divided without a cutting instrument; they seemed to render feasible the idea of him, who, in the southern provinces of Europe, proposed a manufacture from spiders' threads; which is so ridiculous to the eyes of those who have only viewed the flimsy webs suck insects spin in England."—Many other substances of a soft texture have also been wrought into a variety of trifling articles, as gloves, stockings, &amp;c. of the fibres of Asbestos earth, or mountain flax, beard of the large <HI>Pinna</HI> shell, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P></NOTE>. Sir. G. Staunton speaks of the culture of silk worms in China, but only of the common sort. It will gratify curiosity, if not prove advantageous, should future obververs ascertain what kind of
<PB REF="127"/>insect the Chinese appropriate to making silk, and whether P. Atlas is of the number, as has been conjectured.</P>

<P>This insect is described by Fabricius, and in conformity with his new system, is termed <HI>Acshna cla∣vata</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fabricius divides these two families of Linnaean Libellulae into three distinct genera; the first retains the Linnaean name, the second and third are called Aeshna and Agrion. Their most essential charasters are taken from the form and situation of the mouth, and therefore require a deep magnifier to determine then with accuracy. We have examined those parts in the greater number of the species Fabricius has described, and find his characters agree, except in one instance; but, which alone proves the impracticability of adopting the whole of his system: he describes <HI>Libellula Chinensis,</HI> and refers to the only figure that has been given of it, in one of the plates of Edwards's Natural History of Birds, 1745. Had he ever seen and examined this rare species, he must have referred it to his genus <HI>Agrion,</HI> each of the lips being bisid, or two-clest, as in Libellula virgo and puella,—the essential characteristic of the genus Agrion; for the mouths of the Libellulae of Fabricius differ altogether in structure, and are not notched in the slightest degree, as Libellula clavata, ferruginea, 6 maculata, and the European species Libellula depressa, will sufficiently illustrate.</NOTE>.

To an European, who has seen only the indigenous spiders of his own country, a species five or six inches in length, and nearly the same in breadth, must appear a frightful creature: Aranea Maculata sometimes exceeds that size; but it has not the forbidding aspect of most insects of the same genus. The legs are unusually long, and the body slender. In its general appearance, it resembles some kinds of the <HI>Phalangiae</HI> that are known in Eng∣land by the vulgar name <HI>Harvest men,</HI> being generally seen about that time of the year.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that nature oftentimes adorns the most deformed and loathsome of her creatures in the richest display of colours; and this is especially noticed in many sorts of snakes, toads, lizards, —c. Spiders seem also of this description: to a form the most hideous we frequently find united a brilliance of colours, and elegance of marking, that is scarcely excelled by any of the butterfly tribe,—the most beautiful of all lepidopterous insects. Our present subject is a striking proof of the latter part of this observation. The three figures in our plate of Aranca Maculata exhibit a front and a profile view of the insect, together with the front of the head at the third figure. The head is furnished with two very strong black mandi∣bles, each terminated in an extremely acute point. The fore part of the thorax, which is wholly of a fine silky appearance, and the colour of silver, bending over the mandibles in the form of an arch, or circular head-piece, give it the resemblance of a black head with a crown of silver on the brow. This appearance is heightened in no small degree by three rugged prominences, one in the centre, and another on each side, on the upper part; and by the minute black eyes, which, like those of most spiders, sparkle with the lustre
<PB REF="138"/>of small gems. These eyes are eight in number, four are placed immediately in the front of the silver-coloured circular front piece, and on each side are two more at equal distances, but rather in oblique positions.</P>
<P>The body is really beautiful, the chief colour is deep brown, strongly tinged with bright purple; a broad stripe of orange colour passes down the abdomen from the thorax to the apex: the whole is elegantly marked with a variety of cream-coloured lines and spots intersecting each other. Very little hair is found on any part of this spider except on the thorax, which being rubbed off, discovers a hard testaceous black substance beneath.</P>
<P>Fabricius is the only author who has described this insect: it has never been figured in any work what∣ever, as appears by the latest works of Fabricius, and our own observation. It is not always the most decisive method to determine the species from a concise description; but this is sometimes unavoidable, and in the present instance the description given by Fabricius accords in every respect with our specimen. The only insect with which it could possibly be confounded is Aranea Pilipes, which also has never been figured; it differs however from Aranea Maculata in the very hairy clothing of the legs, and it has also two silver stripes down the back: a striking specific distinction to separate it from our insect. It is also a native of the East Indies, but not of China, that we are informed.</P>

<P>In the Entomologia Systematica of Fabricius we find a species of <HI>Cancri</HI> described, that seems to agree with our specimen. The specific character assigned by that author is however less satisfactory than the general description he has added. The two red spots are very characteristic.</P>
<P>Fabricius met with this creature in the cabinet of <HI>Spengler,</HI> and notes its <HI>habitat</HI> China. It is worthy of remark, that this is the only species of the <HI>Cancer</HI> genus, Fabricius mentions as a native of that country.</P>

<P>The Linnaean <HI>Cancri</HI> are numerous, and include many species not less singular in appearance than the extraordinary creature before us. Indeed, some species are so extremely different from the rest, both in structure and manners of life, that we cannot hesitate in concluding the Linnaean character of the genus defective and indefinite. This may be observed in several of the species Linnaeus himself described, and throughout a more extensive number of those discovered since the time of that author. It is evident Linnaeus could never reconcile the subdivisions of the two principal families; the <HI>Brachyuri</HI> and <HI>Macrouri;</HI> or crabs with short and long tails; and later naturalists have ventured, with propriety, to alter this part of his arrangement. The <HI>Pagarus, Hippa, Scyllaris, Astacus, Squilla,</HI> and <HI>Gammarus,</HI> are so many new genera, formed of the Linnaean tribes of <HI>Cancri</HI> in the last System of Fabricius. The genus, to which Fabricius retains the name <HI>Cancer,</HI> is distinguished from the rest, by having four short filiform antennae; with the extreme articulation bifid, as we observe in the preceding species. This author follows Degeer in describing the Cancer Mantis, and alters the generic name to Squilla: he observes, that this genus is entirely distinct from the <HI>Cancri,</HI> and we are of the same opinion, but adhere to the Linnaean genera, be∣cause the species, <HI>Mantis,</HI> was described by Linnaeus, and it may be improper therefore to remove it, to a new genus, in any partial survey of his system. The Cancer Mantis is not peculiar to China.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="description">
<P>Travellers agree that the temperate parts of Asia would be a terrestrial paradise, were it not for the multitude of troublesome insects and reptiles with which they are infested. In a well cultivated country, like China, many of these creatures can sscarcely find shelter; but such as harbour in the walls or furniture of human dwellings are as abundant in that, as any other country that lies within or near the tropics. Amongst the latter, none produce more terrible effects than the Centipede, whose poison is as venomous as that of the scorpion, which also is a native of China.</P>
<P>Sir G. Staunton mentions a remarkable circumstance that occurred during the late embassy to China. The ambassador and his suite were accommodated in a temple near the suburbs of Tong-choo-foo. "In some of the apartments the priests had suffered scorpions and scolopendras to harbour through neglect. These noisome creatures were known only by description to some of the gentlemen in the embassy, who had not visited the southern parts of Europe: the sight of such, for the first time, excited a degree of hor∣ror in their minds; and it seemed to them to be a sufficient objection to the country, that it produced these animals." Sir George however adds, that no accident happened in that instance.—The species of Scolopendra he alludes to, is probably <HI>Morsitans,</HI> which is common in many parts of the world, but is par∣ticularly sound of a frightful size, and in vast abundance, in the two Indies.</P>
<P><PB REF="145"/>Many authors have described this creature. In the voluminous works of Seba we find several speci∣mens of it from different countries, differing materially in size, and some trifling particulars, but all pos∣sessing the distinguishing characters of Scolopendra Morsitans. The largest of these exceed our figure in magnitude, being near fourteen inches in length: this he calls <HI>Millepeda major</HI> ex nova Hispania. His figure of <HI>Millepeda Africanae</HI> is about the size of our Chinese specimen. He has also a third and fourth figure, <HI>Millepeda Orientalis</HI> and <HI>Millepeda Celonica, mas:</HI> the latter is the same length as our figure, but the body is very narrow. Millepeda Orientalis is also the same length, but the body is very broad. Some of these insects are not four inches in length.</P>
<P>Authors agree that they vary exceedingly in size<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">These creatures differ from most insects in their manner of growth, insomuch that it it impossible to ascertain when they are of their full size. The segments of the body increase as they advance in age, which circumstance renders it difficult oftentimes to determine the spe∣cies, without a minute examination of its other characters.</NOTE> and colour. De Geer describes them to be some∣times deep reddish brown; at others the colour of yellow ochre. The figure in Catesby's Natural History of Carolina is light brown; we have specimens of a livid yellow, and have seen others strongly tinged with red.</P>
<P>The last pair of legs are considerably larger than the others, and are armed with small black spines. The legs terminate in very sharp hooks or nails of a shining black colour. All the other legs are also fur∣nished with a smaller nail of the same shape and colour.</P>
<P>M. Gronovius says that all its feet are very venemous; but the most formidable of its weapons are the two sharp, hooked instruments that are placed under the mouth, and with which it destroys its prey.</P>
<P>Lewenhoeck having examined thes instruments with a microscope, he found a small opening at the extremity of each, and a channel from them into the body of the creature. Through this channel he sup∣posed poses the Scolopendra emits the poisonous fluid into the wound it makes with the hooked instrument. That author further remarks, that he has seen a liquor on that part of living scolopendras. A figure of these instruments on the under side of the head, is represented in one of the dissections in our plate.</P>
<P>The same author, wishing to ascertain the influence of the poison of Scolopendra morsitans, placed a large fly within its reach. The Scolopendra at first took it between a pair of its middle feet, then passed it from one pair of feet to the next, till the fly was brought under the sharp pointed instrument or crotchets at the head, which it plunged into the fly, and it died instantly. Notwithstanding this experi∣ment, De Geer, Catesby, and other authors, assert, that its bite seldom proves fatal to larger animals; but all agree that its poison is as dangerous as that of the scorpion.</P>
<P>This Scolopendra has eight eyes: they are very small; four are placed on each side of the head near the antennae. In the dissections a figure is given to exhibit the manner in which the four eyes are placed on one side.</P>
