VARIATION. <Q><L>Awake and faithful to her wonted fires.</L></Q>
<P><Q>Thus (says Mr. Mason) it stood in the first and some following editions, and I think rather better; for the authority of Petrarch does not destroy the appearance of quaintness in the other: the thought however is rather obscurely expressed in both readings. He means to say, in plain prose, that we wish to be remembered by our friends after our death, in the same manner as when alive we wished to be remembered by them in our absence: this would be expressed clearer, if the metaphorical term <HI>fires</HI> was rejected, and the line run thus:</Q></P>
<Q><L>"Awake and faithful to her first desires."</L>
<L>In Chaucer's Reve's Prologue, v. 3880,</L>
<L>Yet in our ashen cold is fire yrekin.</L></Q><P>There is, says Mr. Tyrwhitt, so great a resemblance between this line and the above, that I should certainly have considered the latter as an imitation, if Mr. Gray had not referred us to the sonnet of Pe∣trarch as his original.</P></NOTE>.</L>

<L>Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,</L>
<L>'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn</L>
<L>'Brushing with hasty steps the dews away,</L>
<L>'To meet the sun upon the upland lawn<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">VARIATION. <Q><L>On the high brow of yonder hanging lawn.</L>

<L>Oft as the woodlark pip'd her farewell song,</L>

<P><Q>I rather wonder (says Mr. Mason) that he rejected this stanza, as it not only has the same sort of Doric delicacy which charms us pe∣culiarly in this part of the poem, but also completes the account of his whole day: whereas, this evening scene being omitted, we have only his morning walk and his noontide repose.</Q></P></NOTE>.</L>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO Sir THOMAS HANMER<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">A statesman of distinguished merit, and a polite writer. He was descended from a very ancient family in North Wales, and was born in 1676. In the year 1712 he was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons, and died in May, 1746, soon after the publication of his edition of Shakspeare. Dr. Johnson observes that he was a man eminently qualified for such studies as that which occasioned the pre∣sent epistle. <Q>He had (as the same author remarks) what is the first requisite to emendatory criticism, that intuition by which the poet's intention is immediately discovered, and that dexterity of intellect which dispatches its work by the easiest means. He had undoubtedly read much; his acquaintance with customs, opinions, and traditions, seems to have been large; and he is often learned without shew. He seldom passes what he does not understand, without an attempt to find or to make a meaning, and sometimes hastily makes what a little more attention would have found. He is solicitous to reduce to grammar, what he could not be sure that his author intended to be grammatical. Shakspeare regarded more the series of ideas than of words; and his language not being designed for the reader's desk, was all that he desired it to be, if it conveyed his meaning to the au∣dience.</Q> Preface to Shakspeare, p. 46.</NOTE>, On his EDITION of SHAKSPEARE's WORKS.</HEAD>

<HEAD>ELEGY To Miss DASHWOOD. In the Manner of OVID.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. HAMMOND<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This gentleman, says Dr. Johnson, was the second son of Anthony Hammond, a man of note among the wits, poets, and parliamentary orators in the beginning of this century, who was allied to Sir Robert Walpole by marrying his sister. He was born about 1710, and educated at Westminster-school; but it does not appear that he was of any university. He was equerry to the Prince of Wales, and seems to have come very early into publick notice, and to have been distinguished by those whose patronage and friendship prejudiced mankind at that time in favour of those on whom they were bestowed; for he was the companion of Cobham, Lyttelton, and Chesterfield. He is said to have divided his life between pleasure and books, in his retirement forgetting the town, and in his gaiety losing the student. Of his literary hours, <HI>The Love Elegies</HI> and the present Poem are the most material. In 1741 he was chosen into Parliament for Truro in Cornwall; being probably one of those who were elected by the Prince's influence; and died next year in June, at Stowe, the famous seat of the Lord Cobham. His mistress, the lady to whom this Elegy is addressed, long out-lived him, and in 1779 died unmarried. The character which her lover bequeathed her was indeed not likely to attract courtship.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<L>These scenes my prudence ushers to my mind,</L>
<L>Of all the storms and quicksands I must find,</L>
<L>If I embark upon this summer sea,</L>

<L>Had our ill fate ne'er blown thy dang'rous flame</L>
<L>Beyond the limits of a friend's cold name,</L>
<L>I might upon that score thy heart receive,</L>
<L>And with that guiltless name my own deceive,</L>
<L>That commerce now in vain you recommend,</L>
<L>I dread the latent lover in the friend;</L>

<L>Hear then the safe, the firm resolve I make,</L>
<L>Ne'er to encourage one I must forsake.</L>
<L>Whilst other maids a shameless path pursue,</L>
<L>Neither to int'rest, nor to honour true,</L>
<L>And, proud to swell the triumph of their eyes,</L>
<L>Exult in love from lovers they despise;</L>
<L>Their maxims all revers'd I mean to prove,</L>
<L>And though I like the lover, quit the love.</L>

<HEAD>FLORA TO POMPEY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE SAME.</BYLINE>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Pompey,</HI> when he was very young, fell in love with <HI>Flora,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> courrezan, who was so very beautiful that the <HI>Romans</HI> had her painted to adorn the temple of <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pollux. Geminius</HI> (<HI>Pompey</HI>'s friend) afterwards fell in love with her too; but she, prepossessed with a passion for <HI>Pompey,</HI> would not listen to <HI>Geminius. Pompey,</HI> in compassion to his friend, fielded him his mistress, which <HI>Flora</HI> took so much to heart, that she fell dangerously ill upon it; and in that sickness is sup∣posed to write the following letter to <HI>Pompey.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>ERE death these closing eyes for ever shade</L>
<L>(That death thy cruelties have welcome made),</L>
<L>Receive, thou yet lov'd man! this one adieu,</L>
<L>This last farewell to happiness and you.</L>
<L>My eyes o'erflow with tears, my trembling hand</L>
<L>Can scarce the letters form, or pen command;</L>
<L>The dancing paper swims before my sight,</L>
<L>Stud scarce myself can read the words I write.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think you behold me in this lost estate,</L>
<L>And think yourself the author of my fate:</L>
<L>How vast the change! your Flora's now become</L>
<L>The gen'ral pity, not the boast of Rome.</L>
<L>This form, a pattern to the sculptor's art,</L>
<L>This face, the idol once of Pompey's heart,</L>
<L><PB N="95" REF="97"/>(Whose pictur'd beauties Rome thought fit to place</L>
<L>The sacred temples of her gods to grace)</L>
<L>Are charming now no more; the bloom is fled,</L>
<L>The lilies languid, and the roses dead.</L>
<L>Soon shall some hand the glorious work deface,</L>
<L>Where Grecian pencils tell what Flora was:</L>
<L>No longer my resemblance they impart,</L>
<L>They lost their likeness, when I lost thy heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! that those hours could take their turn again,</L>
<L>When Pompey, lab'ring with a jealous pain,</L>
<L>His Flora thus bespoke: "Say, my dear love!</L>
<L>"Shall all these rivals unsuccessful prove?</L>
<L>"In vain, for ever, shall the Roman youth</L>
<L>"Envy my happiness, and tempt thy truth?</L>
<L>"Shall neither tears nor prayers thy pity move?</L>
<L>"Ah! give not pity, 'tis a-kin to love.</L>
<L>"Would Flora were not fair in such excess,</L>
<L>"That I might fear, though not adore her less."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fool that I was, I sought to ease that grief,</L>
<L>Nor knew indiff'rence follow'd the relief:</L>
<L>Experience taught the cruel truth too late,</L>
<L>I never dreaded, 'till I found my fate.</L>
<L>'Twas mine to ask if Pompey's self could hear,</L>
<L>Unmov'd, his rival's unsuccessful pray'r;</L>
<L>To make thee swear he'd not thy pity move;</L>
<L>Alas! such pity is no kin to love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas thou thyself, (ungrateful as thou art)</L>
<L>Bade me unbend the rigour of my heart:</L>
<L><PB N="96" REF="98"/>You chid my faith, reproach'd my being true,</L>
<L>(Unnat'ral thought!) and labour'd to subdue</L>
<L>The constancy my soul maintain'd for you;</L>
<L>To other arms your mistress you condemn'd,</L>
<L>Too cool a lover, and too warm a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How could'st thou thus my lavish heart abuse,</L>
<L>To ask the only thing it could refuse?</L>
<L>Nor yet upbraid me, Pompey, what I say,</L>
<L>For 'tis my merit that I can't obey;</L>
<L>Yet this alledg'd against me as a fault,</L>
<L>Thy rage fomented, and my ruin wrought.</L>
<L>Just gods! what tie, what conduct can prevail</L>
<L>O'er fickle man, when truth like mine can fail?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Urge not, to gloss thy crime, the name of friend,</L>
<L>We know how far those sacred laws extend;</L>
<L>Since other heroes have not blush'd to prove</L>
<L>How weak all passions when oppos'd to love:</L>
<L>Nor boast the virtuous conflict of thy heart,</L>
<L>When gen'rous pity took Geminius' part;</L>
<L>'Tis all heroic fraud, and Roman art.</L>
<L>Such flights of honour might amuse the crowd,</L>
<L>But by a mistress ne'er can be allow'd;</L>
<L>Keep for the senate, and the grave debate,</L>
<L>That infamous hypocrisy of state,</L>
<L>There words are virtue, and your trade deceit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No riddle is thy change, nor hard t' explain,</L>
<L>Flora was fond, and Pompey was a man:</L>
<L><PB N="97" REF="99"/>No longer then a specious tale pretend,</L>
<L>Nor plead fictitious merit to your friend:</L>
<L>By nature false, you follow'd her decree,</L>
<L>Nor gen'rous are to him, but false to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You say you melted at Geminius' tears;</L>
<L>You say you felt his agonizing cares:</L>
<L>Gross artifice! that this from him could move,</L>
<L>And not from Flora, whom you say you love:</L>
<L>You could not bear to hear your rival sigh,</L>
<L>Yet bear unmov'd to see your mistress die.</L>
<L>Inhuman hypocrite! not thus can he</L>
<L>My wrongs, and my distress, obdurate, see,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He, who receiv'd, condemns the gift you made,</L>
<L>And joins with me the giver to upbraid,</L>
<L>Forgetting he's oblig'd, and mourning I'm betray'd.</L>
<L>He loves too welt that cruel gift to use,</L>
<L>Which Pompey lov'd too little to refuse:</L>
<L>Fain would he call my vagrant lord again,</L>
<L>But I the kind ambassador restrain;</L>
<L>I scorn to let another take my part,</L>
<L>And to myself will owe or lose thy heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can nothing e'er rekindle love in thee?</L>
<L>Can nothing e'er extinguish it in me?</L>
<L>That I could tear thee from this injur'd breast!</L>
<L>And where you gave my person, give the rest,</L>
<L>At once to grant and punish thy request.</L>
<L>That I could place thy worthy rival there!</L>
<L>No second insult need my fondness fear:</L>
<L><PB N="98" REF="100"/>He views not Flora with her Pompey's eyes,</L>
<L>He loves like me, he doats, despairs, and dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come to my arms, thou dear deserving youth!</L>
<L>Thou prodigy of man! thou man with truth!</L>
<L>For him, I will redouble every care,</L>
<L>To please, for him, these faded charms repair;</L>
<L>To crown his vows, and sharpen thy despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! 'tis illusion all! and idle rage!</L>
<L>No second passion can this heart engage;</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Roxana,</HI> one of <HI>Usbeck's</HI> wives, was found (whilst he was in <HI>Europe</HI>) in bed with her lover, whom she had privately let into the seraglio. The guardian eunuch, who discovered them, had the man murdered on the spot, and her close guarded 'till he received instructions from his master how to dispose of her, During that interval she swallowed poison, and is supposed to write the following letter whilst she is dying.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>

<L>No mean defence expect, or abject prayers;</L>
<L>Thou know'st no mercy, and I know no tears:</L>
<L>I laugh at all thy vengeance has decreed,</L>
<L>Avow the fact, and glory in the deed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes, tyrant! I deceiv'd thy spies and thee:</L>
<L>Pleas'd in oppression, and in bondage free:</L>
<L>The rigid agents of thy cruel laws</L>
<L>By gold I won to aid my juster cause:</L>
<L>With dextrous skill eluded all thy care,</L>
<L>And acted more than jealousy could fear:</L>
<L>To wanton bow'rs this prison-house I turn'd,</L>
<L>And bless'd that absence which you thought I mourn'd.</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="109"/>But short those joys allow'd by niggard Fate,</L>
<L>Yet so refin'd, so exquisitely great,</L>
<L>That their excels compensated their date.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I die: already in each burning vein</L>
<L>I feel the pois'nous draught, and bless the pain:</L>
<L>For what is life unless its joys we prove?</L>
<L>And where is joy, depriv'd of what we love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, ere I die, this justice I have paid</L>
<L>To my dear murder'd lover's injur'd shade:</L>
<L>Those sacrilegious instruments of power,</L>
<L>Who wrought that ruin these sad eyes deplore,</L>
<L>Already with their blood their crimes atone,</L>
<L>And for his life have sacrific'd their own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thee, though restraint and absence may defend</L>
<L>From my revenge, my curses still attend:</L>
<L>Despair, like mine, barbarian! be thy part,</L>
<L>Remorse afflict, and sorrow sting thy heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor think this hate commencing in my breast,</L>
<L>Though prudence long its latent force suppress'd;</L>
<L>I knew those wrongs that I was forc'd to bear,</L>

<L>Poor abject souls in superstition bred,</L>

<L><PB N="108" REF="110"/>Didst thou imagine me so weak of mind,</L>

<L>But hugg'd my chain, and thought my jaylor kind?</L>

<L>And whilst self-licens'd through the world you rove,</L>
<L>To quicken appetite by change in love;</L>

<L>That Lust can urge, or Fancy can suggest:</L>
<L>That I should mourn thy loss with fond regret,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Could I believe that heav'n this beauty gave,</L>
<L>(Thy transient pleasure, and thy lasting slave;)</L>
<L>Indu'd with reason, only to fulfil</L>
<L>The harsh commands of thy capricious will?</L>
<L>No, Usbeck, no, my soul disdain'd those laws;</L>
<L>And, though I wanted pow'r t' assert my cause,</L>
<L>My right I knew; and still those pleasures sought,</L>
<L>Which Justice warranted, and Nature taught:</L>
<L>On Custom's senseless precepts I refin'd,</L>
<L>I weigh'd what heav'n, I knew what man design'd,</L>
<L>And form'd by her own rules my free-born mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus whilst this wretched body own'd thy power,</L>
<L>Doom'd, unredress'd, its hardships to deplore;</L>
<L>My soul subservient to herself alone,</L>
<L>And Reason independent on her throne,</L>
<L>Contemn'd thy dictates, and obey'd their own.</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="111"/>Yet thus far to my conduct thanks are due,</L>
<L>At least I condescended to seem true;</L>
<L>Eadeavour'd still my sentiments to hide,</L>
<L>Indulg'd thy vanity, and sooth'd thy pride.</L>
<L>Though this submission to a tyrant paid,</L>
<L>Whom not my duty, but my fears obey'd,</L>
<L>If rightly weigh'd, would more deserve the blame,</L>
<L>Who call it Virtue, but prophane her name;</L>
<L>For to the world, I should have own'd that love,</L>
<L>Which all impartial judges must approve:</L>
<L>You urg'd a right to tyrannize my heart,</L>
<L>Which he, solliciting, assail'd by art,</L>
<L>Whilst I, impatient of the name of slave,</L>
<L>To force refus'd, what I to merit gave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft, as thy slaves this wretched body led</L>
<L>To the detested pleasures of thy bed;</L>
<L>In those soft moments, consecrate to joy,</L>
<L>Which ecstasy and transport should employ;</L>
<L>Clasp'd in your arms, you wonder'd still to find</L>
<L>So cold my kisses, so compos'd my mind:</L>
<L>But had thy cheated eyes discern'd aright,</L>
<L>You'd found aversion, where you sought delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not that my soul, incapable of love,</L>
<L>No charms could warm, no tenderness could move;</L>
<L>For him, whose love my every thought possess'd,</L>
<L>A fiercer passion fill'd this constant breast,</L>
<L>Than truth e'er felt, or falshood e'er possess'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="110">
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
<L>This style unusual to thy pride appears;</L>
<L>For truth's a stranger to the tyrant's ears.</L>
<L>But what have I to manage, or to dread?</L>
<L>Nor threats alarm, nor insults hurt the dead:</L>
<L>No wrongs they feel, no miseries they find;</L>
<L>Cares are the legacies we leave behind:</L>
<L>In the calm grave no Usbecks we deplore,</L>
<L>No tyrant husband, no oppressive power.</L>
<L>Alas! I faint—Death intercepts the rest:</L>
<L>The venom'd drug is busy in my breast:</L>
<L>Each nerve's unstrung: a mist obscures the day:</L>
<L>My senses, strength, and ev'n my hate decay;</L>
<L>Though rage awhile the ebbing spirits stay'd,</L>
<L>'Tis past—they sink beneath the transient aid.</L>
<L>Take then, inhuman wretch! my last farewel;</L>
<L>Pain be thy portion here! hereafter, hell!</L>

<L>And now my bold romantic thought aspires</L>

<HEAD>THE SQUIRE OF DAMES. A POEM. IN SPENSER's STILE, BY MOSES MENDEZ ESQ.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Of Mitcham in Surry, a gentleman of the Jewish religion, author of three dramatick pieces, a poem called Henry and Blanche, printed in 4to, 1746, and several other performances scattered in different mis∣cellanies. On the 19th of June, 1750, he was created M. A. by the university of Oxford. He is supposed to have been the richest poet of his time, being possessed at the time of his death, 4th of February, 1758, of not less than one hundred thousand pounds.</NOTE>. ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In the seventh Canto of the Legend of <HI>Chastity,</HI> in <HI>Spenser's Fairy Queen,</HI> the Squire of <HI>Dames</HI> tells <HI>Satyrane,</HI> that by order of his mistress <HI>Columbel,</HI> (after having served the ladies for a year) he was sent out a second time, not to return till he could find three hundred women incapable of yielding to any temptation. The bad success he met with in the course of three years, which is slightly touch'd upon by <HI>Spenser,</HI> is the foundation of the following poem.</P>

Being unsuccessful in publishing his works, he lay in the prison of Bocardo at Oxford, and the King's Bench, until Bishop Usher, Dr. Laud, Sir Wil∣liam Boswell, and Dr. Pink, released him, by paying his debts.

<L>SEE how that pair of billing doves</L>
<L>With open murmurs own their loves;</L>
<L>And, heedless of censorious eyes,</L>
<L>Pursue their unpolluted joys:</L>
<L>No fears of future want molest</L>
<L>The downy quiet of their nest;</L>
<L>No int'rest join'd the happy pair,</L>
<L>Securely blest in Nature's care,</L>
<L>While her dear dictates they pursue:</L>
<L>For constancy is nature too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can all the doctrine of our schools,</L>
<L>Our maxims, our religious rules,</L>
<L>Can learning to our lives ensure</L>
<L>Virtue so bright, or bliss so pure?</L>
<L>The great Creator's happy ends,</L>
<L>Virtue and pleasure ever blends:</L>
<L>In vain the church and court have try'd</L>
<L>Th' united essence to divide;</L>
<L>Alike they find their wild mistake,</L>
<L>The pedant priest, and giddy rake.</L>

<HEAD>AN ANSWER to a LOVE-LETTER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the SAME.</BYLINE>
<L>IS it to me, this sad lamenting strain:</L>
<L>Are heaven's choicest gifts bestow'd in vain?</L>
<L>A plenteous fortune, and a beauteous bride,</L>
<L>Your love rewarded, gratify'd your pride:</L>
<L>Yet leaving her—'tis me that you pursue</L>
<L>Without one single charm, but being new.</L>
<L>How vile is man! how I detest their ways</L>
<L>Of artful falshood, and designing praise!</L>
<L>Tasteless, an easy happiness you slight,</L>
<L>Ruin your joy, and mischief your delight,</L>
<L>Why should poor pug (the mimic of your kind)</L>
<L>Wear a rough chain, and be to box confin'd?</L>
<L>Some cup, perhaps, he breaks, or tears a fan,—</L>
<L>While roves unpunish'd the destroyer, man.</L>
<L>Not bound by vows, and unrestrain'd by shame,</L>
<L>In sport you break the heart, and rend the fame.</L>
<L>Not that your art can be successful here,</L>
<L>Th' already plunder'd need no robber fear:</L>
<L><PB N="208" REF="212"/>Nor sighs, nor charms, nor flatteries can move,</L>
<L>Too well secur'd against a second love.</L>
<L>Once, and but once, that devil charm'd my mind;</L>
<L>To reason deaf, to observation blind;</L>
<L>I idly hop'd (what cannot love persuade!)</L>
<L>My fondness equal'd, and my love repay'd;</L>
<L>Slow to distrust, and willing to believe,</L>
<L>Long hush'd my doubts, and did myself deceive:</L>
<L>But oh! too soon—this tale would ever last;</L>
<L>Sleep, sleep, my wrongs, and let met think 'em past,</L>
<L>For you, who mourn with counterfeited grief,</L>
<L>And ask so boldly like a begging thief,</L>
<L>May soon some other nymph inflict the pain,</L>
<L>You know so well with cruel art to feign!</L>
<L>Though long you sported have with Cupid's dart,</L>
<L>You may see eyes, and you may feel a heart.</L>
<L>So the brisk wits, who stop the evening coach,</L>
<L>Laugh at the fear that follows their approach;</L>
<L>With idle mirth, and haughty scorn despise</L>
<L>The passenger's pale cheek, and staring eyes;</L>
<L>But, seiz'd by Justice, find a fright no jest,</L>
<L>And all the terror doubled in their breast.</L>

<L>YOU little know the heart that you advise;</L>
<L>I view this various scene with equal eyes:</L>
<L>In crowded courts I find myself alone,</L>

<L>Well as I can my tedious part I bear,</L>
<L>And wait for my dismission without fear.</L>
<L>Seldom I mark mankind's detested ways,</L>
<L>Not hearing censure, nor affecting praise;</L>
<L>And, unconcern'd, my future state I trust</L>
<L>To that sole Being, merciful and just.</L>

<L>Should'ring unheeded Happiness aside;</L>
<L>Thwarted and push'd and lab'ring into name,</L>

<L>Yet where thou shin'st, like heaven behind a cloud,</L>

<L>Nor then let dreams, of wanton folly born,</L>

<HEAD>The LAWYER'S FAREWELL to his MUSE. Written in the year 1744.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Sir WILLIAM BLACKSTONE<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This accomplished lawyer was born in Cheapside, 10th of July, 1723, and was the yougest son of Mr. Charles Blackstone, who carried on the business of a silkman. At the age of seven years he was put to school at the Charter-house, and in 1735 admitted on the foundation there by the nomination of Sir Robert Walpole. On the 30th of No∣vember, 1738, ha was entered a commoner at Pembroke College, Ox∣ford, was matriculated the next day, and in Febuary following elected to one of Lady Holford's exhibitions for Charter-house scholars. De∣termining to make choice of the law for his profession, he entered him∣self in the Middle Temple the 20th of November, 1741. In Novem∣ber, 1743, he was elected into the society of All Souls College. On the 12th of July, 1745, he commenced Batchelor of the Civil Law; and on the 28th of November, 1746, was called to the bar. He proceeded, 26th of April, 1750, Doctor of Civil Law; and having attended the courts at Westminster with little success, he in 1753 determined to re∣tire to an academical life. He accordingly, in Michaelmas Term that year, began to read lectures on the laws of England at Oxford. On the 22d of October, 1758, he was unanimously elected Vinerian Professor of the Common Law at that university. In the succeeding year he re∣turned to the practice of his profession in London; and in Michaelmas Term resumed his attendance at Westminster, where his merit was now both known and rewarded. On the 28th of July, 1761, he was ap∣pointed principal of New Inn Hall; and on the establishment of the Queen's family was named Solicitor General to her Majesty. In 1766 he resigned his posts in the university of Oxford; and on the 9th of February, 1770, was nominated a Judge in the Common Pleas; but, to accommodate Sir Joseph Yates, consented to accept a seat in the Court of King's Bench, from whence he was soon removed to the place of his original destination. From this period to the time of his death he de∣voted his attention to the service of the public, and the duties of do∣mestic life. About Christmas, 1779, he was seized with a violent shortness of breath, from which he in some measure recovered; but the disorder returning with fresh vigour, it brought on a drowsiness and stu∣por, which put an end to his life, on the 14th of Febuary, 1780, in the 56th year of his age.</NOTE>, Knt.</BYLINE>

On the 20th of October, 1744, he was installed a Knight of the Bath, and in 1746 appointed minister to the court of Ber∣lin. He continued in that situation until the 9th of May, 1749, when he was named envoy extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the same court. In 1754 he represented the borough of Leominster, and about that time went ambassador to the court of Ruffia. He acquitted him∣self in his several employments abroad with considerable abilities; but falling into an ill state of health, he returned to England, and died the 2d of November, 1759.</NOTE>, Knt. of the Bath.</HEAD>

<L>WHEN now, mature in classic knowledge,</L>
<L>The joyful youth is sent to college,</L>

<L>At Oxford bred—in Anna's reign,</L>
<L>And thus in form of humble suitor,</L>
<L>Bowing, accosts a reverend tutor:</L>

<BYLINE>BY FRANCIS FAWKES, A.

Entering early into holy orders he settled first at Bramham in Yorkshire, and afterwards at Croydon, where he held the curacy. In this situation he recommended himself to the notice of Archbishop Herring, who then resided at the latter place on account of his health; and, in 1755, was, by that pre∣late, collated to the vicarage of Orpington with St. Mary Cray, in Kent. In April 1774, by the late Dr. Plumptree's favour, he exchanged his vicarage for the rectory of Hayes. He died August 26, 1777.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>BY W. SOMERVILE<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">William Somervile, Author of the Chace, Hobbinol, and other poems, was descended from a very ancient family in Warwickshire. He was the son of Robert Somervile, of Edston, in that county, and, as he says himself, was born near Avon's banks. He received his educa∣tion at Winchester school, but does not appear to have been at any University. Dr. Johnson says, he never heard of him but as of a Poet, a country gentleman, and a useful Justice of the Peace. Like his friend Shenstone, his latter days were rendered unhappy by the bad state of his finances. He suffered himself to be overcome by habits of drinking, and died July, 14, 1743.</NOTE>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></BYLINE>

<HEAD>DENNIS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John Dennis the celebrated critic, in the latter part of his life, by extravagance and inattention fell into poverty and distress. At the age of near 77 he became blind and overwhelmed with debts. In this de∣plorable situation his misery excited the compassion of Mr. Thomson and some other gentlemen, who procured for him a benefit at the thea∣tre in the Hay-market Dec. 18, 1733. The play was the Provoked Husband: on this occasion Mr. Pope wrote a Prologue, which was spoken by Mr. Cibber, junior. The exhibition produced near 100l. but the old man survived it a very short time, dying on the 6th of Ja∣nuary 1733-4. A writer of Mr. Dennis's Life, printed in 8vo, 1734, asserts these to have been the production of Mr. Savage.</NOTE> TO MR. THOMSON, Who had procured him a Benefit-Night.</HEAD>

<HEAD>I. ABSENCE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YE shepherds so chearful and gay,</L>
<L>Whose flocks never carelessly roam!</L>
<L>Should Corydon's happen to stray,</L>
<L>Oh! call the poor wanderers home.</L>
<L>Allow me to muse and to sigh,</L>
<L>Nor talk of the change that ye find;</L>
<L>None once was so watchful as I:</L>
<L>—I have left my dear Phyllis behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Now I know what it is, to have strove</L>
<L>With the torture of doubt and desire;</L>
<L>What it is, to admire and to love,</L>
<L>And to leave her we love and admire.</L>
<L>All lead forth my flock in the morn,</L>
<L>And the damps of each ev'ning repell;</L>
<L>Alas! I am faint and forlorn:</L>
<L>—I have bade my dear Phyllis farewell.</L>

<PB N="374" REF="378"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Since Phyllis vouchsaf'd me a look,</L>
<L>I never once dreamt of my vine;</L>
<L>May I lose both my pipe and my crook,</L>
<L>If I knew of a kid that was mine.</L>
<L>I priz'd every hour that went by,</L>
<L>Beyond all that had pleas'd me before;</L>
<L>But now they are past, and I figh,</L>
<L>And I grieve that I priz'd them no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>But why do I languish in vain?</L>
<L>Why wander thus pensively here?</L>
<L>Oh! why did I come from the plain,</L>
<L>Where I fed on the smiles of my dear?</L>
<L>They tell me, my favourite maid,</L>
<L>The pride of that valley, is flown;</L>
<L>Alas! where with her I have stray'd,</L>
<L>I could wander with pleasure, alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>When forc'd the fair nymph to forego,</L>
<L>What anguish I felt at my heart!</L>
<L>Yet I thought—but it might not be so—</L>
<L>'Twas with pare that she saw me depart.</L>
<L>She gaz'd, as I slowly withdrew;</L>
<L>My path I could hardly discern;</L>
<L>So sweetly she bade me adieu,</L>
<L>I thought that she bade me return.</L>

<L>The pilgrim that journeys all day</L>
<L>To visit some far-distant shrine,</L>
<L>If he bear but a relique away,</L>
<L>Is happy, nor heard to repine.</L>
<L>Thus widely remov'd from the fair,</L>
<L>Where my vows, my devotion, I owe,</L>
<L>Soft hope is the relique I bear,</L>
<L>And my solace wherever I go.</L>

<HEAD>II. HOPE.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>MY banks they are furnish'd with bees,</L>
<L>Whose murmur invites one to sleep;</L>
<L>My grottos are shaded with trees,</L>
<L>And my hills are white-over with sheep.</L>
<L>I seldom have met with a loss,</L>
<L>Such health do my fountains bestow;</L>
<L>My fountains all border'd with moss,</L>
<L>Where the hare-bells and violets grow.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Not a pine in my grove is there seen,</L>
<L>But with tendrils of woodbine is bound:</L>
<L>Not a beech's more beautiful green,</L>
<L>But a sweet-briar twines it around.</L>
<L>Not my fields, in the prime of the year,</L>
<L>More charms than my cattle unfold:</L>
<L>Not a brook that is limpid and clear,</L>
<L>But it glitters with fishes of gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<PB N="376" REF="380"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>One would think she might like to retire</L>
<L>To the bow'r I have labour'd to rear;</L>
<L>Not a shrub that I heard her admire,</L>
<L>But I hasted and planted it there.</L>
<L>O how sudden the jessamin strove</L>
<L>With the lilac to render it gay!</L>
<L>Already it calls for my love,</L>
<L>To prune the wild branches away.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>From the plains, from the woodlands and groves,</L>
<L>What strains of wild melody flow!</L>
<L>How the nightingales warble their loves</L>
<L>From thickets of roses that blow!</L>
<L>And when her bright form shall appear,</L>
<L>Each bird shall harmoniously join</L>
<L>In a concert so soft and so clear</L>
<L>As—she may not be fond to resign.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>I have founnd out a gift for my fair;</L>
<L>I have found where the wood-pigeons breed:</L>
<L>But let me that plunder forbear,</L>
<L>She will say 'twas a barbarous deed.</L>
<L>For he ne'er could be true, she averr'd,</L>
<L>Who could rob a poor bird of its young:</L>
<L>And I lov'd her the more, when I heard</L>
<L>Such tenderness fall from her tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<PB N="377" REF="381"/>
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>I have heard her with sweetness unfold</L>
<L>How that pity was due to—a dove:</L>
<L>That it ever attended the bold;</L>
<L>And she call'd it the sister of love.</L>
<L>But her words such a pleasure convey,</L>
<L>So much I her accents adore,</L>
<L>Let her speak, and whatever she say,</L>
<L>Methinks I should love her the more.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Can a bosom so gentle remain</L>
<L>Unmov'd, when her Corydon sighs?</L>
<L>Will a nymph that is fond of the plain,</L>
<L>These plains, and this valley despise?</L>
<L>Dear regions of silence and shade!</L>
<L>Soft scenes of contentment and ease!</L>
<L>Where I could have pleasingly stray'd,</L>
<L>If aught, in her absence, could please.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>But where does my Phyllida stray?</L>
<L>And where are her grots and her bow'rs?</L>
<L>Are the groves and the valleys as gay,</L>
<L>And the shepherds as gentle as ours?</L>
<L>The groves may perhaps be as fair,</L>
<L>And the face of the valleys as fine;</L>
<L>The swains may in manners compare,</L>
<L>But their love is not equal to mine.</L>

<HEAD>III. SOLICITUDE.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>WHY will you my passion reprove?</L>
<L>Why term it a folly to grieve?</L>
<L>Ere I shew you the charms of my love,</L>
<L>She is fairer than you can believe.</L>
<L>With her mien she enamours the brave;</L>
<L>With her wit she engages the free;</L>
<L>With her modesty pleases the grave;</L>
<L>She is every way pleasing to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>O you that have been of her train,</L>
<L>Come and join in my amorous lays;</L>
<L>I could lay down my life for the swain</L>
<L>That will sing but a song in her praise.</L>
<L>When he sings, may the nymphs of the town</L>
<L>Come trooping, and listen the while;</L>
<L>Nay on him let not Phyllida frown;</L>
<L>—But I cannot allow her to smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>For when Paridel tries in the dance</L>
<L>Any favour with Phyllis to find,</L>
<L>O how, with one trivial glance,</L>
<L>Might she ruin the peace of my mind!</L>
<L>In ringlets He dresses his hair,</L>
<L>And his crook is bestudded around;</L>
<L>And his pipe—oh may Phyllis beware</L>
<L>Of a magic there is in the sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<PB N="379" REF="383"/>
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis His with mock passion to glow;</L>
<L>'Tis His in smooth tales to unfold,</L>
<L>"How her face is as bright as the snow,</L>
<L>"And her bosom, he sure, is as cold;</L>
<L>"How the nightingales labour the strain,</L>
<L>"With the notes of his charmer to vie:</L>
<L>"How they vary their accents in vain,</L>
<L>"Repine at her triumphs, and die."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>To the grove or the garden he strays,</L>
<L>And pillages every sweet;</L>
<L>Then, suiting the wreath to his lays</L>
<L>He throws it at Phyllis's feet.</L>
<L>"O Phyllis, he whispers, more fair,</L>
<L>"More sweet than the jessamin's flow'r!</L>
<L>"What are pinks, in a morn, to compare?</L>
<L>"What is eglantine after a show'r?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>"Then the lily no longer is white;</L>
<L>"Then the rose is depriv'd of its bloom;</L>
<L>"Then the violets die with despight,</L>
<L>"And the woodbines give up their perfume."</L>
<L>Thin glide the soft numbers along,</L>
<L>And he fancies no shepherd his peer;</L>
<L>—Yet I never should envy the song,</L>
<L>Were not Phyllis to lend it an ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<PB N="380" REF="384"/>
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Let his crook be with hyacinths bound,</L>
<L>So Phyllis the trophy despise;</L>
<L>Let his forehead with laurels be crown'd,</L>
<L>So they shine not in Phyllis's eyes.</L>
<L>The language that flows from the heart</L>
<L>Is a stranger to Paridel's tongue;</L>
<L>—Yet may she beware of his art,</L>
<L>Or sure I must envy the song.</L>
</LG>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IV. DISAPPOINTMENT.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>YE shepherds, give ear to my lay,</L>
<L>And take no more heed of my sheep:</L>
<L>They have nothing to do, but to stray;</L>
<L>I have nothing to do, but to weep.</L>
<L>Yet do not my folly reprove;</L>
<L>She was fair—and my passion begun;</L>
<L>She smil'd—and I could not but love;</L>
<L>She is faithless—and I am undone.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Perhaps I was void of all thought;</L>
<L>Perhaps it was plain to foresee,</L>
<L>That a nymph so compleat would be sought</L>
<L>By a swain more engaging than me.</L>
<L>Ah! love every hope can inspire:</L>
<L>It banishes wisdom the while;</L>
<L>And the lip of the nymph we admire</L>
<L>Seems for ever adorn'd with a smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<PB N="381" REF="385"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>She is faithless, and I am undone;</L>
<L>Ye that witness the woes I endure,</L>
<L>Let reason instruct you to shun</L>
<L>What it cannot instruct you to cure.</L>
<L>Beware how ye loiter in vain</L>
<L>Amid nymphs of an higher degree:</L>
<L>It is not for me to explain</L>
<L>How fair, and how fickle they be.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Alas! from the day that we met,</L>
<L>What hope of an end to my woes,</L>
<L>When I cannot endure to forget</L>
<L>The glance that undid my repose?</L>
<L>Yet time may diminish the pain:</L>
<L>The flow'r, and the shrub, and the tree,</L>
<L>Which I rear'd for her pleasure in vain,</L>
<L>In time may have comfort for me.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>The sweets of a dew-sprinkled rose,</L>
<L>The sound of a murmuring stream,</L>
<L>The peace which from Solitude flows,</L>
<L>Henceforth shall be Corydon's theme.</L>
<L>High transports are shewn to the sight,</L>
<L>But we are not to find them our own;</L>
<L>Fate never bestow'd such delight,</L>
<L>As I with my Phyllis had known.</L>
<L><PB N="382" REF="386"/>O ye woods, spread your branches apace;</L>
<L>To your deepest recesses I fly;</L>
<L>I would hide with the beasts of the chace;</L>
<L>I would vanish from every eye.</L>
<L>Yet my reed shall resound through the grove</L>
<L>With the same sad complaint it begun;</L>
<L>How she smil'd, and I could not but love;</L>
<L>Was faithless, and I am undone!</L>
