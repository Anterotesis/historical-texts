<P>THE First Division of this King∣dom into <HI>Hundreds</HI> and <HI>Tithings</HI> was ordained by the virtuous and pa∣triotic King Alfred,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Lambard's explication of words prefixed to his Archaionomia, on the word <HI>Centuria.</HI></NOTE> who is expressly said to have therein followed the prudent Council given by Jethro to Moses,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The 1st Establishment of this prudent advice of Jethro I have examined more at large in my Tract on <HI>"the Law of Nature and Principles of Action in Man,"</HI> p. 325 to 329. Wherein I have shewn <HI>the Right of the People</HI> to ELECT Judges and Officers, Civil as well as Military, (Religious Officers and Ministers excepted,) from the <HI>Colonel,</HI> or Captain, of a <HI>Thousand,</HI> (who was also a <HI>justiciary,)</HI> down to the Serjeant (Decurio) or Tithingman; (Deut. i. 9-17.) all which Officers were <HI>elected</HI> and <HI>nominated</HI> by the people before they were in∣vested with Authority by Moses. This <HI>Right of the People</HI> to ELECT <HI>Judges</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> is clearly confirmed by a parallel Text in the same Book. Chap. xvi. 18.—<Q>JUDGES <HI>and</HI> OFFICERS <HI>shalt thou make thee in all thy Gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy Tribes, and they shall judge the People with just Judgement.</HI></Q> When this is rendered literally ac∣cording to the Original, the <HI>popular Right of Election</HI> appears still more manifest.—<Q>Judges and Officers shalt thou give to thyself,</Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) which could no otherwise be than by a <HI>free Election</HI> in all their Gates, (i. e. the Gates of their Cities, where the public Courts were anciently held,) for the <HI>Judges and Officers</HI> to each Tribe respectively.—Let us be truly thankful to God for the <HI>Justice</HI> of his Laws, and let us pray that we may have Grace to adopt them! As far as the nature of our political Establishments will legally permit, let us, for the honour of <HI>Human Nature,</HI> imitate the <HI>glorious State of Political Liberty</HI> with which God was pleased to bless his people ISRAEL; and in which he would, most cer∣tainly, have maintained them, if they had persevered in <HI>the right Faith,</HI> and in due obedience to <HI>his Laws!</HI> But, when men forsake GOD, they unavoidably lose their LIBERTY! Let no man conceive that the <HI>Rights of Election,</HI> which I have proved by Scripture, were the Rights only of a <HI>single</HI> Nation, the <HI>People of Israel;</HI> on the contrary, let us remember, that, as <HI>all</HI> Nations under the Christian Dispensation, or rather <HI>all</HI> Nations that are really <HI>Christians,</HI> are said to be engrafted on the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Olive-Tree, and are thereby entitled to the <HI>name</HI> of ISRAEL, so they are undoubtedly entitled likewise to all the immunities and privileges of <HI>redeemed Israel:</HI> for, the only <HI>people,</HI> perhaps, that are <HI>judicially</HI> excluded from those <HI>national</HI> Rights, are the <HI>Branches</HI> which were <HI>broken off from that good Olive-Tree for their unbelief,</HI> i. e. the Jews themselves, who are <HI>broken off,</HI> indeed, for a <HI>time,</HI> (a long <HI>time,</HI> alas, it has now been!) and are dispersed or <HI>strewed</HI> (like <HI>Dead Branches</HI> sepa∣rated from their proper Root) <HI>amongst all the nations of the Earth;</HI> thus <HI>universally</HI> exhibiting, as it were, <HI>a monumental Proof</HI> of the Scripture Testimonies against that peculiar Nation!</P>
<P>But, under the Christian Dispensation, there is not only the <HI>same reason</HI> for claiming to the <HI>people</HI> the Is∣raelitish privilege of <HI>electing all temporal</HI> JUDGES and OFFICERS; but there are also unquestionable Proofs that the <HI>elective Rights</HI> of <HI>Christian People</HI> are enlarged still farther to the choice of all their <HI>Spiritual Officers;</HI> and <HI>Ministers;</HI> whereas, even in Israel, all <HI>Spiritual Functions</HI> were <HI>hereditary</HI> and not <HI>elective.</HI></P>
<P>Thus are the <HI>Elective Rights</HI> of Christian People ex∣ceedingly enlarged; and all persons, who withhold or oppose these just <HI>Rights,</HI> ought to beware lest they be found at last amongst the Enemies of the <HI>King of Righ∣teousness;</HI> for it is remarkable that the <HI>great apostacy,</HI> so long foretold in the Christian Church, could not <HI>mani∣fest itself in power</HI> until the unwearied encroachments and usurpations of <HI>Popes, Emperors,</HI> and <HI>Kings,</HI> had with∣drawn from the <HI>Church</HI> (i. e. the <HI>Congregation of Clergy and People</HI> in each Country or District) that <HI>most essential Right</HI> of all others, the ancient usage of <HI>electing their own Bishops!</HI> See a long Note on this Subject beginning at p. 331 of my Tract on the Law of Retribution.</P></NOTE> for
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>the more commodious Government of <HI>the Israelitish Commonwealth;</HI> it being,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>indeed, an Institution thoroughly con∣sistent with the most <HI>perfect state of Li∣berty</HI> that Human Nature is capable of
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>enjoying, and yet competent neverthe∣less to fulfil all the necessary purposes of <HI>mutual Defence, the due Execution of all just and equal Laws,</HI> and <HI>the sure main∣tenance of the public peace.</HI> <Q>Wonder∣ful Fruits of Utility would this one Council of Alfred (or rather of Jethro) produce to the Common-Wealth</Q> (says the loyal Mr. Lambard) <Q>if we would no longer use the shadow, but hold the sub∣stantial form of the true Tithing</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Mirabiles illud unum Aluredi (vel potius Je∣thronis) concilium allaturum Reipublicae utilitatis fructus, si <HI>verae Decuriae</HI> solidam teneremus imagi∣nem, nec amplius umbra uteremur.</Q> Lambard on the word <HI>Decuria,</HI> or <HI>Tithing.</HI></NOTE> In the Laws of King Edward the Confessor this mode of <HI>national Defence,</HI> by free popular Societies of Armed Citizens in every District and Vicinage, is called <HI>"Summa et maxima Securitas,"</HI> &amp;c.

<PB N="7" REF="6"/><Q><HI>the Chief and greatest Security by which all men are sustained in the firmest State,</HI> viz. that <HI>every one</HI></Q> (unusquisque)
<PB N="8" REF="7"/><Q>should establish <HI>himself under the Se∣curity of a Covenant</HI></Q> (or Suretyship) "which the English call <HI>Freoborhges,</HI>" (i. e. <HI>free pledges,</HI>) <Q>but the Yorkshire∣men alone call <HI>Tienmannatela,</HI> which, expressed in the Latin Tongue, is <HI>De∣cem</HI> Hominum numerum,</Q> (the number of 10 Men.) <Q>This Security was con∣stituted in the following manner, viz. that ALL PERSONS</Q> (UNIVERSI) <Q>of all the Towns of the whole Kingdom ought to be under a <HI>Decenal Surety∣ship: so that if one of the Ten should</HI> FORFEIT</Q> [viz. forfeit his <HI>Free∣pledge</HI>—i. e. his Credit in that little Community as an <HI>honest</HI> and <HI>legal</HI> Mem∣ber of it, <HI>probus</HI> et <HI>legalis,</HI> (see Magna Charta,) by which estimation alone his Neighbours could so far confide in him as to admit him into their <HI>Tithing,</HI> and had a right to expect from him a re∣turn of <HI>mutual security</HI>] <Q>the nine should
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>have him to</Q> (trial of) "RIGHT," (or indict him,) <Q><HI>but, if he should abscond, a term in Law of</HI> 31 <HI>Days should be allowed him: being sought in the mean while and found, he should be brought to the King's Judgement,</HI></Q> (i. e. to Judgement or Justice in the King's Courts,) <HI>"and there, out of his own"</HI> (property,) <HI>should make good whatever</HI> <Q>damage he had done. And, if to this he had forfeited</Q>, (or failed,) <Q>Justice should be done of his body. But if, within the aforesaid term he could not be found, the Chief, or Head, for in every Freeborough</Q> (or Tithing) <Q>there was <HI>one Chief whom they called Freeborough Head</HI></Q>, (Freoborges Heofod i. e. Head-borough or Tithingman,) <Q><HI>should take</HI> 2 <HI>of the better sort of people of his Freeborough, and also, out of the</HI> 3 <HI>nearest Freeboroughs, he should take of each one Chief and</HI> 2 <HI>of the better
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>sort of people if he can have them;</HI> and so, the 12 being convened, he shall clear himself and his Freeborough (if he can do it) of the forfeiture and <HI>slight of the aforesaid Malefactor. Which if he could not do, he with his Freeborough should restore the loss out of the property of the malefactor as long as any should remain, failing which he should complete</HI></Q> (the restitution) <Q><HI>out of his own and that of his Free-borough,</HI> and should satisfy <HI>Justice</HI> according to what should be to them lawfully ad∣judged,</Q> &amp;c. Thus, all the honest in∣habitants of every vicinage, being an∣swerable in their own private fortunes and property for all the damages and de∣predations of robbers, house-breakers, and other lawless sons of violence, com∣mitted within their own respective districts, would, of course, be stimulated, by the urgent spur of private interest,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>to yield up a small portion of their leisure to the necessary <HI>exercise of arms and training,</HI> for their mutual defence against every act of violence and injustice; and on this ancient provision of the Common Law was apparently founded the <HI>legality</HI> of levying taxes on the inhabitants of London and Middlesex, to make good the <HI>damages</HI> occasioned by the alarming riots in the year 1780. We ought, therefore, by no means to repine at the late judgement of the Courts, whereby the Riot-Tax, to make good the damages, was deemed legal, even before the Act was made for levying it; but, on the contrary, to promote, as much as possible, a still more effectual and complete revival of that most excellent institution of the <HI>Common Law,</HI> that it may be constantly and regularly enforced (even in less and more ordinary cases of robbery, house-breaking, &amp;c.) for the immediate recovery of all <HI>damages</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>and losses by any <HI>act of violence</HI> whatso∣ever: the value of the damages should be levyed on <HI>ten housekeepers</HI> that are the nearest inhabitants to the spot where the violence or robbery was committed: and if the 10 <HI>nearest housekeepers</HI> should not be able to made good the damage, then 10 <HI>times</HI> 10 <HI>of the nearest house-keepers,</HI> (or the hundred,) ought to be assessed, (and so on, if necessary, to the whole county, for such was the an∣cient usage by the Common Law,) for the damage; whereby all housekeepers would be prompted by their own private interest to <HI>associate in arms</HI> with their respective neighbours to suppress every act of unjust violence, and to maintain the public peace.</P>
<P>In the various-accounts of these ancient Free-boroughs, or <HI>Tithings,</HI> they are sometimes mentioned, as consisting only of <HI>Ten Men;</HI> at other times, as consist∣ing
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>of <HI>"ten men and their families"</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">—<Q><HI>They be commonly named</HI> TITHINGS, <HI>be∣cause they contain (as I told you) the number of</HI> TENNE MEN WITH THEIR FAMILIES.</Q> Lambard's Du∣ties of Constables, p. 7. <HI>"This frank-pledge"</HI> (says Lord Coke) <Q><HI>consisted</HI> most commonly of <HI>ten house∣holds,</HI></Q> &amp;c. 2 Inst. p. 73.</NOTE>: and therefore as all males, from 15 to 60 years of age, are required by law <Q><HI>to have arms and to be duly exercised therein,</HI></Q> (which in a former Tract I have already proved,) the number of males in a <HI>Tithing</HI> of the latter description would amount to about <HI>thirty,</HI> (the pro∣per number for a platoon,) if the average rate of 3 males to a family might be sup∣posed a just estimation, including sons, lodgers, apprentices, journeymen, por∣ters, and servants; though this must vary in different neighbourhoods, according to the nature of the trades and occupa∣tions carried on therein, as some employ <HI>many hands,</HI> and others but very few.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>Archbishops, Bishops, Earls, Barons, and other great men, having their own proper officers, Serjeants, Esquires, But∣lers, Confectioners, Bakers, &amp;c. (see the 21 law of King Edward,) were sup∣posed to have each a <HI>Free-borough</HI> within their own households, and were there∣fore not included in the ordinary <HI>Tithings</HI>—<Q><HI>because they were a sufficient assurance for themselves and for their menial servants;</HI> no less than the ten were, one for another, in <HI>the ordinary Dozeins.</HI></Q>—See Cowell's Interpreter on the word <HI>Friburgh.</HI> This due ex∣emption of the great men, from the ob∣ligation of entering into the ordinary <HI>De∣cenaries,</HI> I wish to be particularly noticed, because it may prevent the opposition of some <HI>high-minded</HI> persons who would think themselves degraded, perhaps, by an <HI>universal</HI> establishment of the <HI>Tithings.</HI> On the quotation, last made from Dr.
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>Cowell, it is necessary to remark, that the word <HI>dozeins</HI> is manifestly used for <HI>decenns,</HI> or <HI>decenna,</HI> and so also very fre∣quently by other law writers, but I cannot find that these <HI>legal Societies,</HI> or <HI>Associations</HI> of neighbours, ever consisted of <HI>dozeins</HI> or <HI>dozens,</HI> in the ordinary sense of that term, though they are so very frequently called <HI>dozeins,</HI> merely, I pre∣sume, by corruption of speech; so that the etymology of the English word <HI>dozen</HI> is not from <HI>duodecim,</HI> as one would natu∣rally suppose from the modern applica∣tion of the word, but from <HI>decenna</HI> and <HI>dizaine,</HI> the Latin and French appella∣tions of the <HI>Tithings,</HI> which were regu∣larly <HI>Decenaries,</HI> consisting of <HI>ten men;</HI> or rather <HI>ten men</HI> and their <HI>families,</HI> as I have before remarked. But, in the re∣vival of <HI>Decenaries,</HI> which I wish to promote, the number of persons in each <HI>Free-borough or Decenary,</HI> (whether it
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>shall consist of <HI>ten housekeepers with their families and servants,</HI> or only of <HI>ten men,</HI>) must be determined by the votes of the inhabitants themselves in every neigh∣bourhood, at their several <HI>General Meet∣ings, Folk-motes,</HI> or <HI>Ward-motes;</HI> be∣cause the service must be perfectly vo∣luntary; for, though the arrangement of the people into <HI>decenary</HI> companies was actually <Q>ordained by the ancient laws of this realm,</Q> and was (and, I trust, still is) required by the <HI>common law</HI> for the whole kingdom, yet one of the most eminent <HI>common-law</HI> writers of his time (Mr. Wm Lambard) mentions the formation of these <HI>decenary</HI> companies as being <HI>the free act of the people themselves</HI> in every neighbourhood: for, according to him, the ancient usage was, that <Q><HI>all free borne men shoulde</HI> CAST THEM∣SELVES <HI>into several companies by tenne in eche companie,</HI></Q> &amp;c. (Duties of Con∣stables,
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>&amp;c. p. 7.) and our ancestors could not have had any more urgent in∣ducement, to render this service volun∣tary, than what the present generation actually feels, viz. the necessity of self-defence against <HI>rioters, thieves, robbers,</HI> and <HI>house-breakers;</HI> for, Mr. Lambard informs us, just before, in the same page, that <Q><HI>it was ordained for the more sure</HI> KEEPING OF THE PEACE, <HI>and for the better repressing of</HI> THIEVES <HI>and</HI> ROB∣BERS, <HI>that all free-born men should</HI> CAST THEMSELVES <HI>into several com∣panies,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> so that <HI>the</HI> REASON <HI>of this law,</HI> on which <HI>the</HI> FORCE of it should depend, does not only <HI>still</HI> sub∣sist, but is certainly as forcible and ur∣gent as ever it was. And, though this excellent custom was become almost ob∣solete, through neglect and disuse, so long ago as the reign of <HI>Queen Elizabeth,</HI> yet, even then, it was still considered as
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>a <HI>legal</HI> institution, required by the <HI>com∣mon law;</HI> and the renewal of it was re∣commended as easy and most efficacious for the maintenance of the public peace: "whereof" (says the learned Lambard, speaking of the ancient office of Bors∣holders, Tithingmen, &amp;c.) <Q><HI>there is yet some shew or remnant in our</HI> LEETS, <HI>or Law Days: but if the</HI> VERY SUBSTANCE THEREOF WERE <HI>throughly performed [as I know no let</HI></Q> (says that learned man, and surely <Q>no let</Q> has since been ordained) <Q>but that by law it may] then should the peace of the land be much better maintained.</Q> (Duties of Constables, &amp;c. p. 9.) There is no doubt but the effects would be as happy and beneficial as when <HI>the Tithings</HI> were first established by Alfred; for, all the old Historians agree, that an entire stop to <HI>all robbery and violence</HI> was im∣mediately effected by this regulation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"/>In the Chronicon of John Brompton, we are informed, that <Q>although laws in times of war are silent, yet King Alfred, in the midst of the clashing of arms, made laws, and instituted the <HI>Centuries,</HI> which they call <HI>Hundreds,</HI> and the <HI>Decenaries,</HI> which they call <HI>Trithings,</HI></Q> (he should have said <HI>Tithings,</HI>) <Q>maintained peace amongst his own subjects, and chastized <HI>rob∣bers</HI> in such sort, that he commanded golden bracelets to be hung up in the roads, divided into 4 ways, which might brave the avidity of passengers, whilst there was none who durst snatch them away:</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See Twisden's Hist. Anglicanae Scriptores Anti∣qui. P. 818.</P>
<P><Q>Et licet inter arma Leges sileant, ipse tamen <HI>Alu∣redus</HI> Rex inter fremitus armorum Leges tulit, et <HI>Centurias</HI> quas <HI>Hundredas</HI> dicunt, et <HI>Decurias</HI> quas <HI>Trithingas</HI></Q> (plainly an error for <HI>Tithingas</HI>) <Q>vocant instituit, pacem inter suos custodivit, et <HI>latrones</HI> in tantum castigavit, quod in semitis quae per quadri∣vium finduntur, armillas aureas jussit suspendi, quae viantium aviditatem arriderent, dum non essent qui eas arriperent.</Q></P></NOTE> and Speed also
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>tells us, from William of Malmsbury, that "His kingdom hee" (Alfred) <Q>likewise divided into <HI>Shires, Hundreds,</HI> and <HI>Ti∣things,</HI> for the better ordering and ad∣ministring of Justice, and for the abandoning of theeves, which had for∣merly increased <HI>by the meanes</HI></Q> (the very cause which at present exists) <Q><HI>of long warres;</HI> whereby, notwithstanding the multitude of Souldiers continually im∣ploied, it is reported that a <HI>Virgin</HI> might travaile alone in his daies, through all his dominions, with∣out any violence offered; and that bracelets of gold were hanged in the high waies, and no man so hardy as to take them away.</Q> P. 358.</P>
<P>The <HI>ten</HI> householders or masters of families, from whose precise number of <HI>ten</HI> the numerical appellations of <HI>De∣cenaries,
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>Tithings,</HI> and <HI>Dozeins,</HI> are ma∣nifestly derived, were themselves also individually distinguished by the title of <HI>Deciners,</HI> from the youths, journeymen, lodgers, and servants, that were in∣cluded, and respectively <HI>pledged</HI> by the <HI>householders</HI> in the several <HI>Decenaries.</HI></P>
<P>A right understanding and due appli∣cation of the term <HI>Deciner</HI> being neces∣sary, as I conceive, towards the pro∣motion of a great national object at pre∣sent, the necessary reformation of popu∣lar Representation in Parliament; I hope my readers will not think it too tedious to attend a little to the investigation of the word, that we may clear it from the indiscriminate use which some law-wri∣ters have made of it. <Q>The Circuit thereof</Q> (says Dr. Cowel in his In∣terpreter, speaking of <HI>frank-pledge</HI>) <Q><HI>was called</HI> DECENNA, <HI>because it com∣monly consisted of</HI> TEN HOUSEHOLDS:
<PB N="22" REF="21"/><HI>and every particular person, thus mu∣tually bound for himself and his neighbours, was called</HI> DECENNIER,</Q> (more commonly, I believe, <HI>Decener,</HI> and afterwards by corruption <HI>Dozener,</HI>) <Q>BECAUSE <HI>he was of one</HI> DECENNA or <HI>other.</HI></Q>—But this reason is not suffi∣ciently accurate.—The <HI>youths, servants,</HI> &amp;c. were all <Q><HI>of one</HI> DECENNA <HI>or other,</HI></Q> yet were they not <HI>Decenners,</HI> though they were also mutually bound by oath for their good behaviour in their respective <HI>Decenaries;</HI> but those men only were properly <HI>Deciners,</HI> who were more immediately responsible for all the rest, by being the <HI>masters</HI> of the several families, viz. only the TEN <HI>householders</HI> in every TITHING, who paid scot and lot, and were answerable for the pay∣ment of all <HI>national</HI> as well as <HI>provincial</HI> and <HI>parochial</HI> burthens: these only were the men, who had a <HI>judicial capacity,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>and were called altogether by the chief <HI>Freeborg,</HI> or <HI>Headborough,</HI> on all occa∣sions to consult and determine; on every question, or extraordinary business, with∣in the extent of their division. All the individuals of the division indeed were suitors in the <HI>Tithing</HI> Court, and might there be present, (as all courts were open,) and amenable thereto for offences; for the <HI>Decenna</HI> or <HI>Tithing</HI> Courts (how∣ever insignificant so confined a jurisdiction as a <HI>Tithing</HI> may appear) were of admi∣rable use in promoting <HI>Justice,</HI> and de∣ciding differences and quarrels amongst neighbours. The learned Author of the Notes on Fortescue, (folio edit. in 1741,) p. 106. speaking of <Q><HI>the Court of the Free-borough</HI> or <HI>Tithing,</HI></Q> adds, <HI>"wherein"</HI> (says he) <Q>the <HI>Tithing-man</HI> or <HI>Headborough</HI> was the JUDGE.</Q> And indeed they are intituled, in the laws of the Confessor, JUSTICIARII, JUSTICES;
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>for such was their jurisdiction and office within their <HI>Tithing.</HI> It is necessary, however, for the proper understanding of the chapter, wherein this is men∣tioned, to be previously informed, that the Latin noun, <HI>Friborgus,</HI> of the mas∣culine gender, does not properly signify a <HI>Free-Borough, Tithing,</HI> or Association of <HI>ten men,</HI> but rather one indivi∣dual <HI>Free-Borgess,</HI> of that Society: but, when the Society or Association it∣self is to be collectively understood, the word is generally, though not always,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As there is an example at the latter end of this very law in question, wherein <HI>Friborgos</HI> in all the copies is expressed instead of the accusative plural of the neuter noun, <HI>Friborga,</HI> though the subject manifestly relates to three Friburgs, or Societies, and not to three indivi∣dual <HI>Freeburgesses.</HI></NOTE> expressed in the neuter gender,—<Q>Fri∣borgum,</Q>—as Dr. Cowel rightly ex∣presses in his Interpreter, on the word, <HI>Froborgh,</HI> alias <HI>Fridburgh,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24"/>It is also manifest, by the explanation of titles given by the learned Lambard, that <HI>nine persons</HI> of the Tithing were intituled FREOBORH,

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A continuation of the 32d Law of 1st Edward, beginning from the end of the last quotation of it.—<Q>Isti inter villas &amp; vicinos causas tractabant, &amp; se∣cundum forisfacturas emendationes capiebant, &amp; con∣cordationes faciebant, videlicet, de pascuis, pratis, messibus, &amp; de litigationibus inter vicinos, &amp; innu∣merabilibus huiusmodi decertationibus que humanam fragilitatem infestant, &amp; eam incessanter oppugnant. Cum autem causae majores erumpebant, referebantur ad superiores eorum justiciarios quos supradicti sa∣pientes super eos constituerant, scilicet, super decem decanos, qúos possumus dicere centuriones, vel cen∣tenarios, eo quod super centum friborgos judica∣bunt.</Q></NOTE> (according to the Saxon laws, collected by King Edward the Confessor) <Q>TRIED CAUSES <HI>among the villages and neighbours, and according to conviction</HI></Q> (or forfeiture on trial) <HI>"took satisfaction,"</HI> (or da∣mages,) <Q><HI>and settled agreements, concern∣ing pastures, meadows, harvests, as also litigations between neighbours, and innu∣merable such like disputes, which infest the weakness of human nature, and con∣tinually annoy it. But, when causes of
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>more consequence occurred, they were re∣ferred to their superior</HI> JUSTICIARIES, <HI>whom the wise men</HI></Q> (or national coun∣cil) <Q><HI>had appointed over them, that is, over ten Deans,</HI> "(or <HI>chiefs of tens,</HI>)" <HI>whom we may call</HI>—CENTURIONS or CEN∣TENARII,</Q> (hundreders,) <Q><HI>because they had jurisdiction over</HI> AN HUNDRED FRIBORGS,</Q> i. e. an hundred Free∣burgesses or <HI>Deciners</HI>).</P>
<P>Thus, it is manifest, that the <HI>Hundreders,</HI> or <HI>High Constables,</HI> were also <HI>Justiciaries,</HI> so that every <HI>Hundred Householders,</HI> throughout the kingdom, had a complete establishment of <HI>Civil Officers,</HI> (i. e. a High Constable and ten Constables, all of whom were <HI>Justiciaries</HI> within their respective jurisdictions,) to preserve the peace and settle differences amongst themselves and their respec∣tive families. And though each, or all of these officers sat as <HI>Judges,</HI> or <HI>Preci∣dents,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>in their respective courts, yet their power was duly limited by the opinion and determination of the <HI>House∣holders,</HI> or <HI>Deciners,</HI> from whom the <HI>Juries</HI> (the real judges of the causes) were regularly chosen, and still are, to this day, in most cities and trading towns, (as in London,) without regard to any other qualification than that of their be∣ing <HI>housekeepers</HI> of the vicinage, indif∣ferent to the parties, of unblameable character, and sufficient substance, not to be suspected of undue bias; or, as it is expressed in an old form,—<Q><HI>such as be next neighbours, most sufficient, and least suspicious.</HI></Q> And in the act of 21 Edward I. there is an express clause reserving the ancient rights of <HI>Juries</HI> to <HI>cities</HI> and <HI>burghs.</HI> And, Mr. Hawkins, on mentioning this and another statute, (2 West.) remarks thereupon—<Q><HI>that, neither by common law, nor by these sta∣tutes,
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>there was any necessity in proceed∣ings before Justices in Eyre, &amp;c. that</HI> PETIT JURORS <HI>should be</HI> FREEHOL∣DERS; <HI>and, if so,</HI></Q> (says he,) <Q><HI>it seems probable that there is no greater neces∣sity that</HI> GRAND JURORS, <HI>making an enquiry before them, should be</HI> FREE∣HOLDERS; <HI>and if a</HI> GRAND JUROR <HI>before such Justices need</HI> NOT <HI>be a</HI> FREEHOLDER, <HI>why should there be a greater necessity that a</HI> GRAND JUROR <HI>before other Justices should be a</HI> FREE∣HOLDER?</Q> &amp;c. Pleas of the Crown 2d book, chap. 25. p. 217. And he repeats this doctrine in chap. 43. sect. 12. <Q><HI>That, at the common law, there was no necessity that</HI> JURORS <HI>should have</HI> ANY FREEHOLD, <HI>as to inquests before Justices in Eyre, or in cities or burghs,</HI></Q> &amp;c. whereby the <HI>judicial</HI> capacity of the Housekeepers or <HI>De∣ciners,</HI> without any qualification as <HI>Land∣holders,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>is, I trust, sufficiently established. We are misled also in the sense of the word <HI>Deciner,</HI> when it is applied (as by the learned Cowell) in a peculiar manner to the chief or head of a <HI>Tithing.</HI>—<Q><HI>It signifieth,</HI></Q> (says he,) <Q><HI>in the ancient monuments of the law, such as were wont to have the oversight and check of</HI> TEN FRIBOURGS <HI>for the maintenance of the King's peace.</HI></Q> But the <HI>Chief</HI> of the ten, as I have already shewn, had his proper titles of <HI>Headborough,</HI> and <HI>Ti∣thingman;</HI> and, though each chief was al∣ways a <HI>Deciner,</HI> as being himself <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>ten</HI> incorporated <HI>householders,</HI> yet he had no peculiar title of <HI>Deciner,</HI> any otherwise than being the chief of the <HI>Deciners</HI> in his division. The youths, and others, that were <HI>not householders,</HI> were pledged by the <HI>Deciners,</HI> as appears by Briton, cap. 12.—<Q>Volons nous que trestous ceux de xiv ans desouthe nous facent
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>le serement, &amp;c.—et velons que toutz soient en <HI>Dizeyne,</HI> et pleuys par <HI>Des∣cyners,</HI> sauve gentz de religion, clers et chevaliers, et leur fitz eynes, et femes.</Q>—<Q><HI>We will that all those which are fourteen years old shall make oath to us,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and that all shall be in</HI> TITHINGS, <HI>and pledged by Deciners,</HI></Q> &amp;c. The law could not mean that <HI>all</HI> should be pledged by the respective Head∣boroughs alone, but, certainly, by the TEN <HI>householders</HI> of each <HI>Decenary.</HI> And Dr. Cowell himself also, in the latter part of that article, says,—<Q><HI>that</HI> DECENNIER <HI>is not now used for the chief man of a</HI> DOZEN, <HI>but for him that is sworne to the King's peace;</HI></Q> neither in this is he sufficiently accurate; for the being <HI>sworn to the King's peace</HI> did not consti∣tute a <HI>Decener,</HI> in the proper sense of the word, though it included the person sworn in the jurisdiction of a <HI>Decenary.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32"/>The title of <HI>Deciner</HI> could not pro∣perly belong to any but the <HI>ten</HI> house∣holders themselves, from whose <HI>number</HI> his division was formerly called <HI>Tienman∣tale,</HI> id est, (says Mr. Lambard,) <Q><HI>Decem∣virale collegium,</HI></Q>—a <HI>society of ten men. Nine</HI> of these, as Mr. Lambard declares, were called <HI>Freoborh, (Free Burgess,)</HI> i. e. <HI>free pledges,</HI> and the tenth was called Teothungmon, (Tithingman,) i. e. <HI>De∣curio.</HI> Now, it seems the office and title of <HI>Decurio</HI> was used in Britain, long be∣fore the Saxon Kings, by the Romans, as well in their <HI>civil</HI> as their <HI>military</HI> establishments: and the learned author of the notes on the folio edition of Fortescue's excellent tract, <HI>de Laudibus Legum Angliae,</HI> observes in p. 31.—<Q><HI>that the</HI> ROMANS <HI>had their laws, in such parts of this land, as they had their most civil government in; I mean,</HI></Q> (says he,) <Q><HI>in colonies hither deduced.
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>For every colony was but an image of the mother city, with like holy rites, like courts, laws,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and for the most part with</HI> DUUMVIRI <HI>instead of Consuls, and</HI> AEDILES <HI>and</HI> DECU∣RIONES <HI>in lieu of a Senate: and it is clear</HI></Q> (says he) <Q><HI>that divers colonies from Rome were in Britain, as at Ca∣melodunum, now Malden in Essex,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The consideration of this circumstance enables us to propose a much more pro∣bable etymology of the English word <HI>Denizen</HI> than what is generally assigned. Lord Coke supposes it from <Q><HI>deins nee, born within;</HI></Q> and also from <HI>Do∣naison,</HI> <Q>because the freedom <HI>is given by the King.</HI></Q> But a learned writer (Davies) asserts, that <Q><HI>Denizen is a British law term, which the Saxons and Angles found here and retained.</HI></Q> It could not, therefore, be derived from
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>the <HI>French</HI> tongue, before that modern language was known, or even formed.</P>
<P>Neither is the <HI>Welch</HI> etymology of it at all satisfactory, because it seems very uncouth, and not sufficiently similar in sound to the word. But, if we derive the word immediately from the <HI>Latin,</HI> it will appear most natural and easy, both in <HI>sound</HI> and <HI>sense;</HI> for, the word <HI>Deni,</HI> being derived <HI>à Decem pro Deceni,</HI> is a proper adjective expressive of its relation to the number of <HI>ten</HI> persons in a <HI>Decenary;</HI> and, as the Romans had their <HI>Decuriones,</HI> and consequently <HI>Decenaries</HI> also, a proper <HI>Latin</HI> verb to express the initia∣tion or introduction of a person to the privileges and franchises of a <HI>Decenary,</HI> is very naturally formed from the word <HI>Deni,</HI> viz. <HI>Denizo,</HI> which verb and its derivatives are frequently used by our law-writers, when they speak of the admission of <HI>Aliens</HI> to the franchises
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>of the native inhabitants; and, the said <HI>franchises</HI> being maintained in ancient times by mutual <HI>frank-pledge</HI> in the se∣veral <HI>Decenaries,</HI> it is obvious, that the participle <HI>"Denizatus,"</HI> which frequent∣ly occurs, and the derived noun-substan∣tive <HI>"Denizatio,"</HI> are applied in such cases in their proper <HI>Latin</HI> sense; though the law-writers, who used them, have overlooked that most obvious etymology, which is confirmed by the <HI>sound</HI> as well as the true <HI>Latin sense</HI> of those terms.</P>
<P>Lord Coke says <Q><HI>Denizen</HI> is taken for an alien born, that is <HI>infranchised,</HI> or DENIZATED by Letters Patent, where∣by the King doth grant unto him, that in all things he should be reputed, esteem∣ed, held, and governed, as our liege sub∣ject, sprung up</Q> (from his ancestors) <Q>within our said kingdom of England, and not otherwise, nor in any other manner.</Q> And he cites Dier, in the same page, 1 Inst. lib. 2. p. 129. respecting this
<PB N="37" REF="36"/><HI>ligeance</HI> of <HI>Denizens,</HI> <Q>Ligentia Domino Regi debita, &amp;c. Data (est) aut per <HI>denizationem,</HI> aut <HI>per naturaliza∣tionem.</HI></Q>—When foreigners, therefore, were admitted to the privileges and fran∣chises of Englishmen, they became the King's <HI>liege</HI> subjects,—<Q><HI>esse ad fidem Regi Angliae,</HI></Q> and were of course <HI>deni∣zated,</HI> or admitted to be members of some <HI>Decenary,</HI> and would be sworn to their ligeance in common with other sub∣jects in the court of <HI>frank-pledge;</HI> and if the <HI>denizated</HI> stranger rented a house, and payed scot and lot, and other rates, he became a <HI>Frioborh,</HI> or <HI>Freeburgess,</HI> having a right to vote for Representatives in <HI>the national Council:</HI> so that Lord Coke was certainly right in using the terms <HI>infranchised,</HI> and <HI>denizatus,</HI> as synonymous: for the <Q><HI>renting of a house, at a certain rent, by the year,</HI></Q> is the ancient legal description of <HI>burgage
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>tenure. "It is called</HI> BURGH," (says Sir Edward Coke,) <Q><HI>because it sendeth</HI> BURGESSES <HI>to Parliament.</HI></Q> And, though this is not the proper derivation of the word, it is certainly the <HI>usage</HI> of <HI>borough,</HI> and as well as the <HI>right of all Burgesses.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"They that have tenements"</HI> (says Littleton) <Q><HI>within the Burrough (or Burgh) hold of the King their tenements, and every tenant for his tenement ought to pay to the King</HI> A CERTAIN RENT BY THE YEAR.</Q>— 1 Inst. lib. 2. c. 10. sect. 162. The next section declares the same doctrine, concerning those who <HI>rent</HI> of any other Lord. <Q><HI>And the same manner is, where another Lord spiritual or temporal is Lord of such a</HI> BURROUGH, <HI>and the</HI> TENANTS OF THE TENEMENTS <HI>in such a Borough, hold of their Lord,</HI> TO PAY EACH OF THEM YEARLY AN ANNUAL
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>RENT.</Q> Sect. 163. <Q><HI>And it is called</HI> TENURE IN BURGAGE,</Q> (says Little∣ton,) <Q><HI>for that the tenements within the Burrough be</HI> HOLDEN OF THE LORD OF THE BURROUGH BY CER∣TAINE RENT, &amp;c. <HI>And it is, to wit, that the ancient townes, called</HI> BURROUGHES, BE THE MOST AN∣CIENT TOWNES THAT BE IN ENG∣LAND; <HI>for the townes, that now be</HI> CITIES OR COUNTIES, <HI>in old time were</HI> BOROUGHES, and <HI>called</HI> BOROUGHES, <HI>for of such old townes, called</HI> BO∣ROUGHES, CAME THE BURGESSES OF THE PARLIAMENT, <HI>when the King hath summoned his Parliament.</HI></Q> Sect. 164.</P>
<P>Now, this description of paying <Q><HI>an annual rent,</HI></Q> or <Q><HI>holding tenements by certain rent by the year,</HI></Q> is the pro∣per distinction of a tenant <HI>in Burgage</HI> from a <HI>tenant at will,</HI> because the latter
<PB N="40" REF="39"/><HI>"hath no certain nor sure estate,"</HI> (says Littleton,) <Q><HI>for the Lessor may put him out at what time it pleaseth him.</HI></Q> Lib. 1. c. viii. § 68. But very different is the case of <HI>tenants for years,</HI> (as Littleton remarks in the same Chapter,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>Otherwise it is if tenant for yeares, which knoweth the end of his terme, doth sowe the land,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Ibid.</NOTE>) and those persons who agree with the owners of their houses at a <HI>certain rent,</HI> howsoever small, for any <HI>fixed time,</HI> if it be but for <HI>half a year,</HI> or even for a <HI>quarter of a year,</HI> are never∣theless to be esteemed in law as <Q><HI>tenants for years,</HI></Q> (<Q>quod tenent ad terminum annorum.</Q> Lib. 1. C. 7. Sect. 67.) For they enjoy a free and <HI>certain</HI> posses∣sion to the end of the <HI>agreed term,</HI> so that their <HI>tenure is perfectly free;</HI> and they have sometimes been intituled <HI>"Liberi Tenentes,"</HI> and <HI>Freeholders,</HI> in contradistinction to <HI>tenants in villanage,</HI> though they are indeed <HI>freholders</HI> in a
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>very different sense from the common acceptation of the term <HI>freeholder,</HI> now applied only to those who are properly <HI>land owners;</HI> which would therefore be a less equivocal title for them; the others being also <HI>freeholders,</HI> or <HI>free tenants,</HI> though in a less durable <HI>tenure.</HI> But, their ancient indisputable RIGHT, of <HI>send∣ing Burgesses to Parliament,</HI> proves their <HI>freedom,</HI> as members of the community. In the <HI>Borough</HI> of Southwark, and many others to this day, <HI>the renters</HI> of tene∣ments, or <HI>housekeepers in general,</HI> paying scot and lot, are the Electors of the De∣puties to Parliament; so that the doc∣trine is unquestionable. And, in the City of Westminster, and several other an∣cient cities, the same RIGHT, by <HI>bur∣gage tenure,</HI> of voting for Representatives, prevails to this day; because, <HI>all Cities</HI> were originally deemed. <HI>Boroughs,</HI> as being the habitations of <HI>freo-borges,</HI> or
<PB N="42" REF="41"/><HI>free pledges,</HI> i. e. the associated <HI>house∣holders,</HI> who were mutually <HI>pledged</HI> to maintain the public peace, and defend and support the due execution of the laws: and, if the right of voting were fully restored, throughout the kingdom, to all <HI>householders,</HI> or <HI>masters of families,</HI> who principally support the burthens of the state, even if the franchise should descend no lower, it would be amply sufficient, I trust, to destroy the present deplorable corruption in the representa∣tion, or rather the <HI>mis-representation,</HI> of the Commons, and to restore the ancient dignity and freedom of Parliament; especially if all the said <HI>householders</HI> were duly incorporated as <HI>Deciners</HI> or <HI>Free-Borhes,</HI> in their respective neighbour∣hoods.</P>
<P>For then the number of <HI>Deciners</HI> or <HI>Free∣holders</HI> in each county would be regularly known, howsoever much the numbers
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>of other males in the several <HI>Tithings</HI> might vary; and the advantage of this <HI>regularity of numbers</HI> would not only be the effecting a proportionable <HI>regularity of manners,</HI> but it would also greatly fa∣cilitate the much wished-for measure of a <HI>more equal representation of the people;</HI> nay, the representation may be made not only <HI>more equal,</HI> but <HI>most equal</HI> or <HI>per∣fectly equal,</HI> if all <HI>Deciners</HI> in each county were allowed to vote, as unques∣tionably, in justice and constitutional right, they ought to do: for, the junction of ten <HI>equal</HI> hundreds of <HI>Deciners</HI> into one associated body would form the court of the <HI>thousand,</HI> well known in the Is∣raelitish commonwealth; which, consi∣dered as a proportionable <HI>division</HI> of a county, perfectly regular in numerical order, both of Officers and other <HI>Deci∣ners,</HI> would much facilitate the conduct∣ing and ordering of public business.
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>And <HI>two</HI> such divisions, of <HI>a thousand Deciners each,</HI> would be a proper num∣ber to send <HI>one Deputy</HI> to Parliament, according to the present population of the kingdom, so as not to exceed, but rather diminish, the present number of representatives. Thus, a <HI>most equal repre∣sentation of all the families in the kingdom</HI> would be obtained; and <HI>two thousand</HI> families (one with another) might well afford to pay ample wages to <HI>one</HI> Repre∣sentative; and the stipend might be very easily collected, if the <HI>Decenaries</HI> were duly formed and established, and the several courts, which regularly arise from the <HI>Decenaries,</HI> viz. the <HI>Hundred</HI> Courts, and also the Courts of <HI>one Thousand</HI> fa∣milies each, above proposed; and lastly, the junction of <HI>two</HI> such <HI>Courts of the Thousand,</HI> for the election of <HI>one</HI> Repre∣sentative in the great Common Council of the Realm. The people, of whatever
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>parties, or separate interests, might go up altogether with their separate <HI>Tithings,</HI> or by their <HI>Hundreds,</HI> to the Poll Books, (in like manner as the ancient Romans voted by their <HI>Centuries,</HI>) by which means <HI>order</HI> would be preserved, and no persons would be permitted to vote, but those that were <HI>known</HI> to <HI>dwell</HI> and <HI>reside</HI> in the place, or county, where the election is made, according to an ancient rule of the constitution; <Q><HI>eligantur in quolibet comitatu per homines in eodem comitatu commorantes et residentes:</HI></Q> See my Tract on <HI>Equitable Representation,</HI> &amp;c. p. 26 and 27; and also an Act of Parlia∣ment there quoted, which is still in force, 1 Hen. V. c. 1. It is therefore an act of gross corruption, utterly re∣pugnant to the ancient constitution of the kingdom, to bear <HI>the travelling charges of voters</HI> who dwell in distant places; for such ought not to be permit∣ted
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>to vote at all, except on the spot where they reside, by which not only <HI>much expence</HI> would be saved to the Can∣didates, but also much immorality, de∣bauchery, and tumult, against the public peace at elections,

<P>"But how is he" (a Negro claimed by a <HI>Slaveholder</HI> as private property) "to be divested of his <HI>human na∣ture?</HI> or of his just right to the King's protection?</P>
<P>"A man may, indeed, be said to be divested of his <HI>humanity,</HI> 1st, in a moral sense, by his own action, in stooping to any kind of baseness beneath the dignity of a <HI>man.</HI> And, 2dly, by the execution of the laws, in punishment of some particular kinds of baseness, for which a man may <HI>lawfully</HI> be divested of his huma∣nity by a <HI>civil death:</HI> that is, may be <Q><HI>disabled to hold any office or franchise,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> <Q><HI>as if such person was naturally dead.</HI></Q> This is one of the penalties ex∣pressed in a Statute (2 Geo. II. ch. 24.) against bribery and corruption in Parliamentary Elections, whereby, not less the <HI>Briber</HI> than the <HI>Bribed,</HI> (whether the of∣fence be committed <Q><HI>by himself or any person employed by him</HI></Q>) is subjected to the divesture abovemen∣tioned. But the vilest and most ignorant Negro Slaves are not so <HI>inhumanly</HI> base and degenerate as these Time∣servers, who offend against God! the King! their friends and fellow subjects! themselves! and all their unhappy posterity, even the children that are unborn! They are enemies to the State, infinitely more to be dreaded, than the most puissant foreign power at open war!</P>
<P>"No shuffling arts or equivocations whatsoever can lighten this monstrous load of guilt, for which the of∣fenders must <HI>one day</HI> most certainly be called to account, notwithstanding that they may have escaped the penal∣ties of this English Statute: for indeed it is merely the penalties (or execution) of the said Statute which they escape and not the guilt of breaking it; because the same is so warily drawn up, that there is not the least room for mental reservation.</P>
<P>"A very large proportion of the freeholders in this kingdom, it is to be feared, are involved in this horrid guilt! Nay every elector who hath but even EATEN or DRUNK at the expence of another, during the time of an election, is likewise in some measure guilty! (though charity will incline us to suppose that their offence is, for the most part, occasioned by ignorance, rather than wilful corruption;) for, not only money, but also any <Q>Gift, Office, Imployment, or OTHER REWARD WHATSOEVER</Q> is forbid by the said Act.

Bribes in mo∣ney, places, &amp;c. are not productive of half so much evil as the debaucheries of <HI>election entertainments,</HI> be∣cause the pernicious effects of the latter are so perma∣nent, that they may fairly be said to be transmitted from <HI>election</HI> to <HI>election.</HI> The gross immorality, as well as the deplorable idleness and poverty, (all forerunners of slavery) which too much prevail in many parts of this kingdom ought, (I sincerely believe) to be principally attributed to the unlawful practice of <HI>opening houses for public entertainment at elections:</HI> and we cannot hope that this dangerous evil will ever be corrected, unless the wisdom of the legislature shall hereafter think fit to oblige every candidate (as soon as he declares him∣self such) to promise, upon oath, that he will strictly ob∣serve every article of the last mentioned Act, against treating electors. This long digression, from the subject of Negro Slaves, the author hopes may be pardoned, especially if the reader will please to consider, that ci∣vil and political Slavery, as well as Slavery to sensual appetites, are so very nearly connected with each other, in their nature and effects, that it is no very considerable transition from the present point to speak of them together. But the case of this poor Negro is very dif∣ferent. If he is a Slave, yet it was not with his own consent that he was made so. He neither <HI>sold himself,</HI> nor has he <HI>betrayed others,</HI> and cannot therefore be liable to such severe penalties. He has not been guilty of any offences, that I know of, for which he might <HI>lawfully</HI> (like corrupt and venal voters who accept of money, meat, or drink, at elections) <HI>be divested of his humanity;</HI> and therefore it must certainly be allowed, that he dif∣fers from a horse or a dog in this very <HI>essential point,</HI> viz. <HI>his humanity."</HI></P></NOTE> would be prevented.</P>

<P>The million of <HI>Householders</HI> would form exactly ONE THOUSAND divisions of <HI>one thousand Householders</HI> each, viz. 1000 <HI>Courts of the Thousand,</HI> which I have before recommended from ancient exam∣ple: and the junction of <HI>two</HI> such <HI>Courts of the Thousand,</HI> for the election of <HI>one</HI> Member of Parliament, as before pro∣posed, would form 500 Courts of <HI>two thousand Householders</HI> each, which would elect <HI>five hundred Representatives</HI> for South Britain; a proportion sufficiently near to the number 513, at present elected for that part of the king∣dom; because a reduction in number, would, perhaps, be more beneficial than otherwise; for certain it is, that the an∣cient
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>Parliaments were not near so nu∣merous as at present, even without reckoning the Deputies from North Britain.</P>
<P>This plan would indeed occasion some variation in modes and forms, but no real <HI>innovation</HI> with respect to the national constitution; because the <HI>right of election</HI> would still be vested where it ought, viz. in ALL <HI>the free Householders,</HI> or Freo-borges, of ALL <HI>the counties;</HI> and that, in the most <HI>perfect proportion of equality</HI> that can be desired; which ought surely to recommend the proposal, if <HI>equal representation</HI> is at all a worthy object,—if <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>right</HI> are to be pre∣ferred to their opposite extremes, <HI>in-equity</HI> or iniquity, and <HI>tort,</HI> which have too long prevailed;—or lastly, if we have honesty or humanity enough left amongst us, in the fear of God, to <HI>reject the evil and choose the good,</HI> i. e. to ex∣ercise

<P>In all these various divisions of the people, regular courts were anciently held for the maintenance of <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> and for adjusting all differences amongst neighbours, <HI>without expence;</HI> for, there was no cause or contest of such magnitude and importance, for which a popular court of proportionable dignity could not be found in the larger divisions of Wappentakes, Trithings, and Shires, to adjust and determine it; whereby tedious and vexatious lawsuits, and the ruinous expences attending them, were happily avoided. In like manner, <HI>the general Assemblies,</HI> or <HI>Congregations,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>held in the gates of the Israelites, while under the theocracy, were esteemed <HI>courts for justice and judgement;</HI> wherein presided <HI>Judges and Officers, that were freely elected</HI> by the inhabitants of each city or district, as I have elsewhere shewn (see p. 3-5.); and the same reason∣able mode of settling private differences, by the <HI>Congregation,</HI> (or Church,) was not unknown, even among Heathen Nations. The people of Ephesus, it seems, retained this salutary constitution of popular liberty, even when under the yoke of the Roman <HI>Beast;</HI> and had a power of holding popular assemblies, (called <HI>Ecclesia,</HI> or Church,) for resol∣ving difficult questions and disputes be∣tween individuals, besides the ordinary Courts of Justice, under the <HI>Roman De∣puties,</HI> for common offences. This ap∣pears by the speech of the Town Clerk <PB N="56" REF="55"/>of Ephesus, (recorded in Acts xix. 37-39.) who, after he had appeased the tumult and confusion of the people, that had hastily run together, without notice or summons to specify the cause of assem∣bling; he said—<Q><HI>Ye have brought hither these men,</HI></Q> (meaning two of Paul's companions whom they had seized,) <Q><HI>which are neither robbers of Churches, nor yet blasphemers of your Goddess. Wherefore, if Demetrius, and the crafts∣men which are with him, have a matter against any man,</HI> THE LAW IS OPEN,</Q> (or rather—the court-days are held,) <Q><HI>and there are</HI> DEPUTIES: <HI>let them implead one another.

<P>This true etymology of the word <HI>Pontifex</HI> proves that it is <HI>foreign</HI> and inapplicable to any office or dignity in the <HI>Church of Christ;</HI> though Latin writers, since the middle of the sixth century, have industriously substi∣tuted it for <HI>Episcopus,</HI> the proper official title of <HI>Christian Bishops.</HI> Near twenty years after the time that the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors lost this title of <HI>unlimited</HI> and <HI>illegal</HI> power by the <HI>sword</HI> of ODOACER, it was wickedly assumed by Pope <HI>Gelasius,</HI> and afterwards by Anastasius the second, and other succeeding Popes, as the learned <HI>Anthony Van Dale</HI> has proved in the second of his nine Dissertations, p. 192. Nevertheless, <HI>the wounded head</HI> could not be said to be completely <HI>healed,</HI> (and consequently the com∣mencement of 1260 years of <HI>bestial</HI> power could not take place,) whilst the <HI>regal</HI> power of the <HI>Heruli,</HI> of the Gothes, or of the Greek Emperor, by his Exarchs, were possessed of <HI>the throne of the Beast.</HI> But, <HI>before</HI> the time of Pope Gregory, three of the first national regal governments, or horns, (without reckoning the go∣vernment of the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperors, which does not so properly fall under that description, because it was cotemporary with the <HI>former</HI> empire,) which sprang up from the ruins of the <HI>Imperial Pontifex Maximus,</HI> had actually possessed themselves of the <HI>imperial</HI> city by <HI>conquest,</HI> and again had successively lost their domi∣nion, being fundamentally destroyed, and <HI>"plucked up by the roots,"</HI> viz. the kingdom of the Vandals, from Africa under Genseric, that of the Heruli under Odo∣acer, and that of the Ostrogoths, from Theodoric to Tottilas and Theias. And, as soon as these <HI>three horns were fallen</HI> from their power in the <HI>bloody city,</HI> Pope <HI>Pelagius</HI> (a name which signifies DIVISION, as much as the name of the ancient <HI>Peleg</HI> or <HI>Phalec, "for in his days was the earth divided,"</HI>) was emboldened publicly to avow and establish a system of <HI>religious persecution</HI> and <HI>compulsion,</HI> in order to give effectual weight to papal decisions; for he ordained, <Q><HI>that Haeretics and Schismatics might be coerced by the</HI> SECULAR ARM, <HI>when they could not be drawn to wholesome doctrine by arguments.</HI></Q>—<Q>Ut haeretici et schismatici coerceri etiam SECULARI MANU possent: quando ad sanitatem rationibus non deducerentur.</Q> (Platinae hist. de vitis pontificum, p. xxxiii. b.) And Pope Gregory was so confident in this <HI>pontifical</HI> system of the SECULAR ARM, (as well as all his successors, who have generally been adroit in engaging the neighbouring powers to avenge the <HI>Papal</HI> quarrels, occasionally, one upon another,) that he was not content merely to <HI>rebuke,</HI> but dared even to <HI>affront,</HI> the Greek Emperor <HI>Mauricius,</HI> by contumeliously <HI>taunting</HI> him with his <HI>very low descent, ex infima sorte "hominum,"</HI> said Gregory. See Platinae hist p. xxxv.</P>
<P>We need not wonder, therefore, at his boldness, in usurping an <HI>unlimited</HI> authority over the poor <HI>unarmed</HI> Italian BISHOPS, (who were otherwise his equals in real dignity of office,) deposing them <Q><HI>according to his will,</HI></Q> (a manifest token of the Beast,) and openly violating the most sacred <HI>rights</HI> of the Italian CLERGY, AND PEOPLE, in their <HI>episcopal</HI> elections, that he might fill the Italian sees with <HI>Monkish</HI> Prelates, who would be more attached to the growing power than <HI>married Bishops,</HI> such as were, for the most part, those of the primi∣tive Church. But the particular instance, which I propo∣sed to mention, was at Rimini, in the year 591, where, on the death of a Bishop, Gregory sent a legate to interfere in the <HI>election;</HI> and one Odeatinus, a nobleman, being never∣theless <HI>elected</HI> Bishop, the <HI>Pontif was pleased</HI> (PLACU∣ISSET PONTIFICI) to command them, on pain of <HI>ponti∣fical censure,</HI> to place <HI>another person</HI> in the see. The man <HI>elected</HI> and <HI>consecrated</HI> for this purpose by Gregory was Castorius, who, not being <HI>elected</HI> by the people of Rimini, was of course thwarted by them, and suffered many things by PARTY OPPOSITION, the very evil which Gregory pretended to avoid by his MOST PAR∣TIAL <HI>corruption</HI> of the election, <Q>ne illam, i. e. <HI>elec∣tionem,</HI> STUDIA PARTIUM <HI>corrumperent,</HI></Q> for that was his plea for interference. Besides this opposition, Castorius was grievously afflicted with a distemper in his head, on account of which he was invited by the <HI>Pontif</HI> to change the air and visit him at Rome; but, being even there no better, he requested the Pontif that a Pastor might be sent to his church, who could better promote the divine service; and, when the Pontif's hope of Castorius's recovery by the Roman air abated, he administered the charge of the church of Rimini by Leontius, Bishop of Urbin, (a second usurpation,) who was also a Bishop of <HI>his own</HI> appointment. In the mean while the sick <HI>Castorius</HI> urged the Pontif with his entreaties; and at length prevailed on him to grant "POWER TO THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE" of Rimini to <HI>"elect a Bishop for themselves,"</HI> (i. e. to be re-instated in their ancient <HI>right,</HI>) <Q>which was done <HI>in the year</HI> 595,</Q> <HI>as may easily be known</HI> (says my author) <Q><HI>from the Epistles of Gregory the Great;</HI></Q> and he refers us to the <HI>decretals,</HI> where the whole affair (says he) is re∣lated.

D. 517, in concilio Taraconenfi, &amp;c. <Q>That Nullus Episcopus vel infra positus,</Q> (or official,) <Q>die Dominico causas judicare praesumat.

But, when the Bishops began to supply both places, and to be meer Judges of secular courts, then were they <HI>prohi∣hited</HI> by many Canons.</Q> This <HI>prohibition</HI> of the <HI>Canons,</HI> however, had generally a very different object in view from the ostensible or pretended motive of their being ordained. I speak of the <HI>later</HI> Canons. The <HI>ancient</HI> Canons confirmed the <HI>rights</HI> of the CLERGY and PEOPLE in <HI>episcopal elections, marriage,</HI> &amp;c. but some of the <HI>later</HI> Canons, on the contrary, favoured the encroach∣ments of tyranny and papal apostacy.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the <HI>ancient</HI> Canons (commonly called <HI>Apostolical</HI>) it is ordained, that <Q><HI>if any Bishop, Priest, or Deacon,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>should abstain from</HI> MAR∣RIAGE, FLESH, and WINE, <HI>not on account of</HI></Q> (religious) "DIS∣CIPLINE," (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>exercitation</HI>—which was only <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—<HI>"for a time, that they might give themselves to fasting and prayer,"</HI> as allowed by the Apostle, 1 Cor. vii. 5; under an express injunction that married persons should <Q><HI>come together again, lest Satan should tempt them,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>through their</HI></Q> (natural) <HI>"weakness;"</HI> it being manifest that such mere <HI>temporary discipline</HI> is alone to be understood in this place,) "<HI>but through</HI> DEFILEMENT, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (i. e. through pretence that <HI>marriage,</HI> or <HI>meats,</HI> DEFILED the body,) <Q><HI>forgetful that all things are exceeding good, and that</HI> GOD <HI>made</HI> MAN, <HI>male</HI> and <HI>female, and</HI></Q> (viz. by this doctrine of defilement) <Q><HI>blaspheming the Creator, either let him be</HI> REFORMED,</Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <Q><HI>or let him be deposed,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> See Canon li.

But some of the <HI>later</HI> Canons, on the contrary, invade the most <HI>natural rights</HI> of humanity. The Council of Carthage, held about the time of Pope Caelestine, (A. D. 397,) Commanded <HI>Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, to hold chastity,</HI> and to <Q><HI>abstain</HI> (ETIAM AB UXORIBUS) <HI>even from their wives.</HI></Q> See Howel's Synop. Canonum, p. 117. So the 12th Canon of the council, held <HI>in Trullo</HI> of the Imperial Palace of Justinian the Second at Constantinople, censures the Prelates of Africa and Libya, who <Q><HI>after their ordination did</HI> NOT <HI>refuse to live with their own proper wives, thereby</HI></Q> (say the <HI>infatuated</HI> authors of the Canon) "<HI>occasioning offence and scandal to the people,</HI> &amp;c."—and therefore this Canon ordains <HI>"that the like"</HI> (i.e. men living with their <HI>own proper married wives,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <Q><HI>should</HI> NOT <HI>by any means after that time be done!!!</HI></Q> And the learned Theodore Balsamon, Patriarch of Antioch, in the twelfth century, cites several constitutions of the Emperor Justinian the First, which were called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i.e. <HI>novellae,</HI> or novelties, (an ominous title)—which or∣dained that a man <Q><HI>was not to be promoted to episcopal dignity who has a wife or children,</HI></Q> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;" (a glaring op∣position to the rules laid down in scripture for the choice of a Bishop;) and again, <HI>"that Bishops are to be deposed who dwell with a woman,"</HI>— <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. See the Paris Edition of Balsamon's Commentary on the Canons, p. 373, 421, and 374. Thus the Authors of some of the <HI>later Canons</HI> are <HI>marked</HI> with a manifest stain of <HI>apostacy,</HI> as men infatuated and deluded by the <HI>wiles of Satan,</HI> who holds them <HI>"forth to open shame,"</HI> by the evidence of their own Canons, as teachers of <HI>"the doctrines of Demons,"</HI> viz. <HI>"forbidding to marry,"</HI> (and commanding) <HI>"to abstain from meats,"</HI> &amp;c. of which devices and doctrines the Apostle hath given express warning. (See 1 Tim. iv. 1-6.) So that the almost universal prevalence of these <HI>open marks</HI> of <HI>apostacy,</HI> throughout Christendom, against the <HI>express warning of holy scripture,</HI> against the strictest cautions of the <HI>ancient apostolic Canons,</HI> and even against <HI>nature itself,</HI> is so <HI>wonderfully</HI> extraordinary, that it would be really <HI>incredible,</HI> were not the evidences of it, which still exist, no∣torious and undeniable!!! The <HI>natural</HI> depravity of mankind tends not to such effects, so that we can attribute it only to <HI>supernatural</HI> agents; and, though many of the boasted <HI>monkish revelations</HI> were really mere <HI>human</HI> forgeries, yet I believe that many others were real <HI>apparitions of seducing spirits,</HI> in order to hasten the <HI>unnatural apostacy!</HI></NOTE> But, with re∣spect to the present points, viz. the duty of <HI>Bishops</HI> to preside in the <HI>congregational courts</HI> of common law, and the people's ancient <HI>right</HI> of judging <HI>ecclesiastical causes</HI> therein, the learned SELDEN bears still more ample testimony in his <HI>"Titles of Honour."</HI> P. 520. <Q>And the <HI>Scyregemot</HI> (which was,</Q> says he,—<Q>a court kept twice every year, as the Sheriffs turn is at this day) was held by THE BISHOP of THE DIOCESS, and <HI>the</HI> EALDORMAN, (in shires that had <HI>Ealdormen,</HI>) and by the BISHOPS <HI>and</HI> SHERIFFS, in such as were committed to Sheriffs that were immediate to the King. And so</Q> (says he) <Q><HI>both</HI> THE ECCLESIAS∣TICAL <HI>and</HI> TEMPORAL LAWS were TOGETHER <HI>given in charge to the country.</HI></Q> The authorities cited by Mr. Seldon for this are as follow:—<Q>Videsis Leg.

But the <HI>later</HI> Bishops, chosen by the <HI>usurpers</HI> of <HI>episcopal elections</HI> for very different purposes, and selected, for the most part, from the <HI>monastic</HI> or∣ders, then falsely called <HI>regular,</HI> (instead of the <HI>regular</HI> parochial <HI>priesthood,</HI>) did as <HI>naturally</HI> become the dangerous advo∣cates for very different <HI>interests,</HI> the <HI>in∣terests</HI> of their usurping <HI>constituents,</HI> whether <HI>monkish</HI> or <HI>monarchical;</HI> and, more especially, about the time of Rich∣ard II. when the notorious forgery above∣mentioned was committed.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="82"/>The courts of the <HI>congregation</HI> were also, by this detestable forgery, cheated of <HI>the power of excommunicating</HI> irreli∣gious and prophane persons from their <HI>own</HI> body or society; a <HI>power</HI> most es∣sentially their <HI>own,</HI> but which, lodged where it is at present, merely with the Bishops of a reformed Church, (who want it not for <HI>undue</HI> purposes like the <HI>papal</HI> prelates,) neither promotes <HI>episcopal dignity</HI> nor due <HI>ecclesiastical authority;</HI> because <HI>eccle∣siastical</HI> judgements and censures, by flow∣ing in an improper channel, have excited, and ever will excite, the jealousy of the people; and, of course, they have been generally thwarted and opposed in our courts of <HI>common law,</HI> (through a just jealousy, in the courts, of the Bishop's <HI>separate consistories,</HI>) and have sometimes been reversed and annulled with heavy costs and damages against the <HI>ecclesiastical judge,</HI> or, perhaps, (what is worse,)

<PB N="92" REF="93"/>though these antient congregational courts have unhappily fallen into disuse, yet the

<P>Fleta in this chapter expresly quotes <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and gives a tran∣script of the 35th chapter of it, word for word, with very little variation, except what may enable us to <HI>correct</HI> the com∣mon printed copies of that noble charter, wherein we frequently find the word <HI>"trithinga"</HI> inserted instead of <Q><HI>tithin∣ga,</HI></Q> the proper word, which is ma∣nifest from the various reading in Fleta of the same import, though in the plural number, viz. <HI>"decennae,"</HI> i. e. <HI>tithings.</HI> The English version, commonly printed
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>in the Statute Books, has also, indeed, the word <HI>"trything"</HI> instead of <HI>tithing;</HI> and Sir Edward Coke, in his commentary on that chapter, calls the word three or four times <HI>"trithinga"</HI> though he has copied it right in the chapter itself. (See his 2d Inst. p. 69.) <Q>— <HI>et quod</HI> TI∣THINGA <HI>teneatur integra sicut esse consuevit,</HI> &amp;c. — <HI>and let the</HI> TI∣THING <HI>be kept entire as it hath been accustomed to be.</HI></Q> I have a copy of Magna Charta, printed for the Stationers Company in 1618, which has the same true reading <Q>—<HI>et quod</HI> TITHINGA <HI>teneatur integra,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> and this reading is still farther proved by Sir Edward Coke's commentary upon it; <Q><HI>trithinga,</HI> or <HI>tithinga,</HI></Q> (says he,) <Q>is expound∣ed for <HI>theothinga,</HI> which signifieth the <HI>Frankpledge</HI> of <HI>tenne households,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> It is manifest therefore that the
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>maintaining <HI>the tithings entire</HI> is expressly ordained by Magna Charta; so that we have <HI>statute law,</HI> (the most <HI>respectable statute</HI> that was ever made,) as well as <HI>common law,</HI> to justify the <HI>re-establishment</HI> of the <HI>tithings</HI> throughout the kingdom without having the least need to make a new act for that purpose. It is already <HI>the law,</HI> and the sheriffs and other ma∣gistrates, who do not inforce it, by hold∣ing the annual view of <HI>Frankpledge</HI> for the <HI>legal</HI> purpose of <HI>maintaining the ti∣things entire,</HI> as directed by <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> are certainly deficient in their duty, and ought to be duly <HI>amerced</HI> by the crown for their neglect of the most beneficial law, both to the king and people, that was ever made; and, the more especially ought they to be <HI>amerced,</HI> if any <HI>riots</HI> or notorious robberies shall have happened within their respective jurisdictions, du∣ring
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>the time of their being in office, because these, in all human probability, would have been prevented, as well as the damages occasioned by them, had the sheriffs done their duty in <HI>completing the tithings,</HI> at an <HI>annual View of Frank∣pledge,</HI> as the law directs. See the whole chapter concerning the <HI>View of Frank∣pledge</HI> and other popular Courts, as in∣serted in the common statute books, 9. Henrici III. cap. 35. <Q>No COUN∣TY COURT from henceforth shall be holden, but <HI>from moneth to moneth;</HI> and where greater time hath been used, there shall be greater: nor any <HI>sheriff</HI> or his <HI>bailiff</HI> shall keep his <HI>turn</HI> in the HUNDRED, but <HI>twice in the year:</HI> and no where but in due place and accustomed, that is to say, <HI>once</HI> after <HI>Easter,</HI> and again after the Feast of Saint <HI>Michael.</HI> And <HI>the View of</HI> FRANKPLEDGE shall be likewise
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>at the Feast of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> without occasion. So that every man may have his liberties, which he had, or used to have in the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> our grandfather, or which he hath pur∣chased since. The <HI>View of</HI> FRANK∣PLEDGE <HI>shall be so done that our peace may be kept.</HI> And that the TRYTHING</Q> (for TITHING, as I have already proved) <Q><HI>may be wholly kept,</HI></Q> (or, rather, <HI>be kept entire,</HI> or <HI>complete,</HI> which may easily be done, by means of the annual <HI>View of Frankpledge,</HI>) <Q>as it hath been accustomed. And that the sheriff seek no occasions, and that he be content with so much as the sheriff was wont to have for his <HI>view∣making</HI> in the time of King Henry our grandfather.</Q> And perhaps the sheriff's fees for this <HI>"view-making"</HI> would be the only part of the business
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>of <HI>re-establishing</HI> the <HI>tithings</HI> that would need some new regulation.</P>
<P>The account of <HI>Frankpledge,</HI> given in Dr. Cowell's Interpreter, is worthy of being recited at length for the sake of those who cannot have recourse to that work.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Frankpledge (Franciplegium)</HI> is compounded</Q> (says he) <Q>of <HI>Franc,</HI> (i. e. <HI>liber,</HI>) and <HI>pleige,</HI> (i. e. <HI>fidejussor,</HI>) and signifieth, in our common law, a pledge, or surety, for freemen. For the ancient custome of England, for the preservation of the publike peace, was that every free-borne man, at fourteene yeeres of age, after <HI>Bracton,</HI> (religious persons, clerkes, knights, and their eldest sonnes ex∣cepted,) should find <HI>surety</HI> for his truth toward the king and his subjects, or else be kept <HI>in prison,</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Lambard also mentions this custom of <HI>impri∣soning</HI> those that could not <HI>find surety.</HI> See his Tract on "the Duties of <HI>Constables,</HI>" p. 7 and 8. I will re∣cite his words, beginning with the preceding paragraph, for the sake of more fully explaining the nature of <HI>pledges</HI> as well as their association in <HI>tithing</HI> and <HI>hundred</HI> courts. After mentioning the cause of associating in <HI>tithing</HI> or decenary companies, viz. <Q>—<HI>for the better repressing of theeves and robbers,</HI></Q> he adds, <Q>these companies be yet in some places of England, (and namely with us in Kent,) called BOROES, of the saide word BORHES, <HI>pledges</HI> or SUERTIE: albeit in the Westerne partes of the realme they be commonly named TYTHINGS, because they containe (as I told you) the number of TENNE MEN <HI>with their families.</HI> And even as <HI>tenne times tenne</HI> doe make an HUNDRED, so, because it was then also <HI>appointed that</HI> TENNE OF THESE COMPANIES shoulde at certain times</Q> (every three weeks

<PB N="100" REF="101"/>a certaine number of neighbors became customably bound one for another,
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>to see each man of their pledge forth-comming at all times, or to answere the transgression committed by any bro∣ken away. So that whosoever offended, it was forthwith inquired in what pledge he was, and then they of that pledge either brought him forth within 31 daies to his answere, or satis∣fied for his offence. This was called <HI>Frank-pledge, causa qua supra,</HI> and the circuit thereof was called <HI>decenna,</HI> because it commonly consisted of 10 <HI>households:</HI> and every particular person thus mutually bound for himselfe and his neighbours was called <HI>decennier,</HI> because he was of one <HI>decenna</HI> or ano∣ther: This custome was so kept, that

<PB N="126" REF="127"/>This article is very different from the French original, as well as from Fleta, and the supposed Statute of Edward II. and it is not easy to trace from any, or all, of these copies what has been originally intended. Accord∣ing to the old copy of the Myrrour it should be <Q><HI>of the dressers</HI> (or patchers) <HI>of old cloths dwelling</HI></Q> &amp;c.<SUP>w</SUP> as if the object was to prevent a secret vamping∣up of old, unsaleable, or damaged, clothes in order to pass them for new. In the articles of 18th Edward II. (N<SUP>o</SUP> 30,) it is <Q><HI>of cloth-sellers and curriers of lea∣ther<SUP>x</SUP> dwelling out of merchant-towns,</HI></Q> which I should suppose to respect rather
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>the <HI>markets,</HI> than the <HI>dwellings,</HI> of the <HI>cloth-sellers</HI> and <HI>curriers,</HI> viz. that all wholesale dealing in <HI>cloths</HI> and <HI>leather</HI> should be at public markets, established in great towns like the famous <HI>cloth</HI>-markets at Leeds and Halifax, and like the great <HI>leather</HI>-market in <HI>Leadenhall,</HI> that proper market prices may be regu∣larly ascertained and known for the common benefit of the manufacturers as well as merchants.</P>
<P>And, if this be really the intention of the article, it will enable us the better to understand how far a man was formerly prohibited from exercising two several trades, viz. not any two trades in gene∣ral, but only such trades as are so parti∣cularly connected together, that the ex∣ercise of both by one man might, in some degree, affect the public markets, and (like <HI>forestalling</HI>) prevent the fixing of
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>regular market-prices; and even this <HI>limitation</HI> must be <HI>limited</HI> to such trades only which may affect the <HI>necessary arti∣cles of life;</HI> for so, I think, we may un∣derstand the examples recited by Fleta; "that the <HI>shoe-maker"</HI> (and, of course, all other consumers of <HI>leather,</HI> the <HI>sadler,</HI> the <HI>breeches</HI>-maker, the <HI>glove</HI>-maker) <HI>"shall not be a tanner,"</HI> (for, otherwise, the proper market-price for <HI>leather</HI> could not be so easily ascertained,) <Q><HI>nor the tanner a butcher,</HI></Q> (which would in∣jure the <HI>fell</HI>-market for <HI>pells</HI> and <HI>hides,</HI> and would give him an undue advantage over other tanners,) <Q><HI>nor the business of a taylor</HI></Q> to be exercised (perhaps) by a <HI>clothier,</HI> or manufacturer of cloth, which would injure the <HI>cloth</HI>-markets; but of this last article I am uncertain; for I acknowledge that I do not understand what is meant by the abbreviated words

The old Saxon laws punished every lascivious affront, or impudent incivility, to women, which might be deemed a leading step to greater injuries, by pro∣portionable <HI>amerciaments,</HI> which the <HI>Court-Leets</HI> and <HI>Views</HI> may surely resume, if they please, in favour of <HI>morality,</HI> to vindicate the just rights of modest women, and to promote honourable marriage, which is notori∣ously hindered by the prevalence and facility of whore∣doms, and by the general neglect of doing justice to poor, injured, helpless, girls,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is unreasonable and unnatural that all the difficulties and ill consequences of temptation between the youth of both sexes should be cruelly laid upon the <HI>weaker vessel,</HI> whereby she is too often irrecove∣rably loft, and added to the pitiable swarms of wretched female sedu∣cers to revenge her injury on the other sex by the communication of a loathsome disease, till her wretched career in the service of Satan is closed by a miserable and hopeless death! The <HI>marriage act</HI> has greatly added to the promotion of these evils, by taking away the force of contracts, and other circumstances of the <HI>common law,</HI> that was favourable to the cases of injured young women, and this merely to indulge the unreasonable pride of families▪</NOTE> by punishing their se∣ducers, who, in ancient times, would have been com∣pelled to marry them.</P>
<P>The coroners were particularly required to vindicate the rights of females by enquiring after <HI>rapes,</HI> as ap∣pears by the last quotation from the articles of 18th Edward II. This circumstance is not mentioned in Fleta, though we there find a distinct article respecting coroners, in which, however, this crime, as being a <HI>felony,</HI> must necessarily be included. — <Q><HI>Item de feloniis quorum clamor non pervenit ad coronatores.</HI></Q>—<Q><HI>Also concerning</HI> FELONIES, <HI>the cry of which did not reach the</HI> CORONERS.</Q> The <HI>rights</HI> of the crown ought also to be enquired after at the <HI>torns</HI> of the sheriffs, and at <HI>Views of Frankpledge,</HI> (and undoubtedly also at other <HI>Leets,</HI>) not only of <HI>alienations</HI> of land, &amp;c. but also of <HI>escheats</HI> of every kind, and of the <HI>fines, amerciaments,</HI> and other profits, of these popular courts, which, how∣soever they may have been granted to private lords of manours, may always be resumed according to the true, <HI>legal,</HI> doctrine of <HI>"nullum tempus occurrit Regi,"</HI> as <HI>res fiscalis,</HI> a branch of the public revenue, which ought never to be sold or transferred by any King to another person, being <Q><HI>res quasi sacra quae dari non potest, nec vendi, nec ad alium transferri a principe vel a Rege regnante;</HI></Q> whereas it is otherwise in the alienation of <HI>lands, tenements,</HI> &amp;c. in which, <Q><HI>tempus currit contra Regem sicut contra quamlibet privatam personam,</HI></Q> as I have shewn in a distinct tract on that doctrine. But the <HI>more sacred</HI> branches of the public revenue, those which are properly <HI>res fiscalis,</HI> should be carefully enquired after; for, if they were duly levied and paid into the exchequer to the public accompt, they would considerably augment the national treasure without <HI>burthening</HI> the people, nay, they would be really, on the contrary, <HI>profitable</HI> to the people, not only in a <HI>moral</HI> sense, by restraining vice of every kind, but also in <HI>pecuniary</HI> advantage, by lowering the <HI>poor's rates,</HI> and by aiding the national treasury, in so essential a manner as would render less taxes necessary.</P>
<P>The 22d article in Fleta, charges the <HI>Leet</HI>-juries with the conservation of the rights of the crown. <Q><HI>Et si in</HI> TURNIS VICOMITIS <HI>vel</HI> VISIBUS HUNDREDARUM <HI>tunc sic, de jure regis relato, vel alienato in terra, vel in mari, per quem fuerit alienatum, vel celatum, et a quo tempore.</HI></Q></P>

"— <HI>sauns faire l'assesse,</HI>" which, I suppose, should rather be <HI>l'assise,</HI> i. e. without demanding a due enquiry into their case by <HI>inquest</HI> or <HI>assise</HI> of a <HI>jury.</HI> The priviledge should afford them, indeed, a short, temporary, asylum from any single, merciless, credi∣tor, yet not so as to favour their escape, but merely to give them time to call their other just creditors toge∣ther, in order to make an equal division, as far as their effects will go, after giving up <HI>all</HI> upon oath, and then to be absolutely at liberty by the <HI>common law</HI> without fear of farther arrest if there is no just suspicion of conceal∣ment. The <HI>"due process of the law"</HI> is sacred, and ought not to be baffled (nor even <HI>delayed</HI> in any other manner than what I have described) by abuses of <HI>privi∣ledged places;</HI> and therefore all <HI>Court-Leets</HI> or <HI>trithings</HI> are competent, as being <HI>"Courts of the King,"</HI> to vindicate the <HI>law,</HI> and to limit the asylum of <HI>privi∣ledged places</HI> within reasonable bounds, so as to <HI>relieve</HI> oppressed debtors without <HI>violently injuring</HI> the <HI>just rights</HI> of creditors. The old common law custom before-mentioned in behalf of debtors, viz. that they should be absolutely relieved from the fear of arrest, by giving up all their effects, upon oath, amongst their creditors, was called, in the North of England, <HI>"swearing themselves bare,"</HI> and I remember some instances of it several years ago, but whether it is still in use I do not know: it is, however, a <HI>reasonable</HI> usage; which, under the regulation of <HI>Court-Leets,</HI> (were they universally revived,) might prevent the <HI>imprisonment,</HI> and consequent <HI>ruin,</HI> of many useful and industrious members of society. The only circumstance remaining to be cited from the articles of 18th Edward II. is N<SUP>o</SUP> 33. <Q><HI>Of such as take doves in winter by door-falls or engines.</HI></Q> <HI>Door-falls</HI> are not mentioned in the original, but <HI>"laces,"</HI> for <HI>lacets,</HI> nooses or <HI>snares.</HI> Some other very necessary subjects of enquiry are mentioned by Fleta though omitted in all the other lists of articles, viz. concerning <HI>all neglects in keeping watch and ward,</HI> and concerning the King's high-ways not duly widened. (N<SUP>o</SUP> 28.) <Q><HI>Item de vigiliis non observatis, et viis rega∣libus non elargatis.</HI></Q> And, lastly, (all the <HI>other articles having been already cited.</HI>) <Q><HI>Item de hiis qui retinuerint probatores.</HI></Q>—<Q><HI>Also of those who had re∣tained provers,</HI></Q> or (as they were commonly called) <HI>"approvers."</HI> An approver <Q><HI>signifieth, in our common law,</HI></Q> (says Dr. Cowell,) <Q><HI>one, that confessing felony of himselfe, appealeth or accuseth another, one or more, to be guilty of the same; and he is called so, because hee must</HI> PROOVE <HI>that which hee hath alleadged in his appeale.</HI> Staunf. pl. cor. fo. 142. <HI>And that proofe is by battell, or by the countrey, at his election that appealed.</HI></Q> &amp;c. And whilst the barbarous and un∣reasonable custom of <HI>"trials by battle"</HI> continued, a hardened villain that was skilful at cudgeling, could bear a hearty drubbing, had it in his power (if it be true that the <HI>appellor</HI> had the election of the kind of trial and not the <HI>appellee</HI>) to compel any honest man that happened to be weaker than himself, either to risque the misfortune of an unequal combat, or to lose his land and fly the country. An enquiry therefore after the <HI>retainers</HI> and encouragers of such dangerous knaves was highly necessary in ancient times, but the <HI>approvers</HI> of the present times, i. e. those culprits, who turn <HI>King's evidence</HI> to save their own necks, cannot now endanger the life of an honest man in trials <Q><HI>by the country</HI></Q> unless the jury be extremly ignorant or partial; because such men, who have already confessed their own crimes, cannot justly be deemed <HI>credible wit∣nesses;</HI> so that their information is of no other avail or weight than as it may lead to more substantial evidence. And, besides the crimes already mentioned, every other act of injustice or vice whatsoever, and even mere <HI>immo∣ralities</HI> (as I before remarked) are within the cogni∣zance of the <HI>Court-Leets</HI> or <HI>Trithings,</HI> which are com∣petent in themselves to <HI>find a remedy</HI> for every <HI>incon∣venience</HI> without fearching for acts of parliament, because the latter were <HI>intended,</HI> at least, to aid and promote <HI>justice,</HI> and not to take away or lessen the <HI>just</HI> power of the ancient courts in suppressing <HI>vice</HI> and <HI>im∣morality.</HI> The pecuniary penalties, however, ordained by statutes against various crimes and misdemeanors may afford to the Juries of <HI>Leets</HI> some information respecting what may be deemed an adequate <HI>amercia∣ment;</HI> but it cannot be levied by virtue of the statute unless there is also an express clause, giving power to <HI>Leets</HI> for that purpose, (like the Statute of 4 James I. c. 5. against <HI>drunkenness;</HI>) but as this, I believe, is very seldom the case, it is better to proceed entirely by the authority of the <HI>common law</HI> in all cases wherein it is not expressly altered or changed by statute. With respect to <HI>drunkenness,</HI> (a vice which generally precedes <HI>most other vices,</HI> and cannot therefore afford the least colour of excuse to <HI>any,</HI> but is rather to be deemed an aggravation to the guilt of <HI>all</HI> vices,) every circumstance of it ought to be strictly enquired after, and the de∣faulters should be regularly <HI>amerced</HI> without remission that they may want <HI>money,</HI> at least, though they do not want inclination, for that <HI>damnable</HI>

<P>By a statute of 3: Eliz. c. 7. some other articles of enquiry are submitted to the cognizance of court leets. viz. <Q><HI>If any person hath built, or caused to be built, any manner of cottage for habitation or dwelling, or convert∣ed any other building to be used as a cottage</HI> for habita∣tion or dwelling, without assigning, or laying, to the same cottage or building, four acres of ground at the least, &amp;c. lying near to the said cottage to be con∣tinually occupied and manured therewith, so long as the same cottage shall be inhabited.</Q></P>
<P>The forfeit or penalty is 10l. to the King, and the up∣holding, maintaining, and continuing, any such cottage is 40s. for every month. The act does not extend to cottages erected <Q><HI>in any city, town corporate, or ancient borough or market town, &amp;c.</HI></Q> nor to cottages <Q><HI>for the necessary and convenient habitation or dwelling of workmen or labourers in any mineral works, coal mines, quarries or delfs of stone or slate, or in or about the ma∣king of brick, tile, lime, or coals, within this realm: so as the same cottages or buildings be not above one mile distant from the place of the said mineral, &amp;c.</HI></Q> nor <Q><HI>to any cottage to be made within a mile of the sea; or upon the side of such part of any navigable river where the admiral ought to have jurisdiction, so long as no other person shall therein inhabit, but a sayler or man of ma∣nual occupation, to, or for making, furnishing, or vic∣tualling of any ship or vessel used to serve on the sea,</HI> nor <HI>to any cottage to be made in any forest, chace, warren, or park, so long as no other person shall therein inhabit but an underkeeper or warrener, &amp;c.</HI></Q> nor <Q><HI>to any cot∣tage heretofore made, so long as no other person shall therein inhabit, but a common herd man or shepherd, for keeping the cattle or sheep of the town; or a poor, lame, sick, aged or impotent person;</HI></Q> nor <Q><HI>to any cottage to be made, which, for any just respect, upon complaint to the justice of assize, at the assizes, or to the justices of peace at the quarter sessions, shall, by their order, entered in open assizes, or quarter sessions, be decreed to continue for ha∣bitation for and during so long time only as by such decree shall be tolerated and limited.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But cottages <HI>"builded upon commons or waste grounds"</HI> were allowed only <HI>three acres</HI> to be enclosed to and with the same; and if <Q><HI>there be above the number of three acres enclosed therewith, the overplus shall or may be laid open by the owner or owners of the same wastes,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> See 3d and 4th Edw. VI. c. 3.</P>
<P>And inclosed <HI>gardens, orchards,</HI> or <HI>ponds,</HI> made in any such wastes or grounds are permitted by the last men∣tioned act to remain to the owners, if they exceed not the quantity of two acres (§. v. &amp; vi.)</P>
<P>We must necessarily understand that the permission in these two clauses could not have been intended to ex∣tend to parts of commons or wastes that have been clan∣destinely joined by inclosures to any neighbouring free∣hold land; for the latter is notorious incroachment or pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>presture on public rights by <HI>land owners,</HI> who, on account of the land they already possess, are the least intitled to such an indulgence.</P>
<P>The court leet should also enquire, <Q><HI>If there be any inmate, or more families or households than one, dwelling or inhabiting in any one cottage?</HI></Q> In which case the owner or occupier of the cottage forfeits to the lord of the leet 10s. <Q><HI>for every month that any such inmate, or other family than one shall dwell or inhabit in any cottage as aforesaid,</HI></Q> &amp;c. See the before cited act of 31 Eliz. c. 7. which gives full power to court leets <Q><HI>to enquite and to take presentment by the oath of jurors, of all and every offence in this behalf</HI> (i. e. <HI>respecting cottages, &amp;c.</HI>) <HI>and upon such presentment had or made, to levy by distrest to the use of the lord of the leet, all such sums of money as so shall be forfeited,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>We are farther informed by <HI>Fleta,</HI> in the chapter be∣fore cited (viz. lib. ii. c. 52.) that <Q><HI>when the</HI> CHIEF PLEDGES <HI>shall have answered distinctly,</HI></Q> says he,

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have already remarked, that 12 years seems too tender an age for persons to be required to <HI>take the oaths,</HI> though it is certainly very proper that all persons of that age should appear at <HI>the view</HI> to be publicly admitted as members of the community, and to be arranged under the protection of some <HI>decenary</HI> of associated housekeep∣ers, in order to be duly <HI>pledged</HI> to the public peace. <HI>Bracton,</HI> as I have before remarked, mentions the age of 14 years; perhaps 16 or 18, when youths are more capable of bearing arms, would be a more reasonable age, or even the <HI>transposed</HI> number 21.</NOTE> is the number expressed in the original,) <Q><HI>man or woman,

For, whether a country be more or less po∣pulous, it makes no difference in the ef∣ficacy and regularity of this system, because the proposed numerical divisions would still bear the same proportions exactly, with respect to each other, in either case, viz. whether the people be few or many.
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>And the lesser divisions of <HI>tithings</HI> are so small and manageable, that every <HI>indivi∣dual,</HI> as well as every <HI>family</HI> therein, may be easily known and controuled by their elected <HI>Chief-Pledges,</HI> who, with their whole divisions, are again included and controuled in still larger divisions, equally well proportioned, under <HI>superior chiefs,</HI> or <HI>justiciaries.</HI> And these <HI>justiciaries</HI> in∣vested with ample power of <HI>law</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> are so limited, with respect to <HI>tort, wrong,</HI> or <HI>injury,</HI> that they have no authority to act contrary to <HI>common consent,</HI> nor to pro∣ceed against any man without <HI>"due process of the law,"</HI> though they have effectual means of information concerning the abode and general circumstances even of the meanest individual throughout all the <HI>tithings</HI> by their nearest neighbours and acquaintance.

<P>Now, if this was as <HI>true</HI> as it is <HI>witty,</HI> the state of the nation would indeed be desperate! for, if the <HI>"most effectual"</HI> plan of reformation was really <HI>impracti∣cable,</HI> any attempt whatever to correct the enormous <HI>inequality,</HI> or <HI>in-equity,</HI> of the national representation, and its conse∣quent <HI>ruinous venality</HI> and manifold <HI>de∣structive corruptions,</HI> would indeed be hopeless! and we should, of course, be obliged to embrace this author's forlorn and <HI>disloyal</HI> doctrine, (in p. 17.) which
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>may truly be said to express the scope and drift of all his arguments; because they are, for the most part, <HI>deistically</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In a well-intended work of the same celebrated au∣thor, wherein <HI>Deistical</HI> notions ought not to have ap∣peared without their antidote, we may find several very heterodox and dangerous positions, stated as the re∣marks of <HI>"some speculative and refined observers,"</HI> viz. that to such persons <HI>"it has appeared incredible,"</HI> (say he,) <Q><HI>that a wise and benevolent Creator should have con∣stituted a world upon one plan, and a religion for it on another;</HI></Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.

And at last, he renders himself answerable for these pernicious and contradictory positions, by in∣discriminately adopting them all, and making them his <HI>own,</HI> saying, <Q><HI>To all this I answer, that such indeed is the Christian Revelation, though some of its advocates may, perhaps, be unwilling to own it, and such</HI></Q> (says he) <Q><HI>it is constantly declared to be by him who gave it, as well as by those who published it under his immediate direction:</HI></Q> But, happily for mankind and the honour of our holy reli∣gion, the texts, which he has cited to justify his assertion, contain nothing that can possibly afford the least sanc∣tion to any such doctrines and contradictions. That <HI>world,</HI> which our Saviour spoke of as being in opposi∣tion to <HI>him</HI> and <HI>his,</HI> could not mean <HI>the world constituted upon the plan of the Creator,</HI> but only the wickedness of <HI>worldly men,</HI> such as the apostle Paul has particularly de∣scribed in his second epistle to Timothy, (ch. iii. v. 2-9.) <Q><HI>Lovers of their own-selves, covetous, boasters, proud,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> <Q><HI>Lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having</HI> A FORM OF GODLINESS, BUT DENY∣ING THE POWER THEREOF; <HI>from such</HI></Q> (said the apostle) <HI>"turn away;"</HI> manifestly giving the very same advice, which appears in one of the texts cited by this writer, "<HI>Be not conformed to this world,</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 2.</NOTE>" i. e. to the man∣ners and unprofitable pursuits of such <HI>worldly</HI> men as I have described in the words of the apostle; for of such is surely formed that <Q><HI>world which is at enmity with God,</HI></Q> mentioned in another of the texts cited, by him, from the apostle James. Nay, that
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 6. Jom. iv. 4.</NOTE> <Q><HI>wisdom of the world which is at enmity with God</HI></Q> cannot be illus∣trated by more flagrant examples than these very posi∣tions, which our author has unguardedly adopted from <HI>"some speculative and refined observers,"</HI> and more espe∣cially the third, that <Q><HI>government cannot be managed without violence, corruption, and imposition,</HI></Q> which I propose more particularly to examine, because it is a <HI>political</HI> doctrine too generally adopted by <HI>placemen</HI> and <HI>pensioners,</HI> and which is manifestly the very principle or essential spirit which pervaded, and has notoriously in∣fluenced, every page of our author's <Q><HI>Thoughts on a Parliamentary Reform!</HI></Q> His <HI>first</HI> position is materially connected with the <HI>third,</HI> and will, of course, fall un∣der the same examination. With respect to his <HI>second</HI> position, I shall briefly remark, that, though <Q><HI>the love of power, riches, honour, and fame, are,</HI></Q> indeed most commonly <Q><HI>the great inoitements to generous and magna∣nimous actions,</HI></Q> yet, for the honour of human nature, these are not to be deemed the <HI>only</HI> incitements, because the MOST <HI>"generous"</HI> and the MOST <Q><HI>magnanimous actions</HI></Q> have much more noble <HI>incitements</HI> than he has conceived, viz. the <HI>love of God,</HI> and the <HI>natural love</HI> of <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>right;</HI> so that his position proves nothing against the merit of actions that are <HI>truly</HI> and <HI>perfectly generous.</HI> And, besides these worthy <HI>incitements,</HI> the agency, or influence, of GOD's HOLY SPIRIT is also to be deemed an <HI>incitement to generous and magnanimous actions;</HI> nay, it is certainly the highest <HI>incitement,</HI> or the <HI>supreme principle of action in man,</HI> by which <HI>all</HI> christians <HI>ought</HI> to be influenced, and most certainly <HI>may</HI> be so, if they do not neglect the promised <HI>means!</HI> This, I trust, is amply proved in my tract on <HI>the Law of Nature,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> and <HI>fifth</HI> positions are grounded on a strange misunderstanding of the true doctrine concern∣ing <HI>non-resistance;</HI> for though, we are, indeed, required to forgive <HI>personal injuries,</HI> and to submit to them with christian meekness, when any one of <HI>ourselves</HI> is indivi∣dually the sufferer, nevertheless we are, most certainly, bound in christian duty to <HI>resist evil</HI> and <HI>injury</HI> whenever the <HI>persons,</HI> or <HI>property,</HI> of <HI>other</HI> men are in danger; and to defend <HI>each other</HI> from all unjust <HI>violence</HI> and <HI>ra∣pine,</HI> whenever it is in our power to do so; and that even at the risk of our lives, which I have fully stated in my tracts on <HI>Crown Law</HI> and <HI>Passive Obedience.</HI> And, if individuals may, legally, and consistently with their duty as christians, <HI>resist evil</HI> in defence of <HI>each other,</HI> surely a whole christian community, or <HI>nation,</HI> may, most conscientiously, be allowed, in their united legislative or executive capacity, a power of <HI>defending the innecent,</HI> and of <HI>resisting evil</HI> and <HI>oppression:</HI> for this is the true foundation of all <HI>just wars,</HI> which, certainly, in the necessary defence of a <HI>nation,</HI> may be carried on without the guilt of <HI>rapine</HI> and <HI>murder;</HI> since, even be∣tween <HI>individuals,</HI> the <HI>inevitable killing</HI> of an adversary, in the necessary defence of a man's own person, is clear∣ly <HI>justifiable</HI> in <HI>law,</HI> as well as in <HI>reason,</HI> which is the <HI>eternal</HI> law of God. And <HI>national justice</HI> in many cases, is unquestionably required to <HI>resist evil,</HI> even unto <HI>blood!</HI> The blood of the murderer (i. e. of the <HI>voluntary killer of a</HI> MAN) is absolutely required to be shed by MAN, (<HI>"by man shall his blood be shed,"</HI> Gen. ix. 6.) and a moral reason is elsewhere assigned for this retaliation by <HI>man,</HI> viz. <Q><HI>for blood it desileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</HI></Q> (Num. xxxv. 33.) And this, surely, is a <HI>resistance to evil,</HI> a retaliation of <HI>violence in kind</HI> even to the utmost extremity of <HI>violence,</HI>—to death! This, however, must be understood only of <HI>judicial acts</HI> of retaliation, duly limited in all their circumstances by the established laws of the <HI>community,</HI> or nation, which inhabits <HI>the land where the blood is shed;</HI> but, under such due restriction, the retaliation of <HI>blood</HI> for <HI>blood</HI> is so far from being forbid, that the land, it is manifest, cannot be <HI>cleansed</HI> without it. The indiscriminate doc∣trine, therefore, of <HI>non resistance,</HI> as stated in these two positions, has no foundation in scripture, nor indeed any where else, except in the <HI>misunderstanding</HI> and inac∣curacy of these <HI>speculative</HI> and <HI>refined observers!</HI></P>
<P>I may now return to the consideration of his third position, that <Q><HI>government is essential to the nature of man, and</HI> CANNOT <HI>be managed without certain degrees of</HI> VIOLENCE, CORRUPTION, and IMPOSITION, <HI>yet all these are strictly forbid.</HI></Q> The first part of this sen∣tence, as well as the last, must certainly be admitted as unquestionable <HI>truths;</HI> but if the middle part of the proposition were equally <HI>true;</HI> viz. that government "CANNOT <HI>be managed without violence, imposition,</HI>" &amp;c. it would follow, of course, that the <HI>necessity of the case</HI> must regularly supersede all that is so <Q><HI>strictly forbid</HI></Q> concerning it! and then, indeed, these <Q><HI>spe∣culative</HI> and <HI>refined observers</HI></Q> would have a better foundation for their impious insinuation, that the <HI>Crea∣tor hath</HI> <Q><HI>constituted a world upon one plan, and a reli∣gion for it on another!</HI></Q> Nay, I have frequently heard these very principles avowed in conversation, by some other <HI>such "friends to good government"</HI> as our author, in terms to the following effect. <Q><HI>That public business cannot be carried on without</HI> BRIBERY and CORRUP∣TION: <HI>that the measures of administration are indis∣pensably</HI> NECESSARY <HI>to maintain due subordination and</HI> GOOD GOVERNMENT, <HI>and must not, therefore, be im∣peded by unseasonable negatives of parliament; so that</HI> POLITICAL NECESSITY <HI>will sufficiently justify the statesman in exerting all possible influence to obtain a majority at any rate.</HI></Q> Thus the plea of NECESSITY is introduced to <HI>palliate</HI> and excuse, nay, even to <HI>jus∣tify</HI> and <HI>establish,</HI> the most flagrant enormities! as if <HI>in∣equity</HI> was become an essential principle of government, so authorized and <HI>established</HI> by the sanction of <HI>general usage,</HI> that every attempt to correct it must be deemed an <HI>innovation to the constitution!</HI></P>
<P>In no other point of view can be understood the falla∣cious and groundless charge of INNOVATION which has regularly been opposed to <HI>parliamentary reform,</HI> by men of <HI>a certain description,</HI> whenever it hath been proposed. With these <HI>latitudinarians in principle,</HI> all distinctions between <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> must be measured by <HI>political expediency,</HI> because <HI>government,</HI> according to them, <Q><HI>cannot be managed without certain degrees of violence, corruption, and imposition!</HI></Q> Thus the celebrated wri∣ter hath very honestly stated the <HI>ruling</HI> maxim of that <HI>venal majority</HI> with whom he always <HI>voted</HI> and <HI>associated.</HI> And, as these <HI>"speculative and refined observers"</HI> have carried this wretched system of <HI>political necessity and ex∣pediency</HI> to the utmost extent that it was capable of, I have need only to cite their own <HI>woeful experience,</HI> as a most striking and undeniable example of its absurdity!</P>
<P>The INIQUITY of these acknowledged means of <HI>"managing government,"</HI> viz. <Q><HI>violence, corruption, and imposition,</HI></Q> added to the MISCARRIAGES which such worthy <HI>ministerial accomplishments</HI> have of late years no∣toriously occasioned, would form too heavy a burden for one broad back! I speak, therefore, of the late <HI>governing</HI> majority, in the aggregate, and shall not be tempted to particularize, unless any of them should still persist in soliciting and inviting, as it were, the national justice against themselves, for their former misconduct when in power, by any farther unreasonable and <HI>pro∣voking</HI> opposition to the necessary <HI>reformation.</HI></P>
<P>Under the baneful auspices of these justifying Majori∣ties and their <HI>Managers,</HI> the Patrons and Friends of this writer, (with the sanction also of his <HI>own steady vote,</HI> in all their measures;) the most disgraceful and per∣nicious excess, of "<HI>violence, corruption,</HI> and <HI>imposition,</HI>" has been tried and pushed to the utmost exertions of the national strength and resources; and at an expence of blood and treasure, far beyond all example of former times!</P>
<P>And yet the detestable <HI>experiment</HI> has notoriously failed in almost every circumstance proposed to be effected by it, and, instead of <HI>raising a revenue,</HI> to gratify and ease <HI>"the country gentlemen,"</HI> has <HI>sunk</HI> the national resources in a hopeless <HI>gulph of debt,</HI> the very interest of which is an <HI>annual</HI> expence of more than the value of an em∣pire! i. e. <HI>a revenue, by the rule of inverse, against</HI> the state, like the <HI>"negative quantity"</HI> of the algebraists, <HI>"less than nothing,"</HI> a <HI>"minus"</HI> of eight millions per annum, at least, besides a most disgraceful dismember∣ment of the British empire! So much for the EXPE∣RIENCE of the <HI>"speculative and refined observers."</HI></P>
<P>There are many maxims, indeed, which seem to favour the plea of <HI>necessity,</HI> as
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">(1.) "Necessitas non habet legem."</NOTE> "NECESSITY <HI>has no law.</HI>"
<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">(2.) <Q>Necessitas facit licitum quod alias non est licitum.</Q></NOTE> <Q><HI>Necessity makes lawful what, otherwise, is not law∣ful.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">(3.) "Salus populi suprema est lex."</NOTE> <HI>"The safety of the people"</HI> (which even bad ministers will pretend to regard) <HI>"is the supreme law."</HI>
<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">(4.) "Necessitas vincit legem."</NOTE> <HI>"Necessity binds the law."</HI>
<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">(5.) <Q>Necessitas legum vincula ir∣ridet.</Q></NOTE> <Q><HI>Necessity scorns the bands of law.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">(6.) "Nihil magis justum est, quam quod necessarium est," &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q><HI>Nothing is more</HI> JUST <HI>than that which is</HI> NECESSARY,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>But the man, who has not sufficient discrimination to assign the due legal limits to these doctrines of <HI>necessity,</HI> is certainly unworthy to be trusted either in <HI>law</HI> or <HI>poli∣tics.</HI> For the <HI>common law of England</HI> requires the accom∣accomplished <HI>lawyer,</HI> or <HI>politician,</HI> to be also <HI>a christian,</HI> and cannot, therefore, excuse the too fashionable doc∣trine of the vulgar great, that a <HI>state necessity</HI> is not li∣mited by the common rules of <HI>honesty</HI> and <HI>morality.</HI></P>
<P>The maxims in question, therefore, manifestly <Q>relate only to such <HI>laws</HI> as are made to remedy inconve∣niencies <HI>not in themselves evil,</HI> mere <HI>mala prohibita;</HI> but cannot authorize any thing that is <HI>malum in se;</HI> for that would be REBELLION AGAINST GOD, which no case can justify
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the protest of a private person against every suspension of law, &amp;c. p. 25 to 44.</NOTE> For, of those, who say <Q><HI>Let us do evil, that good may come,</HI></Q> the scripture has ad∣ded, <HI>"whose damnation is just,"</HI> (Rom. iii. 8.) and there∣fore, <HI>"melius est omnia mala pati quam malo consentire,"</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>It is better to endure ALL adversities, than to assent to ONE evil measure.</Q></NOTE> is an established maxim of <HI>right,</HI> (3 Inst. 23.) insomuch that a king cannot <HI>legally</HI> dispense with <HI>"malum in se,"</HI> nor can all the <HI>omnipotence of parliament</HI> establish it by statute; because, by the renovating principles of the common law, any such statute must be deemed <HI>null</HI> and <HI>void in itself,</HI> a mere <HI>corruptela,</HI> and <HI>no statute,</HI> as I have elsewhere amply proved. And, as <HI>iniquity,</HI> or <Q><HI>malnm in se,</HI></Q> is never <HI>lawful,</HI> neither is it ever NECESSARY; but, on the contrary, <HI>impolitic,</HI> and <HI>hurtful,</HI> even to a proverb

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a prophetical description of <HI>an abandoned man,</HI> (see Psalm xxxvi.) it is declared, as a part of such a character, that <Q><HI>he hath not abomi∣nated</HI> EVII,</Q> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

How then shall we reconcile them?

No, let us rather examine whether the proposition be true on which this supposed <HI>necessity</HI> is built? viz. that <Q>go∣vernment</Q> <HI>cannot be managed without certain degrees "of violence, corruption, and imposition!</HI></Q> or whether, on the contrary, this detestable union of three diabolical principles; "<HI>violence, corruption,</HI> and <HI>imposition,</HI>" is not itself the most obvious efficient cause of all the <HI>ne∣cessities</HI> and <HI>misfortunes</HI> of every government? and which, if not speedily reformed in our own, must inevitably produce a total subversion of the state and kingdom?</P>
<P>Search the histories of all preceding nations that are either entirely lost and overwhelmed with calamity and misery, or else still unhappily continue upon earth, a contrasted memorial of their once flourishing ancestry, in a wretch∣ed existence of <HI>political slavery,</HI> subjected to the despotic will, caprice, and misgovernment, of arbitrary tyrants, and see if a single instance can be found among them of any nation being thus deplorably reduced, till these baneful seeds of destruction, <Q><HI>violence, corruption,</HI> and <HI>imposition,</HI></Q> (planted and watered by the <Q><HI>refined ob∣servations</HI></Q> of such <HI>"speculative"</HI> writers, as the author of <HI>"Thoughts on a Parliamentary Reform!"</HI> &amp;c.) had taken deep root, had sprouted, grown up, and flou∣rished, (under their fostering hands,) till they were ripe for such a harvest! and yet these <HI>refined observers</HI> would have us believe, that the Creator hath <Q><HI>constituted a world upon one plan, and a religion for it on another,</HI></Q> (p. 133.) as if there was no DIVINE PROVIDENCE <HI>in this world</HI> to favour and encourage <HI>just</HI> men and <HI>just</HI> measures! or as if <HI>"God's ways were not equal,"</HI> which, it seems, was an erroneous conception also of the back∣sliding people of Israel. <Q><HI>Yet, saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal.</HI> O HOUSE OF ISRAEL, ARE NOT MY WAYS EQUAL? <HI>are not your ways un∣equal? Therefore will I judge you, O house of Israel, every one</HI> ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS, <HI>saith the Lord God. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgres∣sions;</HI> SO INIQUITY SHALL NOT BE YOUR RUIN,</Q> &amp;c. (Ezek. xviii. 29, 30.) By the <HI>ruin</HI> here spoken of, as occasioned by <HI>iniquity,</HI> is to be understood a <HI>temporal</HI> ruin, to be brought upon their nation, on account of the <Q><HI>vio∣lence, corruption,</HI> and <HI>imposition,</HI></Q> and other <HI>iniquities,</HI> with which their political <HI>"government"</HI> was unhappily <HI>"managed."</HI> This sense is rendered obvious by the preceding chapter, as well as by several which follow it; and particularly, in the 22d chapter, these three baneful <HI>iniquities</HI> are plainly pointed out, as principally concurring to effect the then approaching destruction of Jerusalem! And first, with respect to "VIOLENCE." <Q><HI>Behold,</HI> (said the prophet,) <HI>the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.</HI></Q> And again, <Q>—<HI>in the midst of thee have they</HI> DEALT BY OPPRESSION <HI>with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and widow.</HI></Q> And, with respect to their IMPOSI∣TION and DECEIT, <Q><HI>In thee</HI> (said the prophet) <HI>are men which</HI> CARRY TALES <HI>to shed blood;</HI></Q> and, with respect to their CORRUPTION and BRIBERY, <Q><HI>In thee</HI> (said the prophet) <HI>have they</HI> TAKEN GIFTS <HI>to shed blood!</HI></Q> And these, with other crimes, are ex∣pressly declared to be the true causes of their political failure, and national disgrace; <HI>"behold, therefore,"</HI> (said the prophet, in the name and power of him who sent him,) <Q><HI>I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee. Can thine heart endure,</HI></Q> (or <HI>be firm,</HI>) <Q REND="margQuotes"><HI>or can thy hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee?</HI> I, THE LORD (JEHO∣VAH,) <HI>have spoken</HI> (it) <HI>and will do</HI> (it.)</Q> And then follows the denunciation of vengeance, the usual effect of such <HI>"management"</HI> in politics! <Q><HI>And I will scatter thee among the heathen,</HI> (or nations,) <HI>and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.</HI></Q> (Ezek. xxii. 6-15.) These are clearly <HI>temporal</HI> judge∣ments;—<HI>the expulsion</HI> of a <HI>whole nation from their native country,</HI> and their dispersion as vagabonds amongst their enemies, for their <HI>wicked policy</HI> in having <HI>"managed"</HI> their <HI>government</HI> with "<HI>violence, imposition,</HI> and <HI>corruption!</HI>"</P>
<P>In the 33d chapter, also, the prophet again repeat∣edly reproves their impious supposition of an <HI>inequality</HI> in the <HI>ways</HI> of the <HI>Creator,</HI> which appears to have been essentially the same with the <HI>Deistical</HI> proposition of our <HI>"refined observers,"</HI> about <Q><HI>a world upon one plan, and a religion for it on another.</HI></Q> See verses 17 to 29. <Q><HI>Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them,</HI></Q> (said the prophet speaking of the <HI>"speculative refined observers"</HI> of that day,) <Q><HI>their way is not equal. When the</HI> RIGHTEOUS <HI>turneth from his</HI> RIGHTEOUSNESS, <HI>and committeth</HI> INIQUITY,</Q> (whe∣ther in "<HI>violence, imposition,</HI> or <HI>corruption,</HI>" or as a li∣terary advocate for all three!) <Q><HI>he shall even die thereby. But, if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which</HI> is LAWFUL and RIGHT, <HI>he shall</HI> LIVE THERE∣BY. <HI>Yet, ye say, the way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.</HI></Q> And a little farther, in the same chapter, the prophet is charged with a solemn appeal to them, concerning the <HI>improbability</HI> of their being permitted to continue in <HI>possession of their country,</HI> if they continued their detesta∣ble practices of <HI>violence,</HI> &amp;c. in direct opposition to the <HI>plan; religion,</HI> and <HI>laws,</HI> of the Creator! <Q><HI>Wherefore say ye unto them, thus saith the</HI> LORD GOD; <HI>Ye eat with the blood,</HI></Q> (a practice expressly forbid under the <HI>patri∣archal</HI> and <HI>Christian,</HI> as well as the <HI>Mosaic,</HI> dispensations,) <Q><HI>and lift up your eyes toward your idols
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a charge of criminality which cannot be evaded by those who pray before <HI>images,</HI> on the delusive pretence of assisting their de∣votion: for, though their prayers may be addressed to the <HI>prototype,</HI> yet they are certainly guilty of <HI>lifting up their eyes toward their idols!</HI></NOTE> and shed blood: and</HI> SHALL YE POSSESS THE LAND? <HI>Ye stand upon your sword,</HI></Q> (i. e. they trusted in their <HI>standing ar∣mies,</HI> the power of <HI>the beast,</HI> and the source of all their criminal VIOLENCE,) <HI>"ye work abomination,"</HI> (which in∣cludes every species of CORRUPTION and immorality,) <Q><HI>and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife</HI></Q>

<P><HI>"Let no man deceive you,"</HI> (said the beloved apostle of Christ,) <Q><HI>he that doeth</HI> RIGHTEOUSNESS <HI>is</HI> RIGH∣TEOUS <HI>even as he is</HI> RIGHTEOUS. <HI>He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning.</HI></Q> And again, <Q><HI>in this</HI> THE CHILDREN OF GOD <HI>are ma∣nifest, and</HI> THE CHILDREN OF THE DEVIL: <HI>who∣soever</HI> DOETH NOT RIGHTEOUSNESS <HI>is not of</HI> GOD, <HI>nei∣ther he that loveth not his brother.</HI></Q> (1 John iii. 7, and 10.) So that even the <HI>omission</HI> of righteousness is also fatal and impolitic, though not, perhaps, in so great a degree as the actual exercise of our celebrated author's three practical principles of <HI>iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>In the history of David, we find that his <HI>omissions</HI> to execute <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> on some occasions, were at∣tended by punishments almost as exemplary as those which marked his actual crimes. His neglect to pu∣nish his son <HI>Amnon</HI>'s detestable violence and persidy, to∣wards his sister <HI>Tamer,</HI> produced the treacherous mur∣der of <HI>Amnon</HI> by his brother <HI>Absalom;</HI> and again, his farther neglect to punish <HI>Absalom</HI> for that notorious <HI>mur∣der</HI> (for no <HI>human authority</HI> can pardon murder) left him a <HI>bloody</HI> enemy to seek his own life, and actually to de∣throne him for a time!</P>
<P>The holy scriptures abound with such striking in∣stances of <HI>bad,</HI> as well as of <HI>good,</HI> actions; but <HI>all</HI> of them are to be deemed as <HI>ensamples, written for our ad∣monition,</HI> (1 Cor. x. 11.) and therefore, we must not presume to say, with the celebrated author, that some of the occurrences, related in scripture, are <Q><HI>of no im∣portance at all,</HI></Q> (p. 128.) and, the more especially, because even the <HI>occurrences</HI> which he himself has picked out
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I have no doubt," (says our celebrated author,) <Q>but that St. Paul was shipwrecked, and that he left his cloak and his parch∣ments at Troas; but the belief of these facts makes no part of christianity, nor is the truth of them any proof of its authority. It proves, only, that this apostle could not, in common life, be under the perpetual influence of infallible inspiration; for, had he been so, he would not have put to sea before a storm, nor have forgot his cloak.</Q></NOTE> and cited, as samples of this unwarrantable doc∣trine, (and, doubtless, a gentleman, so celebrated in the polite world for wit and genius, must be supposed to have chosen the most <HI>obvious samples</HI> that could be found, if there were any,) are so far from being of <Q><HI>no im∣portance at all,</HI></Q> that they are, on the contrary, <HI>high∣ly important,</HI> and truly <Q><HI>profitable for doctrine, for re∣proof, for correction,</HI></Q> &amp;c. as, indeed, every other oc∣currence related in scripture most certainly is both <HI>important</HI> and <HI>necessary,</HI> in some respect or other, whe∣ther we have sagacity to discover it or not; because the same authority assures us, that <Q>ALL SCRIPTURE (is) given by <HI>inspiration of God, and</HI> IS PROFITABLE <HI>for</HI> DOCTRINE, <HI>for</HI> REPROOF, <HI>for</HI> CORRECTION, <HI>for</HI> INSTRUCTION <HI>in righteousness,</HI></Q> &amp;c. 2 Tim. iii. 16.</P>
<P>Happily the celebrated writer, it seems, has <HI>"no doubt,"</HI> of <HI>"these facts,"</HI> for otherwise <HI>"the belief"</HI> of them, he must allow, <HI>"is necessary,"</HI> if it is but for <HI>one plain reason,</HI> viz. that they <HI>are related in the holy scrip∣tures:</HI> but whenever the occurrences, mentioned in scrip∣ture <HI>are related in any other way,</HI> in any way, I mean, that is <HI>contrary to,</HI> or <HI>unsupported</HI> by, the scripture-account of them, (like the celebrated author's <HI>own way of rela∣ting</HI> the occurrences in question) then, indeed, as he says, <HI>"the belief of these facts,"</HI> when SO RELATED, <HI>"makes no part of christianity!"</HI> When this gentleman, for instance, remarks concerning <HI>"the truth of them,"</HI> that <Q><HI>it proves, only, that this apostle could not, in com∣mon life, be under the perpetual influence of infallible in∣spiration,</HI></Q> (a point which requires no proof or dis∣pute at all,) he immediately subjoins, by way of illus∣tration, a state of circumstances which is utterly discor∣dant with the scripture-account of <HI>"these facts,"</HI> say∣ing, <HI>"for, had he been so,"</HI> (i. e. under the influence of inspiration,) <Q><HI>he would not have put to sea before a storm, nor forgot his cloak.</HI></Q> But the celebrated author him∣self had <HI>"forgot,"</HI> (it seems,) that the apostle <HI>was a prisoner</HI> at that time, and could not avoid being <HI>"put to sea,"</HI> so that this circumstance <HI>proves</HI> nothing at all to the purpose of his argument; and he has <Q><HI>for∣got,</HI></Q> likewise, another circumstance which is still more unlucky for his assertion, viz. that the holy scripture has expressly informed us, that the apostle <HI>actually foretold the danger of the voyage,</HI> and has thereby given us ample proof of his being under <Q><HI>the influence of infallible inspiration,</HI></Q> at the very time, and in the very fact, which the celebrated writer has ingeniously cited as a proof to the contrary! (See Acts. xxvii. 10.) The occurrence is, therefore, so far from being of <HI>"no importance at all,"</HI> that it is, perhaps, the <HI>most important</HI> of any in the whole history of that apostle! if we except his conversion; because the actual attention of <HI>divine providence</HI> towards just and righteous men is exemplified (for the comfort of all persons that are truly religious) in this eminent instance of God's regard to the person of Paul, in giving him such <HI>foreknowledge for his preservation.</HI> And the other circumstances of the shipwreck are also <HI>highly important</HI> in many other respects; for, though the ship was really lost, <HI>agreeable to the apos∣tle's prediction,</HI> yet God afterwards <HI>gave to Paul the lives of all that failed with him,</HI> whereby he was authorized to assure them of safety, even when they were at the ut∣most extremity of danger, saying, <Q><HI>there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you,</HI></Q> though there were 276 souls on-board! so that the celebrated writer has, indeed, picked out a <HI>most important occurrence</HI> to serve him as a sample of those which he supposes <HI>"of no im∣portance at all!"</HI> and, as to the other <HI>supposed</HI> occurrence, (viz. that the apostle had <HI>"forgot his cloak,"</HI>) it has not the least foundation in holy scripture, or elsewhere, that I know of, except in the lively imagination of this agreeable <HI>writer,</HI> in order to give a quaint and facetious turn to the end of one of his sentences, which is an ob∣ject of more importance, it seems, with some fashionable authors, than <HI>truth</HI> itself! That the apostle LEFT <HI>his cloak in Troas,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>which, "I</HI> LEFT," says he, <HI>"in Troas with Karpus,"</HI> 2 Tim. iv. 13.) and, probably, <HI>his books</HI> also, is not to be dis∣puted; but we have no warrant to suppose that he <Q>FOR∣GOT</Q> either cloak or books, unless we may be allowed to confound all due discrimination of words and their separate senses for the sake of a <HI>bon-mot.</HI> And even this circumstance of the apostle's having <HI>"left his cloak and his parchments at Troas"</HI> (im∣material as it may seem at first sight) is not to be esteemed <HI>"of no importance at all;"</HI> for this teaches us that the apostle <Q><HI>though under a</HI> WATCHFUL PROVIDENCE) <HI>found it necessary to provide against such natural insirmities as it is committed to the guardianship of human care to fence against; and, though he was in∣structed with an abundance of revelations,</HI></Q> (yet) <Q><HI>that did not supersede the necessity and use of books, for such improvement in knowledge as was within the power of human industry.</HI></Q> (See Mr. Ridley's Sermon preached before the hon. Trustees for establishing the Colony of Georgia, and the Associates of Dr. Bray, in 1746, p. 15.) These <HI>occurrences,</HI> therefore, I hope, will at length prove both <HI>"important"</HI> and <HI>"profitable"</HI> even to the celebrated writer himself; because a careful review of them, as <HI>related in scripture,</HI> must convince him that he has been too hasty and superficial in his citations; where∣by he himself stands as much in need of <HI>"reproof"</HI> as his celebrated writings do of <HI>"correction;"</HI> so that his good sense, I hope, will incline him to <HI>profit</HI> by the <HI>"instruction"</HI> which necessarily arises from these two <HI>humiliating</HI> circumstances: and, if ever he should con∣ceive that I may be able to assist his farther <HI>improve∣ment</HI> by the removal of any apprehended disticulties, he may assuredly command my best endeavours.</P></NOTE> found∣ed,

<PB N="170" REF="171"/>and <HI>consequently proves nothing</HI> that he has aimed at! because his <HI>ingenious</HI> arguments,
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>against all honest endeavours to reform national abuses, and against every plan
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>that has yet been proposed for lessening the corruptions of <HI>parliament,</HI> hold e∣qually
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>good against <HI>having any parliament at all!</HI> and, when we find that this appa∣rent
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>tendency of his arguments is not only a necessary conclusion to be drawn
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>from thence, (exactly what an opponent would wish to fix upon him,) but, also, that it is a conclusion expressly acknow∣ledged, even in his own words, (see p. 17. that <Q><HI>those, who cannot make shift with such a parliament, must have none,</HI></Q> &amp;c.) we may fairly suppose, that he is not more serious in this than in most of his other positions, and, of course, that <Q><HI>the schemes presented to the public by real and pretended patriots, that is,</HI></Q> (as he says,) <Q><HI>by those who have more honesty than sense, and those who have more
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>sense than honesty,</HI></Q> are not the only ob∣jects of this subtle writer's irony, but that he meant equally to ridicule the whole pack of their yelping <HI>opponents,</HI> even his staunch old friends, the pen∣sioned advocates for <HI>corruption</HI> and <Q><HI>good government,</HI></Q> (as they are pleased to call it,) by setting them full cry upon false scents of untenable arguments!</P>
<P>But, if I am deceived in attributing to him a deeper <HI>"sense,"</HI> and more <HI>"honesty"</HI> at bottom, than, perhaps, he is willing to acknowledge, yet I should be sorry to fall into the contrary extreme of imputing to him any degree of that unhappy dispro∣portion between <HI>"sense"</HI> and <HI>"honesty"</HI> which he himself, without the least scru∣ple, so quaintly and facetiously imputes to every other person that has written upon the subject! Common charity, therefore, obliges me to give him credit, at least, for the <HI>honesty</HI> of meaning well, howso∣ever
<PB N="177" REF="178"/>wide his arguments may be from truth and loyalty; and, as to his <HI>sense,</HI> I have never presumed to question it, but only the <HI>use,</HI> or rather the <HI>abuse,</HI> he has made of it; for, after all, my hopes of being pardoned, for the freedom of these remarks, must rely on his <HI>good sense,</HI> and I sincerely desire to experience so notable an instance of it, though I am far from expecting the farther satisfaction of <HI>re∣ceiving his thanks</HI> for my labour and pains in searching and proposing an <HI>effectual re∣medy</HI> to the <HI>"one capital defect"</HI> of his most eligible plan of reformation, because a removal of this <HI>defect</HI> (in his opinion, it seems) would deprive the <HI>favoured</HI> plan of <HI>"its chief excellence,"</HI> viz. its sup∣posed <HI>impracticability;</HI> an <HI>excellence,</HI> how∣ever, to be relished only by professed <HI>enemies to reformation and order!</HI> <Q><HI>To be convinced of the</HI> IMPRACTICABILITY <HI>of this scheme,</HI></Q> (says he in p. 6.) <Q><HI>let

<P>But it is more reasonable, in the first place, to consider the actual state of things; <HI>"let us,"</HI> therefore, rather <Q><HI>fi∣gure to ourselves</HI></Q> (what is really the case at present) <Q><HI>multitudes of all descrip∣tions and denominations</HI></Q> actually <Q><HI>call∣ed out</HI></Q> (not indeed <Q><HI>to exercise their</HI> RIGHT <HI>of voting,</HI></Q> but what is far more dangerous to the community) <Q><HI>to exercise</HI></Q> the WRONG <HI>of preventing others from voting,</HI> by tumultuously ob∣structing every avenue to the poll-books, and raving with all the horrible malice that the devil and drunkenness can inspire, that they may intimidate and hinder quiet electors, that really <Q><HI>have the right of voting,</HI></Q> from <HI>"exercising their right!"</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>so that <HI>elections</HI> can be no longer <HI>free</HI> whilst such notorious <HI>menacing,</HI> and open violence, is so generally tolerated! <Q><HI>Let us,</HI></Q> also, <HI>"figure to ourselves"</HI> (for the horrible scenes have been too recently im∣printed on our memories to be easily ef∣faced) these suborned <Q><HI>multitudes of all descriptions,</HI></Q> and beyond all description, or of no description at all, as much <Q><HI>in∣flamed by contest and intoxicated by li∣quor</HI></Q> as they possibly could be, even if admitted to a <HI>"right of voting;"</HI> <Q><HI>weavers from their looms, and miners from tinneries and coal-pits; sailors from their ships, and soldiers from their quarters; to whom we must add,</HI></Q> (as the celebrated author has done,) <Q><HI>thou∣sands of thieves, smugglers, rogues, va∣gabonds, and vagrants;</HI></Q> and <Q><HI>we must add,</HI></Q> also, select troops of Irish chairmen from the environs of the polite gaming-houses, and whole bands of jour∣neymen
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>butchers, the very scum and offal of all the shambles brandishing their formidable cleavers! <Q><HI>I say, let us figure to ourselves all these respectable</HI></Q> hinder∣ers and obstructors of <HI>free</HI> election, <Q><HI>let loose</HI></Q> not only for <HI>"one day,"</HI> but for many days together, <Q><HI>throughout every part of the kingdom, and such a scene of confusion, of drunkenness and riot, of rapine</HI></Q> and even of <HI>"murder!"</HI> &amp;c. <HI>"will present itself"</HI> (by due recollection of very recent facts, more strongly than by mere <HI>imagination</HI>) <HI>"as must shock us,"</HI> indeed, <HI>"with horror,"</HI> and ought, there∣fore, to convince us, that we already ex∣perience the most consummate mischiefs and inconveniencies that can possibly arise either from the <HI>multitude</HI> or the <HI>mean∣ness</HI> of the persons that usually attend elections! What then must we think of the <HI>morality</HI> and <HI>patriotism</HI> of those persons, who regularly oppose every attempt to
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>reform these intolerable grievances and corruptions?</P>
<P>With respect to the <HI>danger</HI> which the celebrated author apprehends from all the rabble being <Q><HI>let loose in one day throughout every part of the kingdom,</HI></Q> it is a mere bugbear: are they not, at present, frequently <Q><HI>let loose in one day throughout every part of the kingdom,</HI></Q> even <HI>"one day"</HI> in every week? Nay, are they not at liberty <HI>any day,</HI> or <HI>every day,</HI> to be as <HI>"loose,"</HI> if they please, as those haughty persons who falsely esteem themselves so much their betters? and yet, perhaps, they are <HI>not more licencious,</HI> though certainly <HI>much less guilty,</HI> than their unprincipled CORRUPTORS, a great ma∣jority of <HI>"the honourable gentlemen,"</HI> as they call themselves, who solicit their favour at elections, to whom <HI>all the mobs</HI> and <HI>all the mischiefs,</HI> on those occasions, are chiefly to be attributed! for those
<PB N="182" REF="183"/>men who bribe, treat, lead, and excite, these disorderly <HI>multitudes,</HI> cannot surely be exempted, by their rank, titles, or fortunes, from being deemed a <HI>part of the mob,</HI> when they are notoriously the most <HI>guilty and vicious part</HI> of it, by being principals and movers of the rabble!</P>
<P>And such men should remember that the vile practice of <HI>opening houses, for elec∣tion purposes,</HI> is a species of <HI>bribery,</HI> not only the most <HI>pernicious</HI> to the people and kingdom, but also the most effectually <HI>degrading</HI> to themselves; because they are thereby absolutely <HI>incapacitated, in law,</HI> to take their seats, (see note in p. 48.) and therefore all those persons, that may fairly be convicted of this most <HI>pernicious</HI> and <HI>degrading</HI> misdemeanour, ought most certainly (for the honour of the house) to be ejected! <Q><HI>Let us also figure to ourselves</HI></Q> the present inconvenient and hopeless method of <HI>determining dis∣puted
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>and undue elections,</HI> and also the <HI>lamentable number of them,</HI> by which the precious time and attention of the great <HI>national council</HI> must be principally en∣grossed, to the manifest hindrance of na∣tional business: whereas in ancient times, when <HI>general elections</HI> throughout the kingdom were <Q><HI>every year once and more often if need be;</HI></Q> viz. previous to <HI>every session</HI> of parliament, though the <HI>sessions</HI> were held not only <HI>annually,</HI> but often twice, and sometimes three and four times in a year, yet <Q><HI>there were not above two or three cases of elections questioned, or complained of, for above</HI> 200 <HI>years!</HI></Q> (see "the Legal Means of Political Reformation, p. 32 and 55.) so that a restoration of our ancient parlia∣mentary rights, and a due reformation of modern abuses and <HI>innovations,</HI> are unquestionably necessary to be demanded now that the exercise of our inestimable franchises are sunk down (through the
<PB N="184" REF="185"/><HI>enormous disproportion</HI> of popular Repre∣sentation) to the <HI>very lowest degree</HI> of pos∣sible existence, and that all our public circumstances are really tainted with the most <HI>noxious corruption</HI> imaginable! ex∣ceeding any <HI>superlative of it</HI> that can ei∣ther be expressed or even conceived! In short, there is but <HI>one degree lower, in humiliation and baseness,</HI> to which the na∣tion can possibly descend! and that would be to adopt the wicked and <HI>disloyal</HI> posi∣tion of this celebrated writer, viz. that <Q><HI>those who cannot make shift with such a parliament must have none.</HI></Q> For to be contented, like him, <Q><HI>to make shift with such a parliament</HI></Q> would certainly be the <HI>lowest degree</HI> of <HI>parliamentary corrup∣tion;</HI> for it cannot descend any lower, as I have already remarked, without ac∣tually losing its existence, and therefore <HI>the one degree lower</HI> would be to admit this gentleman's baneful alternative, the

<P>The <HI>necessity,</HI> therefore, of <Q><HI>a parlia∣mentary reform</HI></Q> is UNQUESTIONABLE, notwithstanding this celebrated writer's <HI>"Thoughts"</HI> to the contrary; and the <HI>prac∣ticability</HI> of it will be equally certain, if the <HI>constitutional remedy</HI> to the present national <HI>immorality</HI> and <HI>corruption</HI> is but previously applied, viz. a due <HI>re-establishment of the ancient</HI> VIEW <HI>of</HI> FRANKPLEDGE, with all its <HI>just</HI> and <HI>legal</HI> usages and appen∣dages; for this is the true <HI>state-antiseptic</HI> which will sicken the <HI>worms of undue in∣fluence</HI> and put an effectual stop to their baneful progress on the vitals of the Eng∣lish constitution; especially if some far∣ther reasonable and very necessary heads of <HI>enquiry</HI> be added to the <HI>articles of an∣nual inquest,</HI> which I have already stated in pages 112 to 132, and ought to be in∣serted

<P>Item, (34.) Whether the <Q><HI>Elections of members to parliament have been free∣ly and indifferently made without charge or expence,</HI></Q> as required by the laws of this kingdom? See 7 and 8 W. III. c.iv. A.D. 1695. and 2 Geo. II. c. 24. A. D. 1729. What person or persons have re∣ceived <HI>bribes</HI> of any kind, or have <HI>eaten or drunk</HI> (the most pernicious participation of <HI>bribery</HI>) at the expence of others du∣ring the time of an <HI>election?</HI> The penalty of receiving any <HI>"reward whatsoever"</HI> on such occasions is 500l. besides an <HI>incapa∣city</HI> from ever voting again: see stat. 2 Geo. II. c. 24. And <HI>meat and drink, entertain∣ment or provision,</HI> are expressly deemed articles of <HI>reward</HI> in the previous statute of king William. See note in p. 48.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188"/>35. What attornies, or other persons, have been agents in distributing money, or other reward of any kind, or in pro∣mising reward or emolument during the time of an election?</P>
<P>36. What public houses have been <HI>opened</HI> (a term sufficiently understood by the notorious practice of it) for the pur∣pose of influencing any election, after the teste of the writ, or after the place be∣came vacant? and who hath paid (or hath undertaken to pay, and is, directly or in∣directly, responsible) for the expences incurred by such public and unlawful en∣tertainment? If the proofs on this head can be fairly traced, so as to criminate the <HI>persons elected,</HI> they are thereby effectual∣ly incapacitated from holding their un∣justly-acquired seats in parliament, and by virtue of the above-mentioned statute of 7 and 8 William III. are <Q><HI>to be deemed and taken</HI> no <HI>members in parliament,
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>and shall not act, sit, or have any vote or place,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>as if they had never been returned or elected members for the par∣liament;</HI></Q> and the act does not limit the conviction to any fixed period of time after the offence; so that there is ample leisure and opportunity for researches on that head; which all true friends to the <HI>honour and dignity of parliament</HI> ought to promote.</P>
<P>37. What publican or victualler hath supplied <Q>meat, drink, <HI>entertainment,</HI> or <HI>provision,</HI></Q> during the time of an elec∣tion, to any person or persons whom they might justly have suspected of not intend∣ing to pay for the same at their own cost and charge? For, in this case, the publican is as much a criminal agent in <HI>bribery,</HI> as the petty-fogging attorney who <HI>bribes</HI> with cash, notes, or promises, and is equally liable to all the penalties of <HI>bribery.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="190"/>38. And what person hath made any disbursements or expenditure whatsoever, either in his own behalf, or in trust for others, or even promise of expenditure, or repayment, directly or indirectly, to promote such dishonest and baneful prac∣tices against the peace and welfare of the community?</P>
<P>There is no doubt but that regular <HI>an∣nual</HI> enquiries upon oath, in all parts of the kingdom, on these points, would put an effectual stop to the <HI>expences</HI> and <HI>cor∣ruption</HI> of elections, and consequently to the <HI>tumults</HI> and other immoralities of them, whereby the trite argument against the <HI>constitutional frequency of elections</HI> would, of course, be superseded; so that the ancient right of newly electing our representatives for <HI>every session of parlia∣ment</HI> might again be happily restored, without either <HI>inconvenience</HI> to the elec∣tors, or <HI>expence</HI> to the candidates.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="191"/>And lastly, as the original intention of these legal divisions of the people into <HI>tithings</HI> and <HI>hundreds</HI> was obviously for <HI>military,</HI> as well as <HI>civil,</HI> purposes, some other additional articles of enquiry will also be necessary to re-establish and main∣tain the ancient <HI>legal military duties</HI> of the people in a regular WATCH and WARD throughout the kingdom, in order to prevent every species of <HI>robbery, riot,</HI> or other <HI>violence</HI> whatsoever, by in∣ternal enemies, as well as to be thorough∣ly prepared, without the enormous and ruinous expence which at present is thought necessary against the apprehen∣sion of invasions by foreign enemies.</P>
<P>That this was an ancient object of en∣quiry at <HI>views of Frankpledge</HI> is manifest, by the article which I cited from <HI>Fleta,</HI> in p. 138. n. viz. <Q><HI>Item de vigiliis non obser∣vatis.</HI></Q> <Q><HI>Also concerning watches not duly observed.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="192"/>That the ancient and true constitution of the English state absolutely requires every man (the clergy and judges except∣ed) to have <HI>arms,</HI> and to be duly <HI>trained</HI> and <HI>exercised</HI> in the use of them, I have amply proved in my <Q><HI>Tracts on the Means of National Defence;</HI></Q> so that, from thence, it will be very easy to form such <HI>additional articles of enquiry</HI> as may be ne∣cessary to restore and preserve these two great national objects, the <HI>general arming</HI> and <HI>training</HI> of the people to military ser∣vices, in WATCH and WARD; whereby the imaginary necessity of maintaining <HI>a numerous standing army in constant pay</HI> (the most dangerous and unconstitutional of all our modern <HI>innovations</HI>) will be effectually superseded, and, of course, a probable means and opportunity would thereby be laid open to a <HI>virtuous</HI> admi∣nistration of government (a title that will most certainly be due to any administra∣tion that shall adopt and restore the <HI>just</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="193"/>and <HI>free</HI> constitution of <HI>tithings</HI> and <HI>hun∣dreds</HI> in their ancient <HI>legal</HI> purity) of crowning their success, in reformation, with an effectual reduction of the <HI>national debt</HI> and <HI>taxes,</HI> by means of the great annual savings that would arise from a proper <HI>gradual decrease</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I say a <HI>gradual decrease,</HI> because I wish the reduc∣tion of our armies to be made without injury or any material inconvenience to the brave officers and men that have faithfully served therein, to whom are certain∣ly due all the kindness and reasonable liberality that the nation can afford to shew them: and, though I am a <HI>professed</HI> enemy to STANDING ARMIES in general, yet, at the same time, I <HI>profess,</HI> and really entertain, a very cordial regard and benevolence to the deserving <HI>indivi∣duals,</HI> of which they are composed. The kind of re∣duction, therefore, which I wish to see, is such as they themselves, I believe, would not think either <HI>unjust</HI> or <HI>hard</HI> upon them: and yet, I trust, that <HI>the savings,</HI> arising from it, would be as <HI>effectual</HI> and <HI>speedy</HI> as those of any other plan that the nation can (with consistent honour and due liberality to the parties) adopt. Let us, therefore, suppose a reduction to be made <HI>by time</HI> rather than by the <HI>involuntary discharge</HI> of any one; and by putting an <HI>entire step to recruiting, and to the granting of any new commissions,</HI> rather than by the <HI>stoppage</HI> of pay. Let <HI>discharges,</HI> however, be <HI>freely granted</HI> to all that <HI>request</HI> them; and let <HI>liberal bounties</HI> (in proportion to rank and pay) be given, to incite <HI>such requests;</HI> that industrious subaltern officers and men may be encoura∣ged and enabled to engage themselves in <HI>civil</HI> occupa∣tions. A preference should also be given, in the dis∣posal of lucrative <HI>civil</HI> employments under the crown, (in such employments, I mean, as are necessary to be continued) to deserving officers that are properly quali∣fied for them, provided they give up their <HI>military</HI> com∣missions and profession; which would much hasten the reduction of the army and <HI>its expences.</HI></P>
<P>The corps of <HI>Engineers</HI> and the regiment of <HI>Artillery,</HI> however, are branches of the military establishment which cannot so safely be reduced, or, at least, not in so great a degree, as the other military corps, because they cannot so easily as other regiments be raised again, in case of any sudden want of them; a regular education being necessary for <HI>engineers</HI> and <HI>artillery</HI> officers in the study of mathematics, projectiles, mechanics, military architecture, surveying, drawing, &amp;c. But a proper establishment in these two branches (duly maintained in study and practice) would, in case of any sudden emergency, enable the <HI>present national militia,</HI> and the <HI>trained hundreds</HI> and <HI>thousands,</HI> or HOSTS of the people, in their <HI>rotations</HI> of service, to oppose, with sufficient ef∣fect, any power (humanly speaking) that could possibly be brought against them. I have here supposed the <HI>na∣tional militia</HI> to remain on its present establishment; for, though I contend that the <HI>hundreds</HI> and <HI>tithings,</HI> when duly <HI>trained,</HI> form the true <HI>constitutional militia</HI> of this kingdom, yet, until that happy legal constitution can be so effectually re-established as to be deemed of itself suf∣ficient for the national defence, I should be very un∣willing to propose any alteration in the present establish∣ment of militia for the counties, except, indeed, some such obvious amendments as may render it less burden∣some and ruinous to poor labourers, by throwing a more adequate proportion of the expence upon those that can better afford it: and also to prevent any man from being detained from home (after he is duly disciplined) longer than <HI>a month</HI> (or six weeks at most) at any one time in actual service, lest he should thereby lose his <HI>civil</HI> occu∣pation and become a <HI>mere</HI> soldier.

<P>I must, however, remark, that this quotation is ta∣ken from that part of K. Edward's laws which is printed in <HI>italics</HI> in Mr. Lambard's edition, and which Mr. Prynne calls a <HI>"spurious addition,"</HI> and he cites a much higher authority (that of the learned Abp. Usher) for the same opinion. Mr. Lambard himself, however, informs us, that there were two different exemplars, the one <Q><HI>per antiquum,</HI></Q> "very ancient;" and "the other" (says he) <Q><HI>is not, indeed, so ancient; which, however, con∣tains more</HI></Q> (<Q>alterum non ita sanè vetus, quod tamen plura complectatur.</Q>) And he informs us, that he himself, <Q><HI>after making a diligent comparison of them, had joined both together, in such a manner, however,</HI></Q> (says he,) <Q><HI>that the whole of the old exemplar is expressed in the</HI> LARGER <HI>letters,</HI></Q> (i. e. the Roman,) <Q><HI>but whatever is expressed in the</HI> LESSER <HI>characters</HI></Q> <HI>(the Italics)</HI> <Q>is to be attributed (says he) to <HI>the</HI> LATER <HI>copy</HI></Q> (<Q>quae minoribus vero describuntur caracteribus, ea recen∣tiori sunt tribuenda.</Q> But he does not express the least suspicion that the latter is <HI>spurious;</HI> and he was surely a very competent judge of that matter, as being one of the most eminent antiquarians of his time. And the rev. Dr. David Wilkins, who printed an edition of the Anglo-Saxon Laws, in 1721, has set forth the laws of K. Ed∣ward, without distinguishing▪ by Roman and Italic let∣ters, the various readings of the two eminent exemplars before mentioned, (as Lambard and Whelock had done before him,) so that he manifestly thought it right to adopt the additions in <HI>italics,</HI> as properly belonging to the text (though rejected by Mr. Prynne,) or he would not thus have omitted the distinctions between the two exemplars.</P>
<P>Whatever objections Abp. Usher might have had to some of the historical circumstances related in this ex∣emplar of K. Edward's laws, (as, for instance, the cor∣respondence between pope <HI>Elutherius</HI> and the British king <HI>Lucius,</HI> the extensive conquests of king <HI>Arthur,</HI> &amp;c.) yet, as these circumstances were generally received for histo∣rical <HI>facts</HI> long before the fourth year of K.

<P>And, as to Mr. Prynne's exception in his brief animad∣versions, &amp;c. on the fourth part of the Institutes, &amp;c. compiled by Sir Edw. Coke, p. 189.) it is manifestly founded on a mere <HI>literal</HI> error of the transcriber of the M. S. which by no means injures the general credit of the copy, and its other contents. Mr. Prynne says, <Q>I cannot but take notice of one grosse mistake, in the <HI>spurious addition</HI> to the laws of K. Edward the con∣fessor, in Mr. Lambert, cited in the 2d Inst. p. 70. concerning the antiquity of the <HI>folkmote,</HI> or <HI>court leet;</HI> and administering the oath of allegiance in it to the people; <HI>ad defendendum regnum,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Hanc legem inve∣nit</HI> ARTHURUS (<HI>qui quondam fuit inclytissimus rex</HI> BRI∣TONUM) <HI>et ita consolidavit et confoederavit regnum</HI> BRI∣TANNIAE <HI>universum semper in unum. Hujus legis</HI> AU∣THORITATE</Q> (meaning the authority or happy ef∣fect of free-<HI>folkmotes,</HI> or <HI>court-leets,</HI> i. e. the incompara∣ble constitution of <HI>Frankpledge,</HI> which I now wish to recommend for the same purpose, viz. to <HI>unite</HI> the whole nation in one <HI>confederated</HI> body by a universal establish∣ment of <HI>the law which Arthur found,</HI> with all its just and legal usages) <Q><HI>expulit</HI> ARTHURUS <HI>praedictus</HI> SARA∣CENOS <HI>et inimicos a regno.</HI> When, as it is most clear</Q> (says Mr. Prynne) <Q>by Galfridus Monmuthensis, Mat. Westminster, Radulfus Cestrensis, Ponticus Verum∣nius, &amp;c. An. Dom. 516 to 542; and other our an∣cient and modern historians, who write of king <HI>Arthur,</HI> record, that he <HI>only</HI> fought his several battles with the <HI>Saxons,</HI> Scots, Picts, whom he expelled out of the realm, but not with the SARACENS, who never infested nor entered our <HI>Island,</HI> nor mention any such oath, law, court, prescribed or held by him.</Q> Now that K. ARTHUR <HI>fought</HI> with the <HI>Saxons, Scots, Picts,</HI> &amp;c. must be readily allowed, and also that he <HI>fought not</HI> with the SARACENS; but if we consider the men∣tion of "SARACENOS" as a mere literary mistake of an ignorant transcriber for SCANIOS or SCANDIOS, (an an∣cient name, much less known to the vulgar at the time when this copy was wrote, than that of the SARACENS,) there will be no cause for farther cavil against the authen∣ticity of the copy, because such a mistake in a copy ought not to injure the credit of the original compiler of the work. And that the word SCANIOS, or SCANDIOS, was really intended, is manifest from the context (two pages farther) wherein express mention is made of K. <HI>Arthur</HI>'s conquest of <HI>Scantia</HI> and <HI>Gutland,</HI> the countries from whence proceeded the most of Arthur's enemies, even the <HI>Saxons</HI> themselves originally, (see Sheringham de Anglorum Gentis Origine,) if not the <HI>Picts</HI> also, the very nations mentioned by Mr. Prynne himself, and also by all the authors to whom he has appealed.</P>
<P>There is just such another <HI>mere literal</HI> mistake, a few pages farther, which, without proper warning, might still farther induce a superficial reader to suspect the au∣thenticity of the exemplar; I mean the passage where mention is made of the election of king Ina, viz. <Q><HI>qui electus suit in regem per</HI> ANGELUM,</Q> <Q><HI>who was elected king through</HI></Q> (or by means of) "AN ANGEL, (a very improbable circumstance,) instead of the obvious meaning of the original writer, i. e. "<HI>per</HI> ANGLIAM" "<HI>throughout</HI> ENGLAND." For, this latter sense is clear∣ly supported by the context immediately following, which relates, that <Q><HI>Ina first obtained the monarchy of this</HI> WHOLE KINGDOM,</Q> &amp;c. <Q><HI>et qui</HI> PRIMO <HI>obtinuit monarchiam</HI> TOTIUS REGNI HUJUS <HI>post adventum</HI> AN∣GLORUM <HI>in Brytanniam.</HI> PRIMUS <HI>enim fuit rex co∣ronatus</HI> ANGLORUM ET BRYTONUM SIMUL MANEN∣TIUM IN BRITANNIA <HI>post adventum Saxonum,</HI></Q> &amp;c. And a little farther the text relates that he obtained <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Cornwall</HI> by his second wife, as also the con∣secrated British crown, which belonged to the last Bri∣tish king, Cadwallader; so that the circumstance mani∣festly intended to be expressed was the <HI>general acknow∣ledgement of</HI> INA, <HI>as king over both the</HI> ENGLISH and the BRITONS, that is, <HI>"per Angliam,"</HI> <Q><HI>throughout all Eng∣land;</HI></Q> and not <HI>"per Angelum."</HI> Nevertheless these two palpable errors of transcribers have been copied in all the subsequent editions of K. Edward's laws, with∣out the least animadversion of the publishers to clear the original compilers, and their work, from the discredit of such improbable circumstances.</P>
<P>With respect to Mr. Prynne's objection to the antiqui∣ty of the <HI>hundred</HI> courts, as declared in this addition to K. Edward's laws, viz. that <HI>"Arthur found this law," "Hanc legem invenit Arthurus," &amp;c.</HI> "and so" (by means thereof) <Q><HI>united and confederated the whole king∣dom of Britain into one,</HI></Q> (et ita consolidavit et confoe∣deravit regnum Britanniae universum semper in unum;) and that <Q><HI>by virtue of</HI> THIS LAW <HI>the said Arthur drove the</HI> SCANTIANS (or Scandinavinians) <HI>and enemies out of the kingdom,</HI></Q> &amp;c. I must observe that Mr. Prynne has assigned nothing but <HI>negative evidence</HI> against the fact, which is by no means sufficient to disprove it. On the other hand, as <HI>Arthur</HI> did really succeed in <HI>uniting</HI> and <HI>strengthening</HI> the kingdom against his <HI>enemies,</HI> the other part of the sentence is the more probable, (that <Q><HI>he found this law,</HI></Q>) because he certainly could not have pur∣sued a more effectual and speedy means of restoring a divided and weakened kingdom than by reviving and enforcing <HI>"this law,"</HI> which he is said to have <HI>found;</HI> and, had he been as careful, <HI>after his success, to maintain "this law,"</HI> and to establish it in the countries which he conquered, with <HI>free</HI> and <HI>equal</HI> liberty to all the inhabitants, the happy effects of his success would not have had so short a duration.</P>
<P>For, though the Britons certainly <HI>had "this law"</HI> both before and after the time of <HI>Arthur,</HI> yet they generally <HI>had</HI> it rather in <HI>name</HI> than in <HI>use,</HI> or else they would certainly have been <HI>less dissolute</HI> in their morals, and more <HI>united</HI> and powerful against their enemies. They <HI>had "this law,"</HI> I may say, much in the same manner as we <HI>have</HI> it at this day; it was really the <HI>law of the kingdom,</HI> but not duly maintained; the <HI>nominal divisions</HI> remained, as at present, but these divisions became <HI>local</HI> instead of <HI>popular;</HI> the mere <HI>divisions of space,</HI> instead of exact numerical <HI>divisions of the people,</HI> which <HI>"this law"</HI> requires to be effective. A sufficient answer to Mr. Prynne's objection, against the antiquity of <HI>"this law,"</HI> may be gathered from a former part of this tract, (p. 33-36.) where I have referred to ample evidence that the <HI>divisions of hundreds and tithings</HI> (CENTURIAE

Those <HI>Comitia,</HI> or assemblies of the people of <HI>Rome,</HI> by <HI>Centuries,</HI> where every one gave his vote in his <HI>century.</HI> These sorts of assemblies were first instituted by <HI>Ser∣vius Tullius,</HI> who divided, as is above said, the people into six <HI>classes,</HI> and each <HI>classis</HI> into CENTURIES. These assemblies had a great share in ordering of all state affairs, for they were summoned toge∣ther to make great officers, to approve any new law, to proclaim war against any people, and to implead any citizen of Rome after his death. They also chose the consuls, praetors, censors, and sometimes the proconsuls and chief priests,</Q> &amp;c. See Danet's Dict. of Greek and Roman antiquities. What difficulty then can there be in supposing that <HI>"Arthur found this law"</HI> among the <HI>Britons,</HI> who so lately before had been incorporated in the <HI>Roman</HI> colonies of this island?</NOTE> and DECURIAE

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">At the time when K.

In a case solemnly argued in the court of common pleas, even so late as the 5th K.

William I. would be induced, at that time particularly, to prepare collections of their old laws, that they might report and obtain a confir∣mation of them in the parliament that was then called (a regular <HI>jury</HI> of 12 <HI>"sapientes, et sua lege eruditos," "wise or discrete men, and learned in their law,"</HI> being required to be <HI>elected</HI> and deputed by each county) ex∣pressly for the purpose of <HI>reporting these laws:</HI> and that <HI>historical</HI> parts were probably added to some one of the collections even at that time (for no subsequent <HI>time</HI> was so likely to give occasion for such an addition) by some one or more of these <HI>learned</HI> representatives, in order to assert the <HI>antiquity</HI> as well as the <HI>certain efficacy</HI> of the excellent constitution of <HI>Frankpledge,</HI> by the emi∣nent examples of the <HI>British</HI> K.

<P>And the same law also commanded a just and exact observance of the <HI>watch</HI> duty, which could be no otherwise, in those ancient times, than by a regular <HI>rotation</HI> of all the people, in <HI>gyrum,</HI> as described in king William's law, and they were afterwards carefully to provide a∣gainst fires, when they returned home to their houses. <Q><HI>Et ut</HI> WARDAE, (i. e. vigiliae vel custodiae) <HI>justè et ritè obser∣ventur, et ut cautè deinceps incendiis

<P>The duty of <HI>watch</HI> and <HI>guard,</HI> by the people, was deemed so very important in ancient times, (and surely ought still so to be,) especially in towns and places of more than ordinary resort, that the law prohibited the holding of <HI>markets</HI> and <HI>fairs</HI> in all places except those that were duly <HI>enclosed</HI> and <HI>fortified,</HI> and, in which, of course, the inhabitants ought, accord∣ing to the common law, to perform the duties of <HI>watch and guard,</HI> and be always <HI>prepared and trained in arms,</HI> as above described, for <HI>the entire service of the king,</HI> in the true legal sense of service, i. e. for the preservation of the <HI>king's peace</HI> in the effectual prevention of all <HI>tumults</HI> and <HI>riots;</HI> for aiding and assisting the king's courts and their <HI>legal</HI> officers in <Q><HI>the due process of the law,</HI></Q> and for the effec∣tual security of all peaceable traders and

<PB N="213" REF="214"/>establishment for maintaining the <HI>common law,</HI> and the <HI>dignities of the crown,</HI> and for doing all things <HI>in due form,</HI> and <HI>by</HI> JUDGEMENT <HI>and</HI> JUSTICE, which certainly could not, in any other way, be effected, than by these <HI>numerical divisions of the people;</HI> in which the magistracy was always duly proportioned to the <HI>number of inhabitants,</HI> so that whether they were <HI>many</HI> or <HI>few,</HI> they were all <HI>equally</HI> ma∣nageable. And the <HI>rotation</HI> of duty, by being regularly <HI>circulated</HI> amongst <HI>all</HI> men, was reduced and rendered easy to <HI>all.</HI> The cities of the Israelites under the theocracy had the same proportion of magistrates exactly which our common law requires, and also regular <HI>rotations</HI> of public ser∣vice; but it does not appear that they had our happy constitution of <HI>juries,</HI> where∣by unexceptionable and impartial persons <HI>from among the people,</HI> that are neighbours to the parties and the facts, in every cause,
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>are appointed the LEGAL JUDGES of it. Had this indispensable constitution been a part of <HI>their</HI> law, as it is of <HI>ours,</HI> it is probable they would not so soon have fallen away from <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>judgement:</HI> for they had no sufficient guard against <HI>partiality.</HI> If a man was accused, he had no right to reject the magistrate from being <HI>his judge,</HI> even though he knew him to be <HI>his enemy,</HI> or the friend and favourer of his accuser: whereas in Eng∣land, a man may challenge and reject 35 jurymen, if he thinks fit, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evious to the trial of a charge of <HI>treason,</HI> and 20 jurymen previous to trials for any other <HI>felonies,</HI> without assigning any reason against them, which is called <HI>peremptory challenge;</HI> and he may <HI>challenge</HI> as many more as he can produce <HI>just</HI> and <HI>legal</HI> exceptions against, which is called <HI>"challenge with cause."</HI> The total want of this just regulation laid the <HI>magistrates</HI> of the <HI>Israelitish cities</HI> more
<PB N="215" REF="216"/>open to the temptation of <HI>bribery</HI> than they would otherwise have been; and after∣wards, under the monarchy, when these <HI>heads of thousands</HI> were appointed by the king, instead of the people, the want of <HI>juries</HI> became still more apparent; for, if the process against any man was di∣rected by the king's letters, or under his seal, as in the case of <HI>Naboth,</HI> the judges were tempted to preserve only the mere outward form of the law, without the spirit and intention of it: they would not <HI>condemn</HI> indeed without a <HI>legal number of witnesses</HI> were set up to accuse, but then there was no <HI>jury</HI> to determine whether or not these accusers were <HI>credible wit∣nesses,</HI> which the law equally required at that time, as it does at present. But in every other respect the government of the <HI>Israelitish cities</HI> seems (as I have said) to have been similar to what our <HI>common law</HI> requires. The Rev. Dr. <HI>Sam. Croxall,</HI>
<PB N="216" REF="217"/>formerly archdeacon of <HI>Salop,</HI> has drawn up an account of the <HI>Rulers of Cities</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See his SCRIPTURE POLITICS, chap. 8. §. xv. concerning <HI>the</HI> RULERS <HI>of</HI> CITIES, p. 465, 466, 467, 468, 471, 472, 473, 475, 476, 477.</P>
<P><Q>The <HI>third wheel</HI> of their government, which, as we mentioned before, <HI>turned within the other two,</HI> was the constitution and magistracy <HI>of every city within itself.</HI> As the weight of superintending the affairs of every <HI>tribe</HI> was much lightened to the <HI>prince</HI> thereof, by the subordinate jurisdiction of the <HI>heads of families;</HI> the political burden of these latter was, in like manner, considerably alleviated by the share of authority which appertained to the <HI>rulers of cities:</HI> Every tribe having several cities belonging to it, and every city being inhabited by a great number of families.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The chief magistrate in these corporations was cal∣led the <HI>ruler</HI> of <HI>the city.</HI></Q> * * * *</P>
<P><Q>Some have questioned whether there were not more than one of these chief magistrates in every city: That there <HI>were many subordinate ones, having gradual authority under one another, is very plain;</HI> and that these were the same whom <HI>Moses</HI> constituted <HI>to be judges of the people in the wilderness,</HI> by the advice of <HI>Jethro</HI> his father-in-law. Exod. xviii. 25. <HI>He chose able men out of all Israel,</HI></Q> (but I have already proved that the <HI>able men</HI> were really elected by the people,) <Q><HI>and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</HI> And <HI>they judged the people at all seasons: The hard causes they brought unto</HI> Moses, <HI>but every small matter they judged themselves.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>When, therefore, the tribes came to <HI>have cities belonging to them, there these magistrates presided and exercised their jurisdiction.</HI> Which consisted princi∣pally of these three parts. <HI>First,</HI> to <HI>convene and hold senates and councils,</HI> in order to enact such <HI>by-laws as were expedient for that body corporate, of which they were members.</HI> Secondly, <HI>to commission and authorise the judges to enter upon and to determine, in the judiciary way, such small matters as lay properly within their cog∣nizance.</HI> And, thirdly, <HI>to make a part of the great council of the nation, as often as it was summoned to as∣semble by that person who held the helm of government.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>These are they who are intended in that precept, where it is said, Deut. xvi. 18. <HI>judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout thy tribes.</HI> Which <HI>officers</HI> we find mentioned upon other occasions. Deut. xxix. 10. <HI>Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers.</HI> Again, <HI>Moses</HI> says, Deut. xxxi. 28. <HI>Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your offi∣cers.</HI> And we find <HI>Joshua,</HI> when he was <HI>old and stricken in age,</HI> Joshua xxiii. 2. <HI>called for all</HI> Israel, <HI>and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>So when <HI>David</HI> calls together the <HI>great congrega∣tion</HI> to declare his purpose about the building of the temple, 1 Chron. xxviii. 1. we read of <HI>the captains over the thousands, and the captains over the hundreds, with the officers,</HI> being summoned upon that occasion. And, afterwards, we are told that <HI>Solomon</HI> made a speech <HI>unto all</HI> Israel, 2 Chron. i. 2. <HI>to the captains of thou∣sands, and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all</HI> Israel, <HI>the chief of the fathers.</HI> And thus, when that pious prince <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was resolved upon a reformation both of religion and manners, throughout his kingdom, it is said, 2 Chron. xxix. 20. <HI>Then</HI> Hezekiah <HI>the king rose early, and gathered the ru∣lers of the city, and went up to the house of the Lord.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>As to their judiciary capacity, they were not, strict∣ly speaking, judges themselves, but had the power of admitting what causes they thought were proper to come before the judges, and of rejecting what they looked upon as frivolous or unnecessary to be enqui∣red into. * * * * * *</Q></P>
<P><Q>Of the judiciary authority of these rulers, we read farther in the case of <HI>Jeremiah.</HI> When (another) <HI>Micaiah</HI> had heard his prophetical denunciations against <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> Jer. xxxvi. 11. he went down <HI>into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber, where all the princes</HI> (these rulers) <HI>were sitting,</HI> and inform∣ed them of it. And after, when <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was going out of the city into the land of Benjamin, <HI>Irijah,</HI> who suspected that he was going to desert to the army of the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> who were lately broken up from besieging the city, Jer. xxxvii. 12. <HI>took</HI> Jeremiah <HI>and brought him to the princes. Wherefore the princes were wroth with</HI> Jeremiah, <HI>and smote him, and put him in prison.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>And upon his farther prophesying that <HI>the city should be given into the band of the king of</HI> Babylon, <HI>Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death. Then</HI> Zedekiah <HI>the king said, Behold he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.</HI> Which shews that they bore a mighty sway in the <HI>great council</HI> of the nation; and that, when they prayed judgement and execution against any one, even the king thought it most safe and prudent to comply with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The number of these <HI>rulers,</HI> in every city, was in proportion to the number of its inhabitants; as many <HI>thousands</HI> as it contained, so many <HI>rulers,</HI> of that rank and denomination, belonged to it; from which re∣gulation, the estimation and consequence of each city was discernible at one view. And from this consideration arises that fine allusion of one of the pro∣phets concerning the place where Christ should be born; so understood and applied by <HI>the chief priests</HI> and <HI>scribes</HI> themselves, as the Evangelist informs us. Mat. ii. 5. Mic. v. 2. <HI>But thou,</HI> Bethlehem Ephratah, <HI>though thou be little among the thousands of</HI> Judah, (in comparison of those cities that have <HI>rulers of thousands</HI> belonging to them,) <HI>yet out of thee he shall come forth unto me, that is, to be ruler in</HI> Israel; <HI>whose goings forth have been of old, from everlasting.</HI> So exactly was almost every minute circumstance, relating to the Sa∣viour of mankind, delineated and foretold by those divinely-inspired writers, who lived so many hun∣dred years before he came into the world. * *</Q></P>
<P>Captains of Thousands, &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>The rest of the officers that governed the army we find called by the titles of <HI>captains of thousands, cap∣tains of hundreds, captains of fifties, and captains of tens.</HI> Who probably were of the same rank with those whom <HI>Moses</HI> constituted, in the wilderness, <HI>rulers of thousands,</HI> &amp;c. and, at first, acted in a double capa∣city, being at the same time civil magistrates and military officers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>captains of thousands</HI> seem to have been much the same as colonels of regiments with us; and the <HI>captains of hundreds</HI> might probably answer to those who, in our army, have the command of troops and companies; the <HI>captains of fifties</HI> and <HI>tens,</HI> to our su∣balterns, serjeants and corporals.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Among the list of <HI>David</HI>'s adherents while he fled from <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 Chron. xii. 1.14. and <HI>kept himself close at</HI> Ziklag; after several names mentioned, it is said; <HI>These were of the sons of God, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.</HI> Again, we read of others said, 1 Chron. xii. 20. to be <HI>captains of the thousands that were of</HI> Manasseh. And, when <HI>David</HI> had thoughts of bring∣ing the <HI>Ark of God</HI> from <HI>Kirjathjearim,</HI> we are told, 1 Chron. xiii. 1. he <HI>consulted with the captains of thou∣sands, and hundreds, and with every leader.</HI> And again, when he declared his intentions about build∣ing the temple, it is said that he, 1 Chron. xxviii. 1. <HI>assembled all the princes of</HI> Israel, <HI>the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and the captains over the hundreds.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>So when <HI>Jehoiada</HI> the high-priest had a mind to bring on the restoration, by declaring <HI>Joash</HI> to be king, 2 Kings xi. 4. <HI>he sent for the rulers over hundreds, with the captains, and the guard, and shewed them the king's son;</HI> and gave them proper instructions what they were to do. <HI>And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that</HI> Jehoiada <HI>the priest com∣manded. And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king</HI> David<HI>'s spears and shields, that were in the temple of the Lord. And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land, and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord, and be sate on the throne of the kings.</HI> And we read, 2 Kings i. 9, 11, 13. of <HI>three captains of fifties,</HI> who, with their fifties, were sent successively by <HI>Ahaziah,</HI> king of <HI>Israel,</HI> to bring the prophet <HI>Elijah</HI> to him. The Apocryphal writings tell us, 1 Mac. iii. 55. that <HI>Judas ordained captains over the peo∣ple, even captains over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>These officers, from the <HI>captain of the host</HI> down to the lowest subaltern, appear, after the monarchy took place, to have received their commissions from the king.</Q> (Whereas they were before chosen by the people.) <Q>When <HI>Samuel</HI> declares to the people the <HI>manner</HI> of the king that was to reign over them, this is part of it; 1 Sam. viii. 12. <HI>he will appoint him cap∣tains over thousands, and captains over fifties,</HI> &amp;c.

Because, even in K.

And, therefore, all these <HI>amerciaments</HI> must necessarily be understood to have been levied strictly according to the <HI>spirit</HI> of what was afterwards ordained in Magna Charta, i. e. <HI>saving to a man</HI> (according to his rank) his CONTENEMENT, or MERCHANDISE, or <HI>wainage,</HI> with∣out degrading him from his rank and means of liveli∣hood, except the same crime was obstinately repeated: and such <Q><HI>amerciaments were to be made only by the oath of honest and lawful men of the vicinage,</HI></Q> according to the regular usage of all the ancient <HI>leets</HI> and popular courts. The great object of <HI>amerciaments</HI> was to com∣pel <HI>men of all ranks</HI> to respect and observe the laws; whence arose the necessity of varying the quantum of the <HI>mulct</HI> in due proportion to the offender's <HI>ability to pay,</HI> with∣out actually depressing or degrading him from his rank; and of this <HI>due proportion</HI> a jury of the vicinage were the only proper judges.</NOTE>) may perhaps help to explain
<PB N="233" REF="234"/>the nature of the <HI>amerciaments</HI> mention∣ed above for neglect of <HI>summonses.</HI> <Q><HI>Et qui leges apostabit,</HI> (i. e. violarit,) <HI>si fuerit

<P>To increase <HI>amerciaments</HI> on the repe∣tition of <HI>offences</HI> seems to be both just and necessary; but, whether in so enlarged a proportion as that of <HI>doubling the Were</HI> for a second conviction, and forfeiting <HI>all</HI> on a third, may reasonably be questioned; especially as there is no express exception for second and third offences in the <HI>limi∣tation of americaments</HI> ordained by the 14th chapter of <HI>magna charta.</HI> Nevertheless, if we consider that a frequent <HI>repetition</HI> of the <HI>same misdemeanor</HI> is undoubtedly a
<PB N="235" REF="236"/><HI>heinous aggravation</HI> of it, and that it was always so considered <HI>in the common law,</HI> and punished accordingly by an <HI>aggra∣vation of the mulct,</HI> as appears by the <HI>laws</HI> already cited, we shall, perhaps, be in∣clined to believe, that the authors of the said <HI>limitation of mulcts</HI> in Magna Charta, though they certainly intended to regu∣late by it the pecuniary penalties of <HI>crimes in general,</HI> yet, (for any thing that appears,) they had not in contemplation the peculiar circumstance of a <HI>contemptuous repetition</HI> of any crime, and may there∣fore be justly supposed not to have intend∣ed to abridge the salutary spirit of the <HI>common law,</HI> so necessary for its own pre∣servation, in duly punishing, by gradual advances of severity, any <HI>repeated contempts</HI> of its authority.</P>
<P>If all these points be duly considered, it must appear that our <HI>common law</HI> is al∣ready vested with <HI>ample powers</HI> to enforce a <HI>revival</HI> of the ancient constitution of this

<HEAD TYPE="sub">An ABSTRACT from the preceding Account of the <HI>Hundreds</HI> and <HI>Tithings,</HI> presented by the author to the com∣mittee of delegates from the several counties, &amp;c. and entituled <Q>A PROPOSAL For removing the enormous disproportion of popular representation enjoyed by the corrupt and venal boroughs: which Boroughs are now vested or monopoli∣zed, in the hands of a few individuals, as <HI>private property;</HI> a property avowedly estimated by the value of <HI>the seats in par∣liament,</HI> (instead of the only lawful pro∣perty therein, <HI>the real rentals of the tene∣ments,</HI>) and, at that unlawful and ex∣orbitant estimation, notoriously <HI>bought and sold,</HI> to the disgrace and perversion of parliamentary authority.</Q></HEAD>
<P><PB N="243" REF="243"/>
THE present great national evil, the notorious <HI>misrepresentation</HI> of the commons in parliament, cannot <HI>safely</HI> be remedied or altered for the purpose of amendment, by any other mode than that of reverting back to the first prin∣ciples of the constitution, and by revi∣ving the <HI>ancient rights</HI> of all denomina∣tions or classes of the people; at the same time carefully rejecting every <HI>inno∣vation</HI> that is not <HI>consistent in principle</HI> with the <HI>ancient usages</HI> of the realm, of which the <HI>certain effects</HI> are already known: whereas no human prudence can insure the <HI>real</HI> tendency and final effect of <HI>an innovation</HI> in matters of state, howsoever plausible it may at first appear.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="244"/>Though all true friends to the cause of liberty and the <HI>natural rights</HI> of man∣kind would wish that <HI>every man</HI> should vote for his representative in the national council, without any other description of <HI>right,</HI> or qualification, than that of <HI>being a man;</HI> yet, if this has not already been <HI>the usage</HI> of the realm, it is not, perhaps, <HI>adviseable,</HI> at least at present, to be adopted.—We know not what would be the effects of it; probably <HI>they would be good:</HI> but we ought to walk in a trodden path, and build on sure founda∣tions.</P>
<P>That <HI>every man,</HI> as such, if he was but an inhabitant of <HI>a county,</HI> did formerly vote in <HI>the court</HI> of that county (called the <HI>plein county,</HI> or <HI>full county</HI>) at elections for <HI>the knights</HI> of the shire, seems pro∣bable, by the description of <Q>very great <HI>outrageous</HI> and <HI>excessive number of peo∣ple dwelling within the same counties,
<PB N="245" REF="245"/>&amp;c. voting at such elections,</HI></Q> as men∣tioned in the act of 8 Hen. VI. cap. 14. which restrained the right of voting for knights to the freeholders of 40s. per ann. lands or tenements.</P>
<P>But a just definition of <HI>terms</HI> will best shew what description of persons have an unquestionable <HI>right to vote for repre∣sentatives</HI> according to the fundamental principles of the constitution.</P>
<P>The titles of <HI>freeholder</HI> and <HI>liber-tenens</HI> are <HI>ambiguous</HI> terms, not sufficiently de∣scriptive of the rank intended to be ex∣pressed; for they are applied at present only to <HI>land-owners;</HI> that is, to those who have, at least, a <HI>life-interest</HI> in <HI>lands</HI> or houses; which last, as being built on <HI>land,</HI> do equally intitle the proprietor to the rank of a <HI>land-owner:</HI> but these ambiguous terms, <HI>freeholders</HI> and <HI>liberi tenentes,</HI> have sometimes been applied also to the <HI>free-renters of tenements by the year</HI>
<PB N="246" REF="246"/>in contradistinction to the <HI>tenants at will</HI> and <HI>holders in villenage;</HI> for the old Saxon <HI>freo-borges,</HI> or <HI>free-burgesses,</HI> (that is, the <HI>free pledges</HI> of the realm,) were equally <HI>free</HI> in their condition with those persons we now call <HI>freeholders,</HI> though the <HI>tenure</HI> of many of them was <HI>not per∣manent;</HI> they being, (by far the greatest part of them) only the <HI>renters of tene∣ments by the year;</HI> though, indeed, the <HI>land-owners</HI> themselves (those that were <HI>housekeepers,</HI> or <HI>householders</HI>) must have been included under the same general description of <HI>freoborges.</HI></P>
<P>Sir Edward Coke defines the meaning of the word <HI>burgh</HI> to be <Q><HI>because</HI> it <HI>send∣eth burgesses to parliament;</HI></Q> and, though this is not the proper derivation of the word, it is certainly the <HI>ancient usage</HI> of all <HI>boroughs,</HI> as well as the <HI>right</HI> of all <HI>burgesses,</HI> or <HI>freoborges.</HI> For <HI>burghs</HI> were originally named from burgesses,

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A different etymology may also be assigned to many towns, the names of which end with <HI>berg</HI> or <HI>burg,</HI> which signifies a <HI>fortification,</HI> or castle, from the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, of which the learned Sheringham has given some in∣stances in his tract de Anglorum Gentis origine, p. 278.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the great annual courts of <HI>Frank∣pledge</HI> throughout the kingdom, <HI>every housekeeper</HI> was incorporated with nine other neighbouring <HI>housekeepers,</HI> (arch∣bishops,
<PB N="248" REF="248"/>bishops, peers, and other great men, excepted, who <HI>pledged</HI> their own <HI>households,</HI> and were supposed in law to have a <HI>tithing</HI> within their own families; but all other <HI>householders,</HI> or <HI>renters of houses, per annum,</HI> were incorporated) in distinct legal associations called <HI>tithings,</HI> or <HI>decenaries,</HI> from the incorporated num∣ber of <HI>housekeepers</HI> in each: and though all youths of 12 or 14 years of age, as also lodgers, journeymen, and male ser∣vants, were likewise obliged to attend the great annual court of <HI>frankpledge,</HI> and be there sworn to the king's peace, and be also regularly included in the <HI>de∣cenary</HI> and trained in the use of arms, to∣gether with the <HI>ten</HI> housekeepers in whose families they were respectively included and numbered, yet the <HI>ten housekeepers only</HI> were properly <HI>freo-borges,</HI> because they were the responsible persons, who <HI>pledged all the rest,</HI> and had a fixed habitation, and
<PB N="249" REF="249"/>certain interest in the state, paying scot and lot, being liable to all <HI>national,</HI> as well as <HI>county</HI> and <HI>parish,</HI> rates.</P>
<P>And these ten <HI>Freeborgs</HI> of each <HI>tithing</HI> were still farther distinguished by the title of <HI>deciners,</HI> (i. e. <HI>decenarii,</HI>) a term very properly expressive of their rank and quality as fixed and permanent members of a <HI>decenary,</HI> consisting of <HI>ten</HI> such asso∣ciated members, one of which was an∣nually elected <HI>chief of the ten,</HI> or <HI>tithing∣man.</HI></P>
<P>The term <HI>deciner</HI> has been very much mistaken and misrepresented by law wri∣ters; some applying it merely to the head∣borough, or <HI>capitalis-friborgus,</HI> the <HI>ti∣thingman,</HI> or head of each ten <HI>free-bur∣gesses;</HI> and others again to <HI>every man</HI> that was included in a <HI>tithing;</HI> which is a gross abuse of the term: for a <HI>tithing</HI> may consist of many more than <HI>ten,</HI> (even 20 or 30 males,) yet the <HI>ten housekeepers</HI>
<PB N="250" REF="250"/>who are principally responsible and there∣by actually constitute the <HI>decenary,</HI> both in number and title, those <HI>ten</HI> alone are properly the <HI>deciners</HI> of a <HI>tithing.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the word <HI>denizen</HI> has strangely puzzled the etymologists; who have sought its derivation, some from the French tongue, others again from the antient <HI>British,</HI> but both equally in vain: For, though it appears, that the <HI>Britons</HI> had the term <HI>denizen</HI> in use amongst them before the coming in of the Anglo-Saxons, yet, as all the <HI>Roman colonies,</HI> established among the Britons, were not only divided into <HI>centuriae</HI> or <HI>hundreds,</HI> but had also their <HI>decuriones,</HI> and consequently <HI>decena∣ries</HI> also, (for the captain of <HI>the ten</HI> could not be without <HI>the nine</HI> whom he headed,) both in their <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>military</HI> govern∣ment, it is clear, that the term <HI>denizen</HI> is of pure <HI>Latin</HI> original, from the nume∣ral adjective <HI>deni,</HI> forming the Latin verb
<PB N="251" REF="251"/><HI>denizo,</HI> to express the adoption of any per∣son into all the franchises and rights of a <HI>decenary.</HI> And our law-writers have re∣gularly used the participle <HI>denizatus,</HI> and the derivative substantive <HI>denizatio,</HI> to ex∣press the introduction of <HI>aliens</HI> to the fran∣chises of natural-born subjects, and yet they have not perceived the obvious mean∣ing of these words both in sense and sound.</P>
<P>For the alien is admitted by <HI>denization</HI> to all the rights of mutual protection en∣joyed by the community of natives in their established <HI>decenaries;</HI> and if he then becomes a housekeeper, and one of the <HI>ten</HI> housekeepers, who jointly constitute a tithing, or <HI>decinary,</HI> he is, of course, a <HI>deciner;</HI> and, with other <HI>deciners,</HI> is an incorporated member of the county which he inhabits; for, as the <HI>hundreds</HI> are the constituent parts of the <HI>county,</HI> and the <HI>tithings</HI> the constituent parts of each <HI>hundred,</HI> it necessarily follows, that the
<PB N="252" REF="252"/><HI>deciners</HI> are suitors of the <HI>county-courts;</HI> which right at present is very improperly attributed to the <HI>freeholders,</HI> or (more pro∣perly) to the <HI>land-owners</HI> alone; for the right of the deciners, or <HI>free burgesses,</HI> to the county-courts is demonstrated by the examples which have been given of gene∣ral elections for <HI>knights, citizens, and burgesses, all together promiscuously in the county-courts;</HI> which I have recommend∣ed in a former tract
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <Q>Equitable Representation necessary to the Establishment of Law, Peace, and good government,</Q> &amp;c. p. 22-29.</NOTE>, as <HI>one</HI> means of reducing the enormous disproportion of representation (at present enjoyed by some particular <HI>boroughs,</HI> to the effectual dis∣franchisement of all the rest!) whereby the kingdom has lost the means of expres∣sing the <HI>sense of the people</HI> in parliament; and the king has been <HI>deluded</HI> by majorities of alternate factions; factions, which, falsely calling themselves <HI>the commons of
<PB N="253" REF="253"/>England,</HI> have plunged the nation into desperate measures and enormous ex∣pences, and thereby loaded it with a bur∣den, which it cannot possibly bear and re∣trieve without a speedy reformation.</P>
<P>Though the representatives of cities are now called <HI>citizens,</HI> yet it appears that all cities and large towns have their right of voting as being ancient <HI>boroughs;</HI> that is, they had their right of voting from the inhabitants being <HI>freo-borges,</HI> or <HI>free-pledges</HI> of each other, in their respective <HI>decenaries,</HI> as <HI>deciners;</HI> and their right of becoming <HI>deciners</HI> arose from their be∣ing <HI>householders,</HI> <Q><HI>paying certain rent per annum;</HI></Q> or <Q><HI>paying each of them year∣ly an annual rent:</HI></Q> for that is the true definition of <HI>burgage-tenure,</HI> as described by Littleton; and therefore, not only <HI>householders</HI> whose houses are their own property, but also EVERY RENTER OF A HOUSE, OR TENEMENT, <HI>who is equally
<PB N="254" REF="254"/>liable to bear the burdens of the state, by being rated to all public and parochial taxes,</HI> OUGHT TO BE ADMITTED TO VOTE FOR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN PARLIA∣MENT; a right which they anciently enjoyed. <Q><HI>For of such</HI> OLD <HI>towns, call∣ed</HI> BOROUGHS, (says Littleton, p. 109. b.) <HI>come the</HI> BURGESSES <HI>of the parliament, when the king hath summoned his par∣liament.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>ancient city</HI> of Westminster, and many other cities
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>For the towns, that now be <HI>cities</HI> or counties, in old time were <HI>boroughes,</HI> and called <HI>boroughes,</HI> for of such old townes, called boroughs, come the burgesses of the parliament, &amp;c.</Q> Lit. p. 109. b.</NOTE>, as well as the <HI>an∣cient borough</HI> of Southwark, still retain the original usage and rights of <HI>burgage-tenure,</HI> the mere <HI>renters of houses,</HI> or <HI>house∣holders,</HI> throughout <HI>all the parishes</HI> respec∣tively included in each, being still entitled to vote by ancient prescription, which clearly proves the original nature of <HI>bur∣gage-tenure,</HI> though it is very much alter∣ed
<PB N="255" REF="255"/>in some other places, partly through the encroachments of <HI>purchasers of bo∣roughs,</HI> to reduce the number of voters; and partly by granting exclusive privi∣leges to a <HI>few people</HI> in the incorporated chartered boroughs.</P>
<P>The shortest and most easy mode of restoring, to <HI>all the householders of this realm, their ancient right of voting,</HI> is, first, to restore their ancient capacity of DECINERS, by advising them to <HI>throw themselves</HI> into tithings or <HI>decenaries;</HI> and to hold an∣nual courts of <HI>Frankpledge</HI> (now too long neglected) for the <HI>renewal</HI> and continual preservation of the <HI>tithing associations.</HI></P>
<P>By this means both the <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>mili∣tary</HI> government of the people will be completely restored, and peace and de∣fence will be completely secured, so that <HI>housebreaking</HI> and <HI>robbery</HI> will no longer be known amongst us, for such was <HI>once</HI> the happy state of the kingdom; and ef∣fected
<PB N="256" REF="256"/>by the <HI>very same</HI> regulations here recommended. A farther advantage, by restoring this ancient, legal, and con∣stitutional, mode of government, will be, that the exact proportions of the people in each county, who have a <HI>right to vote,</HI> will be truly ascertained; whereby may <HI>hereafter</HI> be introduced a representation of all the counties, <HI>perfectly equal,</HI> in pro∣portion to their respective numbers of <HI>householders:</HI> for if, in each county, divi∣sions were formed, consisting each of 200 <HI>decenaries</HI> or <HI>tithings,</HI> (including 2000 householders each,) that proportion will be found, on calculation, to contain the most convenient and proper number to be joined in the election of <HI>one deputy</HI> for parliament, in order to obtain an <HI>equal representation</HI> of <HI>all the families in the king∣dom;</HI> and no persons will be excluded but servants and others, who have <HI>no fixed habitation of their own;</HI> and, consequently,
<PB N="257" REF="257"/>at present, have no permanent interest in the state; or, at least, do not bear so large a proportion of relief to its burdens as the <HI>housekeepers</HI> do.</P>
<P><HI>Two thousand</HI> families might well af∣ford to pay ample wages to <HI>one</HI> represen∣tative; and the stipend might be very easily collected, if the <HI>decenaries</HI> were duly formed and established, and the several courts which regularly arise from the <HI>de∣cenaries,</HI> viz. the <HI>hundred courts;</HI> and those which might most conveniently be added to superintend and regulate the <HI>hundred courts,</HI> viz. the court of <HI>one thousand</HI> families, (answering to those of the Israelitish commonwealth, the <HI>thou∣sands</HI> of Ephraim, the <HI>thousands</HI> of Judah,) and lastly the junction of TWO <HI>such courts of the thousand, for the election of</HI> ONE <HI>re∣presentative.</HI> This last proposed court of 2000 <HI>householders</HI> would probably be
<PB N="258" REF="258"/>equal to what some of the old <HI>trithing courts</HI> formerly were; which are said to have sometimes included the third or fourth part of a county.</P>
<P>If every division of 2000 <HI>families</HI> were to elect <HI>one</HI> deputy to represent them in the great <HI>common council</HI> of the kingdom, the whole number of <HI>representatives,</HI> for South Britain, would amount (accord∣ing to the present state of population) to about 476
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This calculation is formed from the account of the number of houses charged, chargeable, and excused, in 1777, viz. 952, 734. See Dr. Price's Observations on the Population of England and Wales, p. 11.

<HEAD>TRACT, Number III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being a <HI>Memorandum</HI> on a late Proposal for a New Settlement to be made on the Coast of AFRICA; recommend∣ing, to the Author of that Proposal, several Alterations in his Plan, and more especially the adoption of the an∣cient Mode of Government by <HI>Tithings</HI> (or Decenaries) and <HI>Hundreds</HI> as being the most useful and effectual Mode of Government for all Nations and Coun∣tries.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="263" REF="261"/>
THE proposal for a settlement on the coast of Africa will deserve all en∣couragement, if the settlers are <HI>absolutely prohibited from holding any kind of proper∣ty in the persons of men, as slaves, and from selling either man, woman, or child.</HI> Even <HI>to claim</HI> any human person, as <HI>a slave,</HI> ought to be considered as an affront to the whole community, and be punished ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P>With respect to the proposal for leave to <HI>purchase slaves,</HI> the permission, if grant∣ed at all, must be very carefully guarded; and the price given must be considered and declared, at the time of purchase, to be a mere <HI>pecuniary debt for redemption,</HI> due from the person purchased to the society or state of the settlement; and by
<PB N="264" REF="262"/>no means to be tranferred to any single individual, (which would introduce do∣mestic tyranny and traffic in the bodies of men,) but the debt to be discharged at leisure, without increase or interest, whenever the redeemed, or his friends, shall tender the amount of the first price; in default of which, the price should be worked out by a limited proportional ser∣vice to the state; and the state should hold forth, at the same time, ample encou∣ragement to engage compliance and sub∣mission: but it should be an established principle, that the state or society ought rather to lose the value of the purchase than, <HI>by compulsion, to enforce involuntary servitude,</HI> whereby honest labour, that should always be deemed honourable, is rendered odious and slavish.</P>
<P>Rules must also be laid down to prevent <HI>the monopoly of land</HI> within the bounds of the settlement: and a sufficient reserve of
<PB N="265" REF="263"/><HI>land</HI> must be made for public services <HI>(schools and religious instruction)</HI> in each township; and for <HI>cottage land</HI> to be dis∣tributed in small parcels to new settlers and redeemed captives; which parcels <HI>must revert to the state or community, for the same benevolent investiture to others of the like condition,</HI> as soon as the temporary possessors are enabled to purchase larger lots; for it will prevent, in some degree, the monopoly of land, if the <HI>cottage-lots</HI> are untenable with other land. <HI>Common land</HI> should also be reserved for a com∣petent distance round each town and village, wherein <HI>all inhabitants,</HI> rich and poor, should have an <HI>equal personal right:</HI> because <HI>the claims of rich landholders,</HI> when made in proportion to the size of their bordering estates, is unreasonable and unjust; and has occasioned a cruel perversion of the utility of common lands in England: for the live stocks of rich
<PB N="266" REF="264"/>farmers, occasionally turned loose upon the commons, generally deprived the cattle of the poor inhabitants of their ne∣cessary sustenance; and the late divisions for enclosures, by act of parliament, ha∣ving been, for the most part, inconsiderate∣ly granted in the same unjust proportions, have at length nearly annihilated <HI>the com∣mon lands of England:</HI> whereas, on the contrary, the large possessions of the neighbouring landholders ought, in rea∣son and natural justice, rather to have ex∣cluded them from the least share in the inheritance of the poor inhabitants; or, at most; their share should have been <HI>merely personal,</HI> as men, and individuals, <HI>equal to,</HI> but not exceeding, the claims of their neighbours, that the <HI>common lands</HI> might be truly <HI>in common.</HI></P>
<P>The managers, entrusted with the so∣ciety's property to form the settlement, should have no settled dominion or au∣thority
<PB N="267" REF="265"/>over the people as governors or judges, but should be contented with that superiority and influence, which their pecuniary trust, as agents and overseers for the society, will naturally afford them; and their services may be amply rewarded and encouraged after the first year's sala∣ry, by an admission to a due proportion or share with the members of the society in the general profits of the settlement, and in the profits of the common or public trade of the society; but <HI>no private trade</HI> whatsoever should be permitted to any of the society's managers and agents.</P>

<P><PB N="268" REF="266"/>The purposes of the defence, legislation, public justice, government, and subordi∣nation, of the settlers, and their union as a community, (however large and exten∣sive the settlements may hereafter become,) are points more easily to be accomplished than is generally conceived; provided the antient Anglo-Saxon government by <HI>mu∣tual frankpledge</HI> in <HI>tithings</HI> (ordecenaries) and <HI>hundreds</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A short, yet very comprehensive and well-stated account of this ancient mode of government was publish∣ed in the year 1780, on the spur of an occasion which too clearly demonstrated the lamentable want of this excellent institution: I mean the dangerous riots in that year, which could not have proceeded to such an alarm∣ing excess, had not this institution been long disused, for otherwise <HI>"the civil power,"</HI> as the sensible author remarks, <Q>would have fully guarded us from its out∣rages,</Q> p. 45. "I ascribe" (says he, in letter II. p. 27.) <Q>the complete formation of those general out∣lines, by which we have ever defined the English constitution, to <HI>Alfred,</HI> on the authority of historians, who specify the particular regulations which rendered his government so happy as well as glorious; which have been, in some degree, preserved amidst violent and numerous revolutions; to which every English∣man has an unconquerable partiality; and the resto∣ration of which, to their proper vigour and effect, would secure our persons and property, and preserve that peace and order which are so essential to the hap∣piness of the community.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Keeping in view those general, those beautiful, outlines which were formed by the institutions of our early ancestors; over which the people sighed when broken and deformed by the Norman conquest, by the bloody contests of the houses of Lancaster and York, by the tyranny of the house of Tudor, and the folly of that of Stuart; and an attention to which, alone, rendered the revolution a blessing: we must define an English citizen to be a free-man; who is to owe his protection, and the security of his family and property, to a civil government, of which he is an essential member.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You will observe, Sir, that I confine myself to one object, or one part of our constitution, which pro∣vided for the safety of individuals, and the preser∣vation of order by the following regulations, still existing in names and forms; the revival of which would be the most beneficial and popular act of go∣vernment which can well be imagined.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The whole kingdom was, as it is now, divided into COUNTIES, HUNDREDS, and TITHINGS. <HI>Ten families</HI> were associated, their names entered, their occupations defined: the males in them from eighteen to fifty, or sixty, years of age, pledged themselves for the security of the <HI>tithing;</HI> and to obey the summons of the <HI>decennary,</HI> or <HI>tithingman,</HI> on the least apprehen∣sion of danger. They were furnished with such arms as the times afforded.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The perfect knowledge which every neighbour∣hood had of its inhabitants; the concern which every man had in the security of every man; and the obli∣gation which every decennary was under to be an∣swerable for his tithing; either prevented all viola∣tions of peace and order, or corrected them at their first origin.</Q></P>
<P><Q>All the decennaries or tithingmen were <HI>chosen by the people</HI> once a-year; and this is an <HI>essential</HI> circum∣stance in the institution.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The ten tithingmen of every district, called a hun∣dred because it contained a hundred families, chose a person to preside over the hundred, to whom they made their appeals, and who had a power of calling them out. All these were amenable to the earl or count who governed the county; and he was amenable to the king, who either by the <HI>earl or by the sheriff, both of which were of his own appointment</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The worthy author in this point is mistaken: the sheriff, as well as the earl and <HI>heretock,</HI> were, in ancient times, <HI>chosen by the people.</HI></NOTE>, could call out the whole force of a county, or of any number of counties, as the public exigencies required; while the internal peace and order of each district was pro∣vided for without his interference, and in a manner perfectly consistent with his general authority and in∣fluence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nothing has ever been imagined more simple in its construction, or more effectual in the execution, than this part of the English constitution. The several powers of it, which in most cases are in eternal dis∣cord, are here so happily blended, that the people are secure and free; the king's power extends to every thing but mischief, and is, in reality, greater than can be obtained on any other plan.</Q></P>
<P><Q>These regulations might be easily restored and ren∣dered as effectual as ever. The prepossessions of the people are strongly in their favour; and, perhaps, no others can be contrived which will not set the body of the people <HI>at enmity</HI> with government; which will perfectly allay their apprehensions and jealousies; will make them the ministers of their own security, while the power of the king <HI>reaches every individual of them, by a chain, every link of which is effectual,</HI> and <HI>will not interfere with the prerogative of the king in other departments of the state,</HI> however the business of them may be administered. * * * *</Q></P>
<P>"If you mean that it is impracticable," (says he, in letter III.) <Q>because the inhabitants of this country are too far advanced in luxury, too indolent, too effemi∣nate, to enter on any plan of security, which will re∣quire the least trouble, or put them to the least incon∣venience; and if you can ascertain this fact, I have no answer to make. But the trouble and inconve∣nience are such as would not be complained of by women. What is it but an amusement to learn the common use of arms? What inconvenience to sub∣mit to such regulations as may bring together a neigh∣bourhood, a parish, the ward of a city, a town, a district, &amp;c. to clear them of vagabonds, occasionally to assist the civil magistrate, and to lay the basis of a general security, confidence, and strength, where it ought to be laid, in the whole body of the people?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will venture to affirm, that there is no other me∣thod by which disturbances, riots, and insurrections, can be prevented, without debasing the people into the condition of brutes: and there is no other me∣thod by which a king may hold every man in the na∣tion in his hands; while every man in the nation would feel and know himself to be as free as it is pos∣sible he should be in society.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hints have been thrown out of acts of parliament which render such associations, as I recommend, ille∣gal; but the acts are not specified. I know there are laws forbidding a man's going armed, in a time of tranquillity and peace, without leave from a magis∣trate, and specifying such assemblies of people as are dangerous and seditious; but without the most dis∣tant reference to the right which every man has, from nature, from the connivance of the most despotic go∣vernments, and from the express provisions of the English constitution, to provide for his own defence and that of his family; and to unite with his neigh∣bourhood, under the eye and direction of the supreme magistrate, for the general peace and order of the community.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If there were such laws as you mention, they could not possibly have effect, against not only <HI>a necessary right or nature, but an essential principle of the English constitution.</HI> If a law were made, that, because it is <HI>possible</HI> an English elector may become venal, there∣fore all electors must relinquish the right of voting,— would this constitute an obligation? Will any man say, that the legislature is competent to the making of such a law?—how much less to annihilate the first and most important principles of human society, by awarding, that, as it is possible men may make an improper use of their limbs, or their arms, which may be as necessary as their limbs, they must therefore suffer them to be <HI>taken off.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The power of the legislature, like every power in human society, is limited by certain and accurate bounds; it may exceed these bounds, and commit absurdities, and even offences. The English legis∣lature is just as competent to make a law, by which every Englishman may be banished to the Orkneys, or put to death, as it is to enjoin the people to give up the right of self-defence and preservation, by the use of their limbs, or by the use of arms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The apprehension that associations will produce commotions and riots, instead of preventing them, must be pretended only. And all the arguments for depriving the people of the right of associating, be∣cause they have often assembled for mischievous pur∣poses, are delusive. Cardinal de Retz says, that all numerous assemblies are mobs; and I will add, that all mobs are mischievous. Let the people, who might form such assemblies, <HI>be divided into small bo∣dies; and, though the individuals be not improved, they will act reasonably and well.</HI> The design of associa∣tions is, to <HI>prevent large and tumultuous assemblies; to arrange the people under the eye of government,</HI> as accu∣rately as an army, <HI>without diminishing their constitutional independence and liberty;</HI> to increase the difficulty of misleading them, and to destroy all ideas of <HI>appeals to them.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Here I beg to be understood, not as aiming at any of the rights of the people: but the idea of an <HI>appeal to them</HI> has been borrowed from the government of <HI>Rome;</HI> in England it is, like the introduction of mi∣litary force, a thing that negligence or mismanage∣ment may render <HI>necessary;</HI> but the constitution is perfect without it; no supposition is made of the pos∣sibility of having any occasion to make it; and, when∣ever it is made, the remedy may be as hazardous as any evil it can be designed to remove. A whole nation, like the human body, in order to act with harmony and pleasure, <HI>must be divided into small parts, each having its local power, subject to the direction and controul of the general will,</HI></Q> p. 38 to 44.</P></NOTE> be duly adopted; and this
<PB N="269" REF="267"/>being already consistent with the common law and antient constitution of this king∣dom,
<PB N="270" REF="268"/>(still deemed <HI>legal</HI> though not in use,) might be lawfully established, even if the
<PB N="271" REF="269"/>settlement is made within the boundaries of the present English claims; but, in
<PB N="272" REF="270"/>that case, the legal process in all the courts of justice must be carried on in
<PB N="273" REF="271"/>the king's name; and the settlers may not refuse to admit a governor, or lieu∣tenant,
<PB N="274" REF="272"/>of the king's appointment, with a <HI>limited</HI> delegation of authority, accord∣ing to the constitution of England, when∣ever
<PB N="275" REF="273"/>the privy council shall think proper to send one.</P>
<P>But, if the settlement be attempted in any other part of Africa, not claimed by European powers, the managers must first obtain the consent (and association, if possible) of the native inhabitants, or else the establishment must be made on an uninhabited part of the coast: and, as the majority of the settlers will probably be negroes, returned from slavery and op∣pression to their <HI>native</HI> soil, there will be no necessity to form the plan of govern∣ment strictly by the constitutional model of England, any farther than reason and experience may suggest the adoption of some particular parts of it: but we may, in that case, assume the liberty of draw∣ing a precedent for government from more antient and more perfect documents than our Saxon records, viz. from the example, or rather the original intention, of <HI>the Is∣raelitish
<PB N="276" REF="274"/>commonwealth,</HI> purified and im∣proved by the general precepts and <HI>maxims of the gospel,</HI> and by the example of <HI>free congregational government amongst the pri∣mitive Christians,</HI> who decided their own temporal litigations and differences, (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>"things pertaining to this life,"</HI> 1 Cor. vi. 1—8.) as well as ecclesiastical questions, in their regular assemblies of <HI>all the people:</HI> which method was an ancient ethnic custom, (derived probably from patriarchal times,) as appears by the ex∣ample of the pagan Ephesians, recorded in Acts xix. 38, 39. whom their town-clerk referred to <HI>a lawful assembly</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, apparently distinct, as the context proves, from their <HI>ordinary courts of jus∣tice,</HI> then subject to the Romans) for the <HI>examination</HI> and <HI>resolution</HI> of all extraor∣dinary questions.</P>
<P>The Israelitish government, under the theocracy, was administered by <HI>freely-elect∣ed
<PB N="277" REF="275"/>judges and officers</HI> (see my tract on the Law of Nature, p. 325 to 329.) through∣out all the tribes and cities or gates; ex∣cept in the extraordinary cases of prophe∣tical judges; though these were probably <HI>elected</HI> likewise, as soon as their superior, or supernatural, abilities became gene∣rally known.</P>
<P>They had a regular gradation of official power, heads of <HI>tens,</HI> of <HI>fifties,</HI> of <HI>hun∣dreds,</HI> and of <HI>thousands;</HI> besides the pro∣vincial governors, who were ancient heads of houses or tribes: these altogether formed <HI>one great band of allegiance,</HI> uni∣ting the whole community together for <HI>action and defence,</HI> as <HI>one man,</HI> with <HI>one mind,</HI> viz. by the free resolutions of the majority; the smaller divisions being re∣gularly included and controuled in the lar∣ger, and the individuals of all the divi∣sions being mutually bound to each other by the reciprocal ties, or allegiance, of
<PB N="278" REF="276"/><HI>frankpledge,</HI> which our Saxon ancestors, and many other, even savage and heathen, nations
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Romans had their <HI>decuriones</HI> and <HI>centuriones,</HI> not only in their <HI>military,</HI> but also in their <HI>civil,</HI> govern∣ment; and, consequently, they must have had the popu∣lar divisions of <HI>tithings</HI> and <HI>hundreds</HI> much in the same manner as those established by K Alfred in England, in imitation of the Israelitish commonwealth; and even the <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Japonese</HI> (it is said) have <HI>tithings</HI> to this day.</NOTE>, have in some degree maintain∣ed, probably from the patriarchal times.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">An easy and practicable Plan for laying out Settlements on uncultivated Lands, in e∣qual Divisions of <HI>ten Tithings,</HI> or 100 Families each; whereby new Colonies may be most advantageously formed and extended in regular Districts of <HI>Hun∣dreds,</HI> agreeable to the ancient legal Di∣visions of our Anglo-Saxon Ancestors.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="285" REF="281"/>
SEVERAL years ago I made some me∣morandums of <Q><HI>A Method of form∣ing frontier Settlements,</HI></Q> which I co∣pied from the second edition of a book first printed at Philadelphia, but reprinted at London in 1766, and intituled <Q><HI>An Historical Account of the Expedition against the Ohio Indians, in the Year</HI> 1764, <HI>under the Command of Henry Bouquet, Esq. to which are annexed Military Papers, containing Reflections on the War with the Savages; a Method of forming frontier Settlements,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> My reference for the last-mentioned sub∣ject is to p. 51 of the said book; but, as I have not the book itself at present, I cannot pretend to be perfectly accurate in my quotations from it; neither do I re∣member
<PB N="286" REF="282"/>whether the author recommend∣ed a government by <HI>tithing</HI> and <HI>hundred</HI> courts, with their proper officers, accord∣ing to the Anglo-Saxon model; but only that his proposed settlements were (happily for my present purpose) laid out in equal divisions of <HI>one hundred</HI> lots each, for the maintenance of <HI>one hundred</HI> families; so that, of course, the constitutional regu∣lations for <HI>hundreds,</HI> recommended in the preceding tracts, will not be less suitable and beneficial to <HI>his</HI> scheme than <HI>his</HI> certainly is to mine.</P>
<P>"Let us suppose a settlement" (says he) <Q>to be formed for <HI>one hundred fa∣milies,</HI> composed of five persons each upon an average.</Q></P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>Lay out upon a river or creek, a squ. of 1760 yards; or a mile for each side.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That square will contain 640 acres.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Allowance for streets and public uses 40 640 acres.</ITEM>
<ITEM>To half an acre for every house 50 640 acres.</ITEM>
<ITEM>To 100 lots at 5½ acres 550 640 acres.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P><Q>The four sides of the square mea∣sures 7040 yards, which gives to each
<PB N="287" REF="283"/>house about 70 yards in front, to stoc∣kade, and the ground, allowed for building, will be 210 feet front and about 100 feet deep.</Q></P>
<P><Q>An acre of ground will produce at least 30 bushels of Indian corn; there∣fore, two acres are sufficient to supply five persons at the rate of 12 bushels each person; two other acres will be for cows and sheep, another for hay, or to be sown with red clover; the re∣maining half acre may be laid out for a garden.</Q> Thus far the author's plan may be applicable to lands even in England, especially if laid out in less divisions of <HI>tithings,</HI> instead of <HI>hundreds,</HI> preserving the same due proportion of land in lots for each family. The <HI>ten</HI> fa∣milies with their habitations would form a compact little village, under the govern∣ment of a <HI>tithing-man,</HI> annually elected from among themselves, whereby all
<PB N="288" REF="284"/>would be rendered mutually responsible for each other, for the common peace; and to make good every damage that might be occasioned by the ill behaviour of any individual among them. An estate laid out in small farms, with such a <HI>tithing</HI> village in the centre of it, for a constant supply of labourers, might be made to maintain a much greater number of peo∣ple than land generally does in the ordi∣nary way of farming; and would, conse∣quently, be much more beneficial both to the landlords and to the nation at large. Commons and waste forests or chases might thus be laid out and occupied by the labouring poor, to the great reduction of parish rates as well as of the price of labour; for, free and useful labourers would never be wanting, if such a regular provision, under their own management could be found for their families. But the possession of such parish-lots should
<PB N="289" REF="285"/>be limited to those persons, who occupy no other land; and should be delivered up to the parish or community, for the use of other unprovided families, as soon as any possessor obtains more land, either as a farm, or in fee, (as recommended in a former Tract,) to prevent <HI>the monopoly of land,</HI> and the entire deprivation of the poor from any share in it, as at present.</P>
<P>The remainder of the author's scheme is suitable only to unoccupied countries, like many parts of Africa and America, where the people are few, and the lands of small value, viz. "Round the town" (says he) <Q>are the commons of three miles square, containing, exclusive of the lots above-mentioned, 5120 acres. On three sides of the town, five other squares will be laid out, of three square miles, containing 5760 acres each; one of which is reserved for wood, for the use of the settlement; the other four
<PB N="290" REF="286"/>to be divided into 25 out-lots, or plan∣tations, of about 230 acres each; so that in the four squares there will be 100 such plantations, for the 100 fa∣milies. Another township may be laid out joining this, upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame plan, and as many more as you please, upon the same line, without losing any ground.</Q></P>
<P>The following is a rough Sketch of the whole.</P>
<P><PB REF="287"/><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="288"/>The banks of the river (as in ancient times) should be deemed <HI>common</HI> or <HI>public</HI> as the river itself, under the conservation of the <HI>community;</HI> and should be reserved for future improvements, (as for the ac∣commodation, not only of fishermen, but also of manufacturers, traders, and of all industrious strangers,) and docks, or navi∣gable cuts (whenever the level of the country will permit) should be made from the river, as far back, at least, as the centre between every two townships.</P>
<P>The spaces between the squares are left for roads and common communications between the several lots; and the roads which divide two distinct townships should be still more spacious for the common use of all the inhabitants, the cartage of their produce and other traffic, the dri∣ving of cattle, &amp;c. and a spacious road, to be formed lengthways throughout the whole settlement, ought, in forming the
<PB N="293" REF="289"/>lots, to be reserved through the centre of each township: the central lots, which will thereby be diminished in <HI>size,</HI> will find ample compensation, in <HI>value,</HI> by their situation on the great central road, which I have expressed by a dotted line. I do not remember whether any roads, or spaces for them, were expressed in the original plan of the author.</P>
<P>I would likewise deviate from the ori∣ginal plan of the author, with respect to the situation of the 5760 acres of wood∣land for each township; which, I con∣ceive, had better be reserved in one of the most distant squares, at an angular situation from each town, instead of being in the opposite square, according to his proposal: for the towns will not only be more healthy, by having the uncleared lands more distant from them, but also the inhabitants, when on watch and ward duty, will be better enabled to discover
<PB N="294" REF="290"/>the approach of any lurking savages, or other enemies in time of war.</P>

<PB N="321" REF="316"/>rights of</HI> CLERGY <HI>and</HI> PEOPLE is so safe and perfectly unexceptionable, that it must have obviated the plausible objection that was usually alleged, by popes and monks, against POPULAR elections; i.e. the danger of exciting <HI>party animosities</HI> and <HI>tumults.</HI> The monks, however, were not able entirely to set aside these excellent constitutions of Charles and Lewis, for several years afterwards; and the influence of them seems to have ex∣tended even to <HI>Rome</HI> itself: for the bishops at a <HI>lateran council,</HI> not less than 45 years afterwards, (viz.

<PB N="322" REF="317"/>bishops throughout</HI> (the province of) <HI>Aemilia, except after</HI> THE ELECTION OF THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE; a testi∣mony highly to the point in question, and the more especially, if we consider that it proceeded from a quarter, the seat of usurpation, that had long been inimi∣cal to all <HI>popular</HI> rights!

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many <HI>ancient</HI> writers of good repute represent pope <HI>John</HI> VIII. to have been a <HI>woman;</HI> and some of them add, that he was even an <HI>English woman!</HI> It is <HI>therefore</HI> to avoid the throwing any farther un∣necessary blame on our reputed <HI>countrywoman,</HI> that I say, <Q><HI>rather</HI> John IX.</Q> than John VIII. because the times I speak of were about the quarter part of a century later than the period usually assigned for the <HI>infallible</HI> dominion of our extraordinary <HI>English</HI> pope. Of late, indeed, it has been a sort of <HI>fashion</HI> amongst <HI>protestant</HI> writers, as well as <HI>papists,</HI> to deem the story of <HI>pope Joan</HI> a mere <HI>fable:</HI> thus much, however, is certain, that, if it be a <HI>fable,</HI> it was not invented by the <HI>protestants.</HI> Accounts of it were written by undoubted catholics, some <HI>centuries</HI> be∣fore the reformation, and these accounts were <HI>even printed</HI> several years before either Luther or Calvin were preachers. <HI>Martin</HI> (the author quoted for it by <HI>Platina</HI>) was a dominican frier, <HI>apostolic</HI>-chaplain un∣der pope Nicolas III. A.D. 1277; and was afterwards a <HI>popish arch∣bishop</HI> in Poland; so that, from his situation and rank in life, it was neither probable that he should want the best information on that sub∣ject, which the times he lived in could afford, nor that he should adopt such a story, had it not been <HI>current</HI> and <HI>generally admitted</HI> at that time. <HI>Platina,</HI> who quotes him, was employed by pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> IV. to write the <HI>History of the Popes;</HI> and would not surely have quoted this story from <HI>Martin</HI> if he had thought that it might <HI>with propriety</HI> have been absolutely rejected; but, on the contrary, he is so far from making <HI>Martin</HI> alone answerable for the story, that he declares it to be the <HI>common report;</HI> "<HI>Haec quae dixi</HI> VULGO FERUNTUR," <HI>commonly report∣ed,</HI> it seems, by <HI>several authors;</HI> whom he is pleased, however, to deem <HI>uncertain</HI> and <HI>obscure, ("incertis tamen et obscuris auctoribus,")</HI> though he had no right to include <HI>Martin</HI> in this vague censure. In the very next sentence, however, he entirely exculpates him (as well as his <HI>obscure authors</HI>) from the invention of the story, by adding, that it was <HI>"what almost all affirm," "quod fere omnes affirmant,"</HI> see p. 57. a.

Rollwink</HI> has also added, that this <HI>John</HI> <Q><HI>was the sixth pope who had the name of sanctity, without the thing itself; and, like others, was also smitten of God, and not placed in the catalogue of pontiffs.</HI></Q> <Q>Et hic <HI>sextus</HI> vide∣tur fuisse PAPA, qui nomen sanctitatis sine re habuit usque huc, et similiter sicut alii a Deo plagatus fuit, nec ponitur in catalogo Pon∣tificum.</Q> See p. 66. b. This was <HI>printed</HI> in the year 1488. In the chronicle of <HI>Sigebert,</HI> the story is related as a <HI>current report,</HI> i. e. <HI>fama,</HI>—<HI>"Fama est hunc Joannem foeminam fuisse,"</HI> &amp;c. This author was a <HI>Benedictine monk,</HI> about the year 1100, and his work was printed by <HI>H. Stephens,</HI> the <HI>French king's printer,</HI> at Paris, in 1513; so that there is no reason to suspect either the author or the printer of <HI>partia∣lity</HI> against <HI>popery.</HI> Of all these different authors, except the <HI>first, (Martin,)</HI> I have the printed copies before me of the several dates abovementioned. Many other authors I find quoted for the story, who were also professed <HI>Roman Catholics;</HI> as <HI>Marianus Scotus,</HI> a <HI>monk</HI> at Mentz, who wrote a <HI>chronicle</HI> about the year 1069, the chronicle also of <HI>Pe∣trarque,</HI> printed at <HI>Florence</HI> in 1478.

<P>About seven or eight years before this time, viz. A. D. 869 or 870, the 36th
<PB N="328" REF="323"/>council of Constantinople (intituled, by the popish or Latin party, the eighth gene∣ral council) wickedly declared against the <HI>unalienable popular right</HI> of electing Bi∣shops, and formed a canon expressly against it.

<PB N="329" REF="324"/>behalf of this just <HI>right,</HI> that he announ∣ced it to the senate and people, viz. that, <Q><HI>in creating a pope, the authority of the emperor should not be waited for; and that the suffrages of</HI> THE CLERGY <HI>and</HI> PEOPLE <HI>should be free.</HI></Q>

<P>It is manifest, therefore, that Platina was inclined to attribute the merit of pro∣moting free <HI>popular elections,</HI> at Rome, rather to the <HI>Pope</HI> than to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> to whom it was more strictly due, even according to his own evidence: for <HI>Popes</HI> and <HI>Monks</HI> could not endure a concurrent right of the <HI>people</HI> in episcopal elections, except when it might seem to <HI>aggrandize</HI> the holy see as a <HI>peculiar privilege;</HI> or un∣less it were admitted in any particular place by <HI>papal</HI> favour and <HI>indulgence,</HI> as at <HI>Papia,</HI> for the like purpose of <HI>aggrandize∣ment!</HI> But in all other cases they were the regular professed enemies to <HI>popular
<PB N="331" REF="326"/>right;</HI> so that to <HI>their</HI> influence, and not to the influence of imperial or royal pow∣er, is the wicked <HI>decree against free elections</HI> to be attributed. And this was carried, it seems, on the stale pretence of proba∣ble <HI>tumults,</HI> and <Q><HI>the confusion that a mul∣titude of electors might occasion,</HI></Q> just as the present <HI>tumults</HI> in Westminster afford, to the enemies of the English con∣stitution, an exulting argument against the ancient <HI>right</HI> of <HI>frequent elections;</HI> who, instead of being willing to correct the <HI>abuse</HI> of an institution, would rather de∣stroy the profitable <HI>use</HI> of it: but such perverse reasoners are either <HI>deplorably ignorant,</HI> or else <HI>shamefully wicked:</HI> for the same argument holds equally good for <HI>robbing</HI> the people of their <HI>pecuniary</HI> pro∣perty; because many of them make a very improper use of what little money they have to spare; and indeed the rob∣bery would be much <HI>less dishonest</HI> and <HI>sin∣ful</HI>
<PB N="332" REF="327"/>in the latter case than in the former; for, though both are <HI>rights</HI> of the people, and cannot therefore be infringed with∣out <HI>iniquity</HI> and <HI>injustice,</HI> which are hate∣ful in the sight of God, yet the <HI>right</HI> of <HI>election</HI> (whether it be to <HI>civil</HI> or <HI>ecclesias∣tical</HI> offices) is <HI>inestimable,</HI> and above price; so that no plea of <HI>expedience,</HI> or even of <HI>"necessity,"</HI> can justify the <HI>gross dishonesty</HI> of infringing it. They might as well persuade us to cut off our legs, lest we should strain our ancles in walking! or absolutely to prohibit <HI>all</HI> men from riding on horseback, because <HI>some</HI> men have had dangerous falls, and others have acci∣dentally lost their lives by it! yet such arguments are not more <HI>grossly absurd</HI> than this pretence of <HI>tumults</HI> as a reason for robbing the people of their <HI>election rights;</HI> and yet <HI>this absurdity</HI> prevailed in the 36th council of Constantinople, though the popular <HI>right</HI> was expressly allowed! <Q><HI>On a longtemps conservé

<PB N="336" REF="331"/>that the DROIT <HI>of the electors</HI> could not be <HI>transferred</HI> by those who had <HI>no right</HI> in it; and, consequently, that the kings of France do not exercise a DROIT, but a TORT, as long as their unjust usurpation of the DROIT conti∣nues; and I wish I could speak more fa∣vourably of the <HI>usurpation of our elective rights</HI> in England!</P>
<P>The rights of <HI>episcopal</HI> elections, as well as the nature of the <HI>episcopal office</HI> itself, have, indeed, been subjects of much controversy in the Christian church; and the several dissentients, that have hither∣to published their opinions, might long ago have approached much nearer to an agreement in the happy medium of truth, had they been endued with sufficient <HI>im∣partiality;</HI> but this, alas! has been too much wanting on every side of the con∣troversy.

<P>Thus it appears that the conquest of <HI>Ireland</HI> by King Edgar did not affect the just liberties of the <HI>church of Ireland;</HI> for the <HI>Norman</HI> colonies therein still enjoyed the uninfluenced <HI>election</HI> of their own Bishops: and though they acknowledged the jurisdiction of the pro∣vince of Canterbury in <HI>ecclesiastical matters,</HI> even when they were become <HI>independent,</HI> and separated from us, under a King of their own, yet that submission was per∣fectly <HI>voluntary</HI> and <HI>free,</HI> and was continued for no other reason than because they had originally received <HI>episco∣pal ordination</HI> from the Archbishops of that see. Never∣theless they declared themselves at liberty to receive consecration from the Archbishop of Armagh, and other Irish Bishops, (who earnestly desired to confer it on them.) in case the prelates of Canterbury should be negligent in their superintendency. And the Bishops also of the <HI>native Irish</HI> and their flocks were equally free and inde∣pendent in <HI>ecclesiastical matters,</HI> having preserved a due succession of the sacred order of episcopacy from the early times of their <HI>first</HI> conversion (<HI>before</HI> the time of the <HI>first Patrick</HI>) down to the barbarous times of our K. Henry II. who invaded their island, under the delusive sanction of a <HI>papal commission,</HI> to compel the submission of the <HI>church of Ireland</HI> to the jurisdiction and doctrines of the <HI>church of Rome,</HI> and to pay an annual tribute to the pope of one penny for every house; and all this on the delusive pretence of <HI>instructing</HI> the Irish, <HI>reforming their manners,</HI> &amp;c. Henry obtained his first commission for these pur∣poses from pope Adrian IV. A. D. 1155, which Arch∣bishop Usher has inserted in his said collection of an∣cient epistles, p. 109. And he informs us, in p. 152. (from <HI>Trivettus,</HI>) that Henry treated with his parliament at Winchester concerning the <HI>conquest of Ireland,</HI> but, be∣cause it did not please his mother the empress, that ex∣pedition was postponed to another time. The empress, probably, was shocked with the <HI>injustice</HI> of the proposal, notwithstanding the <HI>popish dispensation</HI> for it.</P>
<P>Afterwards, however, in the year 1172, Pope Alex∣ander III. revived the former wicked and presumptuous grant of Adrian, for invading and usurping the <HI>temporal rights</HI> as well as spiritual jurisdiction of the <HI>clergy and people of Ireland,</HI> (whereby "<HI>the dominion of the Irish kingdom was</HI> INDULGED <HI>to</HI>" Henry,) and, in the pleni∣tude of his <HI>unlimited</HI> and <HI>unlawful</HI> power, this <Q><HI>man of sin,</HI></Q> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, presumptuously ratified and confirmed

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The learned author of <Q><HI>An Enquiry into the Consti∣tution, Discipline, Unity, and Worship, of the Primitive Church,</HI></Q> &amp;c. (a work commonly attributed to the late lord-chancellor <HI>King,</HI>) has laboured hard to level the <HI>primitive Bishops</HI> to the degree of mere <HI>Rectors of pa∣rishes,</HI> and to elevate the <HI>Presbyters</HI> to the rank of <HI>Bishops,</HI> though there are clear proofs of the superiority of <HI>Bishops</HI> (and of the ordinary residence, in each place, but of <HI>one</HI> Bishop, with <HI>several</HI> Presbyters and Deacons at the same time) included even in some of the citations which he has collected to favour a contrary doctrine. His opi∣nion seems to have been built principally on a peculiar explanation of the word <HI>ordination.</HI> "That <HI>ordination,</HI>" (says he,) <Q>that I shall speak of, is this, the grant of a peculiar commission and power, which remains inde∣lible in the person to whom it is committed, and can never be obliterated or rased out, except the person himself cause it by his heresie, apostacy, or most ex∣tremely gross and scandalous impiety.</Q> (Thus far there is no need to oppose his sense of <HI>ordination;</HI> but he adds,) "Now this sort of <HI>ordination</HI>" (says he) <Q>was conferred <HI>only upon Deacons and Presbyters,</HI> or <HI>on Dea∣cons and Bishops, Presbyters and Bishops being here to be considered as all one,</HI> as Ministers of the church univer∣sal,</Q> p. 115. This appears to be the key-stone, whereby the whole fabric of the doctrine throughout his work is suspended and held up, and consequently, the whole building must fall by the removal of it! Very happily, for the determination of the dispute, he has pro∣duced (within a few pages after the place from whence this quotation was taken) some clear and unquestionable examples of the <HI>ordination</HI> of some persons to the degree of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> who really <HI>were not Bishops,</HI> and never had <HI>episcopal</HI> dignity in the ordinary ecclesiastical sense of the word <HI>episcopal,</HI> so that they could not, consistently with truth, <HI>"be considered as all one"</HI> with <HI>Bishops,</HI> according to this learned writer's hypothesis.</P>
<P>He cites (in p. 133.) the express testimony of Eusebius for the <HI>ordination</HI> of ORIGEN to be a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> <Q>that the Bishops of Caesarea and Jerusalem <HI>ordained</HI></Q> (or laid hands upon) <HI>"him into the presbytery,"</HI> i. e. to make <HI>him a Presbyter,</HI> <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</Q> Euseb. lib. 6. c. 8. p. 209. Here then is a clear proof of the ordination of a person to be a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> by the hands of <HI>Bishops,</HI> and yet no man, that has any regard to the testimony and truth of ecclesiastical history, will presume to say that <HI>Origen</HI> was a <HI>Bishop,</HI> though he was unquestionably or∣dained to be a <HI>Presbyter;</HI> and, consequently, it cannot be true, that the ordination of "<HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI>" is <HI>"to be considered as all one."</HI></P>
<P>By another quotation, in p. 135, from Eusebius, this learned writer proves also that <Q><HI>Novatian was ordained a</HI> PRESBYTER <HI>by imposition of hands,</HI></Q> i.e. the hands of a BISHOP, as Eusebius declares: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Cornel. apud Euseb. lib. 6. cap. 43. p. 245.</P>
<P>And that this is a clear example of <HI>the ordination of a mere Presbyter,</HI> manifestly distinct from <HI>ordination to the episcopal dignity,</HI> is demonstrated by the same chapter of Eusebius, which relates the wicked fraud of <HI>this same Presbyter,</HI> Novatian, at a time when he was already a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> to obtain a <HI>farther ordination</HI> for the <HI>episcopal</HI> dignity, by inveigling three simple country Bishops to <HI>ordain him a Bishop</HI> by the imposition of their hands. And therefore, though <HI>all Bishops</HI> are certainly <HI>Presby∣ters,</HI> yet these examples, cited by the learned writer, clearly demonstrate that <HI>all Presbyters are</HI> NOT <HI>Bishops,</HI> and, consequently, that their <HI>ordination</HI> is NOT <Q><HI>to be considered as all one.</HI></Q> The rite of ordination (i. e. <HI>the laying on of hands by the Bishops, after solemn prayer of the whole congregation for the assistance of the Holy Spirit</HI>) is, indeed, <HI>"all one,"</HI> as well in the ordaining of <HI>Dea∣cons,</HI> as in the ordination of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and in the con∣secration of Bishops, differing only in the <HI>designation</HI> to these respective offices of the Christian Ministry, as I have already remarked in p. 316 n; but then this single circumstance of <HI>designation</HI> is sufficiently effectual to occasion an <HI>essential</HI> difference in the three degrees of holy <HI>orders;</HI> for what are <HI>orders</HI> but <HI>designations,</HI> or de∣clarations of the office conferred, or function to be dis∣charged? insomuch that a person who hath been duly ordained by the <HI>same solemn rite,</HI> with a <HI>designation</HI> to the office of a <HI>Deacon,</HI> may not assume the office of a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> without a <HI>repetition of that rite,</HI> and an express <HI>order,</HI> or <HI>designation,</HI> to the office and duty of a <HI>Presbyter;</HI> and a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> who has <HI>twice</HI> received holy <HI>orders</HI> by the same solemn rite, cannot lawfully assume the dignity and office of a Bishop, until he hath been <HI>first</HI> duly <HI>elected to be a Bishop;</HI> and, <HI>secondly,</HI> (which is the <HI>most essential</HI> circumstance, by which <HI>episcopal</HI> authority is really con∣ferred,) until he have been once more <HI>ordered,</HI> or <HI>ordain∣ed,</HI> (notwithstanding his two former <HI>orders,</HI> as a Deacon, and as a <HI>Presbyter,</HI>) and that with a repetition of the <HI>same solemn rite,</HI> (the laying on of hands with previous pray∣er,) but differing in this, that there is always an express <HI>order,</HI> or <HI>designation,</HI> to the <HI>episcopal</HI> function, previous to the prayers and laying on of hands. The example of <HI>Novatian,</HI> cited above, shews that the <HI>re-ordination</HI> of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in order to obtain the degree and function of a <HI>Bishop,</HI> was <HI>deemed necessary,</HI> even early in the third century. Other examples, which I have quoted in pages 340-342 n. concerning the <HI>re-ordination</HI> of <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> that had been <HI>elected</HI> to be <HI>Bishops,</HI> prove that the same opinion as well as <HI>practice</HI> was preserved in the middle centuries of Christianity; and the <HI>present</HI> uni∣versal practice of the episcopal church, in giving <HI>priests orders</HI> always previous to <HI>episcopal</HI> consecration, is too well known and established, to need the citation of par∣ticular examples for illustration.</P>
<P>The learned Chancellor (if he was the writer of the said book) hath also <HI>supposed,</HI> that the petition of a <HI>candidate for holy orders</HI> <Q>was to the whole Presbytery, because</Q> (says he, p. 115.) <Q>a Bishop alone could not give those holy orders, as is most evident</Q> (says he) <Q>from <HI>Cyprian,</HI> who assures us, that <HI>all clerical ordinations were performed by the common counsel of the whole Presbytery;</HI> and, therefore,</Q> (says he,) <Q>when, upon a <HI>most urgent and necessary occasion,</HI> he had been forced to ordain one but a <HI>Lector,</HI> without the advice and consent of his <HI>Presbytery,</HI> which, one would be apt to think, was no great usurpation, he takes great pains to justify and excuse himself for so doing.</Q> But all this supposition falls, at once, to the ground, as soon as the authority, which he has cited for it, (Cy∣prian's 24th Epist.) is more carefully examined; for it really contains no such doctrine, and doth <HI>not at all</HI> re∣late to <HI>"clerical ordinations,"</HI> which he has too hastily supposed; Cyprian had <HI>not</HI> given <HI>"holy orders"</HI> (the subject of the learned writer's argument) to the persons for whose appointment he thought it necessary to apolo∣gize in that epistle; for they were still <HI>"sub clero,"</HI> as he expressly declares, <HI>under the degree of clergy;</HI> so that the apology could not be for having <HI>ordained</HI> any one in the <HI>ecclesiastical</HI> sense of that word; but only for <Q><HI>having</HI> MADE (or appointed) one man a <HI>Lector,</HI> or <HI>Reader,</HI> in the church, and for <HI>having</HI> MADE another man a <HI>Subdeacon.</HI></Q> <Q>FECISSE <HI>me autem sciatis</HI> LECTOREM <HI>Saturum,</HI> et HYPODIACONUM <HI>Optatum confessorem.</HI></Q> These were mere local functions in the church, at the disposal, not only of the <HI>Presbyters</HI> and Deacons, but also of the <HI>laity,</HI> or whole congregation, who have a <HI>right</HI> to elect to such offices, in many places, even to this day; so that an apology was really necessary in this case, for having acted <HI>without their consent;</HI> but no apo∣logy would have been due, had the case been a <HI>mere or∣dination,</HI> or <HI>conferring of holy orders.</HI> The example is entirely foreign to the question of <HI>presbyters</HI> having a right to <HI>confer holy orders;</HI> and, as a proof that it is so, be pleased to remark, that the apology is addressed <HI>jointly to the Presbyters and Deacons;</HI> and cannot, there∣fore, prove the right of the <HI>former</HI> to confer <HI>holy orders,</HI> without admitting, also, the <HI>latter</HI> to the same degree of authority, an idea which the learned writer never intended to promote.</P>
<P><HI>Cyprian</HI> has been as much misunderstood by some former advocates for the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> pretensions to the <HI>right of ordaining;</HI> who <Q>to prove that <HI>ordination by Bishops, without the assistance of</HI> PRESBYTERS, <HI>was always forbidden and opposed,</HI> tell us</Q> (says Dr. Ham∣mond) <Q>of <HI>Aurelius</HI>'s being ordained by <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and his <HI>collegues,</HI> ep. 33. and then assure us, from ep. 58. that, by his <HI>collegues,</HI> he means his <HI>Presbyters,</HI> (where yet there is no other proof of it, but the using of these <HI>words</HI> in the <HI>inscription</HI> of the <HI>epistie,</HI> Cypri∣anus <HI>cum collegis,</HI> et <HI>ego et collegae,</HI> Cyprian <HI>with his collegues,</HI> and <HI>I and my collegues.)</HI> This</Q> (says Dr. Hammond) <Q>is a great, but discernible, <HI>fallacy,</HI> put upon the <HI>reader,</HI> as will soon appear, 1. if we but observe that the 33d epistle, where he tells of Aure∣lius, was written by <HI>Cyprian</HI> to his <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and so THEY ARE the persons whom he advertiseth, what <HI>he and his collegues</HI> had done, and so, sure, WERE NOT those <HI>collegues</HI> that did it <HI>with</HI> him. Or, se∣condly, if, for the understanding <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s notion of <HI>collegues,</HI> ep. 58. we shall but look forward to the next epistle, 59, for that will fully discover it, being this, <HI>Cyprianus et caeteri collegae qui in concilio affuerunt numero</HI> LXVI. where <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s <HI>colleagues</HI> are evidently the 66 Bishops that were in <HI>council</HI> with him. And so St. <HI>Austin,</HI> in his 28th epistle to St. <HI>Hierome,</HI> men∣tioning this very <HI>epistle,</HI> saith, <HI>Cyprianus cum Coepis∣copis suis, Cyprian with his fellow Bishops;</HI> an irre∣fragable evidence that these his <HI>collegues</HI> were <HI>Bishops.</HI> The like</Q> (says he) <Q>might be also observed of the <HI>testimony</HI> out of <HI>Firmilian,</HI> which they there subjoin, of the <HI>Seniores</HI> and <HI>Praepositi</HI> that have <HI>power</HI> of <HI>ordain∣ing,</HI> by whom, say they, the <HI>presbyters, as well as the Bishops, are understood;</HI> but, again, it is clear, by the express words of the <HI>epistle,</HI> that by them are meant <HI>the Bishops</HI> in their <HI>annual council; necessario apud nos fit ut, per</HI> SINGULOS ANNOS, SENIORES <HI>et</HI> PRAEPOSITI <HI>in unum conveniamus,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I should not have made so long a quotation from Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> had not the learned <HI>Chancellor</HI> (or author of the tract just before cited) once more held forth these very testimonies to justify <HI>ordination by Presbyters,</HI> though they had long before been so amply confuted by Dr. Hammond.</P>
<P>"It is a sad mistake" (says the rev. Mr. Tho Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mon, in his <HI>Historical Collections relating to the Originals,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>of the Inhabitants of Great Britain,</HI> p. 445-449.) <Q>of those who have a prejudice against episcopacy, that it is an invention of the <HI>Popish</HI> times, and that our <HI>Re∣formers</HI> so modelled the constitutions of our church, as they might be most agreeable to the humour of the <HI>Romanists.</HI> But, certainly, the history of Britain may convince any man of the contrary. The <HI>Popish</HI> times did not begin at the council of <HI>Arles,</HI> yet there we had our Bishops: The fathers of the council of <HI>Nice</HI> had spent their days under the severest persecutions of the heathen, and were just entered upon the morn∣ing of the christian empire, and shall we think that popery was then prevalent? Our church is now set∣tled as it was at that time: Not only Bishops all over <HI>Britain,</HI> so far as it was christian, but very near the same number of Bishops. The three chief bishop∣rics were settled at three most distant and proper places to have jurisdiction over the rest, <HI>London, York,</HI> and <HI>Caerleon:</HI> There were in all 28 cities, and accord∣ingly 28 bishoprics, as the number is given us both by <HI>Gildas</HI> and <HI>Bede;</HI> and, if we have now two less, yet so much of Britain as lies between <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> now belonging to <HI>Scotland,</HI> may well be allowed for the making of two. At the council of <HI>Nice,</HI> the jurisdiction of their metropolitans was settled, and the union of all the Bishops of the Pro∣vince provided for: Such was the order and harmony of the whole clergy, that, though the diocese was so large that it could not be particularly known and taught by the superior officers of the church, yet every one acting in his place, and being accountable to those above him, there was no defect either in the doctrine or discipline of those primitive times.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Certainly there is demonstration for episcopacy, in that there <HI>were not only Bishops before popery,</HI> but when the popish missionaries set up in the world, <HI>the old Bishops were the very men that made the opposi∣tion against them.</HI> Nothing can be more undoubted in history, than that the <HI>British</HI> Bishops met <HI>Austin</HI> and his companions at the famous oak upon the banks of <HI>Severn,</HI> and there utterly broke with them, pe∣remptorily refusing subjection to the pope of Rome, It is also as certain that <HI>Colman,</HI> bishop of <HI>Lindis∣farn,</HI> and his northern clergy, who had their origi∣nal Christianity from <HI>Britain,</HI> maintained the grand dispute at <HI>Streanshale</HI> against <HI>Agelbert, Wilfrid,</HI> and the rest of the Romanists; that they retired and for∣sook their preferments rather than they would submit to the impositions of <HI>Rome.</HI> The laying aside their ancient observations, and receiving the papal tonsure, were looked upon by them both as innovations and badges of servitude to a foreign power, and therefore rejected by them, as they are by us at this day. We must maintain, like them, the customs of the church, which have been from the beginning; there <HI>always was a commemoration of Christ and his apostles at certain times,</HI> which we also observe without any he or she saints of the <HI>Roman</HI> make: There always was a sub∣mission to the authority of the church in matters of decency and order, which is all that we require, without the least subjection to the church of <HI>Rome:</HI> We yield no deference, we utterly renounce her au∣thority over us. And, to suppose that our reformers either wanted judgement to distinguish between the ancient customs of the church and the later inventions of popery, or that they wanted integrity to the true christian religion, whose works and martyrdom bear witness in their favour, is such a pretence as cannot support itself under a sincere consideration.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>We should be fond of episcopacy, if we did but review that opposition which the pope always made against it;</HI> if we did but observe <HI>how he could never compass his ends but by the destruction of its power.</HI> He raised up the se∣veral orders of monks, that those who were employed in religion might depend <HI>upon him, and not upon their Bishops;</HI> he exempted the monasteries from the juris∣diction of the diocesans, that all those rich planta∣tions might heartily espouse the tyranny and supersti∣tion of <HI>Rome.</HI> He did all he could to transform the bishops into monks, and prevailed so far, that every archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> thought it necessary to put on that habit; which made his <HI>episcopacy subservient to another sort of government.</HI> He found that a diocesan Bishop, with his clergy in a cathedral church, was such a bulwark to the national establishment, that he could not dilate his empire; he therefore, by his interest with King <HI>Egbert,</HI> got the great <HI>Oswald</HI> law to pass, <HI>by which the Presbyters were cast out, and monks put in∣to their places.</HI> How can episcopacy be a popish in∣vention, when it has been all along <HI>the great business of the pope to overthrow it?</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>We must ever own great honour and reverence due to <HI>Columba,</HI> who planted his monastery or university in the isle of <HI>Hye,</HI> upon the coasts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was a seminary for all the christian ministers of the north; but that the custom or education of this place should be against episcopacy is impossible, since they <HI>not only had a Bishop in that little island,</HI> but <HI>Adam∣nanus,</HI> one of the successors of <HI>Columba,</HI> gives us an account of the great deference they always paid to that order. Bishop <HI>Aidan</HI> came from thence, con∣verted the <HI>Northumbrians,</HI> had his episcopal see in the island of <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> which was afterwards re∣moved to <HI>Durham.</HI> After he was dead, Bishop <HI>Finan</HI> was ordained by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and succeeded him; by <HI>Finan</HI> was <HI>Diuma,</HI> the first Bishop of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> or∣dained, whose successors were also from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of the episcopal order. We meet also <HI>Colman</HI> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> that Bishop of the <HI>Northumbrians,</HI> who was ejected for the protestant cause. If <HI>Columba</HI> himself had such an affection of the monastic life, that he would not stir from <HI>Hye,</HI> and was of so great au∣thority that it was thought fit the Bishops of the north should be accountable to him and his successors, to whom so much was committed of the royal power, this can be no argument against episcopacy itself; since it is declared, at the same time, that such a submission of Bishops to an abbot was a perverting that order which was established in the church. Those who read only the account of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the last century, may, perhaps, have an opinion that there was an ancient of Presbyterian government there; but all authentic histories testify that they had the same constitution of ecclesiastical orders, which were in the rest of <HI>Britain,</HI> and all other christian nations.</Q></P></NOTE>, and also more particularly the Independents,
<PB N="346" REF="341"/>who, together with them, contend for the <HI>congregational</HI> or <HI>popular right</HI> to ELECT,
<PB N="347" REF="342"/>are apt to lay <HI>too much stress</HI> (perhaps) on this external circumstance of FREE ELEC∣TION;
<PB N="348" REF="343"/>for they generally consider it as <HI>essential</HI> to the sacerdotal function; where∣as,
<PB N="349" REF="344"/>in fact, it is only <HI>expedient</HI> and <HI>desira∣ble,</HI> but not absolutely necessary, being,
<PB N="350" REF="345"/>indeed, the most prudent mode of <HI>intro∣duction</HI> to the constituting <HI>rite of conse∣cration,</HI>
<PB N="351" REF="346"/>but no part of the <HI>rite</HI> itself, which consists only of <HI>solemn prayer,</HI> with the <HI>laying on of hands;</HI> in which latter, the <HI>laity</HI> can have no pretence to interfere
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may safely acknowledge, without injury to our <HI>election-rights,</HI> that the Bishops of the primitive church who succeeded immediately after the apostles, were not generally <HI>elected</HI> by the <HI>people,</HI> but were appointed ei∣ther by the apostles themselves, as I have before re∣marked, or by <HI>apostolic men,</HI> for which see the evidence of Tertullian, p. 243. <Q>Ceterum, si quae audent interserere se aetati apostolicae; ut ideo videantur ab apostolis traditae, quia sub apostolis fuerunt, possu∣mus dicere: edant ergo origines ecclesiarum suarum: <HI>evolvant erdinem episcoporum suorum, ita per successiones ab initio decurrentem, ut primus ille</HI> EPISCOPUS <HI>aliquem ex</HI> APOSTOLIS, <HI>vel</HI> APOSTOLICIS VIRIS, <HI>qui tamen cum apostolis perseveraverit, habuerit auctorem et ante∣cessorem. Hoe enim modo ecclesiae apostolicae census suos de∣ferunt: sicut Smyrnaeorum ecclesia Polycarpum ab Joanne conlocatum refert: sicut Romanorum, Clementem a Petro ordinatum itidem: perinde utique et ceterae exhibent quos ab Apostolis in Episcopatum constitutos apostolici seminis traduces habeant.</HI> Confingant tale aliquid haeretici. Quid enim illis post blasphemiam inlicitum est? sed etsi confinxerint, nihil promovebunt. Ipsa enim doc∣trina eorum cum apostolica comparata, ex diversitate et contrarietate sua pronunciabit, neque apostoli ali∣cujus auctoris esse, neque apostolici: quia sicut apos∣toli non diversa inter se docuissent, ita et apostolici non contraria apostolis edidissent. Nisi illi qui ab apostolis didicerunt, aliter praedicaverunt. Ad hanc itaque formam probabuntur ab illis ecclesiis, quae licet nullum ex apostolis, vel apostolicis, auctorem suum proferant, ut multo posteriores, quae denique quotidie instituuntur: tamen in eadem side conspi∣rantes, non minus Apostolicae deputantur, pro con∣sanguinitate doctrinae,</Q> &amp;c. p. 243. Paris edit. 1641.</NOTE>.
<PB N="352" REF="347"/>But this <HI>primitive rite</HI> of the church, the <HI>laying on of hands,</HI> is publicly rejected by
<PB N="353" REF="348"/>many of the Independent and Socinian ministers. <Q><HI>The ceremony of</HI> THE IM∣POSITION OF HANDS</Q> (says one of them, for instance, in reporting the cha∣racter of an eminent Socinian Preacher) <Q><HI>he also refused to submit to, because he considered it as void of any just meaning, where no extraordinary gifts are, or can be, imparted.</HI></Q> This opinion of <Q><HI>the imposition of hands,</HI></Q> must have been too hastily taken up, because it is certain∣ly erroneous. The fact is, that this ce∣remony, like all other <HI>outward rites,</HI> that were instituted by Christ, or his Apostles, <HI>may,</HI> or <HI>may not,</HI> be efficacious, according to the <HI>inward disposition,</HI> or sincerity, of the person to whom the <HI>outward rite</HI> is administered.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="349"/>Neither the administration of <HI>baptism,</HI> nor the participation of the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI>
<PB N="355" REF="350"/>can impart any good effect on those who receive them <HI>unworthily,</HI> without since∣rity,

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>GOD <HI>is a</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>and they that worship him, must worship him</HI> IN SPIRIT <HI>and in truth.</HI></Q> John iv. 24.</P>
<P>There is nothing in this text which can fairly be con∣strued <HI>against</HI> the use of external ceremonies, either of the <HI>laying on of hands,</HI> or of the <HI>sacramental institutions of Christ,</HI> though it is certainly applicable to enforce the necessity of a <HI>sincere and spiritual devotion</HI> in the use of them, as also in our daily <HI>prayers:</HI> but those men, who not only despise these institutions of Christ and his primitive church, but even neglect, for the most part, in their public meetings, Christ's positive injunctions TO PRAY ("<HI>Ask and it shall be given to you,</HI> &amp;c. Mat. vii. 7.) and neglect more especially TO PRAY for the HOLY SPIRIT, (which is so clearly promised <Q><HI>to them that ask,</HI></Q> Luke xi. 9-13.) through a groundless persuasion that they do obtain that heavenly gift by other means; those men, I fear, are under <HI>a very dan∣gerous delusion of a contrary spirit;</HI> for it would be unrea∣sonable to admit their pretensions to <HI>spiritual worship</HI> in the sense of that text of John, (viz. <Q><HI>in spirit and in truth,</HI></Q>) whilst they prefer their own <HI>novel</HI> way of worship to that <HI>true</HI> worship which was so clearly com∣manded by Christ, and practised by the primitive Christians, and the universal church.</P></NOTE> signification; but merely to
<PB N="357" REF="352"/>please men by an <HI>outward</HI> conformity to the ceremonies for some worldly advan∣tage,
<PB N="358" REF="353"/>or favour, as many do by way of <HI>test:</HI> to such men <HI>"no extraordinary gifts
<PB N="359" REF="354"/>are, or can be, imparted"</HI> by these <HI>out∣ward</HI> rites, which, on the contrary, ra∣ther increase their condemnation. For though very worthy ministers, who offi∣ciate therein, or administer these <HI>outward</HI> rites, may be deceived by the outward de∣portment of the persons to be baptized, or communicating, yet God's <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> is not to be mocked, as we learn by the sad example of Ananias and Saphira, whose dissimulation was punished by an imme∣diate stroke from God, to impress the in∣fant church with a due sense of the Al∣mighty Power, and the necessity of <HI>since∣rity</HI> in all things pertaining to God's Ser∣vice. Such extraordinary <HI>outward</HI> mani∣festations of God's Spirit are not now to
<PB N="360" REF="355"/>be expected; it is sufficient that they con∣tinued until authentic historical accounts of our holy religion were dispersed, in writing, throughout the greatest part of the known world, and the canon of the sacred Scriptures completed, in which ample accounts of them are related; so that we may say of the New Testament, as our Lord said of the Old Testament, adding, to <HI>the necessity of believing Moses and the Prophets,</HI> the <HI>necessary belief,</HI> also, of the New Testament, that the men who believe not these additional testimo∣nies, of Christ's Disciples and witnesses, <HI>would not believe, even if one should rise from the dead!</HI> Thus it appears, that the extraordinary <HI>outward</HI> manifestations of God's Spirit, in working miracles, are no longer <HI>necessary</HI> for the edification of the church; but we must not, therefore, say that <Q><HI>no extraordinary gifts are, or can be, imparted!</HI></Q> For miracles are not the only test of the real inspiration of <HI>God's
<PB N="361" REF="356"/>Holy Spirit,</HI> but <HI>love, good works, and hold∣ing fast the faith, which was once delivered to the Saints:</HI> These are the <HI>fruits</HI> by which we are to judge of the tree; and, without these, even miracles are to be suspected of delusion, and are to be es∣teemed rather as the <HI>lying wonders of Satan</HI> than as the works of God! The power of <HI>working miracles,</HI> therefore, is not such an <HI>"extraordinary gift,"</HI> as we have any right to look for, or to expect under the present dispensation of the <HI>christian religion;</HI> and yet <Q><HI>the gift of God's spirit</HI></Q> (which every true Chris∣tian has a <HI>right</HI> to expect, according to the unquestionable promises of Christ) is certainly <HI>"an extraordinary gift,"</HI> and is as certainly <HI>"imparted"</HI> to all that <HI>duly ask it</HI> in the meritorious name of our Redeemer, if we may confide in the truth of the holy Scriptures! It is always <HI>"an extraordinary gift,"</HI> (though <Q><HI>im∣parted</HI></Q>
<PB N="362" REF="357"/>according to <HI>the ordinary</HI> dis∣pensation of our religion,) because it sup∣ports and endows pious and worthy men, on many occasions, far beyond their <HI>ordi∣nary,</HI> or natural, abilities and strength. It is, I say, a real addition to the <HI>ordinary</HI> na∣ture of man, and therefore always <Q>an <HI>extraordinary gift;</HI></Q> being nothing less than a real participation <Q><HI>of the</HI> DIVINE NATURE,</Q> of which we may, if we will, be <HI>partakers</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) through the <Q><HI>exceeding great and precious promises</HI></Q> of that divine person <Q><HI>that hath called us to glory and virtue.</HI></Q> See 2 Pet. i. 3, 4.</P>
<P>If men are thus assured that this <Q><HI>ex∣traordinary gift</HI></Q> may be obtained by <HI>asking,</HI> according to Christ's directions, they surely cannot doubt of its being <Q><HI>im∣parted</HI></Q> when they <HI>ask it</HI> in a more particular manner on great and solemn occasions, as at the <HI>baptism</HI> of adults, or
<PB N="363" REF="358"/>the <HI>confirmation</HI> of persons that have been baptized in their infancy; and at the sa∣cramental <HI>commemoration of Christ's death,</HI> according to our Lord's own insti∣tution: these <HI>outward rites</HI> cannot <HI>impart the extraordinary gift;</HI> but the goodness and truth of God are absolutely pledged (if I may use such an expression) to ful∣fil the <Q><HI>exceeding great and precious pro∣mises</HI></Q> in favour of <HI>prayer</HI> for that <HI>ex∣traordinary gift:</HI> and such <HI>prayer</HI> (having this the object) doth always make a part of those <HI>solemn rites;</HI> whereby they are most certainly rendered efficacious, if <HI>sincerity</HI> be not wanting in those persons to whom they are administered.</P>
<P>And it is exactly the same thing with respect to <HI>"the imposition of hands,"</HI> (ei∣ther in the consecration of Bishops, or in the ordination of Priests and of Deacons,) because that <HI>ancient rite</HI> of Christ's church is always performed with <HI>solemn prayer,</HI> in
<PB N="364" REF="359"/>Christ's name, for the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> to guide and assist the persons consecrated or or∣dained; and the prayers of the congre∣gation are also desired on their behalf; and therefore, if the persons <HI>elected</HI> to be consecrated for the office and dignity of Bishops, and the candidates for Priests, or Deacons orders, are really <HI>sincere</HI> them∣selves in their <HI>prayers</HI> and undertakings, there is no doubt but <Q><HI>the laying on of hands,</HI></Q> thus accompanied with suita∣ble prayer and devotion, is truly effica∣cious, and doth <Q><HI>impart the extraordi∣nary gift</HI></Q> abovementioned. For the action of <HI>"laying on hands"</HI> hath nothing in it indecent, immoral, or contrary to God's laws, such as might be supposed to hinder the good effect of Christ's absolute <HI>promises to them that ask;</HI> but, on the contrary, is authenticated and sanctified by <HI>apostolic usage,</HI> declared in canonical
<PB N="365" REF="360"/>Scripture, as well as by the constant sub∣sequent practice of all the primitive churches of Christ; and ought not, there∣fore, to be laid aside on the groundless pretence that <Q><HI>no extraordinary gifts are, or can be, imparted.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>A very worthy member of parliament, having lately read as much of this tract as was then printed, was pleased to pro∣pose the following queries; in answer to which the following letter was sent to him by the author, viz.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P><HI>How could we divide this and other great towns into tithings?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Would not streets be a better division in cities? Parishes and streets, instead of tithings and hundreds?</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ANSWER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE ancient mode of dividing great cities was by <HI>wards;</HI> each of which was governed by an <HI>alderman,</HI> the <HI>ealdor∣man</HI> of the Anglo-Saxons, an officer of great authority in the <HI>common law;</HI> being a JUSTICIARY, and having all the powers of our modern <HI>justices of the peace;</HI> and, what is more, was always elected by the
<PB N="368" REF="362"/><HI>house-keepers</HI> or <HI>deciners</HI> of the <HI>ward over</HI> which he presides. This antient mode of division by no means interferes with the lesser divisions of <HI>tithings</HI> and <HI>hundreds;</HI> so far from it, that the government of the <HI>wards</HI> is not complete without them. The Lord Mayor's precept, to the alder∣men, orders them (to this day) to hold courts of <HI>frankpledge</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bohun's Privilegia Londini, p. 386. under the head of <HI>Wardmote Courts</HI> and the Lord Mayor's annual Precept to hold them; which latter, amongst other things, contains the following article.—No. 11. <Q>And, for that, of late, there is more resort to the city of per∣sons evil affected in religion, and otherwise, than in former times hath been; you shall diligently inquire if any man be received to dwell or abide within your Ward, that is not <HI>put under</HI> FRANKPLEDGE, <HI>as he ought to be by the custom of the city:</HI></Q> &amp;c.</NOTE>; which were not without the regular divisions of <HI>tithings</HI> to give them effect. The wards are <HI>local</HI> divisions of various magnitude, and have been formed, (as you suggest,) some by <HI>streets,</HI> some by the intersection of <HI>brooks,</HI> now covered over; but those various di∣mensions
<PB N="369" REF="363"/>of space required a regular <HI>nu∣merical</HI> division of the <HI>housekeepers,</HI> in or∣der to ascertain the due proportion of the representatives in the <HI>common-council</HI> of the city.</P>
<P>The average-rate of <HI>common-council∣men</HI> to the <HI>housekeepers,</HI> or <HI>deciners,</HI> is, at present, about one to 90. And as the city was, in antient times, more popu∣lous, and the houses smaller for each fa∣mily, when men were restrained by law from building in the environs of the city, it is probable that the true proportion of <HI>housekeepers,</HI> to elect <HI>one common-council∣man,</HI> should be 100; so that the com∣mon council has formerly been an assem∣bly of <HI>hundreders</HI> or <HI>high constables.</HI> As the gates of the city have been removed so as to leave this most important place entirely exposed to the fatal consequences of any sudden riot, the attacks of any
<PB N="370" REF="364"/>hardened banditti, and (especially in cases of any alarms by fire,) to the most dange∣rous confluence of multitudes of unknown people, many of whom plunder the dis∣tressed, and others hinder the necessary means of assistance, it is highly expedient that some means of defence should be de∣vised. I have been told, that, in the great cities of Japan, the streets are barricadoed and shut up with <HI>palisade</HI> gates every night, and that the people are actually divided into <HI>tithings</HI> and <HI>hundreds.</HI> I have much to say on this subject; and, if you are not going out of town immediately, I will do myself the honour to wait on you and communicate my thoughts.</P>
