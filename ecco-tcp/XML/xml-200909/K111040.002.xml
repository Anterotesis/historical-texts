<PB REF="8"/>
<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF Mrs. <HI>PILKINGTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SO being entered on a new Scene, I proceed: I got as far as
<HI>Chester</HI>; but, as it was Winter, the Stage Coach set out but once a
Week, namely on <HI>Mon∣day</HI>; and as I did not land till
<HI>Tuesday,</HI> I had near a Week to stay at an Inn, an Expence my poor
Pocket could not well afford. But Providence sent me a timely Relief; for as
I was sitting with my Land∣lady, by her Kitchen Fire, a Gentleman came in,
who knew me; he was going to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Wind proving contrary, 
<PB N="2" REF="9"/> he was a Fellow Prisoner, as I may call it, with me; and a
very agreeable one he proved, for he never permitted me to pay a Farthing. My
Landlady, who was really a Gentlewoman, and he, and I, di∣verted away the Time
with Ombre, Read∣ing, and Pratling, very tolerably: And as the Gentleman knew
my Misfortunes, and had known all my Family, he very gene∣rously, and not
without many Apologies, gave me three Guineas; a very seasonable
Assistance: Thus we may see, that 
<Q> 
<L>Each good the virtuous Soul itself denies,</L> 
<L>The watchful Care of Providence supplies.</L></Q> By this I
was enabled to travel. I learned with great Pleasure, that a Member of
Par∣liament and two Gentlemen of the Law, had taken Places in the Coach, and
hoped for an agreeable Journey; but sadly dis∣appointed I was, for
certainly three such Brutes I never saw; they affronted me every Moment,
because I was born in <HI>Ire∣land</HI>; and I believe they had not the
Cho∣lick, for they made themselves very easy: <PB N="3" REF="10"/> But the
worst Circumstance of all was, that they used to sit up drinking all
Night, and forced me to pay my Club for their Wine, though I never even saw
it.</P>
<P>They were great <HI>Walpolians,</HI> and many a Trick in the
Elections did they relate before me, taking it for granted that I was a Fool:
At last, they very civilly de∣manded of me, what Business I had to
<HI>Lon∣don?</HI> So, resolving to divert myself, I told them, I was going
there in hopes Sir <HI>Robert</HI> would marry me; this made them very merry,
they laughed at my Folly, and I at theirs. At length we picked up a
<HI>Welch</HI> Parson, of whom I had the Ho∣nour of making a Conquest,
which afford∣ed us great Entertainment, for about fifty Miles. I always
permitted him to pay my Club; but, like a true Levite, he began to offer a
little more of his Civility than I was willing to accept of; so, finding that
would not do, he made me a Present of a Ginger-bread-nut, curiously wrapt
up in white Paper, and after making me give him a Promise to write to him, he
left us.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11"/>As my Fellow-Travellers had observed his
amorous Behaviour, and saw him de∣liver his Present, they earnestly
requested to know what it was; so to oblige them, I shewed it. When we
came to <HI>St. Al∣bans,</HI> we were met by a Gentleman in a Coach and Six,
whom they stiled the great Mr. <HI>Mid—ton,</HI> of
<HI>Chirk-Castle</HI> in <HI>Denbigh∣shire,</HI> who was related to them
all; so they went into his Coach, and I got two Fe∣male Companions. However,
we all baited at the same Inn at <HI>Barnet,</HI> and this prodigious Man
insisted on having the Ladies for his Guests; and, laying hold of my
Hand, he swore that little <HI>Hibernian</HI> Nymph should dine with him;
so up Stairs we all went, where he entertained us with an Account of his
ample Estate, saying, it was much larger than the Duke of
<HI>Bedford</HI>'s; but how unworthy he was to possess it, the Sequel
will shew.</P>
<P>My Adventures with the <HI>Welch</HI> Parson made him laugh very
heartily; and he in∣sisted on my keeping my Promise in writ∣ing to him,
assuring me he would take care <PB N="5" REF="12"/> the Letter should go
safe. So, by way of Amusement, I scribbled as follows: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q> 
<L>Your Ginger-bread, unbroken,</L> 
<L>Remains a true Love Token.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Am assured, by your honourable Coun∣trymen, that you
pass for a Wit in <HI>Wales</HI>; it is therefore my sincere Advice to you,
never to quit it, lest the rest of the World should be malicious enough
to re∣fuse you your due Praise. As for the Favour you offered to me, why
you offer∣ed it like a Priest, and I refused it like a Fool; if you write
to me, direct, To the Right Honourable the Lady <HI>W—lp—le,</HI>
in <HI>Downing-street, Westminster.</HI> I will en∣deavour to prevail on
my Spouse elect to send you a Fiddle and a Hogshead of good
<HI>October,</HI> to entertain your Parishioners every <HI>Sunday.</HI></P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>I am, sweet Sir Crape, Yours.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="13"/>Mr. <HI>Mid—ton</HI> said, he thought I
could read Men as well as Sir <HI>Robert.</HI> But now 
<Q> 
<L>Came the Reckoning, when the Feast was o'er,</L> 
<L>The dreadful Reck'ning! and we smil'd no more.</L></Q> For
our Grandee made us pay our Club! 'tis true, indeed, he writ something to
make me amends, which was this: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>My Charmer,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF you will leave a Line for me at <HI>Brownjohn</HI>'s
Coffee-House in <HI>Or∣mond Street,</HI> and give me a Direction where to
find you, you shall find a Friend in</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>J. M—n.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>But really I never did, so we parted, and I never saw him
more. The Sample he had given of the Narrowness of his Heart was sufficient
to disgust me; and tho' I am not fond of making national Reflections, yet I
would of all things <PB N="7" REF="14"/> never trust a <HI>Welchman,</HI>
lest, as <HI>Falstaff</HI> says of the <HI>Welch</HI> Fairy, he should
trans∣form me into a Piece of toasted Cheese.</P>
<P>At length I got to <HI>London,</HI> where, after having paid all
Demands, I had three Guineas left, with which the next Day I took a Lodging in
<HI>Berry-Street, St. James</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I wrote to <HI>Ireland</HI> to no purpose it seemed; for I
never got any Answer; so in a very short Time I was in great
Dis∣tress, and knew not what to do. Having heard Mr. <HI>Ed—d
W—p—le</HI> was a very humane Gentleman, I wrote to him, and he
sent me a Letter in return, wherein he promised to wait on me the next
Evening, and accordingly came; nay, and sate with me three Hours; at the End
of which Time he told me, he did not know how he could possibly be of any
Service to me. I told him I had some Poems, which I intended to print by
Sub∣scription, and if he would do me the Ho∣nour of promoting it, it was all
the Fa∣vour I desired.—He answered, if he undertook it, he should
certainly neglect <PB N="8" REF="15"/> it; but however he would give me some
Money; so he pulled out his Purse, and took out five Guineas: Would not any
Person have then thought themselves sure of them? but according to the
old Pro∣verb, <HI>Many a thing falls out between the Lip and the Cup</HI>; the
Gentleman took a second Thought, and put the Guineas in his Purse again,
assuring me, it was not convenient for him to part with them.</P>
<P>And, indeed, I believe he is a Beast without a Heart; for this
is his constant Answer to every Person, as I have fre∣quently observed,
when those whom he chose for Friends and Companions wanted but the
smallest Assistance from him. So he 
<Q> 
<L>For Poets open Table kept,</L> 
<L>But ne'er consider'd where they slept;</L> 
<L>Himself, as rich as fifty Jews,</L> 
<L>Was easy, tho' they wanted Shoes.</L> 
<BIBL>Swift.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>On this I arose, and told him, as I perceived it was not in his
Inclination to do <PB N="9" REF="16"/> me any Service, I would no longer take up
his important Time, and civilly dis∣missed him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dodsley</HI> ventured to print THE TRIAL OF CONSTANCY,
by which I got about five Guineas, and a much greater Happiness, the Favour
and Friendship of the POET LAUREAT. I was advised to enclose one of them
to him, which I did, in as genteel a Letter as I knew how to write: The good
Gentleman came to visit me, and did me every Act of Friendship in his
Power; it is to his un∣wearied Zeal in my Behalf, that I owe that I yet live to
thank him; for, 
<Q> 
<L>Had I not been by him supply'd,</L> 
<L>I must a thousand Times have dy'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>I must not here omit, that when the Poem was published, I
enclosed two of them to Mr. <HI>W—lp—le,</HI> who wrote me a
Letter of Thanks, and that was all: <HI>Mem.</HI> he owes me Two Shillings.</P>
<P>As I wanted to make Interest with the Great, I took a Lodging in
<HI>St. James</HI>'s <PB N="10" REF="17"/> <HI>Street,</HI> exactly opposite
to <HI>White</HI>'s Choco∣late-house, where happening to see Capt.
<HI>Meade</HI> go in, I wrote over to him, and he was so kind to give me an
Invitation to his House, which was within a small Mile from
<HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> a delightful Walk through <HI>Bushy-Park</HI> leading
to it: This saved me a great deal of Expence: for as the Parliament was now
broke up, <HI>London</HI> was quite empty, and Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> being gone
to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> I could not, 'till the Return of Winter, hope to gain
any Sub∣scribers, so I went into the Country with great Pleasure.</P>
<P>The Captain had a very sweet Dwelling, a pretty Wife, and four
lovely Children. We went to Church the following <HI>Sunday:</HI> Dr.
<HI>Hales</HI> was Minister of the Parish, and it was customary with him,
whenever he saw a Stranger in his Congregation, to pay them a Visit; so,
after Evening Prayer, we were honoured with his Company. Capt. <HI>Meade</HI>
told him, I was his Sister Parson and Sister Writer; a merry Sort of an
Introduction. The Doctor asked me, what I wrote? and the Captain an∣swered 
<PB N="11" REF="18"/> for me, that I was going to pub∣lish a Volume of Poems
by Subscription. I told the Doctor, my Writings might amuse, but his made
the World the wiser and the better, as I had had the Pleasure of reading
them. I turned the Discourse to Natural Philosphy, on which the Doctor
gave us an Invitation to a Course of Ex∣periments the next Day. Tho' nothing
I then saw was new to me, yet his Reflec∣tions on every Object were, as by
them he demonstrated the Divinity; and, wrapt in holy Extasy, he soared
above this little terrene Spot, and, like a true High Priest, led his
Auditors up to the Holiest of Holies.</P>
<P>After this sacred Banquet, with which my Soul was so elevated,
that I could not avoid paying him my Acknowledgments in, I believe, an
enthusiastic Strain, we walked into the Garden, where we were entertained
with some fine Fruit, Cream, Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a rural Collation.</P>
<P>The Doctor asked me, if I had any printed Proposals for my
Poems, to which he promised not only to subscribe himself, but also
to use his Interest for me; I told <PB N="12" REF="19"/> him I had, and that
I would give him some when I came to Prayers the next Morning.</P>
<P>But I could not sleep all Night, so at Day-break I arose,
and walked into <HI>Bushy-Park</HI>; I sat down by the Side of a fine
Cascade, and listened to the tunefully-fall∣ling Waters so long, that
methought they became vocal, and uttered articulate Sounds; 'till, lulled by
them, I fell in∣sensibly asleep, when suddenly I imagined the
Water-Nymph, to whom this Spring belonged, arose before me with a lovely
Countenance, and a transparent azure Robe, and putting a Paper into my Hand,
disappeared. I thought I read it; and as I presently awoke, I remembered
all the Lines; so, having a Pencil and Sheet of Paper in my Pocket, I wrote
them down. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To the Reverend Dr. <HI>HALES.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HAIL, holy Sage! whose compre∣hensive Mind,</L>
<L>Not to this narrow Spot of Earth confin'd,</L>
<L>Thro' num'rous Worlds can Nature's Laws explore,</L>
<L>Where none but NEWTON ever trod before;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="20"/>And, guided by Philosophy
divine,</L>
<L>See thro' his Works th' Almighty Maker shine:</L>
<L>Whether you trace him thro' yon rolling Spheres,</L>
<L>Where, crowned with boundless Glory, he appears;</L>
<L>Or in the Orient Sun's resplendent Rays,</L>
<L>His setting Lustre, or his Noontide Blaze,</L>
<L>New Wonders still thy curious Search at∣tend,</L>
<L>Begun on Earth, in highest Heav'n to end.</L>
<L>O! while thou dost those God-like Works pursue,</L>
<L>What Thanks, from Humankind, to Thee are due!</L>
<L>Whose Error, Doubt, and Darkness, You remove,</L>
<L>And charm down Knowledge from her Throne above.</L>
<L>Nature, to Thee, her choicest Secrets yields,</L>
<L>Unlocks her Springs, and opens all her Fields;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="21"/>Shews the rich Treasure that her
Breast contains,</L>
<L>In azure Fountains, or enamell'd Plains;</L>
<L>Each healing Stream, each Plant of vir∣tuous Use,</L>
<L>To thee their Medicinal Pow'rs produce:</L>
<L>Pining Disease and Anguish wing their Flight,</L>
<L>And rosy Health renews us to Delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When You, with Art, the Animal dissect,</L>
<L>And, with the microscopic Aid, inspect,</L>
<L>Where, from the Heart, unnumber'd Ri∣vers glide,</L>
<L>And faithful back return their purple Tide;</L>
<L>How fine the Mechanism, by Thee dis∣play'd!</L>
<L>How wonderful is ev'ry Creature made!</L>
<L>Vessels, too small for Sight, the Fluids
strain,</L>
<L>Concoct, digest, assimilate, sustain:</L>
<L>In deep Attention, and Surprize, we gaze,</L>
<L>And, to Life's Author, raptur'd, pour out Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
<L>What Beauties dost Thou open to the Sight,</L>
<L>Untwisting all the Golden Threads of Light!</L>
<L>Each Parent Colour tracing to its Source,</L>
<L>Distinct they live, obedient to Thy Force!</L>
<L>Nought from Thy Penetration is con∣ceal'd,</L>
<L>And LIGHT, Himself, shines to Thy Soul reveal'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when the Sacred Writings You dis∣play,</L>
<L>And on the mental Eye shed purer Day;</L>
<L>In radiant Colours Truth array'd we see,</L>
<L>Confess her Charms, and guided up by Thee;</L>
<L>Soaring sublime, on Contemplation's Wings,</L>
<L>The Fountain seek, whence Truth eter∣nal springs.</L>
<L>Fain would I wake the consecrated Lyre,</L>
<L>And sing the Sentiments Thou didst in∣spire!</L>
<L>But find my Strength unequal to a Theme,</L>
<L>Which asks a <HI>Milton</HI>'s, or a Seraph's Flame!</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="23"/>If, thro' weak Words, one Ray of
Reason shine,</L>
<L>Thine was the Thought, the Errors only mine.</L>
<L>Yet may these Numbers to thy Soul im∣part</L>
<L>The humble Incense of a grateful Heart.</L>
<L>Trifles, with GOD himself, Acceptance find,</L>
<L>If offer'd with Sincerity of Mind;</L>
<L>Then, like the Deity, Indulgence shew,</L>
<L>Thou, most <HI>like Him,</HI> of all his Works
be∣low.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>After this pleasing Reverie, I returned home, and had
sufficient Time to trans∣cribe the Lines fair, and dress myself ere the
Bell rung for Morning Prayer. As we were coming out of Church, I gave the Poem
and some Proposals, made up in a Pacquet, to the Doctor; who came in the
Evening to visit us, and brought an∣other Clergyman with him, who was the
Minister of <HI>Henley upon Thames</HI>; they both subscribed to me, and
took a good many of the Proposals, which they disposed of to Persons of
Distinction.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24"/>So having got a little Money, and Capt.
<HI>Meade</HI> being commanded on Duty to the <HI>Tower</HI> for six Months,
we all came to <HI>London</HI>; where finding my Lodging emp∣ty, I once more
returned to <HI>St. James</HI>'s.</P>
<P>My good Friend Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> was my first Visitor: He
had got about four Gui∣neas for me; and told me, he was assured, by a
Gentleman of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who frequented <HI>White</HI>'s, that my
Husband was a Poet, and that all I had to publish were only some Trifles
I had stolen from him, which had greatly injured me: 
<Q REND="inline">"But (said he) to set that Right, you must
take some Subject, that has never yet been touched upon, dress it
poetically, and send the Lines to <HI>White</HI>'s."</Q> This was really a
hard Task; but as my Credit was now at Stake, I was obliged to exert
myself, and the next Day sent him the following Lines. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>CIBBER.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN You advis'd me, Sir, to chuse</L>
<L>Some odd new Subject for the Muse,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="25"/>From Thought to Thought unpleas'd I
chang'd,</L>
<L>Thro' Nature, Art, and Science rang'd;</L>
<L>Yet still could nought discover New,</L>
<L>Till, happily, I fix'd on You.</L>
<L>Your Stoic Turn, and chearful Mind,</L>
<L>Have mark'd You, out of all Mankind,</L>
<L>The oddest Theme my Muse can find.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like other Men, you nothing do;</L>
<L>The World's one Round of Joy to You.</L>
<L>The Wise, the Weak, the Sot, the Sage,</L>
<L>Your Hours can equally engage:</L>
<L>Tho' Sense and Merit are Your Choice,</L>
<L>You can with gayest Fops rejoice;</L>
<L>Can taste them all, in Season fit,</L>
<L>And match their Follies, or their Wit.</L>
<L>Truth has in you so fix'd her Seat,</L>
<L>Not all your Converse with the Great</L>
<L>Has yet misled you to Deceit.</L>
<L>Your Breast so bare, so free from Blame,</L>
<L>Why sure your Heart and Tongue's the same!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Most Hearts the harder grow with Years,</L>
<L>But yours yet lends th' Afflicted Tears;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="26"/>Has Merit pin'd in Want and Grief?</L>
<L>Your bounteous Hand has brought Relief.</L>
<L>To you, where Frailty shades the Soul,</L>
<L>One shining Grace commends the whole.</L>
<L>Can no Experience make you wiser,</L>
<L>Nor Age convert you to a Miser?</L>
</LG>

<L>New too in other Points I find you,</L>
<L>Where modern Wits are thrown behind you.</L>
<L>Some praise a Patton, and reveal him;</L>
<L>You paint so true, you can't conceal him:</L>
<L>Their gawdy Praise undue, but shames him,</L>
<L>While yours, by Likeness, only names him.</L>
<L>Not Wit, that libels, makes you grave,</L>
<L>At what you smile, my Sense wou'd rave;</L>
<L>While jealous Bards by Dunces stung,</L>
<L>With Verse provok'd, aveng'd the Wrong.</L>
<L>With an uncommon Candour, you</L>
<L>Such Bards more humanely subdue:</L>
<L>Calm and compos'd, your conscious Spirit</L>
<L>Can celebrate with Praise their Merit:</L>

<L>That publicly speaks well of you.</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>This met with a very favourable Recep∣tion, and Mr.
<HI>Cibber</HI> shewed it to all the <PB N="21" REF="28"/> Noblemen at
<HI>White</HI>'s, as a Means to engage them to subscribe to me, which, to
oblige him, many of them did; and, to make it public, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>
inserted it in a Pam∣phlet of his own called the <HI>Egotist,</HI> or
<HI>Colley upon Cibber.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day a pleasant droll Gentleman, who was so old that
he had been Page to King <HI>James</HI> when he was Duke of <HI>York,</HI>
insisted on Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s introducing him to me, which accordingly
he did. This Gentleman, who was a Colonel in the first Regiment of Foot
Guards, had by Nature all that Education gives to others; neither had his Years
in the least deprest the Vi∣vacity or Gallantry of his Spirit. He said a
thousand witty Things in half an Hour, and at last, with as great Gravity
as his comic Face would admit of, said, that he wished I would take him
into Keep∣ing. I answered, I had really never seen any Person with whom I
was better enter∣tained, and, therefore, if he would make over all his real and
personal Estate to me, and dispose of his Regiment, and give me the
Money, I would keep him—<PB N="22" REF="29"/> out of it. He swore a good
Oath, he be∣lieved me, and liked me for my Sinceri∣ty.—I could relate a
Number of pleasant Stories of this old Gentleman; but as his Wit generally
bordered on Indecen∣cy, and sometimes on Prophaneness, they are not proper
for a female Pen.</P>
<P>He used to hire me to write Love Let∣ters to him, which, as a
Proof of his being a young Man, he shewed at <HI>White</HI>'s; Lord
<HI>W—m—th</HI> was curious to see the Writer; upon which he
brought his Lordship, and Lord <HI>Aug—stus F—tz
R—y,</HI> since dead, to visit me. They bantered me on my Taste, in
writing so many fine Things to an old Fellow, when so many young ones,
themselves in particular, would be proud of them—I assured their
Lordships, I would oblige them on the same Terms I did the Colonel, who
always paid me hand∣somely for my Compliments.</P>
<P>This turned all their Raillery on the Co∣lonel, who with great
good Humour con∣fessed the Truth. 
<Q REND="inline">"Why Colonel, said Lord <HI>F—z
R—y,</HI> you told us you sup∣ported <PB N="23" REF="30"/> this
Lady."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, returned he, but you know I am an old
Lyar."</Q></P>
<P>The Noblemen insisted on my telling them how much a piece the
Colonel gave me for writing Billetdoux to him. The Colonel answered, that his
Money had been fatal to my Family; for that he had lent my Uncle Colonel
<HI>Mead</HI> twenty Guineas one Night at the Groom Porters, who died the next
Morning of an Apoplectic Fit; and so, said he, 
<Q REND="inline">"out of pure Af∣fection to my dear little one
here, I am very cautious how I give her any; be∣sides, added he, very archly,
I could not be convinced of the Sincerity of her Passion for me, if she
made any De∣mands on my Pocket."</Q></P>
<P>Lord <HI>W—m—th</HI> asked me, how I approved of
this Doctrine? I answered, the Colonel, had so genteel and witty a manner
of excusing his Avarice, that should he ever grow generous, we should
lose a thousand Pleasantries.</P>
<P>Each of the Noblemen gave me a Guinea, by way of Subscription to
my Poems; they pressed hard on the Colonel <PB N="24" REF="31"/> for his
Contribution, which, for the Rea∣sons aforesaid, he absolutely
refused.</P>
<P>This gave Occasion to the following Lines; which, lest the
Colonel should not communicate, I inclosed to Lord
<HI>F—z-R—y.</HI> 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To the Hon. Colonel <HI>D—NC—BE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SINCE so oft to the Great of my Favours you boast,</L>
<L>When, you know, you enjoy'd but some Kisses at
most;</L>
<L>And those, as you say, never ought to be sold,</L>
<L>For Love's too divine, to be barter'd for Gold.</L>
<L>Since this is your Maxim, I beg a Re∣ceipt,</L>
<L>To know, how without it a Lover can eat.</L>
<L>For tho' the fine Heroes, we read in Ro∣mances,</L>
<L>Subsisted whole Weeks upon amorous Fancies;</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="32"/>And yet were so strong, if those
Writers say true,</L>
<L>That Dragons, and Giants, some thou∣sands they
slew;</L>
<L>Those Chiefs were of Origin surely divine!</L>
<L>And descended from <HI>Jove,</HI> as direct as a
Line.</L>
<L>But in our corrupted, degenerate Days,</L>
<L>We find neither Heroes, nor Lovers, like these:</L>
<L>Our Men have scarce Courage to speak to a Lass,</L>
<L>'Till they've had a full Meal, and a chir∣rupping
Glass;</L>
<L>And so much in myself of the Mortal I find,</L>
<L>That my Body wants Diet, as well as my Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, pray, Sir, consider the Case of your
Mistress,</L>
<L>Who neither can kiss, nor write Verses, in
Distress:</L>
<L>For <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and <HI>Ceres,</HI> we frequently
prove,</L>
<L>Are Friends to the Muses, as well as to Love.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="33"/>Lord <HI>A—stus</HI> did not fail to
shew the Lines to all the Noblemen at <HI>White</HI>'s, who heartily bantered
the Colonel on his Gene∣rosity to his Mistress.</P>
<P>The next Day, as I was sprinkling some Flower-pots, which
stood on very broad Leads, under the Dining-room Window, Colonel
<HI>D—nc—be,</HI> the Duke of <HI>B—lt—n,</HI> and the
Earl of <HI>W—nch—ea</HI> stood filling out Wine, and drinking to
me: So I took up the Pen and Ink, full in their View; and, as I was not
acquainted with any of them, except the Colonel, I sent over to him these
Lines: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>YOUR rosy Wine</L>
<L>Looks bright and fine;</L>
<L>But yet it does not chear me:</L>
<L>The Cause I guess,</L>
<L>Is surely this,</L>
<L>The Bottle is not near me.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>You shew that Sight,</L>
<L>To give Delight,</L>
<L>If I may truly judge ye:</L>
<L>But would ye move</L>
<L>My Wit, or Love,</L>
<L>I beg, Sir, I may pledge ye.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="34"/>Lord <HI>W—nch—ea</HI> bid the
Colonel send me all the Wine in the House: 
<Q REND="inline">"Ah! (said the Colonel) that might in∣jure her
Health, but I will send her one Bottle of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> to chear her
Spirits."</Q> Accordingly the Waiter brought it; the Noblemen all gathered to
the Window, so he filled me out a Glass, which, mak∣ing them a low
Reverence, I drank, and retired.</P>
<P>But the Colonel, resolving to have Share, quickly followed his
Bottle; he came in a desperate ill Temper; cursed the K—g, D—
of <HI>C—l—d,</HI> the whole M—y, and me into the Bargain. I
asked him, whether giving me a Bottle of Wine had grieved him so much? He
said, No; but that he had been fifty Years in the Army, and was but
Lieute∣nant-Colonel; and that the D— of <HI>C—l—d</HI> had
put a young Fellow over his Head. He pulled down his Stocking, and shewed me
where he had been shot through the Leg at the Siege of <HI>Lisle</HI>; then
he opened his Bosom, on <PB N="28" REF="35"/> which he had several
honourable Scars, and swore heartily, that, were it not in a Time of War, he
would throw up his Commission. I could not but agree, that his Resentment
had but too just a Foun∣dation; 
<Q REND="inline">"But, dear Sir, I had no hand in all this."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No; (said he) but I did not know any Person,
to whom I could speak my Mind freely, or who would bear my Peevishness,
but you."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, (said I) an you were as pee∣vish
as an Emperor, I'll bear it all, since you please to bestow it on
me.—But I believe we had as good drink our <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and we will
new model the Government according to our Fancies."</Q> He sat very
pensive, said his Head aked, then rose in a surly Sort of a manner, and
went over to <HI>White</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Whether any thing he had met with there pleased him, I know not,
but about Nine at Night, as I sat writing, I heard his Voice on the Stairs,
crying, 
<Q REND="inline">"Poke after me, my Lord, poke after me."</Q> So I
bid my Maid, light the Colonel up: He brought with him his Grace of 
<PB N="29" REF="36"/> <HI>M—lb—gh,</HI> a lovely Gentleman; he
presented him to me, by his Title, which was honoured by his wearing it. The
D— saluted me; but what shall I now say! I think my boasted
Constancy of Mind quite forsook me; I trembled at his Touch, and, though I
knew not why, was more disordered at Sight of him, than ever I had been
before in my Life. The Colonel asked me, what was the Matter? I said, I
believed I had drank too much Tea, which, joined to the unex∣pected Honour he
had now conferred on me, put me into a little Flutter.</P>
<P>His Grace laid hold of my Hand, and kissed it, saying, it
was the sweetest Thing in Nature, to put a Lady into a little Hurry of
Spirits, 
<Q REND="inline">"and so, said he, Colonel, I shall meet you
at <HI>White</HI>'s, either to-night or to-morrow Morn∣ing; for I have a mind
to have a little Chat with this Lady alone."</Q> The Colonel knew his Duty too
well to disobey a <HI>M—lb—gh,</HI> and left us, wishing his
Grace Success.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="37"/>Now, indeed, for the first Time, I was
afraid of myself; but was infinitely more so, when his Grace told me, he
had learned from the Colonel, that I was in some Distress, and, opening
his Pocket-Book, presented me with a Bank Note on Sir <HI>Francis Child</HI>
for Fifty Pounds.</P>
<P>This was the Ordeal, or fiery Trial; Youth, Beauty, Nobility of
Birth, and unsought Generosity, attacking at once the most desolate
Person in the World. His Grace, I believe, guessed at my
Ap∣prehensions, by the Concern which was but too visible in my Countenance,
and generously assured me, that he was above making any hard Conditions,
that I might look up with Chearfulness, and not rivet my Eyes to the Floor,
but consider him as a sincere and disinterested Friend.</P>
<P>This quite revived me, and gave me an unusual Flow of Spirits,
which highly pleased my illustrious Benefactor: He de∣sired I would write
something merry to the Colonel, who, at his Departure, charged me not to
wrong his Bed. So to please his Grace, and also to convince him I 
<PB N="31" REF="38"/> could write, I gave him, in about ten Minutes, the
following Lines. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L><HI>STREPHON</HI> to-night his <HI>Chloe</HI> told,</L>
<L>He had the Head-ach, and grew old;</L>
<L>Tho' well she knew her artful Swain</L>
<L>But counterfeited Age and Pain,</L>
<L>To hide his cold declining Passion,</L>
<L>His Want of Love and Inclination;</L>
<L>For <HI>Chloe</HI>'s Face, so often seen,</L>
<L>Put her poor <HI>Strephon</HI> in the Spleen;</L>
<L>Nor could her Wit, or Neatness please him,</L>
<L>Or all her Smiles or Prattle raise him:</L>
<L>He left the pensive Nymph alone,</L>
<L>His painful Absence to bemoan.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L><HI>Strephon</HI> beware, lest in return,</L>
<L>With a new Flame your <HI>Chloe</HI> burn;</L>
<L>Consider I have <HI>Sp—n—r</HI> seen,</L>
<L>And quickly lay aside your Spleen;</L>
<L>Or, by the God of Verse, I vow,</L>
<L>With Antlers I'll adorn your Brow;</L>
<L>No City Knight shall boast a Pair</L>
<L>More large, more branching, or more fair:</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="39"/>Their Horns are gilt, but yours shall
be</L>
<L>As naked as a blasted Tree.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>So, Sir, no more of your Deception,</L>
<L>For I am blest with quick Perception;</L>
<L><HI>Phoebus</HI> has given me piercing Eyes,</L>
<L>To look thro' Falshood and Disguise;</L>
<L>Then lay aside this little Art,</L>
<L>I have, and I will keep your Heart.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>His Grace was very well pleased with my Gaity, and undertook to
deliver the Letter himself; so we parted, each of us, I believe,
satisfied with ourselves, and our own Conduct.</P>
<P>I know at least I was; for upon calling my Heart to account for
the Trouble it had given me, I found by the Symptoms, there was something
very like Love had seized it.</P>
<P>The Colonel came in the Morning, and brought with him Mr.
<HI>Tr—v—r,</HI> Brother to the D—ss of
<HI>M—lb—gh,</HI> whom he introduced to me, and then merrily
asked me, if I was going to re∣ward his constant tender Flame, with a 
<PB N="33" REF="40"/> great staring Pair of Horns? I told him he deserved
them for his ill Temper; but, however, as he made me full amends by the Honour
of making me known to so great and good a Man as he had recom∣mended me to, I
would take some Time to consider of the Matter.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tr—v—r</HI> desired to know which of the
<HI>Sp—n—r</HI>'s it was, I threatned the Colonel with? I told him,
I wrote any thing by way of Amusement; but either of them would serve my
Turn.</P>
<P>The Colonel called me a merry Madcap; Mr.
<HI>Tr—v—r</HI> assured me, he was at my Service, and would
hornisy the Colonel whenever I pleased. I told him, I was ob∣liged to him
for his kind Offer, and would certainly apply to him, if I found myself in
any Distress; and in the mean Time, I hoped, as an earnest of his future
Favour, he would be so kind as to subscribe to my Poems, which
accordingly he did.</P>
<P>My Readers may now imagine, I was in a fair Way of growing rich;
but, in∣deed, it was far otherwise, as I paid a Gui∣nea a Week for my
Lodging, kept a Ser∣vant, <PB N="34" REF="41"/> was under a Necessity of
being always dressed, and had besides so many distressed
Persons of my own Country, who did me the Honour to take a Dinner with me,
and, in return for my Easiness, said every thing of me which they thought
could injure, or expose me; that being naturally liberal, and, till I
heartily suffered for my Folly, no very great Oeconomist, I rather ran out
than saved.</P>
<P>And, as I have thrown some Sort of Reflection on the
<HI>English,</HI> I must beg leave to be equally free with my own Country
Folks. Take Notice, I except the Nobility and Gentry of each Kingdom, who, I
real∣ly believe, in Honour, Valour, or Genero∣sity of Spirit, are not be
matched in any Part of the habitable Globe. Yet, partial as I may be to my
native Country, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> seem to have
different Characteristics: The lower Part of the People of <HI>England</HI>
are blunt and honest; the lower Part of the People of <HI>Ireland,</HI> civil
and deceitful: Nor did I ever suffer in <HI>England,</HI> either in point of
Fortune or <PB N="35" REF="42"/> Reputation, but either by the Thefts, or the
Tongues of the <HI>Irish.</HI></P>
<P>My Landlady came up one Morning very chearful, and told me her
Daughter's Husband, Dr. <HI>T—rn—ll,</HI> who had not been to
see her for two Years, on account of some Difference they had, told her he
would, as he was to preach at <HI>St. James</HI>'s Chapel next Day, (being one
of the Chap∣lains to his Royal Highness the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>) take up
his Lodging in her House that Night. I congratulated hereupon it; but
observing by her Looks that she was under some Uneasiness, I asked
her the Cause of it; after some Hesitation, and a Number of Apologies,
she told me, she had no Accommodation for him, but by giving him her own
Bed, and begged I would, for a Night, give her leave to sleep with me and my
Maid, to which I readily con∣sented; but recollecting what a miserable Bed
she had, in a dark Closet, very unfit for a Gentleman to lie in, I told
her, I would, with great Pleasure, leave my A∣partment for the Doctor, which
was, as may be presumed by the Price, a genteel <PB N="36" REF="43"/> one, and
for a Night take up my Resi∣dence with her. She seemed overjoyed at the
Proposal, and as I had some little Trifle to buy, I went out, and did not
return till about Six in the Evening; so not meeting any body in the Way
below Stairs, I went up to my own Apartment, where I found the Doctor reading,
and the old Gentle∣woman fast asleep.</P>
<P>I begged pardon for my Intrusion, and the old Dame told him how
much he was indebted to my Complaisance in quitting my Apartment to oblige
him with it. I could have wished, she had been silent in this particular;
for as she had not apprized him of it before, he was too polite to suffer
it, nor could any Entreaties of mine prevail on him to accept my Offer.</P>
<P>Presently after, being gone down Stairs, he sent his
Compliments up, and begged I would lend him a Book to amuse him∣self till
Bed-time, so being willing to cul∣tivate the good Opinion he seemed to have
conceived of me, I sent him my own Po∣ems in Manuscript, which, pardon my
Vanity, did not fail to confirm it.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="44"/>The next Day, which was <HI>Sunday,</HI> as
soon as Afternoon Service was over, he very kindly paid me a Visit, and
seemed so well pleased with my Prattle, that it was Midnight before
either of us thought of Repose: But I do assure my Readers his
Mother-in-law kept us Company.</P>
<P>He entertained me with an Account of whatever he had met with
curious in his Travels: His Remarks on every Subject were delivered with
Modesty and Judgment, in a flowing and elegant Style. He was so kind to
promise me the Favour of taking a Dish of Coffee with me in the Morning,
which produced a merry Adventure.</P>
<P>The Noblemen at <HI>White</HI>'s, having heard that I was married
to a Clergyman, and seeing one walking to and fro in my Din∣ing-room,
supposed it must be the very identical Parson, and that he was come to
make up Matters with me; so none of them would venture over, lest it
should incur his Displeasure against me; but Colonel
<HI>D—nc—be,</HI> whose Curiosity was up, re∣solved at a
Distance to reconnoitre the <PB N="38" REF="45"/> Ground, and bring them a
faithful Account of the Enemy's Situation, for so he stiled the
Parson.</P>
<P>There was a very grand Milliner's Shop next Door to my Lodging,
from whence I received a Message, that a Lady, just come from
<HI>Ireland,</HI> desired to speak with me; upon which I immediately went,
full of Hope to receive some Account of my Children: I there found the
Colonel, who told me, he was the Lady; and, with his usual Gaity, added, that
if I questioned his Sex, I need but permit him to be my Bedfellow for a Week,
and I should never know any thing to the contrary.</P>
<P>I answered, I really believed him; in∣asmuch as I had known a
Gentleman, young enough to be his Grandson, who had lived with me in all the
peacable Innocence of a Man of Threescore, like a civil careless Husband,
as he was.</P>
<P>As the Colonel was acquainted with my History, he laughed
heartily, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"He must be some damned Parson, for nobody
(said he) but one belonging to <PB N="39" REF="46"/> the Church could have had
half that Continency. But, my dear little one, (for that was the Name he always
called me), I have some News to tell you; I desire you may brush up your
Counte∣nance, your Fire, and yourself, because you are likely to have
some very grand Visitors to-morrow; no less than Mr.
<HI>St—h—e,</HI> the Earl of <HI>W—nch—ea,</HI> and his
Brother Mr. <HI>F—ch.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The Colonel then told me the Reason of his sending for me in
that manner was, that he had observed a Pason walking in my Room; and
asked, who it was? I told him, it was Dr. <HI>T—bull,</HI> no way
re∣lated to me.</P>
<P>As this Adventure with the Clergyman afforded great Matter of
Diversion at <HI>White</HI>'s, I cannot help here relating ano∣ther. I was in
very great Distress, and was advised to apply to the then Lord
Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> now, by the Grace of God, Lord Archbishop of
<HI>Canterbury</HI>; I say, by the Grace of God, because I be∣lieve he
never was yet excelled by any of the primitive Bishops; a Person, in whom 
<PB N="40" REF="47"/> the Beauty of Holiness fully appears. I went to his
House, in <HI>Kensington-square,</HI> and, to my infinite Surprize, had
free Ac∣cess to his Grace, without even a Question being asked: I
presented him with the fol∣lowing Lines.</P>
<P>This Poem was written just at the Begin∣ning of the Rebellion,
in which his Grace, like a true Son of the Church militant, had nobly taken up
Arms in the Defence of Liberty, Property, and the Protestant Reli∣gion.</P>
<P>Having been obliged to the Right Ho∣nourable <HI>Henry
Pelham,</HI> I thought it not improper to include two such great and eminent
Persons in one Poem, which was as follows: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To his Grace the Lord Archbishop of
<HI>YORK.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AS God, who now does, as in Times of old,</L>
<L>His high Behests to righteous Men unfold;</L>
<L>And from thick Mists, purging the visual Ray,</L>
<L>Beams on his chosen Sons celestial Day;</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="48"/>Late to the pious Prelate, YORK,
re∣veal'd,</L>
<L>What from the Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> lay con∣ceal'd;</L>
<L>The Many, flown with Insolence and Wine,</L>
<L>Unfit, such Ears, to hear of Things Di∣vine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold, oh chosen Messenger of Grace!</L>
<L>Said God, the Wickedness of human Race!</L>
<L><HI>Britain,</HI> behold, my once-lov'd fav'rite
Isle,</L>
<L>Lo, all Impurities her Face defile!</L>
<L>Why are there Pray'rs, or public Fasts proclaim'd?</L>
<L>My Pow'r is mock'd at, and my Word blasphem'd;</L>
<L>Think they, vile Worms! with Arts, or glossing
Lines,</L>
<L>To 'scape my Vengeance, or deceive my Eyes?</L>
<L>No; as to Idol Lusts their Bodies bow,</L>
<L>So shall their Limbs the foreign Fields be∣strew,</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="49"/>Nay, ev'n the proud Metropolis,
shall feel</L>
<L>The red-hot Vengeance, and the mur∣d'rous Steel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, holy YORK, the Lord of Life bespoke:</L>
<L>Oh, gracious God! this dread Decree re∣voke;</L>
<L>Wilt Thou, with Wisdom, Justice, Mercy crown'd,</L>
<L>Alike the Virtuous and the Vile con∣found?</L>
<L>Twenty, perhaps, in <HI>Britain</HI> may'st Thou
find,</L>
<L>Who keep thy Laws, and write them on their Mind;</L>
<L>All, sure, shall perish, by thy mighty Word,</L>
<L>But wilt Thou speak in Wrath?—far be it from Thee,
Lord.</L>
<L>To him, JEHOVAH: By Myself, I swear,</L>
<L>For Twenty's Sake, the Kingdom will I spare.</L>
<L>Oh, be not angry, while I plead again,</L>
<L>Perhaps not Twenty may be found, but Ten;</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="50"/>Ten Men, whom no Temptation can
sub∣due,</L>
<L>True to Religion, to it's Altars true.</L>
<L>To him, JEHOVAH: As thy Soul doth live,</L>
<L>Find me but One, and <HI>England</HI> I forgive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>View then, oh Lord! yon Minister of State,</L>
<L>See him, in ev'ry Action Good and Great;</L>
<L>Stemming Corruption with an out∣stretch'd Hand;</L>
<L>Who, but Himself, the Torrent can withstand?</L>
<L>See Him, like <HI>Nile,</HI> diffusing Bounty round,</L>
<L>To bless a barren, an ungrateful Ground;</L>
<L>Thro' various Channels, Pleasure to impart,</L>
<L>To raise the Fall'n, to chear the dying Heart;</L>
<L>Too oft, alas! in the translucent Wave</L>
<L>Do Crocodiles and wily Serpents lave,</L>
<L>Studious to poison the delightful Stream,</L>

<P>I told the Servant, when I delivered them, it was not a Petition:
He said, if it were, his Grace never refused one; and shewed me into a
handsome Drawing-Room. In a few Minutes, his Grace en∣tered, with a sweet
and placid Air; but looked so young, that I never once ima∣gined him to be
the Archbishop, having joined the associate Idea of Wrinkles, Ava∣rice,
and Pride, to that Title,—in which I found myself, happily for once,
mista∣ken. As it was early in the Morning, he <PB N="45" REF="52"/> said, he
was sure I had not breakfasted, and bid one of the Servants bring some
Tea, and desire his Cousin to come, and keep the Lady Company: As it was
near half an Hour before I saw her, his Grace asked me, who I was? I
answered, which was Truth, I was a Gentleman's Daugh∣ter, of the Kingdom of
<HI>Ireland</HI>; that I had, when I was very young, been married to a
Clergyman; that I had three Children living. His Grace, taking it for granted,
that I was a Widow, which Mistake it was, by no Means, my Interest to clear
up, demanded of me, what I had to sup∣port us? I answered, Nothing but
Po∣etry. He said, that was a Pity; because, let it be ever so excellent,
Genius was sel∣dom rewarded, or encouraged; I very gayly repeated the Dean's
Lines: 
<Q> 
<L>What Hope of Custom in the Fair,</L> 
<L>When not a Soul demands the Ware?</L> 
<L>When you have nothing to produce,</L> 
<L>For private Life, or public Use.</L> 
<BIBL>Swift's Rhapsody.</BIBL></Q> <PB N="46" REF="53"/> His
Grace could not avoid smiling, as he plainly perceived by the Chearfulness,
and Freedom of my Behaviour, and by my only saying, Sir, to him, that I was
igno∣rant of his Dignity. But the Entrance of his Relation, a well-bred Lady,
of about fifty Years of Age, who, as his Grace is a Batchelor, managed his
domestic Affairs, threw me into inconceivable Confusion, as I then plainly
perceived I had been very familiarly chatting with so great a Man.</P>
<P>I made my Apology in the best Man∣ner I could; and, as he was
truly sensible that I neither intended or meant Disre∣spect to him, he
easily pardoned me: But, as we drank Tea, said, he wished my Mistake
had but continued a little longer, that he might have had the Pleasure of
hearing me unawed and uncontrolled. I own I was quite abashed at so odd a
Cir∣cumstance, for while I imagined his Grace to be perhaps a Chaplain to the
Lord Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> I said any thing without Reserve; but,
of a sudden, found my Spirits fail, which brought <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s
Lines into my Mind: 
<Q><PB N="47" REF="54"/> 
<L>And what have Kings, that Privates have not too,</L> 
<L>Save Ceremony, general Ceremony?</L> 
<L>And what are thou, thou Idol Ceremony?</L> 
<L>What kind of God art thou, that sufferest more</L> 
<L>Of mortal Griefs, than do thy Worship∣pers;</L> 
<L>What are thy Rents? What are thy Comings in?</L> 
<L>Oh Ceremony! shew me but thy Worth:</L> 
<L>What is thy Soul of Adoration?</L> 
<L>Art thou aught else, but Place, Degree, and Form;</L> 
<L>Creating Fear and Awe in other Men?</L> 
<L>Wherein thou art less happy, being fear'd,</L> 
<L>Than they in fearing thee.</L></Q> His Grace was so humane,
to make me a handsome Present at my Departure, and assured me, he would
always be a Friend to me.</P>
<P>However, I did not make a second Ap∣plication to him, 'till
such Time as the Royal Bounty is to be petitioned for, <PB N="48" REF="55"/>
is at <HI>Christmas,</HI> though it is not distributed 'till
<HI>Easter.</HI> As I knew, at that Season of the Year, it was
impossible for me to be at <HI>Kensington,</HI> e'er his Grace would be
at <HI>Westminster,</HI> I waited at the Door of the Robing-Room, 'till I
was almost frozen, holding a Petition, inclosed in a Letter, in my Hand; a
Gentleman, who is Door-keeper to the House of Lords, taking Compassion on
me, told me, I had better come into the Lobby, an Offer I readily accepted of,
and sat down in a Window: There were several Noblemen, most of whom knew
me by Sight, walking in it, as the House was not yet met. The first Prelate
who entered, was the Lord Bishop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> a venerable Gentleman,
whose graceful grey Hairs the Hand of Time had silvered: As he past by, I
made him a Courtesy, on which he stopt, and, with great Civility, asked
me if that Letter was for him; I answered, it was for his Grace of
<HI>York</HI>; on which, he very kindly wished me Success. His Grace next
entered, and with his wonted Goodness asked me, where I had been? Adding,
that it had <PB N="49" REF="56"/> been a great Loss to me, that he did not
know where to find me; and accepting of my Letter, said, he hoped I had there
given him a proper Direction; so bowing, as fast as I courtesied, he went
to take his Seat at the Right Hand of that Power he had so nobly supported;
and, no doubt, will, at the last great Day, having truly approved himself
<HI>Christ</HI>'s faithful Soldier and Champion, fighting under the sacred
Banners of the Captain of his Salvation, hear those comfortable Words,
<HI>Well done, thou good and faithful Servant, enter thou into the Joy of thy
Lord.</HI></P>
<P>As the Earl of <HI>Ch—ster—ld</HI> heard every Word
his Grace spoke to me, he made himself very merry at <HI>White</HI>'s,
telling Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and Colonel <HI>D—nc—be,</HI> that I
was true to the Gown, and delivered a Billet-doux to the handsomest,
politest, and bravest Prelate in <HI>Europe</HI>; that I had given him a
Direction where to find me, and highly applauded my Choice.</P>
<P>But no Virtue is above the Reach of a little pleasant Raillery;
and as some of the Noblemen demanded an Explanation <PB N="50" REF="57"/> of
this Affair, I with my usual Sincerity, told them the Truth; on which they
all agreed in praising his Beneficence and Af∣fability, and the handsome
Manner in which he bestowed his Bounties.</P>
<P>I hope, if these <HI>Memoirs</HI> should ever fall into his
Grace's Hands, who is an uni∣versal Reader, he will pardon me for using his
Name, which I shall never do, but with the utmost Respect and
Gratitude.</P>
<P>As I had imagined his Grace to be Lord High Almoner, I
addressed him as such, and waited on him again at
<HI>West∣minster</HI>; his Grace told me, the B—p of
<HI>S—y</HI> had been so kind to accept of my Petition, and that I
must wait on him the next Morning, at his House in the <HI>Temple:</HI> So
accordingly, I went, in full Spirits, imagining, on the Recommenda∣tion of so
excellent a Person, I should both have a civil Reception, and also my
Desire answered.</P>
<P>It snowed very fast, and I knocked se∣veral Times, e'er I
could gain Admis∣sion; at length, an old Porter ventured to turn the
unoiled Hinges a little, which <PB N="51" REF="58"/> grated very harshly, and
seemed to par∣take of the Spirit of their unhospitable Master, who,
according to my Country∣man's Bull, opened the Door to keep the People out, for
this was fully verified here; he asked me, what I knocked so often for? and
being, I suppose, doubtful that I might steal one of the Oak Chairs in
the Hall, shut it again in my Face; the Inclemency of the Air, and the
Vexa∣tion of my Mind, made me give a thun∣dering Rap, the Door was once more
opened, and I assured the Porter, if he would be so kind as to deliver
that Letter for me to his Lord, to whom I was re∣commended by his Grace of
<HI>York,</HI> I would give him Half a Crown, which Promise of a Perquisite
softened him into Consent, for, as Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> observes, 
<Q> 
<L>This Reason with all is prevailing.</L></Q></P>
<P>He took the Letter into the Parlour, when presently an old Man,
with a most unprelatical Countenance, for it was full of Carbunckles, and
Knobs, and Flames of <PB N="52" REF="59"/> Fire, came out, with my Letter in his
Hand, and, with an imperious Voice, de∣manded of me, whether I wrote it? As the
Times were full of Violence and Blood, it being, as I observed, at the
Beginning of the late Rebellion, I stood confounded, and knew not what
Answer to make; which he observing, asked me, was my Name <HI>Meade?</HI>
To which, an∣swering in the affirmative, he cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Yow are a Foreigner, and we have Beggars enow of
our own:"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord, returned I, I was born in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> which is not a foreign Country, but equally a Part of his
Majesty's Dominions with <HI>Great-Britain:</HI>"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Why, said he very politely, you lye; but as you
say yow are in Distress, there's Half a Crown for yow:"</Q> I thanked his
Lordship, and turning to the Porter told him, as I had given him some
Trouble, I hoped he would accept of that Part of the Royal Bounty, which had
been promised to me; his Lordship was pleased to tell me, I was a
saucy, proud, impertinent Person; which, <PB N="53" REF="60"/> having
neither any farther Hopes or Fears about him, I little regarded.</P>
<P>All the Way Home, as cold as it was, and as much vexed as I was at
the old Br—te's Behaviour, I could not avoid laughing at his odd Figure,
so much re∣sembling that of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Friar, where 
<Q>His great Belly swaggered in State before him, and his little
gouty Legs came limping after; oh, he is a huge Tun of Divinity! and were he
any way given to Holiness, I would swear by his Face; my Oath should be,
By this Fire; but he is indeed, but for the Fire in his Face, the Son of utter
Dark∣ness; oh! he is a perpetual Triumph, an everlasting Bonsire!</Q></P>
<P>Then again I thought of Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s Lines: 
<Q> 
<L>G—d d—n me, they bid us reform and repent;</L> 
<L>But, Z—ds, by their Looks, they never keep
<HI>Lent.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="61"/>I hope the Reader will pardon me, for
inserting Oaths, as I have so great an Au∣thority to quote for them.</P>
<P>As the Parliament did not sit during the Holydays, I waited on
his Grace of <HI>York,</HI> who immediately gave me Audience: He asked me,
what Success I had with the Lord Almoner; and as I had sped mar∣vellous
ill-favouredly, I related every Cir∣cumstance, as near as I could remember of
our Conversation; One, in particu∣lar, which I before omitted, and was, that
he said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Would the Lord Arch∣bishop of <HI>York</HI>
speak to yow, Woman?"</Q> His Grace smiled, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"It was the first Time he ever learned it was
beneath the Dignity of a Bishop to speak, even to a Beggar; as Humliity was
their best Orna∣ment:—Well, What more?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Not much, my Lord, only he demanded, If I knew no
other Person, besides your Grace, to recommend me to him? And as I really
was convinced, I had brought him my Credentials from the highest, I did not
use any other Name:"</Q> <PB N="55" REF="62"/> By this Time the Lady
before-mentioned came to Breakfast, and I was obliged to relate the Story to
her; they both laughed,—and his Grace assured me, the B—p of
<HI>S—y</HI> was a very honest Man;—I told him, 
<Q REND="inline">"I did not suspect him to be a Pick-pocket;
but that I looked on that to be but a very moderate Praise, where every other
social and Christian Virtue was required:"</Q> He said, I made nice
Dis∣tinctions; but he himself would take Care of the Affair, and so he
put a couple of Guineas into my Hand, on which, I said, 
<Q REND="inline">"God Almighty bless your Grace;"</Q> which again
made him smile, and myself also, on Reflection, that, instead of
im∣ploring his Blessing, I had given him mine. I returned to
<HI>London,</HI> as I ought also from this long Digression, to relate
what passed between me, and the Noble∣men, whom Colonel
<HI>D—nc—be</HI> said would come and visit me.</P>
<P>When I expected three, but one came, a very old gouty Gentleman,
whose Name I do not think proper to insert; the rest <PB N="56" REF="63"/>
had intended me the same Favour; but he insisted, it seems, on coming
alone, which, after a little Raillery, they per∣mitted him to do; but
protested, that if he stayed long, they would follow him;—though our
Conversation was entirely about indifferent Matters, during an Hour he
stayed with me, yet he and I were as heartily b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tered, and I had as many Ex∣minations about his
Behaviour to me, as if he had been a young, gay, gallant Gen∣tleman; the
Reason of which was, that he used to reprove others for their
In∣temperance, or Indecency: So they took it into their Heads he was a sly
Sinner, and would have bribed me highly to tell a Lye of him; I assured
them, provided they would but give me leave to inform him of it, I would say
what they pleased; for I was fully of Opinion, that, if a Lye would do me
Grace, he would permit me to gild it with the happiest Terms I had.</P>
<P>They told my Story to the good old Gentleman, who kindly sent me
over three Guineas, by the Hand of my honoured Benefactor Mr.
<HI>Cibber.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="64"/>I was at this Time applied to, by Mr.
<HI>V—ct—r,</HI> to write an Ode on the Princess of
<HI>Wales</HI>'s Birth Day, which, as he kept a Tea-Warehouse in
<HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> near her Court, would, he said, at least, gain him her
Royal Highness's Custom; so to ob∣lige him, as I had really done when he
was in very low Circumstances in <HI>Ireland,</HI> some Years before, I
wrote as follows:

<P>What Success this met, I know not; but Mr.
<HI>V—ct—r</HI> soon after applied to me for a
<HI>Lilliputian</HI> Ode, on the Birth∣day <PB N="60" REF="67"/> of his Royal

<P>I know not what Reward the Gentle∣man got for these, but he gave
me five Shillings; and as since my Return to <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> he was twice

<P>And since, from the Great, I have di∣gressed to the Vulgar;
I cannot forget Dr. <HI>Ow—ns,</HI> whom, at the End of my First
Volume, I promised to record, and scorn to deal in Lyes, as he did. This
pious Divine, who was an intimate Ac∣quaintance of my Father's, gave himself
the Trouble of coming to my Landlord, Mr. <HI>R—ly,</HI> an Officer of
Mace, in <HI>Mi∣chael's-Lane,</HI> a little while after I was parted from my
Husband, together with his Curate, Mr. <HI>R—b—ns—n,</HI>
and, with great Humanity, insisted on his turning me out of the House,
otherwise they would present it: Tne Landlord asked, what I had done?
They answered, I was an ex∣communicated Person,—(a Lye;) that I had
run away from my Husband, (another Lye;)—that since I had left him, I
had seven Bastards,—which was pretty quick, as we had been but
seven Months asunder,—<PB N="77" REF="84"/> (another Lye;)—but
when a Churchman is in for it, he will out-lye the Devil; at length, these
Parsons descended so low, as to threaten to inform, that my Landlord's
Wife was a <HI>Roman,</HI> which I believe, was another Lye; but, whether true,
or false, it was very unbecoming their Characters, either as Gentlemen, or
Christians, to say.</P>
<P>But I was to be insulted at any Rate; for the Clergy hang
together; and if some did, it would be no great Loss.</P>
<P>For when a swinging Sin is to be com∣mitted, there is nothing
like a Gown and a Cassock to cover it.</P>
<P>But once more to return to <HI>Albion.</HI> I had laid out a
Couple of Guineas on a little curious Picture, which I bought to sell again,
but was advised to present it to the Lord Almoner, who, they said, had a
Taste for Painting? He generously ac∣ceepted of my Favour, but neither made
me any Return from his own Bounty, nor his Majesty's; so I had no great
Reason to say, he deserved the Character of an honest Man.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="85"/>On the Change of the Ministry, I wrote the
following Lines: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To the Rt. Hon. <HI>HENRY PELHAM,</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<L>AMIDST contending Parties Strife for Sway,</L>
<L>Eager to rule, reluctant to obey;</L>
<L>How just, how noble, must his Conduct seem!</L>
<L>Whom all unite to honour, and esteem?</L>
<L>This blissful Fate, this Happiness divine,</L>
<L>Has Heaven reserv'd to crown a Life, like Thine;</L>
<L>This the Reward sublimer Virtues claim,</L>
<L>Unenvy'd Honours, and unspotted Fame!</L>
<L>Integrity in fairest Light confess'd,</L>
<L>Lives in the sacred Centre of thy Breast;</L>
<L>Oh, never, never, from her Laws depart!</L>
<L>So, reign, confess'd, the Friend of ev'ry Heart;</L>

<L><PB N="79" REF="86"/>Ev'n restless Faction shall

<L>And only Heav'n thy Happiness increase.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>I shewed these Lines to Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> who liked them
so well, that he undertook to deliver them for me.</P>
<P>The next Morning, early, he did so, and then call'd upon me,
and, giving me five Guineas, asked me, whether I thought them a sufficient
Reward for my Poetry? I told him, I readily did: Well then, said he, Mr.
<HI>Pelham</HI> distinguished thus: 
<Q REND="inline">"There are Five Guineas, for the Lady's Numbers;
and Five more, for the good Advice they contain; and tell her, I hope God will
always give me Grace to follow it."</Q> 
<Q> 
<L>There was a Statesman! when comes such
another?</L></Q></P>
<P>Not seeing Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> for a Fortnight after this
Instance of his Friendship and Humanity, I wrote to him the following
Lines: 
<Q><PB N="80" REF="87"/> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>CIBBER.</HI></HEAD>
<L>SINCE You became so great a Stranger,</L>
<L>My Muse, and Life, have been in Dan∣ger;</L>

<L>As their inspiring, faithful Friend;</L>
<L>And, shou'd your guardian Care decrease,</L>
<L>Their animating Fires must cease;</L>
<L>Since Novelties alone delight you,</L>
<L>I've found a Method to excite you;</L>
<L>A Scheme, untry'd before to move you,</L>
<L>'Tis plainly to confess, I love you;</L>
<L>Now, look not with Surprize, or Cold∣ness,</L>
<L>Nor call this Declaration Boldness;</L>
<L>For mine's a Flame divinely pure,</L>
<L>For ever fitted to endure;</L>
<L>From ev'ry grosser Thought refin'd,</L>
<L>A Love for your accomplish'd Mind.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> sent me Word, he was going to the
Masquerade; but would see me next Day, which gave rise to the follow∣ing
Lines: 
<Q><PB N="81" REF="88"/> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To <HI>COLLEY CIBBER,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<L>CAN now a Masquerade delight you?</L>
<L>What are it's Charms that can invite you?</L>
<L>Have not your Eyes to Age survey'd</L>
<L>The medley World in Masquerade?</L>
<L>Where Friendship's Masque conceals the Knave,</L>
<L>And Cowards wear the Masque of Brave;</L>
<L>The Masque of Love, we frail Ones find</L>
<L>Worn, when our Ruin is design'd;</L>
<L>The Patriot's Masque conceals <HI>Sedition,</HI></L>
<L>And soft Humility's, <HI>Ambition</HI>;</L>
<L>Ev'n you, sometimes, the Masque will wear,</L>
<L>And, what you are not, oft appear;</L>
<L>Rally your Faults with Wit, and Spirit,</L>
<L>And make your Folly masque your Merit:</L>
<L>Come undisguis'd then, come reveal'd</L>
<L>To me, and Truth; let Folly yield,</L>
<L>And leave the Masque to Fools conceal'd.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> received these Lines with his usual
Partiality to me and my Per∣formances.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="89"/>And here, it may not be amiss to give a
particular Character of this Gentleman, as no Man has ever been more
satyrized, or less deserved it.</P>
<P>And, I think, I cannot do it, in a bet∣ter Manner, than I have
used in describing Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>;—that is, to give him to my
Readers in his Words, and Actions, as near as I can recollect them, during the
Time I had the Honour of being known to him: And if the petty Scribblers
should say, that I never knew him, any more than I did the Dean of St.
<HI>Patrick</HI>'s;—why they only take away Merit from me with one Hand,
to give it to me with the other; and must, at least, afford me the Praise
of inventing with Probability: that I have not 
<Q> 
<L>Drawn Bears in Water, Dolphins in the Trees,</L></Q> But am
uniform in my Characters, and 
<Q> 
<L>Paint <HI>Achilles</HI> as <HI>Achilles</HI> was.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="90"/>As I have mentioned a poetical Intro∣duction
to this Gentleman's Favour, I must give a particular Account of his first
Visit: He ran up Stairs with the Vivacity of a Youth of Fifteen, and, making
me a courtly Bow, said, he was sure I did not known him; I answered, 
<Q> 
<L>Not to know him, would argue myself un∣known.</L></Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"And, prithee, said he, why did not you come to
my House the Moment you came to <HI>London?</HI>"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Upon my Word, Sir, that would have been a
modest Proof of <HI>Irish</HI> Assurance; how could I hope for a
Reception?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Pshaw, said he, Merit is a sufficient
Recommendation to me."</Q> I cour∣tesied, and, as we both stood, 
<Q REND="inline">"Sit down, said he, be less ceremonious to be
better bred; come, shew me your Writings."</Q> I obeyed; and, upon his
reading the Poem, called <HI>Sorrow,</HI> he burst into Tears, and was not
assumed to give the flowing Virtue manly Way; he desired a Copy of
it,—which I gave him; <PB N="84" REF="91"/> and now his Curiosity was
raised, to know who I was? I told him, mine was a long, and mournful Story,
unfit for a Soul so humanized as his, 
<Q> 
<L>Where dwelt the pitying Pang, the ten∣der Tear,</L> 
<L>The Sigh for suff'ring Worth, the Wish preferr'd</L> 
<L>For Humankind, the Joy to see them blest,</L> 
<L>And all the social Offspring of the Heart.</L></Q> Mr.
<HI>Cibber</HI> assured me, my fine Compli∣ment should not excuse me;
for he was fully determined to have my History from my own Lips; and
desired I might come and breakfast with him next Morn∣ing, and begin.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I waited on him, and wonderfully was he delighted
with my Account of Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>; he had the Patience to listen to me
three Hours, without ever once interrupting me; a most uncommon Instance of
good Breeding, es∣pecially from a Person of his Years, who 
<PB N="85" REF="92"/> usually dictate to the Company, and en∣gross all the
Talk to themselves: For, as Dr. <HI>Young</HI> observes, 
<Q> 
<L>A Dearth of Words a Woman need not fear;</L> 
<L>But 'tis a Task, indeed, to learn to hear!</L> 
<L>In that the Skill of Conversation lies,</L> 
<L>'Tis that must prove you both polite and wise.</L></Q> And
I do assure my Readers, the Gentle∣man neither yawned, scratched his
Head, beat Tatoo with his Foot, nor used any such ambiguous Giving-out, to
note that he was weary.</P>
<P>So far from it, that tho' he was engaged to dine with the Duke of
<HI>Gr—ft—n,</HI> he had forgot it, 'till his Ser∣vant came in, to
dress him; he strictly charged me to come to him the next Morning, and
set my Spout a going, for so he merrily called my Mouth.</P>
<P>I obeyed his most kind Command; and, by way of Introduction,
told him a <PB N="86" REF="93"/> Story Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> related to me, which
was as follows:</P>
<P>A Gentleman met a Friend in the Street, whom he had not seen for
some Years; he began to give him an Account of what had befallen him, since
their Se∣paration from each other; a Care happened to intervene, upon which,
they took diffe∣rent Streets; seven Years past, and it so befel, they met
just in the same Place, when, without the least Ceremony, he proceeded in
his Story, "And, as I was telling you, said he," <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I was going to proceed, when Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> interrupted me. I
was, said he, at the Duke of <HI>R—chm—nd</HI>'s last. Sum∣mer,
when his Daughter, a most accom∣plished young Lady, and a very early
Ri∣ser, sat reading in a beautiful Portico, about Six in the Morning; I
accosted the fair Creature, and asked her the Subject of her Contemplation?
So in a most ele∣gant, and agreeable Stile, she related to me Part of a
very entertaining Novel, she held in her Hand, and, I believe, in bet∣ter
Words than the Author wrote it. A <PB N="87" REF="94"/> Summons to Breakfast
broke off her most agreeable Narration.</P>
<P>The next Morning I saw the Charmer in the same Portico, who
took up the Story at the very Word she had broke off, and concluded it.</P>
<P>As <HI>Ireland</HI> is now graced with this illus∣trious Fair
One, in whom Virtue, Beauty, Modesty, Taste, and every Excellence unite, I
hope for her Pardon, for presu∣ming to mention her.</P>
<P>And tho', as she will soon see her no∣ble Father was a
beneficent Patron to me; I hate Flattery so much, that I would not, on that
Account, pay her a Compliment beyond what was due to her elevated Sta∣tion, did
not her superior Virtues command it.</P>
<P>Never yet were seen a more tender, or a more lovely Pair than
the Duke and Dutchess of <HI>Richmond,</HI> with their bloom∣ing Progeny,
like new-blown Roses, smi∣ling around them; an Instance, Wedlock may be
happy, even among the Great, when mutual Love, and mutual Honour join. 
<Q><PB N="88" REF="95"/> 
<L>Here Love his golden Shafts employs, here lights</L> 
<L>His constant Lamp, and waves his pur∣ple Wings;</L> 
<L>Reigns here, and revels!</L></Q></P>
<P>And, it is with infinite Pleasure I learn, that Lord and Lady
<HI>Kildare</HI> are as great an Example in conjugal Fidelity, Piety, and
Generosity, as their noble Parents.</P>
<P>This Digression, I am certain, will be excused.</P>
<P>I went on with my Story to Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> who, at last, in
flowing Spirits, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Z—ds! write it out, just as you re∣late
it, and, I'll engage it will fell."</Q></P>
<P>Every Poem, as I occasionally introdu∣ced them, he made me give
him a Copy of, and communicated them to the Earl of <HI>Chesterfield,</HI>
who positively insisted on it, that I must understand <HI>Greek,</HI>
and <HI>Latin,</HI> otherwise I never could write <HI>English</HI> so
well. Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> said, he had not enquired, but that he would that
Mo∣ment: And, accordingly, came, and told <PB N="89" REF="96"/> me, what my Lord
had said; I assured him, I was ignorant of every Language, except my
Mother-tongue; but that if he would be so kind to present my Respects to
his Lordship, and let him know, that Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> had taught me
<HI>English,</HI> I was certain, he would allow, I had an excel∣lent Tutor;
to which his Lordship readily acquiesced.</P>
<P>But, alas! though my Honours were very great, my Profits were very
small. The dismal Return of Summer, for so it was to me, robbed me of
every Friend; and, as I could not take up with mean Company, I was as
solitary in <HI>London</HI> as the Pelican in the Wilderness. I acquainted
Dr. <HI>T—rnbull</HI> with my melancholy Situ∣ation, and prevailed on him
to write to Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> to remit to me what was due, on the
Agreement between us. About ten Days after, the Post-man brought a Letter,
marked from <HI>Dublin,</HI> to the Doctor; he happened to be at
<HI>Ken∣sington,</HI> so I paid for it; and knowing he had no Acquaintance
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> I ven∣tured <PB N="90" REF="97"/> to open it; it was wrote
in a Text-Hand, the Contents of it were as follow: 
<LETTER>

<P>IN the Absence of my Client, Mr. <HI>P—,</HI> I

not his Wife, nor has he any thing to say to the infamous Wretch; she fled
from <HI>Ireland,</HI> where she ought to have been executed, for kill∣ing
her Father, three of her Bastards, and poisoning her Husband. It does not
be∣come a Clergyman to countenance a com∣mon Prostitute; if she owes you
any Money, you may put her in Jail; for I do assure you, it will never be
paid by Mr. <HI>P—n.</HI></P>
<CLOSER>

</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="98"/>Could one believe that any thing less than
infernal Malice could have forged such an Accusation against an innocent
Person? My very Blood thrilled with Horror, to think there could be such a

<L>For nothing can he to Damnation add,</L> 
<L>Greater than this.</L></Q></P>
<P>Tho' I was far from the least Appre∣sion that the evil Facts I
was charged with, as to killing all my Family, would meet with any Credit; yet
Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s denying me to be his Wife, and the De∣claration that I
was not intitled to any thing from him might hurt mine; I sup∣pressed the
Letter for a Day or two, 'till learning, by Accident, that the Lord Bi∣shop
of <HI>Kilmore,</HI> now Lord Archbishop of <PB N="92" REF="99"/>
<HI>Tuam</HI> (to whose Family my Father had the Honour of being Physician,
and to whose Humanity I am infinitely indebted, which, with the utmost
Respect, and Gratitude, I take this public Opportunity of acknow∣ledging) was
in <HI>London</HI>; I took the Li∣berty of addressing myself to him, as
the Daughter of a Gentleman, whom I was sensible his Lordship regarded;
my Ap∣plication was not in vain, for though he that Day set out for
<HI>Ireland,</HI> he not only sent me a handsome Present, but gave it in
so genteel, so polite a Manner, with his Compliments, that it added tenfold
Weight to his Favour.</P>
<P>When my Lord's Gentleman came to me, Providence so ordered, that
Dr. <HI>T—bull</HI> was drinking Coffee with me, and upon this
Encouragement of a Prelate's taking Compassion on my lost Estate; I
ventured to communicate to him Mr. <HI>Walsh</HI>'s Letter; the Doctor lifted
up his Hands and Eyes to Heaven, and seemed as much shocked at the
Perfidiousness of the Wretch, as I had been; for whoever wrote the Letter,
it was certainly done by <PB N="93" REF="100"/> Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s
Direction; but no Won∣der, when he had sworn I was dead, and was actually
married to another, he tried every Method to destroy me. And, to convince the
World, I do not wrong him, I here present them with a Letter I re∣ceived from
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and communicated to the present Primate, who knows it was
not a forged, but a genuine One.</P>

lately come from <HI>London,</HI> that he saw you, that you were very well,
and lived in <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Street.</HI></P>
<P>The Cause of my Writing to you may seem odd, but this it
is.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> has, for some Time past, paid his
Addresses to a young Lady, who is the Daughter of my most intimate 
<PB N="94" REF="101"/> Friend, to whom I have often heard him, with repeated
Oaths, not only confirm your Death, but that also of his two younger
Children—the latter is already found to be a base Falsehood; and
should it appear that he has attempted to impose a greater on us, there is
no Penalty the Law can inflict, which he shall not suf∣fer, nor shall my
Resentment ever lessen or abate, as he has justly merited it.</P>
<P>I beg, Madam, if you yet exist, you will favour me with an
Answer, and let me know whether there were any Terms of Agreement between you
and Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> on your Separation; and be assured neither
Money nor Friends shall be wanting to support your Interest; and though I
have not the Pleasure of being known to you, you will find a real Friend
in</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="95" REF="102"/>I answered this Letter the Moment I
re∣ceived it, which was three Weeks after the Date, and never heard of the
Gentle∣man more, nor know I whether he exists, or not.</P>
<P>And as Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> has, since my Return to
<HI>Ireland,</HI> accused me of at∣tempting to injure him with the Primates,
as he stiles them; I fairly own I sent Mr. <HI>Walsh</HI>'s Letter to the
late Lord Primate <HI>Hoadly,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Letter to the
present Lord Primate, (who, as he says in his most stupid Epistle,
scorned to counte∣nance me;) and gave him my Letter, and my List of
Subscribers also, with full Power to do to them what he pleased: And,
truly Mr. Parson, so do I; but if nei∣ther the Lord Lieutenant, nor any of
the principal Persons of Distinction in this Kingdom, who have honoured me
with their Regard, should be willing to bear an Insult from you, how can
you help your∣self? Why, Man, we are in a Protestant Country, and disdain
to be Priest-ridden.</P>
<P>Finding myself unable to pay so high a Rent as I stood at, I
discharged my <PB N="96" REF="103"/> Lodging and Servant, and went to board
and lodge at a very genteel House in <HI>Green-street,
Grosvenor-Square</HI>; my Land∣lord was Valet de Chambre to the Earl of
<HI>Stair,</HI> and his Wife a top Laundress, which, in <HI>London,</HI> is a
very profitable Employment.</P>
<P>As she washed for several Persons of Distinction, she
used, on a <HI>Sunday,</HI> to in∣vite the Head-Servants of Noblemen's
Fa∣milies to Dinner, at which, I never took Umbrage; for you are sure from
them to learn every Circumstance relating to their Lords and Ladies; and many
entertaining Stories of their particular Humours and Gallantries, did I learn;
so true is it, that either good or evil Fame proceeds from our Domestics;
and no Wonder, as they have a better Opportunity than the rest of the World,
to watch our unguarded Hours, and comment on our Frailties.</P>
<P>Amongst others, Sir <HI>John Ligonier</HI>'s Gentleman, as they
stiled him, which Name, his generous Master soon after en∣titled him to,
by giving him a Commis∣sion, dined with us; he looked very at∣tentively 
<PB N="97" REF="104"/> at me, and put me into Confu∣sion, by telling my
Landlady, she had, to his Knowledge, a Gentlewoman Lodger.</P>
<P>After Dinner, my Landlord brought in a large Bowl of Punch, Pipes
and Tobacco, upon which I made my <HI>Exit.</HI></P>
<P>I had not long been in my Dressing-Room, which opened into a
very sweet Garden, when Mr. <HI>Parkinson,</HI> for so was this Person
called, followed me. He told me, he hated Drink and Tobacco, and would be
infinitely obliged to me for a Dish of Tea, which, as my Curiosity was
raised by the Words he had let drop at Din∣ner, I readily consented to give
him.</P>
<P>He had, he told me, frequently seen me in
<HI>Stephen's-Green,</HI> and was in <HI>Dublin</HI> at the Time of my
Separation from my Husband, and that Numbers of People la∣mented my hard
Fate. I told him I had not found it so, for that I could not even get what
was due to me from thence, nor an Answer to any Letter I ever wrote.</P>
<P>He then asked me, how I got any Sup∣port; especially, as he
had learned from the Family, that I lived very retired; I in∣genuously 
<PB N="98" REF="105"/> told him, I had no other For∣tune than my Pen, and, at
his Request, shewed him some of my Writings; he told me his Master
delighted in Poetry, and was one of the most generous Gentle∣men living, and
that he was certain, if I applied to him, he would be a Friend to me: I was
easily prevailed on to write to him, to beg he would do me the Honour of
subscribing to me, and sent him such of my Rhymes as I myself had the
best Opinion of. The General wrote me a very polite Answer, and, as he
lived but a few Doors from my Lodging, gave me, the next Evening, the Honour of
a Visit.</P>
<P>This Gentleman is so universally known, beloved, honoured, and
esteemed, that I dare not attempt his Character, being as∣sured my best
Painting would fall infi∣nitely short of the excellent Original. Nor was I at
all surprized that he should be a Fa∣vourite of the Fair, who was adorned
with Honour, Generosity, Valour, and yet even Female Softness, and
Complacency, added to the Charms of a most graceful and majestic
Person.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="106"/>And if in an advanced Age he shone so
brightly, what must he have done in his first Bloom, when 
<Q> 
<L>His kindling Cheeks, with purple Beau∣ties glow'd,</L> 
<L>His lovely sparkling Eyes shot martial Fires;</L> 
<L>Dreadful as <HI>Mars,</HI> and as his <HI>Venus</HI>
charming.</L></Q> I dare say, half the Ladies would have cried out with
<HI>Phoedra.</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>O God-like Form! O Extasy, and Trans∣port!</L></Q></P>
<P>This worthy Gentleman subscribed to me for Twelve Books, and
also engaged the late Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Stair,</HI>
the Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> and several other <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Noblemen, to
do me the same Ho∣nour.</P>
<P>So the Almighty raised me Friends, even in a strange Land; and
proved my Husband, tho' a Priest, no Prophet, who <PB N="100" REF="107"/>
declared I should starve; to which, indeed, his best Endeavours have not
been wanting.</P>
<P>But, he should have remembered the Words of holy <HI>David: I
have been young, and now am old, yet never saw I the Righ∣teous Man
forsaken, nor his Seed begging their Bread.</HI></P>
<P>My dear Father had, by his many good Works, entailed a
Blessing on my honest Endeavours; and as Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> used to
say, when I wrote any thing that pleased him, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Gift of the great God to you, preserves
you;"</Q> which, as I never sold, nor prostituted it to unworthy Ends, I
humbly hope his Mercy will afford to me, as long as I have any Being.</P>
<P>This timely Assistance enabled me not only to live, but to
pursue my writing, which no Person can ever do well, while their Minds are,
like <HI>Martha</HI>'s, troubled with many Things.</P>
<P>A few Days after this, a very genteel pretty Woman, took a Lodging
in the same House with me: She was with Child, and her Husband was, as
she said, a Lawyer, and was gone the Circuit; so <PB N="101" REF="108"/>
finding the City not agree with her, she moved to better Air. As she had
very good Furniture, my Landlady made no Scruple to accept of her without
farther Enquiry; and I was well pleased to think, I should have an
agreeable Companion.</P>
<P>Her Manner of Life greatly surprized me; for, in two Months
Time, she never once went abroad, nor did any human Creature come to visit
her.</P>
<P>At length, about two o'Clock one Morning, a Gentleman came, who,
she she said, was her Husband; she let him in herself, and he left
her early in the Morning, so that none of the Family saw him; he repeated
his nocturnal Visits seve∣ral Times, after the same Manner, in the Dead
still, and Middle of the Night, which appeared to me rather to wear the Face
of an Amour, than lawful Matri∣mony.</P>
<P>At length, the Gentleman failed in his Attendance, and the Lady
said, he was gone into the Country. 
<Q><PB N="102" REF="109"/> 
<L>The Nightly Knocking at the Door did cease,</L> 
<L>The noiseless Hammer rusted there in Peace.</L></Q> Some
Weeks past over without either a Message, or a Letter, coming from the
supposed Husband, upon which she fell into a deep Melancholy; which,
though she seemed to attribute to her Apprehen∣sion of the approaching
Hour, I could ea∣sily perceive had some more secret and latent
Cause.</P>
<P>And as in my Life I had never seen a more retired, or modest
Person, I had the utmost Compassion for her, and judged, if she was
among the Number of the Unfor∣tunate, some uncommon Villainy had been
practised against her.</P>
<P>As we were very intimate, I frequently surprized her in Tears;
and, at last, I ventured to beg her to acquaint me with the Cause of her
Affliction, assuring her, it was not an impertinent Female Curiosity
which urged me on, but a real Desire to <PB N="103" REF="110"/> be
serviceable to her, which, perhaps, by some Means or other, Providence
might point out.</P>
<P>She burst into Tears, and fondly em∣bracing me, told me, she
wanted a Friend to unbosom herself to, and added, that if I would be her
Bedfellow that Night, she would relate to me her unhappy Story.</P>
<P>Wished for Night came, and my fair Friend kept her
Promise.</P>
<P>I am, said she, the Daughter of an emi∣nent Merchant, who by
his extraordinary good Nature, in being Surety for others, hospitable Spirit,
and very great Losses at Sea, was obliged to live in a more narrow
Compass than suited the Generosity of his Mind; my Mother dying when I
was but twelve Years of Age, my Father made me Mistress of the House,
which he said would teach me to be an Oeconomist, and to know how to govern
one of my own. When I was about fourteen Years of Age, a wealthy Packer, a very
handsome Man, courted me; my Father ingenuously told him, he could give him
but five hun∣dred <PB N="104" REF="111"/> Pounds, with which, if he was
satis∣fied, and, that I had no Objection to it, he should be very glad to
have him for a Son-in-law.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H—rn—l,</HI> for so was he called,
assured him he would gladly take me without a Portion, but my Father
insisted on his Acceptance of it, as it would help to furnish a
House.</P>
<P>Whatever may be thought at <HI>St. James</HI>'s, these who
converse with the Traders of <HI>London,</HI> will find, they neither want
Sense nor Politeness; and I liked Mr. <HI>H—l</HI> so well, that I
was very glad of being so happily disposed of.</P>
<P>My Husband took a House commo∣dious for his Business, and
for four Years, during which Time I had four Children, we lived in great
Harmony.</P>
<P>But, in the mean Time, I had the Mis∣fortune of losing my dear
Father, who lest the little Remainder of his Fortune, as a Portion for my
younger Sister, and ap∣pointed my Husband to be her Guardian.</P>
<P>One Day he told me, he was afraid he should not be able to keep
such good <PB N="105" REF="112"/> Hours as he had done, being chosen a
Member of the Philosophic Club; in which were many Gentlemen of
Distinc∣tion, whose Acquaintance it was greatly his Interest to
cultivate, and to whom it was an Honour to be known, so he hoped it would not
give me any Uneasiness: I answered, he had always been so indulgent to
me, I must be ungrateful, indeed, to take Offence, or be uneasy at any
thing he was pleased to do; he seemed trans∣ported with my Answer,
kissed me, and said, I was the best Wife living. Little did I think
what Villainy he was perpetra∣ting against me.</P>
<P>He now stayed out several Nights en∣tirely, and, if he came at
all, it was not 'till Four or Five in the Morning, which, being unacquainted
with Jealousy, gave me no other Concern, than the Fear that Irre∣gularities
might prejudice his Health; but I have often been surprized at his coming
Home so sober, and that he did not ap∣pear drowsy, after such long
watching.</P>
<P>One Morning, in particular, he no sooner entered, but he called
for his Ri∣ding <PB N="106" REF="113"/> Dress, and told me, he was going with
a Gentleman into the Country, for a few Days; so giving me his Purse, in
which were forty Guineas, he desired I would carefully observe his
Business, in which I was now a pretty good Proficient.</P>
<P>Three Months Time elapsed, and, tho' I wrote to him, according
to his own Di∣rection, I never received an Answer.</P>
<P>I was now filled with the most gloomy Apprehensions; one Time
concluding he had been murdered; a thousand Fears presented themselves to
my Imagination, 'till lost and bewildered, I could fix on nothing: My Friends
persuaded me to ad∣vertise him, which accordingly I did.</P>
<P>Some Days after, a very well drest young Gentleman desired to
see me; I shewed him into the Parlour, where he demanded of me, whether I
was Mr. <HI>H—l</HI>'s Wife? I said, yes; upon which, to my great
Surprize, he asked me, could I prove it? I assured him I could: 
<Q REND="inline">"That is all I want, Madam:"</Q> I begged he would
explain those dark Speeches, inasmuch as they quite terrified 
<PB N="107" REF="114"/> me: 
<Q REND="inline">"Madam, said he, my Name is
<HI>L—ck—y,</HI> I have a good Estate, and am newly called to the
Bar; your Hus∣band has inveigled away my Sister, and married her; she is
under Age, and has fifteen thousand Pounds to her Fortune; she shall
prove her Marriage; and, if you do not prove your prior one, what can the World
think of you?"</Q></P>
<P>I was so astonished at this Account, that I fainted
away;—the Gentleman called the Servants to my Assistance, and
stayed by me 'till I came to myself; the Agonies I felt, are only known to
those who have truly and tenderly loved: dread∣ful Alternative! either to
prosecute a be∣loved Husband to Death, or be myself deemed an infamous
Woman?</P>
<P>Here the poor Creature had so renewed her own Anguish, and
so awakened all my Woes, that our Eyes streamed social, and mingled their
sympathetic Waters; 'till, insensibly, the dewy-feathered Sleep closed
up our Eye-lids.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="115"/>I longed as much for the next Night, as the
<HI>Sultan,</HI> in <HI>The Arabian Nights En∣tertainment,</HI> did to hear the
charming <HI>Sche∣razade</HI>'s fine Stories; at length it came, and the Lady
proceeded.</P>
<P>I begged a Day or two to consider on so important an Affair,
and also to con∣sult with my Friends, what was most ad∣viseable for me
to do, and then I would return a positive Answer; so, having an Uncle in
<HI>Bond-street,</HI> I sent my Houshold Furniture there: Dear Madam,
said I, what did you do with your Children? Oh, returned she, I never had
one that lived above a few Days. That, said I, was happy. I think so now,
said she, though I did not then. I told my Uncle all my mournful Story, who
advised me, bv all Means, to vindicate myself, and not fall a Prey to so
consummate a Villain.</P>
<P>I stayed with my Uncle, who was a Widower; my Sister married,
and Mr. <HI>H—</HI> would not pay her her For∣tune, as she had not
asked his Consent: <PB N="109" REF="116"/> My Uncle would not permit either
a Let∣ter, or a Message to be delivered to me, but kept me a perfect
Prisoner; how∣ever, there was a young Lady in the Neighbourhood, whom he had
some In∣clination to marry, and whom he fre∣quently brought, as a Companion,
to re∣lieve my solitary Hours.</P>
<P>One Evening she insisted on my coming to drink Tea with her,
my Uncle urged me to it; I went. Judge of my Surprize! when I found there my
Husband's Mother and Sister all drowned in Tears; they told me, he was
confined in <HI>Newgate,</HI>—had taken the Prison-Fever, and declared
he could not die in Peace, unless he saw me.</P>
<P>I loved too well to refuse his Request, upon which they
immediately hurried me into a Coach; and there indeed he was; the Lawyer had
arraigned him for his Life, and he must take his Trial.</P>
<P>He looked so dejected, and seemed so sincerely penitent,
and I, alas! so sincerely loved him, that I even consented to stay with
him in his Confinement; he acknow∣ledged <PB N="110" REF="117"/> his Fault; but
very artfully insinu∣ated, that it did not proceed from any Change in his
Affection, but that his Cir∣cumstances were so distressed, that he
had no other Means to retrieve them; that his Death could be of no Service to
me;—that I knew myself to be his lawful Wife; that he would always
support me; in short, he used every tender and prevailing Argument to
keep me from appearing against him, and, Heaven knows, I had no Inclination
to do it.</P>
<P>When his Trial-Day came, his second Wife fully proved her
Marriage to him; but, like the real Mother, I chose to give her all, sooner
than divide him, so she triumphed over me; and, as I had given up the
Cause, none of my Friends would give me any Assistance. I am now in the
oddest Situation imaginable; even a kept Mistress to my own Husband;
for, upon no other Terms, would he give me any Relief; nor do I know whether to
stile myself innocent or guilty for my Conde∣scension to him.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="118"/>As my Tenderness for him made me appear in
a bad Light to the World, ever ready to censure even our best Actions; I
dare not in my present Condition, let any Person, who knows me, see me,
lest they should think of me worse than I deserve—I have had no
Supply from him for a considerable Time; he has prohibited my writing to him
at his House; and now, dear Madam, advise me what to do.</P>
<P>There was something so peculiarly un∣happy in this poor
Creature's Fate, that it might puzzle a wiser Head than mine to comply with
her Request; I considered it every way without being able to form any
Scheme for her Relief.</P>
<P>At length, she told me, he kept an Of∣fice on
<HI>Ludgate-Hill,</HI> (where he was always to be found at Nine) in the
Morning, as his second Wife was too fine a Lady to bear one in the House;
she imagined, if I could see him, I might work on his Compassion; I
readily consented to do any thing which might be serviceable to her, and
rising early next Morning, she <PB N="112" REF="119"/> gave me a Letter to
him, which I pro∣mised not to deliver, but into his own Hand.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I set out on my Embassy, and found the
Gentleman, such as she had described him, a polite, handsome Man, of
above thirty Years of Age; he was alone, and received me very civilly: I
presented the Letter, but seemed ignorant of the Contents; I could easily
perceive he was much disturbed; however, with a marvellous Assurance, he
said, he could not give Charity to every Body; that he had often
assisted that unfortunate Person; that she ought to work for her
Bread, as many of her Betters did, and a Number of such inhuman Speeches,
common on those Occasions. I told him her present Condi∣tions did not
enable her to perform any but Needle-work, and that he who put her into it
should support her; he asked me what I meant? Nothing but Honesty; if a
Man gets a Child he ought to take care of it. What, said he, would you have
me father a Bastard? She could not, <PB N="113" REF="120"/> I am sure, have
One by you; and would not, I am convinced, have One by any Body else. He bade
me explain myself; I told him, he perfectly understood me, and therefore it
was not necessary; but that if he pleased, I would tell Mrs.
<HI>H—l</HI> the second, of his Midnight Visits to his Wife. The
Wretch seemed confounded, and seeing I knew him so well, thought he had
best be quiet, especially as a Gen∣tleman came in, before whom he did not
care to be exposed; so he called me to the Staircase, and putting a
Couple of Guineas into my Hand, said aloud, Madam, I shall take care, and
mind your Directions; I begged he would, and so we parted: But, I am well
convinced, it was Fear, not Love, that made him send her even that
Trifle.</P>
<P>This unhappy Lady died a few Hours after she was brought to Bed,
the Infant also died; and I hope, though her Hus∣band, by her Lenity, once
escaped a Hal∣ter, justly due to him, he has, by this Time, inherited it,
for I would have such Offenders so cut off.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="121"/>I grew so melancholy at the Loss of my
Companion, that I did not even care for writing, but amused myself entirely
with reading; and my not having a Li∣brary of my own, made me a constant
Customer to a Shop in the Neighbour∣hood, where they hired out Books by the
Quarter; this brought me into an Ac∣quaintance with the Persons who kept it,
sensible, well-bred People: One Day I received a Letter from Mrs.
<HI>Ryves,</HI> for that was their Name, that she had some very agreeable
Friends with her, and that they wanted a Hand at Quadrille, so she hoped I
would be of their Party; I was very glad of any Recreation, and as they lived
but in <HI>Brook-Street,</HI> directly went. I was shewn into a Parlour,
where sat an old Man, whom I knew to be a <HI>Grub-Street</HI> Writer, and a
young Gentleman in a very plain Dress, whom I also supposed to be in
the same Class; they were playing Crib∣bage for a Farthing a Game, and,
instead of Counters, scored with Chalk; they had also an Ale-house Pot,
with some Porter <PB N="115" REF="122"/> in it, standing by them, and the
Room smelled strong of Tobacco; from these Appearances, I conceived a
very con∣temptible Opinion of the Company, and would have retired, had I known
how to do it civilly; but, as at my Entrance, I had told Mrs. <HI>Ryves,</HI> I
was entirely dis∣engaged that Evening, I could by no means get off; and could
only hope for some little Amusement, by hearing what those Underlings in
Arts and Sciences might have to say; 
<Q> 
<L>For ev'ry Object of Creation</L> 
<L>May furnish Hints for Contemplation.</L></Q> The Scene,
however, was changed, the disagreeable Part of the Decoration re∣moved, and a
Quadrille Table introduced.</P>
<P>The younger Gentleman proposed our playing for Nothing: 
<Q REND="inline">"Pshaw, said I, then we shall all
cheat;"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"I would no more do that, said he, than give a
Vote against my Country."</Q>—This surpri∣zed me; told him, I hoped,
as he ex∣pressed such a Spirit of Patriotism, he had <PB N="116" REF="123"/>
a Seat in the House: He said, he had the Honour of representing the
ancient City of <HI>Canterbury</HI>; that his Father was Ad∣miral
<HI>Rocke,</HI> and that he was married to the Sister of the Lord
<HI>Guilford Dudley,</HI> a Lady unmatched in Wit, and Beauty: I told him, I
was glad to find one Person of Distinction, who was not ashamed to do
Justice to the Merits of his Lady: 
<Q REND="inline">"I should be a Scoundrel, said he to refuse
it; she gave me the Preference to a Man of a much larger Fortune, to whom her
Friends had destined her; an Obligation never to be forgot by a grateful
Spirit."</Q> This Gentleman had such an uncommon generous way of think∣ing,
that, instead of minding the Game, I was quite attentive to him, which he
ob∣serving, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Take away the Cards, they are only fit to amuse
such as are incapable of tasting a more rational Entertainment."</Q></P>
<P>I was very glad of this;—the old Scrib∣bler walked into the
Shop, to recreate him∣self <PB N="117" REF="124"/> with Tobacco, and Porter;
and Mrs. <HI>Ryves</HI> went to get us some Chat-inspiring Liquor, Green
Tea.</P>
<P>I told Mr. <HI>Rooke,</HI> if I had been any way wanting in
Respect to him, I hoped he would attribute it to my Ignorance of his Station,
and the Company, and Situa∣tion I found him in.</P>
<P>He assured me, I had committed no Offence, nor did he believe
it was in my Nature: But, said he, as you have re∣marked on the Company, you
must know my Wife and Lord <HI>S—thw—ll</HI>'s Sisters went
this Morning to <HI>Greenwich:</HI> I had some Business which prevented
my waiting on them; when that was over, I went to <HI>Mount-Street
Coffee-House,</HI> in order to pick up some Company to dine with me, and
finding none, I asked the old Man, who refused me, as Mrs. <HI>Ryves</HI>
had engaged him; I told him, I would go dine with him;—as I had, in the
Shop, read your Apology for the Minister, I was greatly surprised to hear
it was the Product of a Lady's Pen; when I seemed to question 
<PB N="118" REF="125"/> it, they proposed sending for you, which being very
agreeable to me, was imme∣diately done; so, Madam, this is the His∣tory of
the Day.</P>
<P>I thanked the Gentleman, for his Com∣plaisance in relating
it.</P>
<P>The Tea put him into such high Spirits, that he, finding me a
Sort of a Politician, told me many entertaining Stories about Sir
<HI>Rob—t W—l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s
various Schemes to have always the Majority of the House on his Side; of
which, as many as I can re∣collect that were humorous, I present my Readers
with.</P>
<P>The First was this: One Sir <HI>Cl—dy
M—cd—l,</HI> a <HI>Scots</HI> Baronet, without a Foot of Estate,
was returned duly elected, for what Shire I have forgot; however, he came to
<HI>London,</HI> took a Hackney-Coach, and drove to Sir <HI>Rob—t</HI>'s;
the Servants said, he was engaged; but Sir <HI>Cl—dy</HI> insisted
on his carrying up his Name, and, lest he should forget it, he jumped out
of the Coach, and, running up Stairs after him, delivered his Embassy 
<PB N="119" REF="126"/> himself. Sir <HI>Rob—t</HI> welcomed him, and,
like a Courtier, told him, he should be glad to serve him: 
<Q REND="inline">"Nay, nay, Mon, returned he, I came na here for
Com∣pliments; I ha ne Siller to get a Lodg∣ing, so I'll e'en stay here till
you give me some:"</Q> So Sir <HI>Rob—t</HI> chose to give him his
Purse, rather than be plagued with his Impertinence.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>P—rb—h,</HI> a Pen∣sioner, told Sir
<HI>Rob—t,</HI> he was always at a Loss how to vote, inasmuch as he
did not understand the Debates,—and was so near sighted, that when
the House divided, he knew not of which Side to go:—Sir
<HI>Rob—t</HI> bade him always follow the Bi∣shops. It happened, on the
Convention Scheme, three or four of the Bishops rose, and the Earl seeing
them move, he, ac∣cording to his Master's Direction, followed them, and voted
point-blank against his his Interest.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rooke,</HI> seeing how much I was pleased,
proceeded:</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="127"/>A <HI>Scots</HI> Peer, who was also a
Pen∣sioner, and a remarkable fat Man, came one Morning, according to
Custom, to Sir <HI>Rob—t</HI>'s Levee, and, without the least
Ceremony, laid hold of his Ribbon; Sir <HI>Rob—t</HI> could not readily
disengage him∣self, and the Nobleman lugged him to the Window, in which,
sousing him∣self down, he happened to have an Escape, which carried
with it so loud a Report, that it threw the whole Company into Laughter.</P>
<P>Very well, my Lord, said the Minister, pray what have you
farther to say?</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Why, this it is, Sir <HI>Rob—t,</HI> I owe
Fifteen Hundred Pounds, and by G—d, if you don't give it to me, I'll go
to∣morrow to the House, and vote ac∣cording to Conscience."</Q> 'Tis to be
presumed his Demand was complied with in private, though laughed at in
public, as he always voted with Sir <HI>Rob—t.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rocke</HI> finding me attentive, pro∣ceeded: The late Duke
of <HI>Wh—ton</HI> was a Man of infinite Variety, and Humour; 
<PB N="121" REF="128"/> at the Time of the Discovery of <HI>Atter∣bury</HI>'s
<HI>Plot,</HI> as they called it, which was proved by decyphering Letters, and
tor∣turing the harmless Alphabet into Treason; the Duke saw a Man at the
Door of the Parliament-House, selling Horn-books; Sir
<HI>Rob—t</HI>'s Equipage stopped, and the Duke, laying hold of him as
he alight, told him, he was surprised he did not send that Fellow to
<HI>Newgate,</HI> who was selling such a Libel on the Ministry: 
<Q REND="inline">"Why, said Sir <HI>Rob—t,</HI> my Lord,
those are Horn-books;"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Treason, by G—, replied the Duke, as I
will convince you;"</Q> so holding him, he ran on, 
<Q> 
<L><HI>A</HI> stands for an <HI>Army,</HI> and <HI>B</HI> for a
<HI>Bench,</HI></L> 
<L><HI>C</HI> stands for a <HI>Court,</HI> and <HI>D</HI> for a
<HI>Drench,</HI></L> 
<L><HI>E,</HI> I won't interpret that,</L> 
<L><HI>F</HI> stands for gay <HI>France,</HI> which we hope
will not swerve,</L> 
<L>And <HI>G</HI> stands for <HI>George,</HI>—whom God
long preserve,</L> 
<L><PB N="122" REF="129"/><HI>P</HI> stands for the
<HI>P—x,</HI> the <HI>Pretender,</HI> the <HI>Pope,</HI></L> 
<L>And <HI>R</HI> stands for <HI>Robin,</HI> and
<HI>Ribbon,</HI> and <HI>Rope!</HI></L></Q> said he, pulling him by the blue
String; the Minister could not help himself, and being naturally of a
pacific Temper, took this as quietly as he did G-n-r-l
<HI>Ch—ch—ll</HI>'s lying with his W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe.</P>
<P>As I had never heard the Story, I beg∣ged he would relate it: Why,
said he Sir <HI>R-b-rt</HI> went out very early one Morning to the House,
but having forgot some Paper of Importance to the dirty Work of the
Day,—he returned Home for it, and passing through his Wife's
Apartment to his Closet, what should he see, but his serene Spouse
and the General in amorous Dalliance—the General, All-Hero as he was,
jumped out of Bed, and besought Mercy, from, as he supposed, his
incensed Rival; but the good Man, resembling <HI>Cato</HI> in one Point, 
<Q><PB N="123" REF="130"/> 
<L>Who, if a Friend or so should chance to need her,</L> 
<L>Would recommend her as a special Breeder.</L></Q> said
carelesly, 
<Q REND="inline">"Prithee, what does the Fool mean? you look very
warm; get into Bed again, or you'll catch Cold."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rooke,</HI> seeing me so well diverted with this
Story, proceeded to another: As I have, said he, mentioned the Duke of
<HI>Wh—rt—n,</HI>—you are to know, he had an Intrigue with
Mrs. <HI>P—,</HI> now C—tess of <HI>B—</HI>; one Morning,
as they were in Bed together, he recollected that he had promised to write a
Letter to a Friend—so he called for a Pen, Ink, and Paper; but being at
a Loss for a Writing-Desk, made the Lady turn up her Poste—s, and
dated his Letter from sweet <HI>P—ggy P—lt—y</HI>'s
<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Here entered our kind Host, and brought us in a Paper called the
<HI>Champion,</HI> in which was a very humorous Piece of Advice to all who went
to C—t, to wear Shields on their Bu—s; this was so <HI>Mal</HI> 
<PB N="124" REF="131"/> <HI>à propos</HI> that it raised out Mirth:
Said Mr. <HI>Rooke,</HI> his M—'s own was in Dan∣ger the other Night; As
how, Sir? Why, said he, Sir <HI>Rob—t,</HI> not chusing to hurt the
Kingdom by the K—'s using foreign Commodities, when we had so much
cheaper and better at Home, recom∣mended to him Miss
<HI>Sk—rr—t,</HI> as an Hand-Maiden; his M— liked her so
well, that he invited her to sup with him in the C—tess of
<HI>Y—h</HI>'s Apart∣ment, where growing a little more fond of his young
Mistress than the old One could bear, she arose, and as the K—
leaned over the Table, drew the Chair from under him, and let M— come
souse to the Ground: Oh, what a Falling-off was there! He, all enraged,
rose again, kicked first the C—ss, next his Hat, and retired to his
Apartment, marvelously distempered with Choler.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, said I, surely Sir <HI>R—t</HI> was a most
necessary Servant, that would even Sir <HI>Pandarus</HI> of <HI>Troy</HI>
become, and that for his own Daughter, to oblige his M—; but an able
Politician will turn <PB N="125" REF="132"/> his Hand to any thing, where
Profits may accrue, and Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> observes that 
<Q> 
<L>In Pimps, and Politicians,</L> 
<L>The Genius is the same.</L></Q> And yet, who could
suspect a Man of his Reverence and Station, for the most vile and
servile of all Employments!</P>
<P>Oh sy, said he, don't disgrace so noble an Occupation. I
assure you, the Knight's Complaisance to the General proved the Means of
saving his own Life; for, on the Excise Scheme, the People were so
incensed, that they determined to put him to Death, and yet make it seem
Chance Medley: Accordingly, as he was going down to St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s
<HI>Steps,</HI> into our il∣lustrious S—te-House! one Man pushed
him so hard that he tumbled on his Face, and a Number of Persons determined
to run over him, and trample him to Death; but the General, who was with him,
drew his Sword, and swore the first who ad∣vanced should die on Point of
<HI>Fox.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="133"/>No body ventured to encounter a
<HI>Ch—ll,</HI> so the Prime M—ster escaped.</P>
<P>Ah! said I, that was God's Mercy, and ten Thousand Pities!
Faith, said he, and so it was.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rooke</HI> now began to be a little in∣quisitive, who I
was? I told him my Name was <HI>Meade,</HI> for by that I always went in
<HI>London</HI>; so that the numerous Stories of Mrs. <HI>P—n</HI>'s
being in Ta∣verns, Bagnio's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which my Husband says be can
prove, (<HI>Mem.</HI> he lyes) never appertained to me; but to his own
C—sin <HI>N—y P—n,</HI> whose Father lives in
<HI>Pill-Lane,</HI>—and who is herself as common a Prostitute as ever
traversed the Hundreds of <HI>Drury.</HI></P>
<P>I do this to convince him I scorn to rob any of his
illustrious Family of their noble Atchievements, and, according to the old
Proverb, '<HI>Tis but proper to set the Saddle on the right Horse,</HI> or
rather Mare, for I think she much resembles one.</P>
<P>But to return.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="134"/>Mr. <HI>Rooke</HI> asked me, if I was
related to Capt. <HI>Meade?</HI> I told him, he was my Uncle's Son: He said,
he was a worthy little Fellow; that he knew him very well, and had made him his
Confidant in his Amour with his Lady.</P>
<P>Time stole insensibly away with such agreeable
Amusement; we sat till the small Hours without Drowsiness, nor did we
de∣sire the Aid of <HI>Bacchus</HI> to keep up our Spirits.</P>
<P>I humbly hope no body will attempt to decypher my Initials; for I
do assure them, the great <HI>M—</HI> is an innocent Letter, and does
not like <HI>Mitching, Mal∣licho,</HI> mean Mischief.</P>
<P>I told Mr. <HI>Rooke,</HI> I was going to pub∣lish a Book by
Subscription; he said, he was sure it must be good, so he gave me a
Guinea, and promised to use his Interest for me.</P>
<P>He told me, he would come and visit me the first Hour he had
to spare: I an∣wered, I hoped he would soon find one: Well then, said he,
I'll tell you how I pass the Day, and do you find one.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="135"/>I rise about Nine, drink Coffee, not that
I like it, but that it gives a Man the Air of a Politician; for the same
Reason, al∣ways read the News;—then I dress, and about Twelve, go to
the <HI>Cocoa-Tree,</HI> where I talk Treason; from thence to St.
<HI>James</HI>'s Coffee-House, where I praise the Ministry; then to
<HI>White</HI>'s, where I talk Gallantry; so by Three I return Home to
Dinner; after that, I read about an Hour, and digest the Book and the Dinner
to∣gether;—then I go the Opera or Play, <HI>Vaux-Hall</HI> or
<HI>Ranelagh,</HI> according to the Season of the Year; from thence Home to
Supper, and about Twelve to Bed.</P>
<P>I smiled at the Gentleman's whimsical Description of his
passing the Day, and told him he had, by his own Account, three or four
Hours to bestow on me, as the Hour he talked Treason, the Hour he was
loyal, or the Hour in which he read; 
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, said he, very gaily, or what think you of
the last Flour, wherein I go to Bed?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh, Sir, you are so much better enga∣ged, it
would not only be Wickedness, but Folly also, to think of that at
all."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="136"/>Well, depend on it, said he, I'll see
you to∣morrow; so we took Leave forever, for the very first News I heard
next Morning, was, that Mr. <HI>Rooke,</HI> a little while after he arose,
fell down in an Apoplectic Fit, and instantly expired.</P>
<P>I never was more shocked than at his untimely Fate; Heavens! all
Wit, Life, and Gaiety at Night, and dead in the Morning! I wept for him as a
Friend, and such, I am sure, he would have been to me, had he lived. I
found, by these two me∣lancholy Events, there was nothing serious in
Mortality; all was but Toys! I frequently recollected Dr. <HI>Delany</HI>'s
beautiful Lines on seeing himself in the Glass: 
<Q> 
<L>When I revolve this evanescent State</L> 
<L>Of short Duration, and uncertain Date;</L> 
<L>My Being, and my Stay dependent still,</L> 
<L>Not on my own, but on another's Will;</L> 
<L>I ask myself as I my Form review,</L> 
<L>Which is the real Shadow of the two?</L></Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Ryves</HI> was also much touched for the Loss of this
Gentleman, and, indeed, <PB N="130" REF="137"/> so was every body who knew
him. She and I went one Afternoon to walk in <HI>St. James</HI>'s
<HI>Park,</HI> but finding myself weary, she proposed going to a
Physician's House in <HI>Westminster,</HI> a Widower, and her
Rela∣tion, where we could get a Dish of Tea, and rest ourselves; I
agreed; the Doctor was at Home, and a very polite Gentle∣man; I found by the
Furniture of the Room, he was a <HI>Virtuoso,</HI> it being adorned with
Books, Medals, Paintings, dried Butterflies, and Tomes of Casuistry.</P>
<P>The Dean mentions it as a Praise to <HI>Vanessa,</HI> that 
<Q> 
<L>She, witb Address, each Genius held</L> 
<L>To that wherein they most excell'd;</L> 
<L>So making others Wisdom known,</L> 
<L>She pleas'd them, and improv'd her own.</L></Q> For no
sooner did the Doctor perceive that I knew <HI>Mark Anthony</HI> from
<HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> and <HI>Brutus</HI> from both, but he related a great
Part of the <HI>Roman</HI> History to me, even from the first
<HI>Punic</HI> War to the Death of <HI>Julius.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="138"/>My Readers may venture to believe it was not
new to me, who had from my Childhood been, if I may use the Word, a perfect
Devourer of Books; and I found them both sweet to the Palate, and
nou∣rishing Food to the Mind.</P>
<P>It has been observed, as a Piece of re∣fined Policy in
<HI>Gondamore</HI> the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that he used to talk bad
<HI>Latin</HI> to King <HI>James</HI> I. who being a Pedant rather than a
Prince, had so much Pleasure in, as he thought, setting this
<HI>Machiavel</HI> right, that, to oblige his Pupil, he complimented him with
the Head of that learned and brave Man Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh.</HI></P>
<P>I have often successfully practised the same Art, and
gained many Friends by seeming to take their Instruction with Pleasure;
to acknowledge their Superiority of Understanding, on which even Fools pride
themselves, is, I believe the most delicate way of flattering ever yet
thought of, as <HI>Cassius</HI> says of <HI>Caesar,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>And when I tell him, he hates Flattery,</L> 
<L>He says he does, being then most flattered.</L></Q> 
<PB N="132" REF="139"/> Very few People are Virtue Proof there, all, like
<HI>Achilles,</HI> have a mortal Heel, and though 
<Q> 
<L>'Tis an old Maxim in the Schools,</L> 
<L>That Flattery's the Food of Fools;</L> 
<L>Yet, now and then, your Men of Wit</L> 
<L>Will condescend to taste a Bit.</L> 
<BIBL>Swift.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I found the good Doctor fallible here, to my great Happiness, as
it made him my Friend; and, under God, his Skill and Care soon after saved
my Life.</P>
<P>The Gentleman made us stay to Supper, finding when the Wind was
in one particu∣lar Point, I was as wise as <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and knew a Hawk
from a Handsaw.</P>
<P>At Supper I told him, I was an <HI>Amicus,</HI> a-kin to the
Faculty, being a Physician's Daughter, upon which he arose, and said he
must salute his Niece; and, that if ever I should fall sick, he claimed
the Ho∣nour of attending me. We stayed toge∣ther till Twelve very chearfully,
and then parted in Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="140"/>I have observed, if my Life had any
Sunshine, it was but a faint and watery Gleam, too soon overcast, for, in
a very few Days, I was seized with a violent Fe∣ver; it took me with cold
shivering Fits, and remembering the Doctor's Claim, I sent for him. He had
me bled, and ordered me to go to Bed; I did not see him till next Morning, by
which time I was quite light-headed, and crying out for my Chil∣dren; when the
Doctor came, I told him he had stolen them from me, and carried them to Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI>; on this he opened my Bosom, for which I also
quarrelled, and said he was a very impudent Fellow; he, smiling, said, I
had a very fair Skin, but that he was under a Necessity of making free with
it, otherwise he could not answer for my Life; and as, it seems, it was
full of purple Spots, he ordered a large Blister for my Back, and one for
each Arm; what past for some Days, in which, they were renewed, I know not,
being quite insensible even to Pain; but when the Fever abated, and
Reason once <PB N="134" REF="141"/> more reassumed her Throne, what Frail
Machines are we, when Sickness can dis∣place her? They assured me, I
raved in∣cessantly for my dear little Ones, and fell into such Fits of
Crying and Lamentation for them, that it put them in Mind of <HI>Rachel</HI>
mourning for the Loss of her Chil∣dren, who refused to be comforted,
be∣cause they were not.</P>
<P>So, as it has been often observed, that there is Truth in Wine,
I found there was Truth in Madness, the Cause that hurts the Brain, or the
reigning Passion of the Soul then manifests itself, and as my Be∣loved
were evermore present to my Ima∣gination, it was no Wonder that their Names
dwelt ever on my Tongue.</P>
<P>When these Things were told me, I, as one newly awakened from
Sleep, remem∣bered some wild, disjointed, incoherent Ideas, which had
possessed my Soul, even during it's lethargic State; such as, that
Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> was going to offer some violent Injury to our
Children, but of what Kind I knew not, it was fled, like the Remembrance of a
Guest which tarrieth <PB N="135" REF="142"/> but a Day. I might have as well
have endeavoured to find out the Path which the light Bird had with his Wings
beat in the buxom Air, or the Track of a Ship, when with it's crooked Keel, it
divides the briny Waves which immediately unite again; or seize old
<HI>Time,</HI> and bid him bring me back one Moment past, as hope to
recollect what, was for ever lost in Oblivion.</P>
<P>Indeed I have frequently had these su∣pernatural Sollicitings,
or a Kind of Indi∣cation of whatever was to befal me before it happened: Nay,
what is more surpri∣zing, I have read a History, to me quite new, and it
has occurred to me, that I myself had been some way principally concerned
in the most material Transactions of it, tho' they were past a thousand
Years.</P>
<P>Had I lived in the Days of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> I believe I
should have been of his Opi∣nion, and have imagined, 
<Q> 
<L>That all Things are but altered; nothing dies,</L> 
<L>And here and there th' unbody'd Spirit flies.</L></Q> 
<PB N="136" REF="143"/> Nay, I should have been afraid to kill a Woodcock,
lest I should disinherit the Soul of my Grand-dame.</P>
<P>If my Reader thinks me whimsical, let him judge by the
Event.</P>
<P>A Woman, (in whose Garden I had once walked in <HI>Ireland)</HI>
the first Day I was able to sit up, and very weak I was after so long
Sickness, even while my kind Physician was rubbing my Temples with
<HI>Hungary</HI> Water to recover me out of a fainting Fit, rushed into the
Room, and, without the least Ceremony, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Do you know what that Villain has done?"</Q> As I
neither knew her, nor who she spoke of, I was quite startled, and asked
her, who she talked about, or what she meant? 
<Q REND="inline">"That Villain <HI>P—n,</HI> says she,
who has sold your two younger Children for Slaves to <HI>New York:</HI>"</Q>
This was such a monstrous Crime I could scarce give any Credit to it;
for, even admit∣ting what he had so cruelly charged me with in Regard to his
Bed, was Truth, how had their helpless Innocence offended 
<PB N="137" REF="144"/> him? I observed to the Doctor, my Ra∣vings were
ominous, and portended some dire Calamity.</P>
<P>The Doctor, apprehending this Shock might make me relapse,
begged of the Person who gave it, to retire; which, after several
Asseverations, that what she said was Fact, as indeed it was, and that
she had brought it out in that Manner to haste me, if possible, to
prevent their un∣happy Fate, she did.</P>
<P>As the Doctor was not only a Man of excellent Understanding, but
also of great Humanity, I told him, as he had been so kind to administer
to the Health of my Body, he must now, if possible, administer to a
Mind diseased; and as it was impos∣sible for him to prescribe
Remedies with∣out knowing the Distemper, and it's Ori∣ginal, I gave him my
Story in a few Words, and he advised me to write to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to the
Rulers, and Bishops, which I did that very Night; and, pro∣videntially, the
Letters were delivered Time enough to prevent the Children being sold to
Slavery—the Affair was <PB N="138" REF="145"/> enquired into, and Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> was obliged to refund to the Master of the Kid-Ship, the
Golden Earnest he had received as the Price of the Innocent.</P>
<P>What to me was most surprizing, was, that Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI>'s Mother was one of the Contrivers of this infernal Plot;
Grand∣mothers being usually more indulgent to their Grandchildren than even
their Mo∣thers; but as she who would have made a Prey of them is not long
since dead, even of the Disease that <HI>Herod, Peter the Cruel,</HI> and
other malignant Wretches fell by, I can only bid her adieu, and chari∣tably
hope she has escaped the Judgment of the next World, as it fell on her in
this.</P>
<P>These Facts are so publickly known, that for the Evidence of
them I could pro∣duce even a Cloud of Witnesses, were it necessary.</P>
<P>And yet, who that beheld this Man, clad in holy Vesture at the
Altar, appear∣ing like white-robed Innocence, with Eyes up-turned to Heaven,
could believe him capable of all Manner of Crimes; 
<Q><PB N="139" REF="146"/> 
<L>Perjury, Perjury in the highest Degree!</L> 
<L>Cruelty, Cruelty in the sternest Degree.</L></Q> He may,
indeed, like <HI>Richard</HI> III. prove himself by these to be a Man; who,
when his Mother upbraids him with his mani∣fold Acts of savage Tyranny, she
says, 
<Q> 
<L>No Beast so fierce, but knows some Touch of Pity.</L> 
<L><HI>Rich.</HI> But I know none, and therefore am no
Beast.</L></Q></P>
<P>And, indeed Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> may again say with him, that
he has nothing 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>But the plain Devil, and dissembling Looks</L>
<L>To back his Cause.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Oh that <HI>Ithuriel</HI>'s heav'nly temper'd Spear</L>
<L>Would make the Fiend in his own Shape appear,</L>
</LG></Q> <PB N="140" REF="147"/> Or pluck the holy Furr from off
his Back, and let the World, for once see what the Inside of a wicked
Priest is made of.</P>
<P>As I received no Account from <HI>Ireland,</HI> I knew not what to
think; sometimes I flattered myself that the Woman had be∣lied him; at
other Times, reflecting on his intolerable Barbarity to the poor Crea∣tures,
whom Distress alone made me leave immured within his inhospitable Walls,
too rough a Cradle for my pretty Ones! my very Heart died within me, and I am
as well assured, as that I live, that it was not the Fear of God, but the
Fear of a Halter, hindered him from embruing his own Hands in their vital
Blood.</P>
<P>But, enough of the Wretch, who, if he can disprove me, ought to
do it; he attributes his Silence to Contempt of me, but it is well known he
neither wants Wit, nor Words, nor Impudence to bring him off: It is strong
Conviction, with Proof as full and evident as Day against him, ties up his
guilty Tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="148"/>At length, I thought of writing to
<HI>W—rs—le,</HI> as I had learned he was in <HI>Dublin:</HI> He
wrote me Word, that the Children were all well; that he had given an
Apprentice-Fee with my Daughter to a Milliner, and had taken my youngest Son
to himself; that old Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> and my Mother were dead, and my
last Child, which, being but an Infant, I could not carry to <HI>London</HI>
with me; that he had got a famous ossified Man, and was going to carry him
to <HI>Paris</HI> for a Shew, to which Place he earnestly invited me to
accompany him.</P>
<P>I hoped, by this Letter, that Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> had been
wronged, with re∣gard to the Children under his Care; and tho' some humane
Tears fell for the Loss of my Mother and my Child, yet, con∣sidering how
desolate they both were, I en∣vied rather than deplored their Fate.</P>
<P>The Child, here mentioned, was that which Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>
disclaimed, and advised me to leave upon the Parish.</P>
<P>And now I do assure my Readers I was also sincerely
sorry for the Death of old <PB N="142" REF="149"/> Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI>
inasmuch as he always treated me with a fatherly Tenderness, was
excessively fond of my Children, was a Man of a great uncultivated Genius;
and, tho' I have mentioned his keeping an Alehouse, I did not mean it in any
Dis∣respect to his Memory; for he was the Son of a Gentleman, tho', by
various Mis∣fortunes, he was reduced to take up so low an Occupation; but
nothing can be justly deemed scandalous which is not dishonest. And, I
am well convinced, had he lived, he never would have consented to the
in∣human Barbarity of his Son. 
<Q> 
<L>Adieu, and take thy Praise with thee to Heav'n!</L></Q></P>
<P>So many melancholy Incidents had be∣fallen me in this solitary
Place, that I de∣termined to change my Lodging; and was recommended by a
Stationer's Wife to a single Gentlewoman who kept a Milliner's Shop in
<HI>Fleet-street</HI>; she was a jolly likely Dame, of about Forty, very
gay; we liked each other so well, that we soon <PB N="143" REF="150"/> made
a Bargain, and, for a few Days, I was very well pleased with the Change, as
the Variety of that busy Part of <HI>London</HI> amused my Mind: But I
soon found that I was got into very bad Hands, and that my new Landlady was
neither better nor worse than a mercenary Town Jilt; who being pretty well
known herself, and consequently despised, wanted something new to
produce to her Customers.</P>
<P>I think I never saw any Person in my Life who did not
possess one good Quality, except this Creature; for Woman is a Term too
gentle for her, who had not even Decency to hide her Shame.</P>
<P>To give my Reader a Taste of her Cleanliness: She told me
herself she had not combed her Head for three Years, which, I believe, was
true, because she was not Mistress of a Comb, except when she made
free with mine, than which no∣thing could be more offensive to me, so that
her Hair, tho' naturally fine, being quite matted on a filthy Hair-cap,
seemed to be a Composition of raw Silk and Moss, such as I remember to
have stolen a Lock <PB N="144" REF="151"/> of from the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad of Good Duke <HI>Hum∣phrey,</HI> at <HI>St.
Albans,</HI> three hundred Years after his Death: Shifts she had two as
yellow as Canvas, but they were sleeveless; no Matter for thar, she
sold ready-made Cambrick Sleeves, and could easily pin on a Pair, for she
never took any farther Trouble about them; I think I must for the rest
refer my Reader to the Lady's Dressing-room, for 
<Q> 
<L>In such a Case few Words are best,</L> 
<L>And <HI>Strephon</HI> bids us guess the rest.</L></Q></P>
<P>I really, 'till I saw this Wretch, ima∣gined the Dean had only
mustered up all the dirty Ideas in the World in one Piece, on Purpose to
affront the Fair Sex, as he used humorously to stile old Beggar-women,
and Cinder-Pickers.</P>
<P>This makes me digress to relate a Com∣pliment of his to some
Ladies, who supped with him, of which I had the Honour to be One: The Dean
was giving us an Ac∣count of some Woman, who, he told us, was the
nastiest, filthiest, most stinking old <PB N="145" REF="152"/>
B—ch that ever was yet seen, except the Company, Ladies! except the
Company! for that you know is but civil. We all bowed; could we do less?</P>
<P>From the Time I had the Misfortune of being her Tenant, she
invited every Person she had any Acquaintance with to see me, as tho' I
had been some outlandish Monster, or wonderful Curiosity. Amongst the
rest, she prevailed on the now L—d Ch—f J—st—ce
<HI>E—e,</HI> then a Stu∣dent in <HI>Grays-Inn,</HI> a fine Gentleman,
po∣etically turned, and somewhat too much upon the effeminate or delicate
Order to bear whatever was not quite refined, to venture into her Dining-Room,
where I sat scribbling; I was for retiring, but that was not permitted: The
Gentleman, who was dressed in black Velvet, and had the Air of a Person
of Distinction, said, he hoped as his Visit was intended entirely to me,
I would not be so unkind as to refuse it.</P>
<P>I said, I did not know how I was enti∣tled to such an Honour;
but since he was pleased to bestow it on me, I should with Gratitude
accept of it. My Hostess, for <PB N="146" REF="153"/> that Name, by her
Bulk, far above the common Size of Females, she seemed to deserve,
prudently left the Stranger and I to ourselves, under Pretence that she
must at∣tend her Shop. Mr. <HI>E—e,</HI> seeing my Table covered with
written Papers, told me, my Room resembled that of a Law∣yer, and asked me
Leave to read my Contemplations; to which I agreeing, he had the Complaisance
to seem entertained; when, to my unspeakable Confusion, the Brute
returned, and cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"What will you treat the Lady with?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">Any thing she chuses,"</Q> returned he, and
seemed as much confounded as I was: 
<Q REND="inline">"Pray, Madam, what do you like?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No∣thing at present, Sir, but what I have
ordered, some Coffee;"</Q> as it was but Five o'Clock in the Afternoon, and
as the Gentleman was remarkable for Sobriety, he approved of my Taste: He
offered to pay for it; 
<Q REND="inline">"I told him, I did not sell it, and that he
could not more highly ag∣grieve me."</Q></P>
<P>My Landlady sent it up, but did not think proper to partake of
our Repast, of <PB N="147" REF="154"/> which I was very glad; he looked on me
with Eyes of great Compassion, especially as he observed the Tears
springing from mine, for indeed I was quite shocked; he asked me how I
became acquainted with a Person so very unlike myself? I told him, I was
a Stranger, and knew very little of her: as he gave Credit to my Words, he
advised me to quit her House, assuring me she was a Procuress, and,
as he said, kept a Shop only to disguise her real Occupation.</P>
<P>He had scarce finished his friendly Cau∣tion, when Madam
entered again with two very large Lobsters in one Hand, and a Bottle of Wine
in the other, she laid a very foul Table Cloth, dressed her Fish, and
invited us to partake; which we refusing, she eat them all herself, drank
the Bottle of Wine, and very modestly desired the Gentleman to pay for
them, to which he acquiesced.</P>
<P>This Scene made us laugh heartily, for she fed with such keen
Dispatch, and drank so often, that she seemed like a starved Pierot,
devouring all before her.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="155"/>Her Rage of Hunger being now, as we hoped,
suppressed, she once more left us; and Mr. <HI>E—e</HI> said, 
<Q REND="inline">"I hope you are now convinced, Madam, that, at
least, your Reputation will be un∣done, if you continue here:"</Q> I
answered, 
<Q REND="inline">"It was but too true; but that, at pre∣sent, I
saw no Method of Relief, as she owed me Money, which she never was
bashful in borrowing, by which means I was ill provided to remove, and had
agreed to take it out in Board and Lodging."</Q></P>
<P>Here Madam once more rushed in, when, to my great Surprize!
she asked Mr. <HI>E—e,</HI> would he give her a roasted Fowl and
Sausages for Supper? He told her, after so plentiful a Meal as she had
just made, he was sure she did but jest: She affirmed she was in
earnest, and that if he would not, there was a Gentleman below that
would.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>E—e,</HI> who had a Mind to hold more Talk with me,
asked me, what Part of the House belonged to me? She answered, with
matchless Impudence, a <PB N="149" REF="156"/> very good Bed-chamber, which
she sup∣posed, we should have no Objection to, as we liked each other
so well.</P>
<P>I seemed not to take the Meaning of her Speech; and not having
the least Appre∣hension of any Incivility being offered to me by a Person
of good Breeding, and Humanity; I told the Gentleman, he should be very
welcome, if he pleased to walk into it,—as it was on the same Floor;
he said, I did him great Honour, and that he would wait on me.</P>
<P>However, to avoid the evil Comments which wicked Persons,
judging others by themselves, are ever ready to make, I left the Door wide
open, to the no small Mor∣tification of my Landlady, and her new Guest, as
they were obliged to pass by it.</P>
<P>And what should he be but some drunken Swabber or Boatswain!
whose Tarpaulin Compliments, of which we heard every Word distinctly, for
some time, diverted us; 'till, at last, their Talk became so
of∣fensive, that as I had left the Door open in Point of Decency, I was now
on the same Account obliged to shut it.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="157"/>The Gentleman once more urged the
Necessity of my Departure from this vil∣lainous Woman; assuring me, if
I would but change my Lodging, and send a Line to him, with a Direction,
where to find me, he would do every thing in his Power to serve
distressed Merit, as he was please to term it.</P>
<P>And that nothing might be wanting to enable me to do it, he, in a
very polite Manner, obliged me to accept of two Guineas, as a Subscription to
my Wri∣tings.</P>
<P>This ingenious Gentleman entertained me with the Recital of
several beautiful poetical Compositions of his own, and finding I was not
quite tasteless, but, at least, endeavoured to give them due Praise, he
stayed with me 'till Ten o'Clock, no unseasonable Hour, as it was in the
Month of <HI>June</HI>; when, either being hungry himself, or willing to
entertain me, he insisted on my Permission to send to the <HI>Devil
Tavern</HI> for some Supper, a Meal I never chuse, but, in Complaisance
to my Benefactor, and also as a Means of en∣gaging <PB N="151" REF="158"/> his
further Conversation, which was truly elegant, I, with some Reluc∣tance,
submitted to. Our one Maid be∣ing gone for the other Bowl of Punch for the
Sailor, the Gentleman went and be∣spoke it himself.</P>
<P>I could not, in his Absence, but reflect how much the unhappy
Part of Women disappoint even their own Ends; for when they throw off the
Appearance of Modesty, and shew the mercenary Prosti∣tute unveiled, no
Man of common Under∣standing can have the least Regard for them; Mr.
<HI>Addison</HI> observes of some Wo∣man, who kept a noted House of
civil Reception, that she said, no Girl was fit, even for her, who was
past blushing. Well said the Dean, in the following Lines: 
<Q> 
<L>O Decency, coelestial Maid!</L> 
<L>Descend from Heaven to Beauty's Aid;</L> 
<L>Tho' Beauty may beget D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sire,</L> 
<L>'Tis thou must fan the Lover's Fire,</L> 
<L>To hold him in Delusion still,</L> 
<L>And make him fancy what you will.</L></Q> 
<PB N="152" REF="159"/> And I do assure my Reader, I did not forget to
return Thanks to the Almighty, who had enabled me to live by his Gifts to me;
for, sure I am, that I could raise no Money by vile Means; 
<Q> 
<L>By Heav'n, I had rather coin my Heart for Gold,</L> 
<L>And drop my Blood for Drachma's.</L> 
<BIBL>Shakespeare.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>E—e</HI>'s Return broke off my Contemplation; he had
ordered a slight, but elegant Repast, with a Flask of
<HI>Cham∣paigne</HI>; we supped together with great Pleasure, and, except
the dissonant and unharmonious Noise made by our Neigh∣bours, who were
now got so merry, that they did, what they called, sing; we had no
Interruption, but talked of History, Poetry, and every Muse-like Theme;
called all the mighty Dead before us, re-judged their Acts, commented on the
Works of <HI>Milton, Shakespear, Spencer,</HI> and all the <HI>British</HI>
Classics. 
<Q><PB N="153" REF="160"/> 
<L>Refin'd Delight, and fitted to endure!</L> 
<L>But what can human Happiness secure?</L> 
<BIBL>Delany</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The Star, that ushers in the rosy Dawn, began to reassume
her Empire o'er the Dusk, and drowsy World; the Bell tolled One, a Signal
of Departure to my amiable Guest, whose kind Injunctions, in regard to my
Removal, I promised to obey.</P>
<P>The Maid, whom her Mistress half starved, and though she
was really her Betters, used so ill, that she down-right hated her, told
me that the Sailor and she were gone to Bed together, both dead drunk.</P>
<P>And yet this Creature would talk of Virtue, nay, go to Church;
but, to say the Truth, she only went there to pick up a Gallant.</P>
<P>As I was not in the least sleepy, I dis∣missed the
Servant, and 
<Q><PB N="154" REF="161"/> 
<LG>
<L>Revolving in my clouded Soul</L>
<L>The various Turns of Things below,</L>
<L>Now and then a Sigh I stole,</L>
<L>And Tears began to flow.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>I open'd the Window, looked at the Moon</L>
<L>Riding near her highest Noon,</L>
<L>Like One, who had been led astray</L>
<L>Thro' the Heav'ns wide pathless Way;</L>
<L>And oft, as if her Head she bow'd,</L>
<L>Stooping thro' a fleecy Cloud.</L>
</LG></Q> In short, I was wrapped in a pleasing Fit of
Melancholy, and had I been in the Country, midst vernal Airs and Blooms,
should have attuned my rural Minstrelsy to some high Theme; but, alas!
Ease and Retirement, those Friends to the Muse, ever were denied to me,
being in a popu∣lous City pent amidst the busy Hum of Men, obliged to work
for daily Bread, and often not obtaining even that poor Pittance.</P>
<P>Oh! that I could now retire! that some charitable Hand would
bestow on my poor <PB N="155" REF="162"/> Remains of Life, even but a Clay
Habita∣tion in some sequestered Scene, where, 
<Q> 
<L>On ev'ry Thorn delightful Wisdom grows,</L> 
<L>In ev'ry Rill a sweet Instruction flows.</L></Q> How happy
should I think myself!</P>
<P>My Readers will, I hope, acknow∣ledge I deal candidly with them,
when I not only acquaint them with my Actions, but reveal to them even the
inmost Re∣cesses of my Soul as freely as to Heaven.</P>
<P>At length, remembering that Nature requires a Time of Rest, I
thought it but meet to indulge the pleasing Heavi∣ness: or, in plainer
Language, I went to Bed, and enjoyed the Honey-dew of Sleep, 'till it was very
late in the Day.</P>
<P>It seems the Maid had, on purpose to mortify her Mistress,
told her how genteely Mr. <HI>E—e</HI> had entertained me; which, though
she herself had been guilty of such foul Intemperance, and swinish
Gluttony, raised her Indignation to such a Height, <PB N="156" REF="163"/>
that she downright affronted me, telling me, I had no Business with her
Gallant: Why, said I, sure you had him all to your∣self, I did not
interfere; for I supposed she meant honest Tar, but, it seems, I was
mistaken, for it was Mr. <HI>E—e,</HI> whom she had so politely
dismissed, and whom now she had called a hundred Scrubs; as∣suring
me, she could never make any thing of him, and really I believed her; and by
what I then saw of her Temper, I am certain, had she known he had made me a
Present, I should not have escaped with∣out a good Beating.</P>
<P>Well, said she, at last, I warrant I had a better Chap than
your fine Beau; (this was speaking pretty plain) my Man gave me a Crown, and
Victuals, and Liquor enough: Now, be sincere, what did that Mr.
<HI>Maiden</HI> give you? For what, said I, I have nothing to sell; you who
keep a Shop, and are in the way of Trade, may easily dispose of five
Shillings Worth of Goods.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="164"/>The Wretch knew not what Answer to make to
me; to acknowledge herself a Prostitute, as I did not seem to think her
one, was too vile, even for her, and to have given but the most remote Hint,
that she suspected any evil Correspondence between Mr.
<HI>E—e</HI> and me, laid her absolutely at our Mercy.</P>
<P>However, she turned off the Discourse with what Mr.
<HI>Addison</HI> terms a Horse-Laugh, an excellent Expedient to supply
the Lack of Brains, and which whoever can secure on their Side, are sure of
Victory; for who can stand it, let it be ever so in∣judiciously
bestowed?</P>
<P>This I have very lately experienced, when one
<HI>W—dw—rd,</HI> a Player, got the Laugh against me, who never
vied with his superior Excellence, only by saying, 
<Q> 
<L>What, shall a Tumbler set me thus adrift,</L> 
<L>I the Successor of immortal <HI>Swift?</HI></L></Q> Oh
that his Words had been true! that he had bequeathed to me the precious Legacy
of his Wit and Learning 
<Q><PB N="158" REF="165"/> 
<L>Or that, when all sublim'd, he rose to Heaven,</L> 
<L>I had inherited his sacred Mantle;</L> 
<L>Then midst the Prophets might I, in Strains</L> 
<L>Such as delight the Ear of God, pour forth Unfetter'd
Harmony.</L></Q></P>
<P>But to descend to this terrene Spot: I drest, and wandered
forth in quest of a new Lodging; not well knowing this Part of the Town, I
past through a very clean Court, all inhabited by Jewellers, and just
opposite to the End of it saw on the Window of what they in <HI>London</HI>
call a Twist Shop, a Bill up to let the first Floor. The Woman of the
House shewed me the Apartment; the Furniture was not only new but rich, and
I concluded the Price would be too high for me; but, to my great Surprise,
the Woman of the House agreed, not only to furnish me with Linen, but
also with Plate and China for Five Shillings a Week; there was but one
In∣convenience, which was, that there was no Passage into the House, but
through the <PB N="159" REF="166"/> Shop, to which, if they did not object, I
had no Cause. It so fortuned that the Countess of <HI>Essex</HI>'s
Woman, whom I had known at the Laundress's before-men∣tioned, came in, and
gave me so high a Character, that we agreed on my taking Possession
of my new Apartment the next Day.</P>
<P>I went from this to a Friend's to Dinner, and did not return Home
till Ten at Night; but never in my Life was I more highly provoked; for lo! my
Land∣lady and some Fellow or other were in my Bed; the Maid never apprized me
of it, being willing to expose her brutal Mis∣tress to the utmost, but
shewed me into the Chamber.</P>
<P>I am certain, I was infinitely more ashamed than she was, for
she called to me to sit down on the Bed side; but I hastened out, and,
as I could not take up with her Bed, I was obliged to sit up all Night.</P>
<P>Pretty soon in the Morning, a Woman came to see me; she and
I packed up my Clothes, called a Porter, and made him carry them to my new
Abode, and, as I <PB N="160" REF="167"/> hoped never to see the Wretch again,
I did not bid her Adieu.</P>
<P>My Landlord was a Master-Taylor, in very good Circumstances,
and his Wife a very sober modest Woman.</P>
<P>I past a Week over very calmly, when remembering my Promise to
Mr. <HI>E—e,</HI> I wrote a Line to him, but, as I did not know what
Street I was in, I enquired of my Landlady, who with very great Re∣luctance,
told me, it was <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI> I was extremely concerned at this Piece of
Information, which she observed, and, as∣sured me, I might enquire into
her own, and her Husband's Character; that they had kept their Lodgings
empty, sooner than let them to any idle Person, though they could have had
a good Price for them; and a great deal more to the same effect; all which,
though I did most sted∣fastly believe, yet I held it no proper Place for
me, of all Persons in the World, to reside in.</P>
<P>Women whose Characters are unble∣mished, or, who have their
Husbands <PB N="161" REF="168"/> with them as Guardians to it, may do a
thousand Things, which those who have fallen on evil Days, and evil
Tongues, in Prudence must avoid.</P>
<P>I did not directly tell my Landlady that I must leave her, being
resolved, if pos∣sible, not to remove till I could find a Place where I
could be fixed.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I once more took my Way to <HI>St. James</HI>'s, and
called upon my old Landlady there: Her first Floor was let, but the second
being tolerably genteel, we, as we had always been on very friend-Terms, soon
made a Bargain for it, and I was to enter on it as soon as my Week for the
other was up. The very Air of <HI>St. James</HI>'s always pleased me, and
indeed I received so many Favours from the Nobili∣ty, that I had just
Cause to prefer it to any other Part of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This happened to be some public Festi∣val, which, as I did not
recollect, I sat with the good old Gentlewoman till Even∣ing, when on my
return Home, there was a large Bonfire, and a great Crowd at the 
<PB N="162" REF="169"/> Temple-Gate; I stopped a little, being star∣tled,
and not well knowing how to pass by, when an old Gentleman very well drest,
ask∣ed me where I was going? I told him, which was Truth, I had mistaken my
Way, being a Stranger: He said, if I'd let him know where I lived, he would
wait on me Home; I was almost ashamed to do it, yet, considering they
were creditable Peo∣ple where I lodged, I ventured to inform him. My Landlord
happened to be his Taylor, so he readily conducted me to his House; the
People saluted him, and ask∣ed him for his Lady and Family: Why, said he,
this is one of them, she is a near Relation to my Wife. I was surprized at
this new Kindred, and could not tell whether the old Gentleman spoke Truth or
not, though I could not recollect I had ever seen him be∣fore: yet, as the
Landlord treated him with the highest Respect, I thought it not con∣venient
to contradict him, so I invited him in, and wondered where this would
end!</P>
<P>My Landlady lighted us up to my Din∣ing-room; he told her, I had
dined at his <PB N="163" REF="170"/> House, and that after so long a Walk I
must needs be dry, and therefore desired her to get him a Bottle of Wine,
and a Plate of <HI>Scotch</HI> Collops from some particular Tavern he
directed her to.</P>
<P>As I found the old Gentleman did not stick at telling one Lye, I
concluded all he said was false, as it really was.</P>
<P>She no sooner departed, but he asked me, whether he was not an
able Politician? I said, he was a merry Gentleman, and I hoped as I had the
Honour of being his Cousin, he would let me know who he was, lest I
should be asked any cross Questions, and our Accounts should vary.</P>
<P>He told me his Name, and where he lived; that he had a
considerable Estate, and also a good Employment under the Government, all
of which did not make him happy, because Heaven had not blessed him with
a Child.</P>
<P>He then asked me who I was? for he said, he was sure I had had
a good Edu∣cation. As I had no reason to doubt of his Sincerity, I told him
my Story, with which he seemed much affected; and in <PB N="164" REF="171"/>
Conclusion, I assured him, I was more un∣happy in having Children, from
whom, in all probability, I was for ever separated, than he could be, who
never had one.</P>
<P>Here my Landlady brought in Supper, to which he invited her to
stay; our Con∣versation turned on general Topics; it grew pretty late, when
to my great Astonish∣ment, the Gentleman said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Cousin, I think you told me, you wanted Mo∣ney,
I have a good deal of your's in my Hands, though not much about me at
present; however, here are a couple of Guineas, when you want Fifty you know
where to come."</Q> Would I did, thought I, but it was no time for me to
refuse them.</P>
<P>When he went away, I knew not what to think of this odd Adventure,
sometimes I fancied it was a Dream, and dreaded to wake lest the Gold
should vanish; then I began to flatter myself, that perhaps some
Relation had left me a Legacy; but hav∣ing never since my Distress,
received the smallest Favour from one of them, I could hardly hope they
should now feel any com∣punctuous <PB N="165" REF="172"/> Visitings of
Nature, who were all to me, remorseless as the Sea.</P>
<P>In short, the more I thought, the more I was perplexed, and
could only humbly hope, that the protecting Hand of him who 
<Q> 
<L>—Doth the Raven feed,</L> 
<L>Yea, providentially catereth for the Spar∣row,</L> 
<L>Assisted me to live for some good End,</L> 
<L>Best to his Wisdom known.</L></Q> So recommending myself
to his paternal Care, who had Compassion on my Sor∣rows, I went to my
Repose.</P>
<P>Early next Morning the Woman of the House told me, there was a
Lady wait∣ing for me in the Dining-room; so I arose, and who should it
be, but my late odious Landlady!</P>
<P>My Reader may judge how welcome she was. She told me there was a
Gentle∣woman waiting for me at her House, who had Business of the
utmost Consequence, and very much to my Advantage to im∣part 
<PB N="166" REF="173"/> to me: Though I scarce gave Credit to her, yet
Curiosity made me accompany her Home, where I beheld a marvellous
ill-favoured old Woman; her Chin, which had on it a comely black Beard,
almost met her Nose, there not being a Tooth in the Way to bar their Union.
I am sure, had <HI>Don Quixote</HI> seen her, he would have endeavoured to
disenchant her Mustachio's. Her Eyes were black and fierce, her Back nobly
prominent, her Dress tawdry, and take her for all in all, I hope I never
shall look upon her Like again. I was doubtful whether it was not a Man in
Woman's Clothes; but if it were a Crea∣ture of the Feminine Gender, I concluded
it must be a Witch, and that the Study of the Black Art had made her so
hairy about the Face, that she had need of a Barber. But to proceed: She
accosted me very ci∣villy, in a deep <HI>Connaught</HI> Brogue, told me she
knew all my good Family, and lived in the same Parish with me in
<HI>Dublin</HI>; I soon grew tired of her fulsome Flattery to me and them,
and desired to know her Commands; she told me my Lord
<HI>G—l∣w—y</HI> <PB N="167" REF="174"/> had a great Regard for my
Fa∣ther, and was very desirous of seeing me,—and would be a Friend to
me: and if I would dine with her next Day, he would meet me: I now began to
guess at my Lady's Occupation, and gave her a point blank Denial; not but
that I should have been glad to see his Lordship, as I knew he had a
Regard for my Father; but a Woman must appear in a comtemptible Light, when
introduced to a Nobleman by one of the Devil's Agents. So I left Madam to her
Meditations, and departed, to her no small Discomfort, for it was a gol∣den
Guinea out of her Way; as it seems, my Lord's Price was two, one of which he
presented to Madam Procuress, and the other to the Lady who granted him a
Fa∣vour.</P>
<P>This infernal Embassadress had taken on her the Name of
<HI>Cunningham,</HI> being, as she said, ruined by a Gentleman of that
Name, who had recommended her to se∣veral of the <HI>Irish</HI> Noblemen,
as a very necessary Person. Oh how detestable it is 
<PB N="168" REF="175"/> to feed a Maw, or clothe a Back by such a filthy
Vice!</P>
<P>Well, at the appointed Time, I re∣turned to <HI>St. James</HI>'s,
and the first Day I was there, I was honoured with a Letter from Lord
<HI>G—lw—y,</HI> as follows; 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought I had had the Honour of be∣ing known to you, but
find I have been imposed upon; if you will permit me to pay my Respects to
you this Evening, I will unfold this Mystery to you, and am very
sincerely,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your most obedient Servant, G.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I returned my Compliments to his Lord∣ship, and gladly excepted
of the Honour of his Company.</P>
<P>About Six he came, and related to me the Trick Mrs.
<HI>Cunningham</HI> had put on <PB N="169" REF="176"/> him; he told me, he had
employed her to find me out, having a Curiosity to see a Person he had
so often heard of, both at <HI>White</HI>'s and in <HI>Ireland</HI>; that the
Appoint∣ment was made, and a Lady introduced to him, whom by his Description
of her, I knew to be the odious Mrs. <HI>Smith,</HI> my shocking
Landlady;—he said he was much disappointed when he saw her, but the
Lady was very kind; nay, so kind that he could not resist her.</P>
<P>As you stood at your Window this Morning, Colonel
<HI>D—ne—be</HI> asked me, knowing I was one of the
Commis∣sioners of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whether I knew you? I answered,
no:—Why, said he, that is a little <HI>Irish</HI> Muse, a
Physician's Daugh∣ter, and a Parson's Wife, an eloped one I have been told,
but she won't confess that; on this I asked your Name, the Colonel said
it was <HI>Pilkington,</HI> but you were usually called Mrs. <HI>Meade</HI>;
I then found I had been deceived, and wrote immediately to you.</P>
<P>I told his Lordship, I had the Honour of having many
Representatives, which <PB N="170" REF="177"/> had been of very great
Disadvantage to my Character, inasmuch as they were pretty liberal of their
Favours, which were placed to my Account, though I knew nothing of the Matter:
My Lord said, that was hard; but he hoped, now he had found the real Mrs.
<HI>Pilkington,</HI> she would not be inexorable. To turn off this Sort of
Dis∣course, I talked of public Affairs, which put my Lord in the Head of
making me pacquet Commissioner <HI>Th—mps—n,</HI> then
Candidate in the Election for the City of <HI>Y—rk,</HI> with old
<HI>English</HI> Rhymes, after the Manner of Mother <HI>Shipton</HI>'s
Pro∣phecies, to inform him of the Defeat he was to meet with in that Year. I
had the good Fortune to divert him with my co∣mical Stuff so well, that he
left me a Task, which was to translate a <HI>French Chanson à
boire</HI>; he gave me a couple of Guineas, and promising to be a frequent
Visitor, he took his Leave.</P>
<P>I do assure my Readers, I was very glad to be retained as his
Lordship's Muse and Secretary,—an Employment both of Honour and
Profit.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="178"/>I continued in Favour some Time; and we
bantered half the Nobility, either about their Love-Intrigues or Parliamentary
Af∣fairs, all of which were well known to his Lordship, who honoured me with
his Con∣fidence and Instruction.</P>
<P>But as all Happiness fades away, an un∣foreseen Accident
blasted mine.</P>
<P>My Lord was seized with a Fever, which confined him some Days;
the first Time he was able to go Abroad, he wrote me Word he would pass the
Evening with me. About his appointed Hour, somebody tapped at the Dining-room
Door, which I opened; when, instead of my Lord, en∣tered Colonel
<HI>D—nc—be</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sp—nc—r,</HI> whom the
Colonel pre∣sented to me, and made his <HI>Exit.</HI></P>
<P>This Nobleman was no more like his Brother than I to
<HI>Hercules,</HI>—for the first Thing he did was to double-lock the
Door, put the Key in his Pocket, and by main Strength oblige me to sit on his
Knee. I told him I expected Lord <HI>G—l∣w—y,</HI> but that had no
Effect, for he swore he should not have Admittance; he 
<PB N="172" REF="179"/> said he was as well entitled to a Lady's Favour as any
Lord: It was to no Purpose for me to assure him, my Lord never asked
any but what were consistent with Ho∣nour: He gave no Credit to my Words,
and seeing he had set me weeping, he said, my Lord was very happy in my
Love, but that he was not worthy of it, being an Inconstant; but as for me,
added he, I do not come to pay you one Visit, but to make you mine for ever,
to raise such Me∣rit above Distress, and to make you as happy as I
can.</P>
<P>Sir, returned I, your Goodness deserves my Acknowledgment, but
your Meaning seems doubtful; on what Terms am I to receive those
Advantages? On the easiest and sweetest in the World, said he, give
me your Love in return, it is all I wish; and running on with Lord
<HI>Hastings</HI>'s Speech in his Midnight Visit to poor <HI>Jane
Shore,</HI> he cried, 
<Q> 
<L>Be kind, my charming Mistress, to my Wishes,</L> 
<L>And satisfy my panting Heart with Beauty!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="180"/>It was in vain for me to remonstrate that
he had a fine young Lady of his own; that I was not worth the Pains he took;
that I was not handsome: He said, I pleased him, and that to him was
Beauty, which he was resolutely determined to possess, if not by
Consent, he would make use of Force.</P>
<P>And truly the Gentleman would soon have convinced me he was the
stronger, had not Lord <HI>G—lw—y</HI> knocked at the Door; he
swore I should not open it: My Lord called to me, and said he would break
the Door open. I begged of Mr. <HI>Sp—nc—r</HI> to permit me to let
him in, and that if he would stay a Moment, I would frame some handsome
Excuse to dis∣miss him.</P>
<P>He gave me the Key and went into the Bed-chamber; I opened the
Door for Lord <HI>G—lw—y,</HI> who brought with him the Earl of
<HI>M—dd—x,</HI> a fine Gentleman; Lord <HI>G—lw—y</HI>
was either very angry, or affected to appear so; and really I knew not what
Apology to <PB N="174" REF="181"/> make, only to say I had been asleep. The
Noblemen seated themselves, to the no small Vexation of Mr.
<HI>Sp—nc—r.</HI> Lord <HI>G—lw—y</HI> asked me who was
in the Bed-chamber? I said, Nobody;—well, Madam, said he, I know you
are a Lady of Veracity, but for once I presume to doubt it; so saying, he
made to the Door, which stood open, and Mr. <HI>Sp—nc—r</HI>
clapped it in his Face, doubled-locked it within-side, and to my great
Happiness, went out of another Door down Stairs; this I was very glad of,
be∣ing apprehensive of a Quarrel.—Lord <HI>G—lw—y</HI> was
in a violent Pas∣sion, and insisted on my telling him what Fellow, as
he called him, affronted him? So to satisfy him, I very ingenuously told
him the whole Story, to the infinite Mirth of Lord <HI>M—dd—x,</HI>
who, I thought, would have died with Laughter, for amongst other Accidents, I
had, in the Fray, lost a little <HI>Paris</HI> Cap I wore, and as my Hair was
very thick, never missed it.</P>
<P>But whatever I could say, would by no Means pacify Lord
<HI>G—lw—y</HI>; he <PB N="175" REF="182"/> called me twenty
ungrateful Devils and Jilts, and I know not what, which sur∣prized me the
more, as I never in my Life imagined he loved me, and consequently could not
form any Idea of his being jea∣lous; but I suppose, his Pride was piqued at
being locked out, which was the real Cause of his Resentment.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>M—dd—x</HI> in vain pleaded my Cause, till
at last, an odd Whim of his turned our Tragedy to a Farce.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>M—dd—x,</HI> it seems, liked an
<HI>Italian</HI> Singer, on whom Lord <HI>R—y∣m—d,</HI> a very
small Gentleman, with a Mind in Proportion to his diminutive Fi∣gure, had
wrote a very stupid Satire; he begged of me to write a Love-Letter to him,
for he was, it seems, a Man of Gal∣lantry, and his Answer I was to
commu∣nicate at <HI>White</HI>'s.</P>
<P>As I was a perfect Stranger to his Cha∣racter, the Nobleman
dictated a fine En∣comium on his Learning, Wit, Poetry, Beauty,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> all of which united, had, it seems, made a Conquest of me,
unheard, unseen, and made me extremely ambitious <PB N="176" REF="183"/> of
being known to so accomplished a No∣bleman; we also gave him some
Poetry, and a Direction where to find his most enamoured Nymph. This done,
the Letter was dis∣patched away to <HI>Bond-street,</HI> and the
Messenger brought Word I should have an Answer in the Morning.</P>
<P>I know whoever reads this, may very possibly censure me; but
all who are de∣pendant on the Favours of the Great, must comply with their
Whimsies; it is enough, if we are so conscientious as not to be made a
Slave to their Vices, as <HI>R—b—t N—g—t,</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> civilly asked me to be.</P>
<P>Now, as I have mentioned this Fellow, for such is the Term his
Behaviour to me merits, who am in this, in the same Mind with
<HI>Pope</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not mean a Fellow of T. C.
D.</NOTE>, That 
<Q> 
<L>Worth makes the Man, and want of it the Fellow;</L> 
<L>The rest is all but Leather and Prunella.</L></Q> I hope my
Reader will allow me to give them a short Sketch of him, with Regard 
<PB N="177" REF="184"/> to me, and also, of the Mortification I had the
Happiness of giving him.</P>
<P>My Father attended his first Wife, Lady <HI>E—ll—a
P—k—t,</HI> and, I had, I believe, passed twenty Evenings in
his Company in <HI>Dublin</HI>; he had published a Poem, written by the Rev.
Mr. <HI>Sterling,</HI> called <HI>Happiness,</HI> as his own, and another on
his Conversion from <HI>Popery,</HI> inscribed to <HI>W—m
P—y,</HI> now Earl of <HI>B—h,</HI> to whose Piety he was
indebted for his being drawn out of Error. This gave me a fine Opportunity of
paying him a Com∣pliment, which I sent to <HI>White</HI>'s; he sent me Word
he would wait on me that Eve∣ning; accordingly he came.</P>
<P>After his first Salutation, he very po∣litely asked me, if I
could help him to a W—, telling me, he had married an ugly old Devil for
Money, whom he hated, and wanted a Girl to take into Keeping, which he depended
on my Skill to chuse for him: I thanked him for the honourable Employment he
recommended to me, but assured him, it was not in my Power to serve him,
as I never conversed <PB N="178" REF="185"/> with Women. He told me, he would
not be a Friend to me on any other Terms; I said, I was sorry for it, so
making him a Reverence, I left the Room. He stayed in it some Time, hoping,
I suppose, I was gone of his Errand, but finding I did not return, he went
away; but to do him Justice, he left Half a Gui∣nea on the Table, as a
Recompence for the Affront he had given me.</P>
<P>He wanted, it seems, to be admitted as a Member of the Club at
<HI>White</HI>'s; their Way of Election is by ballotting, and one black Bean is
sufficient to overturn any Man's Pretension to that Honour. I told my Story
so effectually, that they all con∣cluded him unfit for Society, and as many
Friends as he imagined he had amongst three hundred Nobles, and, as vast a
For∣tune as his Wife had brought him, he had but one white Bean in the whole
Draught.</P>
<P>However, I return him Thanks for his Ten and Sixpence, to shew
my Gratitude.</P>
<P>But, to return to my little Lord <HI>R—ym—d.</HI>
Early next Morning, as I was drinking Tea, his Valet de Chambre 
<PB N="179" REF="186"/> said he must speak to me. I desired he might
come in; he was a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who, contrary to the rest of his
Country, was as boorish as an <HI>English</HI> Farmer; he threw down a
Letter on the Table, 
<Q REND="inline">"Dere, my Lord send a you dat;"</Q> I opened it,
and read as follows: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY your Stile you ought to be a Gen∣tlewoman; but I have met
with Things of this Kind, which did not an∣swer Expectation; I have sent my
Man to see you, whom I always trust, and so may you; if he likes you, and
you will come where I appoint, (for I never venture to visit any Woman) I
will meet you.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, 
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your's, R—YM—D.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="187"/>While I was perusing this gallant
Epistle, the <HI>Frenchman</HI> looked sharp about; he even opened the
Corner Cup∣board; then he demanded of me what did I want with his Lorde? I
could not resist my Inclination to laugh, at which he grew choleric, and
swore, Garzoon, he should never come; which, I being quite easy about, he
went away muttering some∣thing.</P>
<P>I sent his Letter, which was wrote in a very bad Hand, and
almost every Word mis-spelt, to Lord <HI>M—dd—x,</HI> who
shewed it to the Company at <HI>White</HI>'s, on whom it took the same
Effect it had done on me, for they all laughed heartily at
<HI>Jack-a-Dandy,</HI> a Nick-name Lord <HI>M—x</HI> had bestowed on
him.</P>
<P>These two merry Noblemen, who had set me on this Scheme, would
fain have prevailed on me to send another Letter to <HI>Jack-a-Dandy,</HI>
but I told them, I did not approve of a Man, governed by his Man, and one who
seemed to be a Coward into the Bargain; Lord <HI>M—dd—x</HI> then
<PB N="181" REF="188"/> me, Lord <HI>R—ym—d</HI> had some Reason
to be fearful how he made an Assignation, as he had once the Misfortune to
be taken in by a Billet-doux; and, when he went to the appointed Place,
instead of a fine Lady, found a Couple of sturdy Fellows, who gave him a
very good Cudgelling.</P>
<P>This put me in mind of a merry Story told me in <HI>London,</HI>
of Col. <HI>C—nn—m,</HI> who took Delight in paying his
Addresses to young Ladies, merely for Amusement; and no sooner did he
perceive he had gained their Affection, but he despised his Conquest.</P>
<P>As the Noblemen knew him, I related one Story to them, out of
many, of a pleasant Revenge a forsaken Nymph took on him.</P>
<P>This Lady was of exceeding good Birth, very well accomplished,
and of unblemished Reputation, but not of Fortune equal to his; however, he
seemed so fond, that she supposed that would be no Obstacle, and
intirely devoted herself to the Pleasure of loving him; which he no
sooner perceived, but he grew cold, civil, and respectful, 
<PB N="182" REF="189"/> and at last went to <HI>London,</HI> without so much
as bidding her Farewel.</P>
<P>Her Step-father, Brigadier <HI>V—s—y,</HI> having
some Call there, took his Lady and her Children with him, where, though
Miss <HI>A—t,</HI> for that was the Lady's Name, frequently saw the
Colonel at Court, he never took the least Notice of her, but seemed as
never acquainted: This, as we may presume, sufficiently grieved her, she
made her Complaint to a Female Confidante, a Lady of Quality, and a Wo∣man of
Spirit; between them they con∣trived, at least, to give his Vanity a
terri∣ble Mortification.</P>
<P>They wrote to him a Letter, as from a married Dutchess, who was
fallen in Love with him at Court; the Chairman had Di∣rections to wait for his
Answer, but they took Care that he should not be able to guess who sent
it;—all that the Colonel could discover was, that it was given to him
in the Street, and he was ordered to leave the Answer at a Mercer's, where it
would be safe delivered to the Person who wrote the Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="190"/>This Secrecy made him quite sure he had
gained the Heart of some high-born Fair; he failed not to send a
passionate and tender Return for so great an Honour as the unknown
Charmer had done him. The Ladies received it, and were glad to find the Gudgeon
swallow the Bait so gree∣dily. Next Night he took care to dress himself
with the utmost Magnificence; and, as he is really a graceful Person, he
made no doubt but the Lady would, by some favourable Glance, discover
herself to him; to this End, he went to Court, and strictly examined the
Countenance of every Lady of Quality there to no Purpose, which only made him
suppose the Lady extremely discreet, and careful of her Re∣putation.</P>
<P>His imaginary Mistress made several Appointments with him,
then sent him Word, her Lord was come to Town, or some Apology, 'till at
last, tired with their Sport, they resolved to finish it.</P>
<P>To this End, he received a Letter, that the Lady could not find
out any Place where she could, without Danger of Dis∣covery, 
<PB N="184" REF="191"/> meet him, except at his own House, but begged, that he
might not let any of his Servants be in the Way; that she would come in a
Chair, exactly at Ten, one small Tap at the Door being the Signal for
Happiness.</P>
<P>Never did Knight-Errant propose to himself more Glory in the
finishing of an Adventure, than did our happy Colonel at his near approaching
Bliss; he had framed to himself an Idea of a perfect Beauty, kind, tender,
and formed for Love; his Answer was all Rapture, and Acknow∣ledgment.</P>
<P>His Apartments were filled with Wax Lights, himself curled,
perfumed, and dressed to such Advantage; who could re∣sist that
beheld him? He punctually o∣beyed the Ladies Commands, in dis∣missing all
the Servants, with Orders not to appear, and waited the happy Minute, with the
Impatience of a real Lover; every Moment he looked at his Watch, and thought
the Hours, Ages.</P>
<P>At length the long wished for Signal was given, he flew to
receive the Fair-one, <PB N="185" REF="192"/> when a Porter delivered a Band-box
into his Hand, and, without speaking a Word to him vanished. Never was any
Man in greater Confusion than he, at opening it; he there found, not only all
his own soft Epis∣tles, but also a little Doll in a Chair, with a Letter
in her Hand, directed to him, the Purport of which, was, to let him know he was
a conceited Coxcomb, to suppose any Woman of Quality had the least
Re∣gard for him, and, that the Lady who held that, was a Mistress good
enough for him.</P>
<P>The Noblemen thanked me for my Narration, and wished the Trick
had been put on <HI>Jack-a-Dandy,</HI> such a Lady being a much more
suitable Match for him than the Colonel; however, we all agreed, that this
was no Tax on the Gentleman's Un∣derstanding, 
<Q> 
<L>Since, let a Man be ne'er so wise,</L> 
<L>He may be caught, with sober Lyes.</L></Q> And, that his
Appearance might captivate a Lady, without any Miracle.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>M—dd—x</HI> did me the Honour to
subscribe, and, assured me, he would pre∣vail <PB N="186" REF="193"/> on
as many of his Friends as he could, to do me the same Favour.</P>
<P>Next Day Colonel <HI>Duncombe</HI> asked me, did I know such a
Gentleman of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as <HI>L—ft—s H—e,</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; I said I did, particularly well, as my Brother and he
were inseparable Companions in the Col∣lege; he told me, there was a Parcel
of Letters freed by the Earl <HI>Thomond,</HI> then just dead, lying for him
at <HI>White</HI>'s, and, that he should be very glad to see him, to learn
some Account of the Particulars of Lord <HI>Thomond</HI>'s Death, with whom
he had for many Years a strict Friendship.</P>
<P>As I had learned by Accident where Mr. <HI>H—e</HI> lived, I
wrote to let him know what the Colonel said; he sent me a Letter of Thanks,
and, that he would do himself the Honour of meeting the Colonel the next
Evening at my Apart∣ment.</P>
<P>It so fortuned that my kind Benefactor Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> came
over with the Colonel, and a little after came Mr. <HI>H—e</HI>; his
Politeness, and the many pleasing Inci∣dents of our younger Days, gave me 
<PB N="187" REF="194"/> infinite Delight, as it was a Proof that I was not an
Impostor, and convinced the Auditors I had once been in Esteem, even in my
own Country.</P>
<P>After a good deal of agreeable Chat, wherein Mr.
<HI>H—e</HI> took an Opportunity of mentioning his having, when he was in
the College, spent his whole Year's Al∣lowance in making one grand Ball; and
that, as on this Occasion, he was in Dis∣grace with his own Father, he
quartered himself on mine, praising his elegant man∣ner of living, and the
kind Reception he always received from him, which as he said, he must ever
acknowledge to his Family; Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> said, he hoped, as I was the
only desolate Person belonging to it, he would be so good as to
assist me. He asked, how it was in his Power? Why, returned he, this
poor Lady is obliged to publish her Writings by Subscription, and I dare
say, a Gentleman of her own Coun∣try, who has so fine a Fortune, and knows
her so many Years, will, at least, be as kind as Strangers have been to
her: With∣out <PB N="188" REF="195"/> doubt, Sir, said Mr. <HI>H—e,</HI>
it is the Duty of every Gentleman to do it; so rising, he told me, he was
very sorry he was under an Engagement to the Duke of <HI>Devonshire,</HI>
but that he would take ano∣ther Opportunity of paying his Respects to me;
which same Opportunity, as he never found in <HI>London,</HI> I hope he will
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and have such a Dependance on his Honour, that I am
certain, he will keep it, in being my Friend.</P>
<P>As I had the Honour of being once a kind of a Favourite to
Alderman <HI>Barber,</HI> I judged him a very proper Person, both as he had
been a Printer, and was also a Man of considerable Interest, to apply to,
both to increase my Subscription, and to put me into a Method of getting my
Wri∣tings printed as cheap as I could; to this end, I wrote him a very
respectful Letter, but received no Answer; I followed it with a Second,
still he was silent; at length, I found a Method to make him speak to me,
for, recollecting the best Part of a very severe Satyr Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> had <PB N="189" REF="196"/> wrote on him, I let him know I
had it, on which he invited me to his House, re∣ceived me very kindly,
apologized for his Silence, being ill of the Gout, which had hindered him from
answering me; and as∣sured me, as soon as he was able to go abroad, he
would present me as a Compa∣nion to the Dutchess of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
who had promised to take one of his Recom∣mendation, and who, he said,
being in the Decline of Life, and having no Children, would, he was certain, if
I had the good Fortune to please her, remember me in her Will; but unhappily
for me the Al∣derman died a few Days after, nor did the Dutchess long
survive him.</P>
<P>So vanished my Hopes.</P>
<P>A short time after this Disappointment, which sensibly
affected me, my Landlady told me, there was an ugly squinting old Fellow, who
said he had Business of the utmost Consequence, and must speak to
me; I bid her shew him up, and found he answered her Description; he
asked me, was my Name <HI>Meade?</HI> I said, yes; why 
<PB N="190" REF="197"/> then, said he, I am come to inform you, that there is
a Legacy of five hundred Pounds left you by one Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> who died
last Week at <HI>St. Edmondsbury,</HI> but the Lady I was ordered to
inquire for is Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Wife; are you the Person? I told him
the Direction was very right, but that I neither was related to, nor even
ac∣quainted with any Person of the Name of <HI>Clark,</HI> from whom I had
the smallest Rea∣son to hope for such a Favour: Nay, Madam, returned
he, as you have changed your Name, why may not he? Upon this, he shewed me a
Letter, to my Fancy au∣thentic, wherein I was desired, if living, to wait on
Counsellor <HI>Clark</HI> in <HI>Essex-Street</HI> in the
<HI>Strand,</HI> who had Orders to pay me the Money, on Proof I was Mrs.
<HI>Pil∣kington.</HI></P>
<P>I knew not what to make of all this; I was in hopes the fickle
Goddess, who is well represented standing on a Wheel, was, for once, in a
good Humour with me, and was resolved to make me amends for her former
Caprice, or, to speak more seriously, that the Supreme Almighty Being,
that Power, who 
<Q><PB N="191" REF="198"/> 
<L>Builds Life on Death, on Change Du∣ration founds,</L> 
<L>And gives th' eternal Wheels to know their Rounds,</L></Q> had
taken Compassion on my Sufferings.</P>
<P>While I was lost in musing on this odd Adventure, the old
Fellow asked me very gaily, if I would give him my Company to
<HI>Richmond,</HI> and take a Dinner with him? I told him I never went abroad
with Per∣sons I did not know, especially Men; he told me, he was very
capable of being ser∣viceable to me, and that it was also in my Power to be
so to him; in what, Sir? Why, I have received from <HI>Ireland,</HI> from
your Husband, the Life of Alderman <HI>Barber,</HI> wherein there is an
Account of the Amours of <HI>Cadenus</HI> and <HI>Vanessa,</HI> to which
the Alderman was privy, and related them to Mr. <HI>P—n:</HI> Now I have
been informed you have some Letters of the Dean's, which may embellish the
Work; and also a true Character of the Alderman, written by his Chaplain; I
will make you <PB N="192" REF="199"/> a handsome Consideration for them, if
you will give them to me to publish.</P>
<P>This Discourse surprized me almost as much as the first;
I therefore begged he would not hold me any longer in Suspence, but let me
know who I conversed with? He answered his Name was <HI>Edmund Curl,</HI>
upon which, in spite of Vexation, and the Disappointment of my new-born
Hope, I could not forbear laughing at the fine Scheme he had laid, to trick me
out of any valuable Manuscripts I might possibly pos∣sess; so
making him a Courtesy, I said, Farewel, Legacy!</P>
<P>I should not trouble the Reader with this Story, but that I have
been charged with writing the Life of the Alderman; and, as I shall answer
it to God, I never even saw it in my Life, not but Curiosity would have
engaged me to read it, espe∣cially as I heard it was very well wrote; but at
the Time it was published, I was a Prisoner in the <HI>Marshalsea,</HI>
and really had not a Crown to spare for a Book.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Curl</HI> swore heartily, that his Letter, with
regard to the Legacy, was <PB N="193" REF="200"/> genuine, I went the next Day
to Coun∣sellor <HI>Clark</HI>; there was indeed an old Gen∣tleman of his name
newly dead, at <HI>St. Ed∣monsbury,</HI> who had Children and Grand∣children,
Heirs at Law, sufficient to in∣herit his Fortune, and, as it happened, he
died intestate.</P>
<P>However I comforted myself that Mr. <HI>Curl</HI> had not made a
Fool of me, as he has done of many a better Writer, and se∣cured me a
Prisoner in his poetical Garret, which the ingenious Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI>
charm∣ingly ridicules.</P>
<P>But oh the dismal Summer (which ever was attended with Want and
all it's gloomy Train, not only to me, but many Persons who seem in good
Circumstances) left me quite desolate, and obliged me to take a cheaper
Lodging, which I did in the House of one Mrs. <HI>Trifoli</HI> in
<HI>Duke-street, St. James</HI>'s, a most extraordinary painted up,
bedizened-out old Woman, whose Husband was a <HI>German</HI> Quack, not
then in <HI>England,</HI> from which, it seems his Wife had obliged him to
fly, for robbing her of a Deed of Settlement he had made to 
<PB N="194" REF="201"/> her at Marriage; but to say the Truth, I think that
was a Blessing to the poor Man, for she was a very Devil incarnate,
un∣merciful and cruel to the last Degree: I dare say, she never in her
Life gave even a Cup of Water or a Morsel of Bread, to keep a poor Creature
from starving!</P>
<P>Her Custom was to live upon her Lodgers, even when she knew
they were desolately poor, inasmuch, that if one of them sent but for a
Pint of Small-Beer, she would intercept it in the Way, and drink half of it;
but indeed she was very civil, for she always sent them Word she drank
their Healths, and so she did in reality, by depriving them of the Means of
pre∣serving it.</P>
<P>Being sadly distressed by this avaritious Wretch, I was
advised to apply to Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> who was a Man of Taste, and had
sixty thousand Pounds left him, to give in such Charities as he thought
proper. Ac∣cordingly I wrote him a moving Tale of my Distress, which had
so good an Effect, that he sent me Word he would wait on me himself the
next Day, but not keeping his Word, I addrest him in the following Lines: 
<Q><PB N="195" REF="202"/> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To Doctor <HI>MEAD.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SCARCE was the heavenly Virgin higher blest,</L>
<L>When visited by a coelestial Guest;</L>
<L>Hail'd by the glorious Messenger of Grace,</L>
<L>And honour'd high above the human Race,</L>
<L>Scarce stronger Rapture cou'd his Words impart,</L>
<L>Than those which lately extasy'd my Heart,</L>
<L>When You, God's noblest Image here below,</L>
<L>Your honour'd Presence promis'd to bestow;</L>
<L>My Hope reviv'd, I wak'd the silent String,</L>
<L>The Muse, once more, attun'd her Voice to sing,</L>
<L>Pleas'd, that tho' long deprest by adverse Fate,</L>
<L>She yet found Favour with the Good and Great,</L>
<L>And that her melancholy flowing Strain</L>
<L>To Gen'rous MEAD was not addrest in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh, Thou, the Muses Judge, the Muses Friend!</L>
<L>Say, must those Hopes in Disappointment end;</L>
<L><PB N="196" REF="203"/>Must ev'ry beauteous, bright Idea
fade,</L>

<P><PB N="197" REF="204"/>I sent these Rhymes to the Doctor, and,
in return, was desired to come to his House in <HI>Ormond-street,</HI> at
Four o'Clock that Afternoon.</P>
<P>Now were my Hopes high raised, high as the Spring Tide, to which
the Ebb quickly succeeds, as it did with me; I fancied, vainly fancied! at
least ten Guineas in my Pocket, and had, like the Man with his Basket of
Glasses, turned them into Trade, and purchased in my Mind an easy
Subsistence for Life; but I was a little mis∣taken in the Matter, as the
Sequel will shew. I dressed myself very neatly, and waited on the
Doctor; when I knocked at his Door, a Footman with his Mouth very full, and a
Bone in his Hand, opened it, and in an <HI>Irish</HI> Accent, demanded my
Business? I told him I wanted to speak to the Doctor: 
<Q REND="inline">"By my own Shoul, said he, my Maishter will
not be spoke to by Nobody!"</Q> Well then, Friend, if you please to let him
know Mrs. <HI>Meade</HI> is here, I believe he will speak to me: 
<Q REND="inline">"Mishtrish <HI>Maide,</HI> replied he, Arah,
are you vanting Charity, and taakes up my Maishter's Name to claim 
<PB N="198" REF="205"/> Kin with him; well, stay there, I'll tell him."</Q> So
he went into a back Par∣lour, but was quite confounded, when the Doctor
instantly came out, and gave him a severe Reprimand for letting me stand
in the Hall; and I am very certain, had I thought it worth my While to have
ac∣quainted the Docter with his Insolence, he would have been discharged. A
proper Caution to Livery-wearing Fellows to speak with Civility to every
Body.</P>
<P>The Doctor shewed me into a handsome Street-parlour, adorned
with several Curio∣sities, of which here needs no Account: He asked me for
Sir <HI>John Meade,</HI> whom, because he remembered, he expected I should,
though he died two Years before I was born; when I told him so, he seemed
displeased: And really I remember that good Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> in his
pleasant Way, scolded me once for not remembering King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
though my Father was born in the Reign of King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>As my Answers to the Doctor, with re∣lation to the whole Family
of the <HI>Meades,</HI> were sufficient to convince him I was not an 
<PB N="199" REF="206"/> Impostor, he asked me how he could serve me? I told
him I had some Poems to publish, but for Want of a little Money to pay for
the Printing of them, I could not proceed: 
<Q REND="inline">"Poems, returned he; why, did you ever know any
Person get Mo∣ney by Poetry?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">Yes, Sir, several; Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in
particular:"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh Lud, Lud, (said he, grinning horribly, and
squinting hideously) what Vanity thou hast! can you write like him?"</Q>
I was quite abashed, and really knew not what to say for some Moments,
for my Reader may easily perceive, I could not but be sensible I had made
a foolish Speech, un∣aware to myself; however, upon Recollec∣tion, I
assured him, I did not presume to put myself in any Degree of
Comparison with so justly an admired Writer, but that perhaps, on Account
of my Sex, I might find a little Favour,</P>
<P>Well said he, there are a Couple of Gui∣neas for you: This,
though far short of my Expectations, was a little present Relief, and as
the Gentleman was under no Obliga∣tion <PB N="200" REF="207"/> to reward or
encourage me, I very gratefully accepted of them, and yet 
<Q> 
<L>Proud was the Muse I serv'd, unbred to wait</L> 
<L>A willing Stranger at a Great Man's Gate!</L></Q></P>
<P>And here gentle Reader, give me Leave to trespass a Moment on
your Patience, to make one Remark, which is, that, amongst all the Persons
who are celebrated for be∣ing charitable, I never met one really so; and the
most humane and beneficent are those whose Characters have been so
at∣tacked for their Humanity, that at last they have even been ashamed of
well-doing.</P>
<P>I remember Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> told me, he saw a Beggar attack at
Bishop, who charitably from his Abundance, spared him a Half∣penny, and
said, God bless you; presently after he attacked Brigadier
<HI>Groves,</HI> who threw Half a Crown to him, and bade G—d d—m
him; which, said he, do you think the Beggar prayed for at Night?</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="208"/>But as I have mentioned Dr. <HI>Meade,</HI>
who was so much in Love with Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> for saying, 
<Q> 
<L>And Books for <HI>Meade,</HI> and Rarities for
<HI>Sloane,</HI></L></Q> I think I must give them also a Sketch of Sir
<HI>Ha—s,</HI> to whom the Doctor advised me to apply, as an Encourager
of Arts. I travelled down to <HI>Chelsea</HI> to wait upon him; it snowed
violently, insomuch that I, who had only a Chintz Gown on, was wet to the
Skin: The Porter, <HI>memoran∣dum,</HI> better bred than his Master, to whom
I had sent up a Compliment, which, as he did not deserve, I shall not do
him the Ho∣nour to insert, invited me into his Lodge, where, after about two
Hours Attendance, I was at length permitted to enter to his Supreme Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty; but sure the Pope him∣self,
in all his pontifical Robes, never was half so proud. I was conducted by an
Es∣cort thro' six or seven Rooms, one of which was entirely
wainscotted, if I may so term it, with China; but like the Idol to whom 
<PB N="202" REF="209"/> a stately Temple was consecrated, which a Traveller,
attracted by it's outward Mag∣nificence, thought to find an adorable Deity in,
and on Search, found a ridiculous Monkey; so I saw an old Fellow, whom I am
very well convinced never saw me, for he did not even vouchsafe to turn his
Eyes off a Paper he was writing, to see who came in, till at last a
Beggar-Woman entered, with a sore eyed Child; the In∣side of whose
Eyelids he very charitably tore out with a Beard of Corn, under which cruel
Operation the Girl fainted, but he said that was good for her: It may be
so, for by two-headed <HI>Janus,</HI> Nature has fra∣med strange Doctors in
her Time. 
<Q> 
<L>Some, who will bid us live on Pulse, and Water;</L> 
<L>And others of such Vinegar Aspect,</L> 
<L>They would not wag their Jaws in Way of Smile,</L> 
<L>Tho' <HI>Nestor</HI> swore the Jest were
laugh∣able.</L></Q> <PB N="203" REF="210"/> Of this latter Sort was Sir
<HI>H—ns.</HI> Tho' I had sent him up a Letter which lay before him, he
asked me what I wanted? if I had bad Eyes he said he would brush them up
for Charity; but as they happened to be tolerably good, I excused myself,
by tel∣ling him I had brought him that Letter; and indeed I was quick-sighted
enough to find out, that his Honour (as the Beggar-woman called him) was a
conceited, ridi∣culous, imperious old Fool.—He then considered my
Letter over, and finding by the Contents, Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> had recommended me
to him, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Poor Creature! I sup∣pose you want Charity;
there is Half a Crown for you."</Q> I could hardly resist a strong
Inclination I had to quoit it, as <HI>Falstaff</HI> says, into his Face,
like a Three-penny Shovel-groat; and was only con∣strained by the
Consideration, that I had never a Shilling in my Pocket, and that, little as
it was, I could eat for it.</P>
<P>I have here done with the Great Sir <HI>H—ns
Sl—ne,</HI> B—r— of <HI>O—k—m,</HI> and return to
Dr. <HI>Meade.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="211"/>I had forgot to tell my Readers, that
re∣juicing at my Success, when I returned from his House I threw the two
Guineas up, and had the Misfortune to lose one in a Chink of the Room; the
Board my Land∣lady would never permit me to remove, lest, as she said, I
should spoil her Floor. This trivial Accident gave me a great deal of
Uneasiness, as it put me out of Power of paying, and quitting her according
to my Intention.</P>
<P>However, as I was obliged to live by my Wits, which indeed were
almost at an End; I formed a Scheme to write a Pane∣gyric on
<HI>P—p</HI> Lord <HI>H—k,</HI> then newly created L—d
H—h C—r of <HI>E—d.</HI> I did not address him in the
Manner I had done a great many of the Nobility, that is with my one Poem, which
I sent all round, like the Bishop's Pastoral Letter; it was, as
<HI>Swift</HI> says, 
<Q> 
<L>—In another Reign,</L> 
<L>Change but the Name, 'twill do again.</L></Q> I wrote a fire
new one for himself, which was really paying him a higher Compliment 
<PB N="205" REF="212"/> than he deserved, as my Readers may per∣ceive
hereafter. I had compleated the Poem, and sent it to him; he desired me to
come to him on <HI>Sunday,</HI> that being his only leisure Time.—</P>
<P>Accordingly, I waited on him at Eight o'Clock on <HI>Sunday</HI>
Morning; the House had rather the Appearance of Desolation and Poverty,
than that of the L—d Ch—ll—r of <HI>Br—n:</HI> He had
Complai∣sance enough to send his Mace-Bearer to keep me Company, till
such time as a Pair of Folding-doors flew open, and my Lord appeared in his
Robes, ready to go to Church; he bowed down to the Ground to me, and asked me
if I would drink a Dish of Chocolate with him? which you may not doubt I
accepted of; and was surprized to find myself, though sunk in the most
abject Poverty, sitting with so great a Man!</P>
<P>So, for my Labour, I got a Dish of 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mem. Chocolate,</HI> a Word used by
a very emi∣nent Comedian, one Mr. <HI>Foote,</HI> for Satire.</NOTE>Chocolate,
which I now return, with the <PB N="206" REF="213"/> utmost Humility, to his
L—d—p again.</P>
<P>So, my Lord went to Church, where I also went; I there saw
Doctor <HI>Meade,</HI> who, perceiving his Lordship made me a low Bow, made
one four times as low; and I could very hardly refrain laughing at them both,
and thinking 
<Q> 
<L>—That all this World's a Stage, and</L> 
<L>All the Men and Women merely Actors;</L></Q> And that 
<Q> 
<L>If ev'ry just Man, that now pines with Want,</L> 
<L>Had but a moderate, and beseeming Share</L> 
<L>Of that, which lewdly pamper'd Luxury</L> 
<L>Now heaps upon some Few, with vast Excess;</L> 
<L>Nature's full Blessings would be well dis∣pens'd</L> 
<L>In unsuperfluous even Proportion,</L> 
<L>And she no Whit encumber'd by her Store:</L> 
<L>And then the Giver would be better thank'd,</L> 
<L><PB N="207" REF="214"/>His Praise due paid; for swinish
Glut∣tony</L> 
<L>Ne'er looks to Heav'n, amidst his gorgeous Feast;</L> 
<L>But, with besotted base Ingratitude,</L> 
<L>Crams, and blasphemes his Feeder.</L> 
<BIBL>Milton's Comus.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Well, I could find no Remedy for the Consumption of my Purse,
nor borrow, to linger out the Disease, any where, but from the Pawnbroker;
but he was always cha∣ritable.</P>
<P>However, I concealed my Distress with the utmost Care from
my Landlady; called every Morning for the Teakettle, though I had no
Tea;—then I said I was enga∣ged to dine abroad, and took a solitary
Walk to <HI>Westminster-Abby,</HI>—and ranged the solemn Isles
alone, envying those who rested in Peace from their Labours; till, at
last, having been three Days and three Nights without Food of any kind,
Heaven pardon me! a melancholy Thought came into my Head, that it was better to
die at once, than die daily; and that, as I could <PB N="208" REF="215"/> not
Fardles bear, it was best to make my own <HI>Quietus,</HI> and no longer
strive to keep up a frail and feverish Being: And here, indeed, I own, I
had been unmindful of the Crown which Virtue gives, 
<Q> 
<L>After this mortal Coil, to her true Ser∣vants.</L></Q>
Despair vanquished me quite; nay, so art∣ful was the Enemy, as even to
persuade me, I had a Right to dispose of my own Life, especially when
there did not seem, even a Possibility of preserving it. Filled with
gloomy Ideas, I took my usual Walk, and took notice of the Corner, between
the Monuments of <HI>Shakespear</HI> and <HI>Rowe,</HI> where I wished to
be interred, and that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Lines, 
<Q> 
<L>How lov'd, bow honour'd, once avails me not,</L> 
<L>To whom related, or by whom begot;</L> 
<L>An Heap of Dust alone remains of me,</L> 
<L>'Tis all I am, 'tis all the Proud shall be.</L></Q> 
<PB N="209" REF="216"/> might be my Epitaph. I really found room for Meditation,
even to Madness.</P>
<P>In this Temper I went into <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> and
seated myself by <HI>Rosamond</HI>'s Pond; the Moon, apparent Queen,
un∣veiled her peerless Light, and I waited in the silent Shade, resolved
to execute my dreadful Purpose, as soon as I could do it without
Observation, when a young Lady, and an old one, both very well dressed,
seated themselves by me; they, in an ele∣gant Stile began to praise the
sweet and solemn Beauties of the Moon-light Scene, the Winds gently
whispered through the fragrant Lime-trees, just then in full Flower; and,
indeed, though they were not vernal Airs, they might have dissipated all
Anguish, but Despair: Finding, that not∣withstanding my Taciturnity, the
Ladies would enter into Conversation with me, I could not, in Point of good
Breeding, re∣fuse to return them Answers, with as much Politeness, as I
was Mistress of, till at length, we were so pleased with each other,
that Time insensibly flying, we found we were locked into the
<HI>Park</HI>; but the Ladies, <PB N="210" REF="217"/> whose Garden opened
into it, insisted on my accompanying them to Supper.</P>
<P>We were let in at a Back-door, by a Servant in Livery, to a very
genteel House, where, on a Sopha, sat a very handsome Man in a Gold
Brocade Night-Gown, to whom the young Lady presented me, and said, he was
her Spouse; the Cloth was ready laid, and a cold Supper on the Table: I would
very fain have pre∣vailed on the Lady to permit me to go through her House
home, for I could ea∣sily perceive the Gentleman's Civility was quite forced,
and, that he was impatient to revenge on his Wife the Liberty she had taken
of inviting a Stranger in; which in∣deed, I believe, she did on no other
Ac∣count, but, that she thought Decency would prevent him from giving her a
Beating, of which, it seems, he was very liberal, though he was but a Footman
when the Lady married him, and threw herself, and twenty thousand Pounds
away upon him, as I afterwards learned.</P>
<P>But, as the late Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> ob∣served, when he
was told a Maid of Ho∣nour, <PB N="211" REF="218"/> who was very handsome, was
in Love with him, notwithstanding he was an old Hump-back'd Man, but one of
in∣finite Wit, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Faith, it may be so, Women have strange
Fancies!"</Q></P>
<P>I, though foodless, never spent three Hours more
disagreeably, especially, as this House brought back to my Mind, the Fear
and Terror I always felt in Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s, to which, if my Father,
Mother, or any Friend came, it threw me into Agonies, being well assured,
they would never de∣part without receiving some gross Affront, such as
the two following Stories, trivial as they are, may serve to
illustrate.</P>
<P>One <HI>Alhallow</HI>'s Eve, a Night of Plea∣sure and Disport
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> among the young Maidens and Batchelors, my Brother and
Sister, who had invited some Persons, agreeable to their own Age, to
celebrate it with them, very fairly begged of us, old Folks, to go abroad; to
oblige them, and myself also, I begged of Doctor <HI>Delany,</HI> who dined
with us, and my Father and Mother, to come home with me, and try 
<PB N="212" REF="219"/> if we could not be as chearful as they: I no sooner
proposed the Scheme than they all agreed to it. As my Father was no
Supper-Man, I had ordered a Custard to be made for him, and having a
barnstable Oven, it was put into it to bake.</P>
<P>While we were amusing ourselves in a∣greeable Chat, entered
Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> like the Description of Winter, 
<Q> 
<L>Striding the gloomy Blast!</L></Q> and observing a Smoak,
occasioned by the lighting of the Oven, he descended to ex∣amine the
Contents thereof, found the Custard, eat most part of it, and sent the
Remainder out of Doors, telling us to our Faces, we should not liquor our
Chops at his Expence; though, <HI>memorandum,</HI> my dear Father always sent
his Supper and Wine before him, whenever he vouchsafed us the Honour of a
Visit.</P>
<P>The second Instance of my Spouse's Good-nature, was, that
though he had no less than thirteen Hens, he, knowing I liked a new-laid Egg
for my Supper, watched <PB N="213" REF="220"/> the Hen-roost close, and
every Egg was in a Basket sent to the Widow <HI>W—rr—n,</HI>
covered with a Damask Napkin, of which she got no less than eighteen
given to me by Brigadier <HI>Meade</HI>: At length, one Even∣ing, when my
Husband was abroad, my Brother and Sister came to visit me; when the
Clock struck Ten, I concluded Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> would not come home to
Supper, and I had the Impudence to eat two Eggs; they were scarce down when
he came in, my Brother had sent for a Bottle of Wine, and invited his
Reverence to drink a Glass, but 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mem.</HI> He says, in one of his
Letters, that the Nobility scorned me, and my vile Insinuations and
Impudence.</NOTE>he scorned us and our vile Insinuations; and as he always
kept an exact Reckoning for his Poultry, he very magisterially or∣dered his
Eggs to be got ready; this was a Thunder-clap to me; however, as it was in vain
to attempt to hide my Guilt, I was forced to confess the horrid Fact; upon
which he stood aghast, as though he had seen Church-yards yawn, and Hell
itself breathe forth Contagion to the World.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="221"/>What, said he, did you eat my black Hen's
Egg? Could not any other satisfy your dirty Guts? I wish the Devil was in
the Egg, and that it had choaked you.</P>
<P>I answered, he had preferred his chari∣table Wish too late;
and, lest it should take any Effect, I drank a Glass of my Bro∣ther's
Wine, that I might digest all toge∣ther.</P>
<P>Oh, let the World judge how happy I was! But to return.</P>
<P>Though my <HI>Park</HI> Adventure had di∣verted the Execution of
my sad Scheme for one Evening, yet, as it had brought me no Relief, I still
kept my Purpose, and resolved to fulfil it the next: To this End, I came
and sat in the same Place; I made several Attempts to throw myself in,
and still, when I came near the Water, the Fear of something after Death
puzzled the Will; I examined my Heart strictly, to know what gross Offence
I had ever committed, that it should 
<Q> 
<L>Please Heav'n to try me with Afflictions,</L> 
<L>To steep me in Poverty up to the very Lips;</L> 
<L><PB N="215" REF="222"/>Give to Captivity me and my utmost
Hopes.</L></Q> For, had I ever refused my Morsel to the Hungry, or ever
filled the Widow's Eyes with Tears, I should not wonder at it. Quite lost
in these melancholy Reflec∣tions, I was waked as from a Dream, by a very well
dressed Gentleman, who tapped me on the Shoulder, and said, Lord, can
this be Mrs. <HI>Pilkington?</HI> I looked at him earnestly, and recollecting
I had seen his Face before, answered, it was all the Re∣mains of her that
was Mrs. <HI>Pilkington.</HI> May I presume, Madam, to ask, on what
Intention you are sitting her? I fancy he perceived by my Looks the
Disorder of my Soul, which, I believe, was strongly pictured there. I
begged he would leave me to myself—But he insisted on my going
along with him to the <HI>Royal Vineyard,</HI> which was not far off—it
was in vain to refuse him, he would take no Denial. When we were got about
half way, I very se∣riously demanded of him, who he was? He answered, he
was Capt. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who had <PB N="216" REF="223"/> once the Honour of
seeing me at my Uncle <HI>Van Lewen</HI>'s in <HI>Cork,</HI> and who should
think himself very happy, if it was any way in his power to serve me. We
got a cold Fowl and some Ham, of which I eat a little, and took a Glass or
two of <HI>Cham∣paigne,</HI> and I found it revive me very much. We then fell
into Discourse, and I very sincerely related to him my unhappy Situation,
and the Peril his Appearance had delivered me from. My Story affected him so
much, that it drew Tears from him.</P>
<P>After we had regaled ourselves, it grow∣ing late, we left the
<HI>Park,</HI> and he was so kind to see me to my Lodging; where, putting a
couple of Guineas into my Hand, we parted, and he promised to see me next
Morning; but I saw him no more.</P>
<P>I am sure, when Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> comes to this part of my
Story, he will wish the Gentleman had been buried, sooner than he should
do him so ill an Office, as that of saving my Life; but I, among other
things, was born to let the World see, what the Inside of a Priest is
made of; 
<Q><PB N="217" REF="224"/> 
<L>Prompt, or to stab, or saint, to save, or damn;</L> 
<L>Heav'n's <HI>Swiss,</HI> who fight for any God, or Man!</L> 
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></Q> Take notice, I always except the good and
valuable part of the Clergy, whom nobody more highly respects and honours
than I sincerely do; for when they possess, like <HI>Berkley,</HI>
every Virtue under Heaven, who can refuse it?</P>
<P>I once more began to believe myself un∣der the Favour and
Protection of the Al∣mighty; as his Hand, though to me in∣visible, visibly
led me through various Mazes, perplexed with Error; and deter∣mined, whatever
Sufferings he was pleased to inflict, to bear them with Resignation, and
never permit them to triumph over a Christian Faith.</P>
<P>And a severe and cruel Trial of my Constancy I quickly
experienced; there was a young Woman, who lodged in the Gar∣ret, whom I not
only to the utmost of my Power supported, as she was my Country-woman, 
<PB N="218" REF="225"/> and in great Distress, but also as she said
she was related to the Lord <HI>Powerscourt</HI>; her Maiden Name, as she
told me, was <HI>Craggs</HI>; his Lordship may better know whether this was
true or false, than I can presume to do; however, I had often made her a
Confidante to my Distress, which she as constantly revealed to my
in∣exorable Landlady; who one Day, pre∣tending great Compassion, told me
what a Snake I harboured in my Bosom, and said, as she had learned from
her, that I had se∣veral valuable Things in Pawn, she would release them,
and keep them in her own Hands, till such time as I could pay her the Trifle
I owed her. I thought this a kind Offer, and with great Acknowledg∣ment
accepted of it: Oh! what a Fool was I, to suspect such a <HI>Jew</HI> of
any Remorse? I gave her a Line to the Pawnbroker, em∣powering her to receive
whatever he had of mine, and out of my two Guineas paid her one. She laid out
two Guineas, took the Goods into her own Hands, and, e'er she came Home, took
out a Writ against me, for the Money she had paid for them.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="226"/>This was on a <HI>Friday</HI>; it rained
exces∣cessively all Day, to which I attributed both her staying, and
the extreme Low∣ness and Dejection of Spirit I laboured un∣der: I called to
Mrs. <HI>Craggs</HI> to bear me Company; but, as she had told my Chri∣stian
Name to my Landlady, in order to have me properly arrested, she did not
think convenient to come to me.</P>
<P>At length the old Beldam returned, and, in a merry way, asked
me, Did not I think she had run away with my things? I answered,
no—they were not worth her while. She complained of being very dry; upon
which I was weak enough to treat her with some Porter.</P>
<P>My Reader will please to observe, I was at this time employed
in writing a Tragedy, called, <HI>The Roman Father,</HI> from the Story of
<HI>Virginius</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> two Acts of which I had finished;
but, as at the same time there were two bad Plays wrote on that Subject, I
did not think pro∣per to go on with it; it was lying on my Window; and after
some Chat with the <PB N="220" REF="227"/> old Woman, being very much
depressed in Spirit, I went to Bed.</P>
<P>Early next Morning, to my no small Surprize, entered a Couple of
ill-favoured Fellows, the Sight of whom struck Terror to my Soul. I demanded
their Business; one of them answered, 
<Q REND="inline">"Get up, you <HI>Irish</HI> Papist Bitch, and
come along with us."</Q> The other, who had employed himself in looking over
my Papers, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, the <HI>Irish</HI> Whore, here is
something a∣bout some <HI>Roman</HI> Father, that's the Pope, and be damn'd
to you, is it?"</Q> I was for some time quite speechless, but, when I
recovered Strength enough to speak, I begged of them to leave the Room, till
I put on my Clothes; but my Landlady coming in at that instant, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"You're damn'd modest;—don't quit the
Place:"</Q> The Fellows, who had more Decency than she, looked out at the
Window, while I dressed myself, in which Time my Agony was inconceivable;
they called a Coach, and thrusting me into it, conveyed me to the House of
an Officer of Mace at <HI>Cha∣ring-cross</HI>; as I happened to have a
Gui∣nea <PB N="221" REF="228"/> in my Pocket, I called for a Room and a Pint of
Wine, and then considered, if I had one Friend I could apply to: My dear Mr.
<HI>Cibber</HI> was out of Town, as were likewise most of the Nobility;
however, I saw young Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> go by the Window, and sent to him,
but like all the World, when he heard my Condition, he would not come near me.
My whole Debt was Forty Shillings; O, what could I do but give my Tears Vent!
which was my only Relief; and next Day, after paying twenty Shillings, I was
conveyed to the <HI>Marshalsea</HI> Prison. I sat withinside of the
Lodge for some Minutes quite stupified; till at length a Man came, and
asked me, if I was a Prisoner, which, it seems, he did not be∣fore know;
I told him I was, upon which he brought me into a Room, where a Par∣cel of
Wretches seized me, and sung a long Song about Garnish, and were going to
pull my Clothes off, till a Servant, who had seen me before, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"For God's sake don't use Dr. <HI>Meade</HI>'s
Wife ill:"</Q> Upon this a most ugly Woman came up, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"G—d d—n you, you B—h, do you 
<PB N="222" REF="229"/> pretend to be Dr. <HI>Meade</HI>'s Wife?—I am his
Wife."</Q> I begged to be heard, which was granted; I told her my Name was
<HI>Meade,</HI> and my Husband a Clergy∣man in <HI>Ireland.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh, that's a different Case, said she,
going off."</Q> They were kind enough to take my Word for some Drink; and a
good decent Woman said, she would accept of me for a Chum, as they call it.
She brought me into a little dirty Apartment, where, without examin∣ing any
thing, I in Despair threw myself down on a Bed I saw there, and
resolved never to rise again. Three Days and Nights past, during which
Time I never tasted Food of any sort. At length the Companion of my
Misery pressed me to take a little Refreshment, which I was
per∣suaded do; and seeing so many People in my own Condition, at length
reconciled me to think of making myself as easy as possible; and leave
myself to the Disposi∣tion of Divine Providence. One Morning a Friend
came to visit me, by whom I sent a Letter to Dr. <HI>M—de,</HI>
telling him my Distress, and, among other Things, these Lines: 
<Q><PB N="223" REF="230"/> 
<L>CAN, alas! the plaintive Pray'r,</L> 
<L>Dictated by Grief sincere,</L> 
<L>Hope to reach a friendly Ear:</L> 
<L>Will thy kind and bounteous Heart</L> 
<L>Sympathize while I impart</L> 
<L>Such Affliction, as before</L> 
<L>Never hapless Woman bore.</L></Q></P>
<P>I made no doubt but I should be re∣lieved, and waited
impatiently for the An∣swer, which was as follows: 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mrs. <HI>MEADE</HI> in the
<HI>Marshalsea.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Ormond-street, 
<DATE>October 16, 1742.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have so many Applications for Cha∣rity, that it is
impossible for me to re∣lieve all; those from your Country alone are very
numerous: The Family of the <HI>Meades</HI> there are very rich, and should
take care of their needy Branches; I have, for the last Time, sent you a
Guinea.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Your humble Servant, <HI>R.
M.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="231"/>I kept the Original of this by me, with a
Resolution, when I should these unlucky Deeds relate, not to omit it.
This was soon gone, I had many to satisfy: I then wrote to <HI>Henry
Furnese,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who in a polite manner sent me a Guinea,
which doubled the Obligation; 
<Q> 
<L>For, oh! believe me, 'tis a dreadful Task,</L> 
<L>To generous Minds, to be compell'd to ask;</L> 
<L>More dreadful still to have a Suit deny'd,</L> 
<L>Or take a niggard Alms, giv'n with Con∣tempt and
Pride.</L></Q> I was by this supported till my dear Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> came
to Town, who was no sooner acquainted with my Misfortune, than he sent me a
Guinea all changed into Six-pences, lest it should tempt some one to pick
my Pocket; this was an Instance of singular Humanity; but he has often
said, when he did good to People in Distress, it was only to ease his
own Mind, which would other∣wise have been on the Rack: Oh, Heavens! what
innate Goodness must dwell in that Breast?</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="232"/>Seeing the Woman, that accused me for
being the Doctor's Wife, lying dead drunk in the Puddle, I asked my
Companion, who she was? Madam, I'll tell you, said she: She was a Servant
to Dr. <HI>M—de,</HI> who had a Child by her, and supported her in his
House for some time; at length they parted, and he was to allow her five
Guineas a Week: But the Doctor marry∣ing his present Lady, began to be
remiss in his Payments, which enraged Madam to such a Degree, that,
forgetting Decency, she went to his House, and, in Presence of all his
Servants, abused and exposed him to the utmost of her power.</P>
<P>Upon this the Doctor stepped into his Chariot, and ordered it to
drive to her Lodging, where finding she was indebted to her Landlord, one Mr.
<HI>Bradst—t,</HI> famous for being a Spy for the D— of
<HI>C—,</HI> he desired him to arrest, and put her in Jail. This
artful Fellow al∣ledged, it would be very expensive; but the Doctor having
Charity-money enough to supply such Exigencies, said, he valued not the
Expence, so she was secured. Upon <PB N="226" REF="233"/> this the poor
Wretch was arrested, and thrown into Jail; and from time to time
<HI>Bradst—t</HI> got three hundred Pounds of the Doctor for keeping
her there; till at length the Doctor growing weary of the Expence, consented
to her Releasement; but she had so entirely devoted herself to
drinking, that she died a few Days after she obtained her Liberty.</P>
<P>And so let this be booked among other of his good Works, such
as combing the Ladies Heads, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I think it is a great Pity that every cha∣ritably disposed
Person is not his own Al∣moner, since it is a thousand to one, whe∣ther
that which was intended to help the Distrest and Innocent, is not applied
to the Service of LUXURY and VICE! I am sure, to my own Knowledge, in
several Instances it has been so by the D-ct-r, who has many Affairs of
the same Nature on his Hands; and, to quote his favourite Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>Now, in such Exigencies, not to need,</L> 
<L>Upon my Word, you must be rich indeed,</L> 
<L><PB N="227" REF="234"/>A noble Superfluity it craves,</L> 
<L>Not for yourself, but for your Whores and
Knaves!</L></Q></P>
<P>I remember, twenty Years ago, to have heard Dr. <HI>Delany</HI>
say from the Pulpit, it was a glorious thing for a Man to be his own
EXECUTOR: I dare say, he never preached but what he practised; and, ex∣cept
that eternal Treasure, which he has wisely laid up in store, where
neither Moth nor Rust can corrupt, nor Thieves break thro' and steal:
Whenever he comes to pay his Mortal Debt—which Hour be far
away!—all he will have left on this side of a blessed and glorious
Immortality, will be a Shower of Orphans and of Wi∣dows Tears, to bedew the
consecrated Earth, where his honoured Remains shall rest in Peace, till
summoned to partake of that Bliss, prepared by the Almighty be∣fore all
Worlds, for Souls like his.</P>
<P>As I have frequently observed to my Readers, that I was glad to
run away from such a disagreeable Theme as my Misfor∣tunes, I hope for
their Pardon, though I <PB N="228" REF="235"/> am obliged to return to them
again, and give them an Account even of so dismal a Place as a Jail.</P>
<P>Our Head-Turnkey happened to have been a Servant to Alderman
<HI>Barber</HI>; and, like <HI>Joseph,</HI> I found Favour in the Sight of my
Keeper, as he had seen me in better Days. 
<Q> 
<L>For, <HI>Certes,</HI> I had look'd on better Days,</L> 
<L>And had with holy Bell been knoll'd to Church,</L> 
<L>And sat at good Men's Feasts, and wip'd the Eye</L> 
<L>Of Drops, which sacred Pity had en∣gender'd.</L></Q> This
Man took great Compassion on me, and as on every <HI>Friday,</HI> which is
Court-day, the Prisoners are all locked up in their re∣spective Apartments,
lest, when the Gates are thrown open for the Admission of the Judge and
Lawyers, any of them should make their Escape: I was always indul∣ged in
the Liberty of hearing the Trials, which, as a Court of Judicature was a 
<PB N="229" REF="236"/> Scene I had never before beheld, greatly amused
me.</P>
<P>And, indeed, I quickly perceived Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> was
not mistaken, when he said the first, second, and third Excellence of a
Lawyer was Tautology.</P>
<P>Yet this was but a transitory Relaxation, once in a Week; the
Horror of my Con∣dition returned with double Violence the Moment I heard the
Key turn for my Con∣finement.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> should alledge, that I have been
severe on him in my Writings; let him but consider, the Extremity that he
drove a worthy Gentleman's Daughter to, nurtured in Ease and Plenty: and if
he does not acquit me, I am sure the rest of the World will.</P>
<P>We had a sort of a Chappel belonging to the Jail, where Dr.
<HI>Friend,</HI> a Clergy∣man, Brother to Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> the Physician,
obliged us with Divine Service every <HI>Sun∣day:</HI> This Gentleman was
himself a Pri∣soner in the <HI>King's-Bench,</HI> and, after all the
Grandeur he had once lived in, was now so low reduced, as even to be beholden
<PB N="230" REF="237"/> to such an unfortunate Creature as I for Sixpence;
which, unfortunate as I was, I could not refuse to so fine an Orator, a
G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntleman! and, by all Accounts,
only undone by boundless Generosity and Hos∣pital<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty.</P>
<P>The first Day I heard him preach I was charmed with his
Elocution, but the rest of the Congregation, mad and drunk, bade him hold his
Tongue;—he indeed, like <HI>Orpheus,</HI> played to Wolves and Bears; nor
were they half so obliging to him, as the Storms were to <HI>Arion</HI>;
neither could he, though uttering dulcet and harmonious Sounds, make the rude
Crowd grow civil with his Song.</P>
<P>This fine Gentleman I often invited to my lonely
Mansion—he was not a lit∣tle surprised to hear my mournful
Story;—and indeed it somewhat alleviated my Sorrow to find such a
Companion:—Poor Gentleman! Death has released him; I am sure I
should have done it, had the Almighty given me a Power equal to my
Inclination to serve him.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="238"/>However I may praise God that I was, under
him, the happy Instrument of Good to Numbers of my wretched
Fellow-crea∣tures, since by one pathetic Memorial I wrote for them, the
sorrowful Sighing of the Prisoners reached the Hearts of the Le∣gislative
Powers, and obtained an Act of Grace for them.</P>
<P>But as it was now near <HI>Christmas,</HI> and the Act was not
to take Place till the <HI>June</HI> following, I used my utmost Endeavours
to procure my own Liberty; for, oh! what anxious Moments must have passed
between that dreadful Interval of Time? On a se∣cond Application to Mr.
<HI>Cibber,</HI> he used all his Power with the Great for me, and, as he had
been used to move their Passions, did it effectually on my Behalf,
insomuch than no less than sixteen Dukes contributed a Guinea a-piece
towards my Enlargement.</P>
<P>When I read over these Words, <HI>Discharge from your
Custody the Body of,</HI> &amp;c. as I was by nine Weeks Confinement,
Sickness, and Fasting, rendered quite weak, the joy∣ful Surprise made me
faint away several Times, and indeed, my kind Benefactor 
<PB N="232" REF="239"/> had like to have frustrated his own gene∣rous Design
of preserving me.</P>
<P>However, after all Debts, Extortions, and Dues were paid, I had
just thirteen Shillings left, with which Sum I was once more permitted to
breathe the open Air—and go where I pleased.</P>
<P>As soon as I got as far as <HI>London-Bridge,</HI> I found my
Head turn quite giddy, and my Legs fail me, insomuch that I went into a
Jeweller's Shop, who perceiving my weak Condition, permitted me to sit down
in it; I begged of him to let some of his Servants call a Coach for me, which
he civilly complied with; when I was got into it, I was at a Loss where to
bid the Coachman drive me; till at last recollecting, that all my Writings,
All, the little all! which might make my fu∣ture Fortune, were in the
Possession of Mrs. <HI>Trifoli,</HI> the Woman who had cast me into
Misery unspeakable, which, not to teize my Readers, I have slightly
passed over: for what Entertainment can it possibly give to the
curious, learned, or polite Reader to hear from me what every 
<PB N="233" REF="240"/> Person, who has ever been in a Jail, can relate as
well as I.</P>
<P>Well, I was carried to her House, where, as I told her, I did
not know where to lodge that Night; she kindly accepted of me for a
Bedfellow, but a very bad one I found, for she, as my Spirits were quite
fatigued, no sooner found I was fast asleep, but she picked my
Pocket.</P>
<P>When I awoke in the Morning, she asked me to give her some
Tea, on which taking up my Pocket to give her Money to go for it, I found I had
none; when I complained of this Usage, she told me she was too charitable
to permit me to sleep with her, and now this was her Reward; so she
insisted on my turning out of her Doors, and truly I knew not where to 
<Q> 
<L>—Inform my unacquainted Feet</L> 
<L>Thro' the blind Mazes of a tangled World;</L></Q> So I went
dirty, as I came out of Jail, to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>; for I ought before to
have observed, that this Wretch not only secured my Person, but my
Clothes also, insomuch that I had not a Shift to change me, till, 
<PB N="234" REF="241"/> out of what Charity was sent me, I bought a second
one in the Jail.</P>
<P>However, he received me with as much Regard and Kindness, as
though I had been ever so well drest; but he charged me not to give him
Thanks for any Thing he had done to serve me, but to praise God, who, as he
said, had given me Me∣rit; 
<Q REND="inline">"For, Child, said he, were you stupid,
insensible, or wicked, I should never have had the smallest
Compassion for you."</Q></P>
<P>He asked me what I now intended to do? I assured him I did not
know; for that I neither had a Lodging, nor, what was yet worse, a Shilling
to get one; 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, said he, I have a little Money in Store
for you; I told your melancholy Story to the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> and he
gave me Five Guineas for you; there they are."</Q></P>
<P>This was a Lottery Prize to one in my unhappy Situation; I could
not, though prohibited, forbear the warmest Expres∣sions of Gratitude,
both to his Grace and Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>; to the Duke I wrote a Letter 
<PB N="235" REF="242"/> of Acknowledgment, and provided myself with a Lodging
in <HI>Westminster,</HI> and, as it was on <HI>Christmas</HI> Eve I
obtained my Li∣berty, on <HI>New-Year</HI>'s Day I published in the
<HI>Gazette</HI> the following Lines: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To <HI>COLLEY CIBBER,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LOST in a Prison's joyless Gloom,</L>
<L>Chearless and dreary as the Tomb,</L>
<L>Where on the Bed of Care I lay,</L>
<L>And wept the lonely Hours away:</L>
<L>When ev'ry Hope and Wish was fled,</L>
<L>But to be number'd with the Dead,</L>
<L>You, like a Messenger of Grace,</L>
<L>Spoke my despairing Soul to Peace;</L>
<L>Wip'd off the Tear from Sorrow's Eye,</L>
<L>Bid Bars, and Bolts, strong warded, fly;</L>
<L>Bounty, the Angel-Men revere</L>
<L>Wrought Miracles of Mercy there.</L>
<L>Say, shall those Deeds forgotten die,</L>
<L>Or, lost in cold Oblivion lie?</L>
<L>May Heav'n no longer guard that Breath</L>
<L>You rescu'd from untimely Death,</L>
<L>Than Gratitude attunes my Lays</L>
<L>In sweetest Notes to hymn your Praise;</L>
<L><PB N="236" REF="243"/>Nor can the Song offend the Ear,</L>
<L>Thus offer'd from a Soul sincere.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enlarg'd, once more, with Joy I view</L>
<L>The circling Sun his Course renew.</L>
<L>May He, whose Wisdom guides the Spheres,</L>
<L>Proportion Blessings to thy Years;</L>
<L>To Thee, may rosy-bosom'd Spring,</L>
<L>Pleasure, and Health, and Plenty bring,</L>
<L>Till Time, with gentle Steps, convey</L>
<L>Thy Soul to Realms of endless Day,</L>
<L>Where Cherubims for Thee, with Care,</L>
<L>Unenvy'd deathless Wreaths prepare.</L>
<L>Those modest Virtues You conceal,</L>
<L>Shall Heav'n-born Charity reveal;</L>
<L>And mortal Goodness, to improve,</L>
<L>Unite You can immortal Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh, let your Gaiety excuse,</L>
<L>My serious melancholy Muse!</L>
<L>This World appears a Dream to me,</L>
<L>Afflictions teach Philosophy;</L>
<L>And thus, alone, a Christian Heart,</L>
<L>It's grateful Raptures can impart.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>My dear old Friend was pleased with my Sense of his Goodness
to me; only he told <PB N="237" REF="244"/> me, my Lines were more proper to be
ad∣dressed to an Archbishop than to him, who had nothing to boast of
more than a little common Humanity.</P>
<P>Well, being now free,—and with five Guineas in my Pocket, in
flowing Circum∣stances, I began to consider, in what Man∣ner I should
improve them; so I wrote to his Grace of <HI>M—h,</HI> who, like Lord
<HI>Kingsborough,</HI> knows not how to give one Guinea by way of Relief, he
immediately sent me Ten, sealed up in a very genteel Letter, with his
best Wishes and Compli∣ments to me: who was now so rich as I?</P>
<P>But, as <HI>Shakespear</HI> observes, 
<Q> 
<L>There is a Tide in the Affairs of Men,</L> 
<L>Which taken at the Height, is prospe∣rous;</L> 
<L>But, slighted, the Residue of their Lives</L> 
<L>Is bound in Shallows and in Miscry.</L></Q> So I just then
heard a Clergyman was in <HI>England,</HI> who was a near and intimate Friend
of my Father's; him I addressed, and was ordered to go to Mr.
<HI>Richardson,</HI> <PB N="238" REF="245"/> a Printer, in
<HI>Salisbury-court,</HI> for an An∣swer to my Letter.</P>
<P>As I had never formed any great Idea of a 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mem.</HI> Not our present Set of
Printers, who are many of them Gentlemen, and Persons in good
Cir∣cumstances, prrticularly my own.</NOTE>Printer, by those I had seen
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> I was very negligent of my Dress, any more than making
myself clean; but was extremely surprised, when I was directed to a
House of a very grand outward Ap∣pearance, and had it been a Palace, the
beneficent Master deserved it.</P>
<P>I met a very civil Reception from him; and he not only made me
break∣fast, but also dine with him, and his agree∣able Wife and Children.
After Dinner he called me into his Study, and shewed me an Order he had
received to pay me twelve Guineas, which he immediately took out of his
Escrutore, and put it into my Hand; but when I went to tell them over, I
found I had fourteen, and suppo∣sing the Gentleman had made a Mistake, I
was for returning two of them; but he, <PB N="239" REF="246"/> with a
Sweetness and Modesty almost pe∣culiar to himself, said, he hoped I
would not take it ill, that he had presumed to add a Trifle to the Bounty of
my Friend.</P>
<P>I really was confounded, till, recollecting that I had read
<HI>Pamela,</HI> and been told it was written by one Mr. <HI>Richardson,</HI>
I asked him, whether he was not the Au∣thor of it? He said, he was the
Editor: I told him, my Surprize was now over, as I found he had only given to
the incompa∣rable <HI>Pamela</HI> the Virtues of his own worthy Heart.</P>
<P>When he reads these Lines, as read them I am certain he will,
even for the Writer's sake, let him reflect, that, at least, his Bread was
not scattered on the Water; but that though I have no other Way of shewing
my Gratitude for his boundless and repeated Acts of Humanity to me, and my
Children, but Words, mere Words; yet, if every Word of mine could charm down
Blessings on him, 
<Q> 
<L>Then never shou'd Misfortune cross his Foot;</L> 
<L><PB N="240" REF="247"/>But Peace shou'd be within his Walls
and Plenty,</L> 
<L>Health, and Happiness his constant
At∣tendants.</L></Q></P>
<P>And now, that I might, if possible, avoid the Misery of
extreme Want, I re∣solved to turn my Stock into Trade; and, after long
Consideration, thought nothing would suit my Inclination so well as a
Pamphlet-Shop, nor no Place was so pro∣per for my Purpose as <HI>St.
James</HI>'s-<HI>Street,</HI> where I should be in the Center of my noble
Benefactors; to this end, I walked through it, and finding one to be let, which
answered my Purpose, I directly agreed to give the Landlord twenty-one
Pounds a Year, for a Shop, Parlour, and Kitchen; but the Landlord insisted
upon my paying a Quarter's Rent before-hand, which, though a little hard upon
me, as I not only had the Shop to stock, but Fur∣niture of all Kinds to buy,
I complied with.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="248"/>So, Reader, here was a new Scene, and I, for
the first of my Family, took my Place behind a Counter.</P>
<P>Having met with a very great Bargain of Prints, which were sold
under Distress, and having some Knowledge in that Way, I resolved
also to deal in them; so, having decorated out my Windows with them to the
best Advantage, early on <HI>Monday</HI> Morning I entered on my new
Employ.</P>
<P>The first Person who entered was Lord
<HI>P—st—n,</HI> dress'd <HI>à la mode de Paris,</HI>
with long sloped double Ruffles, such as the La∣dies wear; he took down the
Print of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Monument, and, though it was marked Price
Eighteen-pence, he bade me a Groat for it, which, as it had cost me a
Shilling, I could by no means take; so he went away very much displeased,
and truly, I began to be out of Conceit with my Occupation.</P>
<P>As my dear Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> had made me a present of fifty of
his last Answer to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> I sat down to read it, and found it
so full of Spirit and Humour, that just as it had thrown me into a hearty
Fit of <PB N="242" REF="249"/> Laughter, a Clergyman entered, who asked me,
what I had got new? I told him <HI>my present Situation</HI>: He looked
earnestly on me, and said, he was very sure of that; 
<Q REND="inline">"But, Madam, said he, all are not born to be
happy in this World, however they may merit it, which plainly demon∣strates a
future State, where Rewards and Punishments will be impartially
dis∣tributed; but why should I tell this to Mrs. <HI>Pilkington,</HI> who
may better in∣struct her Teacher?"</Q></P>
<P>I begged of the Gentleman to inform me, where I had had the Honour
of seeing him? He told me, he was Son to Colonel <HI>Stuart,</HI> who lived
next Door to my Father, before I was married, and when he himself was in the
College: I then recollected, that he used every Day to send me some
poetical Praise, and as I never before had an Op∣portunity of thanking him
for his elegant Compliments, I took it now.</P>
<P>As he was desirous of giving me Hansel, as they call it, I
recommended Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Letter to him, as a Cure for the Spleen, a
Distemper most studious and learned Per∣sons <PB N="243" REF="250"/> are
apt to fall into; he took the Ghost's Word for the Excellence of the
Performance, and gave me a Guinea; I was going to give him Change, but he would
not accept of it; so, promising to be a constant Customer for whatever
I sold, and wishing me all Success, he de∣parted. <HI>Mem.</HI> The
Clergyman infinitely more generous than the Peer.</P>
<P>As my Obligations to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> were ever present to my
Mind, I wrote to him the following kind of Paraphrase on an Ode of
<HI>Horace:</HI> 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>CIBBER.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q> 
<L>Donarem pateras.</L><BIBL>Hor.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>DID Fortune wait upon my Hand,</L>
<L>Cou'd I her various Gifts command,</L>
<L>Her noblest Offering wou'd I give</L>
<L>To Him, whose Bounty bade me live,</L>
<L>A golden Goblet, richly chas'd,</L>
<L>Close by a mantling Vine embrac'd,</L>
<L>Whose Fruitage round the Brim should shine,</L>
<L>And seem to yield the sparkling Wine,</L>
<L><PB N="244" REF="251"/>Or radiant Gems, of Value rare,</L>
<L>Shou'd speak my Gratitude sincere,</L>
<L>For thy far nobler Gift to me,</L>
<L>Inestimable LIBERTY!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' Poets boast a fair Estate,</L>
<L>They seldom deal in Gems, or Plate;</L>
<L>For yet in all <HI>Parnassus</HI> Mold,</L>
<L>There ne'er appear'd one Vein of Gold.</L>
<L>We toil, and labour all our Days</L>
<L>For a few Sprigs of barren Bays;</L>
<L>They, Thunder-proof, its Rage defy,</L>
<L>Yet, touch'd by Envy, blasted die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet Verse can consecrate a Name,</L>
<L>And worthy Deeds consign to Fame;</L>
<L>Oh! cou'd I raise a Song sublime,</L>
<L>Triumphant over Fate and Time,</L>
<L>Thy Virtue in the Lays divine</L>
<L>Should with immortal Lustre shine:</L>
<L>Let others place phantastic Joys</L>
<L>In orient Trinkets, splendid Toys!</L>
<L>While your exalted Soul refin'd,</L>
<L>Like Heav'n, accepts the GRATEFUL MIND.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="252"/>I sent these Lines to my dear Gentleman,
who presently came to me, as I was once more in his Neighbourhood,—and
in his chearful way, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Faith, Child, you have praised me so, that, I
think, it is the least I can do to make you eat for a
Fortnight;"</Q>—so he gave me three Guineas.</P>
<P>As my Mind was now a little at Peace, I began to think of my dear
Children, whom nothing but my Incapacity of doing them Service, and a
Supposition that their Father took proper Care of them, could ever divert my
Thoughts from, even a Moment; so strong is maternal Love, at least, if
every Mother loves like me: For, really, and I hope it is a pardonable
Frail∣ty, my very Life is treasured in him, whom I may properly stile my
only Child, and were he to die I should not long sur∣vive him.</P>
<P>I know not of what impenetrable Stuff his Father's Heart was made
of, that could let such a Son, not only want the Advan∣tages of Education,
which had it not been <PB N="246" REF="253"/> in his Power to pay for it, it was
in his own Power to bestow on him, so far as instructing him in the
Knowledge of <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> which <HI>Cato</HI> would not
permit his Son to be indebted to a Slave for;—and yet <HI>Cato</HI> was,
at least, as good, and a much greater Man than the Parson; surely this he
might have done:—No; on the contrary, he chose to expose him, at Nine
Years of Age, to every Calamity in Life; and that he did not turn Thief or
Pickpocket, was due to God's restraining Grace, and providential Care of
him.</P>
<P>And here, I must, in Vindication of my Child, declare, he never
was undutiful or disrespectful to me, as his Father has falsly and
cruelly reported; he is, like all Per∣sons of his Age, so full of Mirth and
over∣flowing Spirits, that, I am certain, the Dulness his Father brings, as
an Excuse for taking him from School, never was his Fault;</P>
<P>For he is— 
<Q><PB N="247" REF="254"/> 
<L>All my Mirth, my Exercise, my Matter,</L> 
<L>He makes my <HI>July</HI>'s Days short as
<HI>De∣cember,</HI></L> 
<L>And, with his varying Playfulness, kills in me</L> 
<L>Thoughts which would thick my Blood.</L></Q> Though, I am
sure, only that he has too much Respect for his Father, to throw any
Reflection on him; yet he might properly say, 
<Q>He let me feed with his Hinds, debar'd me of a Place in his
Love, and, as much as was in him, mined my Gentility by base Education.</Q>
And I may say, with Truth, the Boy is gentle, though 
<Q> 
<L>Never school'd, learn'd; full of noble Device,</L> 
<L>And of all Sorts enchantingly belov'd.</L> 
<BIBL>Shakespear, As you like it.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="255"/>But to return. I wrote to <HI>Ireland</HI>
to my eldest Son, who, either through Fear of his Father's Anger, or an
ill-natur'd Spirit derived from him, did not think me worth an Answer;
however, he shewed the Letter to his Sister, who, in her low Stile, sent
me an affectionate Letter. Before it reached me, I heard Mr.
<HI>Ar—e</HI> was come to <HI>London,</HI> and having been told my Child
was bound Apprentice to him, I did not doubt but I should find him with him,
so I went to wait on him; he received me very politely, and told me, my Son
had left him, and was gone to <HI>Scotland:</HI> When I demanded, how they came
to part? He said, he had pawned some of his Music Books, and that he had
complained to his Father of him, who asked what they might be worth? It is to
be presumed that they were valued to the utmost they cost; upon which Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> ever tender, said he was glad to hear that the Theft, as
he termed it, amounted to Death, intreating Mr. <HI>Ar—e</HI> to
prosecute the Child, for such he then was, and declaring that no∣thing in
the World would give him greater Satis∣faction <PB N="249" REF="256"/> than to
hear that the Dog was hang'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ar—e</HI> said, Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s
In∣humanity quite shocked him,—so he corrected the Boy very
severely, upon which he ran away from him; that he had since received a
Letter from him, which he shewed to me, and from thence I got a Direction
where to write to him. I was, as may be supposed, infinitely disturbed at
this Account of my Son; I wrote to him that very Night, and informed him of
what Mr. <HI>A—e</HI> had said; I begged of him to come to me, and that
as his Master had highly commended his musical Talents, I hoped, by Mr.
<HI>Cibber</HI>'s Interest, to get him engaged at one of the Theatres.</P>
<P>About ten Days after, having just paid my Rent, and bought
some Shop-Goods, on which I had laid out every Penny I was worth;—as I
had stuck up on my Shop Window, <HI>Letters written here on any Subject,
except the Law, Price Twelve-pence; Petitions also drawn at the same
Rate.</HI> Mem. <HI>Ready Money, no Trust.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="257"/>A Man came in, very badly drest, with a
greasy Leather Apron before him; he looked over some Prints, when the
Post∣man brought me a large Pacquet, marked <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; as I had no
Money, I was in terrible Confusion, especially as the Fellow cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Come, Mistress, don't keep me waiting;"</Q> I
said, I must send out for Change: Oh, said he, I never go without it;
where's your Piece? Upon this, the Leather-apron'd Gentleman, for such he
was, drew out a Handful of Gold, and throwing down a Guinea, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"There, take your Money;"</Q> and what was yet
more surprizing, he insisted on my taking the Change, for he determined,
he said, to have me his Debtor.</P>
<P>Upon this I began to have a very different Opinion of my new
Customer than what his first Appearance gave me, and therefore civilly
entreated his Permission to peruse my Letter, to which he agreeing, I had
not read above ten Lines when I burst into Tears, so the Gentleman
insisted on my laying it aside while he stayed, telling me, 
<PB N="251" REF="258"/> I must so far oblige him as to write a Love-Letter
for him.</P>
<P>Upon this I invited him into the Parlour, and told him, he must
make me his Confi∣dant: He said, he had never mentioned Love to the Lady;
that, as to her Person, she was very agreeable, but that her Mind far
surpassed it: So, having my Instruc∣tions, I quickly finished my
Task greatly to his Satisfaction, insomuch that he pro∣tested I must
give him Leave to send for a Flask of <HI>Champaigne</HI> to raise my
Spirits, which, indeed, were greatly oppressed.</P>
<P>By the time he had drank a Glass or two, he began to talk of
<HI>Homer, Horace, Milton,</HI> and all the Poets; sung an <HI>Italian</HI>
Song; and soon convinced me, that Dress was put on merely to disguise a
fine Gen∣tleman, which it was no way in his Power to do; I told him so, and
asked him, why he walked in Masquerade?</P>
<P>He smiled at my Question, but assured me, he was neither
better or worse than a House-Painter, and that his Name was <HI>Tom
Brush.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="259"/>This put me in Mind of an Adventure I once
had in <HI>Ireland,</HI> when one of the finest Gentlemen in it came to
visit me in a Grazier's Coat, and told me his Name was <HI>Tom Long,</HI> the
Carrier, though he hap∣pened to be an <HI>English</HI> Baronet, with a large
Estate, and a great Employment.</P>
<P>But I have been a Lady of Adventure, and almost every Day of my
Life produces some new one: I am sure, I ought to thank my loving Husband
for the Opportunity he has afforded me of seeing the World from the Palace to
the Prison; for had he but permitted me to be what Nature cer∣tainly intended
me for, a harmless hous∣hold Dove, in all human Probability I should have
rested contented with my humble Situation, and, instead of using a Pen,
been employed with a Needle, to work for the little ones we might, by this
time, have had.</P>
<P>Now, after all my strange Vicissitudes of good and evil
Fortune, I sincerely de∣clare, that were I to have my Wish, tho' I should
not now in the Decline of Life be able to struggle through Misfortunes, as in
<PB N="253" REF="260"/> it's first sprightly Career; yet as by the Bounty,
Compassion, and Kindness of all my noble, and honoured Benefactors, I
have the unspeakable Happiness of being set above the low
Distresses of Life. 
<Q> 
<L>Now pleas'd Remembrance builds Delight on Woe.</L> 
<BIBL>Pope's Homer.</BIBL></Q> I think I am glad that there has
been such strong Proof made of my Constancy, without which I had scarce
known how duly to praise that eternal Goodness, who evermore gave me
Strength adequate to the severe Afflictions he was pleased to try me with.
Be then all Praise to him, who 
<Q> 
<L>From seeming Evil, still educes good,</L> 
<L>And better still from thence, and better still</L> 
<L>To infinite Perfection.</L></Q></P>
<P>Well, when Mr. <HI>Brush</HI> departed, I read my dear Child's
Letter, which was as fol∣lows: 
<LETTER>
<PB N="254" REF="261"/>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Edinburgh, 
<DATE>Sept. 16, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>My dear, dear MOTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO Tongue can express the Joy which the Receipt of your kind
Letter in∣spired me with, to find a long lost Trea∣sure! for I was so
positively assured you were dead, that I can hardly believe my Eyes, when
I see your dear and well∣known Hand, and read your beloved Name, which I have
kissed a thousand Times: If it be Delusion, may I never be
undeceived!</P>
<P>You desire me to give you a particular Account of whatever
has befallen me since I had the Misfortune of loosing you, my dearest and
only Friend; for I, with all Duty and Gratitude, remember your fond Affection
to me: It is to you I am indebted that I can either read or write, or know any
part of my Duty either to God or Man; for I do assure you my Father neither
in∣structed me himself, nor (tho' Mr. <HI>Baldrick</HI> whom my Grandfather
put me to School to, when the good old Man was dead, would have taught for me
nothing) would <PB N="255" REF="262"/> he permit me to go School, because one
Day a Boy threw a Stone at me, and I throwing another at him, happened to break
a Pane of Glass in an Alehouse Window, for which the People followed me
home, and made my Father pay a Groat for it.</P>
<P>Upon this I received a most inhuman Correction from him,
which was repeated every Morning and Night for six Days to∣gether; he
stripped off all my Clothes, though in the Depth of Winter, and locked them
up, leaving me without any Covering but my Shirt in the dark Back Kitchen,
which, as you may remember, was in the Winter overflowed with Water, charging
the Servants not to give me a Morsel of Food; and that I am alive is due to
God's Providence, who, I hope, preserved me to be a Comfort to you.</P>
<P>However the Servants, though they had but a Groat a Day
allowed them to live upon, used to give me Share of their Bread and
Butter-Milk, and, when my Father was abroad, would permit me to warm my Body at
the Kitchen Fire; nay, and as my Father said, it was too much Indulgence 
<PB N="256" REF="263"/> for me to sleep with his Footman, the poor Fellow
used to let me lie down in the Day, where I spent most of my Time, and
was neither allowed Pen, Ink, or Book to a∣muse me.</P>
<P>I will in some time give you a full His∣tory; but, at
present, shall confine my∣self to Mr. <HI>A—e</HI>'s Affair. I
lived with him some time before I was bound Ap∣prentice, in which I was
used very well; but as soon as that was done the Scene was changed. Mrs.
<HI>A—e,</HI> who was prodi∣giously fond of Gin, used to take so
much of it, that she seldom knew what she did, and would often persuade
her Husband to believe well or ill of me, just as she was drunk or sober:
It was in one of these Fits she was when <HI>Tommy L—e</HI> landed,
who is really a worthless conceited Fellow; and because he thought I did
not sufficiently admire his fine singing, used, by way of Fun, to set
Mrs. <HI>A—e</HI> on to abuse me and Mr. <HI>A—e,</HI> who is
really a good-natured Man. I was discharged from fetching Half-quarterns to
my Mistress; and there being an old Box in the Garret, in which 
<PB N="257" REF="264"/> Mr. <HI>A—e</HI> kept some Musick-Books, she
went up to examine it, and said there were some of them stole: He, who
did not know what number of Books there was in it, said, there was none gone;
upon which, without the least Ceremony, she struck him in the Face,
swearing by the great God, if he did not correct me, she would do it
herself. I, who was not far off, and heard this Discourse, made the
best of my way out of the House; which Mrs. <HI>A—e</HI> taking as a
Proof of Guilt, and a villai∣nous Maid she had joining with her, she
searched the House, and swore she had lost many things, as Brass
Candlesticks, Bottles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all this poor Mr. <HI>A—e</HI>
was obliged to agree to for Quietness sake. When I had staid a Day away,
I wrote to him, telling him, I was surprized at his Suspi∣cions of me, and
that I was willing to re∣turn: He came directly with the Messen∣ger, and
brought me home. I stayed there till Night, when Mr. <HI>L—e</HI>
com∣ing in, and hearing I was there, called for his Horsewhip, and Mr.
<HI>A—e,</HI> his Wife, and <HI>L—e</HI> were beating me for three 
<PB N="258" REF="265"/> Hours, to make me confess what I had done with the
Books, swearing they would cut me to Death, if I did not own. I was forced
one time to say that I sold them; another, that I gave them away, to get a
little Respite; so, when they had made me confess to what they pleased,
I was put to Bed, and locked in, in order to be sent to <HI>Newgate</HI> next
Day.</P>
<P>I stayed all Night, never slept, and all the next Day did
not eat a Morsel. In the Evening they were rehearsing <HI>Comus,</HI> when
I shot back the Lock of my Prison, and finding the other Door open, I took
off my Shoes, and crept down stairs, got to the Street, and run five Streets
Length in my Stockings: What Advantage the Maid might make of finding the Door
open and me gone I know not, as Mrs. <HI>A—e</HI> said she had lost
some of her Jewels, Things the poor Woman never had in her Life; and so far
I was from a Thought of taking any thing of theirs, that I did not take my Hat,
a Shirt, or any thing else with me. Now all the Reason I can ever devise
for her using me so, was, I believe, <PB N="259" REF="266"/> because I
once saw her and <HI>L—e</HI> toying on the Bed together. So now, my
Dear Mother, as I fear I have taken up too much of your Time already, I shall
conclude, with assuring you</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, With the greatest Tenderness, Respect
and Duty, Your affectionate Son, J. PILKINGTON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This Account of my poor Child's Suf∣ferings threw me into what
they call <HI>An Histerick Cholick,</HI> under which I languished many
Days; but my Hour was not yet come, nor had my Sorrows reached their Summit.
But of that in due place.</P>
<P>But to return to my Seat behind the Counter, where I was tolerably
content with my Situation, except for the Concern I felt for my Children, from
whom I could seldom disengage my Thoughts, although the sad Remembrance
grieves my <PB N="260" REF="267"/> Soul. I must proceed: I went to indulge a
pleasing Fit of Melancholy into <HI>Westmin∣ster-Abbey,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>Where breathing Paint, and speaking Marbles shew</L> 
<L>What Worthies form the hallow'd Mold below.</L></Q> I wandered
through the Cloysters, reading the Inscriptions till it grew duskish. I
hastened to the great Gate, but was infi∣nitely shocked to find I was
locked into the solitary Mansions of the Dead: I called a∣loud to no
purpose, except to fright myself with my own Voice, reverborated through 
<Q> 
<L>Long sounding Isles, and intermingled Graves.</L></Q> 'Tis
scarce in the power of Imagination to paint the Horror which
possessed me, es∣pecially as, by the Glimpses of the Moon, the
Statues, which had before been Subjects of Amusement to me, now looked
dread∣ful, when each Mole-hill Ant swelled to a huge <HI>Olympus</HI>; I knew
not what to do, <PB N="261" REF="268"/> but, if possible, take Sanctuary at
the Altar.</P>
<P>I went up to the Iron Wicket, which opens into that part of the
Abbey where Divine Service is performed, and to my unspeakable Happiness,
pulled it open: I thought to sit down in one of the Pews till Morning, till,
recollecting the Church was full of Rats, my Terrors were again re∣newed, and I
had Inclination to go into the Isles, yet, how strong a Passion is
Fear? the very Look of them terrified me; till, at length gathering Courage,
even from De∣spair, I went to the Communion Table, took off from thence a
Carpet, which co∣vered it, and thinking I could no where be so secure from
those Vermin as in the Pulpit, I, with great Difficulty, dragged it up, where
finding also a Velvet Cushion, I seated myself, and laid the Cushion
un∣der my Head, wrapping even my Face up with the Carpet.</P>
<P>I endeavoured all in my Power, by the Force of Reason and
Religion, to conquer the Terrors which seized me; I reflected that God was
every where, and able to <PB N="262" REF="269"/> defend me; that he was not
slow to hear, nor impotent to save; and also that the Church was
peculiarly under his Care, as consecrated to Acts of Holiness, and both
relying on his Providence, and commit∣ting to his Protection, I found my Mind
as tranquil and composed, as if I had been at home in my Bed, and fell into a
deep Sleep: And here, tho' I may be thought whimsical or superstitious
for it, I cannot avoid relating my Dream, produced, no doubt, by the same Set
of Ideas which had possessed my waking Thoughts, and still held their
place in Sleep.</P>
<P>I imagined myself to be exactly where I was, and that suddenly
the Graves gave up their mighty dead, who walked in mar∣tial Array before me; I
thought, by some secret intuitive Knowledge, I became ac∣quainted not only
with their Names, but also with their Aspects. Many crowned Heads and
sceptered Hands stalked by me in venerable Majesty: <HI>Henry</HI> V.
clad in Armour, drew in a particular manner my Attention, insomuch that I
could not for∣bear blessing him; I thought he smiled, 
<PB N="263" REF="270"/> and, with a placid Air, returned my Salu∣tation, and
said, 
<Q REND="inline">"I should have been Great, if, when I had
conquered <HI>France,</HI> I had not married the perfidious Daugh∣ter of it,
who at the Age of Thirty-four poisoned me. This Crime of hers has been truly
visited on all our unhappy Race, who are now quite extinct."</Q></P>
<P>I said, Thanks, Gracious Monarch. He disappeared, and two
Persons struggling for a Diadem next approached. Death, Desolation, and
Ruin were spread around them, till at length, a surly-looking Fel∣low
destroyed them both, and all their Friends.</P>
<P>I mourned at this sad Scene, when, lo! a Hero appeared, who held
in one Hand red Roses and white, so blended that they looked lovely to the
Eye; he seemed once or twice to smell to them, when instantly the Flowers
faded and died, while in their Place, appeared a large Bag of Money.</P>
<P>Next came a squat, square-faced King, who held in his
right-hand four bloody Heads, one of whom I thought I knew to 
<PB N="264" REF="271"/> be that of <HI>Anna Bullen,</HI> and the other that of
the Marquis of <HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<P>A sweetly blooming Youth, whose Por∣trait was just at my
Back in the Pulpit, ap∣peared and vanished like my Dream, out of which I
startled by the Chimes; finding the Bell tolled Four, and knowing the early
Service did not begin till Six, I once more endeavoured to compose myself
to Rest.</P>
<P>I must reassume my Dream just where it broke off, as it
really occurred to me. A lovely Lady made her Entrance, holding <HI>Plato</HI>
in one Hand, and the Bible in the other; two Men, by Force, put a Crown on her
Head, at which she seemed ter∣rified, when immediately came a Woman with a
Countenance like <HI>Maegara,</HI> attended by a Train of Fellows, with Cords,
Axes, and Hatchets, Wheels, and other Imple∣ments of Death and Torture, waited
on again by Persons, who, by their holy Vestments, I hoped would be, at
least hu∣mane; but alas! instead of comforting the lovely Lady, they forced
the above-said Fury, who seemed for once inclined to pity 
<PB N="265" REF="272"/> her, to permit those savage and inhuman Butchers to
cut off the loveliest, the most learned Head that ever, from the prime
Creation, adorned a Woman.</P>
<P>But to the unspeakable Happiness of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
this detestable Wretch told me, as I thought, that <HI>Philip</HI> of
<HI>Spain</HI> poi∣soned her, in Hopes of marrying her Sister
<HI>Elizabeth,</HI> then a Prisoner in the Tower.</P>
<P>I was tired with these shadowy crowned Heads passing by
me, like those in <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and wished to see the sweetly
inspired, Lau∣rel-wreathed Poets advance; my Wish was immediately
gratified, and a merry old Fellow appeared, who was, as it were in Jest,
lashing a whole Swarm of Friars: 
<Q> 
<L>Piec'd, patch'd, and pye-bal'd, linsey-woolsey
Brothers,</L> 
<L>Bare-headed, sleeveless some, and shirtless
others.</L> 
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></Q> And though the Blows were dealt pretty
smart, they affected to smile at them.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="273"/>Next appeared a Queen, to whom a Gentleman,
with a sweet but melancholy Countenance, humbly presented a Volume of
inimitable Poetry, as he was the Prince of Poets in his Time: His
<HI>Gloriana</HI> re∣ceived it graciously, and putting her Hand in her Pocket
gave him a large Bag; I sup∣posed it had been filled with Gold, but the
Poet opening it, found nothing in it but Grains, su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h as they feed the Hogs with, of which he put a large
Handful into his Mouth, and instantly dropped down.</P>
<P>The Concern I felt for him awaked me; the Bell tolling for Morning
Prayer, and the Sexton missing the Carpet, and suppo∣sing the Church
had been robbed, was al∣most beside himself, till I called to him, and
bade him not be frighted, there was nothing gone; the Man stared at me, I
begged him to come and help me down, for I found myself so weak I could
scarce move.</P>
<P>I then told him by what odd Accident I came there: He seemed
amazed that I out∣lived it, and swore heartily he would not have been in my
Place for all the World. <PB N="297" REF="274"/> I begged of him to get
somebody to call me a Chair; he went himself for one, and with great
Good-nature, brought from his own House a small Phial, with some
Cherry-brandy in it, and a Tea-cup in his Pocket; I am sure I wanted a
Cordial, and there∣fore took a little of it, though not with∣out obliging him
to accept of Payment for it.</P>
<P>When I returned Home, my Servant, who had sat up for me all
Night, was amazed to see me so pale and dirty, for the old Carpet had
sufficiently soiled my Apparel; but, lest she should conceive a bad
Opinion of me, I told her where I had been, and went to Bed; I slept for two
Hours, and awoke extremely ill, notwith∣standing which I cleaned myself,
and went into my Shop.</P>
<P>A young Gentleman, but very gravely drest, was my first
Customer; he asked me the Price of an old Print in the Window, and seemed
surprized at my asking Half a Crown for it, assuring me it was not
worth a Groat; I said, I was sure he was too good a Judge not to know the
Value of <PB N="268" REF="275"/> any Print taken out of <HI>Montfaucon</HI>'s
An∣tiquities: He said, he wondered why, since I knew the Value of the
Author, I should be so tasteless as to cut one of them out of the Work,
which in many Places served to illustrate it, particularly in the Medals: I
assured him I had not done it, but had bought them amongst a Number of
others. The Gentleman perceiving I spoke very faintly, said, he believed I
was not well; I assured him I was so ill, it was with in∣finite
Difficulty I spoke at all; he demanded of me, who was my Physician? I
said, I had none since my dear Father died, who was one of the Faculty:
Then, Madam, said he, allow me to have that Honour; so feeling my Pulse,
he ordered me to be bled, which greatly relieved my poor Head, which, with the
Agitation of Spirit I had suffered over Night, aked ready to split. As this
Gentleman gave me his Attendance as long as I had the least Complaint, I
should, I think, be highly ungrateful not to acknowledge my Obligation to Dr.
<HI>Lawson.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="276"/>And indeed, I must here say, I never met
with more learned, more generous, or more humane Gentlemen than Physicians;
yet as no general Rule is without an Excep∣tion, Dr.
<HI>W—lk—r</HI> refused me a Sub∣scription, altho' every other
Physician had, on my dear Father's Account, relieved his unhappy Family; but
he alledged it would disoblige Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>; I know not but it
might; yet how he came to fear him more than the rest of the World did, that
I know not, but any Excuse will serve a Man to save five Shillings;
perhaps he could not spare them, as it is more than probable, were he see'd
according to his Skill, he might not be worth a single <HI>Marvedi</HI>; and
for many Reasons, he ought not to be severe on any Woman's Cha∣racter, let
him amend the Females of his own Family first, a Task, I fear he will never
be able to perform.</P>
<P>I might also give the same Advice to Dr. <HI>O—ns,</HI>
whose two Sisters took a solitary Walk over <HI>Essex-Bridge</HI>
every Evening, perhaps to say their Prayers.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="277"/>But to return to <HI>Albion.</HI> I had one
Even∣ing been invited abroad, and at my Return, my Servant told me there had
been two very fine Gentlemen to visit me, who would not leave their Names,
but said they would come the next Morning. Accord∣ingly they did; one of whom
I knew to be Lieutenant <HI>Southwel,</HI> since dead, and the other the
L—d V—t <HI>D—le</HI>; Mr. <HI>Southwel,</HI> who had been
many Years acquainted with me, seemed rejoiced to see me, but my Lord
looked on me with the utmost Contempt, nay, with such an Air, as I had
never before met with from any Gentleman, and cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Prithee, come away, I thought you were to take me
to a Girl of Sixteen;"</Q> though, <HI>mem.</HI> he was at that time married to
his present Lady, who is, by all Accounts, a very great Beauty: I assured
his Lordship I had been once Sixteen, but as it happened six∣teen Years had
rolled over since that bloom∣ing Season, and that, to my great
Morti∣fication, I could not arrest old Father <HI>Time:</HI> Mr.
<HI>Southwel</HI> very politely said, I should be always young; but my Lord
<PB N="271" REF="278"/> urging his Departure, he whispered me, that he would
come and pass the Evening with me.</P>
<P>He kept his Word, and gave me a long Detail of the Calamities he
had suffered on Board a Man-of-War, where, because some saucy Fellow
called him a <HI>Bastard,</HI> and he in Return, broke his Head, the Captain
confined him sixteen Weeks to his Cabin; but learning that he was very ill,
he per∣mitted him to come upon Deck; he was supported by two Men, weak, cold,
and trembling, as he assured me, and ready to faint, so that he was
obliged to sit down; upon which the Captain demanded how he dare to sit
down in his Presence, or to wear his Hat? so he first knocked it off, and
then threw it into the Sea.</P>
<P>These Indignities, said he, so highly provoked me, that I
retired to my Cabin, resolved, if ever I set my foot on Shore, to call the
Captain to an Account for them. Accordingly, as soon as we were on
<HI>English</HI> Ground, I challenged him, for which Of∣fence I was mulcted
eighteen Months pay; so here is the History of poor <HI>Dick</HI> for
you.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="279"/>I was sensibly touched with his
Narra∣tion, and could not help reflecting how ter∣ribly it must be to
Gentlemen of Family and Education, to bear with Insults from Wretches so
far beneath them, as those Marine Commanders frequently are, who are perhaps
advanced for being abject, and no sooner are they advanced, but they be∣come
insolent Tyrants.</P>
<P>And indeed, I believe this is eternally the Case; for it is a
constant Remark, that the worst Masters and Mistresses, are those
who have been Servants themselves; they know what Frauds they have committed
when in the like Situation, and conse∣quently pry into such low Affairs, as
Per∣sons of genteel Birth, and generous Educa∣tion could never think of, and
even if they were informed of them, would chuse to overlook.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Southwel</HI> then told me, Lord <HI>D—le</HI> had
abused me all Day, tho' for what Cause I know not; but, with blunt
<HI>Ben,</HI> in <HI>Love for Love,</HI> I merrily told my Sea Officer, that as
for my Lord's Love or Liking, I valued it not of a Rope's <PB N="273" REF="280"/> End, and that, mayhap, I liked him as little as he did me.</P>
<P>I almost forced him to drink a Pint of Wine with me, and would
have also forced Half a Guinea on him, but his Spirit would not admit of
that.</P>
<P>I was so highly provoked at Lord <HI>D—le</HI>'s
Insolence and Pride, so lit∣tle becoming the Character of a Nobleman, that
I could not forbear writing some Lines on so proper a Subject for Satire,
which Mr. <HI>Southwel</HI> had snatched from me, and directly carried to his
Lordship.</P>
<P>I went next Morning to wait on Ad∣miral <HI>Anson,</HI> with a
Petition from the Sister of his Valet de Chambre, who hap∣pened to be the
first Man shot in his first Sea Engagement, to whom, beside a Part of
the Prize then taken, there was seven Years Wages due. I was shewn into the
Back Parlour of a small House in <HI>Hanover-Square.</HI> It was well
adorned with Books in Glass Cases, even from the Ceiling to the Floor; and
on this Occasion, as I had a thousand Pounds worth of Jewels left with me
by Mr. <HI>Fisher,</HI> whose Father kept a <PB N="274" REF="281"/> Shop in
<HI>Castle-street, Dublin,</HI> to dispose off for him, knowing how
much Dress com∣mands Respect, I put a pair of Diamond Ear-rings into my
Ears, tied on a Diamond Solitaire, and as for Lace, and every other
Appurtenance to suit those Ornaments, I had them of my own.</P>
<P>My glittering Appearance, and being in a Chair, soon b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought the Admiral down in a rich
Undress, as he supposed, by the Account delivered of me, I must be a
Wo∣man of Quality; my Eyes were fast en∣gaged to the Books when he entered;
he begged my Pardon for his <HI>Dishabille:</HI> I turned, and said, I was
glad for once to see Learning and Valour so happily united.</P>
<P>But no sooner did he find that I had only a Petition to deliver,
but his Coun∣tenance changed to the severe, and he told me, he believed
People thought he had brought Home the Wealth of the <HI>Indies,</HI> whereas
he had not a single Shilling to com∣mand, no more than the meanest Sailor
aboard, the Money being all, as he said, paid into the Treasury, from
whence no <PB N="275" REF="282"/> Man, without the utmost Difficulty, could
extract one single Farthing of it; and hav∣ing the Word of so great a Man,
I really believed it: A sad Discouragement to all Sailors to venture their
Lives, when even their very Admirals are not rewarded!</P>
<P>However, as I told the Admiral the Woman was actually starving,
he gave me a Guinea for her.</P>
<P>When I returned Home, I found in my Shop Lord <HI>D—le,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Skeffington,</HI> since dead, and another Gentleman waiting for me;
Lord <HI>D—le</HI> asked what he had done, to provoke me to write with
so much Bitterness against him? Nay, my Lord, what had I done to
disoblige you, or occasion your bestowing on me such gross Abuse,
as Mr. <HI>Southwel</HI> assured me you did? My Lord said, upon his
Honour it was false, and taking me by the Hand, assured me he would be a
Friend to me, provided I gave him no more of my Pen; but as from that Hour to
this, he never did me any kind of Service, I think the Obligation void on my
Side, and there∣fore <PB N="276" REF="283"/> present my Readers with the
follow∣ing Sketch of his inimitable Character. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To the Right Honourable the L—d V—t
<HI>D—LE.</HI></HEAD>
<L>SATYRIC Muse! let me prevail</L>
<L>On thee to picture <HI>D—le:</HI></L>
<L>Fierce, as the surly northern Gale,</L>
<L>Is proud, contemptuous <HI>D—le</HI>;</L>
<L>What makes the Artist rot in Jail?</L>
<L>Trusting the base-born <HI>D—le</HI>;</L>
<L>The Rose-cheek'd Nymph turns wan, and pale,</L>
<L>Touch'd by infectious <HI>D—le</HI>;</L>
<L>Light Gossamer would turn the Scale,</L>
<L>Weigh'd 'gainst the Wit of <HI>D—le</HI>;</L>
<L>Nay, were thy Virtues put to Sale,</L>
<L>A Mite o'er-rates them, <HI>D—le:</HI></L>
<L>Honour and Equity shall fail,</L>
<L>E'er practis'd once by <HI>D—le</HI>;</L>
<L>For Hell may <HI>Charon</HI> hoist his Sail</L>
<L>O'er <HI>Styx,</HI> to waft curst <HI>D—le:</HI></L>
<L>In short, my Subject now grows stale,</L>
<L>I'm tir'd with Rhymes to <HI>D—le</HI>;</L>
<L><PB N="277" REF="284"/>So were each Fault and Vice
combin'd,</L>
<L>That e'er debas'd the human Mind;</L>
<L>To sum up all the black Detail,</L>
<L>I'd name the Scoundrel <HI>D—le.</HI></L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>And now, my L—d, as I believe I am the first Poet who ever
celebrated the illustrious Name of <HI>St. L—dg—r,</HI> which
Name, by your supposed noble, and right-well remembered Father's Account,
you are as much intitled to, as I am to that of <HI>Plantagenet,</HI> I hope
you will, according to your true Nobility, give me a hand∣some Reward for
this extraordinary Pane∣gyric!</P>
<P>And here I cannot avoid relating, that I believe, the true Cause
of his L—d—p's Aversion to me, was this: A little Time after I
was separated from my Hus∣band, as it was quite the Mode to attack me, he
employed one of his infernal Agents to inform me, he should be glad to drink
a Dish of Tea with me; I told the Wretch I did not know his
L—d—p, and there∣fore hoped he would excuse me.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="285"/>But the <HI>Harridan,</HI> being resolved
not to lose her Reward, told my L—d I would meet him somewhere,
indeed I do not know the Place, and introduced to him a great, lusty,
masculine Woman, dressed in a Calimanco Cap and Cloak, or long
Riding-hood. I believe his L—d—p wondered that such a Creature
had made any Noise in the World; so telling her, he was sorry he had
given her the Trouble of coming there, he gave her a Guinea, and hastly
departed.</P>
<P>A few Nights after this, <HI>W—rsd—le</HI> had
<HI>The Cure for a Scold,</HI> altered from <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>Taming
of a Shrew,</HI> into a Ballad Opera, by Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> played for his
own Benefit; I wrote a flaming Pro∣logue to it, in Honour of my fair
Coun∣trywomen, and <HI>W—rsd—le</HI> insisted on my going to
see it, assuring me, he would have a Lettice secured entirely for me,
or any Friends I should please to bring, and would himself take care of
placing me, and also guarding me safe out, for really I was very much
afraid of receiving some Insult.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="286"/>On these Promises I ventured to go; when
behold! the Lettice was full; but that was no Matter, the Ladies, though my
in∣timate Friends, quickly decamped, and Mrs. <HI>Dub—g,</HI> the
Fidler's Wife, de∣clared she had like to faint at the Sight of the <HI>odious
Creature!</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Gr—n</HI> also took to his Heels, so
I had indeed the whole Lettice for me and my Company, which were two young
Misses, Daughters to my Landlady.</P>
<P>My <HI>Gorgon</HI> Face, instead of turning my Enemies into
Stone, clapped Wings to their Feet, and made them fly down Stairs, like so
many feathered <HI>Mercuries,</HI> Parson and all, tho' he was bulky, and
tipsy, and dull, and so forth; tho' indeed, those Qualities might make
him descend with the greater Velocity, and give him a natural Alacrity in
sinking.</P>
<P>However, by their precipitant Flight, I got the front Row.</P>
<P>When the Play began, I forgot to keep up my Fan, and two Gentlemen
of Dis∣tinction in the Pit bowed to me; pre∣sently after the Orange Girl
came up, and <PB N="280" REF="287"/> said a Gentleman desired I would accept
of half a Dozen Oranges; I asked who it was? and she shewed me a Person
dressed in Scarlet, trimmed with Black; as I did not know him, I told her
it was a Mistake, and a young Girl, who followed her in, said, that was
L—d <HI>D—le,</HI> and that the Compliment was intended for her;
but the Orange Girl, calling her very fami∣liarly by her Name, which was
<HI>Nancy Raymond,</HI> swore to the contrary; for, said she, you know
how you used my L—d. They talked to one another in the vulgar Tongue,
being exceedingly well known to each other, having both followed the same
Occupation of Orange and Oyster Selling, and both came up Stairs into the
World.</P>
<P>To compose the Animosity, I bought some Fruit, and though I
really paid for it, I doubt not but his L—d—p did also.</P>
<P>When the Play was over, to which I most heartily repented that I
went, <HI>W—rs∣d—le</HI> came to put me into a Chair, said he
would sup with me, and kept his Word.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="288"/>I related to him the Play-House
Adven∣ture, and asked him what kind of a Man L—d <HI>D—le</HI> was?
He told me, he was both a very loose, and a very unge∣nerous Man, Qualities
which no way re∣commended him to me; so being honoured with a second
Message from him, I, with an absolute, <HI>Sir, not I,</HI>
dismissed me back the cloudy Messenger.</P>
<P>But to return:</P>
<P>The next Day a most ugly, squinting, mean looking Fellow,
whose good Clothes made his Awkwardness but the more con∣spicuous, came
in to buy some Prints; his Mind was portrayed in his Countenance, where
Impudence and Ignorance seemed to vie for Pre-eminence; however, he spoke
to me with great Civility, and perceiving, by his Accent, that he was an
<HI>Hibernian,</HI> I asked him, how long he had been in <HI>London?</HI>
Curiosity lead me into a great deal of Chat with him, and as he knew every
great Family in <HI>Ireland,</HI> their Ser∣vants at least, he was able to
give me a good deal of Intelligence: I then enquired, whether Business or
Pleasure had brought <PB N="282" REF="289"/> him to <HI>London?</HI> He
said, both; and pull∣ing out his Pocket-Book, told me, he would surprize
me; I cannot say indeed but he did; for he shewed me Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s
Head, engraven in Vellum, not in size much larger than a small Locket,
such as they wear in Rings, yet so extremely like the Original, that there
was no Occasion to write the Name under it: Several more Pieces of the same
curious Work he shewed to me, and said, he hoped to make his Fortune by
them in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, I was afraid he would be disappointed, as Painting
and Statuary were the Taste of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility; beside,
this is Work more suited to a Wo∣man than a Man; if I could do it, it might
turn to Account to me. Upon which, of his own Accord, he begged I would pass
his Works for mine, and that he would give me a third part of the Profit
arising from the Sale of them: he gave me to un∣derstand he very well knew
who I was, and that our united Interest might be ser∣viceable to each
other, an Offer I did not reject.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="290"/>As he had many fine Mantlings cut, he could
very quickly insert the Arms, so I desired he would finish one for
General <HI>Ch—h—l</HI>; he obeyed me, and I wait∣ed on the old
Gentleman with it, and a few complimentary Lines, which I have now forgot. I
sent in my Presents, and the General desired I might be shewn in: He
was in a very magnificent Drawing∣room, adorned with Stucco Work, the
op∣posite Door opened into a Garden, full blown;—the General was
seated on a rich Sopha, at a Table adorned with Dres∣sing-plate. He
desired I might sit down on a Sopha, opposite to him, and ordered his
Servant to remove the Table; there were several Vases filled with Flowers,
sweetly smelling round the Chamber; and, for my part, I rather imagined I
was in some <HI>Asian</HI> Palace, than a House in
<HI>Gros∣venor-street.</HI></P>
<P>He thanked me for my Present, 
<Q REND="inline">"But, Madam, said he, it is to me quite
use∣less, as all my House is Stucco Work; however, if you'll be so kind
as to come up stairs with me, we may perhaps find <PB N="284" REF="291"/>
some Place, where a Nail may be driven without Injury."</Q></P>
<P>As the old Gentleman doubted I might possibly mistake his
Meaning, he was go∣ing to explain himself; upon which I took up the Picture,
and in very great Confusion made the best Speed out of his House.</P>
<P>I had not walked above twenty Yards, when one of the General's
Footmen over∣took me, who told me, his Master was afraid I might fall in a
Fever, if I walked in the Heat of so warm a Day, and there∣fore desired I
would accept of a Guinea to pay my Chair; I took it, and returned my
Compliments.</P>
<P>As there was something humorous in the General's Behaviour, I
addressed him the next Day in the following Lines: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To the Hon. Gen. <HI>CH—H—L.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FIVE Weeks, Great <HI>Ch—ll,</HI> to my Cost,</L>
<L>Cutting your Coat of my Arms I lost;</L>
<L>I por'd my Eyes, I soil'd my Rayment,</L>
<L>Not doubting of a gen'rous Payment:</L>
<L><PB N="285" REF="292"/>When, well I wot, your whole
Design</L>
<L>Was bent to quarter your's with mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Curse on your plaguy Stucco Work;</L>
<L>Sure 'twas invented hy some <HI>Turk,</HI></L>
<L>To bid to Christian Art Defiance,</L>
<L>And overturn each beaut'ous Science;</L>
<L>No Nail, forsooth, their <HI>Paste</HI> must
enter,</L>
<L>Would one were stuck in the Inventor!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But will a Chief of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Strain,</L>
<L>The Off'ring of the Muse disdain,</L>
<L>Or give her Reason to complain?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should I be seiz'd by Bailiff's Setter,</L>
<L>What must I say? that you're my Debtor;</L>
<L>Why, if they threat me with a Jail,</L>
<L>I'll surely send to you for Bail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Muse and Hero ne'er should quar∣rel,</L>
<L>Our Bays thrives best beneath your Laurel:</L>
<L>Your Province is to shine in Fight,</L>
<L>But our's your noble Acts to write.</L>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI>' Deeds had lost their Glory,</L>
<L>'Till famous made by <HI>Homer</HI>'s Story:</L>
<L><PB N="286" REF="293"/>Nor can You eternize your Name,</L>
<L>'Till we consign your Praise to Fame.</L>
<L>Want damps the Poets genial Fire,</L>
<L>Bounty can Thoughts sublime inspire;</L>
<L>So, crusted o'er with Flint and Clay,</L>
<L>The Di'mond scarce emits a Ray,</L>
<L>'Till disencumber'd of the Mold,</L>
<L>Polish'd with Art, and set in Gold,</L>
<L>Resplendent Glory it displays,</L>
<L>And rivals <HI>Phoebus</HI>' Noontide Blaze.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>I never received any Answer to these Lines, but in a very
short time after I heard the General was Dead.</P>
<P>I gave the young Man both his Coat of Arms and the Guinea; so we
resolved next to address the Earl of <HI>Stair,</HI> then Veldt
Marshal.</P>
<P>It is a very great Loss to me, that by the Ignorance of my
Daughter half of my Writings were burned, for she never scru∣pled, if even
the Fire was bad, to take a whole Bundle of them to enliven it; but whether
this may be any Loss to the World I must leave to their Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="294"/>I can recollect but very few Lines of the
Poem to his Excellency, which were as follows: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To his Excellency the Earl of <HI>STAIR.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q> 
<L>Arma Virumque cano.</L><BIBL>Virg. Aen.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<L>IN <HI>Rome,</HI> when all was Happiness and Ease,</L>
<L>In the full Splendor of voluptuous Days,</L>
<L>Their Chiefs neglected sought the silent Shade,</L>
<L>'Till loudly summon'd to their Country's Aid.</L>
<L>For when tempestuous Ills assault a Realm,</L>
<L>They call their ablest Pilot to the Helm;</L>
<L>To guard their Freedom, to preserve their Fame;</L>
<L>So God-like <HI>Stair,</HI> so <HI>Cincinnatus</HI>
came!</L>
<L>Alike illustrious in their Country's Cause,</L>
<L>Guardians of dying Liberty and Laws.</L>
<L>Accept, my Lord, this Off'ring, nor re∣fuse</L>
<L>The varied Labours of an artless Muse:</L>
<L>No H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rald can add
Lustre to thy Birth,</L>
<L>No Poet justly praise thy noble Worth;</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="295"/>Yet let the fair Attempt Acceptance
find,</L>
<L>And my weak Sex plead to thy gen'rous Mind;</L>
<L>What Wonders then may I hereafter do?</L>
<L>At once protected, and inspir'd by You!</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>A very fine young Gentleman undertook to deliver my Present to
the Earl, and a Servant shewed me into a Parlour. In a few Minutes the
Gentleman returned, and said my Lord desired to see me; so he handed me
up into a full Levee of Stars, and different coloured Ribbons. As I had never
before been in so august an Assembly, I was ready to die with Shame,
especially as there was not one of my own Sex to keep me in Countenance. My
Lord in a most polite manner thanked me for the Honour, as he termed it, I
had done him; and the Noblemen, after his Example, seemed to contend who
should praise me most; to which I could make no other Re∣turn than
Courtesies and Blushes.</P>
<P>At length, the Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> said there was a Defect in
the placing the Swords, which go through the Veldt Marshal's Arms, 
<PB N="289" REF="296"/> which he would willingly have altered; and brought me
out a Print of the Noblemen's Arms, who held the same Dignity in
<HI>France,</HI> as a Pattern; I told his Lordship I could easily alter it:

<Q REND="inline">"Pray then do, Madam, returned he, for I admire
your Work so much, that I would willingly have it quite compleat."</Q>
Accordingly, it was finished, and the next Morning I waited on his Excellency
with it, when, to my great Surprize, I had no Admission to him, but a
Footman brought down five Guineas to me.</P>
<P>I was not a little surprized at this sudden Alteration in his
Lordship's Mind. But what had the Fool, who did the Work, done? truly told
Major <HI>Elliotson,</HI> that I made a Hand of his Performances; he told my
Lord,—who vexed at being im∣posed upon, sent me the Trifle
above∣mentioned, which was not, by any means, a Payment for the Labour and
Curiosity of the Work, and what, from a Person of his Station, I should
not have thought an extraordinary Reward even for the Lines.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="297"/>So, finding the Folly of the Man, I would
not undertake to dispose of any more cut Vellum, but left him to make his
most of it.</P>
<P>I should never have thought this Fellow worth speaking of,
only that my Husband has said he was my G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llant, not that I owe any Reverence or Honour to him, or re∣gard
what he can say, any more than the idle Wind, but that I would not have
such an Imputation laid on my Understanding, to say I made Choice of a
low-born, ugly, illiterate Scoundrel. No, no; Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> may rest
assured, that if I would have done him the Honour to exalt his Horn like
that of an Unicorn, it should, at least, have been to me a
<HI>Cornu-Copia.</HI></P>
<P>But, alas! poor I, have been for many Years a <HI>Noun
Substantive,</HI> obliged to stand alone, which, praise to the eternal
Goodness! I have done, notwithstanding the various Efforts of my Enemies to
destroy me, many of whom I have lived to triumph over, though they
encompassed me on every Side, like so many Bulls of <HI>Basan:</HI> and
though they should now kick up their <PB N="291" REF="298"/> Heels, like so
many wild Asses in the Valley of <HI>Geohron</HI>; though the Dunces
should make Songs of me, and though 
<Q> 
<L>Envy shou'd my fairest Deeds belie,</L></Q> I think it
would not afflict me, but that I should be able to convince them I had, at
least, Patience, Hope, and Charity, suffi∣cient to make them ashamed of
the Injuries they have been weak and wicked enough to offer.</P>
<P>Because I would now fairly challenge my most malicious Foes to
answer from the Tribunal of their own Conscience, what Provocation I ever
gave them to use me ill?</P>
<P>Whom have I defrauded or belyed? Nay, indeed, of whom have I
spoke half the Evil which it was in my Power to do? There are few Characters
immaculate, and had I an Inclination to retaliate Injuries, I am, I believe,
able enough to do it.</P>
<P>And sometimes one has so strong an In∣clination to it, that
it is hard to resist, es∣pecially when a Lady of Quality, (that is 
<PB N="292" REF="299"/> by Marriage, for her Grandfather was a Smith at
<HI>G—n,</HI> and kept the Sign of the Horseshoe there, as I have
frequently heard the late Lord <HI>Montgarret</HI> relate) could, because I
presumed to beg she would do me the Honour of being a Sub∣scriber to me,
a Privilege I thought a long Acquaintance might have entitled me to take, order
my Maid to be kicked; and as I am really ashamed to use her Lady∣ship's
Words on the Occasion, being much too indecent for a Repetition, methinks
she might have spared them, especially to one who knew her too! 
<Q> 
<L>When she was a Maid, if she e'er was a Maid;</L> 
<L>When afraid of a Man, if she e'er was afraid.</L></Q></P>
<P>Heaven knows poor ******* had but the Leavings of half the Town;
but he botched up a broken Reputation with Matrimony, an admirable Salve!</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="300"/>As she was pleased to say, my Life
could be nothing but a continued Series of —, I am ashamed to speak
the Word;—I dare say had it been so, she would have purchased my
Book sooner than the Bible, to indulge her private Meditations, especially
if I had the wicked Art of paint∣ing up Vice in attractive Colours, as too many
of our Female Writers have done, to the Destruction of Thousands, amongst
whom Mrs. <HI>Manly</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Haywood</HI> de∣serve the foremost
Rank.</P>
<P>But what extraordinary Passions these Ladies may have
experienced, I know not; far be such Knowledge from a modest Woman: Indeed
Mrs. <HI>Haywood</HI> seems to have dropped her former luscious Stile, and,
for Variety, presents us with the in∣sipid: Her <HI>Female Spectators</HI>
are a Col∣lection of trite Stories, delivered to us in stale and worn-out
Phrases: bless'd Re∣volution! 
<Q> 
<L>Yet, of the two, less dang'rous is th' Offence,</L> 
<L>To tire the Patience, than mislead the Sense.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="301"/>And here give me Leave to observe, that
amongst the Ladies who have taken up the Pen, I never met with but two who
de∣served the Name of a <HI>Writer</HI>; the first is Madam
<HI>Dacier,</HI> whose Learning Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> while he is indebted to
her for all the Notes on <HI>Homer,</HI> endeavours to depreciate; the second
is Mrs. <HI>Catherine Philips,</HI> the matchless <HI>Orinda,</HI> celebrated
by Mr. <HI>Cowly,</HI> Lord <HI>Orrery,</HI> and all the Men of Genius who
lived in her Time.</P>
<P>I think this incomparable Lady was one of the first Refiners of
the <HI>English</HI> Numbers; Mr. <HI>Cowly</HI>'s, though full of Wit, have
somewhat harsh and uncouth in them, while her Sentiments are great and
virtuous; her Diction natural, easy, flow∣ing, and harmonious.</P>
<P>Love she wrote upon with Warmth, but then it was such as
Angels might share in without injuring their original Purity. Her Elegy on
her Husband's Daughter, is a Proof of the Excellency and Tenderness of her
own Heart, rarely met with in a Step-mother; nor could I ever read it without
Tears, a Proof it was wrote from her Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="302"/>And dear <HI>Orinda!</HI> gentle Shade!
sweet Poet! Honour of thy Sex! Oh, if thou hast Power to do it, inspire
me! for sure Thou art in the happy Bowers of Bliss, praising that eternal
Goodness, who, to the Loss of this World, took Thee early away to adorn the
Holiest of Holies, where in Songs of Love, not ill-essay'd below, great
Saint Thou continuest to celebrate thy Maker. 
<Q> 
<L>Oh pour thy Spirit o'er my Lays,</L> 
<L>Coelestial Melody inspire!</L> 
<L>Sweet as the Royal Psalmist's Lyre,</L> 
<L>That I with Thee may hymn his Praise.</L></Q></P>
<P>I cannot, except my own Country-woman, Mrs. <HI>Grierson,</HI>
find out another female Writer, whose Works are worth reading; she indeed
had a happy and well-improved Genius. I remember she wrote a very fine Poem
on Bishop <HI>Berkley's Ber∣mudian</HI> Scheme; the Plan of it was this: She
supposes that the Night before St. <HI>Paul</HI> suffered, an Angel
appeared to comfort him with the future Prospect of the Church, 
<PB N="296" REF="303"/> and the Growth of Christianity; the Angel informs him
that in such a Year there shall be born in the Western Island a great
Apostle, who shall be known by this Token: 
<Q> 
<L>'Tis he from Words first rids Philosophy,</L> 
<L>And lays the dull material System by,</L> 
<L>Affrights the daring Libertine to find</L> 
<L>Naught round him, but the pure, all-holy Mind;</L> 
<L>The blushing Sinner from his Covert draws</L> 
<L>Of Matters various Forms, and Motions Laws,</L> 
<L>His only Fortress from the Atheist takes,</L> 
<L>And his atomic World at once unmakes.</L></Q> I am sorry
that I cannot recollect any more of this Poem, or that the Prophecy con∣tained
in it of the Bishop's converting the <HI>Indians</HI> was, by the Avarice of
some in Power, frustrated; for surely he was well fitted for that holy
Mission, having Learn∣ing and Innocence in Perfection. Nor do I at all
doubt that had this true Embassador <PB N="297" REF="304"/> of
<HI>Christ</HI> been enabled to pursue the sacred Purpose of his Soul,
but the Power of working Miracles would have been added to his other heavenly
Gifts.</P>
<P>I have been accused of writing bitterly against the Clergy; I
never did, but when they forgot their own High Calling; one B— in
particular, says, 
<Q REND="inline">"that I <HI>Alexander</HI> the Copper-smith have
done him much Wrong, in talking about Pence, and Farthings, and such small
Coin, whereas he has within these two and twenty Years, given me the Sum
total of sixteen Pounds <HI>Irish,</HI> in hard Gold, out of which, had I
been indus∣trious, I might have made a comfortable Livelihood:"</Q> But I am
afraid, had he been in my Case, he would have starved. Happy for him his
Father was born be∣fore him, and <HI>Happy is the Son whose Fa∣ther is gone
to the Devil,</HI> is an old Pro∣verb. But indeed, now my L—, I take it a
little unkindly, that you should declare in public, that you had me, as well
as my Maid, <HI>sur la Tapis</HI>; methinks, tho' you are a Conjurer, you
need not be a <PB N="298" REF="305"/> Blab: Oh, fy! is it thus you return my
generous Passion? for, by your own Ac∣count, you did not pay me well; why
<HI>Juggy Mackshane,</HI> the Chairman's Wife, had a better Price from you,
and you made her Son a Parson, while you quarrelled with mine for having his
Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton holes worked in the best
Taste, and told him, he must be very wicked to be guilty of such
Extravagance: Were not you a little censorious, think you? Why you, tho' in
the Vauward of your Youth, have yet a strong Dash of the Cox—b, and
might excuse it in a Boy. Well, but as these said sixteen Pounds are
so insisted on, I acknow∣ledge to have received them, and should have
thanked you, but that you sent me Word, in <HI>London,</HI> you did not know
who I was, and that it was very impudent in me to apply to you for Charity; but
lest you should again forget me, I am willing to be your sweet
Remembrancer: And, oh! by our chaste Love, I conjure you to make my Husband
a Dean; sure this you ought to do, when you say you made him a Cuckhold;
besides, you know it was in <PB N="299" REF="306"/> that sweet Hope I
yielded up my Heart; then be a gentle Mediator between us, plead for me as you
did for the fair 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>Pilkington.</HI></NOTE>Quaker;
tho' Historians relate, that your Lady would have been as well pleased, had
you been less assiduous in that Affair.</P>
<P>And now, I confess, I am a little spite∣ful, but it is only
Jealousy; send me an hundred Pounds to cure the Anguish your Infidelity
has given me, and I will try to conquer my hopeless ill-star'd
Passion!</P>
<P>Your L—'s Poetry in my Praise I never can forget; and as
it would be a Loss to the World, if any Part of so justly an admired
Author's Works should be bu∣ried in Oblivion; take, oh World! the following
Lines: 
<Q> 
<L>I scorn to drag about a Flame</L> 
<L>For any She, that thinks my Love Blame,</L> 
<L>I'll take a Resolution to be free,</L> 
<L>Without Return, I scorn to burn,</L> 
<L>And oh! I will be free.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="307"/>Your second Poem is, I confess, a little
obscure, yet, no doubt, may have much Meaning in it: 
<Q> 
<L>Oh thou,</L> 
<L>Jow Jow, Bow Wough!</L></Q></P>
<P>And indeed, I remember another R— R— Author, who
entertained some very polite Company with the following Epi∣taph, written as
he assured us, by himself, it is very laconic: 
<Q> 
<L>Here lies Major <HI>Brady,</HI> and St. <HI>Comeen,</HI></L> 
<L>Sure such a Saint, and such a Major never were
seen.</L></Q> If the curious Reader cannot digest this Heaven-born Verse,
why let him be gra∣minivercus, and chew the Cud.</P>
<P>But pray, my L—, do not you think it was a little ill judged
of you, to attack my Character at the Expence of your own? and to describe
yourself as such a Cormo∣rant in Love, that you must have two Fe∣males at
once; why, <HI>Turk Gregory</HI> never did such Feats in Arms; 
<Q><PB N="301" REF="308"/> 
<L>Oh rav'nous Hell Kite!</L> 
<L>Wou'dst thou have Maid, and Mistress</L> 
<L>At one fell 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Word admits of various Readings,
some call it <HI>Swoop,</HI> some <HI>Souse,</HI> some <HI>Swop,</HI>
which latter I chuse.</NOTE>Swop?</L></Q> Truth is, I am afraid this is
apocryphal, and will win no Credit, especially as it was after your
Expedition to the South of <HI>France,</HI> when you were ill of the —,
<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But prithee now, for I think I am en∣titled to talk a little
familiarly to you; do not boast of Abilities, either of Mind or Body, which
you never had; no Person living will believe you, any more than they would
me, if I should tell them I had been a great Beauty, when they could see no
Remains of it.</P>
<P>But you are, as the good Man said of <HI>Nero,</HI> a very
Wag!</P>
<P>Hang it, why should you and I go to Logger-heads? Order your
Equipage to drive here to-morrow Morning, and let us buss, as we used to
do, and be Friends.</P>
<P>Otherwise, I have two or three Pieces <PB N="302" REF="309"/> of
the same Stuff, of which I have given you Samples at your Service.</P>
<P>Lord, 'tis a strange Thing that all B— will needs be
Authors! now would they avoid manifesting their Dulness, we the illiterate
might conclude they were Men of profound Erudition, and that on that Account,
they were advanced to their high Stations: but the Devil owes some of them a
Shame, and is, when they do his Work, an excellent Paymaster; yet it is
strange, this same Dulness is not confined to them, it descends to
their Sons, witness our celebrated Comedy, <HI>The Suspicious Husband,</HI>
which, but for it's neither hav∣ing one Character well drawn, any Plot, any
thing like a Sentiment, and wrote too in a gallimawfry Stile, might be a good
Performance; but as long as it is stamped with a Name, it passes current,
tho' Ster∣ling No-Sense.</P>
<P>But, my L—d B—, tho' I have di∣gressed from you,
yet see my Love! I re∣turn again: Ah, it was well I did not, even from
Scripture, pick up an unsavory Si∣mile; I am much offended that you should 
<PB N="303" REF="310"/> say, when I was last at Shrift with your Holiness,
that we had no better Accom∣modation for our Feast of Love, but a Carpet,
whereas I insist on it, that the Pe∣nance you enjoyned me, was as easy as
a Down-bed could make it; so here I inva∣lidate your Evidence in one Point,
and the rest of your Accusation naturally falls to the Ground.</P>
<P>But being now tired at laughing at you, I'll tell you an
<HI>Arabian</HI> Tale. There was a really generous Man, who built a fine
Pa∣vilion, to which were an Hundred Open∣ings; as the Poor had free access to
it, they were relieved by him at every Opening and Avenue; they blessed his
Goodness, and his Fame flew far.</P>
<P>There was in his Neighbourhood the Son of an old Miser, who was
left im∣mensely rich; he was of a sordid Temper, yet emulous of Praise,
so he built such an∣other Pavilion, and in like Manner dis∣tributed Alms;
it so fortuned, that one old Man attacked him seven times in the same
Morning at seven of the Entrances, he met him again at the eighth, and
asked <PB N="304" REF="311"/> for an Alms, at this he lost all Patience, and
cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Did not I seven times re∣lieve you?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ah, quoth the poor Man, Lord bless my Lord
<HI>Aboulcasem,</HI> I have walked three hundred times round his Pavilion,
been three hundred times relieved, and yet I am certain he does not know my
Face.</Q></P>
<P>So, to apply the Story, God bless my dear loved Lord
<HI>Kingsborough,</HI> who gives Hundreds without blowing a Trumpet be∣fore his
good Deeds, or defaming the Cha∣racters of those whom his Bounty
blesses.</P>
<P>I have often been surprized at one of our C—s, which, to
shew my Charity, I will insert. 
<Q>O Lord, who alone workest great Mar∣vels! send down upon our
B— and C— the healthful Spirit of thy Grace.</Q>
<HI>Marvellous</HI> would it be indeed, if they had either <HI>Health,
Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Grace</HI>; no Doubt but the learned Compilers of the
Liturgy had their own Reasons for this supernatural Invocation; but why
nothing less than a <PB N="305" REF="312"/> Miracle should bless these,
any more than any other Order of Men, I leave to some future Commentators,
and hope they will oblige us with Annotations on this extra∣ordinary
Ejaculation.</P>
<P>I would not incur the Censure of the Cl— so far as to
give a Hint that they are not <HI>sound:</HI> No, no, many of them are; but
then it is so sound as things that are hollow, Impiety hath made a Feast
of them, and now that their Bones are mar∣rowless, their Blood is cold, and
Specula∣tion dwells not in their Eyes; they hate us Youth. Gorbellied K—,
Bacon fed! ah, would we had the shaking of their Bags! I knew one of them,
who, without the least Study, wrote the following two elegant and learned
Lines: 
<Q> 
<L>Yon slanting Mountains glow with blue Marine,</L> 
<L>And yon cornuted Moons two Horns give shine.</L></Q> I know
the Gentlemen had too much Mo∣desty and Diffidence of their own superior 
<PB N="306" REF="313"/> Talents to give their Works to the Press; but I hope,
as they are charitable, they won't be displeased, as they are above mak∣ing
Money of their Performances, that I should, since they, though but little,
serve to swell my Volume, and, no doubt, will edify my Readers. I think I
have nothing to boast of as a Writer, but a great Memory, for if I could not
have retained <HI>Shakespear, Milton,</HI> &amp;c. and the great Authors I
have last mentioned, to give a Taste of their Wit, when I was myself at a
Loss, I do not know how I could ever have com∣passed three Volumes of
Memoirs.</P>
<P>Indeed if I had printed all the Poetry that has been sent me for
that purpose, since I came to this Kingdom, it would have proved as odd a
Medley, as any thing ever yet exhibited to publick View. I suppose every
one who fancied they had Wit, had a mind to see how it would look in Print,
but I must beg to be excused. Though the learned Mr. <HI>Timothy
Ticklepitcher</HI> pres∣sed very hard for a Place, it would be a strong
Proof of my Vanity, to insert his anti sublime Compliments to me.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="314"/>Another poetical Gentleman wrote me a long
Letter in a Text Hand, which put me into a Palpitation of the Heart, as I was
about that time threatened, (for certain scan∣dalous Truths I have been
guilty of relat∣ing) with some Law; and truly I hate that as much as Sir
<HI>John Falstaff</HI> did Secu∣rity: When I, in plain <HI>English,</HI>
set down undeniable Facts, they menace me with Law, I would as lieve they
would stop my Mouth with Ratsbane: But I find I am like Sir <HI>John,</HI>
not only witty myself, but am also the Occasion that Wit is in others;
there is not an Halfpenny Paper can peep its Head out, but presently my Name
must be dragged in by Head and Shoulders to grace it. But to the Letter:
Having recovered my Spirits, I read it over; and found a great many
Compli∣ments, with a Promise, that the profound Author would wait on me at
Four o'Clock. I never thought of it till the time appointed, when 
<Q> 
<L>The punctual Devil kept his Word.</L></Q> 
<PB N="308" REF="315"/> I own I supposed he came to see if he could 
<Q> 
<L>Convey out of my Box of Hints by a Trick,</L> 
<L>Sincerely believing he dealt with Old Nick.</L></Q> And I
always suspect Falshood to lurk un∣der a full Peruke. He just came in
with a huge fat Man, as fat as Butter, with him, but would not stay, for
which Reason I will not print his fond Letter, so I think I am even with
him. If I were any way given to be proud, I think I have a great deal of
Reason to be so, since I cannot go any where, as I am not very well
known, but I hear some Piece of my own History, quite new. I am seen in
this Place and t'other Place, and say something mighty witty to be
sure!</P>
<P>I do not wonder that Persons of For∣tune and Distinction of
this Kingdom go to <HI>England</HI> to spend their Time and E∣states;
since here, be you as chaste as Ice, or pure as Snow, thou shalt not
escape Calumny, especially among your half-bred, half-witted Gentry, but 
<Q><PB N="309" REF="316"/> 
<L>Let my unhappy Tale be falsely told</L> 
<L>By the rash Young, or the ill-natur'd Old;</L> 
<L>Let ev'ry Tongue it's various Censures chuse,</L> 
<L>Absolve with Coldness, or with Spite ac∣cuse,</L> 
<L>Fair Truth, at last, her radiant Beams shall raise,</L> 
<L>And, Malice vanquish'd, heighten'd Vir∣tue's <HI>PRIOR</HI>
Praise.</L></Q></P>
<P>In <HI>London</HI> almost every one, in the mid∣dling State of
Life, has some Employment or Diversion to kill their Time; and here it is
the reverse, we are all Gentry, where∣fore the Females have no Amusement
but that of SLANDER.</P>
<P>Where 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Rufa,</HI> with her Comb of Lead,</L> 
<L>Whispers that <HI>Sappho</HI>'s Hair is red.</L></Q></P>
<P>I should be very glad, e'er they look for the Mote in my Eye,
they would be pleased to pull the Beam out of their own. I could mention
Numbers of these Scandal-mon∣gers, <PB N="310" REF="317"/> who have said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh Lord! may be she'll put us down in her
<HI>Memorials!</HI>"</Q> But goon, incorrigible Dunces, too contemp∣tible for
my Notice: All I shall beg of the <HI>Men</HI> is, never to believe any thing
that is said of me by a <HI>Woman,</HI> as it is more than Four to One it is
a Lye—But as the great <HI>Milton</HI>'s Genius could even descend to
Hell, so I think I must mention one Mrs. <HI>Ir—d—ll,</HI> who
hearing I got Money for my Work, a thing she could never do, exclaimed
bitterly against me, nay, even kept her Bed for a Week on Account of it, and
wrote two or three very stupid Pa∣pers against me; and though she could
not shew her Wit, at least shewed Envy, Ma∣lice, and all
Uncharitableness.</P>
<P>I know a very ingenious Gentleman, who, whenever he sees a
Parcel of Females seated at their Tea, names the Chamber
<HI>Pandaemonium</HI>; and Dr. <HI>Young,</HI> in one of his Satires, says, 
<Q> 
<L>Tea! how I tremble at the dreadful Stream!</L> 
<L>As <HI>Lethe</HI> fatal to the Love of Fame;</L> 
<L><PB N="311" REF="318"/>What Devastations on thy Banks are
seen,</L> 
<L>What Shades of mighty Names that once have been?</L></Q></P>
<P>And I really cannot remember ever to have seen a Set of Ladies
tippling this Li∣quor but Scandal strait ensued; ay, even amongst our new
Teachers, commonly called <HI>Moravians,</HI> amongst whom I had, in
<HI>London,</HI> the Misfortune to live, and whom, though they took
themselves to be inspired, I really always believed to be under the
Delusion of <HI>Satan.</HI></P>
<P>One of the holy Sisters once told me the Devil inspired
<HI>Milton:</HI> ay, and me into the Bargain: Truly she did his infernal
Majesty the greatest Honour he ever yet received, and I could not avoid
thinking her either very ignorant or very wicked; but I comforted myself with
hoping that the former was her Fault, and that she did not know how heinous a
Sin she commit∣ted, when she robbed the Maker of his Glory, and attributed
his best Gifts and Graces to the common Enemy of Man. I <PB N="312" REF="319"/> think I might justly apply to these Secta∣ries Mr.
<HI>Pope</HI>'s Lines: 
<Q> 
<L>'Tis your's a <HI>Bacon,</HI> and a <HI>Locke</HI> to
blame,</L> 
<L>A <HI>Newton</HI>'s Genius, and a Seraph's Flame;</L> 
<L>But, oh! with One, Immortal One dis∣pense</L> 
<L>The Source of <HI>Newton</HI>'s Light, and <HI>Ba∣con</HI>'s
Sense!</L> 
<L>Content each Emanation of his Fires,</L> 
<L>That beams on Earth; each Science he inspires,</L> 
<L>Each Art he prompts, each Charm he can create,</L> 
<L>Whate'er he gives, is giv'n for you to hate:</L> 
<L>Go on, by all divine in Man, unaw'd,</L> 
<L>But learn, ye Dunces, not to mock your God.</L></Q></P>
<P>I believe these Wretches would be very proud of being
persecuted; but our Go∣vernors, of the same Mind with the witty and gallant
Emperor <HI>Julian,</HI> vulgarly call∣ed the <HI>Apostate,</HI> will neither
hinder them to assemble, nor preach, any more <PB N="313" REF="320"/> than
he did the <HI>Galileans,</HI> unless they preach Sedition, and then they
come under the Penalty of the Law.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Julian!</HI> the Christians murdered him, for not
permitting them to murder each other. St. <HI>Gregory</HI> the Younger,
preaching old St. <HI>Gregory</HI>'s Funeral Ser∣mon, forty Years after the
Death of <HI>Julian,</HI> when one would have thought Resentment might be
also dead, (if he had any Cause for it) has these remarkable Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"And now, says he, here lies my Uncle dead, who
delivered you from the Persecution of that old Bull-burning Tyrant
<HI>Julian</HI>: Now, who had a greater Hand in his Death than my Uncle? For
once, when he and his Captain of the Archers came in to hear Mass, had he not
suddenly gone away, my Uncle would have kicked him."</Q> The Translator
says, he had more Difficulty with this Passage than all the rest of the
Work; for he would fain have had the Kicking intended for the Captain of the
Archers, not being able to conceive, that the Emperor of the World 
<PB N="314" REF="321"/> should be afraid that an old Priest should kick
him.</P>
<P>But the old Priest prophesied that such a Day this
Apostate should die, and truly he took especial Care that his Prophecy
should be fulfilled, by hiring one of the Emperor's own Soldiers to put him
to Death.</P>
<P>I could say something more; why should I not; nay, out it
must: I believe, if my favourite Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> had not behaved
himself with more good Manners than our modern <HI>New Lighters,</HI> he
would not have <HI>almost</HI> persuaded his Auditors to be Chri∣stians;
how noble is his Answer on the Oc∣casion?</P>
<P>But he was as remarkably a fine Gentle∣man, as he was a Saint, a
Martyr, and a Christian; like Dr. <HI>Delany,</HI> whose preaching goes
even to the dividing of the Blood and Spirit. And let me here, dear Sir, beg
you will fulfil a Promise you gave me many Years ago, that you would at∣tend
my last Moments; if I send to you, will you refuse to chear a dying
Sinner with Hope of Peace and Pardon; for the Doctrine of Damnation is now so
universally recei∣ved, <PB N="315" REF="322"/> that Half the World are cast
into Des∣pair.</P>
<P>These poor Enthusiasts used, in <HI>London,</HI> to
steal every thing they could lay their Hands on from me, insomuch that at
last they stole my one Pair of Shoes; and yet they brought Scripture
Authority for Theft, for they said the Children of <HI>Israel borrowed
Jewels of Gold and Silver</HI> of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> which they ran away
with, <HI>and they spoiled the</HI> Egyptians. I remember I once menti∣oned
this Passage to Dr. <HI>Delany,</HI> who understanding <HI>Hebrew</HI>
perfectly, turned over to it to there, where it is very differ∣rently related:
For the <HI>Egyptians</HI> finding so many Plagues brought on them, and
particularly the Leprosy, with which these People were all infected,
ordered them to depart, but they declared they would not go, unless their
Hire was paid to them, and also so many Changes of Apparel, and Jewels of
Gold, given to support them in their Pilgrimage; how they behaved
them∣selves in the Wilderness, is so well set forth in the <HI>Old
Testament,</HI> that it would puzzle a wiser Head than mine to know how
they <PB N="316" REF="323"/> became the peculiar Favourites of an im∣partial and
unprejudiced Deity.</P>
<P>Indeed it were to be wished, that ei∣ther this learned and
excellent Divine, or some other of equal Abilities, if such may be found,
would oblige the World with a new Translation of the <HI>Old
Testament,</HI> since, as we now have it, it seems filled with
Incon∣gruities, Indecencies, and shocking Absur∣dities, such as the Holy
Spirit could never have dictated, <HI>whose Body is Light, and whose Shadow
Truth.</HI></P>
<P>I beg pardon for this rambling Digres∣sion, and hope the
Divines will not censure me for it, as I only presume to give them Hints,
which their superior Knowledge may improve upon, 
<Q> 
<L>And justify the Ways of God to Man.</L></Q></P>
<P>For I intend not this Address to the ig∣norant Part of the
Clergy, who would many of them be more fit to till the Earth, than plant or
water the Gospel, but to the learn∣ed, just, and pious, that they may
remove Scruples from weak Minds, <HI>raise up those</HI> 
<PB N="317" REF="324"/> <HI>that are fallen, and finally, beat down Satan under
our Feet,</HI> which God of his infinite Mercy enable them to do, through the
Me∣rits and Mediation of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>But once more to return to my Shop. One Afternoon two young
Gentlemen came into it, one of whom asked me for some Tea; I told him, I
did not sell any, but that there was a Coffee-House next Door, where he
might be supplied: He asked me, would not I give a Dish of Tea to a
Friend, and Relation? I said, yes, with Pleasure: Why then, said he, this
Gentleman is Dean <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade</HI>'s
Son, of <HI>Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>,</HI> and my Name
is <HI>Bl—nd—n</HI>; as his Father was married to Brigadier
<HI>Meade's</HI> Widow, I gave them an Invitation into the Parlour, and ordered
some Tea to be got ready. I was really very glad to see any Person from
<HI>Ireland,</HI> particularly those I was allied to, nor could I conceive
that they came in that manner only to insult a Woman, who never of∣fended
either of them; indeed, as for the Dean's Son, I must acquit him, for he did
not affront me, but I took it ill he should bring with him a Fellow he knew
designed it.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="325"/>There was nothing gross, indecent,
abu∣sive, or unmannerly, which this Wretch did not, without the least
Provocation, say to me, till, at length, though I am not really of a
passionate Disposition, I lost all Pa∣tience, and thinking myself
very much his Betters, I asked him, whether his Father continued to sell
Butter-milk to the Poor at a Penny a Quart, with his own Hand, in a hard
Season, when every other Person gave their's away.</P>
<P>Upon this he very politely threatened to kick me, but as he was
then at a great Di∣stance from his own Dunghill, and I am sure I give
<HI>Castle-Bl—nd—n</HI> its proper Title when I stile it one, I
was not in the least intimidated, and only bade him go shew his Slaves how
choleric he was, and 
<Q> 
<L>Make his Bondmen tremble.</L></Q></P>
<P>And here excuse me, Sir, if I give your Picture to the World.
When you make Love, if any but the leaden-darted <HI>Cupid</HI> ever touched
your unworthy, groveling, base Heart, your Argument is that of a 
<PB N="219" REF="326"/> Highwayman's, you bring a loaden Pistol, clap it to
the Fair-one's Bosom, and say, 
<Q REND="inline">"De∣liver your Treasure, or you are
dead."</Q></P>
<P>Could not you have taken your ancient Father, the old Stick
picker's Advice, and have coaxed the Girl, and have given her a Cherry-coloured
Top-knot? but you 
<Q> 
<L>Were like the haughty, hot-brain'd <HI>Spa∣niard,</HI></L> 
<L>Instead of Love, you brought a Poignard.</L></Q></P>
<P>And filthy as your rotten Leg, and more corrupted Soul, must
have been every thing you could produce; for thou art the Quintessence of
Filth, and I am weary of writing, when every thing base, every thing low,
every thing insolent is the Theme, and all comprised in pretty Master
<HI>Jacky Bl—nd—n.</HI></P>
<P>As I have mentioned an Attempt to write a Play, which 
<Q> 
<L>—Is a bold Pretence</L> 
<L>To Learning, Genius, Wit, and Eloquence.</L></Q> 
<PB N="320" REF="327"/> I present my Readers with an Act of it, and would,
with great Pleasure, finish it, but that I am certain our present Manager
would never permit it to be played, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ly because it was mine; for since his Prejudice against me,
though how I incurred his Displeasure I know not, carried him him so far
as to say a Prologue I wrote for the King's Birth-Night was Blasphemy, I
don't know but he may be ingenious enough to prove the Play to be
High-Treason; but lest my Readers should be∣lieve me capable of writing
any thing like it, I present them with the Lines.

<P>One Day, as I was in my Shop, a Gen∣tleman, very richly
dressed, told me, he had a Letter for me; I received it very
respectfully, but could not help smiling, when I found it was the Letter I
wrote for <HI>Tom Brush,</HI> neatly copied and directed to me, and that,
lest it should miscarry, he had brought it himself.</P>
<P>I said it was a very genteel Piece of Gal∣lantry, and quite now.
He told me he <PB N="241" REF="348"/> was going to his Seat in the County of
<HI>Sur∣rey</HI> the next Day, and gave me a very kind Invitation to pass the
Remainder of the Summer there, but as he was a young, gay, single Gentleman,
I did not hold it convenient.</P>
<P>Pray, Madam, said he, do you never go to the Opera? No, really,
Sir; not but that I love Music, but it happens to be too expensive an
Entertainment for me: Well then, Madam, returned he, I must insist on
having the Honour of treating you to it; on which, he downright forced a
Cou∣ple of Guineas on me, and making me promise to correspond with him till
his Re∣turn to <HI>London,</HI> we parted.</P>
<P>Unfortunately I lost his Direction, and so had it not in my
Power to keep my Word.</P>
<P>And I do assure my Readers, I did not go to the Opera,
wisely considering that two Pound two, would be of infinitely more Service
to me, than it could possibly be to Mr. <HI>Heydeigger.</HI></P>
<P>But, alas! before the Return of Winter, I had neither Shop, nor
almost an Habi∣tation. <PB N="342" REF="349"/> By what strange Reverse of
For∣tune I was again reduced to the utmost Calamity, and by what unexpected
and sig∣nal Mercy delivered from it, must, as it is impossible for me
to get it into the Com∣pass of this Volume, be the Subject of a Third.</P>
<P>I should be highly ungrateful not to ac∣knowledge the Favour and
Bounty of the whole Body of the Nobility, Clergy, and Gentry of this Kingdom,
whose Goodness, as it is my highest Pride to own, so it shall ever be
my utmost Ambition to merit; and if their poor Servant can in the least
contribute to their Entertainment, she shall think herself over-paid, or,
to use my dear Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Words:

<L>As for what's left of Life, if yet 'twill do,</L> 
<L>'Tis at your Service, pleas'd while plea∣sing you.</L> 
<L>But then mistake me not, when you've enough,</L>

<L>I pipe no longer than you care to dance.</L></Q></P>
<P>But, oh my loved, honoured, and ex∣cellent Lord
<HI>Kingsborough!</HI> where shall I find Words adequate to the Sense I
have of your Goodness, your unlimited Gene∣rosity? thou kind Preserver of
mine, and my Son's Life! 
<Q> 
<L>Did Eloquence divine adorn my Speaking,</L> 
<L>Tho' ev'ry Muse, and ev'ry Grace should crown me,</L> 
<L>Why then, ev'n then, I should fall short</L> 
<L>Of my Soul's Meaning.</L></Q></P>
<P>But as with You my Muse began, with You also she must end,
yet not 'till I re∣late the following Story.</P>
<P>I saw in <HI>London</HI> the truly elegant and beautiful Speech
of a certain great Man, not long since our supreme Governor here; I was
really so charmed with it, that I wrote the following Lines, which I shewed
to Mr. <HI>Cibber.</HI> As his Excellency was re∣turned to <HI>England,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> was so well <PB N="344" REF="351"/> pleased with them,
that, as he was particu∣larly intimate with him, he undertook to deliver them,
and said, he did not doubt but he would give me a handsome Re∣ward: To give
this Thesis plainer Proof, I put it to the Test.

<P>I ought to have premised, that just as I had finished this
Poem, <HI>W—rsd—le</HI> came in, and snatched it from me,
saying he would send it himself to his old Friend <HI>Phil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p.</HI> I could not get it from him, but
as I remembered every Syllable of it, I wrote it in a better Hand than that
rough Draught I had given to Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and having the Honour of his
Correction, who <PB N="347" REF="354"/> is a fair and candid Critic, sent it
again to him.</P>
<P><HI>W—sd—le</HI> came in the Evening, told me that
the Earl sent him many Thanks, and would be glad to see his old Friend.</P>
<P>Upon this I asked <HI>W—rsd—le</HI> to lend me
Half a Crown to buy a Pair of Shoes, which he absolutely refusing, when he
had convinced me he had fifty Guineas in his Pocket, I, though ill-shod, was
obliged to rest contented.</P>
<P>Early next Morning I received from Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> the
following short Epistle: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Poetry of poor People, how∣ever it may rise in Value,
always sinks in the Price; what might in happier Hours have brought you ten
Guineas for it's intrinsic Worth, is now reduced to two, which I desire you
will come and re∣ceive from the Hand of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your old humble Servant, COLLEY
CIBBER.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="355"/>By this I found Mr.
<HI>W—rsd—le</HI> had boasted of an Interest in his
Excellency, which he certainly never had, for who would have even given me that
small Re∣ward that had received the Poem before from another Hand, would they
not have laughed at me!</P>
<P>I waited on Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> who told me he had given my Poem
to his Excellency with these Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"That if he had not thought it beautiful, he would
not have ta∣ken the Liberty of presenting it to him."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"As Dinner, said he, was just brought up my
Lord put it into his Pocket. In the Evening I reminded him of it: He told me he
was attack'd by all the World with paultry Rhimes, which his L—d always
best rewarded."</Q></P>
<P>The next Day Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> attacked his Excellency again,
and asked him how he liked the Lines? Upon which he said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh I had forgot, there's two Guineas for her, but
don't put them into your Sil∣ver Pocket, lest you should make a Mistake
and pay your Chair with them: <PB N="349" REF="356"/> So here, Madam, are the
two Guineas for you."</Q> As I was entirely indebted to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> for
this Bounty, I return my Acknowledgements to Him.</P>
<P>My dear Lord <HI>Kingsborough,</HI> I never should have
related this Story, except by way of Contrast to your amiable Virtues; for I
may justly say with <HI>Swift,</HI></P>
<P>My fav'rite Lord is none of those, 
<Q> 
<L>Who owe their Virtue to their Stations,</L> 
<L>Or Characters to Dedications;</L> 
<L>His Worth, altho a Poet said it</L> 
<L>Before a Play, would lose no Credit.</L> 
<L>Nor <HI>Swift</HI> would dare deny him Wit,</L> 
<L>Altho' to praise it I have writ.</L></Q></P>
<P>Just as I was writing about <HI>W—rsd—le,</HI> a
Gentleman brought me a Pamphlet en∣tituled, <HI>A Parallel between Mrs.</HI>
Pilking∣ton <HI>and Mrs.</HI> Phillips, <HI>written by an</HI> Ox∣ford
<HI>Scholar,</HI> as he tells us, himself, star∣ving in a Garret; Pray, Mr.
Scholar, deal ingenously did not <HI>W—rsd—le</HI> hire you to
write it, because he was indolent; dull, I <PB N="350" REF="357"/> suppose
you mean; if he can write so much better than I, let him give the World a
Proof of his Abilities; but it seems, he is discontented that I have not
sufficiently ex∣posed him: Why, let him have but a little Patience, and my
Life on't he shall have no Cause of Complaint on that Head, but I cannot
break in on the Order of Time so far as to give the World a second Act of
him, yet</P>
<P>Unity of Time and Place, you know, Mr. Critick, must be
observed, otherwise we must renounce the Stagyrite.</P>
<P>If you intend your Performance for a Satire on me, truly your
Words are so clerkly couched, that I cannot find any Sting in them.—You
say I admired the Dean for being a Brute.—<HI>N. B.</HI> You lye; and
none but a Villain would call him one. I admired his Charity, Wit, Sense,
Taste, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to say he had Passions, which ob∣scured
for a while his shining and uncom∣mon Excellencies, is no more than saying
he was human, and consequently liable to Error.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="358"/>Then you ask me, how I dare mention Mr.
<HI>Pope?</HI> Why truly, like <HI>Drawcansir,</HI> all this I can do,
because I dare.—I never refused doing Justice to his poetical
Merits; but all your Art can never per∣suade the World, that he was not an
en∣vious Defamer of other Men's good Parts, and intolerably vain of his own.
How does he boast of his Acquaintance with the Great, even to childish
Folly? The late Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> could not divert him∣self with
pruning a Tree in his Garden, but presently we are told of it in these
high∣sounding unharmonious Words: 
<Q> 
<L>And he, whose Thunder storm'd th'<HI>Iberian</HI>
Lines,</L> 
<L>Now forms my Quincunx, and now prues my Vines.</L></Q> Why,
one would have thought he had hired the Earl for a Gardener.</P>
<P>And as for his Gratitude, let that appear by his Poem, called
<HI>Taste,</HI> wherein he abuses the late Duke of <HI>Chandos</HI> for his
Munificence to Writers, whereof take the following Sample: 
<Q><PB N="352" REF="359"/> 
<L>His Wealth Lord <HI>Timon</HI> gloriously con∣founds,</L> 
<L>Ask'd for a Groat, he gives an hundred Pounds;</L> 
<L>Or, if three Ladies like a luckless Play,</L> 
<L>Takes the whole House upon the Author's Day.</L></Q> Was
this any Defect in his Grace's Charac∣ter, especialy in a poetical Eye? No,
surely: but I suppose Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was angry, as he was not a
Dramatick Writer, that his Grace should bestow any Favour on them.</P>
<P>He then proceeds to ridicule his Grace's Library, and the Grandeur
and Magnifi∣cence of his Improvements. 
<Q> 
<L>And when up ten steep Slopes you've drag'd your Thighs,</L> 
<L>Just at his Study-door he'll bless your Eyes.</L> 
<L>His Study! with what Authors is it stor'd?</L> 
<L>In Books, not Authors, curious is my Lord.</L> 
<L><PB N="353" REF="360"/>To all their letter'd Backs he turns you
round,</L> 
<L>These <HI>Aldus</HI> printed, these <HI>De Sewel</HI>
bound:</L> 
<L>These, Sir, are <HI>Elziver</HI>'s, and those as good,</L>

<L>For all his Lordship knows they are but Wood;</L> 
<L>For <HI>Locke</HI> or <HI>Milton</HI> 'tis in vain to
look,</L> 
<L>These Shelves admit not any modern Book.</L></Q> I
suppose, because he did not find his own Works there, he resolved at
all Hazards to depreciate his Betters. Shall I proceed, or have I said enough

<Q>To thee, who hast not Ear, nor Eye, nor Soul to comprehend
it.</Q></P>
<P>And now, how dare you to abuse my Husband? Why, thou, poor
paultry Gar∣retteer! thou starveling Bard! if I have a Mind to do it
myself, what's that to you? 
<Q> 
<L>The distant <HI>Trojan</HI> never injur'd thee.</L> 
<BIBL>Pope's Homer.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q><PB N="354" REF="361"/> 
<L>And suppose I've a Mind for to drub,</L> 
<L>Whose Bones is it, Sir, I must lick?</L> 
<L>At whose Expence is it, you Scrub?</L> 
<L>You are not to find me a Stick.</L></Q> Poor Creature! and as
you say you are in Necessity, I hope you will be relieved, even by
putting together 
<Q> 
<L>Figures ill-pair'd, and Similies unlike:</L> 
<L><HI>Letty</HI> and <HI>Conny,</HI> pious, precious
Pair!</L></Q> I suppose this this is an Allusion to <HI>Nisus</HI> and
<HI>Euryalus</HI>; but prithee learn more Wit, 
<Q> 
<L>Than to make ill-coupled Hounds</L> 
<L>Drag different Ways in miry Grounds.</L></Q> For I am certain
I never was a Match for Mrs. <HI>Philips,</HI> either in Beauty or in Art, in
both of which she reigns unrivalled, and I, as in Duty bound, give her the
Pre∣eminence. But 
<Q> 
<L>I imagine this <HI>Oxonian</HI> sitting on his Bed,</L> 
<L>One greasy Stocking round his Head,</L> 
<L><PB N="355" REF="362"/>While t'other he sits down to
darn,</L> 
<L>With Threads of different colour'd Yarn;</L> 
<L>The Remnants of his last Night's Pot</L> 
<L>On Embers plac'd, to make it hot;</L> 
<L>But now if <HI>W—dale</HI> deign to drop</L> 
<L>A Slice of Bread, or Mutton-chop,</L> 
<L>Mounting he writes, and writing sings,</L> 
<L>While, from beneath, all <HI>Grub-street</HI> rings.</L> 
<BIBL>Swift.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Ha! have I guessed right? thou wicked Scribbler, that
praisest the Worst best, and Best worst; thou art just fit to
nurture Fools, and chronicle Small-beer.</P>
<P>Now to criticize on your wonderful Work: In the first Place, you
say all my Characters are well drawn, easy, natural and picturesque; and
yet after this high Compliment, that I even made a dull Story entertaining by
the Force of a spark∣ling Wit, and retentive Memory; why, presently after I
dwindle, by the Force of your Pen, into a mere Dunce: And so though you
promised us a Parallel, you give us a Contrast; you are a very witty
Fellow, I assure you, and deal much in <PB N="356" REF="363"/> the
Surprizing. And so you do not like my Poetry, there was no Thought of
pleasing you when it was writ; but go to my Treasurer, tell him I order him
to give you three hundred Kicks in private, and the Lord send you a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter Taste!</P>
<P>Hey-day, the Devil rides on a Fiddle∣stick! fresh News
arrived! all my Letters to <HI>W—rsd—le</HI> to be published;
oh terrible! well; I hope he will publish every Poem that was inclosed in
them, that I may come by my own again? let him return to me three Operas,
twenty-five Odes, the Let∣ters I wrote for him, the Poem which begins, 
<Q> 
<L>To distant Climes, while fond <HI>Cleora</HI> flies.</L></Q>
And then he has my full Leave to publish every Letter of mine that he thinks
will serve his Purpose; but remember that if you and he should sit
down, and out of your own Loggerheads write Nonsense, and offer it to the
World as mine, I enter my <HI>Caveat,</HI> and will not adopt the spurious
Issue. So here I quit ye, and upon mature <PB N="357" REF="364"/>
Deliberation, am sorry I wasted so much Time, Paper, and Ink, on so
contemptible a Subject as either of ye.</P>
<P>My Lord, I beg Pardon for so long di∣gressing from my
darling Theme, but it was almost impossible for me not to <HI>bestow
those Libellers a Lash</HI>; 
<Q> 
<L>For, tho' tis hopeless to reclaim them,</L> 
<L>Scorpion Rods perhaps may tame them.</L> 
<BIBL>Swift.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And though it is not in reality worth while to pursue
Grashoppers, who die in a Season, yet while their Noise offends me, I
cannot forbear it.</P>
<P>And, now my Lord, and oh! (since you permit me to call you by
that tender Name) my Friend, and let me add, my Guardian Angel; for surely,
very excellent has thy Favour been to me, far surpassing that of Kindred,
as you generously bid me name my Wish to you, and obtain it; and as I,
broken with the Storms of Fortune, for I may truly say with Holy
<HI>David,</HI> to my Creator, 
<Q><PB N="358" REF="365"/>Even from my Youth up, thy Terrors have I
suffered with a troubled Mind, and thou hast vexed me with all thy
Storms.</Q> Have little to hope for on this Side Disso∣lution, and have no
other Concern about parting with a Life, which has been but a continual Scene
of Sorrow, except that of leaving my Son unprovided for: Let your Favour extend
to him, as your Station and Virtue must ever give you a powerful In∣terest;
use a Portion of it to get him some little Employment, or Place, which may
give him Bread, when I no more want it.</P>
<P>I flatter myself he will not be entirely unworthy of your
Goodness, as he is of a generous, humane, and grateful Dispo∣sition.</P>
<P>I must beg your Lordship's Pardon for praising my Son, which
indeed, I should not do, but that both his Father and Mr. <HI>A—e,</HI>
endeavoured all in their Power to injure his Character; the latter of whom is
since convinced he wronged him.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="366"/>And here I must apologize for so long
deferring the Publication of this Second Volume; and as no Reason is so
good as the true one, take it as follows:</P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Ireland,</HI> I took a House near
<HI>Bow-Bridge,</HI> as well for the Pleasure of a fine Art, as to keep
retired from busy Tongues; but, finding it was highly inconvenient to be at
such a Distance from Printers, Stationers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I took a
First-Floor in <HI>Abbey-Street,</HI> and having my own Furniture, sent it
there, with Orders to the Men to put up the Beds, which accordingly was done:
When I came in the Evening to take Possession of my new Habitation,
be∣hold all my Furniture was torn down, and lying in Heaps in the Passage;
when I demanded the Cause of this, I was told, the Reverend Dr. <HI>J—n
V—ey,</HI> who, it seems, lodged in the House, had, by his own
special Authority, commanded the Goods should be thrown into the Street,
but the Landlord knowing himself liable to be called to an Account for what
he had <PB N="360" REF="367"/> received, did not chuse to obey him in that
Article.</P>
<P>Well, as my House was empty, I knew not where I, or my Child
could sleep that Night, but, as I was not ill-beloved in the Neighbourhood I
left, I went back to it, where a good Woman gave me part of her Bed, and her
Husband, my Son, and two little Children of theirs, lay together.</P>
<P>Early next Morning, my Son took a Lodging for me in
<HI>Big-butter-lane</HI>; my Goods, damaged as they were, were carried there,
but, wot you well, the Parson fol∣lowed them! Dr. <HI>V—ey,</HI> I
mean, told the People I was a very bad Woman, and they were again left in the
Passage; so when I came, there was no Entrance for me, and I was obliged
to return to the Place from whence I came. <HI>Mem.</HI> I was forty Shillings
out of Pocket by this pious Divine, I wish he would pay me.</P>
<P>Next Day my Son took a Lodging for me in <HI>Gol en-lane,</HI>
where the Woman no sooner understood I was Dr. <HI>Van Lewin</HI>'s
Daughter, who, as she said, saved her Life, but she gladly accepted of
me for a Lodger; <PB N="361" REF="368"/> but what with the Vexation of my Mind,
and the Cold I had got, I fell into a violent Fever, and was for many Weeks
confined to my Bed, till, by the Care and Skill of Dr. <HI>Ould,</HI> I was
once more enabled to pur∣sue my Work; and, as I am much indebted to his
Humanity, I take this Opportunity of acknowledging it.</P>
<P>And now do I expect an Army of Cri∣tics to attack my poor Work,
and to save them the Trouble, I will even do it my∣self, altho' I own the
Task to be a little un∣grateful. But, Mrs. <HI>Pilkington,</HI>
notwith∣standing the Regard and Affection which I really have for you, I
must tell you what the World says of you; but however, I will give you fair
Play, and allow you to make the best Defence you can for your∣self:
Suppose you and I enter into a Dia∣logue, I being the Accuser, begin:
Ma∣dam, your Story has nothing in it, either new or entertaining; the
Occurrences are common, trivial, and such as happen every Day; your Vanity is
intolerable, your Stile borrowed from <HI>Milton, Shakespear</HI> 
<PB N="362" REF="369"/> and <HI>Swift,</HI> whom you pretend to describe,
though you never knew him; you tell us a Story of his Beef being
over-roasted, and another of a mangy Dog; fine Themes truly! for my Part, I
wonder you ever got a Shilling for your curious Performance; I am sure it is
a Proof of the Stupidity of the <HI>Boeotians,</HI> who, tho' they have still
done you the Honour to advertise in every Paper, that you were not a Dunce,
proved themselves to be little better for taking so much Notice of you.</P>
<P><HI>Myself.</HI> Hold, hold, you charge me so fast you do
not give me Leave to reply; to your first Article I plead guilty; my Story is
dull enough, it was therefore I strove to embellish it with such poetical
Ornaments, as I could beg, borrow, or steal: I have known a Gentleman write a
<HI>Latin</HI> Poem, and every Line of it was borrowed from the Classicks,
yet this was esteemed a Beauty in him; why then should it be deemed a Fault
in your humble Servant? Had I not an equal Right to make free with <HI>Milton,
Swift,</HI> and <HI>Shakespear,</HI> as he had with <HI>Vir∣gil</HI> and
<HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> O lud, lud! why the best Part of your first
Volume, is that which you wrote from yourself, without these
Auxiliaries.</P>
<P><HI>Myself.</HI> Oh, upon my Word you com∣pliment now.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="370"/><HI>I.</HI> Truly, I did not intend it, but
we would rather have some of your own Stuff.</P>
<P><HI>Myself.</HI> Why I must bring you a Simile from what I do
not much deal in, that is, Needle-work; do not Ladies buy coarse Canvass,
and work thereon Fruits, Flowers, Trees, all Summer, and all Autumn's Pride?
and should we say the Canvas would have been better without the Artist's
curi∣ous Embroidery; the same will hold in Painting.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> O come, do not think to put us off at this Rate, you
give us Quotation on Quotation; why, we know the Works of other Writers, and
expected something en∣tirely new from your superior Pen.</P>
<P><HI>Myself.</HI> I am sorry it is not in my Power to oblige
you, but Kings and Prophets, who lived before me, have declared, there was
nothing new under the Sun.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> But you shew no Reverence, either to Ermin, Crape or
Lawn.</P>
<P><HI>Myself.</HI> O I really do, when the Wearers deserve them;
but I hope you would not have me pay Homage to the Things them∣selves? Why
then, I may go and kneel down to all the Goods in the Shops, because as the
Author of <HI>The Tale of a Tub,</HI> says, in them we live, move, and have
our Be∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="371"/><HI>I.</HI> But have you no farther Regard
to Station? Is your licentious Pen to lash all Orders and Degrees of People?
are you to indulge your laughing, and lashing Hu∣mour, at every Bodies
Expence.</P>
<P><HI>Myself.</HI> Why, sure I have a Right to it; have they not
laughed and lashed me round? This is but a Retaliation, they were the first
Aggressors; no Person who did not deserve a Stripe, ever got one from
me: Is Station a Privilege for doing every Thing Evil with Impunity? If so,
let <HI>Satan</HI> on his burning Throne be honoured!</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> Well, upon my Word, Mrs. <HI>Pil∣kington,</HI> I am
weary of your Arguments; you seem resolved to get the better of me, and
<HI>that</HI> my Readers may always be assured I will do, when I am both
Plaintiff and Defendant.</P>
<P>And I assure my Readers, that if my Third Volume is not filled
with more sur∣prizing Events, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>finitely more enter∣taining than either of the foregoing, I will for
ever quit my Magic Art, and 
<Q> 
<L>Deeper than did ever Plummet sound,</L> 
<L>I'll drown my Book.</L>
