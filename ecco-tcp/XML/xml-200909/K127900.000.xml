<HEAD>THE HERMIT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAR in a Wild, unknown to public View,</L>
<L>From Youth to Age a rev'rend <HI>Hermit</HI> grew;</L>
<L>The Moss his Bed, the Cave his humble Cell,</L>
<L>His Food the Fruits, his Drink the chrystal Well:</L>
<L>Remote from Man, with God he pass'd the Days,</L>
<L>Pray'r all his Bus'ness, all his Pleasure Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Life so sacred, such serene Repose,</L>
<L>Seem'd Heav'n itself, 'till one Suggesstion rose;</L>
<L>That Vice should triumph, Virtue Vice obey,</L>
<L>This sprung some Doubt of Providence's Sway:</L>
<L>His Hopes no more a certain Prospect boast,</L>
<L>And all the Tenour of his Soul is lost:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3"/>So when a smooth Expanse receives imprest</L>
<L>Calm Nature's Image on it's wat'ry Breast,</L>
<L>Down bend the Banks, the Trees depending grow,</L>
<L>And Skies beneath with answ'ring Colours glow:</L>
<L>But if a Stone the gentle Scene divide,</L>
<L>Swift ruffling Circles curl on ev'ry Side,</L>
<L>And glimmering Fragments of a broken Sun,</L>
<L>Banks, Trees, and Skies, in thick Disorder run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To clear this Doubt, to know the World by Sight,</L>
<L>To find if Books, or Swains, report it right;</L>
<L>(For yet by Swains alone the World he knew,</L>
<L>Whose Feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly Dew)</L>
<L>He quits his Cell; the Pilgrim-Staff he bore,</L>
<L>And fix'd the Scallop in his Hat before;</L>
<L>Then with the Sun a rising Journey went,</L>
<L>Sedate to think, and watching each Event.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Morn was wasted in the pathless Grass,</L>
<L>And long and lonesome was the Wild to pass;</L>
<L>But when the <HI>Southern</HI> Sun had warm'd the Day,</L>
<L>A Youth came posting o'er a crossing Way;</L>
<L>His Rayment decent, his Complexion fair,</L>
<L>And soft in graceful Ringlets wav'd his Hair.</L>
<L>Then near aproaching, Father Hail! he cry'd,</L>
<L>And Hail, my Son, the rev'rend Sire reply'd;</L>
<L>Words followed Words, from Question Answer flow'd</L>
<L>And talk of various kind deceiv'd the Road;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>'Till each with other pleas'd, and loth to part,</L>
<L>While in their Age they differ, join in Heart:</L>
<L>Thus stands an aged Elm and Ivy bound,</L>
<L>Thus youthful Ivy clasps an Elm around.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now sunk the sun; the closing Hour of Day</L>
<L>Came onward, mantled o'er with sober grey;</L>
<L>Nature in Silence bid the World repose:</L>
<L>When near the Road a stately Palace rose:</L>
<L>There by the Moon thro' Ranks of Trees they pass,</L>
<L>Whose Verdure crown'd their sloping Sides of Grass.</L>
<L>It chanc'd the noble Master of the Dome,</L>
<L>Still made his House the wand'ring Strangers home:</L>
<L>Yet still the Kindness, from a Thirst of Praise,</L>
<L>Prov'd the vain Flourish of expensive Ease.</L>
<L>The Pair arriv'd: the liv'ry Servants wait;</L>
<L>The Lord receives them at the pompous Gate.</L>
<L>The Table groans with costly Piles of Food,</L>
<L>And all is more than Hospitably good,</L>
<L>Then led to rest, the Day's long Toil they drown,</L>
<L>Deep sunk in Sleep, and Silk, and Heaps of Down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At lenth'tis Morn, and at the Dawn of Day,</L>
<L>Along the wide Canals the <HI>Zephyrs</HI> Play;</L>
<L>Fresh o'er the gay Parterres the Breezes creep,</L>
<L>And shake the neigh'bring Wood to banish Sleep,</L>
<L>Up rise the Guests, obedient to the Call,</L>
<L>An early Banquet deck'd the splendid Hall;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5"/>Rich lucious Wine a golden Goblet grac't,</L>
<L>Which the kind Master sorc'd the Guests to taste.</L>
<L>Then pleas'd and thankful from the Porch they go,</L>
<L>And, but the Landlord, none had cause of Woe;</L>
<L>His <HI>Cup</HI> was vanish'd; for in secret Guise</L>
<L>The younger Guest purloin'd the glittering Prize.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As one who spiss a Serpent in his Way,</L>
<L>Glist'ning and basking in the Summer Ray,</L>
<L>Disorder'd stops to shun the Danger near,</L>
<L>Then walks with Faintness on, and looks with Fear;,</L>
<L>So seem'd the Sire; when far upon the Road,</L>
<L>The shining Spoil his wilely Partner show'd:</L>
<L>He stopp'd with Silence, walk'd with trembling Heart,</L>
<L>And much he wish'd, but durst not ask to part:</L>
<L>Murm'ring he lifts his Eyes, and thinks it hard,</L>
<L>That generous Actions meet a base Reward.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus they pass, the Sun his Glory shrouds,</L>
<L>The changing Skies hang out their Sable Clouds,</L>
<L>A Sound in Air presag'd approaching Rain,</L>
<L>And Beasts to covert scud a-cross the Plain.</L>
<L>Warn'd by the Signs, the wand'ring Pair retreat.</L>
<L>To seek, for Shelter at a neighb'ring Seat.</L>
<L>'Twas built with Turrets, on a rising Ground,</L>
<L>And strong, and large, unimprov'd around;</L>
<L>Its Owner's Temper, tim'rous and severe,</L>
<L>Unkind and griping, caus'd a Desert there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<L>As near the <HI>Miser</HI>'s heavy Doors they drew,</L>
<L>Fierce rising Gusts with sudden Fury blew;</L>
<L>The nimble Light'ning mix'd with Show'rs began,</L>
<L>And o'er their Heads loud rolling Thunder ran.</L>
<L>Here long they knock, but knock or call in vain,</L>
<L>Driv'n by the Wind, and batter'd by the Rain.</L>
<L>At lenth some Pity warm'd the Master's Breast,</L>
<L>('Twas then, his Threshold first receiv'd a Guest)</L>
<L>Slow creaking turns the Door with jealous Care,</L>
<L>And half he welcomes in the shivering Pair;</L>
<L>One frugal Faggot lights the naked Walls,</L>
<L>And Nature's Fervor thro' their Limbs recals:</L>
<L>Bread of the coursest sort, with eager Wine,</L>
<L>(Each hardly granted) serv'd them both to dine;</L>
<L>And when the Tempest first appear'd to cease,</L>
<L>A ready warning bid them part in Peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With still Remark the pond'ring <HI>Hermit</HI> view'd</L>
<L>In one so rich, a Life so poor and rude;</L>
<L>And why shou'd such, (within himself he cry'd,)</L>
<L>Lock the lost Wealth a thousand want beside?</L>
<L>But what new Marks of Wonder soon took place,</L>
<L>In ev'ry settling Feature of his Face!</L>
<L>When from his Vest the young Companion bore</L>
<L>That <HI>Cup,</HI> the gen'rous Landlord own'd before,</L>
<L>And paid profusely with the precious Bowl</L>
<L>The stinted Kindness of this churlish Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<L>But now the Clouds in airy Tumult fly,</L>
<L>The Sun emerging ope's an azure Sky;</L>
<L>A fresher green the smeling Leaves display,</L>
<L>And glitt'ring as they tremble, chear the Day:</L>
<L>The Weather courts them from the poor Retreat,</L>
<L>And the glad Master bolts the wary Gate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While hence they walk, the <HI>Pilgrim</HI>'s Bosom wrought,</L>
<L>With all the Travel of uncertain Thought;</L>
<L>His Partner's Acts without their Cause appear,</L>
<L>'Twas there a Vice, and seem'd a Madness here:</L>
<L>Detesting that, and pitying this he goes,</L>
<L>Lost and confounded with the various Shows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Night's dim Shades again involve the Sky;</L>
<L>Again the Wand'rers want a Place to lye,</L>
<L>Again they search, and find a Lodging nigh.</L>
<L>The Soil improv'd around, the Mansion neat,</L>
<L>And neither poorly low, nor idly great:</L>
<L>It seem'd to speak its Master's turn of Mind,</L>
<L>Content, and not for Praise, but Virtue kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hither the Walkers turn with weary Feet</L>
<L>Then bless the Mansion, and the Master greet:</L>
<L>Their greeting fair bestow'd, with modest Guise,</L>
<L>The courteous Master hears, and thus replies:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Without a vain, without a grudging Heart,</L>
<L>To Him who gives us all, I yield a Part;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="8"/>From Him you come, from Him accept it here,</L>
<L>A frank and sober, more than costly Cheer.</L>
<L>He spoke, and bid the welcome Table spread,</L>
<L>Then talk'd of Virtue till the Time of Bed,</L>
<L>When the grave Houshold round his Hall repair,</L>
<L>Warn'd by a Bell, and close the Hours with Pray'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length the World renew'd by calm Repose</L>
<L>Was strong for Toil, the dappled Morn arose;</L>
<L>Before the Pilgrims part, the Younger crept,</L>
<L>Near the clos'd Cradle where an Infant slept,</L>
<L>And writh'd his Neck, the Landlord's little Pride,</L>
<L>O Strange Return! grew black, and gasp'd, and dy</L>
<L>Horrour of Horrours! what! his only Son!</L>
<L>How look'd our Hermit when the Fact was done?</L>
<L>Not Hell, tho' Hell's black Jaws in sunder part,</L>
<L>And breathe blue Fire, cou'd more assault his Hea</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Confus'd, and struck with Silence at the Deed,</L>
<L>He flies, but trembling fails to fly with Speed.</L>
<L>His Steps the Youth pursues; the Country lay</L>
<L>Perplex'd with Roads, a Servant show'd the Way:</L>
<L>A River cross'd the Path; the Passage o'er</L>
<L>Was nice to find, the Servant trod before;</L>
<L>Long Arms of Oak an open Bridge supply'd,</L>
<L>And deep the Waves beneath the Bending glide.</L>
<L>The Youth, who seem'd to watch a Time to sin,</L>
<L>Approach'd the careless Guide, and thrust him in;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="9"/>Plunging he falls, and rising lists his Head,</L>
<L>Then flashing turns, and sinks among the Dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wild, sparkling Rage inflames the Father's Eyes,</L>
<L>He bursts the Bands of Fear, and madly cries,</L>
<L>Detested Wretch—but scarce his Speech began,</L>
<L>When the strange Partner seem'd no longer Man.</L>
<L>His youthful Face grew more serenely sweet;</L>
<L>His Robe turn'd white, and flow'd upon his Feet;</L>
<L>Fair Rounds of radiant Points invest his Hair;</L>
<L>Celestial Odours breathe thro' purpled Air;</L>
<L>And Wings, whose Colours glitter'd on the Day,</L>
<L>Wide at his Back their gradual Plumes display.</L>
<L>The Form Etherial bursts upon his Sight,</L>
<L>And moves in all the Majesty of Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' loud at first the Pilgrim's Passion grew,</L>
<L>Sudden he gaz'd, and wist not what to do;</L>
<L>Surprize in secret Chains his Word suspends,</L>
<L>And in a Calm his settling Temper ends.</L>
<L>But Silence here the beauteous Angel broke,</L>
<L>The Voice of Music ravish'd as he spoke.)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy Pray'r, thy Praise, thy Life to Vice unknown,</L>
<L>In sweet Memorial rise before the Throne:</L>
<L>These Charms, Success in our bright Region find,</L>
<L>And force an Angel down, to calm thy Mind;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="10"/>For this commission'd, I forsook the Sky:</L>
<L>Nay, cease to kneel—thy fellow Servant I.</L>
</LG>

<L>Then know the Truth of Government divine,</L>
<L>And let these Scruples be no longer thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Maker justly claims that World he made,</L>
<L>In this the Right of Providence is laid;</L>
<L>Its sacred Majesty thro' all depends</L>
<L>On using second Means to work his Ends:</L>
<L>'Tis thus, withdrawn in State from human Eye,</L>
<L>The Pow'r exerts his Attributes on high,</L>
<L>Your Actions uses, not controuls your Will,</L>
<L>And bids the doubting Sons of Men be still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What strange Events can strike with more Surpriz</L>
<L>Than those which lately strook thy wond'ring Eyes:</L>
<L>Yet taught by these, confess th'Almighty just,</L>

<L>Has, with the Cup, the graceless Custom lost,</L>

<L>The mean, suspicious Wretch, whose bolted Door<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>Ne'er mov'd in Duty to the wand'ring Poor;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="11"/>With him I left the Cup, to teach his Mind</L>
<L>That Heav'n can bless, if Mortals will be kind.</L>
<L>Conscious of wanting Worth, he views the Bowl,</L>
<L>And feels Compassion touch his grateful Soul.</L>
<L>Thus Artists melt the sullen Oar of Lead,</L>
<L>With heaping Coals of Fire upon its Head;</L>
<L>In the kind Warmth the Metal learns to glow,</L>
<L>And loose from Dross, the Silver runs below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long had our, pious Friend in Virtue trod,</L>
<L>But now the Child half-wean'd his Heart from God,</L>
<L>(Child of his Age) for him he liv'd in Pain,</L>
<L>And measur'd back his Steps to Earth again.</L>
<L>To what Excesses had his Dotage run?</L>
<L>But God, to save the Father, took the Son,</L>
<L>To all but thee, in Fits he seem'd to go,</L>
<L>(And 'twas my Ministry to deal the Blow)</L>
<L>The poor fond Parent humbled in the Dust,</L>
<L>Now owns in Tears the Punishment was just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But how had all his Fortune felt a Wrack,</L>
<L>Had that false Servant sped in Safety back?</L>
<L>This Night his treasur'd Heaps he meant to steal,</L>
<L>And what a fund of Charity wou'd fail!</L>

<HEAD>A NIGHT PIECE, ON DEATH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BY the blue Tapers trembling Light,</L>
<L>No more I waste the wakeful Night.</L>
<L>Intent with endless View to pore</L>
<L>The Schoolmen and the Sages o'er:</L>
<L>Their Books from Wisdom widely stray,</L>
<L>Or point at best the longest Way.</L>
<L>I'll seek a readier Path, and go</L>
<L>Where Wisdom's surely taught below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How deep yon Azure dies the sky!</L>
<L>Where Orbs of Gold unnumber'd lye,</L>
<L>While thro' their Ranks in silver pride</L>
<L>The nether Crescent seems to glide.</L>
<L>The slumb'ring Breeze forgets to breathe,</L>
<L>The Lake is smooth and clear beneath,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="22"/>Where once again the spangle Snow</L>
<L>Descends to meet our Eyes below.</L>
<L>The Grounds which on the right aspire,</L>
<L>In dimness, from the View retire:</L>
<L>The Left presents a Place of Graves,</L>
<L>Whose Wall the silent Water leaves.</L>
<L>That Steeple guides thy doubtful sight</L>
<L>Among the livid gleams of Night.</L>
<L>There pass with melancholly State,</L>
<L>By all the solemn Heaps of Fate,</L>
<L>And think, as softly-sad you tread</L>
<L>Above the venerable Dead,</L>
<L>Time was, like thee they Life possest,</L>
<L>And Time shall be, that thou shalt Rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Those Graves, with bending Osier bound,</L>
<L>That nameless heave the crumbled Ground,</L>
<L>Quick to the glancing Thought disclose</L>
<L>Where Toil and Poverty repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The flat smooth Stones that bear a Name,</L>
<L>The Chissel's slender help to Fame,</L>
<L>(Which e'er our Set of Friends decay</L>
<L>Their frequent Steps may wear away.)</L>
<L>A middle Race of Mortals own,</L>
<L>Men, half ambitious, all unknown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Marble Tombs that rise on high,</L>
<L>Whose Dead in vaulted Arches lye;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="23"/>Whose Pillars swell with sculptur'd Stones,</L>
<L>Arms, Angels, Epitaphs, and Bones,</L>
<L>These (all the poor Remains of State)</L>
<L>Adorn the Rich, or praise the Great;</L>
<L>Who while on Earth in Fame they live,</L>
<L>Are senseless of the Fame they give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ha! while I gaze, pale <HI>Cynthia</HI> fades,</L>
<L>The bursting Earth unveils the Shades!</L>
<L>All slow, and wan, and wrap'd with Shrouds,</L>
<L>They rise in visionary Crouds,</L>
<L>And all with sober Accent cry,</L>
<L>Think, Mortal, what it is to dye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now from yon black and fun'ral Yew,</L>
<L>That bathes the Charnel House with Dew,</L>
<L>Methinks I hear a Voice begin;</L>
<L>(Ye Ravens, cease your croaking Din,</L>
<L>Ye tollings Clocks, no Time resound</L>
<L>O'er the long Leak and midnight Ground)</L>
<L>It sends a Peal of hollow Groans,</L>
<L>Thus speaking from among the Bones,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Men my Scythe and Darts supply,</L>
<L>How great a King of Fears am I!</L>
<L>They view me like the last of Things:</L>
<L>They make, and then they dread, my Stings.</L>
<L>Fools! if you less provok'd your Fears,</L>
<L>No more my Spectre-Form appears.</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="24" MS="y"/>Death's but a Path that must be trod,</L>
<L>If Man wou'd ever pass to God:</L>
<L>A Port of Calms, a State of Ease</L>
<L>From the rough Rage of swelling Seas.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why then thy flowing Sable Stoles,</L>
<L>Deep pendent Cypress, mourning Poles,</L>
<L>Loose Scarfs to fall athwart thy Weeds,</L>
<L>Long Palls, drawn Herses, cover'd Steeds,</L>
<L>And Plumes of black, that as they tread,</L>
<L>Nod o'er the 'Scutcheons of the Dead?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor can the parted Body know,</L>
<L>Nor wants the Soul, these Forms of woe:</L>
<L>As Men who long in Prison dwell,</L>
<L>With Lamps that glimmer round the Cell,</L>
<L>When e'er their suffering Years are run,</L>
<L>Spring forth to greet the glitt'ring Sun:</L>
<L>Such Joy, tho' far transcending Sense,</L>
<L>Have pious Souls at parting hence.</L>
<L>On Earth, and in the Body plac't,</L>
<L>A few, and evil Years, they waste:</L>
<L>But when their Charms are cast aside,</L>
<L>See the glad Scene unfolding wide,</L>
<L>Clap the glad Wing and tow'r away,</L>
<L>And mingle with the Blaze of Day.</L>
