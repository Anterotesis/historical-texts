<HEAD>THE GENERAL PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TRadition has in no Instance so clearly evinced her Faith∣fulness, as in the transmitting of vulgar Rites and po∣pular Opinions.</P>
<P>Of these, when we are desirous of tracing them backwards to their Origin, many lose themselves in Antiquity.</P>
<P>They have indeed travelled down to us through a long Succession of Years, and the greatest part of them, it is not improbable, will be of perpetual Observation: for the gene∣rality of Men look back with superstitious Veneration on the Ages of their Forefathers: and Authorities, that are grey with Time, seldom fail of commanding those filial Honours, claimed even by the Appearance of hoary old Age.</P>
<P>Many of these it must be confessed are mutilated, and, as in the Remains of antient Statuary, the Parts of not a few of them have been awkwardly transposed: they preserve, however, the principal <HI>Traits,</HI> that distinguished them in their origin.</P>
<P>Things, composed of such flimsy Materials as the Fancies of a Multitude, do not seem calculated for a long Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion; yet have these survived Shocks, by which even Empires have been overthrown, and preserved at least some <HI>Form</HI> and <HI>Co∣lour</HI> of Identity, during a Repetition of Changes, both in religious Opinions, and in the Polity of States.</P>
<P>But the strongest Proof of their remote Antiquity, is▪ that they have outlived the general Knowledge of the very Causes that gave rise to them.</P>
<P>The Reader will find in the subsequent pages an union of Endeavours to rescue many of these Causes from Oblivion. If, on the Investigation, they appear to any so frivolous as not to have deserved the Pains of the Search, the humble Labourers will avoid Censure, by incurring Contempt.</P>
<P>How trivial soever such an Enquiry may seem to some, yet all must be informed that it is attended with no small share of Difficulty and Toil.</P>
<P>A Passage is to be forced through a Wilderness intricate and entangled: few Vestiges of former Labours can be found
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
to direct us; we must oftentimes trace a tedious retrospective Course, perhaps to return at last weary and unsatisfied, from the making of Researches, fruitless as those of some antient enthusiastic Traveller, who ranging the barren <HI>African</HI> Sands, had in vain attempted to investigate the hidden Sources of the <HI>Nile.</HI></P>
<P>Rugged and narrow as this Walk of Study may seem to many, yet <HI>Fancy</HI> (who shares with <HI>Hope</HI> the pleasing Office of brightening a Passage through every <HI>Route</HI> of human Endeavour) opens from hence too Prospects, enriched with the choicest Beauties of her magic Creation.</P>
<P>The <HI>prime</HI> Origin of the superstitious Notions and Cere∣monies of the People is absolutely unattainable; we despair of ever being able to reach the Fountain Head of Streams which have been running and increasing from the Beginning of Time. All that we aspire to do, is only to trace back∣wards, as far as possible, the Courses of them on those Charts, that remain, of the distant Countries from whence they were first perceived to flow.</P>
<P>Few, who are desirous of investigating the popular No∣tions and vulgar Ceremonies in our Nation, can fail of de∣ducing them in their first Direction from the Times when Popery was our established Religion.</P>
<P>We shall not wonder that these were able to survive the Reformation, when we consider, that though our sensible and spirited Forefathers were, upon Conviction, easily in∣duced to forego religious Tenets, which had been weighed in the Balance, and sound wanting; yet were <HI>the People</HI> by no means inclined to annihilate the seemingly innocent Ceremo∣nies of their former superstitious Faith.</P>
<P>These, consecrated to the Fancies of Men, by a Usage from Time immemorial, though crazed by public Authority from the <HI>written Word,</HI> were committed as a venerable De∣posit to the keeping of <HI>oral Tradition:</HI> like the <HI>Penates</HI> of a∣nother <HI>Troy,</HI> recently destroyed, they were religiously brought off, after having been snatched out of the smoking Ruins of Popery.</P>
<P>It is not improbable that, in the Infancy of Protestantism, the continuance of many of these was connived at by the State. For Men, <Q>who are but Children of a larger
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
Growth,</Q> are not weaned all at once, and the Refor∣mation of Manners, and of Religion, is always most surely established, when effected by slow Degrees, and as it were imperceptible Gradations.</P>
<P>Thus also at the first Promulgation of Christianity to the Gentile Nations, through the Force of Conviction they yielded indeed to Truth; yet they could not be persuaded to relin∣quish many of their Superstitions, which, rather than forego them altogether, they chose to blend and incorporate with their new Faith.</P>
<P>Christian, or rather Papal Rome, borrowed her Rites, Notions, and Ceremonies, in the most luxurious Abundance from an∣cient and Heathen Rome; and much the greater Number of these flaunting Externals, which <HI>Infallibility</HI> has adopted, and used as Feathers to adorn <HI>her Triple-Cap,</HI> have been stolen out of the Wings of the <HI>dying Eagle.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to the Rites, Sports, &amp;c. of the Common People, I am aware that the morose and bigoted Part of Mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I shall quote here the subsequent <HI>curious Thoughts</HI> on this Subject: the Puritans are ridiculed in them.</P>
<Q><L><HI>These</HI> teach that <HI>Dancing</HI> is a Jezabell,</L>
<L>And <HI>Barley-break</HI> the ready Way to Hell:</L>
<L>The <HI>Morrice Idols, Whitsun-ales</HI> can be</L>
<L>But prophane Reliques of a Jubilee:</L>
<L>These in a Zeal t'expresse how much they do</L>
<L>The <HI>Organs</HI> hate, have silenc'd <HI>Bagpipes</HI> too;</L>
<L>And harmless <HI>Maypoles</HI> all are rail'd upon,</L>
<L>As if they were the <HI>Tow'rs</HI> of <HI>Babylon.</HI></L>
<BIBL>Randolph's Poems. 1646.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> without distinguishing between the right Use and the Abuse of such Entertainments, cavil at and malign them. Yet must such be told that Shows and Sports have been countenanced by the best and wisest of States; and though it cannot be denied that they have been sometimes prostituted to the Purposes of Riot and Debauchery, yet were we to reprobate every thing that has been thus abused, <HI>Religion</HI> itself could not be retained; perhaps we should be able to keep nothing.</P>
<P>The Common People, confined by daily Labour, seem to require their proper Intervals of Relaxation; perhaps it is of
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
the highest political Utility to encourage innocent Sports and Games among them. The Revival of many of these, would, I think, be highly pertinent at this particular Season, when the general Spread of Luxury and Dissipation threa∣tens more than at any preceding Period to extinguish the Character of our boasted national Bravery. For the Observa∣tion of an honest old Writer, Stow, (who tells us, speaking of the May-games, Midsummer-Eve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I call to mind here the pleasing Account Mr. Sterne has left us in his Sentimental Journey, of the <HI>Grace-dance</HI> after Supper—I agree with that amiable Writer in thinking that <HI>Religion</HI> may mix herself in the Dance, and that innocent Cheerfulness is no inconsiderable Part of Devotion; such indeed as cannot fail of being grateful to the <HI>Good Being,</HI>—it is a <HI>silent</HI> but <HI>eloquent</HI> Mode of praising him!</NOTE> Rejoicings, &amp;c. an∣tiently used in the Streets of London, <Q>which <HI>open</HI> Pastimes in my Youth being now supprest, worse Practices <HI>within Doors</HI> are to be seared),</Q> may be with singular propriety adopted on the most transient Survey of our present popular Manners.</P>
<P>Mr. Bourne, my Predecessor in this Walk, has not, from whatever Cause, done Justice to the Subject he undertook to treat of. Far from having the Vanity to think that I have exhausted it, the utmost of my Pretensions is to the Merit of having endeavoured, by making Additions, to improve it. I think him, however, deserving of no small Share of Praise for his imperfect Attempt, for "much is due to those, who first broke the Way to Knowledge, and left only to their Successors the Task of smoothing it."</P>
<P>New Lights have arisen since his Time. The English Antique has become a general and fashionable Study; and the Discoveries of the very respectable Society of Antiquaries have rendered the Recesses of Papal and Heathen Antiquities easier of access.</P>
<P>I flatter myself I have turned all these Circumstances in some measure to Advantage. I have gleaned Passages that seemed to throw Light upon the Subject, from a great Va∣riety of Volumes, and those written too in several Lan∣guages; in the doing of which, if I shall not be found to having deserved the Praise of Judgment, I must at least make Pretensions to the Merit of Industry,</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>Elegance of Composition will hardly be expected in a Work of this Kind, which stands much less in need of Attic Wit, than of Roman Perseverance, and <HI>Dutch</HI> Assiduity.</P>
<P>I shall offer some Discoveries, which are peculiarly my own; for there are Customs yet retained here in the North, of which I am persuaded the learned of the Southern Part of the Island have not heard, which is, perhaps, the sole Cause why they have never before been investigated.</P>
<P>In perusing the subsequent Observations, the candid Rea∣der, who has never before considered this neglected Subject, is requested not to be rash in passing Sentence, but to suspend his Judgment, at least, till he has carefully examined all the Evidence; by which Caution I do not wish to have it understood, that our Determinations are thought to be in∣fallible, or that every Decision here is not amenable to an higher Authority. In the mean time Prejudice may be for∣warned, and it will apologize for many seemingly trivial Reasons, assigned for the beginning and transmitting of this or that <HI>Notion</HI> or <HI>Ceremony,</HI> to reflect, that what may appear foolish to the enlightened Understandings of Men in the <HI>Eighteenth</HI> Century, wore a very different Aspect when viewed through the Gloom that prevailed in the <HI>seventh</HI> or <HI>eighth.</HI></P>
<P>I should trespass upon the Patience of my Reader, were I to enumerate all the Books I have consulted on this Oc∣casion; to which, however, I shall take Care in their proper Places to refer: but I own myself under particu∣lar Obligations to <HI>Durand</HI>'s Ritual of Divine Offices; a Work inimical to every Idea of rational Worship, but to the Enquirer into the Origin of our popular Ceremonies, an in∣valuable Magazine of the most interesting Intelligence. I would stile this Performance the great <HI>Ceremonial Law</HI> of the Romanists, in Comparison with which the <HI>Mosaic Code</HI> is <HI>bar∣ren</HI> of Rites and Ceremonies. We stand amazed on perusing it at the enormous Weight of a new Yoke which <HI>Holy Church</HI> fabricating <HI>with her own Hands</HI> has imposed on her servile Devotees.</P>
<P>Yet the Forgers of these Shackles had artfully contrived to make them sit easy, by twisting Flowers around them. Dark as this Picture, drawn by the Pencil of gloomy Super∣stition,
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
appeared upon <HI>the whole,</HI> yet was its deep <HI>Shade</HI> contrasted with pleasing <HI>Lights.</HI></P>
<P>The Calendar was crowded with Red-Letter Days, nomi∣nally indeed consecrated to <HI>Saints;</HI> but which, by the en∣couragement of Idleness ond Dissipation of Manners, gave every kind of countenance to SINNERS.</P>
<P>A Profusion of childish Rites, Pageants and Ceremonies, diverted the Attention of the People from the consideration of their real State, and kept them in humour, if it did not sometimes make them in love with their slavish Modes of Worship,</P>
<P>To the Credit of our sensible and manly Forefathers, they were among the first who felt the Weight of this new and unnecessary Yoke, and had Spirit enough to throw it off.</P>
<P>I have fortunately in my Possession one of those antient Romish Calendars of singular Curiosity, which contains un∣der the immoveable Feasts and Fasts, (I regret much its Silence on the moveable ones) a variety of brief Observations, contributing not a little to the elucidation of many of our popular Customs, and proving them to have been sent over from Rome, with <HI>Bulls, Indulgencies,</HI> and other Baubles, bartered, as it should seem, for our <HI>Peter-pence,</HI> by those who trafficked in spiritual Merchandize from the Continent.</P>
<P>These I shall carefully translate (though in some Places it is extremely difficult to render the very barbarous <HI>Latin,</HI> of which I fear the Critic will think I have transfused the Bar∣barity, Brevity, and Obscurity into my own <HI>English</HI>) and lay before my Reader, who will at once see and acknowledge their Utility.</P>
<P>A learned Performance, by a Doctor Moresin in the Time of James I. and dedicated to that Monarch, is also luckily in my Possession. It is written in Latin, and entitled "The Origin and Increase of Depravity in Religion;" containing a very masterly Parallel between the Rites, Notions, &amp;c. of <HI>Heathen</HI> and those of <HI>Papal</HI> Rome.</P>
<P>The copious Extracts from this Work, with which I shall adorn the subsequent Pages will be their own Eulogy, and supersede my poor Encomiums.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="8"/>When I call to remembrance the <HI>Poet of</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Mr. Grey.</NOTE> <HI>Humanity,</HI> who has transmitted his Name to Immortality, by Reflections writ∣ten among the little Tomb-stones of the Vulgar, in a Country Church-Yard; I am urged by no false Shame to apologize for the seeming Unimportance of my Subject.</P>
<P>The Antiquities of the Common People cannot be studied without acquiring some useful Knowledge of Mankind. By the chemical Process of Philosophy, even Wisdom may be extracted from the Follies and Superstitions of our Forefathers</P>
<P>The <HI>People,</HI> of whom Society is chiefly composed, and for whose good, Superiority of Rank is only a Grant made ori∣ginally by mutual Concession, is a respectable Subject to every one who is the Friend of Man.</P>
<P>Pride, which, independent of the Idea arising from the Necessity of civil Polity, has portioned out the human <HI>Genus</HI> into such a variety of different and subordinate <HI>Species,</HI> must be compelled to own, that the lowest of these derives itself from an Origin, common to it with the highest of the Kind. The beautiful Sentiment of <HI>Terence:</HI>
<Q>"<HI>Homo</HI> sum, <HI>humani</HI> nihil á me alienum puto."</Q>
may be adopted therefore in this Place, to persuade us that nothing can be foreign to our Enquiry, which concerns the smallest of the Vulgar; of those <HI>little ones,</HI> who occupy the lowest Place in the political Arrangement of human Beings.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following Sheets are a few of that vast Number of <HI>Ceremonies</HI> and <HI>Opinions,</HI> which are held by the Common People; such, as they solely or generally observe. For tho' some of them have been of National and others perhaps of universal Observance, yet at present they would have little or no Being, if not ob∣served among the Vulgar.</P>
<P>I would not be thought a Reviver of old Rites and Ceremonies to the Burdening of the People, nor an Abolisher of innocent Customs, which are their Pleasures and Recreations: I aim at nothing, but a Regulation of those which are in Being amongst them, which they themselves are far from thinking burdensome, and aboli∣shing such only as are sinful and wicked.</P>
<P>Some of the Customs they hold, have been originally good, tho' at present they retain little of their primitive Purity; the true Meaning and Design of them, being either lost, or very much in the Dark through Folly and Superstition. To wipe off therefore the Dust they have contracted, to clear them of Superstition, and make known their End and Design, may turn to some Account, and be of Advantage; whereas observing them in the
<PB N="xvii" REF="14"/>
present Way, is not only of no Advantage, but of very great Detriment.</P>
<P>Others they hold, are really sinful, notwithstanding in outward Appearance they seem very harmless, being a Scandal to Religion, and an encouraging of Wicked∣ness. And therefore to aim at abolishing these, will I hope be no Crime, tho' they be the Diversions of the People.</P>
<P>As to the Opinions they hold, they are almost all su∣perstitious, being generally either the Produce of Hea∣thenism; or the Inventions of indolent <HI>Monks,</HI> who having nothing else to do, were the Forgers of many silly and wicked Opinions, to keep the World in Awe and Ignorance. And indeed the ignorant Part of the World, is so still aw'd, that they follow the idle Tradi∣tions of the one, more than the Word of GOD; and have more Dependance upon the lucky Omens of the other than his Providence, more Dread of their un∣lucky ones, than his Wrath and Punishment.</P>
<P>The regulating therefore of these Opinions and Cus∣toms, is what I propos'd by the following Compositions, whatever has been suggested to the contrary: And as to the Menaces of some, and the Censures of others, I neither fear nor regard them. I shall be always ready to own any Mistake, and in what I justly may, to vindicate myself.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Soul-Bell, its Antiquity, the Reason of its Institution, the Benefit and Advantage of it, an Exhortation to the Use of it according to its first Institution.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ceremony of tolling the Bell at the Time of Death, seems to be as ancient as the having of Bells them∣selves; we are told,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bingham</HI>'s Orig. Eccl. Lib. 3.</NOTE> it was about the seventh Century when Bells were first in the Church, and that venerable <HI>Bede</HI> is the first that men∣tions them. If this be true, then it is as true, that the tolling of the Bell was instituted about that Time; for where our Countryman
<PB N="2" REF="20"/>
mentions the Word <HI>Campana,</HI> or Bell, there it also is, that we find a Bell made use of for the Dead:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haec, tunc in dormitorio sororum pausans, exaudivit subito in aere notum campanae sonum, quo ad orationes ex∣citari vel convocari solebant, cum quis eorum de seculo fuisset evocatus. <HI>Bed. Eccl. Hist Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Cap.</HI> 23.</NOTE> For at the Death of the Abbess St. <HI>Hilda,</HI> he tells us that one of the Sisters of a distant Monastery, as she was sleeping, thought she heard the well-known Sound of that Bell, which called them to Prayers, when any of them had departed this Life. But be that as it will, it is evident that the Bell was tolled upon this Occasion about <HI>Bede</HI>'s Time, and consequently that the Ceremony is as an∣cient as his Days.</P>
<P>The Reason why this custom was instituted, was not, as some seem to imagine, for no other End than to acquaint the Neighbourhood, that such a Person was dead; but chiefly, that whoever heard the Noise of the Bell, should put up their Prayers for the Soul: Thus the Father above-mentioned tells us again,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Quod cum illa audisset, suscitavit cunctas sorores &amp; in ecclesiam convocatas, orationibus &amp; psalmis pro anima matris operam dare monuit. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> That she who presided in this Monastery, had no sooner heard this, than she raised all the Sis∣ters, and called them into the Church, where she exhorted them to pray fervently, and sing a <HI>Requiem</HI> for the Soul of their Mother. <HI>Cas∣salion</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="21"/>
also upon this Place of <HI>Bede,</HI> says, <HI>That</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et talis ritus etiam de praesenti servatur in <HI>Anglia,</HI> ut cum quis decessit, statim campana propriae illius Parochiae speciali quodam modo sonat per aliquod temporis spatium.— Quamvis <HI>Angli</HI> negent modo orationes &amp; suffragia defunctis proficua; non aliam tamen in hoc ab illis rationem potui per∣cipere, quam quod talis sonus sit ritus antiquae ecclesiae <HI>An∣glicanae, Cassali</HI> de vet Sac, Christ. Rit. P. 241.</NOTE> <HI>the same Custom is still observed in</HI> England, <HI>that as soon as any hath departed this Life, the Bell belonging to the Parish he liv'd in, was imme∣diately tolled, and for some Time.—And though</HI> (says he) <HI>the</HI> English <HI>now deny, that Prayers are of any Service to the Dead; yet I could meet with no other Account of this Ceremony, than that it was a Custom of the old Church of</HI> Eng∣land.</P>
<P>And for this Reason it is, that this Custom was first observed, and should be still retained among us, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Prayers of the Faith∣ful may be assisting to the Soul; and certainly it might be more profitably retained, were it so ordered, that the Bell should be tolled be∣fore the Person's Departure, as was undoubtedly designed when this Ceremony was continued, that good men might give him their Prayers. Was this always so observed, there might be some <HI>Moses</HI> amongst the Number of the Faith∣ful, whose Prayers could prevail upon God to beat back <HI>the Amalekites of Darkness;</HI> some whose <HI>Faith</HI> might remove a <HI>Mountain of Sins,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="22"/>
and some whose Tears procure a Multitude of Mercies. O the Comfort of <HI>the Forgiveness of Sins!</HI> Of <HI>being guided safely through the Sha∣dow of Death!</HI> Of arriving securely at the heavenly Country! What is it that Prayer can't obtain?</P>
<P>But though the Wickedness and Impeni∣tency of the dying Person be such, as that the Prayers of the Faithful will not be suffi∣cient to avert the Wrath and Punishment of a justly incensed God; yet as this can be only known to God, it will not discharge Men from recommending him to the Divine Mercy, in the most passionate and affectionate Manner. They thereby express the most laudable Zeal, the most disinterested Charity; and whilst they are so solicitous for the Happiness and Welfare of other Men's Souls, they cannot but be thereby influenced to have the greatest Con∣cern for their own, and be both encouraged and directed to proceed with an holy Emula∣tion <HI>from Strength to Strength,</HI> and endeavour as the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 1.</NOTE> Apostle advises, <HI>to go on to Perfection.</HI></P>
<P>But, alas! we are fallen into Times of such Irreligion and Prejudice, such Contempt of An∣tiquity, and such too great Reformation, that what with Indolence on one Hand, and Igno∣rance on the other; what with no Zeal on this
<PB N="5" REF="23"/>
Side, and too<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among the many Objections of the <HI>Brownists,</HI> it is laid to the Charge of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that though we deny the Doctrine of Purgatory, and teach the contrary, yet how well our Practice suits with it, may be considered in our ringing of hal∣lowed Bells for the Soul. Bish. <HI>Hall.</HI> cont. <HI>Brown.</HI></NOTE> false a one on that; we either neglect the most decent Ceremonies of Reli∣gion, or we think it is Religion to have no Ceremonies at all. No Wonder then, that, <HI>in the Midst of such a crooked and perverse Genera∣tion,</HI> when the most of Men are negligent of themselves, they are also negligent of others: No Wonder, that when there is such a ge∣neral Contempt of Religion, and Men are care∣less of their own Souls, they are not careful for the Souls of their Friends.</P>
<P>But it is called<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>In a Vestry-Book belonging to the Chapel of</HI> All-Saints, <HI>in</HI> Newcastle upon Tyne, <HI>it is observable, That the Tolling of the Bell is not mentioned in the Parish Accounts, from the Year</HI> 1643, <HI>till</HI> 1655, <HI>when we find it ordered to be tolled again. At a Vestry holden</HI> January 21st, 1655. Whereas for some Years past, the collecting of the Duty for Bell and Tolling, hath been forborn and laid aside, which hath much lessened the Revenue of the Church, by which, and such-like Means, it is brought into Dilapidations; and having now taken the same into serious Consideration, and fully debated the Ob∣jections made by some against the same, and having had the Judgment of our Ministers concerning any Superstition that might be in it; which being made clear, it is this Day or∣dered, That from henceforth, the Church Officer appointed thereunto, do collect the same, and bring the Money unto the Church-Wardens, and that those who desire to have the Use of the Bells, may freely have them as formerly, paying the accustomed Fees. <HI>It is certain they laid it aside, because they thought it superstitious, and it is probable, if they had not wanted Money, they had not seen the contrary.</HI></NOTE> Popish and Superstitious; for what true Reason, I know not. Did we
<PB N="6" REF="24"/>
indeed imagine with the Papists, that there is any<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We call them Soul-Bells, for that they signifie the Depar∣ture of the Soul, not for that they help the Passage of the Soul. Bish. <HI>Hall</HI> cont. <HI>Brown,</HI> P. <HI>568.</HI></NOTE> Virtue or extraordinary Power in a Bell, that it is<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Item ut Daemones tinnitu campanarum, Christianos ad preces concitantium, terreantur. Formula vero baptizandi seu benedicendi campanas antiqua est. <HI>Durant. Lib. C.</HI> 22. <HI>S.</HI> 6.</NOTE> hallowed by Baptism, and drives away the Spirits of Darkness, then it might justly be called Superstition, and therefore just∣ly abolished. But when we retain the Custom, only to procure the Prayers of the Faithful for a departing Soul, it would surely be of Advan∣tage to observe it, if the <HI>Prayers of a righteous Man avail</HI> any Thing at all; which, if we may believe an inspired Apostle, are of very great Efficacy and Validity.</P>
<P>Art thou then attending a Friend in his last Moments? Art thou careful for his Soul, and solicitous for his Salvation? Dost thou wish him safe <HI>through the Valley of Death to the ever∣lasting Hills?</HI> Wouldst thou have the good An∣gels protect him, and be his <HI>Shield against the Powers of Darkness?</HI> In short, wouldst thou have him crown'd with the Joys of <HI>Paradise?</HI> Be assured then, that the Prayers of good men
<PB N="7" REF="25"/>
will very much contribute to the gaining of these Things. But how shall they then pray for him, if they know not of his Departure? And how can they know that, without the tolling of the Bell? Do thou therefore put in Practice this decent and profitable Custom, not as our Age generally does, after the Death of thy Friend, but before it; before he leave the World, when the Prayers of good Men can assist him, and facilitate his Journey into the other Life.</P>
<P>Or, art thou <HI>working in the Field, or grind∣ing at the Mill?</HI> Remember then, when thou hearest the Sound of the Bell for one depart∣ing, that thou put up thy Prayers for him. Be thy Business what it will, it will always permit thee to say at least, <HI>LORD, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in Peace:</HI> Or to use the Words of St. <HI>Oswald,</HI> when he and his Sol∣diers were ready to be slain, <HI>Lord, have Mercy on the Soul of thy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oravit ad dominum pro animabus exercitus sui. Unde dicunt in proverbio, Deus miserere animabus, dixit <HI>Oswaldus</HI> cadens in terram, <HI>Bed. Eccl. L.</HI> 3. <HI>C.</HI> 12. <HI>It is used</HI> (says <HI>Bede</HI>) <HI>even to a Proverb,</HI> That he died praying; <HI>for when the Enemy had surrounded him, and he saw himself about to be slain, he prayed unto the LORD for the Souls of his Army. Hence it is that the Proverb comes,</HI> LORD, have Mercy upon the Soul, as St. <HI>Oswald</HI> said when he fell to the Earth. <HI>Which Proverb, in all Probability, hath been the Original of this pre∣sent national Saying,</HI>
<Q><L>When the Bell begins to toll,</L>
<L>LORD, have Mercy on the Soul.</L></Q></NOTE> <HI>Servant.</HI> It will not be
<PB N="8" REF="26"/>
long, till thou thyself shalt have Occasion for such Prayers, till thou come to die, and enter on thy Journey to the other State: If then <HI>thou hast been merciful, thou shalt obtain Mercy;</HI> if by thy Prayers thou hast assisted the Souls of thy Brethren, thou shalt either be remem∣bered in the Prayers of good Men, or surely these thy Prayers for others will be of Service to thyself also, at that dreadful hour.</P>
<P>But now it may be objected, That as the Bell is seldom tolled till after the Person's De∣parture, it is to no Purpose to pray for the Soul; nay to pray for it, would be praying for the Dead: And since that is repugnant to the Doctrine of our Church, our Prayers at that Time had much better be omitted.</P>
<P>Indeed it is too true, this Custom is not so common as it should be; but however, it is so much observed, as will be able to vindicate the putting up of constant Prayers. I know several religious Families in this Place, and I hope it is so in other Places too, who always observe it, whenever the melancholy Season offers; and therefore it will at least sometimes happen, when we put up our Prayers constantly at the tolling of the Bell, that we shall pray for a Soul departing. And tho' it be granted, that it will oftener happen otherwise, as the regular Custom is so little followed; yet that can be no harmful praying for the Dead. We
<PB N="9" REF="27"/>
believe that the Soul is but departing, and it is charitably done to offer up our Prayers: And therefore when it proves otherwise, <HI>our</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xxxiv. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Prayer shall turn into our own Bosom;</HI> and like as that Peace, which the Disciples wished to an unworthy House, returned to the Disciples again; so, though our Prayers at that Time may be of no Service to the Soul, yet they will be of no Disservice to us. They will re∣turn to us again, but it will be no Fault to have misplaced them.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author seems of Opinion, that the Ce∣remony of tolling a Bell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The subsequent Etymology of this Word has the Sanction of the learned Sir Henry Spelman: <HI>Bell</HI> is derived from <HI>Pelvis,</HI> a Bason: for before the Invention of Bells, not only <HI>sounding Brass,</HI> but <HI>Basons</HI> also were used instead of them. (Housewives to this Day try the Soundness of their Earthen or China Vases by <HI>ringing</HI> them with a Finger). Vide Lye's Junii Etymolog. in verbo.— Mr Wheatley, in his Illustration of the Liturgy, apologizes for our retaining this Ceremony. <Q>Our Church (says he) in Imita∣tion of the Saints in former Ages, calls in the Minister and others, who are at hand, to assist their Brother in his last Ex∣tremity. In order to this she directs that when any one is <HI>passing</HI> out of this Life, a Bell should be tolled, &amp;c.</Q> It is called from thence the <HI>Passing Bell.</HI></NOTE> at the Time of Death, is as antient as the Use of Bells. This is somewhat improbable. It has rather been an After-Invention of Superstition. Thus praying for the <HI>Dying</HI> was <HI>improved upon</HI> into praying for the <HI>Dead.</HI> Bells must have been first used as Signals to con∣vene the People to their public Devotions.</P>
<P>Mr. Bourne has overlooked a Passage in Du∣rand's Ritual that would have been much to his Purpose<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Verùum aliquo moriente, Campanae debent pulsari: ut Po∣pulus hoc audiens, oret pro illo. Pro <HI>muliere</HI> quidem <HI>bis,</HI> pro eo quòd ipsa invenit Asperitatem. Primo enim fecit hominem alienum à Deo, quare <HI>secunda</HI> dies non habuit Benedictionem.

<P>Durand flourished about the End of the 12th Century.</P>
<P>In Ray's Collection of old English Proverbs I find the following Couplet:
<Q><L>When thou dost hear a Toll, or Knell,</L>
<L>Then think upon <HI>thy</HI> passing Bell.</L></Q></P></NOTE>:— <Q>When any one is dying, says that
<PB N="13" REF="31"/>
Ritualist, Bells must be tolled, that the People may put up their Prayers.—Let this be done <HI>twice</HI> for a <HI>Woman</HI> and <HI>thrice</HI> for a <HI>Man:</HI></Q> (The superstitious Reasons he assigns for these Numbers are too contemptible for Translation) <Q>If for a Clergyman, <HI>as many Times</HI> as he had <HI>Orders,</HI> and at the Conclusion a Peal on <HI>all</HI> the Bells, to distinguish the Quality of the Person for whom the People are to put up their Prayers. A Bell too must be rung while we are conduct∣ing the Corpse to Church, and during the bring∣ing it out of the Church to the Grave.</Q> I think this a curious and pertinent Quotation. It seems to account for a Custom still preserved in the North, of making numeral Distinctions at the Conclusion of this Ceremony—<HI>nine</HI> Knells for a Man, <HI>six</HI> for a Woman, and <HI>three</HI> for a Child, which are without Doubt the Vestiges of this antient Injunction of Popery.</P>
<P>The Quotation our Author gives us from Bede<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have examined this Passage in King Alfred's Saxon Version of Bede: In rendering <HI>Campana,</HI> I find he has used Cluggan, which properly signifies a <HI>Clock (Bellan</HI> is in the Margin). <HI>Clock</HI> is the old German Name for a Bell, and hence the French call one <HI>une Clóche.</HI> There were no Clocks in England in Alfred's Time. He is said to have measured his Time by Wax Candles, marked with circular Lines to distinguish the Hours.—I would infer from this, that our Clocks have certainly been so called from the <HI>Bells</HI> in them.—Mr. Strutt confesses he has not been able to trace the Date of the Invention of Clocks in England.—Stow tells us they were commanded to be set up in Churches in the Year 612. A gross Mistake! and into which our honest Historian must have been led by his misunderstanding the Word <HI>Cloca,</HI> a Latin Term coined from the old German Name for a <HI>Bell.</HI> For <HI>Clocks</HI> therefore read <HI>Bells.</HI></NOTE> is very apposite, as is that from Cassalion's occa∣sional
<PB N="14" REF="32"/>
Comment. The latter however appears to no great Advantage as an Antiquary, when he tells us <Q>he could meet with no other Account of this Ceremony, than that it was a Custom of the old Church of England.</Q> The Passage above cited from Durand would have informed him from whence it must have been imported into this King∣dom.</P>
<P>It may gratify the Curiosity of some to peruse the following general Observations on Bells<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Spelman in his very learned Glossary, verb. <HI>Campana,</HI> has preserved two Monkish Lines, in which all the antient Offices of Bells seem to be included.</P>
<Q><L>Laudo Deum verum, Plebem voco, congrego Clerum,</L>
<L>Defunctos ploro, pestem fugo, Festa decoro.</L></Q>
<P>We praise the true God, call the People, convene the Clergy, Lament the Dead, dispel Pestilence, and grace Festivals.</P></NOTE>.—I have not been able to ascertain precisely the Date of this useful Invention. The Antients had some Sort of Bells. I find the Word <HI>Tintinnabula,</HI> (which we usually render <HI>Bells</HI>) in Martial, Juvenal, and Suetonius. The Romans were summoned by these (of whatever Size or Form they were) to their hot Baths, and to the Business of public Places.</P>
<P>The large Kind of Bells now in Use are said to have been invented by Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, in Campania, (whence the Latin Name <HI>Campana</HI>)
<PB N="15" REF="33"/>
about the Year 400<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spelman's Gloss. verb Campana. Truster's Chronology.</NOTE>, and to have been generally used in Churches about the 600th Year of the Christian Aera. Mr. Bingham<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Antiquities of Christ. Church, Vol. I. p. 316.</NOTE> however thinks this a vulgar Error. In short, we are left much in the Dark concerning the Antiquities of the ear∣lier Ages of the Church.—Ecclesiastical Writers frequently clash in their Accounts.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Josephus.</NOTE> The Jews used Trumpets for Bells: The Turks permit not the Use of Bells: The Greek Church under them still follow their old Custom of using wooden Boards, or Iron Plates full of holes, which they hold in their Hands, and knock with a Hammer or Mallet, to call the People together to Church<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>See Dr. Smith's Account of the Greek Church. He was an Eye-Witness of this remarkable Custom, which Durand tells us is retained in the Romish Church on the three last Days of the Week preceding Easter. Durandi Rational. p. 331. 3.</P>
<P>Bingham informs us of an Invention before Bells for con∣vening religious Assemblies in Monasteries: It was going by Turns to every one's Cell, and with the Knock of a Hammer calling the Monks to Church. The Instrument was called the Night-Signal and the wakening Mallet.—In many of the Colleges at Oxford the Bible Clerk knocks at every Room Door with a Key, to waken the Students in the Morning, before he begins to ring the Chapel Bell.—A Vestige it should seem of the antient monastic Custom.</P></NOTE>: China has been remarkably famous for its Bells— Father le Compte tells us, that at Pekin there are seven Bells, each of which weighs one hundred and twenty thousand Pounds.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of Watching with the Dead.</HEAD>
<P>WATCHING with the Corps was an an∣tient Custom of the Church, and every where practised. They were wont to sit by it, from the Time of its Death till its Expor∣tation to the Grave, either in the House it died in, or in the Church itself. Agreeable to this, we read in St. <HI>Austin,</HI> That as they watched his Mother <HI>Monica,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalterium arripuit <HI>Fuodius,</HI> &amp; cantare caepit psalmum, cui respondebamus omnes domus: Miserecordiam &amp; judicium cantabo tibi Domine. <HI>Aug. Lib</HI> 9. <HI>Confes. C.</HI> 12.</NOTE> <HI>Euodius</HI> took the <HI>Psalter,</HI> and began to sing a <HI>Psalm,</HI> which the whole Family answered with that of the Psalmist <HI>David, I will sing of Mercy and Judg∣ment, unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.</HI> And we are told,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ad ecclesiam antelucana hora qua defunctus est, corpus ipsius portatum est: ibique eadem fuit nocte, quam vigilavi∣mus in pascha. <HI>Greg. Turon. de Gloria, Confes. C.</HI> 104.</NOTE> That at the Death of St. <HI>Am∣brose,</HI> his Body was carried into the Church before Day, the same Hour he died. It was the Night before <HI>Easter,</HI> and they watched with him there.</P>
<P>How unlike to this antient Custom of watch∣ing is the modern one, of locking up the Corps
<PB N="21" REF="39"/>
in a Room, and leaving it there alone? How unlike to this decent Manner of watching, is that watching of the Vulgar, which is a Scene of Sport and Drinking and Lewdness? Watch∣ing at that Time with a dear Friend, is the last Kindness and Respect we can shew him; and how unfriendly is it, to change it into Negligence and too great Resignation? How unchristian, instead of a becoming Sorrow and decent Gravity, to put on an unbecoming Joy and undecent Pastime.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="Brand's commentary">
<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author, for what Reason I know not, has omitted the vulgar Name given here to this <HI>watching with a Corps.</HI> It is called the <HI>Lake∣wake;</HI> a Word plainly derived from the Anglo-Saxon Lic or Lice, <HI>a Corpse,</HI> and Waecce, <HI>a Wake, Vigil,</HI> or <HI>Watching.</HI> It is used in this Sense by Chaucer, in his Knight's Tale:
<Q><L>—Shall not be told for me,</L>
<L>How that Arcite is brent to Ashen cold,</L>
<L>Ne how that there the <HI>Liche-wake</HI> was yhold</L>
<L>All that Night long.</L></Q>
<PB N="22" REF="40"/>
Thus also I read in the Article <HI>Walkin,</HI> in the learned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the late Mr. Ruddiman, as is generally supposed.</NOTE> Glossary to Douglas' Virgil, <Q>Properly <HI>Like-wakes</HI> (Scotch) are the Meetings of the Friends of the Deceased, a Night, or Nights be∣fore the Burial.</Q></P>
<P>I am not satisfied with either of the Quotations he has given us in Proof of the Antiquity of the Custom: They are indeed something to the Pur∣pose; but in the last cited Passage, one would be inclined to think from the Words of the Original, that the <HI>Watching</HI> was on Account of its being the Vigil of Easter-Day.</P>
<P>The subsequent Extract from one of the antient Councils quoted in Durant,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Porro observandum est, nedum Psalmos cani consuetum, cum funus ducitur, sed etiam <HI>nocte, quoe praecedit funus, veteres vigi∣lasse.</HI> nocturnasque vigilias canendis Psalmis egisse.</NOTE> p. 232, is, I think, much more apposite:—<Q>Now it must be observed, that Psalms are wont to be sung not only when the Corps is conducted to Church, but that the Antients <HI>watched on the Night</HI> before the Burial, and spent the Vigil in singing Psalms.</Q> So also <HI>Gregory,</HI> in the Epistle that treats of the Death of his Sister Macrina, has these Words:<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cùm igitur (inquit) <HI>nocturna pervigilatio,</HI> ut in Martyrum ce∣lebritate canendis Psalmis perfecta esset &amp; Crepusculum adve∣nisset, &amp;c. Durant, p. 232.</NOTE> "Now when the <HI>nightly Watching,</HI> as is usual" &amp;c.</P>
<P>I could give numerous Passages from the An∣tients, were there any Doubt of the Antiquity of a Custom, which probably owes its Origin to the tenderest <HI>Affections</HI> of human Nature, and has per∣haps on that Account been used from the Infancy of Time.</P>

<P>The Abuse of this <HI>Vigil,</HI> or <HI>Lake-wake,</HI> is of pretty old standing.—I find the following Account

Here the Synod takes Notice, that the De∣sign of People's meeting together upon such Oc∣casions, was to join their Prayers for the Benefit of the dead Person; that this antient and ser∣viceable Usage was over-grown with Supersti∣tion, and turned into a Convenience for <HI>Theft</HI> and <HI>Debauchery:</HI> Therefore for a Remedy against this Disorder, 'tis decreed, that upon the Death of any Person, none should be allowed to <HI>watch</HI> before the Corps in a private House, excepting near Relations and Friends of the Deceased, and such as offered to repeat a set Number of Psalms for the Benefit of his Soul.</Q> The Penalty an∣nexed is Excommunication.—This is also men∣tioned in Becon's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fol. 253.</NOTE> Reliques of Rome, and com∣prised in the Catalogue of those Crimes that were antiently cursed with <HI>Bell, Book,</HI> and <HI>Candle.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of following the Corps to the Grave, what it is an Emblem of: Of carrying Greens in our Hand, what it signifies, what Use it may be of: Of Psalmody, its Antiquity, the Advan∣tage and Use of it.</HEAD>
<P>IT hath been observed among all Nations, both in the Heathen and the Christian World, as a becoming and profitable Cere∣mony, to follow the Corps to the Grave. The Heathens observed it,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Praecedenti pompa funebri, vivi sequuntur, tanquam handmulto post morituri. <HI>Al. ab. Alex. Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 67. Et <HI>Pol. Vir.

The going of the Corps before, shewed that their Friend was gone before them to the State of Death; and their following after, was as much as to say, that they must also in a short Time follow him thither. For this Reason the Christian also observes the Custom, and may, if he plea∣ses, as he follows the Body to the Grave, en∣tertain himself with a pious Meditation upon it, in such like Thoughts as these of the Psal∣mist,
<PB N="29" REF="47"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xc.</NOTE> <HI>Thou art GOD from Everlasting, and World without End; Thou turnest Man to De∣struction; again, Thou sayest, Come again ye Chil∣dren of Men. For a thousand Years in thy Sight are but as Yesterday, seeing that is past as a Watch in the Night. As soon as thou scatterest them, they are even as a Sleep, and fade away suddenly like the Grass. In the Morning it is green and groweth up, but in the Evening it is cut down, dried up and withered. Do thou therefore, O LORD,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxix.</NOTE> <HI>let me know my End, and the Number of my Days, that I may be certified how long I have to live. Behold thou hast made my Days, as it were a Span long, and mine Age is nothing in respect of Thee; and verily every Man living is altogether Vanity. And now, LORD, what is my Hope? Truly my Hope is even in Thee. Deliver me from all mine Offences, and O spare me a little that I may recover my Strength, before I go hence and be no more seen.</HI> Such Thoughts as these of our Friend's, and of our own Mortality, would excite us to pre∣pare for our own Change.</P>
<P>And as this Form of Procession is an Em∣blem of our dying shortly after our Friend, so the carrying of Ivy, or Laurel, or Rosemary, or some of those Ever-Greens, is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality. It is as much as
<PB N="30" REF="48"/>
to say, That though the Body be dead, yet the Soul is Ever-Green and always in Life: It is not like the Body, and those other Greens which die and revive again at their proper Seasons, no <HI>Autumn</HI> nor <HI>Winter</HI> can make a Change in it, but it is unalterably the same, perpetually in Life, and never dying.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans,</HI> and other Heathens upon this Occasion, made Use of Cypress, which being once cut, will never flourish nor grow any more, as an Emblem of their dying for ever, and being no more in Life. But instead of that, the antient Christians used the Things before mentioned; they<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haedera quoque vel laurus &amp; hujusmodi, quae semper ser∣vant virorem, in sarchophago corpori substernuntur, ad sig∣nificandum quod qui moriuntur in Christo, vivere nec desi∣nunt.

Mort.</HI></NOTE> laid them under the Corps in the Grave, to signify, that they who die in CHRIST, do not cease to live. For though, as to the Body they die to the World, yet, as to their Souls, they live to GOD.</P>
<P>And as the carrying of these Ever-Greens is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality, so it is also of the Resurrection of the Body: For as these Herbs are not entirely pluck'd up, but only cut down, and will, at the returning Season, revive and spring up again; so the Body, like them, is but cut down for a while,
<PB N="31" REF="49"/>
and will rise and shoot up again at the Resur∣rection. For, as the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> says,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. lxiii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Our Bones shall flourish like an Herb.</HI></P>
<P>It was customary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Greg. C. 26.</NOTE> among the antient <HI>Jews,</HI> as they returned from the Grave, to pluck up the Grass two or three Times, and then throw it behind them, saying these Words of the Psalmist, <HI>They shall flourish out of the City like Grass upon the Earth:</HI> Which they did, to shew, that the Body, though dead, should spring up again as the Grass. Thus by these two antient Ceremonies, we have placed before our Eyes, our Mortality and Immortality; the one speaks the Death of the Body, the other the Life of the Soul, nay, and the Life of the Body too; for like that Herb we carry, it is not quite pluck'd up, but shall one Day be alive again. When it hath laid in the Earth the <HI>Winter</HI> Season, the Continuance of this World, and the Warmth and Influence of the <HI>Spring</HI> is come, the joyful Spring of the Re∣surrection, it shall be enliven'd, and shoot up, and eternally flourish.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cor. i. 15.</NOTE> <HI>For this Corruptible must put on Incorruption, and this Mortal must put on Immortality.

<P><PB N="32" REF="50"/>There is another Custom used in some Places, at the Procession of Funerals, which pays a due Honour to the Dead, and gives Comfort and Consolation to the Living; and that is, the carrying out the Dead with Psalmody. This was an antient Custom of the Church; for in some of the earliest Ages, they carried out their Dead to the Grave with singing of Psalms and Hymns.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of Garlands in Country Churches: Of strawing Flowers on the Grave; the Antiquity of these Customs, the Innocency of them.</HEAD>
<P>IN some Country Churches 'tis customary, to hang <HI>a Garland of Flowers</HI> over the Seats of <HI>deceased Virgins,</HI> as a Token of Esteem and Love, and an Emblem of their Reward in the heavenly Church.</P>
<P>This Custom perhaps may be look'd upon, as sprung from that ancient Custom of the Heathens, of <HI>crowning</HI> their <HI>Corps,</HI> with <HI>Gar∣lands</HI> in Token of Victory. But Mr. <HI>Bingham</HI> tells us, That we find not this Custom used by the <HI>Ancients</HI> in their <HI>Funeral Rites.</HI> For as he observes, the Heathen in <HI>Minutius</HI> makes it one Topick of Accusation against them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Min. P.</HI> 35. Coronas etiam sepulchris denegatis. <HI>Bing. Vol.</HI> 10. <HI>P.</HI> 68.</NOTE> That they did not crown their Sepulchres.</P>
<P>But if they did not crown them after the Manner of the Heathens, they had a Custom of using Crowns of Flowers, if we may believe <HI>Cassalion,</HI> who tells us,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Euit quoque mos ad capita virginum apponendi slorum coronas, <HI>&amp;c. Cass. de Vet. Sacr. Christ. P.</HI> 334.</NOTE> It was a Custom of the ancient Christians to place Crowns of
<PB N="40" REF="58"/>
Flowers, at the Heads of deceased Virgins; for which he quotes <HI>Damascen, Gregory Nyssen,</HI> St. <HI>Jerom</HI> and St. <HI>Austin.</HI> And this hath pro∣bably been the Original of this Custom among the Vulgar.</P>
<P>That other Custom of <HI>strawing Flowers</HI> up∣on the <HI>Graves</HI> of their departed Friends, is also derived from a Custom of the ancient Church. For it was usual in those Times for the common Sort of People, to straw the Graves of their Friends with various Flowers. Of this there are two notable Instances taken No∣tice of by <HI>Cassalion,</HI> and several other Ritualists. The one is that of St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> in his <HI>Funeral Oration</HI> on the Death of <HI>Valentinian,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nec ego floribus tumulum ejus asperagam, sed spiritum ejus Christi odore perfundam; spargant alii plenis lilia cala∣this: Nobis lilium est Christus: Hoc reliquias ejus sacrabo. <HI>Ambros Orat. Funebri. ae obitu Valentin.</HI></NOTE> <HI>I will not sprinkle his Grave with Flowers, but pour on his Spirit the Odour of CHRIST.</HI> Let <HI>others scatter Baskets of Flowers: CHRIST is our Lilly, and with this will I consecrate his Relicks.</HI></P>
<P>The other is that of St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> in his E∣pistle to <HI>Pammachius</HI> upon the Death of his Wife.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Caeteri mariti super tumulos conjugum spargunt violas, rosas, lilia, floresque purpureos, &amp; dolorem pectoris his osfi∣ciis consolantur; <HI>Pammachius</HI> noster sanctum favillam ossaque veneranda eleemosynae balsamis rigat. <HI>Hieron. Epist. ad Pam∣machtum de obitu Uxoris.</HI></NOTE> Whilst other Husbands strawed Vio∣lets,
<PB N="41" REF="59"/>
and Roses, and Lillies, and purple Flow∣ers, upon the Graves of their Wives, and com∣forted themselves with such like Offices, <HI>Pam∣machius</HI> bedew'd her Ashes and venerable Bones with the Balsam of Alms.</P>
<P>Now these Instances, tho' they justly com∣mend these other Actions, and wisely prefer them to the Ceremonies of adorning Graves with Flowers, yet they no Way decry these ancient Customs. These lower Marks of Es∣teem and Honour, which the <HI>Vulgar</HI> paid to the Remains of their Friends, were in them∣selves harmless and innocent, and had no Censure; and as they were so, so should the present Customs be without any, being full as harmless and innocent as the other.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>I Have seen many of the <HI>Garlands</HI> our Author here speaks of, in Village Churches in the South of England: The Custom seems to be en∣tirely laid aside in the North<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not <HI>entirely:</HI>—I saw lately, in the Churches of <HI>Wolsingham</HI> and <HI>Stanhope,</HI> in the County of <HI>Durham</HI> Specimens of these Gar∣lands.

<PB N="42" REF="60"/>
of very high Antiquity.—In the earlier Ages of the Church, <HI>Virginity</HI> (out of Deference, it should seem, to the <HI>Virgin Mother</HI>) was honoured with almost <HI>divine</HI> Adoration. There is little Doubt but that <HI>Nunneries</HI> and this <HI>Garlana</HI> claim one common Origin.</P>
<P>Durant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Condito et curato funere solebant Nonnulli antiquitus tumu∣lum floribus adspergere. Durant. p. 237.</NOTE> tells us, the antient Christians, af∣ter the Funeral, used to scatter <HI>Flowers</HI> on the Tomb.—There is a great Deal of Learning in Moresin<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Sepulchra funeralibus expletis quandoque <HI>storibus,</HI> odoramen∣tisque fuisse sparsa legimus.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of Bowing towards the Altar at the first coming into the Church; a Custom generally observed by ignorant People; its Meaning and Antiquity.</HEAD>
<P>WE may observe the Generality of old People among the Commonalty, as they enter into the Church, to turn their Faces to∣wards the <HI>Altar,</HI> and bow or kneel that Way. This, no Doubt, is the Remains of that an∣cient Custom of the Church, of worshipping toward the East: For in the ancient Church they worshipped that Way upon several Ac∣counts. <HI>First,</HI> That by so worshipping, they might lift up their Minds to GOD, who is called the Light and the Creator of Light. And therefore St. <HI>Austin</HI> says,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cum ad orationem stamus, ad orientem covertimur, unde caelum surgit, &amp;c. Ut admoneatur animus ad naturam excellentiorem se convertere, id est, ad Dominum. <HI>Aug. de Serm. Domini. in Mont. Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> When we pray standing, we turn our Faces to the East, from whence the Day springs, that we might be reminded of turning to a more excellent Na∣ture, namely, The LORD. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That for as much as Man was driven out of <HI>Para∣dise,</HI> which is towards the East, he ought to look that Way, which is an Emblem of his
<PB N="45" REF="63"/>
Desire to return thither. St. <HI>Damascen</HI> there∣fore tells us, That<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> because the Scripture says, That GOD planted <HI>Paradise</HI> in <HI>Eden</HI> to∣wards the East, where he <HI>placed the Man which he had formed,</HI> whom he punish'd with Banish∣ment upon his Transgression, and made him dwell over against <HI>Paradise,</HI> in the western Part; we therefore pray, (says he) being in Quest of our ancient Country; and as it were <HI>panting</HI> after it, do worship GOD that Way. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> It was used when any were baptized. They first turn'd their Faces to the West, and so renounc'd the Devil; and then to the East, and made their Covenant with CHRIST. <HI>Last∣ly,</HI> They prayed that Way, believing that our SAVIOUR would come to Judgment from that Quarter of the Heavens. <HI>For as the Lightning cometh out of the East, and shineth unto the West, so shall the Coming of the Son of Man be; and he is to come in like Manner as he ascended.</HI> And that he ascended up Eastward from Mount <HI>Oli∣vet,</HI> St.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>Damascen</HI> assures us. For (says he) when he ascended into Heaven, he was taken up Eastward, and his Disciples worshipped him that Way. And therefore chiefly it was, that in the ancient Church they prayed with their Faces to the East; and that many of our own Church at this Day, turn their
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>St.</HI> Damasc. Lib. <HI>4.</HI> C. <HI>13.</HI> Orthod. Fid.</NOTE>
<PB N="46" REF="64"/>
Faces to that Quarter of the World, at the Repetition of the Creed.</P>
<P>What may more confirm this, and speak it to have been the universal Opinion of the Church, is the ancient Custom of burying the Corps, with the Feet to the East, and the Head to the West; which Custom is continued to this Day in the whole Church of <HI>England:</HI> This was observed for the same Reason, That, at the Coming of CHRIST to Judgment from the oriental Part of Heaven, our Bodies might be found in a praying Posture, with their Faces towards the East.</P>
<P>Our learned Countryman <HI>Gregory</HI> tells us, <Q>That the holy Men of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> hold a Tra∣dition generally received from their Ancients, that our SAVIOUR himself was buried with his Face and Feet towards the East.</Q> It is affirmed by the Geographers of the holy Land. And <HI>Bede</HI> says,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introcuntes ab oriente in domum illam rotundam quae in petra excisa est, viderunt angelum sedentem ad meridianam partem loci illius, ubi positum fuerat corpus Jesu; hoc enim erat in dextris, quod nimirum, corpus, quod supinum jacens caput habebat ad occasum, dexteram necesse est habere ad austrum. <HI>Bed. in Dic.

<PB N="47" REF="65"/>
that is, at his Right Hand; for undoubtedly his Body having his Face upwards and its Head to the West, must have its Right Hand to the South. <HI>Cassalion</HI> says,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adeo tenaces fuere prisci illi fideles in hoc ritu respici∣endi in orientem, ut non solum ipsi viventes, hoc in eorum precibus exacte servarent, verum etiam mortui eorum corpora supina in sepulchris facie orientem respicerent. <HI>Cass. de Vet.

P.</HI> 30.</NOTE> The Faithful of old were so observing of this Ceremony of looking towards the East, that they not only strictly observed it in their Prayers when liv∣ing; but even when they were dead, their Bodies were placed with their Faces upwards in the Sepulchre, looking towards the East.</P>
<P>The learned Dr. <HI>Comber,</HI> in his Discourse of the solemn Interment, hath these Words upon this subject, <Q>We may note the Positure and Position of the Corps, which among the Chri∣stians hath always been to turn the Feet to the East, with the Head to the West; that so they may be ready to meet the LORD, whom the Ancients did believe should ap∣pear in the oriental Part of Heaven. <HI>Durand. Rat. Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>Cap.</HI> 33. Or as our ingenious Mr <HI>Gregory</HI> believes, That they might be in the Posture of Prayer, with their Faces to the East, as soon as they were raised. There are some ancient Authors tell us, That the old Inhabitants of <HI>Attica</HI> buried thus before
<PB N="48" REF="66"/>
the Days of <HI>Solon,</HI> who, as they report, con∣vinced the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that the Island of <HI>Sa∣lamis</HI> did of Right belong to them, by shew∣ing them dead Bodies looking that Way, and Sepulchres turned towards the East, as they used to bury. <HI>Diog. Laert. Vit. Solon,</HI> &amp;c. And the Scholiast upon <HI>Thucidides</HI> says, It was the Manner of all the <HI>Greeks</HI> to bury their Dead thus: Though a learned modern Writer supposes these Authors mistaken, and cites <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Elian</HI> to prove, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> turned their Dead towards the West. However it is certain, that all Na∣tions had one certain Way of placing the Corps, from which they would not vary; and we Christians have so great Antiquity for our Custom, that we ought not out of Singularity to alter it.</Q></P>
<P>No Doubt but this learned Man had great Reason for this Conclusion, as well knowing that this ancient Rite was struck at by the whole Herd of Sectaries, as a filly Fancy and an idle Dream: Who never would observe it, were it not that they are sometimes obliged; but would with those who are not obliged, act the very Reverse, and bury North and South. I wish there were no powerfuller Enemies to it, than them now a Days; but, <HI>as a Man's Enemies are too often those of his own Houshold;</HI> so, 'tis to be lamented, that some who pre∣tend
<PB N="49" REF="67"/>
to be of our own Church, are upon all Occasions secret Advocates against this Cere∣mony. When therefore there is such Oppo∣sition without, and such Treachery within, 'tis high Time to be on the Guard against our Enemies; least a Ceremony so venerable for its Antiquity, and so useful in its Observation, be laid aside: Was it but for this one Thing, that it speaks the Hope of the whole Christian Church, since the earliest Times of Christianity, about the Resurrection of the same Body. It is too true, that there are some at this Time of the Day, as well as were in the Days of the Apostle, who think <HI>it a Thing incredible that GOD should raise the Dead;</HI> some really dis∣believing the Resurrection of any Body, and others that of the same Body. But as long as this Ceremony is in Being, it will always be a ready Proof, that the whole Christian Church did not only believe the Resurrection of the Body, but of that very Body which was laid down in the Grave. For they observed it, that they might be ready with their Faces to meet their SAVIOUR at his coming to Judgment, which certainly implies that they believed that very Body should rise again.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Time of Cock-crow: Whether evil Spirits wander about in the Time of Night; and whe∣ther they fly away at the Time of Cock-crow. Reflections upon this, encouraging us to have Faith and Trust in God.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a received Tradition among the Vul∣gar, That at the Time of Cock-crowing, the Midnight Spirits forsake these lower Re∣gions, and go to their proper Places. They wander, say they, about the World, from the dead Hour of Night, when all Things are bu∣ried in Sleep and Darkness, till the Time of Cock-crowing, and then they depart. Hence it is, that in Country-Places, where the Way of Life requires more early Labour, they al∣ways go chearfully to Work at that Time; whereas if they are called abroad sooner, they are apt to imagine every Thing they see or hear, to be a wandring Ghost. <HI>Shakespear</HI> hath given us an excellent Account of this vulgar Notion, in his Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet.</HI></P>

<L>It faded at the Crowing of the Cock.</L>
<L>Some say that e'er against that Season comes,</L>
<L>Wherein our Saviour's Birth is celebrated,</L>
<L>The Bird of Dawning singeth all Night long.</L>
<L>And then, they say, No Spirit doth walk abroad,</L>
<L>The Nights are wholsome, then no Planet strikes,</L>
<L>No Fairy takes, no Witch hath Power to harm,</L>
<L>So gracious and so hallowed is that Time.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Now to shew what Truth there is in this vulgar Opinion, I shall consider, <HI>First,</HI> What Truth there is in the Roaming of Spirits in the Night. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether they are ob∣liged to go away at Cock-crow.</P>
<P>I believe none who assent to the Truth of Divine Revelation, deny that there are good and evil Angels attending upon Men; the one to guard and protect them, and the other to harm and work their Ruin; that the one are those<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. i. 14.</NOTE> <HI>ministring Spirits, which are sent out to minister to the Heirs of Salvation;</HI> the other the <HI>roaring Lion,</HI> and his Instruments,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job. ii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>who wander too and fro in the Earth; these</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 43.</NOTE> <HI>un∣clean Spirits who wander through dry Places, seeking Rest and finding none.</HI></P>
<P>NOR, I believe, will it be question'd, that there have been Apparitions of good and evil Spirits, and that many, with our SAVIOUR'S
<PB N="56" REF="74"/>
Disciples, have been <HI>affrighted and cried out,</HI> not only with supposing they had seen, but really with seeing a Spirit. Of this the Testi∣mony of all Ages, and Scripture it self are a sufficient Demonstration.</P>
<P>What then could these have ordinarily been, but the Appearances of some of those <HI>Angels</HI> of <HI>Light,</HI> or Darkness? For I am far from thinking that either the Ghosts of the Damn'd or the Happy, either the Soul of a <HI>Dives</HI> or a <HI>Lazarus,</HI> returns here any more. For as <HI>St. Athanasius</HI> observes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hai en tois naois, <HI>&amp;c. Athan.</HI> Tom. 2. P. 34.</NOTE> <HI>These Visions and Shades of the Saints, which appear in the Temples and at the Tombs, are not the Souls of the Saints themselves, but the good Angels appearing in their Shapes.</HI> Not that GOD could not remand the Ghost of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and order it again to visit the Earth, as he made <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> to ap∣pear at our SAVIOUR'S Transfiguration; but that a Thing of this Nature was very uncom∣mon, and seldom happen'd.</P>
<P>Taking it therefore for granted, that there have been Apparitions of Angels, I believe it will also be owned, that these Apparitions have frequently happen'd in the Night. And truly, was there no direct Proof of this, yet the No∣tion of their appearing in the Night, being as it were link'd and chained to our Idea of an
<PB N="57" REF="75"/>
Apparition, would almost perswade us, that the Night is the most proper Time for such Appearances. Whether it is, that the Fables of Nurses,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lock,</HI> on Human Underst.</NOTE> as an ingenious Author imagines, <Q>have so associated the Idea of Spirit to the Night, that the one never appears with∣out the other;</Q> or whether there is some∣thing in the Presence of Night, some Awful∣ness and Horrour, which naturally dispose the Mind of Man to these Reflections. I am indeed very inclinable to believe, that these Legendary Stories of Nurses and old Women, are the Occasion of much greater Fears, than People without them, would generally have of these Things; but I cannot help thinking, that the Presence of Night, would naturally lead a Man to some Reflection of Spirits, without any such Cause as that learned Author men∣tions. There are some particular Times, which will naturally raise some particular Thoughts: Thus on a bright sunny Day we are naturally disposed to Mirth and Gaiety; when the Day over-casts, or the Weather is hazy, we then turn indolent and dull, and sooth our selves in Melancholly; if it Thunder and Lighten, we think of the Day of Judgment and sudden Death: And thus also the Night, as it inclines us to grave and serious Thoughts, raises in us
<PB N="58" REF="76"/>
Horrour and Dismay, and makes us afraid, even when our Judgment tells us there is no Fear; so it may of it self be look'd upon as a natural Cause of such Reflections.</P>
<P>But however this be, we must necessarily own, that Spirits have frequently appeared in the Night, or we must give the Lye to the Traditions of all Ages, to Historians prophane and sacred, and the wisest and best in the Ge∣nerations of Men.</P>
<P>In the Heathen World there are many In∣stances, of which I shall only mention this one out of <HI>Plutarch:</HI> <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Vit. Mar. <HI>Brut.</HI> Trans. Duke.</NOTE> One Night, before <HI>Brutus</HI> passed out of <HI>Asia,</HI> he was very late all alone in his Tent, with a dim Light burning by him, all the Rest of the Army being husht and silent; and musing with himself, and very thoughtful, as he turn'd his Eye to the Door, he saw a strange and terrible Appear∣ance, of a prodigious and frightful Body coming towards him without speaking. <HI>Bru∣tus</HI> boldly asked him, What art thou? Man, or God? Or upon what Business do'st thou come to us? The Spirit answer'd, I am thy <HI>Evil Genius,</HI> thou shalt see me at <HI>Philippi;</HI> to which <HI>Brutus</HI> not at all disturbed, re∣ply'd, Then I will see thee there.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="77"/>In the sacred Writings we have <HI>Job</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job.</NOTE> <HI>terri∣fied with Visions of the Night,</HI> when deep Sleep falleth upon Men, Fear came upon him and Trembling, which made all his Bones to shake; then a Spirit passed by before his Face, and the Hair of his Flesh stood up. In the Night<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxii.</NOTE> <HI>Jacob</HI> wrestled with the Angel; in the Night an Angel delivered<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Acts xii.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> out of Prison, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But though it be true from Scripture, that there have been nightly Apparitions, yet these are chiefly of good Angels; whereas this Opi∣nion principally means, the Appearances of evil Spirits. It must be owned indeed, that the Appearances of evil Spirits, if litterally, are yet but very seldom mention'd in the Night in Scripture; but however, that they wander and appear at Night, is very deducible from, if not litterally mentioned in it. Their's <HI>is the Land of Darkness, and the Shadow of Death; They are reserved under Chains of Darkness to the Judgment of the great Day; and we know that every one that doth Evil naturally hateth the Light: They therefore love Darkness rather than Light, because their Deeds are Evil.</HI> The Night therefore, in a more especial Manner, seems to be their <HI>Hour,</HI> and the <HI>Power of Darkness.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Opinion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as may be learned from the Fear of the Apostles, when
<PB N="60" REF="78"/>
they saw our Saviour about the fourth Watch of the Night, coming to them upon the Wa∣ters:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xiv. 25.</NOTE> <HI>they were affrighted and cryed out, sup∣posing they had seen a Spirit.</HI> Doctor <HI>Whitby</HI> upon this Place, says, <Q>That the <HI>Jews</HI> had then an Opinion of hurtful Spirits walking in the Night, is evident from the seventy, who render'd,</Q> <HI>from the Pestilence walking in Darkness;</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Apo pragmatos diaporeuomenou en skotei.</NOTE> <HI>From</HI> the Fear of the Devils that walk in the Night.</P>
<P>And that this was also the Opinion of the ancient Christians, is evident, not only from their dividing the Night into four Watches, the Evening, Midnight, Cock-crowing, and the Morning; which were the Military Divi∣sions of the Night, and which they<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Si quidem &amp; in Nocte Stationes, &amp; Vigiliae Militares in quatuor partes divisae ternis horarum spatiis secernuntur. <HI>Isidore,</HI> Lib. 1. de Eccle.

Cap. 23.</NOTE> the Rage of the Midnight
<PB N="61" REF="79"/>
Spirits was so great, that but few, and these too Men of Age and unshaken Resolution, were able to endure the Life in the Desart. For such was their Fierceness, that where Eight or Ten had been together in a Monastery, they would have made frequent and visible Incur∣sions: Insomuch, that they never all slept at the same Time, but took it by Turns; some watching the Rest, and exercising themselves in singing Psalms, in Praying and Reading. And St. <HI>Athanasius</HI> in his Life of <HI>Anthony</HI> the Hermit, tells, Of many Conflicts that good Man had in the Night with the Powers of Darkness, whilst they endeavoured to batter him <HI>from the strong Holds</HI> of his Faith. And what can our Church chiefly mean in the <HI>Col∣lect for Aid against Perils;</HI> but that GOD would send us Protection from all the Spirits of Dark∣ness, these Midnight Wanderers of the World: And for this Reason, every good Man, when he lies down to sleep at Night, desires the great <HI>Keeper of</HI> Israel, <HI>who never slumbereth nor sleep∣eth, to send his holy Angels to pitch their Tents round about him,</HI> and banish from him the Spi∣rits of the Night.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="80"/>So far then this Tradition is just and good, that there are at Midnight Spirits who wander about the World, going <HI>too and fro in the Earth, seeking whom they may devour.</HI> Let us now in the next Place enquire, what Truth there is in the other Part of it; namely, That they al∣ways fly away at Cock-crow.</P>
<P>This Opinion, whatever Truth there may be in it, is certainly very ancient. We have it mentioned by the Christian Poet <HI>Prudentius,</HI> who flourished in the Beginning of the fourth Century, as a Tradition of Common Belief: His Words are these,
<Q><LG>
<L>Ferunt Vagantes Daemones</L>
<L>Loetos Tenebris Noctium,</L>
<L>Gallo canente exterritos,</L>

<L>Hoc esse signum proescii</L>
<L>Norunt repromissoe spei,</L>
<L>Qua Nos soporis Liberi</L>
<L>Speramus adventum Dei.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They say the wandering Powers, that love</L>
<L>The silent Darkness of the Night,</L>
<L>At Cock-crowing give o'er to rove,</L>
<L>And all in Fear do take their Flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="63" REF="81"/>
<L>The approaching salutary Morn,</L>
<L>The Approach divine of hated Day,</L>
<L>Makes Darkness to its Place return,</L>
<L>And drives the Midnight Ghosts away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They know that this an Emblem is,</L>
<L>Of what preceeds our lasting Bliss,</L>
<L>That Morn, when Graves give up their Dead,</L>
<L>In certain Hope to meet their GOD.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><HI>Cassian</HI> also, who lived in the same Century, giving an Account of a Multitude of Devils, who had been Abroad in the Night, says,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aurora itaque superveniente, cum omnis haec ab oculis evanisset Daemonum multitudo. <HI>Cass.</HI> Coll. 8. C. 16.</NOTE> That as soon as the Morn approached, they all vanished and fled away. By this we see, that this was a current Opinion at this Time of Day; but what Reason they had for it, ex∣cept some Relations of the disappearing of Evil Spirits at that Hour, I never yet have met with: But there have been produc'd at that Time of Night, Things of very memora∣ble Worth, which might perhaps raise the pious Credulity of some Men to imagine, that there was something more in it, than in other Times. It was about the Time of Cock-crow∣ing when our Saviour was born, and the An∣gels sung the first Christmas-Carol to the poor Shepherds, in the Fields of <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> Now
<PB N="64" REF="82"/>
it may be presum'd, that as the Saviour of the World was then born, and the <HI>heavenly Host</HI> had then descended to proclaim the News, that the Angels of Darkness would be terrified and confounded, and immediately fly away: And perhaps this Consideration has partly been the Foundation of this Opinion; for as this may easily be supposed, so perhaps it has been ima∣gin'd, that the Spirits of Darkness, having al∣ways in Memory that fatal Hour, are startled and frighted away as the Cock proclaims it.</P>
<P>It was also about this Time when he rose from the Dead. And when the great <HI>Sun of Righteousness</HI> was risen upon the World, no Wonder that all the Clouds of Darkness and Wickedness were dispell'd; no Wonder that the conquer'd Powers of Hell were not able to shew their Heads: And this perhaps hath been another Reason of their imagining that Spi∣rits go away at that Time.</P>
<P>A third Reason is, that Passage in the Book of <HI>Genesis,</HI> where Jacob <HI>wrestled with the Angel for a Blessing;</HI> where the Angel says unto him,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxii.</NOTE> <HI>Let me go, for the Day breaketh.</HI></P>
<P>But indeed this Tradition seems more espe∣cially to have risen from some particular Cir∣cumstances attending the Time of Cock-crow∣ing; and which, as <HI>Prudentius</HI> seems to say
<PB N="65" REF="83"/>
above, are an Emblem of the Approach of the Day of the Resurrection. For when we leave the World, we lie down in our Graves, and <HI>Rest from our Labours:</HI> Sleep and Darkness lay hold upon us, and there we abide till the last Day appear, when the Voice of the Arch-Angel shall awake us, that we may meet the LORD of Light and Day. And when we leave the common Business and Care of Life, we lie down in our Beds, as in a Grave, buried as it were in Sleep and Darkness, till the Cock crow, the welcome Messenger of the News of Day.</P>
<P>The Circumstances therefore of the Time of Cock-crowing, being so natural a Figure and Representation of the Morning of the Resur∣rection; the Night so shadowing out the Night of the Grave; the third Watch, being as some suppose, the Time our Saviour will come to Judgment at; the Noise of the <HI>Cock</HI> awaken∣ing sleepy Man, and telling him as it were, <HI>the Night is far spent, the Day is at Hand;</HI> re∣presenting so naturally the Voice of the Arch-Angel awakening the Dead, and calling up the Righteous to everlasting Day; so natural∣ly does the Time of Cock-crowing shadow out these Things, that probably some good well-meaning Men, have been brought to believe, that the very Devils themselves, when the Cock crew, and reminded them of them, did fear and tremble, and shun the Light.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="84"/>Now in Answer to the first of these Conjec∣tures: 'Tis very likely the Evil Spirits did fly away in the Morning of the Nativity, and because of our Saviour's Birth and that <HI>Com∣pany of the heavenly Host,</HI> might be afraid and retire into thick Darkness; yet it will not hence follow, that it always happens so at the Time of Cock-crowing: For if they did fly away that Morning, the Circumstances of our Saviour's Birth, the heavenly Glory of the Angelick Quire, their Musick and their Pre∣sence were the Occasion of it: And why only the bare Remembrance of what happened at that Time, should always at the Time of Cock-crowing drive them away, rather than when they remember it at another, no Reason seems to be given.</P>
<P>As to the second Conjecture, namely, That it was the Time of our Saviour's Rising from the Dead, I answer in the same Manner, That tho' it be allowed, that the Evil Spirits might have returned to the Land of Darkness, upon our Saviour's Rising from the Dead; yet why it should occasion them always to do so at that Time, no Reason can be given.</P>
<P>As to the third Conjecture, it is easy to observe, That this was a good Angel, where∣as they that shun the Light, are bad ones: This was the Angel of the Covenant, the Cre∣ator of Light, and the Lord of the Day: We
<PB N="67" REF="85"/>
may therefore as well imagine, that it was not in his Power, to get out of the Arms of <HI>Jacob,</HI> without saying, <HI>Let me go;</HI> as to suppose he was obliged to go, because he said <HI>the Day breaketh.</HI> The meaning of which Words, <Q>According to <HI>Willet,</HI> is not that the Angel was gone to the blessed Company of the Angels, to sing their Morning Hymn to GOD, as the <HI>Hebrews</HI> imagine: For the Angels, not only in the Morning, but at other Times, are exercised in praising GOD. But the Angel thus speaketh according to the Custom of Men, having now taken the Form and Shape of a Man, as tho' he had hast to other Business, and leaving <HI>Jacob</HI> also to his Affairs.</Q></P>
<P>The last Conjecture of the Rise of this Tra∣dition, seems to carry greater Probability than the others: For as these Things are a Repre∣sentation of the Circumstances of the Morning of the Resurrection, so they must sure enough bring that last Day into Remembrance; and they never can do so, but as surely they must create Terrour and Confusion in all the Devils and Ghosts of the Night: Whilst they assure them they shall never any more enjoy the Realms of Bliss, but be hurried into that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxv. 41.</NOTE> <HI>e∣verlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his
<PB N="68" REF="86"/>
Angels.</HI> But that these Things are the Occa∣sion of their flying away at the Approach of Day, is not to be supposed. On the contrary, the Devil and his Angels ramble o'er the World in Day-light, and are Mid-day Devils, as well as Mid-night ones: For the Devil is incessant in his Temptations, and therefore he is abroad in the Day as well as the Night, tho' perhaps has seldom appear'd but in Darkness. Thus St. <HI>Austin,</HI> in one of his Meditations,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et ideo Deus meus ad te clamamus, libera nos ab ad∣versario nostro quotidiano, qui sive dormiamus, sive vigile∣mus,—die ac nocte fraudibus &amp; artibus, nunc palam nunc occulte sagittas venenatas contra nos dirigens, ut interficiat animas nostras. <HI>Aug. Sol. Cap.</HI> 16.</NOTE> We implore thee, O GOD! that thou wouldest deliver us from our daily Enemy, who by his Wiles and Cunning is always watching us, Day and Night, sleeping and waking; and both openly and in secret, shooting at us his poisoned Arrows, that he may destroy our Souls.</P>
<P>And now, what, though this be true, as it most certainly seems to be so, that at the chearful Hour of Cock-crowing, the wander∣ing Ghosts are not driven away, but still continue going too and fro? What, tho' then their Power be still the same, and their Inten∣tions as fully bent to do Evil? Consider but that GOD'S Care and Providence govern the World, and there will be found as much Safe∣ty for us, in the Midst of Evil Spirits, as if
<PB N="69" REF="87"/>
they absented at that Time. The Almighty Power of GOD, is the same then, as at other Times; nothing but that, preserved us conti∣nually, and that, will always be able to pre∣serve us. However great may be the Malice of Devils; however desirous of working our Ruin; tho' they watch all Opportunities, and are unwearied in tempting us; <HI>yet the loving Kindness of the LORD endureth for Ever, and his Mercy is over all his Works: He will not suffer our Foot to be moved; he that keepeth us will not sleep: We shall not be afraid of the Sun by Day, nor the Moon by Night: For the Pesti∣lence that walketh in Darkness, nor for the Sick∣ness that destroyeth in the Noon-day.</HI></P>
<P>Are we then afraid of Darkness and the Pre∣sence of Night? Let us remember the Creator of them, and have but Faith in him, and we shall find <HI>our Night turned into Day. In his Light shall we see Light:</HI> We shall be as se∣cure as if there was no Darkness about us, as well knowing that that GOD which protects us, sees through the thickest <HI>Mediums,</HI> and the darkest Night: <HI>For with him the Darkness is no Darkness, but the Night is as clear as the Day; the Darkness and Light to him are both alike.</HI> Or are we afraid of that old Serpent the Devil, that nightly Rambler of the World, who is a Lover of Night and Darkness? Let us trust in GOD, and no Harm shall happen
<PB N="70" REF="88"/>
to us. If we will but <HI>fear no Evil, his Rod and his Staff shall comfort us, though we walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death: For GOD hath reserved the Devil and his Angels in everlasting Chains, under Darkness, unto the Judgment of the great Day.</HI> Though therefore he is permitted to wander the World, yet he is so chain'd up, that without GOD'S parti∣cular Order or Permission, he is not allowed to touch the Sons of Men; and he is so re∣served and kept in Darkness, that it is not in his Power even barely to appear and be visible to them, without the Permission of GOD: So little Reason hath every good Man to fear the Spight and Malice of all the Devils in Hell.</P>
<P>When then the Night pours out her Ter∣rours, covers all Things with Darkness, and strikes thee with Horrour; <HI>Lift but up thy Eyes to the Hills, from whence cometh thy Help,</HI> and thou shalt clearly see, that our <HI>Lord GOD is a Light and Defence to thee.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">— Quia filiis lucis &amp; in noctibus dies est.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of Church-yards; why the Vulgar are generally afraid of passing through them at Night: The Original of this Fear: That there is nothing in them now, more than in other Places to be afraid of.</HEAD>
<P>THE most of ignorant People are afraid of going through a <HI>Church-Yard</HI> at Night-time. If they are obliged upon some hasty and urgent Affair, they fear and trem∣ble, till they are beyond its Bounds, but they generally avoid it, and go further about. It would, no Question, be better if there were fewer <HI>Path-ways</HI> through Church-Yards than there are, both as it would prevent several <HI>Abuses</HI> committed in them, and also cause the Ashes of the Dead to be in greater Quiet, and more undisturbed Peace: We should not then see Church-Yards changed into common Dung-hills, nor should we tread so frequently upon the Bones of our Friends: But when for the Conveniency of Neighbourhood, or other Rea∣sons, there are allowed public Ways, it is a very great Weakness to be afraid of passing through them.</P>
<P>The Reason of this Fear is, a Notion they have imbib'd, that in <HI>Church-Yards</HI> there is a frequent walking of Spirits at the <HI>Dead-time</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="95"/>
of Night. Indeed there is at that Time some∣thing awful and horrible every where, and it must be confess'd something more solemn in a <HI>Church-Yard,</HI> than in the Generality of other Places; but that it is then more frequented with <HI>Apparitions and Ghosts</HI> than other Places are, is at this Time of Day intirely ground∣less, and without any Reason.</P>
<P>The Original of this Timorousness may be deduc'd from the Heathens: For they believ∣ed that the <HI>departed Ghosts</HI> came out of their <HI>Tombs</HI> and <HI>Sepulchres,</HI> and wander'd about the Place where the Body lay buried. Thus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Maerin saepe animas imis excire sepulchris,</L>
<L>—<HI>Vidi—Bucol.</HI> 8. <HI>Virg.</HI></L></Q></NOTE>
<HI>Virgil</HI> tells us, That <HI>Maeris</HI> could call the Ghosts out of their Sepulchres: And<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nunc animae tenues.—Sepulchris.—Errant.—<HI>Ovid. Fast.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ovid,</HI> that Ghosts came out of the Sepulchres, and wandered about: And <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus,</HI> in his <HI>Admonitions to the Gentiles,</HI> upbraids them with the Gods they worshipped; which,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Poos oun, <HI>&amp;c. Admonit. ad Gent. P.</HI> 37.</NOTE> says he, are wont to appear at Tombs and Sepulchres, and which are nothing but fading Spectres and airy Forms. And the learned Mr. <HI>Mede</HI> observes, from a Passage of this same ancient Father,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mede, Lib. <HI>3.</HI> P. <HI>633.</HI> de Cultu Daemon.</NOTE> <Q>That the Heathens supposed the Presence and Power of <HI>Daemons</HI> (for so the <HI>Greeks</HI> called the Souls of Men
<PB N="78" REF="96"/>
departed) at their Coffins and Sepulchres; as tho' there always remain'd some natural Tye between the Deceased and their Relicts.</Q> Agreeable to this, Dr. <HI>Scot,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scot, Christ. Life, P. <HI>71.</HI> Part <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> in his Discourse of the Christian Life, speaks of <Q><HI>gross</HI> and <HI>sensual</HI> Souls, who appeared often, after their Separation, in <HI>Church-Yards</HI> or <HI>Char∣nel-Houses,</HI> where their Bodies were laid. <HI>The</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plat. Phaed. P. <HI>348.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Soul that is infected with a great Lust to the Body, continues so, for a great while after Death, and suffering many Reluctances, ho∣vers about this visible Place, and is hardly drawn from thence by Force; by the</HI> Daemon <HI>that hath the Guard and Care of it.</HI> By the <HI>visible Place,</HI> he means<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. <HI>386.</HI> ibid.</NOTE> their <HI>Monuments and Sepulchres, where the shadowy Fantasms,</HI> of such Souls, <HI>have sometimes appeared.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It having therefore been a current Opinion of the Heathens, that <HI>Places of Burial and Church-Yards</HI> were frequently haunted with <HI>Spectres</HI> and <HI>Apparitions,</HI> it is easy to imagine, that the Opinion has been handed from them, among the Ignorant and unlearned, through∣out all the Ages of Christianity to the present Day. And indeed, tho' now there may be no such Things, yet that there have been, need not be disputed; not that they were the real Souls of Men departed: For I cannot see for
<PB N="79" REF="97"/>
what Reason it should be supposed, <Q>(<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scot. Christ. ibid.</NOTE> how∣ever unacquainted such Souls might be with the Pleasures of Spirits) that they are permit∣ted to wander, to hover about, and linger after their Bodies.</Q> It seems rather to be true, what is mentioned of such Apparitions in St. <HI>Athanasius</HI>'s Questions to <HI>Antiochius,</HI> that<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Athan. Tom. <HI>2.</HI> P. <HI>340.</HI></NOTE> these Apparitions of the Saints which appear at Tombs and Temples, are not the Souls of the Saints themselves, but the good Angels ap∣pearing in their Likeness. And I imagine it must be so too, with the Souls of bad Men, they appear not themselves, but they are re∣presented by the evil Angels. For the Soul upon the Departure, <HI>returns to GOD that gave it,</HI> who allots it its Station in the World of Spirits, where it is kept till the Day of Judgment in Happiness or Misery, when it shall receive its Compleation of the one, or the other. However, whatever these Apparitions were, they are a certain Proof, that such Ap∣pearances have been in such Places; and in∣deed, to add no more, it is the whole Voice of Antiquity.</P>
<P>But now with us, GOD be thanked, the Scene is changed, we live not in the Darkness of Errour, but in the Light of Truth; we worship not <HI>Daemons,</HI> but the GOD of the whole Earth; and our Temples are not the Temples of Idols, but the Temples of the Ho∣ly
<PB N="80" REF="98"/>
GOD.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of visiting Wells and Fountains: The Original of this Custom: The naming of them of great An∣tiquity: The Worship paid them by the Pa∣pists, was gross Idolatry.</HEAD>
<P>IN the dark Ages of <HI>Popery,</HI> it was a Custom, if any <HI>Well</HI> had an awful Situation, and was seated in some lonely melancholy Vale; if its Water was clear and limpid, and beauti∣fully<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">—Viridi si margine clauderet undas.—Herba.— <HI>Juven. Sat.</HI> 3.</NOTE> margin'd with the tender Grass; or if it was look'd upon, as having a Medicinal Quality; to gift it to some <HI>Saint,</HI> and honour it with his Name. Hence it is, that we have at this Day Wells and Fountains called, some St. <HI>John</HI>'s, St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s, St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s <HI>Well,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To these kind of Wells, the common People are accustomed to go, on a Summer's Evening, to refresh themselves with a <HI>Walk</HI> after the Toil of the Day, to drink the Water of the Fountain, and enjoy the pleasing Prospect of Shade and Stream.</P>
<P>Now this Custom (tho' at this Time of Day, very commendable, and harmless, and inno∣cent) seems to be the Remains of that super∣stitious Practice of the Papists, of paying
<PB N="83" REF="101"/>
Adoration to Wells and Fountains: For they imagin'd there was some Holiness and Sancti∣ty in them, and so worshipped them. In the <HI>Canons</HI> of St. <HI>Anselm,</HI> made in the Year 1102, we find this superstitious Practice in some Measure forbid.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Johnson</HI> Consti.

<P>There need be no Question, but as this Cus∣tom is practically Heathenish, so it is also originally: For the Heathens were wont to

worship Streams and Fountains, and to sup∣pose that the Nymphs, whom they imagin'd the Goddesses of the Waters, presided over them.

<P>OMENS and Prognostications of Things are still in the Mouths of all, though only observed by the Vulgar. In Country Places especially, they are in great Repute, and are the Directors of several Actions of Life; being looked on by them as Presages of Things future, or the Determiners of present Good or Evil: If<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lepus quoque occurrens in via, infortunatum iter prae∣sagit &amp; ominosum. <HI>Alex. ab Alex.

If Salt fall towards them, to be sure something has hap∣pened to one in the Family, or is shortly to happen to themselves: Such also is the Chat∣tering

<P>This is a Copy of the Omens of the Hea∣thens,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deinde anguribus &amp; reliqui reges usi: Et exactis regibus, nihil publice sine auspiciis nec domi nec militiae gerabatur. <HI>Cic. de Divin. Lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE> who never went upon any Enter∣prize, nor undertook any Business of Moment, without consulting the Augurs and Wise-Men, and being guided by Omens and Presages of Things. Hence it was that they consulted the Intrails of Beasts, the Flights of Birds, and several other Things: And that the very Things above-mentioned, as the Authorities there declare, have been observed by them; yea, they have observ'd them, even in the re∣motest Ages, beyond the Days of the oldest Records. The Heathen World therefore was full of them, and without all doubt they have been handed down to us from these Times.</P>
<P>And as it is not to be question'd, but we had them from the Heathens, so in all Proba∣bility the Heathens have taken them from the People of GOD, and built many of their Folies and ominous Superstitions on a Custom which they alone were indulged in. For in the ear∣liest Age of the World, when a Matter of any great Consequence was depending, and the Servants of GOD would know what the Event would be, they asked a <HI>Sign</HI> of GOD, by de∣siring
<PB N="89" REF="107"/>
that such a Thing might happen, if they were to succeed, and God was sometimes so condescending as to grant them their De∣sire. Thus we read, That<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sam. i. 14. iii. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Jonathan</HI> accom∣pany'd only by his Armour Bearer, not fear∣ing the Steepness of the Rocks, nor Multitudes of Enemies, attempted the Garrison of the <HI>Philistines</HI> and conquered, through a Token of this Nature. <HI>If they say,</HI> says he to his Armour-Bearer, <HI>Tarry untill we come up, then we will stand still in our Place, and will not go up unto them; but if they say come up unto us, then we will go up; for the LORD hath deli∣vered them into our Hands, and this shall be a Sign unto us.</HI> And so indeed it came to pass, GOD who had inspired <HI>Jonathan</HI> with this Thought, directing the Tongues of the others according to his Wishes. In like Manner, when the good old Servant of <HI>Abraham</HI> had arrived at the City of <HI>Nahor,</HI> to find a Wife for his Master's Son; we have him desiring of GOD, that the Sign of the Woman he should pitch upon, might be her saying, <HI>Drink, and I will give thy Camels Drink also.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxiv. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Ana he said, O Lord GOD of my Master</HI> Abraham, <HI>I pray thee send me good Speed this Day, and shew Kindness unto my Master</HI> Abraham: <HI>Behold, I stand here by the Well of Water, and the Daughters of the
<PB N="90" REF="108"/>
Men of the City came out to draw Water. And let it come to pass, that the Damsel to whom I shall say, let down thy Pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy Camels Drink also: Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy Servant</HI> Isaac; <HI>and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed Kindness unto my Master.</HI> This happened ac∣cording to his Prayer, by which he knew that the LORD had prospered his Journey. Now this Custom we know the <HI>Philistines</HI> imitated, when they would know whether they had been afflicted by the GOD of <HI>Israel</HI> for keep∣ing the Ark.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sam. i. 6, 9.</NOTE> <HI>They took the Ark of the LORD, and laid it on a Cart, and sent it away. And they said, If it goeth by the Way of his own Coast to</HI> Beth-shemoth, <HI>then he hath done us this great Evil.</HI></P>
<P>In these early Ages of the World, GOD per∣mitted such Things upon extraordinary Occa∣sions, to be asked by his own People. But they were only peculiar to those Times. We have no Warrant for doing the like: It be∣comes not us to prescribe Means to GOD, by which we may judge of our future Success, but to depend on his Power and Wisdom, his Care and Providence. The Observation of Omens, such as the falling of Salt, a Hare
<PB N="91" REF="109"/>
crossing the Way, of the Dead-Watch, of Cric∣kets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are sinful and diabolical: They are the Inventions of the Devil, to draw Men from a due Trust in GOD, and make them his own Vassals.

<DIV3 TYPE="Brand's commentary">
<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>VArious are the popular Superstitions with re∣gard to <HI>Omens</HI>—To these our Author has hinted at, many more may be added.</P>
<P>The breaking a <HI>Looking Glass</HI> is accounted a very unlucky Accident.—<HI>Mirrors</HI> were formerly used by Magicians in their superstitious and diabolical Ope∣rations; and there was an antient Kind of Divina∣tion by the <HI>Looking Glass:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Greek <HI>Scholia</HI> on the <HI>Nubes</HI> of Aristophanes, p. 169.</NOTE> Hence it should seem the present popular Notion.</P>
<P>When our <HI>Cheek burns,</HI> or <HI>Ear tingles,</HI> we usually say somebody is <HI>talking of us</HI>—a Conceit of great Antiquity, and ranked among superstitious Opini∣ons by Pliny<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Absentes <HI>tinnitu aurium</HI> praesentire <HI>sermones de se</HI> receptum est.</P>
<P>Thus also the Distich noted by Dalecampius:

<L>Nescio quem dicis nunc <HI>meminisse mei?</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Moresin enumerates some of these superstitious <HI>Omens:</HI>—The croaking of <HI>Ravens,</HI> the hooting of <HI>Owls,</HI> the unseasonable meet∣ing with <HI>Cocks,</HI> the Hornedness of the <HI>Moon,</HI> the cloudy rising of the <HI>Sun,</HI> the shooting of <HI>Stars,</HI> the coming in and going out of strange <HI>Cats,</HI> the sudden Fall of <HI>Hens</HI> from the House-Top, &amp;c.— Corvorum crocitatum super tecto, bubonum bubulatum in transitu, Gallorum gallinaceorum cucurritum intempestivum — lunae corni∣culationem, Solis nubilum ortum, stellarum trajectiones in Aere — felium peregrinarum egressum, ingressum—Gallinarum subitum è tecto casum stupent, &amp;c.

<PB N="92" REF="110"/>
or <HI>universal Mercury,</HI> that conducted Sounds to their distant Subjects and taught to hear by Touch.</P>
<P>It is accounted unlucky to destroy <HI>Swallows;</HI>— This is probably a Pagan Relique. We read in Aelian, that these Birds were sacred to the <HI>Penates,</HI> or household Gods of the Antients, and therefore were preserved. They were honoured antiently as the <HI>Nuncios</HI> of the Spring.—The Rhodians are said to have had a solemn anniversary Song, to welcome in the Swallow. See Anacreon's Ode to that Bird.</P>
<P>I think it is Mr Addison that supposes the popu∣lar Ballad of the <HI>Babes in the Wood</HI> to have pre∣served the Lives of many <HI>Robin Redbreasts.</HI> The subsequent Stanza places them in a very favourable Point of View:

<P>There was an antient Custom of <HI>opening</HI> some celebrated Poem, as <HI>Homer's</HI> or <HI>Virgil's,</HI> and what∣ever Passage presented itself first to the Eye con∣stituted a Kind of Answer by Oracle: It was called the <HI>Sortes Homericae</HI> and <HI>Sortes Virgilianae.</HI> —The Superstitious among the antient Christians practised a similar Kind of Divination, by opening the <HI>Old</HI> or <HI>New</HI> Testament. Mr Pennant gives us an Ac∣count of another Sort of Divination, used in Scot∣land, called <Q>reading the <HI>Speal Bone,</HI> or the Blade∣bone of a Shoulder of Mutton well <HI>scraped</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Shaw says <HI>picked:</HI> No Iron must touch it.

<P><PB N="94" REF="112"/>One may add to Mr. Pennant's Account, the strange Qualification many of the Inhabitants of the western Islands of Scotland are said to have, called <HI>Second Sight.</HI> It is a Faculty of seeing Things to come, or at a great Distance, represented to the Imagination as if actually visible and present. This <HI>strange</HI> Thing has been well attested, and that by Authors of Credit. <HI>Credat Judaeus apella!</HI>—See the Appendix, Article <HI>Second Sight.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>fungous Parcells</HI> (so Browne calls them) about the Wicks of <HI>Candles,</HI> are commonly thought to foretell <HI>Strangers:</HI> With us they are called <HI>Let∣ters at the Candle.</HI> He tells us, (in his usual Pe∣dantry of Stile, which is well atoned for by his good Sense and Learning,) <Q>they only indicate a moist and pluvious Air, which hinders the Avo∣lation of the light and favillous Particles, where∣upon they settle upon the Snast.</Q> Of this Kind is the present northern Notion of <HI>foretelling Strangers</HI> from the <HI>black filmy Appendages</HI> (so per∣haps the Author of the Vulgar Errors would have called them) on the <HI>Bars</HI> of our <HI>Fire</HI> Grates.</P>

<P>Nourishing <HI>Hair</HI> upon the <HI>Moles</HI> in the Face (the Doctor tells us) is the Perpetuation of a very antient Custom.— Thus Pliny: <Q><HI>Naevos</HI> in <HI>facie</HI> tondere <HI>religiosum</HI> habent nunc multi.</Q>—From the like might proceed the Fears of <HI>poling Elf-locks,</HI> or <HI>complicated Hairs</HI> of the <HI>Head,</HI> and also of <HI>Locks</HI> longer than the other Hair, they being vo∣tary at first, and dedicated upon Occasion, pre∣served with great Care, and accordingly esteemed by others.—Thus Apuleius: <Q>Adjuro per <HI>dulcem</HI> Capilli tui <HI>Nodulum!</HI></Q> The <HI>set</HI> and <HI>statary Times</HI> (he farther observes) of <HI>paring</HI> of <HI>Nails</HI> and <HI>cutting</HI> of <HI>Hair,</HI> is thought by many a Point of Conside∣ration,

which is perhaps but the Continuation of an antient Superstition.—To the Romans, it was piaculous to pare their Nails upon the <HI>Nundinoe,</HI> observed every <HI>ninth Day,</HI> and was also feared by others in <HI>certain Days</HI> of the <HI>Week,</HI> according to that of Ausonius: <HI>Ungues Mercurio,</HI> Barbam Jove, Cypride crines.</P>
<P>Mr. Pennant, in describing the Customs of Highlanders, tells us, that in certain Places the <HI>Death</HI> of People is supposed to be <HI>foretold</HI> by the <HI>Cries</HI> and <HI>Shrieks</HI> of <HI>Benshi,</HI> or the <HI>Fairy's Wife,</HI> uttered along the very <HI>Path</HI> where the <HI>Funeral</HI> is to pass, and what in Wales are called <HI>Corps' Can∣dles,</HI> are often imagined to appear and <HI>foretell Mor∣tality.</HI> In the County of Carmarthen, there is hardly any one that dies, but some one or other <HI>sees</HI> his <HI>Light</HI> or <HI>Candle.</HI>—There is a similar Super∣stition among the Vulgar in Northumberland: They call it seeing the <HI>Waff</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I suspect this northern vulgar Word to be a Corruption of <HI>Whiff,</HI> a sudden and vehement Blast, which Davies thinks is de∣rived from the <HI>Welch,</HI> Chwyth, <HI>Halitus, Anhelitus, Flatus.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the Country Conversation in a Winter's Even∣ing: Their Opinions of Spirits and Apparitions; of the Devil's appearing with a cloven Foot; of Fairies and Hobgoblins; of the walking Places of Spirits; and of haunted Houses.</HEAD>
<P>NOthing is commoner in <HI>Country Places,</HI> than for a whole Family in a <HI>Winter's Evening,</HI> to sit round the Fire, and tell Stories of Apparitions and Ghosts. And no Question of it, but this adds to the natural Fearfulness of Men, and makes them many Times ima∣gine they see Things, which really are no∣thing but their own Fancy. From this, and seldom any other Cause, it is, that <HI>Herds</HI> and <HI>Shepherds</HI> have all of them seen <HI>frequent Ap∣paritions,</HI> and are generally so well stock'd with Stories of their own Knowledge. Some of them have seen <HI>Fairies,</HI> some <HI>Spirits</HI> in the Shapes of <HI>Cows</HI> and <HI>Dogs</HI> and <HI>Horses;</HI> and some have seen even the <HI>Devil</HI> himself, with a <HI>cloven Foot.</HI> All which, is either <HI>Hearsay</HI> or a <HI>strong Imagination.</HI> Not that there have not been, or may not be Apparitions; we know that there have undoubtedly been such Things, and that there still are, upon parti∣lar Occasions; but that almost all the Stories of Ghosts and Spirits, are grounded on no
<PB N="103" REF="121"/>
other Bottom, than the Fears and Fancies, and weak Brains of Men.</P>
<P>In their Account of the Apparition of the Devil, they always describe him with a <HI>cloven Foot:</HI> That is always his distinguishing Badge, whatever Shape he appears in; whe∣ther it be in Beauty or Deformity, he never appears without it. Such is the old Tradi∣tion they have received of his appearing, and such is their Belief of it.</P>
<P>Indeed it must be confess'd, that this is not so improbable and ridiculous as many Things they hold. For tho' perhaps few of them have ought else for this Opinion, but <HI>old Wives Fables,</HI> or the Picture of the Devil, which they have always observed drawn with a cloven Foot, yet there seems to be some Truth in it. For in the Times of frequent Apparitions, the Devil was wont to appear so, if we may believe Antiquity; and there is also some Reason for it, considering the Cir∣cumstances of the fallen Angels.</P>
<P>The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brown's Vulg. Err.</NOTE> Author of the <HI>Vulgar Errors</HI> upon this same Subject, hath these Words. <Q>The Ground of this Opinion at first, might be his frequent appearing in the Shape of a Goat, which answers this Description. This was the Opinion of the ancient Chri∣stians,
<PB N="104" REF="122"/>
concerning the Apparitions of <HI>Pa∣nites, Fauns</HI> and <HI>Satyrs;</HI> and of this Form we read of one, that appeared to <HI>Anthony</HI> in the Wilderness. The same is also confirmed from Expositions of Holy Scripture. For whereas it is said, <HI>Thou shalt not offer unto Devils:</HI> The original Word is <HI>Seghnirim;</HI> that is, <HI>rough and hairy Goats,</HI> because in that Shape the Devil most often appeared, as is expounded by the <HI>Rabbins,</HI> as <HI>Tremellius</HI> hath also explain'd, and as the Word <HI>Asci∣mah,</HI> the God of <HI>Emath</HI> is by some conceived. He observes also, That the <HI>Goat</HI> was the Emblem of the <HI>Sin Offering,</HI> and is the Em∣blem of Sinful Men at the Day of Judg∣ment.</Q></P>
<P>And of this Opinion was also the learned Mr.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mede, Dis. 40.</NOTE> <HI>Mede.</HI> He says, <Q>That when Spirits converse with Men, it is under some visible Shape, and that there is a Law given them that that Shape they assum'd, should be of something which more or less resembled their Condition. For as in Nature we see every Thing hath a several and suitable <HI>Physiog∣nomy</HI> or <HI>Figure,</HI> as a Badge of their inward Nature, whereby it is known, as by a Habit of Distinction, so it seems to be in the Shapes and Apparitions of Spirits. And as in a well governed Common Wealth,
<PB N="105" REF="123"/>
every Sort and Condition is known by a dif∣fering Habit, agreeable to his Quality; so it seems it should be in GOD'S great Common Wealth, concerning the Shapes which Spi∣rits take upon them. And he that gave the Law, that a Man should not wear the Habit of a Woman, nor a Woman the Ha∣bit of a Man, because that as he had made them diverse, so would he have them so known by their Habits; so it seems he will not suffer a good and a bad Spirit, a noble and ignoble one, to appear unto Man after the same Fashion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now from this it will follow, that good Angels can take upon them no other Shape, but the Shape of Man, because their glori∣ous Excellency is resembled only in the most excellent of all visible Creatures. The Shape of an inferior Creature would be un∣suitable, no other Shape becoming those who are called <HI>the Sons of GOD,</HI> but his only, who <HI>was created after GOD's own Image.</HI> And yet, not his neither as he now is, but according as he was before his Fall in his glorious Beauty of his Integrity. Age and Deformity are the Fruits of Sin; and the Angel in the Gospel appears like a young Man, <HI>His</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxviii.</NOTE> <HI>Countenance like Light∣ning, and his Raiment white as Snow,</HI> as it
<PB N="106" REF="124"/>
were resembling the Beauty of glorified Bodies, in Immutability, Sublimity and Purity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hence also it follows on the contrary, that the Devil could not appear in humane Shape whilst Man was in his Integrity; be∣cause he was a Spirit fallen from his first glorious Perfection, and therefore must ap∣pear in such Shape, which might argue his Imperfection and Abasement, which was the Shape of a Beast: Otherwise no Reason can be given, why he should not rather have appeared to <HI>Eve</HI> in the Shape of a Woman, than of a Serpent; for so he might have gain'd an Opinion with her, both of more Excellency and Knowledge. But since the Fall of Man, the Case is al∣ter'd; now we know he can take upon him the Shape of Man; and no Wonder, since one falling Star may resemble another. And therefore he appears it seems in the Shape of Man's Imperfection, either for Age or Deformity, as like an old Man (for so the Witches say:) And perhaps it is not altogether false, which is vulgarly affirmed, that the Devil appearing in humane Shape, hath always a Deformity of some uncouth Member or other; as tho' he could not yet take upon him humane Shape intirely, for that Man himself, is not intirely and ut∣terly fallen as he is.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="125"/>Thus far hath this great and learned Man given his Opinion of this Matter, and that with such Strength of Reason and Argument, as leaves at least a Probability behind it, of the Truth of this Opinion.</P>
<P>Another Part of this Conversation generally turns upon <HI>Fairies.</HI> These, they tell you, have frequently been heard and seen, nay that there are some still living who were stolen away by them, and confined seven Years. According to the Description they give of them, who pretend to have seen them, they are in the Shape of Men, exceeding little: They are always clad in Green, and frequent the Woods and Fields; when they make Cakes (which is a Work they have been often heard at) they are very noisy; and when they have done, they are full of Mirth and Pastime. But generally they dance in <HI>Moon-Light</HI> when Mor∣tals are asleep, and not capable of seeing them, as may be observed on the following Morn; their dancing Places being very distinguish∣able. For as they dance Hand in Hand, and so make a <HI>Circle</HI> in their Dance, so next Day there will be seen <HI>Rings</HI> and <HI>Circles</HI> on the Grass.</P>
<P>Now in all this there is really nothing, but an old fabulous Story, which has been handed down even to our Days from the Times of <HI>Heathenism,</HI> of a certain Sort of Beings called
<PB N="108" REF="126"/>
<HI>Lamiae,</HI> which were esteemed so mischievous and cruel, as to take away young Children and slay them. These, together with the <HI>the Fauns,</HI> the <HI>Gods of the Woods,</HI> seem to have formed the Notion of Fairies.</P>
<P>This Opinion, in the benighted Ages of Popery, when <HI>Hobgoblins</HI> and <HI>Sprights</HI> were in every <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Village,</HI> by every <HI>Water</HI> and in every <HI>Wood,</HI> was very common. But when that Cloud was dispell'd, and the Day sprung up, those Spirits which wander'd in the Night of Ignorance and Error, did real∣ly vanish at the Dawn of Truth and the Light of Knowledge.</P>
<P>Another Tradition they hold, and which is often talk'd of, is, that there are particular Places alotted to Spirits to walk in. Thence it was that formerly, such frequent Reports were abroad of this and that particular Place being haunted by a Spirit, and that the com∣mon People say now and then, such a Place is dangerous to be pass'd through at Night, be∣cause a Spirit walks there. Nay, they'll fur∣ther tell you, that some Spirits have lamented the Hardness of their Condition, in being ob∣liged to walk in cold and uncomfortable Pla∣ces, and have therefore desired the Person who was so hardy as to speak to them, to gift them with a warmer Walk, by some well grown
<PB N="109" REF="127"/>
<HI>Hedge,</HI> or in some <HI>shady Vale,</HI> where they might be shelter'd from the Rain and Wind.</P>
<P>The Stories, that Apparitions have been seen oftner than once in the same Place, have no Doubt been the Rise and Spring of the walking Places of Spirits; but why they are said sometimes to cry out for Places that are more comfortable, is not so certainly known. It is however highly probable, that when the Ignorance and Superstition of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, had filled the World with <HI>Apparitions</HI> and <HI>Ghosts,</HI> that this also was invented among them. For they seem to have the most <HI>Right</HI> to an Invention of this Nature, whose Brains were so fruitful of Folly, as to invent that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Ch. Hist. Cen. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Dunstan</HI> took the Devil by the Nose, with a Pair of hot <HI>Tongs</HI> till he roar'd again. For if the Devil may be burnt, he may also be starv'd; if he took such Pains to get his Nose out of the <HI>Pincers,</HI> without Doubt in a frosty Night, he would wish to be as warm as possi∣ble. He that believes the one, must necessarily believe the other. And therefore it very near amounts to a Demonstration, who were the Authors of this Opinion, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Monks.</HI> We are sure they invented the one, and need little question but they invented the other.</P>
<P>There is a Story in the Book of <HI>Tobit,</HI> (which they may believe that will) of the <HI>evil Spirits</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="128"/>
flying into the utmost Parts of <HI>Egypt.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tob. vi.</NOTE> <HI>For as</HI> Tobias <HI>went in unto his Wife, he remembred the Words of</HI> Raphael, <HI>and took the Ashes of the Perfumes, and put the Heart and Liver of the Fish thereupon, and made a Smoke therewith. The which Smell, when the evil Spirit had smelled, he fled unto the utmost Parts of</HI> Egypt, <HI>and the Angel bound him.</HI> Now from this it is evident, that the Spirit was obliged to forsake his good old Quarters and warm Lodgings, for inhospitable Desarts and open Air: And from this, perhaps, some of those <HI>doting Monks</HI> have persuaded themselves into a Belief of these Things.</P>
<P>When it is proved to us, that this Book of <HI>Tobit</HI> is the Word of GOD, we may entertain more Veneration for this vulgar Opinion; but till then, we must be indulg'd in wondering, how a Spirit, that is an <HI>immaterial Substance,</HI> can be affected with our Heat or Cold, or any Power or Quality of <HI>material Beings.</HI></P>
<P>The last Topick of this Conversation I shall take Notice of, shall be the Tales of <HI>haunted</HI> Houses. And indeed it is not to be wonder'd at, that this is never omitted. For formerly almost every Place had a House of this Kind. If a House was seated on some melancholly Place, or built in some old romantic Manner; or if any particular Accident had happen'd in
<PB N="111" REF="129"/>
it, such as Murder, sudden Death, or the like, to be sure that House had a Mark set on it, and was afterwards esteemed the Habitation of a Ghost. In talking upon this Point, they generally show the Occasion of the House's be∣ing <HI>haunted,</HI> the merry Pranks of the Spirit, and how it was laid. Stories of this Kind are infinite, and there are few <HI>Villages</HI> which have not either had such an House in it, or near it.</P>
<P>And indeed there are Men of good Learn∣ing and Knowledge, who are as far as others from Superstition, who are inclinable to be∣lieve, that such Things have been upon parti∣cular Emergencies; tho', among the Stories that are told, they believe not one in a thou∣sand. They know that Spirits have frequent∣ly appeared to Men out of Houses, and they can see no Reason why they may not have ap∣peared in them: They know nothing in an House more than in another Place, to prevent an Apparition, but an equal Help to its Visi∣bility. The Air, which a Ghost is supposed to be wrapped in, when it becomes visible to Men, is there to be found, and they know of nothing else that may be an Argument against it. An Author of good Credit tells us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cum <HI>Romae</HI> aegra valetudine oppressus forem, jaceremque in lectulo, speciem mulieris eleganti forma mihi plane vigi∣lanti observatam fuisse, quam cum inspicerem, diu cogita∣bundus, &amp;c.—Cum meos sensus vigere, &amp; figuram illam nusquam a me dilabi, &amp;c. <HI>Alex. ab Alex. Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>C.</HI> 9.</NOTE> That
<PB N="112" REF="130"/>
when he was at <HI>Rome,</HI> he was taken with Ill∣ness, and obliged to keep his Bed: As he lay in this Condition, he observed, as he was once awake, a <HI>Woman</HI> of a very beautiful Person coming towards him. Upon this he was silent for some Time, and very thoughtful, weigh∣ing all the while with himself, whether it was not rather a <HI>deceptio visus</HI> than a real Being. But when he perceived his Senses sound and intire, and that the Object still continued; he asked, What she was? In Answer to which, she repeated the very Words he had spoken to her, in a sneering and disdainful Manner. After she had taken a good View of him, she departed.</P>
<P>The Commentator upon this Place, says,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sed haec semper mera somnia esse putavi. <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE> He looks upon this Story, and the rest which are mentioned along with it, to be nothing but Dreams and Fancies. And for ought that I know to the contrary, they may be so; but however it must be confess'd, this Story in particular is well attested, being told by the Man himself, who was a great and a learned Man, and who, if we may believe himself, seems to be as sure that he had his Eyes open, as the Commentator can be of the contrary.</P>
<P>But whatever Truth there may be in it, it is certain that in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> they are persuaded of the Truth of it, to a Fault.
<PB N="113" REF="131"/>
For they are so sure of it, that they have par∣ticular Forms of <HI>exorcising</HI> such Houses; which because they have often been heard of, but seldom seen; and are those very Things which raised, in the Vulgar formerly, such an Opinion of their ignorant Priests, as to make them be esteemed Men of the greatest Faith and Learning; and because also the Opinion has reached even our Days, and 'tis common for the present Vulgar to say, none can lay a Spirit but a <HI>Popish Priest;</HI> it shall be the Business of the next Chapter, to give one of those Forms of <HI>exorcising</HI> an House; not that they are envied for their Art of <HI>conjuring,</HI> but that it may be seen, how well they deserve the Character they go under.</P>

I mention this, because, from the Biographical Account of him prefixed to the posthumous Edition of his Works, (an <HI>Outline</HI> with which he himself must have fur∣nished his Friends) one is inclined to believe that he was <HI>ashamed</HI> of his <HI>Birth.</HI>—We regret, on perusing it, the Omission of those pleasing and interesting little <HI>Anecdotes</HI> usually given of the <HI>first Indications</HI> of <HI>Genius.</HI>—His Townsmen have many other Reasons that lead to the Confirmation of this Suspicion.—Taking this for granted, it was a great and unpardonable Foible in one of so ex∣alted an Understanding. <HI>False Shame</HI> was perhaps never more strongly exemplified. The learned World will forgive me for at∣tempting in this Note to <HI>defeat</HI> his very <HI>narrow Purpose,</HI> (for I can call by no softer Name) the wishing to conceal from Posterity a Circumstance, that would by no means have lessened his Fame with them.

<P>The Distinction of <HI>Family</HI> is honourable: It is the <HI>transmitted Inheritance</HI> of <HI>great Deserts.</HI> But let it be remembered, that <HI>Self-creation</HI> by personal Merit is the <HI>pure Fountain,</HI> of which <HI>that</HI> is too often no more than the <HI>polluted Stream.

Mankind, and especially the common People, could not every where have been so unanimously agreed concern∣ing these arbitrary Notions, if they had not prevailed among them for many Ages.

Lo, we go out. But thou, O King, set on the Meat, and make ready the Wine, and shut the Door fast, and seal it with thine own Sig∣net. And to Morrow when thou comest in, if thou findest not that <HI>Bel</HI> hath eaten up all, we will suffer Death, or else <HI>Daniel</HI> that speak∣eth against us.

So when they were gone forth, the King set Meats be∣fore <HI>Bel.</HI> Now <HI>Daniel</HI> had commanded his Servants to bring Ashes, and those they strew∣ed throughout all the Temple, in the Pre∣sence of the King alone: Then went they out and shut the Door, and sealed it with the King's Signet, and so departed. Now in the Night came the Priests, with their Wives and Children, as they were wont to do, and did eat and drink up all. In the Morning betime the King arose, and <HI>Daniel</HI> with him. And the King said, <HI>Daniel,</HI> are the Seals whole? And <HI>Daniel</HI> said, Yea, O King, they be whole. And assoon as he had open'd the Door, the King looked upon the Table, and cried with a loud Voice, Great art thou, O <HI>Bel,</HI> and with thee there is no Deceit at all. Then <HI>Daniel</HI> laughed, and told the King that he should not go in, and said, Behold now the Pavement, and mark well whose Footsteps

And then the King was angry, and took the Priests with their Wives and Children, who shewed him the privy Doors where they came in and consumed such Things as were upon the Table. Therefore the King slew them, and delivered <HI>Bel</HI> into <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Power, who de∣stroyed him and his Temple.</P>

And he ran before, and climbed up into a Sy∣comore Tree to see him, for he was to pass that Way. And when JESUS came to the Place, he looked up and saw him, and said unto him, <HI>Zaccheus</HI> make haste and come down, for to Day I must abide at thy House. And he made haste and came down, and received
<PB N="140" REF="158"/>
him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be a Guest with a Man that is a Sinner. And <HI>Zac∣cheus</HI> stood and said unto the LORD, Behold, LORD, the Half of my Goods I give to the Poor: And if I have taken any Thing of any Man, by false Accusation, I restore him four∣fold. And JESUS said unto him, This Day is Salvation come to this House, forasmuch as he also is the Son of <HI>Abraham.</HI> For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</P>
<P><HI>When all these Things are done, let <HI>Abyssum,</HI> which is a Kind of an Herb, be procur'd, and after it is sign'd with the Sign of the Cross, let it be hung up at the four Corners of the House.</HI></P>
<P>I suppose the Reason of proceeding after this Manner Day by Day, is that the Devil may be gradually banished: And to be sure, what is observed on the last of the Days, <HI>viz.</HI> The or∣dering of the <HI>Crucifix,</HI> the <HI>holy Water,</HI> the <HI>Abys∣sum</HI> tyed to the four Corners of the House, is to keep the Devil out when he is out.</P>

<P>Here is indeed an Account of a House be∣ing haunted, but not a Word of any such Or∣der in the dispossessing it. The Priest goes im∣mediately over the Threshold into the troubled Apartment, and expells the Spirits by his Pray∣ers. Had such Forms been customary in the Days of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> had the <HI>Crucifix, holy Wa∣ter</HI> and <HI>Abyssum,</HI> been used, no Question but here, or somewhere else, we should have had some Account of it: But these Ages were unac∣quainted with such whimsical Forms of exorci∣sing; and if the Story be true, it was nothing but Prayer that quieted the House.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of <HI>Saturday</HI> Afternoon; how observed of old, by the ancient Christians, the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the old Church of <HI>England:</HI> What End we should observe it for: An Exhortation to the Observation of it.</HEAD>
<P>IT is usual, in Country Places and Villages, where the Politeness of the Age hath made no great Conquest, to observe some particular Times with some Ceremonies, which were customary in the Days of our Fore-fathers: Such are the great Festivals of Christmas, Easter, and several others, which they observe with Rites and Customs appropriated to them.</P>
<P>Among these we find a great Deference paid to <HI>Saturday Afternoon,</HI> above the other worky Days of the Week: Then the Labours of the Plough ceast, and Refreshment and Ease are over all the Village.</P>
<P>This seems to be the Remains of a laudable Custom once in this Land (but now almost buried in that general Contempt of Religion and Love of the World, which prevail so much every where) of attending the Evening Prayers on Saturday, and laying aside the Concerns of this Life, to be fitter for the Duties of the
<PB N="146" REF="164"/>
Day following. For<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Baily,</HI> Prac. Piety, <HI>P.</HI> 453.</NOTE> <Q>it was an holy Cus∣tom among our Fore-fathers, when at the Ringing to Prayer the <HI>Eve</HI> before the <HI>Sab∣bath,</HI> the <HI>Husbandman</HI> would give over his Labour in the Field, and the <HI>Tradesman</HI> his Work in the Shop, and go to Evening Prayer in the Church, to prepare their Souls, that their Minds might more chearfully attend <HI>GOD's Worship</HI> on the <HI>Sabbath-Day.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And indeed it was the Custom both of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and the Christian Church. They nei∣ther of them entred upon the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> without some Preparation for it. <HI>Moses</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Exod. xvi. Mark xiv.</NOTE> taught the <HI>Jews</HI> to remember the <HI>Sabbath</HI> over Night; from whence in all Probability it comes to pass, that the Eve of the <HI>Jewish Sabbath</HI> is called the <HI>Preparation.</HI> The Preparation mentioned by the Evangelists, begun at Three a Clock on <HI>Friday</HI> Afternoon; it was proclaimed with the Noise of Trumpets and Horns, that they might be better put in Mind of the <HI>Sabbath</HI>'s draw∣ing on, and of that Preparation which was requisite for it.</P>
<P>Among the primitive Christians the LORD'S Day was always usher'd in with a <HI>Pernoctation</HI> or <HI>Vigil.</HI> They assembled in the House of GOD, and sung Psalms and Praises to him a great Part
<PB N="147" REF="165"/>
of the Night, that they might be better pre∣pared to serve him on his own Day following.</P>
<P>In the Year of our LORD 1203, <HI>William</HI> King of <HI>Scotland</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Scotia</HI> anno salutis 1203, <HI>Gulielmus</HI> Rex primorum Regni sui concilium cogit, cui etiam interfuit Pontificius Le∣gatus, in quo decretum est, ut Saturni Dies abhora 12 Me∣ridiei sacer esset, neque quisquam res profanas exerceret, que∣madmodum aliis quoque festis diebus vetitum id erat. Idque campanae pulsu populo indicaretur, ac postea sacris rebus, ut diebus festis operam darint, concionibus interessent, vesperas audirent, idque in diem lunae facerent, constituta transgresso∣ribus gravi paena. <HI>Boet. Lib.</HI> 13. <HI>de Scot. ex Hospin. P.</HI> 176.</NOTE> called a Council of the chief Men of his Kingdom, at which also was pre∣sent the Pope's Legate; and it was then deter∣min'd, that <HI>Saturday</HI> after the twelfth Hour should be kept holy; that no one should fol∣low their Business nor Callings, but desist as on other Holy Days: That they should be put in Mind of it by the Tolling of the Bell, and then mind the Business of Religion as on Holy Days, be present at the Sermon, and hear Vespers; that this should be the Practice till <HI>Munday</HI> Morning, and whoever acted other∣wise should be severely punished.</P>
<P>And this, as is said before, was also the Custom of our own Country, long before this order'd in <HI>Scotland.</HI> For in the Year 958, when King <HI>Edgar</HI> made his Ecclesiastical Laws, we find one made to this very Purpose: In which
<PB N="148" REF="166"/>
it is order'd, That<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dies sabbati ab ipsa diei saturni hora pomeridiana tertia, usque in luminarii diei diluculum festus agitator, &amp;c. <HI>Seld. Analect. Angl.

The Monks by their Rules, could not eat their Dinner, till they had said their <HI>Noon Song,</HI> which was a Ser∣vice regularly to be said at Three a Clock; but they probably an∣ticipated their Devotions and their Dinner, by saying their <HI>Noon Song</HI> immediately after their <HI>Mid-day Song,</HI> and presently fall∣ing on. I wish they had never been guilty of a worse Fraud than this. But it may fairly be supposed, that when <HI>Mid-day</HI> became the Time of Dining and saying <HI>Noon Song,</HI> it was for this Rea∣son called Noon by the Monks, who were the Masters of the Lan∣guage during the dark Ages.

<P>Now hence hath come the present Custom, of spending a Part of <HI>Saturday</HI> Afternoon with∣out servile Labour. And that our Fore-fathers, when the Bell was heard, attended the Evening Prayer, not fearing the Loss of Time, nor the Necessities of Poverty. Happy would it be for us, would we so banish the Care of the Body for the Care of the Soul! Would we leave to converse about secular Business, and mind then

<P>When <HI>Jacob</HI> was going to worship GOD at <HI>Bethel,</HI> he order'd his Family <HI>to</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxv. 2.</NOTE> <HI>put away the strange Gods that were among them, and be clean, and change their Garments, and arise and go to</HI> Bethel. He knew that the GOD of Pu∣rity and Holiness was to be approached with the utmost Purity they could possibly cloth themselves with. And would we, before we enter into the Presence of GOD on his own Day, endeavour to purifie our selves from the Filth of the World we have contracted in the Days before; would we disperse these busy Swarms of Things, which so attract our Minds, and prepare our selves for the follow∣ing Day; we should appear before GOD, less earthly and more heavenly, less sinful and more holy; <HI>Our</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxliv. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Prayers would be set forth in his Sight as the Incense, and the lifting up of our Hands be an Evening Sacrifice:</HI> And like the Smell of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Garment in the Nostrils of his Father, the Smell of our Prayers <HI>would</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxvii. 27.</NOTE><HI>be like the Smell of a Field which the LORD hath blessed.</HI></P>
<P>And now what is this Preparation, but the <HI>Trimming of our Lamps</HI> against we meet
<PB N="150" REF="168"/>
the LORD on the next Day? Our Bodies should be refreshed by ceasing early from their Labour, that they may be active and vigorous; and our Souls washed with Sobri∣ety and Temperance, and the private or public Prayer of the Evening. Thus should we meet the LORD at <HI>Bethel,</HI> and obtain those Mercies we sought of him there.</P>
<P>Art thou then blessed with an affluence of Things, and hath Providence placed Thee above the careful Sations of Life? What Rea∣son then can be sufficient for thy Neglect of this Custom? For neither canst thou plead the want of Time, neither dost thou dread the straits of Poverty.</P>
<P>Or art thou involv'd in the Cares of Busi∣ness? <HI>Dost thou earn thy Bread by the Sweat of thy Face, and the Labours of thy Hands? O well is Thee! And happy mayst thou be.</HI> Wouldst thou dedicate this small Time to the Service of GOD, it would be like the Wi∣dow's Mite, which was more than all that was thrown into the Treasury: But perhaps, thou wilt say thou art under the Yoke, sub∣ject to Servitude, and obliged to work even to the latter End of the Day. It may be so, but yet, as GOD is every where present, so wouldst thou Remember that it is the Prepa∣ration, and put up an Ejaculation at thy Work, GOD would accept it, and it would prove to

thee, an equal Good with the other Prepara∣tion. <HI>Cassian</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haec officia—per totum dici spatium jugiter cum operis adjectione, spontanea celebrantur. <HI>Cassian, Instit.

Where∣soever you go, you have either the Plough-Man singing Hallelujahs as he's holding the Plough, or the sweating Mower pleasing him∣self with Hymns; or the Vine-dresser singing <HI>David</HI>'s Psalms. These without doubt were acceptable to GOD, and thine undoubtedly will be acceptable also.</P>
<P>But if thou art not ty'd down by Necessity, do not say that the common Necessaries of Life require then thy Labour: For this is not losing, but <HI>Redeeming the Time;</HI> what thou spendest in the Care of thy Soul, is not lost in the Care of thy Body. Never was Man poorer, for observing the Duties of Re∣ligion. If thou lose any Thing of the Wages

<P><HI>Why then art thou fearful, O! Thou of little Faith! Why dost thou take so much Thought for thy Life? Behold the Fowls of the Air, for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into Barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them: Art thou not much better than they? And why takest thou thought for Rayment? Con∣sider the Lilies of the Field, they toil not, nei∣ther do they Spin; and yet I say unto thee, that</HI> Solomon, <HI>in all his Glory, was not arrayed like one of these. And shall he not much more Cloath thee, O Thou of little Faith! Therefore take no Thought for what thou shalt Eat, or what thou shalt Drink, or where withal thou shall be Cloathed; but seek thou first the Kingdom of GOD and his Righteousness;</HI> prefer the Care of these, to the Care of all other Things, <HI>and all these Things shall be added unto Thee.</HI></P>
<P>Let not then the busy Cares of this Life, be any hinderance to thy Care of the other; set apart this small Time, for the Time of Preparation, and look on it, as an Emblem of the whole Time of Life: Which is our Day of Preparation, for the eternal Sabbath, the everlasting Rest, the undisturbed Quiet of the other Life.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>THE religious Observation of the <HI>Saturday Afternoon</HI> is now entirely at an End I should be happy, were I able to say with Truth that the Conclusion of that of the Sunday too did not seem to be approaching.</P>
<P>Mr. Bourne uses great Affectation in translating the Quotation from Selden. He has printed the Latin erroneously too: It ought to be <Q>in <HI>lunaris diei</HI> diliculum, &amp;c.</Q> — The Sabbath was not to be observed from Saturday <HI>at Noon,</HI> but from <HI>three o'Clock</HI> on that Day in the <HI>Afternoon,</HI> and whatever Part of the Day might have been called <HI>Noon</HI> at the Time he alludes to, he might have hinted to us in a Note, without confounding it in his Text with the <HI>Mid-day</HI> of this Age.</P>
<P>To our Author's Account of the Custom of the old Churches of England and Scotland, an <HI>Alte∣ration</HI> may be added, of which he seems never to have heard. It is, that in the Year 1332, at a Provincial Council, held by Archbishop Mepham, at Magfield, after Complaint made, that instead of fasting upon the Vigils, they ran out to all the Excesses of Riot, &amp;c. it was appointed, among many other Things relative to Holy Days, <Q>that the Solemnity for Sunday should begin upon <HI>Saturday</HI> in the <HI>Evening,</HI> and not before, to prevent the Misconstruction of keeping a Judai∣cal
<PB N="154" REF="172"/>
Sabbath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Wheatly tells us, that in the <HI>East,</HI> the Church thought sit to indulge the Humour of the Judaizing Christians so far, as to observe the <HI>Saturday</HI> as a Festival Day of Devotion, and thereon to meet for the Exercise of religious Duties,—as is plain from several Passages of the Antients. Illustration of Common Prayer, p. 191.</NOTE>.</Q> See Collier's Ecclesiastic Hist. Vol. I. p. 531.</P>
<P>Our Author's Exhortation towards the Conclusion of this Chapter is, I think, liable to Misconstruction: An <HI>Inference</HI> might easily be deduced from it in favour of Idleness.—Perhaps Men, who live by manual Labour, or have Families to support by it, cannot better spend their <HI>Saturday Afternoon,</HI> than in following the several Callings, in which they have employed themselves on the preceding Days of the Week.—Industry will be no bad Preparation to the Sabbath!</P>
<P>Considered in a Political View, much Harm hath been done by that prodigal <HI>Waste</HI> of Days, very falsely called <HI>Holy Days,</HI> in the Church of Rome. They have greatly favoured the Cause of Vice and Dissipation without doing any essential Service to that of rational Religion.—Complaints seem to have been made in almost every <HI>Synod</HI> and <HI>Council,</HI> of the Licentiousness introduced by the keeping of Vigils.—Nor will the Philosopher wonder at this, for it has its Foundation in the Nature of Things<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For the Honour of human Nature, (which like the majestic Ruins of Palmyra, though prostrate in the Dust, is still respectable in its Decay) I forbear to translate the subsequent Quotation from Dr. Moresin. <Q>Et videre contigit.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the Yule-Clog and Christmas-Candle; what they may signifie; their Antiquity; the like Customs in other Places.</HEAD>
<P>IN the <HI>Primitive Church,</HI> Christmas-Day was always observ'd as the <HI>Lord's-Day</HI> was, and was in like Manner preceded by an <HI>Eve or Vigil.</HI> Hence it is that our Church hath ordered an <HI>Eve</HI> before it, which is observed by the Religious, as a Day of Preparation for that great Festival.</P>
<P>Our Fore-Fathers, when the common De∣votions of the <HI>Eve</HI> were over, and Night was come on, were wont to light up <HI>Candles</HI> of an uncommon Size, which were called <HI>Christmas-Candles,</HI> and to lay a <HI>Log</HI> of Wood upon the Fire, which they termed a <HI>Yule-Clog,</HI> or <HI>Christmas-Block.</HI> These were to Illuminate the House, and turn the Night into Day; which Custom, in some Measure, is still kept up in the Northern Parts.</P>
<P>It hath, in all probability, been derived from the <HI>Saxons.</HI> For <HI>Bede</HI> tells us, That this very Night was observed in this Land before, by the <HI>Heathen Saxons.</HI> They<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Incipiebant autem annum ab octavo calendarum <HI>Januarii</HI> die, ubi nunc natale domini celebramus; &amp; ipsam noctem nuuc nobis sacro-sanctam tunc gentili vocabulo maedrenack, i. e. matrum noctem appellabant: Ob causam, ut suspicamur, ceremoniarum, quas in ea pervigiles agebant. <HI>Beda de Rat.

<PB N="156" REF="174"/>
he, their Year on the Eight of the Calends of <HI>January,</HI> which is now our <HI>Christmas-Day:</HI> And the very Night before, which is now Holy to us, was by them called <HI>Maedrenack,</HI> or the <HI>Night of Mothers;</HI> because, as we ima∣gine, of those Ceremonies which were per∣form'd that Night. The <HI>Yule-Clog</HI> therefore hath probably been a Part of that Night's Ceremonies. The very Name seems to speak it, and tells its Original to every Age.</P>
<P>It seems to have been used, as an Emblem of the return of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the lengthening of the Days. For as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>December</HI> guili, eodem quo <HI>Januarius</HI> nomine vocatur. —Guili a conversione solis in auctum diei, nomen accipit. <HI>Beda, ibid.</HI></NOTE> both <HI>December</HI> and <HI>Ja∣nuary</HI> were called <HI>Guili or</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Gehol</HI> or <HI>Geol</HI> Angl Sax. Jol vel Jul, Dan. Sax. <Q>And to this Day in the North <HI>Yule, Youle,</HI> signifies the solemn Festival of <HI>Christmas,</HI> and were Words used to denote a Time of Festivity very anciently, and before the Introduc∣tion of Christianity among the Northern Nations. Learn∣ed Men have disputed much about this Word, some deriving it from <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> others from the Word <HI>Gehthe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l,</HI> a <HI>Wheel,</HI> as <HI>Bede,</HI> who would therefore have it so called, because of the Return of the Sun's annual Course, after the Winter Solitice. But he, writing <HI>de Rat. Temp.</HI> speaks rather as an Astronomer than an An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ry. The best Antiquaries derive it from the Word, <HI>Ol, Ale,</HI> which was much used in their Festivities and merry Meetings. And the <HI>I in Iol, iul cimbr. as the Ge and Gi in Gehol, Geol, Giul, Sax,</HI> are premised only as Intensives to add a little to the Signification, and make it more emphatical. <HI>Ol</HI> or <HI>Ale,</HI> as has been observed, did not only signifie the Liquor they made Use of, but gave Denomination likewise to their greatest Festivals, as that of Gehol or Yule at <HI>Midwinter;</HI> and as is yet plainly to be discern'd in that Custom of the <HI>Whitsan-Ale,</HI> at the other great Festival. <HI>Elstob. Sax. Hom. Birth. Day-Greg. Append P.</HI> 29.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Bishop</HI> Stillingfleet <HI>has also taken Notice of this, and says,</HI> <Q>That some think the Name of this Feast was taken from <HI>Iola,</HI> which in the <HI>Gothick</HI> Language signifies to <HI>make merry.</HI> But he seems not inclinable to this Opinion, and therefore tells us, that <HI>Olaus Rudbeck</HI> thinks the former (<HI>viz.</HI> Its being called so from the Joy that was conceived at the Return of the Sun) more proper, not only from <HI>Bede</HI>'s Authority, but because in the old <HI>Runick Fasti,</HI> a Wheel was used to denote that Festival. <BIBL><HI>Stilling. Orig. Britain.</HI></BIBL></Q></P></NOTE> <HI>Yule,</HI> upon Ac∣count
<PB N="157" REF="175"/>
of the Sun's Returning, and the In∣crease of the Days; so, I am apt to believe, the Log has had the Name of the <HI>Yule-Log,</HI> from its being burnt as an Emblem of the returning Sun, and the Increase of its Light and Heat.</P>
<P>This was probably the Reason of the Cu∣stom among the <HI>Heathen Saxons;</HI> but I can∣not think the Observation of it was continued for the same Reason, after Christianity was embraced. For Bishop <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> observes in his <HI>Origines Britanicae,</HI> <Q>That though the ancient <HI>Saxons</HI> observed Twelve Days at that Time, and sacrificed to the Sun, in
<PB N="158" REF="176"/>
hopes of his Returning; yet when Chris∣tianity prevailed, all these Idolatrous Sa∣crifices were laid aside, and that Time of Feasting was joined with the religious So∣lemnity of that Season, which in other Parts of the World were observed by Christians.</Q> And in like Manner as these Days of Feasting were joined with the reli∣gious Solemnities of that Season, so the keep∣ing up of this Custom, seems to have been done with another View, than it was ori∣ginally. If a Conjecture may be allowed, it might have been done on Account of our Saviour's Birth, which happened that Night. For as the Burning of it before Christianity, was an Emblem of the Coming of the Sun, which they worshipped as their God; so the continuing it after, might have been for a Symbol of that Light, which was that Night born into the World: <HI>The Light that shineth in Darkness; the Light that lightned the</HI> Gen∣tiles, <HI>that turn'd them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed it will be some strengthening of the Conjecture, that Light has been the Emblem of several Things, both in Scripture, and in the ancient Church: For the Scripture makes use of it, and the Church in Imitation of the Scripture, as a lively Reresentation of several Things. Thus Light is the Emblem of
<PB N="159" REF="177"/>
<HI>GOD: For GOD is Light,</HI> says the Apostle St. <HI>John.</HI> John <HI>the Baptist was a Burning and a Shining Light.</HI> And therefore in some Places it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Feruntur quoque brandae seu faces ardentes, &amp; fiunt ig∣nes, qui significant sanctum <HI>Joannem,</HI> qui fuit lumen &amp; lucerna ardens, &amp; praecedens &amp; praecursor verae lucis, quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum. <HI>Durand.

<PB N="160" REF="178"/>
into the World. What<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quid est quod apparenti angelo divinae quoque claritatis splendor eos circumdedit, quod nunquam in tota testamenti veteris serie &amp; reperimus, cum tam innumeris vicibus angeli prophetis &amp; justis apparuerunt, nusquam eos fulgore divinae lucis homines circumdedisse legimus; nisi quod hoc privilegi∣um recte hujus temporis dignitati servatum est? &amp;c. <HI>Bed. Hyem. de Sanct. in Gal. Cant.</HI></NOTE> can be the meaning, says <HI>venerable Bede,</HI> that this Apparition of Angels was surrounded with that heavenly Light, which is a Thing we never meet with in all the Old Testament? For tho' Angels have appeared to Prophets and holy Men, yet we never read of their Appearing in such Glory and Splendor before. It must surely be, because this Privilege was reserved for the Dignity of this Time. For when the true Light of the World, was born in the World, it was very proper that the Proclaimer of his Nativity, should appear in the Eyes of Men, in such an heavenly Light, as was before un∣seen in the World. And that <HI>supernatural Star,</HI> which was the Guide of the <HI>Eastern Magi,</HI> was a Figure of that <HI>Star,</HI> which was risen out of <HI>Jacob; of that Light which should lighten the</HI> Gentiles. <Q>GOD, says Bishop <HI>Taylor,</HI> sent a miraculous Star, to invite and lead them to a new and more glorious Light, the Light of Grace and Glory,</Q></P>
<P>In Imitation of this, as <HI>Gregory</HI> tells us, the Church went on with the Ceremony: And
<PB N="161" REF="179"/>
hence it was, that for the three or four First <HI>Centuries,</HI> the whole <HI>Eastern Church,</HI> called the Day, which they observed for our Savi∣our's Nativity, the <HI>Epiphany</HI> or Manifestation of the Light. And <HI>Cassian</HI> tells ut,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Intra <HI>Egypti</HI> Regionem mos iste traditione antiqua serva∣tur, ut peracto epiphaniorum die, &amp;c. <HI>Cassian, Coll.</HI> 10. <HI>C.</HI> 20.</NOTE> That it was a Custom in <HI>Egypt,</HI> handed down by Tradition, as soon as the <HI>Epiphany,</HI> or <HI>Day of Light</HI> was over, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence also came that ancient Custom of the same Church, taken Notice of by St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> of<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Absque martyrum reliquiis per totas orientis ecclesias, quum legendum est evangelium, accenduntur luminaria jam sole rutilante, non utique ad fugandas tenebras, sed ad signum laetitiae demonstrandum, &amp;c. <HI>Jerom, Cont. Vigil Cap.</HI> 2.</NOTE> lighting up Candles at the Reading of the Gospel, even at Noon-Day; and that, not to drive away the Darkness, but to speak their Joy for the good Tidings of the Gospel, and be an Emblem of that Light, which the Psalmist says, <HI>was a Lamp unto his Feet, and a Light unto his Paths.</HI></P>
<P>Light therefore having been an Emblem of so many Things, and particularly of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, both in the sacred History, and in the Practice of the Church; it is no way improbable, that after their Con∣version, the <HI>Saxons</HI> used it as an Emblem of him, who that Night came into the World,
<PB N="162" REF="180"/>
and was the Light thereof. In the City of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> on the <HI>Eve of Easter,</HI> there was a Custom practised, much like this of ours on <HI>Christmas-Eve.</HI> For then the whole City was illuminated with Tapers and Torches, which continued all the Night, turning the Night into Day, till almost the Day appeared. The Reason of this Custom, was to represent that Light which the next Day arose upon the World.

<P>Il ne faudroit donc pas être étonné si notre Mois de <HI>Juillet</HI> qui suit le Solstice d'Eté, eût pris son nom de là. Les Romains nous disent, il est vrai, que ce Mois tira son Nom de Jules César; ce pouroit être une Etymologie digne des Flatteries dont ils accabloient leurs Empereurs, tandis qu'ils n'auroient fait qu'altérer la Pronunciation du mot <HI>Iul</HI> pour le faire quadrer avec le Nom de <HI>Jules,</HI> qu'ils pro∣nonçoient <HI>Iulus,</HI> Nom que porta aussi Ascagne, Fils d'Aenée, &amp; qui remontoit par là même aux Langues premieres de'l'Orient.</P>

<P>Stiernhielm, skilled in the Languages and Anti∣quities of the North, informs us, that the antient Inhabitants of Sweden celebrated a Feast which they called <HI>Iul,</HI> in the Winter <HI>Solstice,</HI> or <HI>Christmass;</HI> that this Word means <HI>Revolution, Wheel;</HI> that the Month of December is called <HI>Iul-Month,</HI> the Month of <HI>Return,</HI> and that the Word is written both <HI>Hiule</HI> and <HI>Giule.</HI></P>

<P>We must not be surprized then if our Month of <HI>July,</HI> which follows the Summer Solstice, has had its Name from hence.

<P>The Case had been the same with the Month following.</P>
<P>If these two Months were fixed on to bear the Names of their first and second Emperors, it was
<PB N="171" REF="189"/>
principally because their Names already resembled those of Julius and Augustus.</P>
<P>They did it also in Imitation of the Egyptians, who had given to these two Months the Names of their two first Kings, <HI>Mesor</HI> and <HI>Thot.</HI></P>
<P>As the Month of August was the first in the Egyptian Year, the first Day of it was called <HI>Gule,</HI> which being latinized makes <HI>Gula.</HI> Our Legenda∣ries, surprized at seeing this Word at the Head of the Month of August, did not overlook but con∣verted it to their own Purpose▪ They made out of it the Feast of the Daughter of the Tribune Quirinus, cured of some Disorder in her Throat (Gula is Latin for Throat) by kissing the <HI>Chains</HI> of St. Peter, whose Feast is solemnized on this Day.</P>

<P>There is an Essay in the Gentlemen's Magazine, 1765, in which it is conjectured that the antient Custom of dressing Churches and Houses at Christmass with <HI>Laurel, Box, Holly,</HI> or <HI>Ivy,</HI> was in <HI>Allusion</HI> to many <HI>figurative Expressions</HI> in the Prophets, relative to Christ, <HI>the Branch of Righteousness,</HI> &amp;c. or that it was in Re∣membrance of the <HI>Oratory</HI> of <HI>wrythen Wands,</HI> or <HI>Boughs,</HI> which was the first Christian Church erected in Britain: Before we can admit either of these Hypotheses, the Question must be deter∣mined whether or no this Custom was not <HI>prier</HI> to the Introduc∣tion of the Christian Faith amongst us.</P>
<P>The learned Dr. Chandler tells us. <Q>It is related where Druidism prevailed, the <HI>Houses</HI> were <HI>decked</HI> with <HI>Ever-greens</HI> in <HI>Decem∣ber,</HI> that the Sylvan Spirits might repair to them, and remain unnipped with Frost and cold Winds, until a milder Season had <HI>renewed</HI> the foliage of their darling Abodes.</Q></P>

Then with their <HI>drawn</HI> Swords held erect as before: Afterwards extending them from Hand to Hand, they lay hold of each other's Hilt and Point, while they are wheeling more moderately round, and changing their Order, throw themselves into the Figure of a <HI>Hexagon,</HI> which they call a Rose.—But presently raising and drawing back their Swords, they undo that Figure, to form (with them) a four-square Rose, that may rebound over the Head of each. At last they dance rapidly backwards, and vehemently rattling the Sides of their Swords together, con∣clude the Sport. Pipes, or Songs (sometimes both) direct the Measure, which at first is slow, but increasing afterwards, becomes a very quick one, towards the Conclusion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Of the Christmas Carol, an ancient Custom: The common Observation of it very unbecoming.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as the Morning of the <HI>Nativity</HI> appears, it is customary among the common People to sing a <HI>Christmas-Carol,</HI> which is a Song upon the Birth of our Savi∣our, and generally sung with some<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such are, <HI>The New-Year's Songs,</HI> and that whose Bur∣den is <HI>Hagmena.</HI> The Word <HI>Hagmena</HI> is the same as <HI>Hagia∣meene,</HI> or the <HI>Holy Month. Angli,</HI> says <HI>Hospinnian, Haleg∣monath, quasi sacrum mensem vocant.</HI> Hosp. de Orig. Eth. P. <HI>81.</HI></NOTE> others, from the Nativity to the Twelveth-Day, the Continuance of <HI>Christmas.</HI> It comes, they say, from <HI>Cantare,</HI> to sing, and <HI>Rola,</HI> which is an Interjection of Joy: For in ancient Times, the Burden of the Song, when Men were Merry, was <HI>Rola, Rola.</HI></P>
<P>This kind of Songs is of an ancient stand∣ing: They were sung early in the Church it self, in memory of the Nativity, as the many HYMNS for that Season manifestly declare: <HI>Tertullian</HI> says,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ut quisque de scripturis sanctis vel de proprio ingenio potest, provocatur in medium Deo cantare. <HI>Tertul. Advers. Gent. C.</HI> 39.</NOTE> it was customary among the Christians, at their Feasts, to bring those, who were able to sing, into the Midst, and
<PB N="182" REF="200"/>
make them sing a Song unto <HI>GOD;</HI> either out of the Holy Scripture, or of their own Com∣posing and Invention. And as this was done at their Feasts, so no doubt it was observed at the great Feast of the Nativity; which Song, no Question of it, was to them, what the <HI>Christmas-Carol</HI> should be to us. In after Ages we have it also taken Notice of: For <HI>Durand</HI> tells us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In quibusdam quoque locis.—In natali Praelati cum suis clericis ludant, vel in domibus episcopalibus: Ita ut etiam descendant.—Ad cantus. <HI>Durand. Rat. Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>C.</HI> 86. <HI>S.</HI> 9.</NOTE> That on the Day of the <HI>Nativity,</HI> it was usual for the Bishops of some Churches to sing among their Clergy, in the Episcopal House, which Song was undoubt∣ed a <HI>Christmas-Carol.</HI></P>
<P>The Reason of this Custom seems to be an Imitation of the <HI>Gloria in Excelsis,</HI> or <HI>Glory be to GOD on High,</HI> &amp;c. which was sung by the Angels, as they hovered o'er the Fields of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> in the Morning of the Nativity. For even that Song, as the learned Bishop <HI>Taylor</HI> observes, was a Christmas-Carol. <HI>As soon,</HI> says he, <HI>as these blessed Choristers had sung their Christmas Carol, and taught the Church a Hymn, to put into her Offices for Ever, in the Anniversary of this Festivity; the Angels,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Was this performed with that Reverence and Decency, which are due to a Song of this Nature, in Honour of the Nativity, and Glory
<PB N="183" REF="201"/>
to our LORD, it would be very commend∣able; but to sing it, as is generally done, in the midst of <HI>Rioting and Chambering, and Wan∣toness,</HI> is no Honour, but Disgrace; no Glory, but an Affront to that Holy Season, a Scan∣dal to Religion, and a Sin against CHRIST.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Of New-Year's-Day's Ceremonies. The New-Year's-Gift an harmless Custom: wishing a good New-Year, no Way sinful. Mumming, a Custom which ought to be laid aside.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Vulgar are always very careful to End the <HI>old Year</HI> well, so they are also careful of Beginning well the <HI>new one:</HI> As they End the Former with a hearty Compota∣tion, so they begin the Latter with the Sending of Presents, which are termed New-Year's.

<PB N="188" REF="206"/>
Feast, just as <HI>Buchannan</HI> sets out the <HI>British Saturnalia,</HI> by Feasting and sending Presents, or New-Year's Gifts, one to another.</Q></P>
<P>The Poet <HI>Naogeorgus</HI> says,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Jani—Calendis,</L>
<L>Atque etiam strenae charis mittuntur amicis:</L>
<L>Conjugibus{que} viri donant, gnatis{que} parentes,</L>
<L>Et domini famulis, &amp;c.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Hosp. de Orig. Fest. Christ. P.</HI> 41.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> That it was usual at that Time, for Friends to present each other with a New-Year's Gift; for the Husband, the Wife; the Parents, their Chil∣dren; and Master's, their Servants; which, as<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hospin.</HI> ibid.</NOTE> <HI>Hospinian</HI> tells us, was an ancient Custom of the Heathens, and afterwards practis'd by the Christians.</P>
<P>And no doubt, those Christians were high∣ly worthy of Censure, who imagined, as the Heathens did, that the sending of a Present then, was any way <HI>Lucky,</HI> and an <HI>Omen</HI> of the Success of the following Year. For this was the very Thing that made both several Holy Men, and some general Councils, take notice of, and forbid any such Custom; be∣cause the Observance of it, out of any such Design and View, was Superstitious and Sin∣ful. We are told, in a Place of St. <HI>Austin,</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="207" MS="y"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Citatur locus ex <HI>Augustino,</HI> in quo praecipitur, ne obser∣ventur calendae <HI>Januarii,</HI> in quibus cantilenae quaedam, &amp; commessationes, &amp; ad invicem dona donentur, quasi in prin∣cipio anni, boni sati augurio. <HI>Hosp. de Orig. Fest. Christ. in Fest. Jan.</HI></NOTE> the Observation of the Calends of <HI>January</HI> is forbid, the Songs which were wont to be sung on that Day, the Feastings, and the Presents which were then sent as a Token and Omen of a good Year. But to send a Present at that Time, out of Esteem, or Gratitude, or Charity, is no where forbid: On the Con∣trary, it is Praise worthy. For tho' the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In calendas <HI>Januarias</HI> antiqui patres vehementius inve∣hebantur, non propter istas missitationes adinvicem, &amp; mutui amoris pignora, sed propter diem idolis dicatum: Propter ritus quosdam profanos, &amp; sacrilegos in illa solennitate adhi∣bitos. <HI>Mountacut. Orig. Eccles. Pars Prior. P.</HI> 128.</NOTE> ancient Fathers did vehemently invey a∣gainst the Observation of the Calends of <HI>Ja∣nuary;</HI> yet it was not because of those Presents, and Tokens of mutual Affection and Love that passed; but because the Day it self was dedicated to Idols, and because of some pro∣phane Rites and Ceremonies they observed in solemnizing it. If then I send a New-Year's Gift to my Friend, it shall be a Token of my Friendship; if to my Benefactor, a Token of my Gratitude; if to the <HI>Poor,</HI> (which at this Time must never be forgot) it shall be to make their Hearts sing for Joy, and give
<PB N="190" REF="208"/>
Praise and Adoration to <HI>the Giver of all good Gifts.</HI></P>
<P>Another old Custom at this Time, is the wishing of a <HI>good New-Year,</HI> either when a New-Year's Gift is presented, or when Friends meet, or when a New-Year's Song is sung at the Door; the Burden of which is, <HI>we wish you a happy New-Year.</HI></P>
<P>This is also a Custom among the Modern <HI>Jews,</HI> who on the first Day of the Month<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The Month <HI>Tisri,</HI> was the seventh Month according to the <HI>Jews</HI> sacred Computation, and therefore it is commanded to be celebrated the first Day of the seventh Month, <HI>Lev. xxiii. 24.</HI> But according to their civil Computation, it was their first Month; so that Feast may be termed their New-Year's Day.</Q></P>
<BIBL><HI>Goodw. Antiq. Lib. 3. Cap. 7.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>
<HI>Tisri,</HI> have a splended<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Reperiunt mensam dulcissimis cibis instructam: Ei cum assederint, quivis partem de cibis illis sumit, &amp; annus, inquit, bonus &amp; dulcis sit nobis omnibus. <HI>Hosp. de Fest. Orig. P.</HI> 54.</NOTE> Entertainment, and wish each other a happy New-Year.</P>
<P>Now the Original of this Custom is Hea∣thenish, as appears by the Feasting and Pre∣sents before mentioned, which were a wish for a good Year. And it was customary a∣mong the Heathens on the Calends of <HI>Janu∣ary,</HI> to go about and sing a <HI>New-Year's Song. Hospinian</HI> therefore tells us, That<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Discurrunt namque noctu, tam senes quam juvenes pro∣miscui sexus, cautantes prae foribus divitum, quibus faelicem annum cantando precantur &amp; optant. <HI>Hospin. de Orig. Fest. Jan.</HI></NOTE> when
<PB N="191" REF="209"/>
Night comes on, not only the Young, but also the Old of both Sexes, run about here and there, and sing a Song at the Doors of the wealthier People, in which they wish them a <HI>happy New-Year.</HI> This he speaks in∣deed of the Christians, but he calls it an exact Copy of the Heathens Custom.</P>
<P>But however I cannot see the Harm of re∣taining this ancient Ceremony, so it be not used superstitiously, nor attended with Obsce∣nity and Lewdness. For then there will be no more in it, than an hearty Wish for each others Welfare and Prosperity; no more Harm, than wishing a good Day, or good Night; than in bidding one <HI>GOD speed;</HI> or than in wishing to our Friend, what <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Servant did to himself, <HI>O</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxiv. 12.</NOTE> <HI>LORD GOD of my Master</HI> Abraham, <HI>I pray thee send me good speed this Day.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Custom observed at this Time, which is called among us <HI>Mumming;</HI> which is a changing of Clothes between Men and Women; who when dress'd in each others Habits, go from one Neighbour's House to another, and partake of their <HI>Christ∣mas-Cheer,</HI> and make merry with them in Disguise, by dancing and singing, and such like Merriments.</P>

As to the Manner of the Solemnity, besides the Sacri∣fices and other Parts of publick Worship, there were several lesser Observations worth our Notice.

'Tis probable this was done in Memory of the Liberty enjoy'd in the <HI>Golden Age,</HI> under <HI>Sa∣turn,</HI> before the Names of Servant and Master were known to the World. Besides this they sent Presents to one another, among Friends. No War was to be proclaim'd, and no Offen∣der executed. The Schools kept a Vacation, and nothing but Mirth and Freedom was to be met with in the City. They kept at first only one Day, the Fourteenth of the Kalends of <HI>Ja∣nuary;</HI> but the Number was afterwards increas'd to three, four, five, and some say seven Days</Q>.</P>

<P>This Kind of Custom received a deserved Blow from the Church, and was taken Notice of in the Synod<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Can.

<PB N="193" REF="211"/>
the Faithful should no longer observe them: That the public Dancings of Women should cease, as being the Occasion of much Harm and Ruin, and as being invented and observed in honour of their Gods, and therefore quite averse to the Christian Life. They therefore decreed, that no Man should be cloathed with a Woman's Garment, no Woman with a Man's.</P>
<P>It were to be wish'd, this Custom, which is still so common among us at this Season of the Year, was laid aside; as it is the Occasion of much<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoc autem, quum noctu fiat, nemini dubium esse debet, quin sub hoc praetextu, multa obscaena &amp; turpia perpetrantur simul. <HI>Hosp. de Orig.

<P>Then the Mummers set to the Prince three Jewels, one after another; which were, a Boule of Gold, a Cup of Gold, and a Ring of Gold, which the Prince <HI>wanne</HI> at three Casts. Then they set to the Princes Mother, the Duke, the Earles and other Lords, to every one a Ring of Gold, which they did also win.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI> Of the Twelfth Day; how observed: The Wick∣edness of observing the Twelve Days after the common Way.</HEAD>
<P>ON the <HI>Epiphany,</HI> or <HI>Manifestation of</HI> Christ <HI>to the</HI> Gentiles, commonly called the Twelfth-Day, the <HI>Eastern Magi</HI> were guided by the Star, to pay their Homage to their Sa∣viour; and because they came that Day, which is the Twelfth after the Day of the Nativity, it is therefore called the <HI>Twelfth-Day.</HI></P>
<P>The Twelfth-Day it self is one of the great∣est of the Twelve, and of more jovial Obser∣vation than the others, for the visiting of Friends and Christmas-Gambols. The Rites of this Day are different in divers Places, tho' the End of them is much the same in all; namely, to do Honour to the Memory of the <HI>Eastern Magi,</HI> whom they suppose to have been Kings. In<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Gallia</HI> unus ex ministris, &amp;c.—Idem in <HI>Germania,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Hospin. in Epiphan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>France,</HI> one of the Courtiers is chosen King, whom the King himself, and the other Nobles, attend at an Entertainment. In <HI>Germany,</HI> they observe the same Thing on this Day in Academies and Cities, where the Students and Citizens create one of themselves <HI>King,</HI> and provide a Magni∣ficent
<PB N="200" REF="218"/>
Banquet for him, and give him the At∣tendance of a <HI>King,</HI> or a <HI>stranger Guest.</HI> Now this is answerable to that Custom of the <HI>Sa∣turnalia,</HI> of <HI>Masters</HI> making <HI>Banquets</HI> for their <HI>Servants,</HI> and waiting on them; and no doubt this Custom has in Part sprung from that.</P>
<P>Not many Years ago, this was a common <HI>Christmas Gambol</HI> in both our <HI>Universities;</HI> and it is still usual in other Places of our Land, to give the Name of <HI>King</HI> or <HI>Queen</HI> to that Person, whose extraordinary Luck hits upon that Part of the divided <HI>Cake,</HI> which is honour'd above the others, with a <HI>Bean</HI> in it.</P>
<P>But tho' this be generally the greatest of the Twelve, yet the others preceding are observed with Mirth and Jollity, generally to Excess. Was this Feasting confined within the Bounds of Decency and Moderation, and gave more Way than it does to the Exercises and the Re∣ligious Duties of the Season, it would have nothing in it immoral or sinful. The keeping up of Friendship, and Love, and old Acquain∣tance, has nothing in it harmful; but the Misfortune is, Men upon that Bottom, act ra∣ther like Brutes than Men, and like Heathens than Christians; and the Preservation of Friendship and Love, is nothing else but a Pretence for Drunkenness, and Rioting, and Wantonness. And such I am afraid hath been the Observation of the Christmas Holy-days,
<PB N="201" REF="219"/>
since the holiest Times of the Christian Church; and the Generality of Men have rather look'd upon them, as a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Bishop <HI>Blackall</HI>'s Sermon on the Lawfulness and the right Manner of keeping Christmas and other Christian Festivals.</NOTE> Time of Eating and Drink∣ing, and Playing, than of returning Praises and Thanksgivings to GOD, for the greatest Benefit he ever bestow'd upon the Sons of Men.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory Nazianzen,</HI> in that excellent Oration of his upon Christmas-Day, says, Let us not celebrate the Feast after an Earthly, but an Heavenly Manner; let not our Doors be crown'd; let not Dancing be encourag'd; let not the Cross-paths be adorned, the Eyes fed, nor the Ears delighted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Let us not Feast to excess, nor be Drunk with Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From this we may clearly see, what has been the Custom in these Days. And in all Probability it has been much the same among us, from the Beginning of Christianity: However fabulous that Story may be, taken Notice of by<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Origin. Britan.

For if it was added, it would make thirteen Days, which are the thirteen Days here mentioned.

For in the Laws of <HI>Canutus,</HI> it is order'd,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Atque ab ipso natali Jesu Christi die ad octavam ad Epi∣phania lucem, jejunia nemo observato, nisi quidam judicio ac voluntate fecerit sua, aut id ei fuerit a sacerdote imperatum. <HI>Seld.

and that such Jollity and Feasting then, had its Original from him.</Q> But however these Words, if true, may be a Testimony of the too great Antiquity of the Abuse of this Festival; yet they will by no Means justifie <HI>Buchannan</HI>'s Comment upon them. For as the learned Bishop goes on, <Q><HI>Buchannan</HI> is so well pleased with this notable Observation, that He sets it down for good History, saying upon it, that the old <HI>Saturnalia</HI> were re∣new'd, only the Days increased, and <HI>Sa∣turn</HI>'s Name chang'd to <HI>Caesar</HI>'s: For says he, we call the Feast <HI>Julia.</HI> But why should the Name of <HI>Saturn</HI> be changed into <HI>Caesar</HI>'s? Was he worshipped for a GOD among the <HI>British</HI> Christians, as <HI>Saturn</HI> was among the old <HI>Pagans?</HI> But the Name <HI>Julia</HI> imports it; by no Means.

<P><PB N="203" REF="221"/><HI>Buchannan</HI> seems therefore to have a great deal more Malice than Truth on his Side. But however such Revellings, and Frolicks, and Extravagances, whether or not derived from the old <HI>Saturnalia,</HI> as are customary at this Season, do come very near to, if not ex∣ceed its Liberties. In particular, what com∣moner at this Season, than <HI>for Men to rise early in the Morning, that they may follow strong Drink, and continue untill Night, till Wine inflame them?

was to Women then, what the <HI>Month</HI> is to Women now. And as during that Time, the Friends and Relations of the Women, pay them Visits, and do them Abundance of Honour; so this Time seems to have been calculated, to do Honour to the Virgin's Lying-in.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Day; The Observation of the Weather, a Custom of the Heathens, and hand∣ed down by the Monks: The Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> himself is against such Observations; The Opinion of St. <HI>Austin</HI> upon them.</HEAD>
<P>THE Observation of the Weather which is made on this Day is altogether ridi∣culous and superstitious. If it happen to be unclouded and without Rain, it is look'd upon as an Omen of the following Year's Success, if otherwise, that the Year will be unfortunate. Thus the old Verse.
<Q><L>Clara dies <HI>Pauli,</HI> bona tempora denotat anni,</L>
<L>Si fuerint venti, denarrant praelia genti,</L>
<L>Si nix aut pluviae, pereunt animalia quaeque.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Interprepation of which is very well known to be this,
<Q><L>If St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Day be fair and clear,</L>
<L>It doth betide a happy Year;</L>
<L>If blustering Winds do blow aloft</L>
<L>Then Wars will trouble our Realm full oft.</L>
<L>And if it chance to Snow or Rain,</L>
<L>Then will be dear all Sorts of Grain.</L></Q></P>
<P>Such also is the Observation of St. <HI>Swithin</HI>'s Day, which if rainy is a Token that it will rain for forty Days successively; such is the
<PB N="209" REF="227"/>
Observation of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Si sol splendescat <HI>Maria</HI> purificante,</L>
<L>Major erit glacies post festum quam fuit ante.</L></Q></NOTE> <HI>Candlemas-Day,</HI> such is <HI>Childermas-Day,</HI> such <HI>Valentine's-Day,</HI> and some others.</P>
<P>How St. <HI>Paul's Day</HI> came to have this particular Knack of foretelling the good or evil Fortune of the following Year, is no easy Matter to find out. The Monks who were undoubtedly the first who made this wonderful Observation, have taken Care it should be handed down to Posterity, but why and for what Reason this Observation was to stand good, they have taken Care to conceal. In Church Affairs indeed they make free with handing down <HI>Traditions</HI> from Generation to Generation, which being approved by an in∣fallible Judgment, are to be taken for grant∣ed; but as far as I hear, they never pretended to an infallible Spirit, in the Study of the Planets. One may therefore, without the Suspicion of Heresy, or fear of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> make a little Inquiry into this Affair, and see whether it be true or false, whether it is built upon any Reason or no Reason, whether still to be observed, or only laugh'd at as a Monkish Dream.</P>
<P>Now as it is the Day of that Saint, <HI>the great Apostle St.</HI> Paul, I cannot see there is any Thing to be built upon. He did indeed <HI>labour
<PB N="210" REF="228"/>
more abundantly than all the Apostles;</HI> but never, that I heard, in the Science of Astro∣logy. And why his Day should therefore be a standing <HI>Almanack</HI> to the World, rather than the Day of any other <HI>Saint,</HI> will be pretty hard to find out. I am sure there is a good Number of them, have as much Right to Rain or fair Weather as St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and if St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> &amp;c. have not as much Right to Wind or Snow, let the Reader judge.</P>
<P>As it is the Twenty fifth Day of <HI>January,</HI> one would think that could be no Reason. For what is that Day more than another? In∣deed they do give some Shew of Reason, why Rain should happen about the Time of St. <HI>Swithin,</HI> which is this. About the Time of his Feast, which is on the Fourteenth of <HI>July,</HI> there are two rainy <HI>Constellations,</HI> which are called <HI>Praecepe</HI> and <HI>Asellus,</HI> which arise <HI>cosmically,</HI> and generally produce Rain. And to be sure in the Course of the Sign <HI>Aquarius,</HI> there may be both Rain and Wind and fair Weather, but how these can foretell the Des∣tiny of the Year, is the Question.</P>
<P>As then there is nothing in the <HI>Saint,</HI> or his Day to prognosticate any such Thing, I mean, as it is the Day of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> or the Twenty fifth of <HI>January,</HI> so I must confess I cannot find out what may be the Ground of
<PB N="211" REF="229"/>
this particular Observation. But however thus much is very obvious, that this Obser∣vation is an exact Copy of that superstitious Custom among the Heathens, of observing one Day as good, and another as bad. For among them were lucky and unlucky Days; some were <HI>dies atri,</HI> and some <HI>dies albi;</HI> the <HI>atri</HI> were pointed out in their <HI>Calendar,</HI> with a black Character, the <HI>albi</HI> with a white; the former to denote it a Day of bad Success, the latter a Day of good. Thus have the <HI>Monks</HI> in the dark and unlearned Ages of Popery copy'd after the Heathens, and dream'd them∣selves into the like Superstitions, esteeming one Day more successful than another; and so according to them, it is very unlucky to begin any Work upon <HI>Childermass-Day;</HI> and what Day soever that falls on, whether on a <HI>Munday, Tuesday,</HI> or any other, nothing must be begun on that Day through the Year; St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Day is the Year's <HI>Fortune-Teller,</HI> St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Day is the Prognosticator of your Life and Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so instead of persuading the People to lay aside the Whims and Fan∣cies of the Heathen World, they brought them so effectually in, that they are still reigning in many Places to this Day.</P>
<P>But of all the Days of the Year, they could not have chosen one so little to the Purpose. For the very Saint, whose Day is so observed,
<PB N="212" REF="230"/>
has himself cautioned them against any such Observation: For in the Fourth Chapter of his Epistle to the <HI>Galations,</HI> he tells them, how dangerous it was <HI>to observe Days, and Months, and Times, and Years;</HI> which is not, as some would persuade us, to Caution us against the Observation of any Day but the <HI>Lord's-Day;</HI> but only that we should not ob∣serve the abolished Feasts of the <HI>Jews,</HI> nor the abominable Feasts of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> nor their superstitious Observation of fortunate and unfortunate Days. St. <HI>Austin,</HI> upon this Place, hath these Words,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Non itaque dies observemus, &amp; annos &amp; menses, &amp; tem∣pora, ne audiamus ab apostolo, timeo vos, ne forte sine causa laboraverim in vobis. Eos enim culpat, qui dicunt, non profisiscar, quia posterus est, aut quia luna sic fertur, vel profisiscar, ut prospera cedant, quia ita se habet positio siderum, &amp;c. <HI>Beda ex Augustin. in loc.</HI></NOTE> Let us not observe Years, and Months, and Times, least we hear the Apostle telling us, I am afraid of you, least I have shewn on you labour in Vain. For the Persons he blames, are those who say, I will not set forward on my Journey, because it is the next Day after such a Time, or because the Moon is so; or I'll set forward that I may have Luck, because such is just now the Position of the Stars. I will not Traffick this Month, because such a Star presides, or I will, because it does. I shall plant no Vines this Year, because it is Leap-Year, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

others, a Quotation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bingham, <HI>16</HI> L. C. <HI>5.</HI> Antiq. Eccl. P. <HI>300.</HI> Aust. de Doct. Christ. L. <HI>2.</HI> C. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE> from the same St. <HI>Austin</HI> on these superstitious Observations, with which I shall conclude this Chapter. <Q>To this kind, says he, belong all Ligatures and Remedies, which the Schools of Physi∣cians reject and condemn; whether in In∣chantments, or in certain Marks, which they call Characters, or in some other Things which are to be hanged and bound about the Body, and kept in a dancing Posture; not for any Temperament of the Body, but for certain Significations, either Ocult, or Manifest: Which by a gentler Name, they call Physical, that they may not seem to affright Men with the Appearance of Super∣stition, but do good in a natural Way: Such are Ear-rings hanged upon the Tip of each Ear, and Rings made of an Ostriches Bones for the Finger; or when you are told in a Fit of Convulsions, or Shortness of Breath, to hold your left Thumb with your right Hand. To which may be added a thousand vain Observations, as, if any of our Members beat; if when two Friends are talking together, a Stone, or a Dog, or a Child, happens to come between them, they tread the Stone to Pieces, as the Divi∣der of their Friendship, and this is toller∣able
<PB N="214" REF="232"/>
in Comparison of beating an innocent Child that comes between them. But it is more pleasant, that sometimes the Childrens Quarrel is revenged by the Dogs; for ma∣ny Times they are so superstitious, as to dare to beat the Dog that comes between them, who turning again upon him that smites him, sends him from seeking a vain Remedy, to seek a real Physician indeed. Hence proceed likewise these other Super∣stitions: For a Man to tread upon his Thre∣shold when he passes by his own House, to return back to Bed again, if he chance to sneeze as he is putting on his Shoes; to return into his House, if he stumble at his Going out; if the Rats knaw his Cloths, to be more terrified with the Suspicion of some future Evil, then concerned for the present Loss. He says, <HI>Cato</HI> gave a wise and smart Answer to such an one, who came in some Consternation to consult him, about the Rats having knawed his Stock∣ings; that, said he, is no great Wonder, but it would have been a Wonder indeed, if the Stockings had knawed the Rats. St. <HI>Austin</HI> mentions this witty Answer of a wise Heathen, to convince Christians the better of the Unreasonableness and Vanity of all such superstitious Observations. And he concludes, that all such Arts, whether
<PB N="215" REF="233"/>
of triffling or more noxious Superstition, are to be rejected and avoided by Christians, as proceeding originally from some pernicious Society between Men and Devils, and being the Compacts and Agreements of such treach∣erous and deceitful Friendship. The Apostle forbids us to have Fellowship with Devils; and that, he says, respects not only Idols, and Things offered to Idols, but all imagi∣nary Signs pertaining to the Worship of Idols, and also all Remedies, and other Ob∣servations, which are not appointed publick∣ly by GOD to promote the Love of GOD and our Neighbour, but proceed from the private Fancies of Men, and tend to delude the Hearts of Poor deluded Mortals. For these Things have no natural Virtue in them, but owe all their Efficacy to a presumptuous Confederacy with Devils: And they are full of pestiferous Curiosity, tormenting Anxi∣ety, and deadly Slavery. They were first taken up, not for any real Power to be dis∣cerned in them, but gained their Power by Mens observing them. And therefore by the Devil's Art they happen differently to different Men, according to their own Ap∣prehensions and Presumptions. For the great Deceiver knows, how to procure Things agreeable to every Man's Temper, and en∣snare him by his own Suspicions and Consent.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> Of <HI>Candlemass-Day;</HI> why so called; the Blas∣phemy of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in consecrating Wax Candles.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Day goes under several Denomina∣tions: It is called the Day of <HI>CHRIST's Presentation;</HI> because on it CHRIST was pre∣sented in the Temple; it is called the <HI>Holy-Day</HI> of St. <HI>Simeon;</HI> because it was on it, that he took our SAVIOUR up in his Arms: And it is called the <HI>Purification,</HI> because then the Holy Virgin was purified. It is generally a Day of Festivity, and more than ordinary Observation among Women, and is therefore called the <HI>Wives Feast-Day.</HI> The Feasting seems to be observed in Honour of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> for as on the Day of a Woman's being <HI>church'd,</HI> there is no common Entertainment, so it seems, that this Feasting was begun in the Times of Popery, by Way of Compliment to the Churching-Day of the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>It has the Name of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nos Anglica, <HI>the Purification of our Lady.</HI> Vel com∣muni Sermone potius, <HI>Candlemas-Day:</HI> A distributione &amp; gestatione cereorum ardentium: Vel etiam, quod per illum diem cereorum usus in vespertinis precibus &amp; litaniis, per totam hyemem adhibitus, cessare solet, usque ad sanctorum omnium festum anni insequentis. <HI>Montag.

<P>These <HI>Lights</HI> so carried about, were blessed of the <HI>Priests,</HI> as <HI>Hospinian</HI> tells us, who made Use of the following Prayers at their Conse∣cration.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rogamus te per invocationem sancti tui nominis, &amp; per intercessionem <HI>Mariae</HI> beatae virginis matris filii tui, &amp;c. ut consecrare velis has candelas ad utilitatem &amp; commodum hominis, &amp;c. &amp; mox, Domine Jesu, benedicas obsecro hanc creaturam ceream, &amp; concede illi caelestem,—malignus spi∣ritus contremescat, &amp; ita territus aufugiat, &amp;c. <HI>Hospin. de Fest.

And again. O LORD JESU, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst bless this thy Creature of <HI>Wax,</HI> and grant it thy Heavenly Benediction, by the Power of thy Holy Cross; that as it was a Gift to Man, by which the Darkness might be driven away, so now it may be endow'd with such Virtue by the <HI>Sign of the</HI> Holy
<PB N="222" REF="240"/>
Cross, that wheresoever it is lighted and pla∣ced, the evil Spirit may tremble, and, with his Servants, be in such Terror and Confusion as to fly away from that Habitation, and no more vex and disturb thy Servants.</P>
<P>After this, he adjures the <HI>Wax Candles,</HI> in Words like these.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adjuro te creaturam ceream in nomine Domini nostri &amp; sanctae Trinitatis, ut sis extirpatio &amp; depulsio diaboli &amp; spect∣rorum ejus, &amp;c. <HI>Hospin. ibid.</HI></NOTE> I adjure thee, O thou waxen Creature, in the Name of our LORD and the Holy Trinity, that thou repel and ex∣tirpate the Devil and his Sprights, <HI>&amp;c</HI> And therefore all Christians (says <HI>Eccius.

<P>Our Author upon this, says, That this is manifest Blasphemy and Idolatry. For as on the one Hand, they take the Name of GOD and the Holy Trinity in vain, so on the other they attribute to a Wax Candle, what should be ascribed to CHRIST alone, and the quick∣ning Power of the Holy Ghost.</P>

<BIBL>Fuller's Church History, p. 222.</BIBL></P></NOTE>, says Becon in his Reliques of Rome, Fol. 164, commaunded, that all the People shuld go on Procession upon <HI>Candlemasse Day,</HI> and <HI>carry Candels</HI> about with them, <HI>brenning</HI> in their <HI>Hands,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 684. <HI>Durand,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>How this <HI>Candle-bearing</HI> on <HI>Candlemass Day</HI> came first up, the Author of our English Festival decla∣reth on this Manner. "Somtyme sayeth he, when the Romaines by great Myght and royal Power, conquered all the World, they were so proude, that they forgat God, and made them divers Gods after their own Lust. And so among all they had a God that they called <HI>Mars,</HI> that had been tofore a notable Knight in Battayle. And so they prayed
<PB N="224" REF="242"/>
to hym for Help, and for that they would speed the better of this Knyght, the People prayed, and did great Worship to his Mother, that was called <HI>Februa,</HI> after which Woman, much People have Opinion, that the Moneth <HI>February</HI> is called. Wherefore the 2d Day of thys Moneth is <HI>Candlemass Day.</HI></P>
<P>The Romaines this Night, went about the City of Rome, with <HI>Torches and Candles brenning</HI> in Worship of this Woman <HI>Februa,</HI> for hope to have the more Helpe and Succoure of her Sonne <HI>Mars.</HI></P>
<P>Then was there a Pope, that was called Sergius, and when he saw Christian People draw to this false Maumetry and untrue Belief; he thought to undo this foule Use and Custom, and turn it into God's Worship, and our <HI>Lady's,</HI> and gave Com∣mandment that all Christian People should come to Church, and <HI>offer</HI> up <HI>a Candle brennyng,</HI> in the Worship that they did to this Woman Februa, and do Worship to <HI>our Lady,</HI> and to her Sonne our Lord Jesus Christ. So that now this Feast is solemn∣ly hallowed thorowe all Christendome. And every Christan Man and Woman of covenable Age, is bound to come to Church, and <HI>offer</HI> up their <HI>Can∣dles,</HI> as though they were bodily with our <HI>Lady,</HI> hopyng for this Reverence and Worship that they do to our Ladye to have a great Reward in Heaven, &amp;c."</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XX.</HI> Of <HI>Valentine-Day;</HI> its Ceremonies; what the Council of <HI>Trullus</HI> thought of such Customs; that they had better be omitted.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a <HI>Ceremony,</HI> never omitted among the Vulgar, to draw Lots, which they Term <HI>Valentines,</HI> on the <HI>Eve</HI> before<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Valentine</HI> a Presbyter of the Church was beheaded under <HI>Claudius</HI> the Emperor.</NOTE> <HI>Valentine-day.</HI> The Names of a select Number of one Sex, are by an equal Number of the other put into some Vessel; and after that, every one draws a Name, which for the present is called their <HI>Valentine,</HI> and is also look'd upon as a good Omen of their being Man and Wife afterwards.</P>
<P>There is a rural Tradition, that on this Day every<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Nature the Vicare of the Almightie Lord</L>

<BIBL>Chaucer.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> Bird chuses its Mate. From this
<PB N="226" REF="244"/>
perhaps the youthful Part of the World hath first practised this Custom, so common at this Season.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Trullan</HI> Council we have Lots and Divinations forbid, as being some of those Things which <HI>provoked the LORD to anger</HI> against King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>2</HI> Lib. Kings, Chap. <HI>21.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Manasses,</HI> who used Lots and <HI>Divinations,</HI> &amp;c. upon which the <HI>Scholiast</HI> hath these Words.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Can. <HI>65.</HI> in Syn. Trul. in Bals. P. <HI>440.</HI></NOTE> The Custom of drawing Lots was after this Manner; on the 23d Day of <HI>June,</HI> which is the Eve of St. <HI>John Baptist,</HI> Men and Women were accustomed to gather together in the Evening by the Sea-side, or in some certain Houses, and there adorn a Girl, who was her Parents first-begotten Child, af∣ter the Manner of a Bride. Then they feast∣ed and leaped after the Manner of <HI>Bacchanals,</HI> and danced and shouted as they were wont to do on their Holy-days: After this they poured into a narrow neck'd Vessel some of the Sea-Water, and put also into it certain Things be∣longing to each of them. Then as if the Devil gifted the Girl, with the Faculty of telling future Things; they would enquire with a loud Voice, about the good or evil Fortune that should attend them: Upon this the Girl would take out of the Vessel, the first Thing that came to Hand, and shew it,
<PB N="227" REF="245"/>
and give it to the Owner; who upon receiv∣ing it, was so foolish as to imagine himself wiser, as to the good or evil Fortune that should attend him.</P>
<P>This Custom, as he tells us a little after, is altogether diabolical: And surely it was so, being used as a presage of what was future. Was the Custom of the Lots now mention'd, used as among the Heathens, they would no Doubt be as worthy of Condemnation; but as far as I know, there is but little Credit given to them; tho' that little is too much, and ought to be laid aside. But if the Cu∣stom was used without any Mixture or Allay of Superstition, as I believe it is in some Pla∣ces, yet it is often attended with great Incon∣veniences and Misfortunes, with Uneasinesses to Families, with Scandal, and sometimes with Ruin.</P>

<P>BIRDS are said to choose their Mates about this Time of the Year, and probably from thence came the Custom of young Persons chusing Valen∣tines or special loving Friends on that Day: This is the commonly received Opinion.—I rather in∣cline to controvert this, supposing it to be the Remains of an antient Superstition in the Church of Rome on this Day, of choosing <HI>Patrons</HI> for the Year ensuing; and that, because Ghosts were thought to walk on the Night of this Day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This I find in an Observation of the 14th of February, in the old Romish Calendar so often cited: <Q>"Manes nocte vagati creduntur."</Q></P></NOTE>, or about this Time.</P>

<P>SHROVE-TIDE signifieth the Time of <HI>con∣fessing Sins,</HI> as the Word <HI>Tide,</HI> which signifies <HI>Time;</HI> and the <HI>Saxon</HI> Word <HI>Shrive</HI> or <HI>Shrift,</HI> which signifies <HI>Confession,</HI> plainly shew. The Reason why this Time is so denominated is, because it was set apart by the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> for a Time of <HI>Shriving</HI> or <HI>confessing Sins.</HI> For then People were wont to confess their Sins, and receive the Sacrament, that they might be better prepar'd for the Religious Observation of the following Season of <HI>Lent.</HI> Thus in the Constitutions of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Simon</HI> of <HI>Sudbury</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> was made at <HI>Lambeth</HI> A.

<PB N="231" REF="249"/>
is ordered, <Q>That on the Week next before <HI>Lent,</HI> every Man should go to his Shrift, and his Shrift should shrive him in such a Manner, as his Deeds which he had done requir'd: And that he should charge all that belong to his District, that if any of them have Discord with any, he make Peace with him; if any one will not be brought to this, then he shall not shrive him; but then he shall inform the Bishop, that he may convert him to what is right, if he be willing to belong to GOD: Then all Contentions and Disputes shall cease; and if there be any one of them, that hath taken Offence at another, then shall they be reconcil'd, that they may more freely say in the LORD'S Prayer, <HI>LORD forgive us our Trespasses,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>This Custom of confessing to the Priest at this Time, was laid aside by our Church at the Reformation: For Sins are to be confess'd to GOD alone, and not to the Priest, except when the Conscience cannot otherwise be quieted: Then indeed the Grief is to be open∣ed to the Spiritual Guide in private,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exhort. to the Com.</NOTE> <HI>That

Surely the Church never design'd, when she so justly took away the publick Confessions of this Sea∣son, that Rioting and Gaming, and Drunken∣ness, should continue amongst us. Are these a fit Preparation for so solemn a Season? Will they qualifie us for the Hearing of the History of our LORD'S Passion? Will they prepare us for the Reception of his Body and Blood? And fit us to meet him in the Mor∣ning of the Resurrection? Will they not ra∣ther speak us <HI>Heathens</HI> than <HI>Christians?</HI> And lead us to Hell, than on the Way to Hea∣ven?

And a <HI>Doctor</HI> of our own Church, in his Discourse upon this <HI>Fe∣stival,</HI> says, <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Spark</HI>'s Feasts and Fasts.</NOTE> From the Story, as described by St. <HI>Luke</HI> and St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> some of the an∣cient Church took Occasion, as on this Day, to go in Procession with <HI>Palms</HI> in their Hands, and to denominate it <HI>Palm-Sunday.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="255"/>But however harmless this Custom might have been, in the Times of its first institution, it is certain, that in after Ages it sunk into Superstition and gross Idolatry. Thus the <HI>Rhemists,</HI> in their Translation of the New Te∣stament, describe the Ceremony themselves: <Q>These Offices of Honour, done to our <HI>Savi∣our</HI> extraordinarily, were very acceptable. And for a Memory hereof, the Holy Church maketh a solemn Procession every Year upon this Day; specially in our Country, when it was Catholick, with the Blessed Sacrament reverently carryed, as it were CHRIST upon the <HI>Ass,</HI> and strawing of Bushes and Flowers, bearing of Palms, setting up Boughs, spread∣ing and hanging up the richest Clothes, the Quire and Quiresters singing, as here the Children and the People; all done in a very godly Ceremony, to the Honour of CHRIST, and the Memory of his Triumph upon this Day. The like Service, and the like Duties done to him in all other solemn Processions of the Blessed Sacrament, and otherwise, be undoubtedly no less grateful.</Q> Dr.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fulk. in Loc.

<PB N="238" REF="256"/>
and drunken, not to be carryed about in Procession like a Heathenish Idol: But it is pretty Sport, that you make the Priests that carryeth this Idol, to supply the Room of the <HI>Ass,</HI> on which CHRIST did ride: Thus you turn the Holy Mistery of CHRIST'S riding to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to a <HI>May-game</HI> and pa∣gent Play. And yet you say, such Service done to CHRIST is undoubtedly exceeding grateful; yea, no less grateful, than that was done by his Disciples, at the Time mentioned in the Text: Your Argument and Proof is none, but your bare Assevera∣tions. That which the Disciples did, had the Warrant of the Holy Scripture; but who hath regarded these Theatrical Pomps at their Hands? Or what Word of GOD have you to assure you that he accepteth such Will-worship? Who detesteth all Wor∣ship, which is according to the Doctrines and Traditions of Men, and not after his own Commandment.</Q></P>
<P>From this superstitious and idolatrous Cus∣tom, without all doubt it comes to pass, that we now and then, on a <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> see the young People carrying <HI>Branches of Palms</HI> in their Hands; which they seem fond of having that Day, and which they as little regard at other Times.

as it is now intirely stript of any Superstition, and is an Emblem of the Season, and the Transactions of that Day; so I see no harm in so innocent an Observation.</P>
<P>But how much better would it be to car∣ry in our Hands this Day,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ramos debent fideles portare, id est bona opera.— Opera miserecordiae sunt, vestire nudos, colligere hospites, errantes revocare, visitare infirmos, &amp;c. <HI>Bed.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>THERE can be no Doubt but that <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> the <HI>Dominica in Ramis Palmarum,</HI> was so called from the Palm Branches and green Boughs for∣merly distributed on that Day, in Commemoration of our Lord's riding to Jerusalem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Fuller's Church History, p. 222, we read, <Q>Bearing of <HI>Palms</HI> on Palm-Sunday, <HI>is</HI> in Memory of the receiving of Christ into Hierusalem a little before his Death, <HI>and</HI> that we may have the same Desire to receive him into our Hearts.</Q> Provision is made for retaining the Rites used on Palm-Sunday, and we have also the Reasons told us why they should be retained, in the Convo∣cation, in the Time of Henry 8th, referred to in the Observations on the preceding Chapter.</NOTE>. Sprigs of <HI>Box Wood</HI> are still used as a Substitute for <HI>Palms</HI> in Ro∣man Catholic Countries.—Stow, in his Survey of London, tells us, <Q>that in the Week before Easter, had ye great Shewes made, for the fetching in of a <HI>twisted Tree,</HI> or <HI>With,</HI> as they termed it, out of the Woods into the King's House, and the like in∣to every Man's House of Honour or Worship.</Q>
This must also have been a Substitute for the Palm: Thus it is still customary with our Boys to go out and gather the <HI>Willow Flowers</HI> or <HI>Buds</HI> at this Time.—These seem to have been selected, because in the North they are generally the only Things at this Season, in which the Power of Vegetation can be discovered.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIII.</HI> Of rising early on Easter Day: What is meant by the Sun dancing that Morn: The Antiquity of rising early on this Day; the End and De∣sign of it: The great Advantage of it.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a common Custom among the Vulgar and uneducated Part of the World, to rise before the <HI>Sun</HI> on <HI>Easter-day,</HI> and walk into the Fields: The Reason of which is to see the Sun <HI>Dance;</HI> which they have been told, from an <HI>old Tradition,</HI> always dances as upon that Day. We read indeed that the Sun once<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Josh. x.</NOTE> <HI>stood still,</HI> but whether the Sun danced upon the very Day our Saviour rose on, we cannot tell: It's very probable it did not, because the Scriptures are silent; and that it never did so since, I think we may be well assur'd; foras∣much as never any, that we have heard of, have seen any such Thing since that Time. If therefore this Tradition hath any Meaning, it must be a <HI>metaphorical</HI> one; that when the Morning proves clear, there is a seeming Smile over the Face of Nature, and Earth and Hea∣ven shew Tokens of Joy. For as the Earth and her Valleys, by standing thick with Corn,
<PB N="242" REF="260"/>
are said <HI>to laugh and sing;</HI> so, on Account of the Resurrection, the Heavens and the Sun may be said to dance for Joy; or as the Psal∣mist words it,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xcvi. 11. Caeliquidem digni laetentur, terra autem exultet. <HI>Damasc. in Dominicam Pascha, P.</HI> 514.</NOTE> The <HI>Heavens may rejoyce, and the Earth may be glad.</HI></P>
<P>There is then, really speaking, nothing in the Dancing of the Sun upon <HI>Easter-day;</HI> but yet it is a very ancient and commendable Custom to be up early at this Holy Time: And therefore <HI>Damascen,</HI> in his <HI>Paschal Hymn,</HI> sings,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vigilemus mane profundo, &amp; pro unguenti hymnum af∣feramus Domino, &amp; Christum videamus justitiae solem, omni∣bus vitam exorientem. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> Let us watch very early in the Morn∣ing; and instead of Ointment, let us bring an Hymn to our Lord; and let us see our CHRIST, the <HI>Sun of Righteousness,</HI> who is the Life that riseth to all Men. And indeed it is the most seasonable Time for meditating on our LORD'S Resurrection, and it's pleasing Cir∣cumstances. For as the Place where any nota∣ble Thing has been transacted, seldom or never fails to raise the Idea of the Transaction; so the particular Time, when it was done, does generally produce the same Effect. And as the Truth of the Former, was the Occasion of many holy and religious Men going<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fulk. Test. Cont. Rhem. Matth. Cap. <HI>28.</HI> in Annot.</NOTE> to visit
<PB N="243" REF="261"/>
the Place of the Sepulchre, and hear it, as it were, say, what the Angel did to the Women, <HI>Come, see the Place where the Lord lay;</HI> so the Truth of the Latter was the Reason, why de∣vout and holy Men, did in the best Ages of the Church, rise early in the Morning of the Resurrection. The Primitive Christians spent the Night preceeding it, in Prayers and Praises, till the Time of <HI>Cock-crow,</HI> the supposed Hour of our Saviour's rising. For as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Latinorum concors est sententia, Christum non media nocte, verum mane in aurora, canentibus vice Gallorum an∣gelis, devicta morte &amp; confractis portis inferi, surrexisse. <HI>Du∣rant. de Rit. Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 7.</NOTE> <HI>Durant</HI> tells us, it is universally assented to by the Latin Church, that after our Saviour had conquer'd Death, and broken the Gates of Hell, he arose from the Dead, not at Mid-night, but in the Morning, at the Time of Cock-crow; which not the Cocks, but the Angels themselves pro∣claimed. And when these Pernoctations were laid aside, it was the Custom to rise early, and spend the Morning in such a Manner as was suitable to the Nature of the Time. The Salutation of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Church <HI>Anestese;</HI> or, <HI>The LORD is risen,</HI> and the usual Answer, <HI>The LORD is risen indeed;</HI> were no doubt the com∣mon Salutation of that Morning: And if this present Custom of the Vulgar has had at any Time any laudable Custom for its Original, it
<PB N="244" REF="262"/>
was, no doubt, this of rising early to contem∣plate the more seasonably on the Resurrection of CHRIST.</P>
<P>And now, was this the End of rising early at that Holy Time, it would be very advan∣tageous; but to rise with the View of the Vul∣gar, is foolish and ridiculous. Would we rise before the Sun, and prevent the Dawn of Day, our Meditations would be strong and vigorous, and almost persuade us that the real Actions of that Morn were presented to our View. For when at that Time all Things are husht in Silence, and wrap'd in Darkness, or but illu∣minated with the friendly Moon, the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Devotae Christi foeminae, quae illum &amp; vivum dilexerant &amp; mortuum desiderabant, per noctem ambulantes, juvante luna, venerunt ad monumentum. <HI>Rupert de Divin.

<P>These and the other Accidents at our LORD'S Resurrection, would afford us a satisfactory and comfortable Meditation; would inflame our Hearts with a burning Love, and melt us into Tears of Joy. In our eager Wishes and warm Desires, we should, with the Holy Wo∣men, kiss the Feet of our Saviour, and be al∣most Partakers of equal Happiness with them; or, sure we are, that we should have our Sa∣viour in our Hearts, and not fail of seeing him in his Kingdom. He whom we have so carefully sought for, will vouchsafe to be found of us; in his Grace, at the Sepulchre, and in his Glory, in Heaven.

<P>ON the <HI>Holy-Days of Easter,</HI> it is customary for Work to cease, and Servants to be at Liberty: Which is a Resemblance of the Prac∣tice of the primitive Church, which set apart the whole Week after <HI>Easter,</HI> for to praise and glorifie GOD, for our SAVIOUR'S Resurrection: In which<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Servos autem &amp; ancillas ac omnes, qui nostro servitio sunt addicti, profecto ab omni servitutis severitate eos hoc tem∣pore laxare debemus.—Ut libere &amp; secure omnes possint ad audiendum divinum officium convenire, &amp; communicare. <HI>Belith.

But other Customs so frequently observed at this Time, such as <HI>publick Showes, Gamings, Horse-Races,</HI> &amp;c. were forbidden, as being foreign to the Holiness of this Season.</P>
<P>In after Ages, when the Church fell into Corruption, and the Substance of Religion de∣cay'd into the <HI>Shadow of Ceremonies,</HI> the usual Prayers and Praises of the Season, were either much neglected, or but superficially observed.

<P>Why they should play at <HI>Hand-Ball</HI> at this Time rather than any other Game, I have not been able to find out; but I suppose it will be readily granted, that this Custom of so playing, was the Original of our present Recreations and Diversions on <HI>Easter Holy Days,</HI> and in particular of playing at <HI>Hand-Ball for a</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P>ON the <HI>Calends,</HI> or the <HI>first Day of</HI> May, commonly called <HI>May-Day,</HI> the juvenile Part of both Sexes, were wont to rise a little after Mid-night, and walk to some neigh∣bouring Wood, accompany'd with Musick and the blowing of Horns; where they break down Branches from the Trees, and adorn them with <HI>Nose-gays</HI> and <HI>Crowns of Flowers.</HI> When this is done, they return with their Booty home-wards, about the ri∣sing of the Sun, and make their Doors and Windows to Triumph in the Flowery Spoil. The after-part of the Day, is chiefly spent in dancing round a Tall-Poll, which is called a <HI>May-Poll;</HI> which being placed in a convenient Part of the Village, stands there, as it were consecrated to the <HI>Goddess of Flowers,</HI> without the least Violation offer'd it, in the whole Circle of the Year.

The Rites begin with spilling some of the Caudle on the Ground by Way of Libation: On that every one takes a Cake of Oat-meal, upon which are raised nine square Knobs, each de∣dicated to some particular Being, the supposed Preserver of their Flocks and Herds, or to some particular Animal, the real Destroyer of them: Each Person then turns his Face to the Fire, breaks off a Knob, and flinging it over his Shoulders, says, this I give to thee, preserve thou my Horses; this to thee, preserve thou my Sheep; and so on: After that they use the same Ceremony to the noxious Animals.

<P>THE Word <HI>Parochia</HI> or Parish antiently signi∣fied what we now call the Diocese of a Bi∣shop.— In the early Ages of the Christian Church, as Kings founded Cathedrals, so great Men found∣ed parochial Churches, for the Conversion of themselves and their Dependents; the Bounds of the parochial Division, being commonly the same with those of the Founder's Jurisdiction. Some Foundations of this Kind were as early as <HI>Justinian</HI> the Emperor. Bede mentions them about 700.</P>
<P>Before the Reign of Edward the Confessor, the parochial Divisions in this Kingdom were so far advanced, that every Person might be traced to the Parish to which he belonged.—This appears by the Canons published in the Time of <HI>Edgar</HI> and <HI>Canute.</HI> The Distinction of Parishes as they now stand, appears to have been settled before the Nor∣man Conquest: In Doomsday Book, the Parishes agree very near to the modern Division. See Collier's Eccl. Hist. Vol. I. p. 231.—Camden tells us, that this Kingdom was first divided into Pa∣rishes by Honorius, Archbishop of Canterbury, A. D. 636, and counts 2984 Parishes.—The Late∣ran Council made some such Division as this: It compelled every Man to pay Tythes to his <HI>Parish Priest;</HI> Men before that Time payed them to whom they pleased; since then, it has happend

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVII.</HI> Of Midsummer-Eve: Of kindling Fires, their Original: That this Custom formerly was su∣perstitious, but now may be used with Inno∣cence.</HEAD>
<P>ON the <HI>Eve of St.</HI> John Baptist, commonly called <HI>Midsummer Eve,</HI> it is usual in the most of Country Places, and also here and there in <HI>Towns and Cities,</HI> for both Old and Young to meet together, and be Merry over a large Fire, which is made in the open Street. Over this they frequently leap and play at va∣rious Games, such as Running, Wrestling, Dancing, &amp;c. But this is generally the Exer∣cise of the younger Sort; for the old Ones, for the most Part, sit by as Spectators, and enjoy themselves and their Bottle. And thus they spend the Time till Mid-night, and some∣times till <HI>Cock-Crow.</HI></P>

of the Way of CHRIST. But if this was the Reason of this Custom formerly, as it's proba∣ble it was, (it having been a common Thing, to shadow out Times and Seasons by Em∣blems;) yet the Custom still continued among us, was originally instituted upon another Bottom.</P>
<P>And indeed the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Habent hoc a gentibus, antiquitus enim dracones hoc tempore ad libidinem propter calorem excitati, volando per aerem frequenter in puteos &amp; fontes spermatizabant, ex quo, &amp;c.

By this Means the Water became infected, and the Air polluted; so that who∣ever drank the Waters, was either tormented with a grievous Distemper, or lost his Life. As soon as the Phycians perceived this, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ordered Fires to be made every where about the Wells and Fountains, and those Things which occasioned the noisomest Smell to be burnt, knowing that thereby the Dragons would be driven away. And forasmuch as this Custom was observed about the Time we
<PB N="273" REF="291"/>
now celebrate St. <HI>John Baptist</HI>'s Feast, it is therefore still observed among some People. And agreeable to this it is, that Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> tells us, that <HI>Barnwell,</HI> a Village near <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> got its Name from the Children play∣ing about a <HI>Well</HI> on St. <HI>John Baptist's Eve.</HI></P>
<P>The Custom of kindling such Fires, was severely censur'd by the Church: And there∣fore in the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trullus,</HI> this Canon was made against it,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Can. <HI>65.</HI> in Synod. Trull. ex Bals, P. <HI>440.</HI></NOTE> That if any Clergy-man or Lay-man observed the Rite of making on Fires on the <HI>New-Moon,</HI> (which some were wont to observe, and according to an old Custom, to leap over them in a mad and foolish Manner,) he should be deposed, if the Former, if the Latter, he should be ex∣communicated.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scholiast</HI> upon this <HI>Canon</HI> hath these Words: The <HI>New-Moon</HI> was always the first Day of the Month, and it was Customary among the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> to hold then a Feast, and pray that they might be lucky du∣ring the Continuance of the Month. Of these it was, that GOD spake by the Prophet: My Soul hateth your <HI>New-Moons</HI> and your Sab∣baths. And not only this, but they also kindled Fires before their Shops and Houses, and leaped over them; imagining that all the
<PB N="274" REF="292"/>
Evils which had befallen them formerly, would be burnt away, and that they should be more successful and lucky afterwards. Now about the Sitting of this Synod, there were some of the Christians, who observed this Custom upon the same Accounts that the Heathens did, which occasioned it's being forbid by the Council; and that if a <HI>Clergy∣man</HI> was Guilty of it, he should be deposed; if a <HI>Lay-man,</HI> excommunicated. He also tells us, that on St. <HI>John Baptist's Eve,</HI> the Vul∣gar were wont to make on Fires for the whole Night, and leap over them, and draw Lots, and Divine about their good or evil Fortune.</P>
<P>But whatever Reason the Heathens had for kindling these Fires; whether as <HI>Duran∣dus</HI> thinks, that the lustful <HI>Dragons</HI> might be driven away, or as the <HI>Canon,</HI> that their evil Fortune might be burnt, it is certain that the Custom was invented and practised by them; and because of the Superstition attending the Observation of it, was very justly forbidden by the Council. And undoubtedly was the Making of such Fires now, attended with any such Superstition, it would be equally crimi∣nal to observe them. But<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rogos—quos nos Angli <HI>Bonefires</HI> vocamus, &amp; in publica laetitia &amp; gaudiis adhibemus, non obstante isto canone. <HI>Mountag.

<P>This Author tells us of a remarkable Custom, which he himself was an Eye-witness of in Scotland: "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Atque hodie recens baptizatos infantes (ut vidi fieri ab Anicula in Scotia olim, quae sui Papatus reliquias saperet) statim atque do∣mum redierint in limine oblatis eduliis <HI>bene venire</HI> dicunt, statim∣que importatos, anicula, sive Obstetrix fuerit, fasciis involutos accipit &amp; per flammam ter quaterve leniter vibrant, verbis his additis, jam te flamma, si unquam, absumat, terque verba repe∣tunt. <HI>Ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Pennant informs us, that in the Highlands Midwives give new-born Babes a small Spoonful of <HI>Earth</HI> and Whisky, as the first Food they taste.</P></NOTE> They take, says he, the new-baptized Infant, and vibrate it three or four Times gently over a Flame, saying and repeating thrice, <Q>Let the Flame con∣sume thee <HI>now</HI> or <HI>never.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This too seems to favour his Supposition that <HI>passing over Fires</HI> was accounted <HI>expiatory.</HI></P>
<P>There was a Feast at Athens kept by private Families, called <HI>Amphidromia,</HI> on the 5th Day after the Birth of the Child, when it was the Custom for the <HI>Gossips</HI> to <HI>run round the Fire</HI> with the Infant in <HI>their Arms,</HI> and then having deliver∣ed it to the Nurse, they were entertained with Feasting and Dancing.</P>
<P>Mr. Borlase in his Account of Cornwall tells us, <Q>The Cornish make Bonefires in every Village on the Eve of St. John Baptist's and St. Peter's Days, which I take to be the Remains of Part of the Druid Superstition.</Q></P>

<P><Q>L'origine de ce Feu que tant de Nations conservent encore, &amp; qui se perd dans l'ántiquité, est tres simple.

<P><Q>Lorsqu' après une longue suite d'années, le Solstice n'en sit plus l'ouverture, on continua cependant également l'usage des feux dans le même tems, par une suite de l'habitude, &amp; des idées superstitieuses qu'on y avoit attachées; d'ailleurs, il eût été triste d'anéantir un jour de joie, dans des tems où il y en avoit peu; aussi cet usage s'est-il maintenu jusqu' à nous.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVIII.</HI> Of the Feast of Sheep-shearing, an ancient Custom.</HEAD>
<P>THE Feast of Sheep-sheering, is generally a Time of Mirth and Joy, and more than ordinary Hospitality; indeed it is but little observed in these Northern Parts, but in the Southern it is pretty common. For on the Day they begin to sheer their Sheep, they provide a plentiful Dinner for the Sheerers, and for their Friends who come to visit them on that Occasion; a Table also, if the Wea∣ther permit, is spread in the open Village, for the young People and Children.</P>
<P>After what Manner soever this Custom reach'd us, it is certain it may boast of great Antiquity. It is mention'd in the Second Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> as a Feast of great Magnifi∣cence, both for Grandeur of Entertainment and Greatness of Company. No less a Person than <HI>Absalom</HI> the King's Son was the Master of this Feast, and no less Persons were the Guests than the King's Sons, the Brethren of <HI>Absalom;</HI> nay it was a Feast that might enter∣tain the King himself, or surely the King would never have been so importun'd, never would have receiv'd the Compliment so kindly. For 'tis said, <HI>It came to pass after two full
<PB N="283" REF="301"/>
Years, that</HI> Absalom <HI>had Sheep-sheerers in</HI> Baal∣hazor, <HI>which is beside</HI> Ephraim, <HI>and</HI> Absalom <HI>invited all the King's Sons. And</HI> Absalom <HI>came to the King, and said, Behold, now thy Servant hath Sheep-sheerers, let the King, I beseech thee, and his Servants, go with thy Servant. And the King said, Nay, my Son, let us not all go, lest we be chargeable unto thee.</HI> Of this kind also was the Feast which <HI>Nabal</HI> made for his Sheerers, when <HI>David was driven</HI> to straits in the Wilderness, and sent his Servants to ask a Present of him. He calls the Day it was held on, a <HI>good Day;</HI> that is, a Day of plenti∣ful Eating and Drinking. And therefore <HI>Na∣bal</HI> answer'd the Servants of <HI>David, shall I then take my Bread and my Water, and my flesh that I have killed for my Sheerers, and give it unto Men, whom I know not whence they be?</HI> And further, it is said in the same Chapter, that so grand and magnificent was this Feast, <HI>that he had a Feast in his House, like the Feast of a King.</HI> We find also in the Book of <HI>Genesis,</HI> that <HI>Laban</HI> went to sheer his Sheep, in which Time <HI>Jacob</HI> made his Escape, which <HI>Laban</HI> heard not of till the third Day. Of such great Antiquity then is this Custom, and tho' its Antiquity is not of such force as to palliate Luxury and Profuseness in these Entertain∣ments; yet no doubt it will vindicate the Harmlesness of a moderate Feast upon this Oc∣casion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIX.</HI> Of <HI>Michaelmass:</HI> Guardian Angels the Discourse of Country People at this Time: That it seems rather true, that we are protected by a Num∣ber of Angels, than by one particular Genius.</HEAD>
<P>THE Feast of this Season is celebrated in Commemoration of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and all the Orders of Angels. It is called, <HI>The Dedi∣cation of St. Michael,</HI> because of a Church be∣ing dedicated to him on this Day in Mount <HI>Garganus.</HI></P>
<P>At this Season of the Year, it is a general Custom to elect the Governors of <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Cities,</HI> to promote Peace among Men, and guard them against Harm from their malici∣ous Fellow Creatures. Whether this particu∣lar Time of the Year has been chosen for e∣lecting them, because then is the Feast of An∣gels, the Guardians and Protectors of Men, and of their Communities and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daniel, C. 1.</NOTE> Provinces, is not so certain. It is certainer, that when ever it comes, it brings into the Minds of the Peo∣ple, that old Opinion of <HI>Tutelar Angels,</HI> that every Man has his <HI>Guardian Angel;</HI> that is, one particular Angel who attends him from his Coming in, till his Going out of Life,
<PB N="289" REF="307"/>
who guides him through the Troubles of the World, and strives as much as he can, to bring him to Heaven.</P>
<P>Now that good Angels attend good Men is without Dispute. They guide them in the Mazes of the Wilderness of Life, and bring them to their desir'd Homes; they surround them in the Seas of Afflictions, and lead them to the Shores of Peace; and as when the <HI>Is∣raelites</HI> passed through the Red-Sea, <HI>the Cloud became Light to them, but Darkness to their Ene∣mies,</HI> so in the troublesome Seas of this Life, the <HI>Angels</HI> are both the Guides of good Men, and their Protectors from Evil, from the De∣vil and his Angels. And therefore the Psal∣mist says, <HI>The Angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them; and that he will give his Angels Charge over good Men.</HI> They are also supposed to be that Hedge, which GOD placed about <HI>Job,</HI> which the Devil so much complains of; and sure we are, that when the Eyes of <HI>Elisha</HI>'s Servant were open'd, <HI>he saw the Mountain full of Chariots and Horses of Fire round about</HI> Eli∣sha. That therefore good Men are guarded and protected by Angels the Scripture shews very clearly. But that every Man has his particular <HI>Genius,</HI> seems to be founded more upon Tradition, than any Certainty from Scripture. Thus the <HI>Egyptians</HI> believed that
<PB N="290" REF="308"/>
every Man had three Angels attending him; the <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> that every Man had two; the <HI>Romans,</HI> that there was a good and an evil <HI>Genius.</HI> And hence it is that the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet says, <HI>Quisque suos patitur manes,</HI> every Man hath his evil <HI>Genius.</HI> And if we may believe the Authority of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> the evil <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>Brutus</HI> appeared to him the Night before the Battle of <HI>Philippi,</HI> and told him he was his evil Genius, and that he would meet him there.</P>
<P>But there are greater Authorities than these in Vindication of this Opinion: <HI>Casalion</HI> ob∣serves, it may be proved from Scripture, and not only from the Tradition of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unicuique Deus custodem apposuit; &amp; asserimus indu∣bitanter nos ex scripturas illam fidem, non gentium nugibus. <HI>Cassal.</HI> 217. <HI>P. de Vet. Christ. Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> Hea∣thens. And of this Opinion was <HI>Justin Mar∣tyr, Theodoret,</HI> St. <HI>Basil,</HI> St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> and St. <HI>Austin.</HI></P>
<P>There are indeed two Places in the New Testament, which have a View to this Opini∣on. The first is in the 18th of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> the 10th Verse, <HI>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little Ones: For I say unto you, that their Angels do always behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Now because this Place takes Notice of the Angels of these little Ones, some have therefore concluded that
<PB N="291" REF="309"/>
every Man has his good Angel; at least that good Men have. But now this Conclusion does not certainly follow from these Words: For when it is said <HI>their Angels,</HI> it does indeed certainly infer, that the Angels do protect good Men, but not that every Man has his particular Angel. And hence therefore, as one observes, St. <HI>Chrisostom</HI> makes use of these Words, <HI>Enteuthen, delon,</HI> &amp;c. it is manifest that the Saints at least, if not all Men, have their Angels: But he does not hence conclude, that every Man has one. The other Place is in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> where it is said, that when <HI>Peter</HI> was delivered out of Prison, they would not believe the Maid it was he, but said, <HI>It was his Angel.</HI> It must be own'd in∣deed from this, that it seems the Opinion of those in the House, that every Man had his <HI>Guardian Angel;</HI> but this is no Proof of the Thing's being so: It only proves, that it was their Opinion, but not that this Opinion is true. The <HI>Jews</HI> had such a <HI>Tradition</HI> among them, and what was here spoken, was perhaps only according to that Tradition. Besides we read on the contrary, that sometimes one and the same Angel has been sent to different Per∣sons; thus <HI>Gabriel</HI> was sent to <HI>Daniel, Zacha∣rias,</HI> and the blessed Virgin: Sometimes the Scripture tells us of many Angels protecting one Man; for so was <HI>Elisha</HI> protected; and as
<PB N="292" REF="310"/>
we wrestle <HI>not only against Flesh and Blood, but against all the Powers of Darkness,</HI> so we have many Angels to assist and defend us. I shall not dare to determine positively against this Opinion, which has travelled down through so many Ages, which has been held by so many wise and learned Men, and which has such Scriptures brought to its Defence; this I shall only say, that of the two Opinions, the Latter seems to be the more probable; that it seems more consonant to Scripture, that we are attended by a Number of Angels, than by a particular <HI>Tutelar Angel.</HI> But this I men∣tion, not as necessary to be believed. For I am perswaded there is no Fault in believing either the one or the other, as it appears more probable: For whether soever we believe, we believe in the Protection of Angels, and that seems to be all which the Scripture requires.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXX.</HI> Of the Country Wake: How observed formerly: A Custom of the Heathens, and regulated by <HI>Gregory</HI> the Great.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Southern Parts of this Nation, the most of Country Villages are wont to ob∣serve some Sunday in a more particular Man∣ner, than the other common Sundays of the Year, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sunday after the <HI>Day of Dedi∣cation,</HI> i. e. the Sunday after the <HI>Day of the Saint,</HI> to whom their Church was dedicated. Then the Inhabitants deck themselves in their gaudiest Clothes, and have open Doors and splendid Entertainments, for the Reception and Treating of their Relations and Friends, who visit them on that Occasion, from each neighbouring Town. The Morning is spent for the most Part at Church, tho' not as that Morning was wont to be spent, not with the Commemoration of the <HI>Saint or Martyr,</HI> nor the grateful Remembrance of the <HI>Builder and Endower.</HI> The remaining Part of the Day, is spent in Eating and Drinking; and so is also a Day or two afterwards, together with all Sorts of Rural Pastimes and Exercises, such as <HI>Dancing on the Green, Wrestling, Cudgelling,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="315"/>Agreeable to this we are told, that former∣ly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Die Dominicâ post Encaeniam seu Festum Dedicationis cujusvis villae convenire solet in Aurorâ magna hominum Iu∣venumque multitudo, &amp; canora voce <HI>Holy-wakes, Holy-wakes,</HI> Exclamando Designare, <HI>&amp;c. Spelm. Gloss. in Verb. Wak.</HI></NOTE> on the Sunday after the <HI>Encaenia,</HI> or <HI>Feast of the Dedication</HI> of the Church, it was usual for a great Number of the Inhabitants of the Village, both Grown and Young, to meet together about break of Day, and cry, <HI>Holy-wakes, Holy-wakes,</HI> and after <HI>Mattens</HI> to go to Feasting and Sporting, which they continu'd for two or three Days.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Northren Parts,</HI> the Sunday's Feast∣ing is almost lost, and they observe only one other Day for the whole, which among them is called the <HI>Hopping;</HI> I suppose from the dancing and other Exercises then used. The ancient Name, and which is still common in the Southern Parts, is the <HI>Wake;</HI> which ac∣cording to Sir <HI>H. Spelman,</HI> are<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sunt celebritates Bacchanales sub fructuum temporibus, ab occiduiis &amp; Borealibus Anglis pagatim habitae. Baccha∣nales dixi ex nomine: Nam Wak.

<PB N="298" REF="316"/>
This Custom our Fore-fathers did in all Pro∣bability borrow from their Fellow Heathens,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haec eadem sunt quae apud Ethnicos Paganalia diceban∣tur, <HI>&amp;c. Spelm. ibid.</HI></NOTE> whose <HI>Paganalia</HI> or <HI>Country Feasts,</HI> were of the same Stamp, with this of the <HI>Wake.</HI></P>
<P>At the Conversion of the <HI>Saxons</HI> by <HI>Austin the Monk,</HI> it was continu'd among the Con∣verts, with some Regulations, by an Order of <HI>Pope</HI> Gregory <HI>the Great,</HI> to <HI>Mellitus</HI> the Abbot, who accompany'd <HI>Austin</HI> in his Voyage. His Words are these,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ut Die Dedicationis, vel Natalitiis Sanctorum Martyr∣rum, quorum illic reliquiae ponuntur, tabernacula sibi circa easdem Ecclesias, quae ex Fanis commutatae sunt, de ramis arborum faciant, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>This then is the Beginning of our <HI>Country Wakes,</HI> but they continu'd not in their original Purity: For the Feasting and Sporting got the ascendant of Religion, and so this <HI>Feast of De∣dication,</HI>
<PB N="299" REF="317"/>
degenerated into Drunkenness and Luxury. At present there is nothing left but the very Refuse and Dregs of it; Religion having not the least Share in it, which till these latter Ages always had some. Rioting and Feasting are now all that remain, a Scan∣dal to the Feast in particular, and to Christia∣nity in general.</P>

<P>The learned Mr. Borlase, in his Account of Cornwall, speaking on this Subject, tells us, The Parish Feasts instituted in Commemoration of the Dedication of the parochial Churches were highly esteemed among the primitive Christians, and ori∣ginally kept on the Saint's Day to whose Memory the Church was dedicated: The Generosity of the Founder and Endower thereof was at the same Time celebrated, and a Service composed suitable to the Occasion. (This is still done in the Col∣leges at Oxford to the Memory of the respective Founders.) On the Eve of this Day Prayers were

These Mantles also many did use in the Church at Morrow Masses and other Times.</P>
<P>In the 28 Canon given under King Edgar (preserved in Whe∣loc's Edition of Bede.) I find <Q>decent Behaviour enjoined at <HI>these Church Wakes:</HI> The People are commanded to pray devoutly at them, and not betake themselves to drinking or Debauchery.</Q></P>

<P>This Quotation also seems to overthrow the Ety∣mology of <HI>Wake,</HI> given from Spelman by our Author.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="320"/>This ingenious Antiquary deduces the Origin of <HI>our Fairs</HI> from these antient <HI>Wakes,</HI> where great Numbers attending, by Degrees less Devotion and Reverence were observed; till at length from <HI>Haw∣kers</HI> and <HI>Pedlars</HI> coming thither to sell their petty Wares, the Merchants came and set up Stalls and Booths in the Church-yards: And not only those, says Spelman, who lived in the Parish to which the Church belonged, resorted thither, but others from all the neighbouring Towns and Villages; and the greater the Reputation of the Saint, the greater were the Numbers that flocked together on this Occasion.—Keeping these <HI>Fairs</HI> on Sundays was justly found Fault with by the Clergy: The Abbot of Ely, in John's Reign, preached much against such Prophanation of the Sabbath, but this irreli∣gious Custom was not entirely abolished till the Reign of King Henry the Sixth.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXI.</HI> Of the Harvest Supper: A Custom of the Hea∣thens, taken from the <HI>Jewish</HI> Feast of Taber∣nacles.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Fruits of the Earth are ga∣thered in, and laid in their proper Receptacles, it is common, in the most of Country Places to provide a plentiful Supper for the <HI>Harvest-Men,</HI> and the Servants of the Family; which is called a <HI>Harvest-Supper,</HI> and in some Places a <HI>Mell-Supper,</HI> a <HI>Churn-Supper,</HI> &amp;c. At this the Servant and his Master are alike, and every Thing is done with an equal Freedom. They sit at the same Table, converse freely together, and spend the remaining Part of the Night in dancing, singing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without any Difference or Dis∣tinction.</P>
<P>There<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiquitus consuetudo fuit apud <HI>Gentiles,</HI> quod hoc mense servi pastores &amp; ancillae quadam libertate fruerentur: Et cum Dominis suis Dominarentur, &amp; cum eiis facerent festa, &amp; con∣vivia, post Collectas Messes. <HI>Durand. Rat. Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>Cap.</HI> 86.</NOTE> was a Custom among the Hea∣thens, much like this, at the gathering in of their Harvest, when Servants were indulg'd with Liberty and being on the Equality with their Masters for a certain Time.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="322"/>Now the Original of both these Custom, is <HI>Jewish:</HI> And therefore <HI>Hospinian</HI> tells us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et pro collectis frugibus Deo gratiae agebantur. Quem morem Ethnici postea ab iis mutuati sunt. <HI>Hospin. de Orig. Fest. Jud. Stukius Antiq. Convival P.</HI> 63.</NOTE>
That the Heathens copy'd after this Custom of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and at the End of their Harvest, offer'd up their first Fruits to the Gods. For the <HI>Jews</HI> rejoyced and feasted at the getting in of the Harvest.</P>
<P><HI>THEOPHYLACT</HI> in talking of this Feast, is undoubtedly mistaken, when he says,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Scenopegia, quod celebrant in Gratiarum Actionem propter convectas Fruges in Mense <HI>Septembri.</HI> Tunc enim gratias agebant Deo, convectis omnibus fructibus, <HI>&amp;c. Theo∣phylact. in</HI> 7 <HI>Cap. Joan.</HI></NOTE> That the <HI>Feast of Tabernacles</HI> was celebrated, that Thanks might be returned for the get∣ting in of the Fruits of the Earth. For GOD himself tells his own People, it was institu∣ted,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Levit. 22.—</NOTE> <HI>that their Generations might know, that he had made the Children of</HI> Israel <HI>to dwell in Booths.</HI> But however, it is certainly true, that it was a Time of returning Thanks to GOD, for the Success of the Harvest, a Time of Festivity, and Joy, and Gladness. Thus the Scripture,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Deut. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Thou shalt observe the Feast of Tabernacles seven Days, after thou hast gather'd in thy Corn and thy Wine. And thou shalt rejoyce in thy Feast, thou and thy Son and thy Daughter,
<PB N="305" REF="323"/>
and thy Man-Servant, and thy Maid-Servant; and the Levite, the Stranger, and the Father∣less and the Widow, that are within thy Gates.</HI></P>
<P>Now as the Heathens have imitated the <HI>Jews</HI> in this Custom, so it is not improbable that we have had it from the <HI>Heathens;</HI> there being a very great Likeness between the Cu∣stom now, and that of the Heathens formerly, For <HI>Macrobius</HI> tells us, That<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patres Familiarum, &amp; frugibus &amp; fructibus jam coactis, passim cum servis vescerentur, cum quibus patientiam labo∣ris in colendo rure toleraverant. <HI>Macreb.

<P>VACINA, (<HI>aliter</HI> Vacuna, a vacando, the tu∣telar Deity, as it were, of Rest and Ease) among the Antients, was the Name of the God∣dess to whom the Rustics sacrificed at the Conclu∣sion of Harvest.</P>

Images too of Straw, or Stubble, he tells us, are wont to be carried about on this Occasion; and in England he himself saw the Country People bringing home in a Cart (I suppose from the Field) a <HI>Figure made of Corn,</HI> round which Men and Women promiscuously singing, followed a Piper or a Drum.—A Vestage of this Custom is still preserved in some Places in the North: Not Half a Century ago they used every where to
<PB N="307" REF="325"/>
dress up something, similar to the Figure above described, at the End of Harvest, which was called a <HI>Kern Baby.</HI> I had this Information from an old Woman at a Village in Northum∣berland.—The Reader may perhaps smile, but I am not ashamed of my Evidence. In a Case of this Nature <HI>old Women</HI> are respectable Au∣thorities.—This northern Word is plainly a Cor∣ruption of <HI>Corn Baby</HI> or <HI>Image,</HI> as is the <HI>Kern</HI> or <HI>Churn</HI> Supper, of <HI>Corn</HI> Supper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, as Mr. Bourne tells us, is called also a <HI>Mell-Supper,</HI> plainly I think from the French <HI>Mesler,</HI> to mingle or mix together, the Master and Servants sitting promiscuously at the same Table: All being upon an equal footing, or, as our Northern vulgar idiom has it, "Hail-Fellow well met."—<HI>Amell</HI> is commonly used here for <HI>betwixt</HI> or <HI>among.</HI> I find indeed that many of our Northumbrian rustic and vulgar Words are derived to us from the French: Per∣haps we have not imported them from the first Market, but have had them at <HI>second Hand</HI> from the Scots, a People that in former Times were greatly connected with that Nation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This Feast is undoubtedly of the most remote Antiquity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the antient Roman Calendar so often cited, I find the fol∣lowing Observations on the eleventh of June (the Harvests in Italy are much earlier than with us):
<Q>The Season of Reapers, and their Custom with rustic Pomp.</Q>
<Q>Messorum aestas, et eorum consuetudo cum agresti pompa.</Q></NOTE>. That Men in all Nations, where Agriculture flourished, should have expressed their Joy on this Occasion by some outward Ceremony, has its Foundation in the Nature of Things: Sowing is <HI>Hope;</HI> Reaping, <HI>Fruition</HI> of the <HI>expected Good.</HI> To the Husbandman, whom the Fear of Wet, Blights, &amp;c. had harassed with great Anxiety, the Completion of his Wishes could not fail of imparting an enviable gust of Delight.— Festivity is but the reflex of inward Joy, and
<PB N="308" REF="326"/>
it could hardly fail of being produced on this Occa∣sion, which is a temporary suspension of every Care.</P>
<P>The Respect, shewn to Servants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr Pennant informs us, that a Custom prevails in Gloucester∣shire on the Twelfth-day, or on the Epiphany in the Evening: All the Servants of every particular Farmer assemble together in one of the Fields that has been sown with Wheat; on the Border of which, in the most conspicuous or most elevated Place, they make twelve Fires of Straw in a Row; around one of which, made larger than the Rest, they drink a cheerful Glass of Cyder to their Master's Health, Success to the future Harvest, &amp;c. then returning home, they feast on Cakes made of Carraways, &amp;c. soaked in Cy∣der, which they claim as a Reward for their past Labours in sow∣ing the Grain.—This, he observes, seems to resemble a Custom of the antient Danes, who in their Addresses to their rural Deities, emptied on every Invocation a Cup in Honour of them. Niordi et Frejae memoria poculis recolebatur, annua ut ipsis contingeret fe∣licitas, frugumque et reliquae annonae uberrimus proventus.</P>

<P>Dr. Johnson tells us that he saw the Harvest of a small Field in one of the western Islands:—The Strokes of the Sickle were timed by the Modulation of the Harvest Song, in which all their Voices were united:—They accompany in the Highlands every Action which can be done in equal Time with an appropriated Strain, which has, they say, not much Meaning, but its Effects are Regu∣larity and Chearfulness. The antient proceleusmatic Song, by which the Rowers of Gallies were animated, may be supposed to have been of this Kind. There is now an Oar Song used by the Hebridians —Thus far the learned Traveller. Our Sailors at New∣castle, in heaving their Anchors, &amp;c. use a Song of this Kind.</P></NOTE> at this Season, seems to have sprung from a grateful Sense of their good Services —Every thing depends at this Junc∣ture upon their Labour and Dispatch.</P>
<P>Different Places adopt different Ceremonies:</P>
<P>There is a Sport on this Occasion in Hertford∣shire, called, "crying the Mare," when the Reap∣ers tie together the Tops of the <HI>last</HI> Blades of Corn, which is <HI>Mare;</HI> and standing at some Distance,
<PB N="309" REF="327"/>
throw their Sickles at it, and he who cuts the Knot, has the Prize, with Acclamations and good Cheer.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Blount tells us farther, <Q>That after the <HI>Knot</HI> is <HI>cut,</HI> then they cry with a loud Voice three Times <HI>"I have her."</HI> Others answer, as many Times <HI>"What have you?"— A Mare, a Mare, a Mare: "Whose is she?"</HI> thrice also. J. B (naming the Owner three Times) <HI>Whither will you send her?</HI> To Jo. a Nicks, (naming some Neighbour, who has not all his Corn reaped) then they all shout three Times, and so the Ceremony ends with good Cheer.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI>EGGS, stained</HI> with <HI>various Colours</HI> in <HI>boiling,</HI> and sometimes <HI>covered</HI> with <HI>Leaf-gold,</HI> are at <HI>Easter</HI> presented to Children at Newcastle, and other Places in the North —They ask for their <HI>Paste Eggs,</HI> as for a <HI>Fairing,</HI> at this Season.</P>
<P>This Custom which had its beginning in <HI>childish</HI> Superstition, seems to be <HI>ending</HI> in a Way not unsuitable to its <HI>Origin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paste</HI> is plainly a Corruption of <HI>Pasche,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Coles in his Latin Dictionary renders the <HI>Pasch</HI> or <HI>Easter Egg</HI> by "<HI>Ovum paschale, croceum,</HI> seu <HI>luteum.</HI>" It is plain from hence that he has been acquainted with the Custom of <HI>dying</HI> or <HI>staining Eggs</HI> at this Season.</P>
<P>Ainsworth leaves out these two Epithets, and calls it <HI>singly</HI> "Ovum paschale".—He has known nothing I presume of this an∣tient Custom, and has therefore omitted the "croccum" or <Q>lu∣teum.</Q>—It is in this Manner, that many of our <HI>English</HI> Dictiona∣ries have been <HI>improved</HI> in modern Editions!</P></NOTE> Easter.</P>
<P>This also is a Relique of Popish Superstition, which, for whatever Cause, had made <HI>Eggs</HI> em∣blematic of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> as may be gathered from the subsequent Prayer,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Subveniat, quaesumus, Domine, tuae benedictionis gratia, huic <HI>Ovorum</HI> creaturae, ut cibus salubris fiat fidelibus tuis in tuarum gratiarum actione sumentibus, <HI>ob</HI> resurrectionem Domini nostri Jesu Christi, qui tecum, &amp;c.</Q> p. 133.</P>
<P>In the Romish Bee-hive, Fol. 15, I find the following Catalogue of popish Superstitions, in which the Reader will find our <HI>Paste Eggs</HI> very properly included:—<Q>Many <HI>traditions</HI> of <HI>idle Heads,</HI> which the Holy Church of Rome hath received for a perfit serv∣ing of God: As fasting Dayes, Yeares of Grace, <HI>Differences</HI> and <HI>Diversities</HI> of <HI>Dayes,</HI> of <HI>Meates,</HI> of Cloathing, of <HI>Candles,</HI> Holy <HI>Ashes, Holy Pace Egges</HI> and <HI>Flames, Palmes</HI> and <HI>Palme</HI> Boughes. <HI>Staves, Fooles Hoods, Shells</HI> and <HI>Bells,</HI> (relative to Pilgrimages) <HI>licking</HI> of <HI>rotten Bones,</HI> (Reliques) &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P></NOTE> which the Reader
<PB N="311" REF="329"/>
will find in an "Extract from the Ritual of Pope Paul the Vth, made for the Use of <HI>England, Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI>"—It contains various other Forms of Benediction:—</P>
<P><Q>Bless, O Lord, we beseech thee, this thy Creature of <HI>Eggs,</HI> that it may become a whole∣some Sustenance to thy faithful Servants, <HI>eating it</HI> in Thankfulness to thee, <HI>on Account of</HI> the <HI>Re∣surrection</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, who with thee and the holy Spirit, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The antient Egyptians, if the Resurrection of the Body had been a Tenet of their Faith, would perhaps have thought an <HI>Egg</HI> no improper hierogly∣phical Representation of it.—The Exclusion of a living Creature by Incubation, after the vital Prin∣ciple has lain a long while dormant or extinct, is a Process so truly marvellous, that if it could be disbelieved, would be thought by some a Thing as incredible, as that the Author of <HI>Life</HI> should be able to re-animate the <HI>Dead.</HI></P>
<P>I conjecture that the <HI>Romanists</HI> borrowed this Custom from the <HI>Jews,</HI> who in celebrating their Passover, set on the Table two unleavened Cakes, and two Pieces of the Lamb; to this they added some small Fishes, because of the Leviathan; <HI>a
<PB N="312" REF="330"/>
hard Egg,</HI> because of the Bird Ziz; some Meal, because of the Behemoth: These three Animals being, according to their Rabbinical Doctors, ap∣pointed for the Feast of the Elect in the other Life.</P>
<P>This Custom still prevails in the Greek Church: Dr. Chandler, in his Travels in Asia Minor, gives us the following Account of the Manner of cele∣brating <HI>Easter</HI> among the modern Greeks: <Q>The Greeks now celebrated Easter: A small Bier, prettily decked with Orange and Citron-buds, Jasmine, Flowers, and Boughs, was placed in the Church, with a Christ crucified rudely painted on Board, for the Body: we saw it in the Evening, and before Day Break were suddenly awakened by the blaze and crackling of a large Bonefire, with singing and shouting in Honour of the Resurrection.—They <HI>made us Presents</HI> of <HI>coloured Eggs,</HI> and Cakes of Easter Bread.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Probably the <HI>Cross Buns</HI> made at present on Good Friday, have been derived from these or such like <HI>Cakes</HI> of <HI>Easter Bread.</HI> The Country People in the North make with a Knife many little <HI>Cross-Marks</HI> on their Cakes, before they put them into the Oven, &amp;c—I have no doubt but that this too, trifling as the Remark may appear, is a <HI>Relique</HI> of <HI>Popery.</HI> Thus also persons, who cannot writ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, instead of signing their Names, are bid to <HI>make their Mark,</HI> which is generally done in the form of <HI>a Cross.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><Q><HI>Easter Day.</HI> says the Abbé d' Auteroche in his Journey to Siberia, is set apart for visiting in Russia.—A Russian came into my Room, offered me his Hand, and <HI>gave me</HI> at the same Time <HI>an Egg;</HI>—Another succeeded, he embraced me, and also <HI>gave</HI> me <HI>an Egg.</HI> I <HI>gave</HI> him in Return the <HI>Egg</HI> I had just received. The Men go to each others Houses in the Morning, and introduce them∣selves into the Houses, by saying, "Jesus Christ is risen." The Answer is, "Yes, he is risen."
<PB N="313" REF="331"/>
The People then embrace, <HI>give each other Eggs,</HI> and drink a great deal of Brandy.</Q></P>
<P>This corresponds pretty much with the subse∣quent Account of far older Date, which I tran∣scribe from Hakluyt's Voyages. 1589. Black Letter. Page 342.</P>
<P><Q>They (the Russians) have an Order at <HI>Easter,</HI> which they always observe, and that is this;— Every Year against Easter to <HI>die,</HI> or <HI>colour red</HI> with <HI>Brazzel</HI> (Brazil Wood), a great Number <HI>of Eggs,</HI> of which every Man and Woman <HI>giveth one</HI> unto the Priest of their Parish upon Easter Day in the Morning. And moreover the Com∣mon People use to carry in their Hands one of these <HI>red Eggs,</HI> not only upon Easter Day, but also three or four Days after, and <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and <HI>Gentlewomen</HI> have Eggs <HI>gilaed,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Doctor Chandler in his Travels in Greece, tells us, that at the City of Zante, <Q>he saw a Woman in a House, with the Door open, bewailing her little Son, whose dead Body lay by her, dressed, the Hair powdered, the Face painted, and <HI>bedecked</HI> with <HI>Leaf-Gold.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In the antient Calendar of the Romish Church, to which I have so often referred, I find the subsequent Observation on the 25th of March, which I confess myself entirely at a loss how to translate: <Q>"<HI>Ova annunciatae,</HI> ut aiunt, reponuntur."</Q></P></NOTE> which they carry in like Manner.—They use it, as they say, for a great Love, and in <HI>Token of</HI> the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> whereof they rejoice. For when two Friends meet during the Easter Holy-days, they come and take one another by the Hand; the one of them saith, "The Lord or Christ is risen." The other answereth, "It is so of a Truth." And then they kiss and <HI>exchange</HI> their <HI>Eggs</HI> both <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women,</HI> continuing in Kissing four Days together.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="332"/>Our antient Voyage Writer means no more, it should seem, than that the Ceremony was kept up for four Days.</P>
<P>Ray has preserved an old English Proverb on this Subject: <Q>"I'll warrant you for an <HI>Egg</HI> at <HI>Easter.</HI>"</Q></P>

<P>A <HI>Foreign Weed,</HI> which has made so many <HI>Eng∣lishmen,</HI> especially of the common Sort, be∣come its <HI>Slaves,</HI> must not be omitted in our Catalogue of popular Antiquities.</P>
<P>Captain R. Greenfield and Sir Francis Drake are said to have been the first who brought Tobacco into this Kingdom, about the Year 1586, during the Reign of Elizabeth.—A pleasant Kind of Tale is given us in the Athenian Oracle by Way of ac∣counting for the frequent Use and Continuance of taking it;</P>
<P><Q>When the Christians first discovered America, the Devil was afraid of losing his hold of the People there by the Appearance of Christianity. He is reported to have told some Indians of his Acquaintance, that he had found a Way to be revenged upon the Christians for beating up his Quarters, for he would teach them to take
<PB N="315" REF="333"/>
Tobacco, to which, when they had once tasted it, they should be perpetual Slaves.</Q></P>
<P>Our British Solomon, James the Ist, who was a great Opponent of the Devil, and even wrote a Book against Witchcraft, made a formidable At∣tack also upon this "Invention of Satan," in a <HI>learned</HI> Performance, which he called a <Q>Counter-blaste to Tobacco<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>His Majesty in the Course of his Work informs us, <Q>that some of the Gentry of the Land bestowed (at that Time) <HI>three,</HI> some <HI>Four Hundred Pounds a Yeere</HI> upon this <HI>precious stink!</HI></Q></P>
<P>An incredible Sum, especially when we consider the Value of Money in his Time. They must not have been <HI>Sterling</HI> but <HI>Scotch</HI> Pounds.</P>
<P>The following extraordinary Account of a Buckinghamshire Par∣son who <HI>abandonned</HI> himself to the use of Tobacco, is worth quot∣ing. It may be found in Lilly's History of his Life and Times, p. 44.</P>
<P><Q>In this Year also, William Bredon, Parson or Vicar of Thorn∣ton in Bucks, was living, a <HI>profound</HI> Divine, but absolutely the most <HI>polite</HI> Person for <HI>Nativities</HI> in that Age, strictly adhering to Ptolomy, which he <HI>well understood;</HI> he had a Hand in composing Sir Christopher Heydon's defence of Judicial Astrology, being at that Time his Chaplain; he was so given over to Tobacco and Drink, that when he had <HI>no</HI> Tobacco, (and I suppose <HI>too much</HI> Drink) he would <HI>cut</HI> the <HI>Bell-Ropes</HI> and <HI>smoke</HI> them!</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q> It is printed in the Edi∣tion of his Work by Barker &amp; Bill. London, 1616.</P>
<P>He concludes this <HI>bitter Blast</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>How widely different the Strains of the subsequent Parody:

The Stile of that puling Bard, Ambrose Phillips, is here ridiculed.</P>
<P>As is also that of the subsequent Imitation of Dr. Young.
<Q><L>Criticks avaunt, Tobacco is my Theme;</L>
<L>Tremble like Hornets at the blasting Steam.</L>
<L>And you, Court-Insects, flutter not too near</L>
<L>Its Light, nor buzz within the scorching Sphere.</L>
<L>Pollio, with flame like thine, my Verse inspire,</L>
<L>So shall the Muse from Smoke elicit Fire.</L>
<L>Coxcombs prefer the tickling Sting of Snuff;</L>
<L>Yet all their Claim to Wisdom is—a Puff:</L>
<L>Lord Foplin smokes not—for his Teeth afraid;</L>
<L>Sir Tawdry smokes not—for he wears Brocade.</L>
<L>Ladies, when Pipes are brought, affect to swoon,</L>
<L>They love no <HI>Smoke,</HI> except the <HI>Smoke</HI> of <HI>Town;</HI></L>
<L>But Courtiers hate the puffing Tribe—no Matter,</L>
<L>Strange if they love the Breath that cannot flatter!</L>
<L>It's Foes but shew their Ignorance; can he</L>
<L>Who scorns the <HI>Leaf</HI> of <HI>Knowledge, love</HI> the <HI>Tree?</HI></L>
<L>Yet Crouds remain, who still its Worth proclaim,</L>
<L>While some for Pleasure smoke, and some for Fame:</L>
<L>Fame, of our Actions universal Spring,</L>
<L>For which we drink, eat, sleep, <HI>smoke,</HI>—ev'ry Thing.</L></Q>
Both of these were written by Hawkins Browne, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P></NOTE> of his, his sul∣phureous Invective against this transmarine Weed,
<PB N="316" REF="334"/>
with the following Peroration: <Q>Have you not Reason then to be ashamed and to forbear this filthy Novelty, so basely grounded, so foolishly received, and so grossly mistaken in the right Use thereof! In your Abuse thereof sinning against God, harming yourselves both in Per∣sons and Goods, and taking also thereby (look to ye that take Snuff in Profusion!) the <HI>Marks</HI> and <HI>Notes</HI> of <HI>Vanity upon you;</HI> by the Custom thereof making yourselves to be wondered at by all foreign civil Nations, and by all Strangers that come among you, to be scorned and con∣temned; a Custom <HI>loathsome</HI> to the <HI>Eye, hateful</HI> to the <HI>Nose, harmful</HI> to the <HI>Brain, dangerous</HI> to the <HI>Lungs,</HI> and in the <HI>black stinking Fume</HI> thereof, neerest resembling the <HI>horrible Stygian Smoke</HI> of the <HI>Pit that is bottomless!</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="335"/>If even this small Specimen of our <HI>learned</HI> Monarch's Oratory, which seems well adapted to the Understanding of old Women, does not pre∣vail upon them all to break in Pieces their Tobac∣co Pipes and forego <HI>Smoking,</HI> it will perhaps be impossible to say what can.</P>
<P>The Subject, as his Majesty well observes, is <HI>Smoke,</HI> and no doubt many of his Readers will think <HI>his</HI> Arguments but the <HI>Fumes</HI> of an idle Brain, and it may be added too, of an empty Head!</P>

<P><HI>WITCH</HI> is derived from the Dutch <HI>Witchelen,</HI> which signifies <HI>whinnying</HI> and neighing like a Horse: In a secondary Sense, also to <HI>foretell</HI> and <HI>prophecy;</HI> because the Germans, as Tacitus informs us, used to divine and foretell Things to come by the <HI>whinnying</HI> and <HI>neighing</HI> of <HI>their Horses</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is a superstitious Custom among some People of <HI>nailing Horse-Shoes</HI> on the <HI>Threshold</HI> to keep out Witches.</P>

<P><PB N="318" REF="339"/>Perkins defines Witchcraft to be an Art serving for the working of Wonders by the Assistance of the Devil, <HI>so far</HI> as <HI>God</HI> will <HI>permit.</HI>—Delrio defines it to be an Art in which, by the Power of a Con∣tract entered into with the Devil, some Wonders are wrought, which pass the common Understanding of Men. Lib. 1. cap. 2. de Mag. disq. Vide Blount.</P>
<P>Witchcraft, in <HI>modern</HI> Estimation, is a Kind of Sorcery, (especially in Women) in which it is ridi∣culously supposed that an <HI>old Woman,</HI> by entering into a Contract with the Devil, is enabled in many Instances to change the Course of Nature, to raise Winds, perform Actions that require more than human Strength; and to afflict those that offend her with the sharpest Pains, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In those Times of more than Egyptian Dark∣ness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>He tells us also, that the last Instance of these frantic Exe∣cutions for Witchcraft in the North of Scotland, was in June 1727, as that in the South was at Paisly in 1696, where among others a Woman, young and handsome, suffered, and with a reply to her enquiring Friends, worthy a Roman Matron:</P>
<P>Being asked why she did not make a better Defence on her Trial, she answered, "My Persecutors have destroyed my Honour, and my Life is not now worth the Pains of defending." He goes on: "The last Instance of national Credulity on this Head was the Story of the Witches of Thurso, who tormenting for a long Time an honest Fellow under the usual form of Cats, at last provoked him so, that one Night he put them to flight with his broad Sword, and cut off the Leg of one less nimble than the Rest: On his taking it up, to his Amazement he found it belonged to a Female of his own Species, and next Morning discovered the Owner, an old Hag, with only the companion Leg to this."</P>
<P>But these Relations of almost obsolete Superstitions must never be thought a Reflection on this Country, as long as any Memory remains of the tragical End of the Poor People at <HI>Tring,</HI> who within a few Miles of our Capital itself, in 1751, fell a Sacrifice to the Belief of the Common People in Witches, or of that ridiculous Imposture in the Capital itself, in 1762, of the Cocklane Ghost, which found credit with all Ranks of People. Note, p. 145.</P>
<P>He farther observes, that at Edinburgh, there is still shewn a deep and wide Hollow beneath Calton Hill, the Place where those imaginary Criminals, Witches and Sorcerers, were burnt in less enlightened Times</P>
<P>The ingenious Artist Hogarth, in his <HI>Medley,</HI> represents with great Spirit of Satire, a <HI>Witch, sucked by</HI> a <HI>Cat,</HI> and flying on a <HI>Broomstick:</HI> It being said, as Trusler remarks, that the <HI>Familiar</HI> with whom a <HI>Witch converses, sucks</HI> her <HI>right Breast,</HI> in Shape of a <HI>little dun Cat,</HI> as smooth as a Mole, which, when it has sucked, the <HI>Witch</HI> is in a <HI>Kind</HI> of <HI>Trance.</HI> Vide Hogarth Moralized, p. 116.</P></NOTE>, when Ignorance and Superstition overspread
<PB N="319" REF="340"/>
the World, many severe Laws were made against Witches, by which, to the Disgrace of Humanity, great Numbers of innocent Persons, distressed with Poverty and Age, were brought to violent and untimely Ends.</P>
<P>The Witch-Act, a Disgrace to the Code of Eng∣lish Laws, was not repealed till the Year 1736!!!</P>
<P>Lord Verulam, that Sun of Science that rose upon our Island, and dispelled an hereditary Night of Ignorance and Superstition, gives us the fol∣lowing Reflections on Witches in the 10th Century of his Natural History: They form a fine Contrast to the narrow and bigotted Ideas of the <HI>royal Author</HI> of the Demonology.</P>
<P>"Men may not too rashly believe the Confession of Witches, nor yet the Evidence against them: For the Witches themselves are <HI>imaginative,</HI> and believe oftentimes they do that which they do not:
<PB N="320" REF="341"/>
And People are credulous in that Point, and ready to impute Accidents and natural Operations to Witchcraft—It is worthy the observing, that both in antient and late Times (as in the Thessalian Witches and the Meetings of Witches that have been recorded by so many <HI>late</HI> Confessions) the great Wonders which they tell, of <HI>carrying</HI> in the <HI>Aire, transforming themselves</HI> into <HI>other Bodies,</HI> &amp;c. are still reported to be wrought, not by <HI>Incantation</HI> or <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> but by <HI>Ointments</HI> and <HI>anointing</HI> themselves <HI>all over</HI> —This may justly move a Man to think that these Fables are the Effects of <HI>Ima∣gination;</HI> for it is certain that Ointments do all (if they be laid on any Thing thick) by stopping of the Pores, shut in the Vapours, and send them to the Head extremely; and for the particular Ingre∣dients of those magical Ointments, it is like they are opiate and soporiferous: For anointing of the Forehead, Neck, Feet, Back-bone, we know is used for procuring dead Sleeps. And if any Man say, that this Effect would be better done by inward Potions; Answer may be made, that the Medi∣cines which go to the <HI>Ointments</HI> are so strong, that if they were used <HI>inwards,</HI> they would kill those that use them; and therefore they work potently though <HI>outwards.</HI>" He tells us elsewhere;</P>
<P>"The Ointment, that Witches use, is reported to be made of the <HI>Fat</HI> of <HI>Children,</HI> digged out of their <HI>Graves;</HI> of the <HI>Juices</HI> of <HI>Smallage</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Olla</HI> autem omnium <HI>Maleficarum</HI> commmune solet esse <HI>Instru∣mentum,</HI> quo <HI>succos, herbas, vermes</HI> et <HI>exta decoquant,</HI> atque ea venefica dape ignavos ad vota alliciunt, et instar bullientis ollae, na∣vium &amp; equitum aut Cursorum excitant celeritatem.

in whatever House a Cat died, all the Family shaved their Eye-brows.

also, he observes farther, the faint traces of these antient Customs in another superstitious Method of proving a Witch; it was done by weighing the suspected Party against the Church Bible, which if they outweighed, they were innocent; but on the contrary, if the Bible proved the heaviest, they were instantly con∣demned.—However absurd and foolish these superstitious Customs may seem to the present Age, little more, he observes, than a Century ago, there were several unhappy Wretches, not only apprehended, but also cruelly burnt alive for Witchcraft, on very little better Evidence than the above ridiculous Trials. Several great and learned Men have also taken vast Pains to convince the doubting Age of the real Existence of Witches, and the Justness of their Execu∣tions: But so very unbelieving we are grown at present in these and such like Stories, as to con∣sider them only as the idle Phantoms of a fertile Imagination.</Q></P>

<P>The fourth Sunday in Lent, says Wheatly on the Common Prayer, is generally called <HI>Midlent,</HI> though Bishop Sparrow and some others term it <HI>Dominica Refectionis,</HI> the Sunday of Refreshment, the Reason perhaps is because the Gospel for the Day treats of our Saviour's feeding miraculously Five Thousand, or else from the first Lesson in the Morning, which gives us the Story of Joseph's entertaining his Brethren.—He is of Opinion, that the Appointment of these Scriptures upon this Day, might probably give the first Rise to a Custom still retained in many Parts of England, and well known by the Name of <HI>Midlenting, or Mothering.</HI></P>
<P>Bailey supposes <HI>Mothering,</HI> a Custom still retained in many Places of England, of visiting Parents on Mid-Lent Sunday, to have been so called from the Respect paid in old Time to the Mother-Church.

<P>MR. Blount derives this Word from the French <HI>Pleige,</HI> a Surety, or Gage.—To pledge one drinking is generally thought to have had its Origin thus: When the Danes bore sway in this Land, if a Native drank, they would sometimes stab him with a Dagger or Knife; hereupon Peo∣ple would not drink in Company,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was an antient Custom called a <HI>Bid-Ale</HI> or <HI>Bidder-Ale,</HI> from the Saxon <HI>Bidden</HI> to pray or supplicate, when any honest Man decayed in his Estate, was set up again by the liberal Benevolence and Contributions of Friends at a Feast, to which those Friends were bid or invited. It was most used in the West of England, and in some Counties called a <HI>Help Ale.</HI> Such Instances of Benevolence are retained in the North.—At the Christening Entertainments of many of the poor People (who are unfortunate enough to provide more <HI>Mouths</HI> than they find <HI>Meat</HI> for) great Collections are made oftentimes by the Guests, and such as will far more than defray the Expences of the Feast of which they have been partaking.</NOTE> unless some one present would be their <HI>Pledge</HI> or Surety, that they should receive no Hurt, whilst they were in their Draught.</P>
<P>Others affirm the true sense of the Word to be this: That if the Person drank unto, was not disposed to drink himself, he would put another for a Pledge to do it for him, otherwise the Party who began, would take it ill.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="361"/>Mr. Strutt confirms the former Opinion in the following Words: The old Manner of Pledging each other when they drank<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Such great Drinkers, says he also, were the Danes, who were in England in the Time of <HI>Edgar,</HI> and so much did their bad Examples prevail with the English, that he, by the Advice of Dunstan, Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, put down many Ale-Houses, suffering only one to be in a Village, or small Town: And he also further or∣dained, that <HI>Pins</HI> or <HI>Nails</HI> should be fastened into the <HI>drinking Cups</HI> and <HI>Horns at stated distances,</HI> and <HI>whosoever</HI> should <HI>drink be∣yond those Marks at one Draught,</HI> should be obnoxious to a severe Punishment. This was to prevent the pernicious Custom of Drink∣ing.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P><HI>Bumpers</HI> are of great Antiquity.— Thus Paulus Warnefridus is cited in Du Cange's Glossary, telling us, in lib. 5. de gestis Langobard. Cap. 2. <Q>Cumque ii qui diversi generis potiones ei a Rege deferebant, de verbo Regis eum rogarent, ut <HI>totam fialam</HI> biberent, ille in honorem Regis se <HI>totam</HI> bibere promit∣tens, parum aquae libabat de argenteo Calice.</Q> Vide Martial. lib. 1. Ep. 72. lib. 8. 51, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That it is good to be <HI>drunk once a Month,</HI> says the Author of the Vulgar Errors, is a common Flattery of Sensuality, supporting itself upon Physic, and the healthful Effects of Inebriation.—It is a striking Instance of <Q>the doing <HI>ill,</HI> as we say, that <HI>good</HI> may come of it.</Q>—It <HI>may</HI> happen that Inebriation, by causing Vomiting, may cleanse the Stomack, &amp;c. but it seems a very dangerous Kind of Dose. and of which the <HI>"repetatur hausius,"</HI> too quickly repeat∣ed, will evince, that Men may pervert that, which Nature intend∣ed for a <HI>Cordial,</HI> into the most baneful of all <HI>Poisons.</HI> It has been vulgarly called, "giving a Fillip to Nature."</P>
<P>Dr. Browne is of Opinion, that the human Faces described in Ale-House <HI>Signs,</HI> in Coats of Arms, &amp;c. for the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon,</HI> are Reliques of Paganism, and that these Visages originally impli∣ed <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Diana.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chequers,</HI> at this Time a common Sign of a Public-House, was originally intended for a Kind of <HI>Draught-Board,</HI> called <HI>Tables,</HI> and shewed that there that Game might be played. From their Colour, which was red, and the Similarity to a <HI>Lattice,</HI> it was corruptly called the <HI>Red Lettuce,</HI> which Word is frequently used by antient Writers to signify an <HI>Ale-House.</HI> Vide Antiq. Repertor. Vol. I. p. 50.</P></NOTE> was thus: The Person who was going to drink, asked any one of the Company that sat next him, whether he
<PB N="341" REF="362"/>
would pledge him, on which he answering that he would, held up his Knife or Sword, to guard him whilst he drank (for while a Man is drinking he necessarily is in an unguarded Posture, exposed to the treacherous Stroke of some hidden or secret Enemy).</P>
<P>This Custom, as it is said, first took rise from the Death of young King Edward, (called the Martyr) Son to Edgar, who was by the Contri∣vance of Elfrida, his Step-Mother, traiterously stabbed in the Back as he was drinking.</P>
<P>Mr. Strutt's Authority here is William of Malms∣bury, and he observes from the Delineation he gives, (and it must be observed that his <HI>Plates,</HI> being <HI>Copies</HI> from antient illuminated <HI>Manuscripts,</HI> are of unquestionable Authority) that it seems perfectly well to agree with the reported Custom; the middle Figure is addressing himself to his Companion, who (seems to) tell him that he pledges him, holding up his Knife in Token of his readiness to assist and protect him. Vol 1st. p. 49. of Manners and Customs. Anglo. Saxon Aera.</P>
<P>The antient Greeks and Romans used at their Meals to <HI>make Libations, pour out</HI> and even <HI>drink Wine</HI> in Honour of the Gods.—The classical Writings abound with Proofs of this.</P>
<P>The Grecian Poets and Historians, as well as the Roman Writers, have transmitted to us Ac∣counts also of the grateful Custom of <HI>drinking to the Health</HI> of our <HI>Benefactors</HI> and of our <HI>Acquaintance.</HI></P>

<BIBL>Plauti Asinaria.</BIBL>
<P>Our Word <HI>Tost,</HI> or <HI>Toast,</HI> signifying to name, or begin a new Health, concerning the Etymology of which all our Dictionary Writers are silent, is a <HI>Cant Word.</HI> I find it in the <HI>canting Voca∣bulary.</HI> Who tosts now?

<P>Enquiring frequently both of <HI>Books</HI> and <HI>Men,</HI> why the <HI>Hundred</HI> should in some Articles imply <HI>Five,</HI> in others <HI>Six Score,</HI> I found at last, in the learned Dr. Hicke's Thesaurus, an Answer to a Question which I had often asked before in vain.—I gather from him that the Norwegians and Islandic People used a Method of numbering peculiar to themselves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Notetur etiam Norvegis &amp; Islandis peculiarem numerandi ra∣tionem in usu esse per additionem Vocum <HI>Tolfroedr, Tolfroed,</HI> vel <HI>Tolfraet,</HI> quae <HI>decem</HI> significare faciunt duodecim; Centum, Centum et Viginti.—Mille, Mille &amp; 200, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The Doctor observes that this <HI>Tolfraedic</HI> (for I am obliged to make a new Word in translating him) Mode of Computation by the <HI>greater</HI> Decads, or <HI>Tens,</HI> which contain Twelve Units, is still retained amongst us in reckoning certain Things by the number <HI>Twelve,</HI> which the Swedes call <HI>Dusin,</HI> the French Douzain, and we <HI>Dozen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the Custom of <HI>BLESSING PERSONS</HI> when they <HI>SNEEZE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE very learned Author of the Vulgar Er∣rors, has left us a great Deal on this Sub∣ject.—It is generally believed that the Custom of <HI>Saluting</HI> or <HI>Blessing</HI> upon that Motion, derives its Origin from a Disease, wherein such as <HI>sneezed</HI> died.—Carolus Sigonius, in his History of Italy, mentions a Pestilence in the Time of Gregory the Great, that proved mortal to such as <HI>sneezed.</HI></P>
<P>The Custom has an elder Aera: Apulcius men∣tions it 300 Years before.—Pliny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is said, that Tiberius the Emperor, otherwise a very four Man, would perform this Rite most punctually to others, and expect the same from others to himself.</NOTE> also in the Problem, "Cur sternutantes salutantur."

<P>The History of it will run much higher, if we take in the Rabbinical Account<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><Q>That sneezing was a mortal Sign even from the first Man; until it was taken off by the special Supplication of Jacob. From whence as a thankful Acknowledgement, this Salutation first be∣gan, and was after continued by the Expression of <HI>Tobim Chaiim,</HI> or vita bona, by standers by, upon all Occasions of <HI>sneezing.</HI></Q>
<BIBL>Buxtorf Lex. Chald.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Dr. Browne himself supposes that the Ground of this antient Custom was the Opinion the An∣tients held of Sternutation, which they generally conceived to be a <HI>good Sign</HI> or a <HI>bad,</HI> and so upon this Motion accordingly used a <HI>Salve</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as a Gratulation for the one, and a De∣precation from the other.</P>
<P>He then gives their <HI>Physical</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sneezing</HI> being properly a Motion of the Brain suddenly expel∣ling through the Nostrils what is offensive to it, it cannot but afford some Evidence of its Vigour, and therefore saith Aristotle, they that hear it "<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>." honour it as something sacred, and a Sign of Sanity in the diviner Part, and this he illus∣trates from the Practice of Physicians, who in Persons near Death use <HI>Sternutatories,</HI> (Medicines to provoke <HI>sneezing</HI>) when if the Faculty arise, and Sternutation ensues, they conceive Hopes of Life and <HI>with Gratulation</HI> receive the <HI>Signs</HI> of Safety.</NOTE> <HI>Notions</HI> of it.— Hippocrates says, that sneezing cures the Hiccup, is profitable to parturient Women, in Lethargies,

Apoplexies, Catalepsies, and Coma's: It is bad and pernicious in Diseases of the Chest, in the Beginning of Catarrhs, in new and tender Con∣ceptions, for then it endangers Abortion.</P>
<P>To these succeed their <HI>superstitious</HI> and <HI>augurial</HI> ones. St. Austin tells us, that the Ancients were wont to go to Bed again if they <HI>sneezed</HI> while they put on their <HI>Shoe.</HI> Aristotle has a Problem, "why sneezing from Noon to Midnight was <HI>good,</HI> but from Night to Noon <HI>unlucky.</HI>" Eusta∣thius upon Homer observes, that sneezing to the <HI>Left</HI> was <HI>unlucky,</HI> but <HI>prosperous</HI> to the <HI>Right.</HI> See Plutarch in the Life of Themistocles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Themistocles sacrificed in his Galley before the Battle of Xerxes, and one of the Assistants upon the <HI>right Hand sneezed;</HI> Euphrantides, the Southsayer, presaged the Victory of the Greeks, and the Overthrow of the Persians.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I shall give the whole of his Conclusion: "Thus we may perceive the Custom to be more antient than is commonly thought;—and these Opinions hereof in all Ages, not any one Disease to have been the Occasion of this salute and Deprecation: arising at first from this vehement and affrighting Motion of the Brain, from whence some finding dependant Effects to ensue: Others ascribing hereto as a Cause, what perhaps but <HI>casually</HI> or <HI>inconnex∣edly</HI> succeeded; they might proceed into forms of Speeches, <HI>felicitating</HI> the <HI>good</HI> and <HI>deprecating</HI> the <HI>evil</HI> to <HI>follow.</HI>"</P>

<P>DOctor Browne leaves me little more on this Subject, than the easy and agreeable Task of making him speak concisely and in <HI>plain English.</HI></P>
<P>Nazianzen, says he, seems to imply in the subse∣quent translated Verses, that the <HI>Rose,</HI> from a <HI>natu∣ral Property,</HI> has been made the <HI>Symbol of Silence.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Utque latet Rosa verna suo putamine clausa,</L>
<L>Sic os vincla ferat, validisque arctetur habenis,</L>
<L>Indicatque suis prolixa silentia labris.</L></Q>
<P>Hence it should seem when we <HI>desire</HI> to <HI>confine our Words,</HI> we commonly say, "they are spoken under the Rose."</P>
<P>There is a Propriety in this Expression also, if we mean only in Society at convivial Entertain∣ments, where it was an antient Custom to wear Chaplets of <HI>Roses</HI> about the Head.</P>
<P>The Germans have a Custom of describing a <HI>Rose</HI> in the Ceiling over the Table<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I shall favour my Reader here with another curious Observation of the learned Author of the Vulgar Errors: <HI>Coral</HI> was thought to preserve and fasten the Teeth in Men, yet is used in Children to make an easier Passage for them; hence that well-known Toy, with Bells, &amp;c. and <HI>Coral</HI> at the end, which is generally suspended from their Necks. This Custom is supposed with the greatest Probabi∣lity to have had its Origin in an antient Superstition, which consi∣dered it as an <HI>Amulet</HI> or Defensative against Fascination.—For this we have the Authority of Pliny, in the following Words: <Q>Aru∣spices <HI>religiosum Coralli gestamen amoliendis periculis</HI> arbitran∣tur; Et <HI>Surculi Infantiae alligati</HI> tutelam habere creduntur.</Q></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>SILLY HOW,</HI> that is, the holy, or fortunate <HI>CAP</HI> or <HI>HOOD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>VARIOUS were the Superstitions, about half a Century<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Scotland, says the learned and modest Author of the Glos∣sary to Douglas' Virgil, the Women call a <HI>haly</HI> or <HI>sely how, (i. e.</HI> holy or fortunate Cap, or Hood) a Film, or Membrane stretched over the Heads of Children new born, which is nothing else but a Part of that which covers the Foetus in the Womb; and they give out that Children so born will be very fortunate. In Verbo <HI>How.</HI></P>
<P>An Instance of great Fortune in one born with this <HI>Coif</HI> is given by Aelius Lampridius, in the History of Diadumenos, who came afterwards to the Sovereign Dignity of the Empire. This Super∣stition prevailed much in the primitive Ages of the Church. St. Chrysostom in several of his Homilies inveighs against it: He is particularly severe against one Praetus, a Clergyman, who being desirous of being <HI>fortunate,</HI> bought such a <HI>Coif</HI> of a <HI>Midwife.</HI> See Athenian Oracle.</P>
<P>It would be giving the Reins up to Fancy altogether to suppose that the present remarkable <HI>black Spots</HI> in the Wigs of those of the highest Orders of the Law, owe their Origin to this antient Super∣stition; but I have no Kind of Doubt but that the Word <HI>Howdy,</HI> used in the North for a <HI>Midwife,</HI> and which I take to be a dimi∣nitive of <HI>How,</HI> is derived from this obsolete Opinion of old Wo∣men. An Etymon I have heard of <HI>Howdy,</HI> that is, "How do ye," is not unlike the "All Eggs under" of Swift, and forcibly satirizes that Licentiousness of Fancy in which many Philologists have in∣dulged themselves.</P></NOTE> ago, concerning a certain mem∣branous Covering, commonly called the <HI>Silly How,</HI>

that was sometimes found about the Heads of new-born Infants.—It was preserved with great Care, not only as medical in Diseases, but also as contributing to the good Fortune of the Infant and others.—This, says Dr Browne, is no more than the Continuation of a Superstition that is of very remote Antiquity. Thus we read in the Life of Antoninus, by Spartianus, that Children are sometimes born with this natural <HI>Cap,</HI> which <HI>Midwives</HI> were wont to sell to credulous Lawyers, who held an Opinion that it contributed to their Promotion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"But to speak strictly, continues our Author, the Effect is natural, and thus to be conceived, the Infant hath three Teguments, or membranous Filmes which cover it in the Womb, i. e. the <HI>Corion, Amnios</HI> and <HI>Allantois;</HI> the <HI>Corion</HI> is the outward Membrane, wherein are implanted the Veins, Arteries, and umbilical Vessels, whereby its Nourishment is conveyed: The <HI>Allantois</HI> a thin Coat seated under the Corion, wherein are received the watery Separa∣tions conveyed by the <HI>Urachus,</HI> that the Acrimony thereof should not offend the Skin. The <HI>Amnios</HI> is a general Investment, contain∣ing the sudorous, or thin Serosity perspirable through the Skin. Now about the Time when the Infant breaketh these Coverings, it sometimes carrieth with it about the Head a <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Amnios,</HI> or neerest Coat; which saith Spiegelius, either proceedeth from the Toughness of the Membrane or Weaknesse of the Infant that <HI>can∣cot get clear thereof,</HI> and therefore herein Significations are natural and concluding upon the Infant, but not to be extended unto magical Signalities or any other Person."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>It is called <HI>Ignis Fatuus,</HI> or <HI>foolish Fire,</HI> because it only <HI>feareth</HI> Fools.

<P>THIS <HI>Appearance,</HI> called in Latin, <HI>Ignis Fatuus,</HI> has long been an article in the Catalogue of popular Superstitions. It is said to be chiefly seen in Summer Nights, frequenting Meadows, Marshes, and other moist Places.—It has been thought by some to arise from a viscous Exhalation, which being kindled in the Air, re∣flects
<PB N="370" REF="391"/>
a Sort of thin Flame in the Dark without any sensible Heat. It is often found flying along Rivers and Hedges, because, as it is conjectured, it meets there with a Stream of Air to direct it.</P>
<P>Philosophers are much divided in their Solution of this Phenomenon. Sir Isaac Newton says it is a Vapour shining without Heat, and that there is the same Difference between this Vapour and Flame, as between rotten Wood shining without Heat and burning Coals of Fire.</P>
<P>Others suppose it to be some <HI>nocturnal flying Insect:</HI> Indeed they have gone so many different Ways in pursuit of this Wanderer, that, according to the popular Notion of its conducting into Bogs and other Precipices, some of them must have been misled and bewildered by it.—We may follow them however as far as we please in this Paper Pursuit without any Danger.</P>
<P><HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iana</HI> has given us an Accout of the famous Indian Lanthorn Fly, published amongst her Insects at <HI>Surinam.</HI> It has a Hood▪ or Bladder on its Head, which gives a Light like a Lanthorn in the Night, but by Day-light is clear and transparent, curiously adorned with Stripes of Red or Green Colour.— One may read Writing of tolerable large Character by it at Night.—The Creature, it is said, can con∣tract or dilate the Hood or Bladder over its Head at Pleasure.—They hide all their Light when taken, but when at Liberty afford it plentifully.</P>
<P>It inclines one to think that the Appearance un∣der Consideration is no more than the shining of some Night-flying Insect, when we are informed, that they give Proof as it were of Sense, by avoid∣ing Objects—that they often go in a Direction con∣trary
<PB N="371" REF="392"/>
to the Wind—that they often seem extinct, and then shine again.—Their passing along a few Feet above the Ground or Surface of the Water, agrees with the Motion of some Insect in quest of Prey; as also their settling on a Sudden, and rising again immediately<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I subjoin what will perhaps be thought a curious Extract con∣cerning the Appearance commonly called a <HI>Falling Star,</HI> from Dr. Charlton's Paradoxes—<Q>It is, says he, the <HI>Nocturnal Pollu∣tion</HI> of some <HI>plethorical</HI> and <HI>wanton Star,</HI> or rather <HI>Excrement blown from the Nostrils</HI> of some <HI>Rheumatic Planet,</HI> falling upon Plains and Sheep Pastures, of an <HI>obscure Red</HI> or <HI>brown Tawney;</HI> in Consistence like a <HI>Gelly</HI> and so trembling if touched, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Thoughts</HI> in the above Passage are perhaps the <HI>quaintest</HI> that can be found in any Language.</P>
<P><HI>Haggs,</HI> says Blount, are said to be made of <HI>Saveat,</HI> or some other Vapour issuing out of the Head; a not unusual Sight among us when we ride by Night in the Summer-time: They are extin∣guished like Flames by shaking the Horses' Manes. But I believe rather it is only a Vapour reflecting Light, but <HI>sat</HI> and <HI>sturdy,</HI> compacted about the Manes of Horses or Men's Hair. Vide Blount in Verbo.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some indeed have affirmed that <HI>Ignes Fatui</HI> are never seen but in Salt Marshes, or other boggy Places. On the other Hand it is proved that they have been seen flying over Fields, Heaths, and other dry Places.</P>
<P>I am informed in Boreman's second Volume of his Description of a great Variety of Animals, Ve∣getables, &amp;c &amp;c. that a respectable Person in Hert∣fordshire<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>At Astley, seven Miles from Worcester, three Gentlemen saw one of these Appearances in a Garden about Nine o'Clock in a dark Night.—At first they imagined it to be some Country Fellow with a Lanthorn, till approaching within about six Yards, it sud∣denly disappeared.—It became visible again in a dry Field thirty or forty Yards off—it disappeared as suddenly a second Time, and was seen again a hundred Yards off.—Whether it passed over the Hedge, or went through it, could not be observed, for it dis∣appeared as it passed from Field to Field.</P>
<P>At another Time when one approached within ten or twelve Yards, it seemed to pack off as in a fright.</P></NOTE>, presuming upon his Knowledge of the
<PB N="372" REF="393"/>
Grounds about his House, was tempted one dark Night to follow one of these Lights, which he saw flying over a Piece of fallow Ground.—It led him over a plowed Field, flying and twisting about from Place to Place—sometimes it would sudden∣ly disappear, and as suddenly appear again.—It once made directly to a Hedge, when it came near, it mounted over, and he <HI>lost Sight,</HI> after a full <HI>Hour's Chace.</HI>—In his return to his House, he saw it again, but was too fatigued to think of renewing the Pursuit. This <HI>Light</HI> is said also to have been observed to stand still as well as to move, and sometimes seemed <HI>fixed</HI> on the Surface on the Water.—We are informed that in Italy, two Kinds of these Lights have been discovered; one on the Mountains, the other on the Plains.—The com∣mon People call them <HI>Cularsi,</HI> because they look upon them as Birds, the Belly and other Parts of which are resplendent like the <HI>Pyraustae,</HI> or Fire-Flies.</P>
<P>Mr. Bradley, F. R. S. supposes the <HI>Will</HI> with the <HI>Wisp</HI> to be no more than a <HI>Group of small enlightened Insects.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Fr. Willoughby and Mr. Ray are of Opi∣nion, that the Ignis Fatuus is nothing but the shining of some Night-flying Insect.—Dr. Derham was of Opinion, they were fired Vapours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a Fire, some Times seen flying in the Night, like a Dragon: (who has seen a Dragon that may with Propriety speak to the Resemblance?)

<P>MEN have long availed themselves of the <HI>Antipathy one Cock</HI> shews to <HI>another,</HI> and have encouraged that natural hatred with Arts that disgrace human Reason.—The Origin of this Sport is said to be derived from the Athenians on the following Occasion: When Themistocles was marching his Army against the Persians, he by the Way espying two Cocks fighting, caused his Army to behold them, and made the following Speech to them: "Behold, these do not fight for their House∣hold Gods, for the Monuments of their Ancestors, nor for Glory, nor for Liberty, nor for the Safety of their Children, but only because the one will not give Way unto the other." This so encou∣raged the Grecians, that they fought strenuously, and obtained the Victory over the Persians; upon which Cock-fighting was by a particular Law or∣dained to be annually practised by the Athenians; and hence was the Original of the Sport in England derived—Thus<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I do not find his Authority for this among the Antients.

<HEAD>Of the Vulgar Superstitions concerning the <HI>MOON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Moon, the antient Object of idolatrous Worship, has in later Times composed an Article in the Creed of popular Superstition: The Moon, Dr. Johnson tells us, has great influence in vulgar Philosophy. In his Memory, he observes, it was a Precept annually given in one of the Eng∣lish Almanacks, to kill Hogs when the Moon was increasing, and the Bacon would prove the better in boiling.</P>
<P>The common People, Bailey tells us, in some Counties in England are accustomed at the Prime of the Moon to say: "It is a fine Moon, God bless her," which some imagine to proceed from a blind Zeal, retained from the antient Irish, who worship∣ped the Moon, or from a Custom in Scotland, (particularly in the Highlands) where the Women make a Curtesy to the New Moon: And some English Women still retain a Touch of this Genti∣lism, who getting up upon and sitting astride on a Gate or Stile, the first Night of the New Moon say:
<Q><L>"All hail to the Moon, all hail to thee,</L>
<L>I prithee good Moon declare to me.</L>
<L>This Night who my Husband shall be."</L></Q></P>
<P>The antient Druids had their superstitious Rites at the Changes of the Moon.—The <HI>hornedness</HI> of the New Moon is still faintly considered by the vulgar as an Omen with Regard to the Weather.</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>SECOND SIGHT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE learned Author of the Rambler having favoured the Public with his Thoughts on this singular Kind of Superstition, and having so lately visited the Scene of its declining Influence, it will be unnecessary to apologize for using his own Words on the Subject: "We should have had little claim, says he, to the Praise of Curiosity, if we had not endeavoured with particular Attention to examine the Question of the <HI>Second Sight.</HI> Of an Opinion received for Centuries by a whole Nation, and supposed to be confirmed through its whole Descent, by a series of successive Facts, it is desirable that the Truth should be established, or the Fallacy detected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second Sight</HI> is an Impression made either by the Mind upon the Eye, or by the Eye upon the Mind, by which Things distant or future are perceived, and seen as if they were present. A Man on a Journey far from Home falls from his Horse, another who is perhaps at work about the House,
<PB N="382" REF="403"/>
sees him bleeding upon the Ground, commonly with a Landscape of the Place where the Accident befalls him. Another Seer driving Home his Cat∣tle, or wandering in Idleness, or musing in the Sun∣shine, is suddenly surprized by the Appearance of a bridal Ceremony, or funeral Procession, and counts the Mourners or Attendants, of whom, if he knows them, he relates the Names, if he knows them not, he can describe the Dresses. Things distant are seen at the Instant when they happen. Of Things future I know not that there is any Rule for determining the Time between the Sight and the Event.</P>
<P>This receptive Faculty, for Power it cannot be called, is neither voluntary nor constant. The Appearances have no Dependence upon Choice: they cannot be summoned, detained, or recalled. The Impression is sudden, and the Effect often painful.</P>
<P>By the term Second Sight, seems to be meant a Mode of seeing, superadded to that which Nature generally bestows. In the Earse it is called Taisch; which signifies likewise a Spectre, or a Vision. I know not, nor is it likely that the Highlanders ever examined, whether by Taisch, used for the Second Sight, they mean the Power of seeing, or the Thing seen.</P>
<P>I do not find it to be true, as it is reported, that to the Second Sight nothing is presented but Phantoms of Evil. Good seems to have the same Proportion in those visionary Scenes, as it obtains in real Life: almost all remarkable Events have evil for their Basis; and are either Miseries incurred,
<PB N="383" REF="404"/>
or Miseries escaped. Our Sense is so much strong∣er of what we suffer, than of what we enjoy, that the Ideas of pain predominate in almost every Mind. What is Recollection but a Revival of Vexations, or History but a Record of Wars, Treasons, and Calamities? Death, which is consi∣dered as the greatest Evil, happens to all. The greatest good, be it what it will, is the Lot but of a Part.</P>
<P>That they should often see Death is to be ex∣pected; because Death is an Event frequent and important. But they see likewise more pleasing Incidents. A Gentleman told me, that when he had once gone far from his own Island, one of his labouring Servants predicted his Return, and de∣scribed the Livery of his Attendant, which he had never worn at Home; and which had been, with∣out any previous Design, occasionally given him.</P>
<P>Our Desire of Information was keen, and our Inquiry frequent. Mr. Boswell's Frankness and Gaiety made every Body communicative; and we heard many Tales of these airy Shows, with more or less Evidence and Distinctness.</P>
<P>It is the common Talk of the Lowland Scots, that the Notion of the Second Sight is wearing away with other Superstitions; and that its Reality is no longer supposed, but by the grossest People. How far its Prevalence ever extended, or what Ground it has lost, I know not. The Islanders of all degrees, whether of Rank or Understanding, universally admit it, except the Ministers, who universally deny it, and are suspected to deny it, in Consequence of a System, against Conviction.
<PB N="384" REF="405"/>
One of them honestly told me, that he came to Sky with a Resolution not to believe it.</P>
<P>Strong Reasons for Incredulity will readily occur. This Faculty of seeing Things out of sight is local, and commonly useless It is a Breach of the common Order of Things, without any visible Reason or perceptible Benefit. It is ascribed only to a People very little enlightened; and among them, for the most Part, to the mean and the ignorant.</P>
<P>To the Confidence of these Objections it may be replied, that by presuming to determine what is fit, and what is beneficial, they presuppose more Knowledge of the universal System than Man has attained; and therefore depend upon Principles too complicated and extensive for our Comprehen∣sion; and that there can be no Security in the Consequence, when the Premises are not under∣stood; that the Second Sight is only wonderful because it is rare, for, considered in itself, it in∣volves no more difficulty than dreams, or perhaps than the regular Exercises of the cogitative Facul∣ty; that a general Opinion of communicative Im∣pulses, or visionary representations, has prevailed in all Ages and all Nations; that particular Instan∣ces have been given, with such Evidence, as neither Bacon nor Bayle has been able to resist; that sudden Impressions, which the Event has ve∣rified, have been felt by more than own or pub∣lish them; that the Second Sight of the Hebrides implies only the local Frequency of a Power, which is nowhere totally unknown; and that where we are unable to decide by antecedent Reason, we must be content to yield to the Force of Testimony.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="406"/>By pretension to Second Sight, no profit was ever sought or gained. It is an involuntary Af∣fection, in which neither Hope nor Fear are known to have any Part. Those who profess to feel it, do not boast of it as a Privilege, nor are considered by others as advantageously distinguished. They have no temptation to feign; and their hearers have no motive to encourage the Imposture.</P>
<P>To talk with any of these Seers is not easy. There is one in Sky, with whom we would have gladly conversed; but he was very gross and ig∣norant, and knew no English. The Proportion in these Countries of the Poor to the Rich is such, that if we suppose the Quality to be accidental, it can very rarely happen to a Man of Education; and yet on such Men it has sometimes fallen. There is now a Second Sighted Gentleman in the Highlands, who complains of the Terrors to which he is exposed.</P>
<P>The foresight of the Seers is not always pre∣science: they are impressed with Images, of which the Event only shews them the Meaning. They tell what they have seen to others, who are at that Time not more knowing than themselves, but may become at last very adequate Witnesses, by comparing the Narrative with its Verification.</P>
<P>To collect sufficient Testimonies for the Satis∣faction of the Publick, or ourselves, would have required more Time than we could bestow. There is, against it, the seeming Analogy of Things con∣fusedly seen, and little understood; and for it, the indistinct Cry of national Persuasion, which may be perhaps resolved at last into Prejudice and Tra∣dition. I never could advance my Curiosity to
<PB N="386" REF="407"/>
conviction; but came away at last only willing to beleive."</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>DREAMS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>EVERY Dream, according to Wolfius, takes its Rise from some Sensation, and is continu∣ed by the Succession of Phantasms in the Mind: His Reasons are, that when we dream, we imagine something, or the Mind produces Phantasms; but no Phantasms can arise in the Mind without a previous Sensation, hence neither can a Dream arise without some previous Sensation.</P>
<P>Lord Bacon observes, that the Interpretation of natural Dreams has been much laboured, but mixed with numerous Extravagancies, and adds, that at present it stands not upon its best Founda∣tion. It may be observed that in our Days, except amongst the most ignorant and vulgar, the whole imaginary Structure is fallen to the Ground.</P>
<P>Physicians seem to be the only Persons at pre∣sent who interpret Dreams: frightful Dreams are perhaps always Indications of some violent Oppres∣sion of Nature. Hippocrates has may curious Observations on Dreams: Ennius of old, has made that very sensible Remark, that what Men studied and pondered in the Day Time, the same they dreamed on at Night. I suppose there are few who cannot from their own Experience assent to the Truth of his Observation.</P>

All our Antiquaries (that I have had the Opportunity of consulting) are silent concerning the <HI>first of April.</HI> It owes its Beginning probably to a <HI>Removal,</HI> which was of frequent Use in the crowded Roman Calendar, and of which I have just now adduced a seemingly apposite Instance. There is nothing hardly (says the Author of the Essay to retrieve the antient Celtic,) that will bear a clearer Demonstration, than that the primitive Christians by Way of con∣ciliating the Pagans to a better Worship, humoured their Prejudices by yielding to a Conformity of Names<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Writer contends, that the ancient Druidical Religion of Britain and the Gauls, had its <HI>Pope,</HI> its <HI>Cardinals,</HI> its Bishops, its Deacons, &amp;c.</NOTE>, and even of Customs, where they did not essentially interfere with the Fundamentals of the Gospel Doctrine. This was done in Order to quiet their Possession and to secure their Tenure:
<PB N="400" REF="421"/>
An admirable Expedient and extremely fit in those barbarous Times, to prevent the People from re∣turning to their old Religion.

The Continuance of Customs (especially droll ones, which suit the gross Taste of the Multitude), after the original Cause of them has ceased, is a great but no uncommon Absur∣dity.</P>

<L>But to the Field a Bag of Hemp-seed brought;</L>
<L>I scattered round the Seed on every Side,</L>
<L>And three Times in a trembling Accent cry'd,</L>
<L>This Hemp-seed with my Virgin Hand I sow,</L>
<L>Who shall my True-love be, the Crop shall mow.</L></Q>
<P>Our rural Virgins in the North, are said to use some singular Rites in fasting what they call St. Agnes' Fast, for the purpose of discovering their future Husbands.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="427"/>Mr. Strutt, speaking of the <HI>Sports</HI> of <HI>Children</HI> in his English Aera, tells us, <Q>Their Amusements were much the same with those at present play∣ed over by the young Lads of this Age, as <HI>trundling Hoops, Blind-man's Buff,</HI> playing with <HI>Tops,</HI> shooting with <HI>Bows</HI> at Marks, and swim∣ming on Bladders; nay the still younger Sort, playing with <HI>Whirligigs</HI> and <HI>Paper Wind-Mills,</HI> all which are found in an <HI>old Missal</HI> in the Pos∣session of John Ives, <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR></Q> P. 99</P>
<P>It is said, if I mistake not, in Hawksworth's Voy∣ges, that the <HI>Top</HI> is known among the Indians, some of whom pointed to our Sailors, who seemed to wonder at seeing it amongst them; that in order to make it spin, they should lash it with a Whip. —<HI>Blindman's Buff</HI> is thus described by Gay:
<Q><L>As once I play'd at <HI>Blind-man's Buff,</HI> it hapt</L>
<L>About my Eyes the <HI>Towel thick</HI> was wrapt,</L>
<L>I miss'd the Swain, and seiz'd on Blouzalind,</L>
<L>True speaks that antient Proverb, "Love is Blind."</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus also another puerile Sport:
<Q><L>As at <HI>Hot Cockles</HI> once I laid me down,</L>
<L>And felt the weighty Hand of many a Clown;</L>
<L>Buxoma gave a gentle Tap and I</L>
<L>Quick rose, and read soft Mischief in her Eye.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus also of the <HI>Meritot,</HI> vulgò apud puerulos nostrates, <HI>Shuggy-Shew;</HI> in the South, a <HI>Swing:</HI>
<Q><L>On <HI>two near</HI> Elms the <HI>slacken'd Cord</HI> I <HI>hung,</HI></L>
<L>Now <HI>high,</HI> now <HI>low,</HI> my Blouzalinda swung, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Meritot,</HI> in Chaucer, a Sport used by Children, by swinging themselves in Bell-ropes, or such-like, till they are giddy. In Latin it is called <HI>Oscillum,</HI> and is thus described by an old Writer: Oscillum est
<PB N="407" REF="428"/>
genus ludi, scilicet cum sunis dependitur de trabe, in quo Pueri et Puellae sedentes impelluntur huc et illuc. Speght's Gloss. to Chaucer.</P>
<P>I find the following elegant Description of <HI>Duck</HI> and <HI>Drake</HI> in an antient Church Writer: — The Antiquity of this puerile Sport will appear by the subsequent Extract from Minucius Felix: "Pueros videmus certatim gestientes, testarum in mare jacu∣lationibus ludere. Is lusus est <HI>testam teretem,</HI> jactatione fluctuum <HI>levigatam,</HI> legere de litore: eam testam plano situ digitis comprehensam, inclinem ipsum, atque humilem, quantum potest, super undas in∣rotare: ut illud jaculum vel dorsum maris raderet, vel enataret, dum leni impetu labitur; vel, summis fluctibus tonsis, emicaret, emergeret, dum assiduo sal∣tu sublevatur. Is se in pueris victorem ferebat cujus testa et procurreret <HI>longius</HI> et <HI>frequentius</HI> exsiliret." P. 6.</P>
<P>Gay describes another well-known Kind of Sport thus:
<Q><L><HI>Across</HI> the fallen Oak the <HI>Plank</HI> I <HI>laid,</HI></L>
<L>And myself pois'd against the tott'ring Maid;</L>
<L>High leap'd the Plank; adown Buxoma fell, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>The following beautiful Sketches of other puerile Diversions, are taken from Mr. Grey's Ode on a distant Prospect of Eton College:
<Q><L>Say, Father Thames, for thou hast seen</L>
<L>Full many a sprightly Race,</L>
<L>Disporting on thy Margent green,</L>
<L>The Paths of Pleasure trace,</L>
<L>Who foremost now delight to <HI>cleave</HI></L>
<L>With <HI>pliant Arm</HI> thy <HI>glassy Wave?</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>captive Linnet</HI> which enthrall?</L>
<L>What idle Progeny succeed,</L>
<L>To chace the <HI>rolling Circle</HI>'s Speed,</L>
<L>Or <HI>urge</HI> the <HI>flying Ball?</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="429"/>To have a <HI>Month's Mind,</HI> implying a longing Desire, is a figurative Expression, of which the Subsequent is the Origin:</P>
<P><HI>Minnyng Days,</HI> says Blount, (from the Saxon Gemynde, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Mind, q. Mynding Days) <HI>Bede Hist. lib.</HI> 4. <HI>ca.</HI> 30. <HI>Commemorationis Dies;</HI> Days which our Ancestors called their <HI>Monthe's Mind,</HI> their <HI>Year's Mind,</HI> and the like, being the Days whereon their Souls (after their Deaths) were had in special Remembrance, and some Office or Obse∣quies said for them; as <HI>Obits, Dirges,</HI> &amp;c. This Word is still retained in Lancashire; but elsewhere more commonly called Anniversary Days.</P>
<P>Add the following to the Observations on Chap. 16th, p. 195. <HI>Wassail-bowl:</HI> In the Antiquarian Re∣pertory, Vol. I. p. 218, is a <HI>Wood Cut</HI> of a large Oak Beam, the ancient Support of a Chimney-piece, on which is carved a <HI>large Bowl,</HI> with this Inscription on one Side—<HI>Wass heil.</HI></P>
<P>"The Figure, says the ingenious Remarker on it, is of the old <HI>Wassell-bowl,</HI> so much the Delight of our hardy Ancestors, who on the <HI>Vigil</HI> of <HI>the New Year,</HI> never failed to assemble round the glow∣ing Hearth with their chearful Neighbours, and then in the spicy Wassel-bowl (which testifies the Goodness of their Hearts) drowned every former Animosity, an Example worthy modern Imitation. <HI>Wassell</HI> was the Word, <HI>Wassell</HI> every Guest returned, as he took the circling Goblet from his Friend, whilst Song and civil Mirth brought in the infant Year."</P>
<P>The <HI>three blue Balls,</HI> as I find in the above∣named elegant Collection, prefixed to the Doors and Windows of Pawn-brokers Shops, by the Vulgar humourously enough said to indicate that
<PB N="409" REF="430"/>
it is <HI>two</HI> to <HI>one,</HI> that the Things pledged, are never redeemed, was in reality the <HI>Arms</HI> of a set of Merchants from Lombardy, who were the first that publicly lent Money on Pledges—They dwelt together in a Street from them named Lombard-street, in London—The Appellation of Lombard, was formerly all over Europe considered as syno∣nimous to that of <HI>"Usurer."</HI></P>
<P>The purple flowered Lady's Thistle, which grows in great plenty about the Ruins of Tin∣mouth Castle and Monastry, Northumberland, and of which, the Leaves are beautifully diversi∣fied with numerous white Spots like Drops of Milk; is vulgarly thought to have been originally mark∣ed by the falling of some Drops of the Virgin Mary's Milk on it—Whence I suppose its Name, Lady's (scil. our Lady's) Thistle: An ingenious little Invention of Popery, and which, no doubt, has been of Service to the Cause of Superstition.</P>
<P>To cry <HI>Coke,</HI> is in vulgar Language, synony∣mous with crying <HI>Peccavi</HI>—<Q><HI>Coke,</HI> says the Au∣thor of the Glossary to Douglas' Virgil, is the Sound which Cocks utter, especially when they are beaten, from which Sk. is of opinion, that they have their Name of <HI>Cock.</HI></Q> In Verb.</P>
<P><HI>Marry,</HI> a Term of Asseveration in common Use, was originally in Popish Times, a swearing by the Virgin Mary—q. d. <HI>by Mary.</HI> So also <HI>Mar∣row-bones</HI> for the Knees: I'll bring him down upon his Marrow-bones, q. d. I'll make him bend his Knees, as he does to the Virgin Mary.</P>
<P>There is a vulgar Custom in the North, called <HI>riding the Stang,</HI> when one in Derision is made to ride on a Pole, for his Neighbour's Wife's Fault:
<PB N="410" REF="431"/>
—This Word <HI>Stang,</HI> says Ray, is still used in some Colleges in the University of Cambridge, to <HI>stang</HI> Scholars in Christmass Time, being to cause them to ride on a Colt-staff or Pole, for missing of Chapel. It is derived from the Islandic <HI>Staung,</HI> hasta.</P>
<P>Add to the Conjecture on the Etymon of <HI>Waffs,</HI> P. 99, the following:—<HI>Wrach</HI> in the Glossary to Gawen Douglas' Virgil, signifies a <HI>Spirit</HI> or <HI>Ghost.</HI> pafian too A. Saxon is rendered <HI>stupere, horrere, fluctuare.</HI></P>
<P>N. B. I have carefully endeavoured to steer clear of Scripture Controversy in the preceding Observa∣tions.—The sacred Writings, given for very dif∣ferent Purposes, and to Nations whose Genius and Manners by no means resembled our own, cannot in my Opinion, with any Propriety, be ap∣plied to <HI>this Subject.</HI> If it be objected here that <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>Apparitions, Dreams,</HI> &amp;c. are mentioned in them—so, I add, are <HI>Miracles,</HI> yet we do not <HI>now</HI> make Pretensions to a Power of performing them.</P>
<P>The GREAT BEING, who presides over every <HI>Cause</HI> of Nature, can undoubtedly make all its <HI>Effects</HI> subservient to his Pleasure: In the silence of rational Adoration, I prostrate my <HI>Faith</HI> before the immensity of his <HI>Power,</HI> of which I believe infal∣lible <HI>Wisdom</HI> to have been the inseparable Conco∣mitant: I must therefore apply in this Place what <HI>Horace</HI> said upon another Occasion:
<Q><L><HI>Nec</HI> Deus intersit, <HI>nisi</HI> dignus <HI>Vindice</HI> nodus</L>
<L>Inciderit.</L></Q></P>
