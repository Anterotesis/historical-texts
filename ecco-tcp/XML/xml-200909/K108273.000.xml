<P>THE LAW OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE, OR <HI>Christian Submission to Personal Injuries:</HI></P>
<P>Wherein is shewn, that the several texts of scripture, which command the entire submission of <HI>servants</HI> or <HI>slaves</HI> to their <HI>masters,</HI> cannot authorize the latter <HI>to exact an involuntary servitude,</HI> nor, in the least degree, justify the claims of modern <HI>Slaveholders.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE LAW OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE, OR CHRISTIAN SUBMISSION to PERSONAL INJURIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE illegality of slavery among Christians is a point which I have long laboured to demonstrate, as being destructive of morality, and con∣sequently dangerous both to body and soul. There are nevertheless some par∣ticular Texts in the New Testament, which, in the opinion even of several well meaning and disinterested persons, seem to afford some proof of the tolera∣tion of slavery among the primitive Christians; and, from thence, they are
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>induced to conceive, <HI>that Christianity doth not oblige its professors to renounce the practice of slaveholding.</HI></P>
<P>A learned and reverend correspondent of mine seems to have adopted this no∣tion, and has signified his opinion near∣ly to the same effect, in a private letter to me on this subject, to which I have not yet ventured to send him a reply, though it is a considerable time since I received his letter; but, to say the truth, the question in which I had never before apprehended any difficulty, was render∣ed very serious and important, upon my hands, by my friend's declaration; and I thought myself bound to give it the strictest examination, because I conceiv∣ed (as I do still) that the honour of the Holy Scriptures, which of all other things, I have most at heart, was con∣cerned in the determination of the point in question; and yet I know, that my
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>friend is full as zealous for the honour of the Scriptures as myself, and much more learned in them, being very emi∣nent in that most essential branch of knowledge.</P>
<P>I believe also that he is perfectly dis∣interested, and of undoubted <HI>Christian benevolence.</HI> The objection has therefore acquired an accumulated weight from the authority and worth of the person who made it; and consequently, it de∣manded more circumspection and read∣ing, to answer it in any reasonable time, than my short broken intervals of leisure (the only time that I was then master of) would permit me to bestow upon it; and as so much time has already elapsed, the answer which I originally intended for my friend's private perusal, shall now be addressed to all well meaning persons in general, who may have had the same motives for admitting in any degree the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>legality of slavery; and that there are many such (even among those that are concerned in the practice of slavehold∣ing) the example of my disinterested friend's opinion, and common charity, oblige me to suppose. I shall therefore consider my friend's opinion as the com∣mon excuse of our American and West Indian brethren for tolerating slavery a∣among them.</P>
<Q><HI>I do not think</HI> (says he) <HI>that Chris∣tianity released slaves from the obligation they were under according to the custom and law of the Countries, where it was propagated.</HI></Q>
<P>This objection to my general doctrine <HI>is</HI> expressed in the most <HI>guarded</HI> terms; —so <HI>guarded,</HI> that it obliges me to ac∣knowledge, that the observation is, in some respects, strictly <HI>true.</HI> My pre∣sent attempt is not to confute, but
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>rather to demonstrate wherein this <HI>truth</HI> consists, which will afterwards enable me to point out such a due limitation of the doctrine, as will ren∣der it entirely consistent with the hypothesis, which I have so long labour∣ed to maintain, viz. <HI>the absolute illega∣lity of slavery among Christians,</HI></P>
<P>In conformity to my worthy friend's declaration I must first observe, that the disciples of Christ (whose <HI>Kingdom,</HI> he himself declared,—<Q><HI>is not of</HI> THIS WORLD.</Q> John xviii. 36.) had no <HI>express</HI> commission to alter <HI>the</HI> TEMPO∣RAL CONDITION OF MEN, but only to prepare them for a BETTER WORLD by the general doctrines of <HI>faith, hope, charity, peace and goodwill,</HI> (or univer∣sal love and benevolence to all man∣kind) <HI>submission to injuries, dependence up∣on God,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which (though <HI>general</HI> doctrines) are amply and suffi∣ciently
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>efficacious indeed, for the <HI>par∣ticular</HI> reformation of ALL CONDITIONS OF MEN, when <HI>sincerity</HI> is not want∣ing in the application of them; but the principal intention of the whole sys∣tem is evidently to draw men from the the cares and anxieties of <HI>this present life,</HI> to a better hope in the <HI>life to come,</HI> which is Christ's proper kingdom: Christian servants therefore were of course instructed to be <HI>patient,</HI> to be <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>submissive</HI> to their masters, <Q><HI>not only to the good and gentle, but al∣so</HI> to the <HI>froward.</HI></Q> So that even <HI>ill usage</HI> does not justify <HI>perverseness</HI> of be∣haviour in christian slaves.</P>
<P>THE apostle <HI>Paul</HI> also frequently in∣sists upon the absolute necessity of an unfeigned obedience in the behaviour of christian servants to their masters. <Q><HI>Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</HI></Q> <Q><HI>Art thou
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>called being a servant? care not for it;</HI></Q> &amp;c. 1 Cor. vii. 21. and again, <Q><HI>Ser∣vants be obedient to them that are</HI> (your) <HI>masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart as unto Christ; not with eye service, as men pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the Will of God from the heart; with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whe∣ther he be bond or free,</HI>" Ephes. vi 5-8. Again,</Q> <Q><HI>Servants obey in all things</HI> (your) <HI>masters according to the flesh; not which eye service, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart fearing God: and whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.</HI> Colos. iii. 22, 23. The same apostle instructs <HI>Ti∣mothy</HI> to recommend obedience to ser∣vants, <HI>'Let as many servants</HI> (says the apostle) <HI>as are under the yoke, count
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>their own masters worthy of all honour, that</HI> THE NAME OF GOD AND HIS DOCTRINE BE NOT BLASPHEMED. <HI>And they that have believing masters, let them not despise</HI> (them) BECAUSE THEY ARE BRETHREN; BUT RATHER DO (them) SERVICE, BECAUSE THEY ARE FAITHFUL AND BELOVED PAR∣TAKERS OF THE BENEFIT. <HI>These things teach and exhort: If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to whole∣some words,</HI> (even) <HI>the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions, and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil-furmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godli∣ness. From such withdraw thyself. But godliness with contentment is great gain. for we brought nothing into</HI> (this) <HI>world,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.'</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 1 to 8.—And again he insists on the same doctrine, '(Exhort) <HI>servants,</HI> (says he) <HI>to be obedient unto their own masters,</HI> (and) <HI>to please</HI> (them) <HI>well in all</HI> things, <HI>not answering again, not pur∣loining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may</HI> ADORN THE DOC∣TRINE OF GOD OUR SAVIOUR IN ALL THINGS.</Q> Titus ii. 9, 10.</P>
<P>THESE Texts are amply sufficient to prove the truth of my learned friend's assertion, so far as it relates to THE DUTY OF THE SLAVES THEMSELVES, but this <HI>absolute submission</HI> required of Christian servants, by no means implies the <HI>legality</HI> of slaveholding ON THE PART OF THEIR MASTERS, which <HI>he</HI> seems to apprehend.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>THE slave violates no precepts of the gospel by his abject condition, pro∣vided that the same is <HI>involuntary</HI> (for if he can be made free, he is expressly commanded by the apostle to <HI>use it ra∣ther</HI>
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Art thou called</HI> (being) <HI>a servant? care not for it;</HI> BUT IF THOU MAYEST BE MADE FREE, USE IT RA∣THER. <HI>For he that is called in the lord</HI> (being) <HI>a servant, is the lord's freeman, &amp;c.</HI> <Q><HI>ye are bought with a price,</HI> BE NOT YE THE SERVANTS OF MEN.</Q> 1 Cor. vii. 21-23.</NOTE>) but how the master who enfor∣ces <HI>that involuntary servitude,</HI> can be said to act consistently with the Christian profession, is a question of a very dif∣ferent nature, which I propose to ex∣amine with all possible care and impar∣tiality, being no otherwise interested in it, than as a Christian who esteems both masters and slaves as brethren, and con∣sequently, while he pities the unhappy <HI>temporal condition</HI> of the latter, is ex∣tremely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nxious for the <HI>eternal welfare</HI> of the former.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>I HAVE already admitted, that CHRIS∣TIANITY DOTH NOT RELEASE SLAVES, <Q><HI>from the obligation they were under ac∣cording to the custom and law of the countries where it was propagated,</HI></Q> agreeable to my learned friend's asser∣tion, in favour of which I have pro∣duced a variety of texts: but as <Q><HI>the reason of the law,</HI></Q> (according to a maxim of the <HI>English</HI> law) <Q><HI>is the life of the law,</HI></Q> we cannot with justice draw any conclusion from thence, in fa∣vour of the master's claim, till we have examined the principles, on which the doctrine <HI>of submission,</HI> in these several texts, is founded; and we shall find, up∣on a general view of the whole, that the principal reason of enforcing the doctrine was not so much because the persons to whom it was addressed, <HI>were slaves,</HI> as because they <HI>were Chris∣tians,</HI> and were to overcome EVIL
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>with GOOD, to the GLORY OF GOD <HI>and</HI> RELIGION.</P>
<P>THESE principles are clearly <HI>expressed</HI> in several of these very texts, and <HI>implied</HI> in all of them, viz. '<HI>That the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</HI>' (1 Tim. vi. 1.) and again, <Q><HI>that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savi∣our</HI> IN ALL THINGS.</Q> (Titus ii. 10.) So that a zeal for the GLORY OF GOD, and of HIS RELIGION (the principles of the first great commandment) is the appa∣rent ground and sole purpose of the Christian <HI>slave's</HI> SUBMISSION, which was therefore to be <Q>WITH SINGLE∣NESS OF HEART AS UNTO CHRIST.</Q> <Q><HI>not with eye service,</HI> AS MEN PLEASERS, <HI>but as</HI> THE SERVANTS OF CHRIST, <HI>doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing service,</HI> AS TO THE LORD, <HI>and</HI> NOT TO MEN: <HI>knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall</HI> HE RECEIVE OF THE
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>LORD, <HI>whether he</HI> BE BOND OR FREE.</Q> Ephes. vi. 5-8. And again, the same apostle charges the servants among the Colossians, to obey <Q><HI>not</HI> AS MEN PLEA∣SERS, <HI>but in singleness of heart,</HI> FEAR∣ING GOD: <HI>and whatsoever they do, to do it heartil, as</HI> TO THE LORD, <HI>and</HI> NOT UNTO MEN.</Q> Coloss. iii. 2.</P>
<P>THUS it is plain that the service was to be performed 'as TO THE LORD,' and 'NOT TO MEN,' and therefore it cannot be construed as an acknowledge∣ment of any <HI>right,</HI> or <HI>property</HI> really vested <HI>in the master.</HI> This will clearly appear upon a closer examination of some of these texts. In the first, for instance, though the apostle <HI>Peter</HI> enforces the necessity of the ser∣vants <HI>submission</HI> to their masters, in the strongest manner, commanding them to be subject <Q><HI>not only to the good and gentle, but</HI> ALSO TO THE FROWARD,</Q> &amp;c. (1. Pet. ii. 18.)
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>yet he adds in the very next verse,—<Q><HI>for this is thank worthy, if a man,</HI> FOR CONSCIENCE TOWARDS GOD, <HI>endure grief,</HI> SUFFERING <HI>wrongfully,</HI></Q>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, so that, it is manifest, the apos∣tle did not mean to <HI>justify</HI> the claim of the masters, because he enjoin∣ed the same submission to the ser∣vants that suffered <HI>wrongfully,</HI> as to those who had good and gentle masters: and it would be highly injurious to the <HI>gospel of peace,</HI> to suppose it capable of authorizing <HI>wrongful sufferings,</HI> or of establishing a <HI>right</HI> or power in any rank of men whatever, to oppress others <HI>unjustly,</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>! And though the apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> also, so strongly exhorts servants to sub∣mit to their masters, and <Q><HI>to abide in the same calling wherein they were call∣ed,</HI></Q> and '<HI>not to care for it.</HI>' (1 Corin∣thians, vii. 20, 21.) Yet at the same time he clearly instructs them, that it is their duty to prefer a state of <HI>freedom</HI> whenever they can fairly and honestly
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>obtain it; <Q><HI>but if thou mayest be made free</HI> (says he) USE IT RATHER.</Q> (v.21.) And the reason, which he assigns for this command, is as plainly delivered, viz. <HI>the equality of servants with their masters in the fight of the Almighty,</HI> <Q><HI>For he that is called in the Lord,</HI> (being) <HI>a SER∣VANT</HI> (says he) <HI>is the Lord's FREE∣MAN:</HI> LIKEWISE, <HI>also he that is call∣ed</HI> (being) FREE, <HI>is Christ's</HI> SERVANT.</Q> (verse 22.) <HI>Christ</HI> having purchased all men to be his <HI>peculiar servants,</HI> or ra∣ther <HI>freemen.</HI> <Q><HI>Ye are bought with a price</HI> says the apostle, in the 23d verse.) BE NOT YE THE SERVANTS OF MEN,</Q> which plainly implies, that it is incon∣sistent with the dignity of a Christian, who is the <HI>servant</HI> or <HI>freeman of</HI> GOD, to be held in an <HI>unlimited</HI> subjection, as the bond <HI>servant</HI> or <HI>slave of a</HI> MAN; and, consequently, that a toleration of slavery, in places where Christianity is established by law, is intirely illegal;
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>for tho' THE SLAVE commits no crime by submitting to the <HI>involuntary service,</HI> (which has been already demonstrated,) yet the CHRISTIAN MASTER is guilty of a sort of sacriledge, by appropria∣ting to himself, as an <HI>absolute property,</HI> that body, which <HI>peculiarly belongs to God by an inestimable purchase!</HI> For if God said of the Jews, even under the old law, (Levit. xxv. 52.) <Q>THEY ARE MY SERVANTS, <HI>which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt;</HI> THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN.</Q>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">My learned friend, (mentioned in the beginning of this Tract) has remarked that <Q><HI>tho' God expressed himself concerning the Jews under the law in this manner.</HI> <Q>THEY ARE MY SERVANTS, WHICH I BROUGHT FORTH OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT, THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN.</Q> &amp;c. yet <HI>This did not signify</HI> (says he) <HI>that they were not to be slaves at all. They might be slaves for seven years, as is well known, notwithstanding they were God's redeemed ser∣vants. Nay, they might remain slaves 'till the jubilee,</HI> WITH THEIR OWN CONSENT, <HI>at the expiration of that short term of involuntary servitude. These words indeed contained a declaration that none of the Israelites were to be slaves for ever like the Heathen. But what a slip∣pery proof,</HI> (says he) <HI>of this exemption with regard to Christians? How dangerous</HI> (continued he,) <HI>is it to build doctrines upon such parallels and comparisons!</HI></Q> But my worthy friend seems to forget that the kind of sla∣very which I oppose, is not that <HI>limited temporary servi∣tude,</HI> which he describes <HI>as consistent with the law,</HI> for that differs very little from the condition of <HI>hired ser∣vants,</HI> in which light, the Hebrew masters were <HI>bound by the law,</HI> to look upon their brethren, even though bought with their money as bond servants or slaves, <Q><HI>If thy brother</HI> (that dwelleth) <HI>by thee be waxen poor,</HI> and BE SOLD <HI>unto thee;</HI> THOU SHATL NOT COMPEL HIM TO SERVE AS A BOND SERVANT: (but) AS AN HIRED SERVANT AND AS A SOJOURNER, <HI>he shall be with thee,</HI> and <HI>shall serve thee unto the year of</HI> Jubile. <HI>And then shall he depart from thee,</HI> (both) <HI>he and his children with him,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For they are my servants,</HI> (said the Almighty) THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BOND-MEN. THOU SHALT NOT RULE OVER HIM WITH RI∣GOUR, <HI>but shalt fear thy God.</HI></Q> Levit. xxv. 39, 43. Here is the very <HI>text,</HI> (with it's <HI>context</HI>) which I had quoted, to shew the <HI>illegality</HI> of holding a <HI>brother</HI> Is∣raelite in absolute slavery, and as I have elsewere fully demonstrated that men of all nations are to be considered as <HI>brethren</HI> under the gospel dispen∣sation, so my learned friend surely does great injustice to the argument, when he calls it <Q><HI>a slip∣pery proof</HI> of <HI>this exemption with regard to Chris∣tians,</HI></Q> and asserts that the text in question <HI>does not sig∣nify that they</HI> (the Israelites) <HI>were not to be slaves at all!</HI> It clearly <HI>signifies</HI> however, that whatsoever <HI>right</HI> a master might have acquired (even by an absolute <HI>pur∣chase</HI>) over his Hebrew brother, yet that he was still required to treat him as an <HI>hired servant,</HI> and to dis∣charge <HI>him</HI> and <HI>his</HI> at a <HI>limited time:</HI> and when we com∣pare it with the parallel text in Deuterenomy, (xv, 12, 14.) we find the master is there strictly enjoined to reward the Bond-man LIBERALLY for his past services, viz. <Q><HI>And when thou sendest him out free from thee,</HI> THOU SHALT FURNISH HIM LIBERALLY <HI>out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy wine press,</HI></Q> &amp;c. Surely when the true nature of such <HI>limited servitude</HI> is duly considered, it affords but '<HI>a slippery</HI> proof,' (if I may use my friend's expression) <Q>that <HI>they were to be slaves at all,</HI></Q> at least, '<HI>at all,</HI>' in the sense con∣tended for by our American and West India slave∣holders (which is the only matter in dispute at pre∣sent) especially as the condition of a <HI>hired servant</HI> is expressly mentioned, as the rank in which such Bond∣men were to be esteemed. And therefore I trust I may fairly retort the observation of my learned friend,— '<HI>How dangerous is it to build doctrines,</HI>' (that is in favour of absolute slavery) <Q><HI>upon such parallels and comparisons!</HI></Q></NOTE> How much
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>more ought Christians to esteem their <HI>brethren,</HI> as <HI>the peculiar servants of</HI> GOD on account of their being <HI>freed</HI> from the more <HI>severe bondage</HI> of our spiritual ene∣my,
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>(of which the <HI>Egyptian bondage</HI> was only a type) by the inestimable price of Christ's blood! and, surely, we may therefore say, <Q><HI>they</HI> are GOD'S SER∣VANTS,</Q> whom Christ hath redeemed with his own blood, as much as the Jews of old who were on that account expresly <HI>enfranchised</HI> from worldly bond∣age, <Q>THEY ARE MY SERVANTS, THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN;</Q> for this application of the text is entirely to the same effect as the apostle's expression to the Co∣rinthians,—<Q><HI>Ye are bought with a price,</HI> BE NOT YE THE SER∣VANTS OF MEN.</Q> (1. Cor. vii. 23.)
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>Dr. <HI>Whithy,</HI> indeed supposes that the words '<HI>ye are bought with a price,</HI>' re∣fer only to a pecuniary price given by the primitive Christians, <HI>to buy their brethren out of slavery.</HI>' But the autho∣rity of <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> and <HI>Tertullian,</HI> which he cites, by no means proves his interpretation of the text, tho' it may sufficiently prove the primitive practice of <HI>redeeming slaves;</HI> which al∣so furnishes a new argument against the legality of <HI>slavery among Christians,</HI> so
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>far as the example of the <HI>primitive Christians</HI> is concerned. But scripture is best interpreted by scripture, and therefore the most certain means of as∣certaining the true meaning of the words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <Q><HI>ye are bought with a price,</HI></Q> is to have recourse to the very same expression (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the words being only transposed) in the preceding chapter, 20th verse, where we shall find that it can refer to nothing less than the inestimable price of Christ's redemption, <Q><HI>What know ye not</HI> (says the apostle) <HI>that your</HI> BODY <HI>is the</HI> TEM∣PLE
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>OF THE HOLY GHOST, (which is) <HI>in you, which you have of God, and</HI> YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN? FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE: <HI>therefore glo∣rify God</HI> IN YOUR BODY, <HI>and in your spirit,</HI> WHICH ARE GOD's,</Q> (1 Cor. vi. 19, 20.) and, consequently, it is the duty of a <HI>Christian legislature</HI> to vindicate THE LORD'S FREEMEN <HI>from</HI> SLAVERY, as all mankind are included in the same <HI>inestimable purchase,</HI> for it is not only their <HI>souls</HI> but even their <HI>bodies, which are God's;</HI>' and therefore it is an abomi∣nable <HI>sacriledge,</HI> that those <HI>bodies</HI> which are capable of being the <Q><HI>temple of the Holy Ghost,</HI></Q> should be esteemed the mere <HI>chattels</HI> and private property of mercenary planters and merchants, merely for the sake of a little worldly gain!</P>
<P>BUT slaveholders may perhaps al∣ledge that <HI>believing masters</HI> are mention∣ed
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>as '<HI>faithful and beloved,</HI>' in one of the texts, which I have cited, and are also expressly accounted as '<HI>partakers of the benefit,</HI>' (see 1 Timothy, vi. 2.) so that, from thence, they may perhaps infer, that <HI>slavekeeping</HI> is not inconsis∣tent with their Christian profession.</P>
<P>BUT these expressions are included in that part of the apostles charge to <HI>Timothy,</HI> which relates merely to the instruction of servants, so that there is no room to suppose, that any reference was intended to the practice of the mas∣ters by way of <HI>justification.</HI> The mean∣ing therefore can amount to no more than this, viz. that, as it is the duty of servants to '<HI>count their own masters,</HI>' (even those that are <HI>unbelievers</HI>) '<HI>wor|'thy of</HI> ALL HONOUR
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Apparently meaning, '<HI>all honour,</HI>' which is not in∣consistent with their duty to God.</NOTE>, THAT THE NAME OF GOD AND HIS DOCTRINE
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>'BE NOT BLASPHEMED,' so the same reason obliges them, more especially, to count their <HI>believing</HI> masters <Q><HI>worthy</HI> of <HI>all</HI> (lawful) <HI>honour,</HI></Q> because of their <HI>Christian profession,</HI> which renders them <HI>accepted of God.</HI> For common charity obliges us, as Christians, to sup∣pose that all men, who believe and hold the same profession as ourselves, are '<HI>faithful and beloved,</HI>' as well as <Q><HI>par∣takers of the benefit</HI></Q> of Christ's redemp∣tion,
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Christ's redemption does not seem to be '<HI>the bene∣fit</HI>' spoken of in the text, though I have admitted this implication to avoid controversy. Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> sup∣poses that <HI>the benefit of the service</HI> is meant, and he con∣strues the sentence accordingly, <Q><HI>because they who par∣takes ;of the</HI> BENEFIT OF THE SERVICE, <HI>are faithful and beloved.</HI></Q> And Dr. <HI>George Benson,</HI> also, renders it in the same sense, viz. <Q><HI>because they who partake of</HI> THE BENEFIT OF THEIR SERVICE, <HI>are Christians, and be∣loved of God.</HI></Q> And then he adds in a note, <Q><HI>This</HI> (says he) <HI>I take to have been spoken of</HI> THE MASTERS, who <HI>received the</HI> BENEFIT OF THE SERVICE <HI>of their slaves. So the author of the Syriae version seems to have understood the words.</HI> The MS. <HI>called Pet.</HI> 2. read (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>labor) and Pet.</HI> 3. <HI>and Borner, read <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> piety,</HI></Q> for which he refers us to <HI>Kuster's</HI> edition of Dr. <HI>Mill,</HI>—<Q><HI>And finally</HI> (says he) <HI>I would observe that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] is never used, throughout the New Testament, for the pri∣vilege of having the gospel, or the unspeakable</HI> BENEFIT <HI>of eternal life.</HI></Q></NOTE> because <HI>Belief</HI> is the true means
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>of leading and disposing men to acquire such happiness; and though many other necessary Christian qualities may seem wanting in our <HI>believing brethren,</HI> yet we must not presume to condemn them; God alone being their <HI>Judge:</HI> and, for this reason also, <HI>Christian ser∣vants</HI> must not condemn and despise their <HI>believing masters,</HI> (though they know themselves <HI>equalin dignity as brethren,</HI> and that it is, consequently, their masters <HI>duty</HI> to treat them <HI>as brethren,)</HI> but must render them service the more willingly on this <HI>account,</HI> having <HI>brotherly love</HI> as an additional motive to <HI>faithful ser∣vice.</HI> It is manifest, therefore, that this text was intended to regulate the
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>conduct of <HI>Christian servants,</HI> and not that of <HI>Christian masters;</HI> for, with re∣gard to the former, the doctrine is per∣fectly consistent with the other texts, that I have quoted; which is not the case when it is applied to justify the mere temporal claims of <HI>masters</HI> or <HI>slaveholders,</HI> because there are many clear and incontrovertible precepts throughout the New Testament for re∣gulating the conduct of <HI>Christian mas∣ters,</HI> which exclude the <HI>justification</HI> of any <HI>such claims</HI> among Christians, and consequently forbid any application or interpretation of these particular texts in favour of them: and besides we must always remember, that it is not lawful to maintain an hypothesis upon the testimony <HI>of any one single text of doubtful interpretation,</HI> especially when the same does not clearly correspond with the rest of the scriptures, and can∣not bear the test <HI>'of the royal law,'</HI> of
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>which more shall be said in my tract 'on <HI>the Law of Liberty.</HI>'</P>
<P>I mention this text of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> as one of <HI>'doubtful interpretation,'</HI> because commentators are divided concerning the application of the very words on which the imaginary justification of the slaveholder is supposed to be founded! Many learned men (and Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> among the rest) have construed the words — '<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (1 Tim. vi. 2,)
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">These words are translated by Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> as follows, — <Q><HI>because they who help to do good, are faithful and beloved,</HI></Q> and he uses several arguments to shew that these epithets refer <HI>to the servants,</HI> rather than <HI>to the masters.</HI></NOTE> in a very different manner from the common version, and applied them <HI>to the servants,</HI> which entirely destroys the presumption in favour of the slave∣holder.</P>
<P>Nevertheless I have contented myself with the common rendering, being con∣vinced
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>that no conclusions can fairly be drawn from this text in favour of Sla∣very, even when the epithets <Q><HI>faith∣ful and beloved,</HI></Q> &amp;c. are applied <HI>to the Masters;</HI> because the signification of them must necessarily be restrained within the bounds of <HI>gospel doctrine;</HI> and, therefore, we cannot conceive that the apostle intended, by the applica∣tion of these epithets, to justify any practices which are inconsistent with <HI>the benevolence</HI> enjoined in other parts of the New Testament; for this would be liable to produce a contrary effect from that which the apostle expressly intended by his injunction, viz. that <HI>"the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed."</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears, I hope, that the principles, on which the doctrine of the <HI>servants submission</HI> is founded, are clear∣ly expressed; so that <HI>Slaveholders</HI> can have no right to avail themselves of any
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>of these texts to <HI>enforce an</HI> ABSOLUTE SUBMISSION; for, though these several texts clearly justify <HI>the Slave,</HI> yet they cannot justify the Master, unless he can shew that the same <HI>principles, (or reason of the Law,)</HI> on which they are founded, hold good also on <HI>his</HI> side of the ques∣tion.
<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>(1) This is apparently the case in the other <Q><HI>dif∣ferent relations of life, mentioned in these contexts;</HI></Q> as in <HI>the relation</HI> between <HI>husbands</HI> and <HI>their wives, parents</HI> and <HI>their children,</HI> but is far otherwise in the <HI>relation</HI> be∣tween <HI>masters and their servants,</HI> (unless free <HI>hired ser∣vants</HI> are to be understood,) and therefore the objecti∣on of my learned friend, drawn from thence, cannot be just. He says, <Q><HI>If the connexion of persons in the two former respects be lawful, so that husbands had a right to the subjection of their wives, and wives a right to the love of their husbands; parents had a right to the honour and obedience of their children, and chil∣dren a right to maintenance and instruction by their pa∣rents: unnatural</HI> (says he) <HI>is it to imagine the connection between Masters and Slaves was looked upon by him as absolutely unlawful, so that the former had no right to rule the latter! Indeed, he very clearly signifies</HI> (says he) <HI>that the right of dominion remained, when be opposes</HI> DOING WRONG TO OBEYING IN ALL THINGS THEIR MASTERS ACCORDING TO THE FLESH, &amp;c. <HI>as he does. Coloss.</HI> iii. 25.</Q> <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q></P>
<P>But my learned friend has entirely misunderstood the purport and intention of my arguments on these several texts relating to <HI>obedience</HI> and <HI>submission.</HI> I have not attempted to prove, <HI>by these particular expressions of the apostle,</HI> that <Q><HI>the connexion between Masters and Slaves was looked upon by him as absolutely unlawful,</HI> so that the former had <HI>no right to rule the latter;</HI></Q> for this I have demonstrated, I trust, by OTHER AUTHORI∣TIES <HI>of Scripture</HI> equally authentic, and much less liable to be misunderstood. My attempt to explain the texts in question extends no farther than to shew that they do not really <HI>justify the uncharitable claims of the modern Slaveholders,</HI> though they are frequently cited for that purpose.</P>
<P>An attempt to shew <HI>that any particular doctrine is</HI> NOT NECESSARILY IMPLIED <HI>in a certain text or texts of Scrip∣ture,</HI> is a very different thing from an attempt to PROVE or AUTHENTICATE AN OPPOSITE DOCTRINE <HI>by the same text of Scripture!</HI> For instance, when my learned friend asserts, as above, that the apostle to the Colos∣sians, iii. 25. <Q><HI>very clearly signifies that the right of do∣minion remained, when he opposes</HI> DOING WRONG to OBEYING <HI>in all things their Masters,</HI></Q> &amp;c. I do not pretend to build an <HI>opposite doctrine upon the very same words,</HI> but shall only endeavour to shew that this sup∣posed <HI>"right of dominion"</HI> is not necessarily <HI>implied</HI> in the text which my friend has cited in support of it.</P>
<P>The servants are indeed expressly and plainly ex∣horted to <HI>obedience</HI> and <HI>submission,</HI> as well in this as in all the other texts before recited, so that a contrary behaviour in them might certainly be esteemed a <Q><HI>do∣ing wrong</HI></Q> on their part yet this by no means implies <HI>"a right of dominion"</HI> vested in the Master; for that would prove too much; because the like sub∣mission is elsewhere equally enjoined to those who are expressly said to <Q><HI>endure grief,</HI> SUFFERING WRONG∣FULLY,</Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,) and we cannot suppose (as I have before observed) that the <HI>submission enjoined</HI> implies a <HI>right</HI> in the Master to exercise such a <HI>dominion</HI> as that of <HI>oppressing others</HI> UNJUSTLY, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; for that could not possibly tend to promote the declared purposes of the apostle's exhortations, viz. <HI>"that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed,"</HI> (1 Tim. vi.) and again, <Q><HI>that they may adorn the doctrine of God in all</HI> THINGS,</Q> (Titus ii. 9.) These purposes, how∣ever, are fully answered in the advice given by the same apostle to all the other <HI>different relations of life</HI> men∣tioned by my worthy friend. WIVES may <Q><HI>adorn the doctrine of God</HI></Q> by SUBMISSION to their <Q><HI>own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</HI></Q> (See Coloss. iii. 18.) And HUSBANDS, by <HI>love</HI> to their <HI>wives:</HI> for they are expressly charged in the following verse <Q><HI>not to be bitter against them,</HI></Q> that is, they must, by <HI>love</HI> and <HI>sincere affection,</HI> moderate and soften that supreme authority with which <HI>husbands</HI> are entrusted, (by the laws of God and man,) that they may <HI>rule</HI> rather by the gentle influence of an inviolable <HI>love</HI> and <HI>fidelity,</HI> as so good an example will seldom fail to produce <HI>due respect,</HI> and will certainly <HI>"adorn the doctrine"</HI> or profession of the Christian. CHILDREN <Q><HI>may adorn the doctrine of God</HI></Q> by OBEDIENCE <HI>to their</HI> <Q><HI>parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing</HI> (says the text) <HI>unto the Lord.</HI></Q> (v. 20.) And again, the reciprocal duty of FATHERS is plainly pointed out to be a prudent modera∣tion of that <HI>paternal</HI> authority with which they are en∣trusted, for they are carefully warned against an arbi∣trary severity, <Q><HI>Provoke not</HI> (says the apostle) <HI>your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</HI></Q> SERVANTS are in the very next verse (v. 22.) commanded to <Q><HI>obey in all things their Masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as</HI> MEN-PLEASERS, <HI>but in singleness of heart,</HI> FEARING GOD:</Q> so that the SUBMISSION of the servants was also to <HI>adorn the "doctrine of God,"</HI> it being manifestly enjoined only for <HI>God's sake,</HI> and not on account of any supposed "RIGHT OF DOMINION" invested in the <HI>Masters,</HI> which the following verses (v. 23, and 24.) when <HI>applied to</HI> THE SERVANTS, sufficiently demonstrate,—<Q>And <HI>whatsoever ye do, do it heartily as to the Lord, and</HI> NOT UNTO MEN: <HI>knowing, that of</HI> THE LORD <HI>ye shall receive</HI> THE REWARD OF THE INHE∣RITANCE: <HI>for</HI> YE SERVE THE LORD CHRIST.</Q> And to the same eternal and unerring Dispenser of <HI>Re∣wards</HI> (and not to <HI>temporal Masters</HI>) is attributed the power of punishing the <HI>"doing wrong,"</HI> mentioned in the very next verse; which, according to my learned friend's notion, is <HI>opposed</HI> to <HI>obeying in all things the Masters;</HI>—<Q><HI>he that</HI> DOETH WRONG (says the text) <HI>shall receive for</HI> THE WRONG <HI>which he hath done: and</HI> THERE IS NO RESPECT OF PERSONS.</Q> (v. 25.)</P>
<P>Such strict <HI>impartiality</HI> in the administration of justice cannot always be attributed, with certainty, even to the best-regulated <HI>human</HI> tribunal, and much less is it applicable to the decisions of uncontrouled <HI>will</HI> and <HI>pleasure,</HI> in punishing <HI>"wrong doing,"</HI> under the ab∣solute <HI>dominion</HI> of Slaveholders! No earthly <HI>dominion</HI> whatever is conducted with such an equal distribution of <HI>rewards</HI> and <HI>punishments,</HI> as that it may always with truth be said, <HI>"there is no respect of persons,"</HI> for this is the proper characteristic of the <HI>judgements and do∣minion</HI> of GOD and CHRIST alone. <Q><HI>For</HI> THE LORD <HI>is</HI> JUDGE, <HI>and with him is</HI> NO RESPECT OF PERSONS.</Q> Ecclesiasticus xxxv. 12. "<HI>For there is</HI> NO RESPECT OF PERSONS <HI>with</HI> GOD." Rom. ii. 11. And, there∣fore, we may fairly conclude that the punishment, not only of SLAVES, but that also of MASTERS, that <HI>"do wrong,"</HI> is to be understood in the text which my friend has cited to support his notion of a <Q><HI>right of dominion</HI></Q> vested in the <HI>Masters;</HI> so that the said supposed <HI>right</HI> has, indeed, but a very <HI>"slippery"</HI> foundation! Agreeable to my last remark on this text, (Coloss. iii. 24.) the learned Dr. Whitby has com∣mented upon it, as if he thought it exactly parallel to another declaration of the same apostle, (viz. Ephes. vi. 8 and 9.) wherein not only both <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> are unquestionably included, but also the <HI>domi∣nion,</HI> or <HI>judgement,</HI> in <HI>which</HI> <Q>THERE IS NO RESPECT OF PERSONS,</Q> is expressly attributed to our <Q>MAS∣TER IN HEAVEN.</Q> — <Q><HI>Christ, in judging men at the last day,</HI> (says the Doctor,) <HI>will have</HI> NO RESPECT <HI>to the quality or external condition of any man's person; but,</HI> WHETHER HE BE BOND OR FREE, <HI>he shall receive recompence</HI> FOR THE GOOD THAT HE HATH DONE, <HI>in obedience to him; whether he be</HI> MASTER <HI>or</HI> SERVANT, <HI>he shall be punished for</HI> THE WRONG THAT HE DOTH <HI>in those relations.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If all these circumstances be duly considered, it will manifestly appear, I trust, that the Masters sup∣posed <HI>"right of dominion"</HI> (which, certainly, is <HI>not</HI> EXPRESSED in the text) cannot even be <HI>implied</HI> in these contexts, nor in any of the parallel passages al∣ready recited! Can the Master <HI>adorn the</HI> <Q><HI>doctrine of God our Saviour,</HI></Q> (as in the other indissoluble re∣lations of life,) by continuing the unnatural <HI>connection</HI> of <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Slave,</HI> and by <HI>exacting</HI> involuntary labour from his <HI>brethren, without wages</HI> or <HI>reward,</HI> agreeable to my friend's notions of the supposed implied <Q><HI>right of dominion?</HI></Q> The reciprocal duty of the Master is mentioned, indeed, in the next chapter, (Col. iv. 1.) but it is of such a nature as must necessarily lead Chris∣tian Masters to abhor any such supposed <Q><HI>right of dominion</HI></Q> as that which is tolerated in the British colonies, and which my friend seems desirous to defend! The <HI>Masters</HI> are not directed by the apostle to claim as their own, by <HI>"right of dominion,"</HI> the <HI>labour</HI> of their servants WITHOUT WAGES, but, on the contrary, are expressly commanded to <Q>GIVE <HI>unto</HI> (their) <HI>ser∣vants that which is</HI> JUST <HI>and</HI> EQUAL;</Q> which com∣prehends (as I have fully shewn in the preceding tract) such a measure of <HI>generosity, recompence,</HI> and <HI>benevolence,</HI> on the part of <HI>the Master,</HI> as is totally inconsistent with the claims and views of modern <HI>Slaveholders!</HI> and, if put in practice, would necessarily effect the entire abolition of slavery!</P>
<P>The Masters are likewise carefully reminded, in the last mentioned text, that they <Q><HI>also have a Master in Heaven.</HI></Q> (Col. iv. 1.) — A <HI>Master,</HI> by whose example they are bound to regulate their conduct, so that this consideration alone is a sufficient antidote a∣gainst <HI>slavery;</HI> for the principal doctrine of <HI>that heaven∣ly Master</HI> was LOVE, which cannot subsist with the contrary <HI>exaction of involuntary servitude!</HI> <Q><HI>This is my commandment,</HI></Q> (said that glorious and gracious MASTER,) "<HI>That ye</HI> LOVE <HI>one another.</HI> AS <HI>I have</HI> LOVED <HI>you.</HI>" The nature of <HI>his love</HI> (which we are to imitate, that is, to LOVE <HI>as he hath</HI> LOVED <HI>us)</HI> is then immediately described as exceeding all bounds of comparison, "<HI>Greater</HI> LOVE" (said he) <Q><HI>hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his</HI> FRIENDS. <HI>Ye are my</HI> FRIENDS, <HI>if ye do whatsoever I command you.</HI> HENCEFORTH I CALL YOU NOT SERVANTS.</Q> Here is an express <HI>enfranchisement</HI> of <HI>his Servants</HI> for our example! The universal <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Master</HI> of all men delights in promoting <HI>the dignity of human nature;</HI> which cannot be said of the temporal <HI>Slaveholder,</HI> who enforces an imaginary <HI>"right of do∣minion,"</HI> by exacting an <HI>involuntary service,</HI> and that for no other purpose than for the sake of a little pe∣cuniary gain, by depriving the <HI>labourer of his hire;</HI> which savours of no other <HI>love</HI> but <HI>self-love;</HI> whereas, our disinterested Lord and Master hath even <HI>laid down his life</HI> through <HI>love</HI> and <HI>compassion</HI> to his SERVANTS, and hath <HI>declared us free,</HI> as before recited. — <Q><HI>Hence∣forth I call you not</HI> SERVANTS; <HI>for the Servant</HI></Q> (said he) <Q><HI>knoweth not what his Lord doeth; but I have called you</HI> FRIENDS; <HI>for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</HI></Q> (John xv. 12-15.) And, in the 17th verse, he again enforces his doctrine of LOVE: "<HI>These things I command you,</HI> (said he,) <HI>that ye</HI> LOVE <HI>one another.</HI>" The measure of this indispensible LOVE is expressly declared in the Scrip∣tures, <Q><HI>Thou shalt</HI> LOVE <HI>thy neighbour</HI> AS THYSELF. LOVE <HI>worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore</HI> LOVE (is) <HI>the fulfilling of the law.</HI></Q> (Rom. xiii. 9 and 10.)</P>
<P>Such LOVE, therefore, is clearly incompatible with the arbitrary claims of the Slaveholder, who can nei∣ther be <HI>said</HI> to LOVE <HI>his neighbour as himself,</HI> nor to cherish that LOVE <HI>which worketh no ill to his neighbour,</HI> whilst he strenuously contends for such <Q><HI>a right of dominion</HI></Q> as may enable him to exact, not only the <HI>involuntary</HI> service of his <HI>neighbours</HI> and <HI>brethren,</HI> con∣trary to the law of nature, but also to rob them of the <HI>fruits of their own labours,</HI> <Q>GIVING THEM NOT FOR THEIR WORK;</Q> against which practices a severe denunciation of WOE is expressly declared in the Scriptures; as I have fully demonstrated in my tract on <HI>"the Law of Retribution,"</HI> as well as in the prece∣ding tract: and, therefore, as it is necessary to con∣strue difficult or dubious passages of <HI>Scripture</HI> consist∣tently with the general tenour of <HI>Scripture</HI> evidence, it would be highly improper to admit this <HI>opposite, doc∣trine</HI> of a supposed "RIGHT OF DOMINION," espe∣cially as the same <HI>is not expressed</HI> in the text which my learned friend has cited for it, but is merely drawn forth by an imaginary <HI>implication!</HI></P></NOTE> Can the Slaveholders and
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>African traders alledge, for instance, that they shall <Q><HI>adorn the doctrine of
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>God our Saviour,</HI></Q> (Titus ii. 10.) by persisting in their unnatural pretensions
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>to an absolute <HI>property</HI> in their poor <HI>bre∣thren?</HI> or that they <Q><HI>do the will of
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>God from the heart,</HI></Q> (Ephesians vi. 5, &amp;c.) when they retain their <HI>neigh∣bour</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>in an involuntary unrewarded ser∣vitude for life? If they can do this, I
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>shall have reason to be silent. But if, on the contrary, it should evidently ap∣pear
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>that a <HI>very different behaviour</HI> is required of <HI>Christian Masters,</HI> <Q><HI>that
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed,</HI></Q> (1 Tim. vi. 1.) they must be obliged to allow that the <HI>"rea∣son, or life of the law"</HI> is against them; and, consequently, that none of these texts, relating to Christian servants, are capable of affording them the least ex∣cuse for their selfish pretensions. They will find also, upon a more careful ex∣amination of the Scriptures, that they themselves are as much bound by the gos∣pel to bear personal injuries with patience and humility, as their Slaves. Because the benevolent principles of the <HI>gospel of peace</HI> require all men, <HI>freemen as well as slaves,</HI> to return <HI>"good for evil."</HI> "<HI>Bless them that</HI> CURSE <HI>you,</HI>" (said our
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>Lord,) <Q><HI>and</HI> PRAY <HI>for them which</HI> DESPITEFULLY USE YOU.</Q> <HI>And unto</HI> <Q><HI>him that</HI> SMITETH <HI>thee on the one cheek, offer also the other; and him that</HI> TAKETH AWAY <HI>thy cloke, forbid not</HI> (to take thy) <HI>coat also,</HI></Q> &amp;c. Luke vi. 28, 29. But, though <HI>submis∣sion</HI> and <HI>placability</HI> are thus unquesti∣onably enjoined to the <HI>sufferers</HI> in all the cases above recited in the text, yet surely no reasonable man will pretend to alledge, from thence, that <HI>tyrants</HI> and <HI>oppressors</HI> have thereby obtained a legal <HI>right,</HI> under the gospel, to <HI>curse others,</HI> and use them <HI>despitefully;</HI> or that the unjust oppression of <HI>strikers and robbers</HI> is thereby authorized or justified! In the <HI>same light exactly</HI> must we view the <HI>Slave∣holders</HI> claim of <HI>private property in the persons of men,</HI> whenever an attempt is made to support it on the foundation of any such texts as I have quoted, wherein servants or slaves are exhorted to submit
<PB N="40" REF="39"/><HI>with passive obedience,</HI> &amp;c. to their Mas∣ters; because the <HI>right</HI> (as it is impro∣perly called) or pretension of the Mas∣ter may with the greatest propriety be compared to the pretended <HI>right</HI> or au∣thority of oppressing or robbing others, which is too often exercised by imperial tyrants and despotic princes, as well as by <HI>their brethren in iniquity</HI> of a lower class, viz. pirates, highwaymen, and extortioners of every degree! The gospel of peace cannot authorize the oppression of these lawless men, though it clearly enjoins patience, submission, and acqui∣escence, to the individuals that are en∣jured, whether freemen or slaves! The <HI>placability</HI> and <HI>absolute submission,</HI> com∣manded by the last-cited text, to Chris∣tians <HI>in general,</HI> are manifestly founded on the very same principles with that <HI>particular</HI> submission which the gospel requires of <HI>Christian slaves;</HI> and is far∣ther parallel to the latter, by being <HI>e∣qually
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>passive;</HI> so that the <HI>oppression</HI> of the <HI>Slaveholder</HI> can no more be justified by any text of the New Testament, that I am able to find, than the <HI>oppression</HI> of the <HI>striker</HI> and <HI>robber.</HI></P>
<P>Unhappily for the Christian world, the duties of <HI>patience, submission,</HI> and <HI>placability,</HI> enjoined by the gospel to <HI>per∣sons injured,</HI> are too commonly either misunderstood or rejected; though the <HI>temporal,</HI> as well as the <HI>eternal,</HI> happiness of mankind greatly depends upon a con∣scientious and proper observation of these duties: for even the most rigid obedi∣ence to the letter of the command would be far from being productive, either of the <HI>real evils</HI> to which the pernicious doctrine of <HI>a national passive obedience</HI> apparent∣ly tends, or of the <HI>imaginary inconve∣niences</HI> apprehended by the advocates for <HI>duelling,</HI> because the same benevo∣lent principles, (viz. universal love and
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>charity, founded on the great command∣ment, <Q>Thou shalt love thy neigh∣bour as thyself,</Q>) which oblige the true Christian, most <HI>disinterestedly,</HI> to forgive all injuries, and pass over every affront offered to his <HI>own person,</HI> will necessarily engage him, on the other hand, as <HI>disinterestedly,</HI> to oppose every degree of oppression and injustice, which affects his <HI>brethren and neighbours,</HI> when he has a fair opportunity of assisting them; and from hence arises the zeal of good men for <HI>just</HI> and <HI>equitable laws,</HI> as being the most effectual means of preserving the <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>happiness</HI> of the community, by curbing the insolence and violence of wicked men. We have an eminent example of this <HI>loyal zeal</HI> in the behaviour of the apostle Paul, who could not brook an infringement of <HI>the Roman liberty</HI> from any persons whatever in the administration of government, though he could endure <HI>personal injuries</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>from men unconnected therewith, and the persecutions of the multitude, with all the <HI>Christian patience</HI> and <HI>meekness</HI> which the gospel requires. The Scrip∣ture-history of this great apostle affords many proofs of his extraordinary hu∣mility and patience <HI>under sufferings,</HI> so that his spirited opposition to the illegal proceedings of magistrates cannot be at∣tributed to <HI>private resentment</HI> on his own account, but merely to his zeal for <HI>the public good,</HI> founded upon the great Christian principle of <Q><HI>loving his neigh∣bour as himself,</HI></Q> since the maintaining of <HI>good laws</HI> is, certainly, the most ef∣fectual means of promoting the welfare and happiness of society.

<PB N="46" REF="45"/>high priest,</HI> which would have been a notorious breach of the law, had there not been circumstances of justification sufficient to vindicate the severity of the Apostle's censure: these, however, were not urged by the apostle himself, who best knew how to behave towards those with whom he had to do. He readily allowed the principle (however) on which the censure of his accusers was founded, but he by no means retracted what he had so justly applied to the person of the unworthy magistrate <HI>who sat to judge him;</HI> neither did he even <HI>acknowledge</HI> him to be the <HI>high priest,</HI> though he was expressly questioned for a supposed misbehaviour to that digni∣tary! His answer was cautiously word∣ed.— He did not say, — <HI>I knew not that this person, whom I have censured, was the high priest,</HI> but, — <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q><HI>I knew not, brethren, that there is a high
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>priest.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">(5) The learned Hugh Broughton has construed the text as follows, — <Q><HI>I knewe not, brethren, that there was a high priest;</HI></Q> but the words, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, are more literally rendered above. CASTALIO reads it, — <Q><HI>Nesciebam, fratres, esse ponti∣ficem.</HI></Q>—And HEINSIUS,—<Q><HI>Summum esse sacerdotem ignorabam.</HI></Q></NOTE> Which answer, though on the first hearsay it seems to bear some affinity to an excuse or apology for what had past, yet, in reality, includes a still farther rebuke; for it plainly im∣plies that the <HI>high priest,</HI> in whose pre∣sence the apostle then stood, was (in some respect or other) deficient or blame∣able in his deportment as chief magi∣strate, either that he did not duly sup∣port the dignity of that sacred and distinguishing public character, so that he did not seem to be <HI>high priest,</HI> and of course could not be known and hon∣oured as such; or else that his behaviour had been so unjust and illegal that he did not deserve to be considered as a <HI>lawful magistrate,</HI> who had publicly demeaned
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>himself as <HI>a tyrant,</HI> by commanding a prisoner to be beaten, <HI>contrary to law,</HI> without hearing his defence! And, that this latter sense is most probable we may learn by the following circum∣stance, viz. that the apostle chose to de∣cline the dispute, and to wave the accu∣sation about <HI>reviling the high priest,</HI> by <HI>acknowledging</HI> the principle of law on which it was manifestly founded, viz. <HI>Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</HI> But, be pleased to observe, he neither <HI>acknowledged</HI> that he him∣self had broken the said precept by so severely censuring the unjust <HI>ruler,</HI> nor did he <HI>acknowledge</HI> the presence of <HI>a high priest</HI> in the person of Ananias; neither did he allow the by-standers time enough to criticise upon the true literal meaning of his reply, (whereby they would probably have been led to demand some express recantation of the <HI>personal</HI> censure which he had so amply
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>bestowed upon the high priest,) but he prudently changed the subject in debate from <HI>the</HI> PERSON <HI>of the high priest</HI> (who was a zealous overbearing SADDUCEE)
<NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">(6) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. But the younger ANANUS, who, as we have said, obtained the ponti∣ficate, was of a bold and daring disposition, and followed the sect of the SADDUCEES, who, with respect to judge∣ments, are more cruel than all the rest of the Jews, as we have already demonstrated. Therefore, Ananias being of this stamp, &amp;c.</NOTE> to an avowed <HI>censure of his whole sect,</HI> charging the SADDUCEES in particular with the unjust persecution, then before the assembly, and openly appealing to the opposite party, <HI>the Pharisees,</HI> in order to divide his united enemies: <Q><HI>I am a</HI> PHARISEE, (said he,) <HI>the son of a</HI> PHARISEE; <HI>of the hope and re∣surrection of the dead I</HI> AM CALLED IN QUESTION.</Q> Such a manifest reflection against the whole body of
<PB N="50" REF="49"/><HI>Sadducees</HI> cannot by any means favour the supposition of an intended apology, or recantation, in the preceding sentence, to soothe the enraged leader of that very party, whom he had publicly branded as a hypocrite, with the significant ap∣pellation of <HI>whited wall!</HI> Let it be also remembered that the supposed breach of the precept <Q><HI>(thou shalt not speak evil of the</HI> RULER <HI>of thy people)</HI></Q> could not rest entirely on the circumstance of KNOW∣ING ANANIAS TO BE THE HIGH PRIEST; for, whether the apostle <HI>did know,</HI> or <HI>did not know,</HI> that Ananias was <HI>high priest,</HI> yet he certainly <HI>knew,</HI> before he censured him, that he was <HI>a ruler of the people,</HI> and that he then sat in <HI>the quality of a judge;</HI> (for this is declared in the very censure itself, — <Q><HI>sittest thou to</HI> JUDGE ME <HI>after the law, and commandest me to be smit∣ten</HI> CONTRARY TO LAW?</Q>) so that whether <HI>Ananias</HI> was really <HI>high priest,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>or not, yet he was manifestly censured in his official capacity as a <HI>ruler,</HI> or <HI>ma∣gistrate,</HI> and not as a private individual, through any inadvertency or mistake of the apostle, as some commentators have conceived. And, even when the a∣postle was informed, by those <Q><HI>that stood by,</HI></Q> that the magistrate whom he had censured was the <Q><HI>high priest, ("revilest thou God's high priest?")</HI> Yet his reply, <HI>(I knew not, brethren, that there is a high priest,)</HI></Q> when fairly compared with the preceding censure of Ananias, as an <HI>unjust</HI> dispenser of God's law, <Q><HI>(sittest thou to judge me according to law?</HI></Q> &amp;c.) proves, as I before re∣marked, that the apostle neither ac∣knowledged the dignity of <HI>a high priest,</HI> nor that of a <HI>legal ruler, in the person of Ananias,</HI> though he knew him at the same time TO BE A RULER, and had censured him as such, for having noto∣riously prostituted the power and autho∣rity 
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>of a <HI>ruler,</HI> and violated the law, by commanding him to be <HI>stricken contra∣ry to law,</HI> notwithstanding, that <HI>he sat to judge</HI> (as the apostle remarked) <Q>AC∣CORDING <HI>to the law;</HI></Q> in which case no epithet whatever could be so apt and expressive to mark the true character of the dignified hypocrite in power, as <HI>whi∣ted wall!</HI> This proves, that the apostle knew well enough with whom he had to do. The censure was too just, and his prophecy in the accomplishment too true, (<HI>"God shall smite thee,"</HI> thou <HI>whited wall,</HI>)
<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot">(7) This denunciation of God's vengeance against Ananias was fully justified by the event; for, Josephus (as the learned monsieur Martin remarks) reports that he was killed in Jerusalem with his brother Ezechias. "Josephe rapporte," liv. 2. de la guerre des Juifs, <Q>qu'il fut massacré dans Jérusalem avec son frère Ezéchias.</Q></NOTE> to be esteemed a mere un∣guarded sally of resentment! The latter supposition is, indeed, inconsistent with the remarkable <HI>sagacity, prudence,</HI> and <HI>readiness</HI> of <HI>mind,</HI> which always distin∣guished
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>this apostle in bearing his testi∣mony to the truth, on the most danger∣ous emergences! The apostle's known character as <HI>a chosen vessel</HI> for Christ's service, and as an exemplary preacher of RIGHTEOUSNESS, will by no means permit us to conceive that he was either guilty of any <HI>mistake</HI> or <HI>inadvertency</HI> with respect to <HI>the person</HI> of the high priest on this occasion; or of any <HI>illegal</HI> or misbecoming behaviour to him as a <HI>ruler</HI> or <HI>judge</HI> of the people! When these several circumstances are compared with the general bad character of Ananias,
<NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot">(8) This malicious Sadducee very soon afterwards gave so flagrant a proof of his injustice and cruelty towards the Christians, that even the <HI>Jewish historian,</HI> Josephus, has recorded it as an event which gave offence to all good and loyal men at that time in Jerusalem; I mean the murder of the apostle James, bishop of Jeru∣salem, whom Josephus stiles <HI>the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ.</HI> The Jewish historian, therein, bears a remarkable testimony in favour of Christianity, — <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (for he is described, in the pre∣ceding quotation from Josephus, as a bold daring man of the most cruel sect,) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Which is translated by Mr. Whis∣ton as follows, — <Q><HI>When, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper oppor∣tunity</HI> (to exercise his authority). FESTUS <HI>was dead; and</HI> ALBINUS <HI>was but upon the road. So he assembled the sanhedrim of judges, and brought before them</HI> THE BROTHER OF JESUS, WHO WAS CALLED CHRIST, <HI>whose name was</HI> JAMES, <HI>and some others,</HI> (or some of his companions,) <HI>and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he de∣livered them to be sioned. The</HI> MOST EQUITABLE OF THE CITIZENS, AND SUCH AS WERE THE MOST UNEASY AT THE BREACH OF THE LAWS, DIS∣LIKED WHAT WAS DONE. <HI>They also sent to the king,</HI> (Agrippa,) <HI>desiring him to send to</HI> ANANUS, <HI>that he should act so no more; for that what he had already done was not to be justified.</HI></Q></NOTE>
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>as a persecuting zealot of the most virulent and intolerant sect among the Jews, it must appear that the apostle accounted that person unworthy of any esteem as a magistrate, whom he had so publicly con∣victed
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>of abusing and perverting the legal authority with which he had been en∣trusted; and, indeed, a notorious breach of the law, by any man in the capacity of <HI>a ruler,</HI> may reasonably be esteemed a temporary disqualification for such an honourable trust; for, a <HI>judge</HI> without <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>righteousness,</HI> who openly per∣verts judgement, does thereby unques∣tionably degrade himself from the dig∣nity of his station, and render himself unworthy, for the time being, of that respect which is otherwise due to his rank in office. The same apostle, in∣deed, upon another occasion, commands us to give <HI>"honour to whom honour" is due;</HI> but what <HI>honour</HI> can be due to a convicted hypocrite, — a <Q><HI>whited wall,</HI></Q> — a <Q><HI>wolf in sheep's cloath∣ing,</HI></Q>— to an <Q><HI>Ananias on the seat of judgement?</HI></Q> SUCH characters must expect SUCH treatment, as <HI>Ananias</HI> met with, from all sensible and discerning
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>men; if the latter are also equally <HI>loyal</HI> with the apostle, I mean in the strict and proper sense of the word <HI>loyal,</HI> (which is so frequently misapplied and perverted by sycophants,) that is, if they are equally zealous with that a∣postle for <HI>law, justice,</HI> and <HI>righteousness,</HI> for the general good of mankind! So that if we approve of the apostle's ad∣vice, in the beginning of the same sen∣tence, viz. <Q>RENDER, THEREFORE, UNTO ALL THEIR DUES,</Q>—<Q><HI>tri∣bute, unto whom tribute,</HI></Q>—<Q><HI>custom, to whom custom,</HI></Q>—<Q>FEAR, <HI>to whom FEAR,</HI></Q>—<Q>HONOUR <HI>to whom</HI> HO∣NOUR;</Q> we must needs also allow, that the apostle's <HI>practice</HI> (even in his behaviour to <HI>Ananias</HI>) was strictly con∣sistent with his own declared <HI>precepts,</HI> and that he most justly <HI>rendered</HI> to <HI>A∣nanias</HI> HIS DUE, when he so severely reprimanded his conduct <HI>as a judge!</HI> When all these circumstances are duly
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>considered, the meaning of the apostle's reply, may, fairly enough, be para∣phrased in the words of LORINUS,
<NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot"><P>(9) <Q><HI>Nesciebam eum esse</HI> PONTIFICEM, <HI>quia, ex modo loquendi furioso, non videtur esse</HI> PONTIFEX, sed TYRANNUS.</Q> Many of the most learned and cele∣brated commentators have considered the apostle's censure nearly in the same light. In the learned com∣mentary, commonly called Assembly's Annotations, the same sense is applied to the apostle's reply to the charge of having <HI>reviled God's high priest,</HI> viz. <Q><HI>I knew him not to be a lawful high priest,</HI> WHO THUS VIO∣LATETH THE LAW; and, indeed,</Q> (says the Com∣mentary,) "<HI>he was but an usurper.</HI> — For proof of which they refer us to <Q>Josephus, Ant. l. 20. c. 3.5.

<P>The learned MATHIAS FLACIUS FRANCOWITZ remarks, that the famous <HI>Augustine,</HI> bishop of Hippo, thought this reply of the apostle IRONICAL,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>IRONIAM esse putat Augustinus. Est sane quiddam vicinum ironiae.

<P>It would be tedious to quote all the authorities that may be found to this purpose; the evidence, however, of the learned Dr. Whitby, as it includes more au∣thorities than his own, is worthy the readers notice.—<Q>Dr. LIGHTFOOT <HI>and</HI> GROTIUS (says he) <HI>think as I do, that St. Paul does</HI> NOT <HI>go about</HI> TO EXCUSE HIS MISTAKE, <HI>but rather saith, I</HI> KNOW WELL ENOUGH THAT GOD'S HIGH PRIEST IS NOT TO BE REVILED, <HI>but that this</HI> ANANIAS <HI>is a</HI> HIGH PRIEST, <HI>I know not, i. e.

<PB N="58" REF="57"/>as I find him quoted by CORNELIUS A LAPIDE, viz. <Q><HI>I knew not that he
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>was the high priest,</HI> because, from his furious manner of speaking, he did not seem to be a HIGH PRIEST, but a TYRANT.</Q> This sense is strictly consonant to <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>natural right!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> are so in∣separably connected with the proper character of a CHIEF MAGISTRATE or RULER, that any notorious perversion of those necessary principles, in the ac∣tual exercise of that official power with
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>which a magistrate is entrusted for <HI>legal</HI> (and not for illegal) purposes, must un∣avoidably distinguish the <HI>contemptible hypocrite,</HI> THE WHITED WALL, from the honourable MAGISTRATE, and de∣prive the former of the respect which is due only to the latter! <Q><HI>Sittest thou to judge me</HI> ACCORDING TO THE LAW, <HI>and commandest me to be smitten</HI> CON∣TRARY TO LAW?</Q> Thus the a∣postle clearly explained the fitness and propriety of the reproachful figure of speech, <HI>(whited wall,)</HI> by which he had expressed the true character of the unworthy judge!</P>
<P>An appellation similar to this was given, even by our Lord himself, to <HI>the Scribes and Pharisees,</HI> who were the teachers and magistrates of the people: <Q><HI>Wo unto you,</HI> SCRIBES <HI>and</HI> PHARI∣SEES, HYPOCRITES; <HI>for ye are like unto</HI> WHITED SEPULCHRES, <HI>which,

(v. 33.) Nay, Herod himself, the tetrarch of Galilee, was not exempt∣ed from the severity of our Lord's cen∣sure, when there was a proper occa∣sion to declare it; for, though our Lord lived, for the most part, under Herod's temporal jurisdiction, that is, in GALI∣LEE, yet he openly characterised the <HI>craf∣ty, base,</HI> and <HI>self-interested,</HI> disposition of the TETRARCH, by expressly cal∣ling him <HI>a</HI> FOX,—
<NOTE N="(10)" PLACE="foot"><P>(10) <HI>"The message, our Lord here sends to Herod,"</HI> (says a sensible and learned commentator, the Rev.

<NOTE N="(11)" PLACE="foot">(11) <Q><HI>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,</HI> YET HE OPENED NOT HIS MOUTH: <HI>he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter; and, as a sheep before her shearers</HI> IS DUMB, SO HE OPENED NOT HIS MOUTH. <HI>He was taken from prison, and from judgement: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken!</HI></Q> Isaiah liii. 7, 8.</NOTE> yet he made an apparent distinction be∣tween the VIOLENCE <HI>and</HI> INJUSTICE of these, as <HI>individuals,</HI> and the INJUS∣TICE of a man in a <HI>public character,</HI> as a <HI>chief magistrate;</HI> for even, in our Lord's state of extreme humiliation, when his hour of sufferings was come, he did not fail to rebuke <HI>the</HI> INJUSTICE of the <HI>high priest</HI> in his judicial capacity, because, instead of proceeding against him by the legal method of <HI>examination by wit∣nesses,</HI> he had attempted to draw out matter of accusation from his own mouth, against himself, by INTERRO∣GATORIES, according to the baneful method of arbitrary courts!</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="64"/>But our Lord soon put a stop to his impertinent QUESTIONS, by referring him to the legal method of finding evi∣dence by witnesses: —<HI>Why</HI> ASKEST <Q><HI>thou me?</HI> ASK <HI>them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</HI></Q> John xviii. 21. Upon which, a time-serving of∣ficer, who probably had not accustom∣ed himself to distinguish the different degrees of respect that are due to <HI>good</HI> and <HI>bad</HI> magistrates, <Q><HI>gave Jesus a blow, or rap with a rod,</HI></Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,) saying, <Q><HI>Answerest thou the high priest so?</HI></Q> (v. 22.) which open in∣justice, to a person uncondemned, (even while he stood in the presence of the ma∣gistrate, who ought to have protected him,) drew a farther <HI>remonstrance,</HI> even from the meekest and humblest man that ever was on earth, though the same divine person afterwards suffered much greater indignities <HI>in silence!</HI> For, <Q><HI>Je∣sus
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>answered him,</HI></Q>—<Q><HI>If I have spo∣ken evil,</HI></Q> (said he,) <Q><HI>bear witness of the evil: but, if well, why smitest thou me?</HI></Q> (V. 23.)</P>
<P>This shews that the reprehension of magistrates and their officers, for <HI>in∣justice</HI> and <HI>abuse of power,</HI> is not incon∣sistent with the strictest rules of <HI>Christi∣an</HI> PASSIVE OBEDIENCE: and, though the apostle Paul, in a similar case, used much harsher language, yet his censure was undoubtedly <HI>just</HI> and <HI>true,</HI> and the severity of his expressions was plainly justified (as I have already shewn) by the event! i. e. <HI>by the fatal catastrophe of</HI> ANANIAS. The law, therefore, which forbids <HI>the speaking evil of the ruler of the people,</HI> is certainly to be understood with proper exceptions, so as not to ex∣clude any just censure of <HI>rulers,</HI> when their <HI>abuse of office,</HI> and the cause of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>justice,</HI> may render such cen∣sure
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>expedient and seasonable. That the apostle Paul thus understood the text in question, is manifest from his man∣ner of quoting it, when he was charged with <HI>reviling God's high priest,</HI> if the severity of his censure be compared with the indifference which he shewed, im∣mediately afterwards, towards the of∣fended <HI>Sadducee,</HI> by openly professing himself to be of an opposite party, and by throwing an oblique charge against the whole body of Sadducees, as the principal authors of the unjust persecu∣tion against himself,—<Q><HI>I am a</HI> PHARI∣SEE,</Q> (said he,) <Q><HI>the son of a</HI> PHA∣RISEE; <HI>of the hope and resurrection of the dead am I called in question.</HI></Q> (Acts xxiii. 6.) Thus he manifestly threw the whole blame upon <HI>the Sadducees,</HI> and thereby shewed no inclination to apolo∣gize for the severity of his speech to their dignified chief!</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="67"/>I must farther remark, that the a∣postle's behaviour, in openly opposing the <HI>high priest,</HI> (who, as such, was also a <HI>chief magistrate</HI> and <HI>judge,</HI>) is by no means inconsistent with that excellent advice which the same apostle has laid down in the thirteenth chapter of his Epistle to the Romans, though it is frequently cited by the advocates for ar∣bitrary power, in order to justify their false notions concerning the necessity of <HI>absolute submission and entire passive obe∣dience!</HI></P>
<P>To an inattentive reader, indeed, the apostle's expression may seem too much to favour such doctrines, if the sense and connexion of the whole context are not carefully weighed together; but though he said,—<Q><HI>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the pow∣ers that be are ordained of God. Whoso∣ever
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>therefore, resisteth the power, re∣sisteth the ordinance of God: and they, that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation.</HI></Q> Yet he immediately af∣terwards signifies what kind of <HI>rulers</HI> he spoke of "that were not to be resisted." "<HI>For</HI> RULERS" (says he in the very next verse) <Q>ARE NOT A TERROR TO GOOD WORKS, BUT TO THE EVIL. <HI>Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is</HI> GOOD, <HI>and thou shalt have praise of the same; for he is the</HI> MINISTER <HI>of</HI> GOD <HI>to thee for</HI> GOOD.</Q> (But ANANIAS, as <HI>a ruler,</HI> was certainly the very reverse of this description, so that the practice of the apostle, with respect to him, was by no means opposite to this doctrine.) <HI>"But"</HI> (says he) <Q><HI>if thou do that which is</HI> EVIL, <HI>be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is</HI> THE MINISTER OF GOD, <HI>a revenger to</HI> (execute) <HI>wrath upon him that doeth evil.

<PB N="70" REF="69"/>for wrath, but also</HI> FOR CONSCI∣ENCE SAKE. <HI>For this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are</HI> GOD'S MINI∣STERS, <HI>attending continually upon this very thing.

<PB N="71" REF="70"/>they maintain <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> in the execution of their <HI>public</HI> charge, howsoever deficient their characters may be in other respects, as <HI>private</HI> individu∣als; but, on the other hand, such an unjust <HI>ruler</HI> as <HI>Ananias,</HI> for instance, who <HI>sat to judge</HI> ACCORDING TO LAW, <HI>and yet commanded a person to be beaten</HI> CON∣TRARY TO LAW, such <HI>a ruler,</HI> I say, cannot be esteemed <HI>a minister of God to us</HI> FOR GOOD, or <HI>a minister of God</HI> in any respect whatsoever. A man, who is notoriously guilty of perverting the laws, and of abusing the delegated power, with which he is entrusted, by acts of <HI>vio∣lence</HI> and <HI>injustice,</HI> is so far from being <HI>"the minister of God,"</HI> that he is mani∣festly <HI>"the minister of the devil;"</HI> which is the express doctrine of <HI>the common law of this kingdom,</HI> according to the most approved and most antient autho∣rities; wherein we find it applied not merely to inferior <HI>rulers,</HI> but to the su∣preme

<P>This heavenly <HI>principle</HI> is the true and proper ground for <HI>patriotism,</HI> and undoubtedly has always been the pre∣dominant motive of great and good men, (such as the disinterested and loyal apo∣stle Paul, following his Lord's exam∣ple,) in their opposition to the injustice of <HI>rulers</HI> and <HI>magistrates,</HI> though they <HI>passively</HI> submit to personal injuries from other hands! for, in this, as I have al∣ready remarked, consists the due dis∣tinction between the necessary <HI>Christian submission to personal injuries,</HI> and the doctrine of an <HI>unlimited passive obedience.</HI></P>
<P>The SUBJECTION and OBEDIENCE to MAGISTRATES, enjoined by the same apostle in his Epistle to Titus, (c. iii. 1.) must certainly be understood with the
<PB N="78" REF="77"/>same necessary limitations,—<Q><HI>Put them in mind</HI> (says the apostle) TO BE SUB∣JECT TO PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS, TOOBEY MAGISTRATES,</Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, says he, but then he im∣mediately subjoins,) <Q><HI>to be ready to e∣very good work.</HI></Q> — And no man can be esteemed <Q><HI>ready to every good work,</HI></Q> if he is <HI>obedient</HI> to magistrates when their commands exceed the due li∣mits of the law; or if (contrary to the ex∣ample of the apostle himself) he neglects a fair opportunity of publicly discounten∣ancing and censuring any notorious per∣version of <HI>justice and right</HI> by a magistrate!</P>
<P>The same necessary limitation of the doctrine of <HI>obedience</HI> must also be un∣derstood when we read the exhortation of another apostle on this head, viz. <Q><HI>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the</HI> KING, <HI>as supreme; or
<PB N="79" REF="78"/>unto</HI> GOVERNORS, <HI>as unto them that are sent by him</HI> FOR THE PUNISH∣MENT OF EVIL DOERS, <HI>and for the</HI> PRAISE OF THEM THAT DO WELL. <HI>For so is the will of God, that with</HI> WELL-DOING <HI>ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: as free, and not using</HI> (your) <HI>liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God!</HI></Q> (1 Peter ii. 13-16.)

<NOTE N="(18)" PLACE="foot">(18) The apostle Paul was so far from retracting any part of his severe censure and remonstrance against Ananias, that he afterwards (before Felix) defied Ananias and the rest of his accusers to shew that he had been guilty of any the least misdemeanour ever since his last arrival at Jerusalem, and more particularly while <HI>"he stood before the council,"</HI> (meaning the time when he foretold that God should smite that <HI>whited wall,</HI> Ananias,) "or else" (said he to Felix) <Q>let these same here say,</Q> (meaning the high priest <HI>Ananias,</HI> the elders, and their orator, Tertullus, mentioned in the first verse of the chapter,) <Q><HI>if they have found any</HI> EVIL DOING

<PB N="80" REF="79"/>manifest perversion of the text to sup∣pose that we are required thereby to <Q><HI>submit ourselves to every ordinance of
<PB N="81" REF="80"/>man,</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="(19)" PLACE="foot"><P>(19) The apostles and disciples of Christ were so far "from <HI>submitting themselves to every ordinance of man,</HI>" that they boldly rejected the <HI>unjust</HI> commands even of the high priest and the whole national council of the Jewish state! The great council, called SANHEDRIM, i. e. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (the commands of which they rejected,) in∣cluded at that time all persons of their nation that bore any public authority or dignity among them, for the text expressly informs us that <Q><HI>their</HI> RULERS, <HI>and</HI> ELDERS, <HI>and</HI> SCRIBES, <HI>and</HI> ANNAS, THE HIGH PRIEST,</Q> (and the <HI>high priests</HI> since the time of the Maccabees were generally considered as a sort of prin∣ces,) <Q><HI>and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</HI></Q></P>
<P>No power, therefore, amongst the Jews, could be more respectable (in regard to temporal authority) than this great national council: and the apostle Pe∣ter accordingly acknowledged their legal authority at first, by respectfully addressing them, saying,—<Q><HI>Ye rulers of the people and elders of Israel,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding the temporal authority of this awful assembly of <HI>rulers</HI> and <HI>elders,</HI> (or senators,) they were publicly disregarded and contradicted by the a∣postles even in their presence, upon the very first pro∣posal of an <HI>unreasonable</HI> and <HI>unlawful</HI> ORDINANCE; for <HI>"they called them,"</HI> (the apostles,) <Q><HI>and</HI> COMMANDED THEM <HI>not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.</HI></Q>—But <Q><HI>Peter and John answered and said unto them, whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things we have seen and heard.</HI></Q> (Acts iv. 19 and 20.) And afterwards, when they were brought a second time before the said great council to answer for their breach of this <Q>ORDINANCE OF MAN,</Q> <Q><HI>the high priest asked them, saying,</HI> DID NOT WE STRAIGHTLY COMMAND YOU <HI>that you should not teach in this name, and behold ye have filled Jeru∣salem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. Then Peter and the other apostle an∣swered and said,</HI>—WE OUGHT TO OBEY GOD RA∣THER THAN MEN,</Q> &amp;c. This sentence, in effect, holds good with respect also to the rejection of <HI>every public ordinance</HI> that is contrary to <HI>reason, justice,</HI> or <HI>natural equity,</HI> as well as those that are contrary to <HI>the written word of God!</HI> This I have shewn more at large in my Declaration of the People's Right.</P></NOTE> without admitting such just and necessary exceptions to the doctrine
<PB N="82" REF="81"/>as I have already cited from the example of the apostle Paul, and even from that of our Lord himself.</P>
<P>And, therefore, though the apostle Peter adds,—<Q><HI>Honour all</HI> (men): <HI>love the brotherhood: fear God: honour the king:</HI></Q> yet he must necessarily be understood to mean, with the apostle Paul, that we must render <Q><HI>honour to whom honour</HI></Q> is DUE, and not to
<PB N="83" REF="82"/><HI>honour</HI> such <HI>men</HI> and such <HI>kings</HI> as are unworthy of <HI>honour!</HI>
<NOTE N="(20)" PLACE="foot">(20) To the example of the patriotic apostle, Paul, upon this point, I must now add that of another cho∣sen vessel of Christ, the protomartyr <HI>Stephen:</HI> this excellent man, <HI>"full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom,"</HI> (Acts vi. 3.) <HI>"full of faith and power,"</HI> (v. 8.) <Q><HI>and whose wisdom and spirit none were able to resist:</HI></Q> (v. 10.)—This excellent man, I say, has left us by his own example an unquestionable precedent on re∣cord to demonstrate that HONOUR IS NOT DUE to the highest temporal authority on earth, not even to a <HI>great national council of rulers and elders,</HI> while they ex∣ercise their authority in <HI>unjust</HI> prosecutions, and abuse their power by enacting <HI>unreasonable and tyrannical or∣dinances.</HI> The great council of the Jewish state had <HI>"straightly commanded"</HI> the aposties and disciples of Christ (as I have already remarked in a preceding note) <Q><HI>not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus;</HI></Q> which command, it seems, was given lest their preaching should <HI>"bring this man's blood"</HI> (said the high priest, meaning the blood of our LORD JESUS) <HI>"upon us:"</HI> but <HI>Stephen</HI> paid so little regard either to the <HI>unlawful</HI> command itself, or to the reason of it, that he afterwards publicly upbraided the whole coun∣cil, with the high priest at the head of it, (in the most stimulating and unreserved terms,) as the betrayers and murderers of that just One!—<Q><HI>Ye stiff-necked, and un∣circumcised in heart and ears,</HI></Q> (said he to their faces in the public assembly,) <Q><HI>ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers</HI> (did), <HI>so</HI> (do) <HI>ye. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the</HI> JUST ONE, <HI>of whom ye have been now the</HI> BETRAY∣ERS <HI>and</HI> MURDERERS,</Q> &amp;c. (Acts vii. 51 and 52.) Words could not well be <HI>sharper</HI> than these, which is manifest from their <HI>effect;</HI> for the text testifies that <Q><HI>when they heard these things they were</HI> CUT TO THE HEART, <HI>and they gnashed on him with</HI> (their) <HI>teeth.</HI></Q> (V. 54.) Thus it clearly appears that the holy, inno∣cent, and meek Stephen did not think himself bound (like our undistinguishing <HI>passive-obedience</HI> men) to <Q><HI>sub∣mit to every ordinance of man,</HI></Q> &amp;c. nor to <Q><HI>honour all men,</HI></Q> without making reasonable and due excep∣tions! Nay, so far from <HI>honouring</HI> men merely on account of their <HI>temporal dignity,</HI> it is manifest that he treated the whole <HI>body of rulers</HI> with the utmost severity and contempt, while he thought them <HI>unworthy of honour,</HI> and yet there is no doubt but that he most conscienti∣ously, on every occasion, rendered <Q><HI>honour to whom honour</HI></Q> WAS DUE!</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="83"/>But what men (it will be said) are to be esteemed the proper <HI>judges of desert</HI> in such cases, so as to determine with propriety when <HI>honour</HI> is or is not to be rendered?

<P>In this <HI>hereditary knowledge,</HI> and in the proper use of it, (according to the different stations of life in which men subsist in this world,) consists the <HI>equality</HI> of ALL MANKIND in the sight of GOD, and also in the eye of <HI>the law,</HI> I mean the <HI>common law</HI> and rules of <HI>natural jus∣tice,</HI> which are formed upon the self∣evident
<PB N="86" REF="85"/>conclusions of <HI>human reason,</HI> and are the necessary result of the above∣mentioned <HI>hereditary knowledge in</HI> MAN. Every man <HI>knows,</HI> by what we call <HI>conscience,</HI> (which is only an effect of <HI>human reason</HI> upon the mind,) whether his own actions deserve the <HI>censure</HI> of the <HI>magistrate, who</HI> <Q><HI>bears not the sword in vain!</HI></Q> And the same prin∣ciple of <HI>hereditary knowledge</HI> enables him to judge also concerning the out∣ward actions of <HI>other men,</HI> whether they be <HI>just</HI> or <HI>unjust;</HI> whether they be <HI>praise∣worthy</HI> or <HI>censurable!</HI></P>
<P>But, if a man abuses his own <HI>natural reason,</HI> and suffers himself to be blinded by private interest, by passion, or un∣reasonable resentment, or by pride, en∣vy, or personal partiality, and is there∣by led to misconstrue the actions of his superiors, to behave unseemly to∣wards them, and to censure them pub∣licly
<PB N="87" REF="86"/>without a just cause, the <HI>consci∣ence</HI> of such an offender against <HI>rea∣son</HI> will speedily inform him that he has cause to <HI>fear the magistrate,</HI> and that he is liable to suffer for his misbe∣haviour <HI>"as an evil doer:"</HI> but, when the like faults are discoverable on the o∣ther side, that is, on the side of the superior or magistrate, (as it happened in the case of Ananias,) a <HI>just</HI> censure of the <HI>unjust</HI> magistrate, even though it comes from the poorest and meanest man that happens to be present, will have its due weight in the opinion of all unprejudiced and disinterested per∣sons, and may occasion a considerable check to the progress of <HI>injustice;</HI> and, therefore, if any man neglects such an opportunity (when he has it in his power) of making a personal <HI>protest</HI> (as Paul did) against the public injustice of a wicked magistrate, he strengthens the hand of iniquity by his timidity
<PB N="88" REF="87"/>and remissness, and becomes accessary to the public disgrace by refusing his endeavours, according to his abilities, (howsoever small,) to vindicate the <HI>laws of God,</HI> and maintain the <HI>common rights of his neighbours and brethren.</HI> Such an one unhappily demonstrates that he has more <HI>fear</HI> of MAN than of GOD, and much more <HI>love</HI> for <HI>himself</HI> than he has for his <HI>neighbour</HI> and <HI>country,</HI> and, consequently, in that awful day, when he <Q><HI>shall be judged by the law of liber∣ty,</HI></Q>

He, who denies this, is ignorant of the <HI>true dig∣nity of human nature,</HI> and wants a teacher to point out to him not only <HI>the equality of mankind before God,</HI> but also <HI>the uni∣versal conditions of man's subsistence in the world!</HI>—THE HEREDITARY KNOW∣LEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL may, at least, be esteemed as the ONE TALENT
<PB N="90" REF="89"/>for which <HI>all mankind</HI> are accountable to the universal Lord! And, therefore, if they wilfully <HI>abuse</HI> or <HI>bury</HI> THIS TALENT, they have surely nothing to expect but the condemnation above∣mentioned of the <HI>unprofitable servant!</HI></P>
<P>Shall we blame the patriotic apostle, then, for his zeal in vindicating <HI>the natu∣ral rights of mankind</HI> against an UNJUST JUDGE, when he had so fair an op∣portunity of protesting against his ini∣quity? God forbid! Let us, on the contrary, revere his example, which, in reality, affords no opposition to the doctrine laid down in the beginning of this Tract concerning the necessity of <Q><HI>Christian submission to personal inju∣ries.</HI></Q> If he, sometimes, freely and courageously expressed his <HI>resentment for personal ill usage,</HI>
<NOTE N="(23)" PLACE="foot">(23) In pursuing the examination of this subject con∣cerning <HI>resentment for personal ill usage,</HI> I was gradually led to consider the present unnatural though prevailing practice of DUELLING; and this occasioned my <Q><HI>Re∣marks on the Opinions of some of the most eminent Wri∣ters on</HI> CROWN LAW, <HI>respecting the due distinction between</HI> MANSLAUGHTER <HI>and</HI> MURDER,</Q> (printed in 1773,) which Remarks were, at first, intended as a continuation of this tract; but finding, soon afterwards, that some publication, to correct the common mistaken doctrines concerning <HI>manslaughter</HI> and <HI>duelling,</HI> was be∣come more immediately necessary, I thought it ad∣viseable to detach what I had written on that subject from this tract, and to print it as soon as possible, (with some sew alterations and additions,) rather than to wait for the publication of these other tracts.</NOTE> it was al∣ways
<PB N="91" REF="90"/>ways in vindication of <HI>the law,</HI> on which (next to the providence of God) the safety, liberty, and happiness, of the community depend; whereas, the <HI>hasty revenger of his own cause</HI> is so far from being a friend to the com∣munity, or a <HI>lover of liberty,</HI> that he himself is actually <HI>a tyrant;</HI> because he neglects the necessary doctrine of <Q><HI>Chris∣tian submission to personal injuries,</HI></Q> and on every occasion is ready to re∣venge his <HI>own cause</HI> with his <HI>own hand,</HI> and to usurp all the distinct offices of
<PB N="92" REF="91"/>judge, jury, and executioner! He is so far from vindicating <HI>the law,</HI> like the generous and patriotic apostle, for the sake of <HI>national liberty,</HI> that he manifest∣ly sets himself up <HI>above the law,</HI> (which is <HI>the first characteristic of a tyrant,</HI>) and thereby renders himself in fact an open enemy to <HI>liberty,</HI> and consequently <HI>a disgrace to society!</HI></P>

<ITEM>I. A Short Treatise on the English Tongue. Being an Attempt to render the Reading and Pronunciation of the same more easy to Foreigners. 1767.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Remarks on several very important Prophecies, first Edition, in 1768, (second Edition, 1775.) <Q>This Book contains, 1st, Remarks on the Prophecy of Isaiah vii. 13—16.—That <HI>a Virgin should conceive and bear a Son.</HI> 2dly, Re∣marks on the Nature and Style of prophetical Writings. 3dly, Remarks on the Accomplishment of Isaiah's Prophecy, (vii. 8.) <Q><HI>Within threescore and five Years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a People.</HI></Q> 4thly, On the Departure of the <HI>Sceptre</HI> and <HI>Lawgiver</HI> from Judah. 5thly, A Confirmation of the above Re∣marks by farther Examples drawn from the Prophets, &amp;c.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. A Representation of the Injustice and dangerous Tendency of <HI>Tolerating Slavery;</HI> or of admitting the least Claim of <HI>Private Property in the Persons of Men</HI> IN ENGLAND. Being an Answer to an Opi∣nion, given in the Year 1729, by the (then) Attor∣ney General and Solicitor General, concerning the Case of <HI>Slaves</HI> in GREAT-BRITAIN. 1769. <Q>This Tract contains many Examples of the monstrous <HI>Iniquity</HI> and <HI>Injustice</HI> of the Plantation Laws respecting Slaves; as also some Account of the gradual Abolition of the ancient English <HI>Slavery</HI> called VILLENAGE, which was at length happily effected by the Wisdom and Perseverance of the English Courts of Common Law.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Remarks concerning the Encroachments on the River Thames near <HI>Durham-Yard.</HI> 1771.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="2" REF="104"/>V. An Appendix to the Representation of the Injustice and dangerous Tendency of tolerating Slavery. (See Number III.) 1772.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. Remarks on the Opinions of some of the most celebrated Writers on CROWN LAW, respecting the due Distinction between <HI>Manslaughter</HI> and <HI>Murder;</HI> shewing that the Indulgence allowed by the Courts to <HI>voluntary Manslaughter</HI> in Rencounters, DUELS, &amp;c. is <HI>indiscriminate</HI> and without Foundation in Law; and is also one of the principal Causes of the Conti∣nuance and present Increase of the <HI>base</HI> and <HI>disgrace∣ful</HI> Practice of DUELLING. 1773. <Q>The peculiar Case of <HI>Gentlemen in the Army,</HI> respecting the Practice of DUELLING, is carefully examined in this Tract; as also the Depravity and Folly of <HI>modern Men of Honour</HI> falsely so called.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. In two Parts. 1. A Declaration of the People's <HI>Natural Right</HI> to a Share in the Legislature; which is the fundamental Principle of <HI>the British Constitu∣tion of State.</HI> 2. A Declaration, or Defence, of the <HI>the same Doctrine,</HI> when applied <HI>particularly to</HI> THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND. 1774. (2d Edition, 1775.) <Q>In these two Pieces many Examples and Proofs are produced concerning <HI>the parliamentary Rights of the People;</HI> viz. That the Assent of the People is absolutely necessary to render Laws <HI>valid:</HI> That a <HI>free</HI> and <HI>equal</HI> Representation of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom is necessary for the <HI>Salvation</HI> of the State, and the Security of <HI>Peace</HI> and of <HI>Property:</HI> That the Representatives of the People have no <HI>legal</HI> Right to give assent in any <Q><HI>new Device without Conference with their Countries:</HI></Q> That it is an ancient and just Right of the People to elect a <HI>new</HI> Parliament <Q><HI>every Year once, and more often if Need be;</HI></Q> and that no Regulations whatsoever, wherein the <HI>Representatives</HI> are made <HI>Judges of their two Elections,</HI> can be ef∣fectual against national Corruption! Examples are likewise here given of several <HI>surreptitious</HI> STATUTES that are void through the Want of <HI>due legal Assent;</HI> and of Others that are <HI>void</HI> by being
<PB N="3" REF="105"/>unjust and repugnant to <HI>constitutional Principles!</HI> The Danger of keep∣ing <HI>standing Armies</HI> is also demonstrated, and the Wickedness and <HI>Impolicy</HI> of Acting by <HI>national Corruption!</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></ITEM>

<ITEM>VIII. The just Limitation of <HI>Slavery</HI> in the <HI>Laws of God,</HI> compared with the unbounded Claims of <HI>the African Traders</HI> and <HI>British American Slave-holders.</HI> <Q>To this Piece is added a copious Appendix, containing, An Answer to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Thompson's</HI> Tract in Favour of the <HI>African Slave-Trade.</HI> Letters concerning <HI>the lineal Descent of the Negroes</HI> from the Sons of HAM. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Regulations for the gradual En∣franchisement of Slaves. A Proposal, on the same Principles, for the gradual Enfranchisement of Slaves in <HI>America.</HI> REPORTS of Determinations in the several COURTS OF LAW against Slavery, &amp;c. 1776.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. THE LAW <HI>of</HI> PASSIVE OBEDIENCE; or Christian Submission to personal Injuries: <Q>Wherein is shewn that the several Texts of Scripture, which command the entire Submission of <HI>Servants</HI> or <HI>Slaves</HI> to their <HI>Masters,</HI> cannot authorize the <HI>latter to exact an involuntary Servitude,</HI> nor in the least Degree justify the Claims of modern <HI>Slave-holders;</HI> and also that the several Texts, which enjoin <HI>Submission</HI> to <HI>Rulers, Magistrates,</HI> &amp;c. do not in any Respect authorize the dangerous Doctrine of <HI>an unlimited passive Obedience.</HI></Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>X. "THE LAW OF LIBERTY;" or (as it is called in Scripture <HI>by way of Eminence</HI>) "the <HI>Royal Law,</HI>" by which <HI>all Mankind</HI> will certainly <HI>be judged!</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="4" REF="106"/>XI. THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION; or a serious Warn∣ing to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her <HI>Colonies,</HI> founded on un∣questionable Examples of GOD's temporal Vengeance against Tyrants, Slave-holders, and Oppressors. 1776. <Q>The Examples are selected from Predictions, in the Old-Testament, of <HI>national</HI> Judgements, which (being compared with the actual Accomplishment) demonstrate "the sure Word of Prophecy," as well as the immediate Interposition of divine Providence, to re∣compence impenitent <HI>Nations</HI> according to their Works.</Q></ITEM>

<ITEM>XIII. THE CASE OF SAUL; being an Appendage to the former Tract, wherein the <HI>compound Nature</HI> and various <HI>Principles of Action in</HI> MAN (with the Reality of <HI>supernatural spiritual Influence,</HI> both <HI>good</HI> and <HI>bad</HI>) are proved by unquestionable Examples from the History of that unfortunate Monarch, and also from many other Parts of Scripture.</ITEM>
