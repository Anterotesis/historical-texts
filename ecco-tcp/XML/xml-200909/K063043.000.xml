<P>THREE or four years having elapsed since the representation of the fol∣lowing trifle, it will, no doubt, be thought extraordinary, that it should make its appearance in print just at the time when so capital a production as The SCHOOL for SCANDAL en∣grosses all theatrical attention: in some degree to excuse the ill-timing of this publication, the author assures the public, that the copy-right was disposed of, and some sheets of it in the press, before that Comedy appeared; otherwise they would never have been troubled with this apo∣logy, or the cause of it.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<SP>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. KING.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>WHEN a melodious lark, ascending, sings,</L>
<L>The wide expanse with shrilly echoes rings;</L>
<L>'Till, strongly winging his aerial way,</L>
<L>To sight he's lost, warbling his heav'n-tun'd lay!</L>
<L>Not so, when the young bird first 'ttempts a flight,</L>
<L>Emerging from his nest to dazzling light—</L>
<L>With flutt'ring pinions, half-form'd notes, dim'd eyes,</L>
<L>From the too pow'rful glare, he, trembling, hies</L>
<L>To some thick wood, low copse, or shady grove,</L>
<L>Where he, secure from birds of prey, may rove;</L>
<L>Where safely he may try his feeble wings,</L>
<L>There flits from spray to spray, and faintly sings:</L>
<L>Patient remains 'till strength and art are won,</L>
<L>Then soars and warbles 'gainst the noon-day sun!</L>
<L>But, when he ventures first t'explore the sky,</L>
<L>Should critic-buzzard, hawk, or kite be nigh,</L>
<L>Skimming and winding round, then on him dart,</L>
<L>His beak and talons dig into his heart;</L>
<L>No more he sings, no more can ever fly,</L>
<L>His artless song and self together die!</L>
<L>So will it fare with our green-bird or sparrow,</L>
<L>If, grov'ling found, you o'er him draw the harrow;</L>
<L>No more he'll chirrup his insipid note,</L>
<L>Or vainly gurgle his discordant throat:</L>
<L>O loss of losses!—ne'er to be recover'd—</L>
<L>A green-bird in a furrow you have smother'd!</L>
<L>But say you're merciful, and, 'stead of killing</L>
<L>The vent'rous fool, to rear him should be willing;</L>
<L>Pleas'd, he'll crack rape-seed, bucket raise of water,</L>
<L>T' amuse yourself, spouse, son, and pretty daughter;</L>
<L>And while he grunsell picks, or chickweed eats,</L>
<L>Will, chirping, thank each gen'rous heart that treats;</L>
<L>May learn the linnet's, lark's, canary's song,</L>
<L>His tuneful life if kindly you prolong;</L>
<L>And strive each hour t'improve his simple lay,</L>
<L>In clearer strains your favours to repay!</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. GOODMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>HERE, madam, if you please, we'll con∣clude the labour of the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call it rather the pleasure of the day, sir,—for such it is to me, I assure you—to you indeed, sir, I fear it must be otherwise—the instruction of a silly girl, no doubt, is painful and tedious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, madam, I did not call it labour in that sense; so far am I from think∣ing it irksome, the hours I pass in this our every morning's exercise, and the duties of my holy function, are the happiest of my life:—for, believe me, were you my own child, instead of my honour'd patron's, I could not love you better!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do I think Sir Thomas's affection (altho' the best of fathers) exceeds the very pa∣ternal regard you have ever been pleased to express for me—and—I know not why—I
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>think I feel not a more filial love for him, than for yourself, sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam, say not so:—the many hours we pass together in our delightful studies, beget in you a customary regard— think it no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps it is no more, sir, nay, it cannot—for never had a child a kinder parent!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor ever had a man a truer friend! Indeed, so general is his goodness, he might be a pattern for mankind:—he never saw an infant without a parent's fondness, or a grey head, but, like a child, he honour'd it!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Sir Thomas Richacre <HI>enters.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha! what, hard at it?—What is it?—Ethics or mathematics, astrology or the∣ology?—'tis a thousand pities, Doctor, your pupil is a girl, otherwise she would certainly be a bishop in time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not, papa;—you see Dr. Goodman, with as much piety, learning, good sense, and, I am sure, as good a heart as any, has hitherto attained to no greater dignities than rector of this parish, your chaplain, sir, and my tutor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were I, madam, what you are pleased to say of me, it does not at all follow I should ever be so exalted.—There are, no doubt, an infinitely greater number of deserving ministers than there are mitres, or even inferior dignities; but whoever has attained to that of an honest man, will feel, that church or state can never raise him higher!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so too, Doctor; and, in that respect, there is not a more exalted character than yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven forbid, sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But all this while I forget your boy, Doctor.—I made my morning's airing shorter than usual, that I might be in the way when he arrived.—He is not come yet, I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does young Mr. Goodman come home from Oxford to day, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, madam, I expect him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! I thought he was not to have come till next week, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, he'll be here to day, and then you may have a new tutor, for I suppose you have almost tir'd your old one.—I war∣rant, by this time, he can speak Greek as well as his father; what think you, Doctor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>I not only think that of him, sir, but, were he not my own, I could be bold to say, he is the most accomplished youth I ever saw, and, add to that—the best!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, George is a good boy!— ay, and a clever one too—every body says so as well as yourself:—but if they did not, the crow, you know, always thinks her own young whitest, ha, ha, ha!—Let me see,
<STAGE>[looking at his watch]</STAGE> 'tis past one,—will the rogue be here to dinner, think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>I expect him every moment, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Od! I wish he was come! I have not seen him this age:—and are not you glad he is coming, Emily?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, sir, very glad—for I think him a most amiable young man; and
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>have often thought it a thousand pities he is not heir to a good fortune; as this idolatrous world of ours, still worshipping a golden calf, would value him much more for inheriting a fund of wealth than virtues:—and a rich cox∣comb is oftner proposed to us poor girls, than the most deserving of our affections, whose me∣rits are not back'd with that powerful recom∣mendation—a great estate!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's very true, my dear,—too often the case, I must confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I make no doubt, but even our ridiculous worthless neighbour, Lord Sealand's addresses, would be esteemed an honour, and plain George Goodman's, an affront, to most great families in the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he is a peer of the realm, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, papa; and there are very few so ill-bred, as to think a coronet may sometimes cover a weak head, or a glittering star, a bad heart!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha! well said, my little sati∣rist!—We are to be honour'd with his lord∣ship's company to day at dinner, on purpose to see George.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>His lordship has been always kind enough to take great notice of my poor boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the only proof of understand∣ing he ever gave—and, but for that, he would be intolerable, with his unaccountable whims and caprices.—Now own, papa, don't you think it a strange amusement he has lately taken to, keeping sailing vessels, to be so often tossing about on the sea as he is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why ay, child, I think it rather too boisterous to be called pleasure; but he seldom makes a much longer trip than just across to Calais, to furnish himself with some of their knicknacks and fopperies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, papa; for such a finical wa∣terfly is he, that, when on shore, he lays out more money in powder and perfumes in a week, than, I fear, he gives to the poor in a year.—I never see him, papa, but I think of beau Mizen in the play. Ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, Emily, my dear, you, of all people in the world, should not be so severe upon him: he's a very warm admirer of you, you know; and has almost ask'd my con∣sent to marry you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is not a bit more in my good graces for that, I assure you, papa; for, could he obtain your consent, I believe he'd care very little whether he had mine or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir Thomas, I am persuaded, madam, will never grant one without the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I confide in, sir.—I suppose I shall be teiz'd to death with his supercilious nonsense to day, which he gives me to under∣stand he means for courtship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are not you delighted at the very idea of being his lady?—Countess of Sealand!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, indeed, papa; lud! lud! what a character! a foppish sailor! a compound of tar and civet! faugh!—I'd sooner marry our honest Old Metre yonder, and be dame to the clerk of the parish.</P>
</SP>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! here comes the old psalm-singer as fast as he can hobble.</P>

<P>Well? odzookers! who can be ill and look such a ruddy-cheek'd rogue as you in the face?—faith, you look bravely, my lad!— and a devilish handsome young dog you are grown! rare work, I warrant, he has made at Oxford, Doctor! how many dozen have you left crying their eyes out, eh, George?</P>

<P>To what end, sir, so young and un∣provided for, as I am?—But, excuse me, sir, for interrupting you by hoping Miss Richacre is well.</P>

<P>Ay, Emily is pure hearty, and as reserv'd as yourself—She wont confess the power of the little blind boy any more than you.</P>

<P>The longer she is, sir, before she makes her choice, we may reasonably hope the better it will be.—But, I believe, sir, she may wait long indeed, before she finds one to de∣serve her.</P>

<P>Not so neither, George—for, as my mother used to say to me, those eyes of yours will make many a pretty girl's heart ach—so, don't be timorous, lad, but look about you; and, if you take a liking to a girl, let her be who she may, attack her boldly—I am a

<P>Pretty constantly, sir—the only re∣turn in my power for your great bounty to me, was the making a proper use of it.—But, if I may be so bold, sir, I think you mentioned something of Lord Sealand's having paid his addresses to Miss Richacre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, George, I believe I might—</P>

</SP>
<STAGE>[Metre talks apart with Dr. Goodman.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that I believe Emily likes him a jot better for those accidental advan∣tages, as she calls them—She and I are much of a mind about him; for, in my opinion,
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>he is but a frothy kind of a spark, like too many of the present age—and it is paying you no compliment, George, to say such a lad as you are, is worth a score such as Lord Sealand.

<P>Vain of what such an old fellow as I say! no, no,—If Emily had said as much indeed—but, Doctor, I must rob you of George's company a little—come, boy,—you must go and ask my girl how she is—she'll be glad to see you, I'm sure—She just saw you alight, and scamper'd away to set her cap strait, or some such important matter—Come along, my boy, and I'll promise you a kiss for your pains.</P>

<P>Why, thou knowest, William, his lordship hath a great estate adjoining to his worship's—and, although he hath it not in his will, I fear, to do much good, it is in his power to do a great deal of harm, therefore,

<SPEAKER>Metre.</SPEAKER>
<P>William! thou art an honest righ∣teous lad, I verily believe; and, although it hath pleased heaven to place thee in so hum∣ble a station, the uprightness of thy heart would adorn the princes and the rulers of the land, more than their costly raiment, precious stones, purple and fine linen!</P>

<P>Taste it? ay, many a can do I toss off when I have my watch-coat and trow∣sers on, and am turning to windward in a brisk gale—but the flip I drink is not like the vile stuff commonly so call'd, for mine has a most delicate flavour, as I always mix it with capillaire.</P>

<P>Why, William, you have been drink∣ing sure, or you could never be so bold.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>William,</SPEAKER>
<P>Drinking, Patty!—I don't know what you mean by such an insinivation as that —I believe (ay, and you knows it too as well as I do) there ben't a soberer lad in all the parish—drinking!—lord help me!—if I have swallow'd a drop or a crumb of any thing since breakfast, but one horn of ale, and a bit of meat as big as my three fingers, I'm a drunk∣ard and a glutton into the bargain! and I'd as lief be thought a thief as either—so you shou'd not say that of me, Patty!</P>

<P>Well, that's none of my business, you know—I don't concern myself about inferior servants!—all I desire of you is, that you will not make so free with me for the future as you have had the confidence to do lately, for I am determin'd I won't put up with it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I am sure you can't say I ever behav'd uncivil to you, Patty—and if so be I have made bold to tell you I lov'd you, I said nought but truth—ay, and you have said as much to me more than once, for all you're so scornful now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say I lov'd you? no, William!—I own I had a sort of friendship for you, because I thought you an honest young man and so forth—but, love? O, no, William! I am very sorry you mistook my civility—I never had such a thought I assure you—I have very different views!</P>

<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patty!—eh?—what do you say?— don't you go to—dear Patty!—odrabbit it! my heart's so full I can't speak to her—and, if I could help it, I'd never speak to her again!</P>

<SPEAKER>Patty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be very glad of it—and I desire, nay, I insist upon it, that you never offer to open your lips to me again; for if you do I sha'n't answer you, and so, your ser∣vant!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, Patty—one word more before we break off our courtship—for a courtship it has been, say what you will—ay, and a tender one too! or else when I set off for Oxford so long ago with Master George—</P>

<P>Ay, bless his dear soul! there's no name too kind for him—but, as I was going to say—if so be you was not in love with me, as well as I in love with you, why did you break this bit of gold with me, which I have worn next my heart ever since? but I'll be hang'd if I wear it any longer—come off, rot thee!—there, there's your keep-sake, your love-token again! and you're a false-hearted girl!— and if you'll promise never to speak to me again, I never will to you while I have breath in my body!</P>

<P>Nay, ma'am, I only just spoke—for brothers and sisters did formerly marry I grant, or the world could not have been peopled— but that's quite out of fashion now, you know, ma'am—unless indeed you had been roman∣catholic-papishes, and were lucky enough to be Sir Thomas's children instead of Dr. Good∣man's; because I have heard say, if people have but money enough, the pope will grant a —compensation—I think they call it, or some such hard name, (I suppose it means an act of parliament) for a man to marry his own grand∣mother! but indeed, ma'am, if I was you, I'd think no more of my brother, but take Sir Thomas at his word, and marry my father— that is, as he is <HI>not</HI> your father.</P>

<P>Pho, never heed riches, Patty— it's none but those who have too much already, that marry for the lucre of gain!—not that I be poor neither—last wages, I gave my father to save for me, made (with what he had before of mine) forty-four pounds, twelve shillings and fix-pence—that is, in even money, forty-two golden guineas and a half—so, you see, Patty, I be somebody, and ha' gotten a good round sum to begin the world—but, if we had not a sixpenny-piece between us, a young cou∣ple that have health and limbs to work, a good heart, and a sound conscience, have enough to begin twenty worlds!</P>

<P>Why you are to know, joy, I am just come full sail upon the outside of a horse (with another in tow) from the salt-sea-shore, to bring you advice of a sweet cratur, a female young woman, (belonging here) and my master Lord Sealand—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="85" REF="93"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Scoundrel!—</P>
</SP>

<P>Indeed you may say that—more pity the two words should ever be splic'd to∣gether!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>But your news, sir, your news!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know, I receav'd orders from Mounseer Powder-puff, my lord's walley-de-shaver, to have our skiff ready to carry my lord, and the young woman I mention'd, aboard our cutter, the Tarquin—but I soon found, by her unwillingness, that she was not a volunteer of her own accord; but had been press'd into the sarvice without giving her con∣sent to it—so, faith! I began to be a little queer with my lord about it; for the sweet cratur look'd as innocent as a sucking dove, ay, or a new-born dove's egg! and I determin'd not to aid and assist at making her otherwise!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eternal blessings on you for your goodness!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Devil a goodness in the case, honey —'twas no more than the duty of every honest man that is not a rogue!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me your hand, my heart of oak! I am your friend for ever!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, while we were raving and squabbling within half a cable's length of land, a good clever likely young jontleman, and a carrotty-pated livery-servant, came galloping and splashing into the salt-sea, as if they were riding post over to France or Holland! for their horses were fairly afloat, and half way to the skiff in the turning of a handspike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, friend!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hollo! you young harebrains! says I—have a care you don't run foul of our
<PB N="86" REF="94"/>little nut-shell, and spill us all! upon which the poor girl cry'd out, it was her brother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Metre.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her brother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Devil fire me! says little Brian O'Connor (that's myself) if their beasts shall board us, and send us to the bottom, if he was your brother and sister too! but, do you hear, young jontleman? says I, have a little wit in your folly, and don't fink your friends and your foes together, but take in a reef a two and we'll be alongside you presently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was right, friend, that was right!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon which, you may take your swear, my bug-of-a-lord did all he could to prevent my carrying the boat ashore—and, at last, when he found nothing else would do, (nor that neither) was trying to hussle me overboard—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Metre.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it possible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed it was not!—for, as soon as I perceav'd it, Oho! thinks little Brian, are you for that fun? I'll be bound I match you to a tittle, my jewel! so, upon my conscience, I made no more ceremony, but gave him as pretty a genteel lift as you shall see in a sum∣mer's day, and capsiz'd him (souse!) headlong into the wet ocean! where he look'd, for all the world, like the gold and filver fish folks keep in glass washing-rubs!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! well done, well done, i'faith!</P>

<P>But (notwithstanding his demerits) he was not drowned, sir, I hope!</P>

<P>No, faith, sir, as ill luck would have it, he was not drown'd.</P>

<P>The more the pity, say I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my conscience, sir, you say very right—it was God's mercy and a thousand pities sure enough! but I take it he was a little damp or so, for when he scrambled ashore, the salt brine ran from him by pailfuls.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, ha! I shall burst, I shall burst! upon second thoughts I am glad the dog was not drown'd, for if he had, I should have been kill'd outright.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, fait, and so would he too!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how ended the matter, pray sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>O, it was soon over, honey! for when I had thrown the whale into Jonas's belly—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Metre.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jonas into the whale's belly, I apprehend you mean, sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! the whale into Jonas, or Jonas into the whale, it's all one an't it? —when I had given my lord a summerset, I say, and spilt him into the ocean, we got ashore presently—but, as the young jontleman was hoisting his sister out of the boat, his draggle-tail'd lordship lent him such a pat o'the cheek, as was enough to break his hand∣some face, or put one of his forecastle lights out!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cowardly villain! but he re∣paid it, I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Och! I'll be bound he did—and with interest too—for he had the honour of horse-whipping his lordship to his heart's con∣tent! and (by way of premium) I divarted
<PB N="88" REF="96"/>myself the mean time with beating his impu∣dent French walley-de-shaver!</P>
</SP>

<P>Bravo! bravo! ha, ha, ha! but what became of the livery-servant all this while? sure he was not idle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, the lad with the bunch of carrots growing on his head? indeed he was not—for he had no sooner handed the poor frighted girl out of the gangway, and brought the two horses <HI>they went,</HI> and <HI>I came</HI> upon, to an anchor; but the tight lad beseag'd the coach-box, took it by storm, and is now piloting the young jontleman and lady safe into port here, aboard my lord's own chariot, fait: leaving him and his rascally companions to pad the hoof, and trudge home upon their ten toes!</P>

<P>Dear sirs! what am I to think?— within these few hours I thought myself the son of this worthy divine, and this sweet maid, your daughter, sir— <STAGE><HI>[to</HI> Sir Thomas Richacre]</STAGE> we then were wretched beyond idea, supposing our∣selves the issue of one parent! and now, sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, my dear boy! all is set right—you are my son, my own flesh and blood! at least your mother, Lady Richacre, (who was a pattern of conjugal fidelity) told me so—and Emily is as surely Dr. Goodman's daughter.

<P>Devil burn me! but this makes out the old saying good—that it's a wise father knows his own child—O no, fait, I don't mean so neither—(tho' that may be true too) but, it's a wise child knows it's own father!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most honour'd parent!
<STAGE><HI>[to</HI> Sir Tho∣mas]</STAGE> (if I really am so blest) may I presume to ask why we have both been bred in such a mutual error?</P>
</SP>

<PB N="91" REF="99"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell thee, George—I had ob∣serv'd, with great concern, how seldom young men, bred in the insolent pride of inheriting great estates, deserv'd them!—I am a whimsical old fellow, you know—and therefore proposed to, and prevail'd on, my respected friend (as we became widowers almost together) to join with me in a project I had formed (in imita∣tion of the Spectator's Leontine and Eudoxus) of exchanging children for a time—hoping thereby to render you more worthy than you might otherwise have been, of the fortune and title you was born to—the experiment was a singular one, I own, but the event has fully justified it!

<P>And, sir!—if I dare ask one question more—what recompence did you purpose to this young lady for being deluded with such an imaginary grandeur?</P>

<P>Was it to realize the golden dream?</P>

<P>Why, I had some such notion, indeed, George.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I remember right the story you alluded to, sir, the good, the generous Eudoxus, join'd the young and loving pair: is that my sire's intention? or (which I dread to ask!)— is it to—marry her yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha? what! marry Emily myself? bless her dear little heart, heaven forbid! no, no, I had a younger spark in my eye for her—</P>

<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Benignity itself! he means my George, I'm certain, and I shall yet be blest!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>And declare, that I am vet a beggar, if you add not to my late acquisition of for∣tune, the supreme delight of restoring this lov'd maid to the station she was bred in, by per∣mitting <HI>me</HI> still to call this best of men my father!</P>
</SP>

<P>What do you ask me for? she's none of mine, you fool! why don't you ask the Doctor?</P>

<P><STAGE><HI>[to</HI> Sir Thomas]</STAGE> My indulgent fa∣ther!
<STAGE><HI>[to</HI> Dr. Goodman]</STAGE> O, sir! either my behaviour has hitherto been unfilial, or you will kindly receive me for your son again.</P>

<P>Now, if my Emily thinks me not unworthy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>O talk not so! 'tis I that am unwor∣thy—yet wherefore?—if desert consisted but in riches, then I were indeed deficient! but, conscious of a mind superior to the distinctions of birth and fortune, I feel that I deserve your love! for, had our conditions really been as we imagined, preferring thee, the worthiest, to the most wealthy, I should have gloried in my acquisition more than in a conquest of the most exalted!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, my sweet Emily! I know it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, if my preserver loves like me, he will not ask, but take my trembling hand;

<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE><HI>[to</HI> Sir Thomas]</STAGE> I have so full a sense, sir, of your most unexampled goodness, in first adopting your poor girl, and now confirming thus your favour, I cannot thank you as I ought!—let these duteous, grateful tears speak for me!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good friend! the preserver of my Emily! amid these several transports I have too long overlook'd you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Och! no offence, gra! I have been overlooking you too, 'till I don't know what ails me fait! but I've a notion the salt-water that spalpeen of a lord splash'd in my face when I tilted him overboard, had not got out of the corners of my eyes before! for some drops trickled down the scuppers of my cheeks into my mouth just now that tasted quite brackish! they could not be tears sure! for (tho' we Irishmen are apt to make blunders) a
<PB N="94" REF="102"/>weather-beaten chap like myself would not cry, sure, at what he's so well pleas'd with!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a double title to my gratitude, as I receiv'd assistance from you against your own master; not fearing, in the cause of virtue, to offend the wretch you serv'd!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Connor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you what, honey!—Saint Patrick be thankful, I'm never afraid of doing what's right!—for tho' I'm but a menial man of low degree, I am sprung from a very great offspring, and have got the thick blood of the kings of Ireland bubbling in my veins, joy!— and, in my foolish way of thinking, so far from offending, I sarv'd my master most faithfully by not sarving him at all at all, in such an unjontlemanlike undertaking!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a right honest tar! and shall never serve any one again while you live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Indeed and I will always sarve both you and yours with all the blood in my bones!</P>
