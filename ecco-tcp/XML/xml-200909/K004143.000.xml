<L>IN lofty accents let thy voice be heard,</L>
<L>And shew the tribes the mandates of the Lord.</L>
<L>Through all the land proclaim what crimes abound,</L>
<L>Let every word loud like a trumpet sound;</L>
<L>Spare neither age nor sex, nor low nor high,</L>
<L>Let all the house of Jacob hear thy cry:</L>
<L>For from the lowest cottage to the throne,</L>
<L>All ranks of men in paths of vice have gone.</L>
<L>They much profess, but yet their meaning's naught,</L>
<L>For not one word's an emblem of their thought.</L>
<L>In shew fictitious they draw nigh to me,</L>
<L>And act as if Jehovah did not see.</L>
<L>With pomp and splendor, void of soul and grace,</L>
<L>They pay devotion in my holy place.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>A pleasure counterfeit smiles on each brow,</L>
<L>And songs melodious from their lips do flow,</L>
<L>That such as see them in this apish mode,</L>
<L>Would almost swear they did delight in God;</L>
<L>Yet all is fiction;—if you mark their course,</L>
<L>They still proceed from evil deeds to worse.</L>
<L>Their state devotion's all an action feign'd,</L>
<L>For when they worship God, curs'd self's their end.</L>
<L>Their slumb'ring priests like hirelings serve for pay,</L>
<L>And idly sleep and saunter out the day.</L>
<L>Like drowsy idle shepherds, who at noon,</L>
<L>Stretch out their lazy limbs upon the down,</L>
<L>And sleep securely in the heat of day,</L>
<L>While all their flocks do wander far astray:</L>
<L>And when the rav'ning wolves the sheep devour,</L>
<L>The shepherd lies supine, and sleeps secure.</L>
<L>At last the sluggard wakes, and as a proof</L>
<L>He loves the flock, he cries and scolds the wolf.</L>
<L>So thus the shepherds of the sacred fold,</L>
<L>They cannot watch, but loudly can they scold.</L>
<L>Even God himself, (they are so void of grace),</L>
<L>They even dare to scold him to his face.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5"/>'How vain is it for us to fast and pray,</L>

<L>'Or if he sees us, pays us no regard,</L>
<L>'Nor thinks our labour worthy of reward.</L>
<L>'Our schemes are baffl'd, and our troops defeat,</L>
<L>'And all our wisest projects are too late.</L>
<L>'The chiefs of Bozrah, who obey'd our laws,</L>
<L>'Have now rebell'd, and Libnah's join'd their cause;</L>
<L>'Now both are rebels, and defy our hosts,</L>

<HEAD>[THE WORDS OF THE ALMIGHTY.]</HEAD>
<L>Can such profane dissemblers think that I</L>
<L>Will either hear their voice or mind their cry?</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>For when ye seem to fast in outward shew,</L>
<L>You seek not things above, but things below;</L>
<L>Your souls are lofty, and your hearts are proud,</L>
<L>This all your actions do proclaim aloud;</L>
<L>For when ye fast, and feign t' afflict your souls,</L>
<L>You swing in pleasure, and ye swill in bowls;</L>
<L>And when ye come to bow before my throne,</L>
<L>Ye make your servants drudge like slaves at home.</L>
<L>You never fast but when ye mean to smite,</L>
<L>And never pray unless for power to fight.</L>
<L>No more ye mean when ye your sins confess,</L>
<L>Than to bribe heav'n for freedom to oppress.</L>
<L>Think ye that God, all gracious, ever will</L>
<L>Regard their litanies, who pray to kill?</L>
<L>To kill! and whom? your very flesh and blood;</L>
<L>Should I regard you, how could I be good?</L>
<L>Cease thus profanely to invoke my aid,</L>
<L>Or think I'll help to kill the souls I've made.</L>
<L>Ye tyrants, dread my thunder, fear your God,</L>
<L>And tremble at the lifting of my rod.</L>
<L>Is it a solemn fast to please the Lord,</L>
<L>To bow the head, and next transgress my word?</L>
<L>Can sack-cloth sanctified, conceal your sin,</L>
<L>Or hide from me your ugliness within?</L>
<L>All space I view, and all the orbs that roll,</L>
<L>Mine eyes behold, and penetrate the whole.</L>
<L>Your inmost thoughts, their secret springs I see,</L>
<L>Proceed from selfish vile hypocrisy.</L>
<L>To me's a fast an acceptable day,</L>
<L>When none but hypocrites do fast and pray;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7"/>When bended necks and stubborn hearts draw nigh,</L>
<L>To offer vain requests to the Most High?</L>
<L>Cry loud and long, yet for no other ends,</L>
<L>Except to kill their foes, enslave their friends.—</L>
<L>Who never bend their knees before my bar,</L>
<L>Till sin and guilt have plung'd them deep in war;</L>
<L>And then they think that I am so unjust,</L>
<L>To slaughter righteous men to feed their lust.—</L>
<L>Their lust of power; and when they steal my word,</L>
<L>Maintain they have dominion from the Lord.</L>
<L>Their legislature, though reverse to mine,</L>
<L>They yet eclept a government divine.</L>
<L>Such is their power and impudence of face,</L>
<L>They'd swear that Satan's power proceeds from grace:</L>
<L>Even Saul, Manasseh, Ahab, all these three,</L>
<L>Pretended each they had their power from me.</L>
<L>Yet they from me had power no other way,</L>
<L>Than wand'ring slaves have power to go astray;</L>
<L>For power to live and move implies no more,</L>
<L>Than to preserve what I have made before.</L>
<L>Abuse of power depends upon men's will,</L>
<L>And all must blame themselves when they do ill.</L>
<L>All just dominion hath its base in right,</L>
<L>And shines self-evident like beams of light:</L>
<L>Man's lusts apart, all mankind must agree,</L>
<L>That only righteous power proceeds from me.</L>
<L>None need dispute who has a right to rule,</L>
<L>The God of wisdom ne'er appoints a fool.</L>
<L>When fools wear crowns, and tyrants sceptres sway,</L>
<L>Then subjects sin not though they disobey:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="8"/>When legislative power's oppos'd to right,</L>
<L>Men are not rul'd by justice, but by might;</L>
<L>Force is no law, and violence no rule,</L>
<L>Who practice either must be knave or fool.</L>
<L>The scheme of government which I approve,</L>
<L>Is that which rules the heart of man by love.</L>
<L>What's Aaron's race or David's line to me,</L>
<L>When priests are proud, and kings love tyranny?</L>
<L>The poor man's interest, and his soul's as dear</L>
<L>In my esteem, as those of prince or peer.</L>
<L>Kings were appointed, legislatures made,</L>
<L>Mens int'rests to preserve, not to invade.</L>
<L>How great their power, how far their might should go,</L>
<L>Are things quite plain, not difficult to shew.</L>
<L>The end of power is universal good,</L>
<L>A thing conspicuous, easy understood.</L>
<L>First do no ill, than all the good you can,</L>
<L>This is the end of government to man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>INFERENCES.</HEAD>
<L>Kings often do, and princes oftimes pray,</L>
<L>For power to rule with universal sway;</L>
<L>For royal proclamations seldom come</L>
<L>Abroad, unless to bring dominion home.</L>
<L>When kings proclaim a fast, the blind may spy,</L>
<L>They have at least a vineyard in their eye.</L>
<L>Ahab, than whom a baser prince ne'er sway'd</L>
<L>A scepter o'er a nation, whin'd and pray'd;</L>
<L>Proclaim'd a fast at Jezebel's command,</L>
<L>And issu'd humiliation through the land:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="9"/>But underneath this mask dark vengeance lay,</L>
<L>And Naboth suffer'd when the court did pray;</L>
<L>The royal monarch gain'd his point at last,</L>
<L>And consecrated murder by a fast.</L>
<L>The venal minister's of Ahab's court,</L>
<L>Meant more by tasting than a simple sport;</L>
<L>Like cunning politicians, who conceal</L>
<L>Their dark designs against the commonweal;</L>
<L>Who, lest some prying folk should chance to know,</L>
<L>Strike up some novel masquerade or show,</L>
<L>Some Cock-lane Ghost, or if these fail, at last</L>
<L>Amuse the people with a <HI>public</HI> fast.</L>
<L>State humiliations are but state engines,</L>
<L>Intended chiefly to mask o'er black crimes
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I. Kings xxi. 1. to 13.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>Fasts seldom from the royal power proceed,</L>
<L>Unless the prince is sadly pinch'd indeed.</L>
<L>Give monarch's troops, and but the treas'ry fill,</L>
<L>They'll leave the tribes of men to fast who will.</L>
<L>A poor exchequer and the reg'ments thin,</L>
<L>To monarch's always is the greatest sin.</L>
<L>When loads of wealth are squander'd on their lust,</L>
<L>And all the pond'rous sums they hold in trust,</L>
<L>Are scatter'd far abroad to gather power,</L>
<L>They call it treason to refuse them more.</L>
<L>The subjects must not judge, although they pay,</L>
<L>How much the king and courtiers throw away.</L>
<L>Implicit faith to courts is reckon'd due,</L>
<L>And none have right to judge except a few;—</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="10"/>Whose int'rest always blinds their judgments so,</L>
<L>They never err, be't ill or good they do.</L>
<L>Thus faith politic, like men's creed at Rome,</L>
<L>Is free to be explor'd by only—<HI>some.</HI></L>
<L>The ignoble vulgar must remain content,</L>
<L>Though monarchs should mortgage the continent.</L>

<L>What men should ponder when they fast and pray.</L>

<L>E'ER since the time that monarchies began,</L>
<L>And monarchs claim'd dominion over man,</L>
<L>Princes who aim'd at arbitrary sway,</L>
<L>And meant to make their villains all obey;</L>
<L>Have brib'd an hireling priesthood first to blind</L>
<L>The human conscience, and debase the mind:</L>
<L>For ev'ry tyrant, if he loose his purse.</L>
<L>Will find some Balaam ready with a curse;—</L>
<L>Chearful to listen to his Lord's command,</L>
<L>To scatter heaven's vengeance through the land;</L>
<L>False prophets, Hannaniah like, to tell</L>
<L>When every thing is wrong, that all is well.—</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="12"/>Whose power of face, and vilest impudence,</L>
<L>Exceed the utmost bounds of all pretence.</L>
<L>They think no shame to tell the grossest lies,</L>
<L>And publish fictions for true prophecies.</L>
<L>E'en when an host advances in array,</L>
<L>Will gravely swear they saw them run away:</L>
<L>Make ign'rant fools believe (for there are fools</L>
<L>At all times ready to be great men's tools)</L>
<L>That if they bow their heads or bend the knee,</L>
<L>In formal, feigned, vile hypocrisy,</L>
<L>With bashful looks conceal the worst intents,</L>
<L>That then they keep divine commandements.</L>
<L>When Zedekiah erst o'er Judah reign'd,</L>
<L>And God's own people all his laws profan'd;</L>
<L>False prophets then▪ as well as prophets since,</L>
<L>Told lies and flattery to that weak prince:</L>
<L>They augur'd all things as the courtiers will'd,</L>
<L>But never found their prophecies fulfil'd.</L>
<L>E'en those who trusted to their prophecies,</L>
<L>In sad experience found them all prove lies.</L>
<L>When Salem's stately towers and walls around,</L>
<L>In ruins lay quite level with the ground;</L>
<L>The temple sack'd, and its foundation till'd,</L>
<L>Then were their godly prophecies fulfil'd.</L>
<L>Their haughty monarch, whose perverted mind,</L>
<L>To truth and all true discipline was blind;</L>
<L>Who to his flatt'ring sycophants gave ear,</L>
<L>For his credulity he soon paid dear:</L>
<L>He saw his kingdom lost, his city ta'en,</L>
<L>His dearest offspring in his presence slain;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="13"/>What now he saw was all foretold before,</L>
<L>He saw it true; alas, he saw no more!</L>
<L>The cruel Chaldean then put out his eyes,</L>
<L>And in his blindness prov'd the prophecies.</L>
<L>Helkiah's son, of Aaron's sacred line,</L>
<L>Of Anathoth, by augury divine,</L>
<L>In strongest emblems shew'd his dismal fate;</L>
<L>At last hew saw the truth; but ah! too late.</L>
<L>When Babel's warlike sons approached near,</L>
<L>And fill'd the tribes of Judah all with fear;</L>
<L>The wise foresaw the land's approaching doom,</L>
<L>And trembled for their miseries to come.</L>
<L>But Azur's faithless son, an augur base,</L>
<L>Who yet at court pass'd for a child of grace,</L>
<L>Brib'd by the ministry to publish lies,</L>
<L>Came forth with asses loads of prophecies.</L>
<L>Preach'd final conquest over every foe,</L>
<L>His lying pasquils o'er the country go,</L>
<L>Industrious spread by ministerial tools,</L>
<L>To gull th' unwary and to flatter fools.</L>
<L>Full fifty thousand in a month were sold,</L>
<L>From Salem to Beersheba I am told:</L>
<L>And when the faithless people would not buy,</L>
<L>The courtiers gave them out of courtesy.</L>
<L>So sanguine they to blind the people's eyes,</L>
<L>They turned pedlars of false prophecies.</L>
<L>And Shephatiah, D—h I would say,</L>
<L>As Balaam preach'd and publish'd, he did pay;</L>
<L>The old false prophet in his chariot flew,</L>
<L>And every lie he catch'd he dress'd it new;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="14"/>Curs'd as he went, and as his curses flow'd,</L>
<L>Held up his hands, and turn'd his eyes to God.</L>
<L>His sanctimonious phiz and sly grimace</L>
<L>Pass'd among partizans for signs of grace;</L>
<L>So reverend like he vamped all his lies,</L>
<L>That grossest falsehoods pass'd for prophecies.</L>
<L>Thus courtiers prais'd him, and the venal tribes,</L>
<L>Who judge a cause by int'rest, truth by bribes;—</L>
<L>Who rights divine or human will not see,</L>
<L>Unless unlock'd by int'rest's golden key.</L>
<L>Harden'd in sin, and vainly puff'd with praise,</L>
<L>He shew'd some marks which were not signs of grace;</L>
<L>For which th' Almighty gave him in his ire,</L>
<L>Nor son nor daughter to succeed their sire

<L>While things turn'd worse, and worse, and ev'ry day</L>
<L>Brought still new tidings of some fresh dismay,</L>
<L>The king alarm'd, and rous'd through fear, at last,</L>
<L>Turn'd first devote, and then proclaim'd a fast.</L>
<L>He call'd the priests and prophets to prepare</L>
<L>A scheme of fasting, and a form of prayer,</L>
<L>To try if heav'n would grant him power to kill,</L>
<L>All those that were not subject to his will.</L>
<L>Court, priests, and prophets, when that sov'reign's cry</L>
<L>Run at their call, and at their nod draw nigh;</L>
<L>For royal mandates have a powerful zest,</L>
<L>And like a mighty loadstone draw a priest.</L>

<L>Like Ahab's priests they would not be said nay,</L>
<L>Though God refus'd to hear, yet still they pray.</L>
<L>Than Hananiah none shew'd more zeal,</L>
<L>In fervent fasting for the commonweal;</L>
<L>With labour'd suits he pray'd, and while he cry'd,</L>
<L>The very God of battles he defy'd.</L>
<L>Of Jewish valour vauntingly he spoke,</L>
<L>And with a symbol brake the Chaldean yoke
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxviii. 10.</NOTE>;</L>
<L>Made all the tribes believe their foes would run</L>
<L>Like bats and owls before th' approaching sun.</L>
<L>He prov'd still more, that on that fatal day,</L>
<L>When Nergal
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nergal, a Chaldean officer.</NOTE> conquer'd, that he ran away.</L>
<L>Him fools believ'd, and liv'd in hope to see</L>
<L>The Jews victorious and the Chaldeans flee:</L>
<L>So strong their faith, they boast how ev'ry Jew</L>
<L>Had conquer'd squadrons, told they legions slew;</L>
<L>At their approach their foes still run away,</L>
<L>And yet the conquering tribes still lost the day.</L>
<L>When heav'n's ang'ry frowns their hopes beguil'd,</L>
<L>Then Hananiah swore Jehovah smil'd;</L>
<L>Told how their foes were blasted since that day,</L>
<L>The guilty Jews began to fast and pray.</L>
<L>Yet ev'ry post brought tidings worse and worse,</L>
<L>Oft' times the foot were slain, sometimes the horse:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="16"/>All this was prov'd a victory complete,</L>
<L>And those who vanquished were aye defeat.</L>
<L>Such power has fasting in the hands of kings,</L>
<L>It changes nature, and the cause of things.</L>
<L>Even sins are sanctified when princes pray,</L>
<L>And light turns darkness, darkness shines like day.</L>
<L>All this a venal priesthood will declare,</L>
<L>And consecrate plain murder lawful war.</L>
<L>Even so it was in Ahab's pious reign,</L>
<L>Baal's prophets pray'd till Naboth he was slain.</L>
<L>Whate'er the prince desir'd, with one accord,</L>
<L>The priests insur'd him always from the Lord.</L>
<L>Four hundred prophets in a lusty ring,</L>
<L>As they obsequiously stood round the king,</L>
<L>With rosy gills in cringing accents bless,</L>
<L>And swore that Ramoth Gilead sure was his.</L>
<L>But shall I prosper, the vain prince reply'd,</L>
<L>They all said prosper; but the prophets ly'd.</L>
<L>With hieroglyphic horns (vain symbols those)</L>
<L>To shew how wicked men would push their foes,</L>
<L>These lying prophets, with a solemn farce,</L>
<L>Made foolish Ahab think himself was Mars;</L>
<L>But when the awful day of battle came,</L>
<L>He found their words and deeds were not the same.</L>
<L>'Tis vain to fast and pray while men remain</L>
<L>Resolv'd to hold, and all their sins retain.</L>
<L>They can't be humble who resolve to sin,</L>
<L>Nor are they pure who lodge vile thoughts within.</L>
<L>'Tis no hard matter for to fast till four,</L>
<L>Then feast on turtle when the fast is o'er.</L>

<L>Minerva, loathing, turn'd away her eye,</L>

<L>Soon as she saw the goddess gay and bright,</L>

<L>Livid and meagre were her looks, her eye</L>
<L>In foul distorted glances turn'd awry;</L>
<L>A hord of gall her inward parts possess'd,</L>
<L>And spread a greenness o'er her cancer'd breast;</L>
<L>Her teeth were brown with rust, and from her tongue</L>
<L>In dangling drops the stringy poison hung.</L>

<L><PB N="18" REF="18"/>Restless in spite, while watchful to destroy,</L>

<L>Though men may fast, and with much fervour pray,</L>
<L>Malice and envy soon will guilt betray.</L>
<L>He who commits a crime will quickly find</L>
<L>The pressing guilt lie heavy on his mind,</L>
<L>Though bribes or favour should assert his cause,</L>

<L>None quits himself; his own impartial thought</L>

<L>It may do good even to a fasting lord,</L>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prime minister of Tiberius Caesar: He had many triumphal chariots and statues erected to him; but falling into disgrace, they were all broken down, and the Senate and people insulted over him as meanly as they had formerly flattered him.</NOTE>, almost first of Roman names,</L>
<L>'The great Sejanus crackles in the flames.</L>
<L>'Form'd in the forge, the pliant brass is laid</L>
<L>'On anvils, and of head and limbs are made</L>
<L>'Pans, cans, and piss-pots, and such kitchen stuff;</L>
<L>'Nor did their mean revenge think this enough:</L>

<L>'Good Lord, they cry, what blackmoor lips he has,</L>
<L>'How foul a smock, and what a hanging face!</L>
<L>'By Heav'n, I never could endure his sight;</L>
<L>'But say, How came his monstrous crimes to light?</L>
<L>'What is the charge, and who the evidence?</L>
<L>'There must be striking proofs of his offence.</L>
<L>'Nothing at all of this; but Caesar sent</L>
<L>'A threat'ning letter to the Parliament:</L>
<L>'Nay, Sirs, if Caesar writ, I ask no more;</L>
<L>'He's guilty—and the question's out of door.'</L>
<L>Now, with Sejanus wouldst thou change thy fate,</L>
<L>To be like him, first minister of state?</L>
<L>To have thy levees crowded with resort</L>
<L>Of a depending, gaping, servile court;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="21"/>Dispose all honours of the sword and gown,</L>
<L>Raise with a nod, and ruin with a frown;</L>
<L>To hold thy prince in pupilage and sway</L>
<L>The monarch whom the conquer'd world obey:</L>
<L>Yes, I believe thou would'st be great as he;</L>
<L>For every man's a fool to that degree.</L>
<L>All wish the dire prerogative to kill,</L>
<L>Even they would have the power that want the will.</L>
<L>But would'st thou have thy wishes understood,</L>
<L>To take the bad together with the good?</L>
<L>Would'st thou not rather choose the small renown,</L>
<L>To be the mayor of some poor paltry town?</L>
<L>Bigly to look and barbarously to speak,</L>
<L>To pound false weights, and scanty measures break;</L>
<L>Than be Sejanus, so advanc'd in place,</L>

<L>Great Hannibal within the balance lay</L>
<L>And tell how many pounds his ashes weigh;</L>
<L>Him Afric was not able to contain,</L>

<L>And weakens fruitful Nilus to convey</L>
<L>His sun-beat waters by so long a way.</L>
<L>Spain first he won, the Pyrenaeans past,</L>
<L>And frozen Alps, the mounds that nature cast;</L>

<L>What rare fifth act to crown this huffing play?</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>To see the wan-complexion'd, gambling crew,</L>
<L>In church sit cloister'd, fasting in a pew,</L>
<L>Yawning and panting till the hour's are past,</L>
<L>And longing more to break than keep their fast,</L>
<L>To hear the long rob'd gentry squeaking say,</L>
<L>Ah guilty! <HI>Miserere Domine,</HI></L>
<L>Is such a farce, would almost spoil the grace,</L>
<L>And pinch the skill of Aristophanes,</L>
<L>To give their characters a striking hue,</L>
<L>As they sit feign'dly fasting in the pew.</L>
<L>By play men's tempers are unguarded made,</L>
<L>And when the head's intent the heart's betray'd;</L>
<L>Then base desires of gain, then rage appears,</L>
<L>Next blows and brawls arise, and anxious fears;</L>
<L>Then clamour and revellings reach the sky,</L>
<L>While losing gamesters heaven and earth defy;</L>
<L>Then horrid oaths are utter'd every cast,</L>
<L>They grieve, and curse, and swear, nay, weep at last,</L>
<L>And in a pet will even feign to fast.</L>
<L>When lawyers fast, and when that gamblers pray,</L>

<L>When haughty churchmen are not fond of power,</L>
<L>Or when the strong do not the weak devour;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="23"/>Then shall dissemblers find it on record,</L>
<L>That when they fast for strife, they please the Lord.</L>
<L>But why do <HI>pious</HI> nations, in distress,</L>
<L>Flee to the Lord, and all their sins confess?</L>
<L>Sins, which they mean not ever to give o'er,</L>
<L>While sin brings gain, and vice increases power.</L>
<L>Can such believe the great Almighty's blind,</L>
<L>And does not see the errors of the mind?</L>
<L>Or that hypocrisy and vile grimace,</L>
<L>Is a fit off'ring to obtain his grace?</L>
<L>While secret vice lies lurking in the mind,</L>
<L>And guilty culprits to their faults are blind:</L>
<L>Though they may bow, and cringe, and fast a day,</L>
<L>In God's pure eye they neither fast nor pray.</L>
<L>A pamper'd prelate, finely deck'd in lawn,</L>
<L>To fast and pray, (by six fine horses drawn</L>
<L>In a gilt coach), and to confess the crimes</L>
<L>Of lords and scavengers, in these bad times,</L>
<L>Is so polite a mark of penitence,</L>
<L>That drunken peers can scarcely take offence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But why not join in praise as well as fast,</L>
<L>And thank the Lord for many favours past?</L>
<L>For smiling springs dress'd in a verdant green,</L>
<L>And gladsome summers which our eyes have seen;</L>
<L>With richest autumns in effulgence gay,</L>
<L>All nodding with a <HI>cornu copiae.</HI></L>
<L>For twenty seasons past, and some few more,</L>

<L><PB N="24" REF="24"/>Like children, who, for some conceiv'd affront,</L>
<L>Will fast in spite, if bid them eat they wont;</L>
<L>Take penance on themselves, 'cause Heav'n won't give</L>
