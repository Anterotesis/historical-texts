<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following <Q>Declaration of the People's natural Right to a Share in the Legislature</Q> is founded on Principles, which are cer∣tainly unquestionable, and cannot easily be controverted; but I was not aware, I acknowledge,<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>I freely acknowledge my deficiency in <HI>historical</HI> as well as most other branches of Learning, which re∣quire much reading and leisure to be obtained; but though this affords an argument against <HI>my own perso∣nal credit and abilities, in general,</HI> as a writer, yet it does not at all affect any particular point, which, in my se∣veral tracts, I have laboured to maintain; for, upon these, a candid Reader will determine according to the evidence produced, and not by the general character or <HI>demerit</HI> of the Author in other respects.</P></NOTE> when I sent the same to the Press, that there had ever been any Controversy before the 6th of King George I. concerning the Freedom of our fellow-subjects in <HI>Ireland,</HI> or that any Englishman, acquainted with the principles of our excellent Constitution of State, had ever, before that time, presumed to advance any doctrine which might tend to deprive our Irish Brethren
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>of their <HI>natural Freedom,</HI> and of the in∣estimable benefits of that happy legal Constitution, which British Subjects in general are commonly supposed to inhe∣rit by <HI>Birth-right!</HI></P>
<P>If I had not esteemed this point <HI>incon∣trovertible,</HI> when I wrote the said <HI>Decla∣ration,</HI> I should not have quoted the Union between <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land</HI> as an example of <Q><HI>the true constitu∣tional</HI> mode of <HI>connecting British Do∣minions</HI> that are otherwise <HI>separated by nature.</HI></Q> But having done this, and having also given several copies of the Declaration to my friends which cannot now be recalled, I have thereby brought upon myself the necessity of maintaining the propriety of the said example, which might as easily have been avoided, had I been aware of any such controversy; be∣cause the general principles, on which my arguments are founded, would have been amply sufficient (I apprehend) to prove the truth of my <HI>Declaration,</HI> even though <HI>Examples</HI> and <HI>Custom</HI> had been against it; for the Common Law of <HI>England</HI> teaches us, that examples and precedents are not to be followed if they are <HI>unreasonable,</HI> or inconsistent with
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/><HI>legal</HI> and <HI>constitutional</HI> Principles<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><P>This is clearly proved by a variety of unques∣tionable maxims;
<Q><L>Judicandum est <HI>Legibus, non Exemplis.</HI></L>
<L>Malus usus abolendus est.</L></Q>
<Q>In consuetudinibus non diuturnitas temporis, sod <HI>soliditas rationis,</HI> consideranda est.</Q>
<Q>Multitudo <HI>errantium</HI> non parit <HI>errori</HI> patroci∣nium.</Q></P></NOTE>; though, on the other hand, they are to be esteemed of very great weight and authority in Law, when there are <HI>no just exceptions</HI> against them<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><Q>— et quia consuetudines illae <HI>nec contra legem divinam nec contra rationem</HI> in aliquo existunt, et pro bono communi totius Regni ex earum diurni∣tate censentur, fore necessariae, <HI>vim Legis retinent,</HI> &amp;c. <BIBL>Doct. et Stud. c. 7.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. And of this latter kind is the Example which I have quoted to illustrate my Declara∣tion: for, though many great and respec∣table Writers have made <HI>exceptions</HI> to the constitutional Freedom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which I had supposed to be unquestionable, yet, after the most careful examination of their opinions, and the <HI>reasons</HI> given for the same, (in which the proofs ought to consist,) I am now fully convinced that there are <HI>no just exceptions</HI> against that example; and, consequently, I am bound in justice, to my fellow-subjects in <HI>Ireland</HI> not to give it up; because the
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/><HI>"necessity"</HI> (beforementioned) <Q>of main∣taining the <HI>propriety of the example,</HI></Q> ci∣ted in my Declaration, arises not from any obstinate partiality to my own as∣sertion, (which I confess was, at first, too hastily and unadvisedly made,) but from a firm persuasion, after a most cautious enquiry into the real state of the controversy, that the advocates for the Liberties of <HI>Ireland</HI> have Truth and Rea∣son on their side, which, (I hope) the 2d Part, now added to my Declaration, will sufficiently testify.</P>
<P>It is necessary also for me to guard against another objection which might perhaps hereafter have been started a∣gainst the following <HI>Declaration.</HI></P>
<P>I have quoted therein a maxim of the English Constitution, as a principle of <HI>natural equity,</HI> which had previously been denied that rank by one of the most eminent civilians of his time; and there∣fore, to avoid the influence of so great an authority against my Argument, I think it prudent, in this Preface, to examine the grounds of his objections, that my Readers may have sufficient evidence be∣fore them to distinguish where the truth lies; for it is certainly necessary for me
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>to establish the first <HI>principles</HI> on which I have proceeded, before I can expect to have any attention paid to the Arguments which I have built upon them.</P>
<P>The maxim which I wish to maintain is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> that <Q>Law, to bind all, must be assented to by all<NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot"><P>Principia Leg. et Aequit. p. 56. to which is added, by way of illustration, <Q>Canons therefore bind not the Laity.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q> This maxim I have quoted in the following Declaration as a principle of <HI>natural Equity;</HI> though, it seems, the learned Civilian, Baron Puffendorf, has expressly refused to rank it with the <HI>Laws of Na∣ture:</HI> He, or (rather I should say) his Translator, calls<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot"><P>The Edition which I have followed is only an English translation printed at Oxford in 1710.</P></NOTE> it only <HI>a notion.</HI></P>
<P>"We cannot here but observe," (says he,) <Q>that the <HI>Notion,</HI> maintained by some authors, <HI>That the Consent of the People is requisite to make Laws oblige the Subject in Conscience,</HI> is neither true <HI>in the Laws of Nature,</HI> nor in the civil Laws of monarchical or of aristo∣cratical Rulers; nor indeed at all, un∣less it be understood of implicit con∣sent; as a man, by agreeing to the
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>Sovereignty of another, is at the same time, supposed to have agreed to all the future Acts of that Sovereignty<NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">Law of Nature and Nations, Book 1. c. 6. p. 55.</NOTE>.</Q> (He has nevertheless thought proper to add an observation which makes strongly against his own argument.) "Though it would really be very useful," (says he,) <Q>and contribute much to engaging the Subjects in a <HI>voluntary Obedience,</HI> if the Laws could be made <HI>with their Consent</HI> and Approbation; especially such as are to pass into their Lives and Manners.</Q></P>
<P>Now it would be impossible (I appre∣hend) to find so just a reason in favour of the former part of the learned Baron's assertion, as he himself has here given <HI>directly against it;</HI> and yet he is frequent∣ly harping upon the same harsh string of absolute implicit obedience; which in∣consistency cannot easily be accounted for, unless it be attributed to <HI>the prejudice of his education</HI> as a student in <HI>the Impe∣perial or Civil Law.</HI> For though the Civil Law contains many excellent max∣ims highly worthy of our esteem, most of which have been adopted by our an∣cient
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>English writers of the Common Law of this Kingdom<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot"><Q>What use our ancestors have made of the civil Law will readily appear to any one, that will take the trouble to compare the several works, which com∣pose that voluminous body, with some of the most ancient English Lawyers, as Glanvil, Bracton, and others; who have adhered very closely to the rules and method of Justinian; have transcribed his Laws in their own proper language, and some∣times entire titles, as familiarly as if they were the original Laws of England. <BIBL>Dr. Bever's Discourse on the Study of Juris-prudence and the Civil Law, p. 17.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; yet it includes some heterogeneous positions (that have been forced upon it by the overbearing influence and corrupt practices of unli∣mited Imperial Courts) which are highly unreasonable and contradictory to the ge∣neral equity of its other principles. A position of this kind, too implicitly re∣ceived as Law, seems to be the ground-work of the learned Baron's difficulty: I mean that <HI>unreasonable</HI> and dangerous position of the Civil Law, which attri∣butes to the Prince's <HI>Will and Pleasure</HI> the <HI>Force</HI> of Law<NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Quod Principi placuit (juxta Leges Civiles) Legis habet vigorem. <BIBL>Fortescue de Laud. Leg. Ang. c. 35. p. 83.</BIBL></Q>
<P>In this same chapter the learned Chancellor Fortes∣cue recites many dreadful effects of this abominable
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>principle in the Government and Police of <HI>France.</HI> viz. the pernicious and dangerous Policy of maintain∣ing a <HI>standing army;</HI> for which the people were com∣pelled to provide quarters and provisions, in all the great towns and villages.</P>
<P>Also the abominable oppression of the Salt Tax, whereby the poor were compelled to purchase of the King a certain quantity of <HI>Salt</HI> (whether they chose to have it or not) at an excessive price; by which, to∣gether with the assessments <HI>to pay the troops,</HI> and va∣rious other tallage rateable at the <HI>King's pleasure,</HI> the common people were reduced to extreme penury, and want of every comfort in life. And, with respect to persons of highter rank, if any Nobleman or Gentle∣man was accused of a crime, even by his enemies, he was liable to be dragged to a <HI>private examination,</HI> by the intermediation of messengers in the King's cham∣ber, or elsewhere, in a private place, without seeing his accusers (himself alone being seen); and when the King (or perhaps his Minister) has <HI>been pleased</HI> to judge him guilty, the poor <HI>passive Subject</HI> is popped into a sack, and in the night time cast into the river by the Marshal's servants. Howsoever incredible such abominable injustice may appear to Englishmen, yet the worthy Chancellor, who wrote this account for the instruction of Edward Prince of Wales (the son of King Henry VI.) when in France, appeals to the young Prince's <HI>own knowledge</HI> of the notoriety of such facts: "You have heard," (says he) <Q>that more men (by much) have died in this manner than by the ordinary course of justice; yet nevertheless</Q> (says he ironically) <Q><HI>whatsoever hath pleased the King (according to the Civil Law) has the force of Law.</HI> And while you have been in France, and in the neighbourhood of that Kingdom,</Q> (continues the
<PB N="ix" REF="11"/>Chancellor to the young Prince,) <Q>you have heard of other <HI>enormities</HI> like to these, and some even worse than these —<HI>detestably</HI> and <HI>damnably perpetrated,</HI> no otherwise than under the colour (or pretence) of <HI>that Law, viz.</HI> Quod Principi placuit (juxta Leges Civiles) legis habet vigorem.</Q> <Q>Etiam et alia <HI>enor∣mia,</HI></Q> (says he) <Q>hiis similia, acquaedam <HI>hiis deteriora,</HI> dum in Francia et prope regnum illud conversatus es, audisti non alio, quam <HI>legis illius colore</HI> DETESTABILI∣TUR DAMNABILITER QUE PERPETRATA, quae hic inserere, nostrum nimium dialogum protelaret, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Whether or not <HI>this particular mode</HI> of dispatching the French King's Subjects is yet in use, I know not; but of this we are well assured, that <HI>private executions of persons un∣known</HI> are still practised there, which in effect are <HI>equal∣ly dangerous,</HI> and cannot be considered in any other light than that of so many <HI>wilful Murders,</HI> for which the Kings of France, and all those men whom they have intrusted with the administration of Justice, are most certainly accountable, and must one day answer in their own private persons <HI>as individuals,</HI> besides the enormous guilt which lies heavy upon that whole people as a <HI>nation,</HI> for <HI>passively</HI> permitting such noto∣rious and crying <HI>iniquity</HI> to be practised among them under the borrowed <HI>name</HI> of <HI>Law:</HI> And it is not only <HI>the dispatching of men</HI> (to put them out of the way of opposition to Government) that is intended by these <HI>midnight executions,</HI> but also, in some cases, to satisfy a base malicious revenge by torturing the helpless vic∣tim with the cruel death of <HI>breaking on the wheel;</HI> for, as both the <HI>name</HI> and <HI>crime</HI> of the <HI>sufferer is con∣cealed,</HI> (or perhaps a wrong name given out to pre∣vent pity,) it cannot be said that such cruelty is used by way <HI>of example</HI> to deter bad men from commit∣ing treason, or other particular crimes; so that
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>such <HI>private executions</HI> can be attributed to nothing but a DIABOLICAL DEPRAVITY in the minds of those who order them.</P>
<P>It also appears that one use of a <HI>standing Army,</HI> in that unhappy Kingdom, is to guard the avenues of streets to prevent the people from discovering the <HI>actors</HI> as well as <HI>sufferers</HI> at such horrid <HI>masked tragedies</HI> as I have mentioned; and therefore I cannot help remarking the extreme absurdity of that (otherwise) sensible and shrewd people in boasting of their <HI>national military Ho∣nour,</HI> when even large bodies of their best-disciplined troops, who are <HI>Frenchmen</HI> also by birth, and have the means in their own hands to render justice and restore liberty to their <HI>much-injured countrymen,</HI> can yet tamely yield themselves so far to the <HI>absolute Will</HI> of any man or men on earth, as to become <HI>silent accomplices</HI> (like the detestable Turkish <HI>Mutes</HI> of old) to the horrid crime of <HI>wilful Murder,</HI> (for such are the <HI>secret execu∣tions</HI> of France,) and professed <HI>Tools</HI> for perpetrating the most abandoned wickedness! To such a disgrace∣ful and <HI>slavish</HI> pitch of <HI>passive obedience</HI> is that once-spirited nation now reduced, that they seem to give up all pretensions to that <HI>fundamental Right of human Na∣ture,</HI> which alone distinguishes <HI>men</HI> from <HI>brutes!</HI> I mean the indispensible <HI>Right of judging for themselves,</HI> and of yielding obedience to the impulse of <HI>Conscience,</HI> accord∣ing to that natural knowledge of <HI>good and evil</HI> which is implanted in <HI>all men, (French soldiers</HI> as well as others;) and of which they must one day render a strict account in a separate <HI>disbanded</HI> state, as <HI>individuals,</HI> (which I have before remarked,) <HI>stript of their arms and regimentals!</HI></P>
<P>Shall we, then, adopt the <HI>Laws of France?</HI> <Q><HI>quod principi placuit?</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is not impossible that such a measure may sometime or other be proposed by an inconsiderate Minister, and that a Parliament (through
<PB N="xi" REF="13"/>the <HI>unequal Representation of the</HI> People, the <HI>want of frequent elections,</HI> and other defects in the constitution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) may hereafter be led to yield their consent to it; but, even if ever that should be the case, I shall still entertain hopes, from the general disposition of our <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Troops, (notwithstanding the alarming effects of <HI>standing Armies</HI> in all other Nations,) that they will ne∣ver become so detestably base and degenerate as to per∣mit their country to groan under any such iniquitous Oppressions as are practised in <HI>France!</HI> Nevertheless, should <HI>they also</HI> become such <HI>slavish Tools of Despotism,</HI> as to assist in enforcing any such unconstitutional mea∣sures, let them know, for a certainty, that, as soon as the <HI>national spirit of Freedom</HI> (of which they at present participate) is, by their means, unhappily suppressed, even they themselves must necessarily degenerate with their countrymen, and will be no more able to stand before their enemies, than the other wretched troops whom they have so often driven before them!</P>
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/></NOTE>. I do not find, in∣deed,
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>that he has literally cited the cor∣rupt maxims, but he has manifestly laid
<PB N="ix" REF="11"/>down the same principle (though in dif∣ferent words) towards the beginning of
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>the same chapter, where he is defining the difference between <HI>Law</HI> and some
<PB N="xi" REF="13"/>other things, which seem to bear relation to it; as <HI>Counsel,</HI> which requires <HI>reasons</HI> to produce an <HI>obligation,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>"But <HI>Law,</HI>" (says he,) <Q>though it ought not to want its <HI>reasons,</HI> yet these <HI>reasons</HI> are not the cause why obe∣dience is paid to it, <HI>but the power of the Exactor;</HI> who, when he has sig∣nified his <HI>pleasure,</HI> lays an <HI>obligation</HI> on the <HI>Subjects</HI> to act in conformity to his decree, though perhaps they do not so well apprehend the <HI>reasons</HI> of the injunction,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and, after citing a similar passage from Mr. Hobbs, he adds,
<PB N="xii" REF="14"/><Q>For no man can say, <HI>sic volo, sic ju∣beo;</HI> so I will, and so I command; unless,</Q></P>
<Q>— Stet pro <HI>Ratione voluntas.</HI></Q>
<Q>His <HI>Will</HI> is his <HI>Reason.</HI></Q>
<P>"We obey Laws, therefore," (says he,) <Q>not principally upon account of the matter of them, but upon account of <HI>the Legislator's Will</HI> <NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot">Book 1. chap. 6. §. 1.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the learned Civilian seems to consider <HI>the Will and Pleasure</HI> of a Sove∣reign as the life and spirit of Laws; which <HI>notion</HI> is highly <HI>unreasonable</HI> in every case but one, <HI>viz.</HI> when we are speaking of the Laws of that Sovereign alone, whose <HI>Will</HI> is the fountain of <HI>Reason,</HI> and whose <HI>Pleasure</HI> (by our own natural <HI>Reason</HI> we are convinced) is infinite <HI>goodness, justice,</HI> and <HI>mercy,</HI> to∣wards all those to whom he has signified his commands; because we cannot separate the <HI>idea</HI> of infallible <HI>Reason, Wisdom,</HI> and eternal <HI>Justice,</HI> from any command of divine authority.</P>
<P>And yet this application of the Baron's doctrine, even to the <HI>supreme</HI> Law, is not conformable throughout to what I
<PB N="xiii" REF="15"/>understand in this place of the Baron's idea of <HI>Law;</HI> for he assigns no other <Q>cause why obedience is paid to it, but the <HI>power</HI> of <HI>the Exactor;</HI></Q> whereas God's Laws have many other apparent <HI>causes</HI> of <HI>obligation,</HI> of which I have alteady mentioned the due sense we <HI>na∣turally</HI> entertain of the infinite <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> (as well as <HI>the Power</HI>) of the Divine Author, who is so far from being <HI>an Exactor</HI> of <HI>Laws,</HI> that the revelation of his will for the good government of mankind has generally been addressed to the <HI>Senses</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> of Men, that their <HI>Covenant</HI> with God might be founded on <HI>free Consent,</HI> the highest and most obli∣gatory <HI>Cause of Obedience.</HI></P>
<P>Now, as the Laws of God are thus tendered to us under the equitable form of a <HI>reciprocal Covenant,</HI> thereby bind∣ing even himself (the supreme Lord and Creator of all things) to us, his poor mortal subjects, under <HI>conditional Promises</HI> which cannot fail on his part! how much more ought all mere <HI>worldly</HI> Governors to be restrained and limi∣ted by equitable <HI>Covenants</HI> of <HI>mutual obligation</HI> between them and their Sub∣jects, since their <HI>equality</HI> in nature gives
<PB N="xiv" REF="16"/>the latter an undoubted Right to insist on this, the only safe mode of worldly Government?</P>
<P>The consideration of this point leads me to one of the principal Grounds of Baron Puffendorf's Mistake, beforemen∣tioned.</P>
<P>He does not seem to have been aware, that, in all societies of men governed by <HI>Laws,</HI> some sort of <HI>general Covenant</HI> must be understood to subsist between the several <HI>Sovereigns</HI> and their <HI>Subjects</HI> re∣spectively: and, though such <HI>Covenants</HI> are not always <HI>expressed,</HI> yet, most cer∣tainly, they are always <HI>implied;</HI> because we must necessarily presume, that <HI>the Good of the People</HI> is the original intention and principal end of all <HI>legal</HI> human Go∣vernments, since <HI>all Men are naturally equals,</HI> and <HI>a Man</HI> who submits himself to the Sovereignty or Government of another, that he may enjoy the benefit and protection of society, does not, on that account, cease to be <HI>a Man;</HI> nei∣ther can the temporal Sovereign himself be released from the <HI>natural</HI> Tyes of <HI>that Relation:</HI> for, whenever he forgets that he himself is <HI>a Man,</HI> (of the same falli∣ble understanding and natural infirmities
<PB N="xv" REF="17"/>with his Subjects, who are his <HI>equals</HI> both on their <HI>entrance</HI> and at their <HI>exeunt</HI> from the Stage of Life,) he immediately loses the best Rule for his Conduct as <HI>a Prince,</HI> and necessarily degenerates into <HI>brutality;</HI> so that, in such cases, to sup∣pose that THE WILL <HI>of the Prince</HI> is to be allowed <HI>the force of Law</HI> is the high∣est absurdity! Nay, even the Baron himself has elsewhere declared, that <Q>the word MAN, is thought to carry somewhat of <HI>Dignity</HI> in its sound; and we commonly</Q> (says he) <Q>make use of this as the last and the most prevail∣ing argument against a rude insulter, <HI>I am not a Beast, a Dog, but I am</HI> A MAN <HI>as well as yourself.</HI> Since then <HI>human</HI> nature agrees <HI>equally</HI> to all per∣sons, and since no one can live a socia∣ble life with another, who does not own and respect him as <HI>a Man;</HI> it fol∣lows, as a command of the Law of Nature, <HI>that</HI> EVERY MAN <HI>esteem and treat</HI> ANOTHER as one who is natural∣ly HIS EQUAL, or who is A MAN as well as he.</Q> (Book 3. c. 2. p. 178.) It would therefore be unreasonable to conceive, that any society of MEN should voluntarily submit themselves to a tempo∣ral
<PB N="xvi" REF="18"/>Sovereign, without supposing, at the same time, some <HI>reciprocal obligation</HI> or <HI>duty</HI> to subsist between them; which is no∣thing else but the <HI>implication</HI> of a mutual <HI>Covenant:</HI> and, indeed, the formalities of every Coronation sufficiently indicate and warrant such an <HI>implication;</HI> and the in∣fringements made by Monarchs on such <HI>implied Covenants</HI> have, in all ages, been occasionally punished by the expulsion and destruction of the Tyrants them∣selves, of which most nations have, at some time or other, afforded an example.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the learned Baron seems to have neglected these necessary conside∣rations; for he asserts, that the dis∣tinction between a <HI>Compact</HI> or <HI>Covenant,</HI> and a <HI>Law,</HI> is obvious. <Q>For a <HI>Com∣pact</HI></Q> (says he) <Q>is a <HI>Promise,</HI> but a <HI>Law</HI> is a <HI>Command.</HI> In Compacts the form of speaking is <HI>I will</HI> do so and so; but in Law the form runs, <HI>do thou so,</HI> after an imperative manner.</Q> Book 1. c. 6. §. 2. p. 47.</P>
<P>He had before been speaking of demo∣cratical Governments, and had remarked, not only that the ancients <Q>frequently apply to Laws the name of <HI>common Agreements,</HI></Q> but also, that "the Laws"
<PB N="xvii" REF="19"/>(among the Grecians) <Q>were made upon the proposal of the Magistrate, with the Knowledge, and <HI>by the Command of the People,</HI> and so</Q> (as it were) "in the way of <HI>bargain or stipulation,</HI>" (says he,) <Q>they gave them the name of <HI>Covenants</HI> and <HI>Agreements</HI> beforemen∣tioned:</Q> and yet he will not allow (notwithstanding such authority) that they are properly stiled <HI>"Covenants,"</HI> having puzzled himself with the diffe∣rence between a national <HI>Covenant</HI> and a <HI>Covenant</HI> of individuals; <Q>for, in this last case,</Q> (says he,) <Q>a person that <HI>dissents is not bound,</HI> and the party cannot pro∣ceed without him; whereas, in the for∣mer <HI>case,</HI> even the <HI>dissenting Party</HI> is tied and obliged by the plurality of votes.</Q> Now the learned Baron has not been aware that this very reason, which he himself has assigned, confirms the propriety of that ancient custom which he condemns, (<HI>viz.</HI> the applying the name of <HI>Covenants</HI> and <HI>Agreements</HI> to <HI>Laws,</HI>) for, he allows, that <Q>the <HI>dissent∣ing Party</HI> is tied and obliged by <HI>the plu∣rality of votes,</HI></Q> and therefore, even a whole nation, in that case, may be said to act as <HI>an individual;</HI> because, <Q><HI>that to
<PB N="xviii" REF="20"/>which the greater number give consent</HI></Q> (as he himself remarks in the preceding paragraph) <Q><HI>is taken</HI> for the <HI>Will and De∣cree of all;</HI></Q> so that, by this means, a <HI>whole Nation</HI> is as capable of making a <HI>Covenant</HI> or <HI>Compact</HI> as an <HI>Individual;</HI> and I will only add, to what the Baron has allowed about the <HI>binding</HI> of <HI>those who dissent,</HI> that they are bound <HI>only so far</HI> as the imposed <HI>Obligation</HI> is consistent with their <HI>superior Covenant</HI> and duty to God, which is always to be <HI>implied:</HI> for even the SOVEREIGN of <HI>the World,</HI> THE KING OF KINGS, who alone can be said to have an <HI>absolute Right</HI> to govern his creature man <HI>without a free Covenant;</HI> (if he had been pleased so to do,) has nevertheless condescended to include all his positive <HI>Laws</HI> in two express <HI>legal Covenants,</HI> the <HI>old</HI> and the <HI>new,</HI> both of which have been from time to time confirmed and fulfilled, and still respectively subsist to this day in all points, wherein the former is not superseded, and fulfilled by the latter. It therefore ill becomes this learned Civilian to separate the idea of a <HI>Compact</HI> or <HI>Covenant from Law;</HI> and more especially when he endeavours thereby to establish <Q><HI>the Power of the
<PB N="xix" REF="21"/>Exactor,</HI></Q> the capricious <HI>Will</HI> of mere temporal fallible Sovereigns, which he supposes to be <HI>Law,</HI> independent of all <HI>Compacts</HI> or <HI>Covenants</HI> expressed or im∣plied!</P>
<P>Thus I hope I have traced, to the very foundation, the Baron's error in denying the principle or maxim beforementioned, (concerning the necessity of popular <HI>as∣sent</HI> in Legislation,) for, if he had not attempted to separate the idea of a <HI>Coven∣nant</HI> from <HI>Law,</HI> he could not have over∣looked the absolute <HI>illegality</HI> of those pretended Laws which are ordained only by the <HI>Will</HI> and <HI><Q>Power of the Exac∣tor!</Q></HI> because the meanest professor of the English common Law would have told him, that every submission, <HI>promise,</HI> or <HI>agreement,</HI> that is <HI>extorted</HI> by <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>compulsion,</HI> is (according to the <HI>Law of Nature</HI>) totally <HI>null and void in itself;</HI> and he himself is sufficiently sensible of this in another place<NOTE N="(10)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Those <HI>promises</HI> then, or <HI>pacts,</HI> we take to be <HI>invalid,</HI> which a man is <HI>compelled</HI> to engage in, by the <HI>unjust force</HI> of the party to whom they are made; for since he, who <HI>extorts</HI> any thing from another by using unjust terrours, is <HI>by the Law of Nature</HI> bound to restore it, and must consequently make good what the other person loses by such forced bargain, the necessity of <HI>Reparation,</HI> in the party who offered the violence, <HI>takes off</HI> ALL OBLIGATION <HI>to payment in the party who suffered it,</HI> &amp;c. <BIBL>Book 3. c. 6. § 11. p. 225.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. And, even if
<PB N="xx" REF="22"/>an oath should be obtained to confirm the unjust <HI>"Power of the Exactor,"</HI> it will not increase his Right; for the Ba∣ron's own doctrine (again in another part of his book) affords a sufficient an∣swer to annul every pretence of <HI>Obliga∣tion</HI> on account of <Q><HI>oaths extorted by un∣just Fear</HI> <NOTE N="(11)" PLACE="foot"><Q>But what are we to think of <HI>oaths</HI> extorted by <HI>unjust Fear?</HI> Surely the Person who, by means of this <HI>Fear,</HI> procured a promise <HI>upon oath,</HI> is no less obliged to <HI>release the promise,</HI> thus violently obtained, than <HI>if no oath had been</HI> added to confirm it. There∣fore there appears no reason, why <HI>Compensation</HI> should not be admitted in this case, in opposition to <HI>the Claim</HI> of the <HI>injurious Party;</HI> according to the rules laid down by us</Q> (says he) <Q>when we treated of the general subject of <HI>Fear.</HI> <BIBL>Book 4. c. 2. § 8. p. 272.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the maxim concerning <HI>the neces∣sity of Assent,</HI> for which I contend, is sufficiently proved to be a <HI>Law of Na∣ture</HI> even by the learned Baron's own arguments, and I desire no better.</P>
<P>In consequence of the Baron's gene∣ral misconception<NOTE N="(12)" PLACE="foot"><P>I have spent the more time in warning my Rea∣ders against the Errors of this celebrated Civilian, be∣cause the studying of his Works (I am informed) is at this time considered as a material part of Education in our Universities; so that <HI>the rising Generation</HI> of the very best Families in this Kingdom are liable to im∣bibe (as it were with the Milk of Instruction) these poisonous Doctrines, which thereby become fixed and engrafted in their tender minds as a <HI>foundation</HI> for their <HI>future political Principles!</HI></P>
<P>Thus a most dangerous source of unconstitution∣al notions has been opened, and seems already to have flowed throughout the Kingdom; so that we need not wonder at the <HI>modern partiality</HI> for in∣creasing the number as well as the powers of <HI>Courts of Admiralty,</HI> and other seminaries of the <HI>Civil Law,</HI> though the very existence of <HI>British Liberty</HI> depends on duly restraining and limiting the <HI>Civil Law Courts</HI> within those bounds of jurisdiction which have been allowed them by the ancient Constitution of this Kingdom: And therefore I hope my Readers will ex∣cuse my having exceeded the usual form of publications, in making <HI>so long</HI> a Preface to <HI>so short</HI> a Work, since it was absolutely necessary to guard against these dange∣rous and inveterate errors of the <HI>Civil Law,</HI> before I could safely proceed to my Declaration in favour of <HI>po∣pular Assent.</HI></P></NOTE>, concerning the ne∣cessity

<P>Now his observation is certainly <HI>true</HI> as far as it relates to the <HI>rise</HI> or <HI>origin</HI> of such Laws; for the Laws, being <HI>divine,</HI> must necessarily have <HI>"had their rise"</HI> from God; but yet this does not set aside
<PB N="xxii" REF="24"/><HI>"the agreement of men,"</HI> by which they have been ratified and confirmed in all ages.

<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="25"/>This knowledge of <HI>Good and Evil</HI> was discovered, even by the Gentiles, <HI>to be a divine attribute</HI> <NOTE N="(14)" PLACE="foot"><P>Cicero calls this natural knowledge of Good and Evil, <HI>Law.</HI> "Lex" (says he in his first Book De Legibus) <Q>est <HI>ratio summa,</HI> insita <HI>in natura,</HI> quae <HI>ju∣het</HI> ea quae facienda sunt, <HI>prohibetque</HI> contraria; <HI>eadem catio</HI> cum est in hominis mente confirmata et confec∣ta <HI>Lex</HI> est.</Q> And in his third Book De Officiis, where he is speaking again of natural Reason, he calls it <HI>a Divine Law.</HI>— <Q>I psa naturae ratio, quae est <HI>Lex di∣vina.</HI> et Humana:</Q>—And elsewhere he more parti∣cularly declares it to be a <HI>Divine Attribute.</HI>— <Q>Recta, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>numine Deorum</HI> tracta <HI>ratio.</HI></Q> And he mentions this <HI>attribute</HI> again in his second Book <Q><HI>De Natura Deo∣rum,</HI></Q> where he speaks of <HI>prudence,</HI> or <Q>the <HI>choice of Good</HI> and <HI>rejection of Evil,</HI></Q> as a universal Law, <HI>common to God and man.</HI> <Q>Sequitur ut <HI>eadem</HI> sit in <HI>his</HI> (Diis) quae in <HI>genere humano, ratio, eadem veritas</HI> utrobique sit, <HI>eademque Lex;</HI> quae est <HI>recti praeceptio pravique depulsio.</HI> Ex quo intelligitur, <HI>prudentiam</HI> quoque, et <HI>mentem a Diis</HI> ad homines, pervenisse,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></NOTE>, though they were unacquainted, probably, with the occasion of its being engrafted in human nature.

<PB N="xxiv" REF="26"/>must be sensible that we stand self-con∣demned by <HI>Conscience</HI> (which is only an∣other name for <Q><HI>the knowledge of Good and Evil</HI></Q>) whenever we offend a∣gainst <HI>the moral Laws</HI> of God, by which our <HI>Agreement</HI> and <HI>Assent</HI> to the justice of them are sufficiently <HI>implied</HI> and ac∣knowledged<NOTE N="(15)" PLACE="foot"><P>I have traced this subject more at large in a separate Tract on "the <HI>Law of Nature and Principles of Action in</HI> MAN," intended also for the Press.</P></NOTE>: And, with respect to what the Baron has likewise insinuated concerning the want of <HI>human agreement</HI> to the <HI>"divine positive Laws,"</HI> the di∣rect contrary thereto is clearly demon∣strated (as I have before hinted) by the remarkable examples of two incontesti∣ble legal <HI>Covenants</HI> between <HI>God and Man,</HI> the Old and New Testaments, those two original written <HI>Charters or Grants</HI> of PERFECT LIBERTY; the one containing the <HI>Promises,</HI> and the other, the <HI>Accomplish∣ment</HI> of our <HI>glorious Freedom;</HI> which we are bound to maintain and defend to the last moment of our lives!</P>
<P>The mention that has already been made of these two unquestionable monu∣ments of the <HI>free State and Condition,</HI> to which the Almighty has been pleased to
<PB N="xxv" REF="27"/>invite his creature Man, might perhaps be sufficient for my present purpose, without descending to farther particulars; but yet, as I received extraordinary satis∣faction myself in tracing minutely the manner in which the said Covenants have been tendered and ratified, I am in∣clined to suppose that many of my Rea∣ders will reap the same satisfaction by perusing some examples of it, because they demonstrate the <HI>real dignity</HI> and <HI>natural Rights</HI> of MAN, far beyond any thing that I could possibly have conceived before I made the said Examination with this particular view to the <HI>Freedom</HI> of Man; and as I have too much reason to apprehend, that many of my country∣men have overlooked or neglected these <HI>striking Instances,</HI> which relate to the pre∣sent subject, the <HI>Right of Assent;</HI> I propose to add (sometime hereafter, as soon as I can possibly find leisure to revise it for the press) a <HI>third Part</HI> also to this <Q>Declaration of the People's natural Right to a Share in the Legislature;</Q> which 3d <HI>Part</HI> (be∣ing founded on some remarkable examples in Scripture, concerning the gracious and most liberal mode whereby the <HI>revealed Laws, even of God himself,</HI> have been
<PB N="xxvi" REF="28"/>tendered (from time to time) to the con∣sideration and acceptance of mankind) proves by comparative demonstration, that the MAXIMS OF THE FOREIGN CIVI∣LIANS, whereby they set up the mere WILL of fallible earthly Princes as LAW, (viz. <HI>Quod Principi placuit habet vigorem Legis.—Stet pro ratione voluntas. &amp;c.</HI> substituting WILL for REASON,) are IMPIOUS AND UNJUST; since even the ALMIGHTY SOVEREIGN OF THE UNIVERSE, to whose WILL a∣lone such deference is <HI>justly due,</HI> hath not so dealt with his creature Man, enforcing his <HI>Will</HI> for his <HI>Reason;</HI> but, on the con∣trary, hath mercifully condescended to convince us (his frail mortal subjects) that REASON is his WILL, and that he hath <HI>limited</HI> (if I may be allowed such an expression) even his own <HI>infinite Power</HI> by the eternal rules of Justice and Righteousness, which, (our own <HI>natural Reason</HI> teaches us,) can never fail! and therefore, as true <HI>Freedom</HI> consists in the <HI>certainty</HI> of known Laws, so the most <HI>perfect Liberty</HI> must necessarily subsist under the Government of the <HI>Almighty;</HI> who has appealed by his prophets from time to time, in the most affecting man∣ner,

<P>In my former Tract I remarked, that <Q>the Law will not excuse an <HI>unlawful Act committed by a</HI> SOLDIER, even though he commits it by <HI>the express Command</HI> of the highest <HI>military Autho∣rity</HI> in the Kingdom,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that <HI>"Men of true Honour,"</HI> who have also <Q><HI>a true Sense of Religion,</HI> will not only be mindful that they are <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Subjects</HI> to an earthly KING, but that they are also <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Subjects</HI> to the KING of KINGS, whose Laws and Precepts they will, on all occasions, prefer to <HI>every other command,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But this has been denied, it seems, by a Critic, in the Monthly Review for Janu∣ary, 1774, who calls it <Q><HI>a strange Prin∣ciple!</HI></Q> In an Age of infidelity, indeed,
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="38"/>it may perhaps be allowed (in one Sense) to be a <HI>strange Principle;</HI> but then we have the greatest Reason to lament the ignorance and depravity of those Men who esteem it so in any other sense than than of being <HI>too often</HI> neglected and trans∣gressed! for I trust that no Man, who admits or believes the divine authority of the holy Scriptures, will doubt <HI>the Truth of it.</HI></P>
<P>If this <HI>strange</HI> PRINCIPLE had not been <HI>equally true,</HI> the English Nation (as I re∣marked in my former Tract) would long ago have been <HI>enslaved:</HI> and I will now add, that even the very <HI>standing Army</HI> itself would, by this time, have been reduced to that <HI>abject State</HI> of <HI>political Slavery,</HI> which at present disgraces the <HI>standing Army</HI> of <HI>France</HI> <NOTE N="(21)" PLACE="foot"><P>I am a professed enemy, indeed, to <HI>standing Armies;</HI> but God forbid that I should be so to the <HI>in∣dividuals</HI> incorporated therein, whose <HI>true honour, na∣tural dignity,</HI> and <HI>just privileges,</HI> AS MEN, I shall over be ready to assert and vindicate; and indeed I am bound to do so by that indispensible duty which I owe to the great Author of <HI>human Nature,</HI> in opposi∣tion to the spiritual prince of this world, who is ever plotting to <HI>corrupt, vilify,</HI> and <HI>enslave,</HI> that noblest work of God, <HI>Mankind!</HI> And as this same <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Reward,</HI> which I here profess for the INDIVIDUALS, <HI>of the Army,</HI> are certainly due also to the INDIVIDUALS <HI>of every other Body of Men,</HI> whose <HI>general Principles</HI> are cen∣sured in this Declaration, I must beg leave to assure my Readers, that I do not mean to oppose the <HI>Men,</HI> but merely their <HI>unreasonable Principles,</HI> without any <HI>personal</HI> application whatsoever; for, otherwise, the se∣verity of my expressions (especially against the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> and the <HI>French Government</HI>) would be entire∣ly inconsistent with that <HI>"Good-Will to Men,"</HI> which I am indispensibly obliged,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Upon this point I have wrote a distinct Tract, which is intended also for publication, and entitled "a Tract on the <HI>Law of Liberty.</HI>"</P></NOTE>, for my own eternal Happiness, to maintain!</P></NOTE>, and there∣fore

<P><Q>And as all natural Faculties may be improved by the rudiments of Art and Science, so even the NATURAL FEELINGS OF CONSCIENCE may be rendered more <HI>sensible, tender,</HI> and <HI>distinguishing,</HI> by a proper Knowledge of <HI>the Elements</HI> or leading Precepts of the LAW ETERNAL.</Q></P>

<HEAD>A DECLARATION OF THE People's Natural Right to a Share in the Legislature, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AN accurate and critical knowledge of Law (such as can only be acquired by much reading and long experience in the profession) is indeed a necessary qua∣lification for those persons who under∣take to deliver their opinions concerning the nicer and more difficult questions of jurisprudence; but, when the <HI>Natural Rights</HI> of any of our fellow-subjects are apparently at stake, every man has a right to judge for himself, and to de∣clare his sentiments, as far as <HI>plain con∣clusions of reason</HI> and <HI>common-sense</HI> will
<PB N="2" REF="44"/>fairly warrant; and such only are re∣ferred to in the following Declaration of the <HI>Natural Right</HI> of popular Repre∣sentation in the legislature.</P>
<P><Q>Amongst all the rights and privileges appertaining unto us,</Q> (said that truly noble lawyer, Lord Sommers,)<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Judgement of whole Kingdoms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 14.</NOTE>. <Q>that of having a Share in the Legislation, and being to be governed by such laws as we ourselves shall chuse, is the most fundamental and <HI>essential,</HI></Q> as well as the most <HI>advantageous</HI> and beneficial, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And as all British subjects, whether in Great-Britain, Ireland, or the Colo∣nies, are <HI>equally free</HI> by the law of <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> they certainly are <HI>equally</HI> entitled to the same <HI>Natural</HI> Rights that are <HI>essential</HI> for their own preservation; because this privilege of <Q><HI>having a share in the legis∣lation</HI></Q> is not merely a <HI>British Right,</HI> pe∣culiar
<PB N="3" REF="45"/>to <HI>this island,</HI> but it is also a <HI>Na∣tural Right,</HI> which cannot, without the most flagrant and stimulating injustice, be withdrawn from any part of the British Empire <HI>by any worldly authority whatso∣ever;</HI> because, <Q>by the <HI>natural Law,</HI> whereunto he [ALMIGHTY GOD] hath made all subject,</Q> (says the learned Hooker,)<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, lib. 1, §. 10, p. 87.</NOTE> <Q>the lawful power of making laws, to command whole <HI>po∣litic societies of men,</HI> belongeth so pro∣perly <HI>unto the same entire societies,</HI> that for any Prince or Potentate, of <HI>what kind soever</HI> upon earth, to exercise the same of himself,</Q> [or themselves,] <Q>and not either by express Commission im∣mediately and personally received from God, or else by authority derived at the first from <HI>their consent upon whose per∣sons they impose laws,</HI> it is no better than mere tyranny! Laws they are
<PB N="4" REF="46"/>not, <HI>therefore,</HI> which public <HI>Appro∣bation</HI> hath not made so.</Q> Agreeable to the same just principles of <HI>natural E∣quity</HI> is that maxim of the English Con∣stitution, that <Q><HI>Law, to bind all, must be assented to by all;</HI> <BIBL>(Principia Leg∣et Aequit. p. 56.)</BIBL></Q> and there can be no legal appearance of <HI>Assent</HI> without some de∣gree of <HI>Representation.</HI></P>
<P>It must indeed be acknowledged, that the Representation of the people of Eng∣land is not so perfect as equity may seem to require, since very many individuals have no VOTE in Elections, and con∣sequently cannot be said expressly to give <HI>their Assent</HI> to the laws by which they are governed: nevertheless, the whole country which they inhabit, and in which they earn their bread, and even the very houses in which they live, (whe∣ther they are housekeepers or lodgers,)
<PB N="5" REF="47"/>are represented<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><P>I must beg leave to refer the reader also to some excellent observations on this head, in a Pamphlet published since the above was written, entitled, <HI>An Argument in Defence of the Colonies,</HI> p. 76, 77, and 78.</P></NOTE> by the votes of the respective proprietors; since <HI>every Free∣holder</HI> has a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>vote;</HI> so that, in this one respect, the Representation is general; and, though <HI>far from</HI> EQUAL, would still be a sufficient check against arbitrary power, and afford sufficient se∣curity for the lives and property of those persons who <HI>have no Vote,</HI> if the laws against parliamentary corruption (and es∣pecially that Act of 7 and 8 Wil. III. c. 4.) were duly enforced; and also if all persons, who are entrusted with the disposal of public Money, were required to render a strict account of it, and to be severely punished whenever convicted of exerting the influence of the <HI>public trea∣sury</HI> against <HI>public liberty;</HI> which is the most baneful treachery and dishonesty that men in office (who are the servants
<PB N="6" REF="48"/>of <HI>the Public,</HI> as well as of <HI>the King</HI>) can possibly commit. But, notwith∣standing the <HI>Inequality</HI> of the English <HI>Representation,</HI> and the various means practised to corrupt it, yet it has been the principal instrument of preserving amongst us those remains of <HI>natural Li∣berty</HI> which we still enjoy in a greater proportion than most other kingdoms, and has occasioned more examples of just retribution on <HI>Tyrants, Traitors,</HI> and <HI>Court-Favourites,</HI> in the English annals, than the history of any other nation af∣fords; so that M. Rapin is thereby led to conclude his account of K. Richard II. (that notorious corrupter of parliaments, and enemy to the privileges of London and other corporations) with the fol∣lowing reflection: <Q>That, in a govern∣ment such as that of England, all the efforts that the Sovereign makes, to usurp an absolute authority, are so many steps which lead him towards
<PB N="7" REF="49"/>the precipice.</Q> <NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot"><Q>C'est que dans un Gouvernement tel que celui d'Angletorre, tous les efforts que le Souverain fait pour usurper un pouvoir absolu sont autant de pas qui le conduisent vers le précipice. <BIBL>Tome 3.

<PB N="8" REF="50"/>just argument for setting aside the <HI>Repre∣sentation</HI> of the people in other parts of the British Empire; because experience teaches us, that even a <HI>defective Repre∣sentation</HI> is better than none at all; and therefore it is highly <HI>unreasonable,</HI> and contrary to <HI>natural Equity,</HI> to pretend that our brethren and fellow-subjects in the more distant parts of the British Em∣pire
<PB N="9" REF="51"/>ought to be deprived <HI>entirely</HI> of their <HI>natural Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> merely be∣cause our own liberties <HI>are not entirely perfect!</HI> or because our own Representa∣tion in the Legislature appears, in some few respects, to be defective! and it would be quite as <HI>unreasonable</HI> to alledge, that the principle or reason of the maxim before quoted (<HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Law, to bind all, must be assented to by all</HI>) is unjust and inconclusive, merely because it would be very difficult to accomplish it <HI>literally</HI> by the express <HI>assent</HI> of every individual!

It must be acknowledged, in∣deed, that an Act of Parliament was made in the 6th of K. George I. chap. 5. wherein it is laid down, that <Q>the King and Parliament of Great-Britain <HI>may make Laws to bind Ireland.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="(22)" PLACE="foot"><P>If the preceding arguments are not sufficient to prove in what light the said Act is to be considered, yet the present <HI>distinct and separate Jurisdiction</HI> of <HI>the Irish Parliament,</HI> the Continuation of their <HI>ancient</HI> and <HI>constitutional Privileges,</HI> notwithstanding the doctrine asserted in the said Act, and their annual Transactions, both in <HI>Taxation</HI> and <HI>Legislation,</HI> are <HI>Facts,</HI> which prove <HI>(better than Arguments)</HI> that the people of Ire∣land
<PB N="22" REF="64"/>have an inherent Right to enact Laws indepen∣dent of the British Parliament; otherwise the King's <HI>Assent</HI> would not be sufficient to render the said laws <HI>valid and binding</HI> without the especial approbation and consent also of the British Parliament, which indeed is <HI>never required; so far is it from being necessary!</HI> And, farther, the inhabitants of Great-Britain would think it extremely unreasonable and unjust, if the Parlia∣ment of Ireland should claim a Right of making Laws, with the King's assent, to <HI>bind any part of this Island!</HI> The argument is reciprocal: so that, if we should really detest such a measure against ourselves, <HI>the Law of Laws</HI> forbids us to claim the like power over any of our fellow-subjects, without their free consent. <HI>"Non facias alteri quod tibi non vis fieri."</HI> This is laid down as one of the most common precepts of the <HI>Law of Reason</HI> (Doct. and Stud. c. 2, p. 7.); and such is the immutability of the <HI>Law of Reason,</HI> that against it there can be no <HI>prescription, statute,</HI> or <HI>cus∣tom;</HI> and if any are made contrary thereto, they are not to be esteemed <HI>statutes</HI> or <HI>customs,</HI> but <HI>corruptlae, i. e.</HI> Corruptions or Depravities — <Q>Non sunt sta∣tuta sive consuetudines, sed <HI>corruptelae.</HI> <BIBL>Doct. and Stud. c. 2, p. 5.</BIBL></Q> To the same effect is that Com∣mand of Christ himself, (recorded in Matt. vii. 12.) which our Lord declared to be <Q><HI>the Law and the Pro∣phets;</HI></Q> viz. <Q><HI>Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is</HI> THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS</Q>: so that it may justly be intitled, the <HI>Law of Laws;</HI> and a statute, therefore, which is contrary thereto, is <HI>doubly unlawful.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="65"/>The separate interests of the two Kingdoms are suffi∣ciently restrained, with respect to each other, by our excellent Constitution of State, which requires <HI>the As∣sent of the People,</HI> (that is of those which are concerned respectively,) to render any <HI>Law valid</HI> and <HI>binding</HI> upon either nation; which the foregoing arguments demonstrate: and I hope the ingenious and sensible author of the argument in defence of the Colonies (lately published) will acknowledge, that he has al∣lowed too much, when he admits, in page 114, that <Q><HI>the whole kingdom of Ireland is bound by the Acts of the supreme Legislature,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> which doctrine leads him afterwards to make a distinction between Taxation and Legislation.</P>
<P>And again, the two kingdoms are so firmly united, by the <HI>bands of Allegiance,</HI> to <HI>one Head</HI> (or Monarchy) of <HI>limited power,</HI> that their interests in all material <HI>ex∣ternal</HI> exigences are thereby <HI>rendered mutual,</HI> as well as their <HI>internal</HI> interest, in the maintenance of <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>constitutional Liberty,</HI> in each kingdom respectively; because one of them cannot be deprived of this, (as they are governed by <HI>the same Head,</HI>) without hast∣ening the destruction of the other. And this intimate connexion of <HI>mutual interest</HI> in the constitution of state, and in the reciprocal enjoyment of the <HI>same rea∣sonable common Law,</HI> (whereby each kingdom enjoys an Equality of privilege, and natural freedom,) ren∣ders the Union of the two kingdoms <HI>more just and equitable,</HI> and, consequently, <HI>more safe and durable,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="66"/>than it could possibly have been made by any other means: and the inhabitants of both islands (though sprung from a variety of jarring, jealous, and fierce nations) have, by these means acquired a certain <HI>mu∣tual consideration</HI> for each other, as <HI>fellow-subjects,</HI> which could never have been produced by mere alliances, guarantees, or defensive leagues, nor, perhaps, by any other mode of government whatever, than that by which divine Providence has effected it; <HI>viz.</HI> the English Constitution: this has firmly united the <HI>Strength</HI> of the two Islands; whereby reciprocal succour, in time of need, is insured to both.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="63"/></NOTE> But,
<PB N="22" REF="64"/>as it does not appear that the Parliament of Ireland ever acknowledged or gave
<PB N="23" REF="65"/>any <HI>formal Assent</HI> to the said Act, the same must necessarily be considered as a
<PB N="24" REF="66"/><HI>mere assertion</HI> on <HI>one part,</HI> at the making of which, the persons most materially concerned on <HI>the other part</HI> were neither HEARD, <HI>nor represented!</HI> a defect<NOTE N="(23)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Qui aliquid statuerit, parte <HI>inaudita altera,</HI> licet aequum dixerit, <HI>haud aequum</HI> fecerit:</Q> so that, if any act is ever so just in itself, yet it becomes <HI>other∣wise</HI> (that is, <HI>unjust and iniquitous,</HI> as is before re∣marked) by the want of these legal formalities.</P></NOTE> the most notorious that can possibly be attri∣buted to any proceeding, either in the <HI>enacting</HI> or <HI>execution of Laws!</HI> and there∣fore it is to very little purpose to cite the said Act as a Precedent for taxing the American Subjects <HI>without their Consent;</HI>

<PB N="26" REF="68"/>Crown of Great-Britain, and detached (as Ireland is) from this island, ought to be and have been esteemed, from the first establishment of our colonies, the only proper and constitutional Legisla∣ture for <HI>each province respectively;</HI> <NOTE N="(24)" PLACE="foot"><P>Every establishment in the American Colonies has been settled by our ancestors as nearly as possible to the constitutional form of government in the Mo∣ther-Country; and, as the advantages of this mode have been proved by the experience of more than a century; (see an argument, just published, in defence of the exclusive Right, claimed by the Colonies, to tax themselves, p. 36, 39, 44.) it is very dangerous (now that the colonies begin to be filled with people) to vary the ancient and approved Form of the Consti∣tution. <Q><HI>Periculosum est res novas et inusitatas indu∣cere.</HI> <BIBL>Co.

<PB N="27" REF="69"/>can be esteemed a <HI>competent Legislature</HI> to judge of the other's <HI>Rights,</HI> without the highest injustice and <HI>iniquity;</HI> which is before demonstrated by some of the first maxims or principles of <HI>Reason.</HI> And yet, howsoever distinct these seve∣ral parts or provinces may seem, in point of situation, as well as in the exercise of a separate legislative power for each, (which constitutional Right they have enjoyed beyond the memory of man,) they are nevertheless firmly united by the circle of the British Diadem, so as to form <HI>one vast Empire,</HI> which will never be divided, if the safe and honest policy be adopted, of maintaining the <HI>British Constitution</HI> inviolate, in all parts of the Empire: for it is a system so <HI>natural,</HI> so <HI>beneficial,</HI> and so <HI>engaging,</HI> to the ge∣nerality of mankind, that by the same means we might hold <HI>the Empire of the World,</HI> were the laws of natural Equity, Justice, and Liberty, to be strictly ob∣served,

I have not, in∣deed, had opportunity to peruse it re∣gularly; neither do I now think it ne∣cessary to do so; for I was lucky enough, when I first took it up, to turn over a few pages in the fourth part, containing five propositions upon the point in ques∣tion, whereby the author's sentiments and intentions may be sufficiently known without descending to his arguments up∣on them; for <HI>not one</HI> of them (not even the 5th and last, which he himself pre∣fers) can possibly be reconciled either to <HI>Law, Equity,</HI> or <HI>sound Politicks;</HI> so that if the doctor, with the <HI>same neglect of Law and constitutional Principles,</HI> had multiplied his propositions to the number of <HI>an hundred times five,</HI> he would not have been able to lay down a plan or
<PB N="35" REF="77"/>mode of government tolerably suitable to the case before him; because, in this, as in many other things, there is but, <HI>one right,</HI> though very many <HI>wrong</HI> me∣thods of proceeding; and the doctor has unfortunately forgot to state the <HI>only right proposition</HI> upon the subject in question, that can be admitted consistently with the necessary principles abovementioned of <HI>Law, Equity, and sound Politicks;</HI> viz. to <HI>do justice</HI> to our brethren of A∣merica; that is, to govern them accord∣ing to the established Principles of the English Constitution, and known Laws of the Land, and candidly to acknow∣ledge their <HI>unalienable</HI> right to the same happy privileges by which the liberties of the mother-country have hitherto been maintained; the most essential of which is the privilege of paying no other taxes than what are voluntarily granted by <HI>the people</HI> or their <HI>legal representatives</HI> in general councils or parliaments.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="78"/>Dr.—is inexcusable for having o∣mitted this <HI>sixth Proposition!</HI> for he can∣not be ignorant of the legal and <HI>established mode of extending the English Constitution to countries detached from this island,</HI> be∣cause we have a standing precedent and example (which has long subsisted, and has been universally allowed) in the present government of <HI>Ireland;</HI> for that island, though unjustly <HI>conquered</HI> by our ances∣tors, enjoys (or, at least, is allowed to be entitled to) the same constitutional privileges as the seat of empire, England itself. The respective Parliaments of the two islands are <HI>entirely independent of each other;</HI> they <HI>separately</HI> grant, from time to time, the necessary supplies to the state; and no man may presume to deny their right of enquiring respectively into the application of them. But, not∣withstanding this distinct oeconomy, and the entire independency of the natives or
<PB N="37" REF="79"/>subjects, with respect to each other, yet they are firmly united, by the <HI>bands of allegiance,</HI> to <HI>one</HI> Head (or Monarchy) of <HI>limited power,</HI> whereby they enjoy the privileges of the <HI>same reasonable common Law,</HI> and the <HI>same excellent Constitution</HI> of state: so that the equality of <HI>privilege</HI> and <HI>condition</HI> renders the <HI>Union</HI> more just and equitable, and consequently more safe and durable, than it could possibly have been made by any other means.</P>
<P>And the inhabitants of both islands (though sprung from a variety of jarring, jealous, and fierce nations) have, by this means, acquired a certain <HI>mutual consideration</HI> for each other, as <HI>fellow-subjects,</HI> which could never have been produced by mere alliances, guarantees, or defensive leagues, nor perhaps by any other mode of government whatever, than that by which Divine Providence has effected it; <HI>viz.</HI> the English Con∣stitution.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="80"/>This has firmly united the <HI>strength</HI> of the two islands; whereby reciprocal suc∣cour in time of need is insured to both. This <HI>established example</HI> of the true con∣stitutional mode of connecting British Dominions, that are otherwise separated by Nature, will enable us, by compari∣son, to discern the illegality and injustice of Dr.—'s five Propositions. The stately vine of British Dominion (if I may use that scriptural type) has pro∣videntially extended its luxuriant branches to the most distant parts of the earth! and will continue to spread and increase as long as <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>the Laws of Li∣berty</HI> are duly maintained by those who are entrusted with the administration of government (unless the wickedness of <HI>individuals,</HI> manifested by the exercise of <HI>domestic Slavery</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI> in the Co∣lonies, and of <HI>political Corruption and Venality</HI> at home, with the <HI>growing vices</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="81"/>attending <HI>both</HI> respectively, should un∣happily draw down God's vengeance upon us! and perhaps our mutual pu∣nishment is at this time impending in the present differences and ignorance of the English Constitution): But how will the trunk or stock of the British Vine appear, if we should entirely separate or lop off the branches?—The American Branches are already <HI>detached,</HI> indeed, (in point of distance,) and widely sepa∣rated from the Trunk, by a vast Ocean, but the imperial Crown of Great-Britain is, nevertheless, a sufficient band of u∣nion or connexion between them, it be∣ing the legal ensign of authority for the maintenance and execution of the same just laws, the influence of which may, by a due constitutional exertion of the regal Power, be circulated, like whole∣some sap, from the root to the most dis∣tant branches.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="82"/>But if (according to Dr.—'s 5th proposition) the flourishing branches of North-America were to be <HI>entirely sepa∣rated</HI> from the trunk, and excluded from the <HI>circle</HI> of the royal <HI>diadem,</HI> the effect would be <HI>reciprocally humiliating;</HI> for the act of separation would, at the same time, unavoidably <HI>contract</HI> the <HI>imperial Authority of the British Empire</HI> to the narrow limits of British and Irish ground, except a few small Sugar-Islands, peo∣pled chiefly by the most miserable of slaves: so that both <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her <HI>Colonies</HI> would reciprocally lose <HI>im∣portance, strength,</HI> and <HI>security,</HI> by the disunion. A Guarantee of independence against all foreign invaders, as proposed by Dr.—, would fall far short of the effect which we enjoy by the present constitution, because it would not, like the latter, produce that <HI>mutual considera∣tion and protection</HI> which are due from
<PB N="41" REF="83"/><HI>fellow-subjects.</HI> Our connexion, accord∣ing to the doctor's measure, would be upon no better footing than Alliances of the same kind with detached foreign Powers, which (as experience teaches us) subsist no longer than the <HI>private in∣terest</HI> or <HI>separate</HI> views of the contracting parties.</P>
<P>If all these points are duly considered, the very proposing so pernicious a mea∣sure must appear highly criminal, if not treasonable! especially as the author has been pleased to insinuate, that there is no alternative!— <Q>If we neither can govern the Americans,</Q> (says he,) <Q>nor be governed by them; if we can neither unite with them, nor ought to subdue them; what remains</Q> (says he) <Q>but to part with them on as friendly terms as we can?</Q> But is it not Trea∣son against the Crown to insinuate that the Americans cannot be <HI>governed,</HI> as
<PB N="42" REF="84"/>well as Treason against the People at large, to say that we cannot <HI>unite</HI> with our American Brethren, when there is a constitutional mode both of <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>Union,</HI> established by law, and an unquestionable precedent, the observance of which would undoubtedly satisfy every honest American Subject?</P>
<P>The advocates for the jurisdiction of the British <HI>Parliament in America,</HI> like all promoters of bad measures, will not fail to represent those, that oppose them, as licentious and disaffected persons; and therefore, as it is highly necessary for the general <HI>welfare</HI> and subsistence of the British Empire, both in Europe, Asia, and America, (upon the principles already explained,) that we should strictly main∣tain our <HI>Loyalty to the Crown,</HI> at the same time that we steadily assert our le∣gal and constitutional Rights,—I think we ought to lose no proper opportunity
<PB N="43" REF="85"/>of expressing our <HI>personal attachment</HI> to the <HI>King and the royal Family,</HI> who, in themselves, indeed are truly amiable, and worthy of esteem; but it is very diffi∣cult, in this world, to guard against misrepresentation and bad advice; how∣ever, I trust that a steady perseverance in <HI>Love and Duty</HI> will be the true means of your prevailing in the end, as it will prove that your opposition is not occa∣sioned either by disaffection or disloyalty, but is <HI>truly legal</HI> and <HI>constitutional.</HI></P>

<HEAD><PB N="51" REF="90"/>PART II. CONTAINING A DECLARATION Or DEFENCE of the same DOCTRINE, (<HI>Viz.</HI> The Natural Right of the People to a Share in the Legislature,) When applied particularly TO THE <HI>PEOPLE of IRELAND;</HI> In ANSWER to the ASSERTIONS of several EMINENT WRITERS on that Point, which have hitherto been permitted to pass without due ANIMADVERSION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the First Part of this De∣claration was sent to the Press, I was not aware that there had been any con∣troversy before the sixth of King <HI>George</HI> I. concerning the freedom of our fellow subjects in <HI>Ireland,</HI> or that any English∣man, acquainted with the principles of
<PB N="52" REF="91"/>our excellent constitution of State, had ever, before that time, presumed to ad∣vance any Doctrine, which might tend to deprive our Irish Brethren of their <HI>na∣tural freedom,</HI> and of the inestimable be∣nefits of that happy legal constitution, which British Subjects in general are commonly supposed to inherit by BIRTH∣RIGHT!</P>
<P>But I have since had the mortification to find, that such great Authorities as Lord Coke, Judge Jenkins, Lord Chief Justice Vaughan, Judge Blackstone, the Honourable Mr. Justice Barrington, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> might be quoted in favour of a contrary Doctrine! And as I have mentioned the Union between Great-Britain and Ireland in the First Part of this Declaration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as an Example of <Q>the true constitution∣al mode of connecting British Domi∣nions that are otherwise separated by nature,</Q> I thought myself therefore,
<PB N="53" REF="92"/>obliged to search and examine the grounds upon which these grew and learned men have founded their opinions, that if they should have <HI>Truth</HI> on their side, they might have the credit of it; but if not, that the <HI>Truth</HI> of this important ques∣tion, when plainly and impartially stated, might prevent for the future any such undue pretensions on the one hand, and jealousies on the other, as have too fre∣quently occasioned misunderstandings and controversies between the Subjects of the two Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Lord Hussey, Chief Justice in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. seems to have been the First who ventured publicly to assert, that <Q>Statutes made in England shall bind the Subject of Ireland<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Hussey, Chief Justice, disoit que les Statuts falts on Angleterre liera ceux de Ireland, que ne suit moult. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s autres Justices, nient obstant que a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n de oux <HI>furent en coutrarid opinione.</HI> le derrein term en son absence. <BIBL>Year Book, 1 Hen.

<PB N="54" REF="93"/>And though the Doctrine is unconstitu∣tional and dangerous, if admitted in a ge∣neral unlimited sense<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><P>Which is clearly proved by Sir Richard Bolton, Chancellor of Ireland, in the Declaration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> printed in Harris's Hibernica, p. 29.— <Q>As to the Opinion of Hussy, Chief Justice, in first of Hen. 7. fol. 3. <HI>that the Statutes made in England shall bind them of Ireland,</HI> this Opinion, as it is put by him generally, <HI>cannot be law;</HI> for Brooke, in abridging <HI>that case in title Par∣liament,</HI> Sect. 19. saith, that that <HI>opinion was denied to be law, the last term before;</HI> and added further, <HI>ta∣men nota, that Ireland is a Realm of itself, and hath a Parliament in itself, implying thereby, that Ireland could not be bound but by a Parliament of Ireland.</HI> And according to that, is the opinion of the Judges in 20th Hen. VI. fol. 8. in John Pilkington's case; and in 2d Rich. III. fol. II. in the Merchants of Wa∣terford's case, before remembered; and likewise con∣trary to the opinion of Hussy, are the judgements of eight several Parliaments in Ireland before the Sta∣tute of 10th of Hen. VII. viz. 13th of Edw. II. 19th of Edw. II. 18th of Hen. VI. 29th of Hen. VI. 32d Hen. VI. 37th Hen. VI. and 8th Edw. IV. And since the Statute 10th Hen. VII. of five Parliaments; viz. 28th of Hen. VIII. 33d of Hen. VIII. 28th of Eliz. 11th of Jam. and 10th Car. besides the Statute of 10th of Hen. VII. itself.</Q></P></NOTE>; yet, in justice to Judge Hussey, it must be allowed, that his Declaration was certainly right with respect to the particular case then before
<PB N="55" REF="94"/>him, which related to the <HI>exportation of goods from Waterford:</HI> for, the Irish sub∣jects themselves do not deny the juris∣diction of Great-Britain upon the high Seas, nor in matters of external<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><P>This binding in external transactions, seems to be allowed (though unwillingly) by Mr. Molly neux, (a zealous asserter of the liberties of Ireland in the Reign of King William.) "They seem" (says he, speaking of English Acts of Parliament) <Q>at the ut∣most reach, to extend the jurisdiction of the English Parliament over the subjects of Ireland, only <HI>in rela∣tion to their action, beyond seas, out of the Realm of Ire∣land, as they are the King of England's subjects,</HI></Q> &amp;c. <BIBL>p. 71.</BIBL></P></NOTE> com∣merce, though the English power, even in that respect, may sometimes perhaps have been extended farther than reason and equity can fairly warrant. But before Lord Chief Justice Hussy delivered his opinion, this proper distinction, concern∣ing the English Acts binding the Irish <HI>in external Transactions,</HI> had been made (in his absence) by the other Judges in
<PB N="56" REF="95"/>a preceding term<NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot"><P>"All the Judges" (but we must except Hussy) <Q>were assembled in the Exchequer Chamber, and there, with respect to the first question, it was said, that the lands of Ireland have a Parliament among themselves, and all kinds of Courts as in England; and, by the same Parliament, they make laws and change laws, and are not bound by Statutes (made) in England, because they have not here Knights of Parliament; but this is understood of lands and things only to be effected in those lands, but their persons are subject to the King, and, as subjects, they are bound to any thing <HI>out of that land,</HI> that is done out of that land contrary to Statute, like as the inhabitants of Calais, Gascoigne, Guicone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> while they were subjects of the King, and in like man∣ner are obedient under the Admiral of England con∣cerning any thing done upon the High-Seas, and also a writ of error of judgement given in Ireland (is cognizable) in the King's Bench here in England.</Q></P>
<P>Anno secundo Rich. III. p. 12. <Q>Omnes Justicia∣rii</Q> (but we must except Hussy) <Q>associati fuerunt in Camera Scaccarii, et ibi quoad primam questionem dicebatur, quod terrae Hiberniae inter se habent Parliamentum et omnimodo Curias prout in Anglia, et per idem Parliamentum faciunt leges et mutant leges, et non <HI>obligantur per statuta in Anglia, qui non hic babent Milites Parliamenti;</HI> sed hoc intelligitur de terris et rebus in terris ill' tantum efficiendo, sed personae illae sunt subjectae Regis, et <HI>tanquam subjecti erunt obligati</HI> ad aliquam rem extra terram <HI>illam fa∣ciendam contra Statutum,</HI> sicut habitantes in Calesia, Gascoignie, Guien, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> dum fuerunt subjecti; et similiter obedientes erunt sub Admirall' Angliae, de re facta super altum mare: et similiter breve de errore de judicio reddito in Hibernia in Banco Re∣gio hic in Anglia,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></NOTE>; which accounts for the remark of the Reporter, that this opi∣nion
<PB N="57" REF="96"/>of Chief Justice Hussy <Q>was not much denied by the other Judges, though some of them were of a contra∣ry opinion the last term in his absence.</Q> But, by the expression, that <Q><HI>it was not much denied,</HI></Q> it is apparent, that the other Judges did not receive the doctrine of Chief Justice Hussy, entirely and ab∣solutely, without <HI>some demur;</HI> which could only consist in their adding that <HI>due distinction</HI> before-mentioned: for it plain∣ly appears (notwithstanding the assertion of the Reporter) that they were not, really, of <HI>a contrary opinion</HI> in the for∣mer term, with respect to the case before them; which related to an <HI>external tran∣saction,</HI> the same that, in their former opi∣nion, they declared to be subject to the
<PB N="58" REF="97"/>controul of England; and, therefore, there was no reason why they should <Q><HI>much deny</HI></Q> the opinion of Chief Justice Hus∣sy, since the particular case before them did not require it.</P>
<P>But the like excuse cannot be made for Sir Edward Coke, who, in Calvin's case, seems to have adopted the opinion of Chief Justice Hussy, and yet has not considered the nature of the case on which the same was delivered, having declared a similar opinion in an indiscriminate ge∣neral sense<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot"><Q>That albeit Ireland was a distinct Dominion, yet the title thereof being by conquest, the same, by judgement of law, might by express words be bound by Act of Parliament of England. <BIBL>Calvin's Case, 7th Rep. p. 444.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, without paying the least regard to that <HI>just distinction</HI> between <HI>the external</HI> and <HI>internal</HI> Government of Ire∣land, which the other Judges had before so clearly laid down and confirmed by an unanswerable reason<NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">See the former note in p. 56. <Q>Quia non hic ha∣bent Milites Parliamenti.</Q></NOTE> why the Irish
<PB N="59" REF="98"/>should not be bound in the latter by any other laws than those to which their own Parliament had assented, viz. <Q><HI>Quia non hic habent Milites Parliamenti:</HI></Q> which Doctrine was agreeable also to what had long before been declared by that celebrated constitutional Lawyer, the great Judge Fortescue on Pilkington's<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>—et auxi la terre de Ireland est severe del' Roiaume d' Angleterre: car si un disme ou quin∣zime soit grante icy, ceo <HI>ne liera ceux d' Ireland</HI> mes{que} le Roy manderoit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m cel' estat</Q> (for estatute) <Q>en Ireland soubz son Grand Seel, sinon que ils veul' en leur Parliament ceo approver mes s'ils veul al∣lower ceo, donq sera tenu la et ils seront liès par icel'. <BIBL>Year Book 19th Hen.

<PB N="60" REF="99"/>Ascough<NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot"><P>The case is stated by Sir Richard Bolton, Chancellor of Ireland, in his Declaration, &amp;c. print∣ed in Harris's Hibernica, p. 15. as follows: <Q>That one John Pilkington brought a scire facias against one A. to shew cause, why Letters Patents, whereby the King had granted an office in Ire∣land to the said A. should not be repealed, whereas, the said John Pilkington had the same Office grant∣ed him by former Letters Patents granted by the same King, to occupy to himself or his Deputy. Whereupon the said A. was warned and appeared, and said, 'That the <HI>land of Ireland, time beyond the memory of man, hath been a land separated and severed from the Realm of England,</HI> and ruled and <HI>governed by the customs and laws of the same land of Ireland.</HI> And that the Lords of the same land, which are of the King's Council, have used, from time to time in the <HI>absence of the King, to elect a Justice,</HI> which Justice, so elected, hath power to pardon and punish all felo∣nies, trespasses, <HI>&amp;c. and to assemble a Parliament;</HI> and by the advice of the Lords and <HI>Commonalty to make Statutes; and he alledgeth further,</HI> that a Parliament was assembled, and that it was ordained by the said Parliament, that every man who had any office with∣in the said land, before a certain day, <HI>and he puts the day in certain.</HI> shall occupy the said Office by himself, or otherwise that he shall forfeit his office. <HI>And sheweth further,</HI> how the said John Pilkington oc∣cupied the said office by a deputy, and that, inso∣much as he came not in proper person to reside upon his office before the day, that his office was void,
<PB N="61" REF="100"/>and that the King, by his Letters Patents, granted the said office, so become void, to the said A. and prayed that the said Letters Patents should be effec∣tual, and not repealed.' And upon the plea the said John Pilkington demurred in law. In the ar∣gument of which case, it was debated by the Judges, Yelverton, Fortescue, Portington, Markham, and Ascough, whether the said prescription were good, or void in law; Yelverton and Portington held the prescription void; <HI>but Fortesine, Markham, and As∣cough,</HI> held the prescription good, and that the <HI>Let∣ters Patents made to A. were good and effectual,</HI> and ought not to be repeated: and in the argument of this case it was agreed, by Fortescue and Portington, <HI>that if a tenth or fifteenth be granted by Parliament in England,</HI> that shall not <HI>bind them in Ireland;</HI> although the King send the same <HI>Statute into Ireland under his great seal: except they in Ireland will in their Parlia∣ment approve it;</HI> but if they will <HI>approve it, then it shall bind in Ireland.</HI> And Portington said, that if a tenth be granted in the Parliament of England, <HI>that shall not bind in Ireland,</HI> because they have not any <HI>commandment by writ to come to our Parliament;</HI> and this was not denied by Markham, Yelverton, or Ascough. Upon this case these points following are to be observed, First, that the Lords of the Council of Ireland had then power, in the <HI>absence of the King, and vacancy of a Lieutenant or Deputy, to elect a Justice.</HI> and that is plainly proved by the preamble of the Statutes of 33d of Hen. VIII. chap. 2. in Ireland. The words are these; 'For as much as continually
<PB N="62" REF="101"/>sithens the conquest of this Realm of Ireland, it hath been used in this same Realm of Ireland, that at every such time, as it hath chaunced the same Realm to be destitute of a Lieutenant, Deputy, Justice, or other head Governour, by death, surrender, or de∣parture out of the said Realm, or otherwise, the Council of this Realm of Ireland, for the time be∣ing have used, by the laws and usages of the same, to assemble themselves <HI>together to choose and elect a Justice, to be Ruler and Governor of this Realm,</HI> till the King's Highness had deputed and ordained a Lieutenant, Deputy, or other Governor for the same Realm; which Justice, so being elected, was, and hath been, always by the ancient laws and customs of this said Realm of Ireland, authorised to do and exercise the said roume of Deputy there, for the good rule and governance, and leading of the King's sub∣jects within the said Realm of Ireland, and in mi∣nistration of Justice, with divers other authorities, pre-eminences, and jurisdictions there; which usage, election, and authority of the said Justice, hath been many times ratified and confirmed by divers Statutes in this Realm provided and made. But this order of election of a Justice is now, by the laid Sta∣tute of 33d of Hen. VIII. altered; as by the said Statute more at large may appear.</Q></P>
<PB N="60" REF="99"/></NOTE></Q> Sir John Fortescue had declared, that, <Q>if a tenth or fif∣teenth
<PB N="61" REF="100"/>were granted here, this should not bind those of Ireland, even though
<PB N="62" REF="101"/>the King should send the same Statute into Ireland under his great seal, ex∣cept they will in their Parliament ap∣prove it; but, if they will allow it,</Q> <HI>(i. e.)</HI> <Q>then it shall be held there,
<PB N="63" REF="102"/>and they shall be bound by it.</Q> And to this point Judge Portington expressly declared his assent<NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot"><Q>— et auxi quant a ceo que Fortescue ad dit, que si un Disme soit grante en le Parliament icy, <HI>ceo ne liera ceux</HI> d' Ireland; <HI>Jeo veux bien pur ceo que ils n'ont commandment</HI> ove nous per breve de venir al' Parliament. <BIBL>Year Book, 19th Hen.

<P>But Lord Coke has unfortunately ne∣glected to weigh the importance of this just <HI>Reason,</HI> and consequently has been led to misconstrue the doctrine to which it has at different times been applied by the Judges; for, in Calvin's Case, (7th Rep. p. 447.) he cites the opinion of the Judges in 2d Rich.

<P><PB N="65" REF="104"/>The <HI>naming</HI> or <HI>not naming</HI> Ireland, in our English Acts, cannot in the least affect the argument of the former Judges; for, if it holds good to secure the Irish sub∣jects from being bound, <HI>when not "espe∣cially named,"</HI> (which is allowed even by Sir Edward Coke himself,) it certain∣ly is equally effectual <HI>when they are na∣med;</HI> or rather, (I ought to say,) the Rea∣son is much more forcible in the latter case, which apparently enhances the propriety and importance of it; because, when the business relating to Ireland is debated, it is manifest that the Irish sub∣jects stand most in need of a <HI>due repre∣sentation,</HI> which cannot therefore be de∣nied them at such a time, without the most flagrant violation of Justice and na∣tunal Equity!</P>

And yet, alas! he has repeated the same in this very page, immediately after the Information, before quoted, concerning the Nobles of Ireland being summoned to the Parliament of England; for he adds,—"and <HI>by special words</HI>" (says he) <Q>the Parliament of England <HI>may bind the Subjects of Ireland;</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but, it lucklly happens, that he is less reserved in this place than in the other passage al∣ready is asserted; for here he has attempt∣ed to justify his opinion by an example, which, out of respect to so great an au∣thor,
<PB N="68" REF="107"/>we may, of course, presume to be the very best that could have been pro∣duced for that purpose; especially since he mentions it as <Q><HI>one example for many;</HI></Q> and yet, happily for the truth, this <HI>"one example for many"</HI> proves no∣thing so much (when duly considered) as the direct contrary to his assertion, about <HI>binding Ireland</HI> <Q>by <HI>special words,</HI></Q> &amp;c. for it amounts to an <HI>implied acknowledgment, upon public re∣cord,</HI> of the injustice of pretending to <HI>"bind the Subjects of Ireland"</HI> without their express consent; being, in reality, a copy of the King's Writ (before∣mentioned) to summon the <HI>Nobles of Ireland</HI> <Q>to the Parliament at West∣minster, <HI>there</HI> to treat with the No∣bles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of his Kingdom <HI>upon the State of the said Land,</HI></Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> Ireland.

<PB N="69" REF="108"/>did not esteem it equitable to de∣bate "upon <HI>the State of the said Land,</HI>"— ("super statu terrae praedictae,") with∣out some legislative representation there∣of.

<PB N="71" REF="110"/>that this was really the case, is clearly proved by some other English records, cited by Mr. Mollyneux, in his Case of Ireland, pp. 73, and 74. whereby it appears, that even <Q>Knights of the Shires, Citizens, and Burgesses, were elected in the Shires, Cities, and Boroughs, <HI>of Ireland,</HI> to serve in Par∣liament <HI>in England</HI></Q> <NOTE N="(15)" PLACE="foot"><P>"Formerly" (says Mr. Mollyneux) "when Ireland was but thinly peopled, and the English laws not fully current in all parts of the Kingdom, it is probable, that then they could not frequently assemble with conveniency or safety to make laws in their own Parliament at home; and therefore, du∣ring the heats of rebellions, or confusion of the times, they were forced to enact laws in England. But then this was always by their proper Represen∣tatives: For we find, that in the Reign of Edward the Third, and by what foregoes, it is plain it <HI>was so in Edward the First's time; Knights of the Shire, Citizens, and Burgesses, were elected in the Shires, Ci∣ties, and Boroughs of Ireland, to serve in Parliament in England;</HI> and have so served accordingly. For, amongst the records of the Tower of London, Roe. Claus. 50. Edward the Third, Parl. 2. Memb. 23. we find a writ from the King at Westminster, di∣rected to James Butler, Lord Justice of Ireland, and to R. Archbishop of Dublin, his Chancellor, re∣quiring them to issue writs, under the great Seal of Ireland, to the several Counties, Cities, and Bo∣roughs, for satisfying the expences of the men of that land, who last came over to serve in Parliament in England. And, in another roll, the 50th of Edw. III. Membr. 19. on complaint to the King by John Draper, who was chosen Burgess of Cork by writ, and served in the Parliament of England, and yet was denied his expences by some of the Citizens, care was taken to reimburse him.</P>
<P>If, from these last mentioned records, it be con∣cluded that the Parliament of England may bind Ireland; it must also be allowed, that the people of Ireland ought to have their Representatives in the Parliament of England. And this, I believe, we should be willing enough to embrace; but this is in happiness we can hardly hope for.</P>
<P>This sending of Representatives out of Ireland to the Parliament in England, on some occasions, was found in process of time to be very troublesome and inconvenient; and this we may presume was the reason that, afterwards, when times were more settled, we fell again into our old track and regu∣lar course of Parliaments in our own country; and hereupon the laws afore-noted, page 64, were en∣acted, establishing, that <HI>no law made in the Parliament of England should be of force in Ireland, till it was al∣lowed and published in Parliament here.</HI></P></NOTE>; which an∣cient
<PB N="72" REF="111"/>privilege of the <HI>Irish Commoned</HI> has either been unknown, or also over∣looked
<PB N="73" REF="112"/>and forgot by Lord Coke; and indeed it is not probable that the Irish Parliament was ever summoned to Eng∣land <HI>regularly,</HI> or as a matter <HI>of course,</HI> to meet the English Parliament, but only on extraordinary occasions, wherein the Subjects of Ireland were particularly con∣cerned, and could not, we may pre∣sume, be "<HI>specially named</HI>" and bound, (that is consistently with <HI>natural equity</HI> and their own <HI>just rights</HI>) without their express assent: for it is apparent that <HI>re∣gular Parliaments</HI> were held <HI>in Ireland.</HI> both BEFORE, <HI>since,</HI> and even <HI>during the Reigns of those very Princes</HI> who issued writs to summon them to <HI>England;</HI> which latter, therefore, can only be attri∣buted to some extraordinary or peculiar circumstances, (out of common course) which rendered it necessary.</P>
<P>In addition to the clear Precedents be∣fore cited, it may not perhaps be impro∣per to take notice of a circumstance
<PB N="74" REF="113"/>quoted by the Honourable Mr. Justice Barrington, from Petyt, MSS. Vol. XXVII. p. 294. for though it is not a Precedent exactly to the point in ques∣tion, (<HI>i. e.</HI> the sending Representatives from Ireland to the <HI>English Parliament,</HI>) yet it tends to corroborate the same equi∣table Doctrine concerning the necessity of <HI>Representation</HI> in general, which ought to be the basis of all determinations ei∣ther in the <HI>Privy Council,</HI> (to which the example particularly relates,) or else∣where. <Q>There is a writ (says he) of Edward III. in the 50th Year of his Reign, to oblige the Inhabitants of <HI>Cork</HI> to pay the expences of <HI>John Droup,</HI> who is stated to have <HI>been cho∣sen by the Community to attend the King's Privy Council in England</HI> <NOTE N="(16)" PLACE="foot">"Observations on the more ancient Statutes," &amp;c. p. 145.</NOTE>.</Q> The Business of his attendance, however, does not appear; but on whatever account he might attend <HI>the Privy Council,</HI> he was
<PB N="75" REF="114"/>probably the same person that is men∣tioned in the record before cited from Mr. Mollyneux, by the name of <HI>John Draper,</HI> <Q>who was chosen Burgess of <HI>Cork</HI> by Writ, and served in the Par∣liament of England;</Q> for, as the other circumstances correspond, both with re∣spect to <HI>the place</HI> from whence he came, and <HI>the year</HI> of his being sent, it is natu∣ral to conclude, that the small disagree∣ment in the name may have been occa∣sioned by some accidental mistake, <HI>viz. John Droup</HI> for <HI>John Draper,</HI> or <HI>vice versa;</HI> and he might serve the Inhabi∣tants of <HI>Cork</HI> in the double capacity of <HI>Representative in Parliament,</HI> and Agent for them to the <HI>Privy Council;</HI> or per∣haps his summons and attendance, even at the <HI>King's Privy Council,</HI> might have been in his <HI>parliamentary</HI> capacity; for if a due Representation from Ireland was to attend the King here <HI>in his Privy Council,</HI> such an Assembly might, with∣out
<PB N="76" REF="115"/>danger, I apprehend, be allowed all the powers of an <HI>effectual Legislative to bind Ireland,</HI> provided the respective branches of Irish Representation be pre∣served entire and distinct; for the <HI>En∣glish Privy Council</HI> could have no legal voice in such a case, except that of ad∣vising the assent or dissent of the Sove∣reign; and yet, whenever it was neces∣sary to call <HI>a distinct</HI> Irish Parliament in England, it is not improbable, but that they might be summoned to meet the <HI>King in his Privy Council</HI> by way, of dis∣tinguishing their separate Assembly from the joint-meeting of the English and Irish Parliaments before-mentioned. And that such <HI>distinct Irish Parliaments</HI> have sometimes been held <HI>in England</HI> ap∣pears by a record cited by Mr. Molly∣neux<NOTE N="(17)" PLACE="foot"><Q>There have been other Statutes or Ordinan∣ces, made in England for Ireland, which may <HI>rea∣sonably</HI> be of force here, because they were made and <HI>assented to by our own Representatives.</HI> Thus we find in the White Book of the Exchequer in Dublin, in the 9th Year of Edward the First, a writ sent to his Chancellor of Ireland, wherein he men∣tions <HI>Quaedam Statuta per nos de Assensa Prelatorum Comitum Baronum &amp; Communitates Regni nostri Hibex∣niae, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>per upud Lincoln &amp; quaedam alia Statuta post∣modum papud Eborum facta.</HI> These we may suppose were either Statutes made at the request of the States of Ireland, to explain to them the Common Law of England: or if they were introductive of new laws, yet they might well be of force in Ireland, being enacted by the assent of our own Representatives, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons of Ireland; as the words afore-mentioned do shew: and, indeed, these are instances so far from making against our claim, that I think nothing can be more plainly for us; for it manifestly shews, (that the King and Parliament of England would not enact laws, to bind Ireland, without the concurrence of the Representatives of this Kingdom.</Q></NOTE>, wherein mention is made of
<PB N="77" REF="116"/>Statutes made at <HI>Lincoln</HI> and at <HI>York</HI> in the 9th of Edw.

<PB N="78" REF="117"/>well in <HI>separate</HI> as in <HI>joint</HI> Parliaments; and, upon such equitable terms of Repre∣sentation <HI>in England,</HI> I presume, no Irish Patriot will object to the <HI>binding</HI> of <HI>English</HI> Statutes<NOTE N="(18)" PLACE="foot"><P>— "Add hereunto," (says Sir William Petty in his Political Survey of Ireland, p. 31.) <Q>that if both Kingdoms were <HI>under one Legislative Power and Parliament, the Members whereof should be pro∣portionable in power and wealth of each Nation,</HI> there would be no danger such a Parliament should do any thing to the prejudice of the <HI>English</HI> interest in <HI>Ire∣land;</HI> nor could the <HI>Irish</HI> ever complain of partiality when they shall be <HI>freely and proportionably represented</HI> in all Legislatures.</Q> The same author has also made a very striking remark in p. 97, concerning the neces∣sity of maintaining the independence of the <HI>Legislative Power,</HI> whether we apply the same to <HI>Ireland,</HI> or to any other part of the <HI>British</HI> Empire; for <Q>why should men</Q> (says he) <Q>endeavour to get estates, where <HI>the Legislative Power</HI> is not agreed upon, and where tricks and words destroy <HI>natural Rights</HI> and Pro∣perty?</Q></P></NOTE> whether Ireland be "<HI>especially named</HI>" or not; because the just reason of objection, before cited from the Judges in the 19th of Henry VI. and 2d Richard III. no longer sub∣sists when a due Representation is al∣lowed.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="118"/>How much <HI>later</HI> than the Reign of Edw. III. this practice was continued, of <HI>occasionally</HI> summoning the Irish Par∣liament <HI>into England,</HI> does not appear; though we may be certain that it did not continue so late as the Reign of Hen. VI. because the great Fortescue and the other Judges, his cotemporaries, could not have declared (as has already been shewn) that <Q>a tenth or fifteenth, granted <HI>here,</HI> should <HI>not bind</HI> those of Ireland,</Q> if the practice of sending <HI>Representatives from thence</HI> had continued to that time: nevertheless, the proofs already produ∣ced are amply sufficient to confute the observation of Judge Jenkins in his 4th Century, p. 164, <HI>viz.</HI> that <Q>the Sta∣tutes of England, which <HI>expressly</HI> name <HI>Ireland, bind them and their Lands and Goods.</HI> As the Statute of York</Q> (says he) <Q>made 12th E. II. and the 13th E. I. de Mercatoribus, and others:</Q> For, as I have produced sufficient exam∣ples
<PB N="80" REF="119"/>of the Irish Parliament being sum∣moned to England in <HI>both the Reigns</HI> which he has mentioned, these Statutes cited by him can afford no testimony of what he supposes, because the Irish might probably have been <HI>represented in those very</HI> Parliaments; for which opi∣nion (I have already shewn) there is <HI>some evidence,</HI> and I am not apprehensive that <HI>any evidence at all</HI> can be produced to the contrary.</P>
<P>The same reply holds good also, against the most material examples cited in Serjeant Mayart's answer to Sir Rich∣ard Bolton's Declaration<NOTE N="(19)" PLACE="foot"><P>The learned Editor of these two Tracts, (Mr. Harris,) who has published them in his Hibernica, (printed at Dublin in 1770,) supposes, that <HI>Sir Rich∣ard Bolton</HI> was <HI>not</HI> the author of this Declaration, and informs us, in his Preface, that he is <Q>inclined ra∣ther to give the honour of the performance to Patrick Darcey, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> an eminent Lawyer and an active Member of the House of Commons in the Parlia∣ment assembled at Dublin in 1640,</Q> who was the au∣thor

<PB N="82" REF="121"/>which were so diametrically opposite to his own just principles; though indeed no danger whatever can justify such conduct, since "honesty is always" (most certainly) "the best policy." Nevertheless, not on∣ly Serjeant Mayart's answer acknowledges Sir Richard as the author of the Declaration; but Mr. Mollyneux in p. 48, and 49, cites a marginal note of Sir Rich∣ard's, (when he was Lord Chief Baron of the Exche∣quer in Ireland,) which he had affixed in his Edition of the Irish Statutes, Stat. 10 Henry VII. c. 22. to the following purport; <HI>resembling</HI> the substance of the Declaration, attributed to Sir Rich.

Moreover in 28th of Edw. I.—5th of Edw. III.—14th of Edw. III.—25th of Edw. III. —34th of Edw. III.—and 7th of Rich.

<PB N="88" REF="127"/>for the punishment of witchcraft and sorcery, and another Act in the same year, chap. 14. for the pu∣nishment of forgery; which Acts were not of force in Ireland until the same were enacted by Parlia∣ment there in 28th Eliz. chap. 2, 3.—In 28th Hen.

<P><PB N="88" REF="127"/>Of the general examples which he has cited, that in the 10th of Hen. VII. (one of Poining's Acts) whereby all the
<PB N="89" REF="128"/>English Statutes then in force were adopted by the Irish, is the most re∣markable; and it is necessary to take par∣ticular notice of this Act, because the ef∣fect of it is frequently misunderstood; for some have supposed, that hereby <Q>all the Statutes, made in the Parliament of England concerning the public, should be observed in Ireland,</Q> without obser∣ving any farther distinction<NOTE N="(21)" PLACE="foot"><P>In this indiscriminate manner Monsieur Ra∣pin has expressed himself, and has thereby given a wrong Idea of the Irish Legislature to such of his rea∣ders as do not care for the trouble of secking better in∣formation; for, in speaking of the two Statutes, com∣monly called <HI>Poining's Acts,</HI> (after having mentioned that Act relating to the King's permission for assembling the Parliament,) he adds, <Q>Un autre portoit que tous les Actes faits dans le Parliament d'Angleterre, con∣cernant le Public, seroient observez on Irlande.

<PB N="90" REF="129"/>they thought the Statute capable of in∣cluding, not only all the English Acts then made, but, likewise, all such as should be ordained in future: and, if this had really been the case, it would have been in vain to have contended for the Liberties of Ireland; but the Act itself is not capable of such a <HI>construction,</HI> not∣withstanding that some have thought it doubtfully worded. The tenor of it is recited by Lord Coke, in his 4th instit. p. 351. as follows: <Q>That all Statutes, <HI>late</HI> made within the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> concerning or belonging to the com∣mon or public weal of the same, from henceforth be deemed good and effec∣tual in the Law, and over that be ac∣cepted, used, and executed, within this land of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in all points, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> And though the word <HI>late</HI> was afterwards deemed a doubtful expression, with re∣spect to the extent of its effect, yet it suf∣ficiently restrains the Act to the introduc∣tion
<PB N="91" REF="130"/>of such <HI>English</HI> Statutes <HI>only</HI> as were of prior date; which effect is confirmed also by a resolution of the Judges, in the 10th of James, cited by Lord Coke in the same page<NOTE N="(22)" PLACE="foot"><Q>And, Hil. 10.

H. 7. But it is to be observed, that such Acts of Parliament as have been made in England since 10. H. 7. wherein Ire∣land is not particularly named or generally included, extend not thereunto; for that, albeit it be govern∣ed by the same law, yet is it <HI>a distinct Realm</HI> or <HI>Kingdome,</HI> and (as hath been said) <HI>hath Parliaments there.</HI> <BIBL>4. Inst. p. 351.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; and he has like∣wise stated the true effect of that Act in his ist Institute, 141 <HI>b. Viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>By an Act of Parliament (called <HI>Poining's Law</HI>), holden in Ireland</Q> (says he) <Q>in the 10th yeare of Hen∣ry the 7th, it is enacted, That all Sta∣tutes, made in this Realme of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> BEFORE THAT TIME, should be
<PB N="92" REF="131"/>of force, and be put in use, within the Realme of <HI>Ireland,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Act of Poining's, therefore, suffi∣ciently proves what Sir Richard Bolton intended by citing it, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Irish</HI> did not esteem the <HI>English</HI> Laws <HI>binding in that Kingdom</HI> until allowed by the Au∣thority of their own Parliament, other∣wise the Act itself had been nugatory, as also the other Irish Acts which he has cited for the same purpose; in some of which, it seems, the Parliament itself expressly asserted the Doctrine for which he contends; as in that of the 19th of Edw. II. wherein it was enacted, <Q>That the Statutes, made in <HI>England,</HI> SHOULD NOT BE OF FORCE in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> unless they were allowed and published in that Kingdom by Parlia∣ment.</Q> <NOTE N="(23)" PLACE="foot">See Sir Richard Bolton's Declarations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Harris's Hibernica, p. 15.</NOTE> Sir Richard Bolton also
<PB N="93" REF="132"/>informs us, that <Q>a like Statute was made again in the 29th of Henry VI.</Q> and therefore, notwithstanding that Ser∣jeant Mayart has taken great pains, and filled many pages with citations of prece∣dents from old Records of Law Cases, Writs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (in order to prove that <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Acts of Parliament have been re∣ferred to, and allowed in judicial Pro∣ceedings, before the same were con∣firmed in <HI>Ireland,</HI>) yet all his labour has been bestowed in vain; for (besides that he ought first to have proved the Acts in question to have been made by the <HI>English</HI> Parliament alone, without any such representation of the <HI>Irish</HI> Parlia∣ment jointly therewith, as I have already shewn to have been frequently practised in those early days) let it be also remark∣ed, that, though we should allow that the <HI>Irish</HI> Courts of Justice might, per∣haps, in some particular cases of <HI>diffe∣rence</HI> between individuals, but of <HI>indiffe∣rence</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="133"/>to the general Liberties of <HI>Ireland,</HI> have followed the directions of some mere <HI>English</HI> Acts of Parliament, as esteeming them wholesome regulations of Justice, proper to be adopted for the determination of the Cases before them, yet the <HI>Confir∣mation</HI> of such Acts afterwards, at diffe∣rent periods, clearly proves the irregulari∣ty of such premature proceedings in the Courts, and that the highest Court of that Kingdom, the Court of Parliament, did not esteem the <HI>English</HI> Acts <HI>of suffi∣cient legal Authority</HI> till confirmed by themselves; for, otherwise, the <HI>Confir∣mation</HI> would have been <HI>unnecessary,</HI> since the Acts (if Serjeant Mayart's examples are admitted) were already re∣ceived into use; and, therefore, all such Court-Precedents, as are cited by the learned Serjeant, are clearly Precedents of <HI>Irregularities</HI> and not of <HI>Law;</HI> so that they are not intitled to any considera∣tion at all; especially as the Irish Legisla∣ture
<PB N="95" REF="134"/>itself (which has certainly a better right to determine what shall be esteemed Law in Ireland than any of the inferior Courts) has positively declared, by the express Acts of the 19th of Edward II. and the 29th of Henry VI. before cited, that <HI>English</HI> Statutes shall not be of force in <HI>Ireland,</HI> unless allowed by the <HI>Irish</HI> Parliament! And agreeable to this is the Declaration of the Irish House of Com∣mons in 1641, Article the first: That <Q>the Subjects of this his Majesty's King∣dom of Ireland are a free people, and to be governed only according to the <HI>common Law</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and Statutes made and established by Parliament in this Kingdome of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and ac∣cording to the lawful Customes used in the same. <BIBL>p. 133.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Now, though the Conviction by these weighty Authorities will probably destroy the credit of Serjeant Mayart, as a wri∣ter,
<PB N="96" REF="135"/>in the opinion of every honest Irish∣man, yet the Irish are more obliged to this Author than he himself, perhaps, intended they should be; for he clearly proves that <HI>a Charter of Liberties</HI> <NOTE N="(24)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>For the only mistake of <HI>Lord Coke</HI> is, that he conceived</Q> (says he) <Q>that <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was not of force in <HI>Ireland</HI> 'till the 10th of Hen. 7. which is only a mistake of a matter of fact: for <HI>in truth we find</HI></Q> (continues the Serjeant) <Q>that sta∣tute was given to them of Ireland in the first year of Hen. 3. and all the Chapters thereof (except three or four of the last Chapters) are entered in the Red Book of the Exchequer of Ireland, where, in the beginning, after the King's stile recited, he saith, Imprimis concessimus Deo, et hac praesenti Chartâ nostrâ confirmamus pro nobis &amp; haeredibus nostris in perpetuum, quod Hibernica Ecclesia libera sit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — First, we have granted to God, and, by this our Charter, confirm, for us and our heirs for ever, that the Church of Ireland be frec. — Sir John Davis cites a Record in the Tower, 1st of Hen. 3.

"By this" (says he) <Q>it appeareth why the extortion of <HI>Coigne</HI> and <HI>Livery</HI> is called, in the old Statutes of Ireland, A DAMNABLE CUSTOME, and the imposing and taking thereof made <HI>High-Treason.</HI> And it is said, in an antient Discourse</Q> (says he) <Q><HI>of the Decay of Ireland,</HI> that, though it were first invent∣ed in <HI>Hell,</HI> yet, if it had been used and practised there as it hath been in Ireland, it had long since destroyed the very Kingdom of Beelzebub.</Q> The same bad effects are produced, in some degree, by every kind of <HI>Vassalage;</HI> so that the bad Policy of establishing <HI>Seigneuries</HI> in Canada. or eltewhere, is but too apparent.</P>
<PB N="97" REF="136"/></NOTE> pretences they 
<PB N="98" REF="137"/>devoured the <HI>poor Natives</HI> as well as the poorer sort of <HI>English</HI> Settlers, and thereby occasioned almost conti∣nual Wars for several ages; which, in the end, turned out to their own great peril and disadvantage, accord∣ing to the never-failing maxim, or rather warning, of the Apostle Paul; <Q><HI>If ye bite and devour one another,</HI> take heed that ye be not <HI>consumed one of another.</HI> <BIBL>Gal. v. 15.</BIBL></Q> But, though the <HI>Irish</HI> were, by this wretched Policy of the <HI>English,</HI> long deprived of the <HI>Benefit</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> Common Law, yet this by no means deprived them of their just <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Claim</HI> to it, which must necessarily be acknowledged to have been due from the time that the English first settled in that Country.</P>
<PB N="97" REF="136"/></NOTE>, were as much entitled to <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="137"/>Liberty, and all the Immunities and Be∣nefits of the <HI>English</HI> Common Law, as the Inhabitants of England themselves: and yet Lord Coke himself, it seems<NOTE N="(26)" PLACE="foot">2d Inst. p. 2.</NOTE>, was not aware of this Circumstance, but
<PB N="99" REF="138"/>"Conceived" (says Serjeant Mayart, p. 226.) <Q>that <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was not of force <HI>in Ireland</HI> till the 10th of Hen. 7. which is only a mistake</Q> (says he) <Q>of a matter of fact; for <HI>in truth we find</HI></Q> (says he) <Q>that Statute was given to them of Ireland in the first year of Hen. 3. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> But though this was only <HI>"a mistake of a matter of fact,"</HI> yet it was such a mistake as might pro∣bably, in great measure, have occasioned the erroneous opinions ever after, of that great and worthy man, concerning the Constitution of Ireland.</P>
<P>But Serjeant Mayart has not profited so much as might have been expected by this knowledge that the Subjects of <HI>Ire∣land</HI> were honoured with a distinct Char∣ter; for, after pointing out (in page 227) the several Chapters of the Charter, wherein (as he supposes) <Q>that Law dif∣fers from the antient common Law,</Q>
<PB N="100" REF="139"/>he adds them triumphantly to his Collec∣tion of Precedents for binding <HI>Ireland</HI> by Statutes made in <HI>England;</HI> as if <HI>a Charter of Liberties,</HI> freely given and gladly accepted, could afford any Evi∣dence <HI>against Liberty!</HI> For this undis∣tinguishing man did not consider that the King, by this Charter of Liberties, <HI>binds and restrains</HI> himself (rather than his Peo∣ple) in all the most dangerous points of Prerogative, wherein the Rulers of other Countries are left too much <HI>unlimited;</HI> and therefore that the Subjects of <HI>Ireland</HI> might accept the same (which they most willingly did) without the least Deroga∣tion from their just and natural Rights.</P>
<P>And, as this Charter was granted to the <HI>"King's Subjects in Ireland"</HI> with∣out distinction, it affords the most am∣ple proof that even the <HI>conquered Irish</HI> were entitled to all the Immunities, Pro∣tection, and Benefits, which the <HI>English
<PB N="101" REF="140"/>Conquerors themselves</HI> enjoyed by it: for even Serjeant Mayart himself proves (in p. 67.) that the English Laws <Q><HI>were given at first</HI></Q> — <Q><HI>tam</HI> ANGLIS QUAM HIBERNICIS, <HI>as well to</HI> ENG∣LISH AS IRISH</Q> <NOTE N="(27)" PLACE="foot"><P>Serjeant Mayart also informs us, <Q>That the whole Realm of Ireland was antiently reduced into Counties, and that the English Laws had passage throughout the same, as appears" (says he) "by several Pipe-Rolls of the Time of Hen. 3. in the Exchequer of Ireland, where there are accounts</Q> (says he) <Q>made for fines, paid by the mere <HI>Irish,</HI> for <HI>Dis∣seisins,</HI> and many other kinds of Trespasses, com∣mitted by them in those places, which the Author calls <HI>Irish</HI> Territories; though some of the Irish, with their posterity after them, being always <HI>averse</HI> to the English Laws, could not digest them, but hid themselves in the bogs, mountains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> But this aversion of <HI>"some of the Irish"</HI> to the English Laws is easily accounted for, since it appears very clearly, from Sir John Davies's Book, that the Irishry had much more experience and woful knowledge of <HI>English Op∣pression</HI> than of the <HI>English Laws;</HI> for, when any of them wore driven from their Lands and Possessions through the avarice, and by the unlawful power, of the great English Lords, who found their interest in treat∣ing them as enemies, it was very <HI>natural</HI> for them to at∣tempt to <HI>disseize,</HI> and recover their former Rights and Possessions: and again, when they found no Protection from the English Laws, nor other exertion thereof than that of <HI>sining</HI> and <HI>punishing</HI> them for such <HI>"Disseizins," &amp;c.</HI> which were mere <HI>Re-entries,</HI> it was <HI>equally natural</HI> for them to imbibe prejudices against the English Laws, and to fly to their Bogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus the <HI>English Oppres∣sions</HI> were apparently the cause why <HI>some</HI> of the Irish were averse to the <HI>English Laws;</HI> which I have express∣ed more at large in a Note on p. 108.</P></NOTE>. The Irish Na∣tion
<PB N="102" REF="141"/>are also obliged to Serjeant Mayart for some other Proofs in their favour, <HI>which he intended against them:</HI> for, a∣mongst his Precedents of <HI>giving Law,</HI> he informs us, in p. 219. <Q>that, in the Reign of King Henry II. <HI>the common Law</HI> and <HI>lawful</HI> Customs of <HI>England</HI> were received, planted, and establish∣ed, in this his Majesty's Kingdom of Ireland;</Q> a Point which every Irish Patriot is zealous to maintain! And he has favoured us, in page 220, with an∣other notable Example of binding the <HI>Irish</HI> by <HI>English</HI> Laws: this, it seems, was in the Reign of King John, <Q>of whom,</Q> (says he triumphantly,) <Q>in
<PB N="103" REF="142"/>that respect, it may be well said, that, <HI>Statuit et praecepit Leges;</HI> he <HI>appointed and established the Laws;</HI> as also because he put them in writing, and left them in his Court of Exchequer for their better directions:</Q> but he happily in∣forms us at the same time, (which spoils his own application of the Precedent,) that all this was done <HI>"at the instance"</HI> (says he) <Q><HI>of the Irish,</HI> (as the Record saith,) or of the English who account∣ed themselves Irish,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And there∣fore, as these English Laws and Customs are clearly acknowledged by himself to have been introduced <Q><HI>at the instance of the Irish,</HI></Q> it must manifestly appear, that this antient example excludes the Doctrine which he meant to support by it, in opposition to Sir Richard Bolton; and therefore, if all these points are duly considered, I think we may very fairly retort his own words (which he exulting∣ly applied to Sir Richard Bolton) upon
<PB N="104" REF="143"/>himself! <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>Whereupon it must needs also follow, that the Author's Discourse</HI> FALLS ALL IN PIECES, <HI>and is nothing</HI> to the purpose that he would have it.</Q></P>
<P>Serjeant Mayart has also taken a great deal of needless pains to prove <Q><HI>Ireland</HI> to be annexed to <HI>the Crown of England,</HI></Q> and that <Q>the King and Parliament of England have Power over Ireland,</Q> and he cites several Acts of Parliament, and other Authorities, in pages 64 and 65 of his <HI>Answer,</HI> in the <HI>Hibernica,</HI> which clearly prove, indeed, the <HI>former part of the Assertion,</HI> (that Ireland is annexed to the Crown of England;) a point which the Irish themselves are so far from deny∣ing, that they are rather desirous to main∣tain it<NOTE N="(28)" PLACE="foot"><P>Case of Ireland, p. 96. <Q><HI>It has ever been ac∣knowledged that the Kingdom of Ireland is inseparably annexed to the Imperial Crown of England</HI> The obli∣gation that our Legislature lies under by Poining's
<PB N="105" REF="144"/>Act, 10 Hen. VII. c. 4, makes this <HI>Tye between the two Kingdoms</HI> indissoluble. And we must ever own it our happiness to be thus annexed to England; and that the Kings and Queens of England are, by undoubted Right, <HI>ipso facto,</HI> Kings and Queens of Ireland. And from hence we may reasonably con∣clude, that, if any Acts of Parliament made in England should be of force in Ireland, before they are received there in Parliament, they should be more especially such Acts as relate to the <HI>Succession</HI> and <HI>Settlement of the Crown,</HI> and <HI>Recognition</HI> of the King's Title thereto, and the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Juris∣diction</HI> of the King. And yet we find, in the <HI>Irish</HI> Statutes, 28 Hen. VIII. c. 2, <HI>an Act for the Succes∣sion of the King and Queen Anne;</HI> and another, chap. 5, declaring the King to be <HI>supreme Head of the Church of Ireland;</HI> both which Acts had formerly passed in the Parliament of England. So likewise we find, amongst the Irish Statutes, <HI>Acts of Recognition of the King's Title to Ireland,</HI> in the reigns of Henry VIII. Queen Elizabeth, King James, King Charles II. King William and Queen Mary. By which it ap∣pears, that Ireland, though annexed to the Crown of England, has always been looked upon to be a <HI>kingdom complete within itself,</HI> and to have all Juris∣diction to an absolute Kingdom belonging, and subordinate to no legislative authority on Earth: Though, it is to be noted, these English Acts, re∣lating 
<PB N="106" REF="145"/>to the succession, and recognition of the King's Title, do particularly name Ireland.</Q></P>
<P>See also page 33, where the same author speaks of <Q><HI>Ireland's being annexed to,</HI> and, as it were, <HI>united with,</HI> the imperial Crown of England, by several Acts of Parliament, both in England and Ireland, since King John's time. But how far this operates, I shall enquire more fully hereafter; I shall only, at present, observe, that I conceive little more is effected, by these statutes, than that Ireland shall not be <HI>aliened</HI> or <HI>separated</HI> from the King of Eng∣land, who cannot hereby dispose of it otherwise than in <HI>legal succession</HI> along with England; and that whoever is <HI>King of England</HI> is, <HI>ipso fucto, King of Ireland,</HI> and the subjects of Ireland are obliged to obey him as their liege Lord.</Q></P>

<PB N="105" REF="144"/>afford the least shadow of Evidence for the latter part of his Assertion, <HI>viz.</HI> the Power of the <HI>English Parliament</HI> over
<PB N="106" REF="145"/><HI>Ireland.</HI> And, because Sir Richard Bol∣ton had allowed that such Laws, made in <HI>England,</HI> as are declaratory of the <HI>Common-Law,</HI> do bind <HI>Ireland</HI> without any confirmation there; (see <HI>Hibernica,</HI> p. 27, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) Serjeant Mayart hopes to avail himself of the circumstance, and observes thereupon, <Q>It must necessarily follow</Q> (says he, p. 76) <Q>that the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> hath still an in∣fluence upon <HI>Ireland,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And a
<PB N="107" REF="146"/>little farther he adds, <Q>But if it should happen</Q> (says he) <Q>that the Parlia∣ment of <HI>England</HI> should make an ex∣position of a Law in force in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Parliament there should make another, and that it may be different or contrary to that of <HI>England,</HI> certainly</Q> (says he) <Q><HI>Ireland</HI> must be bound (by the Author's own Rule,</Q> meaning Sir Richard Bolton) <Q>by the declaratory Statute of the Parliament of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But Sir Richard Bolton's Rule includes no such Doctrine. For there is nothing unreasonable in supposing that the Irish subjects, without prejudice to their natu∣ral Rights and the Privileges of their own Parliament, might receive <Q><HI>the declara∣tory Statute of the Parliament of Eng∣land</HI></Q> as the best Exposition of the Common-Law, which they <HI>before acknow∣ledged,</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="147"/>and <HI>freely accepted</HI> by <HI>their own express assent and desire.</HI> <NOTE N="(29)" PLACE="foot"><P>Sir Edward Coke himself bears ample testi∣mony to this. — "Our student must know," (says he,) <Q>that King John, in the 12th year of his reign, went into Ireland, and there, by the advice of grave and learned men in the Lawes, whom he car∣ried with him, BY PARLIAMENT, DE COMMUNI OMNIUM DE HYBERNIA CONSENSU, ordained and established, that <HI>Ireland</HI> should be governed by <HI>the Laws of England,</HI> which, of many of the <HI>Irish-men,</HI></Q> (for the <HI>common consent</HI> before mentioned must mean that of the <HI>English</HI> settlers) <Q><HI>according to their own desire, was joyfully accepted and obeyed,</HI> and of many the same was soon after absolutely refused, preferring their <HI>Brehen</HI> Law before the just and honourable Lawes of England. <BIBL>1st Inst. p. 141.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>But this subsequent refusal, and preference given to the <HI>Brehen Law,</HI> must not be charged to the <HI>native Irish</HI> in general; for Sir John Davis, in his <Q>Dis∣coverie of the true causes why Ireland was never en∣tirely subdued,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> demonstrates that the <HI>Eng∣lish Settlers</HI> were <HI>principally</HI> to be blamed for this. He shews, (p. 135,) that <Q>the scopes of land, which were graunted to the first adventurers, <HI>were too large,</HI> and the <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Royalties,</HI> which they obtained therein, <HI>were too great for subjects.</HI></Q> — And, in p. 144, <Q>that these <HI>Grants</HI> of whole provinces and petty kingdoms, those few English Lordes pre∣tended to be proprietors of all the land, so that there was no possibility left of <HI>settling the natives in
<PB N="109" REF="148"/>their possessions,</HI> and, by consequence, the conquest became impossible, without the <HI>utter extirpation of all the Irish;</HI> which these English Lordes were not able to doe, nor perhaps <HI>willing,</HI> if they had been able.</Q> This he afterwards explains, shewing that false notions of private interest, among the <HI>English</HI> Lords, prevented both the conquest, and the introduc∣tion of the English Law: They <Q>hoped to become Lords of those lands which were possessed by the Irish, whereunto they <HI>pretended title by their large Grants,</HI></Q> &amp;c. <BIBL>(p. 144,)</BIBL> and that therefore <Q>they per∣suaded the King of England (p. 145) that it was <HI>unfit to communicate the Lawes of England unto them;</HI> that it was the best policie to holde them as aliens and enemies, and to prosecute them <HI>with a continual warre.</HI> Hereby they obtained</Q> (says he) <Q>ano∣ther royal Prerogative and power; which was, to <HI>make Warre and Peace at their pleasure,</HI> in every part of the kingdom: which gave them an absolute com∣mand over the bodies, lands, and goods,</Q> (even) <Q>of the <HI>English</HI> Subjectes heere;</Q> meaning in Ire∣land, where he wrote. And he adds, in the same page, "And besides" (says he) <Q>the <HI>Irish</HI> inhabit∣ing the lauds fully conquered and reduced, being in <HI>condition of slaves</HI> and villaines, did <HI>render a greater profit and revennew,</HI> than if they had been made <HI>the King's free subjects.</HI> They also feared</Q> (as he de∣clares in the preceding page) <Q>that, if the Irish were
<PB N="110" REF="149"/>received into the King's protection, and made liege∣men and free-subjectes, <HI>the State of England</HI> woulde <HI>establish them</HI></Q> (or rather re-establish them) <Q><HI>in their possessions</HI> by Graunts from the Crown,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And "The <HI>troth is,</HI>" (says he, in p. 146,) <Q>that those great English Lords did, to the uttermost of their power, crosse and withstand the enfranchise∣ment of the Irish, for the causes before expressed.</Q>— And he rightly lays <Q>the fault upon the pride, covetousness, and ill-counsell of the <HI>English</HI> planted heer, <HI>which in all former ages</HI></Q> (says he) <Q>have bin the chief impediments of the final conquest of Ireland.</Q></P>
<P>On the other hand, he clearly exculpates the <HI>native Irish</HI> from the charge of <HI>wilfully</HI> refusing to be subject to the Laws of England. "But perhaps" (says he, in p. 115) <Q>the <HI>Irishry</HI> in former times did wilfully refuse to be subject to the Lawes of England, and would not be partakers of the benefit thereof, though the <HI>Crown of England</HI> did desire it; and therefore they were reputed Aliens, Out-lawes, and Enemies. ASSUREDLY THE CONTRARIE DOTH APPEARE, as wel by the Charters of Denization, purchased by the Irish IN ALL AGES, as by a petition preferred by them to the King, anno 2 Ed. III. desiring that an Act <HI>might passe in Ireland,</HI> whereby ALL THE IRISHRIE might be inabled to use and injoy the <HI>Lawes of England,</HI> without purchasing of <HI>particular Denizations.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="150"/>And, in p. 117, he adds: — <Q>I am well assured, that <HI>the Irishrie</HI> DID DESIRE <HI>to be</HI> admitted to the benefit of the Law, not only in this petition exhibi∣ted to King Edw. III. but <HI>by all their submissions</HI> made to King Richard II. and to the Lord Thomas of Lancaster, before the warres of the two Houses; and afterwards to the Lord Leonard Gray and Sir An∣thony St. Leger, when K. Henry VIII. began to reform this kingdom. In particular, the Birnes of of the Mountaines, in the 34th of Hen. VIII. de∣sire that their countrey might be made Shire ground, and called the County of Wicklow: And, in the 23d of Hen. VIII. O. Donnel doth covenant with Sir William Skeffington, <HI>Quod si Dominus Rex velit reformare Hiberniam,</HI></Q> (whereof, it should seem, he made some doubt,) <Q>that <HI>hee and his people would</HI> GLADLY <HI>bee governed by the Lawes of England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>These quotations sufficiently demonstrate the <HI>wil∣lingness</HI> of the native <HI>Irish</HI> to adopt the <HI>English</HI> Laws and Constitution, and that the denial of such a reason∣able desire was the just cause of their almost continual rebellions and bloody wars against the <HI>English</HI> Settlers. However, in the reign of King James I. <HI>the Irishry</HI> were restored to their just Rights, <Q>and the benefit and protection of the Law of England communica∣ted TO ALL, AS WELL IRISH AS ENGLISH, WITH∣OUT DISTINCTION OR RESPECT OF PERSONS,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <BIBL>(p. 264.)</BIBL> And Sir John Davies himself was one of the judges employed in that most grateful business
<PB N="112" REF="151"/>to a benevolent man; I mean the <Q><HI>Visitations of Jus∣tice, whereby the just and</HI> HONOURABLE LAW OF ENGLAND was imparted and communicated to <HI>all the Irishry.</HI> <BIBL>(P. 265.)</BIBL></Q> And he informs us, in the same page, that <Q><HI>the common people</HI> were taught, by the Justices of Assise, that <HI>they were</HI> FREE SUB∣JECTS <HI>to the Kings of England,</HI> and not Slaves and Vassals to their pretended Lords: That the <HI>Cut∣tings, Cosheries, Sessings,</HI> and other extortions of their Lords, were UNLAWFUL, and that they should not any more submit themselves thereunto, since they were now under the protection of so just and mighty a Prince, as both would and could protect them from al' wrongs and oppressions. They gave</Q> (says he) <Q>A WILLING EAR unto these lessons; and thereupon the greatnesse and power of those Irish Lords over the people sodainly fell and vanished, when their oppressions and extortions were taken away, which did maintain their greatness,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In p. 262, he informs us, that Sir Edmund Pelham and himself were <Q><HI>the first Justices of Assise that ever sat in those countries;</HI></Q> (speaking particularly of Ty∣rone and Tirconnell;) "and in that circuit" (says he) <Q>we visited all the shires of that province: be∣sides which, visitation, though it were somewhat distastfull to the Irish Lords, <HI>was sweet and most welcome to the common people;</HI> who, albeit they were rude and barbarous, yet did they <HI>quickly apprehend the difference</HI> betweene the tiranny and oppression
<PB N="113" REF="152"/>under which they lived before, and <HI>the just govern∣ment</HI> and protection which we promised unto them for the time to come.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the common people of <HI>the Irishry</HI> were at length restored to that equality, in the eye of the law, to which they were justly entitled (though shamefully deprived of it) from the earliest time that the English began to be known in that kingdom, even from the first establishment of the English Conquerors; for Sir John Davies shews, from Matthew Paris's History, that <Q>King Henry II. <HI>before his return out of Ire∣land,</HI> held a Counsell, or Parliament, at <HI>Lissemore,</HI> where the Laws of England were, <HI>by all, willingly received;</HI> ubi leges Angliae AB OMNIBUS <HI>sunt gra∣tanter receptae,</HI> et juratoria cautione praestita confir∣matae: <BIBL>p. 100.</BIBL></Q> And he informs us, in the next page, that <Q>King Henrie the Third did graunt and transmit the <HI>like Charter of Liberties to his subjects of Ireland,</HI> as himself and his Father had graunted to <HI>the Subjects of England,</HI> as appeareth</Q> (says he) <Q>by another Record in the Tower, 1 Hen. III. Pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m. 13.</Q> And he cites also a writ of the 12th year of the same King, commanding the Lord Justice of Ireland to cause <HI>the Charter of King John</HI> to be read and confirmed by Parliament; and again, that <Q>the same King, by Letters Patent under the Great-Seal of England, <HI>did confirme the establishment</HI> of the <HI>Eng∣lish Laws</HI> made by King John,</Q> and that all Writs of <HI>the Common Law</HI> should have course there as in Eng∣land
<PB N="114" REF="153"/>— <Q><HI>Quod</HI> OMNIA BREVIA <HI>de</HI> COMMUNI JURE, <HI>quae currunt in Anglia, similiter currant in Hibernia,</HI></Q> &amp;c. Thus it appears, that all <HI>Irish</HI> Subjects, without distinction, are entitled, according to the clearest and most unquestionable testimony, to all the Rights, Immunities, and Advantages, of <HI>Magna Charta</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> Common Law.</P>
<PB N="108" REF="147"/></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="148"/>But let us suppose that, in some such declaratory Act, they had reason to think
<PB N="110" REF="149"/>the English Exposition improper, and should therefore choose to confirm their
<PB N="111" REF="150"/><HI>own sense</HI> of it by the Authority of their <HI>own Parliament,</HI> surely the latter would
<PB N="112" REF="151"/>be binding in Ireland, and <HI>not the English Statute,</HI> as Serjeant Mayart supposes;
<PB N="113" REF="152"/>for there is no example of an <HI>Irish</HI> Act of Parliament being set aside by the Autho∣rity
<PB N="114" REF="153"/>of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, which Serjeant Mayart allows: <Q>Neither is it to be imagined" (says he in p. 199) that the Kings and Parliaments in Eng∣land will ever <HI>avoid any Laws made in Ireland</HI> without a good and just cause, <HI>since they have not done any such things for about four hundred years,</HI> which is time enough to have experience of their honour and justice,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And he afterwards uses this plea con∣cerning the Honour and Justice of the English Parliament, as an inducement for the Irish to be bound by it; "and seeing" (says he in p. 191) <Q>that, for above 400 years, they have never done hurt to Ireland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> therefore we may <HI>well
<PB N="115" REF="154"/>trust them</HI> hereafter,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And again, in p. 192, "But we all know" (says he) <Q>with <HI>what great consultation, delibera∣tion, and knowledge of things, and the circumstances of them, the Kings and Parliaments of England</HI> have still or∣dered their affairs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And we may,</Q> (says he,) <Q>as all our ancestors have done, <HI>trust to their wisdom, justice, and judgement,</HI> as a <HI>sufficient hedge</HI> and secu∣rity for us.</Q> But, surely, no People, who have the use of reason or common∣sense, would be induced by <HI>such an argu∣ment</HI> to submit themselves implicitly to a Parliament, in which they have no Share of Power or <HI>Representation;</HI> though, in∣deed, it may be alleged, in behalf of this writer and his argument, that Par∣liaments, before his time, were, <HI>in gene∣ral,</HI> less corrupt than they have been since, if we except the Parliaments of Richard II. and Queen Mary; but, in these latter times, <Q><HI>we all know with
<PB N="116" REF="155"/>what great consultation, deliberation, and knowledge of things, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If it had been possible for the <HI>Irish</HI> Subjects to have given up to Serjeant Mayart this contested point, concerning the necessity of <HI>a due Representation in the Legislature,</HI> without giving up, at the same time, <HI>all due Limitation of Go∣vernment,</HI> and consequently <HI>all preten∣sions to their natural Freedom,</HI> this advice of his might have been esteemed excu∣sable!</P>
<P>But it is <HI>Representation alone</HI> which forms the Basis, the superiority, and the essential difference, of the <HI>English</HI> Con∣stitution of State, from all others! For, in countries where <HI>this is wanting,</HI> or where it is become <HI>totally corrupted,</HI> it makes but little difference, to the bulk of the people, whether the executive part of government be in the hands of one, of a few, or of many; <HI>viz.</HI> of an
<PB N="117" REF="156"/>Emperor, of a Triumvirate, or of a Se∣nate of Nobles or proud Patricians, (as among the Romans, at different periods of time). The administration of each of these orders of power, respectively, is almost equally arbitrary, uncertain, and dangerous to the community; to which the Histories of all monarchical as well as aristocratical Governments (I mean those that are merely or too nearly such) bear sufficient testimony: so that <HI>the Re∣presentation of the people</HI> is the grand point of distinction, the fundamental principle, whereby the equity and safety of the <HI>English</HI> Government is to be mea∣sured, when we compare it with such Governments as either that of France, or that of Poland.</P>
<P>I have already given some specimens of <HI>French</HI> Government and <HI>French</HI> Law in my Preface, it being necessary that <HI>British</HI> Subjects should be well aware of
<PB N="118" REF="157"/>the Nature and Tendency of that Law which has so lately received the solemn Sanction even of our own Legislature,<NOTE N="(30)" PLACE="foot"><P>The late Act for establishing the Laws of <HI>France</HI> in the most extensive Province of the <HI>British</HI> Empire must indeed seem very strange and unna∣tural to the genius of <HI>Englishmen</HI> in general; especi∣ally when we consider that even the <HI>French</HI> Inhabi∣tants of that Province themselves are zealous for the <HI>"Privileges of English Subjects;"</HI> which plainly ap∣pears by some Expressions in their late Address to the Governor on that occasion: and we may, therefore, rest assured that they are not, in general, so ignorant, and void of common-sense, as really to prefer the Laws of <HI>France</HI> to the <HI>equitable</HI> Constitution of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> howsoever they may have been misrepresented. We must, nevertheless, except a few French Seigneurs, who, having already been allowed <HI>greater exclusive Pri∣vileges</HI> than are consistent with the safety and freedom of their poor neighhours and fellow-subjects, would rather wish to promote the <HI>French</HI> Laws and Customs (which permit such an unjust Vassalage) than the equi∣table Laws of <HI>England:</HI> and we may likewise except the Priests, and some other absolute Bigots to the Ro∣mish Religion, who, being entangled in <HI>the Slavery of antichristian Principles</HI> and <HI>"the Doctrines of Devils,"</HI> are ready to submit to any <HI>temporal</HI> conditions whatso∣ever for the sake of that <HI>spiritual,</HI> or rather <HI>Satanical,</HI> Bribe, which was wickedly thrown out to them on this occasion: I mean the setting up their <HI>adultecated</HI> Re∣ligion as the <HI>established Church of that Province</HI> (with a legal Right to collect Tythes, <HI>&amp;c.) by national authori∣ty.</HI> This was the more unjust and inexcusable, because the Romanists had no reason to complain of that Tole∣ration which they so freely enjoyed before. In a note on p. 125, where I have occasion to mention the de∣fects of some <HI>supposed</HI> Statutes, I have added some ex∣amples (which naturally occurred thereupon) concern∣ing the abominable Tyranny and Wickedness of the <HI>adulterous</HI> Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> and these, I trust, will sufficiently justify the severity of my expressions against that <HI>antichristian</HI> Church.

<P><PB N="122" REF="161"/>Mr. Barrington is commenting on the Ordinance of 17 Edw.

<PB N="123" REF="162"/>as by <HI>Poining's Law,</HI> in the time of Henry the Seventh, all PRECEDENT<NOTE N="(34)" PLACE="foot"><P>Here the Hon.

<PB N="124" REF="163"/>essential,</HI> cannot be known, in a <HI>legal</HI> manner, but by the voice of <HI>their own</HI> parliamentary <HI>Representatives;</HI> so that the very reason why all <HI>English</HI> Statutes <HI>"extend to Wales, whether named or not"</HI> forbids the application of the like Doc∣trine to <HI>Ireland:</HI> and, as the opinion of the Judges, in the 19th of Hen.

<P>The Hon. Mr. Justice Barrington also observes, in p. 145, that <Q>there have

Sir Edward Coke, in his 4th inst. p. 
<PB N="128" REF="167"/>51, gives several instances of sup∣posed Statutes that had been repealed or disaffirmed, (wanting the Assent of the Commons,) which were ne∣vertheless published and enforced as real Statutes; <HI>viz.</HI> 5 R.

Also 2 Hen.

<P>Sir Edward Coke, in his 3d Inst.

<PB N="128" REF="167"/></NOTE>, who at that time was Lord-Chancellor:
<PB N="129" REF="168"/>And the same learned author thereupon directs us to <Q><HI>mark well the manner of the penning the Act:</HI> for, see∣ing</Q> (says he) <Q>the Commons did not assent there∣unto, the words of the Act be, <HI>It is ordained and assented in this present Parliament, that,</HI> &amp;c. And so it was, being but by the King and the Lords.</Q></P>
<P>The same rule enables us to judge concerning the authenticity of many other ancient Acts, wherein the <HI>Assent of the Commons</HI> is not particularly mentioned, and yet they are published. The constitutions called <HI>Sta∣tutum de Bigamis,</HI> for instance, are declared <HI>to have been "set forth in the Parliament</HI> after Michaelmas," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>Editae fuerunt apud Westm. in parliamento post festum sancti Michaelis,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <BIBL>(Mag.

He remarks, that <Q>these words in the 1st chapter (concordatum est per justiciarios et 
<PB N="130" REF="169"/>alios sapientes <HI>de Concilio Regni</HI>) prove it to be by Authority of Parliament; for <HI>Concilium Regni,</HI></Q> (says he) <Q><HI>is the Lords and Commons,</HI> LEGALLY CALLED COMMUNE CONCILIUM REGNI. <BIBL>2d Inst. p. 267.</BIBL></Q> But, even according to this argument, the word "COMMUNE" is apparently wanting, to make up what he himself allows to be the LEGAL expression for THE LORDS AND COMMONS; and, if we duly consider the words which immediately follow, it must appear, that the <HI>"sapientes de Concilio Regni,"</HI> &amp;c. here mentioned, were only such particular <HI>sapientes</HI> as held <HI>judicial places,</HI> (<Q>qui consuetudines et <HI>usum judiciorum</HI> hactenus habu∣erunt</Q>); so that the expression cannot, with propri∣ety, be supposed to include the <HI>whole representative Body of the Commons,</HI> as well as the Lords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but merely <HI>the Judges,</HI> and such Lords, Prelates, and others, as held <HI>judicial places,</HI> and were of the <HI>King's Council,</HI> mentioned in the preamble, <HI>viz.</HI> In praesentia, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> quorundam episcoporum Angliae, et <HI>aliorum, de Concilio Regis,</HI> which Sir Edward Coke (by what au∣thority I cannot guess) is pleased to call a <Q><HI>Committee of both Houses,</HI></Q> though it can mean nothing more than a meeting of the <HI>King's Privy-Council;</HI> and the same may be said of that second meeting, afterwards mentioned, <HI>"coram Domino Rege et Concilio suo,"</HI> where∣in the said Constitutions were again read <HI>(auditae et pub∣licatae)</HI> and <HI>ordered to be ingrossed and observed;</HI> <Q>quod in scripturam redigerentur ad perpetuam memoriam, et <HI>quod firmiter observentur:</HI></Q> which (be pleased to remark) is the principal <HI>enacting</HI> or <HI>enforcing clause</HI> of
<PB N="131" REF="170"/>this Act: And, therefore, when we consider that the same was <HI>agreed to,</HI> or <HI>ordained,</HI> by THE JUDGES <HI>as well as others,</HI> (<Q>tam <HI>Justiciarii</HI> quam alii concordaverunt quod in scripturam,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) we may be assured that the meeting was <HI>not the Parliament,</HI> (in which the <HI>Judges,</HI> as such, have not any vote or voice at all, ex∣cept that of <HI>advising,</HI>) but merely the <HI>King's Privy-Council:</HI> and therefore Judge <HI>Shard,</HI> as cited by Lord Coke, had, surely, reason on his side, when he, <HI>"beholding the manner of the penning of this Act,"</HI> (com∣pare this with Lord Coke's own Rule, to the same purpose, abovementioned,) <Q><HI>was of opinion that it was no Act of Parliament.</HI></Q> though Sir Edward Coke was pleased to censure him, saying, that <Q>the contrary is holden by many express Authorities, both before and after him. <BIBL>(2d Inst. p. 267.)</BIBL></Q> But what Au∣thorities can be equal to the <HI>internal evidence</HI> of the Act itself, according to his own rule, <Q><HI>Mark well the man∣ner of the penning P</HI> &amp;c.</Q> For, though it may have been allowed the force of an Act, in judicial proceed∣ings, as well as in the writings of some respectable commentators, yet this is nothing but the natural con∣sequence of its having been published and printed, without remarks, among the other Acts,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The <HI>undue Authority,</HI> acquired by such impositions, was still more notorious, in the credit that has been given, even by the Legislature itself; to the three other <HI>false</HI> Statutes before-mentioned against (what the Papists-call) Heresy: Two of them are expressly recited, and for∣mally

<P>Another objection against this <HI>supposed</HI> Statute is the apparent evil intention of the 5th Article, <Q><HI>de Bi∣gamis,</HI></Q> (from whence it has acquired its title,) which was, to acknowledge a <HI>foreign</HI> popish Law, as if it were already (without interposition of Parlia∣ment) of legal <HI>force</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and needed only some small explanation, with respect to the manner of put∣ting it in execution; an idea this, which all <HI>free</HI> Eng∣lish Parliaments, even in <HI>popish times,</HI> most zealously opposed! But, above all, the <HI>Iniquity</HI> of the <HI>foreign Decree itself,</HI> which is introduced by this 5th Article, affords the most ample argument against the <HI>whole Sta∣tute,</HI> as it seems to have been drawn up principally for purpose of enforcing, and smuggling in, amongst o∣ther

However, the learned Commentator himself very justly observes, in a preceding page, (150,) con∣cerning "the manner and time of assembling" that the <Q>Parliament is regularly to be summoned by the King's <HI>Writ</HI> or Letter, issued out of Chancery.</Q> And it is well known that these Writs are not addressed to the knights, citizens, and burgesses, elected for any <HI>for∣mer</HI> Parliament, but to <HI>the Sheriffs alone,</HI> to cause <HI>Kinghts, Citizens, &amp;c. to be elected;</HI> for, when the said Acts were made, such an absurdity in politics had never been conceived in England, as that of entrusting the <HI>Repre∣sentation</HI> of the people, for <HI>a term of years,</HI> (as at pre∣sent,) to the persons elected! On the contrary, when the business of each Sessions was finished, the Parlia∣ment, of course, was at an end; and therefore Lord Coke did not speak in vain, when he mentioned <HI>"the 
<PB N="162" REF="201"/>excellent Law"</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> the Act for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments) <HI>"being applied to the said Writs of Parliament,"</HI> &amp;c. be∣fore recited.</P>
<P>A man of so much good-sense, learning, and judge∣ment, as Sir William Blackstone is master of, must be well aware of the pernicious effects of investing the Representatives of the people with a legislative power, beyond the constitutional term of A SINGLE SESSION, without <HI>Re-election;</HI> and therefore I cannot but be sur∣prized at the unguarded manner in which he has ex∣pressed himself in his Comment on the two <HI>excellent Statutes</HI> of Edward III. for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments; <HI>viz.</HI> that the King is not,<Q>or ever was, obliged by these Statutes to call a <HI>new</HI> Parliament every year,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He has caused the word <HI>new</HI> to be printed in <HI>Italies,</HI> as if he meant thereby to insinuate, that the Legislatures of those early times were not unacquainted with our modern idea of conferring on the popular Representa∣tives a kind of <HI>continued senatorial dignity,</HI> without <HI>Re-election,</HI> for several years together; whereas he certainly must have known that this corrupt <HI>modorn</HI> practice has produced a <HI>new order</HI> of men amongst us a most dangerous increase of aristocratical power, which was entirely unknown to our Ancestors in the glorious reign of Edward III. If he could shew that there <HI>ever</HI> was a Parliament, in those times, that was <HI>not a</HI> NEW <HI>Parliament,</HI> his Comment might be justi∣fied! But it is notorious that Writs were issued to the Sheriffs, for <HI>new</HI> Elections, almost <HI>every year</HI> du∣ring that whole reign: The Writs, for the most part, 
<PB N="163" REF="202"/>are still preserved with the Returns upon them. In the catalogue of Election-Writs, which Prynn has given in his <HI>Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,</HI> p. 4 to 6, there is an account of Writs issued for <HI>new</HI> Elections in every year of that King's reign, between his 34th (when the last Act for annual Parliaments was made) and his 50th year, except 3, <HI>viz.</HI> the 40th, 41st, and 48th years; in which years the Records of Summons to the Prelates and Lords of Parliament are also want∣ing, as appears by Sir William Dugdale's <Q>perfect Co∣py of Summons to Parliament, of the Nobility,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And yet this affords no absolute proof that Parliaments were not held <HI>in those very years</HI> for which the Writs are wanting; because the bundles of Writs for the said years may have been lost or mislaid. The only wonder is, that more have not been absolutely lost, when we consider the very little care that had been taken of them; for Prynne found many of these Writs dispersed amongst a vast miscellaneous heap of other records on various subjects, (as he himself relates in his Epistle-Dedicatory to King Charles II. of his <HI>Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,</HI>) calling the said heap a <Q><HI>confused Chaos,</HI> under cor∣roding, putrifying cobwebs, dust, and filth, in the darkest corner of Caesar's Chapel in the White Tower, as <HI>mere useless Reliques not worthy to be calendred,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And, in page 103 of that same work, he speaks of 117 Bundles of Writs, whereof 97 had only been then <HI>lately</HI> discovered, filed, and bundled, by himself: "But many of these 117 Bundles" (says he) <Q>are 
<PB N="164" REF="203"/><HI>not compleat,</HI> above half or three parts of the Writs being either rotted, consumed, maymed, torn, or <HI>utterly lost,</HI> through carelessness, wet, cankers, or other casualties; and some of them have not above two, three, or four Writs, and one or two but one Writ and Retorn remaining.</Q></P>
<P>But that there were really Writs for Parliaments, even in those <HI>three</HI> years, which appear to be wanting, at least in <HI>two</HI> of them, is very certain; because it was in the 40th year of this reign, as Sir Edward Coke informs us, (4 Inst. p. 13,) that the Pope demanded homage for the kingdoms of England and Ireland, and the arrears of revenue granted by King John to Pope Innocent III. <Q>whereupon the King, in the <HI>same year, calleth his Court of Parliament,</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In this Parliament it was unanimously agreed, by the Prelates, Dukes, Counts, Barons, and the <HI>Commons,</HI> ("et <HI>la Common,</HI>" and again, <HI>"at Communes,"</HI>) <Q>that the said King John, nor no other, could put himself, nor his Realm, nor his People, in such Subjec∣tion, without <HI>their Assent,</HI> ('sans assent de eux;') and, if it was done, it was done without their Assent,</Q> (that is, without the Assent of the <HI>Commons,</HI> for the Assent of the Barons was expressed in the Charter,) "and contrary to his Oath at his Coronation" P. 14. Whereupon Lord Coke remarks, in the margin, that <Q>no King can put himself, nor his Rea'm, nor his People, in such Subjection, without Assent of the <HI>Lords and Commons in Parliament,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></NOTE> &amp;c. as Sir Edward Coke proves from the Parliament-Rolls of that year, N<SUP>o</SUP>. 8, remarking, at the same time, that the Act then made was "never yet printed." See the margin, 4th Inst. p. 13.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="204"/>And it appears that a Parliament was held also in the 48th year of this reign, because supplies were in that year granted to the King by Parliament, as re∣lated by Sir Richard Baker, in his Chronicle, p. 173, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>in his eight and fortieth year,</HI> IN A PARLIA∣MENT, is granted him a 10th of the Clergy, and a 15th of the Laity.</Q> So that there is but <HI>one</HI> year, out of so many, in which we cannot trace the meeting of the annual Parliaments: And annual Writs for <HI>new</HI> Elections were regularly issued for the first 18 years of the following reign, (as appears by Prynn's <Q>2d part of a brief Register and Survey of the several kinds and forms of parliamentary Writs,</Q> pages 116 and 117,) till Richard II. (that wretched perjured monarch) had rendered himself <HI>absolute.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>His arbitrary proceedings very soon afterwards occasioned his own loss of Power, and total Ejectment from the Throne; so that, notwith∣standing his boasted <HI>Firmness</HI> in executing his favourite Measures, he was at last reduced to the most abject acknowledgements of his own unworthiness to reign.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>After considering these unquestionable evidences of the issuing Writs <HI>annually</HI> for <HI>new</HI> Elections, it will be difficult to comprehend the meaning of Sir William Blackstone's Comment on the said two Acts for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments: <Q>Not that he (the King) is, or ever was, obliged by these Statutes to call a <HI>new</HI> Parlia∣ment every year; but only to permit a Parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances and dispatch of business, <HI>if need be.</HI> — These last words</Q> 
<PB N="166" REF="205"/>(says he) <Q>are so <HI>loose and vague,</HI> that such of our mo∣narchs as were enclined to govern without Parlia∣ments, neglected the convoking them, sometimes for a very considerable period, under pretence that there <HI>was no need of them,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But <HI>"these last words"</HI> are not <HI>so loose and vague</HI> as ei∣ther to justify his own explanation of the said Statutes, (<HI>viz.</HI> not <Q>to call a <HI>new</HI> Parliament every year, but only to <HI>permit</HI> a Parliament to sit,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) or to excuse, in the least degree, the criminal neglects of those depraved monarchs who were inclined to govern without them: for the words, <HI>"if need be,"</HI> cannot, according to the most obvious sense of the Act wherein they are found, be applied to the main purpose of the Act, (the holding <HI>annual Parliaments,</HI>) but merely to the remaining part of the sentence, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>and more often:</HI></Q> that is, "and more often, if need be." The Order, <Q><HI>that a Parliament shall be holden</HI> EVERY YEAR ONCE,</Q> is absolute, and the discretionary power, expressed in the words <HI>"if need be,"</HI> relates apparently to the calling Parliaments <HI>"more often:"</HI> for, if the said discretionary words, <HI>"if need be,"</HI> could, with any propriety, be applied to the whole sentence, the Act itself would have been nugatory; which could never be the <HI>intention</HI> of the Legislature: but the true meaning and sense of the Legislature is very clearly proved by the histories of those times: for it is manifest, not only that <HI>new</HI> Representatives were elected <HI>every year</HI> (with only one exception) for 
<PB N="167" REF="206"/>a considerable number of years after the last of the said Acts was made, (which confirms the main purpose of the Acts, <HI>viz.</HI> the holding <HI>annual Parliaments,</HI>) but it is also manifest, that Parliaments were frequently held <HI>"more often"</HI> than once a year;<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Writs were issued for electing 3 <HI>new</HI> Parliaments in the 6th year of Edw. III. 2 in his 11th year, 3 in his 12th year, and even 4 in his 14th year; and there appear to have been 2 <HI>new</HI> Parliaments in the 7th of R. II. See <HI>Prynne's Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,</HI> p. 5 &amp; 6.</P></NOTE> which amply confirms also what I have before said, concerning the meaning of the discretionary power, expressed in the said Act, by the words <HI>"if need be."</HI></P>
<P>These very frequent Elections (sometimes two, three, and four, times IN ONE YEAR) sufficient∣ly prove that the power, delegated by the people to their Representatives, continued no longer in force than during the Session of the particular Parliament to which they were summoned; which being <HI>"once determined,"</HI> (says Prynne, 1st part of Brief Register, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Parl. Writs, p. 334.) <Q><HI>they presently ceased to be Knights, Ci∣tizens, Burgesses, Barons, in any succeeding Parlia∣ments or Councils, unless newly elected and retorned to serve in them, by the King's</HI> NEW <HI>Writs, as our Law-Books</HI></Q> (referring to 4 Ed. IV. <HI>f.</HI> 44. Brook, Offi∣cer, 25. 34 Hen. VIII, c. 24.) <Q><HI>and experience re∣solve,</HI></Q> &amp;c. And therefore Judge Blackstone's insi∣nuation, against the calling of a <HI>new</HI> Parliament, has no real foundation: for, if it was the intention of the 
<PB N="168" REF="207"/>Legislature, in the two Acts abovementioned, that the King should ever summon <HI>any Parliament at all,</HI> they must necessarily be understood to mean a <HI>new</HI> Parlia∣ment on all occasions; <HI>i. e.</HI> not only that the regular Par∣liaments, which they ordained <Q><HI>to be</HI> holden every <HI>year once,</HI></Q> should be <HI>new</HI> Parliaments, but those also that should be summoned upon any extraordinary unfore∣seen occasions; which is sufficiently expressed in the 1st of the said Acts, by the words, <Q><HI>and more often, if need be.</HI></Q> The meaning of the Act is <HI>unquestion∣ably</HI> proved by the actual issuing of writs, to the She∣riffs, for electing Knights, Citizens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for <HI>two, three,</HI> and sometimes <HI>four new</HI> Parliaments, <HI>in one year,</HI> as mentioned above: And if any person should object, that such <HI>very frequent Elections</HI> must be at∣tended with insuperable difficulties and inconveniences, we may quote the experience of all ancient times, as affording ample and sufficient proofs to the contrary; <Q>there being not above two or three cases of elections questioned, or complained of, from 49 Hen. III. till 22 Edw. IV.</Q> (that is, more than 200 years.) <Q>for ought that appears by the Retornes or Parlia∣ment-Rolls, and NOT SO MUCH AS ONE DOUBLE RETORNE OR INDENTURE, wherewith all the <HI>late</HI> Bundles; or Writs, are stored, and the House of Commons and <HI>late</HI> Committees of Privileges pes∣tered, perplexed, to the <HI>great retarding</HI> of the more weighty public affairs of the King and King∣dom. <BIBL>Prynne, Brevia Parl.

<PB N="169" REF="208"/>enormous evil, the retardment of business, by undue Returns, will not (I may venture, without the spirit of prophecy, to assert) be remedied by the <HI>new Regu∣lation</HI> for that purpose.

If my countrymen will seriously consider all these points, they must be convinced that the only sure method of healing the alarming distempers of our po∣litical Constitution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Viz.</HI> the enormous national Debt; the numerous Pensions; the secret parliamentary Influence; a standing Army of near 100 Bat∣talions of Foot, besides Caval<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, in time of Peace I <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> which must render the <HI>Estates</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> of individuals precarious and insecure, or finally EAT THEM UP with <HI>growing burtbens,</HI> if these fatal symptoms of the most dangerous <HI>political consumption</HI> are not speedily checked and thrown off, by the wholesome prescriptions of <HI>a free and equal Representation of</HI> THE PEOPLE.</P></NOTE> is to restore to the people their ancient and just Right to elect a <HI>new</HI> Parliament, "<HI>every year once,</HI> and <HI>more often if need be,</HI>" what∣soever Judge Blackstone may think of it!</P>
<P>No Parliament could have any right to deprive the people of this inestimable Law, unless the Representa∣tives had expressly consulted their respective consti∣tuents upon it; as the alteration was of too much mo∣ment to be intrusted to the discretion of any <HI>Repre∣sentatives</HI> or <HI>Deputies</HI> whatsoever, being infinitely more important than <Q><HI>any new devi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> moved on the King's

<P>I have dwelt much longer upon these <HI>three Precedents</HI> (cited by the Honour∣able Mr. Barrington) <HI>against Ireland,</HI> than I at first intended; but the several diffe∣rent subjects, to which I was naturally
<PB N="173" REF="212"/>led in the examination of them, are of so much constitutional importance, and so necessary to be known to every English∣man, that I hope I may be excused for having, as they occurred, enlarged upon them, in the several Notes which I have added to my Text.</P>
<P>And, with respect to the <HI>three Prece∣dents</HI> themselves, I flatter myself that every impartial Reader, who carefully considers what has been already said upon them, will freely pronounce them <HI>illegal,</HI> and totally unworthy of being allowed the least weight or consideration, as <HI>Pre∣cedents,</HI> against the <HI>Independence</HI> of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> since they are equally capable of being retorted <HI>as Precedents</HI> for enslaving even <HI>England itself:</HI> but I must therefore repeat what I have before declared, in p. 141 and elsewhere, that I am very sure the worthy Writer, who unguard∣edly cited them, will be as zealous to
<PB N="174" REF="213"/>oppose any such doctrine as myself; and I believe that I may farther assure myself, that this learned Author will not be dis∣pleased or offended with the freedom of these remarks upon his Work; for, though I have not the honour to be per∣sonally acquainted with him, yet I am sufficiently acquainted (by other parts of his Writings) with the general benevo∣lence and rectitude of his intentions, and also that he is an admirer and fast friend to our <HI>constitutional Liberty</HI> (which plain∣ly appears in many other parts of his use∣ful Work) as well as myself; so that any corrections, <HI>on that side of the question,</HI> will be taken (I dare say) by him as they were meant by me, that is, in good part, and without the least ill will: and his Work (I speak of it in general) has very deservedly acquired so much esteem and credit in the world, that I could not, without great injustice to the subject be∣fore me, permit any arguments therein,
<PB N="175" REF="214"/>upon the point in question, to remain unanswered.</P>
<P>The same observation, I am inclined to think, is equally applicable, as well to the candour and disposition, as to the writings, of Sir William Blackstone, whose very learned and useful Commen∣taries must also be strictly examined, upon this point, before I conclude my Declaration: and, had the other great and eminent writers (Lord Coke, Lord Chief Justice Vaughan, Judge Jenkins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) whose opinions, upon the present subject, I am obliged also to call in ques∣tion, been still alive, I should have thought myself equally sure of their be∣nevolence and forgiveness, if I except Serjeant Mayart; because the undeserved contempt, with which he has treated Sir Richard Bolton, (the learned Author whom he attempted to answer,) prevents
<PB N="176" REF="215"/>my entertaining so charitable and friend∣ly an opinion of him as I do of the rest.</P>
<P>Though I have now drawn these re∣marks concerning the Constitution of <HI>Ireland</HI> to a much greater length than I at first proposed, yet I must not conclude whilst any material assertions of great authority remain unanswered. Several of Sir Edward Coke's objections, on this head, have already, towards the begin∣ning of this 2d part, been proved (I hope) to want <HI>foundation:</HI> but there still remains to be considered a further doctrine, on the same point, advanced by him in <HI>Calvin's Case,</HI> which, I trust, will appear to be <HI>equally unjust,</HI> though <HI>founded</HI> on the opinion of <Q><HI>all the Judges in England!</HI></Q></P>
<P>"In Anno 33 Reg. El." (says he) <Q>it was resolved, by <HI>all the Judges in En∣gland,</HI> in the case of Orurke, <HI>an Irish∣man,</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="216"/>who had committed. High Treason <HI>in Ireland,</HI> that he, by the Stat. of 33 Hen. VIII. c. 23. might be indicted, arraigned, and tried, for the same, <HI>in England,</HI> according to the purview of the Statute. <BIBL>7 Co. 448.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>But this doctrine, notwithstanding the great authority with which it is here deli∣vered, is obnoxious to a <HI>fundamental Right of the Subject,</HI> the <Q><HI>Trial by a Jury of the</HI> VICINAGE,</Q> or of <Q><HI>Neighbours to the Fact,</HI></Q> which is due to every private person in the British Dominions, according to the ancient Laws and Cus∣toms of this realm; otherwise the govern∣ment would cease to be <HI>limited,</HI> and thereby would cease to be <HI>lawful!</HI> So that if Sir Edward Coke had been as much upon his guard, when he quoted this (<HI>"Resolution of all the Judges,"</HI> as he was when he made his Remarks on that wicked Act of Parliament, in the reign
<PB N="178" REF="217"/>of K. Hen. VII. by which also the <HI>fun∣damental Right of Trial by Juries</HI> was violated, he would neither have mentioned that Resolution of "all the Judges," or even the Act itself, without guarding against the pernicious effects of such an unconstitutional doctrine, by a proper censure, as he did in the former case.</P>
<P>"It is not almost credible to foresee" (says he) <Q>when any when any <HI>maxim</HI> or <HI>funda∣mental Law</HI> of this realm <HI>is altered,</HI> (as elsewhere hath been observed,) what <HI>dangerous inconveniences</HI> do fol∣low; which most expresely appeareth by this <HI>most unjust and strange</HI> Act of 11 Hen. VII. for hereby not only <HI>Empson</HI> and <HI>Dudley</HI> themselves, but such justices of peace,</Q> (corrupt men,) <Q>as they caused to be authorized, com∣mitted most <HI>grievous</HI> and <HI>heavy oppres∣sions</HI> and <HI>exactions,</HI> grinding of the face of the poor subjects by penal laws,</Q>
<PB N="179" REF="218"/>(be they never so obsolete or unfit for the time,) <Q>by <HI>information only,</HI> without any presentment or <HI>Trial by Jury,</HI> being the antient <HI>Birthright of the Subject,</HI> but to hear and determine the same <HI>by their discretion,</HI> inflicting such pe∣nalty as <HI>the Statutes not repealed imposed,</HI> &amp;c. <BIBL>4th Inst. c. 1. p. 41.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And afterwards he adds: <Q>This Statute of 11 H. VII. we have recited, and shewed <HI>the just inconvenience there∣of,</HI> to the end, <HI>that the like</HI> should never hereafter be attempted <HI>in any Court of Parliament.</HI> And that others might avoid THE FEARFUL END OF THESE TWO TIME-SERVERS, <HI>Empson</HI> and <HI>Dudley.</HI> Qui eorum ves∣tigia insistunt, eorum exitus perhorres∣cant. <BIBL>(ibid.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>But, though these two wretched Judges were <HI>hanged</HI> for their <HI>time-serving,</HI> yet
<PB N="180" REF="219"/>it appears, by this account of Lord Coke, that, when they presumed to dispense with the interposition of <HI>Juries,</HI> they acted by the <HI>express Authority</HI> of a <HI>Statute,</HI> or <HI>Act of Parliament;</HI> and, though they were <HI>Time-servers,</HI> so far as to acquiesce (contrary <HI>to their Duty, as Judges</HI>) in enforcing that wicked and unconstitu∣tional Statute, (which exceeded the due bounds to which the English Legislature is necessarily <HI>limited,</HI>) yet, it seems, they <HI>adjudged no penalties,</HI> in consequence thereof, but such as <Q><HI>the Statutes, not repealed, imposed.</HI></Q> And it is plain, therefore, that the crime of those two Judges (against which Lord Coke men∣tioned <Q>the FEARFUL END <HI>of those two time-servers,</HI></Q> <HI>as a warning to all future</HI> JUDGES) consisted in allowing <HI>the force of Law</HI> to a wicked unconstitu∣tional <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> by which <Q><HI>a</HI> FUNDAMENTAL LAW <HI>of this realm</HI></Q> (was) <HI>"altered;"</HI> so that their <HI>crime</HI> was
<PB N="181" REF="220"/>exactly parallel to the (equally <HI>criminal</HI>) resolution of <HI>"all the Judges in England,"</HI> in the case of <HI>Orurke</HI> the <HI>Irishman,</HI> he∣forementioned, (which was, in like manner, founded on an express Act of Parliament, <HI>viz.</HI> 33 Hen.

VIII. had been so general as to include all places whatever, <Q>out of the REALM <HI>of Eng∣land,</HI></Q>
<PB N="182" REF="221"/>without leaving room for plead∣ing a <HI>legal</HI> exception, in behalf of those territories wherein the laws, liberties, and constitution, of the Realm of Eng∣land were already established, the said Judges ought to have known that <Q><HI>a fun∣damental Law of this Realm</HI></Q> was there∣by <HI>"altered,"</HI> and consequently that they incurred the risk of being HANGED, by some future administration, (like their <HI>time-serving</HI> predecessors,) for <HI>presuming</HI> to enforce such <HI>unconstitutional Acts of Parliament,</HI> by which, (according to the <HI>just</HI> Remark of the <HI>same</HI> great Reporter on a former Act, <HI>viz.</HI> 11 H. 7.) <Q><HI>a fun∣damental Law of the Realm</HI> (was) <HI>altered;</HI></Q> whereas, they really might have attributed a constitutional meaning to the said Acts, by duly distinguishing those<NOTE N="(56)" PLACE="foot"><P>They might have alledged, that if an ambas∣sador, sent from this kingdom to France, Spain, or to any other foreign State, <HI>out of the Dominions</HI> of the im∣perial Crown of Great-Britain, should notoriously be∣tray his King and Country, and plot their Destruction,
<PB N="183" REF="222"/>he might <HI>legally</HI> and <HI>constitutionally</HI> be punished accord∣ing to the <HI>letter</HI> and <HI>meaning</HI> of the said Acts of Parlia∣ment; and also that any other British Subject whatso∣ever, that is, in like manner, <HI>guilty of Treason</HI> to his King and Country, during his residence in a foreign realm, may be treated accordingly; because all men certainly are accountable to their country for any such Treason; and, as they cannot be tried in the foreign realms, where the offences were committed, it is rea∣sonable and just to suppose, that they may be tried in <HI>England,</HI> by an impartial Jury, though the same a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not <HI>"neighbours to the fact,"</HI> nor impannelled <HI>de vi∣cineta,</HI> that is, from the neighbourhood where the of∣fence was committed; for, though this circumstance is <HI>essentially necessary to the Legality of a Jury</HI> in every other case, yet the law does not require <HI>impossibilities,</HI> and it may therefore (perhaps) be <HI>legally dispensed with,</HI> when it is apparent, from the nature of the case, that such an unexceptionable Jury cannot be obtained, and yet that an exemplary punishment is manifestly due to the Trai∣tor or Traitors: but when <HI>Treasons</HI> and other of∣fences are committed in any country <HI>under the domi∣nion</HI> of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> where the criminals might have a <HI>legal</HI> Trial <HI>according to the laws of this realm,</HI> (as in <HI>Ireland,</HI>) the said <HI>most essential formality</HI> of being tried by a Jury <HI>de vicineto</HI> cannot be dispensed with; because this would deprive the Subject of an <HI>un∣alienable Right,</HI> and <HI>alter a <Q>fundamental Law of this

<P>The examination of this point gives some general idea how far the <HI>Power</HI> of the high Court of Parliament (notwithstanding that imaginary <HI>"omnipotency"</HI> which some men have ignorantly attributed to it) may be allow∣ed to extend; <Q>for, the more high and absolute the juris∣diction of the court is, the MORE JUST and HONOUR∣ABLE it ought to be in the proceeding, and to give example of Justice to inferior courts. <BIBL>4th Inst. p. 37.</BIBL></Q> Which is most strictly true; for, whenever the supreme temporal powers exceed the <HI>honourable</HI> limits of <HI>natural Justice</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> they lessen their own dignity, and, in proportion to their errors, forfeit that respectful con∣sideration and esteem, which would otherwise be due from their subjects. And we must remember, likewise, that the being <HI>"just and honourable"</HI> in mere profession of words, without the <HI>reality,</HI> will have very little weight with the body of the <HI>People,</HI> who are endued with <HI>common-sense,</HI> as well as their superiors, to discern what is <HI>just</HI> and <HI>honourable</HI> from that which is <HI>merely called so;</HI> and that a pretence to <HI>justice and honour,</HI> in a bad cause, is only an aggravation of <HI>injury</HI> and <HI>iniquity!</HI> The most wicked ordinances have sometimes been ush∣ered into the world under the most sanctified titles and specious pretences! The abominable Act beforemen∣tioned,
<PB N="185" REF="224"/>of Hen.

<P>Now, notwithstanding this <Q>FAIR FLATTERING PREAMBLE,</Q> as Sir Edward Coke calls it, yet "THE PURVIEW <HI>of that Act</HI>" (as he justly remarked) <Q><HI>tended, in the execution, contrary</HI> EX DIAMETRO, viz. <HI>to the high displeasure of</HI> ALMIGHTY GOD, <HI>the great</HI> LET, <HI>nay, the</HI> UTTER SUBVERSION, <HI>of the</HI> COMMON LAW, <HI>and the</HI> GREAT LET <HI>of the Wealth of this Land;</HI> <BIBL>ibid. p. 40</BIBL></Q>, as, indeed, every other Act of Parliament must inevitably do, which perverts <Q><HI>the due course of the Law,</HI></Q> and robs the subjects of any <HI>fundamental Right.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As for instance, let us suppose, (1st,) that an Act is made, to stop up or proscribe the passage to any <HI>sea-port town,</HI> or any <HI>haven, shore of the sea,</HI> or <HI>great river,</HI> without the Consent, and to the great Detriment, of all the neighbouring inhabitants; such an Act would be "FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG," as being contrary to the first or most essential Right of mankind, the <HI>Law of Nature:</HI> for it is clearly laid down by Bracton, that all <HI>ports, havens, shores of the sea,</HI> and <HI>great rivers,</HI> are free to all peaceable passengers, (but more particu∣larly, we may add, to the nearest inhabitants.) by the <HI>Law of Na∣ture and of Nations:</HI> <Q>NATURALI VERO JURE <HI>communia sunt omnia haec, aqua profluens, aer, et</HI> MARE, <HI>et</HI> LITTORA MARIS, quasi maris accessoria.

<P>Or, 4thly, if we may conceive the idea of an Act calculated to <HI>"fulfil the Measure of Iniquity,"</HI> let us suppose an Act expressly for the purpose of establishing the arbitrary Laws of France, (<Q><HI>Quod Principi placuit habet vigorem Legis,</HI></Q> &amp;c. see my Preface there∣upon,) and, in order that it may be destructive to <HI>the Souls,</HI> as well as the <HI>Bodies</HI> and Property, of the wretched Subjects, (as I have al∣ready shewn,) let us suppose that ample provision is made therein for the <HI>Establishment</HI> (not the mere Toleration) of downright <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>Image-Worship!</HI> for the Toleration of the most notorious EXOR∣CISMS (<HI>"Exorcismus Aquae;" — "Exorcismum Salis." — "Ex∣orciso te, creatura Salis;"</HI> — see the Missal) and SPIRITUAL WITCHCRAFT! In short, let us suppose that such an Act provides for the Establishment of that adulterated Religion which has long been perplexed with all the Enthusiasm of <HI>heathen</HI> ignorance, <HI>(long Prayers, vain Repetitions, "as the Heathen do,")</HI> and bears the most apparent marks of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> insomuch that we might be certain; at least, who was the first <HI>spiritual</HI> Instigator and Promoter of such a Bill, though the <HI>bodily</HI> Proposer of it should be lucky enough to-remain undiscovered!

<PB N="185" REF="224"/></NOTE> And therefore, if any such Act should be

<PB N="190" REF="229"/>principles whereby <Q><HI>any fundamental Law</HI> of the Realm is altered,</Q> the same would manifestly <HI>endanger the necks</HI> (I must repeat it) of any Judges that were im∣prudent enough to enforce them, notwithstanding that the express Authority of <HI>King, Lords,</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> should be alledged as their sufficient warrant; because we find that the <HI>like Authority</HI> afforded no justification or excuse for poor Empson and Dudley, <HI>in a similar case,</HI> neither did the consideration of their having acted by <HI>parliamentary Authority</HI> render their wretched fate more pitiable in the eyes of the public! And there∣fore I sincerely wish that all modern <HI>Time-servers</HI> may have prudence enough to form (by that plain example) some reasonable judgement concerning the imaginary <HI>"Omnipotence of Parliament,"</HI> which cannot insure its wretched votaries from the most ignominious punish∣ment! nor secure even <HI>the Parliament itself</HI> from the just and lasting Censures of the Sages of our Law, such as <HI>Lord Coke,</HI> for instance, who warned them in ano∣ther place, also, expressly upon this point: — <Q><HI>By colour of which Act,</HI></Q> (says he, meaning the said un∣just Act of 11 Hen.

<PB N="203" REF="242"/>treason to the state!

No single Act of Parliament can unbind
<PB N="204" REF="243"/>or remove the limits here laid down: nothing less than the same <HI>accumulated Authority,</HI> by which the Charter is now established, can possibly set it aside, or any part of it, according to <HI>the Maxim</HI> be∣fore recited, <Q><HI>eodem modo quo quid consti∣tuitur, eodem modo dissolvitur:</HI></Q> for no single Act of Parliament, <Q><HI>eodem modo constituitur,</HI></Q> is ordained in the <HI>same manner.</HI> The many repeated confirmations of its authority were a work of ages; so that the said authority cannot <HI>legally</HI> be set aside, unless it be done <HI>eodem modo quo con∣stituitur,</HI> that is, by the repeated suffra∣ges of <HI>as many Parliaments against it</HI> as have already expressly confirmed it; and God forbid that any such gross depravity and corruption should ever obtain such a continuance in this kingdom, as to ac∣complish so great an evil; for that could not be without a total national reprobacy, dangerous to us not only in this world, but also in the next!</P>

<P>Let him now bear witness both against the said <HI>Judges</HI> and <HI>himself!</HI> — <Q>And albeit, Judgements in the King's Courts</Q> (says he) <Q>are of high regard

Mr. Barrington remarks, on the 14th of Ed. III. <HI>"The Statutes now begin to appear"</HI> (says he) <Q><HI>in a new, and more regular form;</HI> &amp;c. <HI>whilst the Pre∣amble,</HI> IN EVERY INSTANCE, <HI>makes express men∣tion of the</HI> CONCURRENCE OF THE COMMONS, <BIBL>p. 218</BIBL></Q>; whereas this Ordinance has no such mention of their "CONCURRENCE," but only the <HI>Assent of the Council,</HI> that is, the Assent of the <HI>King</HI>'s Council — <HI>"de assensu consilii nostri ordinanda duximus,"</HI> &amp;c. whereas the Assent of the <HI>great Council of the Nation</HI> is expressed in very different terms, as I have remarked in the former notes, as also in the notes on pages. 128 and 129.</P>
<P>But if this learned Judge meant any other Laws "<HI>for</HI> IRELAND, <HI>made by Edward</HI> III." than this Or∣dinance of his 31st year, (for he refers us, in the mar∣gin, to the Parliament-Rolls of his 5th year,) yet the same cannot afford the least proof or precedent for <HI>binding Ireland</HI> in England without Assent, because I have already cited ample testimony that the Parliament 
<PB N="214" REF="253"/>of <HI>Ireland</HI> in those days was frequently summoned to <HI>England,</HI> sometimes to confer with the <HI>English</HI> Parlia∣ment; and sometimes to meet the King and his Coun∣cil: in distinct Seffions of the <HI>Irish</HI> Legislature. See pages 66 to 80.</P>
<P>His fourth voucher adds no more confirmation to his assertion than the three former; for though it is really <HI>an Act of Parliament,</HI> yet it cannot be produced as a precedent for <HI>binding</HI> the <HI>Irish</HI> Subjects <HI>without their Consent,</HI> because it is made expressly for the pur∣pose of <HI>enforcing</HI> an Act of the <HI>Irish Parliament, "Es∣tatute "fait en la terre d' Ireland;"</HI> and therefore, as the question relates only to the carrying the said Law into execution, which is properly the office of the King and his Courts, it is certainly indifferent whe∣ther be is advised therein by his <HI>Privy-Council</HI> or by his <HI>Common-Council</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> especially as the lat∣ter, in the case before us, were so far from advising the King to invade or alter the <HI>Irish</HI> Law, that they confirm it in the strongest terms — <Q><HI>que le di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Estatute estoise</HI> EN SA ENTIER FORCE, <HI>et que bien et duement soit gardez et</HI> PLEINEMENT EXECUTE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>With respect to his 5th voucher, referring us to "<HI>the late Acts made in</HI> 17 <HI>Car.</HI> 1," &amp;c. it would be very unfair to draw from thence any conclusions unfavour∣able to the Privileges of the <HI>Irish</HI> Parliament, because that was the fatal year of the
<PB N="215" REF="254"/>popish massacre in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> when the Protestant Subjects of that kingdom were almost universally oppressed, and all Law and Regularity overturned by the open Rebellion of the popish party: so that even the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> (as well as the Parliament of <HI>England</HI>) thought it right to take the affairs of <HI>Ireland</HI> under their consi∣deration at that unfortunate juncture; and sent two Commissioners, properly instructed by the States of that kingdom, to treat with the <HI>English</HI> Parliament about the means of suppressing the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebellion. Sir John Temple's History of the Irish Rebellions p. 156 to 158.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding that some Acts might have been made in the 17th of Charles I. without the As∣sent of the <HI>Irish</HI> Parliament, yet they afford no evi∣dence in favour of that opinion for which they are cited by the learned Judge; for Mr. Molyneux has proved that, by the repeal of those very Acts of 17 Cha. I. that they afford an argument even on the <HI>other side of the question,</HI> viz. <Q><HI>that the Parliament of</HI> IRELAND <HI>may repeal an Act made in</HI> ENGLAND <HI>in relation to the affairs of</HI> IRELAND, <BIBL>p. 75.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And again, with respect to the 6th and last voucher, under that head, (<HI>viz.</HI> the resolution of the Judges in the Exchequer-Chamber, in the case of the Mer∣chants of Waterford,) it by no means relates to the question in dispute; for that concerns only the expor∣tation and importation of goods, and the <HI>Irish</HI> do not pretend to contest the Right of Great-Britain to the <HI>Dominion of the Seas;</HI> nor do they deny the Power of the British Parliament to regulate Commerce, as I have before remarked. Now, as it appears that <HI>not one</HI> of these Precedents is sufficient for the purpose pro∣posed,
<PB N="216" REF="255"/>and as we cannot doubt but that so learned a Lawyer as Judge Vaughan (as I have before observed of Judge Coke) would select the most applicable Pre∣cedents that could be found, the doctrine which he has built upon these insufficient Precedents must ne∣cessarily fall to the ground.</P>

<PB N="222" REF="261"/>been <HI>"the original and true ground"</HI> of all the dangerous mistakes which have been made, upon this important question, by Lord Coke, Judge Vaughan, and him∣self: for, if this learned gentleman will be pleased to review this argument, founded on <HI>"the Right of Conquest,"</HI> as applied by himself and the other two very eminent Writers, beforementioned, to the free kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> I trust (through the great opinion I entertain of his can∣dour and good sense) that he will readily give it up; for, though the <Q><HI>Right of Conquest</HI></Q> may be, as he says, <Q><HI>a Right allowed by</HI> THE LAW OF NATIONS, <HI>if not by that of Nature,</HI></Q> (that is, in some particular cases,) yet it certainly is contra∣ry both to <HI>"the Law of Nations"</HI> and <HI>"that of Nature,"</HI> (to which he has ap∣pealed,) that <HI>"the Right of Conquest"</HI> should be pleaded for <HI>binding</HI> the <HI>Conque∣rors themselves, or their Descendants, with∣out their Assent!</HI> for of such consist the
<PB N="223" REF="262"/>greatest part of the landed interest in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> at this day, who are entitled to all the Rights and Liberties of the ANCIENT CONQUERORS by <HI>inheritance</HI> and <HI>lineal de∣scent:</HI> — Titles so <HI>just</HI> and <HI>sacred,</HI> that I am sure Judge Blackstone will never per∣sist in opposing them; especially when he sees hereafter by what authority I make this assertion: Nay, the <Q><HI>Right of Con∣quest</HI></Q> is so bad a plea to extenuate the <HI>iniquity</HI> of exerting any such oppressive and <HI>unlimited</HI> power, that it fails in <HI>Reason</HI> and in natural <HI>Justice,</HI> even when applied as an excuse for oppressing <HI>the conquered;</HI> — much less therefore can it affect the Liberties and natural Rights of the <HI>Conquerors</HI> themselves!</P>
<P>That these <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>natural Rights</HI> of the <HI>conquerors</HI> are entailed upon a very great part (if not the most <HI>numerous,</HI> at least the most <HI>considerable in point of rank and fortune</HI>) of the present inhabi∣tants
<PB N="224" REF="263"/>of <HI>Ireland,</HI> is a point, I believe, which cannot be contested; for Judge Blackstone himself has declared in a preceding page, 99: — <Q><HI>That the in∣habitants of</HI> IRELAND are, FOR THE MOST PART<NOTE N="(77)" PLACE="foot"><P>The following Extract, from Sir Wm. Petty's Political Survey of Ireland, will corroborate this just Remark of Sir William Blackstone.— <Q>The <HI>British</HI> Protestants and Church have three-fourths of all the Lands, five-sixths of all the housing, nine-tenths of all the housing in walled towns and places of strength, two-thirds of the foreign trade,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 27.</P></NOTE>, <HI>descended from the</HI> ENGLISH, who planted it <HI>as a kind of</HI> COLONY, <HI>after the Conquest</HI> of it by King Henry the Second,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and con∣sequently "THE MOST PART" of the said Inhabitants ought to be considered as stand∣ing in the place of the <HI>Conquerors,</HI> rather than of the <HI>Conquered,</HI> so that if the <HI>Reason</HI> assigned by these three learned men has <HI>any weight, viz.</HI> that some de∣gree of <HI>superiority</HI> is acquired by <HI>Right of Conquest,</HI> it must be allowed, that "THE
<PB N="225" REF="264"/>MOST PART of the said Inhabitants are equally intitled to it, in Right of their <HI>conquering Ancestors;</HI> for it would be highly injurious to deprive them of their <HI>hereditary Privileges,</HI> which descend to them from the actual Conquerors them∣selves.—And, on the other hand, it would be equally <HI>unjust, wicked,</HI> and <HI>im∣politic,</HI> to make any partial distinction between them and the descendants of the <HI>conquered Irish,</HI> who, after many years struggle, are now, at last, happily incor∣potated and blended with them as <HI>one free People!</HI></P>
<P>Having now examined the opinions of the most eminent Writers, that have fa∣voured this <HI>Notion</HI> of a Right in the Bri∣tish Parliament to <HI>bind</HI> the Subjects of <HI>Ireland "when especially named,"</HI> I trust it will appear, to every impartial Reader, that such doctrine is so far from having any real <HI>foundation</HI> to support it, that it
<PB N="226" REF="265"/>is really diametrically opposite to some of the most essential <HI>foundations of Law,</HI> and is apparently <HI>subversive</HI> of one of the first principles of the British <HI>Constitution!</HI> so that it will be needless for me to take notice of any thing that has been said to the <HI>same purpose</HI> by inferior Writers, or by the Editors or Collectors of Law Dic∣tionaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who have <HI>only quoted</HI> these great authorities which I have already demonstrated to be <HI>erroneous;</HI> and I may therefore, I hope, be now allowed to repeat with double satisfaction and cer∣tainty what I before asserted only upon <HI>general Principles</HI> in the first Part of this Declaration, <HI>viz.</HI> that <Q><HI>the true constitu∣tional mode of</HI> CONNECTING <HI>British Do∣minions, that are otherwise separated by</HI> NATURE, <HI>is demonstrated by the esta∣blished example of the union of</HI> GREAT BRITAIN <HI>and</HI> IRELAND, <HI>which by long experience has proved to be sufficiently ef∣fectual,</HI> <BIBL>p. 21.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="266"/>But, notwithstanding that I have al∣ready been led to a tedious length of ar∣gument by the necessary examination of so many authors, I must beg leave still to add some general remarks upon the above-mentioned groundless argument drawn from <HI>the Right of Conquest;</HI> for Judge Blackstone has been equally un∣guarded in what he has laid down con∣cerning the <HI>American Colonies</HI> in p. 107. of the same volume, where he has made a very improper use of this same mista∣ken notion about the Right of Conquest.</P>
<P>"Our <HI>American</HI> Plantations" (says he) "are principally of this latter sort," (<HI>viz.</HI> conquered or ceded countries, of which he was treating in the preceding sen∣tence,) "being obtained" (says he) <Q>in the last century, either by RIGHT OF CONQUEST, <HI>and driving out the Na∣tives, (with what natural Justice I shall not at present enquire,) or by Trea∣ties.
<PB N="228" REF="267"/>And therefore</HI></Q> (says he) <Q><HI>the</HI> COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND, <HI>as such, has no</HI> ALLOWANCE <HI>or authority there;</HI> they being <HI>no part of the mother Country, but distinct (though dependent) Dominions.</HI></Q> But, when he reconsiders this part of his work, I trust he will al∣low that the COMMON LAW of <HI>England</HI> is principally founded on <HI>Reason, natural Justice,</HI> and <HI>the eternal Laws of God;</HI> and consequently all that part of the COM∣MON LAW, which arises from <HI>these foun∣dations,</HI> MUST HAVE <Q><HI>allowance or authority,</HI></Q> not only <HI>there (viz.</HI> in the English Colonies) but <HI>every where else,</HI> if the unjust pretensions of Tyrants were to be duly restrained by <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Equity:</HI> and, with respect to the <HI>remaining part</HI> of the COMMON LAW, consisting in an∣cient and approved <HI>usages</HI> and <HI>customs, pe∣culiar to English Subjects,</HI> he will not be backward, I trust, to grant them also <HI>"allowance or authority there,"</HI> when he
<PB N="229" REF="268"/>is reminded that these <HI>conquered Countries</HI> are not inhabited by <HI>the conquered People,</HI> but chiefly by <HI>British Subjects,</HI> successors to <HI>the Conquerors,</HI> who are entitled by <HI>Birth-right</HI> to the <HI>Common Law of Eng∣land,</HI> and every other privilege of Eng∣lishmen, quite as much as those <HI>English Subjects</HI> mentioned by him at the top of the same page. <HI>"For it hath been held,"</HI> (says he) <Q><HI>that if an uninhabited country be discovered and</HI> PLANTED BY ENG∣LISH SUBJECTS, ALL THE EN∣GLISH LAWS THEN IN BEING, <HI>which are the</HI> BIRTH-RIGHT OF EVERY SUBJECT, <HI>are immediately</HI> THERE IN FORCE. <BIBL>1 Com. p. 107.</BIBL></Q> This doctrine is unquestionable; and the more so because allowed by him∣self: And though he has been pleased to add, that <Q><HI>this must be understood with very many and very great restrictions;</HI></Q> that <Q><HI>such Colonists carry with them only so much of the English Law,</HI> as is ap∣plicable
<PB N="230" REF="269"/>to their own situation,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet it must be apparent that, if they <HI>"carry with them"</HI> any Laws <HI>at all,</HI> it most be by virtue of their <HI>natural Right as Englishmen,</HI> whereby they are certain∣ly as much entitled <HI>to all;</HI> (I mean all the English Laws that were in being when these several Colonies respectively were es∣tablished;) and therefore, though they <HI>used</HI> (in the infant state of each Colony) <Q><HI>only so much of the English Law</HI> as was ap∣plicable to <HI>their own situation,</HI></Q> (and it is absurd to suppose that they would <HI>use</HI> more, whether intitled to it or not,) yet this does not affect their undoubted <HI>Right to the whole;</HI> which <HI>Right</HI> descends to posterity and successors in the same manner as all other <HI>inheritances;</HI> it be∣ing, indeed, their <HI>very best inheri∣tance</HI> <NOTE N="(78)" PLACE="foot"><P>Judge Blackstone himself has called it in the the very same page <HI>"the Birth-Right of every Subject."</HI></P></NOTE>: And Equity surely entitles the increasing Colonies (continually as
<PB N="231" REF="270"/>occasions may arise from their improve∣ments) to the use and benefit of <HI>all be∣neficial Laws</HI> which were in force at the time of their ancestors emigration.</P>
<P>That these, however, <HI><Q>must be under∣stood with</Q> some "Restrictions,"</HI> can∣not be denied;—as the Laws of <HI>"Re∣venue,"</HI> (for instance,) which the learn∣ed Gentleman himself has mentioned: for these were merely local, and cannot therefore be <HI>legally</HI> enforced in any new Dominions without the express Assent or Grant of the Inhabitants in such new Dominions, the same being absolutely ne∣cessary to give them a <HI>local</HI> effect within the said Dominions: because nothing but the <HI>free Grant</HI> and <HI>Assent</HI> of the <HI>Inhabitants and Landholders</HI> gave them force, <HI>origi∣nally,</HI> even in the mother Country; and, therefore, nothing but the <HI>like authority</HI> (that is, the free Grant of <HI>the Inhabi∣tants upon the spot</HI> wherever they are
<PB N="232" REF="271"/>introduced) can possibly render them <HI>legal, just,</HI> and <HI>binding</HI> in any other part of the world; so that it must necessarily appear, that no new acquired Territories, settled by British Subjects, can <HI>legally</HI> be taxed by English Acts of Parliament, nor be bound thereby in their <HI>internal</HI> Government without such manifest <HI>in∣justice</HI> and <HI>iniquity</HI> as must necessarily render <HI>null and void</HI> all such pretended Acts; for, otherwise, if they were ad∣mitted, they would render all the tem∣poral hereditary possessions and property of the Subjects in the Colonies entirely <HI>uncertain,</HI> which is one of the most odious circumstances in the eye of the Law that can be mentioned. <Q><HI>"Quod cer∣tum est retinendum est,</HI> quod INCERTUM EST <HI>dimittendum:</HI> Nay, <HI>quod</HI> INCERTUM EST NIHIL EST:" This is the cen∣sure of Law upon all the Acts of Men which fall under the judgement of the Law.

<PB N="233" REF="272"/>the Acts of Men, HOLDING THEM FOR NOUGHT and VOYDE that are INCER∣TAINE; how much more then doth THE LAW REQUIRE CERTAINTY <HI>in her own Acts,</HI> which are to bind all Men. <BIBL>The Liberty of the Subject against the pretended Power of Imposi∣tions, by Wm.

<P>I have been the more particular (as well here as upon Orurke's case before∣mentioned) in expressing the necessity of restraining the <HI>Power of Parliament</HI> within the bounds of <HI>Reason, Justice,</HI> and <HI>natural Equity,</HI> because, I find, it is too common an error that an <HI>Act of Parliament is omnipotent,</HI> and that whatever is or∣dained by Parliament <HI>must be Law,</HI> with∣out any exception of <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Wrong, White</HI> or <HI>Black, Truth</HI> or <HI>Falsehood!</HI> which, God be thanked, is very far from being <HI>true,</HI> though the learned Commen∣tator Judge Blackstone, upon the very

Plowden has reported a va∣riety of cases wherein Acts of Parliament were es∣teemed <HI>vaid in Law,</HI> through the want of <HI>truth</HI> in the recitals: see pages 398 to 400. — <Q>Et issint Parliament puit misprender chose, et Statutes que MISRECITE CHOSES, et sont referre a eux, SER∣RONT VOID, et null serra conclude per eux. Issint en notre principal case, le statut que recite le plain∣tiff fuit attaint, et confirme ceo, ou en fail il ne fuit attaint, SERRA VOIDE.</Q></P></NOTE> if, in any of <HI>these points,</HI> it should unfortunately hap∣pen (I say) that <Q><HI>what the Parliament doth</HI></Q> is really defective, or made contrary thereto, the same ought to be "HOLDEN FOR NONE!" There needs <HI>"no authority upon earth"</HI> to undo what is <HI>so done,</HI> for it is <HI>null and void</HI> of itself, notwithstanding the united authority of King, Lords, and Commons! And, whenever any Acts have been thus in advertently or too hastily made, the most honourable method of getting rid of them is, by the same authority, to <HI>declare
<PB N="238" REF="277"/>them null and void,</HI> and not merely to <HI>re∣peal</HI> them, because the latter is not a sufficient reparation to <HI>injured justice and truth;</HI> for, as all men are fallible, it is disingenuous and highly dishonourable, in any man, or body of men whatsoever, not to acknowledge a <HI>mistake</HI> or <HI>error,</HI> when the same is fairly demonstrated!</P>
<P><Q><HI>The power and jurisdiction of the Parliament, for making of Laws,</HI></Q> &amp;c. is NOT therefore <Q><HI>so transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined, either for causes or persons,</HI></Q> (as supposed by Lord Coke, 4 Inst. p. 36,) <Q><HI>within any bounds,</HI></Q> since the just <HI>bounds</HI> and limits of it are so very clearly defined, as well as the due bounds of <HI>regal Power,</HI> that they fall within the judgement of every man who has COMMON SENSE to distinguish GOOD from EVIL, or RIGHT from WRONG; so that the imaginary OMNIPOTENCE OF PARLIAMENT is not
<PB N="239" REF="278"/>only (as Judge Blackstone has declared) <HI>"a figure rather too bold;"</HI> but even to∣tally false and unjust; because the Par∣liament is manifestly limited, (as all powers on earth must be,) and CANNOT <Q><HI>do every thing that is not</HI> NATURALLY <HI>impossible;</HI></Q> though Judge Blackstone supposes it can (1 Com. p. 161.) for the <Q>Power<NOTE N="(83)" PLACE="foot"><P>— "Quia illa potestas" (potestas Juris) <Q>folius Dei est; potestas autem injuriae diaboli, et non Dei; et cujus horum opera fecerit rex, ejus minister erit cujus opera fecerit. Igitur, dum fa∣cit justit am, vicarius est Regis aeterni; minister autem diaboli, dum declinet ad injuriam,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <BIBL>Bracton, lib. 3, c. 9, p. 107 b.</BIBL></P></NOTE> OF RIGHT (or Justice) alone is of GOD; but that of WRONG (or Injury) is of the DEVIL; and the works of whichsoever of these the King</Q> (or any other man) <Q>shall do, of the same shall he be esteemed the servant.</Q> <NOTE N="(84)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Know ye not that, to whom ye yield your∣selves <HI>servants</HI> to obey, <HI>his servants</HI> ye are, to whom ye obey? whether of sin unto death, or of obedi∣ence unto righteousness.</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <BIBL>Rom. vi. 16.</BIBL></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="279"/>So that <HI>"the Powers that be"</HI> cannot bind the conscience when they exceed <HI>just limits,</HI> any more than the threats of a <HI>lawless Banditti;</HI> and therefore we may truly say <HI>of all the Branches of the Legis∣lature together,</HI> (I mean their united au∣thority,) what the ingenious Mr. Sadler said particularly concerning the House of Commons; <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>When they are</HI> FREE∣EST, <HI>they have</HI> LIMITS; <HI>for they be not infinite. Nay, when they are</HI> MOST FREE, <HI>they are</HI> MOST BOUND <HI>to</HI> GOOD ORDERS, <HI>and to</HI> RICHT-REASON. <BIBL>Sadler's Rights, p. 135.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It would be happy for this kingdom if all Members of Parliament were sen∣sible of these <HI>indispensible limitations;</HI> and therefore, though I have thought it my duty to oppose what Judge Black∣stone has unfortunately allowed concern∣ing the imaginary OMNIPOTENCE OF
<PB N="241" REF="280"/>PARLIAMENT, yet I think myself bound most heartily to concur with him in what he has mentioned in the same page — <Q>That it is a matter most essential to the liberties of this kingdom, that such members be delegated to this important Trust, as are most emi∣nent for their probity, their fortitude, and their knowledge; for it was a known apophthegm of the great Lord Treasurer Burleigh, "that England could never be ruined but by a Par∣liament,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But, before I conclude this 2d part of my Declaration, it may, perhaps, be expected that I should apologize for the tedious length of it; and yet, when my Readers consider that it was necessary for me to answer the assertions of some of the most eminent Law Writers that this na∣tion, perhaps, ever produced, they will not think their time ill spent (I hope) in
<PB N="242" REF="281"/>following me through this minute exami∣nation of the said assertions, especially as they relate to the most <HI>important points of the</HI> CONSTITUTION <HI>and</HI> COMMON LAW <HI>of England and Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>And I hope, also, that my Readers will not charge me <HI>with presumption,</HI> for ha∣ving, in the course of this argument, opposed the opinions of such very respect∣able Writers as <HI>Baron Puffendorf</HI> on THE CIVIL LAW, and <HI>the Judges Coke, Vaugh∣an, Jenkins, and Blackstone,</HI> and <HI>the Hon. Mr. Barrington, on</HI> THE LAWS OF ENG∣LAND. If my Remarks should, in any part, be thought too severe, I am sorry for it; I can only assure my Readers that the least <HI>personal disrespect</HI> is not intended; for I am sufficiently sensible of my own unworthiness and <HI>too superficial knowledge in all things;</HI> and have, therefore, most carefully avoided any doctrine which may seem to rest merely upon the weak foun∣dation
<PB N="243" REF="282"/>of my own opinion; but, where∣ever I have ventured to dissent, from the opinions of these approved writers, I have assigned plain <HI>reasons</HI> for it, or o∣ther <HI>proper authorities,</HI> and I desire to be trusted no farther than these <HI>plain rea∣sons</HI> and <HI>authorities</HI> will fairly warrant. I hope I may be permitted to use the same apology for pointing out mistakes in the opinions of these very learned writers which the <HI>Hon. Mr. Justice Bar∣rington</HI> has applied particularly to the Institutes and Reports of <HI>Sir Edward Coke;</HI> which <HI>"being"</HI> (says he) <Q><HI>the best</HI> LAW-CHART, <HI>and implicitly trusted to, it is proper to take notice of every shoal and rock misplaced, though per∣haps not in the proper track of naviga∣tion,</HI> <BIBL>p. 91.</BIBL></Q></P>
