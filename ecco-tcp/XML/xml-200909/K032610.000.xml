<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE supposed <HI>opinion</HI> of Mr. Hatsell, (in his <Q><HI>Precedents of Pro∣ceedings in the House of Commons,</HI></Q> under the title of <Q><HI>King calls the Parliament,</HI></Q>) as compendiously stated by my worthy and very learn∣ed friend, Mr. Lofft, in p. 5 of his Observations, is a much more fa∣vourable construction than Mr. Hatsell's <HI>own words</HI> can really warrant; though all persons, who are acquainted with that gentleman's very a∣miable character, (including the writer of this remark,) have reason to wish, for his sake, that his <HI>opinion</HI> (whatever it may be) had been so expressed as to be really limited by the moderate and very friendly con∣struction which Mr. Lofft has put upon it. Mr. Lofft supposes the <HI>opi∣nion</HI> of Mr. Hatsell to be, that <Q><HI>the intent of the statutes of Edward, and the ancient law and constitution of the kingdom, require parliaments to</HI> SIT <HI>once at least in every year, but</HI> NOT <HI>that they should be</HI> ANNUALLY, OR OFTENER, ELECTED;</Q> but Mr. Hatsell himself, if we may judge by his manner of writing, is far from admitting that <HI>the constitution requires parliaments</HI> even <HI>to</HI> SIT once a year, or that <Q><HI>the king is obli∣ged to call a parliament once at least in every year;</HI></Q> for this he has contemptuously treated merely as <HI>'a notion'</HI> (that) <Q><HI>has been some∣times entertained;</HI></Q> (p. 196, n.) and he, asserts, that <Q><HI>those persons, who maintain</HI> THIS DOCTRINE,</Q> (i. e. the doctrine last cited in his own words, as a <HI>general</HI> doctrine, having two different accep∣tations, arising from the 4th and 36th Edward III.) <HI>'do not mean'</HI> (says he) <Q><HI>that, according to these statutes,</HI> A SESSION <HI>of parliament shall be hol∣den every year, but that</HI> A NEW ELECTION shall be had, &amp;c.</Q>— In an∣swer to which, it may be sufficient to oppose one eminent example for all: viz. that the learned commentator, Judge Blackstone, notorious∣ly denied, as well as himself, that the <HI>latter</HI> doctrine <HI>'ever was'</HI> the <HI>mean∣ing</HI> of those ancient statutes, though he actually was one of <Q><HI>those per∣sons who maintained</HI></Q> the <HI>former</HI> general construction of the said sta∣tutes (the only operative construction they are <HI>now</HI> capable of bearing since the traverse of the modern acts for <HI>triennial</HI> and <HI>septennial</HI> elections) as being still in force to <HI>bind the king.</HI> See 1 Com. c. 2, p. 152 &amp; 153: where the learned writer, having mentioned that <Q><HI>the king only can con∣voke a parliament,</HI></Q> immediately adds, <Q><HI>and</HI> THIS, <HI>by the ancient sta∣tutes of the realm,</HI> HE IS BOUND TO DO EVERY YEAR, <HI>or oftener if need be;</HI></Q> for which, in a note, he expressly cites these statutes of K. Ed. III. and immediately afterwards he mentions the two different acceptations of
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>the said statutes. —<HI>'Not'</HI> (says he) <HI>'that he'</HI> (i. e. the king) <Q><HI>is, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver was, obliged by these statutes to call a</HI> NEW <HI>parliament every year; but on¦ly to permit a parliament to</HI> SIT <HI>annually,</HI></Q> &amp;c. The words,—<HI>'to permit,'</HI>—being a verb in the infinitive mood, do manifestly require a repetitio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (to be understood) of the preceding verb, <HI>'is obliged,'</HI>—viz. <Q><HI>is oblige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to permit;</HI></Q> which confirms, by <HI>necessary grammatical construction,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doctrine of the preceding sentence, that the king <HI>'is bound'</HI> by the sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ancient statutes. This doctrine is strongly confirmed by the nationa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> declaration in the preamble to the statute of 16 Charles I. c. 1. <Q>that by the laws and statutes of this realm, the <HI>parliament ought to be hol¦den</HI> AT LEAST ONCE EVERY YEAR <HI>for the redress of grievances,</HI></Q> &amp;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which (though the act is repealed) is stated, as being still an existing principle of parliamentary doctrine, by Judge Hales, in his <Q><HI>Original Institution, Power, &amp;c. of Parliaments,</HI></Q> p. 57. and which is still farther confirmed by the constant <HI>'usage and custom of parliament</HI> ever since the revolution, as well as by the obvious <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>necessi¦ty</HI> of it; whereby the <HI>'lex et consuetudo parliamenti'</HI> upon this poin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must surely be sufficiently clear not to be mistaken by persons o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much less intelligence in those matters than <HI>the clerk of the house of commons!</HI> Yet Mr. Hatsell does not admit even this general construction of the ancient statutes; and, as a proof that he <HI>does not,</HI> I need only to observe, that, though he is writing expressly concerning what he call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <Q><HI>the undoubted prerogative of the crown to judge of the expediency of calling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parliament, and to determine at what time the writs shall issue; yet this pre∣rogative</HI></Q> (says he) <Q><HI>is limited by two acts of parliament, the</HI> 16th <HI>Ch.</HI> II. <HI>c.</HI> 1, <HI>and the</HI> 6th <HI>of Wm &amp; Mary, c.</HI> 2; <HI>both of which,</HI></Q> &amp;c.—<Q><HI>enact, that from henceforth a parliament shall be holden once in three years at the least;</HI></Q> <Q><HI>so that, in obedience</HI> TO THESE LAWS,</Q> (says he, without citing any other <HI>limitation,</HI> either of <HI>statute</HI> or <HI>usage,</HI> but <HI>these</HI> two acts for <HI>triennial</HI> parliaments,) <Q><HI>the ministers of the crown</HI></Q> (says he) <Q><HI>are bound to take care,</HI> <Q><HI>that</HI> THE SITTING <HI>and holding of parliaments shall not be</HI> INTERMITTED <HI>or</HI> DISCONTINUED <HI>above three years at the most.</HI></Q></Q> <Q><HI>And it is their duty</HI></Q> (says he) <Q><HI>to give directions for issuing the writs of summons</HI> ACCORDINGLY,</Q>—i.e. according to the two acts for <HI>triennia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> parliaments, or rather to a part of one of them, viz. the part he has selected for the direction of <HI>'the ministers of the crown'</HI> to <Q><HI>take care, that the</HI> SITTING, &amp;c. <HI>shall not be</HI> INTERMITTED or DISCONTINUED <HI>above three years at the most;</HI></Q> whereby he leaves <Q><HI>the ministers of the crown</HI></Q> at liberty to <Q><HI>intermit and discontinue for three years</HI></Q> even the SITTING of parliament, for he has cited no other <HI>limitation</HI> of the pre∣rogative on this head: and, with respect to the two ancient statutes of K. Edward III. he did not (it seems) think them worthy even to be named in his <HI>text,</HI> but only in a <HI>note,</HI> (to shew that he had not forgot them,) where he has treated even their <HI>general</HI> construction merely as "<HI>a notion,</HI> &amp;c." See p. 196-199.</P>
<P>But, though the original meaning and force of these ancient statutes are materially affected and injured by the modern acts for <HI>triennial</HI> and <HI>septennial</HI> parliaments, yet they are certainly still in force (as Judge
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>Blackstone has allowed) to <HI>oblige</HI> the king <HI>'to permit a parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances and dispatch of business;'</HI> and this, without impediment from the words <HI>'if need be'</HI> in the <HI>'loose and vague'</HI> manner that the Judge has applied them, contrary to the necessary <HI>gram∣matical</HI> construction of the whole sentence: (see 'Declaration of the 'People's Rights, p. 166 to 169, n.)—For our right to an <HI>annual ses∣sion of parliament</HI> is founded on the ancient constitution of the kingdom, — on laws that are almost coeval with our national existence in this island. See the <HI>'usage perpetual'</HI> ordained by K. Alfred, and cited by Lord Coke, 1 Inst. p. 110. viz. <HI>'Le Roy Alfred'</HI> (fist) <Q><HI>assem∣bler les Counties, &amp;c. et ordeina, pur</HI> USAGE PERPETUEL, <HI>que deux foitz par an, ou pluis sovent, pour mister</HI></Q> (mestier) <Q><HI>in temps de peace, se assemblerent a Londres, a parliamenter sur le guidament del people de Dieu, &amp;c.</HI></Q>— The testimony of Knighton, (<Q>one of our best his∣torians,</Q> as Mr. Petyt calls him in his preface to the Ancient Right of the Commons, p. 41.) <Q><HI>that, by an ancient</HI> STATUTE <HI>and</HI> CUSTOM, <HI>laudable and approved, which nobody could deny, the king was</HI> ONCE IN A YEAR <HI>to convene his</HI> LORDS <HI>and</HI> COMMONS <HI>to his Court of Parlia∣ment,</HI></Q> &amp;c. Mr. Nevill's testimony concerning an ancient statute of Edward I. ordering that <Q><HI>a parliament shall be held every year, and oftener if need be;</HI></Q> for which see his Plato Redivivus, p. 110-112. — The same doctrine declared in the very next reign, as proved by Mr. Petyt (p. 77) from Rot. Claus 10 Edw. II. m. 28, intus; that <HI>"upon a petition to the king,"</HI> (K. Edw. II.) '<HI>he granted that</HI> "SEMEL IN ANNO TENEATUR <HI>parliamentum,"</HI> &amp;c. whence it is evident, that the act of 4 Edw. III. c. 14, was not a <HI>new</HI> law, but a declaration of the <HI>old</HI> constitution, viz. <Q><HI>That a parliament shall be holden every year once, and more often if need be;</HI></Q> which was again confirmed by statute in the 36 Ed. III. c. 10. And the USAGE of those times (proved by the <HI>writs issued for general elections</HI> frequently <Q>MORE OFTEN</Q> than 'ONCE' in a year) excludes all <HI>'doubtful'</HI>-ness from these ancient statutes; so that <HI>new</HI> parliaments must necessarily have been understood, until (by the traverse of modern acts) they became applicable only to the <HI>annual sitting</HI> of parliament.</P>
<P>The opposers of the original meaning (viz for <HI>annual elections,</HI> and <HI>more often</HI>) have rendered that construction still more obvious by their own miserable shifts to evade it! One says, — the words are <Q><HI>loose and vague,</HI></Q> though such a charge is applicable only to his own <HI>un∣grammatical</HI> construction; and another would render the acts <HI>doubt∣ful,</HI> by boldly excluding the only just criterion for <Q><HI>clearing up doubts</HI></Q> in such a case, viz. the USAGE <HI>of the times in which the acts were made;</HI> and, instead of it, would have us refer ONLY to <Q><HI>the practice</HI></Q> and to <HI>'the opinion'</HI> of persons who lived from 200 to 400 years after those times! But the proposer seems not to be aware, that this mode of <HI>'explaining ancient statutes'</HI> is exactly similar to one of the most gross and delusive practices of <HI>popery!</HI> The apostate church of Rome, for obvious reasons, cannot submit the determination of what ought to be esteemed <HI>apostolic doctrine</HI> to the evidence of <HI>apostolic
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>times;</HI> and, of course, she is driven to this wretched subterfuge of re∣ferring for evidence (in favour of her <HI>innovations</HI> and unscriptural prac∣tices) to the traditions of <HI>more modern times,</HI> and to the <HI>practices</HI> and <HI>opinions</HI> of persons who lived from 200 to 400 years afterwards; in or∣der to invalidate <HI>all cotemporary evidence</HI> of <HI>facts</HI> and <HI>primitive usages.</HI> — And surely this dishonest and arbitrary mode of <HI>'settling doubts'</HI> is e∣qually unjustifiable in <HI>legal</HI> and <HI>political,</HI> as in <HI>religious,</HI> questions. Yet Mr. Hatsell boldly ventures to tell us that, <Q><HI>where the expressions of acts of parliament,</HI></Q> (speaking of the acts of Edward,) <Q><HI>passed above</HI> FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO, <HI>are</HI> DOUBTFUL,</Q> (says he, though the contrary is evident,) <Q><HI>nothing can clear up and settle these</HI> DOUBTS <HI>but the</HI> OPINION <HI>of all the wisest and best-informed persons,</HI></Q> &amp;c. <Q><HI>from the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth to the present time.</HI></Q> (P. 198, n.) Thus, even the commencement of the time, here proposed as <HI>the best</HI> for afford∣ing information, is actually more than two hundred years AFTER <HI>the times</HI> in which the acts were made; and he cuts off all <HI>cotemporary,</HI> as well as <HI>intermediate, evidence,</HI> by a single bold assertion, that <Q><HI>nothing can clear up —but,</HI></Q> &amp;c. taking care to secure to himself the ample space of ano∣ther two hundred years, (still more distant from <HI>the times</HI> in question,) that he may range more securely in his search for <HI>precedents</HI> of innova∣tions both in <HI>practice</HI> and <HI>opinion.</HI> And indeed he has most industriously displayed the <HI>practices</HI> of the Stuarts, reminding us, in the course of argument, even of <HI>'intermissions of parliaments'</HI> for several years toge∣ther: — <HI>'an intermission of Parliament of six years,'</HI> by K. James I. — <HI>'an intermission of parliaments for twelve years' together,</HI> by K. Charles I. These were surely most unpropitious times for <HI>parliamentary knowledge;</HI> and Mr. Hatsell does not seem to be aware, that the fear of similar <HI>intermissions</HI> was probably the principal cause which withheld the patriots of those days from urging their <HI>election-rights</HI> at a time when the sum total of all their <HI>rights</HI> was at stake, even <HI>the right to have any parliament at all!</HI> so that their <HI>silence</HI> respecting <HI>annua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> elections</HI> does not at all assist Mr. Hatsell's argument against them. — The people of England, in those times, were rendered so deplorably <HI>abject,</HI> by the <HI>unlimited,</HI> and therefore <HI>illegal,</HI> rule of <HI>Tudors</HI> and <HI>Stuarts</HI> that it was considered as a crime, in the preceding reign of James I even to urge the expediency of calling a parliament at all: — <Q><HI>I would fain know the man that durst persuade the king unto it,</HI></Q> — says THE MI¦NISTER OF STATE in Sir Walter Rawleigh's Dialogue on the <HI>Prero¦gative of Parliaments,</HI> (p. 2.) so that this was undoubtedly the language of <HI>those times</HI> to which Mr. Hatsell has referred us for <HI>acts, opinions</HI> and <HI>speeches,</HI> whereby (with the addition of some still more modern in formation) he thinks <Q><HI>the true intent and meaning of the words used in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> statutes of Edward</HI> III,</Q> (though made almost 300 years before) <Q><HI>migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be best explained:</HI></Q> but, to look for explanatory <HI>'opinions'</HI> and <HI>'speeche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</HI> in such arbitrary times, when men dared not to <HI>speak</HI> their <HI>opinions</HI> upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the subject, is too great an absurdity! so that Mr. Hatsell is peculiarl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unfortunate in fixing his aera for <HI>parliamentary information.</HI> And ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if <HI>'the wisest and best-informed men'</HI> of those times had shewn a littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>more regard to the nation's <HI>rights</HI> than to the <HI>security</HI> of their own per∣sons and property, (for <HI>rich</HI> men are commonly the <HI>worst citizens,</HI> for various reasons,) and had ventured, like <HI>honest men</HI> rather than like <HI>wise and prudent</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'The prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.'—<HI>Amos v. 13.</HI></NOTE><HI>men,</HI> to speak their opinions in favour of that SACRED TRUTH, our indispensible right to the actual <HI>sitting</HI> of a <HI>new</HI> parliament <HI>'every year once'</HI> at least, <HI>'and more often if need be'</HI> — (a truth never to be concealed, a claim never to be relaxed!) — they might probably, with God's blessing in the cause of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> have so checked the progress of unconstitutional doctrines, as to deter their kings and states∣men from changing a <HI>limited</HI> monarchy to an <HI>absolute</HI> tyranny; and might thereby have prevented the horrible effects of <HI>misrule</HI> which speedily broke out and overwhelmed the state! and indeed the infringe∣ment of our <HI>parliamentary rights</HI> was the true source of all the mischiefs that shortly followed: for, when the able patriots (named by Mr. Hatsell) were struggling, almost in despair, to retain the mere existence of a parliament, under K. Charles I. they did not seem to apprehend that their full constitutional claim to an <HI>annual election</HI> was a subject proper to be discussed at such a time; but their only aim, when they met, <HI>('after an intermission of parliaments for twelve years,')</HI> seems to be how they might <HI>prolong their</HI> SITTING <HI>at any rate</HI> for the redress of grie∣vances; whereby it is manifest, that the obstinate monarch's unwil∣lingness to <HI>permit a parliament to</HI> SIT, together with the previous crimi∣nal <HI>intermissions,</HI> (as one <HI>illegality</HI> is apt to beget another,) became, eventually, the parents of a still greater evil—<HI>a long parliament without any election at all,</HI> which severely repaid <HI>the royal perfidy</HI> in kind, by <HI>'an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> intermission,'</HI> in return, <HI>of regal government,</HI>—an exclusion of that per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ured monarch's family from the throne for exactly the same number of years that he had presumed to <HI>intermit</HI> the sitting of parliaments, viz.—for 'TWELVE YEARS <HI>at one time,</HI>' and even the SIX YEARS <HI>intermission,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his father's reign, was severely repaid in a bloody SIX YEARS war, until the son's imprisonment and death!</P>
<P>These are awful examples, worthy the serious attention of all parties; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hough we are bound, at the same time, to discriminate between <HI>exam∣ples</HI> (or <HI>facts</HI>) and <HI>precedents,</HI> that such <HI>baneful examples</HI> may not (by the critical <HI>observations</HI> of ingenious men) be drawn into <HI>precedents</HI> for <HI>pro∣ceedings,</HI> but that the <HI>legal</HI> acceptation of the word <HI>precedent</HI> may always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e duly maintained.</P>
<P>Mr. Hatsell's argument, upon the whole, is certainly a very extraor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inary one: not only because the <HI>arbitrary times,</HI> to which he has limited the commencement of our parliamentary researches, seem to be utterly incapable of affording the least information upon the par∣ticular point in question, and are also near <HI>three hundred years</HI> AFTER <HI>the only proper time</HI> for ascertaining the <HI>usage of the times</HI> when the statutes to be explained were made, — but also because he perempto∣rily
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>excludes all other evidence whatever— <Q><HI>Nothing can clear up, &amp;c. but the opinion, &amp;c. from the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth! &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I am far more willing to attribute such an unaccountable argument to <HI>inattention,</HI> and a <HI>superficial manner of writing,</HI> than to suspect any <HI>rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> design</HI> of the ingenious author to promote a mode of <HI>explaining ancient statutes</HI> so dangerously presumptuous and arbitrary! And, to justify the more moderate conclusion of the two, he has luckily furnished me with an easy and obvious proof of it in the very next chapter but one, to which he has given the running title of— <Q><HI>King adjourns the Parlia∣ment,</HI></Q> — <HI>'King adjourns the Parliament,'</HI> — for several pages together, (i. e. from 204 to 211.) so that that one would naturally suppose that <HI>he really meant what he had so often written:</HI> but, at length, (though not till the very last page of that head,) he kindly guards us against that baneful error by an explicit stating of what HE HIMSELF believes to be <Q><HI>the true parliamentary doctrine,</HI></Q> viz. <Q><HI>That the king has no authority to adjourn the parliament;</HI></Q> and, of course, his <HI>'superficial manner'</HI> of expressing himself (I mean on this particular head) must be corrected, in his next edition, to <HI>'the true parliamentary doctrine,'</HI> — <Q><HI>King does</HI> NOT <HI>adjourn the Parliament:</HI> —</Q> so that he must put <HI>a negative</HI> upon his present <HI>title</HI> throughout all these pages!</P>
<P>But, to return to my subject, I trust that the necessity of at least ONE SITTING of the parliament every year, and of our <HI>national right</HI> to such SITTING, is so sufficiently understood and acknowledged, by the majo∣rity even of <HI>all parties,</HI> that THE CONTRARY DOCTRINE, which arises too apparently from Mr. Hatsell's <HI>manner of treating</HI> the king's prerogative on that subject, will need no particular refutation: and yet so respectable is the authority of the writer, (not only by his office of <HI>clerk of the house of commons,</HI> but also by the personal esteem which is certainly due to him from a very numerous and respectable body of friends and acquaintance,) that I thought myself obliged to take some notice of <HI>his manner of treating</HI> the subject before us, in order to warn the public against <HI>a possible</HI> construction of it which might hereaf∣ter (if not seasonably censured) have dangerous consequences. At the same time I sincerely profess, that my censure is aimed more at this gentleman's <HI>manner of writing</HI> than his <HI>intention,</HI> and that I am much more willing to believe that <HI>the opinion he intended</HI> to express was truly what Mr. Lofft has <HI>supposed;</HI> or that I myself may perhaps be mista∣ken in conceiving that his words are liable to a different construction; rather than to suspect that the worthy clerk of the house of com∣mons could <HI>really intend</HI> to favour a doctrine which is repugnant to the established <HI>usage of parliament</HI> for near a century, and is <HI>equally</HI> inimical to the just privileges of the <HI>Lords</HI> as to those of the <HI>Commons,</HI> and, of course, to the welfare of the <HI>whole nation.</HI></P>
