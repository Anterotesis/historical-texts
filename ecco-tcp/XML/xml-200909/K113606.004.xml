<HEAD><PB REF="4"/>AN HISTORY OF ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Animals of the Hare Kind.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING described in the last chapter a tribe of minute, fierce,
 rapacious animals, I come now to a race of minute animals, of a more harmless
 and gentle kind, that, without being enemies to any, are preyed upon by all. As
 Nature has fitted the former for hostility, so it has entirely formed the
 latter for evasion; and as the one kind subsist by their courage and
 activity, so the other find safety from their swift∣ness and their
 fears. The Hare is the swiftest animal in the world for the time it
 continues; and few quadrupedes can overtake even the <PB N="2" REF="5"/> rabbit
 when it has but a short way to run. To this class also we may add the
 squirrel, some∣what resembling the hare and rabbit in its form and
 nature, and equally pretty, inoffensive, and pleasing.</P>
<P>If we were methodically to distinguish animals of the hare kind
 from all others, we might say that they have but two cutting teeth above and
 two below, that they are covered with a soft downy fur, and that they have a
 bushy tail. The combination of these marks might per∣haps distinguish
 them tolerably well; whether from the rat, the beaver, the otter, or any other
 most nearly approaching in form. But, as I have declined all method that
 rather tends to embarrass history than enlighten it, I am contented to
 class these animals together for no very precise reason, but because
 I find a general resemblance between them in their natural ha∣bits, and in
 the shape of their heads and body. I call a squirrel an animal of the hare
 kind, be∣cause it is something like a hare. I call the Paca of the same
 kind, merely because it is more like a rabbit than any other animal I know
 of. In short, it is fit to erect some parti∣cular standard in the
 imagination of the reader, to refer him to some animal that he knows, in
 order to direct him in conceiving the figure of <PB N="3" REF="6"/> such as he
 does not know. Still, however, he should be apprized that his knowledge will
 be defective without an examination of each par∣ticular species; and that
 saying an animal is of this or that particular kind is but a very trifling
 part of its history.</P>
<P>Animals of the hare kind, like all others that feed entirely upon
 vegetables, are inoffensive and timorous. As Nature furnishes them with a
 most abundant supply, they have not that ra∣pacity after food remarkable in
 such as are often stinted in their provision. They are extremely active
 and amazingly swift, to which they chiefly owe their protection; for being
 the prey of every voracious animal, they are incessantly pursued. The
 hare, the rabbit, and the squirrel, are placed by Pyerius, in his Treatise
 of Ruminating Animals, among the number of those that chew the cud; but how
 far this may be true I will not pretend to determine. Certain it is that their
 lips continually move whether sleeping or waking. Nevertheless, they chew
 their meat very much before they swallow it, and for that reason I should
 suppose that it does not want a second mastication. All these animals
 use their fore-paws like hands; they are remarkably salacious, and are
 furnished by Nature with more ample powers than most others for the
 business of pro∣pagation. <PB N="4" REF="7"/> They are so very prolific,
 that were they not thinned by the constant depredations made upon them by
 most other animals, they would quickly over-run the earth.</P>
<P>Of all these the hare is the largest, the most persecuted,
 and the most timorous; all its muscles are formed for swiftness; and
 all its senses seem only given to direct its flight. It has very large
 prominent eyes, placed back∣wards in its head, so that it can almost see
 be∣hind it as it runs. These are never wholly closed; but as the animal is
 continually upon the watch, it sleeps with them open. The ears are still
 more remarkable for their size; they are moveable and capable of being
 directed to every quarter; so that the smallest sounds are readily
 received, and the animal's motions di∣rected accordingly. The muscles of the
 body are very strong, and without fat, so that it may be said to carry no
 superfluous burthen of flesh about it; the hinder feet are longer than the
 fore, which still adds to the rapidity of its mo∣tions; and almost all
 animals that are remark∣able for their speed, except the horse, are formed
 in the same manner.</P>
<P>An animal so well formed for a life of escape might be
 supposed to enjoy a state of tolerable security; but as every rapacious
 creature is its <PB N="5" REF="8"/> enemy, it but very seldom lives out its
 natural term. Dogs of all kinds pursue it by instinct, and follow the hare
 more eagerly than any other animal. The cat and the weasel kinds are
 con∣tinually lying in ambush, and practising all their little arts to
 seize it; birds of prey are still more dangerous enemies, as against them
 no swiftness can avail, nor retreat secure; but man, an ene∣my far more
 powerful than all, prefers its flesh to that of other animals, and destroys
 greater numbers than all the rest. Thus pursued and persecuted on every
 side, the race would long since have been totally extirpated, did it not
 find a resource in its amazing fertility.</P>
<P>The hare multiplies exceedingly; it is in a state of engendering
 at a few months old; the females go with young but thirty days, and ge∣nerally
 bring forth three or four at a time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon. vol.
 xiii. p. 12.</BIBL></NOTE>. As soon as they have produced their young they
 are again ready for conception, and thus do not lose any time in continuing
 the breed. But they are in another respect fitted in an extraordinary manner
 for multiplying their kind; for the fe∣male, from the conformation of her womb,
 is often seen to bring forth, and yet to continue pregnant at the same
 time; or, in other words, to have young ones of different ages in her 
 <PB N="6" REF="9"/> womb together. Other animals never receive the male when
 pregnant, but bring forth their young at once. But it is frequently different
 with the hare; the female often, though already impregnated, admitting the
 male, and thus re∣ceiving a second impregnation. The reason of this
 extraordinary circumstance is, that the womb in these animals is divided in
 such a manner that it may be considered as a double organ, one side of
 which may be filled while the other remains empty. Thus these animals may be
 seen to couple at every period of their pregnancy, and even while they are
 bringing forth young laying the foundation of another brood.</P>
<P>The young of these animals are brought forth with their eyes open,
 and the dam suckles them for twenty days, after which they leave her, and
 seek out for themselves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xiii. p.
 12.</BIBL></NOTE>. From this we observe, that the education these animals
 re∣ceive is but trifling, and the family connexion but of short duration. In
 the rapacious kinds the dam leads her young forth for months to∣gether; teaches
 them the arts of rapine; and, although she wants milk to supply them, yet
 keeps them under her care until they are able to hunt for themselves. But a
 long connexion of this kind would be very unnecessary as well 
 <PB N="7" REF="10"/> as dangerous to the timid animals we are de∣scribing;
 their food is easily procured; and their associations, instead of
 protection, would only expose them to their pursuers. They seldom,
 however, separate far from each other, or from the place where they were
 produced; but make each a form at some distance, having a predi∣lection
 rather for the place than each other's so∣ciety. They feed during the night
 rather than by day, chusing the most tender blades of grass, and
 quenching their thirst with the dew. They live also upon roots, leaves,
 fruits and corn, and prefer such plants as are furnished with a milky
 juice. They also strip the bark of trees during the winter, there being
 scarce any that they will not feed on, except the lime or the alder. They are
 particularly fond of birch, pinks, and parsley. When they are kept tame, they
 are fed with lettuce and other garden herbs; but the flesh of such as are
 thus brought up is always indifferent.</P>
<P>They sleep or repose in their forms by day, and may be said to
 live only by night<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xiii. p.
 12.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is then that they go forth to feed and couple. They do
 not pair, however, but in the rutting season, which begins in February; the
 male pursues and discovers the female by the sagacity <PB N="8" REF="11"/>
 of its nose. They are then seen, by moon∣light, playing, skipping, and
 pursuing each other; but the least motion, the slightest breeze, the
 falling of a leaf is sufficient to disturb their revels; they instantly
 fly off, and each takes a separate way.</P>
<P>As their limbs are made for running, they easily outstrip all
 other animals in the beginning; and could they preserve their speed it
 would be impossible to overtake them; but as they ex∣haust their
 strength at their first efforts, and double back to the place they were
 started from, they are more easily taken than the fox, which is a much
 slower animal than they. As their hind legs are longer than the fore, they
 always chuse to run up hill, by which the speed of their pursuers is
 diminished while theirs remains the same. Their motions are also without
 any noise, as they have the sole of the foot furnished with hair; and
 they seem the only animals that have hair on the inside of their
 mouths.</P>
<P>They seldom live above seven or eight years at the utmost;
 they come to their full perfec∣tion in a year; and this multiplied by seven,
 as in other animals, gives the extent of their lives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xiii. p. 12.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is said,
 however, that the females live longer than the males: of this Mr. Buffon makes
 a <PB N="9" REF="12"/> doubt; but I am assured that it is so. They pass
 their lives, in our climate, in solitude and silence; and they seldom are
 heard to cry, ex∣cept when they are seized or wounded. Their voice is not
 so sharp as the note of some other animals, but more nearly approaching
 that of the squalling of a child. They are not so wild as their
 dispositions and their habits seem to in∣dicate; but are of a complying
 nature, and easily susceptible of a kind of education. They are easily
 tamed. They even become fond and ca∣ressing, but they are incapable of
 attachment to any particular person, and never can be de∣pended upon; for,
 though taken never so young, they regain their native freedom at the first
 opportunity. As they have a remarkable good ear, and sit upon their hind
 legs, and use their fore-paws as hands, they have been taught to beat the
 drum, to dance to music, and go through the manual exercise.</P>
<P>But their natural instincts for their preserva∣tion are much
 more extraordinary than those artificial tricks that are taught them. They
 make themselves a form particularly in those places where the colour of the
 grass most re∣sembles that of their skin; it is open to the south in
 winter and to the north in summer. The hare, when it hears the hounds at a
 di∣stance, <PB N="10" REF="13"/> flies for some time through a natural
 impulse, without managing its strength, or consulting any other means but
 speed for its safety. Having attained some hill or rising ground, and
 left the dogs so far behind that it no longer hears their cries, it stops,
 rears on its hinder legs, and at length looks back to see if it has not
 lost its pursuers. But these, having once fallen upon the scent,
 pursue slowly and with united skill, and the poor animal soon again
 hears the fatal tidings of their approach. Sometimes when sore hunted it will
 start a fresh hare, and squat in the same form; sometimes it will
 creep under the door of a sheep-cot, and hide among the sheep; sometimes
 it will run among them, and no vigilance can drive it from the flock; some
 will enter holes like the rabbit, which the hunters call going to
 <HI>vault</HI>; some will go up one side of the hedge and come down the
 other; and it has been known that an hare sorely hunted has got upon the top
 of a cut quick-set hedge, and run a good way there∣on, by which it has
 effectually evaded the hounds. It is no unusual thing also for them to
 betake themselves to furz bushes, and to leap from one to another, by which
 the dogs are frequently misled. However, the first doubling an hare makes
 is generally a key to <PB N="11" REF="14"/> all its future attempts of that
 kind, the latter being exactly like the former. The young hares tread heavier,
 and leave a stronger scent than the old, because their limbs are weaker;
 and the more this forlorn creature tires, the heavier it treads, and the
 stronger is the scent it leaves. A buck, or male hare, is known by its
 chusing to run upon hard highways, feeding farther from the wood-sides and
 making its doublings of a greater compass than the female. The male having
 made a turn or two about its form, frequently leads the hounds five or six
 miles on a stretch; but the female keeps close by some covert side,
 turns, crosses, and winds among the bushes like a rabbit, and seldom
 runs directly forward. In general, however, both male and female regulate their
 conduct according to the weather. In a moist day they hold by the high∣ways
 more than at any other time, because the scent is then strongest upon
 the grass. If they come to the side of a grove or spring they for∣bear to
 enter, but squat down by the side thereof until the hounds have overshot
 them; and then, turning along their former path, make to their old form, from
 which they vainly hope for pro∣tection.</P>
<P>Hares are divided, by the hunters, into mountain and measled
 hares. The former are <PB N="12" REF="15"/> more swift, vigorous, and have
 their flesh better tasted; the latter chiefly frequent the marshes, when
 hunted keep among low grounds, and their flesh is moist, white, and flabby.
 When the male and female keep one particular spot, they will not suffer any
 strange hare to make its form in the same quarter, so that it is
 usually said that the more you hunt the more hares you shall have; for,
 having killed one hare, others come and take possession of its form.
 Many of these animals are found to live in woods and thickets, but they are
 naturally fonder of the open country, and are constrained only by fear to
 take shelter in places that afford them neither a warm sun nor an agreeable
 pasture. They are therefore, usually seen stealing out of the edges of
 the wood to taste the grass that grows shorter and sweeter in the open
 fields than under the shade of the trees; however, they seldom miss of
 being pursued; and every excursion is a new adventure. They are shot at
 by poachers; traced by their footsteps in the snow; caught in springs;
 dogs, birds, and cats, are all combined against them; ants, snakes, and
 adders, drive them from their forms, especially in summer; even fleas, from
 which most other animals are free, persecute this poor creature; and, so
 va∣rious are its enemies, that it is seldom permitted <PB N="13" REF="16"/> to
 reach even that short term to which it is li∣mited by nature.</P>
<P>The soil and climate have their influence upon this animal as well
 as on most others. In the countries bordering on the north pole, they become
 white in winter, and are often seen in great troops of four or five hundred,
 running along the banks of the river Irtish, or the Je∣nisca, and as white
 as the snow they tread on. They are caught in toils for the sake of their
 skins, which on the spot are sold for less than seven shillings an
 hundred. Their fur is well known to form a considerable article in the hat
 manufacture; and we accordingly import vast quantities of it from those
 countries where the hare abounds in such plenty. They are found also
 entirely black, but these in much less quan∣tity than the former<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Klein Disp. Quadrup. p. 52.</BIBL></NOTE>; and even some
 have been seen with horns, though these but rarely<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Jonston de Quad. L. ii. C. 2.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The hares of the hot countries, particularly in Italy, Spain, and
 Barbary, are smaller than ours: those bred in the Milanese country are
 said to be the best in Europe<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dictionnaire Raisonée Lievre.</BIBL></NOTE>. There
 is scarce a country where this animal is not to be found, from the torrid
 zone to the neighbourhood of the polar circle. The natives of Guinea 
 <PB N="14" REF="17"/> knock them on the head as they come down to the sides of
 the rivers to drink. They also sur∣round the place where they are seen in
 numbers, and clattering a short stick, which every man carries, against
 that which the person next him carries, they diminish their circle
 gradually, till the hares are cooped up in the midst. They then all together
 throw their sticks in among them, and with such deadly force, that they
 seldom fail of killing great numbers at a time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hist. Gen. des Voyages, tom iv. p. 171.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The flesh of this animal has been esteemed as a delicacy among
 some nations, and is held in detestation by others. The Jews, the ancient
 Britains, and the Mahometans, all considered it as an unclean animal, and
 religiously ab∣stained from it. On the contrary, there are scarce any
 other people, however barbarous, at present, that do not consider it as the
 most agreeable food. Fashion seems to preside and govern all the
 senses; what mankind at one time consider as beautiful, fragrant, or
 sa∣voury, may at another time, or among another nation, be regarded as
 deformed, disgustful, or ill tasted. That flesh which the ancient
 Romans so much admired as to call it the food of the wise, was, among the
 Jews and the Druids, thought unfit to be eaten; and even the mo∣derns, 
 <PB N="15" REF="18"/> who like the Romans consider the flesh of this animal
 as a delicacy, have very different ideas as to dressing it. With us it is
 simply serv'd up without any seasoning; but Apicius shews us the
 manner of dressing an hare in true Roman taste, with parsley, rice,
 vinegar, cummin seed, and coriander<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vid.
 Apicii, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE RABBIT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hare and the Rabbit, though so very nearly resembling each
 other in form and dis∣position, are yet distinct kinds, as they refuse
 to mix with each other. Mr. Buffon bred up several of both kinds in the
 same place; but from being at first indifferent, they soon be∣came
 enemies; and their combats were gene∣rally continued until one of them was
 disabled or destroyed. However, though these experi∣ments were not
 attended with success, I am as∣sured that nothing is more frequent than
 an animal bred between these two, which, like all other mules, is marked with
 sterility. Nay, it has been actually known that the rabbit couples with
 animals of a much more distant nature; and there is at present in the
 Museum at Brus∣sels, a creature covered with feathers and hair, and
 said to be bred between a rabbit and an hen.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19"/>The fecundity of the rabbit is still greater
 than that of the hare; and if we should calculate the produce from a single
 pair, in one year, the number would be amazing. They breed seven times in a
 year, and bring eight young ones each time. On a supposition, therefore,
 that this happens regularly, at the end of four years, a couple of rabbits
 shall see a progeny of almost a million and an half. From hence we might
 justly apprehend being overstocked by their encrease; but, happily for
 mankind, their enemies are numerous, and their nature inoffensive; so that
 their destruction bears a near proportion to their fertility.</P>
<P>But although their numbers be diminished by every beast and
 bird of prey, and still more by man himself, yet there is no danger of
 their ex∣tirpation. The hare is a poor defenceless animal, that has nothing
 but its swiftness to depend on for safety; its numbers are, therefore,
 every day de∣creasing; and in countries that are well peopled, the species
 are so much kept under, that laws are made for their preservation. Still,
 however, it is most likely that they will be at last totally de∣stroyed;
 and, like the wolf or the elk in some countries, be only kept in remembrance.
 But it is otherwise with the rabbit, its fecundity being greater, and its
 means of safety more certain. <PB N="17" REF="20"/> The hare seems to have
 more various arts and instincts to escape its pursuers, by doubling,
 squatting, and winding; the rabbit has but one art of defence alone, but in
 that one finds safety; by making itself a hole, where it con∣tinues a great
 part of the day, and breeds up its young; there it continues secure from the
 fox, the hound, the kite, and every other enemy.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, though this retreat be safe and convenient, the
 rabbit does not seem to be naturally fond of keeping there. It loves the
 sunny field and the open pasture; it seems to be a chilly animal, and
 dislikes the coldness of its under-ground habitation. It is, therefore,
 continually out, when it does not fear disturb∣ance; and the female often
 brings forth her young, at a distance from the warren, in an hole, not above
 a foot deep at the most. There she suckles them for about a month;
 covering them over with moss and grass, when∣ever she goes to pasture,
 and scratching them up at her return. It has been said, indeed, that this
 shallow hole without the warren, is made lest the male should attack and
 destroy her young; but I have seen the male himself attend the young
 there, lead them out to feed, and conduct them back upon the return of the dam.
 This external retreat seems a kind of <PB N="18" REF="21"/> country house,
 at a distance from the general habitation; it is usually made near some
 spot of excellent pasture, or in the midst of a field of sprouting
 corn. To this both male and fe∣male often retire from the warren; lead their
 young by night to the food which lies so con∣venient, and, if not
 disturbed, continue there till they are perfectly grown up. There they find a
 greater variety of pasture than near the warren, which is generally eaten
 bare; and en∣joy a warmer sun, by covering themselves up in a shallower
 hole. Whenever they are distur∣bed, they then forsake their retreat of
 pleasure, for one of safety; they fly to the warren with their utmost
 speed; and, if the way be short, there is scarce any dog, how swift
 soever, that can overtake them.</P>
<P>But it does not always happen that these animals are
 possessed of one of these external apartments; they most usually
 bring forth their young in the warren, but always in a hole, se∣parate from
 the male. On these occasions, the female digs herself an hole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, different from the ordinary one, by
 being more intricate; at the bottom of which she makes a more ample
 apartment. This done, she pulls off from her belly a good quantity of her
 hair, with which she <PB N="19" REF="22"/> makes a kind of bed for her young.
 During the two first days she never leaves them; and does not stir out
 but to procure nourishment, which she takes with the utmost dispatch;
 in this manner suckling her young, for near six weeks, until they are
 strong, and able to go abroad themselves. During all this time, the male
 seldom visits their separate apartment; but when they are grown up, so
 as to come to the mouth of the hole, he then seems to acknow∣ledge them as
 his offspring, takes them be∣tween his paws, smooths their skin, and licks
 their eyes; all of them, one after the other, have an equal share in his
 caresses.</P>
<P>In this manner the rabbit, when wild, con∣sults its pleasure
 and its safety; but those that are bred up tame, do not take the trouble of
 digging an hole, conscious of being already protected. It has also been
 observed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, that when
 people, to make a warren, stock it with tame rabbits, these animals, having
 been un∣accustomed to the art of scraping an hole, con∣tinue exposed to
 the weather, and every other accident, without ever burrowing. Their im∣mediate
 offspring also are equally regardless of their safety; and it is not till
 after two or three generations, that these animals begin to find 
 <PB N="20" REF="23"/> the necessity and convenience of an asylum, and
 practise an art which they could only learn from nature.</P>
<P>Rabbits of the domestic breed, like all other animals that are
 under the protection of man, are of various colours; white, brown, black, and
 mouse colour. The black are the most scarce; the brown, white, and
 mouse colour, are in greater plenty. Most of the wild rabbits are of a
 brown, and it is the colour which pre∣vails among the species; for, in every
 nest of rabbits, whether the parents be black or white, there are some
 brown ones found of the number. But, in England, there are many warrens
 stocked with the mouse colour kinds, which some say came originally
 from an island in the river Humber, and which still continue their original
 colour, after a great number of successive generations. A gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. Moutier, as quoted by Mr. Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>,
 who bred up tame rabbits for his amusement, gives the following account of
 their production. I began, says he, by having but one male and female only;
 the male was entirely white, and the female brown; but, in their posterity,
 the number of the brown by far exceeded those of any other colour: there were
 some white, some party-coloured, and some black. It is sur∣prizing 
 <PB N="21" REF="24"/> how much the descendants were obe∣dient and
 submissive to their common parent; he was easily distinguished from
 the rest by his superior whiteness; and, however numerous the other males
 were, this kept them all in sub∣jection. Whenever they quarrelled among each
 other, either for their females or pro∣visions, as soon as he heard the
 noise he ran up to them with all dispatch, and, upon his ap∣pearance, all
 was instantly reduced to peace and order. If he caught any of them in the
 fact, he instantly punished them, as an example to the rest. Another
 instance of his superiority was, that having accustomed them to come to
 me with the call of a whistle, the instant this signal was given, I saw
 him marshalling them up, leading them the foremost, and then suffering
 them all to file off before him.</P>
<P>The rabbit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. Moutier, as quoted by
 Mr. Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, though less than the hare, ge∣nerally lives
 longer. As these animals pass the greater part of their lives in their
 burrow, where they continue at ease and unmolested, they have nothing to
 prevent the regularity of their health, or the due course of their
 nourish∣ment. They are, therefore, generally found fatter than the hare; but
 their flesh is, notwith∣standing, much less delicate. That of the 
 <PB N="22" REF="25"/> old ones, in particular, is hard, tough and dry; but it is
 said, that, in warmer countries, they are better tasted. This may very well
 be, as the rabbit, though so very plenty in Great Britain and Ireland, is,
 nevertheless, a native of the warmer climates; and has been originally
 imported into these kingdoms, from Spain. In that country, and in some of
 the islands in the Mediterranean, we are told, that they once multiplied in
 such numbers as to prove the greatest nuisance to the natives. They at
 first demanded military aid to destroy them; but soon after they called
 in the assistance of ferrets, which originally came from Africa, and
 these, with much more ease and expedition, contrived to lessen the
 calamity. In fact, rabbits are found to love a warm climate, and to be
 inca∣pable of bearing the cold of the north; so that in Sweden they are
 obliged to be littered in the houses. It is otherwise in all the tropical
 cli∣mates, where they are extremely common, and where they seldom burrow, as
 with us. The English countries that are most noted for these animals, are
 Lincolnshire, Norfolk, and Cam∣bridgeshire. They delight in grounds of a
 sandy soil, which are warmer than those of clay; and which also
 furnish a softer and finer pasture.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26"/>The tame rabbits are larger than the wild
 ones, from their taking more nourishment, and using less exercise; but
 their flesh is not so good, being more insipid and softer. In order to
 im∣prove it, they are chiefly fed upon bran, and are stinted in their water;
 for, if indulged in too great a plenty of moist food, they are apt, as the
 feeders express it, to grow rotten. The hair or fur is a very useful
 commodity, and is employed in England for several purposes, as well when
 the skin is dressed with it on, as when it is pulled off. The skins,
 especially the white, are used for lining cloaths, and are considered as
 a cheap imitation of ermine. The skin of the male is usually preferred, as
 being the most lasting, but it is coarser; that on the belly in either
 sex, is the best and finest. But the chief use made of rabbit's fur, is
 in the manufacture of hats; it is always mixed, in certain propor∣tions, with
 the fur of the beaver; and it is said to give the latter more strength and
 consist∣ence.</P>
<P>The Syrian rabbit, like all other animals bred in that country, is
 remarkable for the length of its hair; it falls along the sides in wavy
 wreaths, and is, in some places, curled at the end, like wool; it is shed
 once a year in large masses; and it often happens that the rabbit, dragging
 a <PB N="24" REF="27"/> part of its robe on the ground, appears as if it had got
 another leg, or a longer tail. There are no rabbits naturally in America;
 however, those that have been carried from Europe, are found to multiply in
 the West India islands in great abundance. In other parts of that
 con∣tinent, they have animals that in some measure resemble the rabbits
 of Europe; and which most European travellers have often called hares or
 rabbits, as they happened to be large or small. Their giving them even the
 name will be a sufficient excuse for my placing them among animals of the
 hare kind; although they may differ in many of the most essential
 particulars. But before we go to the new continent, we will first examine
 such as bear even a distant resemblance to the hare kind at home.</P>

<HEAD>THE SQUIRREL.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few readers that are not as well acquainted with the
 figure of a Squirrel as that of the rabbit; but supposing it unknown to
 any, we might give them some idea of its form, by comparing it to a rabbit,
 with shorter ears, and a longer tail. The tail, indeed, is alone sufficient
 to distinguish it from all others, as it is extremely long, beautiful and
 bushy, <PB N="25" REF="28"/> spreading like a fan, and which, when thrown up
 behind, covers the whole body. This serves the little animal for a double
 purpose; when erected, it serves, like an umbrella, as a se∣cure
 protection from the injuries of the heat and cold; and when extended, it is
 very instru∣mental in promoting these vast leaps that the squirrel
 takes from tree to tree: nay, some as∣sert that it answers still a
 third purpose, and when the squirrel takes water, which it some∣times
 does upon a piece of bark, that its tail serves it instead of a sail<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Klein. Linnaeus.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are few wild animals in which there are so many varieties
 as in the squirrel. The <HI>common squirrel</HI> is of the size of a
 small rabbit, and is rather of a more reddish brown. The belly and breast
 are white; and the ears beau∣tifully ornamented with long tufts of hair, of a
 deeper colour than that on the body. The eyes are large, black and lively; the
 legs are short and muscular, like those of the rabbit; but the toes
 longer, and the claws sharper, so as to fit it for climbing. When it eats,
 or dresses itself, it sits erect, like the hare or rab∣bit, making
 use of its fore legs as hands; and chiefly resides in trees. The <HI>grey
 Virginian squir∣rel,</HI> which Mr. Buffon calls the Petit Gris, is 
 <PB N="26" REF="29"/> larger than a rabbit, and of a greyish colour. Its body
 and limbs are thicker than those of the common squirrel; and its ears are
 shorter, and without tufts at the point. The upper part of the body, and
 external part of the legs, are of a fine whitish grey, with a beautiful red
 streak on each side lengthways. The tail is covered with very long grey
 hair, variegated with black and white towards the extremity. This variety
 seems to be common to both continents; and in Sweden is seen to change
 colour in winter. The <HI>Barbary squirrel,</HI> of which Mr. Buffon makes
 three varieties, is of a mixed colour, between red and black. Along the sides
 there are white and brown lines, which render this animal very beautiful; but
 what still adds to its elegance is, that the belly is of a sky blue,
 surrounded with white. Some of these hold up the tail erect; and others
 throw it forward over their body. The <HI>Siberian white squirrel</HI> is of
 the size of a common squirrel. The <HI>Carolina black squirrel</HI> is
 much bigger than the former, and sometimes tipt with white at all the
 extremities. The <HI>Brasilian squirrel,</HI> which Mr. Buffon calls the
 Coquallin, is a beautiful animal of this kind, and very remarkable for the
 variety of its colours. Its belly is of a bright yellow; its head and body
 variegated with white, black, <PB N="27" REF="30"/> brown and orange colour. It
 wants the tufts at the extremity of its ears; and does not climb trees, as
 most of the kind are seen to do. To this list may be added the <HI>little
 ground squirrel of Carolina,</HI> of a reddish colour, and blackish
 stripes on each side; and, like the former, not delighting in trees.
 Lastly, the <HI>squirrel of New Spain,</HI> which is of a deep iron-grey
 colour, with seven longitudinal whitish streaks along the sides of the
 male, and five along those of the female. As for the flying squirrels, they
 are a distinct kind, and shall be treated of by themselves.</P>
<P>These, which I suppose to be but a few of the numerous
 varieties of the squirrel, suf∣ficiently serve to shew how
 extensively this animal is diffused over all parts of the world. It is not
 to be supposed, however, that every variety is capable of sustaining
 every climate; for few animals are so tender, or so little able to endure a
 change of abode, as this. Those bred in the tropical climates, will only live
 near a warm sun; while, on the contrary, the squirrel of Siberia will
 scarce endure the tem∣perature of ours. These varieties do not only differ
 in their constitutions and colour, but in their dispositions also; for
 while some live on the tops of trees, others feed, like rabbits, 
 <PB N="28" REF="31"/> on vegetables below. Whether any of these, so
 variously coloured, and so differently dis∣posed, would breed among
 each other, we can∣not tell: and since, therefore, we are left in uncertainty
 upon this point, we are at liberty either to consider each as a distinct
 species by itself; or only a variety, that accident might have originally
 produced, and that the climate or soil might have continued. For my own part,
 as the original character of the squirrel is so strongly marked upon them
 all, I cannot help considering them in the latter point of view; rather as
 the common descendants of one parent, than originally formed with such
 distinct similitudes.</P>
<P>The squirrel is a beautiful little animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, which is but half savage; and
 which, from the gentleness and innocence of its manners, de∣serves our
 protection. It is neither carnivorous nor hurtful; its usual food is fruits,
 nuts and acorns; it is cleanly, nimble, active, and in∣dustrious; its eyes
 are sparkling, and its physi∣ognomy marked with meaning. It generally, like
 the hare and rabbit, sits up on its hinder legs, and uses the fore paws as
 hands; these have five claws or toes, as they are called, and one of them is
 separated from the rest like a <PB N="29" REF="32"/> thumb. This animal
 seems to approach the nature of birds, from its lightness, and
 sur∣prizing agility on the tops of trees. It seldom descends to the
 ground, except in case of storms, but jumps from one branch to another;
 feeds, in spring, on the buds and young shoots; in summer, on the
 ripening fruits; and par∣ticularly the young cones of the pine-tree. In autumn
 it has an extensive variety to feast upon; the acorn, the philberd, the
 chestnut, and the wilding. This season of plenty, however, is not spent
 in idle enjoyment; the provident little animal gathers at that time its
 provisions for the winter; and cautiously foresees the sea∣son when
 the forest shall be stripped of its leaves and fruitage</P>
<P>Its nest is generally formed among the large branches of a great
 tree, where they begin to fork off into small ones. After chusing the place
 where the timber begins to decay, and an hollow may the more easily be
 formed, the squirrel begins by making a kind of level be∣tween the forks; and
 then bringing moss, twigs, and dry leaves, it binds them together with great
 art, so as to resist the most violent storm. This is covered up on
 all sides; and has but a single opening at top, which is just large
 enough to admit the little animal; and <PB N="30" REF="33"/> this opening is
 itself defended from the wea∣ther by a kind of canopy, made in the fashion
 of a cone, so that it throws off the rain, though never so heavy. The
 nest thus formed, with a very little opening above, is, nevertheless, very
 commodious and roomy below; soft, well knit together, and every way
 convenient and warm. In this retreat the little animal brings forth its young,
 shelters itself from the scorching heat of the sun, which it seems to
 fear, and from the storms and the inclemency of winter, which it is still
 less capable of supporting. Its provision of nuts and acorns is seldom
 in its nest, but in the hollows of the tree, laid up carefully to∣gether, and
 never touched but in cases of ne∣cessity. Thus one single tree serves
 for a retreat and a store-house; and without leaving it during the winter,
 the squirrel possesses all those enjoy∣ments that its nature is
 capable of receiving. But it sometimes happens that its little mansion is
 attacked by a deadly and powerful foe. The martin goes often in quest of a
 retreat for its young, which it is incapable of making for itself; for this
 reason it fixes upon the nest of a squirrel, and, with double
 injustice, destroys the tenant, and then takes possession of the
 mansion.</P>
<P>However, this is a calamity that but seldom <PB N="31" REF="34"/>
 happens: and, of all other animals, the squirrel leads the most
 frolicksome playful life; being surrounded with abundance, and having few
 enemies to fear. They are in heat early in the spring; when, as a modern
 naturalist says<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British
 Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>, it is very diverting to see the female feigning an
 escape from the pursuit of two or three males, and to observe the various
 proofs which they give of their agility, which is then exerted in full force.
 Nature seems to have been particular in her formation of these animals for
 propagation: however, they seldom bring forth above four or five young at a
 time; and that but once a year. The time of their gestation seems to be
 about six weeks; they are pregnant in the be∣ginning of April, and bring
 forth about the middle of May.</P>
<P>The squirrel is never found in the open fields, nor yet in
 copses or underwoods; it always keeps in the midst of the tallest trees,
 and, as much as possible, shuns the habitations of men. It is extremely
 watchful; if the tree in which it resides be but touched at the bottom, the
 squir∣rel instantly takes the alarm, quits its nest, at once flies off to
 another tree, and thus travels, with great ease, along the tops of the
 forest, until it finds itself perfectly out of danger. In 
 <PB N="32" REF="35"/> this manner it continues for some hours at a distance
 from home, until the alarm be past away; and then it returns, by paths that
 to all quadrupedes but itself are utterly impassable. Its usual way of
 moving is by bounds; these it takes from one tree to another, at forty feet
 distance; and if at any time it is obliged to de∣scend, it runs up the
 side of the next tree with amazing facility. It has an extremely sharp
 piercing note, which most usually expresses pain; it has another, more
 like the purring of a cat, which it employs when pleased; at least it
 ap∣peared so in that from whence I have taken a part of this
 description.</P>
<P>In Lapland, and the extensive forests to the north, the
 squirrels are observed to change their habitation, and to remove in vast
 numbers from one country to another. In these mi∣grations they are generally
 seen by thousands, travelling directly forward; while neither rocks,
 forests, nor even the broadest waters can stop their progress. What I
 am going to relate, appears so extraordinary, that were it not at∣tested by
 numbers of the most credible histo∣rians, among whom are Klein and
 Linnaeus, it might be rejected, with that scorn with which we treat
 imposture or credulity: however, nothing can be more true than, that when

 in their progress, meet with broad rivers, or extensive lakes, which abound
 in Lapland, they take a very extraordinary me∣thod of crossing them. Upon
 approaching the banks, and perceiving the breadth of the water, they return as
 if by common consent, into the neighbouring forest, each in quest of a
 piece of bark, which answers all the purposes of boats for wafting them
 over. When the whole com∣pany are fitted in this manner, they boldly com∣mit
 their little fleet to the waves; every squirrel sitting on its own piece of
 bark, and fanning the air with its tail, to drive the vessel to its
 desired port. In this orderly manner they set forward, and often cross
 lakes several miles broad. But it too often happens that the poor mariners
 are not aware of the dangers of their navigation; for although at the edge of
 the wa∣ter it is generally calm, in the midst it is always more turbulent.
 There the slightest additional gust of wind oversets the little
 sailor and his vessel together. The whole navy, that but a few minutes
 before rode proudly and securely along, is now overturned, and a shipwreck
 of two or three thousand sail ensues. This, which is so unfortunate for
 the little animal, is gene∣rally the most lucky accident in the world for the
 Laplander on the shore; who gathers up the <PB N="34" REF="40"/> dead bodies
 as they are thrown in by the waves, eats the flesh, and sells the skins
 for about a shilling the dozen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Oeuvres de
 Regnard.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The squirrel is easily tamed, and it is then a very familiar
 animal. It loves to lie warm, and will often creep into a man's pocket or his
 bosom. It is usually kept in a box, and fed with hazle nuts. Some find
 amusement in ob∣serving with what ease it bites the nut open and eats the
 kernel. In short, it is a pleasing pretty little domestic; and its tricks
 and habitudes may serve to entertain a mind unequal to stronger
 operations.</P>

<HEAD>THE FLYING SQUIRREL.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. Ray was justly of opinion that the Flying Squirrel might
 more properly be said to be of the rat kind, because its fur is shorter
 than in other squirrels, and its colours also more nearly approach the
 former. However, as mankind have been content to class it among the
 squir∣rels, it is scarcely worth making a new distinc∣tion in its favour.
 This little animal, which is frequently brought over to England, is less than
 a common squirrel and bigger than a field mouse. Its skin is very soft,
 and elegantly adorned with a dark fur in some places and light grey in
 others. <PB REF="41"/>

 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="35" REF="44"/> It has
 large prominent black and very sparkling eyes, small ears, and very sharp
 teeth, with which it gnaws any thing quickly. When it does not leap, its tail,
 which is pretty enough, lies close to its back; but when it takes its
 spring, the tail is moved backwards and for∣wards from side to side. It
 is said to partake somewhat of the nature of the squirrel, of the rat,
 and of the dormouse; but that in which it is distinguished from all other
 animals, is its peculiar conformation for taking those leaps that almost
 look like flying. It is, indeed, amaz∣ing to see it at one bound dart above
 an hun∣dred yards, from one tree to another. They are assisted in this
 spring by a very peculiar for∣mation of the skin, that extends from the
 fore-feet to the hinder; so that when the animal stretches its fore-legs
 forward and its hind-legs backward, this skin is spread out between them,
 somewhat like that between the legs of a bat. The surface of the body being
 thus encreased, the little animal keeps buoyant in the air until the force of
 its first impulsion is expired, and then it descends. This skin, when
 the creature is at rest, or walking, continues wrinkled up on its sides;
 but when its limbs are extended, it forms a kind of web between them of above
 an inch broad on either side, and gives the <PB N="36" REF="45"/> whole body
 the appearance of a skin floating in the air. In this manner the flying
 squirrel changes place, not like a bird, by repeated strokes of its wings,
 but rather like a paper kite supported by the expansion of the surface of
 its body; but with this difference, however, that, being naturally heavier than
 the air, in∣stead of mounting it descends; and that jump which upon the
 ground would not be above forty yards, when from an higher tree to a lower may
 be above an hundred.</P>
<P>This little animal is more common in Ame∣rica than in Europe, but
 not very commonly to be seen in either. It is usually found, like the
 squirrel, on the tops of trees; but, though better fitted for leaping, it is
 of a more torpid disposition, and is seldom seen to exert its powers;
 so that it is often seized by the pole∣cat and the martin. It is easily
 tamed, but apt to break away whenever it finds an opportunity. It does not
 seem fond of nuts or almonds, like other squirrels, but is chiefly
 pleased with the sprouts of the birch and the cones of the pine. It is fed
 in its tame state with bread and fruits; it generally sleeps by day, and is
 always most active by night. Some naturalists gravely caution us not to let
 it get among our corn fields, where they tell us it will do a great deal of
 damage, <PB REF="46"/>

</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="50"/>FROM the description of the squirrel and
 its varieties we proceed to a different tribe of animals, no way indeed
 resembling the squirrel, but still something like the rabbit and the
 hare. We are to keep these two animals still in view as the center of our
 comparison; as objects to which many others may bear some similitude,
 though they but little approach each other. Among the hare kind is the Marmout,
 which naturalists have placed either among the hare kind or the rat kind, as
 it suited their respective systems. In fact, it bears no great
 resemblance to either; but of the two it approaches much nearer the hare, as
 well in the make of its head as in its size, in its bushy tail, and
 particularly in its chewing the cud, which alone is sufficient to determine
 our choice in giving it its present situation. How it ever came to be
 degraded into the rat or the mouse I cannot conceive, for it no way
 resembles them in size, being near as <PB REF="51"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="37" REF="52"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="38" REF="53"/> big as an
 hare; or in its disposition, since no animal is more tractable nor more
 easily tamed.</P>
<P>The Marmout is, as was said, almost as big as an hare, but it
 is more corpulent than a cat, and has shorter legs. Its head pretty nearly
 re∣sembles that of an hare, except that its ears are much shorter. It is
 cloathed all over with very long hair, and a shorter fur below. These are
 of different colours, black and grey. The length of the hair gives the body the
 appearance of greater corpulence than it really has, and at the same time
 shortens the feet so that its belly seems touching the ground. Its tail
 is tufted and well furnished with hair, and it is carried in a straight
 direction with its body. It has five claws behind and only four before. These
 it uses as the squirrel does, to carry its food to its mouth; and it
 usually sits upon its hinder parts to feed in the manner of that little
 animal.</P>
<P>The marmout is chiefly a native of the Alps; and when taken young
 is tamed more easily than any other wild animal, and almost as perfectly as
 any of those that are domestic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buffon, from whence
 the remainder of this descrip∣tion is taken. <HI>N. B.</HI> He takes it from 
 <BIBL>Cesner, vol. xvii.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is readily taught to
 dance, to wield a cudgel, and to obey the voice of its master. Like the cat,
 it <PB N="39" REF="54"/> has an antipathy to the dog; and when it be∣comes
 familiar to the family, and is sure of being supported by its master, it
 attacks and bites even the largest mastiff. From its squat muscular
 make, it has great strength joined to great agility. It has four large
 cutting teeth, like all those of the hare kind, but it uses them to much
 more advantage, since in this animal they are very formidable weapons of
 defence. However, it is in general a very inoffensive animal; and, ex∣cept
 its enmity to dogs, seems to live in friend∣ship with every creature,
 unless when provoked. If not prevented, it is very apt to gnaw the furni∣ture
 of an house, and even to make holes through wooden partitions; from whence,
 perhaps, it has been compared to the rat. As its legs are very short, and
 made somewhat like those of a bear, it is often seen sitting up, and
 even walk∣ing on its hind legs in like manner; but with the fore-paws, as was
 said, it uses to feed itself in the manner of a squirrel. Like all of
 the hare kind, it runs much swifter up hill than down; it climbs trees with
 great ease, and runs up the clefts of rocks, or the contiguous walls of
 houses, with great facility. It is ludicrously said that the Savoyards,
 who are the only chimney-sweepers of Paris, have learned this 
 <PB N="38" REF="55"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
 <PB N="39" REF="56"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
 <PB N="40" REF="57"/> art from the marmout, which is bred in the same
 country.</P>
<P>These animals eat indiscriminately of what∣ever is presented
 to them; flesh, bread, fruits, herbs, roots, pulse, and insects. But they
 are particularly fond of milk and butter. Although less inclined to petty
 thefts than the cat, yet they always try to steal into the dairy, where they
 lap up the milk like a cat, purring all the while like that animal, as an
 expression of their being pleased. As to the rest, milk is the only
 liquor they like. They seldom drink water, and refuse wine. When pleased
 or caressed, they often yelp like puppies; but when irritated or frighted,
 they have a piercing note that hurts the ear. They are very cleanly animals,
 and like the cat retire upon necessary occasions; but their bodies have a
 disagreeable scent, parti∣cularly in the heat of summer. This tinctures
 their flesh, which, being very fat and firm, would be very good, were not
 this flavour al∣ways found to predominate.</P>
<P>We have hitherto been describing affections in this animal which
 it has in common with many others; but we now come to one which particularly
 distinguishes it from all others of this kind, and, indeed, from every
 other qua∣drupede except the bat and the dormouse. <PB N="41" REF="58"/> This
 is its sleeping during the winter. The marmout, though a native of the
 highest moun∣tains, and where the snow is never wholly melted,
 nevertheless seems to feel the influence of the cold more than any other,
 and in a man∣ner has all its faculties chilled up in winter. This extraordinary
 suspension of life and mo∣tion for more than half the year, deserves
 our wonder, and excites our attention to consider the manner of such a
 temporary death, and the subsequent revival. But first to describe,
 be∣fore we attempt to discuss.</P>
<P>The marmout, usually at the end of Sep∣tember, or the beginning
 of October, prepares to fit up its habitation for the winter, from which it is
 never seen to issue till about the be∣ginning or the middle of April.
 This animal's little retreat is made with great precaution, and fitted up with
 art. It is an hole on the side of a mountain, extremely deep, with a
 spacious apartment at the bottom, which is rather longer than it is broad. In
 this several marmouts can reside at the same time, without crowding each
 other, or injuring the air they breathe. The feet and claws of this animal
 seem made for digging; and, in fact, they burrow into the ground with amazing
 facility, scraping up the <PB N="42" REF="59"/> earth like a rabbit, and
 throwing back what they have thus loosened behind them. But the form of their
 hole is still more wonderful; it resembles the letter Y; the two branches
 being two openings, which conduct into one channel which terminates in their
 general apartment that lies at the bottom. As the whole is made on the
 declivity of a mountain, there is no part of it on a level but the apartment at
 the end. One of the branches or openings issues out, sloping downwards;
 and this serves as a kind of sink or drain to the whole family, where they
 make their excrements, and where the moisture of the place is drawn away. The
 other branch, on the contrary, slopes upwards, and this serves as their
 door upon which to go out and in. The apartment at the end is very warmly
 stuccoed round with moss and hay, of both which they make an ample
 provision dur∣ing the summer. As this is a work of great labour, so it is
 undertaken in common; some cut the finest grass, others gather it, and
 others take their turns to drag it into their hole. Upon this occasion, as we
 are told, one of them lies on its back, permits the hay to be heaped upon its
 belly, keeps its paws upright to make greater room; and in this manner, lying
 still <PB N="43" REF="60"/> upon its back, it is dragged by the tail, hay and
 all, to their common retreat. This also some give as a reason for the
 hair being generally worn away on their backs, as is usually the case;
 how∣ever, a better reason for this may be assigned, from their
 continually rooting up holes and passing through narrow openings. But, be
 this as it will, certain it is that they all live together, and work in common
 to make their habitation as snug and convenient as possible. In it they
 pass three parts of their lives; into it they retire when the storm is
 high; in it they continue while it rains; there they remain when
 apprehen∣sive of danger, and never stir out except in fine weather, never
 going far from home even then. Whenever they venture abroad, one is placed as a
 centinel, sitting upon a lofty rock, while the rest amuse themselves in
 playing along the green fields, or are employed in cutting grass and making
 hay for their winter's convenience. Their trusty centinel, when an enemy, a
 man, a dog, or a bird of prey, approaches, apprizes its companions with a
 whistle, upon which they all make home, the centinel himself bringing up
 the rear.</P>
<P>But it must not be supposed that this hay is designed for
 provision; on the contrary, it is <PB N="42" REF="61"/>

 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="44" REF="63"/> always
 found in as great plenty in their holes at the end as at the beginning of
 winter; it is only sought for the convenience of their lodging, and the
 advantages of their young. As to pro∣vision, they seem kindly apprized by
 Nature that during the winter that they shall not want any, so that they
 make no preparations for food, though so diligently employed in fitting up
 their abode. As soon as they perceive the first approaches of the winter,
 during which their vital motions are to continue in some measure
 suspended, they labour very diligently to close up the two en∣trances of
 their habitation, which they effect with such solidity, that it is easier
 to dig up the earth any where else than where they have closed it. At that
 time they are very fat, and some of them are found to weigh above twenty
 pounds; they continue so for even three months more; but by degrees their
 flesh begins to waste, and they are usually very lean by the end of
 winter. When their retreat is opened, the whole family is then discovered,
 each rolled into a ball, and covered up under the hay. In this state they
 seem entirely lifeless; they may be taken away, and even killed without
 their testifying any great pain; and those who find them in this manner
 carry them home in order <PB N="45" REF="64"/> to breed up the young and eat the
 old ones. A gradual and gentle warmth revives them; but they would die if too
 suddenly brought near the fire, or if their juices were too quickly
 li∣quefied.</P>
<P>Strictly speaking, says Mr. Buffon, these ani∣mals cannot be
 said to sleep during the winter; it may be called rather a torpor, a
 stagnation of all the faculties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
 xvi. Loir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</BIBL></NOTE>. This
 torpor is produced by the congelation of their blood, which is na∣turally much
 colder than that of all other qua∣drupedes. The usual heat of man and other
 animals is about thirty degrees above congela∣tion; the heat of these is not
 above ten de∣grees. Their internal heat is seldom greater than that of the
 temperature of the air. This has been often tried by plunging the ball of the
 thermometer into the body of a living dormouse, and it never rose beyond
 its usual pitch in air, and sometimes it sunk above a degree. It is not
 surprizing, therefore, that these animals, whose blood is so cold
 naturally, should become torpid, when the external cold is too powerful for
 the small quantity of heat in their bodies, yet remaining; and this always
 happens when the thermometer is not more than ten degrees <PB N="46" REF="65"/>
 above congelation. This coldness Mr. Buffon has experienced in the blood of
 the bat, the dormouse, and the hedge-hog, and with great justice he extends
 the analogy to the marmout, which like the rest is seen to sleep all the
 winter. This torpid state continues as long as the cause which produces it
 continues; and it is very pro∣bable that it might be lengthened out beyond its
 usual term, by artificially prolonging the cold; if, for instance, the
 animal were rolled up in wool, and placed in a cold cellar, nearly ap∣proaching
 to, but not quite so cold as an ice-house, for that would kill them
 outright, it would remain perhaps a whole year in its state of
 insensibility. However this be, if the heat of the air be above ten
 degrees, these animals are seen to revive; and, if it be continued in that
 degree of temperature, they do not become torpid, but eat and sleep at proper
 intervals like all other quadrupedes whatever.</P>
<P>From the above account we may form some conception of the
 state in which these animals continue during the winter. As in some
 dis∣orders where the circulation is extremely lan∣guid, the appetite is
 diminished in proportion, so in these the blood scarcely moving, or
 only moving in the greater vessels, they want no <PB N="47" REF="66"/>
 nourishment to repair what is worn away by its motions. They are seen,
 indeed, by slow de∣grees to become leaner in proportion to the slow
 attrition of their fluids; but this is not perceptible except at the end of
 some months. Man is often known to gather nourishment from the ambient air;
 and these also may in some measure be supplied in the same manner;
 and, having sufficient motion in their fluids to keep them from putrefaction,
 and just sufficient nourishment to supply the waste of their lan∣guid
 circulation, they continue rather feebly alive than sleeping.</P>
<P>These animals produce but once a year, and usually bring forth
 but three or four at a time. They grow very fast, and the extent of their
 lives is not above nine or ten years; so that the species is neither
 numerous nor very much dif∣fused. They are chiefly found in the Alps, where
 they seem to prefer the brow of the highest mountains to the lowest
 ranges, and the sunny side to that in the shade. The inhabi∣tants of the
 country where they chiefly reside, when they observe the hole, generally
 stay till winter before they think proper to open it; for if they begin too
 soon, the animal wakes, and, as it has a surprizing faculty of digging, 
 <PB N="48" REF="67"/> makes its hole deeper in proportion as they fol∣low. Such
 as kill it for food, use every art to improve the flesh, which is said to
 have a wild taste and to cause vomitings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dictionnaire Raisonnée, vol. iii. p.
 29.</BIBL></NOTE>. They, there∣fore, take away the fat, which is in great
 abundance, and salt the remainder, drying it somewhat in the manner of
 bacon. Still, how∣ever, it is said to be very indifferent eating. This animal
 is found in Poland under the de∣nomination of the Bobak, entirely resembling
 that of the Alps, except that the latter has a toe more upon its fore-feet than
 the former. It is found also in Siberia under the name of the Jevraska,
 being rather smaller than either of the other two. Lastly, it is found in
 Canada by the appellation of the Monax, differing only from the rest in
 having a blueish snout and a longer tail.</P>

<HEAD>THE AGOUTI.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the marmout, which differs from the hare so much in the
 length of its fur, we go to the Agouti, another species equally differing in
 the shortness of its hair. These bear some rude re∣semblance to the
 hare and the rabbit in their form and manner of living, but sufficiently
 differing to <PB REF="68"/>

 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="49" REF="71"/> require a
 particular description. The first of these, and that the largest, as
 was hinted above, is called the Agouti. This animal is found in great abundance
 in the southern parts of Ame∣rica, and has by some been called the rabbit
 of that continent. But, tho' in many respects it re∣sembles the rabbit, yet
 still in many more it dif∣fers, and is, without all doubt, an animal
 pecu∣liar to the new world only. The agouti is about the size of a rabbit,
 and has a head very much re∣sembling it, except that the ears are very
 short in comparison. It resembles the rabbit also in the arched form of
 its back, in the hind legs being longer than the fore, and in having four great
 cutting teeth, two above and two below; but then it differs in the nature of
 its hair, which is not soft and downy as in the rabbit, but hard and
 bristly like that of a sucking pig, and of a reddish brown colour. It
 differs also in the tail, which is even shorter than in the rabbit, and
 entirely destitute of hair. Lastly, it differs in the number of its toes,
 having but three on the hinder feet, whereas the rabbit has five. All these
 distinctions, however, do not countervail against its general form, which
 resembles that of a rabbit, and most travellers have called it by that
 name.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="72"/>As this animal differs in form, it differs
 still more in habitudes and disposition. As it has the hair of an hog,
 so also it has its voracious∣ness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. It eats indiscriminately of all
 things; and, when satiated, hides the remainder, like the dog or the fox, for
 a future occasion. It takes a pleasure in gnawing and spoiling every
 thing it comes near. When irritated, its hair stands erect along the back,
 and, like the rabbit, it strikes the ground violently with its hind feet. It
 does not dig an hole in the ground, but bur∣rows in the hollows of trees. Its
 ordinary food consists of the roots of the country, potatoes and yams, and
 such fruits as fall from the trees in autumn. It uses its fore-paws like
 the squirrel, to carry its food to its mouth; and as its hind feet are longer
 than the fore, it runs very swiftly upon plain ground or up a hill, but upon
 a descent it is in danger of falling. Its sight is excellent, and its
 hearing equals that of any other animal; whenever it is whistled to it
 stops to hearken. The flesh of such as are fat and well fed is tolerable
 food, although it has a peculiar taste and is a little tough. The French
 dress it like a sucking pig, as we learn from Mr. Buffon's account; but the
 English dress it with a pudding in its belly, like an <PB N="51" REF="73"/>
 hare. It is hunted by dogs; and whenever it is got into a sugar ground, where
 the canes cover the place, it is easily overtaken, for it is embarrassed
 every step it takes, so that a man may easily come up with it without any
 other assistance. When in the open country, it usually runs with great
 swiftness before the dogs until it gains its retreat, within which it
 con∣tinues to hide, and nothing but filling the hole with smoke can force it
 out. For this purpose the hunter burns faggots or straw at the en∣trance,
 and conducts the smoke in such a man∣ner that it fills the whole cavity.
 While this is doing, the poor little animal seems sensible of its danger,
 and begs for quarter with a most plaintive cry, seldom quitting its hole
 till the ut∣most extremity. At last, when half suffocated, it issues
 out, and trusts once more to its speed for protection. When still forced
 by the dogs, and incapable of making good a retreat, it turns upon the hunters,
 and with its hair bristling like an hog, and standing upon its hind feet,
 it defends itself very obstinately. Sometimes it bites the legs of those
 that attempt to take it, and will take out the piece wherever it fixes its
 teeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ray's Synop.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Its cry when disturbed or provoked resembles 
 <PB N="52" REF="74"/> that of a sucking pig. If taken young, it is easily
 tamed, continues to play harmlessly about the house, and goes out and
 returns of its own accord. In a savage state it usually continues in the
 woods, and the female generally chuses the most obscure parts to bring
 forth her young. She there prepares a bed of leaves and dry grass, and
 generally brings forth two at a time. She breeds twice or thrice a year, and
 carries her young from one place to another, as convenience requires, in the
 man∣ner of a cat. She generally lodges them when three days old in the hollow
 of a tree, suckling them but for a very short time, for they soon come to
 perfection, and it should consequently follow that they soon grow
 old.</P>

<HEAD>THE PACA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Paca is an animal also of South America, very much
 resembling the former, and like it has received the name of the Ame∣rican
 rabbit, but with as little propriety. It is about the size of an hare, or
 rather larger, and in figure somewhat like a sucking pig, which it also
 resembles in its grunting and its manner of eating. It is, however, most
 like the agouti, although it differs in several particulars. <PB REF="75"/>

<BYLINE>Is<SUP>c</SUP>. Taylor sculp</BYLINE>
</FIGURE> <PB N="53" REF="76"/> Like the agouti, it is covered
 rather with coarse hair than a downy fur. But then it is beautifully marked
 along the sides with small ash coloured spots, upon an amber coloured
 ground; whereas the agouti is pretty much of one reddish colour. The paca is
 rather more thick and corpulent than the agouti; its nose is shorter, and
 its hind feet have five toes; whereas the agouti has but three. As to the
 rest, this animal bears some distant resemblance to a rabbit, the ears
 are naked of hair and somewhat sharp, the lower jaw is somewhat longer
 than the upper, the teeth, the shape of the head and the size of it, are
 like to those of a rabbit. It has a short tail likewise, though not
 tufted, and its hinder legs are longer than the fore. It also burrows in the
 ground like that animal, and from this simili∣tude alone travellers might
 have given it the name.</P>
<P>The paca does not make use of its fore-paws, like the squirrel
 or the agouti, to carry its food to the mouth, but hunts for it on the ground,
 and roots like an hog. It is generally seen along the banks of rivers, and is
 only to be found in the moist and warm countries of South America. It is a
 very fat animal, and in this respect much preferable to the agouti, that is
 most commonly <PB REF="77"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>

 <PB N="54" REF="79"/> found lean. It is eaten, skin and all, like a young pig,
 and is considered as a great delicacy. Like the former little animal, it
 defends itself to the last extremity, and is very seldom taken alive. It
 is persecuted not only by man, but by every beast and bird of prey, who all
 watch its motions, and, if it ventures at any distance from its hole, are
 sure to seize it. But although the race of these little animals is thus
 con∣tinually destroyed, it finds some refuge in its hole, from the general
 combination; and breeds in such numbers, that the diminution is not
 perceptible.</P>
<P>To these animals may be added others, very similar both in
 form and disposition; each known by its particular name in its native
 country, but which travellers have been contented to call rabbits or hares; of
 which we have but indi∣stinct notice. The Tapeti, or the Brasilian rabbit,
 is in shape like our English ones, but is much less, being said to be
 not above twice the size of a dormouse. It is reddish on the forehead,
 and a little whitish under the throat. It is remarkable for having no tail;
 but it has long ears and whiskers, like our rabbits, and black eyes. It does
 not burrow, like ours; but lives at large, like the hare.</P>
<P>The Aperea is also called by some the Brasi∣lian 
 <PB N="55" REF="80"/> rabbit, being an animal that seems to par∣take of the
 nature of a rabbit and a rat. The ears are like those of a rat, being short
 and round; but the other parts are like those of a rabbit, except that it has
 but three toes on the hinder legs, like the Agouti.</P>
<P>To these imperfect sketches of animals little known, others
 less known might be added; for as Nature becomes more diminutive, her
 operations are less attentively regarded. I shall only, therefore, add one
 animal more to this class, and that very well known; I mean the Guinea pig;
 which Brisson places among those of the rabbit kind; and as I do not know
 any other set of animals with which it can be so well compared, I will take
 leave to follow his example.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE GUINEA-PIG.</HEAD>
<P>THE Guinea-Pig is a native of the warmer climates; but has been
 so long rendered do∣mestic, and so widely diffused, that it is now
 become common in every part of the world. There are few unacquainted with the
 figure of this little animal; in some places it is considered as the
 principal favourite; and is often found <PB N="56" REF="81"/> even to displace
 the lap-dog. It is less than a rabbit, and its legs are shorter; they are
 scarce seen, except when it moves; and the neck, also, is so short,
 that the head seems stuck upon the shoulders. The ears are short, thin
 and transparent; the hair is like that of a suck∣ing pig, from whence it
 has taken the name; and it wants even the vestiges of a tail. In other
 respects, it has some similitude to the rabbit. When it moves, its body
 lengthens like that animal; and when it is at rest, it ga∣thers up in the
 same manner. Its nose is form∣ed with the rabbit lip, except that its
 nostrils are much farther asunder. Like all other ani∣mals in a domestic
 state, its colours are different; some are white, some are red, and
 others both red and white. It differs from the rabbit in the number of its
 toes, having four toes on the feet before, and but three on those behind. It
 strokes its head with the fore feet like the rab∣bit; and, like it, sits
 upon the hind feet; for which purpose there is a naked callous skin on the
 back part of the legs and feet.</P>
<P>These animals are of all others the most helpless and
 inoffensive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This history is partly taken from the 
 <BIBL>Amaenitates Ac∣cademicae, vol. iv. p. 202.</BIBL></NOTE>.
 They are scarce pos∣sessed of courage sufficient to defend
 themselves <PB N="57" REF="82"/> against the meanest of all quadrupedes, a
 mouse. Their only animosity is exerted against each other; for they will
 often fight very obstinately; and the stronger is often known to destroy
 the weaker. But against all other aggressors, their only remedy is
 patience and non-resistance. How, therefore, these animals, in a savage
 state, could contrive to protect themselves, I have not been able to learn;
 as they want strength, swiftness, and even the natural instinct so
 common to almost every other creature.</P>
<P>As to their manner of living among us, they owe their lives
 entirely to our unceasing pro∣tection. They must be constantly attended,
 shielded from the excessive colds of the winter, and secured against
 all other domestic animals, which are apt to attack them, from every mo∣tive,
 either of appetite, jealousy, or experience of their pusillanimous nature.
 Such indeed is their stupidity, that they suffer themselves to be
 devoured by the cats, without resistance; and, different from all other
 creatures, the fe∣male sees her young destroyed without once attempting to
 protect them. Their usual food is bran, parsley, or cabbage leaves; but
 there is scarce a vegetable cultivated in our gardens that they will not
 gladly devour. The carrot∣top is a peculiar dainty; as also sallad; and 
 <PB N="58" REF="83"/> those who would preserve their healths, would do right
 to vary their food; for if they be con∣tinued on a kind too succulent or too
 dry, the effects are quickly perceived upon their consti∣tutions. When fed
 upon recent vegetables, they seldom drink. But it often happens that,
 conducted by nature, they seek dryer food, when the former disagrees with
 them. They then gnaw cloaths, paper, or whatever of this kind they meet with;
 and, on these occasions, they are seen to drink like most other
 animals, which they do by lapping. They are chiefly fond of new milk; but, in
 case of necessity, are contented with water.</P>
<P>They move pretty much in the manner of rabbits, though not near
 so swiftly; and when confined in a room, seldom cross the floor, but
 generally keep along the wall. The male usu∣ally drives the female on before
 him, for they never move a-breast together; but constantly the one seems
 to tread in the footsteps of the preceding. They chiefly seek for the
 darkest recesses, and the most intricate retreats; where, if hay be
 spread as a bed for them, they con∣tinue to sleep together, and seldom
 venture out but when they suppose all interruption removed. On those
 occasions they act as rabbits; they swiftly move forward from their bed,
 stop at <PB N="59" REF="84"/> the entrance, listen, look round, and, if they
 perceive the slightest approach of danger, they run back with
 precipitation. In very cold weather, however, they are more active, and run
 about in order to keep themselves warm.</P>
<P>They are a very cleanly animal, and very different from that
 whose name they go by. If the young ones happen to fall into the dirt, or be
 any other way discomposed, the female takes such an aversion to them
 that she never permits them to visit her more. Indeed, her whole
 employment, as well as that of the male, seems to consist in smoothing
 their skins, in disposing their hair, and improving its gloss. The male
 and female take this office by turns; and when they have thus brushed up each
 other, they then bestow all their concern upon their young, taking particular
 care to make their hair lie smooth, and biting them if they appear
 refrac∣tory. As they are so solicitous for elegance themselves, the place
 where they are kept, must be regularly cleaned, and a new bed of hay provided
 for them at least every week. Being natives of a warm climate, they are
 naturally chilly in ours: cleanliness, therefore, assists warmth, and
 expels moisture. They may be thus reared, without the aid of any ar∣tificial
 heat; but, in general, there is no keep∣ing <PB N="60" REF="85"/> them from the
 fire in winter, if they be once permitted to approach it.</P>
<P>When they go to sleep, they lie flat on their bellies, pretty
 much in their usual posture; ex∣cept that they love to have their fore feet
 higher than their hinder. For this purpose, they turn themselves several
 times round before they lie down, to find the most convenient situation.
 They sleep, like the hare, with their eyes half open; and continue extremely
 watchful, if they suspect danger. The male and female are never seen both
 asleep at the same time; but while he enjoys his repose, she remains
 upon the watch, silently continuing to guard him, and her head turned towards
 the place where he lies. When she supposes that he has had his turn,
 she then awakes him with a kind of murmuring noise, goes to him, forces him
 from his bed, and lies down in his place. He then performs the same good turn
 for her; and continues watchful till she also has done sleeping.</P>
<P>These animals are exceedingly salacious, and generally are
 capable of coupling at six weeks old. The female never goes with young above
 five weeks; and usually brings forth from three to five at a time; and this
 not without pain. But what is very extraordinary, the fe∣male 
 <PB N="61" REF="86"/> admits the male the very day she has brought forth, and
 becomes again pregnant; so that their multiplication is astonishing. She
 suckles her young but about twelve or fifteen days; and during that time does
 not seem to know her own; for if the young of any other be brought, though
 much older, she never drives them away, but suffers them even to drain her,
 to the disadvantage of her own im∣mediate offspring. They are produced with
 the eyes open, like all others of the hare kind; and in about twelve hours,
 equal even to the dam in agility. Although the dam has but two teats, yet she
 abundantly supplies them with milk: and they are also capable of feeding
 upon vegetables, almost from the very begin∣ning. If the young ones are
 permitted to con∣tinue together, the stronger, as in all other societies,
 soon begins to govern the weak. Their contentions are often long and
 obstinate; and their jealousies very apparent. Their dis∣putes are
 usually for the warmest place, or the most agreeable food. If one of them
 happens to be more fortunate in this respect than the rest, the
 strongest generally comes to dispossess it of its advantageous
 situation. Their manner of fighting, though terrible to them, is ridiculous
 enough to a spectator. One of them seizes the <PB N="62" REF="87"/> hair on
 the nape of the other's neck with its fore teeth, and attempts to tear it away;
 the other, to retaliate, turns its hinder parts to the enemy, and kicks up
 behind like an horse, and with its hinder claws scratches the sides of
 its adversary; so that sometimes they cover each other with blood. When
 they contend in this manner, they gnash their teeth pretty loudly; and this
 is often a denunciation of mu∣tual resentment.</P>
<P>These, though so formidable to each other, yet are the most
 timorous creatures upon earth, with respect to the rest of animated nature:
 a falling leaf disturbs them, and every animal over∣comes them. From hence
 they are difficultly tamed; and will suffer none to approach them, except the
 person by whom they are fed. Their manner of eating is something like that
 of the rabbit; and, like it, they appear also to chew the cud. Although they
 seldom drink, they make water every minute. They grunt some∣what like a
 young pig; and have a more pierc∣ing note to express pain. In a word, they do
 no injury; but then, except the pleasure they afford the spectator, they
 are of very little be∣nefit to mankind. Some, indeed, dress and eat them; but
 their flesh is indifferent food, and by no means a reward for the trouble of
 rear∣ing <PB REF="88"/>

 This, perhaps, might be improved, by keeping them in a proper warren, and not
 suffering them to become domestic: however, the advantages that would
 result from this, would be few, and the trouble great; so that it is likely
 they will continue an useless, inof∣fensive dependant, rather propagated
 to satisfy caprice than supply necessity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Animals of the Rat Kind.</HEAD>
<P>WERE it necessary to distinguish animals of the rat kind
 from all others, we might describe them as having two large cutting teeth,
 like the hare kind, in each jaw; as co∣vered with hair; and as not ruminating.
 These distinctions might serve to guide us, had we not too near an
 acquaintance with this noxious race to be mistaken in their kind. Their
 numbers, their minuteness, their vicinity, their vast mul∣tiplication, all
 sufficiently contribute to press them upon our observation, and remind us
 of their existence. Indeed, if we look through the different ranks of
 animals, from the largest to the smallest, from the great elephant to the
 diminutive mouse, we shall find that we suffer greater injuries from the
 contemptible mean∣ness of the one, than the formidable invasions of the
 other. Against the elephant, the rhi∣noceros, or the lion, we can oppose
 united strength; and by art make up the deficiencies of natural power:
 these we have driven into their native solitudes, and obliged to continue
 at a distance, in the most inconvenient regions and unhealthful climates.
 But it is otherwise <PB N="65" REF="93"/> with the little teizing race I am
 now describing: no force can be exerted against their unresist∣ing
 timidity; no arts can diminish their amaz∣ing propagation: millions may be at
 once de∣stroyed, and yet the breach be repaired in the space of a very few
 weeks; and, in proportion as Nature has denied them force, it has sup∣plied
 the defect by their fecundity.</P>
<P>Of these, the animal best known at present, and in every
 respect the most mischievous, is the Great Rat; which, though but a new
 comer into this country, has taken too secure a possession to be ever
 removed. This hateful and rapacious creature, though sometimes called the Rat
 of Norway, is utterly unknown in all the northern countries, and, by the best
 accounts I can learn, comes originally from the Levant. Its first arrival, as
 I am assured, was upon the coasts of Ireland, in those ships that
 traded in provisions to Gibraltar; and perhaps we owe to a single pair of
 these animals, the numerous progeny that now infests the whole extent of
 the British Empire.</P>
<P>This animal, which is called by Mr. Buffon the Surmalot, is in
 length about nine inches; its eyes are large and black; the colour of the head,
 and the whole upper part of the body, is of a light brown, mixed with tawny and
 ash colour. The <PB N="66" REF="94"/> end of the nose, the throat and belly,
 are of a dirty white, inclining to a grey; the feet and legs are almost bare,
 and of a dirty pale flesh colour; the tail is as long as the body, covered
 with minute dusky scales, mixed with a few hairs, and adds to the general
 deformity of its detestable figure. It is chiefly in the colour that this
 animal differs from the Black Rat, or the Common Rat, as it was once called;
 but now common no longer. This new invader, in a very few years after its
 arrival, found means to destroy almost the whole species, and to
 possess itself of their retreats.</P>
<P>But it was not against the Black Rat alone that its rapacity was
 directed; all other animals of inferior strength shared the same
 misfortunes. The contest with the black rat was of short continuance. As it
 was unable to contend, and had no holes to fly to for retreat, but where its
 voracious enemy could pursue, the whole race was soon extinguished. The
 Frog also was an animal equally incapable of combat or defence. It had been
 designedly introduced into the kingdom of Ireland some years before the
 Norway rat; and it was seen to multiply amazingly. The inhabitants were
 pleased with the propagation of an harmless animal, that served to rid
 their fields of insects; and even <PB N="67" REF="95"/> the prejudices of the
 people were in its fa∣vour, as they supposed that the frog contributed to
 render their waters more wholesome. But the Norway rat soon put a stop to
 their encrease; as these animals were of an amphibious nature, they
 pursued the frog to its lakes and took it even in its own natural element. I
 am, there∣fore, assured, that the frog is once more almost extinct in
 that kingdom; and that the Norway rat, having no more enemies left there to
 destroy, is grown less numerous also.</P>
<P>We are not likely, therefore, to gain by the destruction of our
 old domestics, since they are replaced by such mischievous
 successors. The Norway rat has the same disposition to injure us,
 with much greater power of mischief. It burrows in the banks of rivers,
 ponds, and ditches; and is every year known to do incre∣dible damage to those
 mounds that are raised to conduct streams, or to prevent rivers from
 overflowing. In these holes, which it forms pretty near the edge of the
 water, it chiefly resides during the summer, where it lives upon small
 animals, fish, and corn. At the ap∣proach of winter, it comes nearer the farm
 houses; burrows in their corn, eats much, and damages still more than it
 consumes. But no∣thing that can be eaten, seems to escape its 
 <PB N="68" REF="96"/> voracity. It destroys rabbits, poultry, and all kinds of
 game; and, like the polecat, kills much more than it can carry away. It swims
 with great ease, dives with great celerity, and easily thins the fish
 pond. In short, scarce any of the feebler animals escape its rapacity,
 ex∣cept the mouse, which shelters itself in its little hole, where the
 Norway rat is too big to follow.</P>
<P>These animals frequently produce from fif∣teen to thirty at a
 time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xvii. p. 2.</BIBL></NOTE>; and
 usually bring forth three times a year. This great encrease would quickly
 be found to overrun the whole country, and render our assiduity to
 destroy them fruitless, were it not, happily for us, that they eat and
 destroy each other. The same insatiable appetite that impels them to
 indiscriminate carnage, also incites the strongest to devour the
 weakest, even of their own kind. The large male rat generally keeps in an
 hole by itself, and is as dreaded by its own species, as the most
 formidable enemies. In this man∣ner the number of these vermin is kept within
 due bounds; and when their encrease becomes injurious to us, it is
 repressed by their own ra∣pacity.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="97"/>But beside their own enmities among each
 other, all the stronger carnivorous quadrupedes have natural antipathies
 against them. The dog, though he detests their flesh, yet openly declares
 his alacrity to pursue them; and attacks them with great animosity. Such as
 are trained up to killing these vermin, dispatch them often with a single
 squeeze: but those dogs that shew any hesitation, are sure to come
 off but indif∣ferently; for the rat always takes the advantage of a moment's
 delay, and, instead of waiting for the attack, becomes the aggressor,
 seizing its pursuer by the lip, and inflicting a very painful and dangerous
 wound. From the in∣flammation, and other angry symptoms that attend this
 animal's bite, some have been led to think that it was in some measure
 venemous; but it is likely that the difficulty of the wound's healing, arises
 merely from its being deep and lacerated by the teeth, and is rather a
 con∣sequence of the figure of the instruments that inflict it, than any
 venom they may be sup∣posed to possess.</P>
<P>The cat is another formidable enemy of this kind; and yet the
 generality of our cats neither care to attack it, nor to feed upon it when
 killed. The cat is a more prudent hunter than the dog, and will not be at the
 pains to take <PB N="70" REF="98"/> or combat with an enemy that is not likely
 to repay her time and danger. Some cats, however, will pursue and take the
 rat; though often not without an obstinate resistance. If hungry also,
 the cat will sometimes eat the head; but, in general, she is merely content
 with her victory.</P>
<P>A foe much more dangerous to these vermin is the weasel. This
 animal pursues them with avidity; and being pretty nearly of their own
 size, follows them into their holes, where a desperate combat ensues. The
 strength of each is pretty near equal; but the arms are very different. The
 rat, furnished with four long tusks at the extremity of its jaw, rather
 snaps than bites; but the weasel, where it once fastens, holds, and
 continuing also to suck the blood at the same time, weakens its
 antagonist, and always obtains the victory. Mankind have contrived several
 other methods of destroying these noxious intruders; ferrets, traps, and
 par∣ticularly poison: but of all other poisons, I am told that the nux
 vomica, ground and mixed with meal, is the most certain, as it is the least
 dangerous.</P>
<P>To this species I will subjoin as a variety, the Black Rat,
 mentioned above, greatly resem∣bling the former in figure, but very
 distinct in <PB N="71" REF="99"/> nature, as appears from their mutual
 antipathy. This animal was formerly as mischievous as it was common; but at
 present it is almost ut∣terly extirpated by the great rat, one malady often
 expelling another. It is become so scarce, that I do not remember ever to
 have seen one. It is said to be possessed of all the voracious and
 unnatural appetites of the former; though, as it is less, they may probably
 be less noxious. Its length is about seven inches; and the tail is near
 eight inches long. The colour of the body is of a deep iron grey, bordering
 upon black, except the belly, which is of a dirty cinereous hue. They have
 propagated in America in great numbers, being originally introduced from
 Europe; and as they seem to keep their ground wherever they get footing, they
 are now become the most noxious animals in that part of the world.</P>
<P>To this also we may subjoin the Black Water Rat, about the
 same size with the latter, with a larger head, a blunter nose, less
 eyes, and shorter ears, and the tip of its tail a little white. It was
 supposed by Ray to be web footed; but this has been found to be a
 mistake, its toes pretty much resembling those of its kind. It never
 frequents houses; but is usually found on the banks of rivers, ditches and
 ponds, where <PB N="72" REF="100"/> it burrows and breeds. It feeds on fish,
 frogs, and insects; and in some countries it is eat on fasting days.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE MOUSE.</HEAD>
<P>AN animal equally mischievous, and equally well known with the
 former, is the mouse. Ti∣mid, cautious and active, all its dispositions
 are similar to those of the rat, except with fewer powers of doing
 mischief<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xv. p.
 145.</BIBL></NOTE>. Fearful by nature, but familiar from necessity, it
 attends upon mankind, and comes an unbidden guest to his most delicate
 entertainments. Fear and neces∣sity seem to regulate all its motions; it
 never leaves its hole but to seek provision, and seldom ventures above a
 few paces from home. Dif∣ferent from the rat, it does not go from one house
 to another, unless it be forced; and, as it is more easily satisfied, it
 does much less mis∣chief.</P>
<P>Almost all animals are tamed more difficultly in proportion to
 the cowardice of their natures. The truly bold and courageous easily become
 familiar, but those that are always fearful are ever suspicious. The
 mouse being the most feeble, and consequently the most timid of all
 quadrupedes, except the guinea-pig, is never <PB N="73" REF="101"/> rendered
 thoroughly familiar; and, even though fed in a cage, retains its natural
 apprehensions. In fact, it is to these alone that it owes its
 se∣curity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
 <Q> E volucribus hirundines sunt indociles, e terrestibus
 mures. 
 <BIBL>PLIN.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. No animal has more enemies, and
 few so incapable of resistance. The owl, the cat, the snake, the hawk,
 the weasel, and the rat itself, destroy this species by millions, and
 it only subsists by its amazing fecundity.</P>
<P>The mouse brings forth at all seasons, and several times
 in the year. Its usual number is from six to ten. These in less than a
 fortnight are strong enough to run about and shift for themselves. They
 are chiefly found in farmers yards and among their corn, but are seldom in
 those ricks that are much infested with rats. They generally chuse the
 south west side of the rick, from whence most rain is expected; and
 from thence they often, of an evening, venture sorth to drink the little
 drops either of rain or dew that hang at the extremities of the straw<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xv. p. 147.</BIBL></NOTE>.
 Aristotle gives us an idea of their prodigious fecundity, by assuring us
 that, having put a mouse with young into a vessel of corn, in some time
 after he found an hundred and twenty mice, all sprung from one original. The
 early growth of this animal implies also the short du∣ration 
 <PB N="74" REF="102"/> of its life, which seldom lasts above two or three
 years. This species is very much dif∣fused, being found in almost all
 parts of the ancient continent, and having been exported to the new<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lisle's Husbandry, vol. ii. p. 391.</BIBL></NOTE>. They
 are animals that, while they fear human society, closely attend it; and,
 al∣though enemies to man, are never found but near those places where he has
 fixed his habita∣tion. Numberless ways have been found for destroying them;
 and Gesner has minutely de∣scribed the variety of traps by which they are
 taken. Our Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures proposed a
 reward for the most ingenious contrivance for that pur∣pose; and I
 observed almost every candidate passing off descriptions as
 inventions of his own. I thought it was cruel to detect the pla∣giarism, or
 frustrate the humble ambition of those who would be thought the inventors
 of a mouse-trap.</P>
<P>To this species, merely to avoid teizing the reader with a
 minute description of animals very inconsiderable and very nearly alike, I
 will add that of the <HI>long tail'd field mouse,</HI> which is larger than
 the former, of a colour very nearly resembling the Norway rat, and chiefly
 found in fields and gardens. They are extremely vo∣racious, and hurtful in
 gardens and young nur∣series, <PB N="75" REF="103"/> where they are killed in
 great numbers. However, their fecundity quickly repairs the destruction.</P>
<P>Nearly resembling the former, but larger, (for it is six
 inches long) is the <HI>short tailed field mouse</HI>; which, as its name
 implies, has the tail much shorter than the former, it being not above an
 inch and an half long, and ending in a small tuft. Its colour is more
 inclining to that of the domestic mouse, the upper part being blackish
 and the under of an ash colour. This, as well as the former, are remarkable
 for laying up provision against winter; and Mr. Buffon assures us they
 sometimes have a store of above a bushel at a time.</P>
<P>We may add also the <HI>shrew mouse</HI> to this species
 of minute animals, being about the size of the domestic mouse, but
 differing greatly from it in the form of its nose, which is very long and
 slender. The teeth also are of a very singular form, and twenty-eight in
 number; whereas the common number in the rat kind is usually not above
 sixteen. The two upper fore teeth are very sharp, and on each side of
 them there is a kind of wing or beard, like that of an arrow, scarce
 visible but on a close in∣spection. The other teeth are placed close
 to∣gether, being very small, and seeming scarce <PB N="76" REF="104"/>
 separated; so that with respect to this part of its formation, the animal
 has some resemblance to the viper. However, it is a very harmless little
 creature, doing scarce any injury. On the contrary, as it lives chiefly in
 the fields, and feeds more upon insects than corn, it may be considered
 rather as a friend than an enemy. It has a strong disagreeable smell,
 so that the cat, when it is killed, will refuse to eat it. It is said to
 bring four or five young at a time.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE DORMOUSE.</HEAD>
<P>THESE animals may be distinguished into three kinds; the
 <HI>greater dormouse,</HI> which Mr. Buffon calls the Loir; the
 <HI>middle,</HI> which he calls the Lerot; the <HI>less,</HI> which he
 denomi∣nates the Muscardin. They differ from each other in size, the
 largest being equal to a rat, the least being no bigger than a mouse.
 They all differ from the rat in having the tail tufted with hair, in the manner
 of a squirrel, except that the squirrel's tail is flat, resembling a fan;
 and theirs round, resembling a brush. The lerot differs from the loir by
 having two black spots near the eyes; the muscardin differs from both in
 the whitish colour of its hair on <PB N="77" REF="105"/> the back. They all
 three agree in having black sparkling eyes, and the whiskers partly white
 and partly black. They agree in their being stupefied like the marmout during
 the winter, and in their hoarding up provisions to serve them in case of
 a temporary revival.</P>
<P>They inhabit woods or very thick hedges, forming their nests in
 the hollow of some tree, or near the bottom of a close shrub, humbly
 content with continuing at the bottom, and never aspiring to sport among
 the branches. Towards the approach of the cold season they form a little
 magazine of nuts, beans, or acorns; and, having laid in their hoard, shut
 themselves up with it for the winter. As soon as they feel the first
 advances of the cold they prepare to lessen its effect, by rolling
 themselves up in a ball, and thus exposing the smallest surface to
 the weather. But it often happens that the warmth of a sunny day, or an
 accidental change from cold to heat, thaws their nearly stagnant fluids, and
 they revive. On such occasions they have their provisions laid in, and
 they have not far to seek for their support. In this manner they continue
 usually asleep, but some∣times waking, for above five months in the year,
 seldom venturing from their retreats, and consequently but rarely seen.
 Their nests are <PB N="78" REF="106"/> lined with moss grass and dead
 leaves; they usually bring forth three or four young at a time, and that but
 once a year, in the spring.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE MUSK RAT.</HEAD>
<P>OF these animals of the rat kind, but with a musky smell,
 there are also three distinctions, as of the former; the Ondatra, the
 Desman, and the Pilori. The Ondatra is a native of Ca∣nada, the Desman of
 Lapland, and the Pilori of the West-India islands. The ondatra differs from
 all others of its kind, in having the tail flatted and carried edge-ways. The
 desman has a long extended snout like the shrew mouse; and the pilori a
 short tail, as thick at one end as the other. They all resemble each other
 in being fond of the water, but particularly in that musky odour from whence
 they have taken their name.</P>
<P>Of these, the Ondatra is the most remarkable, and has been the
 most minutely described<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xx. p.
 4.</BIBL></NOTE>. This animal is about the size of a small rabbit, but has
 the hair, the colour, and the tail of a rat, except that it is flatted on the
 sides, as mentioned above. But it is still more extraordi∣nary upon other
 accounts, and different from all other animals whatever. It is so formed that
 it can <PB N="79" REF="107"/> contract and enlarge its body at pleasure. It
 has a muscle like that of horses, by which they move, their hides lying
 immediately under the skin, and that furnished with such a power of
 con∣traction, together with such an elasticity in the false ribs, that
 this animal can creep into an hole where others, seemingly much less,
 cannot follow. The female is remarkable also for two distinct apertures,
 one for urine, the other for propagation. The male is equally observable for
 a peculiarity of conformation; the musky smell is much stronger at one
 particular season of the year than any other; and the marks of the sex
 seem to appear and disappear in the same manner.</P>
<P>The ondatra in some measure resembles the beaver in its
 nature and disposition. They both live in society during winter; they
 both form houses of two feet and an half wide, in which they reside
 several families together. In these they do not assemble to sleep as
 the marmout, but purely to shelter themselves from the rigour of the
 season. However, they do not lay up magazines of provision like the
 beaver; they only form a kind of covert way to and round their dwelling, from
 whence they issue to procure water and roots, upon which they
 subsist. During winter their houses are covered under a depth of eight 
 <PB N="80" REF="108"/> or ten feet of snow; so that they must lead but a
 cold, gloomy and a necessitous life, during its continuance. During
 summer they separate two by two, and feed upon the variety of roots and
 vegetables that the season offers. They then become extremely fat, and are
 much sought after, as well for their flesh as their skins, which are very
 valuable. They then also acquire a very strong scent of musk, so
 pleasing to an Eu∣ropean, but which the savages of Canada cannot abide.
 What we admire as a perfume they consider as a most abominable stench,
 and call one of their rivers, on the banks of which this animal is seen to
 burrow in numbers, by the name of the stinking river, as well as the rat
 itself, which is denominated by them the stinkard. This is a strange
 diversity among mankind; and, perhaps, may be ascribed to the different
 kinds of food among different nations. Such as chiefly feed upon rancid oils
 and putrid flesh will often mistake the nature of scents; and, having
 been long used to ill smells, will by habit consider them as perfumes. Be
 this as it will, although these nations of northern savages consider the
 musk rat as intolerably foetid, they nevertheless regard it as very good
 eating; and, indeed, in this they imitate the epicures of Europe very exactly,
 whose taste seldom relishes a dish till <PB N="81" REF="109"/> the
 nose gives the strongest marks of disappro∣bation. As to the rest,
 this animal a good deal resembles the beaver in its habits and
 dispo∣sition; but, as its instincts are less powerful, and its oeconomy
 less exact, I will reserve for the description of that animal a part of
 what may be applicable to this.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE CRICETUS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cricetus, or German Rat, which Mr. Buffon calls the Hamster,
 greatly resembles the water-rat in its size, small eyes, and the
 short∣ness of its tail. It differs in colour, being rather browner, like
 the Norway rat, with the belly and legs of a dirty yellow. But the marks by
 which it may be distinguished from all others are two pouches, like those
 of a baboon, on each side of its jaw, under the skin, into which it can
 cram a large quantity of provision. These bags are oblong, and of the
 size, when filled, of a large walnut. They open into the mouth, and fall back
 along the neck to the shoulder. Into these the animal can thrust the
 surplus of those fruits or grains it gathers in the fields, such as
 wheat, peas, or acorns. When the immediate calls of hunger are satisfied, it
 then falls to filling these; and thus, loaded with two great bunches on each
 side of the jaw, it <PB N="82" REF="110"/> returns home to its hole to
 deposit the spoil as a store for the winter. The size, the fecundity,
 and the voraciousness of this animal render it one of the greatest
 pests in the countries where it is found, and every method is made use of
 to destroy it.</P>
<P>But, although this animal is very noxious with respect to man,
 yet, considered with re∣gard to those instincts which conduce to its own
 support and convenience, it deserves our ad∣miration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxvi. p. 159.</BIBL></NOTE>. Its hole offers a
 very curious object for contemplation, and shews a degree of skill
 superior to the rest of the rat kind. It consists of a variety of
 apartments, fitted up for the different occasions of the little inhabitant.
 It is generally made on an inclining ground, and always has two entrances, one
 perpendicular and the other oblique; though, if there be more than one in a
 family, there are as many perpen∣dicular holes as there are individuals below.
 The perpendicular hole is usually that through which they go in and out; the
 oblique serves to give a thorough air to keep the retreat clean, and, in
 case one hole is stopped, to give an exit at this. Within about a foot of
 the perpendicular hole the animal makes two more, where are deposited the
 family's provisions. These are <PB N="83" REF="111"/> These are much more
 spacious than the former, and are large in proportion to the quantity of the
 store. Beside these, there is still another apartment warmly lined with
 grass and straw, where the female brings forth her young; all these
 communicate with each other, and all to∣gether take up a space of ten or
 twelve feet in diameter. These animals furnish their store-houses with
 dry corn well cleaned; they also lay in corn in the ear, and beans and peas
 in the pod. These, when occasion requires, they afterwards separate,
 carrying out the pods and empty ears by their oblique passage. They
 usually begin to lay in at the latter end of Au∣gust; and, as each magazine
 is filled, they carefully cover up the mouth with earth, and that so neatly
 that it is no easy matter to discover where the earth has been removed. The
 only means of finding out their retreats are, there∣fore, to observe the
 oblique entrance, which generally has a small quantity of earth before it;
 and this, though often several yards from their perpendicular retreat, leads
 those who are skilled in the search to make the discovery. Many German
 peasants are known to make a livelihood by finding out and bringing off their
 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oards, which, in a fruitful
 season, often furnish two bushels of good grain in each apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="112"/>Like most others of the rat kind, they
 pro∣duce twice or thrice a year, and bring five or six at a time. Some years
 they appear in alarm∣ing numbers, at other times they are not so plenty. The
 moist seasons assist their propa∣gation; and it often happens on
 such years that their devastations produce a famine all over the country.
 Happily, however, for mankind, these, like the rest of their kind,
 destroy each other; and of two that Mr. Buffon kept in a cage, male and
 female, the latter killed and devoured the former. As to the rest, their fur
 is considered as very valuable; the natives are invited by rewards to
 destroy them; and the weasel kind seconds the wishes of government with
 great success. Although they are usually found brown on the back and
 white on the belly, yet many of them are observed to be grey, which may
 probably arise from the difference of age.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE LEMING.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING considered various kinds of these noxious little
 animals that elude the indignation of mankind, and subsist by their
 number, not their strength, we come to a species more bold, more dangerous,
 and more numerous than any of the former. The Leming, which is a native 
 <PB N="85" REF="113"/> of Scandinavia, is often seen to pour down in myriads
 from the northern mountains, and, like a pestilence, destroy all the
 productions of the earth. It is described as being larger than a dormouse,
 with a bushy tail, though shorter. It is covered with thin hair of various
 colours. The extremity of the upper part of the head is black, as are
 likewise the neck and shoulders, but the rest of the body is reddish,
 intermixed with small black spots of various figures, as far as the tail,
 which is not above half an inch long. The eyes are little and black, the ears
 round and inclining towards the back, the legs before are short, and those
 behind longer, which gives it a great degree of swiftness. But what it is
 much more remarkable for than its figure are, its amazing fecundity and
 extraordinary mi∣grations.</P>
<P>In wet seasons, all of the rat kind are known to propagate
 more than in the dry; but this species in particular is so assisted
 in multiplying by the moisture of the weather, that the inhabitants of
 Lapland sincerely believe that they drop from the clouds, and that the same
 magazines that furnish hail and snow pour the leming also upon them. In
 fact, after long rain, these animals set forward from their native
 mountains, and several millions in a troop deluge the whole 
 <PB N="86" REF="114"/> plain with their numbers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p. 872.</BIBL></NOTE>. They move,
 for the most part, in a square, marching forward by night and lying still
 by day. Thus, like an animated torrent, they are often seen more than a mile
 broad covering the ground, and that so thick that the hindmost touches its
 leader. It is in vain that the poor inhabitant resists or at∣tempts to
 stop their progress, they still keep moving forward; and, though
 thousands are destroyed, myriads are seen to succeed and make their
 destruction impracticable. They generally move in lines, which are about
 three feet from each other and exactly parallel. Their march is always directed
 from the north-west to the south-west, and regularly conducted from the
 beginning. Wherever their motions are turned nothing can stop them; they go
 directly forward, impelled by some strange power; and, from the time they
 first set out, they never once think of retreating. If a lake or a river
 happens to interrupt their progress, they all together take the water and
 swim over it; a fire, a deep well, or a torrent, does not turn them out of
 their straight lined direction; they boldly plunge into the flames, or leap
 down the well, and are some∣times seen climbing up on the other side. If
 they are interrupted by a boat across a river <PB N="87" REF="115"/> while
 they are swimming, they never attempt to swim round it, but mount directly
 up its sides; and the boat-men, who know how vain resistance in such a
 case would be, calmly suffer the living torrent to pass over, which it
 does without further damage. If they meet with a stack of hay or corn that
 interrupts their passage, instead of going over it they gnaw their way
 through; if they are stopped by a house in their course, if they cannot
 get through it, they con∣tinue there till they die. It is happy, however, for
 mankind that they eat nothing that is pre∣pared for human subsistence;
 they never enter an house to destroy the provisions, but are con∣tented
 with eating every root and vegetable that they meet. If they happen to pass
 through a meadow, they destroy it in a very short time, and give it an
 appearance of being burnt up and strewed with ashes. If they are
 interrupted in their course, and a man should imprudently venture to attack
 one of them, the little animal is no way intimidated by the disparity of
 strength, but furiously flies up at its opponent, and, barking somewhat
 like a puppy, wherever it fastens does not easily quit the hold. If at
 last the leader be forced out of its line, which it defends as long as it
 can, and be separated from the rest of its kind, it sets up a plaintive 
 <PB N="88" REF="116"/> cry different from that of anger, and, as some pretend
 to say, gives itself a voluntary death, by hanging itself on the fork of
 a tree.</P>
<P>An enemy so numerous and destructive would quickly render the
 countries where they appear utterly uninhabitable, did it not fortunately
 happen that the same rapacity that animates them to destroy the labours of
 mankind, at last impels them to destroy and devour each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dictonnaire Raisonnée, vol. ii. p.
 610.</BIBL></NOTE>. After committing incredible devastations, they are at
 last seen to separate into two armies, op∣posed with deadly hatred,
 along the coasts of the larger lakes and rivers. The Laplanders, who
 observe them thus drawn up to fight, instead of considering their mutual
 animosities as an happy riddance of the most dreadful pest, form omi∣nous
 prognostics from the manner of their ar∣rangement. They consider their
 combats as a presage of war, and expect an invasion from the Russians
 or the Swedes, as the sides next those kingdoms happen to conquer. The two
 divisions, however, continue their engagements and animosity until one
 party overcomes the other. From that time they utterly disappear, nor is it
 well known what becomes of either the conquerors or the conquered. Some
 suppose that they rush headlong into the sea, others that 
 <PB N="89" REF="117"/> they kill themselvs, as some are found hanging on the
 forked branches of a tree, and others still that they are destroyed by the
 young spring herbage. But the most probable opinion is, that, having
 devoured the vegetable produc∣tions of the country, and having nothing more to
 subsist on, they then fall to devouring each other; and, having
 habituated themselves to that kind of food, continue it. However this be,
 they are often found dead by thousands, and their carcases have been known
 to infect the air for several miles round, so as to produce very malignant
 disorders. They seem also to infect the plants they have gnawed, for the
 cattle often die that afterwards feed in the places where they passed.</P>
<P>As to the rest, the male is larger and more beautifully
 spotted than the female. They are extremely prolific; and what is
 extraordinary, their breeding does not hinder their march; for some of them
 have been observed to carry one young one in their mouth and another on their
 back. They are greatly preyed upon by the ermine, and, as we are told, even by
 the rein∣deer. The Swedes and Norwegians, who live by husbandry, consider
 an invasion from these vermin as a terrible visitation; but it is very
 different with respect to the Laplanders, who <PB N="90" REF="118"/> lead a
 vagrant life, and who, like the lemings themselves, if their provisions be
 destroyed in one part of the country, can easily retire to another. These
 are never so happy as when an army of lemings come down amongst them; for
 then they feast upon their flesh; which though horrid food, and which,
 though even dogs and cats are known to detest, these little savages
 esteem very good eating and devour greedily. They are glad of their arrival
 also upon another account, for they always expect a great plenty of game the
 year following, among those fields which the lemings have destroyed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE MOLE.</HEAD>
<P>TO these minute animals of the rat kind, a great part of whose
 lives is past in holes under ground, I will subjoin one little animal more,
 no way resembling the rat, except that its whole life is spent there. As we
 have seen some quadrupedes formed to crop the surface of the fields, and
 others to live upon the tops of trees, so the Mole is formed to live wholly
 under the earth, as if Nature meant that no place should be left wholly
 untenanted. Were we from our own sensations to pronounce upon the life of a
 quadrupede that was never to ap∣pear above ground, but always condemned to 
 <PB N="91" REF="119"/> hunt for its prey underneath, obliged, whenever It
 removed from one place to another, to bore its way through a resisting
 body, we should be apt to assert that such an existence must be the
 most frightful and solitary in nature. However, in the present animal,
 though we find it con∣demned to all those seeming inconveniencies, we
 shall discover no signs of wretchedness or distress. No quadrupede
 is fatter, none has a more sleek or glossy skin; and, though denied
 many advantages that most animals enjoy, it is more liberally
 possessed of others, which they have in a more scanty proportion.</P>
<P>This animal, so well known in England, is, however, utterly a
 stranger in other places, and particularly in Ireland. For such,
 there∣fore, as have never seen it, a short description will be
 necessary. And, in the first place, though somewhat of a size between
 the rat and the mouse, it no way resembles either, being an animal entirely
 of a singular kind, and perfectly unlike any other quadrupede whatever. It is
 bigger than a mouse, with a coat of fine, short, glossy, black hair.
 Its nose is long and pointed, resembling that of an hog, but much longer.
 Its eyes are so small that it is scarce possible to discern them.
 Instead of ears it has only holes in the place. Its neck is so short that
 the head <PB N="92" REF="120"/> seems stuck upon the shoulders. The body
 is thick and round, terminating by a very small short tail, and its legs
 also are so very short that the animal seems to lie flat on its belly.
 From under its belly, as it rests in this position, the four feet appear
 just as if they immediately grew out of the body. Thus the animal appears to
 us at first view as a mass of flesh covered with a fine shining black
 skin, with a little head, and scarce any legs, eyes, or tail. On a closer
 in∣spection, however, two little black points may be discerned, that are
 its eyes. The ancients, and some of the moderns, were of opinion that the
 animal was utterly blind; but Derham, by the help of a microscope, plainly
 discovered all the parts of the eye that are known in other animals, such
 as the pupil, the vitreous and the chrystaline humours. The fore-legs appear
 very short and strong, and furnished with five claws to each. These are
 turned outwards and backwards, as the hands of a man when swim∣ming. The hind
 legs are longer and weaker than the fore, being only used to assist its
 mo∣tions; whereas the others are continually em∣ployed in digging. The teeth
 are like those of a shrew-mouse, and there are five on both sides of
 the upper jaw, which stand out; but those behind are divided into points.
 The tongue is as large as the mouth will hold.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="121"/>Such is the extraordinary figure and
 for∣mation of this animal; which, if we compare with its manner of living, we
 shall find a ma∣nifest attention in Nature to adapt the one to the
 other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. As it is
 allotted a subterraneous abode, the seeming defects of its formation
 va∣nish, or rather are turned to its advantage. The breadth, strength, and
 shortness of the fore feet, which are inclined outwards, answer the
 pur∣poses of digging, serving to throw back the earth with greater ease,
 and to pursue the worms and insects which are its prey: had they been
 longer, the falling in of the earth would have prevented the quick repetition
 of its strokes in working; or have obliged it to make a larger hole, in order
 to give room for their exertion. The form of the body is not less admirably
 contrived for its way of life. The fore part is thick and very muscular,
 giving great strength to the action of the fore feet, enabling it to dig its
 way with amazing force and rapidity, either to pursue its prey, or elude the
 search of the most active enemy. By its power of boring the earth, it
 quickly gets be∣low the surface; and I have seen it, when let loose in
 the midst of a field, like the ghost on a theatre, instantly sink into
 the earth; and the <PB N="94" REF="122"/> most active labourer, with a
 spade, in vain at∣tempted to pursue.</P>
<P>The smallness of its eyes, which induced the ancients to think
 it was blind, is, to this ani∣nimal, a peculiar advantage. A small degree of
 vision is sufficient for a creature that is ever destined to live in
 darkness. A more extensive sight would only have served to shew the
 hor∣rors of its prison, while Nature had denied it the means of an escape.
 Had this organ been larger, it would have been perpetually liable to injuries,
 by the falling of the earth into it; but Nature, to prevent that inconvenience,
 has not only made them very small, but very closely covered them with hair.
 Anatomists mention, beside these advantages, another, that con∣tributes
 to their security; namely, a certain muscle, by which the animal can draw
 back the eye whenever it is necessary or in danger.</P>
<P>As the eye is thus perfectly fitted to the animal's situation,
 so also are the senses of hear∣ing and smelling. The first gives it
 notice of the most distant appearance of danger; the other directs it, in
 the midst of darkness, to its food. The wants of a subterraneous animal
 can be but few; and these are sufficient to sup∣ply them: to eat, and to
 produce its kind, are the whole employments of such a life; and for 
 <PB N="95" REF="123"/> both these purposes it is wonderfully adapted by
 Nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">

<P>Thus admirably is this animal fitted for a life of darkness and
 solitude; with no appetites but what it can easily indulge, with no enemies
 but what it can easily evade or conquer. As soon as it has once buried
 itself in the earth, it seldom stirs out, unless forced by violent
 rains in summer, or when in pursuit of its prey, it happens to come too
 near the surface, and thus gets into the open air, which may be considered
 as its unnatural element. In general, it chuses the looser softer
 grounds, beneath which it can travel with greater ease; in such also it
 generally finds the greatest number of worms and insects, upon which it
 chiefly preys. It is observed to be most active, and to cast up most
 earth, im∣mediately before rain; and, in winter, before <PB N="96" REF="124"/> a
 thaw: at those times the worms and insects begin to be in motion; and
 approach the surface, whither this industrious animal pursues them. On
 the contrary, in very dry weather, the mole seldom or never forms any
 hillocks; for then it is obliged to penetrate deeper after its prey, which at
 such seasons retire far into the ground.</P>
<P>As the moles very seldom come above ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, they have but few enemies; and very
 readily evade the pursuit of animals stronger and swifter than
 themselves. Their greatest calamity is an inundation; which, wherever it
 happens, they are seen, in numbers, attempting to save themselves by
 swimming, and using every effort to reach the higher grounds. The
 greatest part, however, perish, as well as their young, which remain in the
 holes behind. Were it not for such accidents, from their great fecundity,
 they would become extremely trou∣blesome; and as it is, in some places,
 they are considered by the farmer as his greatest pest. They couple
 towards the approach of spring; and their young are found about the beginning
 of May. They generally have four or five at a time; and it is easy to
 distinguish among other mole-hills, that in which the female has

 forth her young. These are made with much greater art than the rest; and
 are usually larger. The female, in order to form this retreat, begins by
 erecting the earth into a tolerably spacious apartment, which is sup∣ported
 within by partitions, at proper distances, that prevent the roof from
 falling. All round this she works, and beats the earth very firm, so as to
 make it capable of keeping out the rain, let it be never so violent. As the
 hillock in which this apartment is thus formed, is raised above ground, the
 apartment itself is conse∣quently above the level of the plain, and
 there∣fore less subject to accidental slight inundations. The place being
 thus fitted, she then procures grass and dry leaves, as a bed for her
 young. There they lie secure from wet, and she con∣tinues to make their
 retreat equally so from danger; for all round this hill of her own raising,
 are holes running into the earth, that part from the middle apartment, like
 rays from a center, and extend about fifteen feet in every direction: these
 resemble so many walks or chaces, into which the animal makes her
 sub∣terraneous excursions, and supplies her young with such roots or
 insects as she can provide: but they contribute still more to the general
 <PB N="98" REF="129"/> safety; for as the mole is very quick of hearing, the
 instant she perceives her little habitation attacked, she takes to her
 burrow, and unless the earth be dug away by several men at once, she and
 her young always make a good retreat.</P>
<P>The mole is scarcely found, except in culti∣vated countries: the
 varieties are but few. That which is found in Virginia, resembles the common
 mole, except in colour, which is black, mixed with a deep purple. There are
 sometimes white moles, seen particularly in Poland, rather larger than the
 former. As their skin is so very soft and beautiful, it is odd that it
 has not been turned to any ad∣vantage. Agricola tells us, that he saw hats
 made from it, the finest and the most beautiful that could be imagined.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Animals of the Hedge-hog, or prickly Kind.</HEAD>
<P>ANIMALS of the Hedge-hog kind require but very little accuracy to
 distinguish them from all others. That hair which serves the generality
 of quadrupedes for warmth and or∣nament, is partly wanting in these; while
 its place is supplied by sharp spines or prickles, that serve for their
 defence. This general cha∣racteristic, therefore, makes a much more ob∣vious
 distinction than any that can be taken from their teeth or their claws.
 Nature, by this extraordinary peculiarity, seems to have se∣parated them in
 a very distinguished manner; so that, instead of classing the
 hedge-hog among the moles, or the porcupine with the hare, as some have done,
 it is much more natural and obvious to place them, and others approaching them
 in this strange peculiarity, in a class by themselves: nor let it be
 supposed, that while I thus alter their arrangement, and separate them
 from animals with which they have been for∣merly combined, that I am
 destroying any secret affinities that exist in nature. It is natural,
 in∣deed, for readers to suppose, when they see two <PB N="100" REF="131"/>
 such opposite animals as the hare and the porcupine assembled together
 in the same groupe, that there must be some material rea∣son, some
 secret connexion, for thus joining animals so little resembling each
 other in appearance. But the reasons for this union were very slight, and
 merely arose from a simi∣litude in the fore teeth: no likeness in the
 in∣ternal conformation; no similitude in nature, in habitudes, or
 disposition; in short, nothing to fasten the link that combines them,
 but the similitude in the teeth: this, therefore, may be easily
 dispensed with; and, as was said, it will be most proper to class
 them according to their most striking similitudes.</P>
<P>The Hedge-hog, with an appearance the most formidable, is yet one
 of the most harmless animals in the world: unable or unwilling to offend,
 all its precautions are only directed to its own security; and it is armed
 with a thou∣sand points, to keep off the enemy, but not to invade him. While
 other creatures trust to their force, their cunning, or their swiftness,
 this animal, destitute of all, has but one ex∣pedient for safety; and from
 this alone it often finds protection. As soon as it perceives itself
 attacked, it withdraws all its vulnerable parts, rolls itself into a ball,
 and presents nothing but its defensive thorns to the enemy; thus, while 
 <PB N="101" REF="132"/> it attempts to injure no other quadrupede, they are
 equally incapable of injuring it: like those knights, we have somewhere
 read of, who were armed in such a manner, that they could neither conquer
 others, nor be themselves over∣come.</P>
<P>This animal is of two kinds; one with a nose like the snout of
 an hog; the other, more short and blunt, like that of a dog. That with the
 muzzle of a dog is the most common, being about six inches in length, from
 the tip of the nose to the insertion of the tail. The tail is little more
 than an inch long; and so concealed by the spines, as to be scarce
 visible: the head, back, and sides, are covered with prickles; the nose,
 breast, and belly, are covered with fine soft hair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Praeputium propendeus. 
 <BIBL>Linnaei Syst. 75.</BIBL> And of the female he might have
 said, resupina copulatur.</NOTE>; the legs are short, of a dusky
 colour, and almost bare; the toes on each foot are five in number, long and
 separated; the prickles are about an inch in length, and very sharp
 pointed; their lower part is white, the middle black, and the points white: the
 eyes are small, and placed high in the head; the ears are round, pretty
 large, and naked; the mouth is small, but well furnished with teeth;
 these, however, it only uses in chewing its food, <PB N="102" REF="133"/>
 but neither in attacking or defending itself against other animals. Its
 only reliance in cases of danger, is on its spines; the instant it
 per∣ceives an enemy, it puts itself into a posture of defence, and keeps
 upon its guard until it supposes the danger over. On such occasions, it
 immediately alters its whole appearance: from its usual form, somewhat
 resembling a small animal, with a bunch on its back, the animal begins to
 bend its back, to lay its head upon its breast, to shut its eyes, to roll
 down the skin of its sides towards the legs, to draw these up, and,
 lastly, to tuck them in on every side, by drawing the skin still
 closer. In this form, which the hedge-hog always puts on when disturbed, it
 no way resembles an animal, but rather a roundish mass of prickles,
 impervious on every side. The shape of the animal thus rolled up,
 somewhat resembles a chestnut in the husk; there being, on one side,
 a kind of flat space, which is that on which the head and legs have been
 tucked in.</P>
<P>Such is the usual appearance of the hedge-hog, upon the approach
 of any danger. Thus rolled up in a lump, it patiently waits till its enemy
 passes by, or is fatigued with fruitless attempts to annoy it. The cat,
 the weasel, the ferret, and the martin, quickly decline the combat; and the
 dog himself generally spends <PB N="103" REF="134"/> his time in empty
 menaces, rather than in ef∣fectual efforts. Every encrease of danger only
 encreases the animal's precautions to keep on its guard; its assailant
 vainly attempts to bite, since he thus more frequently feels than inflicts a
 wound; he stands enraged and barking, and rolls it along with his paws;
 still, however, the hedge-hog patiently submits to every indignity, but
 continues secure; and still more to disgust its enemy with the
 contest, sheds its urine, the smell of which is alone sufficient to
 send him away. In this manner the dog, after barking for some time, leaves
 the hedge-hog where he found him; who perceiving the danger past, at length
 peeps out from its ball, and, if not in∣terrupted, creeps slowly to its
 retreat.</P>
<P>The hedge-hog, like most other wild ani∣mals, sleeps by day, and
 ventures out by night. It generally resides in small thickets, in hedges,
 or in ditches covered with bushes; there it makes an hole of about six or
 eight inches deep, and lies well wrapped up, in moss, grass, or leaves. Its
 food is roots, fruits, worms, and insects. It is also said to suck
 cattle, and hurt their udders; but the smallness of its mouth will serve
 to clear it from this reproach. It is said also to be very hurtful in
 gardens and orchards, where it will roll itself in <PB N="104" REF="135"/> an
 heap of fruit, and so carry a large quantity away upon its prickles; but this
 imputation is as ill grounded as the former, since the spines are so
 disposed, that no fruit will stick upon them, even if we should try to
 fix them on. It rather appears to be a very serviceable animal, in ridding
 our fields of insects and worms, which are so prejudicial to
 vegetation.</P>
<P>Mr. Buffon, who kept these animals tame about his house, acquits
 them of the reproach of being mischievous in the garden; but then he
 accuses them of tricks, of which from the form and habits of this animal one
 would be never led to suspect them. 
 <Q REND="inline">"I have often," says he, "had the female and her
 young brought me about the beginning of June: they are generally from three to
 five in number: they are white in the beginning, and only the marks of their
 spines appear: I was willing to rear some of them, and accordingly put the
 dam and her young into a tub, with abundant provision beside them; but the
 old animal, instead of suckling her young, devoured them all, one after
 another. On another occasion, an hedge-hog that had made its way into the
 kitchen, discovered a little pot, in which there was meat prepared for
 boiling; the mischievous animal drew out the meat, and left its excrements in

 garden; they did very little damage, and it was scarcely perceivable that
 they were there: they lived upon the fruits that fell from the trees; they dug
 the earth into shallow holes; they eat catterpillars, beetles, and worms;
 they were also very fond of flesh, which they devoured boiled or
 raw."</Q></P>
<P>They couple in spring, and bring forth about the beginning of
 summer. They sleep during the winter; and what is said of their laying up
 provisions for that season, is conse∣quently false. They at no time
 eat much, and can remain very long without any food whatso∣ever. Their blood
 is cold, like all other animals that sleep during the winter. Their flesh
 is not good for food; and their skins are converted to scarce any use,
 except to muzzle calves, to keep them from sucking.</P>

 <PB N="106" REF="143"/> the hedge-hog, they are covered with prickles, though
 mixed in a greater proportion with hair; but unlike that animal, they do not
 de∣fend themselves by rolling up in a ball. Their wanting this last
 property is alone sufficient to distinguish them from an animal in which
 it makes the most striking peculiarity: as also, that in the East
 Indies, where only they are found, the hedge-hog exists separately also:
 a manifest proof that this animal is not a variety caused by the
 climate.</P>
<P>The Tanrec is much less than the hedge-hog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxv. p. 254.</BIBL></NOTE>, being about the
 size of a mole, and covered with prickles, like that animal, except that they
 are shorter and smaller. The Tendrac is still less than the former, and
 is defended only with prickles upon the head, the neck and the shoulders; the
 rest being covered with a coarse hair, resembling an hog's bristles.
 These little animals, whose legs are very short, move but slowly. They
 grunt like an hog; and wallow, like it, in the mire. They love to be near
 water; and spend more of their time there than upon land. They are chiefly in
 creeks and harbours of salt water. They mul∣tiply in great numbers, make
 themselves holes in the ground, and sleep for several months. 
 <PB N="107" REF="145"/> During this torpid state, their hairs (and I should
 also suppose their prickles) fall; and they are renewed upon their
 revival. They are usually very fat; and although their flesh be insipid,
 soft, and stringy, yet the Indians find it to their taste, and consider
 it as a very great delicacy.</P>

<P><PB N="107" REF="145"/>THOSE arms which the hedge-hog
 possesses in miniature, the Porcupine has in a more enlarged degree.
 The short prickles of the hedge-hog are in this animal con∣verted into
 shafts. In the one the spines are about an inch long; in the other, a foot.
 The porcupine is about two feet long, and fifteen inches high. Like the
 hedge-hog, it appears a mass of misshapen flesh, covered with quills,
 from ten to fourteen inches long, resembling the barrel of a goose-quill in
 thick∣ness; but tapering and sharp at both ends. These, whether
 considered separately or to∣gether, afford sufficient subject to detain
 curio∣sity Each quill is thickest in the middle; and inserted into the
 animal's skin, in the same manner as feathers are found to grow upon birds.
 It is within side spongy, like the top <PB REF="146"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="107" REF="147"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="108" REF="148"/> of a
 goose-quill; and of different colours, being white and black alternately,
 from one end to the other. The biggest are often found fifteen inches long,
 and a quarter of an inch in diameter; extremely sharp, and capable of
 inflicting a mortal wound. They seem harder than common quills, being
 difficult to be cut, and solid at that end which is not fixed in the skin.
 If we examine them in common, as they grow upon the animal, they appear of two
 kinds; the one such as I have already de∣scribed; the other, long, flexible
 and slender, growing here and there among the former. There is still
 another sort of quills, that grow near the tail, white and transparent,
 like writing quills, and that seem to be cut short at the end. All these
 quills, of whatsoever kind, incline backwards, like the bristles of an hog;
 but when the animal is irritated, they rise, and stand upright, as
 bristles are seen to do.</P>
<P>Such is the formation of this quadrupede, in those parts in
 which it differs from most others: as to the rest of its figure, the muzzle
 bears some resemblance to that of an hare, but black; the legs are very
 short, and the feet have five toes, both before and behind; and these, as
 well as the belly, the head, and all other parts of the body, are covered with
 a sort of short hair, like <PB N="109" REF="149"/> prickles, there being no
 part, except the ears and the sole of the foot, that is free from them: the
 ears are thinly covered with very fine hair; and are in shape like those of
 mankind: the eyes are small, like those of an hog, being only one third of
 an inch from one corner to the other. After the skin is taken off, there
 appear a kind of paps on those parts of the body from whence the large quills
 proceed; these are about the size of a small pea, each answering to as
 many holes which appear on the outward surface of the skin, and which are
 about half an inch deep, like as many hollow pipes, wherein the quills are
 fixed, as in so many sheaths.</P>
<P>This animal seems to partake very much of the nature of the
 hedge-hog; having this for∣midable apparatus of arms rather to defend
 it∣self, than annoy the enemy. There have been, indeed, many naturalists
 who supposed that it was capable of discharging them at its foes, and
 killing at a great distance off. But this opinion has been entirely
 discredited of late; and it is now universally believed that its quills
 remain firmly fixed in the skin, and are then only shed when the animal
 moults them, as birds do their feathers. It is true, we are told by Ellis, that
 a wolf at Hudson's Bay was found dead, with the quills of a porcupine fixed
 within its mouth; <PB N="110" REF="150"/> which might have very well happened,
 from the voraciousness of the former, and not the resentment of the
 latter. That rapacious crea∣ture, in the rage of appetite, might have
 at∣tempted to devour the porcupine, quills and all, and very probably paid the
 forfeit, by its life. However this be, of all the porcupines that have been
 brought into Europe, not one was ever seen to launch their quills; and yet
 the irritations they received were sufficient to have provoked their utmost
 indignation. Of all the porcupines that Doctor Shaw observed in Africa, and
 he saw numbers, not one ever attempted to dart its quills; their usual
 manner of defence being, to lie on one side, and when the enemy approaches
 very near, by suddenly rising, to wound him with the points on the
 other.</P>
<P>It is probable, therefore, that the porcupine is seldom the
 aggressor; and when attacked by the bolder animals, it only directs its
 quills so as to keep always pointing towards the enemy. These are an ample
 protection; and, as we are assured by Kolben, at such times, even the
 lion himself will not venture to make an attack. From such, therefore, the
 porcupine can defend itself; and chiefly hunts for serpents, and all other
 reptiles, for subsistence. Travellers uni∣versally assure us that,
 between the serpent and <PB N="111" REF="151"/> the porcupine there exists
 an irreconcileable enmity, and that they never meet without a mortal
 engagement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bosman. Smith. L. P. Vincent Marie,
 &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>. The porcupine, on these occasions, is said to roll
 itself upon the serpent, and thus destroy and devour it. This may be
 true; while what we are informed by Monsieur Sarrasin, of the porcupine of
 Canada chiefly subsisting on vegetables, may be equally so. Those
 which are brought to this country to be shewn, are usually fed on bread,
 milk, and fruits; but they will not refuse meat when it is offered them; and
 it is probable, they prefer it in a wild state, when it is to be had<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. The porcupine is also
 known to be extremely hurt∣ful to gardens; and, where it enters, does
 in∣credible damage.</P>
<P>The Americans, who hunt this animal, assure us, that the
 porcupine lives from twelve to fif∣teen years. During the time of coupling,
 which is in the month of September, the males become very fierce and dangerous,
 and often are seen to destroy each other with their teeth. The female goes
 with young seven months, and brings forth but one at a time; this she
 suckles but about a month, and accustoms it betimes to live, like
 herself, upon vegetables and the <PB N="112" REF="152"/> bark of trees; she
 is very fierce in its defence; but, at other seasons, she is fearful,
 timid, and harmless. The porcupine never attempts to bite, nor any way to
 injure its pursuers: if hunted by a dog or a wolf, it instantly climbs up a
 tree, and continues there until it has wearied out the patience of its
 adversary; the wolf knows by experience how fruitless it would be to wait,
 he therefore leaves the porcupine above, and seeks out for a new
 adventure.</P>
<P>The porcupine does not escape so well from the Indian hunter,
 who eagerly pursues it, in order to make embroidery of its quills, and to eat
 its flesh. This, as we are commonly told, is very tolerable eating; however,
 we may ex∣pect wretched provisions when the savages are to be our caterers,
 for they eat every thing that has life. But they are very ingenious with regard
 to their embroidery: if I understand the accounts rightly, they dye the
 quills of va∣rious colours, and then splitting them into slips, as we see
 in the making of a cane-chair, they embroider, with these, their belts,
 baskets, and several other necessary pieces of furniture.</P>
<P>As to the rest, there are many things related concerning this
 animal that are fabulous; but there are still many circumstances more, that
 yet remain to be known. It were curious to <PB N="113" REF="153"/> enquire
 whether this animal molts its quills when wild, for it is never seen to
 shed them in a domestic state; whether it sleeps all the winter, as we
 are told by some naturalists, which we are sure it does not when brought
 into our country; and, lastly, whether its quills can be sent off with a
 shake; for no less a na∣turalist than Reaumur was of that opinion.</P>
<P>All that we can learn of an animal exposed as a shew, or even
 by its dissection, is but merely its conformation; and that makes one of
 the least interesting parts of its history. We are natu∣rally led, when
 presented with an extraordinary creature, to expect something extraordinary
 in its way of living, something uncommon, and cor∣sponding with its figure;
 but of this animal we know little with any precision, except what it offers
 in a state of captivity. In such a situa∣tion, that which I saw,
 appeared to very little advantage: it was extremely dull and torpid, though
 very wakeful; and extremely voracious, though very capable of sustaining
 hunger; as averse to any attachment, as to being tamed: it was kept in an
 iron cage, and the touching one of the bars was sufficient to excite its
 resent∣ment, for its quills were instantly erected; and the poet was right
 in his epithet of fretful, for <PB N="114" REF="154"/> it appeared to me the
 most irascible creature upon earth.</P>
<P>The porcupines of America differ very much from that of the
 ancient continent, which we have been describing; and, strictly speaking,
 may be considered as animals of a different species: however, from their
 being covered with quills, we will only add them as varieties of the former,
 since we know very little con∣cerning them, except their difference of
 figure. They are of two kinds; the one called the Couando; and the other,
 first named by Mr. Buffon, the Urson: the one a native of the northern
 parts of America; the other of the south; and both differing from the former,
 in having long tails, whereas that has a very short one.</P>
<P>The Couando is much less than the por∣cupine; its quills are
 four times shorter, its snout more unlike that of an hare; its tail is long
 enough to catch by the branches of trees, and hold by them. It may be easily
 tamed, and is to be found chiefly in the southern parts of America; yet is
 not wanting also in the northern.</P>
<P>The Urson, which Mr. Buffon calls after our countryman Hudson,
 is a native of Hud∣son's Bay. The make of the body of this 
 <PB N="115" REF="155"/> animal is not so round as that of the two for∣mer, but
 somewhat resembling the shape of a pig. It is covered with long bristly
 hair, with a shorter hair underneath; and under this the quills lie concealed
 very thick; they are white, with a brown point, and bearded, and the longest
 do not exceed four inches; they stick to the hand when the animal is
 stroked on the back; and likewise, when the hand is taken away, they
 stick so fast as to follow it. They make their nest under the roots of
 great trees, sleep very much, and chiefly feed upon the bark of the juniper.
 In winter the snow serves them for drink; and in summer they lap water,
 like a dog. They are very common in the country lying to the east of
 Hudson's Bay; and several of the trading Americans depend on them for food,
 at some seasons of the year.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Quadrupedes covered with Scales or Shells instead
 of Hair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This chapter is chiefly extracted from Mr.
 Buffon, which I mention at once, to save the trouble of repeated
 quotation.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we talk of a quadrupede, the name seems to imply an animal
 covered with hair; when we mention a bird, it is natural to conceive a creature
 covered with feathers; when we hear of a fish, its scales are generally the
 first part that strikes our imagination. Nature, however, owns none of our
 distinctions; various in all her operations, she mixes her plans, groupes
 her pictures, and excites our wonder as well by her general laws as by her
 deviations. Quadru∣pedes, which we have considered as making the first
 general class in animated nature, and next to man the most dignified
 tenants of the earth, are yet in many respects related to the classes
 beneath them, and do not in every respect pre∣serve their usual
 distinctions. Their first cha∣racter, which consists in having four
 feet, is <PB N="117" REF="157"/> common to the lizard kind as well as to them.
 The second prerogative, which is that of bring∣ing forth living young, is
 found in the cetaceous tribe of fishes, and also in insects without
 num∣ber. Their third and last attribute, which seems more general and
 constant than the former, that of being covered with hair, is yet found in
 various other animals, and is deficient in quadrupedes themselves. Thus we
 must be cautious of judging of the nature of animals from one single
 character, which is always found incomplete; for it often happens that three or
 four of the most general characters will not suffice. It must be by a
 general enumeration of the parts that we can determine precisely of the works
 of the creation; and, instead of de∣finitions, learn to describe. Had this
 method been followed, much of the disgust and the in∣tricacy of history
 might have been avoided, and that time, which is now employed in combating
 error, laid out in the promoting of science.</P>
<P>Were we to judge of nature from definitions only, we should never
 be induced to suppose that there existed races of viviparous quadru∣pedes
 destitute of hair, and furnished with scales and shells in their
 stead. However, nature, every way various, supplies us with many
 in∣stances <PB N="118" REF="158"/> of these extraordinary creatures; the old
 world has its quadrupedes covered with scales, and the new with a shell. In
 both they resemble each other, as well in the strangeness of their
 appetites as in their aukward conformation. Like animals but partially made up,
 and par∣taking of different natures, they want those in∣stincts which
 animals formed but for one ele∣ment alone are found to possess. They
 seem to be a kind of strangers in nature, creatures taken from some other
 element, and capriciously thrown to find a precarious subsistence upon
 land.</P>
<P>The Pangolin, which has been usually called the Scaly Lizard, Mr.
 Buffon very judiciously restores to that denomination by which it is known
 in the countries where it is found The calling it a lizard, he justly
 observes, might be apt to produce error, and occasion its being confounded
 with an animal which it resembles only in its general form, and in its being
 covered with scales. The lizard may be considered as a reptile, produced
 from an egg; the pangolin is a quadrupede, and brought forth alive and
 perfectly formed. The lizard is all over covered with the marks of scales;
 the pangolin has scales neither on the throat, the breast, or the 
 <PB REF="159"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="119" REF="160"/> belly. The scales of the lizard
 seem stuck upon the body even closer than those of fishes; the
 scales of the pangolin are only fixed at one end, and capable of being
 erected, like those of the porcupine, at the will of the animal. The lizard
 is a defenceless creature; the pangolin can roll itself into a ball, like
 the hedge-hog, and present the points of its scales to the enemy, which
 effectually defend it.</P>
<P>The Pangolin, which is a native of the torrid climates of the
 ancient continent, is, of all other animals, the best protected from external
 in∣jury by Nature. It is about three or four feet long, or, taking in the tail,
 from six to eight. Like the lizard, it has a small head, a very long
 nose, a short thick neck, a long body, legs very short, and a tail
 extremely long, thick at the insertion, and terminating in a point. It has no
 teeth, but is armed with five toes on each foot, with long white claws. But
 what it is chiefly distinguished by is its scaly covering, which in
 some measure hides all the proportions of its body. These scales defend
 the animal on all parts, except the under part of the head and neck, under the
 shoulders, the breast, the belly, and the inner side of the legs; all
 which parts are covered with a smooth soft skin, with∣out <PB REF="161"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="119" REF="162"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="120" REF="163"/> hair.
 Between the shells of this animal, at all the interstices, are seen hairs
 like bristles, brown at the extremity and yellow towards the root. The
 scales of this extraordinary creature are of different sizes and different
 forms, and stuck upon the body somewhat like the leaves of an artichoak.
 The largest are found near the tail, which is covered with them like the
 rest of the body. These are above three inches broad, and about two inches
 long, thick in the middle and sharp at the edges, and terminated in a
 roundish point. They are extremely hard, and their substance resembles
 that of horn. They are convex on the outside and a little con∣cave on the
 inner; one edge sticks in the skin, while the other laps over that
 immediately be∣hind it. Those that cover the tail conform to the shape of
 that part, being of a dusky brown colour, and so hard, when the animal has
 ac∣quired its full growth, as to turn a musquet-ball.</P>
<P>Thus armed, this animal fears nothing from the efforts of all other
 creatures, except man. The instant it perceives the approach of an enemy, it
 rolls itself up like the hedge-hog, and presents no part but the cutting
 edges of its scales to the assailant. Its long tail, which, 
 <PB N="121" REF="164"/> at first view, might be thought easily separable,
 serves still more to encrease the animal's se∣curity. This is lapped
 round the rest of the body, and, being defended with shells even more
 cutting than any other part, the creature continues in perfect security. Its
 shells are so large, so thick, and so pointed, that they repel every
 animal of prey; they make a coat of ar∣mour that wounds while it resists,
 and at once protects and threatens. The most cruel, the most famished
 quadrupede of the forest, the tiger, the panther, and the hyena, make vain
 attempts to force it. They tread upon, they roll it about, but all to no
 purpose; the pangolin remains safe within, while its invader almost
 always feels the reward of its rashness. The fox often destroys the
 hedge-hog by pressing it with his weight, and thus obliges it to put forth
 its nose, which he in∣stantly seizes, and soon after the whole body;
 but the scales of the pangolin effectually sup∣port it under any such
 weight, while nothing that the strongest animals are capable of doing can
 compel it to surrender. Man alone seems furnished with arms to conquer
 its obstinacy. The Negroes of Africa, when they find it, beat it to death
 with clubs, and consider its flesh as a very great delicacy.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="165"/>But, although this animal be so formidable
 in its appearance, there cannot be a more harm∣less inoffensive creature
 when unmolested. It is even unqualified by Nature to injure larger animals,
 if it had the disposition, for it has no teeth. It should seem that the
 bony matter, which goes in other animals to supply the teeth, is exhausted
 in this in supplying the scales that go to the covering of its body.
 However this be, its life seems correspondent to its peculiar conformation.
 Incapable of being carnivorous, since it has no teeth, nor of
 subsisting on ve∣getables, which require much chewing, it lives entirely
 upon insects, for which Nature has fitted it in a very extraordinary manner.
 As it has a long nose, so it may naturally be supposed to have a long
 tongue; but, to encrease its length still more, it is doubled in the mouth,
 so that when extended it is shot out to above a quarter of a yard beyond
 the tip of the nose. This tongue is round, extremely red, and covered with an
 unctuous and slimy liquor, which gives it a shining hue. When the pangolin,
 therefore, approaches an ant hill, for these are the insects on which it
 chiefly feeds, it lies down near it, concealing as much as possible the
 place of its retreat, and stretching out its long tongue 
 <PB N="123" REF="166"/> among the ants, keeps it for some time quite
 immoveable. These little animals, allured by its appearance, and the unctuous
 substance with which it is imeared, instantly gather upon it in great
 numbers; and when the pangolin supposes a sufficiency, it quickly
 withdraws the tongue, and swallows them at once. This peculiar manner of
 hunting for its prey is repeated either till it be satisfied, or till the
 ants, grown more cautious, will be allured to their destruction no longer. It
 is against these noxious insects, therefore, that its only force or
 cunning is exerted; and were the Negroes but sufficiently sensible of its
 utility in destroying one of the greatest pests to their country, they
 would not be so eager to kill it. But it is the nature of savage man to
 pursue the immediate good, with∣out being solicitous about the more
 distant be∣nefit they remove. They, therefore, hunt this animal, with the
 utmost avidity, for its flesh; and, as it is slow and unable to escape
 in an open place, they seldom fail of destroying it. However, it chiefly
 keeps in the most obscure parts of the forest, and digs itself a
 retreat in the clefts of rocks, where it brings forth its young, so that it
 is but rarely met with, and continues a solitary species, and an
 extraor∣dinary instance of the varying of Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="167"/>Of this animal, there is a variety which is
 called the Phatagin, much less than the former, being not above a foot long
 from the head to the tail, with shells differently formed, with its belly,
 breast, and throat covered with hair, in∣stead of a smooth skin as in
 the former; but that by which it is peculiarly distinguished is the ex∣tent
 of its tail, which is above twice the length of its body. Both are found in the
 warm lati∣tudes of the East, as well as in Africa; and, as their numbers are
 but few, it is to be supposed their fecundity is not great.</P>

<HEAD>THE ARMADILLO OR TATOU.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING mentioned quadrupedes of the ancient continent covered with
 scales, we come next to quadrupedes of the new continent co∣vered with
 shells. It would seem that Nature had reserved all the wonders of her
 power for these remote and thinly inhabited countries, where the men are
 savage and the quadrupedes various. It would seem that she becomes more
 extraordinary in proportion as she retires from human inspection. But the
 real fact is, that wherever mankind are polished, or thickly planted, they
 soon rid the earth of these odd <PB REF="168"/>

 formed productions, that in some measure encumber the soil. They soon
 disap∣pear in a cultivated country, and continue to exist only in those
 remote deserts where they have no enemies but such as they are enabled to
 oppose.</P>
<P>The Armadillo is chiefly an inhabitant of South America; a
 peaceful harmless creature, incapable of offending any other quadrupede, and
 furnished with a peculiar covering for its own defence. The pangolin,
 described above, seems an inactive helpless being, indebted for safety
 more to its patience than its power; but the armadillo is still more
 exposed and help∣less. The pangolin is furnished with an armour that
 wounds while it resists, and that is never attacked with impunity; but the
 armadillo is obliged to submit to every insult, without any power of
 repelling its enemy; it is attacked without danger, and is consequently
 liable to more various persecutions.</P>
<P>This animal being covered, like a tortoise, with a shell, or
 rather a number of shells, its other proportions are not easily
 discerned. It appears, at first view, a round mishapen mass, with a
 long head, and a very large tail sticking out at either end, as if not of a
 piece with the <PB N="126" REF="172"/> rest of the body. It is of different
 sizes, from a foot to three feet long, and covered with a shell divided
 into several pieces, that lap over each other like the plates in a coat of
 armour, or in the tail of a lobster. The difference in the size of this
 animal, and also the different dis∣position and number of its plates,
 have been considered as constituting so many species, each marked with
 its own particular name. In all, however, the animal is partially covered with
 this natural coat of mail; the confirmation of which affords one of the most
 striking curiosities in natural history. This shell, which in every
 respect resembles a bony substance, covers the head, the neck, the
 back, the sides, the rump, and the tail to the very point. The only parts to
 which it does not extend are, the throat, the breast, and the belly, which
 are covered with a white soft skin, somewhat resembling that of a fowl
 stripped of its feathers. If these naked parts be observed with
 attention, they will be found covered with the rudiments of shells, of the
 same substance with those which cover the back. The skin, even in the
 parts that are softest, seems to have a tendency to ossify; but a
 complete ossification takes place only on those parts which have the
 least friction and are the <PB N="127" REF="173"/> most exposed to the
 weather. The shell, which covers the upper part of the body, differs from
 that of the tortoise, in being composed of more pieces than one, which lie
 in bands over the body, and, as in the tail of the lobster, slide over each
 other, and are connected by a yellow membrane in the same manner. By this
 means the animal has a motion in its back, and the armour gives way to its
 necessary inflexions. These bands are of various numbers and sizes, and
 from them these animals have been distin∣guished into various kinds. In
 general, how∣ever, there are two large pieces that cover, one the shoulders
 and the other the rump. In the back, between these, the bands are placed in
 different numbers, that lap over each other, and give play to the whole.
 Besides their open∣ing cross-ways, they also open down along the back,
 so that the animal can move in every di∣rection. In some there are but
 three of these bands between the large pieces; in others there are six; in
 a third kind there are eight; in a fourth kind, nine; in a fifth kind, twelve;
 and, lastly, in the sixth kind there is but one large piece, which covers
 the shoulders, and the rest of the body is covered with bands all down to
 the tail. These shells are differently coloured <PB N="128" REF="174"/> in
 different kinds, but most usually they are of a dirty grey. This colour in
 all arises from another peculiar circumstance in their confor∣mation, for
 the shell itself is covered with a softish skin, which is smooth
 and transparent.</P>
<P>But, although these shells might easily defend this animal
 from a feeble enemy, yet they could make but a slight resistance
 against a more powerful antagonist; Nature, therefore, has given the
 armadillo the same method of pro∣tecting itself with the hedge-hog or the
 pan∣golin. The instant it perceives itself attacked, it withdraws the head
 under its shells, and lets nothing be seen but the tip of the nose; if
 the danger encreases, the animal's precautions en∣crease in proportion; it
 then tucks up its feet under its belly, unites its two extremities to∣gether,
 while the tail seems as a band to strengthen the connection; and it thus
 becomes like a ball, a little flattish on each side. In this position it
 continues obstinately fixed, while the danger is near, and often long after
 it is over. In this situation it is tossed about at the pleasure of
 every other quadrupede, and very little resembling a creature endowed with
 life and motion. Whenever the Indians take it, which is in this form, by laying
 it close to the <PB N="129" REF="175"/> fire, they soon oblige the poor
 animal to unfold itself, and to face a milder death to escape a more
 severe.</P>
<P>This animal is a native only of America, for they were utterly
 unknown before the discovery of that continent. It is an inoffen∣sive
 harmless creature, unless it finds the way into a garden, where it does a
 great deal of mischief, by eating the melons, the potatoes, and other
 vegetables. Although a native of the warmest parts of America, yet it bears
 the cold of our climate without any inconvenience. We have often seen them
 shewn among other wild beasts, which is a sign they are not dif∣ficult to
 be brought over. Their motion seems to be a swift walk, but they can
 neither run, leap, nor climb trees; so that, if found in an open place, they
 have no method of escaping from their pursuers. Their only resource in
 such an extremity is to make towards their hole as fast as they can; or, if
 this be impracticable, to make a new hole before the enemy arrives. For this
 they require but a very few moments advantage; for the mole itself does not
 burrow swifter than they can. For this purpose, they are furnished with
 claws extremely large, strong, and crooked, and usually four upon each
 foot. They are sometimes caught by the tail as they <PB N="130" REF="176"/>
 are making their way into the earth; but such is their resistance, and
 so difficult it is to draw them backward, that they leave their tail in the
 hand of their pursuer, and are very well contented to save their lives with
 its loss. The pursuers, sensible of this, never drag the tail with all
 their force, but hold it while another digs the ground about them, and thus
 these animals are taken alive. The instant the arma∣dillo perceives
 itself in the power of its enemies, it has but one last resource, to roll
 itself up, and thus patiently wait whatever tortures they think proper to
 inflict. The flesh of the smaller kinds is said to be delicate eating;
 so that we may suppose they receive no mercy. For this reason, they are
 pursued with un∣ceasing industry; and, although they burrow very deep in
 the earth, there have been many expedients used to force them out. The
 hunters sometimes contrive to fill the hole with smoke, which is often
 successful; they at other times force it by pouring in water. They also
 bring up a small kind of dogs to the chace that quickly overtake them, if at
 any distance from their bur∣row, and oblige them to roll themselves up in a
 ball, in which figure the hunters carry them home. If, however, the armadillo
 be near a precipice, it often escapes by rolling itself up, 
 <PB N="131" REF="177"/> and then tumbling down from rock to rock, without the
 least danger or inconvenience. They are sometimes taken in snares laid
 for them by the sides of rivers and low moist places, which they
 particularly frequent; and this me∣thod, in general, succeeds better than any
 of the former, as their burrows are very deep, and they seldom stir out
 except in the night. At no time are they found at any great distance from
 their retreats, so that it requires some patience and skill to intercept
 their retreat.</P>
<P>There are scarce any of these that do not root the ground,
 like an hog, in search of such roots as make a principal part of their
 food. They live also upon melons and other succulent ve∣getables, and all
 will eat flesh when they can get it. They frequent water and watery places,
 where they feed upon worms, small fish, and water insects. It is
 pretended that there is a kind of friendship between them and the
 rattle-snake, that they live peaceably and commo∣diously together, and are
 frequently found in the same hole. This, however, may be a friend∣ship of
 necessity to the armadillo; the rattle-snake takes possession of
 its retreats, which neither are willing to quit while each is inca∣pable of
 injuring the other.</P>
<P>As to the rest, these animals, though they 
 <PB N="132" REF="178"/> all resemble each other in the general character of
 being cloathed with a shell, yet differ a good deal in their size, and in
 the parts into which their shell is divided. The first of this kind, which
 has but three bands between the two large pieces that cover the back, is called
 the Tatu Apara. I will not enter into an exact de∣scription of its figure,
 which, how well written soever, no imagination could exactly conceive; and
 the reader would be more fatigued to un∣derstand than I to write it. The tail
 is shorter in this than any other kind, being not more than two inches long,
 while the shell, taking all the pieces together, is a foot long and eight
 inches broad. The second is the Tatou of Ray, or the Encoubert of Buffon;
 this is distinguished from the rest by six bands across the back; it
 is about the size of a pig of a month old, with a small long head and a
 very long tail. The third is the Tatuette, furnished with eight bands, and
 not by a great deal so big as the former. Its tail is longer also, and its
 legs shorter in pro∣portion. Its body, from the nose to the inser∣tion of
 the tail, is about ten inches long, and the tail seven. The fourth is the
 Pig-headed Armadillo, with nine bands. This is much larger than the former,
 being about two foot long from the nose to the tail. The fifth is the 
 <PB N="133" REF="179"/> Kabassou, or Cataphractus, with twelve bands, and
 still bigger than the former, or any other of its kind. This is often found
 above three feet long, but is never eaten as the rest are. The sixth is the
 Weasel-headed Armadillo, with eighteen bands, with a large piece before, and
 nothing but bands backward. This is above a foot long, and the tail five
 inches. Of all these, the Kabbassou and the Encoubert are the largest;
 the rest are of a much smaller kind. In the larger kinds, the shell is
 much more solid than in the others, and the flesh is much harder and unfit
 for the table. These are generally seen to reside in dry upland grounds,
 while the small species are always found in moist places, and in the
 neighbourhood of brooks and rivers. They all roll themselves into a ball; but
 those whose bands are fewest in number are least capable of covering
 themselves up completely. The Tatu Apara, for instance, when rolled up,
 presents two great interstices between its bands, by which it is very
 easily vulnerable, even by the feeblest of quadrupedes.</P>

<PB N="134" REF="180"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of Animals of the Bat Kind.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in the last chapter described a race of animals that
 unite the boundaries be∣tween quadrupedes and insects, I come in this to a
 very different class, that serve to fill up the chasm between quadrupedes
 and birds. Some naturalists, indeed, have found animals of the bat kind so
 much partaking of the nature of both, that they have been at a loss in which
 rank to place them, and have doubted, in giving the history of the Bat,
 whether it was a beast or a bird they were describing. These doubts,
 however, no longer exist; they are now universally made to take their place
 among quadrupedes, to which their bringing forth their young alive, their hair,
 their teeth, as well as the rest of their habi∣tudes and conformation,
 evidently entitle them. Pliny, Gesner, and Aldrovandus, who placed them among
 birds, did not consider that they wanted every character of that order of
 animals, except the power of flying. Indeed, when this animal is seen with an
 aukward and struggling motion, supporting itself in the air at the dusk
 of the evening, it presents in some measure the <PB N="135" REF="181"/>
 appearance of a bird; but naturalists, whose business it is to examine
 it more closely, to watch its habitudes, and inspect into its forma∣tion,
 are inexcusable for concurring in the mistake.</P>
<P>The bat in scarce any particular resembles the bird, except in
 its power of sustaining itself in the air. It brings forth its young
 alive; it suckles them; its mouth is furnished with teeth; its lungs are
 formed like those of qua∣drupedes; its intestines, and its skeleton, have
 a complete resemblance, and even are, in some measure, seen to
 resemble those of mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Penis
 Propendens.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bat most common in England, is about the size of a mouse;
 or nearly two inches and an half long. The membranes that are usually called
 wings, are, properly speaking, an ex∣tension of the skin all round the
 body, except the head, which, when the animal flies, is kept stretched on
 every side, by the four interior toes of the fore feet, which are
 enormously long, and serve like masts that keep the can∣vass of a
 sail spread, and regulate its motions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. The first toe is quite
 loose, and serves as a heel when the bat walks, or as an hook, when it
 would adhere to any thing. The hind feet are disengaged from the
 surrounding skin, <PB N="136" REF="182"/> and divided into five toes,
 somewhat resem∣bling those of a mouse. The skin by which it flies is
 of a dusky colour. The body is covered with a short fur, of a mouse
 colour, tinged with red. The eyes are very small; the ears like those of a
 mouse.</P>
<P>This species of the bat is very common in England. It makes its
 first appearance early in summer, and begins its flight in the dusk of
 the evening. It principally frequents the sides of woods, glades, and shady
 walks; and is frequently observed to skim along the surface of pieces of
 water. It pursues gnats, moths, and nocturnal insects of every kind. It
 feeds upon these; but will not refuse meat, wherever it can find it. Its
 flight is a laborious, irre∣gular movement; and if it happens to be
 in∣terrupted in its course, it cannot readily pre∣pare for a second
 elevation; so that if it strikes against any object, and falls to the
 ground, it is usually taken. It appears only in the most pleasant
 evenings, when its prey is generally abroad, and flies in pursuit with its
 mouth open. At other times it continues in its re∣treat; the chink of a ruined
 building, or the hollow of a tree. Thus this little animal, even in summer,
 sleeps the greatest part of its time, never venturing out by day-light, nor
 in rainy <PB N="137" REF="183"/> weather; never hunting in quest of prey, but
 for a small part of the night, and then return∣ing to its hole. But its
 short life is still more abridged by continuing in a torpid state during
 the winter. At the approach of the cold season, the bat prepares for its
 state of lifeless inactivity, and seems rather to chuse a place where
 it may continue safe from interruption, than where it may be warmly or
 conveniently lodged. For this reason it is usually seen hanging by its
 hooked claws to the roofs of caves, regardless of the eternal damps that
 surround it. The bat seems the only animal that will venture to remain in
 these frightful subterranean abodes, where it continues in a torpid
 state, unaffected by every change of the weather. Such of this kind as are
 not provident enough to procure themselves a deep retreat, where the cold and
 heat seldom vary, are sometimes exposed to great inconveniences, for the
 weather often becomes so mild in the midst of winter as to warm them
 prematurely into life, and to allure them from their holes in quest of food,
 when Nature has not provided a supply. These, therefore, have seldom
 strength to return; but, having exhausted themselves in a vain pursuit,
 after insects which are not to be found, are destroyed by the owl, or any
 other animal that follows such petty prey.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="184"/>The bat couples and brings forth in summer,
 generally from two to five at a time: of this I am certain, that I have found
 five young ones in a hole together; but whether they were the issue of one
 parent, I cannot tell. The female has but two nipples, and those forward on
 the breast, as in the human kind. This was a suf∣ficient motive for
 Linnaeus to give it the title of a Primas, to rank it in the same order with
 mankind; and to push this contemptible animal among the chiefs of the
 creation. Such ar∣bitrary associations produce rather ridicule than
 instruction, and render even method contemp∣tible: however, we are to forgive
 too strong an attachment to system in this able naturalist, since his
 application to the particular history of the animal, counterbalances the
 defect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Fauna Succica. p. 8.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From Linnaeus we learn, that the female makes no nest for her
 young, as most birds and quadru∣pedes are known to do. She is barely content
 with the first hole she meets, where sticking her∣self by her hooks
 against the sides of her apart∣ment, she permits her young to hang at the
 nipple, and in this manner to continue for the first or second day. When,
 after some time, the dam begins to grow hungry, and finds a necessity of
 stirring abroad, she takes her little <PB N="139" REF="185"/> ones and
 sticks them to the wall, in the manner she before hung herself; there
 they immoveably cling, and patiently wait till her return.</P>
<P>Thus far this animal seems closely allied to the quadrupede
 race. Its similitude to that of birds is less striking. As Nature has
 furnished birds with extremely strong pectoral muscles, to move the
 wings, and direct their flight, so has it also furnished this animal. As
 birds also have their legs weak, and unfit for the purposes of motion, the
 bat has its legs fashioned in the same manner, and is never seen to walk,
 or, more properly speaking, to push itself forward with its hind legs,
 but in cases of extreme ne∣cessity. The toes of the fore legs, or, if we
 may use the expression, its extremely long fingers, extend the web like a
 membrane that lies between them; and this, which is ex∣tremely thin, serves
 to lift the little body into the air: in this manner, by an unceasing
 per∣cussion, much swifter than that of birds, the animal continues, and
 directs its flight; how∣ever, the great labour required in flying, soon
 fatigues it; for, unlike birds, which continue for days together upon the wing,
 the bat is tired in less than an hour, and then returns to its hole,
 satisfied with its supply, to enjoy the darkness of its retreat.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="186"/>If we consider the bat as it is seen in
 our own country, we shall find it an harmless, inoffensive creature. It
 is true that it now and then steals into a larder, and, like a mouse,
 commits its petty thefts upon the fattest parts of the bacon. But this
 happens seldom; the general tenor of its industry is employed in pursuing
 insects that are much more noxious to us than itself can possibly be;
 while its evening flight, and its unsteady wabbling motion, amuse the
 ima∣gination, and add one figure more to the pleasing groupe of animated
 nature.</P>
<P>The varieties of this animal, especially in our country, are but
 few; and the differences scarce worth enumeration. Naturalists mention the
 Long ear'd Bat, much less than that generally seen, and with much longer
 ears; the Horse shoe Bat, with an odd protuberance round its upper lip,
 somewhat in the form of an horse-shoe; the Rhinoceros Bat, with an horn
 growing from the nose, somewhat similar to that animal from whence it has
 the name. These, with several others, whose varieties are too numerous,
 and differences too minute for a detail, are all in∣offensive, minute, and
 contemptible; incapable, from their size, of injuring mankind, and not
 sufficiently numerous much to incommode him. But there is a larger race of
 bats, found in the <PB N="141" REF="187"/> East and West-Indies, that are
 truly for∣midable; each of these is singly a dangerous enemy; but when they
 unite in flocks, they then become dreadful. Were the inhabitants of the African
 coasts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Des Marchais, vol. ii. p.
 208.</BIBL></NOTE>, says Des Marchais, to eat animals of the bat kind, as
 they do in the East-Indies, they would never want a supply of provisions.
 They are there in such numbers, that, when they fly, they obscure the
 setting sun. In the morning, at peep of day, they are seen sticking
 upon the tops of the trees, and clinging to each other, like bees when they
 swarm, or like large clusters of coco. The Europeans often amuse
 themselves with shoot∣ing among this huge mass of living crea∣tures, and
 observing their embarrassment when wounded. They sometimes enter the
 houses, and the Negroes are expert at killing them; but although these
 people seem for ever hungry, yet they regard the bat with horror, and will
 not eat it, though ready to starve.</P>
<P>Of foreign bats, the largest we have any cer∣tain accounts of, is
 the Rousette, or the Great Bat of Madagascar. This formidable creature is
 near four feet broad, when the wings are ex∣tended; and a foot long, from the
 tip of the <PB N="142" REF="188"/> nose to the insertion of the tail. It
 resembles our bat in the form of its wings, in its manner of flying, and in
 its internal conformation. It differs from it in its enormous size; in its
 colour, which is red, like that of a fox; in its head and nose also, which
 resemble those of that animal, and which have induced some to call it the
 flying fox: it differs also in the number of its teeth; and in having a claw
 on the fore foot, which is wanting in ours. This formidable creature is found
 only in the ancient continent; particularly in Madagascar, along the coasts
 of Africa and Malabar, where it is usually seen about the size of a large
 hen. When they re∣pose, they stick themselves to the tops of the
 tallest trees, and hang with their heads down∣ward. But when they are in
 motion, nothing can be more formidable: they are seen in clouds, darkening
 the air, as well by day as by night, destroying the ripe fruits of the
 country, and sometimes settling upon animals, and man himself: they
 devour, indiscriminately, fruits, flesh, and insects, and drink the juice
 of the palm-tree: they are heard at night in the forests at more than two
 miles distance, with an hor∣rible din; but at the approach of day, they
 usually begin to retire: nothing is safe from <PB REF="189"/>

 depredations; they destroy fowls and do∣mestic animals, unless
 preserved with the ut∣most care, and often fasten upon the inhabit∣ants
 themselves, attack them in the face, and inflict very terrible wounds. In
 short, as some have already observed, the ancients seem to have taken
 their idea of harpies from these fierce and voracious creatures, as they both
 concur in many parts of the description, being equally deformed, greedy,
 uncleanly, and cruel.</P>
<P>An animal not so formidable, but still more mischievous than
 these, is the American Vam∣pyre. This is less than the former; but more
 deformed, and still more numerous. It is furnished with an horn like the
 rhinoceros bat; and its ears are extremely long. The other kinds generally
 resort to the forest, and the most deserted places; but these come
 into towns and cities, and, after sun-set, when they begin to fly, cover
 the streets like a canopy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i. p.
 58.</BIBL></NOTE>. They are the common pest both of men and animals; they
 effectually destroy the one, and often distress the other. 
 <Q REND="inline">"They are," says Ulloa, "the most expert
 blood-letters in the world. The inhabitants of those warm lati∣tudes being
 obliged, by the excessive heats, to <PB N="144" REF="193"/> leave open the
 doors and windows of the cham∣bers where they sleep, the vampyres enter, and
 if they find any part of the body exposed, they never fail to fasten upon
 it. There they continue to suck the blood; and it often happens that the
 person dies under the opera∣tion. They insinuate their tooth into a vein,
 with all the art of the most experienced surgeon, continuing to exhaust
 the body, until they are satiated. I have been assured," continues he,
 "by persons of the strictest veracity, that such an accident has
 happened to them; and that, had they not providentially awaked, their sleep
 would have been their passage into eter∣nity; having lost so large a
 quantity of blood as hardly to find strength to bind up the ori∣fice. The
 reason why the puncture is not felt is, besides the great precaution with
 which it is made, the gentle refreshing agitation of the bat's wings, which
 contribute to encrease sleep, and soften the pain."</Q></P>
<P>The purport of this account has been con∣firmed by various other
 travellers; who all agree that this bat is possessed of a faculty of
 drawing the blood from persons sleeping; and thus often destroying them
 before they awake. But still a very strong difficulty re∣mains 
 <PB N="145" REF="194"/> to be accounted for; the manner in which they inflict
 the wound. Ulloa, as has been seen, supposes that it is done by a
 single tooth; but this we know to be impossible, since the animal
 cannot infix one tooth without all the rest accompanying its motions; the
 teeth of the bat kind being pretty even, and the mouth but small. Mr. Buffon
 therefore supposes the wound to be inflicted by the tongue; which, however,
 appears to me too large to inflict an unpainful wound; and even less
 qualified for that purpose than the teeth. Nor can the tongue, as Mr. Buffon
 seems to suppose, serve for the purposes of suction, since for
 this it must be hollow, like a syringe, which it is not found to be. I
 should therefore suppose, that the animal is endowed with a strong
 power of suction; and that, without inflicting any wound whatsoever, by
 continuing to draw, it enlarges the pores of the skin in such a manner that
 the blood at length passes, and that more freely the longer the operation
 is continued; so that, at last, when the bat goes off, the blood con∣tinues
 to flow. In confirmation of this opinion we are told, that where beasts have
 a thick skin, this animal cannot injure them; whereas, in horses, mules,
 and asses, they are very liable <PB N="146" REF="195"/> to be thus
 destroyed. As to the rest, these animals are considered as one of the
 great pests of South America; and often prevent the peopling of many parts of
 that continent: having destroyed at Barja, and several other places, such
 cattle as were brought there by the missionaries, in order to form a
 settle∣ment.</P>

<PB N="147" REF="196"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of Amphibious Quadrupedes.</HEAD>
<P>THE gradations of Nature from one class of beings to another are
 made by imperceptible devi∣ations. As we saw in the foregoing chapters
 qua∣drupedes almost degraded into the insect tribe, or mounted among the
 inhabitants of the air, we are at present to observe their approach to
 fishes, to trace the degrees by which they become more unlike terrestrial
 animals, till the similitude of the fish prevails over that of the
 quadrupede.</P>
<P>As in opposite armies the two bodies are di∣stinct and
 separated from each other, while yet between them are various troops that
 plunder on both sides and are friends to neither, so be∣tween terrestrial
 and aquatic animals there are tribes that can scarce be referred to any rank,
 but lead an amphibious life between them. Sometimes in water, sometimes on
 land, they seem fitted for each element, and yet completely adapted to
 neither. Wanting the agility of quadrupedes upon land, and the perseverance
 of fishes in the deep, the variety of their powers only seems to diminish
 their force; and, though possessed of two different methods of living, 
 <PB N="148" REF="197"/> they are more inconveniently provided than such as
 have but one.</P>
<P>All quadrupedes of this kind, though co∣vered with hair in the
 usual manner, are fur∣nished with membranes between the toes, which
 assist their motion in the water. Their paws are broad and their legs
 short, by which they are more completely fitted for swimming, for taking
 short strokes at a time they make them oftner and with greater rapidity.
 Some, how∣ever, of these animals are more adapted to live in the water than
 others; but, as their power encreases to live in the deep, their unfitness
 for living upon land encreases in the same propor∣tion. Some, like the
 otter, resemble quadrupedes in every thing except in being in some
 measure web-footed; others depart still further, in being, like the beaver,
 not only web-footed, but hav∣ing the tail covered with scales, like those
 of a fish. Others depart yet farther, as the seal and the morse, by
 having the hind feet stuck to the body like fins; and others, as the
 lamentin, almost entirely resemble fishes, by having no hind feet
 whatsoever. Such are the gradations of the amphibious tribe. They all,
 however, get their living in the water, either by habit or conformation; they
 all continue a long time under water; they all consider that element as 
 <PB N="149" REF="198"/> their proper abode; whenever prest by danger, they fly
 to the water for security; and, when upon land, appear watchful, timorous,
 and un∣wieldy.</P>
<P>In the first step of the progression from land to amphibious
 animals, we find the Otter, re∣sembling those of the terrestrial kind in
 shape, hair, and internal conformation; resembling the aquatic tribes in
 its manner of living, and in having membranes between the toes to assist
 it in swimming. From this peculiar make of its feet, which are very short,
 it swims even faster than it runs, and can overtake fishes in their own
 element. The colour of this animal is brown; and it is somewhat of the
 shape of an overgrown weasel, being long, slender, and soft skinned.
 However, if we examine its figure in detail, we shall find it unlike any
 other animal hitherto described, and of such a shape as words can but
 weakly convey. Its usual length is about two feet long, from the tip of the
 nose to the in∣sertion of the tail; the head and nose are broad and flat;
 the mouth bears some similitude to that of a fish; the neck is short,
 and equal in thickness to the head; the body long; the tail broad at the
 insertion, but tapering off to a point at the end; the eyes are very small,
 and placed nearer the nose than usual in quadru∣pedes. 
 <PB N="150" REF="199"/> The legs are very short, but remarkably strong,
 broad, and muscular. The joints are articulated so loosely, that the
 animal is capable of turning them quite back, and bringing them on a line with
 the body, so as to perform the office of fins. Each foot is furnished with
 five toes, connected by strong broad webs like those of water fowl. Thus
 Nature, in every part, has had attention to the life of an animal whose food
 is fish, and whose haunts must necessarily be about water.</P>
<P>This voracious animal is never found but at the sides of lakes and
 rivers, but particularly the former, for it is seldom fond of fishing in a
 running stream, for the current of the water having more power upon it than
 the fishes it pursues, if it hunts against the stream it swims too
 slow; and if with the stream, it overshoots its prey. However, when in
 rivers, it is always observed to swim against the stream, and to meet
 the fishes it preys upon rather than to pursue them. In lakes it destroys
 much more than it de∣vours, and is often seen to spoil a pond in the
 space of a few nights. But the damage they do by destroying fish is not
 so great as their tearing in pieces the nets of the fishers, which they
 infal∣libly do whenever they happen to be entangled. The instant they find
 themselves caught, they <PB REF="200"/>

 work with their teeth, and in a few mi∣nutes destroy nets of a very
 considerable value.</P>
<P>The otter has two different methods of fishing; the one by
 catching its prey from the bottom upward, the other by pursuing it into
 some little creek and seizing it there. In the former case, as this
 animal has longer lungs than most other quadrupedes, upon taking in a
 quantity of air, it can remain for some minutes at the bottom; and whatever
 fish passes over at that time is certainly taken; for, as the eyes of
 fish are placed so as not to see under them, the otter attacks them off
 their guard from be∣low; and, seizing them at once by the belly, drags them
 on shore, where it often leaves them untouched, to continue the pursuit for
 hours together. The other method is chiefly practised in lakes and ponds,
 where there is no current; the fish thus taken are rather of the smaller
 kind, for the great ones will never be driven out of deep water.</P>
<P>In this manner the otter usually lives during the summer, being
 furnished with a supply much greater than its consumption; killing for
 its amusement, and infecting the edges of the lake with quantities of dead
 fish, which it leaves there as trophies rather of its victory than its
 necessities. But in winter, when the lakes are <PB N="152" REF="204"/>
 frozen over, and the rivers pour with a rapid torrent, the otter is often
 greatly distressed for provisions; and is then obliged to live upon
 grass, weeds, and even the bark of trees. It then comes upon land, and, grown
 courageous from necessity, feeds upon terrestrial animals, rats,
 insects, and even sheep themselves. Na∣ture, however, has given it the
 power of con∣tinuing a long time without food; and, although during that
 season it is not rendered quite tor∣pid, like the marmout or the
 dormouse, yet it keeps much more within its retreat, which is usually the
 hollow of a bank worn under by the water. There it often forms a kind of
 gal∣lery, running for several yards along the edge of the water; so that
 when attacked at one end, it flies to the other, and often evades the fowler by
 plunging into the water at forty or fifty paces distance, while he expects to
 find it just before him.</P>
<P>We learn from Mr. Buffon that this animal, in France, couples in
 winter and brings forth in the beginning of spring. But it is certainly
 different with us, for its young are never found till the latter end of
 summer; and I have fre∣quently, when a boy, discovered their retreats, and
 pursued them at that season. I am, there∣fore, more inclined to follow
 the account given <PB N="153" REF="205"/> us of this animal by Mr. Lots, of the
 Academy of Stockholm, who assures us that it couples about the middle of
 summer, and brings forth, at the end of nine weeks, generally three or four
 at a time. This, as well as the generality of his other remarks on this
 subject, agrees so ex∣actly with what I remember concerning it, that I will
 beg leave to take him for my guide, as∣suring the reader that, however
 extraordinary the account may seem, I know it to be certainly true.</P>
<P>In the rivers and the lakes frequented by the otter, the bottom is
 generally stony and uneven, with many trunks of trees, and long roots
 stretching underneath the water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Journal
 Etranger, Juin. 1755, p. 14.</BIBL></NOTE>. The shore also is hollow and
 scooped inward by the waves. These are the places the otter chiefly
 chuses for its retreat; and there is scarce a stone which does not bear
 the mark of its residence, as upon them its excrements are always made. It is
 chiefly by this mark that its lurking places are known, as well as by the
 quantity of dead fish that are found lying here and there upon the banks of
 the water. To take the old ones alive is no easy task, as they are
 extremely strong, and there are few dogs that will dare to encounter them.
 They bite with great fierce∣ness, <PB N="154" REF="206"/> and never let go
 their hold when they have once fastened. The best way, therefore, is to
 shoot them at once, as they never will be thoroughly tamed; and, if kept for
 the purposes of fishing, are always apt to take the first opportunity of
 escaping. But the young ones may be more easily taken, and con∣verted to
 very useful purposes. The otter brings forth its young generally under the
 hol∣low banks, upon a bed of rushes, flags, or such weeds as the place
 affords it in greatest quan∣tities. I see in the British Zoology a
 description of its habitation, where that naturalist observes, 
 <Q REND="inline">"that it burrows under ground, on the banks of
 some river or lake, and always makes the entrance of its hole under water,
 then works up to the surface of the earth, and there makes a minute orifice
 for the admission of air; and this little air-hole is often found in the
 middle of some thicket."</Q> In some places this may be true, but I have
 never observed any such con∣trivance; the retreat, indeed, was always at
 the edge of the water, but it was only sheltered by the impending bank, and
 the otter itself seemed to have but a small share in its formation.
 But, be this as it may, the young ones are always found at the edge of the
 water; and, if under the protection of the dam, she teaches 
 <PB N="155" REF="207"/> them instantly to plunge, like herself, into the
 deep, and escape among the rushes or weeds that fringe the stream. At
 such times, there∣fore, it is very difficult to take them; for, though never
 so young they swim with great rapidity, and in such a manner that no part
 of them is seen above water, except the tip of the nose. It is only when
 the dam is absent that they can be taken; and in some places there are dogs
 purposely trained for discovering their retreats. Whenever the dog comes to
 the place, he soon, by his barking, shews that the otter is there; which,
 if there be an old one, instantly plunges into the water, and the young all
 follow. But if the old one be absent, they continue terrified, and will not
 venture forth but under her guidance and protection. In this manner they are
 secured and taken home alive, where they are carefully fed with small
 fish and water. In proportion, however, as they gather strength, they have
 milk mixed among their food, the quantity of their fish provision is
 retrenched, and that of vegetables is encreased, until at length they are fed
 wholly upon bread, which perfectly agrees with their constitution. The manner
 of training them up to hunt for fish requires not only assiduity but
 patience; however, their activity and use, when <PB N="156" REF="208"/>
 taught, greatly repays the trouble of teaching; and, perhaps, no other animal
 is more bene∣ficial to its master. The usual way is, first to learn them
 to fetch as dogs are instructed; but, as they have not the same docility,
 so it requires more art and experience to teach them. It is usually
 performed by accustoming them to take a truss stuffed with wool, of the
 shape of a fish, and made of leather, in their mouths, and to drop it at
 the word of command; to run after it when thrown forward, and to bring it to
 their master. From this they proceed to real fish, which are thrown dead
 into the water, and which they are taught to fetch from thence. From the dead
 they proceed to the live, until at last the animal is perfectly instructed
 in the whole art of fishing. An otter thus taught is a very valuable animal,
 and will catch fish enough to sustain not only itself but a whole
 family. I have seen one of these go to a gentleman's pond at the word of
 command, drive up the fish into a corner, and, seizing up the largest of
 the whole, bringing it off, in its mouth, to its master.</P>
<P>Otters are to be met with in most parts of the world, and rather
 differ in size and colour from each other, than in habitudes or
 confor∣mation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ray.</BIBL></NOTE>. In North
 America and Carolina <PB N="157" REF="210"/> they are usually found white,
 inclining to yellow. The Brasilian otter is much larger than ours, with a
 roundish head, almost like a cat. The tail is shorter, being but five
 inches long; and the hair is soft, short, and black, except on the head,
 where it is of a dark brown, with a yel∣lowish spot under the throat.</P>

 <PB N="158" REF="213"/> of its labours, which are still to be seen in the
 remote parts of America, we learn how far instinct can be aided by imitation.
 We from thence perceive to what a degree animals, with∣out language or
 reason, can concur for their mutual advantage, and attain by numbers those
 advantages which each, in a state of solitude, seems unfitted to
 possess.</P>
<P>If we examine the beaver merely as an in∣dividual, and unconnected
 with others of its kind, we shall find many other quadrupedes to exceed it in
 cunning, and almost all in the powers of annoyance and defence. The beaver,
 when taken from its fellows, and kept in a state of solitude or domestic
 tameness, appears to be a mild gentle creature, familiar enough, but
 somewhat dull, and even melancholly; without any violent passions or
 vehement appetites, moving but seldom, making no efforts to attain any good,
 except in gnawing the wall of its prison, in order to regain its freedom; yet
 this, however, without anger or precipitation, but calm and indifferent to all
 about, without at∣tachment or antipathies, neither seeking to of∣fend nor
 desiring to please. It appears inferior to the dog in those qualities
 which render ani∣mals of service to man; it seems made neither to serve,
 to command, or to have connections <PB N="159" REF="214"/> with any other set
 of beings, and is only adapted for living among its kind. Its talents are
 en∣tirely repressed in solitude, and are only brought out by society.
 When alone, it has but little industry, few tricks, and without cunning
 suf∣ficient to guard it against the most obvious and bungling snares
 laid for it by the hunter. Far from attacking any other animal, it is scarce
 possessed of the arts of defence. Preferring flight to combat, like all
 wild animals, it only resists when driven to an extremity, and fights only
 then when its speed can no longer avail.</P>
<P>But this animal is rather more remarkable for the singularity of
 its conformation than any intellectual superiorities it may be supposed,
 in a state of solitude, to possess. The beaver is the only creature
 among quadrupedes that has a flat broad tail, covered with scales, which
 serves as a rudder to direct its motions in the water. Is is the sole
 quadrupede that has mem∣branes between the toes on the hind feet only, and none
 on the fore feet, which supply the place of hands, as in the squirrel. In
 short, it is the only animal that in its fore parts entirely resembles a
 quadrupede, and in its hinder parts seems to approach the nature of fishes,
 by hav∣ing a scaly tail. In other respects, it is about two feet long and
 near one foot high; it is <PB N="160" REF="215"/> somewhat shaped like a
 rat, except the tail, which, as has been observed, is flat and scaly,
 somewhat resembling a neat's tongue at the point. Its colour is of a light
 brown; the hair of two sorts; the one longer and coarser; the other,
 soft, fine, short, and silky. The teeth are like those of a rat or a
 squirrel, but longer and stronger, and admirably adapted to cutting timber
 or stripping bark, to which purposes they are constantly applied. One
 singularity more may be mentioned in its conformation; which is, that, like
 birds, it has but one and the same vent for the emission of its
 excrements and its urine; a strange peculiarity, but which, anatomists
 leave us no room to doubt of.</P>
<P>The beavers begin to assemble about the months of June and
 July, to form a society that is to continue for the greatest part of the
 year. They arrive in numbers from every side, and generally form a company of
 above two hundred. The place of meeting is commonly the place where they six
 their abode, and this is always by the side of some lake or river. If it be
 a lake in which the waters are always upon a level, they dispense with
 building a dam; but if it be a running stream, which is subject to floods
 and falls, they then set about building a dam, or pier, that crosses the
 river, so that it <PB N="161" REF="216"/> forms a dead water in that part
 which lies above and below. This dam, or pier, is often four∣score or an
 hundred feet long, and ten or twelve feet thick at the base. If we compare
 the great∣ness of the work with the powers of the architect, it will appear
 enormous; but the solidity with which it is built is still more
 astonishing than its size. The part of the river over which this dam is
 usually built, is where it is most shallow, and where some great tree
 is found growing by the side of the stream. This they pitch upon as proper
 for making the principal part in their building; and, although it is often
 thicker than a man's body, they instantly set about cutting it down. For
 this operation they have no other instrument but their teeth, which soon
 lay it level, and that also on the side they wish it to fall, which is
 always across the stream. They then fall about cutting off the top
 branches, to make it lie close and even, and serve as the principal beam of
 their fabric<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Spectacle de la
 Nature.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>This dike, or causey, is sometimes ten, and sometimes twelve
 feet thick at the foundation. It descends in a declivity or slope, on that
 side next the water, which gravitates upon the work in proportion to the
 height, and presses it with a prodigious force towards the earth. The 
 <PB N="162" REF="217"/> opposite side is erected perpendicular, like our
 walls; and that declivity, which, at the bottom, or basis, is about twelve
 feet broad, diminishes towards the top, where it is no more than two feet
 broad, or thereabouts. The materials whereof this mole consists, are wood
 and clay. The beavers cut, with suprizing ease, large pieces of wood,
 some as thick as one's arm or one's thigh, and about four, five or six feet
 in length, or sometimes more, according as the slope ascends. They drive
 one end of these stakes into the ground, at a small distance one from
 the other, intermingling a few with them that are smaller and more pliant. As
 the water, however, would find a passage through the in∣tervals or spaces
 between them, and leave the reservoir dry, they have recourse to a clay,
 which they know where to find, and with which they stop up all the cavities
 both within and without, so that the water is duly confined. They continue to
 raise the dike in proportion to the elevation of the water and the plenty
 which they have of it. They are conscious like∣wise that the conveyance of
 their materials by land would not be so easily accomplished as by water;
 and therefore they take the advantage of its increase, and swim with their
 mortar on their tails, and their stakes between their teeth, to the places
 where there is most occasion for <PB N="163" REF="218"/> them. If their
 works are, either by the force of the water or the feet of the huntsmen, who
 run over them, in the least damnified, the breach is instantly made up;
 every nook and corner of the habitation is reviewed, and, with the ut∣most
 diligence and application, perfectly re∣paired. But when they find the
 huntsmen visit them too often, they work only in the night-time, or else
 abandon their works entirely, and seek out for some safer
 situation.</P>
<P>The dike, or mole, being thus completed, their next care is to
 erect their several apart∣ments, which are either round or oval, and di∣vided
 into three stories, one raised above the other: the first below the level
 of the causey, which is for the most part full of water; the other two
 above it. This little fabrick is built in a very firm and substantial
 manner, on the edge of their reservoir, and always in such di∣visions or
 apartments as above-mentioned; that in case of the water's increase, they
 may move up a story higher, and be no ways incommoded. If they find any
 little island contiguous to their reservoir, they fix their mansion
 there, which is then more solid, and not so frequently ex∣posed to the
 overflowing of the water, in which they are not able to continue for any length
 of time. In case they cannot pitch upon so com∣modious 
 <PB N="164" REF="219"/> a situation, they drive piles into the earth, in order
 to fence and fortify their habi∣tation against the wind as well as the water.
 They make two apertures, at the bottom, to the stream; one is a passage
 to their bagnio, which they always keep neat and clean; the other leads to that
 part of the building where every thing is conveyed, that will either soil or
 damage their upper apartments. They have a third opening or door-way, much
 higher, con∣trived for the prevention of their being shut up and confined,
 when the frost and snow has closed the apertures of the lower floors.
 Some∣times they build their houses altogether upon dry land; but then they
 sink trenches five or six feet deep, in order to descend into the water
 when they see convenient. They make use of the same materials; and are
 equally industrious in the erection of their lodges, as their dikes. Their
 walls are perpendicular, and about two feet thick. As their teeth are more
 service∣able than saws, they cut off all the wood that projects beyond the
 wall. After this, when they have mixed up some clay and dry grass together,
 they work it into a kind of mortar, with which, by the help of their tails,
 they plaister all their works, both within and with∣out.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="220"/>The inside is vaulted, and is large enough
 for the reception of eight or ten beavers. In case it rises in an oval
 figure, it is for the gene∣rality above twelve feet long, and eight or ten feet
 broad. If the number of inhabitants in∣crease to fifteen, twenty, or thirty,
 the edifice is enlarged in proportion. I have been cre∣dibly informed, that
 four hundred beavers have been discovered to reside in one large
 mansion-house, divided into a vast number of apart∣ments, that had a free
 communication one with another.</P>
<P>All these works, more especially in the northern parts, are
 finished in August, or Sep∣tember at farthest; at which time they begin
 to lay in their stores. During the summer, they are perfect epicures; and
 regale themselves every day on the choicest fruits and plants the country
 affords. Their provisions, indeed, in the winter season, principally
 consist of the wood of the birch, the plane, and some few other trees,
 which they steep in water, from time to time, in such quantities as are
 proportioned to the number of inhabitants. They cut down branches from three to
 ten feet in length. Those of the largest dimensions are conveyed to their
 magazines by a whole body of beavers; but the smallest by one only: each of
 them, <PB N="166" REF="221"/> however, takes a different way, and has his proper
 walk assigned him, in order that no one labourer should interrupt another
 in the pro∣secution of his work. Their wood-yards are larger or smaller, in
 proportion to the number in family: and, according to the observation of
 some curious naturalists, the usual stock of timber, for the
 accommodation of ten beavers, consists of about thirty feet in a square
 surface, and ten in depth. These logs are not thrown up in one continual
 pile, but laid one across the other, with intervals, or small spaces
 be∣tween them, in order to take out, with the greater facility, but just
 such a quantity as they shall want for their immediate consumption, and
 those parcels only, which lie at the bottom in the water, and have been duly
 steeped. This timber is cut again into small particles, and conveyed to one
 of their largest lodges, where the whole family meet, to consume their
 respective dividends, which are made impar∣tially, in even and equal
 portions. Sometimes they traverse the woods, and regale their young with a
 more novel and elegant entertainment.</P>
<P>Such as are used to hunt these animals, know perfectly well,
 that green wood is much more acceptable to them, than that which is old and
 dry; for which reason they plant a considerable <PB N="167" REF="222"/>
 quantity of it round their lodgments; and as they come out to partake of it,
 they either catch them in snares, or take them by surprize. In the winter,
 when the frosts are very severe, they sometimes break a large hole in the
 ice; and when the beavers resort thither for the be∣nefit of a little fresh
 air, they either kill them with their hatchets, or cover the opening with a
 large substantial net. After this, they un∣dermine and subvert the whole
 fabrick: where∣upon the beavers, in hopes to make their escape in their
 usual way, fly with the utmost preci∣pitation to the water; and plunging
 into the aperture, fall directly into the net, and are inevitably taken.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE SEAL.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY step we proceed in the description of amphibious
 quadrupedes, we make nearer advances to the tribe of fishes. We first
 ob∣served the otter with its feet webbed, and formed for an aquatic life; we
 next saw the beaver with the hinder parts covered with scales, resembling
 those of fishes; and we now come to a class of animals in which the
 shape and habitude of fishes still more apparently prevails, and whose
 in∣ternal conformation attaches them very closely <PB N="168" REF="223"/> to
 the water. The Seal, in general, resembles a quadrupede in some respects,
 and a fish in others. The head is round, like that of a man; the nose
 broad, like that of the otter; the teeth like those of a dog; the eyes large
 and spark∣ling; no external ears, but holes that serve for that purpose;
 the neck is well proportioned, and of a moderate length; but the body
 thickest where the neck is joined to it. From thence the animal tapers down
 to the tail, growing all the way smaller, like a fish. The whole body is
 covered with a thick bristly shining hair, which looks as if it were
 entirely rubbed over with oil; and thus far the quadrupede prevails over the
 aquatic. But it is in the feet that this ani∣mal greatly differs from all the
 rest of the qua∣drupede kind; for, though furnished with the same number
 of bones with other quadrupedes, yet they are so stuck on the body, and
 so covered with a membrane, that they more resemble fins than feet; and
 might be taken for such, did not the claws with which they are pointed shew
 their proper analogy. In the fore feet, or rather hands, all the arm and the
 cubit, are hid under the skin, and nothing appears but the hand from the
 wrist downwards; so that if we imagine a child with its arms swathed
 down, and nothing appearing but its hands at each side of the body, 
 <PB N="169" REF="224"/> towards the breast, we may have some idea of the
 formation of this animal in that part. These hands are covered in a thick
 skin, which serves, like a fin, for swimming; and are distinguished
 by five claws, which are long, black, and pierc∣ing. As to the hind feet, they
 are stretched out on each side of the short tail, covered with a hairy
 skin like the former, and both together almost joining at the tail; the
 whole looks like the broad flat tail of a fish; and, were it not for five
 claws which appear, might be considered as such. The dimensions of this
 animal are va∣rious, being found from four feet long to nine. They differ
 also in their colours; some being black, others spotted, some white,
 and many more yellow. It would, therefore, be almost endless to mention the
 varieties of this animal. Buffon describes three; and Krantz mentions five,
 all different from those described by the other. I might, were I fond of
 such honours, claim the merit of being a first describer myself; but,
 in fact, the varieties in this animal are so many, that, were they all
 described, the cata∣logue would be as extensive as it would be use∣less
 and unentertaining. It is sufficient to ob∣serve, that they agree in the
 general external characters already mentioned, and internally in two or three
 more, which are so remarkable as to deserve peculiar attention.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="225"/>It has been often remarked that all animals
 are sagacious in proportion to the size of their brain. It has, in
 support of this opinion, been alledged that man, with respect to his bulk,
 has of all others the largest. In pursuance of this assumption, some
 erroneous speculations have been formed. But, were the size of the brain to
 determine the quantity of the under∣standing, the seal would of all other
 animals be the most sagacious; for it has, in proportion, the largest
 brain of any, even man himself not excepted. However, this animal is
 possessed of but very few advantages over other quadru∣pedes; and the
 size of its brain furnishes it with few powers that contribute to its
 wisdom or its preservation.</P>
<P>This animal differs also in the formation of its tongue from all
 other quadrupedes. It is forked or slit at the end like that of serpents;
 but for what purposes it is thus singularly con∣trived we are at a loss
 to know. We are much better informed with respect to a third singu∣larity
 in its conformation, which is, that the <HI>foramen ovale</HI> in the heart is
 open. Those who are in the least acquainted with anatomy know, that the
 veins uniting bring their blood to the heart, which sends it into the lungs,
 and from thence it returns to the heart again to be di∣stributed 
 <PB N="171" REF="226"/> through the whole body. Animals, however, before they
 are born, make no use of their lungs; and therefore their blood, without
 entering their lungs, takes a shorter passage through the very partition
 of the heart, from one of its chambers to the other, thus passing from the
 veins directly into those vessels that drive it through the whole frame.
 But the moment the animal is brought forth, the pas∣sage through the
 partition, which passage is called the <HI>foramen ovale,</HI> closes up
 and continues closed for ever; for the blood then takes its longest
 course through the lungs to return to the other chamber of the heart again.
 Now the seal's heart resembles that of an infant in the womb, for the
 <HI>foramen ovale</HI> never closes; and, although the blood of this animal
 com∣monly circulates through the lungs, yet it can circulate without their
 assistance, as was ob∣served above, by a shorter way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have followed the usual observations of naturalists
 with respect to the foramen ovale in this animal: I have many reasons,
 however, to incline me to think that the foramen is not entirely open. But this
 is not the place for a critical enquiry of this kind.</NOTE>. From hence,
 therefore, we see the manner in which this ani∣mal is adapted for continuing
 under water; for, being under no immediate necessity of breath∣ing, 
 <PB N="172" REF="227"/> the vital motions are still carried on while it
 continues at the bottom; so that it can pursue its prey in that element,
 and yet enjoy all the delights and advantages of ours.</P>
<P>The water is the seal's usual habitation, and whatever fish
 it can catch its food. Though not equal in instinct and cunning to some
 ter∣restrial animals, it is greatly superior to the mute tenants of that
 element in which it chiefly re∣sides. Although it can continue for several
 minutes under water, yet it is not able, like fishes, to remain there for any
 length of time; and a seal may be drowned like any other ter∣restrial
 animal. Thus it seems superior in some respects to the inhabitants of
 both elements, and inferior in many more. Although furnished with legs, it is
 in some measure deprived of all the advantages of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. They are shut up within its body,
 while nothing appear but the extremities of them, and these furnished with
 very little motion, but to serve them as fins in the water. The hind feet,
 indeed, being turned backwards, are entirely useless upon land; so that
 when the animal is obliged to move, it drags itself forward like a reptile,
 and with an effort more painful. For this purpose it is obliged to use its
 fore feet, which, though very <PB N="173" REF="228"/> short, serve to give
 it such a degree of swiftness that a man cannot readily overtake it; and
 it runs towards the sea. As it is thus aukwardly formed for going upon land,
 it is seldom found at any distance from the sea-shore, but continues to
 bask upon the rocks; and when disturbed always plunges down at once to the
 bottom.</P>
<P>The seal is a social animal, and wherever it frequents numbers
 are generally seen together. They are found in every climate, but in the
 north and icy seas they are particularly nume∣rous. It is on those
 shores, which are less inha∣bited than ours, and where the fish resort
 in greater abundance, that they are seen by thou∣sands, like flocks of
 sheep, basking on the rocks, and suckling their young. There they keep
 watch like other gregarious animals; and, if an enemy appear, instantly
 plunge altogether into the water. In fine weather they more usually employ
 their time in fishing; and ge∣nerally come on shore in tempests and
 storms. The seal seems the only animal that takes de∣light in these
 tremendous conflicts of nature. In the midst of thunders and torrents, when
 every other creature takes refuge from the fury of the elements, the seals
 are seen by thousands sporting along the shore, and delighted with the
 universal disorder. This, however, may arise <PB N="174" REF="229"/> from
 the sea being at that time too turbulent for them to reside in; and they
 may then par∣ticularly come upon land when unable to resist the shock of
 their more usual element.</P>
<P>As seals are gregarious, so are they also ani∣mals of
 passage, and perhaps the only quadru∣pedes that migrate from one part of
 the world to another. The generality of quadrupedes are contented with their
 native plains and forests, and seldom stray except when necessity or
 fear impels them. But seals change their habita∣tion; and are seen in
 vast multitudes directing their course from one continent to another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz, vol. i, p. 129.</BIBL></NOTE>. On the northern
 coasts of Greenland they are seen to retire in July, and to return again in
 September. This time it is supposed they go in pursuit of food. But they
 make a second departure in March to cast their young, and return in the
 beginning of June, young and all, in a great body together, observing in
 their route a certain fixed time and track, like birds of passage. When
 they go upon this expedi∣tion, they are seen in great droves, for many days
 together, making towards the north, tak∣ing that part of the sea most free
 from ice, and going still forward into those seas where man cannot
 follow. In what manner they return, <PB N="175" REF="230"/> or by what
 passages, is utterly unknown; it is only observed, that when they leave
 the coasts to go upon this expedition they are all ex∣tremely fat, but on
 their return they come home excessively lean.</P>
<P>The females in our climate bring forth in winter, and rear their
 young upon some sand-bank, rock, or desolate island, at some
 distance from the con∣tinent. When they suckle their young they sit up on
 their hinder legs, while these, which are at first white with woolly hair,
 cling to the tates, of which there are four in number, near the navel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
 <Q>Coeunt in Littore resupinata femina. 
 <BIBL>LIN. SYST.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. In this manner the young
 continue in the place where they are brought forth, for twelve or fifteen days;
 after which the dam brings them down to the water, and accustoms them to
 swim and get their food by their own industry. As each litter never exceeds
 above three or four, so the animal's cares are not much divided, and the
 education of her little ones is soon compleated. In fact, the young are
 particularly docile; they understand the mother's voice among the numerous
 bleatings of the rest of the old ones; they mutually assist each other
 in danger, and are perfectly obedient to her call. Thus early accustomed to
 subjection, they continue to live in society, <PB N="176" REF="231"/> hunt
 and herd together, and have a variety of tones by which they encourage to
 pursue or warn each other of danger. Some compare their voices to the
 bleating of a flock of sheep, interrupted now and then by the barking of
 angry dogs, and sometimes the shriller notes of a cat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Syst.</BIBL></NOTE>. All along the shore, each
 has its own peculiar rock, of which it takes possession, and where it
 sleeps when fatigued with fishing, uninterrupted by any of the rest. The
 only season when their social spirit seems to forsake them, is that
 when they feel the influences of natural desire. They then fight most
 despe∣rately; and the male that is victorious, keeps all the females to
 himself. Their combats on these occasions are managed with great
 obsti∣nacy, and yet great justice: two are never seen to fall upon one
 together; but each has its an∣tagonist, and all fight an equal battle, till
 one alone becomes victorious.</P>
<P>We are not certainly informed how long the females continue
 pregnant; but if we may judge from the time which intervenes between their
 departure from the Greenland coasts and their return, they cannot go above
 seven or eight months at the farthest. How long this animal lives is also
 unknown: a gentleman whom I <PB N="177" REF="232"/> knew in Ireland, kept two of
 them, which he had taken very young, in his house for ten years; and they
 appeared to have the marks of age at the time I saw them, for they were grown
 grey about the muzzle; and it is very probable they did not live many years
 longer. In their natural state the old ones are seen very fat and torpid,
 separated from the rest, and, as it should seem, incapable of
 procreation.</P>
<P>As their chief food is fish, so they are very expert at
 pursuing and catching it. In those places where the herrings are seen in
 shoals, the seals frequent and destroy them by thou∣sands. When the
 herring retires, the seal is then obliged to hunt after fish that are
 stronger, and more capable of evading the pursuit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology, vol. i. p. 75.</BIBL></NOTE>: how∣ever,
 they are very swift in deep waters, dive with great rapidity, and, while the
 spectator eyes the spot at which they disappear, they are seen to
 emerge at above an hundred yards distance. The weaker fishes, therefore,
 have no other means to escape their tyranny, but by darting into the
 shallows. The seal has been seen to pursue a mullet, which is a swift
 swim∣mer, and to turn it to and fro, in deep water, as an hound does an hare
 on land. The mullet has been seen trying every art of evasion; and 
 <PB N="178" REF="233"/> at last swimming into shallow water, in hopes of
 escaping. There, however, the seal followed; so that the little animal
 had no other way left to escape, but to throw itself on one side, by
 which means it darted into shoaler water than it could have swam in with
 the belly undermost; and thus at last it got free.</P>
<P>As they are thus the tyrants of the element in which they chiefly
 reside, so they are not very fearful even upon land, except on those
 shores which are thickly inhabited, and from whence they have been frequently
 pursued. Along the desert coasts where they are seldom in∣terrupted by
 man, they seem to be very bold and courageous; if attacked with stones,
 like dogs, they bite such as are thrown against them; if encountered more
 closely, they make a desperate resistance, and, while they have any
 life, attempt to annoy their enemy. Some have been known, even while they were
 skinning, to turn round and seize their butchers; but they are generally
 dispatched by a stunning blow on the nose. They usually sleep
 soundly where not frequently disturbed; and that is the time, when the
 hunters surprize them. The Europeans who go into the Greenland seas upon
 the whale-fishery, surround them with nets, and knock them on the head; but
 the <PB N="179" REF="234"/> Greenlanders, wild are unprovided with so
 ex∣pensive an apparatus, destroy them in a differ∣ent manner. One of
 these little men paddles away in his boat, and when he sees a seal
 asleep on the side of a rock, darts his lance, and that with such
 unerring aim, that it never fails to bury its point in the animal's side. The
 seal, feeling itself wounded, instantly plunges from the top of the rock,
 lance and all, into the sea, and dives to the bottom; but the lance has a
 bladder tied to one end, which keeps buoyant, and resists the animal's
 descent; so that every time the seal rises to the top of the water, the
 Greenlander strikes it with his oar, until he at last dispatches it. But,
 in our climate, the seals are much more wary, and seldom suffer the
 hunter to come near them. They are often seen upon the rocks of the Cornish
 coast, bask∣ing in the sun, or upon the inaccessible cliffs, left dry
 by the tide. There they continue, extremely watchful, and never sleep long
 with∣out moving; seldom longer than a minute; for then they raise their
 heads, and if they see no danger, they lie down again, raising and
 re∣clining their heads alternately, at intervals of about a minute each. The
 only method, there∣fore, that can be taken, is to shoot them: if they chance
 to escape, they hasten towards the <PB N="180" REF="235"/> deep, flinging
 stones and dirt behind them as they scramble along, and at the same time
 expressing their pain or their fears, by the most distressful cry; if
 they happen to be overtaken, they make a vigorous resistance with their
 feet and teeth, till they are killed.</P>
<P>The seal is taken for the sake of its skin, and for the oil
 its fat yields. The former sells for about four shillings; and, when
 dressed, is very useful in covering trunks, making waist-coats,
 shot-pouches, and several other conve∣niencies. The flesh of this animal
 formerly found place at the tables of the great. At a feast provided by
 Archbishop Nevell, for Ed∣ward the Fourth, there were twelve seals and
 porpoises provided, among other extraordinary rarities.</P>
<P>As a variety of this animal, we may mention the Sea Lion,
 described in Anson's Voyages. This is much larger than any of the former;
 being from eleven to eighteen feet long. It is so fat that, when the skin
 is taken off, the blub∣ber lies a foot thick all round the body. It seems to
 differ from the ordinary seal, not only in its size, but also in its
 food; for it is often seen to graze along the shore, and to feed upon the
 long grass that grows up along the edges of brooks. Its cry is very various,
 sometimes <PB N="181" REF="237"/> resembling the neighing of an horse, and
 some∣times the grunting of the hog. It may be re∣garded as the largest of
 the seal family.</P>

 generally seen to frequent the same places that seals are known to
 reside in; they have the same habitudes, the same ad∣vantages, and the
 same imperfections. There are, however, fewer varieties of the morse than
 the seal; and they are rarely found, except in the frozen regions near the
 pole. They were formerly more numerous than at present; and the savage

 is, that the Greenlanders, who once had plenty, are now obliged to toil more
 assiduously for subsistence; and as the quantity of their
 provisions decrease, for they live mostly upon seals, the numbers of
 that poor people are every day diminishing. As to the teeth, they are
 generally from two to three feet long; and the ivory is much more esteemed
 than that of the elephant, being whiter and harder. The fishers have been
 known formerly to kill three or four hundred at once; and along those
 shores where they chiefly frequented, their bones are still seen lying in
 prodigious quantities. In this manner a supply of provisions, which would
 have supported the Greenland nation for ages, has been, in a few years,
 sacrificed to those who did not use them, but who sought them for the
 purposes of avarice and luxury!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE MANATI.</HEAD>
<P>WE come, in the last place, to an animal that terminates the
 boundary between quadru∣pedes and fishes. Instead of a creature preying
 among the deeps, and retiring upon land for <PB N="183" REF="241"/> repose or
 refreshment, we have here an animal that never leaves the water, and is
 enabled to live only there. It cannot be called a quadru∣pede, as it has but
 two legs only; nor can it be called a fish, as it is covered with hair. In
 short, it forms the link that unites those two great tribes to each other;
 and may be indis∣criminately called the last of beasts, or the first of
 fishes.</P>
<P>We have seen the seal approaching nearly to the aquatic
 tribes, by having its hind legs thrown back on each side of the tail, and
 form∣ing something, that resembled the tail of a fish; but upon examining
 the skeleton of that ani∣mal, its title to the rank of a quadrupede was
 observed plainly to appear, having all the bones of the hinder legs and feet
 as complete as any other animal whatsoever.</P>
<P>But we are now come to a creature that not only wants the external
 appearance of hinder legs, but, when examined internally, will be found to want
 them altogether. The Manati is somewhat shaped in the head and the body
 like the seal; it has also the fore legs or hands pretty much in the same
 manner, short and webbed, but with four claws only: these also are
 shorter in proportion than in the former animal, and placed nearer the head;
 so that <PB N="184" REF="242"/> they can scarcely assist its motions
 upon land. But it is in the hinder parts that it chiefly differs from all
 others of the seal kind; for the tail is perfectly that of a fish, being
 spread out broad like a fan, and wanting even the vestiges of those bones
 which make the legs and feet in others of its kind. The largest of these
 are about twenty-six feet in length; the skin is blackish, very tough and
 hard; when cut, as black as ebony; and there are a few hairs scat∣tered, like
 bristles, of about an inch long. The eyes are very small, in proportion to
 the animal's head; and the ear-holes, for it has no external ears, are so
 narrow as scarce to admit a pin's head. The tongue is so short, that
 some have pretended it has none at all; and the teeth are composed only of
 two solid white bones, running the whole length of both jaws, and formed
 merely for chewing, and not tearing its vegetable food. The female has
 breasts placed forward, like those of a woman; and she brings forth but
 one at a time: this she holds with her paws to her bosom; there it
 sticks, and accompanies her wherever she goes.</P>
<P>This animal can scarcely be called amphi∣bious, as it never
 entirely leaves the water, only advancing the head out of the stream, to 
 <PB N="185" REF="243"/> reach the grass on the river sides. Its food is
 entirely upon vegetables; and, therefore, it is never found far in the open
 sea, but chiefly in the large rivers of South America; and often above two
 thousand miles from the ocean. It is also found in the seas near
 Kamskatka, and feeds upon the weeds that grow near the shore. There are
 likewise level greens at the bottom of some of the Indian bays, and there
 the manatees are harmlessly seen grazing among turtles and other
 crustaceous fishes, neither giving nor fearing any disturbance. These
 animals, when unmolested, keep together in large companies, and surround
 their young ones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acta
 Petripolitana.</BIBL></NOTE>. They bring forth most commonly in autumn; and
 it is supposed they go with young eighteen months, for the time of
 generation is in spring.</P>
<P>The manati has no voice nor cry, for the only noise it makes, is
 by fetching its breath. Its internal parts somewhat resemble those of an
 horse; its intestines being longer, in pro∣portion, than those of any
 other creature, the horse only excepted.</P>
<P>The fat of the manati, which lies under the skin, when exposed
 to the sun, has a fine smell and taste, and far exceeds the fat of any
 sea <PB N="186" REF="244"/> animal; it has this peculiar property, that the
 heat of the sun will not spoil it, nor make it grow rancid; its taste is
 like the oil of sweet almonds; and it will serve very well, in all cases,
 instead of butter: any quantity may be taken inwardly with safety, for it
 has no other effect than keeping the body open. The fat of the tail is of an
 harder consistence; and, when boiled, is more delicate than the former. The
 lean is like beef, but more red; and may be kept a long while, in the hottest
 days, without tainting. It takes up a long time in boiling; and, when done,
 eats like beef. The fat of the young one is like pork; the lean is like veal;
 and, upon the whole, it is very probable that this animal's flesh somewhat
 resembles that of turtle; since they are fed in the same element, and
 upon the very same food. The turtle is a delicacy well known among us: our
 luxuries are not as yet sufficiently heightened to in∣troduce the manati;
 which, if it could be brought over, might singly suffice for a whole
 corporation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of Animals of the Monkey Kind.</HEAD>
<P>QUADRUPEDES may be considered as a numerous groupe, terminated on
 every side by some that but in part deserve the name. On one quarter we
 see a tribe covered with quills, or furnished with wings, that lift them
 among the inhabitants of air; on another, we behold a diversity cloathed with
 scales and shells, to rank with insects; and still, on a third, we
 see them descending into the waters, to live among the mute tenants of that
 element. We now come to a numerous tribe, that, leaving the brute creation,
 seem to make approaches even to humanity; that bear an aukward resemblance
 of the human form, and discover some faint efforts at intellectual
 sagacity.</P>
<P>Animals of the monkey class are furnished with hands instead
 of paws; their ears, eyes, eye-lids, lips, and breasts, are like those of
 man∣kind; their internal conformation also bears some distant likeness;
 and the whole offers a picture that may well mortify the pride of such as
 make their persons alone the principal object of their admiration.</P>
<P>These approaches, however, are gradual; and <PB N="188" REF="246"/>
 some bear the marks of this our boasted form, more strongly than
 others.</P>
<P>In the Ape kind we see the whole external machine strongly
 impressed with the human like∣ness, and capable of the same exertions:
 these walk upright, want a tail, have fleshy posteriors, have calves to
 their legs, and feet nearly like ours.</P>
<P>In the Baboon kind we perceive a more distant approach to the
 human form; the quadrupede mixing in every part of the animal's figure: these
 generally go upon all fours; but some, when upright, are as tall as a man;
 they have short tails, long snouts, and are possessed of brutal
 fierceness.</P>
<P>The Monkey kind are removed a step fur∣ther: these are much
 less than the former, with tails as long, or longer than their bodies, and
 flattish faces.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Maki and Opassum kind, seem to lose all
 resemblance of the human figure, ex∣cept in having hands; their noses are
 length∣ened out, like those of quadrupedes, and every part of their bodies
 totally different from the human; however, as they grasp their food, or other
 objects, with one hand, which quadru∣pedes cannot do, this single
 similitude gives them an air of sagacity, to which they have scarce any
 other pretensions.</P>
<P>From this slight survey it may be easily seen 
 <PB N="189" REF="247"/> that one general description will not serve for
 animals so very different from each other: ne∣vertheless, it would be
 fatiguing to the last de∣gree, as their varieties are so numerous, and
 their differences so small, to go through a particular description of
 each. In this case it will be best to give an history of the foremost
 in each class; at the same time marking the distinctions in every
 species. By this we shall avoid a tedious repetition of similar
 characters, and consider the manners and the oddities of this phantastic
 tribe in general points of view; where we shall perceive how nearly they
 ap∣proach to the human figure, and how little they benefit by the
 approximation.</P>
<P>The foremost of the Ape kind is the Ourang Outang, or Wild Man of
 the Woods. This name seems to have been given to various ani∣mals, agreeing
 in one common character of walking upright, but coming from different
 countries, and of very different proportions and powers. The Troglodyte of
 Bontius, the Drill of Purchas, and the Pygmy of Tyson, have all received this
 general name; and have been ranked, by some naturalists, under one general
 description. If we read the accounts of many remote travellers, under this
 name we are presented with a formidable animal, from <PB N="190" REF="248"/>
 six to eight feet high; if we examine the books of such as have described
 it nearer home, we find it a pigmy not above three. In this di∣versity we
 must be content to blend their va∣rious descriptions into one general
 account; observing, at the same time, that we have no reason to doubt any
 of their relations, although we are puzzled which to follow.</P>
<P>The Ouran Outang, which, of all other ani∣mals, most nearly
 approaches to the human race, is seen of different sizes, from three to
 seven feet high. In general, however, its sta∣ture is less than that of a
 man; but its strength and agility much greater. Travellers who have seen
 various kinds of these animals in their native solitudes, give us
 surprizing relations of their force, their swiftness, their address,
 and their ferocity. Naturalists who have observed their form and manners at
 home, have been as much struck with their patient, pliant, imitative
 dispositions; with their appearance and con∣formation, so nearly human.
 Of the smallest sort of these animals we have had several, at
 different times, brought into this country, all nearly alike; but that
 observed by Dr. Tyson, is the best known, having been described with
 the greatest exactness.</P>
<P>The animal which was described by that <PB N="191" REF="249"/>
 learned physician, was brought from Angola in Africa, where it had been taken
 in the internal parts of the country, in company with a female of the same
 kind, that died by the way. The body was covered with hair, which was of a coal
 black colour, more resembling human hair than that of brutes. It bore a
 still stronger similitude in its different lengths; for in those places
 where it is longest on the human species, it was also longest in this;
 as on the head, the upper lip, the chin, and the pubes. The face was like that
 of a man, the forehead larger, and the head round. The upper and lower jaw were
 not so prominent as in monkies; but flat, like those of a man. The ears
 were like those of a man in most respects; and the teeth had more
 resemblance to the human, than those of any other creature. The bending of
 the arms and legs were just the same as in a man; and, in short, the
 animal, at first view, presented a figure entirely human.</P>
<P>In order to discover its differences, it was ne∣cessary to
 take a closer survey; and then the imperfections of its form began to
 appear. The first obvious difference was in the flatness of the nose; the
 next in the lowness of the forehead, and the wanting the prominence of the
 chin. The ears were proportionably too large; the <PB N="192" REF="250"/> eyes
 too close to each other; and the interval between the nose and mouth too
 great. The body and limbs differed, in the thighs be∣ing too short, and the
 arms too long; in the thumb being too little, and the palm of the hand too
 narrow. The feet also were rather more like hands than feet; and the animal,
 if we may judge from the figure, bent too much upon its haunches.</P>
<P>When this creature was examined anato∣mically, a surprizing
 similitude was seen to prevail in its internal conformation. It differed
 from man in the number of its ribs, having thirteen; whereas, in man, there are
 but twelve. The vertebrae of the neck also were shorter, the bones of the
 pelvis narrower, the orbits of the eyes were deeper, the kidnies were round∣er,
 the urinary and gall bladders were longer and smaller, and the ureters of a
 different figure. Such were the principal distinctions between the internal
 parts of this animal and those of man; in almost every thing else they
 were entirely and exactly the same, and dis∣covered an astonishing
 congruity. Indeed, many parts were so much alike in confor∣mation, that it
 might have excited wonder how they were productive of such few advantages.
 The tongue, and all the organs of the voice, <PB N="193" REF="251"/> were the
 same, and yet the animal was dumb; the brain was formed in the same manner
 with that of man, and yet the creature wanted rea∣son: an evident proof (as
 Mr. Buffon finely ob∣serves) that no disposition of matter will give
 mind; and that the body, how nicely soever formed, is formed in vain, when
 there is not infused a soul to direct its operations.</P>
<P>Having thus taken a comparative view of this creature with man, what
 follows may be necessary to compleat the general description. This animal
 was very hairy all behind, from the head downwards; and the hair so thick,
 that it covered the skin almost from being seen: but in all parts before,
 the hair was much thinner, the skin every where appeared; and in some
 places it was almost bare. When it went on all fours, as it was sometimes
 seen to do, it appeared all hairy; when it went erect, it appeared before
 less hairy, and more like a man. Its hair, which in this particular animal
 was black, much more resembled that of men than the fur of brutes; for, in
 the latter, be∣sides their long hair, there is usually a finer and
 shorter intermixed; but in the ouran outang it was all of a kind; only about
 the pubes the hair was greyish, seemed longer, and somewhat different; as
 also on the upper lip and chin, <PB N="194" REF="252"/> where it was
 greyish, like the hair of a beard. The face, hands, and soles of the feet,
 were without hair; and so was most part of the forehead: but down the
 sides of the face the hair was thick, it being there about an inch and an
 half long, which exceeded that on any other part of the body. In the palms of
 its hands were remarkable those lines which are usually taken notice of in
 palmistry; and, at the tips of the fingers, those spiral lines
 ob∣served in man. The palms of the hands were as long as the soles of the
 feet; and the toes upon these were as long as the fingers; the middle toe was
 the longest of all, and the whole foot differed from the human. The hinder
 feet being thus formed as hands, the animal often used them as such; and,
 on the contrary, now and then made use of its hands instead of feet. The
 breasts appeared small and shrivelled, but exactly like those of a man:
 the navel also appeared very fair, and in exact dis∣position, being
 neither harder nor more pro∣minent than what is usually seen in children.
 Such is the description of this extraordinary creature; to which little has
 been added by succeeding observers, except that the colour of the hair is
 often found to vary: in that de∣scribed by Edwards it was of a reddish
 brown.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="253"/>From a picture so like that of the human
 species, we are naturally led to expect a cor∣responding mind; and it is
 certain, that such of these animals as have been shewn in Europe, have
 discovered a degree of imitation beyond what any quadrupede can arrive
 at.</P>
<P>That of Tyson was a gentle, fond, harmleis creature. In its
 passage to England, those that it knew on ship-board it would embrace
 with the greatest tenderness, opening their bosoms, and clasping its
 hands about them. Monkies of a lower species it held in utter aversion; it
 would always avoid the place where they were kept in the same vessel; and
 seemed to consider itself as a creature of higher extraction. After it
 was taken, and a little used to wear cloaths, it grew very fond of them; a
 part it would put on without any help, and the rest it would carry in its
 hands to some of the company, for their assistance. It would lie in a
 bed, place its head on the pillow, and pull the cloaths up∣wards, as a man
 would do.</P>
<P>That which was seen by Edwards, and de∣scribed by Buffon,
 shewed even a superior de∣gree of sagacity. It walked, like all of its
 kind, upon two legs, even though it carried burthens. Its air was melancholly,
 and its deportment grave. Unlike the baboon or monkey, whose 
 <PB N="196" REF="254"/> motions are violent and appetites capricious, who are
 fond of mischief and obedient only from fear, this animal was slow in in
 its mo∣tions, and a look was sufficient to keep it in awe. I have seen it,
 says Mr. Buffon, give its hand to show the company to the door: I have
 seen it sit at table, unfold its napkin, wipe its lips, make use of the
 spoon and the fork to carry the victuals to its mouth, pour out its drink
 into a glass, touch glasses when invited, take a cup and saucer and lay
 them on the table, put in sugar, pour out its tea, leave it to cool be∣fore
 drinking, and all this without any other instigation than the signs or the
 command of its master, and often of its own accord. It was gentle and
 inoffensive; it even approached strangers with respect, and came rather
 to re∣ceive caresses than to offer injuries. It was par∣ticularly fond of
 sugared comfits, which every body was ready to give it; and, as it had a
 de∣fluxion upon the bread, so much sugar contri∣buted to encrease the
 disorder and shorten its life. It continued at Paris but one summer, and
 died in London. It ate indiscriminately of all things, but it preferred dry
 and ripe fruits to all other aliments. It would drink wine, but in small
 quantities, and gladly left it for milk, tea, or any other sweet liquor.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="255"/>Such these animals appeared when brought
 into Europe. However, many of their extra∣ordinary habits were probably the
 result of edu∣cation, and we are not told how, long the in∣structions they
 received for this purpose were continued. But we learn from another account
 that they take but a very short time to come to a great degree of imitative
 perfection. Mr. L. Brosse bought two young ones, that were but a year old,
 from a Negroe; and these at that early age discovered an astonishing
 power of imitation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>As quoted by Buffon, vol.
 xxviii. p. 77.</BIBL></NOTE>. They even then sat at the table like men, ate
 of every thing without distinc∣tion, made use of their knife, spoon, and
 fork, both to eat their meat and help themselves. They drank wine and other
 liquors. When carried on shipboard, they had signs for the cabbin boys
 expressive of their wants; and whenever these neglected attending upon
 them as they desired, they instantly flew into a pas∣sion, seized
 them by the arm, bit them, and kept them down. The male was sea-sick, and
 required attendance like an human creature; he was even twice bled in the arm;
 and every time afterwards when he found himself out of order, he shewed his
 arm, as desirous of being relieved by bleeding.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="256"/>Pyrard relates, that in the province of Sierra
 Leona, in Africa, there are a kind of apes, called Baris, which are strong
 and muscular, and which, if properly instructed when young, serve as very
 useful domestics. They usually walk upright; they pound at a mortar; they
 go to the river to fetch water, this they carry back in a little pitcher, on
 their heads; but if care be not taken to receive the pitcher at their return,
 they let it fall to the ground, and then, seeing it broken, they begin to
 lament and cry for their loss. Le Compte's account is much to the same
 purpose of an ape, which he saw in the Streights of Molucca. 
 <Q REND="inline">"It walked upon its two hind feet, which it bent a
 little, like a dog that had been taught to dance. It made use of its hands
 and arms as we do. Its visage was not much more disagreeable than that of
 an Hottentot; but the body was all over covered with a woolly hair of different
 colours. As to the rest, it cried like a child; all its outward ac∣tions were
 so like the human, and the passions so lively and significant, that
 dumb men could scarce better express their conceptions and de∣sires. It
 had also that expression of passion or joy which we often see in
 children, stamping with its feet, and striking them against the ground,
 to shew its spight, or when refused <PB N="199" REF="257"/> any thing it
 passionately longed for. Although these animals," continues he, "are very
 big, for that I saw was four feet high, their nimble∣ness is incredible. It
 is a pleasure beyond expression to see them run up the tackling of a
 ship, where they sometimes play as if they had a knack of vaulting peculiar
 to themselves, or as if they had been paid, like our rope-dancers, to divert
 the company. Sometimes, suspended by one arm, they poize themselves, and
 then turn all of a sudden round about a rope, with as much quickness as a
 wheel, or a sling put into motion. Sometimes holding the rope
 suc∣cessively with their long fingers, and, letting their whole body fall
 into the air, they run full speed from one end to the other, and come back
 again with the same swiftness. There is no posture but they imitate,
 nor motion but they perform. Bending themselves like a bow, rolling like a
 bowl, hanging by the hands, feet, and teeth, according to the different
 fan∣cies with which their capricious imagination supplies them. But what is
 still more amazing than all is, their agility to fling themselves from one
 rope to another, though at thirty, forty, and fifty feet distance."</Q></P>
<P>Such are the habitudes and the powers of the smaller class of
 these extraordinary creatures; <PB N="200" REF="258"/> but we are presented
 with a very different pic∣ture in those of a larger stature and more
 mus∣cular form. The little animals we have been describing, which are
 seldom found above four feet high, seem to partake of the nature of dwarfs
 among the human species, being gentle, assiduous, and playful, rather
 fitted to amuse than terrify. But the gigantic races of the Ourang Outang,
 seen and described by travellers, are truly formidable; and in the gloomy
 forests, where they are only found, seem to hold undis∣puted dominion.
 Many of these are as tall or taller than a man; active, strong and
 intrepid, cunning, lascivious and cruel. This redoubtable rival of mankind is
 found in many parts of Africa, in the East-Indies, in Madagascar, and in
 Borneo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Le Compte's History of
 China.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the last of these places, the people of quality
 course him as we do the stag; and this sort of hunting is one of the
 favourite amusements of the king himself. This creature is extremely
 swift of foot, endowed with extra∣ordinary strength, and runs with
 prodigious celerity. His skin is all hairy, his eyes sunk in his head, his
 countenance stern, his face tanned, and all his lineaments, though exactly
 human, harsh and blackened by the sun. In Africa this creature is even
 still more formidable. Battel calls <PB N="201" REF="259"/> him the Pongo, and
 assures us that in all his proportions he resembles a man, except that he
 is much larger, even to a gigantic state. His face resembles that of a man,
 the eyes deep sunk in the head, the hair on each side ex∣tremely long, the
 visage naked and without hair, as also the ears and the hands. The body is
 lightly covered, and scarcely differing from that of a man, except that there
 are no calves to the legs. Still, however, the animal is seen to walk upon
 his hinder legs, and in an erect posture. He sleeps under trees, and builds
 himself an hut, which serves to protect him against the sun and the
 rains of the tropical climates, of which he is a native. He lives only upon
 fruits, and is no way carnivorous. He cannot speak, although furnished with
 greater instinct than any other animal of the brute creation. When the
 Negroes make a fire in the woods, this animal comes near and warms him∣self
 by the blaze. However, he has not skill enough to keep the flame alive by
 feeding it with fuel. They go together in companies; and if they happen to meet
 one of the human species, remote from succour, they shew him no mercy.
 They even attack the elephant, which they beat with their clubs, and oblige to
 leave that part of the forest which they claim <PB N="202" REF="260"/> as
 their own. It is impossible to take any of these dreadful creatures
 alive, for they are so strong that ten men would not be a match for but one
 of them. None of this kind, therefore, are taken except when very young, and
 these but rarely, when the female happens to leave them behind, for in
 general they keep clung to the breast, and adhere both with legs and arms.
 From the same traveller we learn, that when one of these animals dies, the
 rest cover the body with a quantity of leaves and branches. They sometimes
 also shew mercy to the human kind. A Negroe boy, that was taken by one of
 these, and carried into the woods, continued there a whole year, without
 receiving any in∣jury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Le Brosse, as quoted by
 Buffon, vol. xxviii. p. 70.</BIBL></NOTE>. From another traveller we learn,
 that these animals often attempt to surprize the fe∣male Negroes as they go
 into the woods, and frequently keep them against their wills for the
 pleasure of their company, feeding them very plentifully all the time. He
 assures us that he knew a woman of Loango that had lived among these
 animals for three years. They grow from six to seven feet high, and are of
 unequalled strength. They build sheds, and make use of clubs for their
 defence. Their faces are broad, their noses flat, their ears without a tip, 
 <PB N="203" REF="261"/> their skins are more bright than that of a Mul∣latoe,
 and they are covered on many parts of the body with long and tawny coloured
 hair. Their belly is large, their heels flat, and yet rising behind. They
 sometimes walk upright, and sometimes upon all fours, when they are
 phantastically disposed.</P>
<P>From this description of the Ouran Outang, we perceive at what a
 distance the first animal of the brute creation is placed from the very
 lowest of the human species. Even in countries peopled with savages, this
 creature is considered as a beast; and in those very places where we
 might suppose the smallest difference between them and mankind, the
 inhabitants hold it in the greatest contempt and detestation. In Borneo,
 where this animal has been said to come to its greatest perfection, the
 natives hunt it in the same manner as they pursue the elephant or the lion,
 while its re∣semblance to the human form procures it neither pity nor
 protection. The gradations of Nature in the other parts of nature are minute
 and in∣sensible; in the passage from quadrupedes to fishes we can
 scarce tell where the quadrupede ends and the fish begins; in the descent
 from beasts to insects we can hardly distinguish the steps of the
 progression; but in the ascent from brutes to man, the line is strongly
 drawn, well <PB N="204" REF="262"/> marked, and unpassable. It is in vain
 that the Ouran Outang resembles man in form, or imi∣tates many of his
 actions; he still continues a wretched, helpless creature, pent up in the
 most gloomy part of the forest, and, with regard to the provision for his
 own happiness, inferior even to the elephant or the beaver in sagacity. To
 us, indeed, this animal seems much wiser than it really is. As we have long
 been used to measure the sagacity of all actions by their similitude to
 our own, and not their fitness to the animal's way of living, we are
 pleased with the imitations of the ape, even though we know they are far from
 contributing to the convenience of its situation. An ape, or a quadrupede,
 when under the tramels of human education, may be an admirable object for human
 curiosity, but is very little advanced by all its learning in the road to its
 own felicity. On the contrary, I have never seen any of these long
 instructed animals that did not, by their melancholly air, appear
 sensible of the wretch∣edness of their situation. Its marks of
 seeming sagacity were merely relative to us and not to the animal; and all
 its boasted wisdom was merely of our own making.</P>
<P>There is, in fact, another circumstance re∣lative to this animal
 which ought not to be <PB REF="263"/>

 concealed. I have many reasons to believe that the most perfect of the kind
 are prone, like the rest of the quadrupede creation, and only owe their erect
 attitude to human education. Almost all the travellers who speak of them
 mention their going sometimes upon all fours, and sometimes erect. As their
 chief residence is among trees, they are without doubt usually seen erect
 while they are climbing; but it is more than probable that their efforts to
 escape upon the ground are by running upon the hands and feet together.
 Schouten, who mentions their education, tells us that they are taken in traps,
 and taught in the beginning to walk upon their hind legs; which certainly
 implies that in a state of nature they run upon all fours. Add to this, that,
 when we examine the palms of their hands and the soals of their feet, we find
 both equally cal∣lous and beaten; a certain proof that both have been equally
 used. In those hot countries, where the apes are known to reside, the
 soals of the Ne∣groes feet, who go bare-foot, are covered with a skin above
 an inch thick; while their hands are as soft as those of an European. Did
 the apes walk in the same manner, the same exercise would have
 furnished them with similar advan∣tages, which is not the case. Besides
 all this, I have been assured by a very credible traveller, 
 <PB N="206" REF="267"/> that these animals naturally run in the woods upon all
 fours; and when they are taken, their hands are tied behind them, to teach them
 to walk upright. This attitude they learn after some time; and, thus
 instructed, they are sent into Europe to astonish the speculative
 with their near approaches to humanity, while it is never considered how much
 is natural, and how much has been acquired in the savage schools of Benin
 and Angola.</P>
<P>The animal next to these, and to be placed in the same class,
 is the Ape, properly so called, or the Pithekos of the ancients. This is much
 less than the former, being not above a foot and an half high, but walks
 erect, is without a tail, and is easily tamed.</P>
<P>Of this kind also is the Gibbon, so called by Buffon, or the
 Long Armed Ape, which is a very extraordinary and remarkable creature. It is of
 different sizes, being from four feet to two feet high. It walks erect, is
 without a tail, has a face resembling that of a man, with a circle of bushy
 hair all round the visage; its eyes are large and sunk in its head; its
 face tanned and its ears exactly proportioned. But that in which it chiefly
 differs from all others of the monkey tribe is the extraordinary length of its
 arms, which, when the animal <PB REF="268"/>

 posture at the same time. This animal, next to the Ouran Outang and the
 Ape, most nearly resembles mankind, not only in form, but in gentle manners
 and tractable disposition. It is a native of the East-Indies, and
 particularly found along the coasts of Co∣romandel.</P>
<P>The last of the ape kind is the Cynocephalus, or the Magot of
 Buffon. This animal wants a tail, like the former, although there is a small
 protuberance at that part, which yet is rather formed by the skin than the
 bone. It differs also in having a large callous red rump. The face is
 prominent, and approaches more to that of quadrupedes than of man. The body is
 covered with a brownish hair, and yellow on the belly. It is about three feet
 and an half, or four feet high, and is a native of most parts of Africa and
 the East. As it recedes from man in its form, so also it appears
 different in its dispositions, being sullen, vicious, and
 un∣tractable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">

<HEAD>THE BABOON.</HEAD>
<P>DESCENDING from the more perfect of the monkey kinds, we come to
 the baboon and its varieties, a large, fierce, and formidable race, that,
 mixing the figure of the man and the quadrupede in their conformation, seem
 to pos∣sess only the defects of both; the petulance of the one, and the
 ferocity of the other. These animals have a short tail; a prominent face;
 with canine teeth, larger than those of men, and callossities on the
 rump<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxviii. p. 183.</BIBL></NOTE>.
 In man the physiognomy may deceive, and the figure of body does not always
 lead to the qualities of the mind; but in animals we may always judge of their
 dispositions by their looks, and form a just conjecture of their internal
 habits from their external form. If we compare the nature of the ape and baboon
 by this easy rule, we shall at once be led to pronounce that they greatly
 differ in their dispositions, and that the latter are infinitely more
 fierce, savage and malicious than the former. The ouran outang, that so
 nearly resembles man in its figure, approaches also nearest in the
 gentleness of its manners and the pliancy of its temper. The cynocephalus,
 that of all other apes is most unlike man in <PB N="209" REF="276"/> form, and
 approaches nearer the dog in face, resembles also the brute in nature,
 being wild, restless, and impelled by a fretful impetuosity. But the
 baboon, who is still more remote, and resembles man only in having hands,
 who, from having a tail, a prominent face, and sharp claws, approaches more
 nearly to the savage tribe, is every way fierce, malicious, ignorant and
 un∣tractable.</P>
<P>The baboon, properly so called, is from three to four feet high,
 very strong built, with a thick body and limbs, and canine teeth, much longer
 than those of men. It has large cal∣losities behind, which are quite naked
 and red. Its tail is crooked and thick, and about seven or eight inches long.
 Its snout, for it can hardly be called a face, is long and thick, and on each
 side of its cheeks it has a pouch, into which, when satiated with eating,
 it puts the remainder of its provisions. It is covered with long thick hair
 of a reddish brown colour, and pretty uniform over the whole body. It walks
 more commonly upon all fours than up∣right, and its hands as well as its feet
 are armed with long sharp claws, instead of the broad round nails of the
 ape kind.</P>
<P>An animal thus made for strength, and fur∣nished with
 dangerous weapons, is found in fact <PB N="210" REF="277"/> to be one of the
 most formidable of the savage race, in those countries where it is bred.
 It appears in its native woods, to be impelled by two opposite passions;
 an hatred for the males of the human species, and a desire for women. Were
 we assured of these strange oppositions in its disposition from
 one testimony alone, the account might appear doubtful; but, as it comes from
 a variety of the most credible witnesses, we cannot refuse our
 assent. From them, therefore, we learn that these animals will often
 assail women in a body, and force them into the woods, where they keep them
 against their will, and kill them when refractory. From the Chevalier Forbin
 we learn, that in Siam whole troops of these will often sally forth from
 their forests, and attack a village, when they know the men are engaged in
 their rice harvest. They are on such occasions actuated as well by
 desire as by hunger; and not only plunder the houses of whatever
 provisions they can find, but endeavour to force the women. These, however,
 as the Chevalier humourously relates, not at all liking either the manners or
 the figure of the paltry gallants, boldly stand on their defence, and with
 clubs, or whatever other arms they can provide, instead of answering their
 caresses, oblige their ugly suitors to retreat; <PB N="211" REF="278"/>
 not, however, before they have damaged or plundered every thing eatable they
 can lay their hands on.</P>
<P>At the Cape of Good Hope they are less for∣midable, but to the
 best of their power equally mischievous. They are there under a sort of
 natural discipline, and go about whatever they undertake with surprizing
 skill and regularity. When they set about robbing an orchard or a vineyard,
 for they are extremely fond of grapes, apples, and ripe fruit, they do not go
 singly to work, but in large companies, and with pre∣concerted deliberation.
 On these occasions, a part of them enter the enclosure, while one is
 set to watch. The rest stand without the fence, and form a line reaching
 all the way from their fellows within to their rendezvous without, which is
 generally in some craggy mountain. Every thing being thus disposed, the
 plunderers within the orchard throw the fruit to those that are without as
 fast as they can gather it; or, if the wall or hedge be high, to those that
 sit on the top; and these hand the plunder to those next them on the
 other side. Thus the fruit is pitched from one to another all along the line,
 till it is safely deposited at their head quarters. They catch it as
 readily as the most skilful tennis player can a ball; and while the
 business <PB N="212" REF="279"/> is going forward, which they conduct with
 great expedition, a most profound silence is observed among them. Their
 centinel, during this whole time, continues upon the watch, extremely anxious
 and attentive; but if he perceives any one coming, he instantly sets up a
 loud cry, and at this signal the whole company scamper off. Nor yet are
 they at any time willing to leave the place empty handed; for if they be
 plun∣dering a bed of melons, for instance, they go off with one in their
 mouths, one in their hands, and one under their arm. If the pursuit is hot,
 they drop first that from under their arm, then that from their hand; and, if
 it be continued, they at last let fall that which they had hitherto kept in
 their mouths.</P>
<P>The natives of the Cape often take the young of these animals,
 and, feeding them with sheep and goats milk, accustom them to guard their
 houses; which duty they perform with great punctuality. Those, however,
 that have been brought into Europe, are headstrong, rude, and untractable.
 Dogs and cats, when they have done any thing wrong, will run off; but these
 seem careless and insensible of the mischief they do; and I have
 seen one of them break a whole table of china, as it should seem by
 design, with∣out appearing in the least conscious of having 
 <PB N="213" REF="280"/> done amiss. It was not, however, in any respect so
 formidable as that described by Mr. Buffon, of which he gives the following
 description. 
 <Q REND="inline">"It was not," says he, "extremely ugly, and yet
 it excited horror. It continually appeared in a state of savage ferocity,
 gnashing its teeth, flying at the spectators, and furiously restless.
 It was obliged to be confined in an iron cage, the bars of which it so
 forcibly attempted to break, that the spectators were struck with
 apprehen∣sion. It was a stocky bold animal, whose short limbs and
 powerful exertions shewed vast strength and agility. The long hair with
 which it was covered seemed to add to its apparent abilities; which, however,
 were in reality so great, that it could easily overcome more than a
 single man, unless armed. As to the rest, it for ever appeared excited by
 that passion which renders the mildest animals at intervals furious. Its
 lasciviousness was constant, and its satisfac∣tions particular. Some
 others also of the monkey kind shewed the same degree of impudence, and
 particularly in the presence of women; but, as they were less in size,
 their petulance was less obvious, and their insolence more easily
 cor∣rected."</Q></P>
<P>But, however violent the desires of these animals may be, they
 are not found to breed <PB N="214" REF="281"/> in our climate. The female brings
 forth usually but one at a time, which she carries in her arms, and in a
 peculiar manner clinging to her breast. As to the rest, these animals are
 not at all car∣nivorous; they principally feed upon fruits, roots, and corn,
 and generally keep together in companies. The internal parts are more unlike
 those of man than of quadrupedes, particularly the liver, which is like that
 of a dog divided into six lobes. The lungs are more divided, the guts in
 general are shorter, and the kidnies rounder and flatter.</P>
<P>The largest of the baboon kind is the Man∣dril; an ugly
 disgusting animal, with a tail shorter than the former, though of a much
 larger sta∣ture, being from four to five feet high. The muzzle is still
 longer than that of the preceding, it is of a bluish colour, and strongly
 marked with wrinkles, which give it a frightful ap∣pearance. But what renders
 it truly loathsome is, that from the nose there is always seen
 is∣suing a snot, which the animal takes care at in∣tervals to lick off
 with its tongue and swallow. it is a native of the Gold Coast; it is said
 to walk more frequently erect than upon all fours; and when displeased, to
 weep like a child. There was one of them shewn in England some years ago.
 It seemed tame but stupid, and had a <PB REF="282"/>

 blowing at such as came too near.</P>
<P>The Wanderow is a baboon rather less than the former, with the
 body less compact and muscular, and the hinder parts seemingly more
 feeble. The tail is from seven to eight inches long; the muzzle is prominent
 as in the rest of this kind; but what particularly distinguishes it is a
 large long white head of hair, together with a monstrous white beard,
 coarse, rough, and descending; the colour of the rest of the body being
 brown or black. As to the rest, in its savage state, it is equally fierce
 with the others; but, with a proper education, it seems more tractable than
 most of its kind, and is chiefly seen in the woods of Ceylon and
 Ma∣labar.</P>
<P>The Maimon of Buffon, which Edwards calls the Pigtail, is the
 last of the baboons, and in size rather approaches the monkey, being no
 larger than a cat. Its chief distinction, besides its pro∣minent muzzle,
 like a baboon, is in the tail, which is about five or six inches long, and
 curled up like that of an hog; from which cir∣cumstance, peculiar to this
 animal, our English naturalist gave it the name. It is a native of Sumatra,
 and does not well endure the rigours of our climate. Edwards, however, kept one

 <PB N="216" REF="286"/> of them a year in London; and another of them happening
 at the same time to be exposed in a shew of beasts, he brought the two
 exiles to∣gether, to see if they would claim or acknow∣ledge their kindred.
 The moment they came into each other's presence, they testified their
 mutual satisfaction, and seemed quite trans∣ported at the interview.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE MONKEY.</HEAD>
<P>THE varieties in the larger tribes of the monkey kind are but few;
 in the ape we have seen but four, and in the baboon about as many. But when
 we come to the smaller class, the dif∣ferences among them seem too
 tedious for enu∣meration. These, as was observed in the be∣ginning, are all
 small in stature, and with long tails, by which they are distinguished
 from the preceding, that entirely want the tail, or are large and have but a
 short one. The varieties in the form and colour of dogs, or squirrels, is
 nothing to what are found among monkies of the smaller kind. Bosman
 mentions above fifty sorts on the Gold Coast alone, and Smith con∣firms the
 account. Condamine asserts that it would take up a volume to describe the
 diffe∣rences of these to be found along the river Amazons; and we are sure
 that every one of <PB N="217" REF="287"/> these is very different from those
 on the African coast. Naturalists, however, have undertaken to make a
 catalogue of their numbers; and they either transmit their descriptions
 from one to another, or only enumerate those few that have found their way to
 Europe, and have fallen within the narrow circle of their own observa∣tion.
 But, though it may be proper enough to describe such as fall under notice,
 it is certainly wrong to offer a scanty catalogue as complete, and to induce
 the reader to suppose he sees a picture of the whole groupe of these
 animals when he is only presented with a small part of the number. Such,
 therefore, as are fond of the reputation of adding new descriptions to the
 stock of natural history, have here a wide, though surely a barren, field
 to enlarge in; and they will find it no difficult matter, by observ∣ing the
 various animals of this kind that are from time to time brought from their
 native coasts to this country, to indulge in description, and to ring the
 changes upon all the technical terms with which this most pleasing
 science is obscured and rendered disgusting. For my own part, I will
 spare the reader and myself the trouble of entering into an elaborate
 description of each; content with observing once more, that their numbers
 are very great and their dif∣ferences <PB N="218" REF="288"/> very trifling.
 There is scarce a country in the tropical climates that does not swarm with
 them, and scarce a forest that is not inhabited by a race of monkies
 distinct from all others. Every different wood along the coasts of Africa
 may be considered as a separate colony of mon∣kies, differing from those
 of the next district in colour, in size, and malicious mischief. It is
 indeed remarkable that the monkies of two cantons are never found to mix with
 each other, but rigorously to observe a separation; each forest
 produces only its own; and these guard their limits from the intrusion of
 all strangers of a different race from themselves. In this they somewhat
 resemble the human inhabitants of the savage nations, among whom they are
 found, where the petty kingdoms are numerous, and their manners opposite.
 There, in the ex∣tent of a few miles, the traveller is presented with men
 speaking different languages, pro∣fessing different religions, governed
 by different laws, and only resembling each other in their mutual
 animosity.</P>
<P>In general, monkies of all kinds, being less than the baboon,
 are endued with less powers of doing mischief. Indeed, the ferocity of
 their nature seems to diminish with their size; and when taken wild in
 the woods, they are sooner <PB N="219" REF="289"/> tamed, and more easily
 taught to imitate man than the former. More gentle than the baboon, and less
 grave and sullen than the ape, they soon begin to exert all their
 sportive mimickries, and are easily restrained by correction. But it
 must be confessed that they will do nothing they are de∣sired without
 beating; for, if their fears be entirely removed, they are the most
 insolent and headstrong animals in nature.</P>
<P>In their native woods they are not less the pests of man than
 of other animals. The monkies, says a traveller<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Description Historique de Macacar, p. 51.</BIBL></NOTE>,
 are in possession of every forest where they reside, and may be
 con∣sidered as the masters of the place. Neither the tiger, nor the lion
 itself, will venture to dis∣pute the dominion, since these, from the
 tops of trees, continually carry on an offensive war, and by their agility
 escape all possibility of pur∣suit. Nor have the birds less to fear
 from their continual depredations; for, as these harmless inhabitants of
 the wood usually build upon trees, the monkies are for ever on the watch to
 find out and rob their nests; and such is their petulant delight in
 mischief, that they will fling their eggs against the ground when they want
 appetite or inclination to devour them.</P>
<P>There is but one animal in all the forest that 
 <PB N="220" REF="290"/> ventures to oppose the monkey, and that is the
 serpent. The larger snakes are often seen winding up the trees where the
 monkies reside; and, when they happen to surprize them sleep∣ing,
 swallow them whole before the little ani∣mals have time to make a defence. In
 this manner, the two most mischievous kinds in all nature keep the whole
 forest between them; both equally formidable to each other, and for ever
 employed in mutual hostilities. The monkies in general inhabit the tops of
 the trees, and the serpents cling to the bran∣ches nearer the bottom; and in
 this manner they are for ever seen near each other, like ene∣mies in the
 same field of battle. Some travellers, indeed, have supposed that their
 vicinity rather argued their mutual friendship, and that they united in this
 manner to form an offensive league against all the rest of animated
 nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Labat, Relat. del Afriq. Occident, p.
 317.</BIBL></NOTE>. 
 <Q REND="inline">"I have seen these monkies," says Labat,
 "play∣ing their gambols upon those very branches on which the snakes were
 reposing, and jumping over them without receiving any injury, al∣though the
 serpents of that country were natu∣rally vindictive, and always ready to bite
 what∣ever disturbed them."</Q> These gambols, however, were probably
 nothing more than the insults of <PB N="221" REF="291"/> an enemy that was
 conscious of its own safety; and the monkies might have provoked the
 snake in the same manner as we often see spar∣rows twitter at a cat.
 However this be, the forest is generally divided between them; and these
 woods, which Nature seems to have em∣bellished with her richest
 magnificence, rather inspire terror than delight, and chiefly serve as
 retreats for mischief and malignity.</P>
<P>The enmity of these animals to mankind, is partly ridiculous,
 and partly formidable. They seem, says Le Comte and others, to have a
 peculiar instinct in discovering their foes; and are perfectly skilled,
 when attacked, in mu∣tually defending and assisting each other. When a
 traveller enters among these woods, they consider him as an invader upon
 their domi∣nions, and join all to repel the intrusion. At first they
 survey him with a kind of insolent cu∣riosity They jump from branch to
 branch, pursue him as he goes along, and make a loud chattering, to call the
 rest of their companions together. They then begin their hostilities by
 grinning, threatening, and flinging down the withered branches at him, which
 they break from the trees: they even take their excre∣ments in their hands, and
 throw them at his head. Thus they attend him wherever he goes; 
 <PB N="222" REF="292"/> jumping from tree to tree with such amazing
 swiftness, that the eye can scarce attend their motions. Although they
 take the most des∣perate leaps, yet they are seldom seen to come to the
 ground, for they easily fasten upon the branches that break their fall, and
 stick, either by their hands, feet, or tail, wherever they touch. If one of
 them happens to be wounded, the rest assemble round, and clap their
 fingers into the wound, as if they were desirous of sounding its depth. If
 the blood flows in any quantity, some of them keep it shut up, while others
 get leaves, which they chew, and thrust into the opening: however
 extraordinary this may appear, it is asserted to be often seen, and to be
 strictly true. In this manner they wage a pe∣tulant, unequal war; and are
 often killed in numbers before they think proper to make a retreat. This they
 effect with the same preci∣pitation with which they at first came together.
 In this retreat the young are seen clinging to the back of the female, with
 which she jumps away, seemingly unembarrassed by the burthen.</P>
<P>The curiosity of the Europeans has, in some measure, induced
 the natives of the places where these animals reside, to catch or take them
 alive by every art they are able. The <PB N="223" REF="293"/> usual way in
 such case, is to shoot the female as she carries her young, and then
 both, of course, tumble to the ground. But even this is not easily
 performed; for if the animal be not killed outright, it will not fall; but
 clinging to some branch, continues, even when dead, its former grasp, and
 remains on the tree where it was shot, until it drops off by putrefaction: In
 this manner it is totally lost to the pursuer; for to attempt climbing the
 tree, to bring either it or the young one down, would probably be fatal, from
 the number of serpents that are hid among the branches. For this reason the
 sportsman always takes care to aim at the head; which, if he hits, the
 monkey falls directly to the ground; and the young one comes down at the same
 time, clinging to its dead parent.</P>
<P>The Europeans along the coasts of Guniea, often go into the
 woods to shoot monkies; and nothing pleases the Negroes more than to see
 those animals drop, against which they have the greatest animosity.
 They consider them, and not without reason, as the most mischievous and
 tormenting creatures in the world; and are happy to see their numbers
 destroyed, upon a double account; as well because they dread their
 devastations, as because they love their flesh. The monkey, which is
 always skinned <PB N="224" REF="294"/> before it is eaten, when served up at
 a Negroe feast, looks, so like a child, that an European is shocked at
 the very sight. The natives, however, who are not so nice, devour it as one
 of the highest delicacies; and assiduously attend our sportsmen, to
 profit by the spoil. But what they are chiefly astonished at, is to see
 our tra∣vellers carefully taking the young ones alive, while they leave them
 the old ones, that are certainly the most fit to be eaten. They cannot
 comprehend what advantage can arise to us from educating or keeping a little
 animal, that, by experience, they know to be equally fraught with tricks and
 mischief: some of them have even been led to suppose, that, with a kind
 of perverse affection, we love only creatures of the most mischievous
 kinds; and having seen us often buy young and tame monkies, they have taken
 equal care to bring rats to our factors, offering them for sale, and greatly
 disappointed at finding no purchaser for so hopeful a com∣modity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Labat, Relat. de l'Afriq. Occident, p.
 317.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Negroes consider these animals as their greatest plague;
 and, indeed, they do incre∣dible damage, when they come in companies to lay
 waste a field of Indian corn or rice, or a plantation of sugar-canes. They
 carry off as <PB N="225" REF="295"/> much as they are able; and they destroy
 ten times more than they bear away. Their manner of plundering is pretty much
 like that of the baboons, already mentioned, in a garden. One of them stands
 centinel upon a tree, while the rest are plundering, carefully and
 cautiously turning on every side, but particularly to that on which there
 is the greatest danger: in the mean time, the rest of the spoilers
 pursue their work with great silence and assiduity; they are not
 contented with the first blade of corn, or the first cane that they happen
 to lay their hands on: they first pull up such as appear most alluring to
 the eye: they turn it round, examine, compare it with others, and if they find
 it to their mind, stick it under one of their shoulders. When in this
 manner they have got their load, they begin to think of re∣treating: but if it
 should happen that the owners of the field appear to interrupt their
 depredations, their faithful centinel instantly gives notice, by crying out,
 <HI>houp, houp, houp</HI>; which the rest perfectly understand, and all at
 once throwing down the corn they hold in the left hands, scamper off upon
 three legs, carrying the remainder in the right. If they are still hotly
 pursued, they then are content to throw down their whole burthen, and to take
 refuge <PB N="226" REF="296"/> among their woods, on the tops of which they
 remain in perfect security.</P>
<P>Were we to give faith to what some travellers assure us, of
 the government, policies, and subordination of these animals, we might
 per∣haps be taxed with credulity; but we have no reason to doubt that they
 are under a kind of discipline, which they exercise among each other. They
 are generally seen to keep together in com∣panies, to march in exact order,
 and to obey the voice of some particular chieftain, remark∣able for his
 size and gravity. One species of these, which Mr. Buffon calls the
 Ouarine, and which are remarkable for the loudness and the distinctness
 of their voice, are still more so for the use to which they convert it. 
 <Q REND="inline">"I have fre∣quently been a witness," says
 Morgrave, "of their assemblies and deliberations. Every day, both morning
 and evening, the ouarines as∣semble in the woods to receive instructions.
 When all come together, one among the num∣ber takes the highest place on a
 tree, and makes a signal with his hand to the rest to sit round, in order
 to hearken. As soon as he sees them placed, he begins his discourse,
 with so loud a voice, and yet in a manner so precipitate, that to hear him
 at a distance, one would think the whole company were crying out at the
 same <PB N="227" REF="297"/> time: however, during that time, one only is
 speaking; and all the rest observe the most profound silence. When
 this has done, he makes a sign with the hand for the rest to reply; and at
 that instant they raise their voices to∣gether, until by another signal
 of the hand they are enjoined silence. This they as readily obey; till, at
 last, the whole assembly breaks up, after hearing a repetition of the
 same preachment."</Q></P>
<P>The chief food of the monkey-tribe is fruits, the buds of trees,
 or succulent roots and plants. They all, like man, seem fond of sweets;
 and particularly the pleasant juice of the palm-tree, and the sugar cane.
 With these the fertile regions in which they are bred, seldom fail to
 supply them; but when it happens that these fail, or that more nourishing
 food becomes more agreeable, they eat insects and worms; and, sometimes, if
 near the coasts, descend to the sea-shore, where they eat oysters,
 crabs, and shell fish. Their manner of managing an oyster is
 extraordinary enough; but it is too well attested, to fail of our assent.
 As the oysters in the tropical climates are generally larger than with us,
 the monkies, when they go to the sea-side pick up a stone, and clap it
 between the opening shells: this prevents them <PB N="228" REF="298"/> from
 closing; and the monkey then eats the fish at his ease. They often also
 draw crabs from the water, by putting their tail to the hole where that animal
 takes refuge, and the crab fastening upon it, they withdraw it with a jerk,
 and thus pull their prey upon shore. This habit of laying traps for other
 animals, makes them very cautious of being entrapped them∣selves; and I am
 assured, by many persons of credit, that no snare, how nicely baited
 soever, will take the monkey of the West-Indian islands; for having been
 accustomed to the cunning of man, it opposes its natural distrust to
 human artifice.</P>
<P>The monkey generally brings forth one at a time, and sometimes
 two. They are rarely found to breed when brought over into Europe; but of
 those that do, they exhibit a very striking picture of parental affection.
 The male and female are never tired of fondling their young one. They
 instruct it with no little assiduity; and often severely correct it, if
 stubborn, or dis∣inclined to profit by their example: they hand it from one
 to the other; and when the male has done shewing his regard, the female takes
 her turn. When wild in the woods, the fe∣male, if she happens to have two,
 carries one on her back, and the other in her arms: that <PB N="229" REF="299"/>
 on her back clings very closely, clasping its hands round her neck, and its
 feet about her middle; when she wants to suckle it, she then alters their
 position; and that which has been fed gives place to the other, which she
 takes in her arms. It often happens that she is un∣able to leap from one tree
 to another, when thus loaden; and upon such occasions, their dexterity is
 very surprizing. The whole family form a kind of chain, locking tail in tail,
 or hand in hand, and one of them holding the branch above, the rest swing
 down, balancing to and fro, like a pendulum, until the under∣most is enabled
 to catch hold of the lower branches of some neighbouring tree. When the hold
 is fixed below, the monkey lets go that which was above, and thus comes
 under∣most in turn; but, creeping up along the chain, attains the next
 branches, like the rest; and thus they all take possession of the
 tree, without ever coming to the ground.</P>
<P>When in a state of domestic tameness, those animals are
 very amusing, and often fill up a vacant hour, when other entertainment is
 want∣ing. There are few that are not acquainted with their various mimickries,
 and their ca∣pricious feats of activity. But it is generally in company with
 other animals of a more simple <PB N="230" REF="300"/> disposition that
 their tricks and superior in∣stincts are shewn; they seem to take a
 delight in tormenting them; and I have seen one of them amusing itself
 for hours together, in im∣posing upon the gravity of a cat. Erasmus tells
 us of a large monkey, kept by Sir Thomas More, that, one day diverting itself
 in his garden, where some tame rabbits were kept, played several of its
 usual pranks among them, while the rabbits scarce well knew what to make of
 their new acquaintance: in the mean time, a weasel, that came for very
 different purposes than those of entertainment, was seen peering about
 the place in which the rabbits were fed, and endeavouring to make its way, by
 removing a board that closed their hutch. While the monkey saw no danger,
 it continued a calm spectator of the enemy's efforts; but just when, by
 long labour, the weasel had effected its purpose, and had removed the
 board, the monkey stept in, and, with, the utmost dexte∣rity, fastened it
 again in its place; and the dis∣appointed weasel was too much fatigued to
 renew its operations. To this I will only add what Father Carli, in his
 history of An∣gola assures us to be true. In that horrid country, where
 he went to convert the savage natives to Christianity, and met with nothing
 <PB N="231" REF="301"/> but distress and disappointment; while his health
 was totally impaired by the raging heats of the climate, his patience
 exhausted by the obstinacy of the stupid natives, and his little
 provisions daily plundered, without redress, in such an exigency he found
 more faithful services from the monkies than the men; these he had taught
 to attend him, to guard him, while sleep∣ing, against thieves and rats, to
 comb his head, to fetch his water; and, he asserts, that they were even
 more tractable than the human inhabitants of the place. It is indeed
 remarkable, that in those countries where the men are most bar∣barous and
 stupid, the brutes are most active and sagacious. It is in the torrid
 tracts, in∣habited by Barbarians, that such various animals are found with
 instincts so nearly approaching reason. The savages both of Africa and
 Ame∣rica, accordingly suppose monkies to be men; idle, slothful, rational
 beings; capable of speech and conversation; but obstinately dumb, for
 fear of being compelled to labour.</P>
<P>As of all savages, those of Africa are the most brutal,
 so, of all countries, the monkies of Africa are the most expert and
 entertaining. The monkies of America are, in general, neither so sagacious
 nor so tractable, nor is their form so nearly approaching that of man. 
 <PB N="232" REF="302"/> The monkies of the new continent, may be very easily
 distinguished from those of the old, by three marks. Those of the
 ancient conti∣nent are universally found to have a naked callous
 substance behind, upon which they sit; which those of America are
 entirely without; those also of the ancient continent have the nostrils
 differently formed, more resembling those of men, the holes opening
 downward; whereas the American monkies have them opening on each side;
 those of the ancient world, have pouches on each side the jaw, into which
 they put their provisions, which those of America are without: lastly,
 none of the monkies of the ancient continent hang by the tail, which many of
 the American sorts are known to do. By these marks the monkies of either
 continent, may be readily distinguished from each other, and prized
 accordingly. The African monkey, as I am assured, requires a longer
 education, and more correction, than that of America; but it is at last found
 ca∣pable of more various powers of imitation; and shews a greater degree of
 cunning and activity.</P>
<P>Mr. Buffon, who has examined this race of imitative beings, with
 greater accuracy than any other naturalist before him, makes but 
 <PB N="233" REF="303"/> nine species of monkies belonging to the ancient
 continent; and eleven belonging to the new. To all these he gives the names
 which they go by, in their respective countries; which, un∣doubtedly, is the
 method least liable to error, and the most proper for imitation.</P>
<P>Of the monkies of the ancient continent, the first, he
 describes, is the Macaguo; some∣what resembling a baboon in size,
 strength of body, and an hideous wrinkled visage: it differs, however, in
 having a very long tail, which is covered with tufted hair. It is a native of
 Congo.</P>
<P>The second is the Patas, which is about the same size with
 the former; but differs, in hav∣ing a longer body, and a face less hideous;
 it is particularly remarkable for the colour of its hair, which is of a red,
 so brilliant, that the animal looks as if it were actually painted. It is
 usually brought from Senegal; and by some, called the Red African
 Monkey.</P>
<P>The third of the ancient continent is the Malbrouk; of which he
 supposes the monkey which he calls the Bonet Chinois to be a variety. The
 one is remarkable for a long tail, and long beard; the other, for a cap of
 hair, that covers the crown of the head, from whence it takes the name. Both
 are natives of the East Indies; <PB N="234" REF="304"/> and the Bramins, who
 extend their charity to all the brute creation, have hospitals for such of
 them as happen to be sick, or otherwise disabled.</P>
<P>The fourth of this kind, is the Mangabey; this may be
 distinguished from all others, by its eye-lids, which are naked, and of a
 striking whiteness. It is a native of Madagascar.</P>
<P>The fifth is the Mona, or the Cephus of the ancients: it is
 distinguished by its colour, which is variegated with black and red; and
 its tail is of an ash-colour, with two white spots on each side, at its
 insertion. It is a native of the northern parts of Africa.</P>
<P>The sixth is the Callitrix, or Green Monkey of St. Iägo;
 distinguished by its beautiful green colour on the back, its white breast
 and belly, and its black face.</P>
<P>The seventh is the Moustoc, or White Nose; distinguished
 by the whiteness of its lips, from whence it has received its name, the
 rest of the face being of a deep blue. It is a native of the Gold Coast,
 and a very beautiful little animal.</P>
<P>The eighth is the Talapoin; and may be distinguished as well
 by its beautiful variety of green, white, and yellow hair, as by that under the
 eyes, being of a greater length than the rest. <PB N="235" REF="305"/> It is
 supposed to be a native of Africa and the east.</P>
<P>The ninth and last of the monkies of the ancient continent, is
 the Douc, so called in Co∣chinchina, of which country it is a native. The
 douc seems to unite the characters of all the former together: with a long
 tail, like the monkey; of a size as large as the baboon; and with a flat
 face, like the ape: it even resembles the American monkies, in having no
 callous on its posteriors. Thus it seems to form the shade by which the
 monkies of one continent are linked with those of the other.</P>
<P>Next come the monkies of the new continent; which, as hath been
 said, differ from those of the old, in the make of their nostrils, in
 their having no callosity on their posteriors, and in their having no
 pouches on each side of the jaw. They differ also from each other, a part
 of them making no use of their tails to hang by; while others of them have
 the tail very strong and muscular, and serving by way of a fifth hand to
 hold by. Those with muscular holding tails, are called Sapajous; those
 with feeble, useless tails, are called Sagoins. Of the sapa∣jous there
 are five sorts: of the sagoins there are six.</P>
<P>The first of the sapajous is the Warine, or 
 <PB N="236" REF="306"/> the Brazilian Guariba. This monkey is as large as a fox,
 with black long hair, and re∣markable for the loudness of its voice. It is
 the largest of the monkey kind to be found in America.</P>
<P>The second is the Coaiti; which may be distingtuished from
 the rest, by having no thumb, and, consequently, but four fingers on the
 two fore paws. The tail, however, supplies the defects of the hand; and with
 this the animal slings itself from one tree to another, with sur∣prizing
 rapidity.</P>
<P>The third is the Sajou; distinguished from the rest of the
 sapajous, by its yellowish, flesh-coloured face.</P>
<P>The fourth is the Sai. It is somewhat larger than the sajou,
 and has a broader muzzle. It is called also the Bewailer; from its peculiar
 manner of lamenting, when either threatened or beaten.</P>
<P>The fifth and last of the sapajou kind, or monkies that hold
 by the tail, is the Samiri, or Aurora; which is the smallest and the most
 beautiful of all. It is of a fine orange colour, with two circles of flesh
 round the eyes. It is a very tender, delicate animal, and held in high
 price.</P>
<P>Of the sagoins with feeble tails, there are six 
 <PB N="237" REF="307"/> kinds. The first and the largest, is the Saki, or
 Cagui; so remarkable for the length of the hair on its tail, that it has been
 often termed the Fox-Tailed Monkey. It is of different sizes; some being
 twice as large as others.</P>
<P>The second of this kind is the Tamaim; which is usually black,
 with the feet yellow. Some, however, are found all over brown, spotted with
 yellow.</P>
<P>The third is the Wistiti; remarkable for the large tufts of hair
 upon its face, and its annulated tail.</P>
<P>The fourth is the Marikina; with a mane round the neck, and a
 bunch of hair at the end of the tail, like a lion.</P>
<P>The fifth is called the Pinch; with the face of a beautiful black,
 and white hair that de∣scends on each side of the face, like that of
 man.</P>
<P>The last, least, and most beautiful of all, is the Mico, an
 animal too curiously adorned, not to demand a particular description; which
 is thus given of it, by Mr. Condamine. 
 <Q REND="inline">"That," says he, "which the governor of Para
 made me a present of, was the only one of its kind that was seen in the
 country. The hair on its body was of a beautiful silver colour, brighter than
 that of the most venerable human hair: <PB N="238" REF="308"/> while the tail
 was of a deep brown, inclining to blackness. It had another singularity,
 more remarkable than the former; its ears, its cheeks, and lips, were tinctured
 with so bright a vermil∣lion, that one could scarce be led to suppose
 that it was natural. I kept it a year; and it was still alive when I made
 this description of it, almost within sight of the coasts of France:
 all I could then do, was to preserve it in spirits of wine, which might
 serve to keep it in such a state, as to shew that I did not in the
 least exaggerate in my description."</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF THE MAKI.</HEAD>
<P>THE last of the monkey kind are the Makies; which have no other
 pretensions to be placed in this class, except that of having hands like
 the former, and making use of them to climb trees, or to pluck their food.
 Animals of the hare kind, indeed, are often seen to feed themselves with
 their fore paws, but they can hold nothing in one of them singly, and are
 obliged to take up whatever they eat in both at once: but it is otherwise
 with the maki; as well as the monkey kinds, they seize their food with one
 hand, pretty much like a man, and grasp it with great ease and firmness.

</FIGURE> <PB N="239" REF="310"/> maki, therefore, from this
 conformation in its hands, both before and behind, approaches nearly to the
 monkey kind; out, in other re∣spects, such as the make of the snout, the
 form of the ears, and the parts that distinguish the sexes, it entirely
 differs from them. There are many different kinds of these animals; all
 varying from each other in colour or size, but agreeing in the human-like
 figure of their hands and feet, and in their long nose, which some∣what
 resembles that of a dog. As most of these are bred in the depths of the
 forest, we know little more concerning them than their figure. Their way of
 living, their power of pursuit and escape, can only be supposed, from
 the analogy of their conformation, somewhat to resemble those of the
 monkey.</P>
<P>The first of this kind is the Mococo; a beautiful animal, about
 the size of a common cat, but the body and limbs slenderer, and of a longer
 make. It has a very long tail, at least double the length of its body; it is
 covered with fur, and marked alternately with broad rings of black and white.
 But what it is chiefly remarkable for, besides the form of its hands and
 feet, is the largeness of its eyes, which are surrounded with a broad black
 space; and the length of the hinder legs, which by far exceed <PB REF="311"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="239" REF="312"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="240" REF="313"/> those
 before. When it sleeps, it brings its nose to its belly, and its tail over
 its head. When it plays, it uses a sort of galloping, with its tail
 raised over its back, which keeps continually in motion. The head is covered
 with dark ash-coloured hair; the back and sides, with a red ash-colour,
 and not so dark as on the head; and the whole, glossy, soft and
 de∣licate, smooth to the touch, and standing al∣most upright, like the
 pile of velvet. It is a native of Madagascar; appears to be an harm∣less
 gentle animal; and though it resembles the monkey in many respects, it has
 neither its ma∣lice nor its mischief: nevertheless, like the monkey, it
 seems to be always in motion; and moves, like all four-handed animals, in an
 oblique direction.</P>
<P>A second of this kind, which is also a native of Madagascar,
 is the Mongooz; which is less than the former; with a soft, glossy
 robe, but a little curled. The nose also is thicker than that of the
 mococo; the eyes are black, with orange-coloured circles round the pupil; and
 the tail is of one uniform colour. As to the rest, it is found of various
 colours; some being black, others brown; and its actions some∣what
 resemble those of a monkey.</P>
<P>The Vari is much larger than either of the <PB N="241" REF="314"/>
 former; its hair is much longer, and it has a kind of ruff round the neck,
 consisting of very long hair, by which it may be easily
 distin∣guished from the rest. It differs also in its dis∣position,
 which is fierce and savage; as also in the loudness of its voice, which
 somewhat re∣sembles the roaring of the lion. This also is a native of
 Madagascar.</P>
<P>To this tribe we may refer a little four-handed animal, of the
 island of Ceylon, which Mr. Buffon calls the Lori; very remarkable for the
 singularity of its figure. This is, of all other animals, the longest, in
 proportion to its size; having nine vertebrae in the loins; whereas other
 quadrupedes have only seven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxvi.
 p. 274.</BIBL></NOTE>. The body appears still the longer, by having no tail.
 In other respects, it resembles those of the maki kind; as well in its
 hands and feet, as in its snout, and in the glossy qualities of its hair.
 It is about the size of a squirrel; and appears to be a tame, harmless
 little ani∣mal.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF THE OPPOSSUM, AND ITS KINDS.</HEAD>
<P>TO these four-handed animals of the an∣cient continent, we may
 add the four-handed <PB N="242" REF="315"/> animals of the new, that use their
 hands like the former, as well as their tails, and that fill up the chasm
 between the monkey tribe and the lower orders of the forest. As the maki kind
 in some measure seem to unite the fox and the monkey in their figure and
 size, so these seem to unite the monkey and the rat. They are all
 less than the former; they have long tails, almost bare of hair; and their
 fur, as well as their shape, seems to place them near the rat kind. Some
 have accordingly ranked them in that class; but their being four-handed, is a
 sufficient reason for placing them in the rear of the monkies.</P>
<P>The first and the most remarkable of this tribe is the
 Oppossum, an animal found both in North and South America, of the size of
 a small cat. The head resembles that of a fox; it has fifty teeth in all;
 but two great ones in the midst, like those of a rat. The eyes are little,
 round, clear, lively, and placed upright; the ears are long, broad, and
 transparent, like those of the rat kind; its tail also encreases the
 similitude, being round, long, a little hairy in the beginning, but quite
 naked towards the end. The fore legs are short, being about three inches
 long; while those behind are about four. The feet are like hands, each having

 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="243" REF="319"/> five
 toes or fingers, with white crooked nails, and rather longer behind than
 before. But it is particular in this animal, that the thumb on the hinder legs
 wants a nail; whereas the fingers are furnished with clawed nails as
 usual.</P>
<P>But that which distinguishes this animal from all others, and
 what has excited the wonder of mankind for more than two centuries, is the
 extraordinary conformation of its belly, as it is found to have a false womb,
 into which the young, when brought forth in the usual manner, creep, and
 continue for some days longer, to lodge and suckle securely. This bag, if
 we may so call it, being one of the most extraor∣dinary things in natural
 history, requires a more minute description. Under the belly of the female
 is a kind of slit or opening, of about three inches long; this opening is
 composed of a skin, which makes a bag internally, which is covered on the
 inside with hair, and in this bag are the teats of the female; and into it
 the young, when brought forth, retire, either to suckle or to escape from
 danger. This bag has a power of opening and shutting, at the will of the
 ani∣mal; and this is performed by means of several muscles, and two bones,
 that are fitted for this purpose, and that are peculiar to this ani∣mal 
 <PB N="244" REF="320"/> only. These two bones are placed before the os pubis,
 to which they are joined at the base; they are about two inches long, and
 grow smaller and smaller to their extremities. These support the
 muscles that serve to open the bag, and give them a fixture To these
 muscles there are antagonists, that serve, in the same manner, to
 shut the bag; and this they perform so ex∣actly, that in the living animal
 the opening can scarce be discerned, except when the sides are forcibly
 drawn asunder. The inside of this bag is furnished with glands, that
 exsude a musky substance, which communicates to the flesh of the
 animal, and renders, it unfit to be eaten. It is not to be supposed that
 this is the place where the young are conceived, as some have been led to
 imagine; for the oppossum has another womb, like that of the generality of
 animals, in which generation is performed in the ordinary manner. The bag we
 have been describing, may rather be considered as a sup∣plemental womb.
 In the real womb, the little animal is partly brought to perfection; in the
 ordinary one, it receives a kind of additional, incubation; and acquires, at
 last, strength enough to follow the dam wherever she goes. We have many
 reasons to suppose that the <PB N="245" REF="321"/> young of this animal
 are all brought forth pre∣maturely, or before they have acquired that degree of
 perfection, which is common in other quadrupedes. The little ones, when first
 produced, are in a manner but half com∣pleted; and some travellers
 assert, that they are, at that time, not much larger than flies. We are
 assured also, that immediately on quitting the real womb, they creep into
 the false one; where they continue fixed to the teat, until they have
 strength sufficient to venture once more into the open air, and share the
 fatigues of the parent. Ulloa assures us, that he has found five of these
 little creatures hidden in the belly of the dam three days after she was
 dead, still alive, and all clinging to the teat with great avidity. It is
 probable, therefore, that upon their first entering the false womb, they
 seldom stir out from thence; but when more advanced, they venture forth
 several times in the day; and, at last, seldom make use of their
 retreat, except in cases of necessity or danger. Travellers are not
 agreed in their accounts of the time which these animals take to continue in
 the false womb; some assure us, they remain there for several weeks;
 and others, more precisely mention a month. During this <PB N="246" REF="322"/> period of strange gestation, there is no dif∣ficulty in opening
 the bag in which they are concealed; they may be reckoned, examined, and
 handled, without much inconvenience; for they keep fixed to the teat, and cling
 there as firm as if they made a part of the body of the animal that bears them.
 When they are grown stronger, they drop from the teat into the bag in which
 they are contained; and, at last, find their way out, in search of more
 copious sub∣sistence. Still, however, the false belly serves them for
 a retreat; either when they want to sleep or to suckle, or when they are
 pursued by an enemy. The dam, on such occasions, opens her bag to receive
 them, which they enter, 
 <Q> 
 <L>—Pars formidine turpi</L> 
 <L>Scandunt rursus equum et nota conduntur in alvo.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Oppossum, when on the ground, is a slow, helpless
 animal; the formation of its hands, are alone sufficient to shew its
 incapacity of running with any degree of swiftness: but, to counterbalance
 this inconvenience, it climbs trees with great ease and expedition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxi. p. 174.</BIBL></NOTE>. It chiefly
 subsists upon birds; and hides among the leaves of the trees, to seize
 them by surprize. It often also hangs by the tail, which is long and 
 <PB N="247" REF="323"/> muscular; and, in this situation, for hours
 to∣gether, with the head downwards, it keeps watching for its prey. If any
 lesser animal, which it is able to overcome, passes underneath, it
 drops upon it with deadly aim, and quickly devours it. By means of its tail,
 the oppossum also slings from one tree to another, hunts in∣sects,
 escapes its pursuers, and provides for its safety. It seems to be a
 creature that lives upon vegetables, as well as animal substances, roots,
 sugar-canes, the bark, and even the leaves of trees. It is easily tamed,
 but it is a disagree∣able domestic, as well from its stupidity and
 figure, as its scent, which, however fragrant in small quantities, fails
 not to be ungrateful when copiously supplied.</P>
<P>An animal greatly resembling the former<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxi. p. 212.</BIBL></NOTE>, is the Marmose,
 which is found in the same continent. It seems only to differ in size,
 be∣ing less; and, instead of a bag to receive its young, has only two
 longitudinal folds near the thighs, within which, the young, which are
 prematurely brought forth, as in the last in∣stance, continue to suckle.
 The young of these, when first produced, are not above the size of a
 bean; but continue sticking to the <PB N="248" REF="324"/> teat, until they
 have arrived at greater matu∣rity.</P>
<P>The Cayopolin is somewhat larger than the former; and a good
 deal resembling it in habits and figure, except that its snout is more
 pointed, its tail longer in proportion, and its colour different, being of an
 ash, somewhat inclining to yellow; however, I should suppose it to be
 only a variety of the former.</P>
<P>To this number we may add the Phalanger, so called by Mr.
 Buffon; a good deal resembling the former, but distinguished by the
 fashion of its hinder hands: the thumb and the fore finger being joined
 together, except at the extremities. This animal is about the size of a rat;
 and has, accordingly, by some, been called the Rat of Surinam.</P>
<P>The last animal of this class is called, by Mr. Buffon, the
 Tarsier. This extraordinary little animal resembles the former, in having
 four hands, and a long tail; but it differs very much in the extreme length of
 its hinder legs, which are longer than the rest of its whole body. The bones
 of that part of the foot called the Tarsus, are likewise so very long,
 that from thence the animal has received its name: the tail is naked in the
 middle, and hairy only at both extre∣mities: <PB REF="325"/>

 deep ash colour. As to the rest, it is unknown from what country this
 animal was brought; but the naturalist from whom we have its description,
 supposes it to be a native of America.</P>
<P>From this general description of four-handed animals, we
 perceive what few advantages the brute creation derive from those organs
 that, in man, are employed to so many great and useful purposes. The
 being able to pluck their food from the trees, the capacity of clinging among
 the branches, or at most of converting one of those branches into a weapon
 of offence, are the highest stretches of their sagacity, and the only
 use their hands have hitherto been em∣ployed in: and yet, some
 superficial men have asserted, that the hands alone are sufficient to
 vindicate the dominion of mankind over other animals; and that much of his
 boasted reason, is nothing more than the result of his happier
 conformation: however, were this so, an ape or a monkey would in some
 instances be more ra∣tional than we; their fingers are smaller, and, in
 some of them, more finely formed than ours. To what a variety of purposes
 might they not be employed, if their powers were properly ex∣erted! Those
 works which we, from the large∣ness <PB N="250" REF="330"/> of our fingers,
 are obliged to go clumsily about, one of these could very easily perform
 with the utmost exactness; and if the fineness of the hand assisted
 reason, an ape would be one of the most reasonable beings in the
 creation. But these admirably formed machines, are almost useless both
 to mankind and themselves; and contribute little more to the happiness of
 animal life, than the paws of the lowest qua∣drupede. They are supplied,
 indeed, with the organs; but they want the mind, to put them into action: it is
 that reasoning principle alone, with which man has been endowed, that can
 adapt seemingly opposite causes, to concur in the same general
 design; and even where the organs are deficient, that can supply their
 place, by the intervention of assisting instruments. Where reason
 prevails, we find that it scarcely matters what the organs are that give it
 the di∣rection; the being furnished with that principle, still goes
 forward, steadily and uniformly suc∣cessful; breaks through every
 obstacle, and becomes master of every enterprize. I have seen a man,
 without hands or legs, convert, by practice, his very stumps to the most
 conve∣nient purposes; and with these clumsy instru∣ments, perform the
 most astonishing feats of <PB N="251" REF="331"/> dexterity. We may
 therefore, conclude, that it is the mind alone that gives a master to the
 creation; and that, if a bear or an horse were endowed with the same
 intelects that have been given to man, the hardness of an hoof, or the
 aukwardness of a paw, would be no obstacle to their advancement in the arts
 of dominion, or of social felicity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of the Elephant.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING gone through the description of those quadrupedes that,
 by resembling each other in some striking particular, admit of being
 grouped together and considered under one point of view, we now come to
 those insulated sorts that bear no similitude with the rest, and that
 to be distinctly described must be separately con∣sidered.</P>
<P>The foremost of these, and in every respect the noblest
 quadrupede in nature, is the ele∣phant, not less remarkable for its size

 the character of the most saga∣cious animal next to man; and yet, were we
 to take our idea of its capacity from its outward appearance, we should be
 led to conceive very meanly of its abilities. The elephant, at first view,
 presents the spectator with an enormous mass of flesh that seems
 scarcely animated. Its huge body, covered with a callous hide, with∣out hair;
 its large mis-shapen legs, that seem scarcely formed for motion; its
 little eyes, large ears, and long trunk; all give it an air of ex∣treme
 stupidity. But our prejudices will soon <PB REF="333"/>

 from so clumsy a conformation.</P>
<P>The elephant is seen from seven to no less than fifteen feet
 high. Whatever care we take to imagine a large animal beforehand, yet the
 first sight of this huge creature never fails to strike us with
 astonishment, and in some measure to exceed our idea. Having been
 used to smaller animals, we have scarce any conception of its magnitude;
 for a moving column of flesh, four∣teen feet high, is an object so utterly
 different from those we are constantly presented with, that to be
 conceived it must be actually seen. Such, I own, were the suggestions
 that natu∣rally arose to me when I first saw this animal, and yet for the
 sight of which I had taken care to prepare my imagination. I found my ideas
 fall as short of its real size as they did of its real figure; neither the
 pictures I had seen, nor the descriptions I had read, giving me adequate
 conceptions of either.</P>
<P>It would, therefore, be impossible to give an idea of this
 animal's figure by a description; which, even assisted by the art of
 the engraver, will but confusedly represent the original. In general it may
 be observed, that the forehead is <PB N="254" REF="337"/> very high and
 rising, the ears very large and dependant, the eyes extremely small, the
 pro∣boscis, or trunk, long, the body round and full, the back rising in an
 arch, and the whole ani∣mal short in proportion to its height. The feet are
 round at the bottom; on each foot there are five flat horny risings, which
 seem to be the ex∣tremities of the toes, but do not appear out∣wardly. The
 hide is without hair, full of scratches and scars, which it receives in its
 pas∣sage through thick woods and thorny places. At the end of the tail
 there is a tuft of hair, a foot and a half long. The female is less than the
 male, and the udder is between the fore∣legs. But a more accurate, as well as a
 more entertaining description of the parts, will natu∣rally occur in the
 history of their uses.</P>
<P>Of all quadrupedes, the elephant is the strongest, as well as
 the largest; and yet, in a state of nature, it is neither fierce nor
 for∣midable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have extracted the greatest part of
 this description from Mr. Buffon. Where I add, I mark with commas,
 "thus."</NOTE>. Mild, peaceful, and brave, it never abuses its power or its
 strength, and only uses its force for its own protection, or that of its
 community. In its native desarts, the elephant is seldom seen alone, but
 appears to be a social <PB N="255" REF="338"/> friendly creature. The oldest
 of the company conducts the band; that which is next in se∣niority brings up
 the rear. The young, the weak, and the sickly, fall into the center; while
 the females carry their young, and keep them from falling by means of their
 trunks. They maintain this order only in dangerous marches, or when they
 desire to feed in cultivated grounds; they move with less precaution in the
 forests and solitudes; but without ever separat∣ing, or removing so far
 asunder as to be in∣capable of lending each other any requisite
 as∣sistance. Nothing can be more formidable than a drove of elephants as
 they appear at a distance in an African landscape; wherever they march, the
 forest seems to fail before them; in their passage, they bear down the
 branches upon which they feed; and, if they enter into an inclosure, they
 destroy all the labours of the husbandman in a very short time. Their
 in∣vasions are the more disagreeable as there is no means of repelling
 them; since it would require a small army to attack the whole drove when
 united. It now and then happens that one or two is found lingering behind the
 rest, and it is against these that the art and force of the hunters are
 united; but an attempt to molest the whole body would certainly be fatal.
 They <PB N="256" REF="339"/> go forward directly against him who offers the
 insult, strike him with their tusks, seize him with their trunks, fling
 him into the air, and then trample him to pieces under their feet. But they are
 thus dreadful only when offended, and do no manner of personal injury when
 suf∣fered to feed without interruption. It is even said that they are
 mindful of injuries received; and, when once molested by man, seek all
 oc∣casions for the future to be revenged; they smell him with their long
 trunks at a distance; follow him with all their speed upon the scent;
 and, though slow to appearance, they are soon able to come up with and
 destroy him.</P>
<P>In their natural state, they delight to live along the sides of
 rivers, to keep in the deepest vales, to refresh themselves in the most
 shady forests and watery places. They cannot live far from the water; and
 they always disturb it before they drink. They often fill their trunk with
 it, either to cool that organ, or to divert themselves by spurting it out
 like a fountain. They are equally distressed by the extremes of heat and
 cold; and, to avoid the former, they frequently take shelter in the most
 obscure re∣cesses of the forest, or often plunge into the water, and
 even swim from the continent into islands some leagues distant from the
 shore.</P>

<P><PB N="257" REF="342"/>Their chief food is of the vegetable kind, for
 they loath all kind of animal diet. When one among their number happens to
 light upon a spot of good pasture, he calls the rest, and in∣vites them
 to share in the entertainment; but it must be a very copious pasture
 indeed that can supply the necessities of the whole band. As with their
 broad and heavy feet they sink deep wherever they go, they destroy much
 more than they devour; so that they are fre∣quently obliged to change their
 quarters, and to migrate from one country to another. The Indians and Negroes,
 who are often incom∣moded by such visitants, do all they can to keep them
 away, making loud noises, and large fires round their cultivated grounds; but
 these precautions do not always succeed; the ele∣phants often break through
 their fences, destroy their whole harvest, and overturn their little
 habitations. When they have satisfied them∣selves, and trod down or
 devoured whatever lay in their way, they then retreat into the woods in the
 same orderly manner in which they made their irruption.</P>
<P>Such are the habits of this animal considered in a social light;
 and, if we regard it as an in∣dividual, we shall find its powers still more
 ex∣traordinary. With a very aukward appearance, <PB REF="343"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="257" REF="344"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="258" REF="345"/> it
 possesses all the senses in great perfection, and is capable of
 applying them to more useful purposes than any other quadrupede. The
 elephant, as we observed, has very small eyes, when compared to the
 enormous bulk of its body. But, though their minuteness may at first
 sight appear deformed, yet, when we come to examine them, they are seen to
 exhibit a va∣riety of expression, and to discover the various
 sensations with which it is moved. It turns them with attention and
 friendship to its master; it seems to reflect and deliberate; and as its
 pas∣sions slowly succed each other, their various workings are
 distinctly seen.</P>
<P>The elephant is not less remarkable for the excellence of its
 hearing. Its ears are extremely large, and greater in proportion than even
 those of an ass. They are usually dependent; but it can readily raise
 and move them. They serve also to wipe its eyes, and to protect them
 against the dust and flies that might otherwise incom∣mode them. It
 appears delighted with music, and very readily learns to beat time, to move
 in measure, and even to join its voice to the sound of the drum and the
 trumpet.</P>
<P>This animal's sense of smelling is not only exquisite, but
 it is in a great measure pleased with the same odours that delight
 mankind. <PB N="259" REF="346"/> The elephant gathers flowers with great
 plea∣sure and attention; it picks them up one by one, unites them into a
 nosegay, and seems charmed with the perfume. The orange flower seems to
 be particularly grateful both to its sense of taste and smelling; it
 strips the tree of all its verdure, and eats every part of it, even to the
 branches themselves. It seeks in the meadows the most odoriferous plants
 to feed upon; and in the woods it prefers the coco, the banana, the palm, and
 the sago tree, to all others. As the shoots of these are tender and
 filled with pith; it eats not only the leaves and the fruits, but even the
 branches, the trunk, and the whole plant to the very roots.</P>
<P>But it is in the sense of touching that this animal excels all
 others of the brute creation, and perhaps even man himself. The organ of this
 sense lies wholly in the trunk, which is an instrument peculiar to this
 animal, and that serves it for all the purposes of an hand. The trunk is,
 properly speaking, only the snout lengthened out to a great extent, hollow
 like a pipe, and ending in two openings, or nostrils, like those of an hog.
 An elephant of fourteen feet high has the trunk about eight feet long and five
 feet and an half in circumference at the mouth, where it is thickest. It is
 hollow <PB N="260" REF="347"/> all along, but with a partition running from one
 end of it to the other; so that though out∣wardly it appears like a single
 pipe, it is in∣wardly divided into two. This fleshy tube is composed of
 nerves and muscles, covered with a proper skin of a blackish colour, like
 that of the rest of the body. It is capable of being moved in every
 direction, of being lengthened and shortened, of being bent or
 streightened, so pliant as to embrace any body it is applied to, and yet
 so strong that nothing can be torn from the gripe. To aid the force of this
 grasp, there are several little eminences, like a cater∣pillar's feet, on
 the underside of this instrument, which without doubt contribute to the
 sen∣sibility of the touch as well as to the firmness of the hold. Through
 this trunk the animal breathes, drinks, and smells, as through a tube; and at
 the very point of it, just above the nostrils, there is an extension of
 the skin, about five inches long, in the form of a finger, and which in fact
 answers all the purposes of one; for, with the rest of the extremity of
 the trunk, it is capable of assuming different forms at will, and
 consequently of being adapted to the mi∣nutest objects. By means of this,
 the elephant can take a pin from the ground, untie the knots of a rope, unlock
 a door, and even write with <PB N="261" REF="348"/> a pen. 
 <Q REND="inline">"I have myself seen," says Aelian, "an
 elephant writing Latin characters on a board, in a very orderly manner, his
 keeper only shew∣ing him the figure of each letter. While thus employed, the
 eyes might be observed studiously cast down upon the writing, and
 exhibiting an appearance of great skill and erudition."</Q> It sometimes
 happens that the object is too large for the trunk to grasp; in such a
 case the ele∣phant makes use of another expedient as ad∣mirable as any of
 the former. It applies the extremity of the trunk to the surface of the
 object, and, sucking up its breath, lifts and sustains such a weight as
 the air in that case is capable of keeping suspended. In this manner this
 instrument is useful in most of the purposes of life; it is an organ of
 smelling, of touching, and of suction; it not only provides for the
 animal's necessities and comforts, but it also serves for its ornament
 and defence.</P>
<P>But, though the elephant be thus admirably supplied by its trunk,
 yet, with respect to the rest of its conformation, it is unwieldy and
 help∣less. The neck is so short that it can scarce turn the head, and
 must wheel round in order to discover an enemy from behind. The hun∣ters
 that attack it upon that quarter, generally thus escape the effects of its
 indignation; and <PB N="262" REF="349"/> find time to renew their assaults
 while the ele∣phant is turning to face them The legs are, indeed, not so
 inflexible as the neck, yet they are very stiff and bend not without
 difficulty. Those before seem to be longer than the hinder; but, upon being
 measured, are found to be something shorter. The joints, by which they
 bend, are nearly in the middle, like the knee of a man; and the great bulk
 which they are to support makes their flexure ungainly. While the elephant is
 young, it bends the legs to lie down or to rise; but when it grows old, or
 sickly, this is not performed without human as∣sistance; and it
 becomes, consequently, so incon∣venient, that the animal chuses to
 sleep stand∣ing. The feet, upon which these massy co∣lumns are
 supported; form a base scarce broader than the legs they sustain.
 They are divided into five toes, which are covered beneath the skin, and none
 of which appear to the eye; a kind of protuberance like claws are only
 ob∣served, which vary in number from three to five. The apparent claws vary;
 the internal toes are constantly the same. The soal of the foot is
 furnished with a skin as thick and hard as horn, and which completely
 covers the whole under part of the foot.</P>
<P>To the rest of the elephant's incumbrances may 
 <PB N="263" REF="350"/> be added its enormous tusks, which are
 unser∣viceable for chewing, and are only weapons of defence. These, as the
 animal grows old, become so heavy, that it is sometimes obliged to make
 holes in the walls of its stall to rest them in, and ease itself of the
 fatigue of their support. It is well known to what an amazing size these
 tusks grow; they are two in number, proceeding from the upper jaw, and are
 sometimes found above six feet long. Some have supposed them to be
 rather the horns than the teeth of this animal; but, besides their greater
 similitude to bone than to horn, they have been indisputably found to grow
 from the upper jaw, and not from the frontal bones, as some have thought
 proper to assert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Daubenton's description
 of the skeleton of this animal.</NOTE>. Some also have asserted, that
 these tusks are shed in the same manner as the stag sheds its
 horns; but it is very probable, from their solid consistence, and from
 their accidental defects, which often appears to be the effect of a slow
 decay, that they are as fixt as the teeth of other animals are generally found
 to be. Cer∣tain it is that the elephant never sheds them in a domestic
 state, but keeps them till they be∣come inconvenient and cumbrous to the
 last degree. An account of uses to which these <PB N="264" REF="351"/>
 teeth are applied, and the manner of chusing the best ivory, belongs rather
 to an history of the arts than of nature.</P>
<P>This animal is equally singular in other parts of its
 conformation; the lips and the tongue in other creatures serve to suck up
 and direct their drink or their food; but in the elephant they are totally
 inconvenient for such purposes; and it not only gathers its food with its
 trunk, but sup∣plies itself with water by the same means. When it eats
 hay, as I have seen it frequently, it takes up a small wisp of it with
 the trunk, turns and shapes it with that instrument for some time, and
 then directs it into the mouth, where it is chewed by the great grinding teeth,
 that are large in proportion to the bulk of the animal. This pacquet, when
 chewed, is swallowed, and never ruminated again as in cows or sheep, the
 stomach and intestines of this creature more re∣sembling those of an
 horse. Its manner of drinking is equally extraordinary. For this purpose,
 the elephant dips the end of its trunk into the water, and sucks up just as
 much as fills that great fleshy tube compleatly. It then lifts up its head
 with the trunk full, and turning the point into its mouth, as if it intended to
 swallow trunk and all, it drives the point below the opening of the
 wind-pipe. The trunk being <PB N="265" REF="352"/> in this position and
 still full of water, the ele∣phant then blows strongly into it at the other
 end, which forces the water it contains into the throat, down which it is heard
 to pour with a loud gurgling noise, which continues till the whole is blown
 down. From this manner of drinking, some have been led into an opinion that
 the young elephant sucks with its trunk and not with its mouth; this,
 however, is a fact which no traveller has hitherto had an op∣portunity of
 seeing, and it must be referred to some future accident to determine.</P>
<P>The hide of the elephant is as remarkable as any other part. It is
 not covered over with hair as in the generality of quadrupedes, but is nearly
 bare. Here and there indeed, a few bristles are seen growing in the scars
 and wrinkles of the body, and very thinly scattered over the rest of the
 skin; but in general the head is dry, rough, and wrinkled, and resembling
 more the bark of an old tree than the skin of an animal. This grows thicker
 every year; and, by a constant addition of substance, it at length
 contracts that disorder well known by the name of the ele∣phantiasis, or
 Arabian leprosy; a disease to which man, as well as the elephant, is
 often subject. In order to prevent this, the Indians rub the elephant with
 oil, and frequently bathe <PB N="266" REF="353"/> it to preserve its pliancy.
 To the inconve∣niences of this disorder is added another, arising from the
 great sensibility of those parts that are not callous. Upon these the
 flies settle in great abundance, and torment this animal unceas∣ingly; to
 remedy which, the elephant tries all its arts; uses not only its tail and
 trunk in the natural manner to keep them off, but even takes the branch of a
 tree, or a bundle of hay, to strike them off with. When this fails, it often
 gathers up the dust with its trunk, and thus covers all the sensible
 places. In this man∣ner it has been seen to dust itself several times a
 day, and particularly upon leaving the bath.</P>
<P>Water is as necessary to this animal as food itself. When in a
 state of nature, the elephant rarely quits the banks of the river, and often
 stands in water up to the belly. In a state of servitude, the Indians
 take equal care to pro∣vide a proper supply; they wash it with great
 address; they give it all the conveniences for lending assistance to
 itself; they smooth the skin with a pumice stone, and then rub it over
 with oils, essences, and odours.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondered at that an animal furnished with so
 many various advantages, both of strength, sagacity, and obedience,
 should be taken into the service of man. We accord∣ingly 
 <PB N="267" REF="354"/> find that the elephant, from time immemo∣rial, has been
 employed either for the purposes of labour, of war, or of ostentation; to
 encrease the grandeur of eastern princes, or to extend their dominions. We
 have hitherto been describing this animal in its natural state; we now come
 to consider it in a different view, as taken from the forest and reduced to
 human obedience. We are now to behold this brave harmless crea∣ture as
 learning a lesson from mankind, and in∣structed by him in all the arts of
 war, massacre, and devastation. We are now to behold this half
 reasoning animal led into the field of battle, and wondering at those
 tumults and that madness which he is compelled to encrease. The elephant is
 a native of Africa and Asia, being found neither in Europe nor America. In
 Africa he still retains his natural liberty. The savage inhabitants of that
 part of the world, instead of attempting to subdue this powerful creature
 to their necessities, are happy in being able to protect themselves from
 his fary. For∣merly, indeed, during the splendour of the Carthaginian empire,
 elephants were used in their wars; but this was only a transitory gleam of
 human power in that part of the globe; the natives of Africa have long since
 degenerated, and the elephant is only known among them <PB N="268" REF="355"/>
 from his devastations. However, there are no elephants in the northern parts
 of Africa at present, there being none found on this side of Mount Atlas.
 It is beyond the river Senegal that they are to be met with in great numbers,
 and so down to the Cape of Good Hope, as well as in the heart of the country.
 In this extensive region they appear to be more numerous than in any other
 part of the world. They are there less fearful of man; less retired into
 the heart of the forests, they seem to be sensible of his im∣potence
 and ignorance; and often come down to ravage his little labours. They treat him
 with the same haughty disdain which they shew to other animals, and
 consider him as a mis∣chievous little being, that fears to oppose them
 openly.</P>
<P>But, although these animals are most plentiful in Africa, it is
 only in Asia that the greatest elephants are found, and rendered
 subservient to human command. In Africa, the largest do not exceed ten
 feet high; in Asia they are found from ten to fifteen. Their price
 en∣creases in proportion to their size; and when they exceed a certain
 bulk, like jewels, their value then rises as the fancy is pleased to
 estimate.</P>
<P>The largest are entirely kept for the service 
 <PB N="269" REF="256"/> of princes; and are maintained with the utmost
 magnificence, and at the greatest expence. The usual colour of the elephant
 is a dusky black, but some are said to be white; and the price of one of
 these is inestimable. Such a one is peculiarly appropriated for the
 monarch's own riding; he is kept in a palace, attended by the nobles, and
 almost adored by the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>P. Vincent
 Marie.</BIBL></NOTE>. Some have said that these white elephants are larger
 than the rest<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>P. Tachard.</BIBL></NOTE>;
 others assert, that they are less; and still others entirely doubt
 their existence.</P>
<P>As the art of war is but very little improved in Asia, there are
 few princes of the east who do not procure and maintain as many elephants as
 they are able, and place great confidence on their assistance in an
 engagement. For this purpose, they are obliged to take them wild in their
 native forests, and tame them; for the ele∣phant never breeds in a state of
 servitude. It is one of the most striking peculiarities in this
 extraordinary creature, that his generative pow∣ers totally fail when he comes
 under the dominion of man; as if he seemed unwilling to propagate a race of
 slaves, to encrease the pride of his con∣queror. There is, perhaps, no
 other quadrupede that will not breed in its own native climate, if 
 <PB N="270" REF="357"/> indulged with a moderate share of freedom; and we
 know, that many of them will copulate in every climate. The elephant alone has
 never been seen to breed; and though he has been re∣duced under the obedience
 of man for ages, the duration of pregnancy, in the female<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
 <Q>Multis persuasum est Elephantem non brutorum sed hominum

 secret. Aristotle, indeed, asserts, that she goes two years with
 young; that she con∣tinues to suckle her young for three years, and that
 she brings forth but one at a time: but he does not inform us of the manner
 in which it was possible for him to have his information. From authorities
 equally doubtful, we learn, that the little one is about as large as a wild
 boar, the instant it is brought forth; that its tusks do not yet appear;
 but that all the rest of its teeth are apparent; that, at the age of six
 months, it is as large as an ox, and its tusks pretty well grown; and that it
 continues, in this manner, for near thirty years, advancing to maturity. All
 this is doubtful; but it is certain, that, in <PB N="271" REF="358"/> order to
 recruit the numbers which are con∣sumed in war, the princes of the east are
 every year obliged to send into the forests, and to use various methods
 to procure a fresh supply. Of all these numerous bands, there is not one
 that has not been originally wild; nor one that has not been forced into a
 state of subjection. Men themselves are often content to propagate a race
 of slaves, that pass down in this wretched state through successive
 generations; but the elephant, under subjection, is unalterably bar∣ren;
 perhaps from some physical causes, which are as yet unknown.</P>
<P>The Indian princes having vainly endea∣voured to multiply the breed
 of elephants, like that of other animals, have been, at last, con∣tent to
 separate the males from the females, to prevent those accesses of
 desire, which debilitated, without multiplying the species. In order to
 take them wild in the woods, a spot of ground is fixed upon, which is
 surrounded with a strong pallisade. This is made of the thickest and
 the strongest trees; and strengthened by cross bars, which give
 firmness to the whole. The posts are fixed at such distances from each
 other, that a man can easily pass between them; there being only one great
 passage left open, through which an elephant can easily come; and 
 <PB N="272" REF="359"/> which is so contrived as to shut behind, as soon
 as the beast is entered. To draw him into this enclosure, it is
 necessary first to find him out in the woods; and a female elephant is
 conducted along into the heart of the forest, where it is obliged by its
 keeper to cry out for the male. The male very readily answers the cry, and
 hastens to join her; which the keeper per∣ceiving, obliges her to retreat,
 still repeating the same cry, until she leads the animal into the
 enclosure already described, which shuts the moment he is entered. Still,
 however, the female proceeds calling, and inviting, while the male proceeds
 forward in the enclosure, which grows narrower all the way, and until the
 poor animal finds himself completely shut up, without the power of either
 advancing or retreating; the female, in the mean time, being let out by a
 private way, which she has been previously accustomed to. The wild
 elephant, upon seeing himself entrapped in this manner, instantly
 attempts to use violence; and, upon seeing the hunters, all his former
 desires only turn to fury. In the mean time, the hunters, having fixed him
 with cords, attempt to soften his indignation, by throwing buckets of water
 upon him in great quantities, rubbing the body with leaves, and pouring oil
 down his ears. Soon <PB N="273" REF="360"/> after, two tame elephants are
 brought, a male and a female, that caress the indignant animal with their
 trunks; while they still continue pouring water to refresh it. At last, a
 tame elephant is brought forward, of that number which is employed in
 instructing the new comers, and an officer riding upon it, in order to shew
 the late captive that it has nothing to fear. The hunters then open the
 enclosure; and, while this creature leads the captive along, two more are
 joined on either side of it, and these compel it to submit. It is then
 tied by cords to a massy pillar provided for that purpose, and suffered
 to remain in that position for about a day and a night, until its indignation
 be wholly subsided. The next day it begins to be somewhat
 submissive; and, in a fortnight, is completely tamed like the rest. The
 females are taken when accompanying the males; they often come into these
 enclosures, and they shortly after serve as decoys to the rest. But
 this method of taking the elephant, differs, according to the abilities of the
 hunter; the Negroes of Africa, who hunt this animal merely for its flesh, are
 content to take it in pit∣falls; and often to pursue it in the defiles of a
 mountain, where it cannot easily turn, and so wound it from behind till it
 falls.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="361"/>The elephant, when once tamed, becomes the
 most gentle and obedient of all animals. It soon conceives an attachment
 for the person that attends it, caresses him, obeys him, and seems to
 anticipate his desires. In a short time it begins to comprehend several
 of the signs made to it, and even the different sounds of the voice; it
 perfectly distinguishes the tone of command from that of anger or
 approbation, and it acts accordingly. It is seldom deceived in its master's
 voice; it receives his orders with attention, and executes them with prudence,
 eagerly, yet without precipitation. All its mo∣tions are regulated; and its
 actions seem to par∣take of its magnitude; being grave, majestic, and
 secure. It is quickly taught to kneel down, to receive its rider; it
 caresses those it knows with its trunk; with this salutes such as it
 is ordered to distinguish, and with this, as with an hand, helps to take up
 a part of its load. It suffers itself to be arrayed in harness; and
 seems to take a pleasure in the finery of its trappings. It draws either
 chariots, cannon, or shipping, with surprizing strength and
 perseverance; and this with a seeming satisfaction, provided that it be
 not beaten without a cause, and that its master appears pleased with its
 exertions.</P>
<P>The elephant's conductor is usually mounted <PB N="275" REF="362"/>
 upon its neck, and makes use of a rod of iron to guide it, which is
 sometimes pointed, and at others bent into a hook. With this the animal is
 spurred forward, when dull or dis∣obedient; but, in general, a word is
 sufficient to put the gentle creature into motion, espe∣cially when it is
 acquainted with its conductor. This acquaintance is often perfectly
 necessary; for the elephant frequently takes such an af∣fection to its
 keeper, that it will obey no other: and it has been known to die for grief,
 when, in some sudden fit of madness, it has killed its conductor. We are
 told, that one of these, that was used by the French forces in India for
 the drawing their cannon, was promised, by the conductor, a reward, for
 having per∣formed some painful service; but being disap∣pointed of its
 expectations, it slew him in a fury. The conductor's wife, who was a
 spec∣tator of this shocking scene, could not restrain her madness and
 despair; but running with her two children in her arms, threw them at the
 elephant's feet, crying out, that since it had killed her husband, it might
 kill her and her children also. The elephant, seeing the child∣ren at its
 feet, instantly stopped, and mode∣rating its fury, took up the eldest
 with its trunk, and placing him upon its neck, adopted <PB N="276" REF="363"/>
 him for its conductor, and obeyed him ever after with great punctuality.</P>
<P>But it is not for drawing burthens alone, that the elephants are
 serviceable in war; they are often brought into the ranks, and compelled to
 fight in the most dangerous parts of the field of battle. There was a time,
 indeed, in India, when they were much more used in war than at present. A
 century or two ago, a great part of the dependance of the general, was upon the
 number and the expertness of his elephants; but of late, since war has been
 contented to adopt fatal instead of formidable arts, the elephant is little
 used, except for drawing cannon, or transporting provisions. The princes
 of the country are pleased to keep a few for orna∣ment, or for the purposes
 of removing their seraglios: but they are seldom led into a field of
 battle, where they are unable to withstand the discharge of fire-arms, and
 have been often found to turn upon their employers. Still, however, they are
 used in war, in the more re∣mote parts of the east; in Siam, in Cochin
 China, in Tonquin, and Pegu. In all these places, they not only serve to
 swell the pomp of state, being adorned with all the barbarian splendour
 that those countries can bestow, but they are actually led into the field
 of battle, <PB N="277" REF="364"/> armed before with coats of mail, and loaded
 on the back each with a square tower, contain∣ing from five combatants to
 seven. Upon its neck sits the conductor, who goads the animal into the
 thickest ranks, and encourages it to encrease the devastation: wherever
 it goes, nothing can withstand its fury; it lev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s the ranks with its immense bulk, flings such as
 op∣pose it into the air, or crushes them to death under its feet. In the
 mean time, those who are placed upon its back, combat as from an emi∣nence,
 and fling down their weapons with double force, their weight being added to
 their ve∣locity. Nothing, therefore, can be more dread∣ful, or more
 irresistible, than such a moving machine, to men unacquainted with the
 modern arts of war; the elephant, thus armed and con∣ducted, raging in the
 midst of a field of battle, inspires more terror than even those machines
 that destroy at a distance, and are often most fatal, when most
 unseen. But this method of combating, is rather formidable than effectual:
 polished nations have ever been victorious over those semi-barbarous
 troops that have called in the elephant to their assistance, or attempted
 to gain a victory by merely astonishing their op∣posers. The Romans
 quickly learned the art of opening their ranks, to admit the elephant; 
 <PB N="278" REF="365"/> and thus separating it from assistance, quickly
 compelled its conductors to calm the animal's fury, and to submit. It
 sometimes also hap∣pened that the elephant became impatient of control;
 and, instead of obeying its conductor, turned upon those forces it was
 employed to assist. In either case, there was a great deal of
 preparation to very little effect; for a single elephant is known to
 consume as much as forty men in a day.</P>
<P>At present, therefore, they are chiefly employed in carrying or
 drawing burthens, throughout the whole Peninsula of India; and no animal can
 be more fitted by nature for this employment. The strength of an elephant is
 equal to its bulk, for it can, with great ease, draw a load that six
 horses could not remove: it can readily carry upon its back three or four
 thousand weight; upon its tusks alone it can support near a thousand:
 its force may also be estimated from the velocity of its motion, compared
 to the mass of its body. It can go, in its ordinary pace, as fast as an
 horse at an easy trot; and, when pushed, it can move as swiftly as an
 horse at full gallop. It can travel with ease fifty or sixty miles a day;
 and when hard pressed, almost double that quantity. It may be heard
 trotting on at a great distance; it <PB N="279" REF="366"/> is easy also
 to follow it by the track, which is deeply impressed on the ground, and
 from fifteen to eighteen inches in diameter.</P>
<P>In India they are also put to other very dis∣agreeable offices;
 for in some courts of the more barbarous princes, they are used as
 execu∣tioners; and this horrid task they perform with great dexterity: with
 their trunks they are seen to break every limb of the criminal at the word of
 command; they sometimes trample him to death, and sometimes impale him on
 their enor∣mous tusks, as directed. In this the elephant is rather the
 servant of a cruel master, than a voluntary tyrant, since no other animal
 of the forest is so naturally benevolent and gentle; equally mindful of
 benefits as sensible of neg∣lect, he contracts a friendship for his
 keeper, and obeys him even beyond his capacity.</P>
<P>In India, where they were at one time em∣ployed in launching
 ships, a particular elephant was directed to force a very large vessel
 into the water: the work proved superior to its strength, but not to its
 endeavours; which, however, the keeper affected to despise. 
 <Q REND="inline">"Take away," says he, "that lazy beast, and
 bring another better fitted for service."</Q> The poor animal instantly
 upon this redoubled its efforts, fractured its scull, and died upon the
 spot.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="367"/>In Deli, an elephant, passing along the
 streets, put his trunk into a taylor's shop, where several people were at
 work. One of the per∣sons of the shop, desirous of some amusement,
 pricked the animal's trunk with his needle, and seemed highly delighted with
 this slight pu∣nishment. The elephant, however, passed on without any
 immediate signs of resentment; but coming to a puddle filled with dirty
 water, he filled his trunk, returned to the shop, and spurted the contents
 over all the finery upon which the taylors were then employed.</P>
<P>An elephant in Adsmeer, which often passed through the bazar
 or market, as he went by a certain herb-woman, always received from her a
 mouthful of greens. Being one day seized with a periodical fit of madness,
 he broke his fetters, and, running through the market, put the crowd to flight;
 and, among others, this woman, who in her haste forgot a little child at her
 stall. The elephant recollecting the spot where his benefactress was
 accustomed to fit, took up the infant gently in his trunk, and conveyed it to
 a place of safety.</P>
<P>At the Cape of Good Hope it is customary to hunt those animals
 for the sake of their teeth. Three horsemen, well mounted, and armed with
 lances, attack the elephant alter∣nately, <PB N="281" REF="368"/> each relieving
 the other, as they see their companion pressed, till the beast is
 sub∣dued. Three Dutchmen, brothers, who had made large fortunes by this
 business, deter∣mined to retire to Europe, and enjoy the fruits of their
 labours; but they resolved, one day be∣fore they went, to have a last
 chace, by way of amusement: they met with their game, and began their attack
 in the usual manner; but, unfortunately, one of their horses falling,
 hap∣pened to fling his rider; the enraged elephant instantly seized the
 unhappy huntsman with his trunk, flung him up to a vast height in the air,
 and received him upon one of his tusks as he fell; and then turning towards
 the other two brothers, as if it were with an aspect of revenge and insult,
 held out to them the impaled wretch, writhing in the agonies of death.</P>
<P>The teeth of the elephant are what produces the great enmity between
 him and mankind; but whether they are shed, like the horns of the deer, or
 whether the animal be killed to obtain them, is not yet perfectly known. All we
 have as yet certain is, that the natives of Africa, from whence almost all
 our ivory comes, assure us, that they find the greatest part of it in
 their forests; nor would, say they, the teeth of an elephant recompence
 them for their trouble <PB N="282" REF="369"/> and danger in killing it:
 notwithstanding, the elephants which are tamed by man, are never known to
 shed their tusks; and from the hard∣ness of their substance, they
 seem no way ana∣logous to deers horns.</P>
<P>The teeth of the elephant are very often found in a fossile
 state. Some years ago, two great grinding-teeth, and part of the tusk of an
 elephant, were discoved, at the depth of forty-two yards, in a lead mine in
 Flintshire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pennant's Synopsis, p.
 90.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The tusks of the Mammouth, so often found fossile in
 Siberia, and which are converted to the purposes of ivory, are generally
 supposed to belong to the elephant: however, the animal must have been
 much larger in that country than it is found at present, as those tusks
 are often known to weigh four hundred pounds; while those that come from
 Africa, seldom ex∣ceed two hundred and fifty. These enormous tusks are
 found lodged in the sandy banks of the Siberian rivers; and the natives
 pretend that they belong to an animal which is four times as large as the
 elephant.</P>
<P>There have lately been discovered several enormous skeletons,
 five or six feet beneath the surface, on the banks of the Ohio, not remote
 from the river Miume in America, seven <PB N="283" REF="370"/> hundred miles
 from the sea-coast. Some of the tusks are near seven feet long; one
 foot nine inches in circumference at the base, and one foot near the point;
 the cavity at the root or base, nineteen inches deep. Besides their size,
 there are yet other differences: the tusks of the true elephant have
 sometimes a very slight la∣teral bend; these have a larger twist, or
 spiral curve, towards the smaller end: but the great and specific
 difference consists in the shape of the grinding-teeth; which, in these
 newly found, are fashioned like the teeth of a carnivorous animal; not flat
 and ribbed transversely on their surface, like those of the modern
 elephant, but furnished with a double row of high and conic processes, as
 if intended to masticate, not to grind their food. A third difference is in
 the thigh bone, which is of a great disproportionable thickness to that of
 the elephant; and has also some other anatomical variations. These
 fossile bones have been also found in Peru and the Brazils; and, when cut
 and polished by the workers in ivory, appear, in every respect, similar.
 It is the opinion of Doctor Hunter that they must have belonged to a larger
 animal than the elephant; and differing from it, in being carnivorous. But as
 yet this formidable <PB N="284" REF="371"/> creature has evaded our search;
 and if, indeed, such an animal exists, it is happy for man that it keeps at
 a distance; since what ravage might not be expected from a creature, endued
 with more than the strength of the elephant, and all the rapacity of the
 tiger!</P>

<P><PB N="285" REF="373"/> NEXT to the elephant, the Rhinoceros is the
 most powerful of animals. It is usually found twelve feet long, from the
 tip of the nose to the insertion of the tail; from six to seven feet
 high; and the circumference of its body is nearly equal to its length. It is,
 there∣fore, equal to the elephant in bulk; and if it appears much smaller to
 the eye, the reason is, that its legs are much shorter. Words can convey
 but a very confused idea of this ani∣mal's shape; and yet there are few
 so remark∣ably formed: its head is furnished with an horn, growing from the
 snout, sometimes three feet and an half long; and but for this, that part
 would have the appearance of the head of an hog; the upper lip, however, is
 much longer in proportion, ends in a point, is very pliable, serves to
 collect its food, and deliver it into the mouth: the ears are large, erect, and
 pointed; the eyes are small and piercing; the skin is naked, rough, knotty,
 and, lying upon the body in folds, after a very peculiar fashion: there are
 two folds very remarkable; one above <PB REF="374"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="285" REF="375"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="286" REF="376"/> the
 shoulders, and another over the rump: the skin, which is of a dirty brown
 colour, is so thick as to turn the edge of a scymitar, and to resist a
 musquet-ball: the belly hangs low; the legs are short, strong and thick,
 and the hoofs divided into three parts, each pointing forward.</P>
<P>Such is the general outline of an animal that appears chiefly
 formidable from the horn grow∣ing from its snout; and formed rather for war,
 than with a propensity to engage. This horn, is sometimes found from three
 to three feet and an half long, growing from the solid bone, and so
 disposed, as to be managed to the greatest advantage. It is composed of
 the most solid substance; and pointed so as to in∣flict the most
 fatal wounds. The elephant, the boar, or the buffalo, are obliged to strike
 trans∣versely with their weapons; but the rhinoceros employs all his force
 with every blow; so that the tiger will more willingly attack any other
 animal of the forest, than one whose strength is so justly employed.
 Indeed, there is no force which this terrible animal has to apprehend:
 defended, on every side, by a thick horny hide, which the claws of the lion
 or the tiger are unable to pierce, and armed before with a weapon that even the
 elephant does not chuse <PB N="287" REF="377"/> to oppose. The
 missioners assure us, that the elephant is often found dead in the
 forests, pierced with the horn of a rhinoceros; and though it looks like
 wisdom to doubt whatever they tell us, yet I cannot help giving credit to
 what they relate on this occasion, particularly when confirmed by Pliny. The
 combat between these two, the most formidable animals of the forest,
 must be very dreadful. Emanuel, king of Portugal, willing to try their
 strength, actually opposed them to each other; and the elephant was
 defeated.</P>
<P>But though the rhinoceros is thus formi∣dable by nature, yet
 imagination has not failed to exert itself, in adding to its terrors. The
 scent is said to be most exquisite; and it is affirmed, that it
 consorts with the tiger. It is reported also, that when it has overturned a
 man, or any other animal, it continues to lick the flesh quite from the bone
 with its tongue, which is said to be extremely rough. All this, however, is
 fabulous: the scent, if we may judge from the expansion of the olfactory
 nerves, is not greater than that of an hog, which we know to be indifferent; it
 keeps company with the tiger, only because they both frequent watery places
 in the burning climates where they are bred; and as to its rough 
 <PB N="288" REF="378"/> tongue, that is so far from the truth, that no animal
 of near its size has so soft a one. 
 <Q REND="inline">"I have often felt it myself," says Ladvocat, in
 his description of this animal; "it is smooth, soft, and small, like
 that of a dog; and to the feel it appears as if one passed the hand over
 velvet. I have often seen it lick a young man's face who kept it; and both
 seemed pleased with the action."</Q></P>
<P>The rhinoceros which was shewn at London in 1739, and described
 by Doctor Parsons, had been sent from Bengal. Though it was very young, not
 being above two years old, yet the charge of his carriage and food from India,
 cost near a thousand pounds. It was fed with rice, sugar, and hay: it was
 daily supplied with seven pounds of rice, mixed with three of sugar,
 di∣vided into three, portions; it was given great quantities of hay and
 grass, which it chiefly preferred; its drink was water, which it took in
 great quantities. It was of a gentle dis∣position, and permitted itself
 to be touched and handled by all visitors, never attempting mischief,
 except when abused, or when hungry; in such a case, there was no method
 of ap∣peasing its fury, but by giving it something to eat. When angry, it
 would jump up against the walls of its room, with great violence; and, 
 <PB N="289" REF="379"/> many efforts to escape, but seldom attempted to
 attack its keeper, and was always submissive to his threats. It had a
 peculiar cry, somewhat a mixture between the grunting of a hog, and the
 bellowing of a calf.</P>
<P>The age of these animals is not well known; it is said by
 some, that they bring forth at three years old, and if we may reason from
 analogy, it is probable they seldom live till above twenty. That which was
 shewn in London, was said by its keeper, to be eighteen years old, and even
 at that age, he pretended to consider it as a young one; however, it died
 shortly after, and that probably in the course of nature.</P>
<P>The Rhinoceros is a native of the desarts of Asia and Africa,
 and is usually found in those extensive forests, that are frequented by
 the elephant and the lion. As it subsists entirely up∣on vegetable food,
 it is peaceful and harmless among its fellows of the brute creation; but,
 though it never provokes to combat, it equally disdains to fly. It is every
 way fitted for war, but rests content in the consciousness of its
 security. It is particularly fond of the prickly branches of trees, and is
 seen to feed upon such thorny shrubs as would be dangerous to other
 animals, either to gather, or to swallow. The prickly points of these,
 however, may only <PB N="290" REF="380"/> serve to give a poignant relish to
 this animal's palate, and may answer the same grateful ends in
 seasoning its banquet, that spices do in heightening ours.</P>
<P>In some parts of the kingdom of Asia, where the natives are more
 desirous of appearing war∣like than shewing themselves brave, these
 ani∣mals are tamed, and led into the field to strike terror into the enemy;
 but they are always an unmanageable and restive animal, and probably more
 dangerous to the employers, than those whom they are brought to oppose.</P>
<P>The method of taking them, is chiefly watching them, till they are
 found either in some moist or marshy place, where, like hogs, they are
 fond of sleeping and wallowing. They then destroy the old one with
 fire-arms, for no weapons, that are thrown by the force of man, are capable of
 entering this animal's hide. If, when the old one is destroyed, there happens
 to be a cub, they seize and tame it: these animals are sometimes taken in
 pit-falls, cover∣ed with green branches, laid in those paths which the
 Rhinoceros makes in going from the forest to the river side.</P>
<P>There are some varieties in this animal, as in most others;
 some of them are found in Africa with a double horn, one growing above 
 <PB N="291" REF="381"/> the other; this weapon, if considered in itself, is
 one of the strongest, and most dangerous, that nature furnishes to any
 part of the animal creation. The horn is entirely solid, formed of the
 hardest bony substance, growing from the upper maxilary bone, by so
 strong an apo∣physe, as seemingly to make but one part with it. Many are
 the medicinal virtues that are ascribed to this horn, when taken in powder,
 but these qualities have been attributed to it, without any real foundation,
 and make only a small part of the many fables which this ex∣traordinary
 animal has given rise to.</P>

<PB N="292" REF="382"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X. The Hippopotamos.</HEAD>
<P>THE hippopotamos is an animal as large, and not less formidable
 than the Rhinoceros; its legs are shorter, and its head rather more bulky
 than that of the animal last described. We have had but few opportunities
 in Europe of examining this formidable creature mi∣nutely, its dimensions,
 however, have been pretty well ascertained, by a description given us by
 Zerenghi, an Italian surgeon, who procured one of them to be killed on the
 banks of the river Nile. By his account it appears, that this terrible animal,
 which chiefly resides in the waters of that river, is above seventeen feet
 long, from the extre∣mity of the snout, to the insertion of the tail; above
 sixteen feet in circumference round the body, and above seven feet high:
 the head is near four feet long, and above nine feet in cir∣cumference. The
 jaws open about two feet wide, and the cutting teeth, of which it hath four in
 each jaw, are above a foot long.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="383"/>Its feet, in some measure, resemble
 those of the elephant, and are divided into four parts. The tail is short,
 flat, and pointed; the hide is amazingly thick, and though not capable of
 turning a musket ball, is impenetrable to the blow of a sabre; the body is
 covered over with a sew scattered hairs, of a whitish colour. The whole
 figure of the animal is something between that of an ox and a hog, and its
 cry is something between the bellowing of the one, and the grunting of the
 other.</P>
<P>This animal, however, though so terribly furnished for war,
 seems no way disposed to make use of it's prodigious strength
 against an equal enemy; itchiefly resides at the bottom of the great rivers
 and lakes of Africa; the Nile, the Niger, and the Zara; there it leads an
 in∣dolent kind of life, and seems seldom disposed for action, except
 when excited by the calls of hunger. Upon such occasions, three or four of
 them are often seen at the bottom of a river, near some cataract, forming a
 kind of line, and seizing upon such fish as are forced down by the
 violence of the stream. In that element they pursue their prey with great
 swiftness and perseverance; they swim with much force, and remain at
 the bottom for thirty or forty minutes without rising to take breath. They
 traverse the <PB N="294" REF="384"/> the bottom of the stream, as if walking
 upon land, and make a terrible devastation where they find plenty of prey.
 But it often happens, that this animal's fishy food is not supplied in
 suffi∣cient abundance, it is then forced to come up∣on land, where it is an
 awkward and unweildy stranger; it moves but slowly, and, as it seldom
 forsakes the margin of the river, it sinks at every step it takes;
 sometimes, however, it is forced, by famine, up into the higher grounds,
 where it commits dreadful havock among the plantations of the helpless
 natives, who see their possessions destroyed, without daring to
 resist their invader. Their chief method is, by lighting fires, striking
 drums, and raising a cry to frighten it back to its favourite element; and,
 as it is extremely timorous upon land, they generally succeed in their
 endeavours. But if they happen to wound, or otherways irritate it too
 closely, it then becomes formid∣able to all that oppose it: it overturns
 what∣ever it meets, and brings forth all its strength, which it seemed not
 to have discovered before that dangerous occasion. It possesses the
 same inoffensive disposition in its favourite element, that it is found
 to have upon land; it is never found to attack the mariners in their boats, as
 they go up or down the stream; but should <PB N="295" REF="385"/> they
 inadvertently strike against it, or otherwise disturb its repose,
 there is much danger of its sending them, at once, to the bottom. 
 <Q REND="inline">"I have seen, says a mariner, as we find it in
 Dampier, one of these animals open its jaws, and seizing any boat between
 his teeth, at once, bite and sink it to the bottom. I have seen it upon
 another occasion, place itself under one of our boats, and rising under
 it, overset it with six men which were in it; who, however, happily
 received no other injury."</Q> Such is the great strength of this animal; and
 from hence, pro∣bably, the imagination has been willing to match it in combat
 against others more fierce and equally formidable. The crocodile and shark
 have been said to engage with it, and yield an easy victory; but as the
 shark is only found at sea, and the hippopotomos never ventures beyond the
 mouth of fresh-water rivers, it is most probable that these engage∣ments
 never occurred; it sometimes happens, indeed, that the princes of Africa
 amuse them∣selves with combats, on their fresh-water lakes, between this
 and other formidable animals; but whether the rhinoceros or the crocodile are
 of this number, we have not been particularly informed. If this animal be
 attacked at land, and finding itself incapable of vengeance from 
 <PB N="296" REF="386"/> the swiftness of its enemy, it immediately returns
 to the river, where it plunges in head foremost, and after a short time
 rises to the surface, loudly bellowing, either to invite or intimidate the
 enemy; but though the negroes will venture to attack the shark, or the
 crocodile, in their natural element, and there destroy them, they are too
 well apprised of the force of the hippo∣potamos to engage it; this animal,
 therefore, continues the uncontrouled master of the river, and all others fly
 from its approach and become an easy prey.</P>
<P>As the hippopotomos lives upon fish and ve∣getables, so it is
 probable the flesh of terrestrial animals may be equally grateful: the
 natives of Africa assert, that it has often been found to devour children
 and other creatures that it was able to surprise upon land; yet it moves
 but slowly, almost every creature, endued with a common share of
 swiftness, is able to escape it; and this animal, therefore, seldom
 ventures from the river side, but when pressed by the necessities of
 hunger, or of bringing forth its young.</P>
<P>The female always comes upon land to bring forth, and it is
 supposed that she seldom pro∣duces above one at a time; upon this
 occasion, these animals are particularly timorous, and 
 <PB N="297" REF="387"/> dread the approach of a terrestrial enemy; the
 instant the parent hears the slightest noise, it dashes into the
 stream, and the young one is seen to follow it with equal alacrity.</P>
<P>The young ones are said to be excellent eat∣ing; but the negroes,
 to whom nothing that has life comes amiss, find an equal delicacy in the old.
 Dr. Pocock has seen their flesh sold in the shambles, like beef; and it
 is said, that their breast, in particular, is as delicate eating as veal.
 As for the rest, these animals are found in great numbers, and as they
 produce very fast, their flesh, might supply the countries where they are
 found, could those barbarous regions produce more expert huntsmen; it may
 be remarked, however, that this creature, which was once in such plenty at
 the mouth of the Nile, is now wholly unknown in Lower Egypt, and is no where to
 be found in that river, except above the cataracts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. The Camelopard.</HEAD>
<P>WERE we to be told of an animal so tall, that a man on horseback
 could with ease ride under its belly, without stooping, we should hardly
 give credit to the relation; yet, of this extraordinary size is the
 camelopard, an animal that inhabits the Desarts of Africa, and the ac∣counts
 of which are so well ascertained, that we cannot deny our assent to
 their authority. It is no easy matter to form an adequate idea of this
 creature's size, and the oddity of its formation. It exhibits somewhat the
 slender shape of the deer, or the camel, but destitute of their
 symme∣try, or their easy power of motion The head somewhat resembles
 that of the deer, with two round horns, near a footlong, and which it is
 pro∣bable, it sheds as deer are found to do; its neck resembles that of a
 horse; its legs and feet, those of the deer; but with this extra∣ordinary
 difference, that the fore legs are near twice as long as the hinder. As these
 creatures <PB REF="389"/>

 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="299" REF="392"/> have
 been found eighteen feet high, and ten from the ground to the top of the
 shoulders, so allowing three feet for the depth of the body seven feet
 remains, which is high enough to admit a man mounted upon a middle sized
 horse. The hinder part, however, is much lower, so that when the animal
 appears stand∣ing, and at rest, it has somewhat the appearance of a dog
 sitting, and this formation of its legs, gives it an awkward and laborious
 motion; which, though swift, must yet be tiresome. For this reason, the
 camelopard is an animal very rarely found, and only finds refuge in the most
 internal desart regions of Africa. The dimen∣sions of a young one, as they
 were accurately taken by a person, who examined its skin, that was brought
 from the Cape of Good Hope, were found to be as follow: the length of the head,
 was one foot eight inches; the height of the fore leg, from the ground to the
 top of the shoulder, was ten feet; from the shoulder, to the top of the
 head, was seven; the height of the hind leg, was eight feet five inches; and
 from the top of the shoulder, to the insertion of the tail, was just
 seven feet long.</P>
<P>No animal, either from its disposition, or its formation,
 seems less fitted for a state of natural <PB N="300" REF="393"/>
 hostility; its horns are blunt, and even knobbed at the ends; its teeth are
 made entirely for vegetable pasture; its skin is beautifully speckled
 with white spots, upon a brownish ground; it is timorous and harmless,
 and not∣withstanding its great size, rather flies from, than resists
 the slightest enemy; it partakes very much of the nature of the camel,
 which it so nearly resembles; it lives entirely upon vegeta∣bles, and when
 grazing, is obliged to spread its fore legs very wide, in order to reach its
 pasture; its motion is a kind of pace, two legs on each side moving at the
 same time, whereas in other animals they move trans∣versely. It often
 lies down with its belly to the earth, and like the camel, has a callous
 sub∣stance upon its breast, which, when reposed, defends it from
 injury. This animal was known to the ancients, but has been very rarely seen
 in Europe. One of them was sent from the East to the Emperor of Germany, in
 the year 1559, but they have often been seen tame at Grand Cairo, in Egypt;
 and I am told, there are two there at present. When ancient Rome was in its
 splendour, Pompey exhibited, at one time, no less than ten, upon the
 theatre. It was the barbarous pleasure of the people, at that 
 <PB N="301" REF="394"/> time, to see the most terrible, and the most
 ex∣traordinary animals produced in combat against each other. The lion, the
 lynx, the tiger, the elephant, the hippopotamos, were all let loose
 promiscuously, and were seen to inflict indiscri∣minate
 destruction.</P>

<P>THESE names do not make two distinct kinds, but are only given to
 a variety of the same animal, which has, however, subsisted time
 immemorial. The principal, and perhaps the only sensible difference, by
 which those two races are distinguished, consists in this, that the
 camel has two bunches upon his back, whereas the dromedary has but one; the
 latter also, is neither so large, nor so strong, as the camel. These
 two races, however, produce with each other, and the mixed breed formed between
 them is considered the best, the most patient, and the most
 indefatigable of all the kind.</P>
<P>Of the two varieties, the dromedary is, by far the most numerous;
 the camel being scarcely found, except in Turkey, and the countries of the
 Levant, while the other is found spread over all the Desarts of Arabia, the
 southern parts of Africa, Persia, Tartary, and a great part of the
 eastern Indies. Thus, the one in∣habits an immense tract of country, the
 other, <PB REF="396"/>

 province; the one inhabits the sultry countries of the Torrid Zone, the other
 delights in a warm, but not a burning climate; neither, however, can
 sub∣sist, or propagate, in the variable climates to∣wards the north, they
 seem formed for those countries, where shrubs are plenty and water
 scarce; where they can travel along the sandy desart, without being
 impeded by rivers, and find food at expected distances; such a country is
 Arabia, and this of all others, seems the most adapted to the support and
 production of this animal.</P>
<P>The camel is the most temperate of all ani∣mals, and it can
 continue to travel several days without drinking. In those vast
 desarts, where the earth is every where dry and sandy, where there are
 neither birds nor beasts, neither insects nor vegetables, where nothing is
 to be seen but hills of sand and heaps of bones, there the camel travels,
 posting forward, without requir∣ing either drink or pasture, and is often
 found six or seven days without any sustenance what∣soever. Its feet
 are formed for travelling upon sand, and utterly unfit for moist or
 marshy places; the inhabitants, therefore, find a most useful
 assistant in this animal, where no other could subsist, and by its
 means, cross those de∣sarts <PB N="204" REF="401"/> with safety, which
 would be unpassable by any other method of conveyance.</P>
<P>An animal, thus formed for a sandy and desart region, cannot be
 propagated in one of a different nature. Many vain efforts have been tried to
 propagate the camel, in Spain; they have been transported into America, but
 have multiplied in neither. It is true, in∣deed, that they may be brought into
 these countries, and may, perhaps, be found to pro∣duce there, but the care
 of keeping them is so great, and the accidents to which they are exposed,
 from the changeableness of the cli∣mate, are so many, that they cannot
 answer the care of keeping. In a few years also, they are seen to
 degenerate; their strength and their patience forsake them; and instead
 of making the riches, they become the burthen of their keepers.</P>
<P>But it is very different in Arabia, and those countries where the
 camel is turned to useful purposes. It is there considered as a sacred
 animal, without whose help, the natives could neither subsist,
 traffick, or travel; its milk makes a part of their nourishment; they feed
 upon its flesh particularly when young; they clothe themselves with its
 hair, which it is seen to molt regularly once a year, and if they fear an 
 <PB N="305" REF="402"/> invading enemy, their camels serve them in flight, and
 in a single day, they are known to travel above an hundred miles. Thus, by
 means of the camel, an Arabian finds safety in his de∣sarts; all the armies
 upon earth might be lost in the pursuit of a flying squadron of this
 country, mounted upon their camels, and taking refuge in solitudes where
 nothing interposes to stop their flight, or to force them to wait the
 in∣vader. Nothing can be more dreary than the aspect of these sandy
 plains, that seem entirely forsaken of life and vegetation: wherever the
 eye turns, nothing is presented but a sterril and dusty soil,
 sometimes torn up by the winds, and moving in great waves along, which, when
 viewed from an eminence, resemble less the earth than the ocean; here and
 there a few shrubs appear that only teach us to wish for the grove that
 remind us of the shade in these sultry climates, without affording its
 re∣freshment; the return of morning, which, in other places, carries an idea
 of chearfulness here serves only to enlighten the endless and dreary
 waste, and to present the tra∣veller with an unfinished prospect of his
 forlorn situation; yet in this chasm of nature, by the help of the camel,
 the Arabian finds safety and subsistance There are here and there 
 <PB N="306" REF="403"/> found spots of verdure, which, though remote from each
 other, are, in a manner, ap∣proximated by the labour and industry of the
 camel. Thus these desarts, which present the stranger with nothing but
 objects of danger and sterility, afford the inhabitant protection, food, and
 liberty. The Arabian lives independant and tranquil in the midst of his
 solitudes; and, instead of considering the vast solitudes spread
 round him as a restraint upon his happiness, he is, by experience, taught
 to regard them as the ramparts of his freedom.</P>
<P>The camel is easily instructed in the methods of taking up and
 supporting his burthen; their legs, a few days after they are produced, are
 bent under their belly; they are in this manner loaded, and taught to rise;
 their burthen is every day thus encreased, by insensible degrees, till
 the animal is capable of supporting a weight adequate to its force: the
 same care is taken in making them patient of hunger and thirst: while other
 animals receive their food at stated times, the camel is restrained for
 days together, and these intervals of famine are encreased in proportion as
 the animal seems capable of sustain∣ing them. By this method of
 education, they live five or six days without food or water; and their
 stomach is formed most admirably by <PB N="307" REF="404"/> nature, to fit
 them for long abstinence: besides the four stomachs, which all animals
 have, that chew the cud, (and the camel is of the number) it has a fifth
 stomach, which serves as a reservoir, to hold a greater quantity of
 wa∣ter than the animal has an immediate occasion for. It is of a sufficient
 capacity to contain a large quantity of water, where the fluid remains without
 corrupting, or without being adulterat∣ed by the other aliments: when the camel
 finds itself pressed with thirst, it has here an easy resource for
 quenching it; it throws up a quantity of this water by a simple contraction
 of the muscles, into the other stomachs, and this serves to macerate its
 dry and simple food; in this manner, as it drinks but seldom, it takes in a
 large quantity at a time, and travellers, when straightened for water, have
 been often known to kill their camels for that which they expected to find
 within them.</P>
<P>In Turky, Persia, Arabia, Barbary, and Egypt, their whole commerce
 is carried on by means of camels, and no carriage is more speedy, and none
 less expensive in these coun∣tries. Merchants and travellers unite
 them∣selves into a body, furnished with camels, to secure themselves
 from the insults of the rob∣bers that infest the countries in which they 
 <PB N="308" REF="405"/> live. This assemblage is called a caravan, in which
 the numbers are sometimes known to amount to above ten thousand, and the
 num∣ber of camels is often greater than those of the men: each of these
 animals is loaded according to his strength, and he is so sensible of
 it him∣self, that when his burthen is too great, he remains still upon his
 belly, the posture in which he is loaden, refusing to rise, till his
 burthen be lessened or taken away. In general, the large camels are capable
 of carrying a thousand weight, and sometimes twelve hun∣dred; the dromedary
 from six to seven. In these trading journies, they travel but slowly,
 their stages are generally regulated, and they seldom go above thirty, or
 at most about five and thirty miles a day. Every evening, when they arrive at
 a stage, which is usually some spot of verdure, where water and
 shrubs are in plenty, they are permitted to feed at liberty; they are then
 seen to eat as much in an hour, as will supply them for twenty-four, they
 seem to prefer the coarsest weeds to the softest pasture, the
 thistle, the nettle, the casia, and other prickly vegetables, are their
 favourite food; but their drivers take care to supply them with a kind of
 paste composition, which serves as a more permanent nourishment. As
 these animals <PB N="309" REF="406"/> have often gone the same track, they
 are said to know their way precisely, and to pursue their passage
 when their guides are utterly astray: when they come within a few miles of
 their baiting-place, in the evening, they sagaciously scent it at a
 distance, and encreasing their speed, are often seen to trot, with
 vivacity to their stage.</P>
<P>The patience of this animal is most extraor∣dinary; and it is
 probable, that its sufferings are great, for when it is loaded, it sends
 forth most lamentable cries, but never offers to resist the tyrant that
 oppresses it. At the slightest sign, it bends its knees and lies upon
 its belly, suffer∣ing itself to be loaded in this position; by this
 practice the burthen is more easily laid upon it, than if lifted up while
 standing; at another sign it rises with its load, and the driver getting
 upon its back, between the two panniers, which, like hampers, are placed upon
 each side, he encourages the camel to proceed with his voice and with a
 song. In this manner the creature proceeds contentedly forward, with a slow
 un∣easy walk, of about four miles an hour, and when it comes to its stage,
 lies down to be unloaded, as before.</P>
<P>Mr. Buffon seems to consider the camel to be the most
 domesticated of all other creatures, <PB N="310" REF="407"/> and to have more
 marks of the tyranny of man imprinted on its form. He is of opinion, that this
 animal is not now to be found in a state of nature, that the humps on its
 back, the calo∣sities upon its breast, and its legs, and even the great
 reservoir for water, are all marks of long servitude and domestic
 constraint. The deformities he supposes to be perpetuated by generation,
 and what at first was accident at last becomes nature. However this be, the
 humps upon the back grow large in proportion as the animal is well fed, and if
 examined, they will be found composed of a substance not unlike the udder
 of a cow.</P>
<P>The inhabitants generally leave but one male to wait on ten females,
 the rest they castrate; and though they thus become weaker, they are more
 manageable and patient. The female receives the male in the same posi∣tion
 as when these animals are loaded; she goes with young for about a year,
 and, like all other great animals, produces but one at a time. The camel's milk
 is abundant and nourishing, and mixed with water makes a principle part of
 the beverage of the Arabians. These animals begin to engender at three years
 of age, and they ordinarily live from forty to fifty years. The genital part of
 the male resembles that of <PB N="311" REF="408"/> the bull, but is placed
 pointing backwards, so that its urine seems to be ejected in the manner of
 the female. This, as well as the dung, and al∣most every part of this animal,
 is converted to some useful purpose by the keepers. Of the urine
 falmoniac is made; and of the dung, lit∣ter for the horses, and fire, for the
 purpose of dressing their victuals. Thus, this animal alone seems to
 comprise within itself, a variety of qualities, any one of which serves
 to render other quadrupedes absolutely necessary for the welfare of man;
 like the elephant, it is man∣ageable and tame; like the horse, it gives the
 rider security; it carries greater burthens than the ox, or the mule, and its
 milk is furnished in as great abundance as that of the cow; the flesh of
 the young ones is supposed to be as deli∣cate as veal; their hair is more
 beautiful, and more in request than wool; while even of its very excrements,
 no part is useless.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. The Lama.</HEAD>
<P>AS almost all the quadrupedes of America are smaller than the
 resembling ones of the ancient continent, so the lama, which may be
 consi∣dered as the camel of the new world, is every way less than that of
 the old. This animal, like that described in the former chapter, stands
 high upon its legs, has a long neck, a small head, and resembles the camel,
 not only in its natural mildness, but its aptitude for servitude, its
 moderation, and its patience. The Ameri∣cans early found out its useful
 qualities, and availed themselves of its labours: like the camel, it serves
 to carry goods over places in∣accessible to other beasts of burthen; like
 that it is obedient to its driver, and often dies under, but never resists
 his cruelty.</P>
<P>Of these animals, some are white, others black, but they are
 mostly brown; its face re∣sembles that of the camel, and its height is
 about equal to that of an ass. They are not found in the ancient continent,
 but en∣tirely <PB N="313" REF="410"/> belong to the new; nor are they found
 spread over all America, but are found chiefly upon those mountains, that
 stretch from New Spain to the Streights of Magellan. They inhabit the
 highest regions of the globe, and seem to require purer air than animals of
 a lower situation are found to enjoy. Peru seems to be the place where they
 are found in greatest plenty. In Mexico, they are introduced rather as
 curiosities than beasts of burthen; but in Potosi, and other provinces of
 Peru, they make the chief riches of the Indians and Spaniards who rear them:
 their flesh is excellent food; their hair or rather wool, may be spun into
 beautiful cloathing, and they are capable, in the most rugged and dangerous
 ways, of carrying burthens not ex∣ceeding a hundred weight, with the greatest
 safety. It is true indeed that they go but slowly, and seldom above
 fifteen miles a day; their tread is heavy, but sure, they descend
 precipices, and find footing among the most craggy rocks where even men can
 scarce ac∣company them; they are, however, but feeble animals, and after four
 or five days labour, they are obliged to repose for a day or two. They are
 chiefly used in carrying the riches of the mines of Potosi, and we are told
 that there <PB N="314" REF="411"/> are above three hundred thousand of these
 animals in actual employ.</P>
<P>This animal, as was said before, is above three feet high, and the
 neck is three feet long, the head is small and well proportioned, the eyes
 large, the nose long, the lips thick, the upper divided, and the lower a
 little depending, like all those animals that feed upon grass, it wants the
 upper cutting teeth; the ears are four inches long, and move with great
 agility; the tail is but five inches long, it is small, strait, and a
 little turned up at the end; it is cloven footed, like the ox, but it has a
 kind of spear∣like appendage behind, which assists it in mov∣ing over
 precipices and rugged ways; the wool on the back is short, but long on the
 sides and the belly; it resembles the camel in the for∣mation of the
 genital parts in the male, so that it makes urine backwards; it couples
 also in the same manner, and though it finds much difficulty in the action,
 it is said to be much inclined to venery. A whole day is often passed,
 before this necessary business can be compleated, which is spent in
 growling, quarrelling, and spitting at each other; they seldom produce
 above one at a time, and their age never extends above ten or twelve years at
 farthest.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="412"/>Though the lama is no way comparable to the
 camel, either for size, strength, or per∣severance, yet the Americans
 find a substitute in it, with which they seem perfectly content∣ed. It
 appears formed for that indolent race of masters, which it is obliged to
 serve; it re∣quires no care, nor no expence in the attending or providing for
 its sustenance; it is supplied with a warm covering, and therefore does
 not require to be housed; satisfied with vegetables and grass, it wants
 neither corn nor hay to subsist it; it is not less moderate in what it
 drinks, and exceeds even the camel in tem∣perance. Indeed, of all other
 creatures, it seems to require water least, as it is supplied by nature
 with saliva in such large quantities, that it spits it out on every
 occasion: this saliva seems to be the only offensive weapon that the
 harmless creature has to testify its resentment. When overloaded, or
 fatigued, and driven on by all the torturing acts of its keeper, it falls on
 its belly, and pours out against him, a quantity of this fluid; which, though
 probably no way hurtful, the Indians are much afraid of They say, that
 wherever it falls, it is of such an acrimonious nature, that it will either
 burn the skin, or cause very dangerous erup∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="413"/>Such are these animals in their domestic
 state; but as they are found wild in very great numbers, they exhibit marks
 of great force and agility, in their state of nature. The stag is
 scarcely more swift, or the goat, or the shamoy a better climber. All its
 shapes are more delicate and strong; its colour is tawney, and its wool is
 but short; in their native for∣rests, they are gregarious animals, and are
 often seen in flocks of two or three hundred at a time. When they perceive a
 stranger, they regard him at first with astonishment, without marking
 any fear or surprize; but shortly, as if by common consent, they snuff
 up the air, somewhat like horses, and at once, by a common flight take
 refuge on the tops of the mountains; they are fonder of the northern than the
 southern side of the Andes; they often climb above the snowy tracts of
 the mountain, and seem vigorous in proportion to the cold∣ness of their
 situation. The natives hunt the wild lama for the sake of its fleece. If
 the dogs surprize one upon the plain, they are generally successful; but
 if once the lama ob∣tains the rocky precipice of the mountain, the hunters are
 obliged to desist in their pursuit.</P>
<P>The lama seems to be the largest of the camel kind in America;
 there are others, which are <PB N="317" REF="414"/> called guanacoes and pacos,
 that are smaller and weaker, but endued with the same nature, and formed
 pretty much in the same manner. They seem to bear the same proportions to
 each other, that the horse does to the ass, and are employed with the
 same de∣gree of subordination. The wool, however, of the paco, seems to
 be the most valuable, and it is formed into stuffs, not inferiour to
 silk, either in price or beauty. The natural colour of the paco, is that of a
 dried rose leaf; the manufacturers seldom give its wool any other dye, but
 form it into quilts and carpets, which exceed those from the Levant. This
 manufacture forms a very considerable branch of commerce in South America,
 and probably too, might be extended to Europe, were the beauty, and the
 durability of what is thus wrought up suffi∣ciently known.</P>

<PB N="318" REF="415"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XV. The Nyl-ghau.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal, the name of which is pro∣nounced nylgaw is a native of
 India, and has but lately been imported into Europe; it seems to be of a
 middle nature, between the cow and the deer, and carries the appearance of both
 in its form. In size, it is as much smaller than the one, as it is larger
 than the other; its body, horns, and tail, are not unlike those of a bull;
 and the head, neck, and legs, are very like those of a deer. The colour, in
 ge∣neral, is ash or grey, from a mixture of black hairs and white; all along
 the ridge or edge of the neck, the hair is blacker, larger, and more erect,
 making a short thin and upright mane. Its horns are seven inches long, they
 are six inches round at the root, growing smaller by degrees, they
 terminate in a blunt point. The bluntness of these, together with the form
 of its head and neck, might incline us to suppose it was of the deer kind;
 but, as it never sheds its horns, it has a greater affinity to the cow.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="416"/>From the disposition of that brought over
 to this country, which has been very accurately and minutely described by Dr.
 Hunter, their manners were harmless and gentle. Although in its native
 wildness, it is said to be fierce and vicious, this seemed pleased with
 every kind of familiarity, and always licked the hand that stroked, or gave
 it bread, and never once attempted to use its horns offensively; it
 seemed to have much de∣pendance on its organs of smell, and snuffed
 keenly, and with noise, whenever any person came within sight; it did
 so likewise, when any food or drink was brought to it; and was so
 easily offended with smells, or so cautious, that it would not taste
 the bread which was offered, when the hand happened to smell strong of
 turpentine. Its manner of fighting is very par∣ticular. It was observed, at
 Lord Clive's, where two males were put into a little inclosure, that, while
 they were at a considerable distance from each other, they prepared for the
 attack, by falling upon their fore-knees, then they shuffled towards each
 other, with a quick pace, keeping still upon their fore-knees; and when they
 were come within some yards, they made a spring and darted against each
 other. The intrepidity and force with which they dart against any object,
 appeared by the strength with which <PB N="320" REF="417"/> one of them
 attempted to over-turn a poor labourer who unthinkingly stood on the
 outside of the pales of its inclosure. The Nyl ghau, with the quickness
 of lightning, darted against the wood-work with such vio∣lence, that he
 broke it to pieces, and broke off one of his horns close to the root, which
 occa∣sioned the animal's death. At all the places in India where we have
 settlements, they are considered as rarities, and brought from the
 distant interiour parts of the country. The Emperor, sometimes, kills them
 in such num∣bers, as to distribute quarters of them to all his omrahs;
 which shews that they are internally wild and in plenty, and esteemed good
 or dili∣cious food. The nyl-ghaus, which have been brought to England, have
 been most, if not all of them, received from Surat or Bombay; and they seem
 to be less uncommon in that part of India, than in Bengal; which gives room
 for a conjecture, that they may be indigenous, per∣haps in the province of
 Guzarat, one of the most western and the most considerable of the
 Hindostan empire, lying to the northward of Surat, and stretching away to
 the Indian ocean.</P>

<P><PB N="321" REF="419"/>OF the bear, there are three different kinds,
 the brown bear of the Alps, the black bear of North-America, which is
 smaller, and the great Greenland, or white bear. These, tho' diffe∣rent in
 their form, are no doubt of the same original, and owe their chief variations
 to food and climate. They have all the same habitudes, being equally
 carnivorous, treacherous and cruel. It has been said indeed, that the black
 bear of America, rejects animal food, but of the contrary I am certain, as I
 have often seen the young ones, which are brought over to London, prefer
 flesh to every kind of veget∣able aliment.</P>
<P>The brown bear, is properly an inhabitant of the temperate climates;
 the black finds sub∣sistance in the northern regions of Europe and
 America, while the great white bear takes re∣fuge in the most icy climates,
 and lives where scarce any other animal can find subsistence.</P>

<P><PB N="322" REF="422"/>The brown bear 
 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE> is not only
 savage but so∣litary; he takes refuge in the most unfrequent∣ed parts,
 and the most dangerous precipices of uninhabited mountains. It chuses its
 den in the most gloomy parts of the forest, in some cavern that has been
 hollowed by time, or in the hollow of some old enormous tree. There it
 retires alone, and passes some months of the winter without provisions,
 or without ever stir∣ring abroad. However this animal is not intirely
 deprived of sensation like the bat, or the dor∣mouse, but seems rather
 to subsist upon the exuberance of its former flesh, and only feels the
 calls of appetite, when the fat it had ac∣quired in summer, begins to be
 entirely wasted away. In this manner, when the bear retires to its den, to
 hide for the winter, it is ex∣tremely fat, but at the end of forty or fifty
 days, when it comes forth to seek for fresh nourishment, it seems to
 have slept all its flesh away. It is a common report, that during this
 time, they live by sucking their paws, which is a vulgar error that scarce
 requires confuta∣tion. These solitary animals couple in au∣tumn, but the
 time of gestation with the fe∣male is still unknown; the female takes great
 care to provide a proper retreat for her young, <PB N="323" REF="423"/> she
 secures them in the hollow of a rock, and provides a bed of hay in the
 warmest part of the den; she brings forth in winter, and the young ones
 begin to follow her in spring. The male and female, by no means inhabit the
 same den; they have each their separate retreat, and seldom are seen
 together but upon the accesses of genial desire.</P>
<P>The voice of the bear is a kind of growl, interrupted with rage,
 which is often caprici∣ously exerted; and tho' this animal seems gen∣tle
 and placid to its master, when tamed; yet it is still to be distrusted
 and managed with caution, as it is often treacherous and resentful without a
 cause.</P>
<P>This animal is capable of some degree of in∣struction. There are
 few but have seen it dance in aukward measures upon its hind feet, to the
 voice or the instrument of its leader; and it must be confessed that
 the dancer is of∣ten found to be the best performer of the two. I am told,
 that it is first taught to perform in this manner, by setting it upon hot
 plates of iron, and then playing to it, while in this un∣easy
 situation.</P>
<P>The bear, when come to maturity, can ne∣ver be tamed; it then
 continues in its native fierceness, and tho' caged, still formidably
 im∣potent, <PB N="324" REF="424"/> at the approach of its keeper flies to meet
 him. But notwithstanding the fierce∣ness of this animal, the natives in
 those coun∣tries where it is found, hunt it with great perseverance and
 alacrity. The least danger∣ous method of taking it is by intoxicating it, by
 throwing brandy upon honey, which it seems to be chiefly fond of, and seeks
 for in the hollow of trees. In Canada, where the black bears are very common,
 and where their dens are made in trees, that are hollow towards the top, they
 are taken by setting fire to their retreats, which are often above thirty
 feet from the ground. The old one is generally seen first to issue from
 her den, and is shot by the hunters. The young ones, as they descend, are
 caught in a noose, and are either kept or killed for provision. Their paws
 are said to be a great delicacy, and their hams are well enough known at the
 tables of the luxurious here. Their fat also, which still preserves a
 certain degree of fluidity, is supposed to be an efficacious remedy in
 white or indolent tumours, tho' probably very little superior to hogs
 lard.</P>
<P>The white Greenland bear differs greatly, both in figure and
 dimensions, from those al∣ready described; and tho' it preserves in
 gene∣ral the external form of its more southern <PB REF="425"/>

 yet it grows to above three times the size. The brown bear is seldom above
 six feet long; the white bear is often known from twelve to thirteen. The
 brown bear is made rather strong and sturdy, like the mastiff; the
 Greenland bear, tho' covered with very long hair, and apparently bulky, is
 nevertheless more slender, both as to the head, neck, and body, and more
 inclining to the shape of the grey∣hound. In short, all the variations of
 its fi∣gure and its colour, seem to proceed from the coldness of the
 climate, where it resides, and the nature of the food it is supplied
 with.</P>
<P>The white bear, seems the only animal, that by being placed in the
 coldest climate, grows larger than those that live in the temperate zones.
 All other species of animated nature, diminish as they approach the poles,
 and seem contracted in their size, by the rigours of the ambient
 atmosphere, but the bear, being un∣molested in these desolate climates,
 and meet∣ing no animal, but what he can easily con∣quer, finding also a
 sufficient supply of fishy provisions, he grows to an enormous size,
 and as the lion is the tyrant of an African forest, so the bear remains
 undisputed master of the icy mountains in Spitzbergen and Green∣land. When
 our mariners land upon those <PB N="326" REF="429"/> shores, in such parts
 as have not been frequent∣ed before, the white bears come down to view them
 with an aukward curiosity; they ap∣proach slowly, seeming undetermined
 whether to advance or retreat, and being naturally a timorous animal, they are
 only urged on by the conscious experience of their former vic∣tories;
 however, when they are shot at, or wounded, they endeavour to fly, or finding
 that impracticable, they make a fierce and des∣perate resistance till
 they die. As they live upon fish and seals, their flesh is too strong
 for food, and the captors have nothing but the skin, to reward them, for the
 dangers incur∣red in the engagement.</P>
<P>The number of these animals that are found about the north-pole,
 if we consider the scar∣city thereof, of all other terrestrial creatures
 is very amazing. They are not only seen at land, but often on ice-floats,
 several leagues at sea. They are often transported in this manner to the
 very shores of Iceland, where they no soon∣er land, but all the natives are
 in arms to re∣ceive them. It often happens, that when a greenlander and his
 wife are paddling out at sea, by coming too near an ice-float, a white bear
 unexpectedly jumps into their boat, and if he does not overset it, sits
 calmly where <PB N="327" REF="430"/> he first came down, and like a
 passenger, suf∣fers himself to be rowed along. It is probable the poor
 little greenlander is not very fond of his new guests, however he makes a
 virtue of necessity, and hospitably rows him to shore.</P>
<P>As this animal lives chiefly upon fish, seals, and dead whales,
 it seldom removes far from the shore. When forced by hunger, it often
 ventures into the deep, swims after seals, and devours whatever it can
 seize; it is however but a bad swimmer, and it is often hunted in this
 manner by boats, till it is fatigued, and at last destroyed. It often
 happens a battle en∣sues between a bear and a morse or a whale, as the
 latter are more expert in their own element, they generally prove victorious.
 However, when the bear can find a young whale, it re∣pays him for the danger he
 incurs of meeting with the parent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. The Badger.</HEAD>
<P>THE badgers legs are so short, that its belly seems to touch
 the ground; this however is but a deceitful appearance, as it is caused by
 the length of the hair, which is very long all over the body, and makes it
 seem much more bulky that it really is. It is a solitary stupid animal,
 that finds refuge, remote from man, and digs itself a deep hole, with great
 assiduity. It seems to avoid the light, and seldom quits its retreat by
 day, only stealing out at night to find sub∣sistence. It burrows in the
 ground very easy, its legs being short and strong, and its claws, stiff
 and horny. As it continues to bury itself, and throw the earth behind it, to
 a great dis∣tance, and thus forms to itself a winding hole, at the bottom
 of which it remains in safety. As the fox is not so expert at digging into
 the earth, it often takes possession of that which has been quitted by
 the badger, and some say, forces it from its retreat, by laying its
 excre∣ments at the mouth of the badger's hole.</P>

<P><PB N="329" REF="435"/>This animal, however, is not long in making
 itself a new habitation, from which it seldom ventures far, as it flies but
 slowly, and can find safety only in the strength of its retreat. When it
 is surprized by the dogs at some distance from its hole, it then combats
 with desperate resolution; it falls upon its back, defends itself on
 every side, and seldom dies unrevenged in the midst of its enemies.</P>
<P>The badger, like the fox, is a carnivorous animal, and nothing that
 has life can come amiss to it. It sleeps the greatest part of its time,
 and thus without being a voracious feed∣er, it still keeps fat, particularly
 in winter. They always keep their hole very clear, and when the female brings
 forth, she makes a com∣fortable warm bed of hay, at the bottom of her hole
 for the reception of her young. She brings forth in summer, generally to the
 num∣ber of three or four, which she feeds at first with her milk, and
 afterwards with such petty prey as she can surprize. She seizes the
 young rab∣bets in their warren, robs birds nests, finds out where the wild
 bees have laid up their honey, and brings all to her expecting brood.</P>
<P>The young ones when taken are easily tamed, but the old still
 continues savage and incorri∣gible; the former, after a short time, play
 with <PB N="330" REF="436"/> the dogs, follow their master about the house,
 but seem of all other animals the most fond of the fire. They often
 approach it so closely, that they burn themselves in a dangerous man∣ner.
 They are sometimes also subject to the mange, and have a gland under
 their tail, which scents pretty strongly. The poor of some countries eat
 their flesh; which, tho' fat, is at best, but rank and ill tasted.</P>

 ears are small, long, and pendant. Its neck and tail are short, and its

<P><PB N="333" REF="443"/>THE racoon, which some authors have called
 the Jamaica rat, is about the size of a small bad∣ger; its body is short
 and bulky; its fur is fine, long and thick, blackish at the surface, and
 grey towards the bottom; the nose is rather shorter, and more pointed than
 that of a fox; the eyes large and yellow, the teeth resembling those of a
 dog, the tail thick, but tapering to∣wards a point, regularly marked with rings
 of black, and at least as long as the body; the fore-feet are much shorter
 than the hinder, both armed with five sharp claws, with which, and his teeth,
 the animal makes a vigorous resistance. Like the squirrel, it makes use
 of its paws to hold its food while eating, but it dif∣fers from the
 monkey-kind, which use only but one hand on those occasions, whereas the
 racoon and the squirrel, use both; as wanting the thumb, their paws
 singly are unfit for grasping or holding; tho' this animal be short and
 bulky, it is however very active; its <PB REF="444"/>

 claws, enable it to climb trees with great facility; it runs on the trunk with
 the same swiftness that it moves upon the plain, and sports among the
 most extreme branches with great agility, security and ease; it moves
 forward chiefly by bounding, and tho' it pro∣ceeds in an oblique direction, it
 has speed e∣nough most frequently to escape its pursuers.</P>
<P>This animal is a native of the southern parts of America, nor have
 any travellers mentioned its being found in the Ancient Continent. But in the
 climates of which it is a native; it is found in noxious abundance,
 particularly in Jamaica, where it keeps in the mountains, and where it often
 descends to feed upon the plan∣tations of sugar-cane. The planters of
 these climates, consider these animals as one of their greatest
 miseries; they have contrived various methods of destroying them, yet
 still they pro∣pagate in such numbers, that neither traps nor fire-arms can
 set them free; so that a swarm of these famished creatures are found
 to do more injury in a single night, than the labours of a month can
 repair.</P>
<P>But tho', when wild they are thus troublesome, in a state of
 tameness no animal is more harm∣less or amusing; they are capable of
 being in∣structed in various little amusing tricks. The 
 <PB N="335" REF="447"/> racoon is playful and cleanly, and is very easily
 supported; it eats of every thing that's given it, and if left to itself,
 no cat can be a better pro∣vider; it examines every corner, eats of all
 flesh, either boiled or raw, eggs, fruits or corn, insects themselves
 cannot escape it, and if left at liber∣ty in a garden, it will feed upon
 snails, worms and beetles; but it has a particular fondness for sweets of
 every kind, and to be possest of these in its wild state, it incurs
 every danger. Though it will eat its provisions dry, it will for choice dip
 them in water if it happens to be in the way; it has one particularity which
 few other animals have been found to possess, it drinks as well by
 lapping, like the dog, as by sucking like the horse.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. The Coatimondi.</HEAD>
<P>THE first peculiarity with which this animal strikes the
 spectator, is the extreme length of its snout, which in some measure
 resembles that of the hog, but elongated to a surprizing degree; it bears
 some distant resemblance to the animal last described, except that
 the neck and the body are longer, the fur shorter, and the eyes smaller;
 but its principal distinction, as was said before, consists in the
 shape of its nose, the upper jaw being an inch longer than the lower, and
 the snout, which is moveable in every division, turning up at the end. Like
 the racoon, it sets up on its hinder legs with great ease, and in this
 position, with both paws, carries the food to its mouth.</P>
<P>This animal is very subject to eat its own tail, which is rather
 longer than its body, but this strange appetite is not peculiar to the coati
 alone; the mococo, and some of the monkey kinds do the same, and seem to
 feel no pain in <PB REF="449"/>

 if left at liberty in a state of tameness, it will pursue the poul∣try,
 and destroy every living thing that it has strength to conquer; tho' it is
 playful with its keeper, yet it seems obstinately bent against receiving
 any instruction, and neither threats nor caresses can induce it to
 practise any arts to which it is not naturally inclined. When it sleeps, it
 rolls itself up in a lump, and in that position often continues for

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. Of the Ant-Bear.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many animals that live upon ants in Africa and America;
 the pangolin or scaly lizard of Guinea may be considered among this number;
 but there are a greater variety in America, which makes those minute
 insects their only subsistence. Though they are of different figures
 and sizes, yet in general they go under one common name of the ant-bear; the
 peculiar length and slenderness of their snout, their singular
 appetites, and their man∣ner of taking their prey, striking us too
 strong∣ly to attend to the minute differences of their size or form.</P>
<P>They have been classed by Mr. Buffon into the larger tamandua,
 the smaller tamandua, and the ant-eater. The longest of this kind is four
 feet long, from the tip of the snout to the in∣sertion of the tail; their
 legs are short and arm∣ed with four strong claws; their tail is long and
 tuffy, and the animal often throws it on <PB REF="454"/>

 like the squirrel. The second of this kind is not above eighteen inches
 long, the tail is without hair, and it sweeps the ground as the animal moves.
 The ant-eater, which is the third variety, is still smaller than either of
 the former, as it is not above seven inches from the tip of the snout to
 the insertion of the tail. The two former are of a brown dusky colour, but
 this of a beautiful reddish, mixed with yel∣low; tho' they differ in figure,
 they all re∣semble each other in one peculiarity, which is the extreme
 slenderness of their snout, and the amazing length of their tongue.</P>
<P>The snout is produced in so disproportionate a manner, that
 the length of it makes near a fourth part of the whole figure. A horse has
 one of the longest heads of any animal we know, and yet the ant-bear has one
 above twice as long, in proportion to its body. The snout of this animal is
 almost round and cylindrical; it is extremely slender, and is scarce
 thicker near the eyes than at its extremity. The mouth is very small, the
 nostrils are very close to each other, the eyes are little, in proportion
 to the length of the nose, the neck is short, the tongue is extremely long,
 slender, and flatted on both sides; this it keeps generally doubled up in
 the mouth, and is the only instrument by <PB N="340" REF="458"/> which it
 finds subsistence; for the whole of this tribe are entirely without
 teeth, and find safety only in the remoteness and security of their
 retreat.</P>
<P>If we examine through the various regions of the earth, we shall
 find that all the most active, sprightly,
 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd useful quadrupedes have been
 gathered round man, and either served his pleasures, or still maintained
 their indepen∣dence by their vigilance, their cunning, or their industry. It
 is in the remote solitudes that we are to look for the helpless, the
 deformed, and the monstrous births of nature. These wretch∣ed animals being
 incapable of defending them∣selves, either by their agility, or their natural
 arms, fall a prey to every creature that attacks them; they therefore retire
 for safety into the darkest forests, or the most desart mountains,
 where none of the bolder, or swifter animals chuse to reside.</P>
<P>It may well be supposed that an animal so helpless as the
 ant-bear is, with legs too short to fit it for flight, and unprovided with
 teeth to give it a power of resistance, is neither nu∣merous, nor often
 seen; its retreats are in the most barren and uncultivated parts of
 South-America. It is a native only of the new con∣tinent, and intirely unknown
 to the old. It <PB N="341" REF="459"/> lives chiefly in the woods, and hides
 itself un∣der the fallen leaves. It seldom ventures from its retreat, and
 the industry of an hour sup∣plies it with sufficient food for several
 days to∣gether. Its manner of procuring its prey, is one of the most
 singular in all natural history; as its name implies, it lives entirely
 upon ants and insects; these, in the countries where it is bred, are found
 in the greatest abundance, and often build themselves hills, five or six
 feet high, where they live in community. When this animal approaches an
 ant-hill, it creeps slowly forward on its belly, taking every pre∣caution to
 keep itself concealed, till it comes within a proper distance of the place
 where it intends to make its banquet; there lying close∣ly along at its
 length, it thrusts forth its round red tongue, which is often two feet long,
 across the path of these busy insects, and there lets it lye
 motionless for several minutes together. The ants of that country, some
 of which are half an inch long, considering it as a piece of flesh
 accidentally thrown before them, come forth and swarm upon it in great
 numbers, but wherever they touch, they stick; for this in∣strument is
 covered with a slimy fluid, which like bird-lime, entangles every creature
 that lights upon it. When therefore the ant-bear <PB N="342" REF="460"/> has
 found a sufficient number for one morsel, it instantly draws in the
 tongue, and devours them all in a moment; after which it still con∣tinues in
 its position, practising the same arts until its hunger is entirely
 appeased; it then retires to its hiding-place once more, where it continues
 in indolent existence, till again excited by the calls of hunger.</P>
<P>Such is the luxurious life of a creature, that seems of all others
 the most helpless and deformed. It finds safety in its hiding-places from
 its enemies, and an ample sup∣ply in some neighbouring ant-hill, for all
 its appetites. As it only tries to avoid its pur∣suers, it is seldom
 discovered by them; yet helpless as this animal is, when driven to an
 extremity, though without teeth, it will fight with its claws, with great
 obstinacy. With these arms alone, it has often been found to oppose the
 dog, and even the Jaguar. It throws itself upon its back, fas∣tens upon its
 enemy with all its claws, sticks with great strength and perseverance,
 and even after killing its invader, which is sometimes the case, does not
 quit its hold, but remains fastened upon him with vindic∣tive
 desperation.</P>

<P><PB N="343" REF="462"/>OF the sloth there are two different kinds,
 distinguished from each other by their claws; the one, which in its native
 country is called the unan, having only two claws upon each foot, and being
 without a tail; the other, which is called the ai, having a tail and three
 claws upon each foot. The unan has the snout longer, the ears more apparent,
 and the fur very different from the other. It differs also in the number of
 its ribs, this having forty-six, while the ai has but twenty-eight. These
 dif∣ferences, however, which though very appa∣rent, have been but little
 regarded in the de∣scription of two animals which so strongly re∣semble
 each other in the general out-lines of their figure, in their appetites, and
 their help∣less formation.</P>
<P>They are both, therefore, described under the common appellation
 of the sloth, and their habitudes well deserve our wonder and curio∣sity.
 <PB REF="463"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
 <PB N="343" REF="464"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
 <PB N="344" REF="465"/> Nature seems cramped and constrained in their
 formation; other animals are often in∣dolent from choice, these are slow
 from necessi∣ty; the ai, from which I shall take my descrip∣tion, and
 from which the other differs only in the slight particulars above-mentioned,
 and in being rather more active, is of about the size of a badger. Its fur is
 coarse and staring, some∣what resembling dried grass; the tail very
 short, and scarce appearing; the mouth extending from ear to ear; the eye
 dull and heavy; the feet armed with three claws each, and made so short,
 and set on so aukwardly, that a few paces is often the journey of a week;
 but though the feet are short, they are still longer than its legs, and
 these proceed from the body in such an oblique direction, that the sole
 of the foot seldom touches the ground. When the animal therefore is compelled
 to make a step forward, it scrapes on the back of the nails along the
 surface, and wheeling the limbs circularly about, yet still touching the
 ground, it at length places its foot in a progressive position; the other
 three limbs are all brought about with the same dif∣ficulty; and thus it is
 seen to move, not above three feet in an hour. In fact, this poor crea∣ture
 seldom changes place but by constraint, and when impelled by the
 severest stings of hunger.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="466"/>The sloth seems to be the meanest and
 most ill-formed of all those animals that chew the cud; it lives entirely
 upon vegetable food, on the leaves, the fruit, and the flowers of trees, and
 often even on the very bark, when nothing else is left on the tree for its
 subsistence. Like all other ruminant animals, it has four stomachs; and
 these requiring a large share of provision to supply them, it generally
 strips a tree of all its verdure in less than a fortnight. Still how∣ever
 it keeps aloft, unwilling to descend, while any thing remains that can
 serve it for food; it therefore falls to devouring the bark, and thus in a
 short time kills the tree upon which it found its support. Thus destitute
 of pro∣visions above, and crawling slowly from branch to branch, in hopes
 of finding something still left, it is at last obliged to encounter all
 the dangers that attend it below. Though it is formed by nature for climbing a
 tree with great pain and difficulty, yet it is utterly unable to descend; it
 therefore is obliged to drop from the branches to the ground, and as it is
 inca∣pable of exerting itself to break the violence of its descent, it
 drops like a shapeless heavy mass, and feels no small shock in the
 fall. There, after remaining some time torpid, it prepares for a journey to
 some neighbouring tree; but <PB N="346" REF="467"/> this of all migrations is
 the most tedious, dan∣gerous, and painful; it often takes a week in crawling
 to a tree not fifty yards distant; it moves with imperceptible slowness,
 and often baits by the way. All motions seem to torture it, every step it
 takes it sets forth a most plaintive, melancholy cry, which from some
 distant similitude to the human voice, excites a kind of disgust, mixed
 with pity. This plaintive sound seems its chief defence, few quadrupedes
 appear willing to interrupt its pro∣gress, either that the flesh is
 offensive, or that they are terrified at its cries. When at length they reach
 their destined tree, they mount it with much greater ease than when they
 moved upon the plain. They fall to with famished appetite, and as before,
 destroy the very source that supplies them.</P>
<P>How far these may be considered as the un∣finished productions
 of nature, I will not take upon me to determine; if we measure their
 happiness by our sensations, nothing, it is cer∣tain, can be more
 miserable; but it is probable, considered with regard to themselves, they
 may have some stores of comfort unknown to us, which may set them upon a
 level with some other inferior ranks of the creation; if a part of their life
 be exposed to pain and labour, it <PB N="347" REF="468"/> is compensated by
 a larger portion of plenty, indolence, and safety. In fact, they are formed
 very differently from all other quadrupedes, and it is probable, they have
 different enjoy∣ments. Like birds, they have but one com∣mon vent for the
 purposes of propagation, excrement, and urine. Like the tortoise, which
 they resemble, in the slowness of their motion, they continue to live
 some time af∣ter their nobler parts are wounded, or even taken away. They
 bear the marks of all those comely-formed animals, that like rude machines
 are not easily discomposed.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pennant's Synopsis.</BIBL></NOTE>
 Its note, according to Kircher, is an as∣cending and descending hexachord,
 which it utters only by night; its look is so piteous, as to move
 compassion; it is also accompa∣nied with tears, that dissuade every
 body from injuring so wretched a being. Its ab∣stinence from food is
 remarkably powerful; one that had fastened itself by its feet to a pole,
 and was so suspended cross two beams, remained forty days without meat,
 drink, or sleep; the strength of its feet is so great, that whatsoever
 it seizes on, cannot possibly be freed from its claws. A dog was let 
 <PB N="348" REF="469"/> loose at the above-mentioned animal, taken from the
 pole; after some time the sloth laid hold of the dog with its feet, and
 held him four days, till he perished with hun∣ger.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. The Gerbua.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal as little resembles a qua∣drupede, as that which has
 been described in a former chapter. If we should suppose a bird,
 divested of its feathers, and walking upon its legs, it might give us some
 idea of its figure. It has four feet indeed, but in running or resting, it
 never makes use of any but the hinder. The number of legs, however, do not
 much contribute to any animal's speed; and the gerbua, though pro∣perly
 speaking, furnished but with two, is one of the swiftest creatures in
 the world.</P>
<P>The gerbua is not above the size of a large rat, and its head is
 sloped somewhat in the manner of a rabbit, the teeth also are formed like
 those of the rat kind, there being two cutting teeth in each jaw; it has a
 very long tail, tufted at the end; the head, the back, and sides are covered
 with large ash-coloured soft hair; the breast and belly is whitish, but
 what most de∣serves <PB N="350" REF="471"/> our attention in the formation
 of this lit∣tle animal, is the legs; the fore-legs are not an inch long, with
 four claws and a thumb upon each, while the hinder-legs are two inches and a
 quarter, and exactly resemble those of a bird, there being but three toes,
 the middlemost of which is longest.</P>
<P>The gerbua is found in Egypt, Barbary, Pa∣lestine, and the
 desarts between Busserah and Aleppo; its hind-legs, as was said before,
 are only used in running, while the fore-paws, like those of a squirrel,
 grasp its food, and in some measure perform the office of hands. It is
 of∣ten seen by travellers as they pass along the desarts, crossing
 their way, and jumping six or eight feet at every bound, and going so
 swiftly, that scarce any other quadrupede is able to over∣take them. They
 are a lively, harmless race of animals, living entirely upon vegetables, and
 burrowing like rabbits in the ground. Mr. Pennant tells us of two that were
 lately brought to London, that burrowed almost through the brick wall of the
 room where they were kept; they came out of their hole at night for food, and
 when caught, were much fatter and slicker than when confined to their
 burrows. A variety of this animal is found also in Siberia and
 Cir∣cassia, and is most probably, common enough <PB N="351" REF="473"/>
 over all Asia. They are more expert diggers than even the rabbit itself;
 and when pursued for a long time, if they cannot escape by their
 swiftness, they try to make a hole instantly in the ground, in which they
 often bury themselves deep enough to find security before their pursuers
 come up. Their burrows, in some places, are so thick, as to be dangerous to
 travellers, the horses perpetually falling in them. It is a provident little
 animal, and lays up for the winter. It cuts grass in heaps of a foot
 square, which when dried, it carries into its burrow, therewith to serve it
 for food, or to keep its young warm during the rigours of the winter.</P>
<P>But of all animals of this kind, that which was first discovered
 and described by Mr. Banks, is the most extraordinary. He calls it the
 kan∣guroo; and though from its general outline, and the most striking
 peculiarities of its figure, it greatly resembles the gerbua, yet it entirely
 differs, if we consider its size, or those minute distinctions which
 direct the makers of systems in assorting the general ranks of
 nature.</P>
<P>The largest of the gerbua kind which are to be found in the
 ancient continent, do not ex∣ceed the size of a rabbit. The kanguroo of New
 Holland, where it is only to be found, is <PB N="351" REF="475"/>
 <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="352" REF="476"/> often
 known to weigh above sixty pounds, and must consequently be as large as a
 sheep. Al∣though the skin of that which was stuffed and brought home by
 Mr. Banks, was not much above the size of a hare, yet it was greatly
 superiour to any of the gerbua kind that have been hitherto known, and very
 different in ma∣ny particulars. The snout of the gerbua, as has been said,
 is short and round, that of the new-discovered animal long and slender;
 the teeth also entirely differ; for as the gerbua has but two cutting teeth
 in each jaw, making four in all, this animal, besides its cutting teeth, has
 four canine teeth also; but what makes a more striking peculiarity, is the
 formation of its low∣er jaw, which, as the ingenious discoverer
 sup∣poses, is divided into two parts, which open and shut like a pair of
 scissars, and cut grass, probably this animal's principal food. The
 head, neck, and shoulders are very small in proportion to the other parts
 of the body; the tail is nearly as long as the body, thick near the rump, and
 tapering towards the end, the skin is covered with a short fur, excepting
 the head and the ears, which bear a slight resemblance to those of the
 hare. We are not told, how∣ever, from the formation of its stomach, to what
 class of quadrupedes it belongs, from its eating <PB N="353" REF="477"/>
 grass, which it has been seen to do; one would be apt to rank it among the
 ruminant animals, but from the canine teeth which it is found to have, we may
 on the other hand suppose it to bear some relation to the carnivorous.
 Upon the whole, however, it can be classed with none more properly, than
 with animals of the ger∣bua kind, as its hind legs are so much longer than
 the fore; it moves also precisely in the same manner, taking great bounds
 of ten or twelve feet at a time, and thus sometimes escap∣ing even the
 fleetest greyhound, with which Mr. Banks pursued it. One of them, that was
 killed, proved to be good food; but a second, which weighed eighty-four
 pounds, and was not yet come to its full growth, was found to be much
 inferior.</P>
<P>With this last described and last discovered animal, I
 shall conclude the history of quadru∣pedes, which of all parts of natural
 knowledge seems to have been described the most accurate∣ly. As these,
 from their figure, as well as their sagacity, bear the nearest
 resemblance to man, and from their uses or enmities are the most
 respectable parts of the inferior creation, so it was his interest, and
 his pleasure, to make him∣self acquainted with their history. It is
 proba∣ble therefore that time, which enlarges the sphere 
 <PB N="354" REF="478"/> of our knowledge in other parts of learning, can add but
 very little to this. The addition of a new quadrupede to the catalogue already
 known, is of no small consequence, and hap∣pens but seldom; for the
 number of all is so few, that wherever a new one is found, it becomes an
 object worthy our best attention. It may take refuge in its native desarts
 from our pursuits, but not from our curiosity.</P>
<P>But it is very different with the inferior ranks of the creation;
 the classes of birds, of fishes, and of insects, are all much more
 nume∣rous, and more incompletely known. The quadrupede is possessed of
 no arts of escaping, which we are not able to overcome; but the bird removes
 itself by its swiftness, the fishes find protection in their native
 element, and in∣sects are secured in their minuteness, num∣bers, and
 variety. Of all these therefore, we have but a very inadequate catalogue, and
 though the list be already very large, yet every hour is adding to its
 extent.</P>
<P>In fact, all knowledge is pleasant only as the object of it
 contributes to render man happy, and the services of quadrupedes being so
 very necessary to him in every situation, he is particularly interested
 in their history: with∣out their aid, what a wretched and forlorn 
 <PB N="355" REF="479"/> creature would he have been! the principal part of his
 food, his cloathing, and his amusements are derived wholly from them, and he
 may be considered as a great lord, sometimes cherish∣ing his humble
 dependants, and sometimes ter∣rifying the refractory, to contribute to his
 de∣light and conveniencies.</P>
<P>The horse and the ass, the elephant, the ca∣mel, the lama, and
 the rein-deer, contribute to ease his fatigues, and to give him that
 swiftness which he wants from nature. By their assistance, he changes
 place without labour; he attains health without weariness; his pride is
 inlarged by the elegance of equipage, and other animals are pursued with a
 certainty of success. It were happy indeed for man, if while converting
 these quadrupedes to his own benefit, he had not turned them to the
 destruction of his fellow-creatures; he has employed some of them for the
 purposes of war, and they have conformed to his noxious ambition with but too
 fatal an obedience.</P>
<P>The cow, the sheep, the deer, and all their varieties, are
 necessary to him, though in a dif∣ferent manner. Their flesh makes the
 princi∣pal luxuries of his table, and their wool or skins the chief ornament
 of his person. Even those nations that are forbid to touch 
 <PB N="356" REF="480"/> any thing that has life, cannot wholly dispense with
 their assistance. The milk of these ani∣mals makes a principal part of
 the food of every country, and often repairs those consti∣tutions that have
 been broken by disease or intemperance.</P>
<P>The dog, the cat, and the ferret, may be considered as having
 deserted from their fellow-quadrupedes, to list themselves under the
 con∣duct and protection of man. At his command they exert all their services
 against such ani∣mals as they are capable of destroying, and follow them
 into places where he himself wants abilities to pursue.</P>
<P>As there is thus a numerous tribe, that he has taken into
 protection, and that sup∣plies his necessities and amusements, so
 there is also a still more numerous one, that wages an unequal combat
 against him, and thus call forth his courage and his industry. Were it not
 for the lion, the tyger, the panther, the rhinoceros, and the bear, he would
 scarce know his own powers, and the superiority of human art over brutal
 fierceness. These serve to excite, and put his nobler passions into
 motion. He attacks them in their retreat, faces them with resolution, and
 seldom fails of coming off with a victory. He thus be∣comes 
 <PB N="357" REF="481"/> hardier and better in the struggle, and learns to know
 and to value his own supe∣riority.</P>
<P>As the last mentioned animals are called forth by his boldest
 efforts, so the numerous tribe of the smaller vermin kind excite his
 continual vigilance and caution; his various arts and powers have been no where
 more manifest, than in the extirpation of those that multiply with such
 prodigious fecundity. Neither their agility nor their minuteness can secure
 them from his pursuits; and though they may infest, they are seldom found
 materially to injure him.</P>
<P>In this manner we see, that not only human want is supplied, but
 that human wit is shar∣pened, by the humbler partners of man in the creation.
 By this we see, that not only their benefits, but their depredations are
 useful, and that it has wisely pleased Providence to place us like
 victors in a subdued country, where we have all the benefit of conquest,
 without being so secure, as to run into the sloth and excesses of a
 certain and undisturbed possession. It ap∣pears therefore, that
 those writers who are con∣tinually finding immediate benefit in every
 pro∣duction, see but half way into the general sys∣tem of nature.
 Experience must every hour <PB N="538" REF="482"/> inform us, that all animals
 are not formed for our use; but we may be equally well assured, that
 those conveniencies which we want from their friendship, are well repaid by
 that vigilance which we procure from their enmity.</P>
