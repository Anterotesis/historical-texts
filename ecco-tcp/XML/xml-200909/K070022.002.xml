</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1558" UNIT="year"/> IN a nation divided like the
English, it could scarce be expected, that the death of one sovereign,
and the accession of another, who was strongly suspected to have
embraced opposite principles to those which prevailed, could be the
subject of universal satisfaction: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's po∣pularity.</NOTE> Yet so much were
men displeased with the present conduct of affairs, and such
apprehensions were entertained of futurity, that the people, overlooking
their theological disputes, expressed a very general and unseigned joy
that the scepter had passed into the hands of Elizabeth. That princess
had discovered great prudence in her conduct during the reign of her
sister; and as men were sensible of the imminent danger to which she
was every <PB N="404" REF="5"/> moment exposed, the compassion towards her
situation, and concern for her safety, had rendered her, to an uncommon
degree, the favourite of the na∣tion. A Parliament had been assembled a few
days before Mary's death; and when Heathe, archbishop of York, then
chancellor, notified to them that event, scarce an interval of regret
appeared; and the two houses immediately resounded with the joyful
acclamations of 
<Q REND="inline">"God save Queen Elizabeth: Long and hap∣pily
may she reign."</Q> The people, less actuated by faction, and less
influenced by private views, expressed a joy still more general and
hearty on her proclama∣tion; and the auspicious commencement of this reign
prognosticated that felicity and glory which, during its whole course, so
uniformly attended it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>net, vol. II. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was at Hatfield when she heard of her sister's
death; and after a few days she proceeded thence to London, thro' crowds of
people, who strove with each other in giving her the strongest
testimony of their affections. On her entrance into the Tower, she could
not forbear reflecting on the great difference between her present fortune
and that which a few years before had attended her, when she was conducted to
that place as a prisoner, and lay there exposed to all the bigotted
malignity of her enemies. She fell on her knees, and expressed her thanks
to heaven, for the deliverance which the Almighty had granted her from her
bloody persecutors; a deliverance, she said, no less miraculous than
that which Daniel had received from the den of lions. This act of pious
gratitude seems to have been the last circumstance in which she
remembered any past inju∣ries and hardships. With a prudence and
magnanimity truly laudable, she bu∣ried all offences in oblivion, and
received with asfability even those who had acted with the greatest
virulence against her. Sir Harry Bennifield himself, to whose custody
she had been committed, and who had treated her with uncommon seve∣rity,
never felt, during the whole course of her reign, any effects of her
resent∣ment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 374.</NOTE>. Yet was not
the gracious reception which she gave, prostitute and
un∣distinguishing. When the bishops came in a body to make their
obeisance to her, she expressed to all of them sentiments of regard;
except to Bonner, from whom she turned aside, as from a man polluted with
blood, who was a just ob∣ject of horror to every heart susceptible of
humanity<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Heylin, p. 102.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER employing a few days in ordering her domestic affairs,
Elizabeth noti∣fied to foreign courts, her sister's death, and her own
accession to the crown. She sent lord Cobham to the Low Countries, where
Philip then resided; and she took care to express to that monarch, her
gratitude for the protection which he had assorded her, and her desire of
presevering in that friendship which was so <PB N="405" REF="6"/> happily
commenced between them. Philip, who had long foreseen this event, and who
still hoped, by means of Elizabeth, to obtain that dominion over Eng∣land,
which he had failed of in espousing Mary, immediately dispatched orders
to the duke of Feria, his ambassador at London, to make proposals of
marriage to the Queen, and he offered to procure from Rome a dispensation
for that pur∣pose. But Elizabeth soon came to the resolution of declining
this proposal. She saw that the nation had entertained an extreme
aversion to the Spanish alliance during her sister's reign; and that
one great cause of the popularity which she herself enjoyed, was the
prospect of being freed, by her means, from the danger of foreign
subjection. She was sensible, that her affinity with Philip, was exactly
similar to that between her father and Catherine of Arragon; and that her
mar∣rying that monarch was, in effect, declaring herself illegitimate, and
incapable of succeeding to the throne. And tho' the power of the Spanish
monarchy might still be sufficient, in opposition to all pretenders, to
support her title, her masculine spirit disdained such precarious
dominion, which, as it would depend solely on the power of another, must be
exercised according to his inclination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amden in Kennet, p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Burnet, vol. II. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE>. But while these views
prevented her from entertaining any thoughts of a marriage with Philip, she
gave him a very obliging, tho' evasive, answer; and he still retained
such hopes of success, that he sent a messenger to Rome, with
orders to sollicit the dispensation.</P>
<P>THE Queen too, on her sister's death, had wrote to Sir
Edward Carne, the Eng∣lish ambassador at Rome, to signify her
accession to the pope; but the precipitate nature of Paul broke thro' all
the cautious measures concerted by that young princess. He told Carne, that
England was a sief of the holy see; and it was a great temerity in her to
have assumed, without his participation, the title and authority of Queen:
That Elizabeth, being illegitimate, could not possibly in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>it that kingdom; nor could he annul the
sentence pronounced by Clement the seventh, and Paul the third, with regard
to Henry's marriage: That were he to proceed with rigour, he would punish
this criminal invasion of his rights, by rejecting all her applications; but
being willing to treat her with paternal indul∣gence, he would still keep the
door of grace open to her: And that if she would renounce all pretensions
to the throne, and submit entirely to his will, she should experience the
utmost lenity which was compatible with the dignity of the apos∣tolic
see<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>. When this answer was reported to Elizabeth, she was
as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onished at the character of
that aged pontiff; and having recalled her a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e con∣tinued with more determined
resolution to pursue those measures which the had already secretly
embraced.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="7"/> THE Queen, not to alarm the partizans of
the catholic religion, had retained eleven of her sister's councellors; but
in order to ballance their authority, she added eight more who were known to
be affectionate to the protestant commu∣nion: The marquis of Northampton, the
earl of Bedford, Sir Thomas Parry, Sir Edward Rogers, Sir Ambrose Cave, Sir
Francis Knolles, Sir Nicholas Bacon, whom she created lord keeper, and Sir
William Cecil, secretary of state<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Ann.
vol. I. p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re-establish∣ment of the protestant
religion.</NOTE> With these counsellors, particularly Cecil, she
frequently deliberated concerning the expediency of restoring the
protestant religion, and the means of executing that great enterprize. Cecil
told her, that the greatest part of the nation had, ever since her father's
reign, inclined to the reformation; and tho' her sister had con∣strained
them to profess the ancient faith, the cruelties exercised by her
ministers, had still more alienated their affections from it: That happily
the interests of the sovereign concurred here with the inclinations of the
people; nor was her title to the crown compatible with the authority of the
Roman pontiff: That a sentence, so solemnly pronounced by two popes
against her mother's marriage, could not possibly be recalled, without
inflicting a mortal wound on the credit of the see of Rome; and even if she
was allowed to retain the crown, it would only be on an uncertain and dependant
footing: That this motive counterballanced all dan∣gers whatever; and these
dangers themselves, if narrowly viewed, would be found very little
formidable: That the curses and execrations of the Romish church, when not
seconded by military force, were, in the present age, more an object of
ridicule than of terror, and had now as little influence in this world as in
the next: That tho' the bigotry or ambition of Henry or Philip might in∣cline
them to execute a sentence of excommunication against her, their
interests were so incompatible, that they never could concur in any plan of
operations; and the enmity of the one would always ensure to her the
friendship of the other: That if they encouraged the discontents of her
catholic subjects, their dominions also abounded with protestants, and it
would be easy to retaliate that injury upon them: That even such of the
English as seemed at present zealously attached to the catholic faith,
would most of them embrace the religion of their new sove∣reign; and the
nation had of late been so accustomed to these revolutions, that men had
lost all idea of truth and falsehood in such subjects: That the
authority of Henry the eighth, so highly raised by many concurring
circumstances, first enured the people to this submissive deference;
and it was more easy for the suc∣ceeding princes to continue the nation in
a train to which it had been so long ac∣customed: And that it would be
easy for her, by bestowing on protestants all <PB N="407" REF="8"/> the
commissions in civil offices and the militia, the church and the
universities, both to ensure her own authority, and to render her religion
entirely predo∣minant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 377. Camden,
p. 370.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE education of Elizabeth, as well as her interest, led her
to favour the re∣formation; and she remained not long in suspense with
regard to the party, which she should embrace: But tho' determined in her
own mind, she resolved to proceed by gradual and secure steps, and not
to imitate the example of Mary, in encouraging the bigots of her party to make
immediately a violent invasion on the established religion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 378. Camden, p. 371</NOTE>. She
thought it requisite, however, to discover such symptoms of her
intentions, as might give encouragement to the prote∣stants, so much
depressed by the late violent persecution. She immediately re∣called all
the exiles, and gave liberty to the prisoners who were confined on ac∣count
of religion. We are told of a pleasantry of one Rainsford on this
occa∣sion, who said to the Queen, that he had a petition to present her
in behalf of other prisoners called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John: She
readily replied, that it behoved her first to consult the prisoners
themselves, and to learn of them whether they desired that liberty, which
he demanded for them<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 103.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH also proceeded to exert, in favour of the reformers,
some acts of power, which were consistent with the extent of the royal
prerogative during that age. Finding, that the protestant teachers, irritated
by persecution, broke out in a furious attack of the antient
superstition, and that the Romanists replied with no less zeal and
acrimony, she published a proclamation, by which she prohibited all
preaching without a special licence<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p.
104. Strype, vol. I. p. 41.</NOTE>; and tho' she dispensed with this
prohibition in favour of some preachers of her own sect, she took care,
that they should be the most calm and moderate of the party. She also
sus∣pended the laws so far as to order a great part of the service; the
litany, the Lord's prayer, the creed, and the gospels; to be read in
English. And having first published injunctions, that all the churches
should conform themselves to the practice of her own chappel, she forbade
the hoste to be any more elevated in her presence; an innovation, which,
however frivolous it may appear, implied the most material
consequences<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. Heylin, p. 104. Strype, vol. I.
p. 54. Stowe, p. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE declarations of her intention, concurring with the
preceding suspicions, made the bishops foresee with certainty a
revolution in religion. They there∣fore refused to officiate at her
coronation; and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with some
difficulty, that the <PB N="408" REF="9"/> bishop of Carlisle was at last
prevailed on to perform that ceremony. When she was conducted thro' London,
amidst the joyful acclamations of her subjects, a boy, who personated
truth, was let down from one of the triumphal arches, and pre∣sented her with
a copy of the Bible. She received the book with the most gra∣cious
deportment, placed it next her bosom, and declared, that, amidst all the
costly testimonies which the city had that day given of their attachment,
this present was by far the most precious and most acceptable<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vol.
II. p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> vol. I. p. 9.</NOTE>.
Such were the in∣nocent artifices, by which Elizabeth insinuated herself
into the affections of her subjects. Open in her address, gracious and
affable in all public appearances, she rejoiced in the concourse of her
subjects, entered into all their pleasures and amusements, and without
departing from her dignity, which she knew well how to preserve, she
acquired a popularity beyond what any of her predecessors or
succes∣sors ever could attain. Her own sex exulted to see a woman
hold the reins of empire with such prudence and fortitude: And while a young
princess of twenty-five years (for that was her age at her accession) who
possessed all the graces and insinuation, tho' not all the beauty of
her sex, courted the affections of indivi∣duals by her civilities, of the
public by her services, her authority, tho' corro∣borated by the
strictest bands of law and religion, appeared to be derived en∣tirely from
the choice and inclination of the people.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1559" UNIT="year"/> A SOVEREIGN of this
disposition was not likely to offend her subjects by any useless or
violent exertions of power; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> and Elizabeth, tho' she
threw out such hints as encouraged the protestants, delayed the entire
change of religion till the meeting of the Parliament, which was summoned to
assemble. The elections had gone entirely against the catholics, who
seem not indeed to have made any great struggle for the superiority; and
the houses met in a disposition of gratify∣ing the Queen in every
particular, which she could desire of them. They began the session
with an unanimous declarati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, 
<Q REND="inline">"that Queen Elizabeth was, and ought to be, as
well by the word of God, as the common and statute laws of the realm, the
lawful, undoubted, and true heir to the crown, lawfully descended from the
blood royal, according to the order of succession, settled in the 35th
of Henry VIII.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>"</Q> This act of recognition was undoubtedly
dictated by the Queen herself and her ministers; and she showed her
magnanimity, as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the
terms, which she employed on that occasion. She followed not
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the validity of her mother's
marriage, or in ex∣pressly repealing the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> formerly made against her
own legitimacy: She know, that this attempt must be att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed with reflection on her father's memory, as 
<PB N="409" REF="10"/> well as on the birth of her deceased sister; and as
all the world were sensible that Henry's divorce from Anne Boleyn was
merely the effect of his violence and caprice, she scorned to found her
title on any act of an assembly, which had too much prostituted its
authority by its former variable, servile and iniquitous de∣cisions.
Satisfied therefore in the general opinion entertained with regard to this
fact, which appeared the more undoubted, the less anxiety she discovered
in fortifying it by votes and enquiries; she took possession of the
throne, both as her birth-right, and as ensured to her by former acts of
Parliament; and she never appeared sollicitous to distinguish these
titles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 372. Heylin, p. 107, 108.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE first bill which was brought into the Parliament with a
view of trying their disposition with regard to religion, was that for
suppressing the monasteries lately erected, and for restoring the
tenths and first-fruits to the Queen. This point being gained without much
difficulty, a bill was next introduced, annexing the supremacy to the crown;
and tho' the Queen was there denominated <HI>governess,</HI> not
<HI>head,</HI> of the church, it conveyed the same extensive power, which
had formerly been exercised by her father and brother. All the bishops who
were present in the upper house strenuously opposed this law; and as
they possessed more learning than the temporal peers, they triumphed in
the argument; but the majority of voices in that house, as well as among the
commons, were against them. By this act the crown, without the concurrence,
either of the Parliament or even of the convocation, was vested with the
whole spiritual power; might repress all here∣sies<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In determining heresy, the crown was only limited (if that could
be called a limitation) to such doctrines as had been adjudged heresy, by
the auth rity of the Scripture, by the first four general
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or by any general council,
which followed the Scripture as their rule, or to such other doctrines as
should hereafter be denominated heresy by the Parliament and convocation. 1
Eliz. cap 2.</NOTE>, might establish or repeal all canons, might alter
every point of discipline, and might ordain or abolish any religious rite
or ceremony<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz. cap. 1. This last power
was anew granted in the act of uniformity. 1 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>. In order to
exercise this unlimited authority, the Queen, by a clause of the act, was
empowered to name commissioners, either laymen or clergymen, as she
should think proper; and on this clause was afterwards founded the court of
ecclesiastical commission; which assumed very large
discretionary, not to say arbitrary powers, totally incompatible with any
exact limitations in the constitution. Their proceedings indeed were only
consistent with absolute monarchy; but were entirely suitable to the
genius of the act on which they were established; an act that at once gave
the crown all the power, which had formerly been claimed by the popes, but
which even these usurping prelates had never been able fully to exercise,
without some con∣currence of the clergy.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="11"/> WHOEVER refused to take an oath,
acknowledging the Queen's supremacy, was incapacitated from holding any
office; whoever denied the supremacy, or attempted to deprive the Queen of
that prerogative, forfeited, for the first of∣fence, all their goods and
chattels, for the second were subjected to the penalty of a premunire; but
the third offence was declared treason. These punishments, however
severe, were less rigorous than such as were formerly, during the reigns
of her father and brother, inflicted in like cases.</P>
<P>A LAW was passed, confirming all the statutes enacted in
King Edward's time with regard to religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>: The nomination
of bishops was given to the crown without any election of the chapters: The
Queen was empowered, on the va∣cancy of any see, to seize all the
temporalities, and to bestow on the bishops-elect an equivalent in the
impropriations belonging to the crown. This pretended equivalent was commonly
very much inferior in value; and thus the Queen, amidst all her concern for
religion, followed the example of the preceding re∣formers, in committing
depredations on the ecclesiastical revenues.</P>
<P>THE bishops and all incumbents were prohibited from alienating
their reve∣nues, and from letting leases longer than twenty-one years or
three lives. This law seemed to be intended for securing the property of
the church; but as an exception was left in favour of the crown, great abuses
still prevailed. It was usual for a courtier, during this reign, to make a
transaction with a bishop or incumbent; and to procure a sham alienation
to the Queen, who afterwards transferred the lands to the person agreed
on<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 79.</NOTE>. This method of
pillaging the church was not remedied till the beginning of James the first.
The present de∣pression of the clergy exposed them to all injuries; and
the laity never stopped till they had reduced the church to such poverty,
that her plunder was no longer a compensation for the odium incurred by
it.</P>
<P>A SOLEMN and public disputation was held during this
session, in presence of lord keeper Bacon, between the divines of the
protestant and those of the catholic party. The champions appointed to
defend the religion of the sovereign, were, as in former instances,
entirely triumphant, and the popish disputants, being pronounced refractory
and obstinate, were even punished by imprisonment<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 95.</NOTE>. Emboldened by this victory, the
protestants ventured on the last and most important step, and brought
into Parliament a bill<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>
for abolishing the mass, and re-establishing the liturgy of King
Edward. Penalties were enacted, as well against those who departed from
this mode of worship, as those who absented themselves from the church
and the sacraments. And thus in one session, without any violence, 
<PB N="411" REF="12"/> tumult, or clamour, was the whole system of religion
altered, on the very com∣mencement of a reign, and by the will of a young
woman, whose title to the crown was by many esteemed liable to great
objections: An event, which, tho' it may appear surprizing to men in the
present age, was every where expected on the first news of her
accession.</P>
<P>THE commons also made a sacrifice to the Queen more
difficult to obtain than that of any articles of religion: They voted a
subsidy of four shillings in the pound on land, and two shillings and
eight pence on goods, together with two fifteenths<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The
Parliament also granted the Queen the duties of tonnage and poundage; but
this concession was at that time regarded only as a matter of form, and
she had levied these duties before they were voted by the Parliament: But
there was another exertion of power, which she practised, and which people,
in this age, from their ignorance of the antient constitution, may be apt to
think a little extraordinary. Her sister, after the commencement of the war
with France, had, from her own authority, imposed four marks on each ton of
wine imported, and had encreased the poundage a third on ail commodities.
Queen Elizabeth continued these impositions as long as she thought
convenient. The Parliament, who had so good an opportunity of restraining
these arbitrary taxes, when they voted the tonnage and poundage, thought
proper not to make any mention of them. They knew, that the sovereign, during
that age, pretended to have the sole regulation of foreign trade, and that
their intermed lling with that prerogative would have drawn on them the
severest reproof, if not chastisement. See Forbes vol. I. p. 132, 133.
We know certainly from the statutes and journals, that no such
unpositions were granted by Parliament.</NOTE>. The house in no instance
departed from the most respectful deference and complaisance towards the
Queen. Even the importunate address, which they made her on the conclusion
of the session, to fix her choice of a husband, could not, they
supposed, be very disagreeable to one of her sex and age. The address
was couched in the most respectful expressions; yet met with a
refusal from the Queen. She told the speaker, that as the application from
the house was conceived in general terms, only recommending marriage, without
pretend∣ing to direct her choice of a husband, she could not take offence
at the address, or regard it as other than a new instance of their
affectionate attachment towards her: That any farther interposal on their
part would have ill become either them to make, as subjects, or her to hear
as an independant princess: That even while she was a private person, and
exposed to much danger, she had always declined that engagement, which
she regarded as an incumbrance; much more, at pre∣sent would she
persevere in that sentiment, when the charge of a great kingdom was
committed to her, and her life ought to be entirely dedicated to promoting the
interests of religion and the happiness of her subjects: That as England
was her husband, wedded to her by this pledge (and here she shewed them
her singer with the same gold ring upon it, with which she had solemnly
betrothed herself <PB N="412" REF="13"/> to the kingdom at her inauguration)
so all Englishmen were her children; and while she was employed in the
rearing or governing such a family, she could not esteem herself
barren, or her life useless and unfruitful: That if she ever en∣tertained
thoughts of changing her condition, the care of her subjects welfare would
still be uppermost in her thoughts; but should she live and die a
virgin, she doubted not but the divine providence, seconded by their
counsels and her own measures, would be able to prevent all dispute with
regard to the succession, and secure them a sovereign, who, perhaps
better than her own issue, would imitate her example in loving and
cherishing her people: And that for her part, she desired that no higher
character, nor fairer remembrance of her should be transmitted to
posterity, than to have this inscription engraved on her tomb-stone, when
she should pay the last debt to nature;

that tho' this session was the first of the reign, no person was
attainted; but on the contrary, some restored in blood by the Parliament. A
good symptom of the lenity, at least of the prudence of the Queen's
government.</NOTE>, the laws, enacted with regard to religion, were put in
execution, and met with no disturbance or opposition from any quarter. The
liturgy was again introduced in the vulgar tongue, and the oath of supremacy
was tendered to the clergy. The number of bishops had been reduced to
fourteen by a very sickly season, which preceded; and all of these,
except the bishop of Landaffe, having refused compliance, were degraded
from their sees: But of the inferior clergy throughout all England, where
there are near 10,000 parishes, only eighty parish rectors, fifty
prebendaries, fifteen heads of colleges, twelve archdeacons, and as many deans,
sacrificed their livings to their religious principles<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 376. Heylin, p. 115. Strype, vol. I. p. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. with some small
variations.</NOTE>. Those in high ecclesiastical stations, who were
ex∣posed to the eyes of the world, seem chiefly to have placed a point of
honour in their perseverance; but on the whole, the protestants, in the
former change in∣troduced by Mary, appear to have been much more rigid and
conscientious. Tho' the catholic religion, adapting itself to the
senses, and requiring observances, which enter into the common train of
life, does at present lay much faster hold of the mind than the reformed,
which, being chiefly spiritual, resembles more a system of
metaphysics; yet was the proportion of zeal, as well as of knowlege, during
the first ages after the reformation, much greater on the side of the
pro∣testants. The catholics continued, ignorantly and supinely, in their
antient be∣lief, or rather their antient practices: But the reformers, obliged
to dispute on every <PB N="413" REF="14"/> occasion, and enflamed to a
degree of enthusiasm by novelty and persecution, had strongly attached
themselves to their tenets; and were ready to sacrifice their fortunes and
even their lives, in defence of their speculative and abstract prin∣ciples.
The forms and ceremonies, still preserved in the English liturgy, as they
bore some resemblance to the antient service, tended farther to reconcile
the catho∣lics to the established religion; and as the Queen permitted no
other mode of wor∣ship, and at the same time struck out every thing that
could be offensive to them in the new liturgy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin,
p. 111.</NOTE>, even those addicted to the Romish communion made no
scruple of attending the established church. Had Elizabeth gratified her
own inclinations, the exterior appearance, which is the chief circumstance
with the people, would have been still more similar between the new and the
antient form of worship. As she loved state and magnificence in every
thing, she was somewhat addicted to the pomp of the catholic religion; and
it was merely in compliance with the prejudices of her party, that she gave
up either the images or the addresses to the saints, or prayers for the
dead<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 37<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 397. Camden, p.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France.</NOTE> WHILE the Queen and
Parliament were employed in settling the public religion, the negotiations
for a peace were still conducted, first at Cercamp, then at
Cha∣teau-Cambresis, between the ministers of France, Spain, and England;
and Elizabeth, tho' equally prudent, was not so successful in this
transaction. Philip employed his utmost efforts to procure the
restitution of Calais, both as bound in honour to indemnify England, which,
merely on his account, had been drawn into the war, and as engaged in
interest to remove France from his frontiers in the Low Countries. So long as
he entertained hopes of espousing the Queen, he delayed concluding a peace
with Henry; and even after the change of religion in England deprived him of
all such views, his ministers hinted a proposal, which may be regarded as
reasonable and honourable. After all his own terms with France were
settled, he seemed willing to continue the war, till she should obtain
satisfaction; provided she would stipulate to adhere to the Spanish
alli∣ance, and continue hostilities against Henry, during the course of
six years<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Forbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Full View, vol I. p. 59.</NOTE>: But Elizabeth, after
consulting with her ministers, very wisely rejected this proposal. She
was sensible of the low state of her finances; the great debts contracted
by her father, brother, and sister; the disorders introduced into every
part of <PB N="414" REF="15"/> the administration; the divisions by which
her people were agitated; and she was convinced that nothing but tranquillity
during some years could bring the kingdom again into a flourishing
condition, or enable her to act with dignity and vigour, in her transactions
with foreign nations. Well acquainted with the value which Henry put upon
Calais, and the impossibility of recovering it by treaty during the
present emergency, she was willing rather to suffer that loss, than
submit to such a dependance on Spain, as she must expect to fall into,
if she continued pertinaciously in her present demand. She ordered,
therefore, her am∣bassadors, the lord Effingham, the bishop of Ely, and
Dr. Wotton, to conclude the negociation, and to settle a peace with Henry, or
any reasonable terms. Henry offered to stipulate a marriage between the
eldest daughter of the dauphin, and the eldest son of Elizabeth; and to
engage for the restitution of Calais as the dowry of that princess<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 54.</NOTE>; but as the Queen was
sensible that this treaty would appear to the world a palpable evasion,
she insisted upon more equitable, at least, more plausible
conditions. It was at last agreed, that Henry should restore Ca∣lais at
the expiration of eight years; that in case of failure, he should pay five
hundred thousand crowns, and the Queen's title to Calais still remain; that
he should find the security of seven or eight foreign merchants, not
natives of France, for the payment of this sum; that he should deliver five
hostages till that security was provided; that if Elizabeth broke the peace
with France or Scotland during that interval, she should forfeit all title
to Calais; but if Henry made war on Elizabeth, he should be obliged
immediately to restore that for∣tress<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
p. 68. Rymer, tom XV. p. 505.</NOTE>. Every person of penetration easily
saw, that these stipulations were but a colourable pretence for
abandoning Calais; but they excused the Queen on ac∣count of the
necessity of her affairs, and they even extolled her prudence, in
sub∣mitting, without farther struggle, to that necessity. A peace with
Scotland was a necessary consequence of that with France.</P>
<P>PHILIP and Henry concluded hostilities with a mutual
restitution of all places taken during the course of the war; and Philip
espoused the princess Elizabeth, eldest daughter of France, formerly
betrothed to his son Don Carlos. The duke of Savoy married Margaret, Henry's
sister, and obtained a restitution of all his dominions of Savoy and
Piedmont, except a few towns, retained by France. And thus general tranquillity
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emed to be restored to
Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disgust be∣tween the Queen, and Mary
Queen of Scots.</NOTE> BUT tho' a peace was signed and concluded between
France and England, there soon appeared a ground of quarrel, of the most
serious nature, and which was afterwards attended with the most important
consequences. The two mar∣riages <PB N="415" REF="16"/> of Henry the eighth,
that with Catherine of Arragon, and that with Anne Boseyn, were totally
incompatible with each other, and it seemed impossible that both of them
could be regarded as valid and legal: But still the birth of Elizabeth lay
under some disadvantages, to which that of her sister, Mary, was not
exposed. Henry's first marriage had obtained the sanction of all the
powers, both civil and ecclesiastical, which were then acknowleged in
England; and it was natural, for protestants as well as Romanists, to
allow, on account of the sincere intention of the parties, that their
issue ought to be regarded as legitimate. But his divorce, and second
marriage, had been concluded in direct opposition to the see of Rome; and
tho' they had been ratified by the authority both of the English Parliament
and convocation, those who were strongly attached to the ca∣tholic church,
and who reasoned with great strictness, were led to regard them as
entirely invalid, and to deny altogether the Queen's right of succession.
The next heir of blood was the Queen of Scots, now married to the dauphin; and
the great power of that princess, joined to her plausible title, rendered
her a very formidable rival to Elizabeth. The King of France had secretly
been solliciting at Rome a bull of excommunication against the Queen; and
she had here been beholden to the good offices of Philip, who, from
interest more than either friendship or principle, had negociated in her
favour, and had successfully opposed the pretensions of Henry. But the
court of France was not discouraged with this repulse: The duke of Guise,
and his brothers, thinking, that it would much augment their credit, if their
niece should bring an accession of England, as she had already done of
Scotland, to the crown of France, engaged the King not to neglect the claim;
and, by their persuasion, he ordered his son and daughter-in-law to
assume openly the arms as well as title of England, and to quarter these
arms on all their equipages, furniture, and liveries. When the English
ambas∣sador complained of this injury, he could obtain nothing but an
evasive answer; that as the Queen of Scots was descended from the blood
royal of England, she was entitled, by the example of many princes, to
assume the arms of that king∣dom. But besides that this practice had
never prevailed without permission be∣ing first obtained, and without
making a visible difference between the arms, Elizabeth plainly saw, that
this pretension had not been advanced during the reign of her sister
Mary; and that, therefore, the King of France intended, on the first
opportunity, to dispute her legitimacy, and her title to the crown. Alarmed
with the danger, she thenceforth conceived a strong jealousy against
the Queen of Scots; and was determined, as far as possible, to incapacitate
Henry from the execution of his project. The sudden death of that monarch,
who was killed in a tournament at Paris, while he was celebrating the
espousals of his <PB N="416" REF="17"/> sister with the duke of Savoy,
altered not her views. Being informed, that his successor, Francis the
second, still continued to assume, without reserve, the title of King
of England, she began to consider him and his Queen as her most mor∣tal
enemies; and the present situation of affairs in Scotland afforded her a
fa∣vourable opportunity, both of revenging the injury and of providing for her
own safety.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> THE murder of the
cardinal-primate at St. Andrews, had deprived the Scotch catholics of a head
whose severity, courage, and capacity had rendered him extremely formidable
to the innovators in religion; and the execution of the laws against heresy
began thenceforth to be much more remiss and gentle. The Queen-re∣gent
governed the kingdom by prudent and moderate councils; and as she was not
disposed to sacrifice the civil interests of the state to the bigotry
or interests of priests, she esteemed it more expedient to temporize,
and to connive at the pro∣gress of a doctrine which she had not power
entirely to repress. When informed of the death of Edward, and the
accession of Mary to the crown of England, she entertained hopes, that
the Scottish reformers, deprived of the countenance which they received from
that powerful kingdom, would lose their ardour with their prospect of
success, and would gradually return to the faith of their an∣cestors. But
the progress and revolutions of religion are little governed by the usual
maxims of civil policy; and the event much disappointed the regent's
ex∣pectations. Many of the English preachers, terrified with the severity
of Mary's government, took shelter in Scotland, where they found more
protection, and a milder administration; and while they propagated their
theological tenets, they filled that whole kingdom with a just horror
against the cruelties of the bigoted catholics, and showed their
disciples the fate which they must expect, if ever their adversaries
should attain an uncontrouled authority over them.</P>
<P>A HIERARCHY, moderate in its acquisitions of power and riches,
may safely grant a toleration to sectaries; and the more it abates the
fervor of innovators by lenity and liberty, the more securely will it
possess those advantages which the legal establishments bestow
upon it. But where superstition has raised a church to such an
exorbitant height as that of Rome, persecution is less the result of
bi∣gotry in the priests, than of a necessary policy; and the rigour of
law is the only method of repelling the attacks of men, who, besides
religious zeal, have so many other motives, derived both from public and
private interest, to engage them on the side of innovation. But tho' such
overgrown hierarchies may long support themselves by these violent
expedients, the time comes, when severities tend only to enrage the new
sectaries, and make them break thro' all bounds of reason and moderation.
This crisis was now visibly approaching in Scotland; and 
<PB N="417" REF="18"/> whoever considers merely the transactions resulting
from it, will be inclined to throw the blame equally on both parties; whoever
enlarges his view, and reflects on the situations, will observe the
necessary progress of human affairs, and the operation of those
principles which are inherent in human nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reformation in Scotland.</NOTE> SOME heads of
the reformers in Scotland, such as the earl of Argyle, his son lord Lorne,
the earls of Morton, and Glencarne, Erskine of Dun, and others, finding the
danger to which they were exposed, and desirous to propagate their
principles, entered privately into a bond or association; and called
themselves the <HI>Congregation</HI> of the Lord, in contradistinction to
the established church, which they denominated the Congregation of Satan.
The tenor of the bond was as follows: 
<Q REND="inline">"We, perceiving how Satan, in his members, the
antichrists of our time, do cruelly rage, seeking to overthrow and to
destroy the gospel of Christ and his congregation, ought, according to
our bounden duty, to strive, in our master's cause, even unto the death,
being certain of the victory in him. We do therefore promise, before the
majesty of God and his congregation, that we, by his grace, shall with all
diligence continually apply our whole power, substance, and our very lives,
to maintain, set forward, and establish the most blessed word of
God and his congregation; and shall labour, by all possible means, to
have faithful ministers, truly and purely to minister Christ's gospel
and sacraments to his people: We shall maintain them, nourish them, and
defend them, the whole congregation of Christ, and every member there∣of, by
our whole power, and at the hazard of our lives, against Satan, and all
wicked power, who may intend tyranny and trouble against the said
congre∣gation: Unto which holy word and congregation we do join ourselves;
and we forsake and renounce the congregation of Satan, with all the
superstitious abomination and idolatry thereof; and moreover shall
declare ourselves mani∣festly enemies thereto, by this faithful promise
before God, testified to this congregation by our subscriptions. At
Edinburgh, the third of Decem∣ber, 1557<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 66.
Knox, p. 101.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>HAD the subscribers of this zealous league been contented
only to demand a toleration of the new opinions; however incompatible their
pretensions might have been with the policy of the church of Rome, they would
have had the praise of opposing tyrannical laws, enacted to support an
establishment prejudicial to civil society: But it is plain, that they
carried their views much farther; and their practice immediately discovered
the spirit by which they were actuated. Supported by the authority which,
they thought, belonged to them as the con∣gregation <PB N="418" REF="19"/> of
the Lord, they ordained, that prayers in the vulgar tongue<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The reformers used at that time King Edward's liturgy in
Scotland. For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, p. 155.</NOTE>
should be used in all the parish churches of the kingdom; and that
preaching, and the interpretation of the scriptures should be practised
in private houses, till God should move the prince to grant public
preaching by faithful and true ministers<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith, p. 66. Knox, p. 101.</NOTE>. Such
bonds of association are always the forerunners of rebellion; and this
vio∣lent invasion of the established religion was the actual commencement
of it.</P>
<P>BEFORE this league was publicly known or avowed, the clergy,
alarmed with the progress of the reformation, attempted to recover their
lost authority, by a violent exercise of power, which tended still
farther to augment the zeal and number of their enemies. Hamilton, the primate,
seized Walter Mill, a priest of an irreproachable life, who had embraced
the new doctrines; and having tried him at St. Andrews, condemned him to the
flames for heresy. Such general aversion was discovered to this
barbarity, that it was some time before the bishops could prevail on any
one to act the part of a civil judge, and pronounce the sen∣tence upon him;
and even after the time of his execution was fixed, all the shops of St.
Andrews being shut, no one would sell a rope to tie him to the stake, and
the primate himself was obliged to furnish this implement. The man bore the
torture with that courage which, tho' usual on these occasions, always
ap∣pears astonishing and supernatural to the multitude: The people, to
express their abhorrence against the cruelty of the priests, raised a
monument of stones on the place of his execution; and as fast as the
stones were removed by order of the clergy, they were again supplied from
the voluntary zeal of the populace<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Knox, p.
122.</NOTE>. It is vain for men to oppose the severest punishments to
the united principles of reli∣gion and public applause; and this was the
last barbarity of the kind which the catholics had the power to exercise in
Scotland.</P>
<P>SOME time after, the people discovered their sentiments in
such a manner as was sufficient to prognosticate to the priests, the
fate which was awaiting them. It was usual on the festival of St. Giles,
the tutelar saint of Edinburgh, to carry in procession the image of that
saint; but the protestants, in order to prevent the ceremony, found means,
on the eve of the festival, to purloin the statue from the church, and they
please<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves with
imagining the astonishment and disappointment of his votaries. The
clergy, however, sramed hastily a new image, which, in derision, was
called by the people young St. Giles; and they carried it thro' the streets,
attended with all the ecclesiastics in the town and neighbourhood. The
multitude abstained from violence so long as the Queen∣regent 
<PB N="419" REF="20"/> continued a spectator, but the moment she retired,
they invaded the idol, threw it in the dirt, and broke it in pieces. The flight
and terror of the priests and fryars, who, it was remarked, deserted, in
his greatest distress, the object of their worship, was the source of
universal mockery and laughter.</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by all these appearances, the congregation
proceeded with ala∣crity in openly solliciting subscriptions to their
league; and the death of Mary of England, with the accession of Elizabeth,
which happened about this time, contributed much to increase their hopes of
final success in their undertaking. They ventured to present a petition
to the regent, craving a reformation of the church, and of the <HI>wicked,
scandalous,</HI> and <HI>detestable</HI> lives of the prelates and
ec∣clesiastics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 121.</NOTE>. They applied
to the Parliament, by a petition, in which, after pre∣mising, that they could
not communicate with the damnable idolatry, and into∣lerable abuses of the
papistical church, they desired, that the laws against here∣tics should
be executed by the civil magistrate alone, and that the scripture should
be the sole rule for judging of heresy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
p. 123.</NOTE>. They even petitioned the convocation, and insisted that
prayers should be said in the vulgar tongue, and that bishops should be
chosen with the consent of the gentry of the diocese, and priests with
the consent of the parishioners<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Keith, p.
78, 81, 82.</NOTE>. The regent prudently temporized between these parties;
and as she aimed at procuring a matrimonial crown for her son-in∣law, the
dauphin, she was, on that as well as other accounts, unwilling to come to
extremities with either of them.</P>
<P>BUT after this concession was obtained, she received
orders from France, pro∣bably dictated by the haughty spirit of her brothers,
to proceed with violence against the reformers, and to restore the royal
authority, by some signal act of power<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Melvil's Memoirs, p. 24 Jebb, vol. II. p. 446.</NOTE>. She made
the most eminent of the protestant teachers be cited to appear be∣fore the
council at Stirling; but when their followers were marching thither in great
multitudes, in order to protect and countenance them, she entertained
apprehen∣sions of an insurrection, and dissipated the people by a
promise<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 127. We shall suggest

be done to the prejudice of the ministers. This promise was violated; and a
sentence passed, by which all the ministers were pronounced rebels, on
ac∣count <PB N="420" REF="21"/> count of their not appearing. A measure, so
rash and ill advised, enraged the people, and made them resolve to
resist her authority by force of arms, and to proceed to extremity
against the clergy of the established religion.</P>
<P>IN this critical time John Knox arrived from Geneva, where he
had passed some years in banishment, and where he had imbibed, from his
commerce with Calvin, the highest fanaticism of his sect, augmented by
the natural ferocity of his own character. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th May.</NOTE> He had been invited back to
Scotland by the leaders of the reformation; and mounting the pulpit at Perth,
during the present ferment of mens minds, he declaimed with his usual
vehemence against the idolatry and other abominations of the church of Rome,
and incited his audience to exert their ut∣most zeal for its subversion.
A priest was so imprudent, after this sermon, as to open his repository
of images and relicts, and prepare himself to say mass. The audience, who
were wrought up to a disposition for any furious enterprize, were as much
enraged as if the spectacle had not been quite familiar to them: They
attacked the priest with fury, broke the images in pieces, tore the pictures,
overthrew the altars, scattered about the sacred vases; and lest no
implement of idolatrous worship, as they called it, entire or unbroken. They
thence proceeded with additional numbers, and augmented rage, to the
monasteries of the Grey and Black friars, which they pillaged in an
instant: The Carthusians underwent the same fate; and the populace, not
content with robbing and expelling the monks, vented their fury on the
buildings, which had been the recepticles of such abomination; and in a very
little time nothing but the walls of these stately edifices were left
standing. The inhabitants of Couper in Fife soon after imi∣tated the
example<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 121. Knox, p. 127.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars in Scotland.</NOTE> THE
Queen-regent, provoked at these violences, assembled an army, and
pre∣pared to chastise the rebels. She had about two thousand French under
her command, with a few Scotch troops; and being assisted with such of
the nobi∣lity as were well affected to her, she pitched her camp within ten
miles of Perth. Even the earl of Argyle, and the lord James Stuart, prior of
St. Andrew's, the Queen's natural brother, tho' deeply engaged with the
reformers, attended the regent in this enterprize, either because they blamed
the fury of the populace, or hoped by their influence and authority to mediate
some agreement between the parties. The congregation, on the other hand, made
preparations for defence; and being joined by the earl of Glencarne from the
West, and being countenanced by many of the nobility and gentry, they
appeared formidable from their numbers, as well as the zeal by which they were
animated. They sent an address to the re∣gent, <PB N="421" REF="22"/> where
they plainly insinuated, that if they were pursued to extremity, by the
cruel beasts, the churchmen, they would have recourse to foreign powers for
assistance; and they subscribed themselves her faithful subjects
in all things not repugnant to God▪ assuming, at the same time, the
name of the faithful con∣gregation of Christ Jesus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 129.</NOTE>. They applied to the nobility attending her,
and maintained, that their past violences were justified by the word of
God, which commands the godly to destroy idolatry, and all the monuments of
it; that tho' all civil authority was sacred, yet was there a great
difference between the autho∣rity and the persons who exercised it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 131.</NOTE>; and that it ought to be
considered, whe∣ther or not those abominations, called by the pestilent
papists, religion, and which they defend by fire and sword, be the true
religion of Christ Jesus. They re∣monstrated with such of the Queen's
army as had formerly embraced their party, and told them, 
<Q REND="inline">"That as they were already reputed traitors by
God, they should likewise be excommunicated from their society, and from
the participation of the sacraments of the church, which God by his mighty

lofty in their pretensions than the ancient hierarchy; and it was therefore
no wonder they were enraged against these latter as their rivals in

commenced that cant, hypocrisy, and fanaticism <PB N="422" REF="23"/> which
long infested that kingdom; and which, tho' now mollified by the lenity of
the civil power, is still ready to break out on all occasions.</P>
<P>THE Queen regent, finding such obstinate zeal in the
malecontents, was con∣tented to embrace the councils of Argyle and the prior of
St. Andrew's, and to form an accommodation with them. She was received into
Perth, which submit∣ted to her, on promising an indemnity of past
offences, and engaging not to leave any French garrison in the place. This
capitulation, it is pretended, was not exactly observed. Some of the
inhabitants were molested on account of the late violences; and some
companies of Scotch soldiers, supposed to be in French pay, were
quartered in the town; which step, tho' taken under a very plausible
pretext, was regarded by the congregation as an infraction of the treaty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 139.</NOTE>. It is asserted, that the regent, to
justify these measures, declared, that princes ought not to have their
promises too strictly urged upon them; nor was any faith to be kept with
heretics: And that for her part, could she find as good a colour of reason,
she would willingly bereave all these men of their lives and fortunes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Spotswood, p. 123.</NOTE>. But it is no way
likely, that such expressions dropt from this prudent and vir∣tuous
princess. On the contrary, it appears, that these violences were very
dis∣agreeable to her; that she was in this particular over-ruled by the
authority of the French counsellors placed about her; and that she often
thought, if the manage∣ment of these affairs had been entrusted wholly to
herself, she could easily, with∣out force, have accommodated all
differences<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 146. Melvil, p. 29.
Knox, p. 225, 228. Lesly, lib. x. That there was re∣ally no violation of the
capitulation of Perth, appears from the manifesto of the congregation in
Knox, p. 184. where it is not so much as pretended. The companies of Scotch
soldiers were, probably, in Scotch pay, since the congregation complains,
that the country was oppressed with taxes to maintain armies. Knox, p. 164,
165. And even if they had been in French pay, it were no breach of the
capitu∣lation, since they were national troops, not French Knox does not
say, p. 139, that any of the inhabitants of Perth were tried or punished
for their past offences; but only that they were oppressed with the
quartering of soldiers: And the congregation in their manifesto, say only
that many of them had fled for fear. This plain detection of the calumny with
regard to the breach of the capitulation of Perth, may make us suspect a
like calumny with regard to the promise pretended not to give sentence
against the ministers. The affair lay altogether between the regent and the
laird of Dun; and that gentle∣man, tho' a man of sense and character, might
be willing to take some general professions for promise. If the Queen,
over awed by the power of the congregation, gave such a promise, in order
to have li∣berty to proceed to a sentence; how could she expect to have
power to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a sentence so
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> obtained. And to what
purpose could it serve?</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE congregation enflamed with their own zeal, and enraged with
these dis∣appointments, remained not long in tranquillity. Even before they
left Perth, <PB N="423" REF="24"/> and while as yet they had no colour to
complain of any violation of treaty, they had signed a new covenant, in
which, besides their engagements to mutual de∣fence, they vowed in the name
of God to employ their whole power in destroying every thing that
dishonoured his holy name; and this covenant was subscribed, among
others, by Argyle and the prior of St. Andrew's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith,
p. 89. Knox, p. 138.</NOTE>. These two leaders now desired no better
pretext for deserting the regent and openly joining their associates,
than the complaints, however doubtful, or rather false, of her breach of
promise. The congregation also, encouraged by this accession of force,
gave up themselves entirely to the furious zeal of Knox, and renewed at
Crail, An∣struther, and other places in Fife, like depredations on the
churches and mona∣steries with those formerly committed at Perth and
Couper. The regent, who marched against them with her army, finding their
power so much increased, was glad to conclude a truce for a few days, and
to pass over with her forces to the Lothians. The insurgents besieged and
took Perth; proceeded thence to Stirling, where they exercised their usual
sury; and finding nothing able to resist them, they bent their march to
Edinburgh, the inhabitants of which, as they had already anticipated the zeal
of the congregation against the churches and monasteries, gladly opened
their gates to them. The regent, with the few forces which remained with her,
took shelter in Dunbar, where she shut herself up, in expectation of a
reinforcement from France.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, she employed her partizans in representing to the
people the dangerous consequences of this open rebellion; and she
endeavoured to convince them, that the lord James, under pretence of religion,
had formed the scheme of wresting the scepter from the hands of the
sovereign. By these considerations many were engaged to desert the army
of the congregation; but much more by the want of pay or any means of
subsistance; and the regent, observing the in∣surgents to be much
weakened, ventured to march to Edinburgh, with a design to suppress them.
On the interposal of the duke of Chatelraut, who still adhered to her,
she agreed to a capitulation, in which she granted them a toleration of
their religion, and they engaged to commit no farther depredations on the
churches. Soon after they evacuated the city of Edinburgh; and before they left
it, they proclaimed the articles of agreement; but they took care to publish
only the articles favourable to themselves, and they were guilty of an
imposture, in adding one to the number, viz. that idolatry shall not again
be erected in any place where it was at that time suppressed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 153, 154, 155. This author pretends that
this article was agreed to verbally, but that the Queen's s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bes omitted it in the treaty which was
signed. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is very
unlikely, or rather very absurd; and in the meantime it is allowed, that the
article is not in the treaty: Nor do the congregation in their subsequent
manifesto insist upon it. Knox, p. 184.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="25"/> AN agreement concluded, while men's minds
were in this disposition, could not be durable; and both sides
endeavoured to strengthen themselves as much as possible, against the
ensuing rupture, which appeared inevitable. The regent having got a
reinforcement of 1000 men from France, began to fortify Leith; and the
congregation seduced the duke of Chatelraut to their party, who had long
appeared inclined to them, and who was at last determined by the arrival of
his son, the earl of Arran, from France, where he had escaped many dangers,
from the jealousy, as well as bigotry, of Henry and the duke of Guise. More
French troops soon after disembarked under the command of La Brosse,
who was followed by the bishop of Amiens and three doctors of the Sorbonne.
These last were supplied with store of syllogisms, authorities,
citations, and scholastic arguments, which they intended to oppose to the
Scotch preachers, and which, they justly presumed, would acquire force, and
operate conviction on mens minds, by the influence of the French arms and
artillery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 134. Thuan. lib XXIV. c.

<P>THE constable Montmorency had always opposed the marriage of
the Queen of Scots with the dauphin, and had foretold, that, by forming such
close con∣nexions with Scotland, the antient league would be dissolved;
and the natives of that kingdom, jealous of a foreign yoke, would soon
become, instead of allies, attached by interest and inclination, the most
inveterate ene∣mies to the French dominion. But tho' the event seemed now to
have justi∣fied the prudence of that aged minister, it is not improbable,
considering the violence of the councils, by which France was governed, that
the insurrection was esteemed a favourable event; as affording a pretence
for sending over armies, for entirely subduing the country, for attainting
the rebels<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 139. Thuan. lib.
XXIV. c. 13.</NOTE>, and for preparing means thence to invade England, and
support Mary's title to the crown of that kingdom. The leaders of the
congregation, well acquainted with these views, were not insensible of
their danger, and saw that their only safety consisted in the vigour
and success of their measures. They were encouraged by the intelligence
received of the sudden death of Henry the second; and having passed an
act from their own authority, depriving the Queen dowager of the regency, and
ordering all the French troops to evacuate the kingdom, they collected forces
to put their edict in execution against them. They became masters again of
Edinburgh; but found themselves unable to keep long possession of
that city. <PB N="425" REF="26"/> Their tumultuary armies, assembled in
haste, and supported by no pay, soon separated themselves upon the
least disaster, or even any delay of success; and were incapable of
resisting such veteran troops as the French, who were also se∣conded
by some of the Scotch nobility, among whom the earl of Bothwel
dis∣tinguished himself. Hearing that the marquis of Elbeuf, brother to
the regent, was levying a new army against them in Germany, they thought
themselves ex∣cusable for applying, in this extremity, to the
assistance of England; and as the sympathy of religion, as well as
regard to national liberty, had now counter∣ballanced the antient animosity
against that kingdom, this measure was the result of inclination no
less than of interest<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Scotch lords in

take advantage of a like zeal in the protestants of Scotland; nor could any
doubt be entertained with regard to the justice of a measure, founded on
such evident ne∣cessity, and directed only to the ends of
self-preservation: That tho' a French war, attended with great expence,
seemed the necessary consequence of support∣ing the Scotch
malecontents, that power, if removed to the continent, could never be very
formidable; and a small disbursement at present would in the end be
found the greatest frugality: And that the domestic dissentions of
France, which every day augmented, together with the support of Philip, who,

and giving the command of it to Winter, she sent it to the Firth of Forth:
She named the young duke of Norfolk her lieutenant in the northern counties,
and assembled at Berwic an army of eight thousand men under the command
of lord Gray, war∣den of the east and middle marches. Tho' the court of
France, sensible of the danger, offered her to make immediate restitution

concluded a treaty of mutual defence with the congregation, which was to last

prepared for defence. The English army, rein∣forced by 5000 Scotch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol I. p. 256, 259.</NOTE>, sat down before Leith; and
after two skirmishes, in the former of which, the English had the
advantage, in the latter the French, they began to batter the town; and tho'
repulsed with considerable loss in a rash and ill conducted
assault, they reduced the garrison to great difficulties. Their
distress was augmented by two events; the dispersion by a storm of
d'Elbeuf's fleet, which carried a considerable army on board<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 223.</NOTE>, and the death of the Queen
regent, who expired about this time in the castle of Edinburgh; a woman
en∣dowed with all the capacity which shone forth in her family, but
possessed of much more virtue and moderation than appeared in the
conduct of the other branches of it. The French, who found it impossible to
subsist for want of provisions, and who saw that the English were
continually reinforced by new numbers, were obliged to capitulate. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th July.</NOTE> And the bishop of Valence

stipulated, that the French should, all of them, instantly evacuate
Scotland; that the King and Queen of France and Scotland should thenceforth
abstain from bearing the arms of England, or assuming the title of that

particular should be granted Elizabeth; and that commissioners should
meet to settle this point, or if they could not agree, that the King of Spain
should be arbiter be∣tween the crowns. Besides these stipulations,
which regarded England, some concessions were granted to the Scotch,
which the plenipotentiaries, in the name of the King and Queen of France and
Scotland, promised in the treaty with Eliza∣beth to observe; that an
amnesty should be published for all past offences; that none but
natives should be put into any office in Scotland; that the states should
name twenty-four persons, of whom the Queen of Scots should chuse
seven, and the states five, and in the hands of these twelve should the
whole administration be placed during that Queen's absence; and that Mary
should neither make peace nor war without consent of the states<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol XV. p. 593. Keith, p. 137. Spotswood, p.
147. Knox, p. 229.</NOTE>. In order to hasten the execution of this important
treaty Elizabeth sent ships, by which the whole French forces were
transported into their own country.</P>
<P>THUS all Europe saw, in the first transaction of this
reign, the genius and capacity of the Queen and her ministers. She
discerned at a distance the danger, <PB N="428" REF="31"/> which threatened
her; and took instantly vigorous measures to prevent it. Mak∣ing all the
possible advantages of her situation, she proceeded with celerity to a
decision; and was not diverted by any offers, negotiations, or
remonstrances of the French court. She stopped not till she had brought
the matter to a final issue; and had converted that very power, to which
her enemies trusted for her destruction, into her firmest support and
security. By exacting no improper conditions from the Scotch insurgents,
even during their greatest distress, she established an entire
confidence with them; and having cemented the union by all the tyes of
gratitude, interest and religion, she now possessed an influence
over them above what remained even with their native sovereign. The regard
which she acquired by this dextrous and spirited conduct, gave her every
where, abroad as well as at home, more authority than had attended her
sister, tho' supported by all the power of the Spanish monarchy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 354, 372. Jebb, vol. II. p.
452.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE subsequent measures of the Scotch reformers tended
still more to cement their union with England. Being entirely masters of
the kingdom, they made no farther ceremony or scruple, in fully effecting
their purpose. In the treaty of Edinburgh it had been agreed, that a
Parliament or convention should soon be assembled; and the leaders of
the Congregation, not waiting till the Queen of Scots should ratify that
treaty, thought themselves fully intitled, without the sovereign's
authority, immediately to summon a Parliament. The reformers presented a
petition to this assembly; where they are not contented with desiring the
establishment of their doctrine; they also apply for the punishment of
the catholics, whom they call vassals to the Roman harlot; and they
assert, that, amongst all the rabble of the clergy, such is their
expression, there is not one lawful minister; but that they are, all of
them, thieves and murderers; yea rebels and traitors to civil authority; and
therefore unworthy to be suffered in any re∣formed common-wealth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 237, 238.</NOTE>. The Parliament seem to
have been actuated by the same spirit of rage and persecution. After
ratifying a confession of faith, agree∣able to the new doctrines, they
passed a statute against the mass, and not only abolished it in all
the churches, but enacted, that whoever any where, either officiated in it or
was present at it, should be chastised, for the first offence, with
confiscation of goods, and corporal punishment, at the discretion of the
magi∣strate; for the second, with banishment; and for the third, with
loss of life<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 254.</NOTE>. A law was
also voted for abolishing the papal jurisdiction in Scotland: The
pres∣byterian form of discipline was settled, leaving only at first
some shadow of au∣thority <PB N="429" REF="32"/> to certain
ecclesiastics, whom they called superintendants. The prelates of the
antient faith appeared in order to complain of great injustice committed on
them by the invasion of their property, but the Parliament took no notice of
them; till at last, these ecclesiastics, tired with fruitless
attendance, departed the town. They were then cited to appear; and as no body
presented themselves, it was voted by the Parliament, that the
ecclesiastics were entirely satisfied, and found no reason of
complaint.</P>
<P>SIR James Sandilands, prior of St. John, was sent over to
France to obtain the ratification of these acts; but was very ill received by
the Queen, who absolutely denied the validity of a Parliament, summoned
without the royal consent; and she refused her sanction to these
statutes. But the protestants gave them∣selves little concern about their
Queen's refusal. They immediately put the sta∣tutes in execution: They
abolished the mass; they settled their ministers; they committed every
where furious devastations on the monasteries, and even on the churches,
which they thought to be profaned by idolatry; and esteeming the property of
the clergy lawful prey, they took possession, without ceremony, of the
far greater part of the ecclesiastical revenues. Their new preachers, who
had authority sufficient to incite them to war and insurrection, could not
restrain their rapacity; and fanaticism concurring with avarice, an
incurable blow was given to the papal authority in that country. The
protestant nobility and gentry, united by the consciousness of such
unpardonable guilt, alarmed for their new possessions, well acquainted
with the imperious character of the house of Guise, saw no safety for
themselves but in the protection of England; and they dis∣patched Morton,
Glencarne, and Ledington to express their sincere gratitude to the Queen
for her past favours, and to represent to her the necessity of
con∣tinuing them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French affairs.</NOTE> ELIZABETH had equal
reason to maintain an union with the Scotch prote∣stants; and soon found,
that the house of Guise, notwithstanding their past disap∣pointments,
had not laid aside the design of contesting her title, and subverting
her authority. Francis and Mary, whose councils were wholly directed by them,
refused to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh; and showed no disposition to
give her any satisfaction for that mortal injury and affront which they had
put upon her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so openly
assuming the title and arms of England. She was sensible of the danger
attending such pretensions; and it was with pleasure she heard of the
violent factions, which prevailed in the French government, and of the
opposi∣tion, which had arisen against the measures of the duke of
Guile. That ambi∣tious prince, supported by his four brothers, the cardinal
of Lorraine, the duke of Aumale, the marquis of Elbeuf, and the grand prior,
men no less ambitions <PB N="430" REF="33"/> than himself, had engrossed
all the authority of the crown; and as he was pos∣sessed of every
quality, which could command the esteem or seduce the affections of men,
there appeared no end of this acquisitions and pretensions. The
con∣stable Montmorency, who had long ballanced his credit, was deprived of
all power: The princes of the blood, the King of Navarre and his brother the
prince of Condé, were entirely excluded from offices and favour: The
Queen-mother herself, Catherine de Medicis, found her influence every day
declining. And as Francis, a young prince, infirm both in mind and body, was
wholly go∣verned by his spouse, who knew no law but the pleasure of her
uncles, men despaired of ever obtaining freedom from the dominion of that
aspiring family. It was the contests of religion, which first inspired
the French with courage openly to oppose their exorbitant authority.</P>
<P>THE theological disputes, first started in the north of
Germany, and next in Switzerland, countries at that time wholly illiterate, had
long ago penetrated into France; and as they were assisted by the general
discontents against the court and church of Rome, and by the zealous
spirit of the age, the proselytes to the new religion were secretly
encreasing in every province. Henry the second, in imitation of his father
Francis, had opposed the progress of the reformers; and tho' a prince
addicted to pleasure and society, he was transported by a vehemence, as
well as bigotry, which had little place in his predecessor's conduct.
Rigorous punishments had been inflicted on the most eminent of the
protestant party; and a point of honour seemed to have arisen, whether
the one sect could exer∣cise or the other suffer most barbarity. The
death of Henry put some stop to the persecutions; and the people, who had
admired the constancy of the new preachers, now heard with favour and
prepossession their arguments and doctrines. But the cardinal of
Lorraine, as well as his brother, who were possessed of the legal
authority, thought it their interest to support the established
religion; and when they revived the exercise of the penal statutes, they
necessarily engaged the malecontent princes and nobles in the protection of
the new religion. The King of Navarre, a man of mild dispositions, but of a
weak character, and the prince of Condé, who possessed many
heroic qualities, having declared themselves in favour of the protestants,
that sect acquired new force from their countenance; and the admiral de
Coligni, with his brother Andelot, no longer scrupled to declare themselves
openly of their communion. The integrity of the admiral, who was believed
sincere in his prosession, and his high renown both for valour and
conduct, for the arts of peace as well as of war, gave credit to the
resormers; and after a frustrated attempt of the malecontents to seize
the King's person at <PB N="431" REF="34"/> Amboise, of which Elizabeth had
probably some intelligence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 214.
Throemorton, about this time, unwilling to entrust to letters the great
secrets committed to him, obtained leave, under some pretext, to come over
to London.</NOTE>, every place was full of distraction, and matters
hastened to an extremity between the parties. But the house of Guise,
tho' these factions had obliged them to remit their efforts in Scotland, and
had been one chief cause of Elizabeth's success, were determined not to
relinquish their authority in France, or yield to the violence of their
anta∣gonists. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 December.</NOTE> They found an opportunity
to seize the King of Navarre and the prince of Conde; they threw the former
into prison; they obtained a sentence of death against the latter;
<MILESTONE N="1561" UNIT="year"/> and they were proceeding to put the
sentence in execution, when the King's sudden death saved the noble
prisoner, and interrupted the prosperity of the duke of Guise. The
Queen-mother was appointed regent to her son Charles the ninth, now in his
minority: The King of Navarre was named lieutenant∣general of the kingdom: The
sentence against Condé was annulled: The con∣stable was recalled
to court: And the family of Guise, tho' they still enjoyed great offices,
and great power, now found a counterpoise to their authority.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was not dissatisfied to learn, that her avowed
enemies had met with so severe a check, and she was determined to make
advantage of it against the Queen of Scots, whom she still regarded as a
dangerous rival. She saw her∣self freed from the perils attending an union
of Scotland with France; and was pleased to find, that so powerful a prince
as the French monarch was no longer a pretender to her crown and kingdoms. But
she considered, on the other hand, that the English catholics, who were
very numerous, and who were generally prejudiced in favour of Mary's title,
would now adhere to that princess with more zealous attachment, when they
saw, that her succession no longer endan∣gered the liberties of the
kingdom, and was rather attended with the advantages of producing an entire
union with Scotland. She gave orders, therefore, to her ambassador,
Throcmorton, a very vigilant and able minister, to renew his ap∣plications to
the Queen of Scots, and to require her ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh.
But tho' Mary had desisted, after her husband's death, from bear∣ing the
arms and title of Queen of England, she still declined gratifying
Eliza∣beth in this momentous article; and hearkening too much to the ambitious
sug∣gestions of her uncles, she refused to make any formal renunciation
of her pre∣tensions.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Queen-mother of France, who imputed to Mary all
the mor∣tifications which she had met with during Francis's life-time, took
care to retaliate on her by like injuries; and the Queen of Scots, who found
her abode in France <PB N="432" REF="35"/> disagreeable, began to think of
returning into her native country. Lord James, who had been sent in
deputation from the states to invite her over, seconded this intention; and
she applied to Elizabeth, by D'Oisel, for liberty to pass thro'
England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. I. p. 175.</NOTE>. But she
received for answer, that till she had given satisfaction, by ratifying
the treaty of Edinburgh, she could expect no favour from a person whom
she had so much injured. This denial excited her resentment; and she
made no scruple of expressing her sentiments to Throcmorton, when he
re∣iterated his applications to gratify his mistress in a demand, which he
represented as so reasonable. Having cleared the room of all her
attendants, she said to him, 
<Q REND="inline">"How weak I may prove, or how far a woman's
frailty may transport me, I cannot tell: However, I have no mind to have so
many witnesses of my in∣firmity as your mistress had at her audience of
my ambassador, D'Oisel. There is nothing disturbs me so much, as the
having asked, with so much im∣portunity, a favour which it was of no
consequence for me to obtain. I can, with God's leave, return to my own
country without her leave; as I came to France, in spite of all the
opposition of her brother, King Edward: Neither do I want friends, both able
and willing, to conduct me home, as they have brought me hither; tho' I was
desirous rather to make an experiment of her friendship than of the
assistance of any other person. I have often heard you say, that a
good correspondence between her and myself would conduce much to the
security and happiness of both our kingdoms: But were she well convinced
of this truth, she had hardly denied me so small a request. But,
perhaps, she bears a better inclination to my rebellious subjects than to
me, their sove∣reign, her equal in royal dignity, her near relation, and the
undoubted heir of her kingdoms. Besides her friendship, I ask nothing at
her hands: I neither trouble her, nor concern myself in the affairs of her
kingdom: Not that I am ignorant, that there are now in England a great many
malecontents, who are no friends to the present establishment. She is
pleased to upbraid me as a person little experienced in the world: I freely
own it; but age will cure that defect. However, I am old enough to acquit
myself honestly and cour∣teously to my friends and relations, and to
encourage no reports of her, which would misbecome a Queen and her
kinswoman. I would also say, by her leave, that I am a Queen as well as
she, and not altogether friendless: And, perhaps, I have as great a soul
too; so that methinks we should be upon a level in our treatment of each
other. As soon as I have consulted the states of my kingdom, I shall be
ready to give a reasonable answer; and I am the more intent on my journey,
that I may be able to make the quicker dispatch in this <PB N="433" REF="36"/>
affair. But she, it seems, intends to stop my journey; so that either
she will not let me give her satisfaction, or is resolved not to be
satisfied; perhaps, on purpose to keep up the disagreement betwixt us.
She has often reproached me with my being young; and I must be very young,
indeed, and as ill advised, to treat of matters of such great concern and
importance, without the advice of my Parliament. I have not been wanting in any
friendly offices to her; but she disbelieves or overlooks them. I could
heartily wish, that I was as near allied to her in affection as in blood: For
that, indeed, would be a most valuable alliance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caballa, p 374. Spotswood, p. 177.</NOTE>"</Q></P>
<P>SUCH a spirited reply, notwithstanding the obliging terms
interspersed in it, was but ill fitted to conciliate friendship between
these rival princesses, or cure those mutual jealousies which had
already taken place. Elizabeth equipped a fleet, under pretence of pursuing
pyrates, but probably with an intention of in∣tercepting the Queen of Scots in
her return homewards. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th August.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival of Mary in Scot∣land.</NOTE> Mary
embarked at Calais; and passing the English fleet in a fog, arrived
safely at Leith, attended by her three uncles, the duke of Aumale, the grand
prior, and the marquess of Elbeuf; together with the marquess of Damville,
and other French courtiers. This change of abode and situation was very
little agreeable to that princess. Besides the natural
prepossessions in favour of a country in which she had been educated
from her earliest infancy, and where she had borne so high a rank, she
could not forbear regreting her departure from among that people, so
celebrated for their humane and sociable disposition, and their
respectful attachment to their sovereign, and reflecting on the disparity
of the scene which lay before her. It is said, that after she was
embarked at Calais, she kept her eyes fixed on the coast of France, and
never turned them from that beloved object, till darkness fell, and
intercepted it from her view. She then ordered a couch to be spread for her
under the open air; and charged the pilot, that, if in the morning the land was
still in sight, he should awake her, and afford her one parting view of
that country in which all her affections were centered. The weather proved very
calm, so that the ship made little way in the night-time: And Mary had once
more an opportunity of seeing the French coast. She sat up on her couch,
and still looking towards the land, often repeated these words. 
<Q REND="inline">"Farewell, France, farewell; I shall never
see thee more<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 179. Jebb, vol. 11. p.
183.</NOTE>."</Q> The first aspect, however, of things in Scotland, was
more favourable, if not to her pleasure and happiness, at least to her
repose and security, than she had reason to apprehend. No sooner did
the <PB N="434" REF="37"/> French gallies appear off Leith, than people of all
ranks, who had long expect∣ed their arrival, flocked towards the shore, with
an earnest impatience to behold and receive their young sovereign. Some
were led by duty, some by interest, some by curiosity; and all combined
to express their attachment to her, and to insinuate themselves into her
confidence, during the commencement of her ad∣ministration. She had now
reached the nineteenth year of her age; and the bloom of her youth, and amiable
beauty of her person, were farther recommend∣ed by the affability of her
address, the politeness of her manners, and the ele∣gance of her genius.
Well accomplished in all the superficial, but engaging graces of a court,
she afforded, when better known, still more promising indi∣cations of her
character; and men prognosticated both humanity from her soft and obliging
deportment, and penetration from her taste in all the refined arts of
music, eloquence, and poetry<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Buchan. lib.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. And as the Scotch had
long been deprived of the presence of their sovereign, whom they once
despaired ever more to behold among them, her arrival seemed to give
universal satisfaction; and nothing ap∣peared about the court, but
symptoms of affection, joy, and festivity.</P>
<P>THE first measures which Mary embraced, confirmed all the
prepossessions which had been entertained in her favour. She followed
the advice which she had received in France from D'Oisel and the bishop
of Amiens, as well as her uncles; and gave her confidence entirely to the
leaders of the reformed party, who had greatest influence on the people, and
who, she found, were alone able to support her government. Her brother,
lord James, whom she soon after created earl of Murray, obtained the chief
authority; and after him, Liding∣ton, secretary of state, a man of great
sagacity, had a principal share in her confidence. By the vigour of these
mens measures she endeavoured to restore order and police into the
country, divided by public factions and private feuds; and that fierce and
intractable people, unacquainted with laws and obedience, seemed, for a time,
to submit peaceably to her gentle and prudent admini∣stration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigotry of the Scotch re∣formers.</NOTE> BUT
there was one circumstance which blasted all these promising
appearances, and bereaved Mary of that general favour which her manners and
conduct gave her just reason to expect. She was still a papist; and
tho' she published, soon after her arrival, a proclamation, requiring
every one to submit to the establish∣ed religion, the preachers, and
their adherents, could neither be reconciled to a person polluted with so
great an abomination, nor lay aside their jealousies of her future conduct.
It was with great difficulty she could obtain permission for mass 
<PB N="435" REF="38"/> in her own chappel; and had not the people apprehended,
that if she had here met with a refusal, she would instantly have
returned to France, the zealots never would have granted her even that small
indulgence. The cry was, 
<Q REND="inline">"Shall that idol be suffered again to be
erected within the realm?"</Q> It was asserted in the pulpit, that one
mass was more terrible than ten thousand armed men landed to invade the
kingdom<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Knox, p 287.</NOTE>: Lord Lindesey,
and the gentlemen of Fife, exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the idolater should die the death;"</Q>
such was their expression. One that carried tapers for the ceremony of
that worship, was attacked and insulted in the court of the palace. And if
the lord James, and some popular leaders, had not interposed, the most
dangerous uproar was justly apprehended, from the ungo∣verned fury of the
multitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p 284, 285, 287. Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swood, p. 179.</NOTE>. The usual
prayers in the churches were to this purpose: That God would turn her heart,
which was obstinate against him and his truth; or if his holy will be
otherwise, that he would strengthen the hearts and <HI>hands</HI> of the
elect, stoutly to oppose the rage of all tyrants<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith, p 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Nay, it was openly called in
question, whether that princess, being an idolater, was entitled to any
authority, even in civil matters<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
202.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE helpless Queen was every moment exposed to contumely,
which she bore with benignity and patience. Soon after her arrival she
dined in the castle of Edinburgh; and it was there contrived, that a boy of
six years should be let down from the roof, and should present her with
a bible, a psalter, and the keys of the castle. Lest she should be at
a loss to understand this insult on her as a papist, the whole
decorations expressed the burning of Corah, Dathan, and Abi∣ram, and other
punishments inflicted by God against idolatry<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 189.</NOTE>. The town coun∣cil of Edinburgh had the
assurance, from their own authority, to issue forth a proclamation,
banishing from their district, 
<Q REND="inline">"all the wicked rabble of antichrist the pope,
such as priests, monks, friars, together with adulterers and
forni∣cators<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>."</Q> And because the
privy-council suspended the magistrates for their insolence, the

inferred, that the Queen was engaged, by a sympathy of manners, to take
adulterers and fornicators un∣der her protection. It appears probable, that the
magistrates were afterwards re∣instated in their office, and that their
proclamation was confirmed<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Keith, p.
202.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT all the insolence of the people was nothing in
comparison of that which was exercised by the clergy and the preachers; and
they took a pride in vilify∣ing, even to her face, this amiable princess. The
assembly of the church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> amed 
<PB N="436" REF="39"/> an address, in which, after telling her, that her
mass was a bastard service of God, the fountain of all impiety, and the
source of every evil which abounded in the realm; they discovered their
expectations, that she would, ere this time, have preferred truth to her own
pre-conceived opinion, and have renounced her reli∣gion, which, they
assured her, was nothing but abomination and vanity. They said, that the
present abuses of government were so enormous, that if a speedy remedy
was not provided, God would not fail in his anger to strike the head and the
tail the disobedient prince and sinful people. They required, that severe
punishment should be inflicted on adulterers and fornicators; and they
concluded with demanding for themselves, some addition both of power and
property<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 311, 312.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE ringleader in all these insults on majesty was John
Knox, who possessed an uncontrouled authority in the church, and even
in the civil affairs of the nation, and who triumphed in the contumelious
usage of his sovereign. His usual appellation for the Queen was Jezabel;
and tho' she endeavoured, by the most gracious con∣descension, to win
his favour, all her insinuations could gain nothing on his obdu∣rate heart.
She promised him access to her whenever he demanded it; and she even
desired him, if he found her blameable in any thing, to reprehend her freely
in private, rather than vilify her in the pulpit before all the people; but he
plain∣ly told her, that he had a public ministry entrusted to him, that if
she would come to church, she should there hear the gospel of truth,
and that it was not his business to apply to every individual, nor had he
leisure for that occupation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 310.</NOTE>. The
political principles of the man, which he communicated to his brethren, were as
full of sedition as his theological were of rage and bigotry. Tho' he once
condescended so far as to tell the Queen, that he would submit to her, in
the same manner that Paul did to Nero<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
288.</NOTE>; he remained not long in this dutiful strain. He said to her,
that 
<Q REND="inline">"Samuel feared not to slay Agag, the sat and
delicate King of Amalek, whom King Saul had saved: Neither spared Elias
Jezabel's false prophets, and Baal's priests, tho' King Ahab was present.
Phineas," added he, "was no magistrate; and yet feared he not to strike
Cosbie and Zimri in the very act of silthy fornication. And so, madam,
your grace may see, that others than chief magistrates may lawfully inflict
punishment on such crimes as are condemned by the law of God<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 326.</NOTE>."</Q> Knox had formerly, during
the reign of Mary of England, wrote a book against female succession to
the crown: The title of it is, <HI>The first blast of the trumpet against
the monstrous regi∣men of women.</HI> He was too proud either to recant the
tenets of this book, or <PB N="437" REF="40"/> even to apologize for them; and
his conduct shewed, that he thought no more civility than loyalty was due to
any of the female sex.</P>
<P>THE whole life of Mary, from the demeanour of these men, was
filled with bitterness and sorrow. This rustic apostle scruples not,
in his history, to inform us, that he once treated her with such
severity, that she lost all command of her temper, and dissolved into
tears before him: Yet so far from being moved with youth, and beauty, and
royal dignity reduced to that condition, he persevered in his insolent
reproofs; and when he relates this incident, he even discovers a visible
pride and satisfaction in his own conduct<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nox, p. 332, 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.</NOTE>. The pulpits had become nothing but scenes
of railing against the vices of the court; among which was always noted as
the principal, feasting, finery, dancing, balls, and whoredom their
ne∣cessary attendant<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 322.</NOTE>.
Some ornaments, which the ladies at that time wore upon their petticoats,
excited mightily the indignation of the preachers, and they af∣firmed, that
such vanity would provoke God's vengeance, not only against these
foolish women, but against the whole realm<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 330.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MARY, whose age, and condition, and education, invited her to
liberty and cheerfulness, was curbed in every amusement, by the absurd
severity of these re∣formers; and she found each moment reason to
regret her leaving that country from whose manners she had in her early
youth received the first impressions<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Her two uncles, the duke of Aumale, and the
grand prior, with the other French nobility, soon took their leave of her:
The marquess of Elbeuf remained some time longer; but after his departure,
she was left alone to the society of her own subjects; men at that time
unacquainted with the pleasures of conversation, ig∣norant of arts and
civility, and corrupted beyond their usual rusticity by a dismal
fanaticism, which rendered them uncapable of all humanity or improvement.
Tho' she had made no attempt to restore the ancient religion, her popery
was a sufficient crime: Tho' her behaviour was hitherto irreproachable, and
her man∣ners sweet and engaging, her gaiety and ease were interpreted as
signs of dissolute vanity. And to the harsh and preposterous usage
which this princess met with, may, in part, be ascribed those errors of
her subsequent conduct, which seemed to be so little of a piece with
the general tenor of her character.</P>
<P>THERE happened to the marquess of Elbeuf, before his
departure, an adven∣ture which, tho' frivolous, might enable him to give Mary's
friends in France, a very melancholy idea of her situation. This nobleman,
with the earl of Both∣wel, and some other young courtiers, had been engaged,
after a debauch, to pay a visit to a woman called Alison Craig, who was
known to be liberal of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣vours; <PB N="438" REF="41"/> and because they were denied
entrance, they broke the windows, thrust open the door, and committed some
disorders, in searching for the damsel. It happened that the assembly
of the church was sitting at that time, and they im∣mediately took the matter
under their cognizance. In conjunction with several of the nobility, they
presented an address to the Queen, which was introduced with this awful
prelude. 
<Q REND="inline">"To the Queen's majesty, and to her secret
and great coun∣cil, her grace's faithful and obedient subjects, the
professors of Christ Jesus's holy evangil wish the spirit of
righteous judgment."</Q> The tenor of the pe∣tition was, that the fear of God,
the duty which they owed her grace, and the terrible threatenings denounced by
God against every city or country where hor∣rible crimes are openly
committed, compelled them to demand the severe punish∣ment of such as had
done what in them lay to kindle the wrath of God against the whole realm:
That the iniquity of which they complained, was so heinous, and so
horrible, that they would esteem themselves accomplices in it, if they had
been engaged by worldly fear, or servile complaisance, to pass it over in
silence, or bury it in oblivion: That as they owed her grace obedience in the
administra∣tion of justice, so were they entitled to require of her, in
return, the sharp and condign punishment of this enormity, which, they
repeated it, might draw down the vengeance of God on the whole kingdom: And
that they insisted on it to be her duty to lay aside all private
affections towards the actors in this heinous crime and enormous villainy, and
without delay bring them to a trial, and inflict the severest penalties
upon them. The Queen gave a gracious reception to this pe∣remptory address;
but because she probably thought, that breaking the windows of a brothel
merited not such severe reprehension, she only replied, that her uncle
was a stranger, and that he was attended with a young company: But she
should put such order to him and to all others, that her subjects
should henceforth have no reason to complain. Her passing over this
incident so slightly, was the source of great discontent, and was
regarded as a proof of the most profligate man∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 30<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 303, 304. Keith, p. 509.</NOTE>. It
is not to be omitted, that Alison Craig, the cause of all the uproar, was
known to entertain a commerce with the earl of Arran, who, on account of his
great zeal for the reformation, was, without scruple, indulged in that
enor∣mity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Knox. Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME of the populace of Edinburgh broke into the Queen's chappel
during her absence, and committed some outrages; for which two of them were
indicted, and it was intended to bring them to a trial. Knox wrote circular
letters to the most considerable zealots of the party, and charged them to
appear in town, and protect their brethren. The holy sacraments, he there
said, are abused by pro∣phane <PB N="439" REF="42"/> papists; the mass
has been said; and in worshiping that idol, the priests have omitted no
ceremony, not even the conjuring of their accursed water, that had ever been
practised in the time of the greatest blindness. These violent
measures for opposing justice differed little from rebellion; and Knox
was summoned before the council to answer for his offence. The courage of
this man was equal to his insolence. He scrupled not to tell the Queen,
that the pestilent papists, who had enflamed her against these holy
men, were the sons of the devil; and must therefore obey the directions of
their father, who had been a liar and a man∣slayer from the beginning. The
matter ended with the full acquital of Knox<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox, p.
336, 342.</NOTE>. Randolf, the English ambassador in Scotland at this
time, had reason to write to Cecil, speaking of the Scotch nation: 
<Q REND="inline">"I think marvelously of the wisdom of God,
that gave this unruly, inconstant, and cumbersome people no more power nor
substance: For they would otherwise run wild<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 202.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>WE have related these circumstances at greater length, than
the necessity of our subject may seem to require: But even trivial
incidents, which show the manners of the age, are often more instructive,
as well as entertaining, than the great transactions of wars and
negotiations, which are pretty similar in all pe∣riods and in all countries
of the world.</P>
<P>THE reformed clergy in Scotland had, at that time, a very
natural reason for their ill humour, viz. the poverty or rather beggary to
which they were reduced: The nobility and gentry had at first laid their
hands on all the property of the regular clergy, without making any provision
for the friars and nuns, whom they turned out of all their possessions.
The secular clergy of the catholic com∣munion, tho' they lost all
ecclesiastical jurisdiction, still held some of the tempora∣lities of
their benefices; and either became laymen themselves, and converted them into
perpetual property, or made conveyance of them at low prices to the no∣bility,
who thus enriched themselves by the plunder of the church. The new teachers
had hitherto subsisted chiefly by the voluntary oblations of the
faithful; and in a poor country, divided in religious sentiments, this
establishment was regarded as very scanty and very precarious. Repeated
applications were made for a le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al
settlement to the preachers; and tho' almost every thing in the king∣dom
was governed by their zeal and caprice, it was with difficulty that their
re∣quest was at last complied with. The fanatical spirit which they
indulged, and then industry in decrying the principles and practices of the
Romish communion, which placed such a merit in enriching the clergy, proved
now a very sensible obstacle to their acquisitions. The boundaries of
the royal power were, during <PB N="440" REF="43"/> that age, more uncertain in
Scotland than even in England; and the privy coun∣cil alone thought
themselves intitled, without a Parliament, to regulate this im∣portant
matter. They passed a vote<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 296. Keith, p.
210.</NOTE>, by which they divided all the ecclesiastical benefices into
twenty one parts: They assigned fourteen to the antient possessors:
Of the remaining seven, they granted three to the crown; and if that was
found to answer the public expences, they bestowed the overplus on the
reformed mi∣nisters. The Queen was empowered to levy the whole seven; and
it was or∣dained, that she should afterwards pay to the clergy what
should be judged to suffice for their maintenance. The necessities of
the crown, the rapacity of the courtiers, and the small affection which Mary
bore the protestant ecclesiastics, rendered their revenues very
contemptible as well as uncertain; and the preachers, finding that they could
not rival the gentry, nor even the middling rank of men in opulence and plenty,
were necessitated to betake themselves to other expe∣dients for
supporting their authority. They affected a furious zeal for religion,
morose manners, a vulgar and familiar, and yet mysterious, cant; and tho'
the liberality of subsequent princes put them afterwards on a better
footing with re∣gard to revenue and thereby corrected in some degree these
vicious habits; it must be confessed, that, while many other advantages
attend presbyterian government, these inconveniencies are not easily
separated from the genius of that ecclesiastical polity.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots, destitute of all force, possessing
a narrow revenue, surrounded with a factious turbulent nobility, a bigoted
people, and insolent ecclesiastics, soon found, that her only expedient
for maintaining tranquillity was to preserve a good correspondence with 
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 456.</NOTE>
Elizabeth, who by former engagements and services, had acquired such
authority over all these ranks of men. Soon after her arrival in Scotland,
secretary Lidington was sent to London, in order to pay her compliments to
the Queen, and express her desire of friendship and a good
correspondence; and he received a commission from her, as well as from
the Scotch nobility, to demand, as a means of cementing this friendship, that
Mary should, by act of Parliament or by Proclamation (for the difference
be∣tween these securities was not then esteemed very considerable) be
declared successor to the crown. No request could be more
unreasonable, or made at a more improper juncture. The Queen replied, that
Mary had once discovered her intention not to wait for the succession,
but had openly, without ceremony or reserve, assumed the title of Queen
of England, and had pretended superior right to her throne and kingdom: That
tho' her ambassadors, and those of her husband, the French King, had
signed a treaty, where they renounced that claim, and promised
satis∣faction for so great an indignity, she was so intoxicated with
this imaginary <PB N="441" REF="44"/> right, that she had rejected the most
earnest sollicitations, and even, as some endeavoured to persuade her,
incurred some danger in crossing the seas, rather than ratify that
equitable treaty: That her partizans every where had still the assurance
to insist on her title, and had presumed to talk of her own birth as
spurious and illegitimate: That while affairs were on this footing; while a
claim thus openly made, so far from being openly renounced, was only
suspended till a more convenient opportunity; it would in her be the most
egregious impru∣dence to fortify the hands of a pretender to her crown, by
declaring her the suc∣cessor: That no expedient could be worse imagined
for cementing friendship than such a declaration, and Kings were often
sound to bear no good will to their suc∣cessors, even tho' their own
children; much more when the connexion was so much less intimate, and when
such cause of disgust and jealousy had already been given, and indeed
was still centinued, on the part of Mary: That tho' she was willing, from
the amity which she bore her kinswoman, to ascribe her former
pretensions to the advice of others, by whose direction she was then
governed; her refusal to relinquish them could proceed only from her own
prepossessions, and were a proof that she still retained some
dangerous project against her: That it was the nature of all men to be
disgusted with the present, to entertain flatter∣ing views of futurity,
to think their services ill rewarded, to expect a better recompence from the
successor; and she would esteem herself scarce half a
sove∣reign over the English, if they saw her declare her heir, and arm
her rival with authority against her own repose and safety: That she
knew the inconstant nature of the people; she was acquainted with the
present divisions in religion; she was not ignorant, that the same
party, which expected greatest favour during the reign of Mary, did also
imagine, that the title of that princess was superior to her own: That for
her part, whatever claims were advanced, she was determined to live and die
Queen of England; and after her death, it was the business of others to
examine who had the best pretensions, either by the laws or by right of
blood, to the succession: That she hoped the Queen of Scots's claim
would then be found preserable; and considering the injury, which she
herself had re∣ceived, it was sufficient indulgence, if she premised,
in the mean time, to do nothing which might, in any respect, weaken or
invalidate that claim: And that Mary, if her title was really superior, a
point, which, for her own part, she had never enquired into,
possessed all advantages above her rivals; who, destitute both of
present power, and of all support by friends, would only expose
them∣selves to inevitable ruin, by advancing any weak, or even doubtful
pretensions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. XVII. c. 14-17.
Camden. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="45"/> THESE views of the Queen were so prudent
and judicious, that there was no likelihood of her ever departing from them:
But that she might put the matter to a fuller proof, she offered to explain
the words of the treaty of Edinburgh, so as to leave no suspicion of
their excluding Mary's right of succession<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 181.</NOTE>; and in this form, she again
required her to ratify that treaty. Matters at last came to this issue,
that Mary agreed to the proposal, and offered to renounce all present
pre∣tensions to the crown of England, provided Elizabeth would agree to
declare her the successor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol. I.
p. 377.</NOTE>. But such was the jealous character of this latter princess,
that she never would consent to strengthen the interest and authority
of any claimant, by fixing the succession; much less would she make
this concession in favour of a rival Queen, who possessed such
plausible pretensions for the present, and who, tho' she might verbally
resign them, could easily resume her title on the first op∣portunity.
Mary's demand, however, bore so specious an appearance of equity and
justice, that Elizabeth, sensible that reason would be deemed to lie
entirely on that side, made no more mention of the matter; and tho' no
farther conces∣sions were made by either Princess, they put on all the
appearances of a cordial reconcilement and friendship with each other. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wise govern∣ment of Eliza∣beth.</NOTE> The
Queen observed, that, even without her interposal, Mary was sufficiently
depressed by the mutinous disposition of her own subjects; and
instead of giving Scotland, for the present, any un∣quietude or
disturbance, she employed herself, much more usefully and laudably, in
regulating the affairs of her own kingdom, and promoting the happiness of her
people. She made some progress in paying those great debts which lay upon
the crown: she regulated the coin, which had been extremely debased by her
prede∣cessors; she furnished her arsenals with great quantities of
arms from Germany and other places; engaged her gentry and nobility to imitate
her example in this parti∣cular; introduced into the kingdom the art of making
gun-powder and brass can∣non; fortified her frontiers on the side of
Scotland; made frequent reviews of the militia; encouraged agriculture by
allowing a free exportation of corn; promoted trade and navigation; and so
much encreased the shipping of her kingdom, both by building vessels of
force herself, and suggesting like undertakings to the mer∣chants, that
she was justly stiled the restorer of naval glory, and the Queen of the
northern seas<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 388. Strype, vol. I.
p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>. The natural
frugality of her temper, so far from disqualify∣ing her for these great
enterprizes, only enabled her to execute them with greater certainty and
success; and all the world saw in her conduct the happy effects of a
vigorous perseverance in judicious and well conducted projects.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="46"/> IT is easy to imagine, that so great a
princess, who enjoyed such felicity and renown, would receive proposals
of marriage from every one, who had any like∣lihood of succeeding; and tho'
she had made some public declarations in favour of a single life, few
believed, that she would persevere forever in that resolution. The
archduke Charles, second son to the emperor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes,
vol. I. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>, as well as
Casimir, son to the elector palatine, made applications to her; and as this
latter prince made profession of the reformed religion, he thought
himself, on this account, better intitled to succeed in his addresses.
Eric, King of Sweden, and Adolph, duke of Holstein, were encouraged by the
same views to become suitors; and the earl of Arran, heir to the crown of
Scotland, was, by the states of that kingdom, recommended to her as a
suitable marriage. Even some of her own subjects, tho' they did not
openly declare their pretensions, entertained hopes of success. The earl
of Arundel, a per∣son declining in years, but descended from a very antient
and noble family, as well as possessed of great riches, flattered
himself with this prospect; as did also Sir Wil∣liam Pickering, a man
much esteemed for his personal merit. But the person most likely to
succeed, was a younger son of the late duke of Northumberland, the lord
Robert Dudley, who, by means of his exterior qualities, joined to address and
flattery, had become, in a manner, her declared favourite, and had great
influence in all her councils. The less worthy he appeared of this
distinction, the more was his great favour ascribed to some violent
affection, which could thus seduce the judgment of this penetrating
princess; and men long expected, that he would obtain the preference above
so many princes and monarchs. But the Queen gave all these suitors a
gentle refusal, which still encouraged their pursuit; and she thought,
that she should the better attach them to her interests, if they were
still allowed to entertain hopes of succeeding in their pretensions. It
is also probable, that this policy was not entirely free from a mixture of
female coquetry; and that, tho' she was determined in her own mind never to
share her power with any man, she was not displeased with the
courtship, sollicitation, and professions of love, which the desire
of acquiring so valuable a prize, procured her from all quarters.</P>
<P>WHAT is most singular in the conduct and character of
Elizabeth, is, that, tho' she was determined never to have any heir of her
own body, she was not only extremely averse to six any successor to
the crown; but seems also to have resolved, as far as lay in her power,
that no one, who had pretensions to the succession, should ever have
any heirs or successors. After the exclusion given by 
<PB N="444" REF="47"/> the will of Henry VIII. to the posterity of Margaret,
Queen of Scotland, the right to the crown devolved on the house of Suffolk;
and the lady Catherine Gray, younger sister to the lady Jane, was now the
heir of that family. This lady had been married to the lord Herbert, son to
the earl of Pembroke; but having been divorced from that nobleman, she had
entered into a private contract with the earl of Hartford, son to the
protector; and her husband, soon after consummation, travelled into
France. In a little time she appeared to be preg∣nant, which so enraged
Elizabeth, that she threw her into the Tower, and sum∣moned him to appear,
in order to answer for his misdemeanor. He made no scruple to acknowlege
the marriage, which, tho' concluded without the Queen's consent, was entirely
suitable to both parties; and for this offence he was also committed to the
Tower. Elizabeth's severity stopped not here: She issued a
commission to enquire into the matter; and as Hartford could not, within
the time limited, prove the nuptials by witnesses, their commerce was
declared un∣lawful, and their posterity illegitimate. They were still
continued in custody; but by bribing their keepers, they found means to have
farther intercourse; and another child appeared to be the fruit of their
commerce. This was a fresh source of vexation to the Queen; who made a fine
of fifteen thousand pounds be set on Hartford by the Star-Chamber, and
ordered his confinement to be thenceforth still more rigid and severe. He
lay in this condition for nine years, till the death of his wife, by freeing
Elizabeth from all fears, procured him his liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol. I. p. 369, 378, 396. Camden, p. 389. Heylin, p.
154.</NOTE>. This extreme severity must be accounted for, either by the
unrelenting jealousy of the Queen, who was afraid that any pretender to the
succession would acquire credit by having issue; or by her malignity,
which, with all her great qualities, made one ingredient in her character, and
which led her to envy in others those natural pleasures of love and
posterity, of which her own ambition and desire of dominion made her
renounce all prospect for herself.</P>
<P>THERE happened, about this time, some other events in the
royal family, where the Queen's conduct was more laudable. Arthur Pole, and his
brother, nephews to the late cardinal, and descended from the duke of
Clarence, brother to Edward the fourth, together with Anthony Fortescue, who
had married a sister of these gentlemen, and some other persons, were
brought to their trial for conspiring to withdraw into France, with a view of
receiving succours from the duke of Guise, of returning thence into Wales,
and proclaiming Mary Queen of England, and Arthur Pole duke of Clarence. They
confessed the indictment, <PB N="445" REF="48"/> but asserted, that they
never intended to execute these projects during the Queen's life-time: They
had only esteemed such precautions requisite in case of her death,
which, some pretenders to judicial astrology had assured them, they
might with certainty look for before the year expired. They were condemned by
the jury; but received their pardon from the Queen's clemency<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 333. Heylin, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1562" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Eu∣rope.</NOTE> AFTER the
commencement of the religious wars in France, which ren∣dered that
flourishing kingdom, during the course of near forty years, a scene of
horror and devastation, the great rival powers in Europe were Spain and
England; and it was not long before an animosity, first political, then
personal, broke out between the sovereigns of these countries.</P>
<P>PHILIP the second of Spain, tho' he reached not any enlarged
views of policy, was endowed with great industry and sagacity, a remarkable
caution in his enter∣prizes, an unusual foresight in all his measures;
and as he was ever cool and un∣moved by passion, and possessed
neither talents nor inclination for war, both his subjects and his neighbours
had reason to expect great justice, happiness and tran∣quillity, from his
administration. But prejudices had on him a more pernicious ef∣fect than ever
passions had on any other monarch; and the spirit of bigotry and tyranny,
by which he was actuated, with the fraudulent maxims which governed his
councils, excited the most violent agitation among his own people, engaged
him in acts of the most enormous cruelty, and threw all Europe into
combustion.</P>
<P>AFTER Philip had concluded peace at Cambray, and had remained
some time in the Netherlands, in order to settle the affairs of that
country, he embarked for <PB N="446" REF="49"/> Spain; and as the gravity of
that nation, with their respectful obedience to their prince, had appeared
much more agreeable to his humour, than the homely fa∣miliar manners, and the
pertinacious liberty of the Flemish, it was expected, that he would reside
altogether at Madrid, and govern all his extensive dominions by Spanish
ministers and Spanish councils. Having met with a violent tempest on his
voyage, he no sooner arrived in harbour, than he fell on his knees, and after
giving thanks for this deliverance, he vowed, that his life, which was thus
providentially saved, should be thenceforth entirely dedicated to the
extirpation of heresy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. xxiii. cap. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. His subsequent conduct
corresponded to these professions. Finding that the new doctrines had
penetrated into Spain, he let loose the rage of perse∣cution against all
who professed them, or were suspected of adhering to them; and by his
violence he gave new edge, even to the unrelenting cruelty of priests and
in∣quisitors. He committed to custody Constantine Ponce, who had been
confessor to his father, the emperor Charles; who had attended him during
his retreat; and in whose arms that great monarch had terminated his life:
And after this ec∣clesiastic died in prison, he still ordered him to be
tried and condemned for here∣sy, and his statue to be committed to the
flames. He even deliberated, whether he should exercise like severity
against the memory of his father, who was suspect∣ed, during his latter
years, to have indulged a propensity towards the Lutheran principles: In his
furious zeal for orthodoxy, he spared neither age, sex, nor condition: He
was present, with an inflexible countenance, at the most barbar∣ous
executions: He issued rigorous orders for the prosecution of heretics, in
Spain, Italy, the Indies, and the Low Countries: And having founded his
de∣termined tyranny on maxims of civil policy, as well as on principles of
religion, all his subjects saw, that there was no method, except the most
entire compliance, or most obstinate resistance, to escape or elude
the severity of his vengeance.</P>
<P>DURING that extreme animosity which prevailed between the
adherents of the opposite religions, the civil magistrate, who found it
difficult, if not impossible, for the same laws to govern such enraged
adversaries, was naturally led by speci∣ous rules of prudence, in embracing
one party, to declare war against the other, and to exterminate, by fire and
sword, those bigots, who, from abhorrence of his religion, had proceeded to
an opposition of his power, and to an hatred of his person. If any prince
possessed such enlarged views as to foresee, that a mu∣tual
toleration would in time abate the fury of religious prejudices, he yet met
with difficulties in reducing this principle to practice; and might deem the
ma∣lady too violent to await a remedy, which, tho' certain, must
necessarily be slow in its operations. But Philip, tho' a profound
hypocrite, and extremely govern∣ed <PB N="447" REF="50"/> by self-interest,
seems also to have been himself actuated by an imperious bi∣gotry; and as
he employed great reflection in all his conduct, he could easily palliate the
gratification of his natural temper under the colour of wisdom, and find in
this system no less advantage to his foreign than his domestic
politics. By placing himself at the head of the catholic party, he converted
the zealots of the ancient faith into partizans of the Spanish greatness;
and by employing the pow∣erful allurement of religion, he seduced every where
the subjects from that allegi∣ance which they owed their native
sovereign.</P>
<P>THE course of events, guiding and concurring with choice, had
placed Eli∣zabeth in a situation diametrically opposite; and had raised
her to be the glory, the bulwark, and the support of the numerous, tho'
still persecuted protestants, throughout all Europe. More moderate in her
temper than Philip, she found, with pleasure, that the principles of her
sect required not such extreme severity in her domestic government, as
was exercised by that monarch; and having no object but
self-preservation, she united her interests in all foreign negociations
with those who were every where struggling under oppression, and
guarding themselves against ruin and extermination. The more virtuous
sovereign was thus happily thrown into the more favourable cause; and
fortune, in this in∣stance, concurred with policy and nature.</P>
<P>DURING the life-time of Henry the second and his
successor, the force of these principles was somewhat restrained,
tho' not altogether overcome, by the mo∣tives of a superior interest; and
the dread of uniting England with the French monarchy, engaged Philip to
maintain a good correspondence with Elizabeth. Yet even during this period he
rejected the garter which she sent him; he refused to ratify the ancient
league between the house of Burgundy and England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Compleat

ships to transport the French forces into Scotland; he endeavoured to
intercept the earl of Arran, who was hastening to join the malecontents in
that country; and the Queen's wisest ministers still regarded his
friendship as hollow and precarious<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Haynes,
vol. I. p. 280, 281, 283, 284.</NOTE>. But no sooner did the death of Francis
the second put an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to Philip's
apprehensions with regard to Mary's succession, than his animos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> against Elizabeth began more openly
to appear, and the interests of Spain and England were found opposite in
every negociation and transaction.</P>
<P>THE two great monarchies of the continent, France and Spain,
being possessed of nearly equal force, were naturally antagonists;
and England, from its power and situation, was intitled to support its own
dignity, as well as tranquill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, by
<PB N="448" REF="51"/> holding the ballance between them. Whatever incident,
therefore, tended too much to depress any one of these rival powers, as it
left the other without con∣troul, might be deemed contrary to the interest of
England: Yet so much were these great maxims of policy over-ruled, during
that age, by the disputes of theology, that Philip found an advantage in
supporting the established govern∣ment and religion of France; and
Elizabeth in protecting faction and inno∣vation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of France.</NOTE> THE Queen-regent
of France, when re-instated in authority by the death of her son, Francis,
had formed a plan of administration more subtile than judi∣cious; and
ballancing the Catholics with the Hugonots, the duke of Guise with the prince
of Condé, she endeavoured to render herself necessary to both,
and to establish her own dominion on their constrained obedience<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. ii.</NOTE>. But the equal
coun∣terpoise of power, which, among foreign nations, is the source of
tranquillity, proves always the ground of quarrel between domestic factions;
and if the ani∣mosity of religion concur with the frequent occasions which
present themselves of mutual injury, it is impossible, during any time,
to preserve a firm concord in so delicate a situation. The constable,
Montmorency, moved by concern for the ancient faith, joined himself to the
duke of Guise: The King of Navarre, from his inconstant temper, and his
jealousy of the superior genius of his brother, embraced the same party:
And Catherine, finding herself depressed by this com∣bination, had
recourse to Condé and the hugonots, who gladly embraced the
opportunity of fortifying themselves by her countenance and protection<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. iii.</NOTE>. An edict had been published, granting a
toleration to the protestants; but the inter∣ested violence of the duke of
Guise, covered with the pretence of religious zeal, broke thro' this
agreement; and the two parties, after the fallacious tranquillity of a moment,
renewed their mutual insults and injuries. Condé, Coligni, An∣delot,
assembled their friends, and flew to arms: Guise and Montmorency got
possession of the King's person, and constrained the Queen-regent
to embrace their party: Fourteen armies were levied and put in action in
different places of France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib.
vii.</NOTE>: Each province, each city, each family, was agitated with
intestine rage and animosity. The father was divided against the son;
the brother against the brother; and women themselves, sacrificing their
humanity as well as their timidity to the religious fury, distinguished
themselves by acts of ferocity and valour<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Wherever the hugonots prevailed, the images were
broke, the altars pillaged, the churches demolished, the monasteries
consumed with fire: Where success attended the catholics, they burned the
bibles, re-baptized the infants, <PB N="449" REF="52"/> constrained married
persons to pass anew thro' the ceremony: And plunder, de∣solation, and
bloodshed attended equally the triumph of both parties. The Par∣liament of
Paris itself, the seat of law and justice, instead of employing its
au∣thority to compose these fatal quarrels, published an edict, by which
it put the sword into the hands of the enraged multitude, and empowered the
catholics every where to massacre the hugonots<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. vii. Haynes, p 391.</NOTE>: And it was during
this period, when men began to be somewhat enlightned, and in this nation,
renowned for polish∣ed manners, that the theological rage, which had long
been boiling in mens veins, seems to have attained its last stage of
virulence and ferocity.</P>
<P>PHILIP, who was jealous of the progress which the hugonots
made in France, and who dreaded that the contagion would spread into the
Low-Country Provinces, had formed a secret alliance with the princes of
Guise, and had entered into a mu∣tual concert for the protection of the
ancient faith, and the suppression of heresy. He now sent six
thousand men, with some supply of money, to reinforce the ca∣tholic
party; and the prince of Condé, finding himself unequal to so great
a com∣bination, countenanced by the regal authority, was obliged to dispatch
the Vi∣dame of Chartres and Briguemaut to London, in order to crave the
assist∣ance and protection of Elizabeth. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Havre de Grace put in possession of
the English.</NOTE> Most of the province of Normandy was possessed
by the hugonots; and Condé offered to put Havre de Grace into the hands
of the English; on condition, that, together with three thousand men for
the garrison of that place, the Queen should likewise send over three
thousand to defend Dieppe and Rouen, and should furnish the prince with a
supply of a hun∣dred thousand crowns<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vol. II. p
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, besides the general and essential interest of
supporting the pro∣testants, and opposing the rapid progress of her
enemy, the duke of Guise, had other motives which engaged her to accept this
proposal. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Septem∣ber.</NOTE> When she concluded
the peace at Cateau Cambresis, she had good reason to foresee, that
France ne∣ver would voluntarily fulfil the article with regard to the
restitution of Calais; and many subsequent incidents had tended to
confirm this suspicion. Consider∣able sums of money had been laid out
on the fortifications; long leases had been granted of the lands; and many
inhabitants had been encouraged to build and settle there, by assurances
that Calais should never be restored to the English<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p. 54,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>57.</NOTE>. The Queen, therefore,
very wisely concluded, that could she get possession of Havre, a
place which commanded the mouth of the Seine, and was of much greater
importance than Calais, she would easily constrain the French to execute 
<PB N="450" REF="53"/> the treaty, and would have the glory of restoring to
the crown that ancient pos∣session, which was so much the favourite
of the nation.</P>
<P>NO measure could be more generally odious in France, than the
conclusion of this treaty with Elizabeth. Men were naturally led to compare
the conduct of Guise, who had finally chased the English from France, and
had barred these dangerous and destructive enemies from all access into
it, with the treasonable po∣litics of Condé, who had again granted
them an entry into the heart of the king∣dom. The prince had the more reason
to repent of this measure, that he reaped not from it all the advantage which
he expected. Three thousand English im∣mediately took possession of
Havre and Dieppe, under the command of Sir Ed∣ward Poinings; but the latter
place was found so little capable of being defend∣ed, that it was immediately
abandoned<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II. p. 199.</NOTE>. The
siege of Rouen was already formed by the catholics, the command of the King
of Navarre and the constable Montmorency; and it was with difficulty that
Poinings could throw a small reinforcement into the place. Tho' these
English troops behaved with great gallantry<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 161.</NOTE>, and the King of Navarre was mortally wounded
during the siege; the catholics still continued the attack of the place,
and carrying it at last by as∣sault, put the whole garrison to the
sword. The earl of Warwic, eldest son to the late duke of Northumberland,
arrived soon after at Havre, with another body of three thousand English,
and took on him the command of the place.</P>
<P>IT was expected, that the French catholics, flushed with their
success at Rouen, would immediately have formed the siege of Havre, which
was not as yet in any condition of defence; but the intestine disorders of
the kingdom soon diverted their attention to another enterprize. Andelot,
seconded by the negociations of Elizabeth, had levied a considerable body
of protestants in Germany; and having arrived at Orleans, the seat of the
hugonots' power, he enabled the prince of Condé and the admiral to take
the field, and oppose the progress of their ene∣mies. After threatening
Paris during some time, they took their march towards Normandy, with a view
of engaging the English to act in conjunction with them, and of fortifying
themselves with the farther assistance which they expected from the
zeal and vigour of Elizabeth<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 230.
Davila, llb. iii.</NOTE>. The catholics, commanded by the constable, and
under him by the duke of Guise, followed on their rear; and overtaking them
at Dreux, obliged them to give battle. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of De∣cember.</NOTE> The field was fought
with great obstinacy on both sides; and the action was distinguished by
this signal event, that Condé and Montmorency, the commanders of the
opposite armies, remain∣ed both of them prisoners in the hands of their
enemies. The appearances of <PB N="451" REF="54"/> victory remained with
Guise; but the admiral, whose fate it ever was to be defeated, and still
to rise more terrible after his misfortunes, collected the remains of the
army, and inspiring his own unconquerable courage and constancy into every
breast, kept them in a body, and subdued some of the most
considerable places in Normandy. Elizabeth, the better to support his
cause, sent him a new supply of a hundred thousand crowns; and offered,
if he could find merchants to lend him the money, to give her bond for another
hundred thousand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II. p. 322,

<P><MILESTONE N="1563" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 January.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THE expences incurred by
assisting the French hugonots, had emptied the Queen's exchequer,
notwithstanding her extreme frugality; and in order to ob∣tain supply,
she found herself under a necessity of summoning a Parliament: An
expedient to which she never voluntarily had recourse. A little before the
meeting of this assembly, she had fallen into a dangerous illness, the
small-pox; and as her life, during some time, was despaired of, the
people became the more sensible of the perilous condition in which they
were placed, on account of the uncertainty which, in case of her decease,
attended the succession of the crown. The partizans of the Queen of Scots
and those of the house of Suffolk, already divided the nation into two
factions; and every one foresaw, that, tho' it might be possible at
present to determine the controversy by law, yet, if the throne was vacant,
nothing but the sword would be able to fix a successor. The commons,
there∣fore, on the very opening of the session, voted an address to the
Queen; in which, after enumerating the dangers attending a broken and doubtful
succession, and mentioning the evils which their fathers had experienced
from the contending titles of York and Lancaster, they entreated the Queen to
put an end to their ap∣prehensions, by choosing some husband, whom,
they promised, whoever he was, gratefully to receive, and faithfully to
serve, honour, and obey: Or if she had entertained any reluctance to the
married state, they desired, that the lawful suc∣cessor might be
named, or at least appointed by act of parliament. They remark∣ed, that
during all the reigns which had passed since the conquest, the nation
had never before been so unhappy, as not to know the person who, in case
of the sovereign's death, was legally entitled to the succession. And
they observed, that the certain and fixed order which took place in the
inheritance of the French monarchy, was one chief source of the usual
tranquillity, as well as of the hap¦piness of that kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir Simon Dewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s

<P>THIS subject, tho' extremely interesting to the nation, was
very little agree∣able to the Queen; and she was sensible, that great
difficulties would attend every decision. A declaration in favour of the
Queen of Scots, would form a settlement <PB N="452" REF="55"/> perfectly
legal; because that princess was commonly allowed to possess the
right of blood, and the exclusion given by Henry's will, deriving its weight
chiefly from an act of parliament, would lose all authority whenever the
Queen and Par∣liament had made a new settlement, and restored the
Scottish line to their place in the succession. But she dreaded the
giving encouragement to the catholics, her secret enemies, by this
declaration. She was sensible, that every heir was, in some degree, a
rival; much more one who possessed a claim for the present
pos∣session of the crown, and who had already advanced, in a very open
manner, these dangerous pretensions. The great power of Mary, both from the
favour of the catholic princes, and her connections with the house of
Guise, not to mention the force and situation of Scotland, was well known
to her; and she saw no security that that princess, if fortified by a
sure prospect of succession, would not again revive claims which
she could never yet be prevailed on formally to relinquish. On the other
hand, the title of the house of Suffolk was supported only by the more
zealous protestants; and it was very doubtful, whether even a parliamentary
declaration in its favour would bestow on it such validity as to give
satisfaction to the people. The republican part of the constitution had not
as yet acquired such an ascendant as to controul, in any degree, the ideas
of hereditary right; and as the legality of Henry's will was still
disputed, tho' founded on the utmost autho∣rity which a Parliament could
bestow; who could be assured, that a more recent act would be acknowleged
to have any greater force or validity? In the frequent revolutions which had of
late taken place, the right of blood had still prevailed over religious
prejudices; and the nation had ever shewed itself disposed rather to
change its faith than the order of succession. Even many Protestants
declared themselves in favour of Mary's claim of inheritance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>; and nothing would en∣danger more general disgust,
than to see the Queen openly, and without reserve, take party against it.
That princess also, finding herself injured in so sensible a point,
would thenceforth act as a declared enemy; and uniting together her fo∣reign
and domestic friends, the partizans of her present title and of her
eventual succession, would soon bring matters to extremity against
the public establish∣ment. The Queen, therefore, weighing all these
inconveniencies, which were great and urgent, was determined to keep both
parties in awe, by maintaining still an ambiguous conduct; and she chose
rather that the people should run the hazard of contingent events, than that
herself should visibly endanger her throne, by employing expedients,
which, at best, did not give entire security to the nation. She made,
therefore, an evasive answer to the applications of the com∣mons; and when
the house, at the end of the sessions, desired, by the mouth 
<PB N="453" REF="56"/> of their speaker, farther satisfaction on that head,
she could not be prevailed on to make her reply more explicite. She only told
them, contrary to her declara∣tions in the beginning of her reign, that she
had fixed no absolute resolution against marriage; and she added, that
the difficulties with which the question of the succession was
attended, were so great, that she would be contented, for their sake, to
remain some time longer in this vale of misery; and never would depart this
life with satisfaction, till she had laid some solid foundation for
their future security<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Simon D'Ewes's Journal, p.
75.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE most remarkable law passed this session, was
that which bore the title of <HI>Assurance of the Queen's royal power over
all states and subjects within her domini∣ons</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eliz. c. 1.</NOTE>.
By this act, the asserting twice by writing, word, or deed, the pope's
au∣thority, was subjected to the penalties of treason. All persons in
holy orders were bound to take the oath of supremacy; as also, all who were
advanced to any degrees, either in the universities or in common law; all
schoolmasters, officers in court, or members of Parliament: And the penalty
of their second refusal was treason. The first offence in both cases,
was punished by banishment and forfeiture. This rigorous statute, which
involved a real, tho' not general, per∣secution, and of the worst kind too,
as it made a scrutiny into mens secret senti∣ments, was not extended to
any of the degree of a baron; because it was not supposed, that the Queen
could entertain any doubt with regard to the fidelity of persons
possessed of such high dignity. The lord Montacute made vigorous
opposition to this bill; and asserted, in favour of the catholics, that
they dis∣puted not, they preached not, they disobeyed not the Queen, they
caused no trouble nor tumults among the people<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. It is, however, probable, that some suspicions of
their secret conspiracies had made the Queen and Parliament in∣crease
their rigour against them; tho' it is also more than probable, that they
were mistaken in the nature of the remedy.</P>
<P>THERE was likewise another point where the Parliament, this
session, shewed more the goodness of their intention than the
soundness of their judgment. They passed a law against fond and
fantastical prophecies, which had been ob∣served to seduce the people
into rebellion and disorder<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eliz. c. 15.</NOTE>: But at the same
time they enacted a statute which was most likely to increase these and
such like su∣perstitions: It was levelled against conjurations,
enchantments, and witchcra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>. Witchcraft and heresy are two crimes which always
increase by punishment, and never are so essectually suppressed
as by being totally neglected. After the Par∣liament <PB N="454" REF="57"/> had
granted the Queen a supply of one subsidy and two fifteenths, it was
finished by a prorogation. The convocation likewise voted the Queen a
sub∣sidy of six shillings in the pound, payable in three years.</P>
<P>WHILE the English parties exerted these calm efforts
against each other, in parliamentary votes and debates, the French factions,
enflamed to the highest de∣gree of animosity, continued that cruel war
which their intemperate zeal, actu∣ated by the ambition of their leaders, had
kindled in the kingdom. The admiral was successful in reducing the towns of
Normandy which held for the King; but he frequently complained, that the
numerous garrison of Havre remained totally unactive, and was not employed in
any military operations against the common enemy. The Queen, in taking
possession of that place, had published a mani∣festo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II.</NOTE>, in which she pretended, that her
concern for the French King's interest, had engaged her in that measure,
and that her sole intention was to oppose her enemies of the house of
Guise, who held their prince in captivity, and employed his power to the
destruction of his best and most faithful subjects. It was chiefly her
desire to preserve appearances, joined to the great frugality of her
temper, which made her, at this critical juncture, keep her soldiers in
garrison, and re∣strain them from committing farther hostilities upon the
enemy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 276, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>. The duke of Guise, meanwhile, was aiming a
mortal blow at the power of the Hugonots; and had commenced the siege of
Orleans, which was commanded by Andelot, and where the constable was detained
prisoner. He had the prospect of speedy success in this undertaking;
when he was assassinated by Poltrot, a young gen∣tleman, whose zeal,
instigated (as it is pretended, tho' without any certain foundation) by the
admiral and Beza, a famous preacher, led him to attempt that criminal
enterprize. The death of this gallant prince was a very sen∣sible loss to
the catholic party; and tho' the cardinal of Lorraine, his brother, still
supported the interest of the family, the danger of their progress
appeared much less imminent, both to Queen Elizabeth and to the French
protestants. The union, therefore, between these allies, which had been
cemented by their common fears, began thenceforth to be less intimate; and
the leaders of the Hugonots were persuaded to hearken to terms of
accommodation. Condé and Montmorency held conferences for settling the
peace; and as they were both of them impatient to relieve themselves from
captivity, they soon came to an agreement with regard to the conditions. The
character of the Queen-regent, whose ends were always violent, but who
endeavoured, by subtilty and policy, rather than force, to attain them, led
her to embrace any plausible terms; and in <PB N="455" REF="58"/> spite of
the admiral's protestations, whose sagacity could easily discover the
treachery of the court, the articles of agreement were finally settled
between the parties. A toleration, under some restrictions, was anew
granted to the prote∣stants; a general amnesty was published;
Condé was reinstated in his offices and governments; and after money
was advanced for the payment of arrears due to the German troops, they were
dismissed the kingdom.</P>
<P>BY the agreement between Elizabeth and the prince of
Condé, it had been stipulated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol II.
p. 79.</NOTE>, that neither party should conclude peace without the consent
of the other; but this article was at present but little regarded by the
leaders of the French protestants. They only comprehended her so far in the
treaty, as to obtain a promise, that, on her relinquishing Havre, her
charges and the money which she had advanced them, should be repaid her by
the King of France, and that Calais, on the expiration of the term, should be
restored to her. But she disdained to accept of these terms; and
thinking the possession of Havre a much better pledge for the obtaining
her purpose, she sent Warwic orders to prepare himself against an
attack from the now united power of the French monarchy.</P>
<P>THE earl of Warwic, who commanded a garrison of six
thousand men, beside seven hundred pioniers, had no sooner got
possession of Havre, than he employed every means for putting it in a
posture of defence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 158.</NOTE>; and
after expelling the French from the town, he encouraged his soldiers to make
the most desperate defence against the enemy. The constable commanded
the French army; the Queen-regent herself, and the King were present in the
camp; even the prince of Condé joined the King's forces, and gave
countenance to this enterprize; the admiral and Andelot alone, who still
desired to preserve Elizabeth's friendship, kept at a distance, and
prudently refused to join their antient enemies in an attack upon their
allies.</P>
<P>BY the force, and dispositions, and situation of both
sides, it was expected, that the siege would be attended with some very
memorable event; yet did France make a much easier acquisition of this
important place, than was at first apprehended. The plague crept in among the
English soldiers; and being en∣creased by their fatigue and bad diet (for
they were but ill supplied with provi∣sions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 337, 498.</NOTE>) it committed such ravages, that
sometimes an hundred men a day died of it, and there remained not at last
fifteen hundred in a condition to do duty<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
p. 450, 458.</NOTE>. The French, meeting with such feeble resistance,
carried on their attacks success∣fully; and having made two breaches,
each of them sixty feet wide, they pre∣pared <PB N="456" REF="59"/> for a
general assault, which must have terminated in the slaughter of the
whole garrison<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II. p.
498.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Havre lost. 28th July.</NOTE> Warwic, who
had frequently warned the council of the danger, and who had loudly demanded a
supply of men and provisions, found himself obliged to capitulate, and to
content himself with the liberty of with∣drawing his garrison. The articles
were no sooner signed, than lord Clinton, the admiral, who had been
detained by contrary winds, appeared off the harbour with a reinforcement of
three thousand men; and found the place surrendered to the enemy. To
encrease the misfortune, the infected army brought the plague with them into
England, where it swept off great multitudes, particularly in the city of
London. Above twenty thousand persons there died of it in one year<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
year the council of Trent was dissolved, which had sat from 1545. The
publication of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> decrees excited
anew the general serment in Europe; while the catholics endeavoured to
enforce the acceptance of them, and the protestants rejected them. The
religious controversies were too far advanced to expect that any conviction
would result from the decrees of this council. It is the only general council
which has been held in an age truly learned and inquisitive; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the history of it has been
wrote with great penetration and judgment, it has tended very much to expose
clerical usurpation, and in trigues, and may serve us as a specimen of
more antient councils. No one expects to see another general council, till
the decay of learning and the progress of ignorance shall again fit mankind
for these great impostures.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1564" UNIT="year"/> ELIZABETH, whose usual
vigour and foresight had not appeared in these trans∣actions, was now
glad to compound matters; and as the Queen-regent wanted leizure, in order to
prepare measures for the extermination of the Hugonots, she readily
hearkened to any reasonable terms of accommodation with England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib 3.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d April.</NOTE> It was agreed, that the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> THE peace still
continued with Scotland; and even a cordial friendship seemed to have been
cemented between Elizabeth and Mary. These princesses made profession
of the most entire affection; wrote amicable letters every week to each
other; and had adopted, in all appearance, the sentiments, as well as
style, of sisters. Elizabeth punished one Hales, who had composed a
book against Mary's title<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p.
252.</NOTE>; and as the lord keeper, Bacon, was thought to have encouraged
Hales in this undertaking, he fell under her displeasure, and it was with
some diffi∣culty that he wa able to give her satisfaction, and recover her
good opinion<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 253.</NOTE>. The two Queens
had agreed in the foregoing summer to an interview at York<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hayres. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>88.</NOTE>; in order to remove all difficulties with regard to
Mary's ratification of the treaty <PB N="457" REF="60"/> of Edinburgh, and to
consider of the proper method for settling the succession of England:
But as Elizabeth carefully avoided touching on this delicate subject, she
employed a pretext of the wars in France, which, she said, would detain her
in London; and she delayed till next year the intended interview. It is
also probable, that, being well acquainted with the beauty and address and
accom∣plishments of Mary, she did not choose to stand the comparison
with regard to those exterior qualities, in which she was eclipsed by her
rival; and was unwil∣ling, that that princess, who had already made great
progress in the esteem and affections of the English, should have a
farther opportunity of encreasing the number of her partizans.</P>
<P>MARY'S close connexions with the house of Guise, and her
devoted attach∣ment to her uncles, by whom she had been educated and
protected, was the ground of just and unsurmountable jealousy to
Elizabeth, who regarded them as her mortal and declared enemies, and was well
acquainted with their dangerous character and ambitious projects. They had made
offer of their niece to Don Carlos, Philip's son; to the King of Sweden, the
King of Navarre, the arch∣duke Charles, the duke of Ferrara, the cardinal of
Bourbon, who had only taken deacons orders, from which he might easily be
absolved; and they were ready to marry her to any one, who could strengthen
their interest, or give inquietude and disturbance to Elizabeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II. p. 287. Strype, vol. I. p. 400.</NOTE>. Elizabeth
on her part was equally vigilant to obviate the execution of their schemes,
and was particularly anxious, lest Mary should form any powerful foreign
alliance, which might tempt her to revive her pretensions to the crown, and
to invade the kingdom from the side where it was weakest and lay most
exposed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 24<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>84.</NOTE>. As she believed, that the marriage with the archduke
Charles was the most likely to have place, she used every expedient to
prevent it; and besides remonstrating against it to Mary herself, she
endea∣voured to draw off the archduke from that pursuit, by giving him some
reason to hope for success in his pretensions to herself, and by
inviting him to a renewal of the former treaty of marriage<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il, p. 41.</NOTE>.
She always told the Queen of Scotts, that nothing would satisfy her but her
espousing some English nobleman, who would remove all grounds of
jealousy, and cement the union between the two kingdoms; and she offered on
this condition to have her title examined, and to declare her the
successor to the crown<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 243,
2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0, 259, 26<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. After keeping the matter in these gene∣ral
terms during a twelvemonth, she at last named the lord Robert Dudley, now 
<PB N="458" REF="61"/> created earl of Leicester, as the person on whom
she desired that Mary's choice should fall.</P>
<P>THE earl of Leicester, the great and powerful favourite of
Elizabeth, pos∣sessed all those exterior qualities, which are
naturally alluring to the fair sex; a handsome person, a polite
address, an insinuating behaviour; and by means of these
accomplishments, he had been able to blind even the penetration of
Eli∣zabeth, and conceal from her the great defects, or rather odious vices,
which attended his character. He was proud, insolent, interested,
ambitious; without honour, without generosity, without humanity; and attoned
not for these bad qualities, by any such abilities or courage, as could fit
him for that high trust and confidence with which she always honoured him.
Her constant and de∣clared attachment to him had very naturally emboldened
him to aspire to her bed; and in order to make way for these nuptials, he
was universally believed to have murdered, in a barbarous manner, his wife,
the heiress of one Robesart. The proposal of espousing Mary was by no
means agreeable to him; and he always ascribed it to the contrivance of
Cecil, his enemy; who intended by that artifice to make him lose the
friendship of Mary from the temerity of his pretensions, and that of
Elizabeth from jealousy of his attachments to another woman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 396.</NOTE>. The Queen herself had not any serious
intention of effecting this marriage; but, as she was desirous, that the
Queen of Scots should never take any husband, she named a man, who, she
believed, was not likely to be accepted of; and she hoped, by that means, to
gain time, and elude the project of any other alliance. The earl of Leicester
was too great a favourite to be parted with; and when Mary, allured by the
prospect of being declared successor to the crown, seemed at last
to hearken to Elizabeth's proposal, this princess receded from her former
offers, and withdrew the bait, which she had formerly thrown out to her
rival<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 269, 270. Appendix, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. Strype, vol. I. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. This duplicity of
conduct, joined to some appearance of an imperious superiority, assumed
by her, had drawn a peevish letter from Mary; and the seemingly ami∣cable
correspondence of the two Queens was during some time interrupted. In order
to make up this breach, the Queen of Scots dispatched Sir James Melvil to
London; who has given us a very particular account of this negociation.</P>
<P>MELVIL was an agreeable courtier, a man of address and
conversation; and it was recommended to him by his mistress, that,
besides grave reasonings con∣cerning politics and state-affairs, he
should introduce more entertaining topics of conversation, suitable to
the sprightly character of Elizabeth; and should endea∣vour by that means
to insinuate himself into her confidence. He succeeded so 
<PB N="459" REF="62"/> well, that he threw that artful princess entirely off
her guard<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 447.</NOTE>, and brought
her to discover the bottom of her heart, full of all those levities and
follies and ideas of rivalship, which possess the youngest and most
frivolous of her sex. He talked to her of his travels, and forgot not to
mention the different dresses of the ladies in different countries, and the
particular advantages of each, in setting off the beauties of the shape and
person. The Queen said that she had dresses of all countries, and
she took care thenceforth to meet the ambassador every day appa∣relled in
a different habit: Sometimes she was dressed in the English garb,
some∣times in the French, sometimes in the Italian; and she asked him,
which of them became her most. He answered, the Italian; a reply, that he
knew would be agreeable to her, because that mode showed her flowing locks,
which, he remarked, tho' they were more red than yellow, she fancied to be
the finest in the world. She desired to know of him what was reputed the
best colour of hair: She asked whether his Queen's hair or hers was best:
She even enquired which of them he esteemed the fairest person: A very
delicate question, and which he prudently eluded, by saying that her
majesty was the fairest person in England, and his mistress in
Scotland. She next demanded which of them was tallest: He replied, his queen:
Then, said Elizabeth, she is too tall: For I my∣self am of a just
stature. Having learned from him, that his mistress some∣times
recreated herself by playing on the harpsicord, an instrument at which
she herself excelled, she gave orders to lord Hunsdon, that he should
lead him, as it were casually, into an apartment, where he might hear her
performance; and when Melvil, as if ravished with the harmony, broke into the
Queen's apart∣ment, she pretended to be displeased at his intrusion;
but still took care to ask whether he thought Mary or her the best
performer on that instrument<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. From the whole of her
behaviour, Melvil thought he might, on his return, assure his mistress
that she had no reason ever to expect any cordial friendship from
Elizabeth, and that all her professions of amity were full of falshood
and dis∣simulation.</P>
<P>AFTER two years had been spent in evasions and
artifices<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>, Mary's subjects and
counsellors, and probably herself, began to think it full time that some
alli∣ance were concluded; and the lord Darnley, son to the earl of Lenox, was
the person, in whom most mens opinions and wishes centered. He was Mary's
cousin∣german, by the lady Margaret Douglas, niece to Harry the eighth, and
daughter to the earl of Angus, by Margaret, Queen of Scotland. He had been born
and educated in England, where the earl of Lenox had constantly resided,
ever <PB N="460" REF="63"/> since he had been banished by the prevalence of
the house of Hamilton; and as Darnley was now in his twentieth year, and was
a very comely person, tall and delicately shaped, it was hoped, that he
might soon render himself agreeable to the Queen of Scots. He was also by
his father a branch of the same family with herself; and would, in
espousing her, preserve the royal dignity in the house of Stuart: He
was, after her, next heir to the crown of England; and those who pretended to
exclude her on account of her being a foreigner, had endeavoured to recommend
his title, and give it the preference. It seemed no inconsiderable
advantage, that she could, by marrying him, unite both their claims; and as
he was by birth an Englishman, and could not by his power or alliances give
any ground of suspicion to Elizabeth, it was hoped that the proposal of
this mar∣riage would not be unacceptable to that jealous princess.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was well informed of these intentions of the court
of Edinburgh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 261.</NOTE>; and was secretly
not displeased with the projected marriage between Darnley and the Queen of
Scots<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 280, 282. Jebb, vol. II. p.
46.</NOTE>. She would rather have wished, that Mary had continued for ever in
a single life; but finding little probability of rendering this scheme
effectual, she was satisfied with a choice, which freed her at once from
the dread of a foreign alliance, and from the necessity of parting with
Leicester, her fa∣vourite. In order to pave the way to Darnley's marriage,
she secretly desired Mary to invite Lenox into Scotland, to reverse his
attainder, and to restore him to his honours and fortune<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 259,
272.</NOTE>. And when her request was complied with, she took care, in
order to preserve the friendship of the Hamiltons and her other partizans
in Scotland, to blame openly this conduct of Mary<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 42.</NOTE>. <MILESTONE N="1565" UNIT="year"/> Hearing
that the negotiation for Darnley's marriage proceeded apace, she gave that
nobleman permission, on his first application, to follow his father into
Scotland: But no sooner did she learn, that the Queen of Scots was taken
with his figure and per∣son, and that all measures were fixed for
espousing him, than she exclaimed against the marriage; sent
Throcmorton to order Darnley immediately upon his allegiance to return into
England; threw the countess of Lenox and her second son into the Tower,
where they suffered a very rigorous confinement; seized all Lenox's
English estate; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th July.</NOTE> and, tho' it was
impossible for her to assign one single reason of her
displeasure<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 274, 275.</NOTE>, she
menaced, and protested, and complained, as if she had suffered the most
grievous injury in the world.</P>
<P>THE politics of Elizabeth, tho' judicious, were usually full
of duplicity and artifice; but never more so than in her transactions with
the Queen of Scots, <PB N="461" REF="64"/> where there entered so many little
passions and narrow jealousies, that she du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st not avow to the world the
reasons of her conduct, scarcely to her ministers, and scarcely even to
herself. But besides a womanish rivalship and envy against the
marriage of this princess, she had some motives of interest for
feigning a dis∣pleasure on the present occasion. It served her as a
pretence for refusing to ac∣knowlege Mary's title to the succession of
England; a point to which she was determined never to consent. And it was
useful to her for a purpose, still more unfriendly and dangerous, for
encouraging the discontents and rebellion of the Scotch nobility and
ecclesiastics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 290.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more unhappy for a people than to be governed by
a sove∣reign, who is attached to a religion different from that which is
established; and it is scarce possible, that a mutual confidence can
ever, in such a situation, have place between the prince and his
subjects. Mary's conduct had been hitherto, in every respect,
unexceptionable, and even laudable; yet had she not made such progress in
acquiring popularity, as might have been expected from her gracious deportment
and agreeable accomplishments. Suspicions every moment prevailed on account
of her attachment to the catholic faith, and especially to her uncles, the
open and avowed promoters of the scheme for exterminating the professors
of the reformed religion throughout all Europe. She still refused to ratify
the acts of Parliament, which had established the reformation; she made
attempts for restoring to the catholic bishops some part of their civil
jurisdiction<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 198.</NOTE>; and
she wrote a letter to the council of Trent, in which, besides
professing her at∣tachment to the catholic faith, she took notice of her
title to succeed to the crown of England, and expressed her hopes of
being able, in some period, to bring back all her dominions to the bosom of
the church<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. VII.</NOTE>. The
zealots among the protestants were not wanting, in their turn, to practise
insults upon her, which tended still more to alienate her from their faith.
A law was enacted, making it capital, even on the first offence, to say
mass any where, except in the Queen's chappel<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Keith, p 268.</NOTE>; and it was with great difficulty that this
small indulgence was granted her: The general assembly importuned her
anew to change her religion, to re∣nounce the blasphemous idolatry of the
mass, with the tyranny of the Roman Antichrist, and to embrace the true
religion of Christ Jesus<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 545. Knox,
p. 37<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. As she answered

or the impiety of the mass; and that her apostacy would lose her the

that their religion was <PB N="462" REF="65"/> undoubtedly the same which had
been revealed by Jesus Christ, which had been preached by the apostles,
and which had been embraced by the faithful in the primitive ages; that neither
the religion of Turks, Jews, nor Papists was built on so solid a
foundation as theirs; that they alone, of all the various species of
religionists spread over the face of the earth, were so happy as to be
possessed of the truth; that those who hear, or rather who gaze on
the mass, allow sacri∣lege, pronounce blasphemy, and commit most
abominable idolatry; and that the friendship of the King of kings was

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen of Scots mar∣ries the earl of
Darnley.</NOTE> THE marriage of the Queen of Scots had kindled afresh the
zeal of the re∣formers, because the family of Lenox was believed to adhere to
the catholic faith; and tho' Darnley, who now bore the name of King Henry, went
often to the established church, he could not, by this exterior compliance,
gain the con∣fidence and regard of the ecclesiastics. They rather laid hold
of this opportu∣nity to insult him to his face; and Knox scrupled not to
tell him from the pul∣pit, that God, for punishment of the offences and
ingratitude of the people, was wont to commit the rule over them to boys and
women<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 546. Knox, p. 381.</NOTE>. The
populace of Edinburgh, instigated by such doctrine, began to meet and to
associate themselves against the government<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 377.</NOTE>. But what threatned with more immediate
danger Mary's authority, were the discontents which prevailed among some of
the prin∣cipal nobility.</P>
<P>THE duke of Chatelrault was displeased with the
restoration, and still more with the aggrandizement, of the family of
Lenox, his hereditary enemies; and entertained fears lest his eventual
succession to the crown of Scotland should be excluded by his rival,
who had formerly advanced some pretensions to it. The earl of Murray found
his credit at court much diminished by the interest of Le∣nox, and his
son; and began to apprehend the revocation of some considerable grants
which he had obtained from Mary's liberality. The earls of Argyle, Rothes, and
Glencairne, the lords Boyde and Ochiltry, Kirkaldy of Grange, Pittarow, were
instigated by like motives; and as these were the persons who had most
zealously promoted the reformation, they were disgusted to find that the
Queen's favour was entirely engrossed by a new cabal, the earls of Bothwel,
Athole, Sutherland, and Huntley; men who were esteemed either lukewarm in
religious controversy, or inclined to the catholic party. The same ground
of discontent, which, in other courts, is the source of intrigue, faction,
and oppo∣sition, commonly produced in Scotland, either projects of
assassination, or of <PB N="463" REF="66"/> rebellion; and besides
mutual accusations of the former kind, which it is difficult to clear up<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears, however, from Randolf's

soon as they saw the Queen's marriage en∣tirely resolved on, entered into
a confederacy for taking arms against their sovereign. They met at
Stirling; pretended an anxious concern for the security of religion; framed
engagements for mutual defence; and made applications to Elizabeth for
assistance and protection<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 293,

publishing the expressions of her displeasure against the marriage,
had secretly ordered her ambassadors Ran∣dolf and Throcmorton, to give in
her name some promises of support to the malecontents; and had even
sent them a supply of ten thousand pounds, to en∣able them to begin their
insurrection<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 380. Keith, Appen. p.

<P>MARY was no sooner informed of the meeting at Stirling, and
the movements of the lords, than she summoned them to appear at court, in
order to answer for their conduct; and having levied some forces to execute
the laws, she ob∣liged the malecontents to leave the low country, and take
shelter in Argyleshire. That she might more effectually cut off all their
resources, she proceeded with the King to Glasgow, and forced them from
their retreat. They appeared at Paisly in the neighbourhood with about a
thousand horse; and passing the Queen's army, proceeded to Hamilton,
and thence to Edinburgh, which they entered without resistance. They
expected great reinforcements in this place, from the efforts of Knox and the
seditious preachers; and they beat their drums, desiring all men to
enlist, and receive wages for the defence of God's glory<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Knox. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>81.</NOTE>.
But the nation was in no disposition for rebellion: Mary was esteemed and
beloved: Her marriage was not generally disagreeable to the people: And the
interested views of the malecontent lords were so well known, that their
pretence of zeal for reli∣gion had little influence even on the ignorant
populace<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8, 38<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. The King and Queen advanced to Edinburgh at

thousand men<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>, they found
themselves under a necessity of abandoning their country, and of taking
shelter in England.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, when she found the event so much to disappoint
her expectations, thought proper to disown all connections with the Scotch
malecontents, and to <PB N="464" REF="67"/> declare every where, that she had
never given them any encouragement, or any promise of countenance or
assistance. She even carried farther her dissimulation and
hypocrisy. Murray had come to London, with the abbot of Kilwinning, agent for
Chatelrault; and she seduced them, by secret assurances of
protection, to declare, before the ambassadors of France and Spain, that
she had no-wise contributed to their insurrection. No sooner had she
extorted this confession from them, than she chased them from her
presence, called them unworthy tray∣tors, declared that their detestable
rebellion was of bad example to all princes, and assured them, that as
she had hitherto given them no encouragement, so they should never
thenceforth receive from her any assistance or protection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 57. Knox, p. 388. Keith, p. 319. Crawford, p. 62,

not be pre∣vailed on to conceal the part which he had acted in the enterprize
of the Scotch insurgents; and being well apprised of the usual character
and conduct of Eliza∣beth, he had had the precaution to obtain an order of
council to authorize the engagements which he had been obliged to take with
them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 60.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE banished lords, finding themselves so ill used by
Elizabeth, had recourse to the clemency of their sovereign; and after
some sollicitation, and some professions of sincere repentance, the
duke of Chatelrault obtained his pardon, on condition that he should retire
into France. Mary was more implacable against the ungrate∣ful earl of Murray,
and the other confederates, on whom she threw the chief blame of the
enterprize; but as she was continually plied with applications from their
friends, and as some of her most judicious partizans in England thought,
that nothing would more promote her interests in that kingdom, than the
gentle treatment of men so celebrated for their zeal against the catholic
religion; she agreed to give way to her natural temper, which inclined not to
severity, and she seemed determined to restore them to her favour<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63. Keith, p. 322.</NOTE>.
In this interval, Rambouillet arrived as ambassador from France, and
brought her advice from her uncle, the cardinal of Lorraine, to whose opinion
she always paid an extreme deference, by no means to pardon these
protestant leaders, who had been engaged in a rebellion against her<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 325. Melvil, p. 63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE two religions, in France, as well as in other parts of
Europe, were rather irritated than satiated with their mutual violences; and
the peace granted to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣gonots,
as had been foreseen by the admiral, was intended only to lull them asleep,
and prepare the way for their final and absolute destruction. The
Queen-regent <PB N="465" REF="68"/> made a pretence of travelling thro' the
kingdom, in order to visit the provinces, and correct all the abuses
arising from the late war; and after having held some conferences on the
frontiers with the duke of Lorraine, and the duke of Savoy, she came to
Bayonne, where she was met by her daughter, the Queen of Spain, and the duke
of Alva. Nothing appeared in the congress of these two splendid courts,
but gaity, festivity, love, and joy; but amidst these smiling
appearances were secretly fabricated schemes the most bloody, and the
most destructive to the repose of mankind, which had ever been thought of
in any age or nation. No less than a total and universal extermination of
the protestants by fire and sword, was concerted by Philip and Catherine of
Medicis; and Alva, agreeable to his fierce and sanguinary disposition,
advised the Queen-regent to commence the exe∣cution of this project, by the
immediate massacre of all the leaders of the Hu∣gonots<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vila, lib.

the snare, and never to draw the sword till they were totally disabled
from resistance. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confederacy against the
protestants.</NOTE> The cardinal of Lorraine, whose cha∣racter bore a
greater affinity to that of Alva, was a chief author of this barbarous
association against the reformers; and having connected his prospect of
success with the aggrandizement of his niece, the Queen of Scots, he took
care that her mea∣sures should agree with those violent councils, which
were embraced by the other catholic princes. It is not probable<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is, however, positively affirmed by Randolf, the

of this dan∣gerous secret with that young princess; but he had acquired
such authority over her, that he turned her from the road of clemency, which
she intended to have followed, and made her resolve on the total ruin of
the banished lords<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p 65.</NOTE>.
<MILESTONE N="1566" UNIT="year"/> A Parliament was summoned to meet at
Edinburgh for their forfeiture and at∣tainder; and as the crime of which they
had been guilty, was palpable and avowed, no doubt could be entertained but
sentence would be pronounced against them. It was by a sudden and violent
accident, which, in the issue, brought on the ruin of Mary, that they were
saved from the rigour of the law.</P>
<P>THE marriage of the Queen of Scots with lord Darnley was so
natural, and so inviting in all its circumstances, that it had been
precipitantly agreed to by that princess and her council; and while she was
allured by his youth, and beauty, and exterior accomplishments, she had at
first overlooked the qualities of his
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ind, which no wise
corresponded with the excellence of his outward figure. <PB N="466" REF="69"/>
Violent, yet variable in his enterprizes; insolent, yet credulous and
easily go∣verned by flatterers; he was devoid of all gratitude, because he
thought no fa∣vours equal to his merit; and being addicted to low pleasures,
he was equally incapable of all true sentiments of love and tenderness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 287, 329. Appen. p. 163.</NOTE>. The Queen of
Scots, in the first effusions of her fondness, had taken a pleasure in
exalting him beyond measure: She had granted him the title of King; she had
joined his name with her own in all public acts; she intended to have
procured him from the states a matrimonial crown: But having leisure
afterwards to remark his weak∣ness and vices, she began to see the danger
of her profuse liberality, and was resolved thenceforth to proceed with
more reserve in the trust which she con∣ferred upon him. His resentment
against this prudent conduct, served but the more to increase her
disgust; and the young prince, enraged at her imagined ne∣glects, pointed
his vengeance against every one whom he esteemed the cause of this change
in her measures and behaviour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Rizzio.</NOTE> THERE was one David
Rizzio in the court, who had of late obtained a very extraordinary degree of
confidence and favour with the Queen of Scots. He was a Piedmontese, of mean
birth, son to a teacher of music, himself a musi∣cian; and finding it
difficult to subsist by his art in his own country, he had fol∣lowed into
Scotland an ambassador whom the duke of Savoy sent thither, to pay his
compliments to Mary, some time after her first arrival. He
possessed a good ear, and a tolerable voice; and as that princess
found him useful to compleat her band of music, she retained him in her
service after the departure of his master. Her secretary for French
dispatches having, some time after, fallen under her displeasure, she
promoted Rizzio to that office, which gave him frequent op∣portunities of
approaching her person, and insinuating himself into her favour. He was
shrewd and sensible, as well as aspiring, much beyond his rank and
education; and made so good use of the access which fortune had procured
him, that he was soon regarded as the chief confident and counsellor of the
Queen. He was consulted on all occasions; no favours could be obtained but
by his in∣tercession; all suitors were obliged to gain him by presents
and flattery; and the man, insolent from his new exaltation, as well as
rapacious in his acquisitions, soon drew on himself the hatred of the
nobility, and of the whole kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p.

He had at first employed his credit to promote Darnley's marriage; and a firm
friendship seemed to be established between them: But on the
subsequent change of the Queen's sentiments, it was easy for Henry's
friends to persuade him, that <PB N="467" REF="70"/> Rizzio was the real
author of her indifference, and even to rouze in his mind jealousies of a
more dangerous nature. The favourite was of a disagreeable figure, but was
not past his youth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he was ugly; but it may be in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed, from the

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>; and tho' the opinion
of his criminal cor∣respondence with Mary might seem of itself
unreasonable, if not absurd, a sus∣picious husband could find no
other means of accounting for that lavish and im∣prudent kindness, with
which she honoured him. The rigid austerity of the ec∣clesiastics, who
could admit of no freedoms, contributed to spread this opinion among the
people; and as Rizzio was universally believed to be a pensionary of the
pope, and to be deeply engaged in all schemes against the protestants,
any story to his and Mary's disadvantage, received an easy credit among
the zealots of that communion.</P>
<P>RIZZIO, who had connected his interest with the Roman
catholics, was the declared enemy of the banished lords; and by promoting the
violent prosecu∣tion against them, had exposed himself to the
animosity of their numerous friends and retainers. A scheme was also
thought to be formed for revoking some exor∣bitant grants made during the
Queen's minority; and even the nobility, who had seized the
ecclesiastical benefices, began to think themselves less secure in
the possession of them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. Melvil, p. 64.</NOTE>. The earl of
Morton, chancellor, was affected by all these considerations, and still
more by a rumour spread abroad, that Mary intended to appoint Rizzio
chancellor in his place, and to bestow that dignity on a mean and upstart
foreigner, who was ignorant of the laws and language of the country<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

this princess been in her kindness to Rizzio, that even that strange
report met with credit, and proved a great means of accelerating the ruin of
the favourite. Morton, insinuating himself into Henry's confidence,
employ∣ed all his art to enflame the discontent and jealousy of that
prince; and he persuaded him, that the only means of freeing himself from
the indignities un∣der which he laboured, was to bring the base stranger to
that fate which he had so well merited, and which was so passionately
desired by the whole nation. George Douglas, natural brother to the
countess of Lenox, concurred in the same advice; and the lords Ruthven and
Lindesey, being consulted, offered their concurrence in the enterprize; nor
was even the earl of Lenox, the King's father, averse to the design<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Crawford p. 7.</NOTE>. But as these conspirators
were well acquainted <PB N="468" REF="71"/> with Henry's levity, they engaged
him to sign a paper, in which he avowed the undertaking, and promised to
protect them against every consequence which might ensue upon the
assassination of Rizzio<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, vol. I. p. 26<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Crawford, p. 7.</NOTE>. All these measures being
fully concerted, a messenger was dispatched to the banished lords, who
were ho∣vering near the borders; and they were invited by the King to return to
their na∣tive country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9th March.</NOTE> THIS design, so
atrocious in itself, was rendered still more so by the circum∣stances
which attended its execution. Mary, who was in the seventh month of her
pregnancy, was supping in private, and had at table the countess of Argyle,
her natural sister, with Rizzio, and others of her servants. The King
entered the room by a private passage, and stood at the back of Mary's
chair: The lord Ruthven, George Douglas, and other conspirators, being all
armed, rushed in after him; and the Queen of Scots, terrified with the
appearance, demanded of them the reason of this rude intrusion. They told
her, that they intended no violence against her person; but meant only to
bring that villain, pointing at Rizzio, to his deserved punishment. Rizzio,
aware of the danger, ran behind his mistress, and seizing her by the
waist, called aloud to her for protection; while she interposed in his
behalf, with cries, and menaces, and entreaties. The impa∣tient
assassins, regardless of her efforts, rushed upon their prey, and
by over∣turning every thing which stood in their way, increased the horror
and confusion of the scene. Douglas, seizing Henry's dagger, stuck it
in the body of Rizzio, who, screaming with fear and agony, was torne from
Mary by the other conspi∣rators, and pushed into the antichamber, where he
was dispatched with fifty-six wounds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Melvil,
p. 64. Keith, p. 330, 331. Crawford, p. 9.</NOTE>. The unhappy princess,
informed of his fate, immediately dried her tears, and said, she would weep
no more; she would now think of revenge. The insult, indeed, upon her
person; the stain attempted to be fixed on her honour; the danger to which
her life was exposed, on account of her pregnancy; were injuries so
atrocious, and so complicated, that they scarce left room for par∣don, even
from the greatest lenity and mercy.</P>
<P>THE assassins, apprehensive of Mary's resentment,
detained her a prisoner in the palace; and the King dismissed all
those who seemed willing to attempt her rescue, by telling them, that
nothing was done without his orders, and that he would be careful of the
Queen's safety. Murray, and the banished lords, appeared two days after;
and Mary, whose anger was now engrossed by injuries more recent and
violent, was willingly reconciled to them; and she even received her brother 
<PB N="469" REF="72"/> with tenderness and affection. They obtained an
acquital from the Parliament, and were re-instated in their honours and
fortunes. The accomplices also in Rizzio's murder applied to her for a
pardon; but she artfully delayed compliance, and persuaded them, that so
long as she was detained in custody, and was sur∣rounded by guards, any
deed which she should sign, would have no force nor validity. Mean while
she had gained the confidence of her husband, by her persuasion and
caresses; and no sooner were the guards withdrawn, than she engaged him
to escape with her in the night time, and take shelter in Dunbar. Many of
her subjects here offered her their assistance; and Mary, having
collected an army, which the conspirators had no power to resist,
advanced to Edinburgh, and obliged them of fly into England, where they lived
in great poverty and distress. They made applications, however, to the earl
of Bothwel, a new favourite of Mary's; and that nobleman, desirous to
strengthen his party by the accession of their interest, was able to
pacify her resentment, and he soon after procured them liberty to re∣turn
into their own country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 75, 76. Keith, p.
33<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Knox, p. 398.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE vengeance of the Queen of Scots was implacable against her
husband alone, whose person was before disagreeable to her, and who, by
his violation of every tie of gratitude and duty, had drawn on him her
highest resentment. She engaged him to disown all connections with the
assassins, to deny any concurrence in their crime, even to publish a
proclamation containing a falsehood so notorious to the whole world<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. I. p. 280. Keith, Appen. p.
167.</NOTE>; and having thus made him expose himself to universal
con∣tempt, and rendered it impracticable for him ever aster to acquire the
confidence of any party, she threw him off with disdain and
indignation<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 66, 67.</NOTE>. As if
she had been making an escape from him, she suddenly withdrew to Alloa,
a seat of the earl of Mar; and when Henry followed her thither, she
returned suddenly to Edin∣burgh; and gave him every where the strongest
proofs of displeasure, and even of antipathy. She encouraged her courtiers
in their neglect of him; and she was pleased, that his mean equipage, and
small train of attendants, should draw on him the contempt of the very
populace. He was permitted, however, to have apartments in the castle of
Edinburgh, which Mary had chosen for the place of her delivery. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th June.</NOTE> She was there delivered of a
son; and as this was very important news to England, as well as to Scotland,
she immediately dispatched Sir James Melvil to carry intelligence of the
happy event to Elizabeth. Melvil tells us, that that princess, the evening of
his arrival in London, had given a ball to her court at Greenwich, and was
displaying all that spirit and alac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity which usually attended her on these occasions: But when
the prince of Scotland's <PB N="470" REF="73"/> birth was notified to her, all
her joy was damped: She sunk into melancholy; she reclined her head upon
her arm; and complained to-some of her attendants, that the Queen of Scots
was mother of a fair son, while she was but a barren stock. Next day,
however, on the reception of the Scotch ambassador, she assumed her
former dissimulation, put on a joyful countenance, gave Melvil thanks for
the haste he had made in conveying to her the agreeable intelligence, and
expressed the utmost cordiality and friendship to her sister<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 69, 70.</NOTE>. Some time after, she dispatched the
earl of Bedford, with her relation, George Cary, son to the lord Hunsdon,
in order to officiate at the baptism of the young prince; and she sent by
them some magnificent presents to the Queen of Scots.</P>
<P>THE birth of a son gave additional zeal to Mary's partizans in
England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE>; and even men of all
parties began to cry aloud for some settlement of the suc∣cession. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Septem∣ber.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> These humours broke out
with great vehemence in a new session of Parliament, which was held after
six prorogations. The house of peers, which had hitherto forborne to touch
on the delicate point of the succession, here took the lead; and the
house of commons soon after imitated the zeal of the lords. Molineux opened
the matter in the lower house, and proposed that the question of the
succession and that of supply should go hand in hand; as if it were
intended to constrain the Queen to a compliance with the request of her
Parliament<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 179.</NOTE>. The courtiers
endeavoured to elude the debate: Sir Ralph Sadler told the house, that he had
heard the Queen positively affirm, that, for the good of her people, she
was determined to marry. Secretary Cecil and Sir Francis Knollys gave their
testimony to the same purpose; as did also Sir Ambrose Cave,
chancellor of the dutchy, and Sir Edward Rogers, comptroler of the
houshold<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Elizabeth's ambitious and masculine
character was so well known, that few members gave any credit to this
intelligence; and it was considered merely as an artifice, by which she
en∣deavoured to retract that positive affirmation, which she had made in
the begin∣ning of her reign, that she meant to live and die a virgin. The
ministers therefore gained nothing farther by this piece of policy, but only
to engage the house, for the sake of decency, to join the question of the
Queen's marriage with that of a settlement of the crown; and they were
proceeding with great earnest∣ness in the debate, and had even appointed a
committee to confer with the lords, when express orders were brought them
from Elizabeth not to proceed farther in that matter. Cecil told them, that
she pledged to the house the word of a Queen for her sincerity in her
intentions to marry; that the appointment of a successor would be
attended with great danger to her person; that she herself had bad
ex∣perience, <PB N="471" REF="74"/> during the reign of her sister, how much
court was paid to the next heir, and what dangerous sacrifices men were
commonly disposed to make of their present duty to their future
prospects; and that she was therefore determined to delay, till a more
proper opportunity, the decision of that important question<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 127, 128.</NOTE>. The house were not satisfied with
these reasons, and still less with the command, prohibiting them all
debate on that subject. Paul Wentworth, a spirited mem∣ber, went so far
as to question whether such a prohibition were not an infringe∣ment of the
liberties and privileges of the house<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
p. 128.</NOTE>. Some even ventured to violate that profound respect which
they had hitherto preserved to the Queen; and affirm∣ed that she was bound
in duty, not only to provide for the happiness of her sub∣jects during her
own life, but also to pay regard to their future security, by fixing a
successor; that by fixing a successor; that by a contrary conduct,
she showed herself the stepmother, not the natural parent, of her
people, and would seem desirous, that England should no longer
subsist than she should enjoy the glory and satisfaction of
governing it; that none but timorous princes, or tyrants, or faint hearted
women, ever stood in fear of their successors; and that the affections
of the people were a firm and impregnable rampart to every sovereign, who,
laying aside all artifice or by ends, had courage and magnanimity to put his
sole trust in that honourable and sure defence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 400.</NOTE>. The Queen, hearing of these debates,
sent for the speaker, and after reiterating her former prohibition, she
bid him inform the house, that, if any member remained still unsatisfied,
he might appear before the privy council, and there give his reasons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 128.</NOTE>. As the members showed a
disposition, notwithstanding these peremptory orders, still to
proceed upon the question, Elizabeth thought proper, by a message, to
revoke them, and to allow the house liberty of debate<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 130.</NOTE>. They were so mollified by
this gracious condescension, that they thenceforth conducted the matter
with more calmness and temper; and they even voted her a supply, to be
levied at three payments, of a subsidy and a fifteenth, without annexing
any condition to it. <MILESTONE N="1567" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
January.</NOTE> The Queen soon after dissolved the Parliament, and told
them with some sharpness in the conclusion, that their proceedings had
contained much dissimulation and artifice; that under the plausible
pretences of marriage and succession, many of them covered very
malevolent intentions to wards her; but that, however, she reaped this
advantage from their attempts, that she could now distinguish her friends
from her enemies. 
<Q REND="inline">"But do you think," added she, "that I am
unmindful of your future security, or will be negligent in settling the
succession? That is the chief object of my concern; as I know myself to
be liable to mortality. Or do you apprehend, that I <PB N="472" REF="75"/> meant
to incroach on your liberties? No: It was never my meaning: I only intended to
stop you before you approached the precipice. All things have their time; and
tho' you may be blessed with a sovereign more wise or more learned than
I, yet I assure you, that no one will ever rule over you, who shall be
more careful of your safety. And therefore, henceforward, whether I live to
see the like assembly or no, or whoever holds the reins of govern∣ment,
let me warn you to beware of provoking your sovereign's patience, so far as
you have done mine. But I shall now conclude, notwithstanding the
disgusts I have received (for I mean not to part with you in anger) that
the greatest part of you may assure themselves that they go home in
their prince's good graces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 116,
117.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>ELIZABETH carried farther her dignity on this occasion. She
had received the subsidy without any condition; but as it was believed,
that the commons had given her that gratuity with a view of engaging her to
yield to their requests, she thought proper, on her refusal, to remit
voluntarily the third payment; and she said, that money in her subjects
purses was as good as in her own ex∣chequer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 400.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the Queen was able to elude, for the present, the
applications of Parliament, the friends of the Queen of Scots multiplied every
day in England; and besides the catholics, many of whom kept treasonable
correspondence with her, and were ready to rise at her command<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 446, 448.</NOTE>, the court itself of
Elizabeth was full of her avowed partizans. The duke of Norfolk, the earls of
Leicester, Pembroke, Bedford, Northumberland, Sir Nicholas Throcmorton, and
most of the considerable men in England, except Cecil, seemed convinced
of the necessity of declaring her the successor. None but the more
zealous protestants adhered either to the countess of Hartford, or to her
younger sister, Eleanor, who had espoused the earl of Cumberland; and
as the marriage of the former seemed liable to some objections, and had
been declared invalid, men were alarmed, even on that side, with the
prospect of new disputes concerning the succession. Mary's behaviour
also, so moderate towards the protestants, and so gracious towards all
men, had procured her universal respect<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Melvin, p. 53, 61, 74.</NOTE>; and the public was willing to
ascribe any imprudences, into which she had fallen, to her youth and
inexperience. But all these slattering prospects were blasted by the
subsequent incidents, where her egregious indiscretions, shall I say,
or atrocious crimes, threw her from the height of her prosperity, and
involved her in infamy and ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="473" REF="76"/> THE earl of Bothwel was of a
considerable family and power in Scotland; and tho' not distinguished by
any talents either of a civil or military nature, he had made a figure in that
party, which opposed the greatness of the earl of Murray, and the more
rigid reformers. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Darnley.</NOTE> He was a man of
profligate manners; had involved his opulent fortune in great debts, and even
reduced himself to beggary, by his profuse expences<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 240.</NOTE>; and seemed to have no resource but in
des∣perate councils and enterprizes. He had been accused more than once of
an attempt to assassinate Murray; and notwithstanding that the
frequency of these accusations on all sides diminish somewhat the
credit due to any particular impu∣tation, they prove sufficiently the
prevalence of that detestable practice in Scot∣land, and may in that view
serve to render such rumours the more likely and credible. This man had of
late acquired the favour and entire confidence of Mary; and all her measures
were directed by his advice and authority. Reports were spread of more
particular intimacies and familiarities between them; and these reports
gained ground from the continuance or rather encrease of her hatred towards
her husband<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 66, 77.</NOTE>. That
young prince was reduced to such a state of des∣peration, by the neglects
which he underwent from his Queen and the courtiers, that he had once
resolved to fly secretly into France or Spain, and had even pro∣vided
himself of a vessel for that purpose<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 345-348.</NOTE>. Some of the most considerable
no∣bility, on the other hand, observing her fixed aversion to him, had
proposed some expedients for a divorce; and tho' Mary is said to have
spoke ho∣nourably on that occasion, and to have embraced the proposal no
farther than it should be found consistent with her own honour and her
son's legitimacy<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 404. Goodal's.
Queen Mary, vol II p. 317.</NOTE>, men were inclined to believe, that the
difficulty of finding proper means for effectuating that purpose, was the
real cause of laying aside all farther thoughts of it. So far were the
suspicions against her carried, that, when Henry, dis∣couraged with the
continual proofs of her hatred, left the court and retired to Glasgow, an
illness of an extraordinary nature, with which he was seized imme∣diately
on his arrival in that place, was universally ascribed by her enemies to a
dose of poison, which, it was pretended, she had administred to
him.</P>
<P>WHILE affairs were on this footing, all those who wished
well to her character or the repose of their country, were extremely
pleased, and somewhat surprized, to hear, that a friendship was again
conciliated between them, that she had taken a journey to Glasgow on
purpose to visit him during his sickness, that she behaved towards
him with great tenderness, that she had brought him along with her, and
that she appeared thenceforth determined to live with him on a sooting more
<PB N="474" REF="77"/> suitable to the connexions between them. Henry,
naturally uxorious, and not mistrusting this sudden reconcilement, put
himself implicitly into her hands, and attended her to Edinburgh. She lived
in the palace of Holy-rood-house; but as the situation of that place was
low, and the concourse of persons about the court was necessarily
attended with noise, which might disturb him in his present infirm
state of health, these reasons were assigned for fitting up an
apartment for him in a solitary house, at some distance, called the
Kirk of Field. Mary here gave him marks of kindness and attachment; she
conversed cordially with him; and she lay some nights in a room below
his; but on the ninth of February, she told him, that she would pass that
night in the palace, because the marriage of one of her servants was there
to be celebrated in her presence. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> About two o'clock in
the morning the whole town was much alarmed at hearing a great noise; and
were still more astonished, when it was discovered, that the noise
came from the King's house, which was blown up by gun-powder; that his dead
body was found at some distance in a neighbouring field; and that no marks
either of fire, contusion or violence appeared upon it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was imagined, that Henry had been strangled before the
house was blown up: But this sup∣position is contradicted by the
confession of the criminals; and there is no necessity to admit it in
order to account for the condition of his body. There are many instances that
men's lives have been saved who have been blown up in ships. Had Henry
fallen on water he had not probably been killed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NO doubt could be entertained but Henry was murdered; and the
general conjecture soon pointed towards the earl of Bothwel as the author of
that crime<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. Cabbala, p. 136.</NOTE>. But as
his favour with Mary was open and visible, and his power great, no one
ventured to declare openly his sentiments, and all men remained in silence
and mute astonishment. Voices, however, were heard in the streets, during
the darkness of the night, proclaiming Bothwel, and even Mary herself, to
be the murderers of the King; placards were secretly affixed to the same
pur∣pose; offers were made, that, upon giving proper securities, his guilt
should be openly proved: But after one proclamation from the court, offering
a reward and indemnity to any one that would discover the author of that
villainy, greater vigilance was employed in searching out the spreaders of
the libels and reports against Bothwel, and the Queen, than in tracing the
causes of the King's murder, or detecting the regicides<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Anderson's Collections, vol. II. p. 38. vol. IV. p. 167, 168.
Spotswood, p. 200. Keith, p. 374.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE earl of Lenox, who lived at a distance from the court, in
poverty and contempt, was rouzed by the report of his son's murder, and wrote
to the Queen, imploring speedy justice against the assassins;
among whom he named the earl of <PB N="475" REF="78"/> Bothwel, Sir James
Balfour and Gilbert Balfour his brother, David Chalmers, and four others of the
Queen's houshold; all of them persons, who had been mentioned in the
placards affixed on the walls at Edinburgh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p.
372. Anderson, vol. II. p. 3.</NOTE>. Mary took his demand of speedy
justice in a very literal sense; and allowing only fifteen days for the
examination of this important affair, she sent a citation to Lenox,
re∣quiring him to appear in court, and prove his charge against Bothwel<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 373.</NOTE>. This nobleman, meanwhile, and
all the other persons, accused by Lenox, enjoyed their full liberty<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 374, 375.</NOTE>; Bothwel himself was
continually surrounded with armed men<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
405.</NOTE>; took his place in council<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Anderson,
vol. I. p. 38, 40, 50, 52.</NOTE>; lived during some time in the house with
Mary<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. II. p. 274.</NOTE>; and
seemed to possess all his wonted confidence and familiarity with her.
Even the castle of Edinburgh, a place of great consequence, in this
critical time, was entrusted to his creature, Sir James Balfour, who had
himself been publickly charged as an accomplice in the King's murder<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Spots¦wood, p. 201.</NOTE>. Lenox, who had come as
far as Stirling, with a view of appearing at the trial, was informed of all
these circumstances; and reflecting on the small train, which attended
him, he began to entertain very just apprehensions from the power,
insolence, and te∣merity of his enemy. He wrote to Mary, desiring that the
day of trial might be prorogued; and conjured her, by all the regard which
she bore to her own honour, to employ more leisure and deliberation in
determining a question of such extreme moment<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 375. Anderson, vol. I. p. 52.</NOTE>. No regard was
paid to his application: The jury was enclosed, of which the earl of
Caithness was chancellor; and tho' Lenox, foreseeing the precipitation, had
ordered Cunningham, one of his retinue, to ap∣pear in court, and protest, in
his name, against the acquital of the criminal, the jury proceeded to a
sentence<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 376. Anderson,
vol. II. p. 106 Spotswood, p. 201.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th April.</NOTE> The sentence was such
as it behoved them to give, where neither accuser nor witness appeared; and
Bothwel was absolved from the King's murder. The jury, however,
apprehensive that their sentence would give great scandal, and perhaps
expose them afterwards to some danger, entered a protest, in which they
represented the necessity of their proceedings<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 201. Anderson, vol. I. p. 113.</NOTE>. It is
remarkable, that the indictment was laid against Bothwel for committing the
crime on the ninth of February, not the tenth, the real day on which Henry was
assassinated<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">Keith, p 375.
Anderson, vol. II. p. 93. Spotswood, p. 201.</NOTE>. The interpretation
generally put upon this error, too gross, it was thought, to have proceeded
from mistake, was, that the secret council, by whom Mary was governed, not
trusting entirely to precipitation, violence, and <PB N="476" REF="79"/>
authority, had provided this plea, by which they ensured, at all adventures,
a plausible pretence for acquitting Bothwel.</P>
<P>TWO days after this extraordinary transaction, a Parliament
was held; and tho' the sentence in favour of Bothwel was attended with such
circumstances as strongly confirmed, rather than diminished, the general
opinion of his guilt, he was the person chosen to carry the royal scepter
on the first meeting of that na∣tional assembly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 78. Crawford, p. 14.</NOTE>. In this Parliament, a
rigorous act was made against those who set up defamatory placards; but
no notice was taken of the King's mur∣der<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith,
p. 380. The Queen, in order to gain the people, agreed to an act of Parliament,
which established the protestant religion; a concession which she
could never before be brought to make.</NOTE>. The favour, which Mary openly
bore to Bothwel, kept every one in awe; and the effects of this terror appeared
more plainly in another transaction, which ensued immediately upon the
dissolution of the Parliament. A bond or association was framed; in
which the subscribers, after relating the acquital of Both∣wel by a legal
trial, and a farther offer, which he had made, to prove his inno∣cence by
single combat, oblige themselves, in case any per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on should afterwards impute to him the King's murder,
to support him with their whole power against such calumniators. After
this promise, which implied no great assurance in Both∣wel of his own
innocence, the sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cribers
mentioned the necessity of their Queen's marriage, in order to support
the government, and they recommended Bothwel to her as a husband<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 381.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th April.</NOTE> This paper was
subscribed by all the considerable nobility there present. In a
country, divided by violent factions, such a concurrence in favour of one
nobleman, no wise distinguished above the rest, except by his
fla∣gitious conduct, could never have been obtained, had not every one been
cer∣tain, at least firmly persuaded, that Mary was fully determined on this
measure<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mary herself confessed, in her
instructions to the ambassadors, which she sent to France, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bothwel persuaded all the noblemen,

Queen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lizabeth's commissioners
a paper signed by Mary, by which she permitted them to make this
application to her. This permission was a sufficient declaration of her
intentions, and was es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eemed
equivalent to a com∣mand. Anderson, vol. IV. p 59. They even asserted,
that the house, in which they met, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> surrounded with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med men. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oodal, vol.
II. p. 141.</NOTE>. Nor would such a motive have sufficed to influence men,
commonly so stubborn and intractable, had they not been taken by
surprize, been ignorant of each others sentiments, and overawed by the
present power of the court, and by the apprehensions of farther violence,
from persons so little governed by any rules of <PB N="477" REF="80"/>
honour and humanity. Even with all these circumstances, the
subscription to this paper may justly be regarded as a reproach to the
nation.</P>
<P>THE subsequent measures of Bothwel were equally
precipitant and audacious. Mary having gone to Stirling to pay a visit to her
son, he assembled a body of eight hundred horse, under pretence of
pursuing some robbers on the borders, and having way-laid her on her
return, he seized her person near Edinburgh, and carried her to Dunbar,
with an avowed design of forcing her to yield to his purpose. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th April.</NOTE> Sir James Melvil, who was
in her retinue, was carried along with her; and says not, that he saw any
signs of reluctance or constraint: He was even informed, as he tells us, by
one of Bothwel's officers, that the whole transaction was managed in concert
with her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 80.</NOTE>. A woman, indeed, of
that spirit and reso∣lution, which is acknowledged to belong to Mary, does
not usually, on these occasions, give such marks of opposition to
real violence, as can appear any wise doubtful or ambiguous. Some of the
nobility, however, in order to put mat∣ters to farther trial, sent her a
private message; in which they told her, that, if in reality she lay
under force, they would use all their efforts to relieve her. Her answer
was, that she had indeed been carried to Dunbar by violence; but since her
arrival had been so well treated there, that she willingly remained with
Bothwel<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 202.</NOTE>. No one gave
themselves thenceforth any solicitude to relieve her from a captivity,
which they believed to have proceeded entirely from her own approbation and
connivance.</P>
<P>THIS unusual conduct was at first ascribed to Mary's
sense of the infamy, attend∣ing her purposed marriage; and her desire
of finding some colour to gloss over the irregularity of her conduct. But a
pardon given to Bothwel a few days afterwards, made the public carry somewhat
farther their conjectures. In this deed, Bothwel received a remission for
the violence committed on the Queen's person; and for <HI>all other
crimes:</HI> A clause, by which the murder of the King was indirectly
pardoned. The rape was then conjectured to be only a contrivance of these
politicians, in order to afford a pretence for indirectly remitting a crime, of
which they durst not openly make any mention<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 61.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE events passed with such rapidity, that men had no
leisure to admire sufficiently one incident, when they were surprized
with a new one, equally rare and uncommon. There still, however, remained one
difficulty, which, it was not easy to foresee, how the Queen and Bothwel,
determined as they were to execute their shameful purpose, could find
expedients to overcome. The man, who had procured the subscription of the
nobility, recommending him as a hus∣band <PB N="478" REF="81"/> to the Queen,
and who had acted this seeming violence on her person, in order to force
her consent, had been married six months before to another wo∣man; to a
woman of merit, of a very noble family, sister to the earl of Hunt∣ley. But
persons blinded with passion, and infatuated with crimes, soon shake
off all appearance of decency. A suit was commenced for a divorce between
Bothwel and his wife; and this suit was opened at the same instant in two
differ∣ent, or rather opposite courts; in the court of the archbishop of
St. Andrews, which was popish, and governed itself by the canon law; and in
the new con∣sistorial or commissariot court, which was protestant,
and was regulated by the principles of the reformed teachers. The plea advanced
in each court, was so calculated as to suit the principles which there
prevailed: In the archbishop's court, the pretence of consanguinity was
employed, because Bothwel was related to his wife in the fourth degree; in
the commis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ariot court, the
accusation of adultery was made use of against him. The parties too who
applied for the di∣vorce, were different in the different courts: Bothwel was
the person who sued in the former; his wife in the latter. And the suit
in both courts was opened, pleaded, examined, and decided with the utmost
precipitation, and a sentence of divorce was pronounced in four days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. p. 280.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE divorce being thus obtained, it was thought proper that Mary
should be conducted to Edinburgh, and should there appear before the courts
of judica∣ture, and should acknowlege herself to be restored to entire
freedom. This was understood to be contrived with a view of obviating all
doubts with regard to the validity of her marriage. Orders were then given to
publish the banns in the church, between the Queen and the duke of Orkney;
for that was the title which he now bore; and Craig, a minister of Edinburgh,
was applied to for that purpose. This clergyman, not content with having, for
some time, refused compliance, publicly in his sermons condemned the
marriage; and exhorted all those who had access to the Queen, to give her
their advice against so scandalous an alliance. Being called before the
council, to answer for this liberty, he showed a courage which might cover
the whole nobles with shame, on account of their tameness and servility.
He said, that, by the rules of the church, the earl of Both∣wel, being
convicted of adultery, could not be permitted to marry; that the divorce
between him and his former wife, was plainly procured by collusion, as
appeared by the precipitation of that sentence, and the sudden conclusion
of his marriage with the Queen; and that all the suspicions which
prevailed, with re∣gard to the King's murder, and the Queen's concurrence in
the former rape, <PB N="479" REF="82"/> would thence receive undoubted
confirmation. He therefore exhorted Bothwel, who was present, no longer to
persevere in his present criminal enterprizes; and turning his
discourse to the other counsellors, he charged them to employ all their
influence with the Queen, in diverting her from a measure which would cover
her with infamy and dishonour. Not satisfied even with this admonition, he
took the first opportunity of informing the public, from the pulpit, of this
whole transaction, and expressed to them his fears, that,
notwithstanding all remon∣strances, their sovereign was still
obstinately bent on her fatal purpose. 
<Q REND="inline">"For himself," he said, "he had already
discharged his conscience, and yet again would take heaven and earth to
witness, that he abhorred and detested that marriage, as scandalous and
hateful in the sight of mankind: But since the Great, as he perceived,
either by their flattery or silence, gave countenance to the measure, he
besought the Faithful to pray fervently to the Almighty, that a resolution,
which was taken contrary to all law, reason, and good conscience, might, by
the divine blessing, be turned to the comfort and benefit of the church and
kingdom."</Q> These speeches offended the court extremely; and Craig was
anew summoned before the council, to answer for his temerity in thus
passing the bounds of his commission. But he told them, that the bounds
of his commission were the word of God, good laws, and natural reason;
and were the Queen's marriage tried by any of these three standards, it
would appear infamous and dishonourable, and would be so esteemed by the
whole world. The council were so overawed by this heroic behaviour in a
private clergyman, that they dis∣missed him without farther censure or
punishment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 203. Anderson, vol. II.
p. 280.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this transaction might have recalled Bothwel and the
Queen of Scots, from their infatuation, and might have instructed them in the
dispositions of the people, as well as their own inability to oppose
them; they were still resolute to rush forward to their own manifest
destruction. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 May.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen of Scots marties Bothw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</NOTE> The marriage was celebrated
by the bishop of Orkney, a protestant, who was afterwards deposed by the
church for this scandalous compliance. Few of the nobility appeared at the
ceremony: For they had most of them, either from shame or fear, retired to
their own houses. The French ambassador, Le Croc, an aged gentleman of
honour and character, could not be prevailed on, tho' a dependent of the
house of Guise, to counte∣nance the marriage by his presence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p.

<P>THE news of these transactions, being carried to foreign
countries, filled all Europe with amazement, and threw infamy not only on the
principal actors in them, but also on the whole nation, who seemed, by

little more leisure for reflection, roused men at last from their
lethargy; and the ru∣mours, which from the very beginning<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p. 11. Keith, Pref. p. 9.</NOTE>, had been spread
against Mary, as if she had concurred in the King's murder, seemed now,
by the subsequent trans∣actions, to have received a strong confirmation
and authority. It was every where said, that, even tho' no particular and
direct proofs had as yet been produced of the Queen's guilt, the whole tenor of
her late conduct was sufficient, not only to beget suspicion, but to
produce entire conviction against her: That her sud∣den resolution of
being reconciled to her husband, whom before she had long and justly
hated; her bringing him to court, from which she had banished him by
neglects and rigours; her fitting up separate apartments for him; were all of
them circumstances, which, tho' trivial in themselves, yet, being compared
with the following events, bore a very unfavourable aspect for her: That the
least which, after the King's murder, might have been expected in her
situation, was a more than usual caution in her measures, and an extreme
anxiety to punish the real assassins, in order to free herself from
all reproach and suspicion: That no wo∣man, who had any regard to her
character, would allow a man, publicly accused of her husband's murder,
so much as to approach her presence, far less give him a share in her
councils, and endow him with favour and authority: That an acquital merely in
the absence of accusers, was very ill fitted to satisfy the public;
especially if that absence proceeded from a designed precipitation of the
sentence, and from the terror which her known friendship for the criminal
had infused into every one: That the very mention of her marriage to such a
person, in such cir∣cumstances, was horrible; and the contrivance of
extorting a consent of the no∣bility, and of concerting a rape, were gross
artifices, more proper to betray her guilt than prove her innocence: That where
a woman thus shews a consciousness of merited reproach, and, instead
of correcting, provides only thin glosses to <PB N="481" REF="84"/> cover
her exceptionable conduct, she betrays a neglect of fame, which must
ei∣ther be the effect or the cause of the most shameful enormities: That
to espouse a man, who had a few days before been so scandalously
divorced from his wife; who, to say the least, was believed to have, a few
months before, assassinated her husband, was so contrary to the
plainest rules of behaviour, that no pretence of in∣discretion or
imprudence could account for such a conduct: That a woman, who, so soon
after her husband's death, tho' not attended with any extraordinary
circum∣stances, contracts a marriage which might, in itself, be the most
blameless, can∣not escape severe censure; but one who overlooks, for
her pleasure, so many other weighty considerations, was equally capable,
in gratifying her appetites, to ne∣glect every regard to honour, and to
humanity: That Mary was not ignorant of the prevailing opinion of the public,
with regard to her own guilt, and of the inferences which would every where be
drawn from her conduct; and therefore, if she still continued to pursue
measures which gave such just offence, she ratified, by her actions, as
much as by the most formal confession, all the surmizes and imputations
of her enemies: That the only circumstance which opposed all these
presumptions, was, the benignity and goodness of her preceding behaviour,
which seemed to remove her from all suspicion of such atrocious
inhumanity; but that the characters of men were extremely variable, and the
persons who were guilty of the worst actions, were not always naturally of
the worst and most cri∣minal dispositions: That a woman, who, in a
critical and dangerous moment, had sacrificed her honour to a man of
abandoned principles, might thenceforth be led blindfold by him to the
commission of the most enormous crimes, and was in reality no longer at
her own disposal: And that tho' one supposition was still left to
alleviate her blame, viz. that Bothwel, presuming on her affection towards
him, had of himself committed the crime, and had never communicated it to
her, yet such a sudden and passionate love to a man whom she had long
known, could not easily be accounted for, without supposing some degree
of preceding guilt; and as it appeared that she was not afterwards
restrained, either by shame or prudence, from incurring the highest
reproach and danger, it was not likely, that a sense of duty or humanity
would have a more powerful influence over her.</P>
<P>THESE were the general sentiments which prevailed throughout
Scotland; and as the protestant teachers, who had great authority, had long
borne a great ani∣mosity towards Mary, the opinion of her guilt was, by that
means, the more widely diffused, and made the deeper impression on every
one. Some attempts made by Bothwel, and, as it is pretended, with her
consent, to get the young prince into his power, excited the most serious
attention; and the principal nobility, even many of those who had formerly
been constrained to sign the application in <PB N="482" REF="85"/> favour of
Bothwel's marriage, met at Stirling, and formed an association for
protecting the prince, and punishing the King's murderers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 394.</NOTE>. The earl of Athole himself, a known
catholic, was the first author of this confederacy: The earls of Argyle,
Morton, Mar, Glencarne, the lords Boyd, Lindesey, Hume, Semple, Kirkaldy of
Grange, Tullibardine, and secretary Lidington, entered zealously into it.
The earl of Murray, foreseeing such turbulent times, and be∣ing desirous
to keep free of these dangerous factions, had, some time before, desired
and obtained Mary's permission to retire into France.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrections in Scotland.</NOTE> LORD Hume

They found means to make their escape to Dunbar; while the confederate lords
were assembling their troops at Edinburgh, and taking measures to
effectuate their purpose. Had Bothwel been so prudent as to keep within the
fortress of Dunbar, his enemies must have been dissipated for want of
pay and subsistence; but hear∣ing that the lords were fallen into
distress, he was so rash as to take the field, and advance towards
them. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th June.</NOTE> The armies met at Carberry
Hill, about six miles from Edinburgh; and Mary became soon sensible,
that her own troops disapproved of her cause, and were averse to spend
their blood in the quarrel<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 402.
Spotswood, p. 207.</NOTE>. After some bravadoes of Bothwel, where he
discovered very little courage, she saw no resource but that of holding
a conference with Kirkaldy of Grange, and of putting herself, upon some
general promises, into the hands of the confede∣rates. She was conducted to
Edinburgh, amidst the insults of the populace, who reproached her with her
crimes, and even held before her eyes, which ever way she turned, a banner,
on which was painted the murder of her hus∣band, and the distress of her
infant son<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 83, 84.</NOTE>. Mary,
overwhelmed with her ca∣lamities, had recourse to tears and lamentations.
Meanwhile Bothwel, during her conference with Grange, fled unattended to
Dunbar; and fitting out some ships, set sail for the Orkneys, where he
subsisted during some time by pyracy. He was pursued thither by
Grange, and his ship was taken, with several of his servants, who
afterwards discovered all the circumstances of the King's murder, and were
punished for the crime<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">And<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on, vol. II. p. 167, 166,

passage to Denmark, where he was thrown into prison, lost his
senses, and died miserably about ten years afterwards: An end worthy of
his flagitious conduct and behaviour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Imprisonment of Mary.</NOTE> THE Queen of

provide against, as well as their present animosity to gratify. It is
pretended, that she behaved with a spirit very little suitable to her
condition, avowed her in∣violable attachment to Bothwel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 419.</NOTE>, and even wrote him a letter, which the
lords intercepted, where she declared, that she would endure any extremity,
nay, resign her dignity and power, rather than relinquish his
affections<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 84. The reality of this
letter appears somewhat disput∣able; chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly because Murray and his associates never mentioned it in
their accusation of her before Queen Elizabeth's commissioners.</NOTE>.
The insurgents, finding the danger to which they were exposed, in case
Mary should finally pre∣vail, thought themselves obliged to proceed with
rigour against her; and they sent her next day under a guard to the
castle of Lochlevin, situated in a lake of that name. The mistress of
the house was mother to the earl of Murray; and as she pretended to have
been lawfully married to the late King of Scots, she naturally bore an
animosity to Mary, and treated her with the utmost harsh∣ness and
severity.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, who was exactly informed of all those events,
seemed touched with compassion towards the unfortunate Queen; and as all
her fears and jealou∣sies were now laid asleep, by the consideration of
that ruin and infamy in which Mary's conduct had involved her, she began to
reflect on the instability of hu∣man affairs, the precarious state of royal
grandeur, the danger of encouraging rebellious subjects; and she resolved
to employ her authority for alleviating the calamities of her unhappy
sister. She sent Sir Nicholas Throcmorton ambassa∣dor to Scotland, in
order to remonstrate both with Mary and the associated lords; and she
gave him instructions which, tho' mixt with some lofty preten∣sions, were
full of that good sense which was so natural to her, and of that
genero∣sity which the present interesting situation had called forth.
She empowered him to declare in her name to Mary, that the late conduct of that
princess, so enormous, and in every respect so unjustifiable, had
given her the highest offence; and tho' she felt the movements of pity
towards her, she had once determined never to interpose in her affairs,
either by advice or assistance, but to abandon her entirely, as a
person whose condition was totally desperate, and honour irretrieveable:
That she was well assured, that other foreign princes, Mary's near
relations, had em∣braced the same resolution; but, for her part, the late
events had touched her heart with more tender sympathy, and had made her
adopt measures more fa∣vourable to the liberty and interests of the unhappy
Queen: That she was de∣termined not to see her oppressed by her
rebellious subjects, but would employ all her good offices, and even her
power, to redeem her from captivity, and place her in such a condition as
would at once be compatible with her dignity, and the <PB N="484" REF="87"/>
safety of her subjects: That she entreated her to lay aside all
thoughts of re∣venge, except against the murderers of her husband; and as
she herself was his near relation, she was better entitled than the
subjects of Mary to interpose her authority on that head, and she
therefore besought that princess, if she had any regard to her own honour
and safety, not to oppose so just and reasonable a de∣mand: That
after those two points were provided for, her own liberty, and the
punishment of her husband's assassins, the safety of her infant
son was next to be considered; and there seemed no expedient more proper
for that purpose, than the sending him to be educated in England: And that
besides the security which would attend his removal from all factions and
convulsions, there were many other beneficial consequences, which it was
easy to foresee as the result of his education in that country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 411, 412, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE remonstrances which Throcmorton was instructed to make
to the associ∣ated lords, were entirely conformable to these sentiments
which Elizabeth enter∣tained in Mary's favour. She empowered him to tell them,
that whatever blame she might throw on Mary's conduct, any opposition to
their sovereign was totally unjustifiable, and incompatible with all order
and good government: That it belonged not to them to reform, much less to
punish, the mal-administration of their prince; and the only arms which
subjects could in any case lawfully em∣ploy against the supreme
authority, were entreaties, councils, and representations: That if these
expedients failed, they were next to appeal by their prayers to Hea∣ven; and to
wait with patience till the Almighty, in whose hands are the hearts of
princes, should be pleased to turn them to justice and to mercy: That
she inculcated not this doctrine because she herself was interested
in its observance; but because it was universally received in all well
governed states, and was essential to the preservation of civil
society: That she required them to restore their Queen to liberty; and
promised, in that case, to concur with them in all proper expedients for
regulating the government, for punishing the King's mur∣derers, and for
guarding the life and liberty of the infant prince: And that if the services
which she had lately conferred on the Scotish nation, in protecting them
from foreign usurpation, were duly considered by them, they would repose
confidence in her good offices, and would esteem themselves blame-worthy,
in never having as yet made any application to her<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 414, 415, 42<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, besides these remonstrances, sent by
Throcmorton some articles of accommodation, which he was to propose to both
parties, as expedients for the settlement of public affairs; and tho' these
articles included some considerable <PB N="485" REF="88"/> restraints on
the sovereign power, they were in the main calculated for Mary's advantage,
and were sufficiently indulgent to her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p.
416.</NOTE>. The associated lords, who were determined to proceed with
greater severity, were apprehensive of Eli∣zabeth's partiality; and being
sensible, that Mary would take courage from the protection of that powerful
princess<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 427.</NOTE>, they thought
proper, after several affect∣ed delays, to refuse the English
ambassador all access to her person. There were four different
schemes proposed in Scotland, for the treatment of the captive Queen: One,
that she should be restored to her authority under very strict
limi∣tations: The second, that she should be obliged to resign her
crown to the prince, be banished the kingdom, and be confined either to
France or England; with assurance from the sovereign in whose dominions
she should reside, that she should make no attempts to the
disturbance of the established government: The third, that she should
be publicly tried for her crimes, of which her enemies pre∣tended to have
undoubted proof and be condemned to perpetual imprisonment: The fourth was
still more severe, and required, that, after her condemnation, capital
punishment should be inflicted upon her<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 420.</NOTE>. Throcmorton supported the mildest
proposal; but tho' he promised his mistress's guarantee for the
perform∣ance of articles, threatned them with immediate vengeance in case of
refusal<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>, and warned them not to draw
on themselves, by their violence, the public re∣proach, which now lay upon
the Queen; he found, that excepting secretary Li∣dington, he had not the good
fortune to convince any of the leaders. All coun∣cils seemed to tend towards
the more severe expedients; and the preachers, in particular, drawing their
examples from the rigorous maxims of the Old Testa∣ment, which can only be
warranted by particular revelations, inflamed the minds of the people against
their unhappy sovereign<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 422,
426.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE were several pretenders to the regency of the young
prince, after the intended deposition of Mary. The earl of Lenox claimed that
authority as grandfather to the prince: The duke of Chatelrault, who was
absent in France, had pretensions as next heir to the crown: But the
greatest number of the asso∣ciated lords inclined to the earl of Murray,
in whose capacity they had the great∣est trust, and who possessed
the entire confidence of the preachers and more zea∣lous reformers. All
measures being therefore concerted, three instruments were sent to Mary,
by the hands of lord Lindesey and Sir Robert Melvil; by one of which she
was to resign the crown in savour of her son, by another to appoint
Murray regent, by the third to name a Council, which should administer the
go∣vernment <PB N="486" REF="89"/> till his arrival in Scotland. The Queen of
Scots, seeing no prospect of relief, lying justly under apprehensions
of her life, and believing, that no deed, which she executed during her
captivity, could be valid, was prevailed on, after a plentiful effusion of
tears, to sign these three instruments; and she took not the trouble of
inspecting any one of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 85.
Spotswood, p. 211. Anderson, vol. III. p. 19.</NOTE>. In consequence of
this forced resignation, the young prince was proclaimed King, under the name
of James the sixth. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th July.</NOTE> He was soon after crowned
at Stirling, and the earl of Mor∣ton took in his name the oath of Coronation;
in which a promise to extirpate heresy was not forgot. Some republican
pretensions in favour of the people's power were countenanced in this
ceremony<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 439, 44<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>; and a coin was soon after struck, on which
the famous saying of Trajan was inscribed, <HI>Pro me; si merear, in
me:</HI> For me; if I deserve it, against me<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 440. Appen. p. 150.</NOTE>. Throcmorton had orders from
his mis∣tress not to assist at the coronation of the King of
Scots<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 430.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE council of regency had not long occasion to exercise
their authority. The earl of Murray arrived from France, and took
possession of his high office. He paid a visit to the captive Queen;
and spoke to her in a manner which better suited her past conduct than
her present condition. This harsh treatment quite extinquished in her
breast any remains of affection towards him<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 87. Keith, p. 445.</NOTE>. Murray pro∣ceeded afterwards
to break, in a more public manner, all terms of decency with her. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of De∣cember.</NOTE> He summoned a
Parliament; and that assembly, after voting that she was undoubtedly an
accomplice in her husband's murder, condemned her to im∣prisonment,
ratified her dimission of the crown, and acknowleged her son for King,
and Murray for regent<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. p.
206, &amp; seq.</NOTE>. The regent, who was a man of vigour and abilities,
employed himself successfully in reducing the kingdom. He bribed Sir
James Balfour to surrender the castle of Edinburgh: He constrained the
gar∣rison of Dunbar to open their gates: And he demolished that
fortress.</P>
<P>BUT tho' every thing thus bore a favourable aspect to the new
government, and all men seemed to submit to Murray's authority; a violent
revolution, however necessary, can never be effected without great
discontents; and it was not likely, that in a country, where the government,
in its most settled state, possessed a very disjointed authority,
a new establishment should meet with no interruption or disturbance.
Few considerable men of the nation seemed willing to support Mary, so
long as Bothwel was present; but the removal of that obnoxious no∣bleman had
altered the sentiments of many. The duke of Chatelrault, being disappointed
of the regency, bore no good will to Murray and his counsellors; 
<PB N="487" REF="90"/> and the same sentiments were embraced by all his
numerous retainers: Several of the nobility, finding that others had taken the
lead among the associators, formed a faction apart, and opposed the
prevailing power: And besides some re∣mains of duty and affection towards
Mary, the malecontent lords, finding every thing carried to extremity against
her, were naturally led to embrace her cause, and shelter themselves
under her authority. All those who retained any propensity to the catholic
religion were inclined to join this party; and even the people in general, tho'
they had formerly either detested Mary's crimes, or blamed her imprudence,
were now moved by her misfortunes to compassionate her present
situation, and lamented, that a person, possessed of so many
amiable accomplish∣ments, joined to such high dignity, should be treated
with such extreme rigour and severity<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Buchan. lib. xviii. c. 53.</NOTE>, Animated by all these
motives, many of the principal nobility, now adherents to the Queen of Scots,
met at Hamilton, and concerted measures for supporting the cause of that
princess.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1568" UNIT="year"/> WHILE these humours were in
agitation, Mary was employed in contrivances for effecting her escape; and
she engaged, by her charms and caresses, a young gentleman, George
Douglas, brother to the laird of Lochlevin, to assist her in that
enterprize. She even went so far as to give him hopes of espousing her,
after her marriage with Bothwel should be dissolved on the plea of force;
and she proposed this expedient to the regent, who rejected it. Douglas,
however, per∣severed in his endeavours to free her from captivity; and having
all opportunities of access to the house, he was at last successful
in the undertaking. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d May.</NOTE> He con∣veyed her in
disguise into a small boat, and himself rowed her ashore. She
hastened to Hamilton; and the news of her arrival in that place being
immediately spread abroad, many of the nobility flocked to her with their
forces. A bond of association for her defence was signed by the earls of
Argyle, Huntley, Egling∣ton, Crawford, Cassiles, Rothes, Montrose,
Southerland, Errol, nine bishops, and nine barons, besides many of the
most considerable gentry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 475.</NOTE>. And
in a few days an army, to the number of six thousand men, was assembled
under her standard.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was no sooner informed of Mary's escape, than
she discovered her resolution of persevering in the same generous and
friendly measures, which she had hitherto pursued. If she had not
employed force against the regent, during the imprisonment of that
princess, she had been chiefly with-held by the fear of pushing him to
greater extremities against her<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 463.
Cabbala, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>41.</NOTE>; but she
had proposed to the <PB N="488" REF="91"/> court of France an expedient,
which, tho' less violent, would have been no less effectual for her
service: She desired that France and England should by concert cut off
all commerce with the Scotch, till they should do justice to their injured
sovereign<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 462.</NOTE>. She now
dispatched Leighton into Scotland to offer both her good offices, and the
assistance of her force to Mary; but as she was apprehensive of the
entrance of French troops into the kingdom, she desired that the
controversy between the Queen of Scots and her subjects might by that
princess be referred entirely to her arbitration, and that no foreign
succours should be introduced into Scotland<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 473. in the notes. Anderson, vol. IV. p.
26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT Elizabeth had not leizure to exert fully her efforts in
favour of Mary. The regent made haste to assemble forces; and
notwithstanding that his army was inferior in number to that of the Queen of
Scots, he took the field against her. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th May.</NOTE> A battle was fought at
Langside near Glasgow, which was entirely decisive in favour of the
associated lords; and tho' the regent, after his victory, stopt the
bloodshed, yet was the action followed by a total dispersion of the
Queen's party. That unhappy princess fled southwards from the field of
battle with great precipita∣tion, and came, with a few attendants, to the
borders of England. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary flies into England.</NOTE> She here
delibe∣rated concerning her next measures, which would probably prove so
important to her future happiness or misery. She found it impossible to
remain in her own kingdom: She had an aversion, in her present wretched
condition, to return into France, where she had formerly appeared with so
much splendour; and was not, besides, provided of a vessel, which could
safely convey her thither: The late generous behaviour of Elizabeth made her
hope for defence, and even assistance, from that quarter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jebb's Collection, vol. I. p. 420.</NOTE>; and as the
present fears of her domestic enemies were the most urgent, she
overlooked all other considerations, and embraced the resolution of taking
shelter in England. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th May.</NOTE> She embarked on board a
fishing-boat in Galloway, and landed the same day at Wirkington in
Cumberland, about thirty miles dis∣tant from Carlisle; whence she
immediately dispatched a messenger to London; notifying her arrival,
desiring liberty to visit Elizabeth, and craving her protection, in
consequence of former professions of friendship, made her by that
princess.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH now found herself in a situation, when it was
become necessary to take some decisive resolution with regard to her
treatment of the Queen of Scots; and as she had hitherto, contrary to the
opinion of Cecil, attended more to the motives of generosity than of
policy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cabala, p. 140.</NOTE>, she was engaged
by that prudent minister to weigh anew all the considerations, which
occurred in this critical conjuncture. <PB N="489" REF="92"/> He represented,
that the party, which had dethroned Mary, and had at present assumed the
government of Scotland, were always the partizans of the English alliance,
and were engaged, by all the motives of religion and of interest, to
per∣severe in their connexions with Elizabeth: That tho' Murray and his
friends might complain of some unkind usage during their banishment in
England, they would easily forget these grounds of quarrel, when they
considered, that Elizabeth was the only ally, on whom they could safely
depend, and that their own Queen, by her attachment to the catholic faith, and
by her other connexions, excluded them entirely from the friendship of
France, and even from that of Spain: That Mary, on the other hand, even before
her violent breach with her protestant subjects, was in secret entirely
governed by the counsels of the house of Guise; much more, would she
implicitly comply with their views, when by her own misconduct the power of
that family and of the zealous catholics was become her sole resource and
security: That her pretensions to the English crown would render her a
very dangerous instrument in their hands; and were she once able to
suppress the protestants in her own kingdom, she would unite the Scotch
and English catholics, with those of all foreign states, in one
confederacy against the religion and government of England: That it behoved
Elizabeth therefore to proceed with caution in the design of restoring her
rival to the throne; and to take care, both that that enterprize, if
undertaken, should be effected by English forces alone, and that full
securities should beforehand be provided for the re∣formers and the
reformation in Scotland: That above all, it was requisite to guard carefully
the person of that princess; lest, finding this unexpected reserve in
the English friendship, she should suddenly take the resolution of
flying into France, and should attempt by foreign force to recover
possession of her authority: That her desperate fortunes and broken
reputation fitted her for any attempt; and her resentment, when she
should find herself thus deserted by the Queen, would concur with her
ambition and her bigotry, and render her an unrelenting, as well as powerful,
enemy to the English government: That if she was once abroad, in the hands
of enterprizing catholics, the attack of England would appear to her as easy
as that of Scotland; and the only method, she must imagine, of recovering
her native kingdom, would be to acquire that crown, to which she would
esteem herself equally intitled: That a neutrality in such interesting
situa∣tions, tho' it might be pretended, could never, without the most
extreme danger, be upheld by the Queen; and the detention of Mary was equally
requisite, whe∣ther the power of England were to be employed in her favour,
or against her: That nothing indeed was more becoming a great prince than
generosity; yet the suggestions of this noble principle could never,
without the utmost imprudence, be <PB N="490" REF="93"/> consulted in such
delicate circumstances as those in which the Queen was at pre∣sent
placed; where her own safety and the interests of her people were
intimately concerned in every resolution which she embraced: That tho' the
example of successful rebellion, especially in a neighbouring country,
could be no wise agree∣able to any sovereign, yet Mary's imprudence had
been so great, perhaps her crimes so enormous, that the insurrection of
subjects, after such provocation, could no longer be regarded as a
precedent against other princes: That it was first necessary for
Elizabeth to ascertain, in a regular and satisfactory manner, the extent of
Mary's guilt, and thence to determine the degree of protection which she
ought to afford her, against her discontented subjects: That as no glory
could surpass that of defending oppressed innocence, it was equally
infamous to patronize vice and murder on the throne; and the contagion of
such dis∣honour would extend itself to all who countenanced or
supported it: And that if the crimes of the Scotch princess should, on
enquiry, appear as great and certain as was affirmed and believed, every
measure against her, which policy should dictate, would thence be
justified; or if she should be found innocent, every enterprize, which
friendship should inspire, would be acknowledged laudable and
glorious.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to these views, Elizabeth resolved to proceed in a
seemingly friend∣ly, but really cautious manner, with the Queen of Scots; and
she immediately sent orders to lady Scrope, sister to the duke of
Norfolk, a lady who lived in the neighbourhood, to attend on that princess.
Soon after she dispatched to her the lord Scrope himself, warden of the
marches, and Sir Francis Knolles, vice cham∣berlain. They found Mary already
lodged in the castle of Carlisle; and after expressing the Queen's
sympathy with her in her late misfortunes, they told her, that her request
of being allowed to visit their sovereign, and of being admitted to her
presence, could not at present be complied with: Till she had cleared
herself of her husband's murder, of which she was so strongly
accused, Eliza∣beth could not without dishonour show her any countenance,
or appear indiffe∣rent to the assassination of so near a
kinsman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. p. 54, 66, 82, 83,
86.</NOTE>. So unexpected a check threw Mary into tears; and the necessity
of her situation extorted from her a declara∣tion, that she would willingly
justify herself to her sister from all imputations, and would submit
her cause to the arbitration of so good a friend<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 10, 55, 87.</NOTE>. Two days after, she sent lord
Herreis to London with a letter to the same purpose.</P>
<P>THIS concession, which Mary could scarce avoid, without an
acknowlegement of guilt, was the point expected and desired by Elizabeth: She
immediately dis∣patched <PB N="491" REF="94"/> Midlemore to the regent of
Scotland; requiring him both to desist from the farther prosecution of
his Queen's party, and to send some persons to London to justify his
conduct with regard to her. Murray might justly be startled at receiv∣ing a
message, which must have appeared somewhat imperious; but as his
domestic enemies were numerous and powerful, and England was the sole ally,
which he could expect among foreign nations, he was resolved rather to
digest the affront than provoke Elizabeth by a refusal. He also
considered, that tho' that Queen had hitherto appeared partial to Mary, her
interest evidently engaged her to support the King's cause in Scotland;
and it was not to be doubted but that pe∣netrating princess would in the end
discover this advantage, and would at least afford him a patient and
equitable hearing. He therefore replied, that he would himself take a journey
into England, attended with other commissioners, and would willingly
submit the determination of his cause to Elizabeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LORD Herreis now perceived, that his mistress had advanced
too far in her con∣cessions: He endeavoured to maintain, that Mary could
not, without diminution of her royal dignity, submit to a contest with her
rebellious subjects before a foreign prince; and he required either present
aid from England, or liberty for his Queen to pass over into France. Being
pressed, however, with the former agreement before the English council,
he again renewed his consent; but in a few days he began anew to recoil, and
it was with some difficulty that he was brought to acqui∣esce in the
first determination<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
16-20.</NOTE>. These fluctuations, which were incessantly re∣newed,
showed his visible reluctance to the measures pursued by the court of
England.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots discovered no less aversion to the
trial proposed; and it required all the artifice and prudence of Elizabeth to
make her persevere in the agreement to which she had at first
consented. This latter princess still said to her, that she desired
not, without Mary's consent and approbation, to enter into this question,
and pretended only as a friend to hear her justification: That she was
confident there would be found no difficulty in refuting all the calumnies of
her enemies; and even if her apology should fall short of full conviction,
Eliza∣beth was determined to support her cause, and procure her some
reasonable terms of accommodation: And that it was never meant, that she
should be cited to a trial with her rebellious subjects, but on the
contrary, that they should be summoned to appear and justify themselves
for their conduct towards her<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 11,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>. Allured by these
plausible professions, the Queen of Scots agreed to justify herself
by her own commissioners before commissioners which should be
appointed by Elizabeth.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="95"/> DURING these transactions, the lord
Scrope and Sir Francis Knolles, who re∣sided with Mary at Carlisle, had
leizure to study her character, and to make re∣port of it to Elizabeth.
Unbroken by her misfortunes, resolute in her purpose, active in her
enterprizes, she aspired to nothing but victory, and was determined to
endure any extremity, to undergo any difficulty, and to try every fortune,
rather than abandon her cause, or yield the superiority to her enemies.
Eloquent, in∣sinuating, affable; she had already convinced all those, who
approached her, of the innocence of her past conduct; and as she declared
her fixed purpose to re∣quire aid of her friends all over Europe, and even to
have recourse to infidels and barbarians, rather than fail of vengeance
against her persecutors, it was easy to foresee the danger to which her
charms, her spirit, her address, if allowed to operate with their full
force, would expose them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. p.
5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 71, 72, 74, 78, 92.</NOTE>. The
court of England, therefore, who under pretence of guarding her, had already,
in effect, detained her close prisoner, were determined to watch her with
still greater vigilance. As Carlisle, by its situation on the borders,
afforded her great opportunities for contriv∣ing her escape, they removed her
to Bolton, a seat of lord Scrope's in Yorkshire: And the issue of the
controversy between her and the Scotch nation was regarded as a subject
more momentous to Elizabeth's security and interests, than it had ever
hitherto been apprehended.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conferences at York and Hampton∣court.</NOTE>
THE persons, appointed by the English court for the examination of this
great cause, were the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Sussex, and Sir Ralph
Sadler; and York was named as the place of conference. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th October.</NOTE> Lesley, bishop of
Ross, the lords Herreis, Levingstone and Boyde, with five persons more,
appeared as commis∣sioners from the Queen of Scots. The earl of Murray,
regent, the earl of Mor∣ton, the bishop of Orkney, lord Lindesey, and the
abbot of Dunfermling were appointed commissioners from the King and kingdom
of Scotland. Secretary Ledington, George Buchanan, the famous poet and
historian, with some others, were named as their assistants.</P>
<P>IT was a great circumstance of Elizabeth's glory, that she
was thus chosen umpire between the factions of a neighbouring kingdom, which
had, during many centuries, entertained the most violent jealousy and
animosity against Eng∣land; and her felicity was equally rare, in having
the fortune and fame of so dange∣rous a rival, who had long given her the
greatest inquietude, now entirely at her disposal. Some circumstances
of her late conduct had discovered a byass towards the side of Mary: Her
prevailing interests led her to favour the enemies of that princess: The
professions of impartiality, which she had made, were open and 
<PB N="493" REF="96"/> frequent; and she had so far succeeded, that each
side accused her commissioners of partiality towards their
adversaries<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p.
40.</NOTE>. She herself appears, by the instructions given them, to have
fixed no plan for the decision; but she knew, that the ad∣vantages, which
she should reap, must be great, whatever issue the cause should
take. If Mary's crimes could be ascertained by undoubted proof, she could
for ever blast the reputation of that princess, and might justifiably
detain her for ever a close prisoner in England: If the evidence fell
short of conviction, it was proposed to restore her to her throne, but
with such strict limitations, as would leave Elizabeth perpetual arbiter of
all differences between the parties in Scot∣land, and render her in effect
absolute mistress of that kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 14,
15, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MARY'S commissioners, before they gave in their complaints
against her ene∣mies in Scotland, entered a protest, that their appearance
in the cause should no wise affect the independance of her crown, or be
construed as a mark of subor∣dination to England: The English
commissioners received this protest, but with a reserve to the claim of
England. The complaint of that princess was next read, and contained a detail
of all the injuries, which she had suffered, since her marriage with
Bothwel: That her subjects had taken arms against her, under pretence of
freeing her from captivity; that when she put herself into their hands,
they had committed her to close custody in Lochlevin; had crowned her
son, an infant, in her place; had again taken arms against her after her
delivery from prison; had rejected all her proposals for accommodation; had
given battle to her troops; and had obliged her, for the safety of her
person, to take shelter in England<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 52. Goodall, vol. II. p. 128.
Haynes, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. The earl
of Murray, in answer to this complaint, gave a summary and imperfect
account of the late transactions: That the earl of Bothwel, the known
murderer of the late King, had, a little time after the commission of that
crime, seized the person of the Queen and led her to Dunbar; that he
acquired such influence over her as to gain her consent to marry him, and
he had accordingly procured a divorce from his former wife, and had pretended
to celebrate his marriage with the Queen; that the scandal of this
transaction, the dishonour which it brought on the whole nation, the danger
to which the infant prince was exposed from the attempts of that audacious
man, had obliged the nobility to take arms, and oppose his criminal designs
and enterprizes; that after the Queen, in order to save him, had thrown
herself into their hands, she still discovered such a vio∣lent
attachment to him, that they found it necessary, for their own and the
public safety, to confine her person, during a season, till Bothwel and
the other mur∣derers <PB N="494" REF="97"/> of her husband could be tried and
punished for their crimes; and that during this confinement, she had
voluntarily, without compulsion or violence, merely from disgust at the
inquietudes and vexations attending power, resigned her crown to her only
son, and had appointed the earl of Murray regent during the minority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 64 &amp; seq. Goodall,
vol. II. p. 144.</NOTE>. The Queen's answer to this apology was obvious: That
she did not know and never could suspect, that Bothwel, who had been
acquitted by a jury, and recommended to her by all the nobility for her
husband, was the mur∣derer of the King; that she ever was, and still
continues desirous, that, if he be guilty, he may be brought to condign
punishment; that her resignation of the crown was extorted from her by the
well-grounded fears of her life, and even by the direct menaces of violence;
and that Throcmorton, the English ambassador, as well as others of her
friends, had advised her to sign that paper as the only means of saving
herself from the last extremity, and had assured her, that a
con∣sent, given under these circumstances, could never have any force or
validity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 60
&amp; seq. Goodall, vol. II. p. 162.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SO far the Queen of Scots seemed plainly to have the advantage
in the con∣test; and the English commissioners might have been
surprized, that Murray had made so weak a defence, and had suppressed
all the material imputations against that princess, on which his party had
ever so strenuously insisted, had not some private conferences
previously informed them of the secret. Mary's com∣missioners had
boasted, that Elizabeth, from regard to her kinswoman, and from her
desire of maintaining the rights of sovereigns, was determined, however
criminal the conduct of that princess might appear, to restore her to the
throne<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 45.
Goodall, vol. II. p. 127.</NOTE>; and Murray, reflecting on some past
measures of the English court, began to apprehend that there was but too
just grounds for their expectations. He be∣lieved, that Mary, if he would
agree to conceal the most violent part of the accusation against her,
would submit to any reasonable terms of accommodation; but if he once
proceeded so far as to charge her with the whole of her supposed guilt,
no composition could afterwards take place; and should she ever be
re∣stored, either by the power of Elizabeth, or the assistance of her
other friends, he and his party must be exposed to her most severe and
implacable vengeance<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part
2. p. 47, 48. Goodall, vol. II. p. 159.</NOTE>. He resolved therefore not to
venture rashly on a measure, which it would be impossible for him ever
to recal; and he paid privately a visit to Norfolk and the other English
commissioners, confessed his scruples, laid before them the
evi∣dences of the Queen's guilt, and desired to have some security for
Elizabeth's <PB N="495" REF="98"/> protection, in case these evidences
should, upon examination, appear entirely sa∣tisfactory. Norfolk was not
secretly displeased with these scruples of the re∣gent<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p. 92. Melvil, p 94, 95. Haynes, p
574.</NOTE>. He had ever been a partizan of the Queen of Scots: Secretary
Led∣ington, who began also to incline to that party, and was a man of
singular ad∣dress and capacity, had engaged him to embrace farther views in
her favour, and even to think of espousing her: And tho' that duke
confessed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p.
77.</NOTE>, that the proofs against Mary seemed to him unquestionable, he
encouraged Murray in his present resolution not to produce them publicly in
the conferences before the English com∣missioners<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 57, 77. State Trials, vol I. p. 76.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NORFOLK, however, was obliged to transmit to court the queries
proposed by the regent. These queries consisted of four particulars:
Whether the English commissioners had authority from their sovereign to
pronounce any sentence against Mary, in case her guilt should be fully
proved before them? Whether they would promise to exercise that authority,
and proceed to an actual sentence? Whether the Queen of Scots, if she was
found guilty, should be delivered into the hands of the regent, or, at
least, so secured in England, that she never should be able to
disturb the tranquillity of Scotland? and, Whether Elizabeth would also, in
that case, promise to acknowlege the young King, and protect the regent in
his authority<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p.
55. Goodall, vol. II. p. 130.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, when these queries, with the other transactions,
were laid before her, began to think that they pointed towards a conclusion
more decisive and more advantageous than she had hitherto expected. She was
determined, therefore, to bring the matter into full light; and under pretext
that the distance from her person retarded the proceedings of her
commissioners, she ordered them to come to London, and there continue the
conferences. On their appearance, she imme∣diately joined in commission
with them, some of the most considerable of her council; Sir Nicholas
Bacon lord keeper, the earls of Arundel and Leicester, lord Clinton, admiral,
and Sir William Cecil, secretary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV.
part 2. p. 99.</NOTE>. The Queen of Scots, who knew nothing of these secret
motives, and who expected, that fear or decency would still restrain Murray
from proceeding to any violent accusation against her, expressed an
entire satisfaction in this adjournment, and declared, that the affair, being
under the immediate inspection of Elizabeth, was now in the hands where she
most desired it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 95. Goodall, vol.
II. p. 177, 179.</NOTE>. The conferences were accordingly continued at
Hampton-Court; and Mary's commissioners, as before, made no scruple to be
present at them.</P>
<P><PB N="496" REF="99"/> THE Queen, meanwhile, gave a
satisfactory answer to all Murray's demands; and having declared, that tho'
she wished and hoped, from the present enquiry, to be entirely convinced
of Mary's innocence, yet if the event should prove con∣trary, and if that
princess should appear guilty of her husband's murder, she should,
for her part, esteem her ever after unworthy of a throne<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 199.</NOTE>. The regent, encouraged by this
declaration, opened more fully his charge against the Queen of Scots; and
after expressing his reluctance to proceed to that extremity, and
protest∣ing, that nothing but the necessity of self-defence, which
must not be abandoned for any delicacy, could have engaged him in such a
measure, he proceeded to accuse her in plain terms, of participation and
consent in the assassination of the King<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 115, &amp; seq. Goodall, vol.
II. p. 206.</NOTE>. The earl of Lenox too appeared before the English
commissioners; and imploring vengeance for the murder of his son,
accused Mary as an accomplice with Both∣wel in that enormity<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 122. Goodall, vol.
II. p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN this charge was so unexpectedly given in, and copies of
it transmitted to the bishop of Ross, lord Herreis, and the rest of
Mary's commissioners, they absolutely refused to return any answer;
and they grounded their silence on very extraordinary reasons: They had
orders, they said, from their mistress, if any thing was advanced that
might touch her honour, not to make any defence, as she was a sovereign
princess, and could not be subject to any tribunal; and they required, that
she should previously be admitted to Elizabeth's presence, to whom, and
to whom alone, she was determined to justify her innocence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 125, &amp; seq. Goodall,
vol. II. 184, 211, 217.</NOTE>. They forgot, that the conferences were at
first begun, and were still continued, with no other view than to clear her
from the accusations of her enemies; that Elizabeth had ever pretended to
enter into them only as her friend, by her own consent and approbation, not
as assuming any superior jurisdiction over her; that that prin∣cess
had from the beginning refused to admit her to her presence, till she
should clear herself of the crimes imputed to her; that she had therefore
discovered no new signs of partiality by her perseverance in that
resolution; and that tho' she had granted an audience to the earl of Murray
and his collegues, she had previ∣ously conferred the same honour on
Mary's commissioners<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lesley's Negociations
in Anderson, vol. III. p. 25. Haynes, p. 487.</NOTE>; and her conduct was
so far entirely equal to both parties.</P>
<P>AS the Queen of Scots refused to give in any answer to
Murray's charge, the necessary consequence seemed to be, that there
could be no farther proceedings in the trial. But tho' this silence might be
interpreted as a presumption against <PB N="497" REF="100"/> her, it did not
fully answer the purpose of those English ministers, who were the
enemies of that princess. They still desired to have in their hands the
proofs of her guilt; and in order to draw them with decency from the regent, a
judicious artifice was employed by Elizabeth. Murray was called before the
English commissioners; and reproved by them, in the Queen's name, for the
atrocious imputations which he had had the temerity to throw upon his
sovereign: But tho' the earl of Murray, they added, and the other
commissioners, had so far forgot the duty of allegiance to their prince,
the Queen never would overlook what she owed to her friend, her neighbour,
and her kinswoman; and she therefore desired to know what they could
say in their own justification<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anderson,
vol. IV. part 2. p. 147. Goodall, vol. II. p. 233.</NOTE>. Murray, thus urged,
made no difficulty of producing the proofs of his charge against the Queen of
Scots; and among the rest, some love-letters and sonnets of her's to
Bothwel, wrote all in her own hand, and two other papers, one wrote in her own
hand, another sign∣ed by her, and wrote by the earl of Huntley; each of which
contained a pro∣mise of marriage with Bothwel.</P>
<P>ALL these important papers had been kept by Bothwel in a
silver box or casket, which had been given him by Mary, and which had
belonged to her first husband, Francis; and tho' the princess had
enjoined him to burn the letters as soon as he had read them, he had thought
proper to preserve them carefully, as pledges of her fidelity, and had
committed them to the custody of Sir James Balfour, go∣vernor of the castle
of Edinburgh. When that fortress was besieged by the asso∣ciated lords,
Bothwel sent a servant to receive the casket from the hands of the
governor. Balfour delivered it to the messenger; but as he had at that time
received some disgust from Bothwel, and was secretly negociating an
agree∣ment with the ruling party, he took care, by conveying private
intelligence to the earl of Morton, to make the papers be intercepted by him.
They contained incontestible proofs of Mary's criminal correspondence with
Bothwel, of her consent to the King's murder, and of her concurrence in that
rape which Bothwel pretended to commit upon her<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol II. p. 115. Goodall, vol. II. p. 1.</NOTE>. Murray
fortified this evidence by some testi∣monies of correspondent facts<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. part 2. p. 165, &amp;c. Goodall,
vol. II. p. 213.</NOTE>; and he added, sometime after, the dying
con∣fession of one Hubert, or French Paris, as he was called, a servant
of Bothwel's, who had been executed for the King's murder, and who directly
charged the Queen with her being accessary to that criminal enterprize<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. p. 192. Goodall, vol. II. p.
76.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MARY'S commissioners had used every expedient to ward this
blow, which they saw coming upon them, and against which, it appears, they
were not provided <PB N="498" REF="101"/> in any proper defence. As soon as
Murray opened his charge, they endeavoured to turn the conferences from an
enquiry into a negociation; and tho' informed by the English
commissioners, that nothing could be more dishonourable for their
mis∣tress, than to enter into a treaty with such undutiful subjects,
before she had jus∣tified herself from those enormous imputations which
had been thrown upon her, they still insisted, that Elizabeth should
settle terms of accommodation between Mary and her enemies in Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. part 2. p. 135, 139. Goodall, vol. II. p.
224.</NOTE>. They maintained, that till their mistress had given in her
answer to Murray's charge, his proofs could neither be called for nor
produced<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 139,
145. Goodall, vol. II. p. 228.</NOTE>; and finding, that the English
commissioners were still determined to proceed in the method which had
been projected, they finally broke off the conferences, and never would make
any reply. These papers have all of them been since published. The
objections made to their validity, are in general of small force: But were
they ever so specious, they cannot now be hearkened to; since Mary, at
the time when the truth could have been fully cleared, did, in effect, ratify
the evidence against her, by recoiling from the enquiry at the very critical
moment, and refusing to give any answer to the accusation of her
ene∣mies<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>We shall not enter into a long discussion of the
authenticity of these letters: We shall only re∣mark in general, that the
chief objections against them are, that they are supposed to have
passed thro' the earl of Morton's hands, the least scrupulous of all
Mary's enemies; and that they are, to the last degree, indecent, and even
somewhat inelegant, such as it is not likely she would write. But to
these presumptions we may oppose the following considerations. (1) The'
it be not difficult to counterfeit a subscription, it is very difficult,
and almost impossible, to counterfeit several pages, so as to
re∣semble exactly the hand writing of any person. (2.) The letters are very
long, much longer than they needed to have been, in order to serve the
purposes of Mary's enemies; a circumstance, which increased the
difficulty, and exposed any forgery the more to the risk of a detection.
(3.) They are not so gross and palpable, as forgeries commonly are; for
they left still a pretext for Mary's friends to assert, that their
meaning was strained to make them appear criminal; see Goodall, vol. II. p.
361. (4.) There is a long contract of marriage, said to be wrote by the earl
of Huntley, and signed by the Queen, before Bothwel's acquital. Would Morton,
without any necessity, have thus doubled the dif∣ficulties of the forgery,
and the danger of detection? (5.) The letters are indiscreet; but such was
apparently Mary's conduct at that time: They are inelegant; but they have a
careless, natural air, like letters hastily wrote between familiar friends.
(6.) They contain such a variety of particular cir∣cumstances, as no body
could have thought of inventing, especially as they must necessarily
have as∣forded her many means of detection. (7.) We see, that in writing
the first and longest letter, which she penned late at night, her paper
failed her, and she takes down a memorandum of what she intended to add
next morning; and it is accordingly added: A circumstance very particular,
and not likely to occur to any person who would forge these letters. (8.)
We have not the ori∣ginals of the letters, which were in French: We have only a
Scotch and Latin translation from the original, and a French translation
professedly done from the Latin. Now it is remarkable, that the Scotch
translation is full of Gallicisms, and is clearly a translation from a
French original: Such as <HI>make fault, faire des fautes; make it seem that
I believe, faire semblant de le cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re; make br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, faire

have you not desire to laugh, navez vous pas envie de rire; the place will
hald unto the death, la place tiendra jusqu'a la mort; he may not come forth
of the house this long time, il ne peut pas sortir du logis de long tems;
to make me advertisen ent, faire m'avertir; put order to it, mettre ordre a
cela; discharge your heart, decharger votre coeur; make gud watch, faites bon
garde,</HI> &amp;c. (9.) There is a conversation, which she mentions,
between herself and the King one evening: But Murray produced before the
English commissioners, the testimony of one Craw∣ford, a gentleman of
the earl of Lenox, who swore, that the King, on her departure from him, gave
him an account of the same conversation. (10.) There seems very little
reason why Murray and his associates should run the risk of such a
dangerous forgery, which must have rendered them infamous, if detected;
since their cause, from Mary's known conduct, even without these letters,
was sufficiently good and justifiable. (11.) Murray exposed these
letters to the examination of persons qualified to judge of them; the Scotch
council, the Scotch Parliament, Queen Elizabeth and her council, who were
possessed of a great number of Mary's genuine letters. (12.) He gave
Mary herself an oppor∣tunity of refuting and exposing him, if she had
chosen to lay hold of it. (13.) The letters tally so well with all the
other parts of her conduct during that transaction, that these proofs throw
the strong∣est light on each other. (14.) The duke of Norfolk, who had
examined these papers, and who fa∣voured so much Queen Mary, that he
intended to marry her, and in the end lost his life in her cause, yet
believed them authentic, and was fully convinced of her guilt. This appears not
only from his letters above mentioned, to Queen Elizabeth and her ministers,
but by his secret acknowlegement to Banister, his most trusty
confident. See State Trials, vol. 1. p. 81. In the conferences between the
duke, secretary Lidington, and the bishop of Ross, all of them zealous
partizans of that princess, the same thing seems always to be taken for
granted. Ibid. p. 74, 75. See farther MS. in the Advocate's library. A. 3. 28.
p. 314. from Cott. lib. Calig. c. 9. (15.) I need not re∣peat the presumption
drawn from Mary's refusal to answer. The only excuse for her silence,
is, that the suspected Elizabeth to be a partial judge: It was not, indeed,
the interest of that princess to ac∣quit and justify her rival and
competitor; and we accordingly find that Lidington, from the secret
in∣formation of the duke of Norfolk, informed Mary, by the bishop of Ross,
that the Queen of Eng∣land never meant to come to a decision; but only to get
into her hands the proofs of Mary's guilt, in order to blast her character:
See State Trials, vol. 1. p. 77. But this was a better reason for declining
the trial altogether than for breaking it off, on frivolous pretences, the very
moment the chief accusi∣tion was unexpectedly opened against her. Tho'
she could not expect Elizabeth's final decision in her favour, it was of
importance to give a satisfactory answer, if she had any, to the
accusation of the Scotch commissioners. That answer could have been
disperst for the conviction of the public, of to∣reign nations, and of
posterity. And surely after the accusation and proofs were in Queen
Elizabeth's hand, it could do no hurt to give in the answers. Mary's
information, that the Queen never in∣teaded to come to a decision, could be
no obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cle to her
justification. (16.) The very disappearance of these letters, is a
presumption of their authenticity. That event can be accounted for no way but
from the care of King James's friends, who were disirous to destroy every
proof of his mother's crimes. The disappearance of Morton's narrative, and of
Crawford's evidence, from the Cotton library, Calig. c. 1. must have
proceeded from a like cause. See MS. in the Advocate's library, A. 3. 29. p.
88.</P> 
<P>I find an objection made to the authenticity of the letters,
drawn from the vote of the Scotch privy∣council, which affirms the letters to
be wrote and subscribed by Queen Mary's own hand; whereas the copies given
in to the Parliament a few days after, were only wrote, not subscribed. See
Good∣all, vol. II. p. 64, 67. But it is not considered, that this
circumstance is of no manner of force: There were certainly letters, true or
false, laid before the council; and whether the letters were true or false,
this mistake proceeds equally from the inaccuracy or blunder of the clerk.
The mistake is easily accounted for: The letters were only wrote by her;
the second contract with Bothwel was only subscribed. A proper accurate
distinction was not made; and they are all said to be wrote and
sub∣scribed. A late writer, Mr. Goodall, has endeavoured to prove, that
these letters clash with chrono∣logy, and that the Queen was not in the
places mentioned in the letters, on the days there assigned: To confirm
this, he produces charters and other deeds signed by the Queen, where the
date and place do not agree with the letters. But it is well known, that the
date of charters, and such like grants, is no proof of the real day in which
they were signed by the sovereign. Papers of that kind com∣monly pass
through different offices: The date is affixed by the first office; and may

<P>The account given by Morton of the manner in which the
papers came into his hands, is very natu∣ral. When he gave it to the English
commissioners, he had reason to think it would be canvassed with all
the severity of able adversaries, interested in the highest degree to
refute it. It is probable, that he could have confirmed it by many
circumstances and testimonies; since they declined the contest.</P> 
<P>The like observation extends to Hubert's dying
confession. It is in vain at present to seek improba∣bilities in it,
and to magnify the smallest difficulty into a contradiction. It was
certainly a regular ju∣dicial paper, given in regularly and judicially; and
ought to have been canvassed at the time, if the persons whom it
concerned had been assured of their own innocence.</P> 
<P>The sonnets are inelegant; insomuch, that both Brantome
and Ronsard, who knew Queen Mary's stile, were assured, when they saw
them, that they could not be her composition. Jebb, vol. II. p. 478. But no
person is equal in his productions, especially one whose stile is so
little formed as Mary's must be supposed to be. Not to mention, that
such dangerous and criminal enterprizes leave little tranquillity of mind for
elegant, poetical compositions.</P> 
<P>In a word, Queen Mary might easily have conducted the
whole conspiracy against her husband, without opening her mind to any one
person except Bothwel, and without writing a scrap of paper about it; but
it was very difficult to have conducted it, so as that her conduct should
not betray her to men of discernment. In the present case, her conduct
was so gross as to betray her to every body; and fortune threw into her
enemies hands, papers by which they could convict her. The same insatuation
and imprudence, which happily is the usual attendant of great crimes, will
account for both. It is proper to observe, that there is not one
circumstance of the foregoing narrative, contained in the history, that is
taken from Knox, Buchanan, or even Thuanus, or, indeed, from any suspected
authority.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="499" REF="102"/> BUT Elizabeth, though she had seen
enough for her own satisfaction, was de∣termined, that the most eminent
persons of her court should also be acquainted <PB N="500" REF="103"/>
with these transactions, and should be convinced of the equity of her
proceedings. She ordered her privy-council to assembled; and that she
might render the matter more solemn and authentic, she added to them the
earls of Northumber∣land, Westmoreland, Shrewsbury, Worcester,
Huntingdon, and Warwic. The <PB N="501" REF="104"/> whole proceedings of the
English commissioners were read to them: The evi∣dences produced by
Murray were perused: A great number of letters, wrote by Mary to Elizabeth,
were laid before them, and the hand-writing compared with that of letters
delivered in by the regent: The refusal of the Queen of Scots
commissioners to make any reply, was related: And on the whole Elizabeth
told them, that as she had, at first, thought it improper, that Mary, after
such hor∣rible crimes were imputed to her, should be admitted to her
presence, before she had, in some measure, justified herself from
the charge; so now, that her guilt was confirmed by so many plausible
evidences, and all answer denied, she must, for her part, persevere
more steadily in that resolution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol.
IV. part 2. p. 170, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p. 254.</NOTE>. Elizabeth next
called in the Queen of Scots commissioners, and after observing, that
she esteemed it much more decent for their mistress to continue the
conferences, than to require the liberty of justifying herself in person;
she told them, that Mary might either send her reply by a person whom
she trusted, or deliver it herself to some Eng∣lish noblemen, whom
Elizabeth should appoint to wait upon her: But as to her resolution of
making no reply at all, she must regard it as the strongest
confession of guilt; nor could they ever be esteemed her friends, who
advised her to that method of proceeding<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 179, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p.

which she wrote to Mary herself<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Anderson,
vol. IV. part 2 p. 183. Goodall, vol. II. p. 269.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots had no other subtersuge from these
pressing instances than still to demand a personal conference with
Elizabeth: A concession which, she was sensible, could never be
granted<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Cabala, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>; both because Elizabeth
knew, that that expedient could decide nothing, and because it brought
matters to extre∣mity, which that princess wanted to avoid. In order to keep
herself better in countenance, Mary thought of another device. Even after all
the conferences were broke off, she ordered her commissioners to accuse
the earl of Murray and his associates as the murderers of the Kind<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 280.</NOTE>: But this
accusation, coming so late, being extorted merely by a complaint to
Murray's, and being unsupported by any proof, could only be regarded as an
angry retaliation upon her enemy<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Unless we take this angry accusation, advanced by Queen
Mary, to be an argument of Mur∣ray's guilt, there remains not the least
presumption which should lead us to suspect him to have been any way an
accomplice in the King's murder. That Queen never pretended to give any proof
of the charge; and her commissioners affirmed at the time, that they
themselves knew of none, tho' they were ready to maintain its truth by their
mistress's orders, and would produce such proof as she should send
them. It is remarkable, that, at that time, it was impossible for either
her or them to pro∣duce any proof; because the conferences before the
English commissioners were previously broke off.</P> 
<P>It is true, the bishop of Ross, in an angry pamphlet,
wrote by him under a borrowed name, (where it is easy to say any thing)
affirms, that lord Herreis, a few days after the King's death, charged Mur∣ray
with the guilt, openly, to his face, at his own table. That nobleman, as
Lesly relates the mat∣ter, affirmed, that Murray, riding in Fife with one of
his servants, the evening before the commission of that crime, said to
him among other talk, <HI>This night' ere morning the lord Darnley shall
lose his life.</HI> See Anderson, vol. I. 75. But this is only hearsay of
Lesly's, concerning a hearsay of Herreis's; and contains a very improbable
fact. Would Murray, without any use or necessity, communicate to a
servant, such a dangerous and important secret, merely by way of
conversation? We may also ob∣serve, that lord Herreis himself was one
of Queen Mary's commissioners who accused Murray. Had he ever heard this
story, or given credit to it, was not that the time to have produced it; and
not have affirmed, as he did, that he, for his part, knew nothing of Murray's
guilt. See Goodall, vol. II. p. 307.</P> 
<P>The earls of Huntley and Argyle accuse Murray of this
crime; but the reason which they assign is most ridiculous. He had
given his consent to Queen Mary's divorce from the King; therefore he was the
King's murderer. See Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 192. It is a sure
argument, that these earls knew no better proof against Murray, otherwise
they would have produced it, and not have infilled on so absurd a
presumption. Was not this also the time for Huntley to deny his writing
Mary's con∣tract with Bothwel, if that paper had been a forgery?</P> 
<P>Murray could have no motive to commit that crime. The King,
indeed, bore him some ill-will; but the King himself was become so
despicable, both from his own ill-conduct and the Queen's aver∣sion to him,
that he could neither do good nor harm to any body. To judge by the event, in
any case, is always absurd; but more especially in the present. The
King's murder, indeed, procured Murray the regency: But much more Queen Mary's
ill conduct and imprudence, which he could not possibly foresee, and
which never would have happened, had she been entirely innocent.</P></NOTE>. 
<PB N="502" REF="105"/> She also desired to have copies of the papers given
in by the regent; but as she still persisted in her resolution to
make no reply, this demand was finally refused her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 2, 3, 310, 311. Haynes, vol. I. p.
492.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As Mary had thus put an end to the conference, the regent
expressed great impatience to return into Scotland; and he complained, that
his enemies had taken advantage of his absence, and had thrown the whole
government into confusion. Elizabeth, therefore, dismissed him; and
granted him the loan of five thousand pounds, to bear the charges of his
journey<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 677.</NOTE>. During
the con∣ference at York, the duke of Chatelrault arrived at London, in
passing from France; and as the Queen knew, that he was engaged in Mary's
party, and had very plausible pretensions to the regency of the King of
Scots; she thought proper to detain him till after Murray's departure. But
notwithstanding these marks of favour, and some other assistance,
which she secretly gave the regent<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">MS. in

she still declined acknowleging the young King, or treating with Murray as
re∣gent of Scotland.</P>
<P>ORDERS were given for removing the Queen of Scots from Bolton, a
place surrounded with catholics, to Tutbury in the county of Stafford; where
she was put under the custody of the earl of Shrewsbury. Elizabeth
entertained hopes, that that princess, discouraged by her misfortunes, and
confounded by the late transactions, would be glad to secure a safe
retreat from all the tempests, with which she had been agitated; and she
promised to bury every thing in oblivion, provided Mary would agree, either
to resign voluntarily her crown, or to associate her son with her in
the government; and the administration to remain, during his minority, in the
hands of the earl of Murray<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p.
295.</NOTE>. But that high-spirited princess refused all treaty upon
such terms, and declared, that her last words should be those of a
Queen of Scotland. Besides many other reasons, she said, which fixed
her in that resolution, she knew, that, if, in the present emergence,
she made such concessions, her submission would be universally
deemed an ac∣knowlegement of guilt, and would ratify all the calumnies of her
enemies<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 301.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MARY still insisted upon the alternative of two demands;
either that Eliza∣beth should in assist her in recovering her
authority, or should give her liberty to retire into France, and make trial
of the friendship of other princes: And as she asserted, that she had
come voluntarily into England, invited by many former professions of amity,
she thought that one of these requests could not, without the most
extreme injustice, be refused her. But Elizabeth, sensible of the
dan∣ger, which attended either of these proposals, was secretly
resolved to detain her still a captive; and as her retreat into England had
been very little voluntary, her claim upon the Queen's generosity appeared
much less urgent than she was willing to pretend. Necessity, it was
thought, would to the prudent justify her detention: Her past misconduct
would apologize for it to the equitable: And tho' it was foreseen, that
compassion for her situation, joined to her intrigues and insinuating
behaviour, would, while she remained in England, excite the zeal of her
friends, especially of the catholics; these inconveniencies were esteemed
much less than those which attended any other expedient. Elizabeth
trusted also to her own address, for eluding all those difficulties:
She proposed to avoid breaking ab∣solutely with the Queen of Scots, to keep
her always in hopes of accomoda∣tion, to negotiate perpetually with her, and
still to throw the blame of not com∣ing to any conclusion, either on
unforeseen accidents, or on the obstinacy and perverseness of
others.</P>
<P><PB N="504" REF="107"/> WE come now to mention some English
affairs, which we left behind us, that we might not interrupt our narration of
the events in Scotland, which form so material a part of the present reign.
The term, fixed by the treaty of Cateau-Cambresis for the restitution of
Calais expired in 1567; and Elizabeth, after making her demand at the gates of
that city, sent Sir Thomas Smith to Paris; and that minister, in
conjunction with Sir Henry Norris, her ordinary ambassa∣dor, enforced her
pretensions. Conferences were held on that head, without coming to any
conclusion. The chancellor De L'Hopital told the English am∣bassadors,
that tho' France by an article of the treaty was obliged to restore Ca∣lais
on the expiration of eight years, there was another article of the same
treaty, which now deprived Elizabeth of all right, that could accrue to her by
that en∣gagement: That it was agreed, if the English should, during that
interval, com∣mit hostilities upon France, they should instantly forfeit
all claim to Calais; and the taking possession of Havre and Dieppe,
with whatever pretences that measure might be covered, was a plain violation
of the peace between the nations: That tho' these places were not taken by
force, but put into Elizabeth's hands by the governors; these governors were
rebels; and a correspondence with such offenders was the most flagrant
injury, which could be committed to any sove∣reign: That in the treaty, which
ensued upon the expulsion of the English from Normandy, the French
ministers had absolutely refused to make any mention of Calais, and had
thereby declared their intention to take advantage of the title which had
accrued to the crown of France: And that tho' a general clause had been
inserted, implying a reservation of all claims; this concession could
not avail the English, who at that time possessed no just claim to
Calais, and had previously forfeited all pretensions to that
fortress<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 587.</NOTE>. The Queen was no
wise surprized at hearing these allegations; and as she knew, that the
French court intended not from the first to make restitution, much less,
after they could defend their refusal by such plausible reasons, she
thought it better for the present to submit to the loss, than to pursue
a doubtful title by a war both dangerous and expensive, as well as
unseasonable<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 406.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH entered anew into negotiations for marrying the
archduke Charles; and she seemed at present to have no great motive of
policy, which might induce her to make this fallacious offer: But as she was
very rigorous in the terms in∣sisted on, and refused him all power and
title, and even the exercise of his reli∣gion in England, the treaty came to
nothing; and that prince, despairing of success in his addresses,
married the daughter of Albert, duke of Bavaria<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 407, 408.</NOTE>.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the puritans.</NOTE> OF all the
European churches, which shook off the yoke of the papal autho∣rity, no one
proceeded with so much reason and moderation as the church of England; an
advantage, which had been derived partly from the interposition of the civil
magistrate in this innovation, partly from the gradual and slow steps by
which the reformation was conducted in that kingdom. Rage and animosity
against the catholic religion was as little indulged as could be supposed
in such a revolution: The fabric of the secular hierarchy was maintained
entire: The antient liturgy was preserved, so far as was thought
consistent with the new principles: Many ceremonies, become venerable from
age and preceding use, were retained: The splendor of the catholic
worship, tho' removed, had at least given place to order and decency: The
distinctive habits of the clergy, according to their dif∣ferent ranks, were
continued: No innovation was admitted merely from spite and opposition to
the former usage: And the new religion, by mitigating the genius of the
antient superstition, and rendering it more compatible with the peace and
interests of society, had preserved itself in that happy medium, which
wise men have always sought, and which the people have so seldom been
able to main∣tain.</P>
<P>BUT tho' such in general was the spirit of the reformation
in that country, many of the English reformers, being men of a more warm
complexion and more obstinate temper, endeavoured to push matters to
extremity against the church of Rome, and indulged themselves in the most
violent contrariety and antipathy to all former practices. Among these,
Hooper, who afterwards suffered for his religion with such extraord nary
constancy, was chiefly distinguished. This man was named, during the
reign of Edward, to the fee of Glocester, and had no <PB N="506" REF="109"/>
scruple to accept of the episcopal office; but he refused to be
consecrated in the episcopal habits, the cymarre and rochette, which had
formerly, he said, been abused to superstition, and which were thereby
rendered unbecoming a true chris∣tian. Cranmer and Ridley were surprized at
this objection, which opposed the received practice, and even the
established laws; and tho' young Edward, desirous to promote a man so
celebrated for his eloquence, his zeal, and his morals, en∣joined them to
dispense with this ceremony, they still continued resolute to retain
it. Hooper then embraced the resolution, rather to refuse the bishopric
than cloath himself in those hated garments; but it was determined, that,
for the sake of the example, he should not escape so easily. He was
first confined to Cran∣mer's house, and then thrown into prison, till he
should consent to be a bishop on the terms proposed: He was plyed with
conferences, and reprimands, and argu∣ments: Bucer and Peter Martyr and the
most celebrated foreign reformers were consulted on this important
question: And a compromise, with great difficulty, was at last made, that
Hooper should not be obliged to wear commonly the ob∣noxious robes, but
should agree to be consecrated in them, and to use them during cathedral
service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 152. Heylin, p.
90.</NOTE>: A condescension not a little extraordinary in a man of so
inflexible a spirit as this reformer.</P>
<P>THE same objection, which had arisen with regard to the
episcopal habits, had been moved against the rayment of the inferior
clergy; and the surplice in par∣ticular, with the tippet and corner cap, was
a great object of abhorrence to many of the popular zealots<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 416.</NOTE>. In vain was it urged, that
particular habits, as well as postures and ceremonies, being constantly
used by the clergy, and employed in religious service, acquire a veneration
in the eyes of the people, appear sacred to their apprehensions, excite
their devotion, and contract a kind of mysterious virtue, which attaches the
affections of men to the national and established wor∣ship: That in order
to produce this effect an uniformity in these particulars is re∣quisite,
and even a perseverance, as far as possible, in the former practice: And
that the nation would be happy, if, by retaining these inoffensive
observances, they could engage the people to renounce willingly what was
hurtful or perni∣cious in the antient superstition. These arguments,
which had influence with wise men, were the very reasons, which engaged the
violent protestants to re∣ject the habits. They pushed matters to a total
opposition with the church of Rome: Every compliance, they said, was a
symbolizing with Antichrist<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
416.</NOTE>: And this spirit was carried so far by some reformers, that
in a national remonstrance, which was afterwards made by the church of
Scotland against these habits, it was asked, 
<Q REND="inline">"What has Christ Jesus to do with Belial?
What has darkness <PB N="507" REF="110"/> to do with light? If surplices,
corner caps, and tippets have been badges of idolaters in the very act of their
idolatry; why should the preacher of Christian liberty, and the open
rebuker of all superstition partake with the dregs of the Romish beast?
Yea, who is there that ought not rather to be afraid of tak∣ing in his hand or
on his forehead the print and mark of that odious beast?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 565. Knox, p. 402.</NOTE>"</Q> But this application was
rejected by the English church.</P>
<P>THERE was only one instance, where the spirit of
contradiction to the Ro∣manists took place universally in England: The
altar was removed from the wall, was placed in the middle of the church, and
was thenceforth denominated the communion-table. The reason, why this
reformation met with such general compliance, was, that the nobility and
gentry got thereby a pretence for making spoil of the plate, vestures, and
rich ornaments, which belonged to the altars<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, preface, p. 3. Hist. p. 106.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE disputes, which had been started during the reign of
Edward, were carried abroad by the protestants, who fled from the
persecutions of Mary; and as their zeal had received an encrease from the
furious cruelty of their enemies, they were generally inclined to carry their
opposition to the utmost extremity against the practices of the church of
Rome. Their communication with Calvin and the other reformers, who followed the
discipline and worship of Geneva, confirmed them farther in this
obstinate reluctance; and tho' some of the refu∣gees, particularly those
established at Frankfort, still adhered to King Edward's liturgy, the
prevailing spirit carried these confessors to seek a still farther
re∣formation. On the accession of Elizabeth, they returned to their native
coun∣try; and being regarded with general veneration on account of their zeal
and past sufferings, they ventured to insist on the establishment
of their projected mo∣del; nor did they want countenance from many of the
considerable persons in the Queen's council. But the Princess herself,
so far from being willing to de∣spoil religion of the few ornaments and
ceremonies, which remained in it, was of herself rather inclined to bring the
public worship still nearer to the Romish ritual<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>When Nowel, one of her chaplains, had spoke less

she called aloud to him from her closet window, commanding him to retire

to return unto his text. And on the other side, when one of her divines had
preached a sermon in defence of the real presence, she openly gave him
thanks for his pains and piety.</HI> Heylin, p. 124. She would have

Strype's Life of Parker, p. 107, 108, 109. She was an enemy to sermons; and
usually said, that she thought two or three preachers were sufficient
for a whole county.</NOTE>; and she thought, that the reformation had already
gone too far in shak∣ing <PB N="508" REF="111"/> off those forms and
observances, which, without distracting men of more refined
apprehensions, tend in a very innocent manner to allure, and amuse, and
engage the vulgar. She took care to have a law for uniformity strictly
enacted: She was empowered by the parliament to add any new ceremonies, which
she thought proper: And tho' she was sparing in the exercise of this
prerogative, she con∣tinued rigid in exacting an observance of the
established laws, and in punishing all nonconformity. The zealots,
therefore, who harboured a secret antipathy to the episcopal order and to
the whole liturgy, were obliged, in a great measure, to conceal these
sentiments, which would have been regarded as highly audacious and criminal;
and they confined their avowed objections to the surplice, the con∣firmation
of children, the sign of the cross in baptism, the ring in marriage,
kneeling at the sacrament, and bowing at the name of Jesus. So fruitless
is it for sovereigns to watch with a rigid care over orthodoxy, and employ
the sword in religious controversy, that the work, perpetually renewed, is
perpetually to begin; and a garb, a gesture, nay, a metaphysical or
grammatical distinction, when rendered important by the disputes of
theologians and the zeal of the ma∣gistrate, is sufficient to destroy the
unity of the church and even the peace of so∣ciety. These controversies
had already excited such ferment among the people, that in some places they
refused to frequent the churches where the habits and ceremonies were used,
would not salute the conforming clergy, and proceeded so far as to revile
them in the streets, to spit in their faces, and to use them with all
manner of contumely<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Whitgift,
p. 460.</NOTE>. And while the sovereign authority checked these
ex∣cesses, the flame was confined, not extinguished; and burning fiercer
from con∣finement, it burst out in the succeeding reigns to the
destruction of the church and monarchy.</P>
<P>ALL enthusiasts, indulging themselves in rapturous
flights, extasies, visions, inspirations, have a natural aversion to
episcopal authority, to ceremonies, rites, and forms, which they denominate
superstition, or beggarly elements, and which seem to restrain the
liberal effusions of their zeal and devotion: But there was another set of
opinions adopted by these innovators, which rendered them in a peculiar
manner the object of Elizabeth's aversion. The same bold and daring
spirit, which accompanied them in their addresses to the divinity,
appear∣ed in their political speculations; and the principles of civil
liberty, which, during some reigns had been very little avowed in the nation,
and which were totally incompatible with the present exorbitant prerogative,
had been strongly adopted by this new sect. Scarce any sovereign before
Elizabeth, and none after <PB N="509" REF="112"/> her, carried higher, both in
speculation and practice, the authority of the crown; and the puritans (so
these sectaries were called, on account of their pretending to a greater
purity of worship and discipline) could not recommend themselves worse
to her favour, than by preaching up the doctrine of resisting or
restraining princes. From all these motives, the Queen neglected no
opportunity of depres∣sing those zealous innovators; and while they were
countenanced by some of her most favoured ministers, Cecil, Leicester,
Knolles, Bedford, Walsingham, she never was, to the end of her life,
reconciled to their principles and practices.</P>
<P>WE have thought proper to insert in this place an account of
the rise and the genius of the puritans; because Camden marks the present
year, as the period when they began to make themselves most considerable
in England. We now return to our narration.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1569" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Nor∣folk's conspi∣racy.</NOTE> THE
Duke of Norfolk was the only peer, who enjoyed the highest title of
no∣bility; and as there were at present no princes of the blood, the
splendor of his family, the opulence of his fortune, and the extent of his
influence, had rendered him without comparison the first subject in
England. The qualities of his mind corresponded to his high station:
Beneficent, affable, generous, he had acquired the affections of the people;
prudent, moderate, obsequious, he possessed with∣out jealousy the
good graces of his sovereign. His grandfather and father had long been
regarded as the leaders of the catholics; and this hereditary attach∣ment,
joined to the alliances of blood, had procured him the friendship of the
most considerable men of that party: But as he had been educated among the
refor∣mers, was sincerely devoted to their principles, and maintained that
strict decorum and regularity of life, by which the protestants were at
that time distinguished; he thereby enjoyed the rare felicity of being
popular even with the most opposite factions. The height of his
prosperity alone was the source of his misfortunes, and engaged him into
attempts, from which his virtue and prudence would na∣turally have for ever
kept him at a distance.</P>
<P>NORFOLK was at this time a widower; and being of a suitable
age to espouse the Queen of Scots, that marriage had appeared so natural,
that it had occurred to several of his friends and those of that
princess: But the first person, who, after secretary Lidington, opened
the scheme to the duke is said to be the earl of Mur∣ray, before his
departure for Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 36, 37.</NOTE>.
That nobleman set before Norfolk both the advantage of composing the
differences in Scotland by an alliance which would be so generally
acceptable, and the prospect of reaping the succession of England; and
in order to bind Norfolk's interest the faster with Mary's, he proposed
that the <PB N="510" REF="113"/> duke's daughter should espouse the young
king of Scotland. The obtaining pre∣viously Elizabeth's consent, was
regarded both by Murray and Norfolk as a cir∣cumstance essential to the
success of their project; and all circumstances being adjusted between
them, Murray took care, by the means of Sir Robert Melvil, to have the design
communicated to the Queen of Scots. That princess replied, that the
vexations, which she had met with in her two last marriages, had made her
more inclined to lead a single life; but she was determined to sacrifice
her own inclinations to the public welfare: And therefore, so soon as she
should be legally divorced from Bothwel, she would be determined by the
opinion of her nobility and people in the choice of another husband<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 40, 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is probable, that Murray was not sincere in this
proposal. He had two motives to engage him to dissimulation. He knew the
danger, which he must run in his return thro' the North of England, from the
power of the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, Mary's partizans in
that country; and he dreaded an insurrection in Scotland from the duke of
Chatelrault; and the earls of Argyle and Huntley, whom she had appointed her
lieutenants during her ab∣sence. By these feigned appearances of
friendship, he both engaged Norfolk to write in his favour to the northern
noblemen<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">State Trials, p. 76, 78.</NOTE>; and he
perswaded the Queen of Scots to give her lieutenants permission, and even
advice, to make a cessation of hostilities with the regent's party<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, tho' he had agreed, that Elizabeth's
consent should be previously obtained, before the completion of his
marriage, had good reason to apprehend, that he never would prevail with her
voluntarily to make that con∣cession. He knew her perpetual and unrelenting
jealousy against her heir and rival; he was acquainted with her former
reluctance to all proposals of marriage with the Queen of Scots; he
foresaw, that that princess's espousing a person of his power, and
character, and interest, would give the greatest umbrage; and as it would
then become necessary to re-instate Mary in possession of her
throne on some tole∣rable terms, and even endeavour to re-establish her
character, he dreaded, that Elizabeth, whose politics had now taken a
different turn, would never agree to such indulgent and generous conditions.
He therefore endeavoured previously to gain the consent and approbation of
several of the most considerable nobility; and he was successful with
the earls of Pembroke, Arundel, Derby, Bedford, Shrewsbury, Southampton,
Northumberland, Westmoreland, Sussex<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 55. Camden, p. 419. Spotswood, p. 230.</NOTE>. The
lord Lumley, and Sir Nicholas Throcmorton embraced cordially the proposal:
Even the earl of Leicester, Elizabeth's declared favourite, who had forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly en∣tertained <PB N="511" REF="114"/>
some views of espousing Mary, willingly resigned all his pretensions,
and seemed to enter zealously into Norfolk's interests<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 535.</NOTE>. There were other mo∣tives, besides
affection to the duke, which produced this general combination of the
nobility.</P>
<P>SIR William Cecil, secretary of state, was the most
vigilant, active, and pru∣dent minister ever known in England; and as he was
governed by no views but the interests of his sovereign, which he
inflexibly pursued, his authority over her became every day more predominant.
Ever cool himself, and uninfluenced by prejudice or affection, he checked
those sallies of passion, and sometimes of caprice, to which she
was subject; and if he failed of perswading her in the first movement,
his perseverance, and remonstrances, and arguments were sure at last to
recommend themselves to her sound discernment. The more credit he gained
with his mistress, the more was he exposed to the envy of her other
coun∣sellors; and as he had been supposed to adopt the interests of the
house of Suf∣folk, whose claim seemed to carry with it no danger to the
present establishment, his enemies, in opposition to him, were
naturally led to attach themselves to the Queen of Scots. Elizabeth saw,
without uneasiness, this emulation among her courtiers, which served to
augment her authority; and tho' she supported Cecil, wherever matters came
to extremity, and dissipated every conspiracy against him, particularly
one laid about this time to have him thrown into the Tower under some
pretence or other<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 417.</NOTE>, she
never gave him such unlimited confidence as might enable him entirely to
crush his adversaries.</P>
<P>NORFOLK, sensible of the difficulty, which he must meet
with in controling Cecil's councils, especially where they concurred with the
inclinations, as well as interests of the Queen, durst not open to her his
intentions of marrying the Queen of Scots; but proceeded still in the same
course of encreasing his interest in the kingdom, and engaging more of
the nobility to take part in his measures. A letter was wrote to Mary by
Leicester, and signed by several men of the first rank, recommending
Norfolk for her husband, and stipulating conditions for the advantage of
both kingdoms: That she should give sufficient surety to Elizabeth, and
the heirs of her body, for the free enjoyment of the crown of England; that a
perpetual league, offensive and defensive, be made between their realms and
subjects; that the protestant religion be established by law in
Scotland; and that she should grant an amnesty to her rebels in that
kingdom<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 50. Camden, p. 420. Haynes,
p. 535, 539.</NOTE>. When Mary re∣turned a favourable answer to this
application, Norfolk applied himself with new ardor to the execution of his
project; and besides securing the interests of many <PB N="512" REF="115"/> of the considerable gentry and nobility who resided at court, he
wrote letters to such as lived at their country seats, and
possessed the greatest authority in the seve∣ral counties<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 62.</NOTE>. The Kings of France and
Spain, who interested themselves ex∣tremely in Mary's cause, were
secretly consulted, and expressed their approbation of these
measures<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 63.</NOTE>. And tho'
Elizabeth's consent was always supposed as a previous condition to the
finishing this alliance, it was apparently Norfolk's in∣tention, when he
proceeded such lengths without consulting her, to render his party so
strong, that it should no longer be in her power to refuse it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was impossible, that so extensive a conspiracy
could entirely escape the Queen's vigilance and that of Cecil. She dropt
several surmises to the duke, by which he might learn, that she was
acquainted with his designs; and she fre∣quently warned him to beware on
what pillow he reposed his head<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
420. Spotswood, p. 231.</NOTE>: But he never had the prudence or the courage
to open to her his full intentions. The first certain intelligence, which
she received of this dangerous combination was from the earl of Murray<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 71. It appears by Haynes, p. 521, 525, that Queen
Eliza∣beth had heard rumours of Norfolk's dealing with Murray▪ and charged
the latter to inform her of the whole truth, which he accordingly did. See
also the earl of Murray's letter produced on Nor∣folk's trial.</NOTE>, who,
if ever he was sincere in promoting Norfolk's marriage, which is much to be
suspected, had at least proposed, for his own safety and that of his
party, that Elizabeth should, in reality as well as in appearance, be entire
arbiter of the conditions, and should not have her consent extorted by any
confederacy of her own subjects. This information gave great alarm to the
court of England; and the more so, that those intrigues were attended with
other circumstances, of which, it is probable, Elizabeth was not wholly
igno∣rant.</P>
<P>AMONG the nobility and gentry, that seemed to enter into
Norfolk's views, there were many, who were zealously attached to the catholic
religion, who had no other design than that of restoring Mary to her
liberty, and who would gladly, by a combination with foreign powers, or even at
the expence of a civil war, have placed her on the throne of England. The earls
of Northumberland and Westmoreland, who possessed great power in the
north, were leaders of this party; and the former nobleman made offer to the
Queen of Scots, by Leonard Dacres, brother to lord Dacres, that he would free
her from con∣finement, and convey her to Scotland or any other place, to which
she should think proper to retire<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Lesly,
p. 76.</NOTE>. Sir Thomas and Sir Edward Stanley, sons to the earl of Derby,
Sir Thomas Gerard, Rolstone, and other gentlemen, whose interest 
<PB N="513" REF="116"/> lay in the neighbourhood of the place where Mary
resided, concurred in the same views, and required, that, in order to
facilitate the execution of the scheme, a diversion should, in the mean
time, be made from the side of Flanders<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 98.</NOTE>. Nor∣folk discouraged, and even in
appearance suppressed, these conspiracies; both because his duty to
Elizabeth would not allow him to think of effecting his pur∣pose by
rebellion, and because he foresaw, that, if the Queen of Scots came into
the possession of these men, they would rather choose for her
husband the King of Spain, or some foreign prince, who had power, as well
as inclination, to re∣establish the catholic religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN men of honour and good principles, like the duke of
Norfolk, engage in dangerous enterprizes, they are commonly so unfortunate as
to be criminal by halves; and while they ballance between the execution of
their designs and their remorses, their fear of punishment and their hope
of pardon, they render themselves an easy prey to their enemies. The duke,
in order to repress the sur∣mizes, spread against him, spoke
contemptuously to Elizabeth of the Scotch alliance; affirmed that his
estate in England was more valuable than the revenue of a kingdom wasted by
civil wars and factions; and declared, that, when he amused himself in his
own tennis-court at Norwich amidst his friends and vassals, he esteemed
himself at least a petty prince, and was fully contented with his
condition<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 420.</NOTE>. Finding, that
he did not convince her by these asseverations, and that he was looked on
with a jealous eye by the courtiers, he retired to his country-seat without
taking leave<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. He soon after
repented of this measure, and set out on his return to court, with a view
of using every expedient to regain the Queen's good graces; but he was met at
St. Albans by Fitz-Garret, lieutenant of the band of pensioners, by whom he
was conveyed to Burnham, three miles from Windsor, where the court then
resided<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>9.</NOTE>. He was soon after
committed to the Tower, under the custody of Sir Henry Nevil<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 421. Haynes, p

Norfolk before the council<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 80.</NOTE>.
The earl of Pembroke was confined to his own house: Arundel, Lumley, and
Throcmorton were taken into custody. The Queen of Scots herself was
re∣moved to Coventry; all access to her was, during some time, more
strictly pro∣hibited; and the viscount Hereford was joined to the earls of
Shrewsbury and Huntingdon, in the office of guarding her.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrections in the north.</NOTE> A RUMOUR

examine them; but not finding any proof against them, he allowed them to
depart. The report mean∣while gained ground daily; and many appearances of its

two noblemen, to appear at court, and answer for their conduct<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 552.</NOTE>. They had already proceeded so far in
their criminal designs, that they dared not to trust themselves in her

correspondence with the duke of Alva, gover∣nor of the Low Countries; had
obtained his promise of a reinforcement of troops, and of a supply of arms
and ammunition; and had prevailed on him to send over to London Chiapini
Vitelli, one of his most famous captains, under pretence of adjusting
some differences with the Queen, but in reality with a view of put∣ting him
at the head of the northern rebels. The summons, sent to the two earls,
precipitated the rising before they were fully prepared; and Northumber∣land
remained in suspence between opposite dangers, when he was informed, that
some of his enemies were on the way with a commission to arrest him. He
took horse instantly, and hastened to his associate Westmoreland,
whom he found surrounded with his friends and vassals, and deliberating
with regard to the mea∣sures, which he should follow in the present
emergence. They determined to begin the insurrection without delay; and the
great credit of these two noblemen, with that zeal for the catholic religion,
which still prevailed in the neighbourhood, soon drew together multitudes
of the common people. They published a mani∣festo, in which they
maintained, that they intended to attempt nothing against the Queen, to whom
they vowed unshaken allegiance; and that their sole aim was to
re-establish the religion of their ancestors, to remove evil
counsellors, and to restore the duke of Norfolk and other faithful peers to
their liberty and to the Queen's favour<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Cabbala,

thousand foot and sixteen hundred horse, and they expected the
concurrence of all the catholics in Eng∣land<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 663.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen was not negligent in her defence, and she had
beforehand, from her prudent and wise conduct, acquired the general good will
of her people, the best security of a sovereign; insomuch that even the
catholics in most counties ex∣pressed an affection for her service<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 170. Digges, p. 4.</NOTE>; and the duke
of Norfolk himself, tho' he had lost her favour, and lay in confinement,
was not wanting, as far as his situ∣ation permitted, to promote the levies
among his friends and retainers. Sussex, <PB N="515" REF="118"/> attended
with the earls of Rutland, the lords Hunsdon, Evers, and Willoughby of Parham
marched against the rebels at the head of seven thousand men, and found
them already advanced to the bishopric of Durham, of which they had taken
possession. They retired before him to Hexham; and hearing that the
earl of Warwic and lord Clinton were advancing upon them with a greater body,
they found no other expedient but to disperse themselves without
striking a blow. The common people retired to their houses: The leaders
fled into Scotland. Northumberland was found skulking in that country, and
was confined by Mur∣ray to the castle of Lochlevin. Westmoreland received
shelter from the cheif∣tains of the Kers and Scots, partizans of Mary; and
persuaded them to make an inroad into England, with a view of exciting a
quarrel between the two king∣doms. After they had committed great ravages, they
retreated to their own country; and Westmoreland made his escape into
Flanders, where he was pro∣tected. This sudden and precipitate rebellion was
followed soon after by ano∣ther still more imprudent, raised by Leonard
Dacres. Lord Hunsdon, at the head of the garrison of Berwic, was able,
without other assistance, to quell these
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfurgents. Great severity was
exercised against the people, who had taken part in those rash
enterprizes. Sixty-six petty constables were hanged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 423.</NOTE>; and no less than eight hundred persons
are said, on the whole, to have suffered by the hands of the
executioner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 82.</NOTE>. But the
Queen was so well pleased with Norfolk's behaviour, that she released
him from the Tower, allowed him to live under some shew of confinement in
his own house, and only exacted a promise from him not to proceed any
farther in his pretensions to marriage with the Queen of Scots<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.

<P>ELIZABETH now found that the detention of Mary in England was
attended with all the ill consequences, which she had foreseen when she
first embraced that measure. This latter princess recovering, by means of
her misfortunes and her own natural good sense, from that delirium, in
which she seems to have been thrown during her attachment to Bothwel, had
behaved with such modesty and judgment, and even dignity, that every one,
who approached her, was charmed with her demeanor, and her friends were
enabled, on some plausible grounds, to deny the reality of all those
crimes, which had been imputed to her<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lesly,
p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. Haynes, p. 511, 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>. The compassion for her
situation, and the necessity of effecting her relief, proved an
incitement among all her partizans to be active in promoting her cause; and
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her delivery from captivity, it
was thought, could no way be effected but by <PB N="516" REF="119"/> attempts,
dangerous to the established government, Elizabeth had reason to ex∣pect
little tranquillity so long as the Scotch Queen remained a prisoner in her
hands. But as this inconvenience had been preferred to the danger of allowing
that prin∣cess to enjoy her liberty, and to seek relief in all the catholic
courts of Europe, it behoved the Queen to support the measure which she
had adopted, and to guard by every prudent expedient against the mischiefs
to which it was exposed. She still flattered Mary with hopes of her
protection, maintained an ambiguous con∣duct between that Queen and her enemies
in Scotland, negotiated perpetually concerning the terms of her restoration,
made constant professions of friendship to her; and by these
artifices endeavoured both to prevent her from making any desperate efforts
for her delivery, and to satisfy the French and Spanish ambassa∣dors,
who never intermitted their sollicitations, sometimes accompanied with
menaces, in her favour. This deceit was received with the same deceit by the
Queen of Scots: Professions of confidence were returned by professions
equally insincere: And while an appearance of friendship was maintained on
both sides, the animosity and jealousy, which had long prevailed between
them, was every day becoming more inveterate and incurable. These two
princesses, in address, capacity, activity, and spirit, were nearly a
match for each other; but unhap∣pily, Mary, besides her present forlorn
condition, was always inferior in personal conduct and discretion, as well
as in power, to her illustrious rival.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH and Mary wrote at the same time letters to the
regent. The Queen of Scots desired, that her marriage with Bothwel might be
examined, and a divorce legally pronounced between them. The Queen of England
gave Murray the choice of three conditions; that Mary should be restored to
her dignity on certain terms; that she should be associated with her
son, and the ad∣ministration remain in the regent's hands, till the young
prince should come to years of discretion; or that she should be
allowed to live at liberty as a private person in Scotland, and have an
honourable settlement made upon her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MSS. in the
advocate's library. A. 3. 29. p 137. from Cott. Li b. al. c. 1▪</NOTE>.
Murray summoned a convention, in order to deliberate on these proposals
of the two Queens. No answer was made by them to Mary's letter, under
pretence that she had there maintained the style of a sovereign,
addressing herself to her subjects; but in reality, because they
saw that her request was calculated to prepare the way for a marriage with
Norfolk, or some powerful prince, who could support her cause, and
restore her to the throne. They replied to Elizabeth, that the two former
conditions were so derogatory to the royal authority of their prince, that
they could not so much as deliberate concerning them: The third alone 
<PB N="517" REF="120"/> could be the subject of treaty. It was evident, that
Elizabeth, in proposing conditions so unequal in their importance, invited
the Scotch to a refusal of those which were most advantageous to Mary;
and as it was difficult, if not impossible, to adjust all the terms of
the third, so as to render it secure and eligible to all par∣ties, it was
concluded that she was not sincere in any of them<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 230, 231. Lesly, p 71.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1570" UNIT="year"/> IT is pretended, that Murray
had entered into a private negociation with the Queen, to get Mary delivered
into his hands<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Camden, p 425. Lesly, p.
83.</NOTE>; and as Elizabeth found the de∣tention of her in England so
dangerous, it is probable, that she would have been pleased, on any
honourable or safe terms, to rid herself of a prisoner who gave her so
much inquietude. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 January.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assassination of the earl of
Murray.</NOTE> But all these projects vanished by the sudden death of the
regent, who was assassinated, in revenge of a private injury, by a
gentleman of the name of Hamilton. Murray was a person of considerable
vigour, ability, and constancy; but tho' he was not unsuccessful, during
his regency, in com∣posing the dissentions in Scotland, his talents
shone out more eminently in the beginning than in the end of his life. His
manners were rough and austere; and he possessed not that perfect
integrity, which frequently accompanies, and can alone atone for, that
unamiable character.</P>
<P>BY the death of the regent, Scotland relapsed into its former
anarchy. Mary's party assembled together, and made themselves masters
of Edinburgh. The castle, commanded by Kirkaldy of Grange, seemed to favour
her cause; and as many of the principal nobility had embraced that side, it
became probable, tho' the people were in general averse to her, that her
authority might again acquire the ascendant. To check its progress,
Elizabeth dispatched Sussex, with an ar∣my, to the North, under colour of
chastizing the ravages committed by the borderers. He entered Scotland, and
laid waste the lands of the Kers and Scots, seized the castle of Hume,
and committed hostilities on all Mary's partizans, who, he said, had
offended his mistress, by harbouring the English rebels. Sir William
Drury was afterwards sent with a body of troops, and he threw down the
houses of the Hamiltons, who were engaged in the same faction. The
Eng∣lish armies were afterwards recalled by agreement with the Queen of
Scots, who promised, that no French troops should be introduced into
Scotland, and that the English rebels should, by her partizans, be
delivered up to the Queen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 91.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the Queen, covering herself with the pretence of
revenging her own quarrel, so far contributed to support the party of the
young King, she was cautious not to declare openly against the Queen of
Scots; and sh even sent a <PB N="518" REF="121"/> request, which was equal
to a command, to the enemies of that princess, not to elect, during some
time, a regent in the place of Murray<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 240.</NOTE>. Lenox, the King's grandfather, was,
therefore, chosen temporary governor, under the title of Lieutenant. Hearing
afterwards, that Mary's partizans, instead of deliver∣ing up Westmoreland,
and the other fugitives, as they had promised, had allow∣ed them to escape
into Flanders; she permitted the King's party to give Le∣nox the title of
regent<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 241.</NOTE>, and she sent
Randolf, as her resident, to maintain a correspondence with him. But
notwithstanding this slep, taken in favour of Mary's enemies, she never
laid aside her ambiguous conduct, or quitted the pre∣tensions of amity to
that princess. Being importuned by the bishop of Ross, and her other
agents, as well as by foreign ambassadors, she twice procured a
suspension of arms between the Scotch factions, and by that means
stopped the hands of the regent, who was likely to obtain advantages over the
opposite par∣ty<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 243.</NOTE>. By
these seeming contrarieties she kept alive the factions in Scotland,
in∣creased their mutual animosity, and rendered the whole country a scene
of de∣vastation and of misery<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p.
1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.</NOTE>. She had no intention
to conquer the kingdom, and consequently no interest nor design to
instigate the parties against each other; but this consequence was an
accidental effect of her cautious politics, by which she was engaged, as far
as possible, to keep on good terms with the Queen of Scots, and never to
violate the appearances of friendship with her, at least those of
neutrality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir James Melvil, p. 108, 109, ascribes to
Elizabeth a positive design of animating the Scotch facti∣ons against
each other; but his evidence is too inconsiderable to counterballance many
other authorities, and is, indeed, contrary to her posterior conduct, as well
as her interests, and the necessity of her situa∣tion. It was plainly
her interest, that the King's party should prevail, and nothing could have
engaged her to stop their progress, or even forbear from openly
assisting them, but her intention of still amusing the Queen of
Scots, by the hopes of being peaceably restored to her throne. See farther,
Strype, vol. II. Appen. p. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE better to amuse Mary with the prospect of an
accommodation, Cecil and Sir Walter Mildway were sent to her, with
proposals from Elizabeth. The terms were somewhat rigorous, such as a
captive Queen might expect from a jealous rival; and they thereby bore the
greater appearance of sincerity on the part of the English court. It was
required, that the Queen of Scots, besides renouncing all title to the crown
of England during the life-time of Elizabeth, should make a perpetual league,
offensive and defensive, between the kingdoms; that she should marry no
Englishman without Elizabeth's consent, nor any other person without the
consent of the states of Scotland; that redress should be made 
<PB N="519" REF="122"/> for the late ravages committed in England; that
justice should be executed on the murderers of the late King; that the
young prince should be sent into Eng∣land, to be educated there; that six
hostages, all of them noblemen, should be delivered to the Queen of
England, with the castle of Hume, and some other fortress, for the
security of performance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswoood, p. 245.
Lesly, 101.</NOTE>. Such were the conditions upon which Elizabeth promised
to contribute her endeavours towards the restoration of the de∣posed Queen.
The necessity of Mary's affairs obliged her to consent to them; and the
Kings of France and Spain, as well as the pope, when consulted by her,
approved of her conduct; chiefly on account of the civil wars by which all
Eu∣rope was at that time agitated, and which incapacitated the catholic princes
from giving her any assistance<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p.
109, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH'S commissioners proposed also to Mary a plan
of accommodation with her subjects in Scotland; and after some reasoning
on that head, it was agreed, that the Queen should require Lenox, the regent,
to send up commissi∣oners, to treat of conditions under her mediation.
The partizans of Mary boast∣ed, that all terms were fully settled with the
court of England, and that the Scotch rebels would soon be constrained to
submit to the restoration of their sove∣reign: But Elizabeth took care
that these rumours should meet with no credit, and that the King's party
should not be discouraged, nor sink too low in their demands. Cecil wrote
to inform the regent, that all the Queen of England's proposals, so far
from being fixed and irrevocable, were to be discussed anew in the
conference; and desired him to send commissioners, who should be
constant to the King's cause, and cautious not to make concessions
which might be preju∣dicial to their party<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Spotswood p. 245.</NOTE>. Sussex also, in his letters,
dropped hints to the same purpose; and Elizabeth herself said to the
abbot of Dunfermling, whom Lenox had sent to the court of England, that she
would not insist on Mary's restoration, provided the Scotch could make
the justice of their cause appear to her satisfac∣tion; and that even, if
their reasons should fall short of full conviction, she would take
effectual care to provide for their future security<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 247, 248.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1571" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st of March,</NOTE> THE Scotch Parliament
appointed the Earl of Morton, the Abbot of Dun∣fermling, and Sir James Macgill
to manage the treaty. These commissioners first presented memorials,
containing reasons for the deposition of their Queen; and they seconded
their arguments, with examples drawn from the Scotch history, with the
authority of laws, and with the sentiments of many famous divines. The
losty ideas, which Elizabeth had entertained of the absolute, indese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zable <PB N="520" REF="123"/> right of
sovereigns, made her be shocked with these republican topics; and she
told the Scotch commissioners, that she was no-wise satisfied with
their reasons for justifying the conduct of their countrymen; and that they
might therefore pro∣ceed to propose the conditions, which they required for
their security<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 248, 249.</NOTE>. They
replied, that their commission did not empower them to treat of any terms,
which might infringe the title and sovereignty of their young king; but they
would gladly hear whatever proposals should be made them by her majesty.
The con∣ditions, recommended by the Queen, were not disadvantageous to Mary;
but as the commissioners still insisted, that they were not
authorized to treat, in any manner, concerning the restoration of that
Princess<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Haynes, 623.</NOTE>, the conferences
were ne∣cessarily at an end; and Elizabeth dismissed the Scotch
commissioners with in∣junctions, that they should return, after having
procured more ample powers from their Parliament<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 249, 250, &amp;c. Lesly, p. 133, 136. Camden, p.
431, 432.</NOTE>. The bishop of Ross complained openly to the English
council, that they had abused his mistress by fair promises and
professions; and Mary herself was no longer at a loss to judge of
Elizabeth's insincerity. By reason of these disappointments, matters
came still nearer to extremity between the two Princesses; and the Queen
of Scots, finding all her hopes eluded, was more strongly incited to make, at
all hazards, every possible attempt for her li∣berty and security.</P>
<P>AN incident also happened about this time, which tended to
widen the breach between Mary and Elizabeth, and to encrease the vigilance
and jealousy of the latter Princess. Pope Pius the fifth, who had
succeeded Paul, after having en∣deavoured in vain to conciliate by gentle
means the friendship of Elizabeth, whom his predecessor's violence had
irritated, issued at last a bull of excommu∣nication against her,
deprived her of all title to the crown, and absolved her sub∣jects from
their oaths of allegiance<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
427.</NOTE>. It seems probable, that this attack on the Queen's authority was
made in concert with Mary, who intended by that means to forward the northern
rebellion; a measure, which was at that time pro∣jected<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 441, from Caietanus Life of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us the fifth.</NOTE>. John Felton
affixed this bull to the gates of the bishop of London's palace; and
scorning either to fly or deny the fact, he was seized, and condemned, and
received the crown of martyrdom, for which he appears to have entertained so
violent an ambition<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 428.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of April. A Parliament.</NOTE> A new
Parliament, after five years interval, was assembled at Westminster;
and as the Queen, by the rage of the pope against her, was become still
more <PB N="521" REF="124"/> the head of the ruling party, it might be expected,
both from this incident and from her own prudent and vigorous conduct, that her
authority over the two houses would be absolutely uncontrouleable. It was
so in fact; yet is it remark∣able, that it prevailed not without some
small opposition; and that too arising chiefly from the height of zeal
for protestantism; a disposition of the English, which, in general,
contributed extremely to encrease the Queen's popularity. We shall be
somewhat particular in relating the transactions of this fession,
be∣cause they show, as well the extent of the royal power during that age,
as the disposition of Elizabeth and the genius of her government. It will
be curious also to observe the faint dawnings of the spirit of liberty in
the English, the jea∣lousy with which that spirit was repressed by
the sovereign, the imperious con∣duct which was maintained in opposition to
it, and the ease with which it was subdued by this arbitrary
Princess.</P>
<P>THE Lord keeper, Bacon, after the speaker of the commons was
elected, told the Parliament, in the Queen's name, that she enjoined them not
to meddle with any matters of state<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p.
141.</NOTE>: Such was his expression; by which he probably meant, the
questions of the Queen's marriage and the succession, about which they
had before given her some trouble: For as to the other great points of
government, alliances, peace and war, or foreign negotiations; no Parliament in
that age ever had the presumption to take them under consideration, or
question, in these par∣ticulars, the conduct of their sovereign.</P>
<P>IN the former Parliament, the puritans had introduced seven
bills for a far∣ther reformation in religion; but they had not been able to
prevail in any one of them<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 185.</NOTE>.
This house of commons had sat a very few days, when Stricland, a member,
revived one of the bills, that for the amendment of the liturgy<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 156, 157.</NOTE>. The chief objection, which
he mentioned, was the sign of the cross in baptism. Ano∣ther member
added, the kneeling at the sacrament; and remarked, that if a pos∣ture of
humiliation was requisite in that act of devotion, it were better, that the
communicants should throw themselves prostrate on the ground, in order to
keep at the widest distance from former superstition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>RELIGION was a point, of which Elizabeth was, if possible,
still more jea∣lous than of matters of state. She pretended, that, in
quality of supreme head or governor of the church, she was fully empowered,
by her prerogative alone, to decide all questions which might arise with
regard to doctrine, discipline, or wor∣ship; and she never would allow
her Parliaments so much as to take these points <PB N="522" REF="125"/> into
consideration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 158.</NOTE>. The courtiers
forgot not to insist on this topic: The treasurer of the houshold, tho'
he allowed, that any heresy might be condemn∣ed by Parliament, (a
concession which seems to have been very rash and unguard∣ed; since
the act, investing the crown with the supremacy, or rather acknow∣ledging
that prerogative, gave the sovereign full power to reform all heresies) yet
he affirmed, that it belonged to the Queen alone, as head of the church, to
regulate every question of ceremony in worship<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 166.</NOTE>. The comptroller seconded this argument;
insisted on the extent of the Queen's prerogative; and said, that the
house might, from former examples, have taken warning not to meddle with
such matters. One Pistor opposed these remonstrances of the
courtiers. He was scandalized, he said, that affairs of such infinite
consequence (viz. kneeling and making the sign of the cross) should be
passed over so lightly. These questions, he added, concern the
salvation of our souls, and interest every one of us more deeply than the
monarchy of the whole world. This cause he shewed to be God's; the rest
were all but terrene, yea trifles in comparison, call you them ever so
great: Subsidies, crowns, kingdoms, he knew not what weight they had, when
laid in the ballance with subjects of such unspeakable importance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Tho' the zeal of this member seems to
have been highly approved of, the house, over∣awed by the prerogative, voted
upon the question, that a petition should be pre∣sented to her majesty,
for her licence to proceed farther in this bill; and in the mean time to stop
all debate or reasoning concerning it<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MATTERS would probably have rested here, had not the Queen
been so highly offended with Stricland's presumption, in moving the bill
for reformation of the liturgy, that she sent for him to the council, and
prohibited him thenceforth to appear in the house of commons<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>. That act of power was too
violent even for this submissive Parliament to endure. Carleton took
notice of the matter, com∣plained that the liberties of the house were
violated; observed that Stricland was not a private man, but represented a
multitude; and moved, that he might be sent for, and if he was guilty of any
offence, might answer for it at the bar of the house, which he insinuated
to be the only competent tribunal<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.
Yelverton enforced the principles of liberty with still greater boldness.
He said, that the precedent was dangerous: And tho' in this happy time of
lenity, among so many good and honourable personages as were at present
invested with authority, no∣thing of extremity or injury was to be
apprehended; yet the times might alter; what now is permitted, hereafter might
be construed as duty, and might be en∣forced <PB N="523" REF="126"/> even on
the ground of the present permission. He added, that all matters not
treasonable, or which implied <HI>too much</HI> derogation of the imperial
crown, might, without offence, be introduced into Parliament; where every
question that con∣cerned the community, must be considered, and where
even the right of the crown itself must finally be determined. He remarked,
that men sat not in that house in their private capacities, but as elected
by their country; and tho' it was proper, that the prince should retain his
prerogative, yet was that preroga∣tive limited by law: As the sovereign could
not of himself make laws, neither could he break them, merely from his own
authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 175, 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE principles were popular, and noble, and generous; but the
open asser∣tion of them was somewhat new in England: And the courtiers
were more war∣ranted by present practice, when they advanced a contrary
doctrine. The trea∣surer warned the house to be cautious in their
proceedings; neither to venture farther than their assured warrant might
extend, nor hazard their good opinion with her majesty in any doubtful
cause. The member, he said, whom they re∣quired, was not detained on
account of any liberty of speech, but for the exhibit∣ing a bill in the
house against the prerogative of the Queen; a temerity which was not to be
tolerated. And he concluded with observing, that even speeches made in that
house, have been questioned and examined by the sovereign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>. Cleere, another member,
remarked, that the sovereign's prerogative is not so much as disputable,
and that the safety of the Queen is the safety of the subjects. He added,
that in questions of divinity, every man was for his instruction to re∣pair
to his ordinary; and he seems to imply, that the bishops themselves, for
their instruction, must repair to the Queen<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Mr. Fleetwood observed, that, in his memory, he
knew a man, who, in the fifth of the present Queen, had been called to
account for a speech in the house. But left this example should be
esteemed too recent, he would inform them, from the parliament rolls, that in
the reign of Henry the fifth, a bishop was committed to prison by the
King's command, on account of his freedom of speech; and the Parliament
presumed not to go farther than to be humble suitors for him: In the
subsequent reign, the speaker himself was committed, with another
member; and the house found no other remedy than a like submissive
application. He advised the house to have recourse to the same
expedient; and not to presume, either to send for their member, or demand
him as of right<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. During this speech, those members of the
council who sat in the house, whispered together; upon which the
speaker moved, that the house should make stay of all farther
proceedings: A motion, <PB N="524" REF="127"/> which was immediately complied
with. The Queen, finding that the experiment which she had made, was likely
to excite a great commotion, saved her honour by this silence of the
house; and that the question might no more be resumed, she sent next
day to Stricland her permission to give his attendance in Parlia∣ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this rebuke from the throne, the zeal of the
commons still engaged them to continue the discussion of those other
bills which regarded religion; but they were interrupted by a still more
arbitrary proceeding of the Queen, in which the lords condescended to be her
instrument. That house sent a message to the commons, desiring that
a committee might attend them. Some members were accordingly appointed for that
purpose; and the upper house in∣formed them, that the Queen's majesty
being informed of the articles of reforma∣tion which they had canvassed,
approved of them, intended to publish them, and to make the bishops execute
them, by virtue of her regal authority, as su∣preme head of the church of
England: But that she would not permit them to be treated of in
Parliament<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 180, 185.</NOTE>. The
house, tho' they did not entirely stop pro∣ceedings on account of this
injunction, seem no-wise to have been offended at such haughty treatment;
and in the issue all their bills came to nothing.</P>
<P>A MOTION, made by Robert Bell, a puritan, against an
exclusive patent grant∣ed to a company of merchants at Bristol<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 158.</NOTE>, gave also occasion to
some remark∣able incidents. The Queen, some days after the motion was made,
sent her or∣ders, by the mouth of the speaker, commanding the house to
spend little time in motions, and to avoid long speeches. All the members
understood that she had been offended, because a matter had been moved
which seemed to touch her prerogative<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
159.</NOTE>. Fleetwood accordingly spoke of this delicate subject. He
ob∣served, that the Queen had a prerogative of granting patents; that to
question the validity of any patent, was to invade the royal prerogative;
that all foreign trade was entirely subjected to the pleasure of the
sovereign; that even the statute which gave liberty of commerce, admitted
of all prohibitions from the crown; and that the prince, when he granted an
exclusive patent, only employed the power vested in him, and prohibited all
others from dealing in any particular branch of commerce. He quoted the Clerk
of the Parliament's book, to prove, that no man might speak in Parliament of
the statute of wills, unless the King first gave licence; because the
royal prerogative in the wards was thereby touch∣ed. He shewed likewise the
statutes of Edward the first, Edward the third, and Henry the fourth, with
a saving of the prerogative. And in Edward the sixth's 
<PB N="525" REF="128"/> time, the protector was applied to, for his allowance to
mention matters of pre∣rogative<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p.
160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR Humphrey Gilbert, the gallant sea-adventurer, carried
these topics still farther. He endeavoured to prove, the motion made by
Bell; to be a vain de∣vice, and perillous to be treated of; since it tended
to the derogation of the pre∣rogative imperial, which, whoever should attempt
so much as in fancy, could not, he said, be otherwise accounted than an
open enemy. For what difference is there between saying, that the Queen is
not to use the privilege of the crown, and saying that she is not Queen?
And tho' experience has shewn so much cle∣mency in her majesty, as might,
perhaps, make the subjects forget their duty; it is not good to sport or
venture too much with princes. He remembered them of the fable of the hare,
who, upon the proclamation, that all horned beasts should depart the court,
immediately fled, lest his ears should be construed to be horns; and by
this apologue he seems to insinuate, that even those who heard or
permitted such dangerous speeches, would not themselves be entirely free
from danger. He desired them to beware, lest, if they meddled farther with
these matters, the Queen might look to her own power, and finding herself
able to suppress their challenged liberty, and to exert an arbitrary
authority, might imi∣tate the example of Lewis the eleventh of France, who, as
he termed it, deli∣vered the crown from wardship<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 168.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' this speech gave some disgust, no body, at the
time, replied any thing, but that Sir Humphrey mistook the meaning of the
house, and of the member who made the motion: They never had other purpose,
than to represent their grievances in due and seemly form unto her
majesty. But, in a subsequent de∣bate, Peter Wentworth, a man of a
superior free spirit, called that speech an in∣sult on the house;
noted Sir Humphrey's disposition to flatter and fawn on the prince;
compared him to the cameleon, which can change itself into all colours,
except white; and recommended to the house, a due care of liberty of
speech, and of the privileges of Parliament<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>. It appears, on the whole, that the mo∣tion
against the exclusive patent had no effect. Bell, the member who first
in∣troduced it, was sent for by the council, and was severely reprimanded
for his temerity. He returned to the house with such an amazed countenance,
that all the members, well informed of the reason, were struck with terror;
and during some time, no one durst rise to speak of any matter of
importance, for fear of giving offence to the Queen and the council. Even after
the fears of the com∣mons were somewhat abated, the members spoke with
extreme precaution; and <PB N="526" REF="129"/> by employing most of their
discourse in preambles and apologies, they shewed their conscious
terror of the rod which was hanging over them. Wherever any delicate point was
touched; tho' ever so gently; nay seemed to be approached, tho' at ever
so great a distance, the whisper ran about the house, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Queen will be offended; the council will be
extremely displeased:"</Q> And by these sur∣mizes men were warned of
the danger to which they exposed themselves. It is remarkable, that the
patent which the Queen defended with such imperious vio∣lence, was contrived
for the profit of four courtiers, and was attended with the utter ruin of
seven or eight thousand of her industrious subjects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 242.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> THUS every thing which
passed the two houses, was extremely respectful and submissive;
yet did the Queen think it incumbent on her, at the conclusion of the
session, to check, and that with great severity, those feeble efforts
for liberty, which had appeared in the motions and speeches of some
members. The lord keeper told the commons, in her majesty's name, that, tho'
the majority of the lower house had shewed themselves, in their
proceedings, discreet, and dutiful, yet a few of them had discovered a
contrary character, and had justly merited the reproach of audacious,
arrogant, and presumptuous: Contrary to their duty, both as subjects and
parliament-men, nay contrary to the express injunctions given them from the
throne at the beginning of the session; injunctions, which it might well
have become them to have better attended to; they had presumed to call in
question her majesty's grants and prerogatives. But her majesty warns
them, that since they will thus wilfully forget themselves, they are
otherwise to be admonished: Some other species of correction must be
found for them; since neither the commands of her majesty, nor the example
of their wiser brethren, can reclaim their audacious, arrogant, and
presumptuous folly, by which they are thus led to meddle with what no way
belongs to them, and what lies not within the compass of their
understanding<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN all these transactions appears clearly the opinion which
Elizabeth had en∣tertained of the duty and authority of Parliaments. They were
not to canvass any matters of state: Still less were they to meddle with
the church. Questions of either kind were far above their reach, and were
appropriated to the prince alone, or to those councils and ministers with
whom he was pleased to entrust them. What then was the office of
Parliaments? They might give directions for the due tanning of leather, or
milling of cloth; for the preservation of phea∣sants and partridges; for
the reparation of bridges and highways; for the pu∣nishment of vagabonds or
common beggars. Regulations concerning the police of the country came properly
under their inspection; and the laws of this kind <PB N="527" REF="130"/>
which they prescribed, had, if not a greater, yet a more durable authority,
than those derived solely from the proclamations of the sovereign.
Precedents or re∣ports could fix a rule for decisions in private property, or
the punishment of crimes; but no alteration or innovation in the municipal
law could proceed from any other source than the Parliament; nor would the
courts of justice be induced to change their established practice by an
order of council. But the most ac∣ceptable part of parliamentary
transactions was the granting of subsidies; the attainting and
punishing the obnoxious nobility, or any minister of state after his
fall; the countenancing such great efforts of power, as might be deemed
some∣what exceptionable, where they proceeded entirely from the sovereign.
The re∣dress of grievances was sometimes promised to the people; but
seldom could have place, while it was an established rule, that the
prerogatives of the crown must not be abridged, or so much as questioned
and examined in Parliament. Even tho' monopolies and exclusive companies had
already reached an enormous height, and were every day encreasing, to the
destruction of all liberty, and extinction of all industry; it was criminal
in a member to propose, in the most dutiful and regular manner, a
parliamentary application against any of them.</P>
<P>THESE maxims of government were not kept secret by Elizabeth,
or smoothed over by any fair appearances or plausible pretences. They were
openly avowed in her speeches and messages to Parliament; and were
accompanied with all the haughtiness, nay sometimes bitterness of
expression, which the meanest servant could look for from his offended
master. Yet notwithstanding this conduct, Elizabeth continued the most
popular sovereign that ever swayed the scepter of England; because the
maxims of her reign were conformable to the principles of the times, and to the
opinion which was generally entertained with regard to the constitution. The
continued encroachments of popular assemblies on Eliza∣beth's
successors have so changed our ideas of these matters, that the
passages above mentioned appear to us extremely curious, and even at
first surprizing; but they were so little remarked, during the time, that
neither Camden, tho' a contemporary writer, nor any other historian, has
taken any notice of them. So absolute was the authority of the crown, that
the precious spark of liberty had been kindled, and was preserved, by the
puritans alone; and it was to this sect, whose principles appear so
frivolous and habits so ridiculous, that the English owe the whole freedom
of their constitution. Actuated by that zeal which be∣longs to innovators,
and by the courage which enthusiasm inspires, they hazarded the utmost
indignation of their sovereign; and employing all their industry to be
elected into Parliament; a matter not difficult, while a feat was rather
regarded <PB N="528" REF="131"/> as a burthen than an advantage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appeared this session, that a bribe of four pounds

probable, that the member had no other view but the privilege of being free
from arrests.</NOTE>; they first acquired a majority in that assembly,
and then obtained an ascendant over the church and monarchy.</P>
<P>THE following were the principal laws enacted this session
of Parliament. It was declared treason, during the life-time of the Queen, to
affirm, that she was not the lawful sovereign, or that any other
possessed a better title, or that she was an heretic, schismatic,
or infidel, or that the laws and statutes cannot limit and de∣termine the
right of the crown and the successor thereof: To maintain in writing or
printing, that any person, except the <HI>natural issue</HI> of her body,
is or ought to be the Queen's heir or successor, subjected the person
and all his abettors, for the first offence, to imprisonment during a year,
and to the forfeiture of half their goods: The second offence subjected
them to the penalty of a premunire<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eliz. c. 1.</NOTE>. This law was
plainly leveled against the Queen of Scots and her partizans; and implyed an
avowal, that Elizabeth never intended to declare her successor▪ It
may be noted, that the usual phrase of <HI>lawful issue,</HI> which the
Parliament thought indecent towards the Queen, as if she could be
supposed to have any other, was changed into that of <HI>natural
issue.</HI> But this alteration was the source of great ridicule during
the time; and some persons suspected a deeper design, as if
Leicester intended, in case of the Queen's death, to produce some
bastard of his own, and affirm that he was her offspring<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 436.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was also enacted, that whosoever by bulls shall
publish absolutions or other rescripts of the pope, or shall by means
of them reconcile any man to the church of Rome, such offenders, as well as
those who were so reconciled, should be guilty of treason. The penalty
of a premunire was imposed on every one who imported any <HI>Agnus Dei,</HI>
crucifix, or such other implement of superstition, con∣secrated by the
pope<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">13 Eliz. c. 2.</NOTE>. The former laws
against taking interest, which was de∣nominated usury, were enforced by a
new statute<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 8.</NOTE>. A supply of
one subsidy and two fifteenths was granted by Parliament. The Queen, as
she was deter∣mined to yield to them none of her power, was very cautious of
asking from them any supplies. She endeavoured, either by a rigid frugality
to make her ordinary revenues suffice for the necessities of the crown,
or she employed her prerogative and acquired money by the granting of
patents, monopolies, or by some such ruinous expedient.</P>
<P>THO' Elizabeth possessed such uncontrouled authority
over her parliaments, and such extensive influence over her people; tho'
during a course of thirteen <PB N="529" REF="132"/> years, she had been able
to maintain the public tranquillity, which was only in∣terrupted by the hasty
and ill concerted insurrection of the north; she was still kept in great
anxiety, and felt her throne perpetually totter under her. The violent
commotions, excited in France and the Low Countries, as well as in Scot∣land,
seemed in one view to secure her against any disturbance; but they
served, on more reflection, to instruct her in the danger of her
situation, when she re∣marked, that England, no less than these
neighbouring countries, contained the seeds of intestine discord, the
differences of religious opinion, and the furious intolerance and animosity
of the opposite sectaries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of France.</NOTE> THE league,
formed at Bayonne in 1566 for the extermination of the prote∣stants, had not
been concluded so secretly but intelligence of it had reached Condé,
Coligni, and the other leaders of the hugonots; and finding, that the
measures of the court agreed with their suspicions, they were determined
to prevent the cruel perfidy of their enemies, and to strike a blow before
the catholics were aware of the danger. The hugonots, tho' dispersed over
the whole kingdom, formed a kind of empire within itself; and being closely
united, as well by their religious zeal, as by the dangers, to which they were
perpetually exposed, they obeyed with entire submission the orders of
their leaders, and were ready on every alarm to fly to arms. The King and
Queen-mother were living in great security at Monceaux in Brie; when they
found themselves surrounded by protestant troops, which had secretly
marched thither from all quarters; and had not a body of Swiss come hastily
to their relief, and conducted them with great intrepidity to Paris, they
must have fallen, without resistance, into the hands of the
insur∣gents. A battle was afterwards fought in the plains of St. Dennis,
where, tho' the old constable Montmorency, the general of the catholics, was
killed combating bravely at the head of his troops, the hugonots were finally
defeated. Condé collecting his broken troops, and receiving a strong
reinforcement from the Ger∣man protestants, appeared again in the field; and
laying siege to Chartres, a place of great importance, obliged the court to
agree to a new accommodation. Such was the mutual animosity of these
religionists, that, even had the leaders on both sides been ever so
sincere in their intentions for peace, and reposed ever so great
con∣fidence in each other, it would have been difficult to have retained the
people in tranquillity; much more, where such extreme jealousy prevailed,
and where the court employed every pacification as a snare for their enemies.
A plan was laid for seizing the person of the prince and admiral; who
narrowly escaped to Rochelle, and summoned their partizans to their
assistance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. 4.</NOTE>. The civil wars
<PB N="530" REF="133"/> were renewed with greater fury than ever, and the
parties became still more ex∣asperated against each other. The young duke
of Anjou, brother to the King, commanded the forces of the catholics; and
fought in 1569 a great battle at Jarnac with the hugonots, where the prince of
Condé was killed, and his army defeated. This discomfiture, with the
loss of so great a leader, reduced not the hugonots to despair. The
admiral still supported the cause; and having placed at the head of the
protestants, the prince of Navarre, then sixteen years of age, and the
young prince of Condé, he encouraged the party rather to perish
bravely in the field, than ignominiously by the hands of the executioner. He
collected such numbers, so determined to endure every extremity, that he
was enabled to make head against the duke of Anjou; and being strengthened
by a new reinforcement of Germans, he obliged that prince to retreat and to
divide his forces. Coligni then laid siege to Poitiers; and as the eyes of
all France were turned on this en∣terprize, the duke of Guise, emulous of the
renown, which his father had ac∣quired by the defence of Metz, threw himself
into the place, and so animated the garrison by his valour and conduct,
that the admiral was obliged to raise the siege. Such was the commencement
of that unrivaled fame and grandeur, after∣wards attained by this duke of
Guise. The attachment, which all the catholics had borne to his father, was
immediately transferred to the son; and men pleased themselves in
comparing all the great and heroic qualities, which seemed, in a manner,
hereditary in that family. Equal in affability, in munificence, in ad∣dress,
in eloquence, and in every quality, which engages the affections of men; equal
also in valour, in conduct, in enterprize, in capacity; there seemed only
this difference between them, that the son, educated in more turbulent times,
and finding a greater dissolution of all law and order, exceeded the father
in ambition and temerity, and was engaged in enterprizes still more
destructive to the authority of his sovereign and to the repose of his
native country.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, who kept her attention fixed on the civil commotions
of France, was no wise pleased with this new rise of her enemies, the
Guises; and being anxious for the fate of the protestants, whose
interests were connected with her own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p.
471.</NOTE>, she was engaged, notwithstanding her aversion against all
rebellion, and all opposition to the will of the sovereign, to give them
secretly some assistance. Besides employing her authority with the
German princes, she sent money to the Queen of Navarre, and received some
jewels as pledges for the loan. And she permitted Henry Champernon to levy,
and transport over into France, a re∣giment of an hundred gentlemen
voluntiers; among whom Walter Raleigh, then a young man, began to
distinguish himself in that great school of military va∣lour 
<PB N="531" REF="134"/><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 423.</NOTE>.
The admiral, constrained by the impatience of his troops, and by the
difficulty of subsisting them, fought with the duke of Anjou, the battle
of Mon∣contour in Poictou, where he was wounded and defeated. The court of
France, notwithstanding their frequent experience of the obstinacy of the
hugonots, and the vigour of Coligni, vainly flattered themselves that the
force of the rebels was at last finally annihilated; and they neglected
farther preparations against a foe, who, they thought, could never more
become dangerous. They were sur∣prized to hear, that that leader had appeared
in another quarter of the kingdom; had encouraged the young princes, whom he
governed, to equal constancy; had assembled an army; had taken the field;
and was even strong enough to threaten Paris. The public finances,
diminished by the continued disorders of the king∣dom, and wasted by so
many fruitless military enterprizes, could no longer bear the charge of a new
armament; and the King, notwithstanding his extreme ani∣mosity against
the hugonots, was obliged, in 1570, to conclude an accommodation with them, to
grant them a pardon for all past offences, and to renew the edicts for
liberty of conscience.</P>
<P>THO' a pacification was seemingly concluded, the mind of
Charles was no way reconciled to his rebellious subjects; and this
accommodation, like all the forego∣ing, was nothing but a snare, by which the
perfidious court had projected to destroy at once, without danger, all its
formidable enemies. As the two young princes, the admiral, and all the leaders
of the hugonots, instructed by past ex∣perience, discovered an extreme
distrust of the King's intentions, and kept them∣selves in security, at
a distance, all possible artifices were employed to remove their
apprehensions, and convince them of the sincerity of the new councils,
which seemed to be embraced. The terms of the peace were exactly observed
to them; the toleration was regularly maintained; all attempts, made by the
zealous catholics to infringe it, were punished with severity; offices, and
favours, and honours were bestowed on the principal nobility among the
protestants; and the King and council every where declared, that, tired of
civil disorders, and convinced of the impossibility of forcing men's
conscience, they were thenceforth determined to allow every one the free
exercise of his religion.</P>
<P>AMONG the other artifices, employed to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull the protestants into a fatal
security, Charles assected to enter into close connexions with
Elizabeth; and as it seemed not the interest of France to forward the union
of the two kingdoms of Great Britain, that princess the more easily
flattered herself, that the French monarch would prefer her friendship to
that of the Queen of Scots. The better to deceive her, proposals of marriage
were made her with the duke of Anjou; a prince <PB N="532" REF="135"/> whose
youth, beauty, and reputation for valour might naturally be supposed to
recommend him to a woman, who had appeared not altogether indifferent to
these endowments. The Queen immediately founded on this offer the project of
deceiv∣ing the court of France; and being intent on the artifice of that
scheme, she laid herself the more open to be deceived. Negotiations were
entered into with regard to the marriage; terms of the contract were
proposed; difficulties started and re∣moved; and the two courts, equally
insincere, tho' not equally criminal, seemed to approach every day nearer
each other in their demands and concessions. The great obstacle seemed
to lie in adjusting the differences of religion; because Elizabeth, who
recommended toleration to Charles, was determined not to grant it in her own
dominions, not even to her husband; and the duke of Anjou seemed unwilling
to submit, for the sake of interest, to the dishonour of an
apostacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p 433. Davila▪ lib. 5. Digges's
Compleat Ambassador, p. 84, 101, 111.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE artificial politics of Elizabeth never triumphed so much
in any contivances as in those which were conjoined with her coquetry; and as
her character in this particular was generally known, the court of France
thought that they might, without danger of forming any final conclusion,
venture the farther in their con∣cessions and offers to her. The Queen
also had other motives for dissimulation. Besides the advantage of
discouraging Mary's partizans by the prospect of an al∣liance between
France and England, her situation with Philip demanded her ut∣most
vigilance and attention; and the present revolutions in the Low Countries
made her glad of fortifying herself even with the appearance of a new
con∣federacy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the Low Coun∣tries.</NOTE> THE
theological controversies, which had long agitated Europe, had, from the
beginning, penetrated into the Low Countries; and as these provinces
main∣tained a very extensive commerce, they had early received from every
king∣dom, with which they corresponded, a tincture of religious innovation.
An opinion at that time prevailed, which had been zealously propagated by the
priests, and implicitly received by sovereigns, that heresy was closely
connected with rebellion, and that every great or violent alteration in the
church involved a like revolution in the state and civil government. The
forward zeal of the reformers would seldom allow them to wait the consent
of the magistrate to their innovations; they became less dutiful when they
were opposed and per∣secuted; and tho' their pretended spirit of
reasoning and enquiry was in reality nothing but a new species of implicit
faith, the prince took the alarm; as if no institutions could be secure
from the temerity of their researches. The emperor <PB N="533" REF="136"/>
Charles, who proposed to augment his authority under the pretence of
defending the catholic faith, easily adopted these political principles;
and notwithstanding the limited prerogative, which he possessed in
the Netherlands, he published the most arbitrary, severe, and tyrannical
edicts against the protestants, and he took care that the execution of them
should be no less violent and sanguinary. He was neither cruel nor
bigotted in his natural disposition; yet an historian, cele∣brated for
moderation and caution, has computed, that, in the several persecu∣tions,
promoted by that monarch, no less than an hundred thousand persons
perished by the hands of the executioner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grotii
Annal. lib. 1. Father Paul, another great authority, computes, in a
passag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> above
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that 50,000 persons were put
to death in the Low Countries alone.</NOTE>. But these severe remedies,
so far from answering the purpose intended, had rather served to
augment the numbers as well as zeal of the reformers; and the magistrates of
the several towns, seeing no end of those barbarous executions, felt
their humanity rebel against their principles, and declined any farther
persecution of the new doc∣trines.</P>
<P>WHEN Philip succeeded to his father's dominions, the Flemings
were justly alarmed with new apprehensions; lest their prince,
observing the lenity of the magistrates, should take the execution of the
edicts from such remiss hands, and establish the inquisition in the
Low Countries, accompanied with all the ini∣quities and barbarities which
attended it in Spain. The severe and unrelenting character of the man, his
professed attachment to Spanish manners, the inflexible bigotry of his
principles; all these circumstances encreased their terror: And when he
left the Netherlands, with a known intention never to return, the dis∣gust
of the inhabitants was extremely augmented, and their dread of those
tyran∣nical orders, which their sovereign, surrounded with Spanish
ministers, would issue from his cabinet of Madrid. He left the dutchess
of Parma governess of the Low Countries; and the natural good sense and
good temper of that princess, had she been entrusted with the sole
power, would have preserved the submission of those opulent
provinces, which were lost from that refinement of treacherous and barbarous
politics, on which Philip so highly valued himself. The Flemings
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound, that the name alone of
regent remained with the dutchess; that cardinal Granville possessed
entirely the King's confidence; that attempts were every day made on their
liberties; that a resolution was taken never more to assemble the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates; that new bishoprics were
arbitrarily elected, in order to enforce the exe∣cution of the persecuting
edicts; and that on the whole, they must make ac¦count of being reduced to
the condition of a province under the Spanish mo∣narchy. The discontents of
the nobility gave countenance to the complaints of the <PB N="534" REF="137"/>
gentry, which encouraged the mutiny of the populace; and all orders of men
showed a strong disposition to revolt. Associations were formed,
tumultuary petitions presented, names of distinction assumed, badges of
party displayed; and the current of the people, irritated by feeble
resistance, and impelled by re∣ligious zeal, rose to such a height,
that in several towns, particularly in Antwerp, they made an open invasion
on the established worship, pillaged the churches and monasteries,
broke the images, and committed the most unwarrantable dis∣orders.</P>
<P>THE wiser part of the nobility, particularly the prince of
Orange, and the counts Egmont and Horn, were alarmed with these excesses,
to which their dis∣contents had at first given countenance; and seconding
the wisdom of the go∣verness, they suppressed those dangerous
insurrections, punished the ringleaders, and reduced all the provinces to a
state of order and submission. But Philip was not contented with the
re-establishment of his antient authority: He con∣sidered, that
provinces, so remote from the seat of government, could not be ruled by a
limited prerogative; and that a prince, who must entreat rather than command,
would necessarily, when he resided not among the people, feel every day a
diminution of his power and influence. He was determined, therefore, to lay
hold of the late popular mutinies as a pretence for abolishing entirely the
privileges of the Low Country provinces; and for ruling them thenceforth with a
military and arbitrary authority. In the execution of this violent design, he
employed a man, who was a proper instrument in the hands of such a tyrant.
Ferdinand of Toledo, duke of Alva, had been educated entirely amidst arms;
and having attained a consummate knowlege in the military art, his habits led
him to transfer into all government the severe discipline of a camp, and to
con∣ceive no measures between prince and subject but those of rigid
command and implicit obedience. This general, in 1568, conducted from Italy to
the Low Countries a powerful body of veteran Spaniards; and his avowed
animosity to the Flemings, with his known character, struck that whole
people with terror and consternation. It belongs not to our subject to
relate at length those vi∣olences, which Alva's natural barbarity, steeled
by reflection, and aggravated by insolence, exercised on those
flourishing provinces. It suffices to say, that all their privileges, the
gift of so many princes and the inheritance of so many ages, were openly
and expressly abolished by edict; arbitrary and sanguinary tribunals
erected; the counts Fgmont and Horn, notwithstanding their great merits and
past services, brought to the scaffold; multitudes of all ranks thrown
into pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on; and thence delivered
over to the executioner: And notwithstanding the peaceable 
<PB N="535" REF="138"/> submission of all men, nothing was heard of but
confiscation, imprisonment, exile, torture, and death.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was equally displeased to see the progress of
that scheme, laid for the extermination of the protestants, and to
observe the erection of so great a military power, in a state situated
so near her. She gave protection to all the Fle∣mish exiles who took
shelter in her dominions; and as many of these were the most
industrious inhabitants of the Netherlands, and had rendered that country
so celebrated for its arts, she reaped the advantage of introducing into
England some useful manufactures, which were formerly unknown in that
kingdom. Foreseeing that the violent government of Alva could not long
subsist without exciting some commotion, she ventured to commit an
insult upon him, which she would have been cautious not to hazard against
a more established authority. Some Genoese merchants had engaged by
contract with Philip, to transport into Flanders the sum of four hundred
thousand crowns; and the vessels in which this money was embarked, had
been attacked in the Channel by some privateers equip∣ed by the French
Hugonots, and had taken shelter in Plymouth and Southamp∣ton. The commanders
of the ships pretended, that the money belonged to the King of Spain; but the
Queen finding, upon enquiry, that it was the property of Genoese merchants,
took possession of it as a loan; and by that means de∣prived the duke
of Alva of this resource in the time of his greatest necessity. Alva,
in revenge, seized all the English merchants in the Low Countries, threw
them into prison, and confiscated their effects. The Queen retaliated by a
like violence on the Flemish and Spanish merchants; and gave all the
English liberty to make reprizals on the subjects of Philip. These
differences were afterwards accommodated by treaty, and mutual reparations were
made to the merchants: But nothing could repair the loss which so
well-timed a blow inflicted on the Spa∣nish government in the Low Countries.
Alva, in want of money, and dreading the immediate mutiny of his troops, to
whom large arrears were due, imposed by his arbitrary will the most ruinous
taxes on the people. He not only required the hundredth penny, and the
twentieth of all immoveable goods: He also de∣manded the tenth of all
moveable goods on every sale; an absurd tyranny, which would not only have
destroyed all arts and commerce, but even have restrained the common
intercourse of life. The people refused compliance: The duke had recourse
to his usual expedient of hanging: And thus matters came still nearer the
last extremity between the Flemings and the Spaniards<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, part I. lib. V. Camden, p.

<P>ALL the enemies of Elizabeth, in order to revenge themselves
for her insul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, had naturally
recourse to one expedient, the supporting the cause and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tensions <PB N="536" REF="139"/> of
the Queen of Scots; and Alva, whose measures were ever violent, soon
open∣ed a secret intercourse with that princess. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">New conspi∣racy of the duke of
Nor∣folk.</NOTE> There was one Radolphi, a Floren∣tine merchant, who had
resided about fifteen years at London, and who, at the same time that he
conducted his commerce in England, had managed all the in∣trigues of the court
of Rome with the catholic nobility and gentry<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 123. State Trials, vol. I. p. 87.</NOTE>. He had been
thrown into prison at the time when the duke of Norfolk's intrigues with Mary
were discovered; but either no proof was found against him, or the part
which he had acted was not very criminal; and he soon after recovered his
liber∣ty. This man, zealous for promoting the catholic faith, had formed a
scheme, in concert with the Spanish ambassador, for subverting the
government, by a fo∣reign invasion, and a domestic insurrection; and when
he communicated his pro∣ject, by letter, to Mary, he found, that as she was
now fully convinced of Eli∣zabeth's artifices, and despaired of ever
recovering her authority, or even her li∣berty, by pacific measures, she
very willingly gave her concurrence. The great number of discontented
catholics were the chief source of their hopes on the side of England; and
they also observed, that the kingdom was, at that time, full of indigent
gentry, chiefly younger brothers, who having at present, by the late decay of
the church, and the yet languishing state of commerce, no prospect of a
livelihood suitable to their birth, were ready to throw themselves into any
des∣perate enterprize<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p.
123.</NOTE>. But in order to inspire spirit and courage into all these
male∣contents, it was requisite, that some great nobleman should put
himself at their head; and no one appeared to Rodolphi, and to the bishop
of Ross, who en∣tered into all these intrigues, so proper, both on
account of his power and his po∣pularity, as the duke of Norfolk.</P>
<P>THIS nobleman, when released from confinement in the Tower,
had given his promise, that he would drop all intercourse with the Queen of
Scots<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 571.</NOTE>; but find∣ing that he had
lost, and, as he feared, beyond all recovery, the confidence and favour of
Elizabeth, and being still, in some degree, restrained from his li∣berty,
he was tempted, by impatience and despair, to violate his word, and to open
anew his correspondence with the captive princess<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 102.</NOTE>. A promise of mar∣riage was
renewed between them; the duke engaged to enter into all her interests; and
as his remorses gradually decayed in the course of these transactions,
he was pushed to give his assent to enterprizes still more criminal.
Rodolphi's plan was, that the duke of Alva should, under some other
pretence, assemble a great quan∣tity of shipping in the Low Countries;
should transport a body of six thousand foot, and four thousand
horse, into England; should land them at Harwich, <PB N="537" REF="140"/>
where the duke of Norfolk was to join them with all his friends; should
thence march directly to London, and oblige the Queen to submit to whatever
conditions the conspirators should please to impose upon her<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 155. State Trials, vol. I. p. 86,
87.</NOTE>. Norfolk gave his consent to this plan; and three letters, in
consequence of it, were wrote in his name by Rodolphi to Alva, the pope, and
the King of Spain; but the duke, apprehensive of the dan∣ger, refused to
sign them<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 159, 161. Camden, p.
432.</NOTE>. He only sent to the Spanish ambassador a servant and
confident, named Barker, as well to notify his concurrence in the plan, as to
vouch the authenticity of these letters; and Rodolphi, having obtained a
letter of credence from the ambassador, proceeded on his journey to
Brussels and to Rome. The duke of Alva and the pope embraced the scheme
with alacrity: Rodolphi informed Norfolk of their intentions<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 93.</NOTE>: and every thing seemed to
concur in forwarding the undertaking.</P>
<P>NORFOLK, notwithstanding these criminal enterprizes, had
never entirely for∣got his duty to his sovereign, his country, and his
religion; and tho' he had laid the plan both for an invasion and an
insurrection, he still flattered himself, that the innocence of his
intentions would justify the violence of his measures, and that, as he
aimed at nothing but the liberty of the Queen of Scots, and the obtaining
Elizabeth's consent to his marriage, he could not justly reproach himself
as a rebel and a traitor<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>. It is certain, however,
that, considering the Queen's vi∣gour and spirit, the scheme, if
successful, must finally have ended in her dethrone∣ment; and her
authority was here exposed to the utmost danger. The conspi∣racy had
hitherto entirely escaped the vigilance of Elizabeth, and that of
secre∣tary Cecil, who now bore the title of lord Burleigh. It was from
another attempt of Norfolk, that they first obtained a hint, which, being
diligently traced, led at last to a full discovery. Mary had intended to
send a sum of money to lord Herreis, and her partizans in Scotland; and
Norfolk undertook to have it con∣veyed to Bannister, a servant of his, at
that time in the north, who was to find some expedient to have it delivered
to lord Herreis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 169. State Trials, vol. I. p.
87. Camden, p. 434. Digges, p. 134, 137, 140. Strype, vol. II. p. 82.</NOTE>.
He entrusted the money to a servant, who was not in the secret, and told
him that the bag contained a sum of silver, which he was to deliver to
Bannister with a letter: But the ser∣vant, conjecturing from the weight and
size of the bag, that it was full of gold, carried the letter to Burleigh;
who immediately ordered Bannister, Barker, and Hicford, the duke's
secretary, to be put under arrest, and to undergoe a severe examination.
The fear of torture made them confess the whole truth; and as Hicford, tho'
ordered to burn all papers, had carefully kept them concealed un∣der 
<PB N="538" REF="141"/> the mats of the duke's chamber, and under the tiles of
the house, full evi∣dence now appeared against his master<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 173</NOTE>. Norfolk himself, who was
entirely ignorant of the discoveries made by his servants, was brought
before the council, and tho' exhorted to attone for his guilt by a full
confession, he persisted in deny∣ing every accusation with which he
was charged. The Queen always declared, that if he had given her this proof of
his sincere repentance, she would have pardoned all his former
offences<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>; but finding him
obstinate, she committed him to the Tower, and ordered him to be brought to
his trial. The bishop of Ross had, on some suspicion, been committed
to custody before the discovery of Norfolk's guilt; and every expedient was
employed to make him reveal his share in the conspiracy. He at first
insisted on his privilege as an ambassador; but he was told, that as
his mistress was no longer a sovereign, he would not be regarded as an
ambassador, and that even if that character was allowed, it did not warrant
him in conspiring against the sovereign in whose court he
resided<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 189. Spotswood.</NOTE>. As
he still refused to answer interrogatories, he was informed of the
confession made by Norfolk's servants; after which he entertained no
longer any scruple to make a full disco∣very, and his evidence put the
guilt of that nobleman beyond all question. <MILESTONE N="1572" UNIT="year"/>

was not at that time observed in trials for high treason.</P>
<P>THE Queen still hesitated concerning Norfolk's execution;

a peer of that rank and merit, or, that affecting the praise of clemency,
she only put on the appearance of these sentiments.

of a like nature, we <PB N="539" REF="142"/> shall mention, that the earl of
Northumberland, being delivered up to the Queen by the regent of Scotland, was
also a few months after brought to the scaffold for his rebellion.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots was either the occasion or the cause of
all these disturbances but as she was a sovereign princess, and might
reasonably, from the harsh treat∣ment which she had met with, think
herself entitled to use any expedient for her relief, Elizabeth durst
not, as yet, form any resolution of proceeding to extre∣mity against her.
She only sent lord Delawar, Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Thomas Bromley, and Dr.
Wilson, to expostulate with her, and to require satisfaction for all
those parts of her conduct, which, from the beginning of her life, had given
exception to Elizabeth: Her assuming the arms of England, refusing to
ratify the treaty of Edinburgh, her intending to marry Norfolk without the
Queen's consent, her concurring in the northern rebellion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 16, 107. Strype, vol. II. p. 51, 52.</NOTE>,
practising with Ro∣dolphi to engage the King of Spain in an invasion of
England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 194, 208, 209. Strype, vol. II.
p. 40, 51.</NOTE>, procuring the pope's bull of excommunication, and allowing
her friends abroad to give her the title of Queen of England. Mary justified
herself from the several articles of this charge, either by denying the
facts imputed to her, or by casting the blame on others<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 442.</NOTE>. But the Queen was little satisfied with
her apology; and the Par∣liament was so enraged against her, that the
commons made a direct application for her immediate trial and execution. They
employed some topics derived from practice and reason, and the laws of
nations; but the chief stress was laid on passages and examples from
the Old Testament<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 207, 208,
&amp;c.</NOTE>, which, if considered as a ge∣neral rule of conduct, (an
intention which it is unreasonable to suppose) would imply consequences
dangerous to all the principles of humanity and morality. Matters were here
carried to greater extremity than Elizabeth intended; and being satisfied
with shewing Mary the disposition of the nation, she sent to the
house her express commands not to deal any farther at present in the
affair of the Scot∣tish Queen<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 219,
241.</NOTE>. Nothing could be a stronger proof that the puritanical
interest prevailed in the house, than the intemperate use of authorities
derived from scrip∣ture, especially from the Old Testament; and the Queen
was so little a lover of that sect, that she was not likely to make any
concession merely in deference to their sollicitation. She shewed this
session her disapprobation of their schemes in another remarkable
instance. There had passed in the lower house two bills, for regulating
ecclesiastical ceremonies; but she sent them a like imperious
message <PB N="540" REF="143"/> with the foregoing, and by the terror of her
prerogative stopt all farther pro∣ceedings<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 213, 238.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Elizabeth would not proceed to such extremities
against Mary, as were recommended to her by the Parliament, she was alarmed
with the great interest and the restless spirit of that princess, as
well as her close connections with Spain; and she thought it necessary
both to increase the rigour and strictness of her con∣finement, and to
follow maxims different from what she had hitherto pursued in her
management of Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 152.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> That kingdom remained
still in a state of anar∣chy. The castle of Edinburgh, commanded by
Kirkaldy of Grange, had de∣clared for the Queen; and the lords of that party,
encouraged by his countenance, had taken possession of the capital, and
carried on a vigorous war against the regent. By a sudden and unexpected
inroad, they seized that nobleman at Stir∣ling; but finding that his friends,
sallying from the castle, were likely to relieve him, they instantly put
him to death. The earl of Marre was chosen regent in his place; and found the
same difficulties to encounter in the government of that divided country. He
was therefore glad to accept of the mediation of the French and English
ambassadors, and to conclude on equal terms a truce with the Queen's
party<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 263.</NOTE>. He was a man
of a free and generous spirit, and scorned to submit to any dependance on
England; and for this reason Elizabeth, who had formed close connections
with France, yielded with less reluctance to the sollicita∣tions of that
court, still maintained the appearance of neutrality between the par∣ties,
and allowed matters to remain on a ballance in Scotland<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 156, 165, 169.</NOTE>. But affairs soon
after took a new turn, Marre died of melancholy, with which the distracted
state of the country affected him: Morton was chosen regent; and as this
nobleman had secretly taken all his measures with Elizabeth, who no longer
relied on the friendship of the French court, she resolved to exert
herself more effectually for the support of that party, whom she had
always favoured. She sent Sir Henry Killigrew ambassador into Scotland,
who found Mary's partizans so discouraged by the discovery and
punishment of Norfolk's conspiracy, that they were glad to submit to the
King's authority, and accept of an indemnity for all past of∣fences<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 268.</NOTE>. The duke of Chatelrault,
and the earl of Huntley, with the most con∣siderable of Mary's friends,
laid down their arms on these conditions. The gar∣rison alone of the
castle of Edinburgh continued refractory. Kirkaldy's fortunes were
desperate; and he flattered himself with assistance from the Kings of
France and Spain, who encouraged his obstinacy, in hopes of being able, from
that quarter, to give disturbance to England. Elizabeth was alarmed with the
dan∣ger; <PB N="541" REF="144"/> she no more apprehended the coming to
extremity with the Queen of Scots, who, she found, could not any longer be
amused by her artifices; she had an entire reliance on Morton; and she
saw, that, by the submission of all the consi∣derable nobility, the
pacification of Scotland would be an easy, as well as a most important
undertaking. She, therefore, ordered Sir William Drury, governor of Berwic, to
march with some troops and artillery to Edinburgh, and to besiege the
castle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 449.</NOTE>. The garrison
submitted at discretion; Kirkaldy was delivered to his countrymen, by whom
he was tried and executed: Secretary Lidington, who had taken part with him,
died soon after a voluntary death, as is supposed; and Scotland,
submitting entirely to the regent, gave not, during a long time, any farther
inquietude to Elizabeth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French affairs.</NOTE> THE events which
happened in France, were not so agreeable to the Queen's interests and
inclinations. The fallacious pacifications which had been so often made with
the Hugonots, gave them good reason to suspect the present intentions
of the court; and after all the other leaders of that party were deceived into
a dangerous credulity, the sagacious admiral still remained doubtful and
uncertain. But his suspicions were at last overcome, partly by the
profound dissimulation of Charles, partly by his own earnest desire to
end the miseries of France, and return again to the performance of his duty
towards his prince and country. He considered besides, that as the former
violent conduct of the court had ever met with such fatal success, it was
not unlikely, that a prince, who had newly come to years of discretion, and
was not rivetted in any dangerous animosities or prejudices, would be induced
to govern himself by more moderate maxims. And as Charles was young, was of a
passionate hasty temper, and addicted to pleasure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 8, 39.</NOTE>, such deep perfidy seemed either
remote from his character, or difficult, and almost impos∣sible to be
so uniformly supported by him. Moved by these considerations, the
admiral, the Queen of Navarre, and all the Hugonots began to repose
them∣selves in full security, and gave credit to the treacherous
caresses and professions of the French court. Elizabeth herself,
notwithstanding her great experience and penetration, entertained not the
least mistrust of Charles's sincerity; and being pleased to find her
enemies of the house of Guise removed from all authority, and to observe
an animosity every day growing between the French and Spanish monarchs, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th April.</NOTE> she concluded a
defensive league with the former<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
443.</NOTE>, and regarded this alliance as an invincible barrier to her throne.
Walsingham, her ambassador, sent her over, by every courier, the most
satisfying accounts of the honour, and plain-dealing, and fidelity of that
perfidious prince.</P>
<P><PB N="542" REF="145"/> THE better to blind the eyes of the
jealous Hugonots, and draw their leaders into the snare prepared for them,
Charles offered his sister, Margaret, in mar∣riage to the prince of
Navarre; and the admiral, with all the considerable nobi∣lity of that party,
had come to Paris, in order to assist at the celebration of these
nuptials, which, it was hoped, would finally, if not compose the differences,
at least appease the bloody animosity of the two religions. The Queen of
Navarre was poisoned by orders from the court; the admiral was dangerously
wounded by an assassin: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 August.</NOTE> Yet Charles, by redoubling
his dissimulation, was still able to retain the Hugonots in their
security: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Massacre of Paris.</NOTE> Till on the
evening of St. Bartholomew, the day of the marriage, the signal was given for
a general massacre of these religionists, and the King himself in
person led the way to these assassinations. The hatred long
entertained by the Parisians against the protestants, made them second,
with∣out any preparation, the fury of the court; and all conditions, ages and
sexes, suspected of any propensity to that religion, were involved in
an undistinguished ruin. The admiral, his son-in-law Teligni, Soubize,
Rochefoucaut, Pardail∣lon, Piles, Lavardin; men, who, during the late wars, had
distinguished them∣selves by the most heroic actions, were miserably
butchered without resistance; the streets of Paris flowed with blood; and
the populace, more enraged than sa∣tiated with their cruelty, as if repining
that death had saved the victims from far∣ther insult, exercised on their
dead bodies all the rage of the most licentious bru∣tality. About five
hundred gentlemen and men of rank perished in this massa∣cre; and near
ten thousand of inferior condition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib.
V.</NOTE>. Orders were suddenly dis∣patched to all the provinces for a like
general execution of the protestants; and in Roüen, Lyons, and many
other cities, the people emulated the fury of the ca∣pital. Even the murder of
the King of Navarre, and the prince of Condé, had been proposed by the
duke of Guise; but Charles, softened by the amiable man∣ners of the King of
Navarre, and hoping that these young princes might easily be converted to
the catholic faith, was determined to spare their lives, tho' he ob∣liged
them to purchase their safety by a seeming change of their religion.</P>
<P>CHARLES, in order to cover this barbarous perfidy, pretended,
that a conspi∣racy of the Hugonots to seize his person had been
suddenly discovered; and that he had been necessitated, for his own
defence, to proceed to this severity against them. He sent orders to
Fenelon, his ambassador in England, to ask an audi∣ence, and to give
Elizabeth this account of the late transaction. That mini∣ster, who was a
man of probity, abhorred the treachery and cruelty of his court, and even
scrupled not to declare, that he was now ashamed to bear the name of a
Frenchman<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 247.</NOTE>; yet was he
obliged to obey his orders, and make use of the apo∣logy, 
<PB N="543" REF="146"/> which had been prescribed to him. He met with that
reception from all the courtiers, which, he knew, the conduct of his master
had so well merited. Nothing could be more awful and affecting than the
solemnity of his audience. A melancholy sorrow sat on every face:
Silence, as in the dead of night, reigned thro' all the chambers of the royal
apartment: The courtiers and ladies, clad in deep mourning, were ranged on each
side, and allowed him to pass, without affording him one salute or
favourable look; till he was admitted to the Queen herself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carte, vol. III. p. 522. from Fenelon's Dispatches.</NOTE>. That
princess received him with a more easy, if not a more gracious countenance;
and heard his apology, without discovering any visible symptoms of
indignation. She told him, that, tho', on the first rumour of this dreadful
intelligence, she had been astonished, that so many brave men and loyal
subjects, who rested secure on the faith of their sovereign, should
have been suddenly butchered in so barbarous a manner; she had hitherto
suspended her judgment, till farther and more certain information should
be brought her: That the account, which he had given, even if founded on no
mistake or bad information; tho' it might alleviate, would by no means remove
the blame of the King's counsellors, or justify the strange irregularity
of their proceedings: That the same force, which without resistance had
massacred so many defenceless men, could easily have secured their
persons, and have reserved them for a trial, and for punishment by a
formal sentence, which would have distinguished the innocent from the
guilty: That the admiral in particular, being dangerously wounded, and
environed by the guards of the King, on whose protection he seemed entirely
to rely, had no means of escape, and might surely, before his death, have
been convicted of the crimes imputed to him: That it was more worthy of a
sovereign to re∣serve in his own hands the sword of justice, than to
commit it to bloody mur∣derers, who, being the declared and mortal enemies of
the persons accused, em∣ployed it without mercy and without distinction:
That if these sentiments were just, even supposing the conspiracy
of the protestants to be real; how much more, if that crime was nothing but a
calumny of their enemies, invented for their ruin and destruction? That if
upon enquiry the innocence of these unhappy victims should afterwards
appear, it was the King's duty to turn his vengeance on their enemies and
calumniators, who had thus cruelly abused his confidence, had murdered so
many of his brave subjects, and bad done what in them lay to cover him with
infamy and dishonour: And that for her part, she should form her judgment
of his intentions by his subsequent conduct; and in the mean time 
<PB N="544" REF="147"/> should act as desired by the ambassador, and
rather pity than blame his master for the extremities, to which he had been
carried<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 247, 248.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was fully sensible of the dangerous situation in
which she now stood. In the massacre of Paris, she saw the result
of that general conspiracy, which had been formed, for the extermination of
the protestants; and she knew, that she herself, as the head and
protector of that religion, was exposed to the utmost fury and resentment
of the catholics. The violences and cruelties of the Spaniards in the Low
Countries were another branch of the same conspiracy; and as Charles and
Philip, two princes nearly allied in perfidy and barbarity, as well as in
bigotry, had now laid aside their pretended quarrel, and had avowed the
most entire friendship<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 268, 282.</NOTE>,
she had reason, so soon as they had appeased their domestic
commotions, to dread the effects of their united councils. The duke of Guise
also and his family, whom Charles, in order to deceive the admiral, had
hitherto kept at a distance, had now acquired an open and entire ascendant
in the court of France; and she was sensible, that these princes, from
personal as well as political reasons, were her declared and implacable
enemies. The Queen of Scots, their near relation and close confederate, was
the pretender to her throne; and tho' detained in custody, was actuated by a
restless spirit, and besides her foreign allies, possessed very
numerous and zealous partizans in the heart of the kingdom. For these
reasons, Elizabeth thought it more prudent not to break all terms with the
French monarch; but still to listen to the pro∣fessions of
friendship, which he made her. She allowed even the negotiati∣ons to be
renewed for her marriage with the duke of Alancon, Charles's third brother<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. passim. Camden, p. 447.</NOTE>: Those
with the duke of Anjou had already been broke off. She sent the earl of
Worcester to assist in her name at the baptism of a young princess,
born to Charles; but before she agreed to give this last mark of
condescension, she thought it becoming her dignity, to renew her
expressions of blame and even of detestation against the cruelties
exercised on his protestant subjects<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 297, 298. Camden, p. 447.</NOTE>. Mean∣while, she
prepared herself for that attack, which seemed to threaten her from the
combined power and violence of the Romanists: She fortified Portsmouth, put
her fleet in order, exercised her militia, cultivated popularity with her
sub∣jects, acted with vigour for the farther reduction of Scotland under
obedience to the young King, and renewed her alliance with the German princes,
who were no less alarmed than herself at these treacherous and
sanguinary measures, so uni∣versally embraced by the catholics.</P>
<P><PB N="545" REF="148"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">French affairs.</NOTE> BUT tho' Elizabeth
cautiously avoided the coming to extremities with Charles, the greatest
security, which she possessed against his violence, was derived
from the difficulties, which the obstinate resistance of the hugonots
still created to him.<MILESTONE N="1573" UNIT="year"/> Such of that sect as
lived near the frontiers, immediately, on the first news of the
massacres, fled into England, Germany or Switzerland, where they excited
the compassion and indignation of the protestants, and prepared
themselves, with encreased forces and redoubled zeal, to return into
France, and revenge the treacherous slaughter of their brethren. Those who
lived in the middle of the kingdom, took shelter in the nearest garrisons
occupied by the hugonots; and find∣ing, that they could repose no faith in
capitulations, and expect no clemency, were determined to defend themselves
to the last extremity. The sect, which Charles had thought at one blow to
exterminate, had now an army of eighteen thousand men on foot, and
possessed in different parts of the kingdom above an hundred cities,
castles, or fortresses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 313.</NOTE>;
nor could that prince deem himself se∣cure from the invasion threatened
him by all the other protestants of Europe. The nobility and gentry of
England were rouzed to such a pitch of resentment, that they offered to
levy an army of twenty-two thousand foot and four thousand horse, to
transport them into France, and to maintain them six months at their own
charge: But Elizabeth, who was cautious in her measures, and who feared to
inflame the quarrel between the two religions by these dangerous croisades,
refused her consent, and moderated the zeal of her subjects<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p 335,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>41</NOTE>. The German princes,
less political, or more secure from the resentment of France, forwarded
the levies made by the protestants; and the prince of Condé, having
escaped from court, put himself at the head of these troops, and prepared
to enter the kingdom. The duke of Alençon, the King of Navarre, the
family of Montmorenci, and many considerable men even among the catholics,
displeased, either on a private or public account, with the measures of
the court, favoured the progress of the hugonots; and every thing relapsed
into confusion. <MILESTONE N="1574" UNIT="year"/> The King, instead of
re∣penting his violent councils, which had brought matters to such extremity,
called aloud for new severities<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Davila. lib
5</NOTE>; nor could even the mortal distemper, under which he laboured,
moderate the rage and animosity, by which he was actuated. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th May.</NOTE> He died without male
issue, at the age of twenty-five years; a prince, whose cha∣racter,
containing that unusual mixture of dissimulation and serocity, of quick
resentment and unrelenting vengeance, executed the greatest mischiefs,
and threatened still worse, both to his native country and to all Europe.
Henry, duke of Anjou, who had, some time before, been elected King of Poland,
no <PB N="546" REF="149"/> sooner heard of his brother's death, than he
hastened to take possession of the crown of France; and found the
kingdom, not only involved in the greatest present disorders, but
exposed to infirmities, for which it was extremely difficult to provide any
suitable remedy. <MILESTONE N="1575" UNIT="year"/> The people were divided
into two theological factions, furious from their zeal, and mutually enraged
from the injuries which they had committed or received; and as all faith had
been violated and mode∣ration banished, it seemed impracticable to frame
any terms of composition be∣tween them. Each party had devoted itself to
leaders, whose commands had more authority than the will of the sovereign;
and even the catholics, to whom the King was attached, were conducted entirely
by the councils of Guise and his family. The religious connexions had, on
both sides, superceded the civil; or rather (for men will always be guided
by present interest) two empires being secretly formed in the kingdom,
every individual was engaged by new views of interest to follow those
leaders, to whom, during the course of past convulsions, he had been
indebted for his honours and preferment. Henry, observing the low condition
of the crown, had laid a scheme of restoring his own authority, by acting
as umpire between the parties, by moderating their differences, and by reducing
both to a dependance upon himself. He possessed all the talents of
dissimulation requisite for the execution of this delicate plan; but
being deficient in vigour, application, and sound understanding, instead
of acquiring a superi∣ority over both factions, he lost the confidence of
both, and taught the parti∣zans of each to adhere more closely to their
particular leaders, whom they found more hearty, cordial, and sincere, in the
cause, which they pursued. <MILESTONE N="1576" UNIT="year"/> The hu∣gonots
were fortified by the accession of a German army under the prince of
Condé and prince Casimir; but much more, by the credit and personal
virtues of the King of Navarre, who, having fled from court, had placed
himself at the head of that formidable party. Henry, in prosecution of his
plan, entered into a composition with them; and being desirous of
preserving a balance between the facts, he granted them peace on the most
advantageous conditions. This was the fifth general peace made with the
hugonots; but tho' it was no more sincere on the part of the court than any
of the former, it gave the highest dis∣gust to the catholics; and
afforded the duke of Guise the desired pretence of declaiming against the
measures, and maxims, and conduct of the King. That artful and bold leader
took thence an occasion of reducing his party into a more formed and regular
body; and he laid the first foundations of the famous LEAGUE, which, without
any regard to the royal authority, aimed at the entire suppression of the
hugonots. Such was the unhappy condition of France, from the past
severities and violences of its princes, that toleration could no longer be
admitted; <PB N="547" REF="150"/> and a concession for liberty of
conscience, which would have probably appeased the reformers, excited the
most violent resentment and animosity in the catholics.
<MILESTONE N="1577" UNIT="year"/> Henry, in order to divert the force of the
league from himself, and even to clude its efforts against the hugonots,
declared himself the head of that seditious confederacy, and took the field
as leader of the Romanists. But his dilatory and feeble measures
discovered his reluctance to the undertaking; and after some
unsuccessful attempts, he concluded a new peace, which, tho' less
favorable than the former to the protestants, gave no contentment to the
catholics. <MILESTONE N="1578" UNIT="year"/> Mutual diffidence still
prevailed between the parties; the King's moderation was suspi∣cious to
both; each faction continued to fortify itself against that breach, which,
they foresaw, must speedily ensue; theological controversy daily
whetted the ani∣mosity of the sects; and every private injury became the
ground of a public quarrel. The King, hoping, by his artifice and subtlety,
to allure the nation into a love of pleasure and repose, was himself
caught in the snare; and sinking into dissoluteness and indolence,
wholly lost the esteem, and, in a great measure, the affections of the
nation. Instead of advancing such men of character and ability, as were
neuters between these dangerous factions, he gave all his confidence to young
agreeable favourites, who, unable to prop his falling authority, leaned
en∣tirely upon it, and encreased the general odium against his
administration. The public burthens, encreased by his profuse liberality,
and feeling more heavy on a disordered kingdom, became another ground of
complaint; and the uncontrouled animosity of parties, joined to the
multiplicity of taxes, rendered peace more calamitous than any open state of
foreign or even domestic hostility. <MILESTONE N="1579" UNIT="year"/> The
arti∣fices of the King were too refined to succeed, and too frequent to be
concealed; and the plain, direct, and avowed conduct of the duke of Guise on
the one side, and that of the King of Navarre on the other, drew by degrees
the generality of the nation to devote themselves without reserve to the
one or the other of those great leaders.</P>
<P>THE civil commotions of France were of too great importance to
be over∣looked by the other princes of Europe; and Elizabeth's foresight and
vigilance, tho' somewhat restrained by her frugality, led her to take
secretly some part in them. Besides employing on all occasions her good
offices in favour of the hu∣gonots, she had expended no inconsiderable
sums of money in levying that army of Germans, which the prince of
Condé and prince Casimir conducted into France<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 452.</NOTE>; and notwithstanding all her
negotiations with the court, and her professions of amity, she always
considered her own interests as connected with the prosperity of the
French protestants and the depression of the house of Guise. Philip,
on <PB N="548" REF="151"/> the other hand, had declared himself protector of
the league; had entered into the closest correspondence with Guise; and
had employed all his authority in sup∣porting the credit of that factious
leader. The sympathy of religion, which of itself begot a connexion of
interests, was one considerable inducement; but that mo∣narch had also in
view, the subduing his rebellious subjects in the Nether∣lands; who, as
they received great encouragement from the French protestants, would, he
hoped, finally despair of success, after the entire suppression of
their friends and confederates.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of the Low Countries.</NOTE> THE
same political views, which engaged Elizabeth to support the hu∣gonots,
would have led her to assist the distressed protestants in the
Low Countries; but the mighty power of Philip, the tranquillity of all his
other dominions, and the great force, which he maintained in these mutinous
provinces, kept her in awe, and obliged her, notwithstanding all temptations
and all provocations, to preserve some terms of amity with that monarch.
The Spanish ambassador remonstrated with her, that many of the
Flemish exiles, who infested the seas, and preyed on his master's
subjects, were received into the har∣bours of England, and were there
permitted to dispose of their prizes; and by these remonstrances the
Queen found herself under a necessity of denying them all entrance into
her dominions. But this measure proved in the issue extremely prejudicial
to the interests of Philip. These desperate exiles, finding no longer any
possibility of subsistance, were forced to attempt the most
perillous enter∣prizes; and they made an assault on the Brille, a seaport
town in Holland, where they met with success, and, after a short
resistance, became masters of the place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden,
p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>. The duke of Alva was
alarmed with the danger; and stopping those bloody executions, which he was
making on the defenceless Flemings, he hastened with his army to
extinguish the flame, which, falling on materials so well prepared for
combustion, seemed to menace a general conflagration. His fears soon
appeared to be well grounded. The people in the neighbourhood of the Brille,
enraged by that complication of cruelty, oppression, insolence,
usurpa∣tion, and persecution, under which they laboured, flew to arms; and
in a few days almost the whole provinces of Holland and Zealand had revolted
from the Spaniards, and had openly declared against the tyranny of Alva. This
event happened in the year 1572.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, prince of Orange, descended from a sovereign family
of great lustre and antiquity in Germany, inheriting the possessions
of a sovereign family in France, had fixed his residence in the Low
Countries; and on account of his <PB N="549" REF="152"/> noble birth and
immense riches, as well as of his personal virtues, was univer∣sally
regarded as the greatest subject, who lived in those provinces. He had
op∣posed by all regular and dutiful means the progress of the Spanish
usurpations; and when Alva conducted his army into the Netherlands, and
assumed the go∣vernment, this prince, well acquainted with the violent
character of the man, and the tyrannical spirit of the court of Madrid,
wisely fled from the danger which threatened him, and retired to his paternal
estate and dominions in Germany. He was cited to appear before Alva's
tribunal, was condemned in absence, was declared a rebel, and his ample
possessions in the Low Countries were confiscated. In revenge, he
levied an army of protestants in the empire, and made some at∣tempts to
restore the Flemings to liberty; but was still repulsed with loss by
the vigilance and military conduct of Alva, and by the great bravery as well as
discipline, of those veteran Spaniards who served under that general. The
revolt of Holland and Zealand, provinces which the Prince of Orange formerly
com∣manded, and where he was infinitely beloved, called him anew from his
retreat; and he added conduct, no less than spirit, to that obstinate
resistance, which was here made to the Spanish dominion. By uniting the
revolted towns into a league, he laid the foundation of that illustrious
commonwealth, the offspring of industry and liberty, whose arms and policy
have made long so signal a figure in every transaction of Europe. He
inflamed the inhabitants by every motive, which religion, resentment, or love
of freedom could inspire. Tho' the pre∣sent greatness of the Spanish
monarchy might deprive them of all courage, he still flattered them with the
concurrence of the other provinces, and with assist∣ance from the
neighbouring states; and he exhorted them, in defence of their re∣ligion,
their liberties, their lives, to endure the utmost extremities of war. From
this spirit proceeded the desperate defence of Harlem; a defence, which
nothing but the most consuming famine could overcome, and which the
Spaniards re∣venged by the execution of more than two thousand of the
inhabitants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, lib. 7.</NOTE>. This extreme
severity, instead of striking terror into the Hollanders, animated them
by despair; and the vigorous resistance made at Alcmaer, where Alva was
finally repulsed, showed them that their insolent enemies were not wholly
invincible. The duke, finding at last the pernicious effects of his violent
councils, sollicited to be recalled from the government: Medina-celi, who was
appointed his suc∣cessor, refused to accept the charge: Requesens,
commendator of Castile, was sent from Italy to replace Alva; and this
tyrant departed from the Netherlands in 1574; leaving his name in execration to
the inhabitants, and boasting in his <PB N="550" REF="153"/> turn, that,
during the course of five years government, he had delivered above eighteen
thousand of these rebellious heretics into the hands of the
executioner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grotius, lib. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>REQUESENS, tho' a man of milder dispositions, could not
appease the violent hatred, which the revolted Hollanders had entertained
against the Spanish govern∣ment; and the war continued as obstinate as
ever. In the siege of Leyden, un∣dertaken by the Spaniards, the Dutch opened
the dykes and sluices, in order to drive them from that enterprize; and the
very peasants were active in ruining their fields by an inundation, rather
than fall again under the hated tyranny of Spain. But notwithstanding this
repulse, the governor still pursued the war; and the contest seemed
too unequal between so mighty a monarchy, and two small provinces, however
fortified by nature, and however defended by the desperate resolution of
the inhabitants. The prince of Orange, therefore, in 1575, was resolved to
sue for foreign assistance, and to make applications to one or other of
his great neighbours, Henry or Elizabeth. The court of France was not exempt
from that spirit of tyranny and persecution which prevailed with the
Spaniards; and that kingdom, torne by domestic dissensions, seemed
not to en∣joy, at present, either leizure or ability to pay regard to foreign
interests. But England, long connected both by commerce and alliance with the
Netherlands, and now more concerned in the fate of the revolted provinces by a
sympathy in religion, seemed naturally interested in their defence; and
as Elizabeth had justly entertained great jealousy against Philip, and
governed her powerful and opulent kingdom in perfect tranquillity, great hopes
were entertained, that her policy, her ambition, or her generosity, would
engage her to support them under their present calamities. They sent,
therefore, a solemn embassy to London, con∣sisting of St. Aldegonde,
Douza, Nivelle, Buys, and Melsen; and after em∣ploying the most humble
supplications to the Queen, they proferred her the possession and
sovereignty of their provinces, if she would employ her power in their
defence.</P>
<P>THERE were many strong motives which might impel Elizabeth to
accept so liberal an offer. She was apprized of the injuries which Philip had
done her, by his intrigues with the malecontents in England and Ireland<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 73.</NOTE>: She was displeased to
see a violent and military government e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected in her neighbourhood: She foresaw the danger which she
should incur from a total prevalence of the catholics in the Low Countries:
And the maritime situation of those provinces, as well as their command
over the great rivers, was a very inviting circumstance to a nation like the
English, who were beginning to cultivate commerce and naval power. But 
<PB N="551" REF="154"/> this princess, tho' magnanimous, had never entertained
the ambition of making conquests, or gaining new acquisitions; and the
whole purpose of her vigilant and active politics, was to maintain, by the
most frugal and cautious expedients, the tranquillity of her own dominions.
An open war with the Spanish monarchy was the apparent consequence of her
accepting the dominion of these provinces; and after taking the inhabitants
under her protection, she could never afterwards in honour abandon them, but,
however desperate their defence might become, she must embrace it, even
farther than her convenience or interest would per∣mit. For these
reasons, she refused, in plain terms, the sovereignty profered her; but
told the ambassadors, that, in return for the good-will which the prince of
Orange and the States had shewn her, she would endeavour to mediate an
agreement for them, on the most reasonable conditions which could be
obtained<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 453, 454.</NOTE>. She sent
accordingly Sir Henry Cobham to Philip; and represented to him, the danger
which the whole Low Countries, as well as the revolted provinces, would incur,
if France could obtain the least interval from her intestine disorders,
and find leizure to offer her protection to that mutinous and discontented
people. Philip seemed to take this remonstrance in good part; but no accord
ensued, and the war continued with the same rage and violence as
before.</P>
<P>IT was an accident that delivered the Hollanders from their
present desperate situation. Requesens, the governor, dying suddenly,
the Spanish troops, dis∣contented for want of pay, and licentious for want
of a proper authority to com∣mand them, broke out into a furious mutiny; and
threw every thing into confu∣sion. They sacked and pillaged the cities of
Maestricht and Antwerp, and com∣mitted great slaughter on the inhabitants:
They threatned all the other cities with a like fate: And the whole provinces,
excepting Luxembourg, united for mu∣tual defence against their violence, and
called in the prince of Orange and the Hol∣landers, as their protectors. A
treaty, commonly called the Pacification of Ghent, was formed by common
agreement; where the removal of foreign troops, and the restoration of their
ancient liberties, were the objects which the provinces stipulated to
pursue. Don John of Austria, natural brother to Philip, being appointed
governor, found, on his arrival at Luxembourg, that the States had so
fortified themselves, and that the Spanish troops were so divided by
their situa∣tion, that there was no possibility of resistance; and he
agreed to the terms re∣quired of him. The Spaniards were recalled; and these
provinces seemed at last to breathe a little from their calamities.</P>
<P>BUT it was not easy for an entire peace to be settled, while
the thirst of re∣venge and dominion governed the King of Spain, and while the
Flemings were so <PB N="552" REF="155"/> strongly agitated with resentment
of past, and fear of future injuries. The am∣bition of Don John, who coveted
this great theatre for his military talents, en∣gaged him rather to enflame
than appease the quarrel; and as he found the States determined to impose
very strict limitations on his authority, he broke all arti∣cles, seized
Namur, and procured the recall of the Spanish army from Italy. This prince,
endowed with a lofty genius, and animated by the prosperous suc∣cesses
of his youth, had opened his mind to vast undertakings; and looking much
beyond the conquest of the revolted provinces, had projected to marry the
Queen of Scots, and to acquire in her right the dominion of the British
kingdoms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 466. Grotius, lib. iii.</NOTE>.
Elizabeth was aware of his intentions; and seeing now, from the union of all
the provinces, a fair prospect of making a long and vigorous defence
against Spain, she no longer scrupled to embrace the protection of their
liberties, which seemed to be so intimately connected with her own
safety. After sending them over a sum of money, about twenty thousand
pounds, for the immediate pay of their troops, she concluded a treaty with
them; in which she stipulated to assist them with five thousand
foot and a thousand horse, at the charge of the Flemings; and to lend them
a hundred thousand pounds, on receiving the bonds of some of the most
considerable towns of the Netherlands, for her re-payment within the year. It
was farther agreed, that the commander of the English army, should be
admitted into the council of the States; and nothing be deter∣mined concerning
war or peace, without previously informing the Queen or him of it; that they
should enter into no league without her consent; that if any discord
arose among themselves, it should be referred to her arbitration; and
that, if any prince, on any pretext, should attempt hostilities against
her, they should send to her assistance an army equal to that which
she employed in their defence. This alliance was signed on the 7th of
January, 1578<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 466▪</NOTE>. One
considerable in∣ducement to the Queen for entering into treaty with the
States, was to prevent their throwing themselves into the arms of France; and
she was desirous to make the King of Spain believe, that it was her sole
motive. She represented to him, by her ambassador, Thomas Wilkes, that
she had hitherto acted religiously the part of a good neighbour and ally;
had refused the sovereignty of Holland and Zealand, when profered her; had
counselled the prince of Orange to sub∣mit to the King; and had even
accompanied her advice with menaces, in case of his refusal. She
persevered, she said, in the same friendly intentions; and, as a proof
of it, would venture to interpose with her advice for the composure of the
present differences: Let Don John, whom she could not but regard as her
mortal enemy, be recalled; let some other prince more popular be
substi∣tuted in his place; let the Spanish armies be withdrawn; let the
Flemings <PB N="553" REF="156"/> be restored to their ancient liberties and
privileges: And if, after these concessi∣ons, they are still
obstinate not to return to their duty, she promised to join her arms to
those of the King of Spain, and force them to a compliance. Philip
dissembled his resentment against the Queen; and still continued to
supply Don John with money and troops. That prince, tho' once repulsed at
Rimenant, by the valour of the English under Norris, and tho' opposed, as
well by the army of the States as by prince Casimir, who had conducted to the
Low Countries a great body of Germans, paid by the Queen, gained a great
advantage over the Flemings at Cemblours; but was cut off in the midst of his
prosperity by poi∣son, given him secretly, as was suspected, by
orders from Philip, who dreaded his ambition. The prince of Parma succeeded
to the command, who uniting va∣lour and clemency, negociation and military
exploits, made great progress against the revolted Flemings, and advanced
the progress of the Spaniards by his arts as well as by his arms.</P>
<P>DURING these years, while Europe was almost every where in
great commo∣tion, England enjoyed a profound tranquillity; owing chiefly to the
prudence and vigour of the Queen's administration, and to the wise
precautions which she employed in all her measures. By supporting the
zealous protestants in Scotland, she had twice given them the superiority
over their antagonists, had connected their interests closely with her
own, and had procured herself entire security from that quarter, whence the
most dangerous invasions could be made upon her. She saw in France her
enemies, the Guises, tho' extremely powerful, yet coun∣terballanced by the
Hugonots, her zealous partizans; and even hated by the King, who was jealous of
their restless and exorbitant ambition. The bigotry of Philip gave her
just ground of anxiety; but the same bigotry had happily excited the most
obstinate opposition among his own subjects, and had created him enemies,
which his arms and policy were not likely soon to overcome. The Queen of
Scots, her antagonist and rival, and the pretender to her throne, was a
prisoner in her hands; and by her impatience and high spirit had been
engaged in practices which afforded the Queen a pretence for rendring her
confinement more rigorous, and for cutting off her communication with her
partizans in England. Re∣ligion was the capital point, on which depended all
the political transactions of that age; and the Queen's conduct in this
particular, making allowance for the prevail∣ing prejudices of the age, could
scarcely be accused of severity or imprudence. She established no
inquisition into men's bosoms; she imposed no oaths of supre∣macy,
except on those who received trust or emolument from the public: And tho'
the exercise of all religion but the established was prohibited, the
violation of this law, by the saying mass, and receiving the sacrament,
in private houses, <PB N="554" REF="157"/> was, in many instances, connived
at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 459.</NOTE>; while, at the same time,
the catholics, in the beginning of her reign, shewed little reluctance
against going to church, or frequenting the ordinary duties of public
worship. The pope, sensible that this practice would by degrees reconcile
all his partizans to the reformed religion, hastened the publication of the
bull, excommunicating the Queen, and freeing her subjects from all oaths of
allegiance; and great pains were taken by the emissaries of Rome, to render
the breach between the two religions as wide as possible, and to make the
frequenting protestant churches appear highly criminal to the catholics<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Walsingham's Letter in Burnet, vol. II. 418.
Cabbala, p. 406.</NOTE>. These practices, with the rebellions which ensued,
increased the vigilance and severity of the government; but the
Romanists, if their con∣dition was compared with that of the Nonconformists
in other countries, and with their own practices where they domineered, could
not justly complain much of violence or persecution. The Queen appeared
rather more anxious to keep a strict hand over the puritans; who, tho' their
pretensions were not so immediate∣ly dangerous to her authority, seemed
to be actuated by a more unreasonable ob∣stinacy, and to retain claims, of
which, both in civil and ecclesiastical matters, it was, as yet, difficult
to discern the full scope and intention. Some secret at∣tempts of that
sect to establish a separate congregation and discipline, had been
carefully repressed in the beginning of this reign<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Parker, p. 342. Ibid. Life of Grindal, p.
315.</NOTE>; and when any of the esta∣blished clergy discovered a
tendency to their principles, by omitting the legal ha∣bits or ceremonies, the
Queen had shewn a determined resolution to punish them by fines and
deprivations<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 165, 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</NOTE>; tho' her orders to that
purpose had, by the protec∣tion which these sectaries received from
some of the most considerable courtiers, been frequently eluded. But what
chiefly tended to gain Elizabeth the hearts of her subjects, was, her
frugality, which, tho' carried sometimes to an extreme, led her not to
amass treasures, but only to prevent impositions upon the people, who
were at that time very little accustomed to bear the burthens of government.
By means of her rigid oeconomy, she paid all the debts which she found on
the crown, with their full interest; tho' some of these debts had been
contracted even during the reign of her father<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 245. Camden, p. 446.</NOTE>. She repaid some loans,
which she had ex∣acted at the commencement of her reign; a practice in that
age somewhat unu∣sual<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 246.</NOTE>:
And she established her credit on such a footing, that no sovereign
in Europe could more readily command any sum which the public exigencies
might at any time require<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>45.</NOTE>. During this peaceable
and uniform government, Eng∣land <PB N="555" REF="158"/> furnishes few
materials for history; and except the small part which Eliza∣beth took in
foreign transactions, there scarce passed any occurrence which
re∣quires a particular detail.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THE most memorable
event in this period was a session of Parliament, sum∣moned on the 8th
of February, 1576, where debates were started, which may appear somewhat
curious and singular. Peter Wentworth, a puritan, who had signalized
himself former Parliaments, by his free and undaunted spirit, opened this
session with a premeditated harangue, which drew on him the indig∣nation
of the house, and gave great offence to the Queen and the courtiers. As it
seems to contain the first rude sketch of those principles of liberty
which hap∣pily gained afterwards the ascendant in England, it may not be
improper to give, in a few words, the substance of it. He premised, that
the very name of liberty is sweet; but the thing itself is precious beyond
the most inestimable treasure: And that it behoved them to be careful,
lest, contenting themselves with the sweetness of the name, they forego
the substance, and abandon what of all earth∣ly possessions was of
the highest value to the kingdom. He then proceeded to observe, that
freedom of speech in that house, a privilege so useful both to
sove∣reign and subject, had been formerly infringed in many essential
articles, and was, at present, exposed to the most imminent danger: That
it was usual, when any subject of importance was handled, especially if
it regarded religion, to surmize, that these topics were disagreeable to
the Queen, and that the farther proceeding in them would draw down her
indignation upon their temerity: That Solomon had justly affirmed, the King's
displeasure to be a messenger of death; and it was no wonder that men,
even tho' urged by motives of conscience and duty, should be inclined to
stop short, when they found themselves exposed to so severe a
penalty: That by employing this argument, the house was incapacitated from
serving their country, or even from serving the Queen herself; whose
ears, besieged by perni∣cious flatterers, were thereby rendered
inaccessible to the most salutary truths: That it was a mockery to call
an assembly a Parliament, and yet deny them that privilege, which was so
essential to their being, and without which they must de∣generate into an
abject school of servitude and dissimulation: That as the Parlia∣ment
was the great guardian of the laws, they ought to have liberty to discharge
their trust, and to maintain that authority whence even Kings themselves
derive their being: That a King was constituted such by law, and tho' he
was not dependant on man, yet was he subordinate to God and the law, and was
obliged to make their prescriptions, not his own will, the rule of his
conduct: That even his commission, as God's vicegerent, enforced, instead
of loosening, this obligation; since he was thereby invested with
authority to execute on earth the will of God, <PB N="556" REF="159"/> which is
nothing but law and justice: That tho' these surmizes of displeasing
the Queen by their proceedings, had impeached, in a very essential point,
all free∣dom of speech, a privilege granted them by a special law; yet was
there a more express and more dangerous invasion made on their liberties,
by frequent messages from the throne: That it had become a practice, when
the house were entering on any question, either ecclesiastical or
civil, to bring an order from the Queen, prohibiting them absolutely to treat
of such matters, and barring them all farther discussion of these
momentuous articles: That the prelates, emboldened by her royal protection, had
assumed a decisive power in all questions of religion, and required
that every one should implicitly submit his faith to their arbitrary
deter∣minations: That the love which he bore his sovereign, forbad him to be
silent under such abuses, or to sacrifice, on this important
occasion, his duty to servile flattery and complaisance: And that, as no
earthly creature was exempt from fault, so neither was the Queen herself;
but in imposing this servitude on her faithful commons, had committed a
great, and even dangerous, fault against herself and the whole realm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 236, 237, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is easy to observe, from this speech, that in these
first dawnings of liberty, the parliamentary stile was still crude and
unformed; and that the proper deco∣rum of attacking ministers and
counsellors, without interesting the honour of the crown, or mentioning the
person of the sovereign, was not as yet entirely esta∣blished. The
commons expressed great displeasure at this unusual licence: They
sequestered Wentworth from the house, and committed him prisoner to the
ser∣jeant at arms. They even ordered him to be examined by a committee,
consist∣ing of all those members who were also members of the
privy-council, and a re∣port to be made next day to the house. This committee
met in the Star-cham∣ber, and wearing the aspect of that arbitrary court,
summoned Wentworth to appear before them, and answer for his behaviour. But
tho' the commons had discovered so little delicacy or precaution, in thus
confounding their own autho∣rity with that of the Star-chamber; Wentworth
understood better the principles of liberty, and refused to give these
counsellors any account of his conduct in Parliament, till he was satisfied
that they acted not as members of the privy-coun∣cil, but as a committee of the
house<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 241.</NOTE>. He justified
himself by pleading the rigour and hardship of the Queen's messages;
and notwithstanding that the committee shewed him, by instances in other
reigns, that the practice of sending such messages was not
unprecedented, he would not agree to express any sorrow or repentance. The
issue of the affair was, that, after a month's confinement, the Queen
sent to the com∣mons, informing them, that, from her special grace and
favour, she had restored him <PB N="557" REF="160"/> to his liberty and to
his place in the house<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 244.</NOTE>.
By this seeming lenity, she indirectly retained the power which she had
assumed, of imprisoning the members, and oblig∣ing them to answer
before her for their conduct in Parliament. And Sir Walter Mildmay endeavoured
to make the house sensible of her Majesty's goodness, in so gently
remitting the indignation which she might justly conceive at the teme∣rity
of their member: But he informed them, that they had not the liberty of
speaking what and of whom they pleased; and that indiscreet freedoms
used in that house, had, both in the present and foregoing ages, met with
a proper pu∣nishment. He warned them, therefore, not to abuse farther the
Queen's cle∣mency; lest she be constrained, contrary to her inclination,
to turn an unsuccess∣ful lenity into a necessary severity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 259.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE behaviour of the two houses was, in other respects,
equally tame and submissive. Instead of a bill, which was at first
introduced<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 252.</NOTE>, for the
reforma∣tion of the church, they were contented to present a petition to her
majesty for that purpose: And when she told them, that she would give
orders to her bi∣shops, to amend all abuses, and if they were negligent,
she would herself, by her supreme power and authority over the church,
give such redress as would en∣tirely satisfy the nation; the Parliament
willingly acquiesced in this sovereign and peremptory decision<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 257.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' the commons shewed so little spirit in opposing the
authority of the crown, they maintained, this session, their dignity
against an incroachment of the lords, and would not agree to a conference
which, they thought, was desired of them in an irregular manner. They
acknowleged, however, with all humble∣ness, (such was their expression)
the superiority of the lords: They only refused to give that house any
reason for their proceedings; and asserted, that where they altered a
bill sent them by the peers, it belonged to them to desire a conference,
not to the upper house to require it<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
263.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE commons granted an aid of one subsidy and two
fifteenths. Mildmay, in order to satisfy the house concerning the
reasonableness of this grant, entered into a detail of the Queen's past
expences in supporting the government, and of the increasing charges of the
crown, from the daily increase in the price of all com∣modities. He did not,
however, forget to admonish them, that they were to re∣gard this detail as
the pure effect of the Queen's condescension, since she was not bound
to yield them any account how she employed her treasure<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 246.</NOTE>.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE greatest and most absolute security which Elizabeth
enjoyed during her whole reign, never exempted her from vigilance and
attention; but the scene began now to be more overcast, and danger
gradually multiplied on her from more than one quarter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> THE earl of Morton had
hitherto retained Scotland in strict alliance with the Queen, and had also
restored domestic tranquillity: But it was not likely, that the factitious
and legal authority of a regent would long maintain itself in a country
unacquainted with law and order; where even the natural dominion of hereditary
princes so often met with opposition and controul. The nobility be∣gan anew
to break into factions: The people were disgusted with some instances
which appeared of Morton's avarice: And the clergy, who complained of far∣ther
innovations on their narrow revenue, joined and increased the discontent of
the other orders. The regent was sensible of his dangerous situation; and
hav∣ing dropt some peevish expressions, as if he were willing or
desirous to resign the government, the noblemen of the opposite party,
favourites of the young King, laid hold of this concession, and required
that demission which he seemed so frankly to offer them. James was at
this time but eleven years of age; yet Mor∣ton, having secured himself, as
he imagined, by a general pardon, resigned his authority into the hands of
the King, who pretended to conduct, in his own name, the administration of
the kingdom. The regent retired from the govern∣ment, and seemed to employ
himself entirely in the care of his domestic affairs; but either tired with
this tranquillity, which appeared insipid after the agitations of ambition,
or thinking it time to throw off dissimulation, he returned again to court,
acquired an ascendant in the council; and tho' he resumed not the title of
regent, governed with the same authority as before. The opposite party,
after holding separate conventions, took to arms, under pretence of
delivering their <PB N="559" REF="162"/> <MILESTONE N="1580" UNIT="year"/>
prince from captivity, and restoring him to the free exercise of his
government: Queen Elizabeth interposed by her ambassador, Sir Robert
Bowes, and mediated an agreement between the factions: Morton kept
possession of the government; but his enemies were numerous and
vigilant, and his authority seemed to become every day more precarious.</P>
<P>THE count d'Aubigney, of the house of Lenox, cousin-german
to the King's father, had been born and educated in France; and being a young
nobleman of a good address, and a sweet disposition, he appeared to the
duke of Guise a very proper instrument for detaching James from the
English interest, and connect∣ing him with his mother and her relations. He
no sooner appeared at Stir∣ling, where James resided, than he acquired the
affections of the young monarch; and joining his interests with James Stuart
of the house of Ochiltree, a young man of profligate manners, who had
acquired the King's favour, he employed himself, under the appearance of play
and amusement, in instilling into the ten∣der mind of the prince, new
sentiments of politics and government. He repre∣sented to him the
injustice which had been done Mary in her deposition, and made him
entertain thoughts, either of resigning the crown into her hands, or of
asso∣ciating her with him in the administration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 412, 423. Melvil, p. 130.</NOTE>. Elizabeth, alarmed
with the dan∣ger which might ensue from the prevalence of this interest in
Scotland, sent anew Sir Robert Bowes to Stirling; and accusing Aubigney,
now created earl of Le∣nox, of an attachment to the French; warned James
against entertaining such suspicious and dangerous connections<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 309.</NOTE>. The King excused
himself, by Alexan∣der Hume his ambassador; and Lenox, finding that the
Queen had openly de∣clared against him, was farther confirmed in his
intention of overturning the English interest, and particularly of ruining
Morton, who was regarded as the head of it. That nobleman was arrested in
council, accused as an accomplice in the late King's murder, committed to
prison, brought to trial, and condemned to suffer as a traitor. He
confessed, that Bothwel had communicated to him the design, had pleaded
Mary's assent, and had desired his concurrence; but he de∣nied, that he
had ever given his approbation to that crime; and in excuse for his
concealment, alledged the danger of revealing it, either to Henry, who had no
resolution nor constancy, or to Mary, who appeared to be an accomplice in
the murder<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 31<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Crawford, p. 333. Moyse's Memoirs, p. 54.</NOTE>.
Sir Thomas Randolph was sent by the Queen to intercede in favour of Morton;
and that ambassador, not content with discharging this duty of his
function, engaged, by his persuasion, the earls of Argyle, Montrose,
Angus, <PB N="558" REF="163"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="559" REF="164"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="560" REF="165"/> Marre, and Glencarne, to enter into confederacy for
protecting, even by force of arms, the life of the prisoner. The more to
overawe that nobleman's enemies, Elizabeth ordered forces to be assembled
on the borders of England; but this expedient served only to hasten his
sentence and execution<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p.
312.</NOTE>. Morton died with that constancy and resolution which had
attended him thro' all the various events of his life; and left a reputation,
which was less disputed with regard to ability than probity and virtue. But
this conclusion of the scene happened not till the subsequent year.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spanish affairs.</NOTE> ELIZABETH was at
this time extremely anxious on account of every revolu∣tion in Scotland;
because that country alone, not being separated from England by sea, and
bordering on all the catholic and malecontent counties, afforded her enemies a
safe and easy method of attacking her; and because she was
sensible, that Mary, thinking herself abandoned by the French monarch,
had been en∣gaged by the Guises to have recourse to the powerful protection
of Philip, who, tho' he had not yet come to an open rupture with the Queen, was
every day, both by the injuries which he committed and received, more
exasperated against her. That he might retaliate for the assistance
which she gave to his rebels in the Low Countries, he had sent under the
name of the pope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 359, 370.</NOTE>, a body of
seven hundred Spaniards and Italians into Ireland; where the inhabitants,
always turbulent, and discontented with the English government, were now
more alienated by religious prejudices, and were ready to join every invader.
The Spanish general, San Josepho, built a fort in Kerry; and being there
besieged by the earl of Ormond, president of Munster, who was soon
after joined by lord Gray, the deputy, he made a very weak and cowardly
resistance. After some assaults, feebly sustained, he
surrendered at discretion; and Gray, who was attended with a very small
force, finding himself embarrassed with so many prisoners, put all
the Spaniards and Itali∣ans to the sword without mercy, and hanged about
fifteen hundred Irish: A cruelty which gave great displeasure to
Elizabeth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 475. Cox's History of
Ireland, p. 368.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Francis Drake.</NOTE> WHEN the English
ambassador made complaints of this invasion, he was an∣swered by like
complaints of the pyracies committed by Francis Drake, a bold seaman, who had
assaulted the Spaniards in the place where they esteemed them∣selves
the most secure, in the new world. This man, sprung from mean parents in
the county of Devon, having acquired considerable riches by some
depreda∣tions made on the Spaniards in the isthmus of Panama, and having
there got a sight of the Pacific ocean, was so stimulated by ambition and
avarice, that he scru∣pled <PB N="561" REF="166"/> not to employ his whole
fortune in a new adventure thro' those seas, so much unknown at that time
to all the European nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 478. Stow, p.

great favourite of the Queen, he obtained her consent and approbation; and
set sail from Plymouth in 1577, with four ships and a pinnace, on board
of which were 164 able sailors<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p 478.

into the South Sea by the Straits of Magellan, and falling on the Spaniards,
who ex∣pected no enemy in these quarters, he took many rich prizes, and
prepared to return with the immense booty, which he had acquired.
Apprehensive of being intercepted by the enemy, if he took the same way
homewards, by which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had reached
the Pacific Ocean, he attempted to find a passage by the north of
Cali∣fornia; and failing in that enterprize, he set sail for the East
Indies, and returned safely this year by the Cape of Good Hope. He was the
first Eng ishman who compassed the Globe; and the first commander in
chief: For Magellan, whose ship executed the same adventure, died in his
passage. His name became very celebrated on account of so bold and
fortunate an attempt; but many, appre∣hending the resentment of the
Spaniards, endeavoured to persuade the Queen, that it would be more prudent
to disown the enterprize, to punish Drake, and to restore the treasure.
But Elizabeth, who admired valour, and who was allured by the prospect of
sharing in the riches, was determined to countenance that gallant sailor:
She conferred on him the honour of knighthood, and accepted of a banquet from
him at Deptford, on board the ship which had atchieved so me∣morable a
voyage. When Philip's ambassador, Mendoza, exclaimed against Drake's
pyracies, she told him, that the Spaniards, by arrogating a right to the
whole new world, and excluding thence all other European nations, who should
sail thither, even with a view of exercising the most lawful commerce,
very na∣turally tempted others to make a violent irruption into these
countries<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 480.</NOTE>. To pacify,
however, the Spanish monarch, she caused part of the booty to be
re∣stored to Pedro Sebura, a Spaniard, who pretended to be agent for the
merchants, whom Drake had spoiled. <MILESTONE N="1581" UNIT="year"/> Having
learned afterwards, that Philip had seized the money, and had employed part
of it against herself in Ireland, part of it in the pay of the prince of
Parma's troops, she was determined to make no more restitutions.</P>
<P>THERE was another cause, which induced the Queen to take this
resolution: She was in such want of money, that she was obliged to
assemble a Parliament; a measure, which, as she herself openly
declared, she never embraced, ex∣cept <PB N="562" REF="167"/> when obliged by
the necessity of her affairs. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th January.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> The Parliament, besides
granting her a supply of one subsidy and two fifteens, enacted some
statutes for the security of the government, chiefly against the attempts
of the catholics. Whoever, in any way, reconciled any one to the church of
Rome, or was him∣self reconciled, was declared to be guilty of treason: To
say mass was subjected to the penalty of a year's imprisonment, and a
fine of two hundred merks; the hearing it was punishable by a year's
imprisonment and a fine of an hundred merks: A fine of twenty pounds a month
was imposed on every one who con∣tinued, during that time, absent from
church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">23 Eliz. cap. 1.</NOTE>. To utter slanderous
or seditious words against the Queen was punishable, for the first
offence, with the pillory and loss of ears; the second offence was declared
felony: The writing or printing such words was felony even on the first
offence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 2.</NOTE>. The puritans
prevailed to have farther application made for reformation in religion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 302.</NOTE>. Paul Wentworth, brother to
the member of that name, who had distinguished himself in the preced∣ing
session, moved, that the commons, from their own authority, should
appoint a general fast and prayers; and the commons rashly assented to
his motion. For this presumption, they were severely reprimanded by a
message from the Queen, as encroaching on the royal prerogative and
supremacy; and they were obliged to submit, and ask forgiveness<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 284, 285.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen and Parliament were engaged to pass these severe
laws against the catholics, by some late discoveries, which had been made
of the treasonable practices of the Romish priests. When the worship of
the catholics was suppressed, and the reformation introduced into the
universities, the King of Spain reflected, that as some species of
literature was requisite for the support of these doctrines and
controversies, the Romish communion must totally decay in England, if no
means were found to give erudition to the ecclesiastics; and for this
reason, he founded a seminary at Doüay, where the catholics sent
their children, chiefly those intended for the priesthood, in order to
receive the rudiments of their education. The cardinal of Lorraine imitated
this example by erecting a like seminary in his diocese of Rheims; and tho'
Rome was somewhat distant, the pope would not neglect to adorn, with a
foundation of the same nature, that capital of orthodoxy. These
seminaries, founded with this hostile intention, sent over every year a
colony of priests, who maintained the catholic superstition in the full
height of its bigotry; and being educated with a view to the crown of
martyrdom, were not deterred, either by danger or fatigue, from maintaining and
propagating their principles. They infused into all their votaries an extreme
<PB N="563" REF="168"/> hatred against the Queen; whom they treated as an
usurper, a schismatic, a he∣retic, a persecutor of the orthodox, and
one solemnly and publickly anathema∣tized by the holy father. Sedition,
rebellion, and even sometimes assassination, were the expedients, by
which they proposed to effectuate their purposes against her; and the
severe restraint, not to say persecution, under which the catholics
laboured, made them the more willingly receive, from their ghostly fathers,
such violent doctrines.</P>
<P>THESE seminaries were all of them under the direction of the
jesuits, a new order of regular priests erected in Europe; when the court
of Rome perceived, that the lazy monks and beggarly friars, who sufficed in
times of ignorance, were no longer able to defend the ramparts of the church,
assailed on every side, and that the inquisitive spirit of the age
required a society more active and more learned, to oppose its dangerous
progress. These men, as they stood foremost in the contest against
the protestants, drew on them the extreme animosity of that whole sect;
and by assuming a superiority over the other more numerous and more
antient orders of their own communion, were even exposed to the envy of their
brethren: So that it was no wonder, if the blame to which their principles and
conduct might be exposed, has, in many instances, been much exag∣gerated.
This reproach, however, they must bear from posterity, that, by the very
nature of their institution, they were engaged to pervert learning, the only
effectual remedy against superstition, into a nourishment of that
infirmity; and as their eru∣dition was chiefly of the ecclesiastical and
scholastic kind (tho' a few members have cultivated polite literature) they
were only the more enabled, by that acquisition, to refine away the
plainest dictates of morality, and to erect a regular system of
casuistry, by which prevarication, perjury, and every crime, where it
served their ghostly purposes, might be justified and defended.</P>
<P>THE jesuits, as devoted servants to the court of Rome,
exalted the preroga∣tive of the sovereign pontiff above all earthly power;
and by maintaining his authority of deposing Kings, set no bounds, either
to his spiritual or temporal jurisdiction. This doctrine became so
prevalent among the zealous catholics in England, that the excommunication,
fulminated against Elizabeth, excited many scruples of a singular kind,
to which it behoved the holy father to provide a remedy. The bull of Pius, in
absolving the subjects from their oaths of allegi∣ance, required them to
resist the Queen's usurpation; and many Romanists were apprehensive,
that, by this clause, they were obliged in conscience, even tho' no
favourable opportunity offered, to rebel against her, and that no dangers nor
difficulties could free them from this indispensible duty. But Parsons
and Cam∣pian, two jesuits, were sent over with a mitigation and explanation
of the doc∣trine; <PB N="564" REF="169"/> and they taught their votaries, that,
tho' the bull was for ever binding on Elizabeth and her partizans, it did not
oblige the catholics to obedience, except when the sovereign pontiff should
think proper, by a new summons, to require it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden,
p. 477.</NOTE>. Campian was afterwards detected in treasonable practices; and
being put to the rack, and confessing his guilt, he was publicly executed.
His execution was ordered at the very time, when the duke of Anjou was in
England, and prose∣cuted with the greatest appearance of success his
marriage with the Queen; and this severity was probably intended to appease
her protestant subjects, and to satisfy them, that, whatever measures
she might pursue, she never would depart from the principles of the
reformation.</P>
<P>WHILE hostilities were daily multiplying between Spain and
England, and while Elizabeth knew, that Philip, from resentment, from
bigotry, and from interest, was strongly, tho' secretly, induced to
effect her ruin, she saw the necessity of securing herself
against the efforts of so powerful and political a monarch. The obstinate
resistance of the states in the Netherlands gave her hopes, that his
force and treasure would be wasted in subduing these provinces; but the
admirable conduct and rapid progress of the prince of Parma struck her with
apprehensions; and as the acquisition, which Philip, about this time, made
of Portugal, brought him a great accession of riches and naval power, the
expe∣diency of seeking the protection of some powerful alliance became
every day the more apparent. The animosity, which still encreased between
the French mo∣narch and the duke of Guise, and the confederacy, which the
latter prince had secretly formed with Philip, opened the prospect of a
close alliance between the sovereigns of France and England; and the
general apprehensions, entertained by all Europe of the Spanish power,
seemed to require some general union for resist∣ing its farther
progress.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiations of marriage with the duke of
Anjou.</NOTE> THE duke of Alençon, now created duke of Anjou, had never
entirely dropped his pretensions to espouse Elizabeth; and that
princess, tho' her suitor was near twenty-five years younger than
herself, and had no knowlege of her person but by pictures or
descriptions, was still pleased with the counterfeit image, which his
addresses afforded her of love and tenderness. The duke, in order to
forward his suit, besides employing his brother's ambassadors, sent
over Simier, an agent of his own; an artful man, of an agreeable
conversation, who, soon remarking the Queen's humour, amused her with gay
discourse, and instead of serious political reasonings, which, he
found, only awakened her ambition, and hurt his master's interests,
introduced every moment all the topics of passion and <PB N="565" REF="170"/> of gallantry. The pleasure, which she found in this man's
society, soon pro∣duced a great familiarity between them; and amidst the
greatest hurry of business, her wisest ministers had not such
ready access to her person, as had Simier, who, under pretence of
negotiation, entertained her with accounts of the tender attach∣ment borne her
by the duke of Anjou. The earl of Leicester, who had never before been
alarmed with any courtship made to her, and who always trusted that her
love of dominion would prevail over her inclination to marriage, began to
apprehend, that she was at last caught in her own snare, and that the
artful encouragement, which she had given to this young suitor, had
unawares engaged her affections. To render Simier odious, he availed himself
of the credulity of the times, and spread reports, that that minister had
gained an ascendant over the Queen, not by any natural principles of her
constitution, but by incantations and love poti∣ons. Simier, in revenge,
endeavoured to discredit Leicester, and revealed to her a secret, which
none of her courtiers dared to discover, that this nobleman was secret∣ly,
without her consent, married to the widow of the earl of Essex; an
action, which the Queen interpreted either to proceed from want of respect to
her, or as a violation of their mutual attachment; and which so provoked her,
that she threatened to send him prisoner to the Tower<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 471.</NOTE>. The quarrel went so far between
Leicester and the French agent, that the former was suspected of having
em∣ployed one Tudor, a bravo, to take away the life of his enemy; and the Queen
thought it necessary, by proclamation, to put Simier under her own
protection. It happened, that while the Queen was rowed in her barge on the
Thames, at∣tended by Simier, and some of her courtiers, a shot was fired
which wounded one of her bargemen; but Elizabeth finding, upon enquiry, that
the piece had been discharged by accident, gave the person his liberty,
without farther punishment. So far was she from entertaining any suspic
on against her people, that she was many times heard to say, 
<Q REND="inline">"That she would lend

<P>THE duke of Anjou, encouraged by the accounts, which he received
of the Queen's prepossessions in his favour, paid her secretly a
visit at Greenwich; and after some conference with her, the purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not kn wn, he de∣parted. It appeared,

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Walsingham, to concert with

had sent over on this occassion a very

noblemen; and as the Queen had in a manner the power of prescribing what
terms she pleased, the articles were soon settled with the English
commis∣sioners. It was agreed, that the marriage should be celebrated
within six weeks after the ratification of the articles; that the duke and
his retinue should have the exercise of their religion; that after the
marriage he should bear the title of King, exercise of their religion; that
after the marriage he should bear the title of King, but the administration
should remain solely in the Queen; that their children, male or female,
should succeed to the crown of England; that if there be two males, the
eldest, in case of Henry's death without issue, should be King of
France, the younger of England; that if there be but one male, and he succeed
to the crown of France, he should be obliged to reside in England eight
months every two years; that the laws and customs of England should be
pre∣served inviolate; and that no foreigner should be promoted by the duke
to any office in England<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 484.</NOTE>.
These articles, providing for the security of England, in case of its
annexation to the crown of France, opened but a dismal prospect to the
English; had not the age of the Queen, who was now in her forty-ninth year,
contributed very much to allay their apprehensions of this nature. The Queen
also, as a proof of her still remaining uncertainty, added a clause, that
she was not bound to compleat the marriage, till farther articles, which are
not specified, shall be agreed on between the parties, and till the King of
France be certified of their agreement. Soon after the Queen sent over
Walsingham, as ambassador to France, in order to form closer connexions
with Henry, and enter into a league offensive and defensive against the
encreasing power and dan∣gerous usurpations of Spain. The French King, who
had been extremely dis∣turbed with the unquiet spirit, the restless
ambition, the enterprizing, and yet timid and inconstant disposition of
Anjou, had already sought to free the kingdom from his intrigues, by opening
a scene for his activity in Flanders; and having al∣lowed him to embrace the
protection of the states, had secretly supplied him with men and money
for that undertaking. The prospect of settling him in England was for a
like reason very agreeable to that monarch; and he was de∣sirous to
cultivate, by every expedient, the favourable sentiments, which Eliza∣beth
seemed to entertain towards them. But this princess, tho' she had gone
far∣ther in her amorous dalliance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 387, 396,
408, 426.</NOTE> than could be justified or accounted for by any principles
of policy, was not yet determined to bring matters to a final con∣clusion;
and she confined Walsingham, in his instructions, to the negotiating
con∣ditions of a mutual alliance between France and England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 352.</NOTE>. Henry with reluc∣tance submitted to hold
conferences on that subject; but no sooner had Walsing∣ham begun to
settle the conditions of alliance, than he was informed, that the 
<PB N="567" REF="172"/> Queen, foreseeing hostility with Spain to be the
result of this confederacy, had declared, that she would prefer the
marriage with the war, before the war with∣out the marriage<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 375, 391.</NOTE>. The French court, pleased with this
change of resolution, broke off the conferences concerning the league, and
opened a negotiation for the marriage<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
392.</NOTE>: But matters had not long proceeded in this train, before the Queen
again declared for the league in preference to the marriage, and ordered
Wal∣singham to renew the conferences for that purpose. Before he had
leizure to bring this point to maturity, he was interrupted by a new change of
resolution<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 408, 411.</NOTE>; and not
only the court of France, but Walsingham himself, Burleigh, and all the
wisest ministers of Elizabeth, were in amaze, doubtful where this
contest be∣tween inclination and reason, love and ambition, would at last
terminate.</P>
<P>IN the course of this affair, Elizabeth felt another variety
of intentions, from a new contest between her reason and her ruling
passions. The duke of Anjou ex∣pected some assistance of money, by
which he might be enabled to open the campaign in Flanders; and the Queen
herself, tho' her frugality made her long reluctant, was sensible that
this supply was necessary; and she was at last induced, after much
hesitation, to comply with his request<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid p.
3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7, 387, 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8, 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9, 426,

sent him a present of an hundred thousand crowns; by which, joined to his
own demesns and the as∣sistance of his brother and the Queen dowager,
he levied an army, and took the field against the prince of Parma. He was
successful in raising the siege of Cambray; and being chosen by the
states governor of the Netherlands, he put his army into winter quarters, and
came over to England, in order to prosecute his suit to the Queen. The
reception, which he met with, made him promise himself entire success,
and gave him hopes, that Elizabeth had surmounted all her scruples, and was
finally determined to make choice of him for her husband. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th Novem∣ber.</NOTE> In the midst of the
pomp, which attended the anniversary of her coronation, she was seen,
after long and intimate discourse with him, to take a ring from her own
finger, and to put it upon his; and all the spectators concluded, that, in
this ceremony, she had given him a promise of marriage, and was even
desirous of signifying her intention to all the world. St. Aldegonde,
ambassador from the states, dispatched immediately a letter to his
masters, informing them of this great event; and the inhabitants of Antwerp,
who, as well as the other lemings, regarded the Queen as a kind of tutelar
divinity, testified their joy by bonesires and the discharge of their
great ordnance<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 480. Thuau. lib

he intituled, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Gulph in which England will

apprehended and prosecuted by order from the Queen, and was condemned to
lose his right hand as a libeller. Such was the constancy and loyaity of
the man, that, immediately after the sen∣tence was executed, he took off his
hat with his other hand, and waving it over his head, cried 
<Q REND="inline">"God save the Queen."</Q></P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding this attachment, which Elizabeth so
openly discovered to the duke of Anjou, the contest of her sentiments was
not entirely over; and her ambition, as well as prudence, rouzing itself by
intervals, still filled her breast with doubt and hesitation. Almost
all the courtiers, whom she trusted and fa∣voured, Leicester, Hatton, and
Walsingham, discovered an extreme aversion to the marriage; and the
ladies of her bed chamber made no scruple of opposing her resolution with
the most zealous remonstrances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
486.</NOTE>. Among other enemies to the match, Sir Philip Sidney, son to Sir
Henry Sidney, lord deputy of Ireland, and nephew to Leicester; a young man
the most accomplished of that age; used the freedom to write her a
letter, where he disswaded her from her present resolution, with an
unusual elegance of expression, as well as force of reasoning. He told
her, that the security of her government depended entirely on the af∣fections
of her protestant subjects; and she could not, by any measure, more
effectually disgust them than by espousing a prince, who was son to
the perfidious Catherine, brother to the cruel and perfidious Charles, and who
had himself embrued his hands in the blood of the innocent and defenceless
protestants: That the catholics were her mortal enemies, and believed either
that she had originally usurped the crown, or was now lawfully deposed by
the pope's bull of excommu∣nication; and nothing had ever so much elevated
their hopes as the prospect of her marriage with the duke of Anjou: That her
chief security at present against the efforts of so numerous, rich, and
united a saction was, that they possessed no head who could conduct
their dangerous enterprizes; and she herself was rashly supplying that
defect, by giving an interest in the kingdom to a prince, whose education
had zealously attached him to that communion: That tho' he was a stranger
to the royal blood, the dispositions of men were now such, that they
preferred the religious to the civil connexions; and were more influenced by
the sympathy of religion than by the principles of legal and hereditary
government: That the duke himself had discovered a very restless and
turbulent spirit; and having often violated his loyalty to his elder brother
and his sovereign, there re∣mained no hopes that he would passively
submit to a woman, whom he might think himself intitled, in quality of
husband, to command: That the French nation, so populous, so much
abounding in soldiers, so full of nobility, who were <PB N="569" REF="174"/>
devoted to arms, and, for some time, accustomed to serve for plunder,
would supply him with partizans, dangerous to a people, unwarlike and
defenceless like the generality of her subjects: That the plain and
honourable path, which she had followed, of cultivating the affections of her
people, had hitherto rendered her reign secure and happy; and however her
enemies might seem to multiply upon her, the same invincible rampart was
still able to protect and defend her: That so long as the throne of France
was filled by Henry or his posterity, it was vain to hope that the ties of
blood would ensure the amity of that kingdom, preferably to the maxims of
policy or the prejudices of religion; and if ever the crown devolved to the
duke of Anjou, the conjunction of France and England would prove a burthen,
rather than a protection, to the latter kingdom: That the example of her
sister Mary was sufficient to instruct her in the danger of such
connections; and to prove, that the affections and confidence of the English
could never be maintained, where they had such reason to apprehend that
their interests would every moment be sacrificed to those of a foreign
and hostile na∣tion: That notwithstanding these great inconveniencies,
discovered by past expe∣rience, the house of Burgundy, it must be
confessed, was more popular in the nation than the family of France; and,
what was of chief moment, Philip was of the same communion with Mary, and was
connected with her by this great band of interest and affection: And that
however the Queen might remain child∣less, even tho' old age should grow
upon her, the singular felicity and glory of her reign would preserve her
from contempt; the affections of her subjects, and those of all the
protestants in Europe, would defend her from attacks; and her own prudence,
without other aid or assistance, would baffle all the efforts of her
most malignant enemies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters of the Sydneys, vol.
I. p. 28<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and seq. Cabbala, p.
36<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE reflections kept the Queen in great anxiety and
irresolution; and she was observed to pass several nights without any
sleep or repose. At last her set∣tled habits of prudence and ambition
prevailed over her temporary inclination; and having sent for the duke of
Anjou, she had a long conversation with him in private, where she was
supposed to have made him apologies for the breaking her former
engagements. He expressed great disgust on his departure; threw away
the ring which she had given him; and uttered many curses on the mutability
of women, and of islanders<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 48<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Soon after, he went over to
his government of the Netherlands; lost the confidence of the States, by a
rash and violent attempt on their liberties; was expelled that country;
retired into France; and there died. The Queen, by her timely reflection,
saved herself from the numerous mischiefs which must have attended so
imprudent a marriage: And the present distracted <PB N="570" REF="175"/>
<MILESTONE N="1582" UNIT="year"/> state of the French monarchy, prevented her
feeling any effects of that resent∣ment which she bad reason to dread
from the affront so wantonly put upon that royal family.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> THE anxiety of the
Queen, from the attempts of the English catholics, never ceased during the
whole course of her reign; but the variety of revolutions which happened in
all the neighbouring kingdoms, were the source sometimes of her hopes,
sometimes of her apprehensions. This year the affairs of Scotland
strong∣ly engaged her attention. The influence which the earl of Lenox, and
James Stuart, who now assumed the title of earl of Arran, had acquired over
the young King, was but a slender foundation of authority; while the
generality of the nobles, and all the preachers, were so much discontented
with their administra∣tion. The assembly of the church appointed a
solemn fast; of which one of the avowed reasons was the danger in which
the King stood from the company of wicked persons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 319.</NOTE>: And on that day the pulpits
resounded with declamations against Lenox, Arran, and the King's present
counsellors. When the minds of the people were sufficiently prepared by
these lectures, a conspiracy of the nobi∣lity was formed, probably with the
concurrence of Elizabeth, for seizing the per∣son of James at Ruthven, a
seat of the earl of Gowry; and the design, being kept very secret,
succeeded without any opposition. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 August.</NOTE> The leaders in this
enter∣prize were, the earl of Gowry himself, the earl of Marre, the lords
Lindesey and Boyd, the masters of Glamis and Oliphant, the abbots of
Dunfermline, Paisley, and Cambuskenneth. The King wept when he found
himself detained a pri∣soner; but the master of Glamis said, 
<Q REND="inline">"No matter for his tears: Better that boys
should weep than bearded men:"</Q> An expression which James could never
afterwards forget<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 320.</NOTE>. But
notwithstanding his resentment, he found it necessary to submit to
the present necessity. He pretended an entire acquiescence in the
con∣duct of the associators; acknowleged the detention of his person to
be acceptable service; and agreed, to summon both an assembly of the
church and a convention of estates, in order to ratify that enterprize. The
assembly, tho' they had establish∣ed it as an inviolable rule, that the
King, on no account, and on no occasion, should ever intermeddle in
ecclesiastical matters, made no scruple of taking civil affairs under
their cognizance, and of giving their verdict, that the attempt of the
conspirators was acceptable to all that feared God, or tendered the
preserva∣tion of the King's person, and prosperous state of the realm.
They even enjoin∣ed all the clergy to recommend these sentiments from the
pulpit; and they threat∣ened with ecclesiastical censures every man who
should oppose the authority of the consederated lords<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 322.</NOTE>. The convention, being composed chiefly of
these lords them∣selves, <PB N="571" REF="176"/> added their sanction to
these proceedings. Arran was confined a prisoner to his own house: Lenox,
tho' he had power to resist, yet rather than excite a civil war, or be the
cause of bloodshed<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heylin's Hist.
Presbyter. p. 227. Spotswood.</NOTE>, chose to retire into France, where
he soon after died. He persevered to the last in his conversion to the
protestant reli∣gion; which the Scotch clergy would never be persuaded that
he had sincerely embraced. The King sent for his family, restored his
son to his paternal honours and estate, took care to establish the
fortunes of all his other children; and to his last moments never forgot the
early friendship which he had borne their father: A strong proof of the
good dispositions of that prince<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NO sooner was this revolution known in England, than the Queen
sent Sir Henry Cary, and Sir Robert Bowes to James, in order to congratulate
him on his deliverance from the pernicious counsels of Lenox and Arran; to
exhort him not to resent the seeming violence of the lords' enterprize; and
to procure from him permission for the return of the earl of Angus, who,
ever since Morton's fall, had lived in England. They easily prevailed in
the last application; and as James suspected, that Elizabeth had not been
entirely unacquainted with the project of his detention, he thought proper,
before the English ambassadors, to dissemble his resentment
against the confederated noblemen. Soon after La Mothe-Fenelon, and
Menneville, appeared as ambassadors from France:
<MILESTONE N="1583" UNIT="year"/> Their errand was to enquire concerning the
situation of the King, make professions of their master's friendship,
confirm the ancient league with France, and procure an ac∣commodation between
him and the Queen of Scots. This last proposal gave great umbrage to the
clergy; and the assembly had already voted, the settling of terms between
the mother and son, to be a most wicked undertaking. The pul∣pits
resounded with declamations against the French ambassadors;
particularly Fene∣lon, whom they called the Messenger of the bloody
murderer, meaning the duke of Guise: And as that minister, being knight of
the Holy Ghost, wore a white cross on his shoulder, they commonly
denominated it in contempt, the badge of Antichrist. The King endeavoured,
tho' in vain, to repress these insolencies; but in order to make the
ambassadors some compensation, he desired the magistrates of
Edinburgh to give them a splendid dinner before their departure. To prevent
this entertainment, the clergy appointed that very day for a public fast; and
finding that their orders were not regarded, they employed their whole
sermons in thundering curses on the magistrates, who, by the King's
direction, had put this mark of respect on the ambassadors. They even
pursued them afterwards with the censures of the church; and it was with
difficulty they prevented from <PB N="572" REF="177"/> passing the
sentence of excommunication against them, on account of their
sub∣mission to royal, preferably to clerical, authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 324.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT increased the alarm with regard to an accommodation
between James and Mary, was, that the English ambassadors seemed to
concur with the French in this proposal; and the clergy were so ignorant as
to credit the sincerity of the professions made by the former. The Queen
of Scots had often made overtures to Elizabeth, which had been entirely
neglected; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter of Queen Mary to Elizabeth.</NOTE> but
hearing of James's deten∣tion, she wrote a letter in a more pathetic and more
spirited strain than usual; craving the assistance of that
princess, both for her own and her son's liberty. She said, that the
account of the prince's captivity had excited her most tender concern; and
the experience which she herself, during so many years, had of the
extreme infelicity attending that situation, had made her the more
apprehensive, lest a like fate should her unhappy offspring: That the
long train of in∣justice which she had suffered; the calumnies to which
she had been exposed; were so grievous, that, finding no place for right
or truth among men, she was reduced to make her last appeal to heaven, the
only competent tribunal between princes of equal jurisdiction, degree, and
dignity: That after her rebellious sub∣jects, secretly instigated by
Elizabeth's ministers, had expelled her from the throne, had confined her to
prison, had pursued her with arms, she had voluntarily thrown herself
under the protection of England, fatally allured by those reiter∣ated
professions of amity which had been made her, and by her confidence in the
generosity of a friend, an ally, and a kinswoman: That not contented with
de∣barring her from her presence, with supporting the usurpers of her
throne, with contributing to the destruction of her faithful subjects,
Elizabeth had reduced her to a worse captivity than that from which she had
escaped, and had made her this cruel return for the unlimited trust which
she had reposed in her: That tho' her resentment of such severe
usage had never carried her farther than to use some disappointed
efforts for her deliverance, unhappy to herself, and fatal to others, she
found the rigours of confinement daily multiplied upon her; and at length
carried to such a height as surpassed the bounds of all human patience
any longer to endure them: That she was cut off from all communication, not
only with the rest of mankind, but also with her only son; and her
maternal fondness, which was now more enlivened by their unhappy sympathy
in situation, and was her sole remaining attachment to the world, deprived
even of that melancholy solace, which letters or messages could give:
That the bitterness of her sorrows, still more than her close
consinement, had preyed upon her health, and had added the insufferable
weight of bodily infirmity to all those other calamities under which 
<PB N="573" REF="178"/> she laboured: That while the daily experience of her
maladies opened to her the comfortable prospect of an approaching deliverance
into a region where pain and sorrow are no more, her enemies envied her that
last consolation; and having se∣cluded her from every joy on earth, had
done what in them lay to debar her from all hopes in her future and eternal
existence: That the exercise of her religion was refused her; the usage
of those rites in which she had been educated; the commerce with those
holy ministers, whom heaven had appointed to receive the acknowlegement of
our transgressions, and to seal our penitence by a solemn
re-admission into heavenly favour and forgiveness: That it was in vain to
com∣plain of the rigours of persecution exercised in other kingdoms; when a
Queen, and an innocent woman, was excluded from an indulgence which never yet,
in the most barbarous countries, had been denied to the meanest and most
criminal malefactor: That could she ever be induced to descend from that
royal dignity in which Providence had placed her, or depart from her appeal to
Heaven, there was only one other tribunal to which she would appeal from all
her enemies; to the justice and humanity of Elizabeth's own breast, and to
that lenity, which, uninfluenced by malignant counsel, she would naturally
be induced to exercise to∣wards her: And that she finally intreated her, to
resume her natural disposition, and to reflect on the support, as well
as comfort, which she might receive from her son and herself, if, joining
the obligations of gratitude to the ties of blood, she would deign to raise
them from their present melancholy situation, and re∣instate them in that
liberty and authority to which they were entitled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was chiefly induced to obstruct Mary's
restoration, because she foresaw an unhappy alternative attending that
event. If this princess recovered any considerable share of authority in
Scotland, her resentment, ambition, zeal, and connections, both domestic
and foreign, might render her a dangerous neigh∣bour to England, and enable
her, after suppressing the English party among her subjects, to
revive those pretensions which she had formerly advanced to the crown,
and which her partizans in both kingdoms still supported with great
in∣dustry and assurance. If she was reinstated in power, with such
strict limitations as could not be broken, she might be disgusted with
her situation; and flying abroad, form more desperate attempts than any
sovereign, who had a crown to hazard, would willingly undertake. Mary
herself, sensible of these difficulties, and convinced by experience,
that Elizabeth would for ever debar her the throne, was now become more humble
in her wishes; and as age and infirmities had repressed those
sentiments of ambition and indignation, by which she was former∣ly so
much agitated, she was willing to sacrifice all her hopes of power and 
<PB N="574" REF="179"/> grandeur, in order to obtain a little more liberty; a
blessing to which she very naturally aspired with the fondest
impatience. She proposed, therefore, that she should be associated
with her son in the title to the crown of Scotland, but that the
administration should remain solely in him: And she was contented to
live in England, in a private station, and even in a kind of restraint; but
with some more liberty, both for exercise and company, than she had
enjoyed since the first discovery of her intrigues with the duke of
Norfolk. But Elizabeth, who was afraid lest such a loose method of
guarding her, would facilitate her escape into France or Spain, or, at
least, would encourage and increase her partizans, and enable her to
conduct those intrigues to which she had already discovered so strong
a propensity, was secretly determined to deny her requests; and tho'
she feigned to assent to them, she well knew how to disappoint the
expectations of the unhap∣py princess. While Lenox maintained his authority
in Scotland, she never gave any reply to all the applications made her by the
Scottish Queen<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 540.</NOTE>:
At present, when her own creatures had acquired possession of the
government, she was re∣solved to throw the odium of the refusal upon
them; and pretending, that no∣thing was required to a perfect accommodation,
but the concurrence of the coun∣cil of state of Scotland, she ordered her
ambassador, Bowes, to open the nego∣ciation for Mary's liberty, and her
association with her son in the title to the crown. Tho' she seemed
to make this concession to Mary, she refused her the liberty of
sending any ambassador of her own; and that princess could easily
conjecture, from this circumstance, what would be the issue of the
pretended ne∣gociation. The Scotch council, instigated by the clergy,
rejected all treaty; and James, who was now a captive in their hands, affirmed,
that he had never assented to an association with his mother, and that
the matter had never gone farther than some loose proposals for that
purpose<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">MS. in the Advocate's library, A. 3.
28. p. 401. from the Cott. Lib. Calig. c. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE affairs of Scotland remained not long on the present
footing. James, impatient of restraint, made his escape from his keepers;
and flying to St. An∣drews, summoned his friends and partizans to attend him.
The earls of Argyle, Marshal, Montrose, and Rothes, hastened to pay their
duty to their sovereign; and the opposite party found themselves unable
to resist so powerful a combina∣tion. They were offered a pardon, upon
their submission, and an acknowlege∣ment of their fault, in seizing the
King's person, and restraining him from his liberty. Some of them accepted
of the terms: The greater number, particu∣larly Angus, Hamilton, Marre, Glamis,
left the country; and took shelter in <PB N="575" REF="180"/> Ireland or
England, where they were protected by Elizabeth. The earl of Arran was recalled
to court; and the malecontents, who could not brook the authority of Lenox, a
man of virtue and moderation, found, that, by their resistance, they had
thrown all the power into the hands of a person whose councils were as
vio∣lent as his manners were profligate<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 325, 326, &amp; seq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH wrote a letter to James; where she quoted a moral
sentence from Isocrates, and indirectly reproached him with inconstancy,
and a breach of his engagements. James, in his reply, justified his
measures; and turned two pas∣sages of Isocrates against her, for one
which she had directed against him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 140,
141. Strype, vol. III. p. 165.</NOTE>. She next sent Walsingham in an
embassy to him; and her chief purpose in employ∣ing that aged minister
on an errand where so little business was to be trans∣acted, was to
learn, from a man of so much penetration and discernment, the real
character and capacity of James. This young prince possessed very good
parts, tho' not accompanied with that vigour and industry which his station
re∣quired; and as he excelled in general discourse and conversation,
Walsingham entertained a higher idea of his talents than he was afterwards
found, when real business was transacted, to have fully merited<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 148. Jebb, vol. II. p. 536.</NOTE>. The
account which he gave his mistress, induced her to treat him thenceforth
with some more regard than she had hitherto been inclined to pay him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1584" UNIT="year"/> THE King of Scots,
persevering in his present views, summoned a Parliament; where it was
enacted, that no clergyman should presume, in his sermons, to utter
false, untrue, or scandalous sayings against the King, the council, or
the public measures, or to meddle, in an improper manner, with the affairs of
his majesty and the states<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p.
333.</NOTE>. The clergy, finding that the pulpit would be no longer a
sanctuary for them, were extremely offended: They said, that the King was
become popish in his heart; and they gave their adversaries the epithets of
gross libertines, belly gods, and infamous persons<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 334.</NOTE>. The violent conduct of Arran
soon brought over the popularity to their side. The earl of Gowry, tho'
pardoned for the late at∣tempt, was committed to prison, was tried on some
new accusations, condemned, and executed. Many innocent persons suffered
from the tyranny of this favou∣rite; and the banished lords, being
assisted by Elizabeth, now found the time favourable for the recovery of
their estates and authority. After they had been soiled in one attempt upon
Stirling, they prevailed in another; and being ad∣mitted to the King's
presence, were pardoned, and restored to his favour.</P>
<P><PB N="576" REF="181"/> ARRAN was degraded from authority;
deprived of that estate and title which he had usurped; and the whole
country seemed to be composed to tran∣quillity. Elizabeth, after
opposing, during some time, the credit of this fa∣vourite, had found it
more expedient, before his fall, to compose all differences with him, by the
means of Davison, a minister whom she sent to Scotland: But having more
confidence in the lords, whom she had helped to restore, she was
pleased with this alteration of affairs; and maintained a good
correspondence with the new court and ministry of James.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspiracies in England.</NOTE> THESE
revolutions in Scotland would have been regarded as of small import∣ance to
the repose and security of Elizabeth, had her own subjects been entirely
united, and had not the zeal of the catholics, excited by constraint, more
pro∣perly than persecution, daily threatened her with some dangerous
insurrection. The vigilance of the ministers, particularly of Burleigh and
Walsingham, was raised in proportion to the activity of the malecontents;
and many arts, which had been blameable in a more peaceable government, were
employed to detect con∣spiracies, and even discover the secret
inclinations of men. Counterfeit letters were wrote in the name of the Queen of
Scots, or of the English exiles, and privately conveyed to the houses of
the catholics: Spies were hired to observe the actions and discourse of
suspected persons: Informers were countenanced: And tho' the sagacity
of these two great ministers helped them to distinguish the true from
the false intelligence, many calumnies were, no doubt, hearkened to, and all
the subjects, particularly the catholics, kept in the utmost anxiety and
in∣quietude. Henry Piercy, earl of Northumberland, brother to the earl
be∣headed some years before, and Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, son to the
un∣fortunate duke of Norfolk, fell under suspicion; and the latter was, by
order of the council, confined to his own house. Francis Throcmorton, a
private gentle∣man, was committed to custody, on account of a letter which he
had wrote to the Queen of Scots, and which was intercepted. Lord Pager, and
Charles Arundel, who had been engaged with him in treasonable designs,
immediately withdrew beyond sea. Throcmorton confessed, that a plan for
an invasion and insurrection had been laid; and tho', on his trial, he was
desirous of retracting this confession, and imputing it to the fear of
torture, he was found guilty and executed. Men∣doza, the Spanish
ambassador, having promoted this conspiracy, was ordered to depart the
kingdom; and Wade was sent into Spain, to excuse his dismission, and
to desire the King to send another ambassador in his place: But Philip
would not so much as admit the English ambassador to his presence.
Creighton, a Scotch Jesuit, coming over on board a vessel which was
seized, tore some papers, with <PB N="577" REF="182"/> an intention of
throwing them into the sea; but the wind blowing them back upon the ship,
they were put together, and discovered some dangerous secrets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MANY of these conspiracies were, with great appearance of
reason, imputed to the contrivances of the Queen of Scots<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 246.</NOTE>; and as her name was employed in
all of them, the council thought, that they could not use too many
pre∣cautions against the danger of her claims, and the restless activity
of her temper. She was removed from under the care of the earl of Shrewsbury,
who, tho' vi∣gilant and faithful in that trust, had also been indulgent to
his prisoner, parti∣cularly with regard to air and exercise: And she was
committed to the custody of Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drue Drury; men of
honour, but inflexible and rigid in their care and attention. An
association was also set on foot by the earl of Leicester and other
courtiers; and as Elizabeth was extremely beloved by the whole nation, except
the more zealous catholics, men of all ranks willingly flocked to the
subscription of it. The purport of this association was to defend the
Queen, to revenge her death or any injury committed against her, and to
ex∣clude from the throne any person, whatever title they possessed,
by whose sug∣gestion, or for whose behoof, any violence should be
offered to her majesty<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">State Trial<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, vol. I. p. 122, 123.</NOTE>. The
Queen of Scots was sensible, that this association was levelled
against her; and to remove all suspicion from herself, she also
desired leave to sub∣scribe it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Novem∣ber.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> ELIZABETH, that she
might the more discourage all malecontents, by shewing them the concurrence
of the nation in her favour, summoned a new Parliament; and she met with
that dutiful attachment, which she expected. The association was
confirmed by Parliament; and a clause was added, by which the Queen was
em∣powered to name commissioners for the trial of any pretender to the
crown, who should attempt or imagine any invasion, insurrection, or
assassination against the Queen: Upon condemnation, pronounced by
these commissioners, the person was excluded from all claim to the
succession, and was farther punishable, as her majesty should
direct. And for the greater security, a council of regency, in case of the
Queen's violent death, was appointed to govern the kingdom, to settle the
succession, and to take vengeance of that act of treason<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">27 Eliz. cap. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A SEVERE law was also enacted against jesuits and popish
priests: That they should depart the kingdom within forty days; that
those who should remain be∣yond that time, or should afterwards return,
should be guilty of high treason; that those who harboured or relieved
them should be guilty of felony; that <PB N="578" REF="183"/> those who were
educated in seminaries, if they returned not in six months after notice
given, and submitted not themselves to the Queen, before a bishop or two
justices, should be guilty of high treason: And that if any, so
submitting themselves, should, within ten years, approach the Queen's
court, or come within ten miles of it, their submission should be
void<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>. By this law, the exercise of the catholic
religion, which had formerly been prohibited under lighter penalties, and which
was, in many instances, connived at, was totally suppressed. In the
subsequent part of the Queen's reign, the law was sometimes executed, by
the capital punishment of priests; and tho' the partizans of that
princess asserted, that they were punished for their treason, not
their religion, the apology must only be so understood that this severe
law was enacted on account of the treason∣able views and attempts of the
sect, not that every individual, who suffered the penalty of the law, was
convicted of treason<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Some even of those who
defend the Queen's measures, allow that in ten years fifty priests were
executed and fifty-five banished. Camden, p. 649.</NOTE>. The catholics,
therefore, might now justly complain of a very violent persecution; which,
we may safely affirm, in spite of the rigid and bigotted maxims of that
age, not to be the best method of converting them, or of reconciling them to
the established government and religion.</P>
<P>THE Parliament, besides arming the Queen with these powers,
granted her a supply of one subsidy and two fifteenths. The only
circumstance, in which their proceedings were disagreeable to her, was an
application, which the commons made for a farther reformation in
ecclesiastical matters. Yet even in this attempt, which affected her, as
well as them, in a very delicate point, they discovered how much they were
overawed by her authority. The majority of the house were puritans, or
inclined to that sect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Besides the petition
after-mentioned, another proof of the prevalency of the puritans among the
commons was their passing a bill for the reverend observance of Sunday,
which they called the Sab∣bath, and the depriving the people of those
amusements, which they were accustomed to take on that day. D'Ewes, p. 335.
It was a strong symptom of a contrary spirit in the upper house, that
they proposed to add Wednesday to the fast days, and to prohibit entirely
the eating of flesh on that day▪ D'Ewes, p. 373.</NOTE>; but the
severe reprimands, which they had already, in former sessions, met with
from the throne, deterred them from introducing any bill concerning religion; a
proceeding which would have been interpreted as an incroachment on the royal
prerogative: They were contented to proceed by way of humble petition, and that
not to her majesty, which would certainly have given some offence, but to
the house of lords, or rather to the bishops, who had a seat in that
house, and from whom alone they were con∣tented <PB N="579" REF="184"/> to
receive all advances towards reformation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p.
357.</NOTE>. A strange departure from what we now apprehend to be the dignity
of the commons!</P>
<P>THE commons desired in their humble petition, that no bishop
should exercise his function of ordination but with the consent and
concurrence of six presbyters: A demand, which as it would have introduced
a change of ecclesiastical government, was firmly rejected by the prelates.
They desired, that no clergyman should be instituted into any benefice,
without previous warning being given to the parish, that they might examine
whether there lay any objection to his life or doctrine: But this attempt
towards a popular model naturally met with the same fate. In another article
of the petition, they prayed, that the bishops should not insist upon
every ceremony, or deprive incumbents for omitting a part of the service: As
if uniformity in public worship had not been established by law; or as if
the prelates had been endowed with a dispensing power. They complained of
abuses, which prevailed, in denouncing the sentence of excommunication, and
entreated the reverend fathers to think of some law for the remedy of these
abuses: Im∣plying, that those matters were too high for the commons of
themselves to meddle with them.</P>
<P>BUT the most material article, which the commons touched upon
in their pe∣tition, was the ecclesiastical commission, and the oath
<HI>ex officio,</HI> as it was called, exacted by that court. This is a
subject of such importance, as to merit some explanation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ecclesias∣tical court.</NOTE> THE
first primate after the Queen's accession, was Parker; a man rigid in
ex∣acting conformity to the established worship, and in punishing by
fines or depri∣vations, all the puritans, who attempted to innovate any thing
in the habits, ceremonies, or liturgy of the church. He died in 1575; and was
succeeded by Grindal, who, as he himself inclined to the new sect, was
with great difficulty brought to execute the law against them, or to punish
the nonconforming clergy. He declined obeying the Queen's orders for the
suppression of <HI>prophecyings,</HI> which, she apprehended, had
become so many academies of fanaticism; and for this offence, she had, by
an order of the Star Chamber, sequestered him from his archiepiscopal
function, and confined him to his own house. Upon his death, which happened
in 1583, she was determined not to fall into the same error in her next
choice; and she named Whitgift, a zealous churchman, who had al∣ready
signalized his pen in controversy, and who, having in vain attempted to
convince the puritans by argument, was now determined to open their eyes by
power, and by the execution of penal statutes. He informed the Queen, that
all the spiritual authority lodged in the prelates was vain without the
sanction of the <PB N="580" REF="185"/> crown; and as there was no
ecclesiastical commission at that time in force, he engaged her to
issue a new one; more arbitrary than any of the former, and conveying more
unlimited authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neal's History of the Puritans,
vol. I. p. 410.</NOTE>. She appointed forty-four commissioners, twelve of
whom were ecclesiastics; three commissioners could exercise the whole
power of the court; their jurisdiction extended over the whole kingdom, and
over all orders of men; and every circumstance of their authority, and all
their methods of proceeding, were contrary to the clearest principles of law
and na∣tural equity. They were empowered to visit and reform all errors,
heresies, schisms, in a word, to regulate all opinions, as well as to
punish all breach of uniformity in the exercise of public worship. They
were directed to make en∣quiry, not only by the legal methods of juries and
witnesses, but by all other means and ways, which they could devise; that
is, by the rack, by torture, by inquisition, by imprisonment. Where they
thought proper to suspect any person, they might administer to him an
oath, called <HI>ex officio,</HI> by which he was bound to answer all
questions, and might thereby be obliged to accuse himself or his most
intimate friend. The fines, which they imposed, were merely discretionary,
and often occasioned the total ruin of the offenders, con∣trary to the
established law of the kingdom. The imprisonment, to which they condemned
any delinquent, was limited by no rule but their own plea∣sure. They
assumed a power of imposing on the clergy what new articles of
subscription, and consequently of faith, they thought proper. Tho' all
other spiritual courts were subject, since the reformation, to
inhibitions from the su∣preme courts of law, the ecclesiastical
commissioners exempted themselves from that legal jurisdiction, and
were liable to no controul. And the more to enlarge their authority, they were
empowered to punish all incests, adulteries, fornica∣tions; all outrages,
misbehaviours, and disorders in marriage: And the punish∣ments, which
they might inflict, were according to their wisdom, conscience, and
discretion. In a word, this court was a real <HI>inquisition;</HI> attended
with all the iniquities, as well as cruelties, inseparable from that horrid
tribunal. And as the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical court was
destructive of all law, so its erection was deemed by many a mere
usurpation of this imperious princess, and had no other foundation than a
clause of a statute, restoring the supremacy to the crown, and
empowering the sovereign to appoint commissioners for exercising that
pre∣rogative. But prerogative in general, and especially the supremacy,
were sup∣posed in that age to involve powers, which no law, precedent, or
reason could limit and determine.</P>
<P><PB N="581" REF="186"/> BUT tho' the commons, in their humble
petition to the prelates, had touched so gently and submissively the
ecclesiastical grievances, the Queen, in a speech from the throne at the
end of the session, could not forbear taking notice of their
presumption, and reproving them for those murmurs, which, for fear of
offend∣ing her, they had pronounced so low as not directly to reach her royal
ears. After giving them some general thanks for their attachment to her, and
making professions of affection to her subjects, she told them, that
whoever found fault with the church threw a slander upon her, since she
was appointed <HI>by God</HI> su∣preme ruler over it, and no heresies or
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hisms could prevail in the
kingdom but by her permission and negligence: That some abuses must
necessarily have place in every thing; but she warned the prelates to be
watchful; for if she found them careless of their charge, she was fully
determined to depose them: That she was commonly supposed to have
employed herself in many studies, particu∣larly philosophical (by which,
I suppose, she meant theological) and she would confess, that few,
whose leizure had not allowed them to make profession of science, had
read or reflected more: That as she could discern the presumption of
many, in curiously canvassing the scriptures, and starting
innovations, she would no longer endure this licence; but meant to guide her
people, by God's rule, in the just mean between the corruptions of Rome and
the errors of mo∣dern sectaries: And that as the Romanists were the
inveterate enemies of her person, so the other innovators were dangerous to
all kingly government; and under colour of preaching the word of God,
presumed to exercise their private judgment, and to censure the actions
of the prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 328. This sect had indeed
gone so far, that a book of discipline was secretly sub∣scribed by
above five hundred clergymen; and the presbyterian government thereby
established in the midst of the church, notwithstanding the rigour of
the prelates and of the high commission. So im∣possible is it by penal
statutes, however severe, to suppress all religious innovation. See

<P>FROM the whole of this transaction, we may observe, that the
commons, in their general application to the prelates, as well as some
particular articles of their petition, showed themselves wholly ignorant,
no less than the Queen, of the principles of liberty and a legal
constitution. And it may not be unworthy of remark, that Elizabeth, so far
from yielding to the displeasure of the Parliament against the
ecclesiastical commission, granted a new commission before the end
of her reign; in which she enlarged, rather than restrained, the powers of
the com∣missioners<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 292,
386, 400.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="582" REF="187"/> DURING this session of Parliament,
there was discovered a conspiracy, which much encreased the natural
animosity against the catholics, and still farther widened the breach
between the religious parties. William Parry, a catholic gentleman, had
received the Queen's pardon for a crime, by which he was ex∣posed to capital
punishment; and having got permission to travel, he retired to Milan, and
made open profession of his religion, which he had concealed while he
remained in England. He was here persuaded by Palmio, a jesuit, that he
could not perform a more meritorious action, than to take away the life of his
sovereign and his benefactress; the nuncio, Campeggio, when consulted,
approved extremely of this pious undertaking; and Parry, tho' still agitated
with doubts, came to Paris, with an intention of passing over to England,
and executing his bloody purpose. He was here encouraged in the design by
Thomas Morgan, a gentleman of great credit in the party; and tho' Watts and
some other catholic priests told him, that the enterprize was criminal and
impious, he preferred the authority of Raggazzoni, the pope's nuncio at Paris,
and was determined to persist in his resolution. He here wrote a letter
to the pope, which was conveyed to cardinal Como; communicated his intention to
the holy father; and craved his absolution and paternal benediction. He
received an answer from the cardi∣nal, by which he perceived that his
purpose was extremely applauded; and he came over to England with a full
design of carrying it into execution. So deeply are the sentiments of
morality engraved in mens breasts, that it is very difficult even for the
prejudices of false religion totally to efface them; and this bigotted
assassin resolved, before he came to extremity, to try every other
expedient for alleviating the persecutions, under which the catholics at that
time laboured. He found means of being introduced to the Queen; assured her
that many conspira∣cies were formed against her; and exhorted her, as the
only means of saving her life, to give the Romanists some more indulgence
in the exercise of their religion: But lest he should be tempted by the
opportunity to assassinate her, he always came to court unprovided of
every offensive weapon. He even procured himself to be elected member of
Parliament; and having made a vehement speech against the severe laws
enacted this last session, was committed to custody for his freedom,
and sequestred from the house. His failure in these attempts confirmed
him the more in his former resolution, and he communicated his intentions to
Nevil, who entered zealously into the design, and was determined to have a
share in the merits of its execution. A book, newly published by Dr. Allen,
afterwards created a cardinal, served farther to efface all their scruples,
with regard to the murder of a heretical prince; and having agreed to shoot
the Queen as she was riding on horseback, they resolved, if they could
not make their escape, to sacrifice their <PB N="583" REF="188"/> lives in
fulfilling a duty, so agreeable, as they imagined, to the will of God, and to
true religion. But while they were watching an opportunity for the exe∣cution
of their purpose, the earl of Westmoreland happened to die in exile; and as
Nevil was next heir to that family, he began to entertain hopes, that, by doing
an acceptable service to the Queen, he might recover the estate and
ho∣nours which had been forfeited by the rebellion of the last earl.
<MILESTONE N="1585" UNIT="year"/> He betrayed the whole conspiracy to the
ministers; and Parry, being thrown into prison, con∣fessed the guilt,
both to them, and to the jury who tried him. The letter from cardinal Como
being produced in court, put Parry's narrative beyond all ques∣tion; and that
criminal, having received sentence of death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State
Trials, vol. I. p. 103. &amp; seq. Strype, vol. III. p. 255 &amp;
seq.</NOTE>, suffered the punish∣ment, which the law appointed for his
treasonable conspiracy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This year, the earl
of Northumberland, brother to the earl beheaded some years before, had been
engaged in a conspiracy with lord Paget for the delivery of the Queen of
Scots. He was thrown into the Tower; and being conscious that his guilt could
be proved upon him, at least, that sentence would infallibly be pronounced
against him, he freed himself from farther prosecution by a voluntary
death. He shot himself into the breast with a pistol. About the same
time, the earl of Arundel, son to the unfortunate duke of Norfolk, having
entered into some exceptionable measures, and re∣flecting on the unhappy
fate, which had attended his family, endeavoured to depart secretly beyond
sea, but was discovered and thrown into the Tower. In 1587 this nobleman
was brought to his trial for high treason; chiefly because he had dropped
some expressions of affection to the Spaniards, and had affirmed that he
would have masses said for the success of the armada. His peers found
him guilty of treason: This severe sentence was not executed; but Arundel
never recovered his liberty. He died a prisoner in 1595. He carried his
religious austerities so far, that they were believed the immediate cause
of his death.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE bloody designs now appeared every where, as the result
of that bigotted spirit by which the two religions, especially the
catholic, were at this time actu∣ated. One Somerville, a gentleman of the
county of Warwic, somewhat dis∣ordered in his understanding, had heard
so much of the merit attending the as∣sassination of heretics and
persecutors, that he came to London with a view of murdering the Queen; but
having betrayed his design by some extravagances, he was thrown into
prison, and there perished by a voluntary death<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 495.</NOTE>.

same design against the prince of Orange; and that great man perished
at Delst, by the hands of a desperate assassin, who, with a
resolution worthy of a better cause, sacrificed his own life, in order to
destroy the famous restorer and pro∣tector of religious liberty. The
Flemings, who regarded that prince as their fa∣ther, were filled with infinite
regret, as well when they considered the miserable end of so brave a
patriot, as their own forlorn condition, from the loss of so 
<PB N="584" REF="189"/> powerful and prudent a leader, and from the rapid
progress of the Spanish arms. The prince of Parma had made every year great
advances upon them, had re∣duced several of the provinces to obedience, and
had laid close siege to Antwerp, the richest and most populous city of
the Netherlands, whose subjection, it was foreseen, would give a mortal
blow to the already declining affairs of the revolted States. The only hopes
which remained to them, arose from the prospect of fo∣reign succours.
Being well acquainted with the cautious and frugal maxims of Elizabeth, they
promised themselves better success in France; and in the view of
engaging Henry to embrace their defence, they tendered him the sove∣reignty
of their provinces. But the present condition of that monarchy ob∣liged the
King to reject so advantageous an offer. The duke of Anjou's death, which, he
thought, would have delivered him from the intrigues of that fickle and
turbulent prince, plunged him into the deepest distress; and the King of
Navarre, a professed Hugonot, being next heir to the crown, the duke of
Guise took thence occasion to revive the catholic league, and to urge
Henry, by the most violent expedients, to seek the exclusion and
suppression of that brave and virtuous prince. Henry himself, tho' a
zealous catholic, yet, because he declined complying with their precipitant
measures, became an object of aversion to the league; and as his zeal in
practising all the superstitious observances of the Romish church,
was accompanied with a very licentious conduct in private life, the catholic
faction, in contradiction to the most vulgar experience, embraced thence the
pretext of representing his devotion as mere hypocrisy and deceit. Finding
his authority to decline, he was obliged to declare war against the Hugonots,
and to put arms into the hands of the League, whom, both on ac∣count of their
dangerous pretensions at home, and their close alliance with Philip, he
secretly regarded as his more dangerous enemies. Constrained by the same
po∣licy, he perceived the danger of associating himself with the revolted
protestants in the Low Countries, and was obliged to renounce that inviting
occasion of re∣venging himself for all the hostile intrigues and
enterprizes of Philip.</P>
<P>THE States, reduced to this extremity, sent over a solemn
embassy to London, and made offer to the Queen, of acknowleging her for
their sovereign, on con∣dition of obtaining her protection and
assistance. Elizabeth's wisest counsellors were very much divided
in opinion, in regard to the conduct which she should hold in this critical
and important emergence. Some advised the rejecting the offer of the States,
and represented the imminent dangers, as well as injustice, attending the
acceptance of them. They said, that the rebellion of subjects was the
common cause of all sovereigns, and the encouragement of a revolt in the
Flemish, might prove the example to a like pernicious practice in the
English: <PB N="585" REF="190"/> That tho' princes were bound by the laws of
the Supreme Being, not to oppress their subjects, the people never were
entitled to forget all duty to their sovereign, or transfer, from every fancy
or disgust, or even from the justest ground of complaint, their
obedience to any other master: That the Queen, in the succours hitherto
afforded the Flemings, had considered them as labouring under
oppres∣sion, not as entitled to freedom; and had intended only to
admonish Philip not to persevere in his tyranny, without any view of
ravishing from him these pro∣vinces, which he enjoyed by hereditary right
from his ancestors: That her situa∣tion in Ireland, and even in England,
would afford that powerful monarch suffi∣cient opportunity of retaliating
upon her; and she must henceforth expect, that, instead of secretly
somenting faction, he would openly employ his whole force in the protection
and defence of the catholics. That the pope would undoubtedly unite his
spiritual arms to the temporal ones of Spain; and that the Queen would soon
repent her making so small and precarious an acquisition in foreign
countries, by exposing her own dominions to such imminent danger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 507. Bentivoglio, partz. lib. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OTHER counsellors of Elizabeth maintained a contrary opinion.
They as∣serted, that the Queen had not even from the beginning of her
reign, but cer∣tainly had not at present, the choice, whether she would
embrace friendship or hostility with Philip: That by the whole tenor of
that prince's conduct it ap∣peared, that his sole aims were, the extension
of his empire, and the utter ex∣termination of the protestants, under the
specious pretence of maintaining the ca∣tholic faith: That the provocations
which she had already given him, joined to this general scheme of policy,
would for ever render him her implacable enemy; and as soon as he had
subdued his revolted subjects, he would undoubtedly fall, with the whole
force of his united empire, on her defenceless state: That the only
question was, whether she would maintain a war, abroad and supported by
allies, or wait till the subjection of all the confederates of England,
should give her enemies leisure to begin their hostilities in the bowels
of that kingdom: That the revolted provinces, tho' in a declining condition,
possessed still considerable force; and by the assistance of
England, by the advantages of their situation, and by their inveterate
antipathy to Philip, might still be enabled to maintain the contest
against the Spanish monarchy: That their maritime power, united to the
Queen's would give her entire security on that side from which alone she
could be assaulted, and would even enable her to make inroads on Philip's
dominions, both in Europe and the Indies: That a war which was necessary,
could never be unjust; and self-defence was concerned, as well in warding
certain dangers at a distance, as in repelling any immediate invasion: And
that since hostility with <PB N="586" REF="191"/> Spain was the unavoidable
consequence of the present interests and situations of the two
monarchies, it was better to compensate that danger and loss by the
ac∣quisition of such important provinces to the English empire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, ibid. Bentivoglio, ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMIDST these opposite councils, the Queen, apprehensive of
the consequences attending each extreme, was inclined to steer a middle
course; and tho' such con∣duct is seldom prudent, she was not, in this
resolution, guided by any prejudice or affection. She was determined not to
see, without opposition, the total ruin of the revolted provinces, whose
interests she esteemed so closely connected with her own: But
foreseeing, that the acceptance of their sovereignty would engage her to
employ her whole force in their defence, would give umbrage to her neigh∣bours,
and would expose her to the reproach of ambition and usurpation,
impu∣tations which she had hitherto carefully avoided, she immediately rej
cted this offer. She concluded a league with the States on the following
conditions: That she should send over an army to their assistance,
of five thousand foot and a thou∣sand horse, and pay them during the war;
that the general, and two others, whom she should appoint, should be
admitted into the council of the States; that neither party should make peace
without the consent of the other; that her expences should be refunded
after the conclusion of the war; and that the towns of Flushing and the
Brille, with the castle of Rammekins, should, in the mean time, be
consigned into her hands, by way of security.</P>
<P>THE Queen knew that this measure would immediately engage her
in open hostilities with Philip; yet was she not terrified with the view of
the present greatness of that ambitious, and enterprizing monarch. The
continent of Spain was at that time rich and populous; and the late addition of
Portugal, besides securing internal tranquillity, had annexed an opulent
kingdom to Philip's dominions, had made him master of many settlements in
the East-Indies, and of the whole commerce of those regions, and had
mightily increased his naval power, in which he was before chiefly deficient.
All the princes of Italy, even the pope and the court of Rome, were reduced to
a kind of subjection under him, and seemed to possess their
sovereignty on very precarious and uncertain terms. The Austrian branch in
Germany, with all their dependant principalities, was closely connected with
him, and was ready to supply him with troops for every enter∣prize. The whole
treasures of the West Indies were in his possession; and the
present scarcity of the precious metals in every country of Europe,
rendered the inssuence of his riches the more forcible and extensive. The
Netherlands seem∣ed on the point of relapsing into servitude; and small
hopes were entertained of <PB N="587" REF="192"/> their withstanding those
numerous and veteran armies which, under the command of the most experienced
generals, he employed against them. Even France, which used to
counterballance the Austrian greatness, had lost all her force from
intestine commotions; and as the catholics, the ruling party, were closely
con∣nected with him, he rather expected thence an augmentation, than a
diminution, of his power. Upon the whole, such prepossessions were
every where entertained concerning the force of the Spanish monarchy, that
the King of Sweden, when he heard that Elizabeth had openly embraced the
defence of the revolted Flem∣ings, scrupled not to say, that she had now
taken the diadem from her head, and had adventured it upon the doubtful chance
of war<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>. Yet was this princess
ra∣ther cautious than enterprizing in her natural temper: She ever needed more
to be impelled by the vigour, than restrained by the prudence of her
ministers: But when she saw an evident necessity, she braved danger
with magnanimous courage; and trusting to her own consummate wisdom, and
to the affections, however di∣vided, of her people, she prepared herself to
resist, and even to assault, the whole force of the catholic
monarch.</P>
<P>THE earl of Leicester was sent over to Holland, at the head
of the English auxiliary forces. He carried with him a splendid retinue;
being accompa∣nied with the young earl of Essex, his son in-law, the
lords Audley and North, Sir William Russel, Sir Thomas Shirley, Sir Arthur
Basset, Sir Walter Waller. Sir Gervase Clifton, and a select troop of
five hundred gentlemen. He was re∣ceived, on his arrival at Flushing, by his
nephew, Sir Philip Sidney, the go∣vernor; and every town thro' which he
passed, expressed their joy by acclama∣tions, and triumphal arches, as
if his presence, and the Queen's protection, had brought them the most
certain deliverance. The States, desirous of engaging Elizabeth still
farther in their defence, and knowing the interest which Leicester
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ssed with her, conserred on
him the title of governor and captain-general of the United Provinces,
appointed a guard to attend him, and treated him, in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> respects, as their
sovereign. But this step had a contrary effect to what they expected. The
Queen was displeased with the artifice of the States,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Leicester. She
reprimanded both of them very severely by l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tters and it was with some difficulty, that, after many humble
submissions, they were able to appease her.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> AMERICA was regarded as the chief
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ource of Philip's power, as will
as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oll desenceless part of
his dominions; and Elizabeth finding that an
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reach with that monarch was
unavoidable, resolved not to leave him unmolested on that 
<PB N="588" REF="193"/> quarter. The great success of the Spaniards and
Portugueze in both Indies had excited a spirit of emulation in England; and
as the success of commerce, still more of planting colonies, is slow
and gradual, it was happy, that a war, in this critical age, had opened a more
flattering prospect to the avarice and ambition of the Eng∣lish, and had
tempted them, by the view of sudden and exorbitant profit, to en∣gage in
naval enterprizes. A fleet of twenty sail was equipped to attack the
Spa∣niard in the West-Indies: Two thousand three hundred volunteers,
besides sea∣men, engaged on board of it: Sir Francis Drake was appointed
admiral; Chris∣topher Carlisle commander of the land forces. They took St.
Jago, near Cape Verde, by surprize; and found in it plenty of provisions,
but no riches. <MILESTONE N="1586" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 January.</NOTE> They sailed to
Hispaniola; and easily making themselves master of St. Domingo by
as∣sault, obliged the inhabitants to ransom their houses by a sum of
money. Cartha∣gena fell next into their hands, after some more
resistance, and was treated in the same manner. They burned St. Anthony
and St. Helens, two towns on the coast of Florida. Sailing along the coast
of Virginia, they found the small remains of a colony which had been planted
there by Sir Walter Raleigh, and which had gone extremely to decay. This was
the first attempt of the English to form such set∣tlements; and tho'
they have since surpassed all European nations, both in the
situations of their colonies, and in the noble principles of liberty and
industry, on which they are founded; they had here been so
unsuccessful, that the mise∣rable planters abandoned their settlements,
and prevailed on Drake to carry them with him to England. He returned with so
much riches as encouraged the vo∣lunteers, and with such accounts of the
Spanish weakness in those countries as served extremely to inflame the
spirits of the nation to future enterprizes. The great mortality which the
climate had produced in his fleet, was, as is usual, but a feeble restraint
on the avidity and sanguine hopes of young adventurers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 509.</NOTE>. It is thought that Drake's fleet first
introduced the use of tobacco into England.</P>
<P>THE enterprizes of Leicester were much less successful
than those of Drake. This man possessed neither courage nor capacity,
equal to the trusts reposed in him by the Queen; and as he was the only bad
choice whom she made for any considerable advancement, men naturally
believed, that she had here been influ∣enced by an affection still more
partial than that of friendship. He gained at first some advantage in an
action against the Spaniards; and threw succours into Grave, by which that
place was enabled to make a vigorous defence: But the cowardice of the
governor, Van Hemert, rendered all these efforts useless. He capitulated
after a very feeble resistance; and being tried for his conduct, suffered
a capital punishment from the sentence of a court martial. The prince of
Par∣ma <PB N="589" REF="194"/> next undertook the siege of Venlo, which was
surrendered to him, after some resistance. The fate of Nuys was more
dismal; being taken by assault, while the garrison was treating of a
capitulation. Rhimberg, which was garrisoned by twelve hundred English,
under the command of colonel Morgan, was afterwards besieged by the
Spaniards; and Leicester, thinking himself too weak to attempt raising
the siege, endeavoured to draw off the prince of Parma by forming some
other enterprize. He first attacked Doesberg, and succeeded: He then
sat down before Zutphen, which the Spanish general thought so important a
place, that he hastened to its relief. He made the marquess of Guasto
advance with a convoy, which he intended to throw into the place. They were
favoured by a fog; but falling by chance on a body of English cavalry, a
furious action ensued, in which the Spaniards were worsted, and the
marquess of Gonzaga, an Italian nobleman of great reputation and family, was
slain. The pursuit was stopt by the advance of the prince of Parma with
the main body of the Spanish army; and the English cavalry, on their return
from the field, found their advantage more than compen∣sated by the loss of
Sir Philip Sidney, who, being mortally wounded in the ac∣tion, was carried off
by the soldiers, and soon after died. This person is de∣scribed by the
writers of that age as the most perfect model of an accomplished gentleman
which was ever formed even by the wanton imagination of poetry or fiction.
Virtuous conduct, polite conversation, heroic valour, and elegant erudition,
all concurred to render him the ornament and delight of the English court;
and as the credit which he possessed with the Queen and the earl of
Lei∣cester, was wholly employed in the encouragement of genius and
literature, his praises have been transmitted with advantage to
posterity. No person was so low as not to become an object of his
humanity. After this last action, while he was lying on the field, mangled
with wounds, a bottle of water was brought him to relieve his thirst; but
observing a soldier near him in a like miserable condition, he said,
<HI>This man's necessity is still greater than mine:</HI> And resigned
to him the bottle of water. The King of Scots, struck with admiration of
Sidney's virtue, celebrated his memory by a copy of Latin verses, which he
composed on occasion of the death of that young hero.</P>
<P>THE English, tho' a long peace had deprived them of all
experience, were strongly possessed of military genius; and the
advantages gained by the prince of Parma were not attributed to the superior
bravery and discipline of the Spaniards, but solely to the misconduct of
Leicester. The States were much discontented with his management of the
war; but still more with his arbitrary and imperious conduct; and at the end
of the campaign, they applied to him for a redress of <PB N="590" REF="195"/>
all their grievances. But Leicester, without giving them any satisfaction,
de∣parted soon after for England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 512.
Bentivoglio, part 2. lib. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen, while she provoked so powerful an enemy as the
King of Spain, was not forgetful to secure herself on the side of
Scotland; and she endeavoured both to cultivate the friendship and alliance
of her kinsman, James, and to re∣move all grounds of quarrel between them. An
attempt which she had made some time before, was not well calculated to
gain the confidence of that prince. She dispatched Wotton as her
ambassador to Scotland; but tho' she gave him pri∣vate instructions
with regard to her affairs, she informed James, that when she had any
political business to discuss with him, she would employ another
minister▪ that this man was not fitted for serious negociations; and
that her chief purpose in sending him, was to entertain the King with witty
and facetious conversation, and to partake without reserve of his
pleasures and amusements. Wotton was master of profound
dissimulation, and knew how to cover, under the appearance of a careless
gaiety, the deepest designs, and most dangerous artifices. When but a
youth of twenty, he had been employed by his uncle, Dr. Wotton, ambas∣sador
in France during the reign of Mary, to ensnare the constable, Montmo∣rency;
and had not his purpose been frustrated by pure accident, his cunning had
prevailed over all the caution and experience of that aged minister. It is no
wonder, that, after years had so much improved him in all arts of deceit, he
should gain an ascendent over a young prince, of so open and unguarded a
temper as James, especially when the Queen's recommendation prepared the way
for his artifices. He was admitted into all the pleasures of the King; made
himself ma∣ster of all his secrets; and had so much the more authority
with him in political transactions, that he did not seem to pay the least
attention or regard to these mat∣ters. The Scotch ministers, who observed
the growing interest of this man, en∣deavoured to acquire his friendship;
and scrupled not to sacrifice to his intrigues the most essential
interests of their master. Elizabeth's usual jealousies with re∣gard to
her heirs began now to be levelled against James; and as that prince had a
tained the years proper for marriage, she was apprehensive, lest, by
being strengthened with children and alliances, he should acquire the
greater interest and authority with her English subjects. She directed
Wotton to form a secret con∣cert with some Scotch nobleman, and to procure
their promise, that James, during three years, should not, on any account,
be permitted to marry. In consequence of this view, they endeavoured to
embroil him with the King of Denmark, who had sent ambassadors to
Scotland, under pretence of demanding the restitution of the 
<PB N="591" REF="196"/> Orkneys, but really with a view of opening a proposal
of marriage between James and his daughter. Wotton is said to have employed
his intrigues to purposes still more dangerous. He formed a conspiracy
with some malecontents, to seize the per∣son of the King, and to deliver
him into the hands of Elizabeth, who would pro∣bably have denied all
concurrence in the design, but who would have been care∣ful to retain him in
perpetual thraldom, if not captivity. The conspiracy was discovered, and
Wotton fled hastily from Scotland, without taking leave of the King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>JAMES'S situation obliged him to dissemble his
resentment of this traiterous attempt, and his natural temper inclined him
soon to forgive and forget it. The Queen found no difficulty to renew the
negociations for a strict alliance between Scotland and England; and the more
effectually to gain the prince's affections, she granted him a pension,
equivalent to his claim on the inheritance of his grandmother the countess of
Lenox, lately deceased<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p.
351.</NOTE>. A league was formed between Elizabeth and James, for mutual
defence of their dominions, and of their religion, now menaced by the open
combination of all the catholic powers of Europe. It was stipulated, that if
Elizabeth was invaded, James should aid her with a body of two thousand
horse and five thousand foot; that Elizabeth, in a like case; should
send to his assistance three thousand horse and six thousand
foot; that the charge of these armies should be defrayed by the prince who
demanded assistance; that if the invasion should be made upon
England, within sixty miles of the frontiers of Scotland, this latter kingdom
should march its whole forces to the assistance of the former; and that
the present league should supercede all former alliances of either
state with any foreign kingdom, so far as religion was concerned<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 349. Camden, p. 513. Rymer, tom. XV. p.
803.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY this league James secured himself against all attempts
from abroad, opened a way for acquiring the confidence and affection of the
English, and might en∣tertain some prospect of domestic tranquillity,
which, so long as he lived on bad terms with Elizabeth, he could never expect
long to enjoy. Besides the turbulent disposition, and inveterate feuds of
the nobility, ancient maladies of the Scotch government, the spirit of
fanaticism had introduced a new disorder; so much the more dangerous,
that religion, when corrupted by false opinion, is not restrained by any
rules of morality, and is even searcely to be accounted for in its
operati∣ons, by any principles of ordinary conduct and policy. The insolence
of the Scotch preachers, who triumphed in their dominion over the populace,
had, at <PB N="592" REF="197"/> this time, reached an extreme height; and they
carried their arrogance so far, not only against the King, but against
the Parliament, and the whole civil power, that they dared to excommunicate the
archbishop of St. Andrews, because he had been active for promoting a law
which restrained their seditious sermons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 345, 346.</NOTE>: Nor could that prelate save
himself any way from this terrible sentence, but by re∣nouncing all
pretensions to ecclesiastical authority. One Gibson said in the
pulpit, that captain James Stuart (meaning the late earl of Arran) and his
wife, Jeza∣bel, had been esteemed the chief persecutors of the church; but
it was now seen, that the King himself was the great offender: And for this
crime the preacher denounced against him, the curse which fell on Jeroboam,
that he should die childless, and be the last of his race<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 344.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE secretary, perceiving the King so much molested with
ecclesiastical affairs, and with the refractory disposition of the
clergy, advised him to leave them to their own courses: For that in a
short time they would become so intolerable, that the people would rise
against them, and chace them out of the country. 
<Q REND="inline">"True," replied the King: "If I purposed to
undo the church and religion, your counsel were good: But my intention is to
maintain both; therefore cannot I suffer the clergy to follow such a

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE dangers which arose from the character, principles, and
pretensions of the Queen of Scots, had engaged, very early, Elizabeth to
consult, in her treatment of that unfortunate princess, the dictates of
jealousy and politics, <PB N="593" REF="198"/> rather than of friendship or
generosity: The resentment of this usage had pushed Mary into
enterprizes, which had very nearly threatened the repose and authority of
Elizabeth: The rigour and restraint, which were thence redoubled upon the
captive Queen<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 139. Haynes, p.
607.</NOTE>, still impelled her to attempt greater extremities; and while her
impa∣tience of confinement, her revenge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mary's extreme
animosity against Elizabeth may easily be conceived, and broke out, about
this time, in an incident, which may appear curious. While the former Queen was
kept in custody by the earl of Shrewsbury, she lived during a long time
in great intimacy with the countess; but that lady, entertaining jealousy
of an amour between her and the earl, their friendship was converted into
enmity; and Mary took a method of revenge, which at once gratified her spite
against the countess and that against Elizabeth. She wrote to the Queen,
informing her of all the malicious scandalous stories, which, she said,
the countess of Shrewsbury had reported of her: That Elizabeth had given a
promise of marriage to a certain person, whom she afterwards often
admitted to her bed: That she had been equally indulgent to Simier, the
French agent, and to the duke of Anjou: That Hatton was also one of her
paramours, who was even disgusted with her excessive love and
fondness: That tho' she was on other occasions avaritious to the last
degree, as well as ungrateful, and kind to very few, she spared no expence
in gratifying her amorous passions: That notwithstanding her licentious
amours, she was not made like other women; and all those who courted her
marriage would in the end be disappointed: That she was so conceited of
her beauty, as to swallow the most extravagant flattery from her courtiers,
who could not, on these occasions, forbear even sneering at her for her
folly: That it was usual for them to tell her, that the lustre of her
beauty dazled them like that of the sun, and they could not be∣hold it with a
fixed eye: She added, that the countess had said, that Mary's best policy
would be to engage her son to make love to the Queen; nor was there any
danger that such a proposal would be taken for mockery; so ridiculous was
the opinion which she had entertained of her own charms. She pretended, that
the countess had represented her as no less odious in her temper than
prostigate in her manners, and absurd in her vanity: That she had so
beaten a young woman of the name of Scudamore as to break that lady's finger;
and in order to cover over the matter, it was pretended, that the accident had
proceeded from the fall of a candlestick: That she had cut another across
the hand with a knife, who had been so unfortunate as to offend her. Mary
added, that the countess had informed her, that Elizabeth had suborned
Rolstone to pretend friendship to her, in order to debauch her, and thereby
throw in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amy on her rival. See
Murden's State Papers, p. 558. This imprudent and malicious letter was wrote a
very little before the detection of Queen Mary's conspiracy; and contributed,
no doubt, to render the proceedings against her more rigorous. How far all
these imputations against Elizabeth can be credited, may perhaps appear
doubtful: But her extreme fondness for Leicester, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tton, and Easex, not to mention Mountjoy and others,
with the curious passages between her and admiral Say mour, contained in
Haynes, render her cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity very
suspicious. Her self conceit with regard to beauty, we know from other
undoubted authority, to have been extravagant. Even when she was a very old
woman, she allowed her counters to flatter her with regard to her
<HI>excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Birch, vol
II p. 442, 443. Her passionate temper may also be proved from many lively
instance ; and it was not unusual with her to beat her maids of honour. See
the Sydney Papers, vol. II. p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.
The blow the gave to Essex before the privy council is another instance.
Had this Queen been both in a private station, she would not have been very
amiable: But her absolute authority, at the same time that it gave an
uncontroled swing to her violent passions, enabled her to compensate
for her infirmities by many great and signal virtues.</NOTE>, and her high
spirit concurred with religious <PB N="594" REF="199"/> zeal, and the
suggestions of desperate bigots, she was at last engaged in
designs, which afforded her enemies, who waited for the opportunity, a
pretext or reason for effectuating her final ruin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeal of the catholics.</NOTE> THE English
seminary at Rheims had wrought themselves up to a high pitch of rage and
animosity against the Queen. The recent persecutions, from which they had
fled: The new rigours, which, they knew, awaited them in the course of their
missions: The liberty which for the present they enjoyed of declaim∣ing
against that princess: And the contagion of religious fury, which every
where surrounded them in France: All these causes had obliterated with
them every maxim of common sense, and every principle of morals or
humanity. Intoxi∣cated with admiration of the omnipotence and infallibility of
the pope, they re∣vered his bull by which he excommunicated and deposed the
Queen; and some of them had gone to that height of extravagance, as to
assert, that that perfor∣mance had been immediately dictated by the Holy
Ghost. The assassination of heretical sovereigns, and of that
princess in particular, was represented as the most meritorious of all
enterprizes; and they taught, that whoever perished in such pious attempts
enjoyed without dispute the glorious and never-fading crown of martyrdom. By
such doctrines, they instigated John Savage, a man of des∣perate courage,
who had served some years in the Low Countries under the prince of Parma,
to attempt the life of Elizabeth; and this assassin, having made a vow
to persevere in his design, was sent over to England, and recommended to
the confidence of the more zealous catholics.</P>
<P>ABOUT the same time, John Ballard, a priest of that
seminary, had returned to Paris from his mission in England and Scotland;
and as he had discovered a spirit of mutiny and rebellion very prevalent
among the catholic devotees in these countries, he had founded on that
disposition the project of dethroning Eli∣zabeth, and of restoring by
force of arms the exercise of the antient religion in England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Murden's State Papers, p. 517.</NOTE>. The situation of affairs
abroad seemed favourable to this enterprize: The pope, the Spaniard, the duke
of Guise, the prince, created by the pope duke, of Parma, concurring in
interests, had formed a resolution to make some at∣tempt upon the Queen:
And Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador at Paris, strongly encouraged
Ballard to hope for succours from these princes. Charles Paget alone, a
zealous catholic and a devoted partizan of the Queen of Scots, being well
ac∣quainted with the prudence, vigour, and general popularity of Elizabeth,
al∣ways <PB N="595" REF="200"/> maintained, that so long as that princess
was allowed to live, it was in vain to expect any success from an
enterprize upon England. Ballard, persuaded of this truth, saw more clearly
the necessity of executing the design, formed at Rheims: He came over to
England in the disguise of a soldier, and assumed the name of captain
Fortescue: And he bent his endeavours to effectuate at once the project of an
assassination, an insurrection and an invasion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 515.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Babington's conspiracy.</NOTE> THE first
person, to whom he addressed himself, was Anthony Babington of Dothic
in the county of Derby. This young gentleman was of a good fa∣mily,
possessed a plentiful fortune, had discovered an excellent capacity,
and was accomplished in literature beyond most of his years or station.
Being zealously devoted to the catholic communion, he had secretly made a
journey to Paris some time before; and had fallen into intimacy with Thomas
Morgan, a bigotted fugitive from England, and with the bishop of Glasgow,
Mary's ambassador to the court of France. By continually extolling the
amiable accomplishments and heroical virtues of that princess, they
inflamed the unguarded mind of young Babington to make some attempt for her
service; and they employed every prin∣ciple of ambition, gallantry, and
religious zeal to give him a contempt of those dangers, which attended any
enterprize against the vigilant government of Eli∣zabeth. Finding him well
disposed for their purpose, they sent him back to England, and
secretly, unknown to himself, recommended him to the Queen of Scots as a
person worth engaging in her service. She wrote him a letter, full of
friendship and confidence; and Babington, sanguine in his temper and
zealous in his principles, thought, that these advances now bound him in
honour to de∣vote himself entirely to the service of that unfortunate
princess. During some time, he had found means of conveying to her all her
foreign correspondence; but after she was put under the custody of Sir
Amias Paulet, and reduced to a more rigorous confinement, he experienced so
much difficulty and danger in rendering her this service, that he had
desisted from every attempt of that nature.</P>
<P>WHEN Ballard began to open his intentions to Babington, he found
his zeal suspended, not extinguished: His former ardour revived on the
mention of any enterprize, which seemed to promise success in the
cause of Mary or of the ca∣tholic religion. He had entertained, however,
sentiments conformable to those of Paget, and represented the solly of
all attempts, which, during the life-time of Elizabeth, could be formed
against the established religion and government of England. Ballard,
encouraged by this hint, proceeded to discover to him the design undertaken
by Savage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. State Trials, p. 111.</NOTE>; and was
pleased to observe, that, instead of <PB N="596" REF="201"/> being
shocked with that project, Babington only thought it not secure enough,
when entrusted to one single hand, and proposed to join four others with
Savage in this desperate and bloody enterprize.</P>
<P>IN prosecution of these views, Babington employed himself
in augmenting the number of his associates; and he secretly drew into the
conspiracy many catholic gentlemen, discontented with the present
government. Barnwel, of a noble family in Ireland, Charnoc, a gentleman of
Lancashire, and Abington, whose father had been cofferer to the houshold,
readily undertook the assassination of the Queen. Charles Tilney the
heir of a very antient family, and Titchborne of Southampton, when the design
was proposed to them, expressed some scruples, which were at last
removed by the arguments of Babington and Ballard. Savage alone refused for
some time to share the glory of the enterprize with any others<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 111.</NOTE>; he challenged
the whole to himself; and it was with some difficulty he was in∣duced to
depart from this preposterous ambition.</P>
<P>THE delivery of the Queen of Scots, at the very same
instant, when Eliza∣beth should be assassinated, was requisite
for effecting the purpose of the conspi∣rators; and Babington undertook,
with a party of an hundred horse, to attack her guards, while she should
be taking the air on horseback. In this enterprize, he engaged Edward
Windsor, brother to the lord of that name, Thomas Salisbury, Robert Gage,
John Travers, John Jones, and Henry Donne; most of them men of family and
interest. The conspirators much wanted, but could not find, any nobleman of
name, whom they might place at the head of their enterprize; but they
trusted, that the great events, of the Queen's death and Mary's delivery,
would rouze all the zealous catholics to arms; and that foreign forces, taking
ad∣vantage of the general confusion, would easily fix the Queen of Scots on
the throne, and re-establish the antient religion.</P>
<P>THESE desperate projects had not escaped the vigilance of
Elizabeth's council, particularly of Walsingham, secretary of state. That
artful minister had engaged Maud, a catholic priest, whom he retained in
pay, to attend Ballard in his jour∣ney to France, and had thereby got a hint of
the designs, entertained by the fu∣gitives. Polly, another of his spies,
had found means to insinuate himself among the conspirators in England;
and tho' not entirely trusted, had obtained some in∣sight into their
dangerous secrets. But the bottom of the conspiracy was never fully known,
till Gifford, a seminary priest, came over, and made a tender of his
service to Walsingham. By his means, the discovery became of the utmost
importance, <PB N="597" REF="202"/> and involved the fate of Mary, as well as of
those zealous partizans of that princess.</P>
<P>BABINGTON and his associates, having laid such a scheme,
as, they thought, promised infallible success, were impatient to
communicate the design to the Queen of Scots, and to obtain her approbation
and concurrence. For this service, they employed Gifford, who immediately
applied to Walsingham, that the interest of that minister might forward
his secret correspondence with Mary. Walsingham proposed the matter to
Paulet, and desired him to connive at Gifford's corrupt∣ing one of his
servants: But Paulet was averse to the introducing such a perni∣cious
precedent into his family, and desired, that they would rather think of
some other expedient. Gifford found a brewer, who supplied the family with
ale; and bribed him to convey letters to the captive Queen. The letters, by
Paulet's connivance, were thrust thro' a chink in the wall; and answers
were returned by the same conveyance.</P>
<P>BALLARD and Babington were at first diffident of Gifford's
fidelity; and to make trial of him, they gave him only blank papers made up
like letters: But find∣ing by the answers, that these had been faithfully
delivered, they laid aside all farther scruple, and conveyed by his hands
the most criminal and dangerous parts of their conspiracy. Babington
informed Mary of the design laid for a fo∣reign invasion, the plan of an
insurrection at home, the scheme for her delivery, and the conspiracy for
assassinating the usurper, by six noble gentlemen, as he termed
them, all of them his private friends, who, from the zeal, which they bore to
the catholic cause and her majesty's service, would undertake the
tragical execution. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary assents to the conspi∣racy.</NOTE>
Mary replied, that she approved highly of the design, that the gentle∣men
might expect all the rewards, which it should ever be in her power to
con∣ler, and that the death of Elizabeth was a requisite circumstance,
before any at∣tempts were made either for her own delivery or an
insurrection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p 135. Camden, p.
515</NOTE>. These letters, with others to Mendoza, Charles Paget, the
archbishop of Glasgow, and Sir Francis Ingelfield, were carried by Gifford
to secretary Walsingham; were de∣cyphered by the art of Philips, his clerk;
and copies taken of them. Walsing∣ham employed a new artifice, in order to
obtain full insight into the plot: He subjoined to a letter of Mary's a
postscript in the same cypher; in which he made her desire Babington to
inform her of the names of the six conspirators. The indiscre∣tion of
Babington furnished Walsingham with still another means of detection as
well as of defence. That gentleman had made a picture be drawn, where he
himself was represented standing amidst the six assassins;
and a motto was subjoined, ex∣pressing, that their common perils were the
band of their consederacy. A copy <PB N="598" REF="203"/> of this picture was
brought to Elizabeth, that she might know the assassins, and guard
herself against their approach to her person.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, Babington, anxious to ensure and hasten the
foreign succours, resolved to dispatch Ballard into France; and he
procured for him, under a feigned name, a licence to travel. In order to remove
from himself all suspicion, he applied to Walsingham, pretended great
zeal for the Queen's service, offered to go abroad, and promised to employ
that confidence, which he had gained among the catholics, to the detection and
disappointment of their conspiracies. Wal∣singham commended his loyal
purposes; and promising his own council and as∣sistance in the
execution of them, still fed him with hopes, and maintained a close
correspondence with him. A warrant, meanwhile, was issued for seizing
Ballard; and this incident, joined to the consciousness of guilt, begot
in all the conspirators the utmost anxiety and concern. Some advised that
they should immediately make their escape: Others proposed, that Savage
and Charnoc should without delay execute their purpose against Elizabeth;
and Babington, in prosecution of this scheme, furnished Savage with
money, that he might buy good cloaths, and have thereby the more easy
access to the Queen's person. Next day, they began to apprehend, that they
had taken the alarm too hastily; and Babington, having renewed his
correspondence with Walsingham, was persuaded by that subtle
minister, that the seizure of Ballard had proceeded entirely from the
usual diligence of informers in the detection of popish and seminary
priests. He even consented to take secretly lodgings in Walsingham's
house, that they might have more frequent conferences together, before his
intended departure for France: But observing, that he was watched and
guarded, he made his escape, and gave the alarm to the other conspirators.
They all took to flight, covered themselves with several disguises, and
lay concealed in woods or barns; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conspira∣tors seized and
executed.</NOTE> but were soon discovered and thrown into prison. In
their examinations, they contradicted each other; and the leaders were obliged
to make a full confession of the truth. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> Fourteen were condemned and
executed: Of whom, seven acknow∣leged the crime on their trial; the rest
were convicted by evidence.</P>
<P>THE lesser conspirators being dispatched, measures
were taken for the trial and conviction of the Queen of Scots; on whose
account, and by whose concurrence, all these attempts had been made
against the life of the Queen, and the tranqui∣lity of the kingdom. Some of
Elizabeth's counsellors were averse to this proce∣dure; and thought, that
the close confinement of a woman, who was become very sickly, and who would
probably put a speedy end to their anxiety by her natural death, might give
sufficient security to the government, without attempting a measure of
which there scarcely remains any example in history. Leicester
ad∣vised, <PB N="599" REF="204"/> that Mary should be secretly
dispatched by poison; and he sent a divine to convince Walsingham of
the lawfulness of that action: But Walsingham de∣clared his abhorrence of
it; and insisted still, in conjunction with the majo∣rity of the
counsellors, for the open trial of the Queen of Scots. The situation of
England, and of the English ministers had, indeed, been hitherto not a
little dangerous. No successor of the crown was declared; but the heir of
blood, to whom the people in general were likely to adhere, was, by education,
an ene∣my to the national religion; was, from multiplied injuries, an enemy to
the mi∣nisters and principal nobility: And their personal safety, as well
as the security of the government, seemed to hang alone on the Queen's
life, who was now some∣what advanced in years. No wonder, therefore, that
Elizabeth's counsellors, knowing themselves to be so obnoxious to the
Queen of Scots, endeavoured to push every measure to extremity against
her; and were even more anxious than the Queen herself, to prevent her from
ever mounting the throne of England.</P>
<P>THO' all England was acquainted with the detection of
Babington's conspiracy, every avenue to the Queen of Scots was so
strictly guarded, that she remained in utter ignorance of the whole matter;
and it was a great surprize to her, when Sir Thomas Gorges, by Elizabeth's
orders, informed her, that all her partizans were discovered and arrested.
He chose the time for giving her this intelligence, when she was mounted on
horseback to go a hunting; and she was not permitted to return to her
former place of abode, but was conducted from one gentleman's house to
another, till she was landed in Fotheringhay castle in the county of
Northampton, which it was determined to make the last stage of her trial
and sufferings. Her two secretaries, Nau, a Frenchman, and Curle, a Scot,
were immediately arrested: All her papers were seized, and sent up to the
council: Above sixty different keys to cyphers were discovered: There were
also found many letters from persons beyond sea; and several too from
English noblemen, containing expressions of respect and attachment. The
Queen took no notice of this last discovery; but the persons
themselves, knowing their correspondence to be detected, thought that they
had no other method of making atonement for their imprudence, than declaring
themselves thenceforth the most inveterate enemies to the Queen of
Scots<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 518.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolution to try the Queen of
Scots.</NOTE> IT was resolved to try Mary, not by the common statutes of
treason, but by the act which had passed the former year, with a view to
this very event; and the Queen, in terms of that act, appointed a
commission, consisting of forty noble∣men and privy-counsellors, and
empowered them to examine and pass sentence on <PB N="600" REF="205"/> Mary,
whom she denominated the late Queen of Scots, and heir to James the fifth of
Scotland. The commissioners came to Fotheringhay castle, and sent to
her Sir Walter Mildmay, Sir Amias Paulet, and Edward Barker, who delivered her
a letter from Elizabeth, informing her of the commission, and of the
ap∣proaching trial. Mary received the intelligence without any commotion or
asto∣nishment. She said, however, that it seemed strange to her, that
the Queen should command her, as a subject, to submit to a trial and
examination before subjects: That she was an absolute independant
princess, and would yield to no∣thing which might derogate either from her
royal majesty, from the state of so∣vereign princes, or from the dignity
and rank of her son: That, however op∣pressed by misfortunes and
calamities, her spirits were not yet so much broke, as her enemies
flattered themselves; nor would she, on any account, be accessary to
her own degradation and dishonour: That she was ignorant of the laws and
sta∣tutes of England; was utterly destitute of council; and could not
conceive who were intitled to be called her peers, or could legally sit as
judges on her trial: That tho' she had lived in England for many years, she
had lived in captivity; and not having received the protection of the laws,
she could not, merely by her involuntary residence in the country, be
supposed to have subjected herself to their jurisdiction and
authority: That notwithstanding the superiority of her rank, she was
willing to give an account of her conduct before an English Parliament; but
could not view these commissioners in any other light, than as men
appointed to justify, by some colour of legal proceeding, her condemnation
and execution: And that she warned them to look to their conscience and
their character, in trying an innocent person; and to reflect, that these
transactions would some∣where be subject to revision, and that the
theatre of the whole world was much wider than the kingdom of England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The commis∣sioners prevail on her to
sub∣mit to the trial.</NOTE> IN return, the commissioners sent a new
deputation, informing her, that her plea, either from her royal dignity or from
her imprisonment, could not be ad∣mitted; and that they were empowered to
proceed against her, even tho' she should refuse to appear before them.
Burleigh, the treasurer, and Bromley, the chancellor, employed much
reasoning to make her submit to the trial; but the person whose
arguments had the chief influence, was Sir Christopher Hatton,
vice-chamberlain. His speech was to this purpose. 
<Q REND="inline">"You are accused, Ma∣dam," said he, "but not
condemned, of having conspired the destruction of our Lady and Queen
anointed. You say, you are a Queen: But, in such a crime as this, and
such a situation as yours, the royal dignity itself, neither by the civil
nor canon law, nor by the law of nature or of nations, is exempt from judgment.
If you be innocent, you wrong your reputation in avoiding <PB N="601" REF="206"/> a trial. We have been present at your protestations of
innocence; but Queen Elizabeth thinks otherwise; and is heartily sorry for
the appearances which lie against you. To examine, therefore, your cause,
she has appointed com∣missioners, honourable persons, prudent and
upright men, who are ready to hear you with equity, and even with favour, and
will rejoice if you can clear yourself of the imputations which have been
thrown upon you. Believe me, Madam, the Queen herself will rejoice, who
affirmed to me at my departure, that nothing which ever befel her, had given
her so much uneasiness, as that you should be suspected of a
concurrence in these criminal enterprizes. Lay∣ing aside, therefore, the
fruitless claim of privilege from your royal dignity, which can now avail you
nothing, trust to the better defence of your inno∣cence, make it appear in an
open trial, and leave not upon your memory that stain of infamy which must
attend your obstinate silence on this occasion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>BY this artful speech, Mary was persuaded to appear before
the court; and thereby gave an appearance of legal procedure to the trial, and
prevented those difficulties, which the commissioners must have fallen
into, had she persevered in maintaining so specious a plea as that of
her sovereign and independant character. Her conduct in this particular
must be regarded as the more imprudent, that for∣merly, when Elizabeth's
commissioners pretended not to exercise any jurisdiction over her, and
only entered into her cause by her own consent and approbation, she
declined justifying herself, when her honour, which ought to have been
dearer to her than life, seemed absolutely to require it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The trial.</NOTE> ON her first appearance
before the commissioners, Mary, either sensible of her imprudence, or
still unwilling to degrade herself by submitting to a trial, renewed her
protestation against the authority of her judges: The chancellor answered
her by pleading the supreme authority of the English laws over every one
who resided in England: And the commissioners accommodated matters, by
ordering both her protestation and his answer to be recorded.</P>
<P>THE lawyers of the crown then opened the charge against the
Queen of Scots. They proved, by intercepted letters, that she had allowed
cardinal Allen and others to treat her as Queen of England; and that she had
kept a correspon∣dence with lord Paget and Charles Paget, in a view of
engaging the Spaniards to invade the kingdom. Mary seemed not a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xious to clear herself from either of
these imputations. She only said, that she could not hinder others from
using what style they pleased in writing to her; and that it was lawful
for her to em∣ploy every expedient for the recovery of her liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="602" REF="207"/> AN intercepted letter of her's to Mendoza
was next produced; in which she pro∣mised to transfer to Philip her right
to the kingdom of England, if her son should refuse to be converted to
the catholic faith; an event, she said, of which there was no expectation,
while he remained in the hands of his Scotch subjects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 138.</NOTE>. Even this part of the
charge, she took no pains to deny, or rather she seemed to ac∣knowledge
it. She said, that she had no kingdoms to dispose of; yet was it
law∣ful for her to give at her pleasure what was her own, and she was not
accountable to any for her actions. She added, that she had formerly rejected
that proposal from Spain, but now, since all her hopes in England were
gone, she was fully determined not to refuse foreign assistance.
There was also produced evidence to prove, that Allen and Parsons were at
that very time negotiating by her or∣ders in Rome the conditions of
transferring her English crown to the King of Spain, and of disinheriting
her heretical son<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Canden, p. 525. This
evidence was that of Curle, her secretary, whom she allowed to be a very
honest man; and who as well as Nau, had given proofs of his integrity, by
keeping so long such important secrets, from whose discovery he could
have reaped the greatest profit. Mary, after all, thought that she had so
little reason to complain of Curle's evidence, that she took care to have
him paid a considerable sum by her testament, which she wrote the day
before her death. Coodal, vol. I. p. 413. Neither did she forget Nau, tho'
less satisfied with his conduct. Id. Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that Mary's prejudices against her son
were, at this time, carried so far, that she had even entered into a
conspiracy against him, had ap∣pointed lord Claude Hamilton regent of
Scotland, and had instigated her adhe∣rents to seize the King's person
and deliver him into the hands of the pope or the King of Spain; whence he was
never to be delivered but on the condition of his becoming catholic<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>The detail of this conspiracy is to be found in a letter
of the Queen of Scots to Charles Paget, her great consident. This letter is
dated the 20th of May 1586, and is contained in Dr.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s ma∣nuscript collections, at present in the
possession of lord Royston. It is a copy attested by Curle, Mary's
secretary, and indorsed by lord Burleigh. What proves its authenticity
beyond question is, that we find in Murden's Collection, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>10, that Mary actually wrote that
very day a letter to Charles Pag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t:
And further, she mentions, in the manuscript letter, a letter of Charles
Paget's of Charles Paget's of the 10th of April: New we find by Murden, p. 500,
that Charles Paget did actually write her a letter of that date.</P> 
<P>This violence of spirit is very consistent with Mary's
character. Her maternal affection was too weak to oppose the gratification of
her passions, particularly her pride, her ambition, and her bigotry. Her
son, having made some fruitless attempts to associate her with him in
the title, and having found this s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me impracticable, on
account of the prejudices of his protestant subjects, at last
desisted from that design, and entered into an alliance with England,
without comprehending his mother. She was in such a rage at this undutiful
behaviour, as she imagined it, that she wrote to Queen Elizabeth, that
she no longer cared what became of him or her in the world; the greatest
satisfaction she could have before her death was to see him and all his
adherents become a signal example of tyranny, ingratitude and impiety, and
undergo the vengeance of God for their wickedness. She would sind in
Christer∣dom other heirs, and doubted not to put her inheritance in such
hands as would retain the firmest hold of it. She cared not, after taking
this revenge, what became of her body: The quickest death would then be the
most agreeable to her. And she assured her, that, if he persevered,
she would disown him for her son, would give him her malediction, would
disinherit him, as well of his present posses∣sions as of all he
could expect by her; abandoning him not only to her subjects to treat him as
they had done her, but to all strangers to subdue and conquer him. It was
in vain to employ menaces against her: The fear of death or other misfortune
would never induce her to make one step or pro∣nounce one syllable beyond
what she had determined: She would rather perish with honour, in
main∣taining the dignity, to which God had raised her, than degrade herself
by the least pusillanimity, or act what was unworthy of her station and
of her race. Murden, p. 566. 567.</P> 
<P>James said to Courcelles, the French ambassador, that
he had seen a letter under her own hard, where she threatened to
disinherit him, and said that he might betake him to the lordship of
D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ley: For that was all he had by
his father. <HI>Counceller' Letter, a MS. of D. Camp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI>

<P><PB N="603" REF="208"/> THE only part of the charge, which Mary
positively denied, was her concur∣rence in the design of
assassinating Queen Elizabeth: This article indeed was the most
heavy, and the only one, which could fully justify the Queen in proceeding to
extremities against her. In order to prove the accusation, there were
pro∣duced the following evidence: Copies taken in secretary Walsingham's
office of the intercepted letters between her and Babington, in which her
approbation of the murder was clearly expressed; the evidence of her two
secretaries, Nau and Curle, who had sworn, without being put to any
torture, that she both received these letters from Babington, and that they
had wrote the answers by her order; the confession of Babington, that he
had wrote the letters and received the an∣swers<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 113.</NOTE>; and the confession of
Ballard and Savage, that Babington had showed them these letters of Mary,
wrote in the cypher, which had been settled between them.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that this seeming complication of evidence
resolves itself finally into the testimony of the two secretaries, who
alone were acquainted with their mistress's concurrence in Babington's
conspiracy, and who knew themselves ex∣posed to all the rigours of
imprisonment, torture and death, if they refused to give any evidence,
which might be required of them. In the case of an ordi∣nary 
<PB N="604" REF="209"/> criminal, this proof, with all its disadvantages,
would be esteemed legal, and even satisfactory, if not opposed by some
other circumstances, which shake the credit of the witnesses: But on
the present trial, where the absolute power of the prosecutor concurred
with such important interests and such a strong incli∣nation to have
the princess condemned; the testimony of two witnesses, even tho' men
of character, ought to be supported by very strong circumstances, in
order to remove all suspicion of tyranny and injustice. The proof
against Mary, it must be confessed, is not destitute of this
advantage; and it is very difficult, if not impossible, to account for
Babington's receiving an answer, wrote in her name, and in the cypher
concerted between them, without allowing, that the matter had been communicated
to that princess. Such is the light in which this matter appears, even after
time has discovered every thing, which could guide our judg∣ment with regard
to it: No wonder, therefore, that the Queen of Scots, unassisted by
council, and confounded by so extraordinary a trial, found herself
incapable of making a satisfactory defence before the commissioners. Her
reply consisted chiefly in her own denial: Whatever force may be in that
denial was much weakened, by her positively affirming, that she never had
had any correspondence of any kind with Babington; a fact, however, of which
there remains not the least question<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The volume of
State Papers collected by Mr. Murden, prove beyond controversy, that Mary was
long in close correspondence with Babington, p. 513, 516, 532, 533. She
entertained a like cor∣respondence with Ballard, Morgan, and Charles Paget,
and laid a scheme with them for an insur∣rection, and for the invasion of
England by Spain, p. 528, 531. The same papers show, that there had been a
discontinuance of Babington's correspondence, agreeable to Camden's
narration. See State Papers p 513, where Morgan recommends it to Queen Mary to
renew the correspondence with Babington. The former letters, which passed
between that Queen and Babington, seem to have been destroyed by some
accident. These circumstances prove, that no weight can be laid on Mary's
denial of guilt, and that her correspondence with Babington contained
particulars, which could not be avowed.</NOTE>. She asserted, that as Nau
and Curle had taken an oath of secrecy and fidelity to her, their evidence
against her ought not to be credited. She confessed, however, that Nau
had been in the service of her uncle, the cardinal of Lorraine, and had been
recommended to her by the King of France, as a man in whom she might safely
confide. She also acknowleged Curle to be a very honest man, but simple,
and easily imposed on by Nau. If these two men had received any letters,
or had wrote any answers, without her knowlege; the imputation, she said,
could never lie on her. And she was the more inclined, she added, to
enter∣tain this suspicion against them, that Nau had, in other
instances, been guilty of a <PB N="605" REF="210"/> like temerity, and had
ventured to transact business in her name, without com∣municating the
matter to her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>There are three suppositions, by which the letter to
Babington may be accounted for, without allowing Mary's concurrence in the
conspiracy for assassinating Elizabeth. The first is, that which
she seems herself to have embraced, that her secretaries had received
Babington's letter, and had ventured of themselves to answer it, without
communicating the matter to her: But it is utterly improbable, that a
princess of that sense and spirit would, in an affair of that
importance, be so treated by her ser∣vants, who lived in the house with
her, and who had every moment an opportunity of communicating the secret to
her. If the conspiracy failed, they must expect to suffer the
severest punishment from the court of England; if it succeeded, the
lightest punishment, which they could hope for from their own mistress,
must be disgrace, on account of their temerity. Not to mention, that Mary's
concur∣rence was in some degree requisite for effectuating the design of
her escape: It was proposed to attack her guards, while she was employed
in hunting: She must therefore concert the time and place with the
conspirators. The second supposition is, that these two secretaries
were previously traitors; and being gained by Walsingham, had made such a
reply in their mistress's cypher, as might involve her in the guilt of the
conspiracy. But these two men had lived long with the Queen of Scots, had
been entirely trusted by her, and had never fallen under suspicion either
with her or her partizans. Camden tells us, that Curle afterwards claimed a
reward from Walsingham on pretence of some promise; but Walsingham told
him, that he owed him no reward, and that he had made no discoveries on his
exa∣mination, which were not known with certainty from other quarters. The
third supposition is, that neither the Queen nor the two secretaries, Nau
and Curle, ever saw Babington's letter, or made any answer; but that
Walsingham, having decyphered the former, forged a reply. But this
supposition implies the falshood of the whole story, told by Camden, of
Gifford's access to the Queen of Scots's family, and Paulet's resusal to
concur in allowing his servants to be bribed. Not to mention, that as Nau's
and Curle's evidence must, on this supposition, have been extorted by
violence and terror, they would necessarily have been engaged, for their
own justification, to have told the truth afterwards; especially upon the
accession of James. But Camden informs us, that Nau, even after that event,
persisted still in his testimony.</P> 
<P>We must also consider, that the two last
suppositions imply such a monstrous criminal conduct in Walsingham,
and consequently in Elizabeth (for the matter could be no secret to her) as
exceeds all credibility. If we consider the situation of things and the
prejudices of the times, Mary's consent to Babington's conspiracy appears
much more natural and probable. She believed Elizabeth to be an usurper and a
heretic: She regarded her as a personal and a violent enemy: She knew that
schemes of assassinating heretics were very familiar in that age, and
generally approved of by the zealous ca∣tholics: Her own liberty and
sovereignty were connected with the success of this enterprize: And it
cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppear strange, that where
men of so much merit as Babington could be engaged, by bigotry alone, in so
criminal an enterprize, Mary, who was actuated by the same motive, joined to
so many others, should have given her consent to a scheme projected by
her friends. We may be previ∣ously certain, that, if such a scheme was
ever communicated to her, with any probability of success, she would
assent to it: And it served the purpose of Walsingham and the
English ministry to facilitate the communication of these schemes, as
soon as they had got an expedient sor intercepting her answer, and
detecting the conspiracy. Now Walsingham's knowlege of the matter is a
supposition necessary to account for the letter delivered to
Babington.</P> 
<P>As to the not punishing of Nau and Curle by Elizabeth, it
never is the practice to punish lesser criminals, who had given evidence
against the principal.</P> 
<P>But what should induce us to reject these three
suppositions, is, that they must, all of them, be con∣sidered as bare
possibilities: The partizans of Mary can give no reason for preferring
one to the other: Not the slightest evidence ever appeared to support any
one of them: Neither at that time, nor at any time after, was any reason
discovered, by the numerous zealots at home and abroad who had embraced
Mary's defence, to lead us to the belief os any of these three
suppositions; and even her apologists at present seem not to have
fixed on any choice among these supposed possibilities. The
positive proof of two credible witnesses, supported by the other very
strong circumstances, still remains unimpeached. Babington, who had an
extreme interest to have communication with the Queen of Scots, believed he
had found a means of correspondence with her, and had received an answer
from her: He, as well as the other conspirators, died in that belief: There
has not occurred, since that time, the least argument to prove they were
mistaken: Can there be any reason at present to doubt of the truth of
their opinion? Camden, tho' a profest apologist for Mary, is constrained
to tell the story in such a manner as evidently supposes her guilt.
Such was the impossibility of sinding any other consistent account,
even by a man of parts, who was a contemporary!</P> 
<P>In this light might the question have appeared even during
Mary's trial. But what now puts her guilt beyond all controversy is the
following passage of her letter to Thomas Morgan, dated the 27th of July
1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>86. 
<Q REND="inline">"As to Babington, he hath both kindly and
honestly offered himself and all his means to be employed any way I would.
Whereupon I hope to have satisfied him by two of my several letters,
since I had his; and the rather, for that I opened him the way, whereby I
received his with your aforesaid."</Q> Murden, p. 533. Babington
confessed, that he had offered her to as∣sassinate the Queen: It
appears by this, that she had accepted the offer: So that all the
suppositions of Walsingham's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gery, or her secretary's temerity or treachery, sall to the
ground.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE sole circumstance of her defence, which to us may appear
to have some force, was her requiring that Nau and Curle should be
confronted with her, and <PB N="606" REF="211"/> affirming that they never would
to her face persist in their evidence. But that de∣mand, however equitable,
was not supported by law in trials of high treason, and was often refused
even in other trials where the crown was prosecutor. The clause, contained
in an act of the 13th of the Queen, was a novelty; that the species of
treason there enumerated must be proved by two witnesses, confronted
with the criminal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The law of 5 &amp; 6 of Edward VI.
cap. 11. which required the confrontation of two witnesses for all
species of treason was repealed in the first of Mary.</NOTE>. But Mary
was not tried upon that act; and the ministers and crown lawyers of this
reign were always sure to refuse every indulgence beyond what the strict
letter of the law and the settled practice of the courts of justice
required of them. Not to mention, that these secretaries were not probably
at Fotherin∣gay during the time of the trial, and could not, upon Mary's
demand, be pro∣duced by the commissioners<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Queen Elzabeth was willing to have allowed Curle and Nau to be
produced in the trial, and writes to that purpose, to Burleigh and
Walsingham, in her letter of the 7th of October in Forber's MS. collections.
She only says, that she thinks it needles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, tho' she was willing to agree to it. The not consionting the
with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was not result of
design, but the practice of the age.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="607" REF="212"/> THERE passed two incidents in this
trial, which may be worth observing. A letter between Mary and Babington was
read, in which mention was made of the earl of Arundel and his brothers: On
hearing their names she broke into a sigh, 
<Q REND="inline">"Alas," said she, "what has that noble
house of the Howards suffered for my sake!"</Q> She affirmed, with regard
to the same letter, that it was easy to forge the hand-writing and cypher
of another; she was afraid, that this was too familiar a practice with
Walsingham, who, she also heard, had frequently prac∣tised both
against her life and her son's. Walsingham, who was one of the
com∣missioners, rose up when he heard this accusation. He protested,
that in his private capacity, he had never acted any thing against the Queen
of Scots: In his pub∣lic capacity, he owned, that his concern for his
sovereign's safety had made him very diligent in searching out, by every
expedient, all designs against her sacred person or her authority. For
attaining that end, he would not only make use of the assistance of
Ballard or any other conspirator: He would also reward them for betraying
their companions. But if he had tampered in any manner, unworthy of his
character and office, why did none of the late criminals either at their trial
or execution, accuse him of such practices? Mary endea∣voured to pacify him
by saying that she spoke from information; and she begged him, that he
would thenceforth give no more credit to such as standered her, than she
would to such as accused him. The great character indeed, which Sir Francis
Walsingham bears for probity and honour, should remove from him all
suspicion of such base arts as forgery and subornation; arts, which
even the most corrupt ministers in the most corrupt times would scruple
to employ.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25th October.</NOTE> HAVING finished the
trial, the commissioners adjourned from Fotheringay, and met in the
Star-Chamber at London; where, after taking the oaths of Mary's two
secretaries, who, voluntarily, without hope or reward, vouched the
authenticity of those letters before produced, they pronounced sentence of
death upon the Queen of Scots, and confirmed it by their seals and
subscriptions. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentence a∣gainst Mary.</NOTE> The same
day, a declaration was published by the commissioners and the judges, 
<Q REND="inline">"that the sentence did no way derogate from
the title and honour of James, King of Scotland; but that he was in the same
place, degree, and right, as if the sentence had never been pronounced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 526.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>THE Queen had now brought her affairs with Mary to that
situation, which she had long ardently desired; and had sound a
plausible reason for executing vengeance on a competitor, whom, from the
beginning of her reign, she had <PB N="608" REF="213"/> ever equally dreaded
and hated. But she was restrained from gratifying instantly her
resentment, by several important considerations. She foresaw the
invidious colours in which this example of uncommon jurisdiction would be
represented by the numerous partizans of Mary, and the reproach, to which
she herself might be exposed with all foreign princes, perhaps with all
posterity. The rights of hospitality, of kindred, and of royal majesty,
seemed in one signal instance to be all violated; and this sacrifice of
generosity to interest, of clemency to re∣venge, might appear equally
unbecoming a sovereign and a woman. Elizabeth, therefore, who was an
excellent hypocrite, pretended the utmost reluctance to proceed to the
execution of the sentence, affected the most tender sympathy with her
prisoner, displayed all her scruples and objections, rejected the
sollicitation of her courtiers and ministers, and affirmed, that, were
she not moved by the deepest concern for her people's safety, she would
not hesitate a moment in pardoning all the injuries, which she herself
had received from the Queen of Scots.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29th October.</NOTE> THAT the voice of her
people might be more audibly heard in the demand of justice upon Mary, she
summoned a new Parliament; and she knew, both from the usual
dispositions of that assembly, and from the influence of her
ministers over them, that she should not want the most earnest
sollicitation to consent to that measure, which was so agreeable to her
secret inclinations. She opened not this assembly in person, but
appointed for that purpose three commissioners, the chancellor Bromley,
the treasurer Burleigh, and the earl of Derby. The reason assigned for
this measure, was, that the Queen, foreseeing that the affair of the Queen
of Scots would be tried in Parliament, found her tenderness and delicacy so
much hurt by that melancholy incident, that she had not the courage to be
present while it was under deliberation, but withdrew her eyes from what
she could not behold without the utmost reluctance and uneasiness. She
was also willing, that, by this unusual caution, the people should see
the danger, to which her person was hourly exposed; and should thence be
more strongly incited to take vengeance on the criminal, whose restless
intrigues and bloody conspiracies had so long exposed her to the most
imminent perils<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 375.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament answered the Queen's expectations: The
sentence against Mary was unanimously ratisied by both houses; and an
application was agreed on to obtain Elizabeth's consent to its publication
and execution<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 379.</NOTE>. She gave
them an answer ambiguous, embarrassed; full of real artifice, and
seeming irre∣solution. She mentioned the extreme danger to which her life
was continually exposed; she declared her willingness to die, did she
not foresee the great cala∣mities, <PB N="609" REF="214"/> which would thence
fall upon the nation; she made professions of the greatest tenderness
to her people; she displayed the clemency of her temper, and expressed
her violent reluctance to proceed to extremity against her unhappy
kinswoman; she affirmed, that the late law, by which that princess was
tried, so far from being made to ensnare her, was only intended to give her
warning be∣forehand, not to engage in such attempts, as might expose her to
the penalties, with which she was thus openly menaced; and she begged them
to think once again, whether it was possible to find any other expedient
besides the death of the Queen of Scots for securing the public
tranquillity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 402, 403.</NOTE>. The
Parliament, in obedience to her commands, took the affair again under
deliberation; but could find no other possible expedient. They reiterated
their sollicitations and entreaties and arguments: They even remonstrated,
that mercy to the Queen of Scots was cruelty to them, her subjects and
children: And they affirmed, that it were injus∣tice to deny execution of the
law to any individual; much more, to the whole bo∣dy of the people, now
unanimously and earnestly suing for this pledge of her paren∣tal care and
tenderness. This second address set the pretended doubts and scruples
of Elizabeth anew in agitation: She complained of her own unfortunate
situa∣tion; expressed her uneasiness from their importunity; renewed
the professions of affection to her people; and dismissed the
committee of Parliament in an uncer∣tainty, what, after all this deliberation,
might be her final resolution<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>This Parliament granted the Queen a supply of a
subsidy and two fifteenths. They ad∣journed, and met again after the
execution of the Queen of Scots; when there passed some remark∣able
incidents, which it may be proper not to omit. We shall give them in the
words of Sir Simo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> D'Ewes, p. 410,
411, which are almost wholly transcribed from Townsend's Journal. On
Monday the 27th of February, Mr. Cope, first using some speeches
touching the necessity of a learned ministry
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the amendment of things
amiss in the ecclesiastical estate, offered to the house a bill and a
book written; the bill containing a petition, that it might be enacted, that
all laws now in force touching ecclesiastical government should be void:
And that it might be enacted that that book of common prayer now offered, and
none other, might be received into the church to be used. The book
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the form of prayer and
administration of the sacraments, with divers rite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and ceremonies to be hied in the church; and he
desired that the book might be read. Whereupon Mr. Speaker in effect us
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this speech: For that her
majesty before this time had commanded the house not to meddle with thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> matter, and that her majesty had
promised to take order in those causes, he doubted
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>withstanding, the house
desired the reading of it. Whereupon Mr. Speaker desired the clerk to read.
And the court being ready to read it, Mr. Dalton made a motion against the
reading of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saying that it
was not meet to be read, and it did appoint a new form of administration of
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and ceremonies of the church, to the discredit of the
book of common prayer and of the where
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and thought that this dealing
would bring her majesty's indignation against the house, thus to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>prize this
dealing with those things which her majesty especially had taken into her
own charge and direction. Whereupon Mr. Lewkenor spake, shewing the
necessity of preaching and of a learned ministry, and thought it very fit
that the petition and book should be read. To this purpose spake Mr.
Hurleston and Mr. Bainbrigg; and so, the time being passed, the house
broke up, and the petition nor book read. This done, her Majesty sent to
Mr. Speaker, as well for this petition and book, as for that other petition and
book for the like effect, that was delivered the last session of
Parliament, which Mr. Speaker sent to her majesty. On Tuesday the 28th of
February, her Majesty sent for Mr. Speaker, by occasion whereof the
house did not sit. On Wednesday the first day of March, Mr. Went∣worth
delivered to Mr. Speaker certain articles, which contained questions touching
the liberties of the house, and to some of which he was to answer, and
desired they might be read. Mr. Speaker desired him to spare his motion,
until her Majesty's pleasure was farther known touching the petition and
book lately delivered into the house; but Mr. Wentworth would not be so
satisfied, but required his articles might be read. Mr. Wentworth introduced
his queries by lamenting, that he as well as many others were deterred from
speaking by their want of knowlege and experience in the liberties of the
house; and the queries were as follows: Whether this council were not a place
for any member of the same here assembled, freely and without
controulment of any person or danger of laws, by bill or speech to utter
any of the griefs of this commonwealth whatsoever touching the service of
God, the safety of the prince and this noble realm? Whether that great honour
may be done unto God, and benefit and service unto the prince and state,
without free speech in this council that may be done with it? Whether there
be any council which can make, add, or diminish from the laws of the realm
but only this council of Parliament? Whether it be not against the orders of
this council to make any secret or matter of weight, which is here in hand
known to the prince or any other, concerning the high service of God, prince
or state, without the consent of the house? Whether the speaker or any
other may interrupt any member of this council in his speech used in this
house tending to any of the forenamed services? Whether the speaker may
rise when he will, any matter being propounded, without consent of the
house or not? Whether the speaker may over-rule the house in any matter
or cause there in question, or whether he is to be ruled or over-ruled in
any matter or not? Whether the prince and state can continue, and stand,
and be maintained without this council of Parliament, not altering the
government of the state? At the end of these questions, says Sir Simon
D'Ewes, I found set down this short note or memorial ensuing: By which it
may be perceived, both what serjeant Puc∣kering, the speaker, did with the
said questions after he had received them, and what became also of this
business, viz. 
<Q REND="inline">"These questions Mr. Puckering pocketed
up and shewed Sir Thomas Heneage, who so handled the matter, that Mr.
Wentworth went to the Tower, and the questions not at all moved. Mr. Buckler
of Essex herein brake his saith in forsaking the matter, &amp;c. and no
more was done"</Q> After setting down, continues Sir Simon D'Ewes, the said
business of Mr. Wentworth in the original journal book, there follows only
this short-conclusion of the day itself, viz. 
<Q REND="inline">"This day, Mr. Speaker being sent for to
the Queen's majesty, the house departed."</Q> On Thursday, the second
of March, Mr. Cope, Mr L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enor, Mr. Hurlston,
and Mr. Bainbrigg were sent for to my lord chan∣cellor and by divers of the
privy council, and from thence were sent to the Tower. On Saturday, the
fourth day of March, Sir John Higham made a motion to this house, for that
divers good and necessary members thereof were taken from them, that it
would please them to be humble petitioners to her majesty son the
ressitution of them again to the house. To which speeches Mr.
vice-chamberlain an∣swered, that it the gentlemen were committed for matter
within the compass of the privilege of this house, then there might be a
petition; but if not, then we should give occasion to her majesty's
farther displeasure: And therefore advised to stay until they heard
more, which could not be long: And farther, he said touching the book and the
petition, her majesty had for diverse good causes, best known to
herself, thought sit to suppress the same, without any farther
examination thereof; and yet thought it very unsit for her majesty to give
any account of her doings.—But whatsoever Mr. vice-chamber∣lain
pretended, it is most probable these members were committed for
intermeddling with matters touch∣ing the church, which her majesty had often
inhibited, and which had caused so much disputation and so many
meetings between the two houses the last Parliament."</P> 
<P>This is all we find of the matter in Sir Simon D'Ewes and
Townsend; and it appears that those mem∣bers, who had been committed, were
detained in custody till the Queen thought sit to release them. These
questions of Mr. Wentworth are curious; because they contain the first
faint dawnings of the present English constitution; tho' suddenly
eclipsed by the arbitrary government of Elizabeth. Went∣worth was indeed, by
his puritanism, as well as his love of liberty (for these two characters,
of such unequal merit, arose and advanced together) the true forerunner of
the Hambdens, the Pyms, and the Hollises, who, in the next age, with less
courage, because with less danger, rendered their principles so
triumphant. I shall only ask, whether it be not sufficiently clear from
all these transactions, that in the two succeeding reigns it was the
people who encroached upon the sovereign; not the sovereign
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho attempted, as is pretended, to
usurp upon the people?</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="610" REF="215"/> BUT tho' the Queen affected reluctance to
execute the sentence against Mary, she complied with the Parliament's
request to publish it; and the proclamation <PB N="611" REF="216"/> seemed
to be attended with the unanimous and hearty rejoicings of the people. The lord
Buckhurst, and Beale, clerk to the council, were sent to the Queen of
Scots, and notified to her the sentence pronounced against her, its
ratification by Parliament, and the earnest applications made for its
execution by that assembly, who thought, that their religion could never,
while she was alive, attain a full settlement and security. Mary was no
way dismayed at this intelligence: On the contrary, she joyfully laid hold
of the last circumstance mentioned to her; and insisted, that since
her death was demanded by the protestants for the establish∣ment of their
faith, she was really a martyr to her religion, and was intitled to all the
merits, attending that glorious character. She added, that the English had
often imbrued their hands in the blood of their sovereigns: No wonder, they
exercised cruelty towards her, who derived her descent from these
monarchs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 528.</NOTE>. Paulet, her keeper,
received orders to take down her canopy, and to serve her no longer with that
respect, due to sovereign princes. He told her, that she was now to be
considered as a dead person; and incapable of any dignity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 293</NOTE>. This insult she received without
any seeming emotion. She only replied, that she received her royal
character from the hands of the Almighty, and no earthly power was ever able to
bereave her of it.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots wrote her last letter to Elizabeth; full of
dignity, with∣out departing from that spirit of meekness and of charity,
which appeared suit∣able to this concluding scene of her unfortunate life.
She preferred no petition <PB N="612" REF="217"/> for averting the fatal
sentence: On the contrary, she expressed her gratitude to heaven for
thus bringing to a speedy period her sad and lamentable pilgrimage. She
requested some favours of Elizabeth, and entreated her, that she might be
beholden for them to her own goodness alone, without making applications to
those ministers, who had discovered such an extreme antipathy to her
person and her religion. She desired, that, after her enemies should be
satiated with her innocent blood, her body, which, it was determined,
should never enjoy rest, while her soul was united to it, might be
consigned to her servants, and be conveyed by them into France, there to
repose in a catholic land, with the sa∣cred relicts of her mother. In
Scotland, she said, the sepulchres of her ancestors were violated, and
the churches either demolished or profaned; and in England, where she might
be interred among the antient kings, her own and Elizabeth's progenitors, she
could entertain no hopes of being accompanied to the grave with those rites
and ceremonies, which her religion required. She desired that no one might
have the power of inflicting a private death upon her, without Eliza∣beth's
knowlege; but that her execution should be public, and attended with her
antient servants, who might bear testimony of her perseverance in the
faith, and of her submission to the will of heaven. She begged, that
these servants might afterwards be allowed to depart whither they
pleased, and might enjoy those legacies which she should leave them.
And she conjured her to grant these favours, by their near kindred, by the
soul and memory of Henry the seventh, the common ancestor of both, and by
the royal dignity of which they equally participated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 529. Jebb, vol. II. p. 295.</NOTE>. Elizabeth made no
answer to this letter; being unwilling to give Mary a refusal in her
present situation, and foreseeing inconveniencies from grant∣ing some
of her requests.</P>
<P>WHILE the Queen of Scots thus prepared herself to meet her
fate, great efforts were made by foreign powers with Elizabeth to prevent the
execution of the sentence, pronounced against her. Besides employing
L'Aubespine, the French resident at London, a man devoted to the house of
Guise, Henry sent over Bellievre, with a professed intention of
interceding for the life of Mary. The duke of Guise and the league, at that
time, threatened very nearly the King's authority; and Elizabeth knew, that,
tho' that monarch might, from decency and policy, think himself obliged to
interpose publicly in behalf of the Queen of Scots, he could not secretly
be much displeased with the death of a princess, on whose fortune and
elevation his mortal enemies had always founded so many da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing and ambitious projects<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 494.</NOTE>. It is even pretended, that
Bellievre <PB N="613" REF="218"/> had orders, after making public and vehement
remonstrances against the exe∣cution of Mary, to exhort privately the
Queen, in his master's name, not to defer an act of justice, so
necessary for their common interests<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du
Maurier.</NOTE>. But whether the French King's intercession was sincere
or not, it had no weight with the Queen; and she still persisted in her
former resolution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Interposition of King James</NOTE> THE
interposition of the young King of Scots, tho' it was not able to change
Elizabeth's determination, seemed, on every account, to merit more
atten∣tion. So soon as James heard of the trial and condemnation of his
mother, he sent William Keith, gentleman of his bed chamber, to London; and
wrote a letter to the Queen, in which he remonstrated, in very severe
terms, against the indignity of the procedure. He said, that he was
astonished to hear of the pre∣sumption of English noblemen and
councellors, who had dared to sit in judg∣ment and pass sentence upon a
Queen of Scotland, descended from the royal blood of England; but was still
more astonished to hear, that thoughts were seriously entertained of
putting that sentence in execution: That he entreated Elizabeth to reflect on
the dishonour, which she would draw on her name, by embruing her hands in
the blood of her near kinswoman, a person of the same royal dignity and
the same sex with herself: That in this unparalelled attempt, she
offered an affront to all diadems, and even to her own; and by reducing
so∣vereigns to a level with other men, taught the people to neglect all duty
towards those whom Providence had appointed to rule over them: That for his
part, he must esteem the injury and insult so enormous, as to be
incapable of all attone∣ment; nor was it possible for him thenceforth to
remain on any terms of corre∣spondence with a person, who, without any
pretence of legal authority, had de∣liberately inflicted an ignominious death
upon his parent: And that even if the sentiments of nature and duty did not
inspire him with this purpose of venge∣ance, his own honour required it of
him; nor could he ever acquit himself in the eyes of the world, if he did not
use every effort, and endure every hazard, to revenge so great an
indignity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 351.</NOTE>. Soon
after, James sent the master of Gray and Sir Robert Melvil to enforce the
remonstrances of Keith; and to employ with the Queen every expedient of
argument and menaces. Elizabeth was at first offended with sharpness of
these applications; and she replied in a like strain to the Scotch
ambassadors. When she afterwards reflected, that this earnestness was
no more than what duty required of James, she was pacified; but retained
still her resolution of proceeding to extremities against Mary<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 353.</NOTE>. It is believed, that the
master of Gray, gained by the enemies of that princess, gave secretly his
advice not to spare her, and undertook at all adventures to pacify his
master. <PB N="614" REF="219"/> The Queen also, from many circumstances,
was induced to pay small attention to the applications of James, and to
disregard all the efforts, which he could em∣ploy in behalf of his mother.
She was well acquainted with his character and interests, the factions which
prevailed among his people, and the inveterate hatred, which the zealous
protestants, particularly the preachers, bore to the Queen of Scots. The
present incidents put these dispositions of the clergy in a full light.
James, observing the fixed purpose of Elizabeth, ordered prayers to be
offered up for his mother in all the churches; and knowing the captious humour
of the ecclesiastics, he took care that the form of the petition should
be most cau∣tious, as well as humane and charitable: 
<Q REND="inline">"That it might please God to illumi∣nate Mary
with the light of his truth, and save her from the apparent danger with which
she was threatened."</Q> But excepting the King's own chaplains, and one
clergyman more, all the preachers refused to pollute their churches by
pray∣ers for a papist, and would not so much as prefer a petition for her
conversion. James, unwilling or unable to punish this disobedience, and
desirous of giving the preachers an opportunity of amending their fault,
appointed a new day when prayers should be said for his mother; and that he
might at least secure himself from any insult in his own presence, he
desired the archbishop of St. Andrews to preach before him. In order to
disappoint this purpose, the clergy instigated one Couper, a young man,
who had not yet received holy orders, to take pos∣session of the pulpit
early in the morning, and to exclude the prelate. When the King came to church,
and saw the pulpit occupied by Couper, he cal∣led to him from his seat, and
told him, that the place was destined for another; yet since he was there,
if he would obey the charge given, and remember the Queen in his prayers, he
might proceed to divine service. The preacher replied, that he would do as
the spirit of God should direct him. This answer suffi∣ciently
instructed James in his purpose; and he commanded him to leave the pulpit:
As Couper seemed not disposed to obey, the captain of the guard went to
pull him from his place; upon which the young man cried aloud, that this day
would be a witness against the King in the great day of the Lord; and he
denounced a woe upon the inhabitants of Edinburgh for permitting him to be
treated in that manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 354.</NOTE>. The
audience at first appeared desirous to take part with him; but the sermon
of the prelate brought them over to a more dutiful and more humane
disposition.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, when sollicited, either by James or by foreign
princes, to pardon the Queen of Scots, seemed always determined to proceed to
extremities against her: But when her ministers urged her to interpose no
more delays in the execu∣tion, <PB N="615" REF="220"/> her scruples and her
hesitation returned; her humanity could not allow her to embrace such
violent and sanguinary measures; and she was touched with com∣passion
for the misfortunes, and with respect for the dignity of the unhappy
pri∣soner. The courtiers, sensible that they could do nothing more
acceptable to her, than to employ persuasion on this head, failed not to
enforce every motive for the punishment of the Queen of Scots, and to combat
all the objections urged against that act of justice. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for the execution of Mary.</NOTE>
They said, that the treatment of that princess in England had been, on her
first reception, such as sound reason and policy re∣quired; and if
she had been governed by principles of equity, she would not have refused
willingly to acquiesce in it: That the obvious inconveniencies, either of
allowing her to retire into France, or of restoring her by force to her
throne, in opposition to the protestants, and the English party in
Scotland, had obliged the Queen to detain her in England, till time should
offer some opportunity of serving her, without danger to the kingdom, or to
the protestant religion: That her usage had there been such as became her
rank; her own servants, in considerable numbers, had been permitted to
attend her; exercise had been allowed her for her health, and all access of
company for amusement; and these indulgencies would, in time, have been
carried farther, if by her subsequent conduct she had appeared worthy of
them: That after she had instigated the rebellion of Northumberland, the
conspiracy of Norfolk, the bull of excommunication of pope Pius, an
invasion from Flanders; after she had seduced the Queen's friends, and
incited every ene∣my, foreign or domestic, against her; it became
necessary to treat her as a most dangerous rival, and to render her
confinement more strict and rigorous: That the Queen, notwithstanding
these repeated provocations, had, in her favour, re∣jected the importunity of
her Parliaments, and the advice of her sagest mini∣sters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digges, p 276,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vol. II. p. 48, 135, 136,
1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE>; and was still, in
hopes of her amendment, determined to delay coming to the last extremity
against her: That Mary, even in this forlorn condition, retained so high
and unconquerable a spirit, that she acted as competitor to the crown, and
allowed her partizans every where, and in their very letters, address∣ed to
herself, to treat her as Queen of England: That she had carried her
animo∣sity so far as to encourage the atrocious design of
assassinating the Queen; and this crime was unquestionably proved
upon her, by her own letters, by the evi∣dence of her secretaries, and by the
dying confession of her accomplices▪ That she was but a titular
Queen, and at present possessed no where any right of sove∣reignty;
much less in England, where every one was subject to the laws, and to
Elizabeth, the only true sovereign: That even allowing her to be still the
Queen's equal in rank and dignity, self-defence was permitted by a law of
nature, <PB N="616" REF="221"/> which could never be abrogated; and every one,
still more a Queen, had suffi∣cient jurisdiction over an enemy, who by
open violence, and still more, who by secret treachery, threatned the
utmost danger against her life: That the general combination of the
catholics to exterminate the protestants, was no longer a se∣cret; and as
the sole resource of the latter persecuted sect lay in Elizabeth, so
the chief hope which the former entertained of final success, consisted
in the per∣son, and in the title of the Queen of Scots: That this very
circumstance brought matters to extremity between these princesses, and
rendering the life of the one the death of the other, pointed out to Elizabeth
the path, which either regard to self-preservation, or to the happiness
of her people, should direct her to follow: And that necessity, more
powerful than policy, thus demanded of the Queen, that resolution which
equity would authorize, and which duty prescribed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 533.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1587" UNIT="year"/> WHEN Elizabeth thought that as
many importunities had been used, and as much delay interposed, as decency
required, she was at last determined to carry the sentence into
execution: But even in this last resolution she could not proceed without
displaying a new scene of duplicity and artifice. In order to alarm the
vulgar, rumours were previously dispersed, that the Spanish fleet was
arrived in Milford Haven; that the Scots had made an irruption into England;
that the duke of Guise was landed in Sussex with a strong army; that
the Queen of Scots was escaped from prison, and had raised an army; that
the northern counties had begun an insurrection; that there was a new
conspiracy on foot to assassinate the Queen, and set the city of
London on fire; nay, that the Queen was actually assassinated<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. A criminal attempt of this nature was
even imputed to L'Aubes∣pine, the French ambassador; and that minister
was obliged to leave the king∣dom. The Queen, affecting to be in great terror
and perplexity, was observed to sit much alone, pensive and silent, and
sometimes to mutter to herself half sen∣tences, importing the difficulty
and distress to which she was reduced<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE>.
She at last called Davison, a man of parts, but easy to be imposed on,
and who had lately, for that very reason, been made secretary; and she
ordered him, to draw out secretly a warrant for the execution of the Queen of
Scots; which, she after∣wards said, she intended to keep by her, in
case any attempt should be made for the delivery of that princess. She
signed the warrant; and then commanded Da∣vison to carry it to the
chancellor, in ord r to have the seal affixed to it. Next day she sent
Killigrew to Davison, enjoining him to forbear some time executing her
former orders; and when Davison came and told her, that the warrant had
already passed the seals, she seemed to be somewhat moved, and
blamed him for his preci∣pitation. Davison, being in some perplexity,
acquainted the council with this <PB N="617" REF="222"/> whole transaction;
and they endeavoured to persuade him to send off Beale, clerk of the
council, with the warrant: If the Queen should be displeased, they
pro∣mised to justify his conduct, and to take on themselves the whole
blame of this measure<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">It appears by some
letters published by Strype, vol. III. book ii. c▪ 1. that Elizabeth had
not ex∣pressly communicated her intention to any of her ministers, not even
to Burleigh: They were such experienced courtiers, that they knew they could
not g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly her more than by serving her without waiting till

complied with the ad∣vice; and the warrant was dispatched to the earls of
Shrewsbury and Kent, and some others, ordering them to see the sentence
executed upon the Queen of Scots.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7th February.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The execu∣tion.</NOTE> THE two earls came to
Fotheringhay; and being introduced to Mary, inform∣ed her of their
commission, and told her to prepare for death next morning at eight
o'clock. She was no-wise dismayed, tho' somewhat surprized, with the
in∣telligence. She said, with a chearful, and even a smiling countenance,
that she did not think the Queen, her sister, would have consented to
her death, or have executed the sentence against a person who was not
subject to the laws and ju∣risdiction of England. 
<Q REND="inline">"But as such is her will," said she,
"death, which puts an end to all my miseries, shall be to me most
welcome; nor can I esteem that soul worthy the felicities of heaven, which
cannot support the body under the horrors of the last passage to
these blissful mansions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 534.

noblemen, that they would permit some of her servants, and particularly her
confessor, to attend her: But they told her, that compliance with this
last demand was contrary to their conscience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebb, vol. II. p. 302.</NOTE>, and that
Dr. Fletcher, dean of Peterborow, a man of great learning, should be
present, to instruct her in the principles of true religion. Her refusal
to have any conference with this divine inflamed the earl of Kent's zeal; and
he bluntly told her, that her death would be the life of their religion; as, on
the contrary, her life would have been the death of it. Mention being made of
Babington, she constantly denied his con∣spiracy to have been at all
known to her; and the revenge of her wrong, she re∣signed into the hands of
the Almighty.</P>
<P>WHEN the earls had left her she ordered supper to be
hastened, that she might have the more leizure to finish the few affairs
which remained to her in this world, and to prepare for her passage to
another. It was necessary for her, she said, to take some
sustenance, left a failure of her bodily strength should depress her
spi∣rits on the morrow, and lest her behaviour should thereby betray a
weakness un∣worthy of herself<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE>. She supped sparingly, as
her manner usually was; and her <PB N="618" REF="223"/> wonted chearfulness
did not even desert her on this occasion. She comforted her servants
under the affliction which overwhelmed them, and which was too pow∣erful for
them to conceal from her. Turning to Bourgoin, her physician, she asked
him, whether he did not remark the great and invincible force of truth. 
<Q REND="inline">"They pretend," said she, "that I must
die, because I conspired against the Queen's life: But the earl of Kent
avowed, that there was no other cause of my death, but the apprehensions,
which, if I should live, they entertain for their religion. My constancy in
the faith is my real crime: The rest is only a colour, invented by
interested and designing men."</Q> Towards the end of supper, she
called in all her servants, and drank to them: They pledged her, in order, on
their knees; and craved her pardon for any past neglect of their duty: She
deigned, in return, to ask their pardon for her offences towards them; and a
plentiful effusion of tears attended this last solemn farewel, and
exchange of mutual forgiveness<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II.
p. 302, 626. Camden, p. 531.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HER care of her servants was the sole remaining affair which
employed her concern in this world. She perused her will, in which she had
provided for them by legacies: She ordered the inventory of her goods, cloaths,
and jewels to be brought her; and she wrote down the names of those to whom
she bequeathed each particular: To some she distributed money with her
own hands; and she adapted the recompence to their different degrees of rank
and merit. She wrote also letters of recommendation for her servants to the
French King, and to her cousin the duke of Guise, whom she made the chief
executor of her testa∣ment. At her wonted time she went to bed, slept
some hours; and then rising, spent the rest of the night in prayer.
Having foreseen the difficulty of exercising the rites of her religion,
she had had the precaution to obtain a consecrated host from the hands of
pope Pius, and she had reserved the use of it for this last pe∣riod of
her life. By this expedient she supplied, as much as she could, the want
of a priest and confessor, who was refused her<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 489.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the morning she dressed herself in a rich habit
of silk and velvet, the only one which she had reserved to herself. She
told her maids, that she would willingly have left them this dress rather
than the plain garb which she wore the day before: But it was necessary
for her to appear at the ensuing solemnity in a de∣cent habit.</P>
<P>THOMAS Andrews, sheriff of the county, entered the room, and
informed her, that the hour was come, and that he must attend her to the
place of execu∣tion. She replied, that she was ready; and bidding adieu to
her servants, she leaned <PB N="619" REF="224"/> on two of Sir Amias
Paulet's guards, because of an infirmity in her limbs; and she followed the
sheriff with a serene and composed aspect. In passing thro' a hall
adjoining to her chamber, she was met by the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent,
Sir Amias Paulet, Sir Drue Drury, and many other gentlemen of distinction.
Here she also found Andrew Melvil, her steward, who flung himself on
his knees before her; and, wringing his hands, cried aloud: 
<Q REND="inline">"Ah! madam! unhappy me! What man was ever before
the messenger of such heavy tidings as I must carry, when I shall
return to my native country, and shall report, that I saw my gracious Queen
and Mistress beheaded in England?"</Q> His tears prevented further
speech; and Mary too felt herself moved, more from sympathy than
af∣fliction. 
<Q REND="inline">"Cease, my good servant," said she,
"cease to lament: Thou hast cause rather to rejoice than to mourn: For
now shalt thou see the troubles of Mary Stuart receive their long expected
period and determination."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Know," continued she, "good servant, that
all the world at best is vanity, and subject still to more sorrow than
a whole ocean of tears is able to bewail. But I pray thee, carry this
message from me, that I die a true woman to my religion, and unalterable in
my affections to Scotland and to France. Heaven forgive them, that have long
desired my end, and have thirsted for my blood as the hart panteth after
the water brooks."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"O God," added she, "thou that art the author
of truth and truth itself, thou knowest the inmost recesses of my
heart: Thou knowest, that I was ever desirous to preserve an entire union
between Scotland and England, and to obviate the source of all these fatal
discords. But recommend me, Melvil, to my son, and tell him, that
notwithstanding all my distresses, I have done nothing prejudicial to
the state and kingdom of Scotland."</Q> After these words, reclining
herself, with weeping eyes, and face bedewed with tears, she kissed
him. 
<Q REND="inline">"And so," said she, "good Melvil,
fare∣wel: Once again, farewel, good Melvil; and grant the assistance of
thy prayers to thy Queen and mistress<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MS. p. 4.
Jebb, vol. II. p. 631. Strype, vol III. p. 384.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>SHE then turned about to the noblemen who attended her, and made
a peti∣tion in behalf of her servants, that they might be well treated, that
they might be allowed to enjoy the presents which she had made them, and be
sent safely into their own country. Having received a favourable answer,
she moved another re∣quest, that they might be permitted to attend her at
her death: In order, said she, that their eyes may behold, and their hearts
bear witness, how patiently their Queen and mistress can bear her
execution, and how constantly she perse∣veres in her attachments to her
religion. The earl of Kent opposed this desire, and told her, that they
would be apt, by their speeches and cries, both to disturb 
<PB N="620" REF="225"/> herself and the spectators: He was also
apprehensive, lest they should practise some superstition, unmeet
for him to suffer; such as dipping their handkerchiefs in her blood: For
that was the instance which he made use of. 
<Q REND="inline">"My lord," said the Queen of Scots, "I will
give my word (altho' it be but dead) that they shall not incur any blame in
any of the actions which you have named. But alas! poor souls! it would be a
great consolation to them to bid their mistress farewel. And I hope,"
added she, "that your mistress, being a maiden Queen, would vouchsafe,
in regard of womanhood, that I should have some of my own people about me
at my death. I know, that her majesty hath not given you any such strict
command, but that you might grant me a request of far greater courtesy,
even tho' I were a woman of much inferior rank to that which I bear."</Q>
Finding that the earl of Kent persisted still in his refusal, her mind,
which had fortified itself against the terrors of death, was affected by
this circumstance of indignity, for which she was not prepared. 
<Q REND="inline">"I am cousin to your Queen," cried she, "and
descended from the blood-royal of Henry the seventh, and a married Queen of
France, and an anointed Queen of Scotland."</Q> The commissioners
perceiving how invidious their obstinacy would appear, con∣ferred a little
together, and agreed, that she might carry a few of her servants along with
her. She made choice of four men, and two maid-servants, for that
purpose.</P>
<P>SHE then passed into another hall, where was erected the
scaffold, covered with black; and she saw, with an undismayed
countenance, the two executioners, and all the preparations of death. The room
was crowded with spectators, and no one was so steeled against all
sentiments of humanity, as not to be moved, when he reflected on her royal
dignity, considered the surprizing train of her mis∣fortunes, beheld her
mild but inflexible constancy, recalled her amiable accom∣plishments, or
surveyed her beauties, which, tho' faded by years, and yet more by her
afflictions, still discovered themselves in this fatal moment. Here the
war∣rant for her execution was read to her; and during this ceremony she was
silent, but shewed, in her behaviour, an indifference and unconcern, as if
the business had no way regarded her. Before the executioners performed
their office, the dean of Peterborow stepped forth; and tho' the Queen
frequently told him, that he needed not concern himself about her, that she
was settled in the ancient catho∣lic and Roman religion, and that she meant
to lay down her life in defence of that faith; he still thought it his duty
to persist in his lectures and exhortations, and to endeavour her
conversion. He told her, that the Queen of England had in this moment shewn
a tender care of her; and notwithstanding the punishment justly to be
inflicted on her, for her manifold trespasses, was determined to use 
<PB N="621" REF="226"/> every expedient for saving her soul from that
destruction with which it was so nearly threatned: That she was now
standing upon the brink of eternity, and had no other means of escaping
endless perdition, but by repenting her former wickedness, by justifying
the sentence pronounced against her, by acknowleging the Queen's favours,
and by exerting a true and lively faith in Christ Jesus: That the
scriptures were the only rule of doctrine, the merits of Christ the only
means of salvation; and if she trusted in the inventions or devices of
men, she must expect in a moment to fall into utter darkness, into a
place where shall be weep∣ing, howling, and gnashing of teeth: That the
hand of death was upon her, the ax was laid to the root of the tree, the throne
of the great judge of heaven was erected, the book of her life was spread
wide, and the particular sentence and judgment was ready to be pronounced
upon her: And that it was now, during this important instant, in her choice,
either to rise to the resurrection of life, and hear that joyful
salutation, <HI>Come, ye blessed of my Father,</HI> or to share the
resur∣rection of condemnation, replete with sorrow and grief; and to
suffer that dread∣ful denunciation, <HI>Go ye cursed into everlasting
fire</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MS. p. 8, 9, 10▪ 11. Strype, vol. III.

<P>DURING this discourse the Queen could not forbear
sometimes betraying her im∣patience, by interrupting the preacher; and the
dean, finding that he had profited nothing by his lecture, at last bid her
change her opinion, repent her of her former wickedness, and settle her
faith upon this ground, that only in Christ Jesus could she hope to be
saved. She answered, again and again, with great earnestness: 
<Q REND="inline">"Trouble not yourself any more about the
matter: For I was born in this religion, I have lived in this religion, and in
this religion I am resolved to die."</Q> Even the two earls perceived, that
it was fruitless to harrass her any further with theological disputes;
and they ordered the dean to desist from his unseasonable exhortations,
and to pray for her conversion. During the dean's prayer, she employed
herself in private devotion from the office of the Virgin; and after he had
finished, she pro∣nounced aloud some petitions in English, for the
afflicted church, for an end of her own troubles, for her son, and for Queen
Elizabeth; and prayed God, that that princess might long prosper, and be
employed in his service. The earl of Kent observing, that in her devotions
she made frequent use of the crucifix, could not forbear reproving her, for
her attachment to that popish trumpery, as he termed it; and he exhorted her
to have Christ in her heart, not in her hand<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">MS. p. 15. Jebb, vol. II. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7, 491, 637.</NOTE>. She replied with presence of mind, that it
was difficult to hold such an object in her hand, without feeling her heart
touched with some compunction<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Jebb.
Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="622" REF="227"/> SHE now began, with the aid of her two
women, to disrobe herself; and the executioner also lent his hand, to
assist them. She smiled, and said, that she was not accustomed to
undress herself before so large a company, nor to be serv∣ed by such
valets. Her servants, seeing her in this condition, ready to lay her head
upon the block, burst into tears and lamentations: She turned about to them;
put her finger upon her lips, as a sign of imposing silence upon
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jebb, p. 307, 492.</NOTE>; and hav∣ing given them
her blessing, desired them to pray for her. One of her maids, whom she
had appointed for that purpose, covered her eyes with a handkerchief; she
laid herself down, without any sign of fear or trepidation; and her head
was severed from her body at two strokes by the executioner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary's cha∣racter.</NOTE> THUS died, in the
forty-sixth year of her age, and the nineteenth of her cap∣tivity in England,
Mary Queen of Scots; a princess of great accomplishments both of body of
mind, natural as well as acquired; but unfortunate in her life, and during one
period, very unhappy in her conduct. The beauties of her per∣son, and of her
air, combined to make her the most amiable of women; and the charms of her
address and conversation aided the impression which her lovely figure
made on the hearts of all beholders. Ambitious and active in her temper, yet
inclined to chearfulness and society; of a lofty spirit, constant and
even vehe∣ment in her purpose; yet polite, and gentle, and affable in her
demeanor; she seemed to partake only so much of the male virtues as to
render her estimable, with∣out relinquishing those soft graces which
compose the proper ornaments of her sex. In order to form a just idea of
her character, we must set aside one part of her con∣duct, while she
abandoned herself to the guidance of a profligate man; and must consider
these faults, whether we admit them to be imprudences or crimes, as the
result of an inexplicable, tho' not uncommon, inconstancy in the human
mind, of the frailty of our nature, of the violence of passion, and of the
influence which situ∣ations, and sometimes momentary incidents, have on
persons, whose principles are not thoroughly confirmed by experience and
reflection. Enraged by the ungrate∣ful conduct of her husband, seduced by
the treacherous counsels of one in whom she reposed confidence,
transported by the violence of her own temper, which never lay sufficiently
under the guidance of discretion; she was betrayed into ac∣tions, which
may, with some difficulty, be accounted for, but which admit of no apology,
nor even of alleviation. An enumeration of her qualities might carry the
appearance of a panegyric; an account of her conduct must, in some parts,
wear the aspect of a severe satire and invective.</P>
<P>HER numerous misfortunes, the solitude of her long and tedious
captivity, and the persecutions to which she had been exposed on account
of her religion, <PB N="623" REF="228"/> had wrought her up to a degree of
bigotry during her latter years; and such was the prevalent spirit and
principles of that age, that it is the less wonder, if her zeal, her
resentment and her interest uniting, induced her to give consent to a
design, which conspirators, actuated only by the first of these
motives, had formed against the life of Elizabeth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's affected sor∣row.</NOTE> WHEN
the Queen heard of Mary's execution, she affected the utmost surprize and
indignation. Her countenance changed, her speech faltered and failed her, and
for a long time, her sorrow was so deep that she could not express it,
but stood fixed, like a statue, in silence and mute astonishment.
After her grief was able to find vent, it burst out in loud wailings and
lamentations; she put herself into deep mourning for this deplorable event;
and she was seen perpetu∣ally bathed in tears, and surrounded only by her
maids and women. None of her ministers or councellors dared to approach her;
or if any assumed such te∣merity, she chaced them from her, with the
most violent expressions of rage and resentment: They had all of them
been guilty of an unpardonable crime, in put∣ting to death her dear sister
and kinswoman, contrary to her fixed purpose and intention<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 536. St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ype, vol. III. Appendix, p. 145.

sufficiently apprized and acquainted.</P>
<P>No sooner was her sorrow so much abated as to leave room
for reflection, than she wrote a letter of apology to the King of Scots, and
sent it by Sir Robert Cary, son to lord Hunsdon. She there told him, that
she wished he knew, but not felt, the unutterable grief of mind, she
experienced, on account of that lamentable accident, which, without her
knowlege, much less concurrence, had happened in England: That as her pen
trembled, when she attempted to write it, she found herself obliged to
commit the relation of it to the messenger, her kinsman; who would
likewise inform his majesty of every circumstance, which attended this
dismal and unlooked for misfortune: That she appealed to the Supreme Judge
of heaven and earth for her innocence; and was also so happy, amidst her
other afflictions, as to find, that many persons in her court could bear
witness to her veracity in this protestation: That she abhorred
hypocrisy and dissimulation, esteemed no∣thing more worthy of a prince
than a sincere and open conduct, and could never surely be esteemed so
base and poor-spirited, as that, if she had really given or∣ders for this
latal execution, she could, on any consideration, be induced to deny it:
That tho' she was sensible of the justice of the sentence, she was
determined from clemency never to carry it into execution; and could not but
resent the temerity of those, who on this occasion had disappointed her
intentions: And that as no one loved him more dearly than herself, or bore a
more anxious con∣cern <PB N="624" REF="229"/> for his welfare; she hoped, that
he would consider every one as his enemy, who endeavoured, on account of the
present incident, to excite any animosity between them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 536. Spotswood, p. 358.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order the better to appease James, she committed
Davison to prison, and ordered him to be tried in the Star-Chamber for his
misdemeanour. The secre∣tary was confounded; and being sensible of the
danger, which must attend his entering into a contest with the Queen, he
expressed penitence for his error, and submitted very patiently to be
railed at by those very counsellors, whose persuasion had induced him
to incur the guilt, and who had promised to countenance and protect him. He
was condemned to imprisonment during the Queen's pleasure, and to pay a
fine of ten thousand pounds. He remained a long time in prison; and the
fine, tho' it reduced him to want and beggary, was strictly levied upon him.
All the favour, which he could obtain from the Queen, was the sending him
small supplies from time to time, to keep him from perishing in
necessity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 538.</NOTE>. He privately
wrote an apology to his friend Walsingham, which contains many curious
particulars: The French and Scotch ambassadors, he said, had been
remonstrating with the Queen in Mary's behalf; and immediately after their
departure, she commanded him, of her own accord, to deliver her the warrant
for the execution of that princess. She signed it readily and or∣dered it
to be sealed with the great seal of England. She appeared in such good
humour on this occasion, that she said to him in a jocular manner, 
<Q REND="inline">"Go tell all this to Walsingham, who is now
sick: Tho' I fear he will die for sorrow, when he hears it."</Q> She added,
that, tho' she had so long delayed the execution, lest she should
seem to be actuated by malice or cruelty, she was all along sensible of
the necessity of it. In the same conversation, she blamed Drury and
Paulet, that they had not before eased her of this trouble; and she
expressed her desire that Walsingham would bring them to a compliance
in that particular. She was so bent on this purpose, that, some time
after, she asked Davison, whether any letter had come from Paulet with
regard to the service expected of him. Davison showed her Paulet's
letter; in which that gentleman flatly refused to act any thing
inconsistent with the principles of honour and justice. The Queen fell
into a passion, and accused Paulet, as well as Drury, of perjury, that,
having taken the oath of association, in which they had bound themselves
to avenge her wrongs, they had yet refused to lend their hand on this
occasion. 
<Q REND="inline">"But others," she said, "will be sound
less scrupulous."</Q> Davison adds, that nothing but the consent and
exhortations of the whole council could have engaged him <PB N="625" REF="230"/>
to send off the warrant. He was well aware of his danger, and remembered,
that the Queen, after having ordered the execution of the duke of Norfolk, had
endeavoured, in like manner, to throw the whole blame and odium of that ac∣tion
upon lord Burleigh<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. Strype, vol. III.

<P>ELIZABETH'S dissimulation was so gross, that it could
deceive no body who was not previously resolved to be blinded; but as
James's concern for his mo her was certainly more sincere and cordial, he
discovered the highest resentment, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> refused to admit Cary into his presence. He
recalled his ambassadors from
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> land; and seemed to breathe
nothing but war and vengeance. The States of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being assembled, entered
into the quarrel, and professed, that they
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ready to spend their lives
and sortenes in revenge of his mother's dea h, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> defence of his title to the
crown of England. Many of his nobility instigated i am to take arms: Lord
Sinclair, when the courtiers appeared in deep mourning, presented himself
to the King arrayed in compleat armour, and said, that that was the proper
mourning for the Queen. The catholics took the opportunity of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>rting James to ally himself with
the King of Spain, to lay imm diate claim to the crown of England, and to
prevent the danger, which, from his mother's example, he might conclude, would
certainly, if Elizabeth's power prevailed, overwhelm his person and his
kingdom. The Queen was s nsible of the danger attending these councils;
and, after allowing James some decent interval to vent his grief and anger,
she employed her emissaries to pacify him, and to set before him every
motive of hope or fear, which might induce him to live in peace and
friendship with her.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> WALSINGHAM wrote to lord Thirlstone, the Scotch
secretary of state, a very judi∣cious letter to the same purpose. He
said, that he was much surprized to hear of the violent resolutions taken
in Scotland, and of the passion discovered by a prince of so much
judgment and temper as James: That a war, founded merely on the principle of
revenge, and that too on account of an act of justice, which necessity
had extorted, would for ever be exposed to blame, and could not be excused
by any principles of equity or reason: That if these views were deemed
less mo∣mentous among princes, policy and interest ought certainly to be
attended to; and these motives did still more evidently oppose all
thoughts of a rupture with England, and all revival of expioded claims and
pretensions to the English throne: That the inequality between the two
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ived James of any hopes of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ss if he trusted merely to the
force of his own slate, and had no recourse to foreign powers for
assistance: That the objections, attending the introduction 
<PB N="626" REF="231"/> of succours from a more powerful monarch, appeared
so evident from all the transactions of history, that they could not
escape a person of the King's extensive knowlege; but there were in the
present case, several peculiar circumstances, which ought for ever to
prevent him from having recourse to so dangerous an expe∣dient: That the
French monarch, the antient ally of Scotland, might willingly use the
assistance of that kingdom against England; but would be displeased
to see the union of these two crowns on the head of James; an union, which
would ever after exclude him from all hopes of practicing that policy, formerly
so useful to France and so pernicious to the Scotch nation: That Henry,
besides, infested with fac∣tion and domestic war, was not in a condition
of supporting distant allies; much less, would he undergo any hazard or
expence, in order to aggrandize a near kins∣man to the house of Guise,
the most determined enemies of his repose and authority: That the
extensive power and exorbitant ambition of the Spanish monarch ren∣dered
him a still more dangerous ally to James; and as he evidently aspired to an
universal monarchy in the west, and had in particular advanced some
claims on England, as if he were descended from the house of Lancaster,
he was at the same time the common enemy of all princes, who desired to
maintain their li∣berty and independance; and the immediate rival and
competitor of the King of Scots: That the Queen, by her own naval power, and
her alliance with the Hol∣landers, would probably intercept all succours
which James might receive from abroad, and be enabled to decide the
controversy in this island with the superior forces of her own kingdom,
opposed to those of Scotland: That if the King revived his mother's
pretensions to the crown of England, he must also embrace her religion,
by which alone they could be justified; and must thereby undergo the infamy
of abandoning those principles, in which he had been strictly educated, and
to which he had hitherto religiously adhered: That as he would, by such an
apostacy, totally alienate all the protestants in Scotland and England, he
could never gain the confidence of the catholics, who would still entertain a
very rea∣sonable doubt of his honour and sincerity: That by advancing a
present claim to the crown, he forfeited the certain prospect of his
succession; and revived that national animosity, which the late peace
and alliance between the kingdoms had happily extinguished: That the whole
gentry and nobility of England had openly declared themselves for the
execution of the Queen of Scots; and if James showed such violent
resentment against that act of justice, they would be obliged, for their
own security, to prevent for ever so implacable and revengeful a prince
from ruling over them: And that, however some persons might represent his
honour as engaged to seek vengeance for the present affront and injury, the
true honour of a prince consisted in wisdom and moderation and justice,
not in fol∣lowing <PB N="627" REF="232"/> the dictates of blind passion, or
in pursuing revenge at the expence of every motive and every interest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>77. Spotswood.</NOTE> These
considerations, joined to the peaceable, unambitious temper of the young
prince, prevailed over his resentment; and he fell gradually into a good
correspondence with the court of England.</P>
<P>WHILE Elizabeth ensured tranquillity from the attempts of her
nearest neigh∣bour, she was not negligent of more distant dangers.
Hearing that Philip, while he seemed to dissemble the daily insults and
injuries, which he received from the English, was secretly preparing a
great navy to attack her; she sent Sir Francis Drake with a fleet to
intercept his supplies, to pillage his coast, and to destroy his
shipping. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Drake
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at Cadiz</NOTE> Drake carried
out four capital ships of the Queen's, and twenty-six, great and small,
with which the London merchants, in hopes of sharing in the plunder, had
supplied him. Having learned from two Dutch ships, whom he met in his
passage, that a Spanish fleet, richly laden, was lying at Ca∣diz, ready
to set sail for Lisbon, the rendezvous of the intended Armada; he bent
his course to the former harbour, and boldly, as well as fortunately, made an
attack on the enemy. He obliged six gallies, which made head against him,
to take shelter under the forts; he burned about an hundred vessels,
laden with ammunition and naval stores; and he destroyed a great ship of
the marquess of Santa Croce. Thence, he set sail for Cape St. Vincent,
and took by assault the castle situated on that promontory, with three
other strong holds. He next in∣sulted Lisbon; and finding, that the
merchants, who had engaged entirely in expectation of profit, were
discontented with these military enterprizes, he set sail for the
Tercera Islands, with an intention of lying in wait for a rich Carrack, which
was expected in these quarters. He was so fortunate as to meet with his
prize; and in this short expedition, where the public bore so small a
share, the adventurers were encouraged to attempt farther enterprizes, the
Eng∣lish seamen learned to despise the great unwieldy ships of the
enemy, the naval preparations of Spain were destroyed, the intended
expedition against England was retarded a twelvemonth, and the Queen had
thereby leizure to take more se∣cure measures against that formidable
invasion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p 54<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Sir William Monson▪

<P>THIS year Thomas Cavendish, a gentleman of Devonshire, who
had dissipated his estate by living at court, being resolved to repair
his fortune at the expence of the Spaniards, fitted out three ships at
Plymouth, one of an hundred and twenty tons, another of sixty, and a third of
forty; and with these small vessels he adventured into the South Seas,
and committed great depredations on the Spa∣niards. He took nineteen
vessels, some of which were richly laden; and re∣turning 
<PB N="628" REF="233"/> by the Cape of Good Hope, he came to England, and
entered the river in a kind of triumph. His mariners and soldiers were
cloathed in silk, his sails were of damask, his top-mast cloth of gold;
and his prize was esteemed the richest that ever had been brought into
England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> vol. I p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE land enterprizes of the English were not, during this
campaign, so ad∣vantageous or honourable to the nation. The important place
of Deventer was intrusted by Leicester to William Stanley, with a
garrison of twelve hundred Eng∣lish; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his gentleman, being a catholic,
was alarmed with the discovery of Babington's conspiracy, and became
apprehensive, lest every one of his religion should thenceforth be
treated with distrust in England. He entered into a corre∣spondence with
the Spaniards, betrayed the city to them for a sum of money, and engaged the
whole garrison to desert with him to the Spanish service. Ro∣land York,
who commanded a fort near Zutphen, imitated his example; and the Hollanders,
formerly disgusted with Leicester, and suspicious of the English,
broke out into loud complaints against the improvidence, if not the treachery
of his administration. Soon after, he arrived himself in the Low Countries;
but his conduct was no-wise calculated to give them satisfaction, or to
remove the suspicions, which they had entertained against him. The prince
of Parma having besieged Sluys, he attempted to relieve the place, first by
sea, then by land; but failed in both enterprizes, and as he ascribed his
bad success to the ill behaviour of the Hollanders, they were equally free
in reflections upon his conduct. The breach between them became wider every
day: They slighted his authority, op∣posed his measures, and neglected
his councils; while he endeavoured, by an im∣perious behaviour, and by
violence, to recover that influence, which he had lost by his imprudent and
ill concerted measures. He was even suspected by the Dutch of a design
to usurp upon their liberties; and the jealousy entertained against him,
began to extend towards the Queen herself. That princess had made some
advances towards a peace with Spain: A congress had been opened at Bourbourg,
a village near G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aveline: And tho'
the two courts, especially that of Spain, had no other intention than to
amuse each of them its enemy by negotiation, and mutua ly relax the
preparations for defence or assault, the Dutch, who were determined, on no
condition, to return under the Spanish yoke, became appre∣hensive lest
their liberty should be sacrificed to the political interests of
England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> part II. lib. 4. Strype, vol. IV.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>. But the Queen, who
knew the importance of her alliance with the slates in the present
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was resolved to give them
entire satisfaction by recalling
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> commanding him to resign his
government. Maurice, son to the <PB N="629" REF="234"/> prince of Orange, a
youth of twenty years of age, was elected by the states go∣vernor in his
place; and Peregrine lord Willoughby, was appointed by the Queen commander of
the English forces. The measures of these two generals were much
disturbed by the malignity of Leicester, who had left a faction behind him,
and who still attempted, by means of his emissaries, to disturb all the
operations of the slates. So soon as Elizabeth got intelligence of these
disorders, she took care to redress them, and she obliged all the
partizans of England to fall into una∣nimity with prince Maurice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XV p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>. But tho' her good sense so far prevailed over her
partiality to Leicester, she never could be made fully sensible of his
vices and impru∣dence: The submissions, which he made her, restored him
to her wonted favour; and the lord Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>khurst, who had accused him of misconduct in Holland, lost
for some time her confidence, and was even committed to custody.</P>
<P>SIR Christopher Hatton was another favourite, who, at this
time, received some marks of her partiality. Tho' he had never followed the
profession of the law, he was made chancellor in the place of Bromley,
deceased; but notwithstanding all the expectations and wishes of the
lawyers, he behaved in a manner not un∣worthy that high station: His good
natural capacity supplied the place of experience and study; and his
decisions were not found deficient either in point of equity or judgment. His
enemies had contributed to this promotion, in hopes that his absence from
court, while he attended the business of chancery, would gradually
estrange him from the Queen, and give them an opportunity of under∣mining him
in her favour.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"/> THESE little intrigues and cabals of the
court were silenced by the account, which came from all quarters, of the
vast preparations made by the Spaniards for the invasion of England, and
for the entire conquest of that kingdom. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> Philip, tho' he had not yet declared war, on account of
the hostilities, whi h Elizabeth every where committed upon him, had long
harboured a secret and violent de∣sire of revenge against her. His
ambition also and the hopes of extending his empire were much encouraged by
the present prosperous situation of his affairs; by the conquest of
Portugal, the acquisition of the Indian commerce and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ttlements, and the yearly
importation of vast treasures from America. The point on which he r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted his highest glory, the
perpetual object of his policy, was to support orthodoxy and exterminate
heresy; and as the power and credit of Elizabeth was the chief bulwark of the
protestants, he hoped, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
subdue that princess, to acquire the eternal
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nown, of being able to

<MILESTONE N="1588" UNIT="year"/> against his revolted subjects in the
Netherlands, instigated him to attack the English, who had encouraged that
insurrection, and who, by their near neigh∣bourhood, were so well enabled
to support the Hollanders, that he could never hope to reduce these rebels,
while the power of that kingdom remained entire and unbroken. To subdue
England seemed a necessary preparative to the re∣establishment of his
authority in the Netherlands; and notwithstanding all ap∣pearances, the
former was in itself, as a more important, so a more easy, under∣taking
than the latter. That kingdom lay nearer Spain than the Low Countries, and was
more exposed to invasions from that quarter; after an enemy had ob∣tained
entrance, it was neither fortified by art nor nature; a long peace had
de∣prived it of all military discipline and experience; and the catholics, in
which it still abounded, would be ready to join any invader, who should
free them from those grievous persecutions, at present exercised
against them, and revenge the death of the Queen of Scots, on whom they had
fixed all their affections. The fate of England must be decided in one battle
at sea, and another at land; and what comparison between the English and
Spaniards, either in point of naval force, or in the numbers, reputation, and
veteran bravery of their armies? Be∣sides the acquisition of so great a
kingdom, success against England ensured the immediate subjection of
the Hollanders, who, attacked on every hand, and de∣prived of all support,
must yield their stubborn necks to that yoke, which they had so long
resisted. Happily, this conquest, as it was of the utmost impor∣tance
to the grandeur of Spain, would not at present be opposed by the jealousy
of the neighbouring powers, naturally so much interested to prevent the
success of that enterprize. A truce was lately concluded with the Turks;
the empire was in the hands of a friend and near ally; and France, the
perpetual rival of Spain, was so torn with intestine commotions, that she
had no leizure to pay at∣tention to her foreign interests. This favourable
opportunity, therefore, which might never again present itself, must be
seized; and one bold effort made for acquiring that ascendant in Europe, to
which the present greatness and prosperity of the Spaniards seemed so
fully to intitle them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden. Strype, vol. III.
p. 512.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE hopes and motives engaged Philip, notwithstanding his
cautions tem∣per, to undertake this hazardous enterprize; and tho' the duke of
Parma, when consulted, opposed the attempt, at least represented the
necessity of previously getting possession of some sea-port
town in the Netherlands, which might afford a retreat to the Spanish
navy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, part II. lib 4</NOTE>, it was
determined by the catholic monarch, to proceed im∣mediately to the execution of
his ambitious projects. During some time he had <PB N="631" REF="236"/> been
secretly making preparations; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Invin∣cible Armada.</NOTE> but so soon
as the resolution was fully taken, every part of his vast empire
resounded with the noise of armaments, and all hisministers, generals,
and admirals, were employed in forwarding the design. The marquess of Santo
Croce, a sea officer of great reputation and experience, was destin∣ed to
command the fleet; and by his counsel were the naval equipments conducted In
all the ports of Sicily, of Naples, of Spain and Portugal, artizans were
em∣ployed in building vessels of uncommon size and force; naval stores
were bought up at a prodigious expence; provisions amassed; armies levied
and quartered in the maritime towns of Spain; and plans laid for fitting out
such a fleet and em∣barkation as had never before had its equal in Europe.
The military prepara∣tions in Flanders were no less formidable. Forces from
all quarters were every moment assembling, to reinforce the duke of Parma.
Capizuchi and Spinelli, conducted forces from Italy: The marquess of Borgaut,
a prince of the house of Austria, levied troops in Germany: The Walloon and
Burgundian regiments were compleated or augmented: The Spanish infantry was
supplied with recruits; and an army of thirty four thousand men were
assembled in the Netherlands, and kept in a readiness to be transported
into England. The duke of Parma em∣ployed all the carpenters which he could
procure, either in Flanders or in Lower Germany, and the coasts of the
Baltic; and he built at Dunkirk, and Newport, but especially at Antwerp, a
great number of boats and flat bottomed vessels, for the transport of his
infantry and cavalry into England. The most renowned nobility and princes of
Italy and Spain were ambitious of sharing in the honour of this great
enterprize. Don Amadeaeus of Savoy, Don John of Medicis, Vespasian Gonzaga,
duke of Sabionetta, and the duke of Pastrana, hastened to join the army
under the duke of Parma. About two thousand volunteers, many of them men of
family, had inlisted for the service in Spain. No doubt was en∣tertained,
but such vast preparations, conducted by officers of such consummate
skill, must finally be successful. And the Spaniards, ostentatious of
their power, and elevated with vain hopes, had already denominated their navy
the <HI>Invincible Armada.</HI></P>
<P>NEWS of these extraordinary preparations soon reached
England; and not∣withstanding the secrecy of the Spanish council, and
their pretending intentions to employ this force in the Indies, it was easily
concluded, that they meant to make some effort against England. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparations in England.</NOTE> The Queen had
foreseen the invasion; and finding that she must now contend for her
crown with the whole force of Spain she made preparations for resistance;
nor was she dismayed with that danger, by which all Europe apprehended
she must of necessity be overwhelmed. Her force seemed very unequal
to resist so powerful an enemy. All the seamen in England 
<PB N="632" REF="237"/> amounted at that time only to fourteen thousand two
hundred and ninety-five<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.</NOTE>. The size of the English
shipping was, in general, so small, that, except a few of the Queen's
ships of war, there were not four vessels belonging to the mer∣chants
which exceeded four hundred tuns<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>68.</NOTE>. The royal navy
consisted only of twenty-eight vessels<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 157.</NOTE>, many of which were of very small size;
none of them exceeding the bulk of our largest frigates, and most of them
deserving rather the name of pinnaces than of ships. The only advantage of
the English fleet, consisted in the dexterity and courage of the
seamen, who being accustomed to sail in tempestuous seas, and
expose themselves to all dangers, as much exceeded in this particular the
Spanish mariners, as their vessels were inferior in size and force to
those of that nation<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.</NOTE>. All the commercial towns of
England were re∣quired to furnish ships for reinforcing this small navy;
and they discovered, on the present occasion, great alacrity in defending
their liberty and religion against those imminent perils with which they
were menaced. The city of London, in order to shew their vigour in the common
cause, instead of fifteen vessels which they were commanded to equip,
voluntarily fitted out double the number<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
p. 267.</NOTE>. The gentry and nobility hired, and armed, and manned,
forty-three ships at their own charge<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lives of
the Admirals, vol. I. p. 451.</NOTE>; and all the loans of money which the
Queen demanded, were frankly granted by the persons applied to. Lord Howard
of Effingham, a man of great courage and capacity, was lord admiral, and took
on him the command of the navy: Drake, Hawkins, and Frobisher, the most
renowned seamen in Europe, served under him. The main sleet was
stationed at Plymouth. A smaller squa∣dron, consisting of forty
vessels, English and Flemish, was commanded by the lord Seymour,
second son of protector Somerset; and lay off Dunkirk, in or∣der to
intercept the duke of Parma.</P>
<P>THE land forces of England, compared to those of Spain,
possessed contrary qualities to its naval power: They were more
numerous than the enemy, but much inferior in discipline, reputation, and
experience. An army of twenty thousand men was disposed in different
bodies along the south coast; and orders were given them, if they could not
hinder the Spaniards from landing, to retire backwards, to waste the country
around, and to wait for reinforcement from the neighbouring counties, before
they approached the enemy. A body of twenty-two thousand foot, and a
thousand horse, under the command of the earl of Lei∣cester, was
stationed at Tilbury, in order to defend the capital. The main army▪
consisted of thirty-four thousand foot, and two thousand horse, and
was com∣manded <PB N="633" REF="238"/> by lord Hunsdon. These forces were
reserved for the guard of the Queen's person; and were appointed to march
whithersoever the enemy should appear. The fate of England, if the whole
Spanish armies should be able to land, seemed to depend on the issue
of a single battle; and men of reflection enter∣tained the most dismal
apprehensions, when they considered the force of fifty thousand veteran
Spaniards, commanded by experienced officers, under the duke of Parma, the
most consummate general of the age; and compared this formid∣able armament
with the military power which England, not enervated by peace▪ but long
disused to war, could muster up against it.</P>
<P>THE chief support of the kingdom seemed to consist in
the vigour and pru∣dence of the Queen's conduct; who, undismayed by the
present dangers, issued all her orders with tranquillity, animated her pe
ple to a steddy resistance, and employed every resource, which either
her domestic situation or her foreign alliances could afford her. She
sent Sir Robert Sydney into Scotland; and ex∣horted the King to remain
attached to her, and to consider the danger which at present menaced his
sovereignty no less than her own, from the ambition of the Spanish
tyrant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She made him some promises which she
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fulfilled, to give him a
dukedom in England, with suitable lands and revenue, to settle 5000 l a
year on him and pay him a guard, for the safety of his person. From a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. of lord Loyston</NOTE>: The
ambassador found James sufficiently disposed to cultivate an union
with England, and he even kept himself prepared to march with the force of
his whole kingdom to the assistance of Elizabeth. Her authority with the
King of Denmark, and the tye of their common religion, engaged this prince,
upon her application, to seize a squadron of ships which Philip had
bought or hired in the Danish harbours<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype,
vol. III. p 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE>: The
Hanse Towns, tho' not at that time on good terms with England, were induced
by the same motives, to retard so long the equipment of some vessels
in their ports, that they became useless to the pur∣pose of invading
England. All the protestants throughout Europe, regarded this enterprize as
the critical event which was to decide for ever the fate of their religion; and
tho' unable, by reason of their distance, to join their force to that of
Elizabeth, they kept their eyes fixed on her conduct and fortune, and beheld
with anxiety, mixed with admiration, the intrepid countenance with which she
encountered that dreadful tempest, which was every moment approaching
to∣wards her.</P>
<P>THE Queen also was sensible, that, next to the general
popularity which she enjoyed, and the confidence which her subjects
reposed in her prudent govern∣ment, <PB N="634" REF="239"/> the firmest
support of her throne consisted in the general zeal of the people for the
protestant religion, and the strong prejudices which they had imbibed
against popery. She took care, on this occasion, to revive in the nation
this at∣tachment to their own sect, and this abhorrence of the opposite.
The English were reminded of their former danger from the tyranny of Spain:
All the bar∣barities exercised by Mary against the protestants, were
ascribed to the counsels of that bigotted and imperious nation: The bloody
massacres in the Indies, the unrelenting executions in the Low Countries,
the horrid cruelties and iniquities of the inquisition, were set before
men's eyes: A list and description was pub∣lished, and pictures
dispersed, of the several instruments of torture with which, it was
pretended, the Spanish Armada was loaded: And every artifice, as well as
reason, was employed, to animate the people to a vigorous defence of their
religion, their laws, and their liberties.</P>
<P>BUT while the Queen, in this critical emergence, rouzed the
animosity of the nation against popery, she treated the partizans of that
sect with moderation, and gave not way to an undistinguishing fury
against them. Tho' she knew, that Sixtus Quintus, the present pope,
famous for his capacity and his tyranny, had fulminated a new bull of
excommunication against her, had deposed her from the throne, had
absolved her subjects from their oaths of allegiance, had publish∣ed a
croisade against England, and had granted plenary indulgence to every one
engaged in the present invasion; she would not believe, that all her
catholic sub∣jects could be so blinded, as to sacrifice to bigotry their
duty to their sovereign, and the liberty and independency of their native
country. She rejected all violent counsels, by which she was prompted to
seek pretexts for dispatching the leaders of that party: She would not even
consine any considerable number of them: And the catholics, sensible of
this good usage, generally expressed the highest zeal for the public
defence. Some gentlemen of that sect, conscious that they could not
justly expect any trust or authority, entered themselves as volunteers in
the fleet or army<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 747.</NOTE>: Some equipped
ships at their own charge, and gave the command of them to protestants:
Others were active in animating their tenants and vassals, and neighbours,
to the defence of their country: And every rank of men, burying for the
present all party distinctions, seemed to prepare them∣selves, with
order as well as vigour, to resist the violence of these invaders.</P>
<P>THE more to excite the martial spirit of the nation, the Queen
appeared on horseback in the camp at Tilbury; and riding thro' the lines,
discovered a chear∣ful <PB N="635" REF="240"/> and animated countenance,
exhorted the soldiers to remember their duty to their country and their
religion, and professed her intention, tho' a woman, to lead them herself
into the field against the enemy, and rather to perish in battle than
survive the ruin and slavery of her people<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">

<P>THE Spanish Armada was ready on the beginning of May; but the
moment it was preparing to sail, the marquess of Santa Croce, the admiral,
was seized with a violent fever, of which he soon after died. The
vice-admiral, the duke of Paliano, by a strange concurrence of accident, at
the very same time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the
same fate; and the King appointed for admiral, the duke of Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ina Sidonia, the nobleman of the
greatest family in Spain, but unexperienced in action, and utterly
unacquainted with sea affairs. Alcarede was appointed vice-admiral. This
misfortune, besides the loss of so great an officer as Santa Croce,
retarded the sailing of the Armada, and gave the English more time for
their preparations to oppose them. At last, the fleet, full of hopes and
alacrity, set sail from Lis∣bon; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> but next day met with a
violent tempest, which scattered the ships, sunk some of the
smallest, and forced the rest to take shelter in the Groyne, where they
waited till they could be refitted. When news of this event was carried to 
<PB N="636" REF="241"/> England, the Queen concluded, that the design of an
invasion was disappointed for this summer; and being always ready to lay
hold of every pretence for saving money, she made Walsingham write to the
admiral, directing him to lay up some of the larger ships, and to
discharge the seamen: But lord Effingham, who was not so sanguine in
his hopes, used the freedom to disobey these orders; and he beg∣ed leave
to retain the whole ships in service, tho' it should be at his own
expence<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 545.</NOTE>. He took
advantage of a north wind, and sailed towards the coast of Spain, with an
intention of attacking the enemy in their harbours; but the wind changing to
the south, he became apprehensive, lest they might have set sail, and
by passing him at sea, invade England, now exposed by the absence of
the fleet. He re∣turned, therefore, with the utmost expedition to Plymouth,
and lay at anchor in that harbour.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Armada had repaired all her damages; and with
fresh hopes set out again to sea, in prosecution of her enterprize. The
fleet consisted of a hundred and thirty vessels, of which near a
hundred were galleons, and were of greater size than any which had ever
before been used in Europe. It carried on board nineteen thousand two
hundred and ninety-five soldiers, eight thousand four hundred and
fifty-six mariners, two thousand and eighty-eight galley slaves, and two
thousand six hundred and thirty great pieces of brass ordnance. It was
victualled for six months; and was attended with twenty lesser ships,
called cara∣vals, and ten salves with six oars apiece<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. Appen. p. 221.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE plan formed by the King of Spain, was, that the Armada
should sail to the coast opposite to Dunkirk and Newport; and having
chased away all English or Flemish vessels which might obstruct the
passage, (for it was never supposed they could make opposition)
should join themselves with the duke of Parma, should thence make sail
to the Thames, and having landed the whole Spanish army, thus compleat at one
blow the entire conquest of England. In prosecution of this plan, Philip
gave orders to the duke of Medina, that, in passing along the chan¦nel, he
should sail as near the coast of France as he could with safety; that
he should by this policy avoid meeting with the English fleet; and keeping
in view the main enterprize, should neglect all smaller successes,
which might prove an obstacle, or even interpose a delay, to the
acquisition of a kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Monson. p.
157.</NOTE>. After the Armada was under sail, they took a fisherman, who
informed them, that the English admiral had been lately at sea, had heard
of the tempest which scattered the Armada, had retired back into Plymouth,
and no longer expecting an inva∣sion this season, had laid up his
ships, and discharged most of the seamen. From <PB N="637" REF="242"/>
this false intelligence the duke of Medina conceived the great facility of
attack∣ing and destroying the English ships in harbour; and he was
tempted, by the prospect of so decisive an enterprize, to break his
orders, and make sail directly for Plymouth: A resolution which proved the
safety of England. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th July.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Armada arrives in the Channel.</NOTE> The
Lizard was the first land made by the Armada, about sunset; and as the
Spaniards took it for the Ram-head near Plymouth, they bore out to sea, with
an intention of returning next day, and attacking the English navy. They were
descried by Fleming, a Scotish pyrate, who was roving in these seas,
and who immediately set sail, to inform the English admiral of their
approach<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>: Another fortunate event, which contributed extremely to
the safety of the fleet. Effingham had just time to get out of port, when
he saw the Spanish Armada coming full sail towards him, disposed in
the form of a half-moon, and stretching the distance of seven miles from
the extremity of one division to that of the other.</P>
<P>THE writers of that age raise their stile by a pompous
description of this spec∣tacle; the most magnificent which had ever
appeared upon the ocean, infusing equal terror and admiration into the minds
of all beholders. The lofty masts, the swelling sails, and the towering
prows of the Spanish galleons, seem impos∣sible to be justly painted,
otherwise than by assuming the colours of poetry; and an eloquent
historian of Italy, in imitation of Camden, has asserted, that the
Armada, tho' the ships bore every sail, yet advanced with a slow motion;
as if the ocean groaned with supporting, and the winds were tired with
impelling, so enormous a weight<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 4.</NOTE>. The truth, however,
is, the largest of the Spanish ves∣sels would scarce pass for third
rates in the present navy of England; yet were they so ill framed, or so
ill governed, that they were quite unwieldy, and could not sail upon a wind,
nor tack on occasion, nor be managed in stormy weather by the seamen.
Neither the mechanics of ship-building, nor the experience of mariners, had
attained so great perfection as could serve for the security and
go∣vernment of such bulky vessels; and the English, who had already had
expe∣rience how unserviceable they commonly were, were not dismayed with
their tremendous appearance.</P>
<P>EFFINGHAM gave orders, not to come to a close sight with the
Spaniards, where the size of the ships, he suspected, and the numbers
of soldiers, would be a dis∣advantage to the English; but to cannonade
them at a distance, and to wait the opportunity which winds, currents, or
various chances must afford them, of in∣tercepting some scattered
vessels of the enemy. Nor was it long before the event answered
expectation. A great ship of Bis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, on board of which was a consi∣derable <PB N="638" REF="243"/>
part of the Spanish money, was set on fire by accident; and while all hands
were employed in extinguishing it, she fell behind the rest of the
Armada: The great galleon of Andaluzia was detained by the springing of her
mast: And both these vessels were taken, after some resistance,
by Sir Francis Drake. As the Armada advanced up the channel, the English hung
upon their rear, and still infested them with skirmishes. Each trial
abated the confidence of the Spa∣niards, and added courage to the English;
and the latter soon found, that even in close fight the size of the
Spanish ships was no advantage to them. Their bulk exposed them the more
to the bullets of the enemy; while their cannon, placed too high, shot over
the heads of the English. The alarm having now reached the coast of
England, the nobility and gentry hastened out with their vessels from
every harbour, and reinsorced the admiral. The earls of Oxford,
Northum∣berland, and Cumberland, Sir Thomas Cecil, Sir Robert Cecil, Sir Walter
Raleigh, Sir Thomas Vavasor, Sir Thomas Gerrard, Sir Charles Blount; with
many others, distinguished themselves by this generous and
disinterested service of their country. The English fleet, after the
conjunction of these ships, a∣mounted to an hundred and forty fail.</P>
<P>THE Armada had now reached Calais, a d cast anchor before that
place, in expectation, that the duke of Parma, who had got intelligence of
their ap∣proach, would put to sea, and join his forces to them. The English
admi∣ral practised here a very successful stratagem upon the Spaniards.
He took eight of his smaller ships, and filling them with all combustible
materials, sent them, one after another, into the midst of the enemy. The
Spaniards fancied, that they were fireships of the same contrivance with a
famous vessel which had lately done so much execution at Antwerp; and
they immediately cut their cables, and took to slight with the greatest
disorder and precipitation. The English sell upon them next morning,
while in confusion; and besides doing great damage to other ships, they
took or destroyed about twelve of the enemy.</P>
<P>BY this time, it was become apparent, that the intention, for
which these great preparations were made by the Spaniards, was entirely
srustrated. The vessels, provided by the duke of Parma, were made for
transport, not for sight∣ing; and that general, when urged to leave the
harbour, utterly refused to ex∣pose his flourishing army to such
apparent hazard, as it must incur; while the English, not only were able to
keep the sea, but seemed even to triumph over their enemy. The Spanish
admiral found, in many r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncounters,
that while he lost so considerable a part of his own navy, he had
destroyed only one small vessel of the English; and he foresaw,
that, by continuing so unequal a combat, he must draw inevitable
destruction on all the remainder. He prepared therefore to 
<PB N="639" REF="244"/> <MILESTONE N="1581" UNIT="year"/> return homewards; but
as the winds were contrary in his passage thro' the chan∣nel, he resolved
to sail northwards, and making the tour of the whole island, reach the
Spanish harbours by the ocean. The English fleet followed him during some
time; and had not their ammunition fallen short, by the negligence of the
offices in supplying them, they had obliged the whole Armada to surrender
at discretion. The duke of Medina had once taken that resolution; but was
di∣verted from it by the advice of his confessor. This conclusion of the
enterprize would have been more glorious to the English; but the event proved
equally fatal to the Spaniards. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeated.</NOTE> A violent tempest overtook
the Armada after it passed the Orkneys: The ships had already lost
their anchors, and were obliged to keep to sea: The mariners, unaccustomed
to such hardships, and not able to govern such unwieldy vessels,
yielded to the fury of the storm, and allowed their ships to drive either
on the western isles of Scotland, or on the coast of Ireland, where they
were miserably shipwrecked. Not a half of the navy returned to Spain; and
the seamen, as well as soldiers, who remained, were so overcome with
hard∣ship and fatigue, so dispirited by their discomfiture, that they
filled all Spain with accounts of the valour of the English, and of the
tempestuous violence of that ocean which surrounds them.</P>
<P>SUCH was the miserable and dishonourable conclusion of an
enterprize, which had been preparing for three years, which had exhausted the
revenue and force of Spain, and which had long filled all Europe with anxiety
or expectation. Philip, who was a slave to his passions, but had an
entire command over his coun∣tenance, no sooner heard of the mortifying
event, which blasted all his schemes of ambition, than he fell on his
knees, and rendering thanks for that gracious dispensation of providence,
expressed his joy that the calamity was not greater. The Spanish
priests, who had so ofttn blest this holy croisade, and foretold its
intallible success, were somewhat at a loss to account for the victory
gained over the catholic monarch by excommunicated heretics and an execrable
usurper: But they at last discovered, that all the calamities of the
Spaniards had proceeded from their allowing the infidel Moors to live among
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 525. On the fourth of
September, soon after the dispersion of the Spanish Armada, died the
earl of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the Queen's great,

in England. She had even ordered a commission to be drawn lot him,

authority in the hands of any subject, and pre∣vented the execution of that
design. No wonder, that a conduct, so unlike the usual jealousy of
Eli∣zabeth, gave reason to suspect, that her partiality was founded on
some other passion than friendship. But Elizabeth seemed to carry her
affection to Leicester no farther than the grave: She ordered his goods to be
disposed of at a public sale, to reimburse herself of some money
which he owed her; and her usual attention to money was observed to prevail
over her regard to the memory of the deceased. This earl was a great
hypocrite, a pretender to the strictest religion, an encourager of the
puritans, and a founder of hospitals.</NOTE>.</P>

dispersion of the Spanish Armada, the Queen sum∣moned a new Parliament;
and received from them a supply of two subsidies and four fifteenths
payable in four years. This is the first instance that subsidies were
doubled in one supply; and so unusual a concession was probably
obtained from the joy of the present success, and from the general
sense of the Queen's necessities. Some members objected to this heavy
charge, on account of the great burthen of loans, which had lately been
imposed upon them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 542. Id.

that this house of commons, like all the foregoing, would be governed by the
puritans; and therefore, to obviate their enterprizes, she renewed, at the
beginning of the session, her usual injunction, that they should not
on any account, presume to treat of matters ecclesiastical.
Notwithstanding this strict inhibition, the zeal of one Damport moved him
to present a bill to the commons for remedying the grievances, and
restraining the tyranny, of the <PB N="641" REF="246"/> ecclesiastical
commission, which were certainly enormous: But when Mr. secre∣tary Wolley
reminded the house of her majesty's commands, no one durst second the
motion; the bill was not so much as read; and the speaker returned it back
to Damport, without taking the least notice of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewe, p. 43<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.
Some members of the house, notwithstanding the general submission,
were even committed to custody on ac∣count of this attempt<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Whitgist, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. Neal, vol 1. p. 500.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE imperious conduct of Elizabeth appeared still more clearly
in another parliamentary transaction. The right of purveyance was an antient
prerogative, by which the officers of the crown could at pleasure take
provisions for the houshold from all the neighbouring counties, and the
use of carts and carriages; and the price of these services was fixed and
stated. The payment of the money was often distant and uncertain; and the
rates were always much inferior to the market price; so that purveyance,
besides the slavery of it, was always regarded as a great burthen, and
being arbitrary and casual, was liable to great abuses. We may fairly
presume, that the hungry courtiers of Elizabeth, supported by her unlimited
power, would be sure to render this prerogative very oppressive to the
people; and the commons had, last session, found it necessary to
pass a bill for regulating these exactions: But the bill was lost in the
house of peers<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">D'Ewe▪ p
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>. The continuance of the
abuses begot a new attempt for redress; and the same bill was now
revived, and sent up again to the house of peers, together with a bill for
some new regulations in the court of Exchequer. Soon after, the commons
received a message from the upper house, desiring them to appoint a
committee for a conference. At this conference, the peers informed them, that
the Queen, by a message, delivered by lord Burleigh, had expressed her
displeasure, that the commons should presume to touch on her
prerogative. If there were any abuses, she said, either in imposing
purveyance, or in the practice of the court of Ex∣chequer, her majesty was
both able and willing to provide due reformation; but would not permit the
Parliament to intermeddle in these matters<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>.
The com∣mons, alarmed at this intelligence, appointed a new committee to attend
the Queen, and endeavour to satisfy her of their humble and dutiful
intentions▪ Elizabeth gave a gracious reception to the committee: She
expressed her great <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nestimable loving care</HI> towards her loving subjects; which,
she said, was greater than of her own self, or even than any of them
could have of themselves. She told them, that she had already given orders
for an enquiry into the abuses attending purveyance, but the dangers of the
Spanish invasion had retarded the progress of that design; that she
had as much skill, will, and power to rule her own house∣hold 
<PB N="642" REF="247"/> as any subjects whatsoever to govern theirs, and
needed as little the assistance of her neighbours; that the Exchequer was
her chamber, consequently more near to her than even her houshold, and
therefore the less proper for them to intermeddle with; and that she would
of herself, with the advice of her council and the judges, redress all
grievances in these matters, but would not permit them, by laws moved without
her privity, to bereave her of the honour attend∣ing these regulations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 444.</NOTE>. The issue of this matter was the
same that attended all contests between Elizabeth and her Parliaments<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Si rixa est, ubi tu pulsas, ego vapulo tantum.
<HI>Juven.</HI></NOTE>. She seems even to have been more imperious, in this
particular, than her predecessors; at least, her more re∣mote ones: For
they often permitted the abuses of purveyance<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">

<P>We may judge of the extent and importance of these
abuses by a speech of Bacon's against pur∣veyors, delivered in the
first Parliament of the subsequent reign. 
<Q REND="inline">"First," says he, "they take in hand
what they ought not to take; secondly, they take in quantity a far greater
proportion than cometh to your majesty's use; thirdly, they take in an
unlawful manner, in a manner, I say, directly and expressly prohibited by
several laws. For the first, I am a little to alter their name: For
instead of takers, they become taxers: Instead of taking provisions for
your majesty's service, they tax your people <HI>ad redimendam
vexationem;</HI> imposing upon them and extorting from them divers sums of
mo∣ney, sometimes in gross, sometimes in the nature of stipends
annually paid, <HI>ne noceant,</HI> to be freed and eased of their
oppression. Again, they take trees, which by law they cannot do; timber
trees, which are the beauty, countenance and shelter of men's houses; that
men have long spared from their own purse and profit; that men esteem,
for their use and delight, above ten times the value; that area loss which
men cannot repair or recover. These do they take, to the defacing and
spoiling of your subjects mansions and dwellings, except they may be
compounded with to their own appetites. And if a gentleman be too hard for them
while he is at home, they will watch their time when there is but a bailiss
or a servant remaining, and put the ax to the root of the tree, ere ever the
master can stop it. Again, they use a strange and most unjust
exaction in causing the subjects to pay poundage of their own debts, due
from your majesty unto them: So as a poor man, when he has had his hay or his
wood, or his poultry (which perchance he was full loath to part with, and had
for the provision of his own family and not to put to sale) taken from him,
and that not at a just price, but under the value, and cometh to receive his
money, he shall have after the rate of twelve pence in the pound abated for
poundage of his due payment upon so hard conditions. Nay farther they are
grown to that extremity (as is affirmed, tho' it be scarce credible, save
that in such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all things are
credible) that they will take double poundage, once when the debenture is
made<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and again the second time,
when the money is paid. For the second point, most gracious soverign,
touching the quantity which they take sar above that which is answered to
your majesty's use; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
affirmed unto me by divers gentlemen of good report, as a matter which I may
safely avouch unto your majesty, that there is no pound profit, which
redoundeth unto your majesty in this course but induceth and begetteth
three pound damage upon your subjects, beside the discontentment. And to
the end they may make their spoil more securely, what do they? Whereas
divers statutes do strictly provide, that whatsoever they take shall be
registered and attested, to the end that by mak∣ing a collation of that
which is taken from the country and that which is answered above, their
de∣ceits might appear, they, to the end to obscure their deceits, utterly
omit the observation of this which the law prescribeth. And therefore to
descend, if it may please your majesty, to the third sort of abuse,
which is of the unlawful manner of their taking, whereof this question is a
branch; it is so manifold, as it rather asketh an enumeration of some of
the particulars than a prosecution of all. For their price, by law they ought
to take as they can agree with the subject; by abuse they take at an
imposed and enforced price: By law they ought to make but one apprizement by
neigh∣bours in the country; by abuse, they make a second apprizement at the
court gate, and when the subjects cattle come up many miles lean and out of
plight by reason of their travel, then they prize them anew at an abated
price: By law, they ought to take between sun and sun; by abuse, they
take by twilight and in the night-time, a time well chosen for malefactors:
By law, they ought not to take in the high-ways (a place by her majesty's
high prerogative protected, and by statute by special words excepted) by
abuse, they take in the high-ways: By law, they ought to shew their
commission, &amp;c. A number of other particulars there are, &amp;c."</Q>
Bacon's works, vol. IV. p. 305, 306.</P> 
<P>Such were the abuses, which Elizabeth would neither permit
her Parliaments to meddle with, nor re∣dress herself. I believe it will
readily be allowed, that this slight prerogative alone, which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passed almost unobserved
amidst other branches of so much greater importance, was sufficient to
extinguish all regular liberty. For what elector, or member of Parliament, or
even juryman, dust oppose the will of the court, while he lay under the
lash of such an anbitrary prerogative? For a farther ac∣count of the
grievous and incredible oppressions of purveyors, see the journals of the
house of com∣mons, vol. I. p. 190. There is a story of a carter, which may
be worth mentioning on this occasion. 
<Q REND="inline">"A carter had three time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been at Windsor with his cart to
carry away, upon summons of a remove some part of the stuff of her
majesty's wardrobe; and when he had repaired thither once, twice, and the
third time, and that they of the wardrobe had told him the third time that the

enacted for that purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="643" REF="248"/> IN so great awe did the commons stand
of every courtier, as well as of the crown, that they durst use no freedom
of speech, which, they thought, would give the least offence to any of
them. Sir Edward Hobby shewed in the house his great grief, that by some
great personage, not a member of the house, he had been sharply rebuked
for speeches delivered in Parliament: He craved the favour of the house,
and desired that some of the members might inform that great personage of
his true meaning and intention in these speeches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes. p. 432, 433.</NOTE>. The commons, to obviate these
inconveniencies, passed a vote, that no one should reveal the secrets
of the house<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">An act was passed this
session, enforcing the former statute, which imposed twenty pounds a

<P><PB N="644" REF="249"/> THE discomfiture of the Armada had
begot in the nation a kind of enthusiastic passion for enterprizes
against Spain; and nothing seemed now impossible to be atchieved by the
valour and fortune of the English. Don Antonio, prior of Crato, was a natural
son of the royal family of Portugal, who, trusting to the aversion of his
countrymen against the Castilians, had advanced a claim to the crown, and
flying first to France, thence to England, had been encouraged both by Henry
and Elizabeth in his pretensions. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedition against Por∣tugal.</NOTE> A
design was formed by the people, not the court, of England to conquer the
kingdom for Don Antonio: Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norris were the leaders
in this romantic enterprize: Near twenty thousand voluntiers<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs of Queen Elizabeth, vol. l. p. 61.

hired, as well as arms provided, at the sole charge of the adventurers. The
Queen's frugality kept her from contributing more than sixty thousand
pounds to the expence; and she only allowed six of her ships of war to
attend the expe∣dition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 267.</NOTE>. There
was more spirit and bravery, than foresight or prudence, in the conduct of
this enterprize. The small stock of the adventurers would not permit them
to buy either provisions or ammunition sufficient for such an
under∣taking: They even wanted vessels to stow the numerous voluntiers,
who crowded to them; and they were obliged to seize by force some ships
of the hanse towns, which they met with at sea: An expedient, which set
them somewhat more at their case in point of room for their men, but
remedied not the deficiency of their provisions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 159.</NOTE>. Had they sailed directly to Portugal, it
is believed, that the good will of the people, joined to the defenceless
state of the kingdom, might have ensured them of success: But hearing,
that great preparations were making at the Groine for the invasion of
England, they were induced to go thither, and destroy this new armament of
Spain. They broke into the harbour; burned some ships of war, particularly
one commanded by Recalde, vice admiral of Spain; they defeated an army of four
or five thousand men, which was assembled to oppose them; they
assaulted the Groine, and took the lower town, which they pillaged; and
they would have taken the higher, tho' well fortified, had they not found their
ammunition and provisions beginning to fall short. The young earl of
Essex, a nobleman of very promising hopes, who,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired with the thirst of military
honour, had secretly, unknown to the Queen, stole from England, here joined
the adventurers; and it was then agreed by common consent to make
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail for Portugal, the main object
of their enterprize.</P>
<P><PB N="645" REF="250"/> THE English landed at Paniche, a
sea-port town, twelve leagues from Lisbon; and Norris led the army to that
capital, while Drake undertook to sail up the river, and attack the city with
his united forces. By this time, the court of Spain had got leizure to prepare
against the invasion of the English. Forces were thrown into Lisbon:
The Portuguese were disarmed: All suspected per∣sons were taken into
custody: And thus, tho' the inhabitants bore great affection to Don Antonio,
none of them dared to declare in favour of the invaders. The English army,
however, made themselves masters of the suburbs, which abounded with
riches of all kinds; but as they desired to conciliate the affections of the
Portugueze, and were more intent on honour than profit, they observed a
strict discipline, and abstained from all plunder. Meanwhile they found
their ammu∣nition and provisions totally exhausted; they had not a single
cannon to make a breach in the walls; the admiral had not been able to pass
some fortresses, which guarded the river; there was no appearance of any
insurrection in their favour; sickness from fatigue, hunger, and
intemperance in wine and fruits had seized the army: So that it was found
requisite to make all haste possible to reimbark. They were not
pursued by the enemy; and finding, at the mouth of the river, sixty ships
laden with naval stores, they seized them as lawful prize; tho' they
belonged to the Hanse Towns, a neutral power. They sailed thence to Vigo,
which they took and burned; and having ravaged the country round, they set
sail and arrived safely in England. Above the half of these gallant
adventurers perished by sickness, famine, fatigue, and the sword<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, vol.
l. p 61.</NOTE>; and England reaped much more honour than profit from this
extraordinary expedition. It is com∣puted, that eleven hundred gentlemen
embarked on board this fleet, and that only three hundred and fifty survived
these multiplied disasters<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Birch,
Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN these ships were on their voyage homewards, they met
with the earl of Cumberland, who was outward bound, with a fleet of seven
sail, all equipped at his own charge, except one ship of war, which the
Queen had lent him. That nobleman supplied Sir Francis Drake with some
provisions; a generosity, which saved the lives of many of Drake's men,
but which the others suffered severely for afterwards. Cumberland sailed
towards the Ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eras, and took
several prizes from the enemy; but the richest, valued at an hundred
thousand pounds, perished in her return, with all her cargo, near St.
Michael's Mount in Cornwal. Many of these adventurers were killed in a rash
attempt at the Terceras: A de∣structive mortality seized the rest: And it
was with difficulty that the few hands, which remained, were able to st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r the ships home into harbour<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 161.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> THO' the signal
advantages, gained over the Spaniards, and the spirit, which they infused
into the English, gave Elizabeth great security during the rest of her
reign, she could not forbear keeping an anxious eye towards Scotland, whose
situation rendered the revolutions of that kingdom always of importance to
her. It might have been expected, that this high-spirited princess, who
knew so well to encounter danger, would not have retained that suspicious
jealousy towards Scotland, with which, during the life-time of Mary, she
had been so much agi∣tated. James had indeed succeeded to all his mother's
claims; but he had not succeeded to the favour of the catholics, which could
alone render these claims dangerous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I.
p. 51.</NOTE>: And as the Queen was now well advanced in years, and enjoyed the
most uncontrouled authority over her subjects, it was not likely, that the
King of Scots, who was of an indolent unambitious temper, would ever give her
any disturbance in the possession of her throne. Yet all these
circumstances could not remove her timorous suspicions: And so far from
satisfying the nation by a settlement of the successi n, or a
declaration of James's title, she was as anxious to prevent every incident,
which might raise his credit or procure him the regard of the English, as
if he had been her immediate rival and competitor. Most of his ministers
and favourites were her pensioners; and as she was desirous to hinder him
from marrying and having children, she obliged them to throw obstacles in
the way of every alliance, even the most reasonable, which could be offered
him; and during some years, she succeeded in this malignant po∣licy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 166, 177.</NOTE>. He had fixed on the
eldest daughter of the King of Denmark, who being a remote prince and not
very powerful, could give her no umbrage; yet did she so artfully cross
this negotiation, that the Danish monarch, impatient of delay, married his
daughter to the duke of Brunswic. James then renewed his suit to the
younger princess; and still found obstacles from the intrigues of
Elizabeth, who, merely with a view of interposing delay, proposed to him
the sister of the King of Navarre, a princess much older than himself,
and entirely destitute of fortune. The young King, besides the desire of
securing himself by offspring, from those traiterous attempts, too
frequent among his subjects, had been so watched by the rigid austerities
of the ecclesiastics, that he had another inducement to marriage, which is
not so usual with monarchs. His impatience, therefore, broke thro' all the
politics of Elizabeth: The articles of marriage were settled: The ceremony
was performed by proxy: And the princess em∣barked for Scotland; but was
drove by a storm into a port of Norway. This tempest, and some others,
which happened near the same time, were universally believed in Scotland
and Denmark to have proceeded from a combination of the <PB N="647" REF="252"/>
Scottish and Danish witches; and the dying confession of the criminals
was sup∣posed to place the accusation beyond all controversy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 180.</NOTE>. James, however, tho' a great believer in
sorcery, was not deterred by this incident from taking a voyage, in order to
conduct his bride home: He arrived in Norway; carried the Queen thence to
Copenhagen; and having passed the winter in that city, he brought her next
spring to Scotland, where they were joyfully received by the people. The
clergy alone, who never let pass an opportunity of vexing him, made
opposition to the Queen's coronation, on account of the ceremony of anointing
her, which, they alledged, was either a Jewish or a popish rite; and
therefore utterly antichristian and unlawful. But James was as much bent on
the ceremony, as they were averse to it; and after much controversy and
many intrigues, his authority, which had not often happened, at last
prevailed over their opposition<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wood p.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"/> AFTER a state of great anxiety and
many difficulties, Elizabeth had at length reached a situation, where, tho'
her affairs still required attention, and found employment for her active
temper, she was removed from all danger of any immediate revolution, and
might regard the efforts of her enemies with some degree of confidence and
security. Her successful and prudent administra∣tion had gained her,
together with the admiration of foreigners, the affections of her own
subjects; and after the death of the Queen of Scots, even the catholics,
however discontented, pretended not to dispute her title, or adhere to any
other person as her rival and competitor. James, curbed by his factious
nobility and ecclesiastics, possessed at home very little
authority; and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to remain
on good terms with Elizabeth and the English nation, in hopes that time,
aided by his patient tranquillity, would secure him that rich
succession, to which his birth entitled him. The Hollanders, tho'
overmatched in their contest with <PB N="648" REF="253"/>
<MILESTONE N="1590" UNIT="year"/> Spain, still made an obstinate
resistance; and such was their unconquerable anti∣pathy to their old
masters, and such the prudent conduct of young Maurice, their governor,
that the subduing that small territory, if at all possible, must be
the work of years, and the result of many and great successes. Philip,
who, in his powerful effort against England, had been transported by
resentment and am∣bition beyond his usual cautious maxims, was now
disabled, and still more dis∣couraged, from adventuring again on such
hazardous enterprizes. The situation also of affairs in France, began
chiefly to employ his attention; but notwith∣standing all his artifice, and
force, and expence, the events in that kingdom proved every day more contrary
to his pretensions, and more favourable to the friends and confederates of
England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French affairs.</NOTE> THE violence of the
League having constrained Henry to declare war against the Hugonots,
these religionist, seemed exposed to the utmost danger; and
Eli∣zabeth, sensible of the intimate connection between her own interests
and those of that party, had supported the King of Navarre by her
negociations in Ger∣many, and still more by large sums of money, which
she remitted for levying forces in that country. That heroic prince, not
discouraged by the great supe∣riority of his enemies, took the field; and
in the year 1587 gained, at Coutras, a compleat victory over the army of the
French King; but as his allies, the Ger∣mans, were at the same time
discomfited by the army of the League, under the duke of Guise, his
situation, notwithstanding his victory, seemed still as despe∣rate as
ever. The chief advantage which he reaped from this diversity of success,
was the divisions which, by that means, took place among his enemies. The
inhabitants of Paris, intoxicated with admiration of Guise, and strongly
preju∣diced against their King, whose intentions had become suspicious
to them, took to arms, and obliged Henry to fly for his safety. That prince,
dissembling his resentment, entered into negociation with the League; and
having conferred many high offices on Guise and his partizans, summoned an
assembly of the states at Blois, under preten e of finding means and
expedients to support the intended war against the Hugonots. The various
scenes of persidy and cruelty which had been exhibited in France, had
justly begot a mutual di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>idence
among all parties; yet Guise, trusting more to the timidity than honour of
the King, rashly put himself into the hands of that monarch, and expected,
by the ascendant of his own ge∣nius, to make him submit to all his
exorbitant pretensions. Henry, tho' of an easy disposition, not
steddy to his resolutions, nor even to his promises, wanted neither
courage nor capacity; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of the duke of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> and finding all his
subtilties eluded by the vigour of Guise, and even his throne exposed to
the most imminent danger, he embraced <PB N="649" REF="254"/> more violent
counsels than were natural to him, and ordered that duke and his brother, the
cardinal of Guise, to be assassinated in his palace.</P>
<P>THIS cruel execution, which the necessity of it could alone
excuse, had nearly proved fatal to the author, and seemed at first to
plunge him into greater dangers than those which he sought to avoid, by
taking vengeance on his enemy. The partizans of the league were enflamed with
the utmost rage against him: The populace every where, particularly at
Paris, renounced all allegiance to him: The ecclesiastics and the preachers
filled all places with execrations against his name: And the most powerful
cities, and the most opulent provinces, appeared to combine in a resolution
of renouncing monarchy, or of changing their mo∣narch. Henry, finding slender
resources among his catholic subjects, was con∣strained to enter into a
confederacy with the Hugonots and the King of Navarre: He enlisted large
bodies of Swiss infantry and German cavalry: And being still supported by
his chief nobility, he assembled, by all these means, an army of near
forty thousand men, and advanced to the gates of Paris, ready to crush the
League, and subdue all his enemies. The desperate resolution of one man
di∣verted the course of these great events. Jaques Clement, a Dominican
monk, inflamed by that bloody spirit of bigotry which distinguishes this
century, and a great part of the following one, beyond all other ages of the
world, embraced the resolution of sacrificing his own life, in order to
save the church from the per∣secutions of an heretical tyrant; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Henry the third.</NOTE> and being
admitted, under some pretext, to the King's presence, he gave that prince a
mortal wound with a knife, and was im∣mediately put to death, by the courtiers,
who hastily revenged the murder of their sovereign. This remarkable
incident happened on the first of August, 1589.</P>
<P>THE King of Navarre, next heir to the crown, assumed the
government, un∣der the title of Henry the fourth; but succeeded to much
greater difficulties than those which surrounded his predecessor. The
prejudices entertained against his re∣ligion, made a great part of the
nobility desert him; and it was only by his pro∣mise of hearkening to
conferences and instruction, that he could engage any of the catholics to
adhere to his undoubted title. The League, governed by the duke of Mayenne,
brother to Guise, gathered new force; and the King of Spain entertained
views, either of dismembering the monarchy, or of annexing the whole to his
own dominions. In these distressful circumstances, Henry addressed
himself to Elizabeth, and found her well disposed to contribute to his
assistance, and to oppose the progress of the catholic League, and of
the King of Spain, her inveterate and dangerous enemies. To prevent the
desertion of his Swiss and German troops, she made him a present of
twenty-two thousand pounds; a larger <PB N="650" REF="255" MS="y"/> sum
than, as he declared, he had ever seen before: And she sent him a
reinforce∣ment of four thousand men, under lord Willoughby, an officer of
reputation, who joined the French at Dieppe. Strengthened by these
supplies, Henry march∣ed directly to Paris; and having taken the suburbs,
sword in hand, he abandon∣ed them to be pillaged by his soldiers. He
employed this body of English troops in many other enterprizes; and found
still great cause to praise their courage and fidelity. The time of their
service being elapsed, he dismissed them with many high
commendations. Sir William Drury, Sir Thomas Baskerville, and Sir John
Boroughs, acquired reputation this campaign, and revived in France the ancient
fame of English valour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of Henry the fourth.</NOTE> THE
army which Henry next campaign led into the field, was much inferior to that of
the League; but as it was composed of the chief nobility of France, he feared
not to encounter his enemies in a pitched battle at Yvr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and he gained a compleat victory over them. This
success enabled him to blockade Paris, and he reduced that capital to the
last extremity of famine: When the duke of Parma, in consequence of orders
from Philip, marched to the relief of the League, and obliged Henry to raise
the blockade. Having performed this important service, he retired back to the
Low Countries; and by his con∣summate skill in the art of war, performed
these long marches in the face of the enemy, without affording the French
monarch that opportunity which he sought, of giving him battle, or so much
as putting his army once in disorder. The only loss which he sustained,
was in the Low Countries; where prince Maurice took advantage of his absence,
and recovered some towns which Parma had for∣merly conquered from the
States<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year the nation suffered a great loss,
by the death of Sir Francis Walsingham, secretary o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> state; a man equally celebrated for his ability and
his integrity. He had passed thro' many employment, had been very frugal in
his expences, yet died so poor, that his family was obliged to give him a
pri∣vate burial. He l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t only one

brother to Leicester.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1591" UNIT="year"/> THE situation of Henry's
affairs, tho' promising, was not so well advanced or established as to
make the Queen discontinue her succours; and she was still more
confirmed in the resolution of supporting him, by some advantages gained
by the King of Spain. The duke of Mercoeur, governor of Britanny, a prince of
the house of Lorraine, had declared for the League; and finding himself
hard pres∣sed by Henry's forces, he had been obliged, in order to his
security, to introduce some Spanish troops into the sea-port towns of
that province. Elizabeth was <PB N="651" REF="256"/> alarmed with the danger;
and foresaw, that the Spaniards, besides infesting the English commerce
by privateers, might employ these harbours as the seat of their naval
preparations, and might more easily, from that near neighbourhood, than from
Spain or Portugal, project an invasion of England. She concluded, there∣fore,
a new treaty with Henry, in which she engaged to send over three thousand
men, to be employed in the reduction of Britanny, and stipulated, that her
charges should, in a twelve month, or so soon as the enemy was expelled,
be refunded her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 561.</NOTE>. These forces
were commanded by Sir John Norris; and under him by his brother Henry, and by
Anthony Shirley. Sir Roger Williams was at the head of a small body which
garrisoned Dieppe: And a squadron of ships, under the command of Sir
Henry Palmer, lay upon the coast of France, and intercept∣ed all the
vessels belonging to the Spaniards or the Leaguers.</P>
<P>THE events of war can very little be regulated before hand by
any treaty or agreement; and Henry, who found it requisite to lay aside the
projected enter∣prize against Britanny, persuaded the English commanders
to join his army, and to take a share in the war which he carried on in
Picardy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 116.</NOTE>.
Notwithstand∣ing the disgust which Elizabeth received from this
disappointment, he laid before her a plan for expelling the Leaguers from
Normandy, and persuaded her to send over a new body of four thousand men,
to assist him in that enterprize. The earl of Essex was appointed
general of these forces; a young nobleman, who, by many exterior
accomplishments, and still more real merit, was daily advanc∣ing in favour
with Elizabeth, and seemed to occupy that place in her affections which
Leicester, who was now deceased, had so long enjoyed. Essex,
impatient for military fame, was extremely uneasy to lie some time at
Dieppe unemployed; and had not the orders which he received from his
mistress been so positive, he would gladly have accepted of Henry's
invitation, and have marched to join the French army now in Champagne. This
plan of operations was also proposed to Elizabeth, by the French
ambassador; but she rejected it with great displeasure; and she
threatned immediately to recall her troops, if Henry should persevere any
longer in his present practice, of breaking all concert with her, and
attending to nothing but his own interests<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Birch's Negociations.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 123,
140.</NOTE>. Urged by these motives, the French King, at last, led his army
into Normandy, and laid siege to Roüen, which he reduced to great
difficulties. But the League, who were unable of themselves to take the field
against him, had again recourse to the duke of Parma, who received orders
to march to their assistance. He executed this enterprize with his
usual ability <PB N="652" REF="257"/> <MILESTONE N="1592" UNIT="year"/> and
success; and, for the present, frustrated all the projects of Henry and
Eliza∣beth. This princess, who kept still in view the interests of her
own kingdoms in all her foreign transactions, was impatient under these
disappointments, blam∣ed Henry for his negligence in the execution of
treaties, and complained, that the English forces were thrust forward in
every hazardous enterprize<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
562.</NOTE>. It is probable, however, that their own ardent courage, and their
desire of distin∣guishing themselves in so celebrated a theatre for
war, were the cause why they so often enjoyed this perilous honour.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the indifferent success of former
enterprizes, the Queen was sensible how necessary it was to support
Henry against the League and the Spaniards; and she formed a new treaty
with him, in which they agreed, never to make peace with Philip, but by common
consent; <HI>she</HI> promised to send him a new supply of four
thousand men; and <HI>he</HI> stipulated to repay her charges in a
twelvemonth, to employ these forces, joined to a body of French troops, in an
expedition against Britanny, and to consign into her hands a sea-port
town of that province, for a retreat to the English<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. XVI. p. 151, 168, 171, 173.</NOTE>. Henry knew the
impossibility of execut∣ing some of these articles, and the imprudence
of fulfilling others; but finding them rigidly insisted on by Elizabeth, he
accepted of her succours, and trusted that he might easily, under some
pretence, be able to excuse his failure in the exe∣cution of his part of the
treaty. This campaign was the least successful to Henry of all those
which he had yet carried on against the League:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval enter∣prizes against Spain.</NOTE>
DURING these military operations in France, Elizabeth employed her naval
power against Spain, and endeavoured to intercept the West-Indian
treasures, the source of that greatness which rendered Philip so
formidable to all his neighbours. She sent a squadron of seven ships,
under the command of lord Thomas How∣ard, for this service; but the King of
Spain, informed of her purpose, fitted out a navy of fifty-five sail, and
dispatched them to escort the Indian fleet. They fell in with the English
squadron; and by the courageous obstinacy of Sir Richard Greenville, the
vice-admiral, who refused to make sail with the rest of the squa∣dron,
they took one ship, the first English man of war which had yet fallen
into the hands of the Spaniards<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This action of
Sir Richard Greenville is so singular, as to merit a more particular
relation. He was engaged alone with the whole Spanish fleet of fifty-three
sail, which had ten thousand men on board; and from th time the fight
begun, which was about three in the afternoon, to the break of day next
morning, he repulsed the enemy fifteen times, tho' they continually shifted
their vessels, and boarded with fresh men. In the beginning of the action
he himself received a wound; but he con∣tinued doing his duty above deck till
eleven at night, when receiving a fresh wound, he was carried down to be
dressed. During this operation he received a shot in the head, and the
surgeon was killed by his side. The English began now to want powder; all
their small arms were broke or become use∣less; of their number, which
were but a hundred and three at first, forty were killed, and almost all
the rest wounded; their masts were beat overboard, their tackle cut in
pieces, and nothing but a hulk left, unable to move one way or other. In this
situation Sir Richard proposed to the ship's company, to trust to the
mercy of God, not to that of the Spaniards, and to destroy the ship with
themselves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather than yield to
the enemy. The master gunner, and many of the seamen, agreed to this
despe∣rate resolution; but others opposed it, and obliged Greenville to
surrender himself prisoner. He died a few days after; and his last
words were▪ 
<Q REND="inline">"Here die I, Richard Greenville, with a joyful
and quiet mind; for that I have ended my life as a true soldier ought to do,
fighting for his coun∣try, Queen, religion, and honour: My soul willingly
departing from this body, leaving behind the lasting fame of having behaved
as every valiant soldier is in duty bound to do."</Q> The Spaniards lost in
this sharp tho' unequal action, sour ships, and about a thousand men.
And Greenville's vessel herself perished soon after, with two hundred
Spaniards in her. Hackluyt's Voyages, vol. II. part 2. p. 169▪ Camden, p.
565.</NOTE>. The rest of the squadron returned safely into 
<PB N="653" REF="258"/> England, frustrated of their expectations, but
pleasing themselves with the idea that their attempt had not been
altogether fruitless in hurting the enemy. The Indian fleet had been so
long detained in the Havanna, from the fear of the Eng∣lish, that they were
obliged at last to set sail in an improper season, and most of them
perished by shipwreck ere they reached the Spanish harbours<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 163.</NOTE>. The earl of Cumberland made
a like unsuccessful enterprize against the Spanish trade. He carried
out one ship of the Queen's, and seven others, equipped at his own
ex∣pence; but the prizes which he made, did not compensate him for the
charge<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 169.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE spirit of these expensive and hazardous adventures was
very prevalent in England. Sir Walter Raleigh, who had enjoyed great favour
with the Queen, finding his interest to decline, resolved to recover her
good graces by some im∣portant undertaking; and as his reputation was high in
England, he persuad∣ed great numbers to engage with him as volunteers, in an
attempt on the West-Indies. The fleet was detained so long in the Channel,
by contrary winds, that the season was lost: Raleigh was recalled by the
Queen: Sir Martin Forbisher succeeded to the command, and made a
privateering voyage against the Spaniards. He took a rich Carrack near the
island of Flores, and destroyed another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
165. Camden, p. 569.</NOTE>. About the same time, Thomas White, a Londoner,
took two Spanish ships, which, besides fourteen hundred chests of
quicksilver, contained above two millions of bulls for indulgences; a
commodity useless to the English, but which had cost the King of Spain
three hundred thousand florins, and would have been sold by him in the
Indies for five millions.</P>
<P><PB N="654" REF="259"/> <MILESTONE N="1593" UNIT="year"/> THIS
war did great damage to Spain; but it was attended with considerable expence
to England, and Elizabeth's ministers computed, that, since the
com∣mencement of it, she had expended in Flanders and France, and on her
naval expeditions, above one million two hundred thousand pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol III.</NOTE>; a charge which, notwithstanding her
extreme frugality, was too burthensome for her narrow reve∣nues to bear. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">19 February.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament</NOTE> She summoned, therefore,
a Parliament, in order to obtain sup∣ply: But she either thought her
authority so established, that she needed to make them no
concessions in return, or she rated her power and prerogative above
mo∣ney: For there was never any Parliament whom she treated in so haughty a
man∣ner, whom she made more sensible of their own weakness, or whose
privileges she more undervalued. When the speaker, Sir Edward Coke, made
the three usual demands, of freedom from arrests, of access to her
person, and of liberty of speech; she replied to him, by the mouth of
Puckering, lord-keeper, that liberty of speech was granted the commons, but
they must know what liberty they were entitled to; not a liberty for every
one to speak what he listeth, or what cometh in his brain to utter; their
privilege extended no farther than a liberty of Aye or No: That she enjoined
the speaker, if he perceived any idle heads so negligent of their own
safety, as to attempt reforming the church, or innovating in the
commonwealth, that he should refuse any bills exhibited to that purpose,
till they were examined by such as were fitter to consider of these
things, and could better judge of them: That she would not impeach the
free∣dom of their persons; but they must beware, lest, under colour of
this privilege, they imagined, that any neglect of their duty could be covered
or protected: And that she would not refuse them access to her person;
provided it was upon urgent and weighty causes, and at times convenient, and
when she might have lei∣sure from other important causes of the
realm<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 460, 469. Townsend, p.
37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the menacing and contemptuous air of this
speech, the intrepid and indefatigable Peter Wentworth, not discouraged by
his former ill success, ventured to transgress the imperial orders of
Elizabeth. He presented to the lord keeper a petition, in which he desired
the upper house to join the lower in a supplication to her majesty, for
entailing the succession of the crown; and declared, that he had a bill
ready prepared for that purpose. This method of proceeding was sufficiently
respectful and cautious; but the subject was always ex∣tremely
disagreeable to the Queen, and what she had expressly prohibited any one
to meddle with: She sent Wentworth immediately to the Tower; committed Sir
Thomas Bromley, who had seconded him, to the Fleet prison, together with
Ste∣vens, <PB N="655" REF="260"/> and Welsh, two members, to whom Sir Thomas
had communicated his intention<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p 470.
Townsend▪ p. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>
About a fortnight after, a motion was made in the house, to peti∣tion the
Queen, for the release of these members; but it was answered by all the
privy counsellors there present, that her majesty had committed them for
causes best known to herself, and that to press her on that head would
only tend to the prejudice of the gentlemen whom they meant to serve: She
would release them whenever she thought proper, and would be better
pleased to do it of her own proper motion, than from their
suggestion<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 497.</NOTE>. The
house willingly acquiesced in this reasoning.</P>
<P>SO arbitrary an act, at the commencement of the session,
might well repress all farther attempts for freedom: But the religious zeal
of the puritans was not so easily restrained; and it inspired a courage
which no human motive was able to surmount. Morrice, attorney of the court of
wards, made a motion for re∣dressing the abuses in the bishops' courts,
but above all, in the high commission; where subscriptions, he said,
were exacted to articles at the pleasure of the pre∣lates; where oaths were
imposed, obliging persons to answer to all questions with∣out
distinction, even tho' they should tend to their own condemnation; and
where every one who refused entire satisfaction to the commissioners,
was impri∣soned, without relief or remedy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p. 474. Townsend, p. 60.</NOTE>.
This motion was seconded by some mem∣bers; but the ministers and privy
counsellors opposed it; and foretold the con∣sequences which ensued.
The Queen sent for the speaker; and after requiring him to deliver
Morrice's bill to her, she told him, that it was in her power to call
Parliaments, in her power to dissolve them, in her power to give assent
or dissent to any determination which they should form: That her
purpose in summoning thi▪ Parliament was twofold, to have laws enacted
for the farther enforcement of uniformity in religion, and to provide for the
defence of the nation, against the exorbitant power of Spain: That these
two points ought, therefore, to be the object of their deliberation: She had
enjoin d them already, by the mouth of the lord keeper, to meddle neither with
matters of state nor of religion; and she wondered how any one could be
so assuming, as to attempt a subject so ex∣pressly contrary to her
prohibition: That she was highly offended with this pre∣sumption; and took
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present opportunity to
reiterate the commands given by the keeper, and to require, that to bill,
regarding other state <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or
re∣formation in causes ecclesiastical, be exhibited in the house: And
that in parti∣cular she charged the speaker upon his allegiance, that if
any such bills were of∣fered, ab olutely to refuse them a r a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, and not so much as per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> them to be <PB N="656" REF="261"/>
debated by the members<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 474, 478. Townsend,
p. 62.</NOTE>. This command from the Queen was submitted to, without farther
question. Morrice was seized in the house by a serjeant at arms,
discharged from his office of chancellor of the dutchy, disabled from any
practice in his profession as a common lawyer, and kept for some years
prisoner in Tilbury castle<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin's
History of the Presbyterians, p. 320.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen having thus expressly pointed out, both what the
house should and should not do, the commons were as obsequious to the
one as to the other of her injunctions. They passed a very severe law
against recusants; such a law as was suited to the persecuting
spirit of Elizabeth, and of that age. It was intitled, An act to retain her
majesty's subjects in their due obedience; and was meant, as the preamble
declares, to obviate such inconveniencies and perils as might grow from the
wicked practices of seditious sectaries and disloyal persons: For
these two species of criminals were always, at that time, confounded
together, as equally dangerous to the peace of society. It was enacted, that
any person, above six∣teen years of age, who obstinately refused,
during the space of a month, to at∣tend the public worship, should be
committed to prison; that, if after being condemned for this offence, he
persist three months in his refusal, he must abjure the realm; and that
if he either refuse this condition, or return after banishment, he is to
suffer capitally as a felon, without benefit of clergy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">35 Eliz. c. 1.</NOTE>. This law bore equally hard upon the
puritans as upon the catholics; and had it not been im∣posed by the Queen's
authority, was probably, in that respect, very much con∣trary to the private
sentiments and inclinations of the majority in the house of commons. Very
little opposition, however, appears there to have been openly made to it<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">After enacting this statute, the clergy, in order
to remove the odium from themselves, often took care that recusants
should be tried by the civil judges at the assizes, rather than by the
ecclesiastical commissioners. Strype's Ann. vol. IV. p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE expences of the war with Spain having reduced the Queen to
great ne∣cessity of a supply, the grant of subsidies seems to have
been the most important business of this Parliament; and it was a
singular mark of the high spirit of Eli∣beth, that, while conscious of a
present dependance on the commons, she opened the session with the
most haughty treatment of them, and covered her weakness under such a
lofty appearance of superiority. The commons readily voted two subsidies
and four fifteenths; but this sum not appearing sufficient to the court, a
very unusual expedient was fallen upon to induce them to make an enlargement
in <PB N="657" REF="262"/> their concession. The peers informed the commons
in a conference, that they could not give their assent to the supply
voted, thinking it too small for the Queen's occasions: They therefore
proposed a grant of three subsidies and six fifteenths, and desired a
conference, in order to persuade the commons to agree to this measure. The
commons, who had acquired the privilege of beginning all bills of subsidy,
took offence at this procedure of the lords, and at first abso∣lutely
rejected the conference: But being afraid, on reflection, that they had, by
this refusal, given offence to their superiors, they both agreed to the
confe∣rence, and afterwards voted the additional subsidy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 18<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 487,

<P>THE Queen, notwithstanding this unusual concession of
the commons, ended the session with a speech, containing some
reprimands to them, and full of the same high pretensions, which she had
assumed at the opening of the Parliament. She took notice, by the mouth of
the keeper, that some members spent more time than was requisite, by
indulging themselves in harangues and reasonings: And she expressed
her displeasure on account of their not paying the due reve∣rence to privy
counsellors, 
<Q REND="inline">"who," she told them, "were not to be
accounted as common knights and burgesses of the house, who are
counsellors but during the Parliament: Whereas, the others are standing
counsellors, and for their wisdom and great service are called to the

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>."</Q> The Queen
also, in her own person, made the Parliament a spirited harangue; in
which she spoke of the justice and moderation of her government,
expressed the small am∣bition she had ever entertained of making
conquests, displayed the just grounds of her quarrel with the King of
Spain, and discovered how little she apprehended the power of that monarch,
even tho' he should make a greater effort than that of his Invincible Armada.

<Q REND="inline">"But I am informed," added she, "that when he
attempted this last invasion, some upon the sea-coasts forsook
their towns, sled up higher into the country, and left all naked and
exposed to his entrance But I swear unto you, by God, if I knew those
persons, or may know of any that shall do so hereafter, I will make them
feel what it is to be so fearful in so urgent a cause<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">D Ewes, p. 466. Townsend, p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>."</Q> By this menace, she probably gave the people to
un∣derstand that she would exercise martial law upon such cowards: For
there was no statute by which a man could be punished for changing his
habitation.</P>
<P>THE King of France, tho' he had hitherto made war on the league
with great bravery and reputation, tho' he had this campaign gained
considerable advan∣tages over them, and tho' he was assisted by a
considerable body of English un∣der <PB N="658" REF="263"/> Norris, who
carried hostilities into the heart of Britanny; was become sensible, that
he never could, by force of arms alone, render himself master of his
king∣dom. The nearer his military successes seemed to approach him to a
full pos∣session of the throne, the more discontent and jealousy
arose among those Ro∣manists who adhered to him; and a party was formed
in his own court to elect some catholic monarch of the royal blood, if he
refused any longer to satisfy them by declaring his conversion. This
excellent prince was far from being a bigot to his sect; and as he esteemed
these theological disputes to be entirely sub∣ordinate to the public
good, he had tacitly determined, from the beginning, to come, some time or
other, to the resolution required of him. He had found, on the death of his
predecessor, that the hugonots, who formed the bravest and most
faithful part of his army, were such determined zealots, that, if he had, at
that time, abjured their faith, they would instantly have abandoned him to
the pre∣tensions and usurpations of the catholics. The more bigoted
catholics, he knew, particularly those of the League, had entertained such
an unsurmountable preju∣dice against his person, and diffidence of his
sincerity, that even his conversion would not reconcile them to his title;
and he must either expect to be entirely excluded the throne, or to be
admitted to it on such terms as would leave him little more than the mere
shadow of royalty. In this delicate situation he had re∣solved to
temporize; to retain the hugonots by continuing the profession of their
religion; to gain the moderate catholics by giving them hopes of his
conversion; to attach both to his person by conduct and success; and he
hoped, either that the animosity of war against the League would make them
drop gradually the question of religion, or that he might, in time, after
some victories over his enemies and some conferences with divines, make
finally, with more decency and dignity, that abjuration, which must have
appeared, at first, both mean and sus∣picious to both parties.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry IV. embraces the catholic
reli∣gion.</NOTE> WHEN the people are attached to any theological tenets,
merely from a general persuasion or prepossession, they are
easily induced, by any motive or authority, to change their faith in these
mysterious subjects; as appears from the example of the English, who,
during some reigns, generally embraced, without scruple, the still
varying religion of their sovereigns. But a nation, like the French, where
principles had so long been displayed as the badges of faction, and where
each party had fortified its belief by an animosity against the other, were
not found so pliable or inconstant; and Henry was at last convinced, that
the ca∣tholics of his party would entirely abandon him, if he gave them not
immediate satisfaction in this particular. The hugonots also, taught by
experience, clearly saw, that his desertion of them was become entirely
necessary for the public <PB N="659" REF="264"/> settlement; and so
general was this persuasion among them, that, the duke of Sully pretends,
even the divines of that party purposely allowed themselves to be overcome
in the disputes and conferences; that the King might more readily be
convinced of the weakness of their cause, and might more cordially and
sincerely, at least more decently, embrace the religion, which it was so
much his interest to believe. If this self-denial, in so tender a point,
should appear in∣credible and supernatural in theologians, it will, at
least, be thought very natural, that a prince, so little instructed in
these points as Henry, and so desirous to preserve his sincerity,
should insensibly bend his opinion to the necessity of his affairs,
and should believe that party to have the best arguments, who could alone
put him in possession of a kingdom. All circumstances, therefore,
being prepared for this great event, that monarch renounced the protestant
religion, and was so∣lemnly received by the French prelates of his party,
into the bosom of the church.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, who was, herself, chiefly attached to the
protestants, by her in∣terests and the circumstances of her birth, and
who seems to have entertained some propensity, during her whole life, to
the catholic superstition, at least, to the antient ceremonies, yet
pretended to be extremely displeased with this abjuration of Henry, and
she wrote him a very angry letter, reproaching him with this interested
change of his religion. Sensible, however, that the League and the King of
Spain were still their common enemies, she hearkened to his apologies;
continued her succours both of men and money; and formed a new league, in
which they mutually stipulated never to make peace but by common
agree∣ment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> THE intrigues of Spain
were not limited to France and England: The never failing pretence of religion,
joined to the influence of money, excited new dis∣orders in Scotland, and
gave fresh alarms to Elizabeth. George Ker, brother to the lord Newbottle,
had been taken, while he was making his passage secretly into Spain; and
some papers were found about him, by which a dangerous con∣spiracy of
some catholic noblemen with Philip was discovered. The earls of Angus,
Errol, and Huntley, the heads of three potent families, had entered into a
confederacy with the Spanish monarch; and had stipulated to raise all
their forces, to join with thirty thousand Spanish troops, which Philip
engaged to send into Scotland; and after re-establishing the catholic
religion in that kingdom, to march with their united power, in order to
effectuate the same purpose in Eng∣land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 391. Rymer, tom. XVI p. 19<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>. Graham of Fintry, who had also entered into
this conspiracy, was taken and arraigned, and executed. Elizabeth sent lord
Borough ambassador into Scotland, and exhorted the King to exercise the
same severity on the three earls, <PB N="660" REF="265"/> to forfeit their
estates, and by annexing them to the crown, both increase his own
demesns, and set an example to all his subjects of the dangers attending
treason and rebellion. This advice was certainly very rational, but not
easy to be executed by the small revenue and limited authority of James. He
desired, therefore, some supply from her of men and money; but tho' she
had reason to esteem the prosecution of the three popish earls a common
cause, he never could obtain the least assistance from her. The tenth
part of the expence, which she be∣stowed in supporting the French King
and the States, would have sufficed to exe∣cute this purpose, more
immediately essential to her security<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>93.
Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 235.</NOTE>: But she seems ever to have borne some
degree of malignity to James, whom she hated, both as her heir, and as the
son of Mary, her hated rival and competitor. So far from giving him
assistance to prosecute the catholic conspirators, she rather
con∣tributed to his inquietude, by countenancing the turbulent disposition
of the earl of Bothwel<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 257,
258.</NOTE>, a nobleman descended from a natural son of James the fifth.
Bothwel more than once attempted to render himself master of the King's
per∣son; and being expelled the kingdom for these traiterous designs, he
took shelter in England, was secretly protected by the Queen, and lurked
near the borders, where his power lay, with a view of still enterprizing
some new violence. He succeeded at last in an attempt on the King; and by
the mediation of the English ambassador, imposed very dishonourable
terms upon that prince: But James, with the authority of the convention of
states, annulled this agreement as im∣posed by violence; again expelled
Bothwel the country; and obliged him to take shelter in England. Elizabeth,
pretending ignorance of the place of his retreat, never executed the treaties,
by which she was obliged to deliver up all rebels and fugitives to the King
of Scotland. During these disorders, encreased by the refractory
disposition of the ecclesiastics, the prosecution of the catholic
earls remained in suspence; <MILESTONE N="1594"/> but at last the
Parliament passed an act of attainder against them, and the King prepared
himself to execute it by force of arms. The noblemen, tho' they obtained a
victory over the earl of Argyle, who acted by the King's commission, found
themselves hard pressed by James himself, and agreed, on certain terms,
to leave the kingdom. Bothwel, being detected in a confederacy with them,
forfeited the favour of Elizabeth, and was obliged to take shelter, first
in France, then in Italy, where he died, some years after, in great
poverty.</P>
<P>THE established authority of the Queen secured her from
all such attempts as James was exposed to from the mutinous disposition
of his subjects; and her ene∣mies <PB N="661" REF="266"/> found no other means
of giving her any domestic disturbance than by such traiterous and
perfidious machinations, as ended in their own disgrace, and in the ruin of
their criminal instruments. Roderigo Lopez, a Jew, domestic phy∣sician to
the Queen, being imprisoned on suspicion, confessed, that he had
received a bribe to poison her from Fuentes and Ibarra, who had succeeded
Parma, lately deceased, in the government of the Netherlands; but he
maintained, that he had no other intention than to cheat Philip of his money,
and never meant to fulfil his promise. He was, however, executed for the
conspiracy; and the Queen complained to Philip of these dishonourable
attempts of his ministers, but could obtain no satisfaction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden. p 577. Birch's Negot p. 15. Bacon, vol. IV. p.

executed for a like conspiracy with Ibarra<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 58<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of revenging herself, by retaliating in this
shameful manner, Eliza∣beth sought a more honourable vengeance, by
supporting the King of France, and assisting him in finally breaking
the force of the League, which, after the con∣version of that monarch, went
daily to decay, and was threatened with speedy ruin and dissolution.
Norris commanded the English forces in Britanny, and as∣sisted at the
taking of Morlaix, Quimpercorentin, and Brest, towns guarded by Spanish
forces in that province. In every action, the English, tho' they had so
long enjoyed domestic peace, discovered a strong military
disposition; and the Queen, tho' herself a heroine, found more frequent
occasion to reprove her ge∣nerals for encouraging their temerity, than for
countenancing their fear or cau∣tion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>. Sir Martin
Forbisher, her brave admiral, perished with many others, be∣fore Brest.
Morlaix had been promised the English for a place of retreat; but the duke
d'Aumont, the French general, eluded this promise by making it be inserted
in the capitulation, that none but catholics should be admitted into that
city.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1595" UNIT="year"/> NEXT campaign, the French
King, who had long carried on hostilities with Philip, was at last
provoked, by the taking of Chatelet and Dourlens, and the attack of Cambray, to
declare war against that monarch. Elizabeth, being threatened with a new
invasion in England, and with an insurrection in Ireland, recalled most
of her forces, and sent Norris to command in this latter kingdom. Finding
also, that the French league was almost entirely dissolved, and that
the most considerable leaders had made an accommodation with their prince,
she thought that he could well support himself by his own force and
valour, and <PB N="662" REF="267"/> she began to be more sparing in his
cause, of the blood and treasure of her subjects.</P>
<P>SOME disgusts, which she had received from the states,
joined to the remon∣strances of her frugal minister, Burleigh, made her
also inclined to diminish her charges on that side; and she even
demanded, by her ambassador, Sir Thomas Bodley, to be reimbursed of all
the money, which she had expended in support∣ing them. The states,
besides alledging the conditions of the former treaty, by which they were not
obliged to repay her, till the conclusion of a peace, pleaded their present
poverty and distress, the great superiority of the Spaniards, and the
difficulty of supporting the war; much more, of saving money to discharge
their incumbrances. After much negotiation, a new treaty was at last formed;
by which the states were bound to free the Queen immediately from the charge
of the English auxiliaries, computed at forty thousand pounds a year, to
pay her annu∣ally twenty thousand pounds for some years, to assist
her with a certain number of ships, and to conclude no peace nor treaty
without her consent. They also bound themselves, on the conclusion of
the peace with Spain, to pay her annu∣ally the sum of an hundred thousand
pounds for four years; but on this condi∣tion, that the payment should be in
lieu of all debts, and that they should be supplied, at their own charges,
with a body of four thousand auxiliaries from England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 586.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1596" UNIT="year"/> THE Queen still retained in
her hands the cautionary towns, which were a great check on the rising power
of the states; and she committed the important charge of Flushing to Sir
Francis Vere, a brave officer, who had been mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h distinguished by his valour in the Low Countries. She gave
this gentleman the preference to Essex, who expected so honourable a
command; and tho' that earl was daily rising both in reputation with the
people, and favour with herself, the Queen, who was commonly reserved in
the advancement of her courtiers, thought proper, on this occasion, to give
him a refusal. Sir Thomas Baskerville was sent over to France at the head
of twenty thousand English, with which Elizabeth, by a new treaty,
concluded with Henry, bound herself to supply that prince. Some
stipulations for mutual assistance were formed by the treaty; and all
the former engagements were renewed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1597" UNIT="year"/> THIS body of English troops
were maintained at the expence of the French King; yet did Henry esteem this
supply of considerable advantage, on account of the great reputation
acquired by the English, in so many fortunate enter∣prizes, 
<PB N="663" REF="268"/> undertaken against the common enemy. In the great
battle of Turn∣hoult, gained this campaign by prince Maurice, the English
auxiliaries under Sir Francis Vere and Sir Robert Sidney had extremely
distinguished themselves; and the fortunate success of that day was
universally ascribed to their discipline and valour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval enter∣prizes.</NOTE> THO' Elizabeth, at
a great expence of blood and treasure, made war against Philip in France
and the Low Countries, the most severe blows, which she gave the
Spanish greatness, were owing to those naval enterprizes, which either
she or her subjects scarce ever intermitted during one season. In
1594, Richard Haw∣kins, son to Sir John, the famous navigator, procured the
Queen's commission, and sailed with three ships to the South Sea by the
straits of Magellan: But his voyage proved unfortunate, and he himself was
taken prisoner on the coast of Chili. James Lancaster was fitted out the
same year with three ships and a pin∣nace by the merchants of London; and
was more fortunate in his adventures. He took thirty-nine ships of the enemy;
and not contented with this success, he made an attempt on Fernambouc in
Brazil, where, he knew, great treasures were at that time lodged. As he
approached the land, he saw it lined with great numbers of the enemy; but
no-wise daunted with this appearance, he placed the stoutest of his men
in boats, and ordered them to row with such violence against the shore as
to split them in pieces. By this bold action, he both deprived his men of all
hopes of returning but by victory, and terrified the enemy, who fled after a
short resistance. He returned home safely with the treasure, which he
had so bravely acquired. In 1595, Sir Walter Raleigh, who had anew for∣feited
the Queen's friendship by an intrigue with one of the maids of honour, and
who had been confined in prison for this misdemeanor, no sooner recovered
his liberty than he was pushed by his active and enterprizing genius to
attempt some great action. The success of the first Spanish
adventurers against Mexico and Peru had begot an extreme avidity in Europe;
and a prepossession univer∣sally took place, that in the inland parts
of South America, called Guiana, a country as yet undiscovered, there were
mines and treasures and riches far beyond any thing which Cortes or Pizarro
had yet met with. Raleigh, whose turn of mind was somewhat romantic and
extravagant, undertook at his own charge the discovery of this wonderful
country. Having taken the small tower of St. Joseph in the isle of
Trinidado, where he found no riches, he left his ship, and sailed up the
river Oroonoko in pinnaces, but without meeting with any thing to answer his
expectations. On his return, he published an account of this country, full of
the greatest and most palpable lies, that were ever attempted to be
imposed on the credulity of mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
584.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="664" REF="269"/> <MILESTONE N="1596" UNIT="year"/> THE
same year, Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins undertook a more important
expedition against the Spanish settlements in America; and they car∣ried
with them six ships of the Queen's and twenty more, which they had either
fitted out at their own charges, or which were furnished them by private
adven∣turers. Sir Thomas Baskerville was appointed commander of the land
forces, which they carried on board with them. Their first design was to
attempt Porto Rico, where, they knew, a rich carrack was at that time
stationed; but as they had not preserved the requisite secrecy, a
pinnace, having strayed from the fleet, was taken by the Spaniards, and
betrayed the intentions of the English. Preparations were made in that
island to receive them; and the English fleet, notwithstanding the brave
assault, which they made on the enemy, was repulsed with loss. Hawkins
soon after died; and Drake pursued his course to Nombre di Dios, on the
isthmus of Darien; where, having landed his men, he attempted to pass
forward to Panama, with a view of plundering that place, or, if he found such
a scheme practicable, of keeping and fortifying it. But he met not with the
same facility, which had attended his first enterprizes on these parts.
The Spaniards, taught by experience, had every where fortified the passes,
and had stationed troops in the woods; which so infested the English by
continual alarms and skirmishes, that they were obliged to return, without
being able to effectuate any thing. Drake himself, from the intemperance of
the climates, from the fatigues of his journey, and from the vexation of his
disappointment, was seized with a distemper, of which he soon after
died. Sir Thomas Baskerville took the command of the fleet, which was in a
very weak condition; and after having sought a battle near Cuba with a
Spanish fleet, of which the event was not decisive, he returned to England.
The Spaniards suffered some loss from this enterprize; but the English
reaped no profit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE bad success of this enterprize in the Indies made the
English rather at∣tempt the Spanish dominions in Europe, where, they heard,
Philip was making great preparations for a new invasion of England. A
powerful fleet was equipped at Plymouth consisting of an hundred and
seventy vessels, seventeen of which were capital ships of war; the
rest tenders and small vessels: Twenty ships were added by the
Hollanders. In this fleet there were computed to be six thousand three
hundred and sixty soldiers, a thousand volunteers, and six thousand
seven hundred and seventy-two seamen, beside the Dutch. The land forces
were com∣manded by the earl of Essex. The navy by lord Effingham, high
admiral. Both these commanders had expended great sums of their own in this
armament: For such was the spirit of Elizabeth's reign. The lord Thomas
Howard, Sir <PB N="665" REF="270"/> <MILESTONE N="1597" UNIT="year"/> Walter
Raleigh, Sir Francis Vere, Sir George Carew, and Sir Coniers Clifford had
commands in this expedition, and were named as a council to the general and
admiral<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 591.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fleet set sail on the first of June 1596; and meeting
with a fair wind, bent their course to Cadiz, at which place, by sealed
orders delivered to all the captains, the general rendesvous was appointed.
They sent before them some armed tenders, which intercepted every ship,
that could carry intelligence to the enemy; and they themselves were so
fortunate when they came near Cadiz, as to take an Irish vessel, by which
they learned, that that port was full of merchant ships of great value, and
that the Spaniards lived in perfect security, without any ap∣prehensions of
an enemy. This intelligence much encouraged the English fleet, and gave them
the prospect of a fortunate issue to the enterprize.</P>
<P>AFTER a fruitless attempt to land at St. Sebastians on the
western side of the island of Cadiz; it was, upon deliberation,
resolved by the council of war to attack the ships and gallies in the bay.
This attempt was esteemed very rash; and the lord admiral himself, who
was cautious in his temper, had entertained great scruples with regard to it:
But Essex strenuously urged the enterprize; and when he found the
resolution at last taken, he threw his hat into the sea, and gave
symp'oms of the most extravagant joy. He felt, however, a great
morti∣fication, when Effingham informed him, that the Queen, who was anxious
for his safety, and who dreaded the effects of his youthful ardour, had
secretly given orders, that he should not be permitted to command the van
in the attack<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 196.</NOTE>. That
duty was performed by Sir Walter Raleigh and the lord Thomas Howard; but
Essex no sooner came within reach of the enemy, than he forgot the
pro∣mise which the admiral had exacted of him to keep in the midst of the
fleet: He broke thro' and pressed forward into the thickest of the fire.
Emulation for glory, avidity of plunder, animosity against the Spaniards,
proved incentives to every one; and the enemy were soon obliged to loose
anchor, and retreat farther into the bay, where they ran many of their ships
aground. Essex then landed his men at the fort of Puntal; and immediately
marched to the attack of Cadiz, which the impetuous valour of the English
soon carried sword in hand. The generosity of Essex, which was not
inferior to his valour, made him soon stop the slaughter, and treat his
prisoners with the greatest humani y, and even assability and
kindness. The English made a rich plunder in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but missed of a much
richer by the resolution, which the duke of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ina, the Spanish admiral took, of setting fire to the ships,
in order to prevent their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 
<PB N="666" REF="271"/> into the hands of the enemy. It was computed, that the
loss, which the Spaniards suffered in this enterprize, amounted to twenty
millions of ducats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol II p.
97.</NOTE>; besides the indignity, which that proud and ambitious people
received, from the taking one of their chief cities, and destroying in their
harbour a fleet of such force and value.</P>
<P>ESSEX, all on fire for glory, regarded this great success
only as a step to fu∣ture atchievements: He insisted on the keeping
possession of Cadiz, and he under∣took with four hundred men and three
months provisions, to defend the place till succours should arrive from
England. But all the other seamen and soldiers were satisfied with the
glory which they had acquired; and were impatient to return home, in order to
secure their plunder. Every other proposal of Essex to annoy the enemy,
met with a like reception; his scheme for intercepting the carracks at the
Azores, for assaulting the Groyne, for taking St. Andero, and St.
Sebastian: And the English, finding so great difficulty to drag this
impatient warrior from the enemy, at last left him on the Spanish coast,
attended with very few ships. He complained much to the Queen, of their want
of spirit in this en∣terprize; nor was she satisfied, that they had
returned without attempting to in∣tercept the Indian fleet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 121.</NOTE>; but the great success in the enterprize
on Cadiz, had covered all their miscarriages: And that princess, tho' she
admired the lofty ge∣nius of Essex, could not forbear expressing an
esteem for the other officers<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
593.</NOTE>. The admiral was created earl of Nottingham; and this promotion
gave great disgust to Essex<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sydney
Papers, vol. II. p. 77.</NOTE>. In the preamble of the patent it was said,
that the new dig∣nity was conferred on him, on account of his good services
in taking Cadiz, and destroying the Spanish ships; a merit which
Essex pretended to belong solely to himself: And he offered to maintain
this plea by single combat against the earl of Nottingham, or his sons,
or any of his kindred.</P>
<P>THE atchievements in the subsequent year proved not so
fortunate; but, as the Indian fleet very narrowly escaped the English,
Philip had still reason to see the great hazard and disadvantage of
that war in which he was engaged, and the su∣periority which the English,
by their naval power, and their situation, had ac∣quired over him. The Queen,
having received intelligence, that the Spaniards, tho' their fleets were so
much shattered and destroyed, by the expedition at Cadiz, were preparing a
squadron at Ferrol and the Groyne, and were marching troops thither, with a
view of making an invasion on Ireland, was resolved to prevent their
enterprize, and to destroy the shipping in these harbours. She prepared a
<PB N="667" REF="272"/> large fleet of a hundred and twenty sail, of which
seventeen were her own ships, forty-three were smaller vessels, and
the rest tenders and victuallers: She em∣barked on board this fleet five
thousand new-levied soldiers, and added a thousand veteran troops, whom
Sir Francis Vere brought from the Netherlands. The earl of Essex, commander
in chief, both of the land and sea forces, was at the head of one squadron:
Lord Thomas Howard was appointed vice-admiral of another; Sir Walter Raleigh of
the third: Lord Mountjoy commanded the land forces under Essex: Vere was
appointed marshal: Sir George Carew lieutenant of the ordnance, and Sir
Christopher Blount first colonel. The earls of Rut∣land and Southampton,
the lords Grey, Cromwel, and Rich, with several other persons of
distinction, attended as volunteers. Essex declared his resolution,
ei∣ther to destroy this new Armada, which threatned England, or to perish
in the attempt.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9th July.</NOTE> THIS powerful fleet set
sail from Plymouth; but were no sooner out of the har∣bour than they met
with a furious storm, which shattered and dispersed them; and before
they could be refitted, Essex found, that their provisions were so far
spent, that it would not be safe to carry so numerous an army along with
him. He dismissed, therefore, all the soldiers, except the thousand
veterans under Vere; and laying aside all thoughts of attacking Ferrol or the
Groyne, he confined the object of his expedition to the intercepting the Indian
fleet; which had at first been considered only as the second enterprize
which he was to attempt.</P>
<P>THE Indian fleet, at that time, by reason of the imperfection
of navigation, had a stated course, as well as season, both in their
going out and in their return; and there were certain islands, at which, as
at fixed stages, they always touched, and where they took in water and
provisions. The Azores, being one of these places where, about this time,
the fleet was expected, Essex bent his course thi∣ther; and he informed
Raleigh, that he, on his arrival, intended to attack Fayal, one of these
islands. By some accident the squadrons were separated; and Ra∣leigh
arriving first before Fayal, thought it more prudent, after waiting some
time for the general, to begin the attack alone, lest the inhabitants
should, by farther delay, have leizure to make greater preparations for their
desence. He succeeded in the enterprize; but Essex, jealous of Raleigh,
expressed great displeasure at this conduct, and construed it as an
intention of robbing the general of the glory which attended that action: He
cashiered, therefore, Sydney, Bret, Berry, and others, who had concuried in
the attempt; and would have proceeded to the same extremity against Raleigh
himself, had not lord Thomas Howard interposed with his good offices, and
persuaded Raleigh, tho' very high-spirited, to make <PB N="668" REF="273"/>
submissions to the general. Essex, who was placable, as well as
hasty and passi∣onate, was soon appeased, and both received Raleigh
into favour, and restored the other officers to their command<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 173.</NOTE>. This incident, however, tho' the quarrel
was seemingly accommodated, laid the first foundation of that violent
animosity which afterwards took place between these two gallant
commanders.</P>
<P>ESSEX made next a disposition proper for intercepting the
Indian galleons; and Sir William Monson, whose station was the most
remote of the fleet, having fallen in with them, made the signals which had
been agreed on. That able offi∣cer here ascribes Essex's failure of
success, when he was so near attaining so migh∣ty an advantage, to his
want of experience in seamanship; and the account which he gives of the
errors committed by that nobleman, appears very reasonable as well as
candid<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 174.</NOTE>. The Spanish
fleet, finding that their enemy was upon them, made all the sail possible
to the Terceras, and got into the safe and well fortified harbour of Angra,
before the English fleet could overtake them. Essex inter∣cepted only
three ships; which, however, were so rich as to pay all the charges of the
expedition.</P>
<P>THE causes of this miscarriage of Essex's enterprize,
were much canvassed in England, upon the return of the fleet; and tho' the
courtiers took party differ∣ently, as they affected either Essex or
Raleigh, the people, in general, who bore an extreme affection to the
gallantry, spirit, and generosity of the former, were inclined to justify
every circumstance of his conduct. The Queen, who loved the one as much as
she esteemed the other, maintained a kind of neutrality, and endeavoured to
share her favours with an impartial hand between the parties. Sir Robert
Cecil, second son to lord Burleigh, was a courtier of very promising
hopes, much connected with Raleigh; and she made him secretary of state,
in∣stead of Sir Thomas Bodley, whom Essex recommended for that office.
But not to disgust Essex by this preference, she promoted him to the
dignity of earl mar∣shal of England, an office which had been vacant ever
since the death of the earl of Shrewsbury. Essex might perceive from
this conduct, that she never in∣tended to give him the entire ascendant
over his rivals, and might learn thence the necessity of moderation and
caution. But his temper was too high for sub∣mission; his behaviour too
open and candid to practice the arts of a court; and his free sallies, while
they rendered him only more amiable in the eyes of good judges, gave his
enemies many advantages against him.</P>

keeper, to inform this assembly of the necessity of a sup∣ply. She
said, that the wars formerly waged in Europe, had commonly been con∣ducted by
the parties without farther view than to gain a few towns, or at most a
province, from each other; but the object of the present hostilities, on
the part of Spain, was no other than utterly to bereave England of her
religion, her li∣berty, and her independance: That these blessings,
however, she had hitherto been enabled to preserve, in spite of the
devil, the pope, and the Spanish tyrant, and all the mischievous designs
of all her enemies: That in this contest she had disbursed a sum
treble to all the parliamentary supplies granted her; and besides expending
her ordinary revenues, had been obliged to sell many of the crown lands: And
that she could not doubt, but her subjects, in a cause where their own
honour and interest were so deeply concerned, would willingly contribute to
such moderate taxations as would be found requisite for their common
defence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 525, 527. Townsend, p.

made by the lords, on a bill sent up by the commons; and these amendments
were wrote on parchment, and returned with the bill to the commons. The lower

this innovation to the peers. The peers replied, that they expected not such
a frivolous objection from the gravity of the house; and that it was not
material, whether the amendments were wrote on parchment or on paper, nor
whether the paper was white, black, or brown. The commons were offended with

<P><MILESTONE N="1598" UNIT="year"/> ELIZABETH had reason to
soresee, that parliamentary supplies would now be∣come more necessary
to her than ever; and that the chief burthen of the war with Spain would
thenceforth lie on England. Henry had received an overture for a peace with
Philip; but before he would proceed to a negociation, he gave intelligence of
it to his allies, the Queen and the States; that, if possible, a
pa∣cification might be made by common consent and agreement. These two
powers sent ambassadors to France, in order to remonstrate against
peace with Spain; the Queen, Sir Robert Cecil, and Henry Herbert; the States,
Justin Nassau, and John Barnevelt. Henry said to these ministers,
that his most early education <PB N="671" REF="276"/> had been amidst war
and danger, and he had passed the whole course of his life either in arms
or in military preparations: That after the proofs which he had given of his
alacrity in the field, no one could doubt, but he would willingly, for his
part, have continued in a course of life, to which he was now habi∣tuated,
till the common enemy was reduced to such a condition as no longer to give
umbrage either to him or to his allies: That no private interest of his own,
not even that of his people, nothing but the most inevitable necessity,
could ever induce him to think of a separate peace with Philip, or make him
embrace measures which were not entirely formed with the approbation of all
his confede∣rates: That his kingdom, torne with the convulsions and civil
wars of near half a century, required some interval of repose, ere it could
reach a condition in which it might sustain itself, much more support
its allies: That after the minds of his subjects were composed to
tranquillity and accustomed to obedience, after his finances were brought
into order, and after agriculture and the arts were re∣stored, France,
instead of being a burthen, as at present, to her confederates, would be
able to lend them effectual succours, and amply to repay them all the
assistance which she had received during her calamities: And that if
the ambi∣tion of Spain would not at present grant them such terms as they
should think reasonable, he hoped, that, in a little time, he should
attain such a situation as would enable him to mediate more effectually,
and with more decisive autho∣rity, in their behalf.</P>
<P>THE ambassadors were sensible, that these reasons
were not feigned; and they therefore remonstrated with the less vehemence
against the measures which, they saw, Henry was determined to pursue.
The States knew, that that monarch was interested never to permit their final
ruin; and having received private assur∣ances, that he would still,
notwithstanding the peace, give them assistance, both of men and money,
they were well pleased to remain on terms of amity with him. His greatest
concern was to give satisfaction to Elizabeth for this breach of treaty. He
had a cordial esteem for that princess▪ a sympathy of manners, and a
gratitude for the extradinary favours which he had received from her, during
his greatest difficulties: And he used every expedient to apologize and
atone for that measure, which necessity extorted from him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of Vervins.</NOTE> But as Spain
refused to treat with the Dutch as a free state, and Elizabeth would not
negociate without her ally, Henry found himself obliged to conclude, at
Vervins, a separate peace, by which he recovered possession of all
the places seized by Spain during the course of the civil wars, and
procured himself leizure to attend to the domestic settle∣ment of his
kingdom. His capacity for the arts of peace were not inferior to his military
talents; and, in a little time, by his frugality, order, and wise
go∣vernment, <PB N="672" REF="277"/> he raised France, from the desolation
and misery in which she was at present involved, to a more flourishing
condition than she had ever before en∣joyed.</P>
<P>THE Queen knew, that it would be also in her power, whenever
she pleased, to conclude the war on equitable terms, and that Philip,
having no pretensions upon her, would be glad to free himself from an enemy
who had foiled him in every contest, and who had it still so much in her
power to make him feel the weight of her arms. Some of her wisest
counsellors, particularly the lord treasurer, advised her to embrace
pacific measures; and set before her the advantages of tranquil∣lity,
security, and frugality, as more considerable than any success which
could attend the greatest victories. But that high-spirited princess,
tho' she was at first averse to the war, seemed now to have attained
such an ascendant over the enemy, that she was unwilling to stop the
course of her prosperous fortune. She consi∣dered, that her situation,
and her past victories, had given her entire security against any
dangerous invasion; and the war must henceforth be conducted by sudden
enterprizes, and naval expeditions, in which she possessed an
undoubted superiority: That the weak condition of Philip in the Indies opened
to her the view of the most desirable advantages; and the yearly return of
his treasure by sea, afforded a continual prospect of important, tho'
more temporary, suc∣cesses: That, after his peace with France, if she
also should consent to an ac∣commodation, he would be able to turn all
his force against the revolted pro∣vinces of the Netherlands, which, tho'
they had surprizingly increased their pow∣er by commerce and good
government, were still unable, if not supported by their confederates, to
maintain the war against so mighty a monarchy: And that as her defence of
that commonwealth was the original ground of the quarrel, it was unsafe, as
well as dishonourable, to abandon their cause, till she had placed them
in a state of greater security.</P>
<P>THESE reasons were frequently inculcated on her by the earl of
Essex, whose passion for glory, as well as his military talents, made
him earnestly desire the continuance of that war from which he expected to
reap so much advantage and distinction. The rivalship between this
nobleman and lord Burleigh, made each of them insist the more
strenuously on his own councils; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> and as Essex's
person was agreeable to the Queen, as well as his advice conformable to her
inclinations, the favourite seemed daily to acquire an ascendant over the
minister. Had he been endowed with caution and self-command, equal to his
shining qualities, he would have so riveted himself in the Queen's
considence, that none of his enemies had ever been able to impeach his
credit: But his lofty spirit could ill submit to that implicit deference
which her temper required, and which she had ever been ac∣customed 
<PB N="673" REF="278"/> to receive from all her subjects. Being once engaged
in a dispute with her, about the choice of a governor for Ireland, he was
so heated in the argu∣ment, that he entirely forgot the rules both of duty
and civility; and turned his back upon her in a contemptuous manner. Her anger,
which was naturally prompt and violent, rose at this provocation; and she
instantly gave him a box in the ear; adding a passionate expression,
suited to his impertinence. Instead of recollecting himself, and making
the submissions due to her sex and station, he clapped his hand on
his sword, and swore he would not bear such usage, were it from Henry
the eighth himself; and, in a great passion, he immediately with∣drew
from court. Egerton, the chancellor, who loved Essex, exhorted him to
repair his indiscretion by proper acknowlegements; and entreated him not to
give that triumph to his enemies, that affliction to his friends, as must
ensue by his supporting a contest with his sovereign, and deserting
the service of his country: But Essex was deeply stung with the
dishonour which he had received; and seem∣ed to think, that an insult
which might be pardoned a woman, was become a mortal affront when it came from
his sovereign. 
<Q REND="inline">"If the vilest of all indignities," said he,
"is done me, does religion enforce me to sue for pardon? Doth God require it?
Is it impiety not to do it? Why? Cannot princes err? Cannot subjects receive
wrong? Is an earthly power infinite? Pardon me, my lord, I can never
subscribe to these principles. Let Solomon's fool laugh when he is
stricken; let those that mean to make their profit of princes, shew no
sense of princes' injuries: Let them acknowlege an infinite
absoluteness on earth, that do not believe an absolute Infiniteness in

oppressing, than I can shew in suffering every thing that can or

makes me a player, and your∣self a looker on: And me a player of my own game,
so you may see more than I: But give me leave to tell you, that since you
do but see and I do suf∣fer, I must of necessity feel more than
you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 234. Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 386.
Speed, p. 877. The whole letter is so curious and so spirited, that the
reader may not be displeased to read it. 
<Q REND="inline">"My very good lord; Tho' there is not that
man this day living, whom I would sooner make judge of any question that
might concern me than yourself, yet you must give me leave to tell you,
that in some cases I must appeal from all earthly judges: And if in any,
then surely in this, when the highest judge
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> earth has imposed on me the
heaviest punishment without trial or hearing. Since then I must either
answer your lordship's argument, or else forsake mine own just
defence. I will force mine aching head to do me service for an hour. I must
first deny my discontent, which was forced, to be an hu∣mourous
discontent; and that it was unseasonable or is of so long continuing,
your lordship should ra∣ther condole with me than expostulate: Natural
seasons are expected here below; but violent and unreasonable storms
come from above: There is no tempest equal to the passionate indignation
of a prince; nor yet at any time so unseasonable as when it sighteth on
those that might expect a harvest of their careful and painful labours. He
that is once wounded, must needs feel smart, till his hurt is cured, or the
part hurt become senseless: But cure I expect none, her majesty's heart
being ob∣durate against me; and be without sense I cannot, being of
flesh and blood. But, say you, I may aim at the end: I do more than aim;
for I see an end of all my fortunes, I have set an end to all my desires.
In this course do I any thing for my enemies? When I was at court, I found
them absolute; and, therefore, I had rather they should triumph alone, than
have me attendant upon their chariots. Or do I leave my friends? When I was a
courtier, I could yield them no fruit of my love unto them; and now, that I am
a hermit, they shall bear no envy for their love towards me. Or do I
forsake myself, because I do enjoy myself? Or do I overthrow my
fortunes, because I build not a fortune of paper walls, which every puff of
wind bloweth down? Or do I ruinate mine ho∣nour, because I leave following
the pursuit, or wearing the false badge or mark of the shadow of honour?
Do I give courage or comfort to the foreign foe, because I reserve myself
to encounter with him? Or because I keep my heart from business, tho' I
cannot keep my fortune from declin∣ing? No, no, my good lord, I give every one
of these considerations its due weight; and the more I weigh them, the more
I find myself justified from offending in any of them. As for the two
last objections, that I forsake my country, when it hath most need of me,
and fail in that indissolu∣ble duty which I owe to my sovereign; I
answer, that if my country had at this time any need of my public service,
her majesty, that governeth it, would not have driven me to a private life. I
am tied to my country by two bonds; one public, to discharge carefully and
industriously that trust which is committed to me; the other private, to
sacrifice for it my life and carcass, which hath been nourished in it. Of
the first I am free, being dismissed, discharged, and disabled by
her majesty: Of the other, nothing can free me but death; and therefore no
occasion of my performance shall sooner offer itself but I shall meet
it half way. The indissoluble duty which I owe unto her majesty, is only
the duty of allegiance, which I never have, nor ever can fail in: The duty of
attendance, is no indissoluble duty. I owe her majesty the duty of an
earl and of lord marshal of England. I have been content to do her majesty
the service of a clerk; but I can never serve her as a villain or a
slave. But yet you say I must give way unto the time. So I do; for now
that I see the storm come, I have put myself into the harbour.
<HI>Sene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> saieth, we must
give way to Fortune: I know that Fort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne is both blind and strong, and therefore I go as far as I can
out of her way You say, the remedy is not to strive: I neither strive nor
seek for remedy. But, you say, I must yield and submit: I can neither
yield myself to be guilty, nor allow the imputation laid upon me to be
just: I owe so much to the Author of all truth, as I can never yield truth
to be falsehood, nor falsehood to be truth. Have I given cause, you
ask; and yet take a scandal when I have done? No: I gave no cause, not
so much as <HI>Fimbria</HI>'s complaint against me; for I did <HI>totum
telum corpore recipere:</HI> Re∣ceive the whole sword into my body. I
patiently bear all, and sensibly feel all that I then received, when this

against Essex, called bold and presumptuous, and derogatory to her

<P><PB N="674" REF="279"/> THIS spirited letter was shown by
Essex to his friends; and they were so im∣prudent as to disperse
copies of it: Yet notwithstanding this additional provoca∣tion, 
<PB N="675" REF="280"/> the Queen's partiality was so prevalent, that she
reinstated him in his for∣mer favour; and her kindness towards him,
appeared rather to have acquired new force from that short interruption of
anger and resentment. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 August.</NOTE> The death of lord Burleigh,
his antagonist, which happened about this time, seemed to ensure him a
constant possession of the Queen's confidence; and nothing indeed but
his own indiscretion could thenceforth have shaken his well established
credit. Lord Burleigh died in an advanced age; and, by a rare fortune, was
equally regretted by his sovereign and the people. He had risen gradually,
from small beginnings, by the mere force of merit; and tho' his authority was
never entirely absolute or uncontrouled with the Queen, he was still,
during a course of near forty years, regarded as her principal minister.
None of her other inclinations or af∣fections could ever overcome her
confidence in so useful a counsellor; and as he had had the generosity
or good sense to pay assiduous court to her, during her sister's
reign, when it was dangerous to appear her friend, she thought herself
bound in gratitude, when she mounted the throne, to persevere in her
attach∣ments to him. He seems not to have possessed any shining
talents of address, eloquence, or imagination; and was chiefly
distinguished by solidity of under∣standing, probity of manners, and
indefatigable application in business: Virtues, which, if they do not
always enable a man to rise to high stations, do certainly qualify him
best for filling them. Of all the Queen's ministers he was the only one who
left a considerable fortune to his posterity; a fortune not acquired by
ra∣pine or oppression, but gained by the regular profits of his offices,
and preserved by frugality.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8 August.</NOTE> THE last act of this
able minister was the concluding a new treaty with the Dutch; who, after
being, in some measure, deserted by the King of France, were glad to
preserve the Queen's alliance, by submitting to any terms which she
pleased to require of them. The debt which they owed the Queen, was now fixed
at eight hundred thousand pounds: Of this sum they agreed to pay, during
the war, thirty thousand pounds a year; and these payments were to continue
till four hundred thousand pounds of the debt should be extinguished.
They engaged also, during the time that England should continue the war
with Spain, to pay the garrison of the cautionary towns. They stipulated,
that, if Spain should invade England, or the isle of Wight, or Jersey or
Scilly, they should assist her with a body of five thousand foot, and
five hundred horse; and that in case she undertook any naval armament
against Spain, they should join an equal number of ships to hers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. XVI. p. 340.</NOTE>. By this treaty the Queen
was eased of an annual charge of an hundred and twenty thousand pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="676" REF="281"/> SOON after the death of Burleigh, the
Queen, who regreted extremely the loss of so wise and faithful a
minister, was informed of the death of her capital enemy, Philip the
second; who, after languishing under many infirmities, ex∣pired in an
advanced age at Madrid. This haughty prince, desirous of an ac∣commodation
with his revolted subjects in the Netherlands, but disdaining to make in
his own name the concessions requisite for that purpose, had
transferred to his daughter, married to the archduke Albert, the property of
the Low Coun∣try provinces; but as it was not expected, that that princess
could have any pos∣terity, and as the reversion, in case of the failure
of her issue, was still▪reserved to the crown of Spain, the States
considered this deed only as the change of a name, and persisted with
equal obstinacy in their resistance to the Spanish arms. The other
states also of Europe made no distinction between the courts of
Brus∣sels and Madrid; and the secret opposition of France, as well as
the avowed force of England, continued to operate against the progress of
Albert, as it had done against that of Philip.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1599" UNIT="year"/> THO' the dominion of the
English over Ireland, had been established above four centuries, it may
safely be affirmed, that their authority had hi∣therto been little more than
nominal. The Irish princes and nobles, di∣vided among themselves, readily
paid the exterior marks of obeisance to a power which they were not able to
resist; but, as no durable force was ever kept on foot to retain them to
their duty, they relapsed still into their former state of indepen∣dance.
Too weak to introduce order and obedience among the rude inhabitants, the
English authority was yet sufficient to check the growth of any
enterprizing genius among the natives: And, tho' it could bestow no true form
of civil govern∣ment, <PB N="677" REF="282"/> it was able to prevent the rise
of any such form, from the internal com∣bination or subjection of the
Irish.</P>
<P>MOST of the English institutions likewise, by which that
island was governed, were to the last degree absurd, and such as no
state before had ever thought of, for the preserving dominion over its
conquered provinces.</P>
<P>THE English nation, all on fire for the project of subduing
France, a project, whose success was the most improbable, and would to
them have proved the most pernicious; neglected all other enterprizes, to
which their situation so strongly in∣vited them, and which, in time,
would have brought them an accession of riches, grandeur, and security.
The small army which they maintained in Ireland, they never supplied
regularly with pay; and as no money could be levied from the island, which
possessed none, they gave their soldiers the privilege of free
quarter upon the natives. Rapine and insolence inflamed the hatred, which
prevailed be∣tween the conquerors and the conquered: Want of security among
the Irish, in∣troducing despair, nourished still farther the sloth,
so natural to that uncultivated people.</P>
<P>BUT the English carried farther their ill-judged tyranny.
Instead of inviting the Irish to adopt the more civilized customs of
their conquerors, they even re∣fused, tho' earnestly sollicited, to
communicate to them the privilege of their laws, and every where marked them
out as aliens and as enemies. Thrown out of the protection of justice, the
natives could find security no where but in force; and flying the
neighbourhood of cities, which they could not approach with safety, they
sheltered themselves in their marshes and forests from the insolence
of their inhuman masters. Being treated like wild beasts, they became
such; and join∣ing the ardor of revenge to their yet untamed barbarity, they
grew every day more intractable and dangerous.</P>
<P>AS the English princes esteemed the conquest of the
dispersed Irish to be more the object of time and patience than the
source of military glory, they willingly delegated that office to private
adventurers, who inlisting soldiers at their own charge, conquered
provinces of that island, which they converted to their own profit. Separate
jurisdictions and principalities were established by these lordly
con∣querors: The power of peace and war was assumed: Military law was
exercised over the Irish, whom they subdued, and, by degrees, over the
English, by whose assistance they conquered: And, after their
dominion had once taken root, deem∣ing the English institutions less
favourable to barbarous empire, they degenerated into mere Irish, and
abandoned the garb, language, manners and laws of their native country.</P>
<P><PB N="678" REF="283"/> BY all this imprudent conduct of England,
the natives of its dependant state, remained still in that abject
condition, into which the northern and western parts of Europe were sunk,
before they received civility and slavery from the refined policy and
irresistible bravery of Rome. Even at the end of the sixteenth cen∣tury,
when every christian nation was cultivating with ardour every civil art of
life, that island, lying in a temperate climate, enjoying a fertile soil,
accessible in its situation, possessed of innumerable harbours,
was still, notwithstanding these ad∣vantages, inhabited by a people,
whose customs and manners approached nearer those of savages than of
barbarians.</P>
<P>AS the brutality and ignorance of the Irish was extreme, they
were sunk below the reach of that curiosity and love of novelty, by which
every other people in Europe had been seized at the beginning of that
century, and which had engaged them in innovations and religious disputes,
with which they were still so violently agitated. The antient
superstition, the practices and observances of their fathers, mingled and
polluted with many wild opinions, still maintained an unshaken em∣pire over
them; and the example alone of the English was sufficient to render the
reformation odious to the prejudiced and discontented Irish. The old
opposition of manners, laws, and interest, was now inflamed by religious
antipathy; and the subduing and civilizing that country seemed to become
every day more difficult and more impracticable.</P>
<P>THE animosity against the English was carried so far by
the Irish, that, in an insurrection, raised by two sons of the earl of
Clanricard, they put to the sword the whole inhabitants of the town of
Athenry, tho' Irish; because they began to conform themselves to
English customs and institutions, and had embraced a more cultivated and
civilized form of life, than had been practised by their bar∣barous
ancestors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 457.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE usual revenue of Ireland amounted only to six thousand
pounds a year<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of the Sydneys, vol. I. p.
86.</NOTE>: The Queen, tho' with much repining<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cox, p. 342. Sydney, vol▪ I p. 85, 200.</NOTE>, commonly
added twenty thousand more, which she remitted from England: And with this
small revenue, a body of one thousand men was supported, which, in
extraordinary emergencies, was augmented to two thousand<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 542. Sydney, vol. I. p. 65, 109, 183, 184.</NOTE>. No
wonder, that a force, so disproportioned to the occasion, instead of
subduing a mutinous kingdom, served rather to pro∣voke the natives, and to
excite those frequent insurrections and rebellions, which still farther
inflamed the animosity between the two nations, and encreased the barbarity
and disorders, to which the Irish were naturally subject.</P>
<P><PB N="679" REF="284"/> IN 1560, Shan O'Neale, or the great
O'Neale, as the Irish called him, be∣cause head of that potent clan,
raised a rebellion in Ulster; and after some skir∣mishes, was
received into favour, upon his submission, and his promise of a more
dutiful behaviour for the future<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 385,
391.</NOTE>. This impunity tempted him to undertake a new insurrection in
1567; but being pushed by Sir Henry Sidney, lord deputy, he retreated into
Clandeboy, and rather than submit to the English, he put him∣self into
the hands of some Scotch islanders, who commonly infested those parts
by their incursions. The Scotch, who retained a quarrel against him on
account of former injuries, violated the laws of hospitality, and murdered
him in a festi∣val, to which they had invited him. He was a man equally noted
for his pride, his violences, his debaucheries, and his hatred of the English
nation. He is said to have put some of his followers to death, because
they endeavoured to introduce the use of bread after the English
fashion<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 409.</NOTE>. Tho' so violent
an enemy to luxury, he was extremely addicted to riot; and was accustomed,
after his intemperance had thrown him into a fever, to plunge his body into
mire, that he might allay the flame, which he had raised by former
excesses<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 409. Cox, p. 324.</NOTE>.
Such was the life led by this haughty barbarian, who scorned the title of
earl of Tyrone, which Elizabeth in∣tended to have restored to him, and who
assumed the rank and appellation of King of Ulster. He used also to
say, that tho' the Queen was his sovereign lady, he never made peace with
her but at her seeking<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 321.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR Henry Sidney was one of the wisest and most active
governors whom Ire∣land had enjoyed for several reigns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 350.</NOTE>; and he possessed his authority
eleven years; during which time, he struggled with many difficulties, and
made some progress in repressing those disorders, which had become
inveterate among that people. The earl of Desmond, in 1569, gave him
disturbance from the hereditary ani∣mosity which prevailed between that
nobleman and the earl of Ormond, who was descended from the only family,
established in Ireland, that had ever steddily maintained its loyalty to
the English crown<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 424.</NOTE>. The
earl of Thomond, in 1570, attempted a rebellion in Connaught, but was obliged
to fly into France, before his designs were ripe for execution. Stukeley,
another fugitive, found such credit with the pope, Gregory the 13th, that he
flattered his holiness with the prospect of making his nephew, Buon
Compagno, King of Ireland; and as it this pro∣ject had already taken effect, he
accepted the title of marquess of Leinster from the new sovereign<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 430. Cox, p. 354.</NOTE>. He passed next
into Spain; and after having received much encouragement and great rewards from
Philip, who intended to make use of him as an instrument to disturb Queen
Elizabeth, he was found to possess <PB N="680" REF="285"/> too little
interest for executing those high promises, which he had made to that
monarch. He retired into Portugal; and following the fortunes of Don
Sebastian, he perished with that gallant prince in his bold but fatal
expedition against the Moors.</P>
<P>LORD Gray succeeded Sydney in the government of Ireland; and,
in 1579, suppressed a new rebellion of the earl of Desmond, tho'
supported by a body of Spaniards and Italians. The rebellion of the Bourks
followed a few years after∣wards; occasioned by the strict and equitable
administration of Sir Richard Bing∣ham, governor of Connaught, who
endeavoured to repress the tyranny of the chieftains over their
vassals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 720.</NOTE>. The Queen, finding
Ireland so burthensome to her, tried several expedients for reducing it
to a state of greater order and sub∣mission. She encouraged the earl of
Essex, father to that nobleman, who was afterwards her favourite, to
attempt the subduing and planting Clandeboy, Ferny and other territories,
part of some late forfeitures: But that enterprize proved unfortunate; and
Essex died of a distemper, occasioned, as is supposed, by the
vexation, which he had conceived, from his disappointments. An university
was founded in Dublin with a view of introducing arts and learning into that
king∣dom, and civilizing the uncultivated manners of the inhabitants<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 566.</NOTE>. But the most unhappy
expedient, employed in the government of Ireland, was that made use of in
1585 by Sir John Perrot, at that time lord deputy: He put arms into the hands
of the Irish inhabitants of Ulster, in order to enable them, without the
assistance of the government, to repress the incursions of the Scotch
islanders, by which these parts were much infested<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nanton's Fragmenta Regalia, p. 203.</NOTE>. At the same time,
the invitations of Philip, joined to their zeal for the catholic religion,
engaged many of the gentry to serve in the Low Country wars; and thus
Ireland, being pro∣vided both of officers and soldiers, of discipline and
arms, became formidable to the English, and was able to maintain a more
regular war against her an∣tient masters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyrone's re∣bellion.</NOTE> HUGH O'Neale,
nephew to Shan O'Neale, had been raised by the Queen to the dignity of earl
of Tyrone; but having murdered his cousin, son to that rebel, and being
acknowledged head of his clan, he preferred the pride of barbarous li∣cence and
dominion, to the pleasures of opulence and tranquillity, and fomented all
those disorders, by which he hoped to weaken or overturn the English
govern∣ment. He was noted for the vices of perfidy and cruelty, so common
among uncultivated nations; and was also eminent for courage, a virtue, which
their disorderly course of life requires, and which, notwithstanding,
being unsupported <PB N="681" REF="286"/> by the principle of honour, is
commonly more precarious among them, than among a civilized people. Tyrone,
actuated by this spirit, secretly fomented the discontents of the
Maguires, Odonnels, O'Rourks, Macmahons, and other rebels; yet trusting to
the influence of his deceitful oaths and professions, he put himself into
the hands of Sir William Russel, who, in the year 1594, was sent over
lord deputy into Ireland. Contrary to the advice and protestation of Sir
Henry Bagnal, marshal of the army, he was dismissed; and returning to
his own coun∣try, he embraced the resolution of raising an open rebellion,
and of relying no longer on the lenity or inexperience of the English
government. He entered into a correspondence with Spain: He procured thence a
supply of arms and ammunition: And having united all the Irish chieftains
in a dependance upon him, he began to be regarded as a formidable enemy.</P>
<P>THE native Irish were so miserably poor, that their
country afforded few other commodities but cattle and oatmeal, which were
easily destroyed or driven away on the approach of the enemy; and as
Elizabeth was averse to the expence requi∣site for supporting her armies,
the English found much difficulty in pushing their advantages, and in
pursuing the rebels into the bogs, woods, and other fastnesses, to
which they retreated. These motives made Sir John Norris, who commanded the
English army, the more ready to hearken to any proposals of accommodation
made him by Tyrone; and after the war was spun out by these artifices for
some years, that gallant Englishman, finding that he had been deceived by
treacherous promises, and that he had performed nothing worthy of his antient
reputation, was seized with a languishing distemper, and died of vexation
and discontent. Sir Henry Bagnal, who succeeded him in the command, was
still more unfortunate. As he advanced to relieve the sort of Black-water,
besieged by the rebels, he was surrounded in disadvantageous ground; his
soldiers, dis¦couraged by their powder's accidentally taking fire, were put
to flight; and, tho' the pursuit was stopt by Montacute, who commanded the
English horse, fifteen hundred men, together with the general himself,
were left dead upon the spot. This victory, so unusual to the Irish,
mightily raised their spirits, sup∣plied them with arms and ammunition,
and exalted the reputation of Tyrone, who assumed the character of the
deliverer of his country, and patron of Irish liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cox, p. 415.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English council were now sensible that the rebellion
in Ireland was come to a dangerous head, and that the former temporizing arts,
of granting truces and pacifications to the rebels, and of allowing them to
purchase pardons by resign∣ing part of the plunder, acquired during their
insurrections, served only to encou∣rage <PB N="682" REF="287"/> the
spirit of mutiny and disorder among them. It was therefore resolved to
push the war by vigorous measures; and the Queen cast her eye on Charles
Blount, lord Mountjoy, as a man, who, tho' hitherto less accustomed to arms
than to books and literature, was endowed, she thought, with talents equal to
that undertaking. But the young earl of Essex, ambitious of glory, and
desirous of obtaining this government for himself, opposed the choice of
Mount∣joy; and represented the necessity of appointing, for that
important employment, some person more experienced in war than this
nobleman, more practised in busi∣ness, and of higher quality and
reputation. By this description, he was under∣stood to mean himself<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 512.</NOTE>; and no sooner was
his desire known, to be possessed of that government, than his
enemies, even more zealously than his friends, con∣spired to render his
wishes effectual. Many of his friends thought, that he ne∣ver should
consent, except for a very short time, to accept of employments which
must remove him from court, and prevent him from cultivating that per∣sonal
inclination, which the Queen so visibly bore him<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cabbasa, p. 79.</NOTE>. His enemies hoped, that if, by his
absence, she had once leizure to forget the charms of his person and
conversation, his impatient and lofty demeanor would soon disgust a
princess, who usually exacted such profound submission and implicit
obedience from all her servants. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Essex sent over to Ireland.</NOTE> But
Essex was incapable of entering into such cautious views; and even
Elizabeth, who was extremely desirous of subdoing the Irish rebels, and
who was much prepossessed in favour of Essex's genius, readily
agreed to appoint him governor of Ireland, under the title of lord lieutenant.
The more to en∣courage him in his undertaking, she granted him by his patent
more extensive authority than had ever before been conferred on any
lieutenant; the power of carrying on or finishing the war as he pleased, of
pardoning the rebels, and of filling all the most considerable employments
of the kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 366.</NOTE>. And to
ensure him of success, she levied a numerous army of sixteen
thousand foot and thir∣teen hundred horse, which she afterwards augmented
to twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse: A force, which, it was
apprehended, would be able, in one campaign, to overwhelm the rebels, and make
an entire conquest of Ire∣land. Nor did Essex's enemies, the earl of
Nottingham, lord admiral, Sir Ro∣bert Cecil, secretary, Sir Walter Raleigh,
and lord Cobham, throw any obstacles in the way of these preparations; but
hoped, that the higher the Queen's ex∣pectations were raised of success,
the more difficult it would be for the event to correspond to them. In a like
view, they rather seconded, than opposed, those exalted encomiums, which
Essex's numerous and sanguine friends dispersed, of 
<PB N="683" REF="288"/> his high genius, of his elegant endowments, his heroic
courage, his unbounded generosity, and his noble birth; nor were they
displeased to observe that pas∣sionate fondness, which the people
every where expressed for this nobleman. These artful politicians had
studied his character; and finding, that his open and undaunted spirit, if
taught temper and reserve from opposition, must become in∣vincible, they
resolved rather to give full breath to those sails, which were al∣ready
too much expanded, and to push him upon dangers, of which he seemed to make
such small account<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden. Osborne, p
371.</NOTE>. And the better to make advantage of his indis∣cretions, spies
were set upon all his actions and even expressions; and his vehe∣ment
spirit, which, while he was in the midst of the court and environed by his
rivals, was unacquainted with disguise, could not fail, after he thought
himself surrounded by none but friends, to give a pretence for malignant
suspicions and constructions.</P>
<P>Essex left London in the month of March, attended by the
acclamations of the populace, and what did him more honour, accompanied by a
numerous train of nobility and gentry, who, from affection to his person, had
attached them∣selves to all his fortunes, and proposed to acquire fame and
military experience under so renowned a commander. The first act of
authority, which he exercised, after his arrival in Ireland, was an
indiscretion, but of the generous kind; and in both these respects,
suitable to his character. He appointed his intimate friend, the earl of
Southampton, general of the horse; a nobleman, who had displeased the
Queen by secretly marrying without her consent, and whom she had
therefore enjoined Essex not to employ in any command under him. She no
sooner heard of this instance of disobedience than she reprimanded him,
and ordered him to recal his commission to Southampton. But Essex, who
had imagined, that some reasons, which he opposed to her first
injunctions, had convinced her, had the imprudence to remonstrate against
these second orders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II p.
421, 451</NOTE>; and it was not till she reiterated her commands, that he
could be prevailed on to displace his friend.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His ill success.</NOTE> ESSEX, on his
landing at Dublin, had deliberated with the Irish council, con∣cerning the
proper methods of carrying on war against the rebels; and here he was guilty
of a capital error, which was the ruin of his enterprize. He had al∣ways, while
in England, blamed the conduct of former commanders, who art∣fully protracted
the war, who harrassed their troops in small enterprizes, and who, by
agreeing to truces and temporary pacifications with the rebels, had given them
leizure to recruit their broken forces<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bacon, vol. IV. p.
512.</NOTE>. In conformity to these views, he <PB N="684" REF="289"/> had ever
insisted upon leading his forces immediately into Ulster against
Tyrone, the capital enemy; and his instructions had been drawn agreeable to
these his de∣clared intentions and resolutions. But the Irish
counsellors persuaded him, that the season was too early for the
enterprize, and that as the morasses, in which the Irish usually
sheltered themselves, would not, as yet, be penetrable to the English
forces, it would be better to employ the present time in an expedition into
Mun∣ster. Their secret reason for this advice was, that many of them
possessed estates in that province, and were desirous to have the
enemy dislodged from their neigh∣bourhood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's
Memoirs, vol. II. p 448.</NOTE>: But the same selfish spirit, which had
induced them to give this council, made them soon after disown it, when
they found the bad consequences with which it was attended<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 140.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ESSEX obliged all the rebels of Munster either to submit or
to fly into the neighbouring provinces: But as the Irish, from the
greatness of the Queen's preparations, had concluded, that she intended to
reduce them to total subjection, or even utterly to exterminate them, they
considered their present defence as a common cause; and the English
forces were no sooner withdrawn, than the in∣habitants of Munster
relapsed into rebellion, and renewed their confederacy with their other
countrymen. The army, meanwhile, by the fatigue of long and te∣dious marches,
and by the influence of the climate, was become extreme sickly; and on their
return to Dublin, about the middle of July, were suprizingly di∣minished in
number. Their courage was even much abated: For tho' they had prevailed in
some lesser enterprizes, as against the lord Cahir and others; yet had
they sometimes met with a more stout resistance than they expected from
the Irish, whom they were wont to despise; and as they were raw troops
and unex∣perienced, a considerable body of them had been put to flight at the
Glins, by an inferior number of the enemy: Essex was so enraged at this
misbehaviour, that he cashiered all the officers, and decimated the private
men<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cox, p. 421.</NOTE>. But this in∣stance of
severity, tho' necessary, had intimidated the soldiers, and had
encreased their aversion to the present service.</P>
<P>THE Queen was extremely disgusted, when she heard, that
so considerable a part of the season was consumed in these
frivolous enterprizes; and was still more surprized, that Essex
persevered in the same practice, which he had so much condemned in
others, and which he knew to be so much contrary to her purpose and
intention. That nobleman, in order to give his troops leizure to recruit from
their sickness and fatigue, marched with a small body of fifteen hundred
men into the county of Ophelie against the O'Connors and O'Mores, 
<PB N="685" REF="290"/> whom he forced to a submission: But on his return
to Dublin, he found the army so extremely diminished, that he wrote to the
English council an account of his condition, and informed them, that if he
received not immediately a reinforcement of two thousand men, it would be
impossible for him this season to attempt any thing against Tyrone.
That there might be no pretence for farther inactivity, the Queen immediately
sent over the number demanded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol.
II. p. 430. Cox, p. 421.</NOTE>; and Essex began at last to assemble
his forces for the expedition into Ulster. The army was so ex∣tremely
averse to this enterprize, and terrified with the reputation of Tyrone, that
many of them counterfeited sickness, many of them deserted<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 112, 113.</NOTE>; and
Essex found, that after leaving the necessary garrisons, he could
scarce lead four thou∣sand men against the rebels. He marched, however,
with this small army; but was soon sensible, that, in so advanced a
season, it would be impossible for him to effectuate any thing
against an enemy, who, tho' superior in number, were determined to avoid
every decisive action. He hearkened, therefore, to a mes∣sage sent him
by Tyrone, who desired a conference; and a place, near the two camps, was
accordingly appointed. The generals met without any of their at∣tendants, and a
river ran between them, into which Tyrone entered to the depth of his saddle:
But Essex stood on the opposite bank. After half an hour's con∣ference,
where Tyrone behaved with great submission and respect to the lord
lieutenant, a cessation of arms was concluded to the first of May,
renewable from six weeks to six weeks; but which might be broke off by
either party upon a fortnight's warning<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
125.</NOTE>. Essex also received from Tyrone proposals for a peace, in
which that rebel had inserted many unreasonable and exorbitant conditions:
And there appeared afterwards some reason to suspect, that he had here
com∣menced a very unjustifiable correspondence with the enemy<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 307. State Trials. Bacon, vol.
IV. p. 514, 535, 537.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SO unexpected an issue of an enterprize, the greatest and
most expensive which Elizabeth had ever undertaken, provoked her extremely
against Essex; and this disgust was much augmented by other
circumstances of that nobleman's con∣duct. He wrote many letters to the Queen
and council, full of peevish and impatient expressions; complaining of
his enemies, lamenting that their calum∣nies should be believed against
him, and discovering symptoms of a mind, equally haughty and
discontented. She took care to inform him of her dis∣satisfaction; but
commanded him to remain in Ireland till farther orders.</P>
<P>ESSEX heard at once of Elizabeth's anger, and of the promotion
of his ene∣my, Sir Robert Cecil, to the office of master of the wards, an
office which he <PB N="686" REF="291"/> himself aspired to: And dreading,
that, if he remained any longer absent, the Queen would be totally alienated
from him, he hastily embraced a resolution, which, he knew, had once
succeeded with the earl of Leicester, the former fa∣vourite of Elizabeth.
Leicester being informed, while in the Low Countries, that his mistress
was extremely displeased with his conduct, disobeyed her orders by coming
over into England; and having pacified her by his presence, by his apologies,
and by his flattery and insinuation, disappointed all the expectations of
his enemies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 453.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to England.</NOTE> Essex,
therefore, weighing more the similarity of circum∣stances than the
difference of characters between himself and Leicester, immedi∣ately set
out for England; and making speedy journeys, he arrived at court be∣fore any
one was in the least apprized of his intentions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 118.</NOTE>. Tho' besmeared with dirt and
sweat, he hastened up stairs to the presence chamber, thence to the
privy chamber; nor stopped till he was in the Queen's bed chamber, who was
newly risen, and was sitting with her hair about her face. He threw
himself on his knees, kissed her hand, and had some private conference
with her; where he was so graciously received, that on his departure he was
heard to express great satisfaction, and to thank God, that, tho' he had
suffered much trouble and many storms abroad, he found a sweet calm at
home<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p.
127.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But this placability of Elizabeth was merely the result of her
surprize, and of the momentary satisfaction, which she felt on the
sudden and unexpected ap∣pearance of her favourite: After she had found
leizure for recollection, all his faults recurred to her memory; and she
thought it necessary by some severe dis∣cipline, to subdue this
haughty and imperious spirit, who, presuming on her partiality and
indulgence, had pretended to domineer in her councils, to engross all her
favour, and to act in the most important affairs, without regard to her
orders and instructions. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is disgraced.</NOTE> When Essex waited
on her in the afternoon, he found her extremely altered in her carriage towards
him: She ordered him to be con∣sined to his chamber; to be twice examined by
the council; and tho' his answers were calm and submissive, she
committed him to the custody of the lord keeper, Egerton, and held him
sequestered from all company, even from that of his countess, nor was
so much as the intercourse of letters permitted between them. Essex
dropped many expressions of humiliation and sorrow, none of resentment:
He prosessed an entire submission to the Queen's will: Declared his
intention of retiring into the country, and of leading thenceforth a private
life, remote from courts and business: But tho' he assected to be so
entirely cured of his aspiring <PB N="687" REF="292"/> ambition, the vexation
of this disappointment, and of the triumph gained by his enemies, preyed upon
his haughty spirit; and he sell into a distemper, which seemed to put
his life in hazard.</P>
<P>THE Queen had always declared to all the world, and even to the
earl himself, that the purpose of her severity was to correct, not to
ruin him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, p. 444, 445. Sydney Papers,
vol. II. p. 106.</NOTE>; and when she heard of his condition, she was not a
little alarm d with the danger. She ordered eight physicians of the best
reputation and experience to consult of his case; and being informed, that
the issue was much to be apprehended, she sent Dr. James to him with
some broth, and desired that physician to deliver him a message,
which she probably deemed of still greater virtue; that, if she thought
such a step con∣sistent with her honour, she would herself pay him
a visit. The by standers, who carefully observed her countenance,
remarked, that in pronouncing these words, her eyes were suffused with
tears<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sydney Letters, vol. II. p.
151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN these symptoms of the Queen's returning affection
toward's Essex were known, they gave a sensible alarm to the faction
which had declared their oppo∣sition to him. Sir Walter Raleigh, in
particular, the most violent as well as the most ambitious of his enemies,
was so affected with the appearance of that sud∣den revolution, that he was
seized with sickness in his turn, and the Queen was obliged to apply the
same salve to his wound, and to send him a favourable message,
expressing her desire of his recovery<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 139.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1600" UNIT="year"/> THE medicine which the Queen
administered to these aspiring rivals, was suc∣cessful with both; and
Essex, being now allowed the company of his countess, and having
entertained more promising hopes of his future fortunes, was so much
restored in his health, as to be thought past all danger. A belief was
infused into into Elizabeth, that his distemper had been entirely
counterseit, in order to move her compassion<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 153.</NOTE>; and she relapsed into her former rigour
against him. He wrote her a letter, and sent her a rich present on
New-Year's day; as was usual among the courtiers of that time: She read the
letter, but rejected the present<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p 155,
156.</NOTE>. After some interval, however, of severity; she allowed him
to retire to his own house▪ And tho' he remained still under
custody, and was sequestered from all company, he was so grateful for
this mark of lenity, that he sent her a letter of thanks on the occasion. 
<Q REND="inline">"This farther degree of goodness," said he,
"doth sound in mine ears, as if your majesty spake these words, <HI>Die
not Essex; for tho' I punish thine offence, and humble thee for thy good,
yet will I one day be served again by</HI> <PB N="688" REF="293"/>
<HI>thee.</HI> My prostrate soul makes this answer. <HI>I hope for that
blessed day.</HI> And in expectation of it, all my afflictions of body or
mind are humbly, patiently, and chearfully borne by me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, p. 444.</NOTE>."</Q> The countess of Essex,
daughter of Sir Fran∣cis Walsingham, possessed, as well as her
husband, a very refined taste in litera∣ture; and the chief consolation
which Essex enjoyed, during this period of anxi∣ety and expectation,
consisted in her company, and in reading with her those in∣structive
and entertaining authors which, even during the time of his greatest
prosperity, he had never entirely neglected.</P>
<P>THERE were several incidents which kept alive the Queen's
anger against Essex. Every account which she received from Ireland,
convinced her more and more of his misconduct in that government, and of the
insignificant purposes to which he had employed so much force and
treasure. Tyrone, so far from being quelled, had thought proper, in less
than three months, to break the truce, and joining with O Donel, and other
rebels, had over-run almost the whole kingdom. He boasted, that he was
certain of receiving a supply of men, money, and arms from Spain: He
pretended to be champion of the catholic religion: And he loudly exulted in the
present of a phaenix plume, which the pope, Clement the eighth, in order to
encourage him in the prosecution of so good a cause, had con∣secrated,
and had conferred upon him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
617.</NOTE>. The Queen, that she might check his progress, returned to her
former intention, of appointing Mountjoy lord-deputy; and tho' that nobleman,
who was an intimate friend of Essex, and desired his re∣turn to the
government of Ireland, did at first very earnestly excuse himself, on
account of his bad state of health, she obliged him to accept of that
employment. Mountjoy found the island almost in a desperate situation;
but being a man of capacity and vigour, he was so little discouraged, that
he immediately advanced against Tyrone in Ulster. He penetrated into the
heart of that country, the chief seat of the rebels: He fortified Derry and
Mount-Norris, in order to bridle the Irish: He chaced them from the field,
and obliged them to take shelter in the woods and morasses: He employed,
with equal success, Sir George Carew in Munster: And by these
promising successes, he gave new life to the Queen's au∣thority in that
country.</P>
<P>AS the comparison of Mountjoy's administration with that of
Essex, contri∣buted to alienate her from her favourite, she received
additional disgust from the partiality of the people, who,
prepossessed with an extravagant idea of Essex's merit, complained
of the injustice which was done him, by his removal from court, and by his
consinement. Libels were secretly dispersed against Cecil and 
<PB N="689" REF="294"/> Raleigh, and all his enemies. And his popularity, which
was always great, seemed rather to be increased than diminished by his
misfortunes. Elizabeth, in order to justify to the public her conduct with
regard to him, had often taken the resolution of having him tried in the
star-chamber, for his offences: But her tenderness for him prevailed at
last over her severity; and she was contented to have him only examined
by the privy-council. The attorney-general, Coke, opened the cause against
him, and treated him with the cruelty and insolence which that great lawyer
usually exercised against the unfortunate. He displayed, in the
strongest colours, all the faults committed by Essex in his
administration of Ireland: His making Southampton general of the horse,
contrary to the Queen's injunctions; his deserting the enterprize against
Tyrone, and marching to Leinster and Munster; his conferring knighthood on
too many persons; his secret conference with Tyrone; and his sudden
return from Ireland, in contempt of her majesty's commands. He also
exaggerated the indignity of the conditions which Tyrone had been allowed to
propose; odious and abominable conditions, said he; a public toleration of
an idolatrous religion, pardon for himself and every traitor in Ireland, and
full restitution of lands and possessions to all of them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 449.</NOTE>. The
sollicitor-general, Fleming, insisted upon the wretched situation in
which the earl had left that kingdom; and Francis Bacon, son to Sir Nicholas
Bacon, who had been lord keeper in the beginning of the present reign,
closed the charge with displaying the undutiful expressions contained
in some letters wrote by the earl.</P>
<P>ESSEX, when his turn came to plead in his own behalf, renounced,
with great submission and humility, all pretensions to an apology<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 200.</NOTE>; and
declared his reso∣lution never, on this or any other occasion, to have any
contest with his sovereign. He said, that having severed himself from
the world, and abjured all sentiments of ambition, he had no scruple to
confess every failing or error into which his youth, folly, or manifold
infirmities might have betrayed him; that his inward sorrow for his offences
against her majesty was so profound, that it exceeded all his outward
crosses and afflictions, nor did he retain any scruple of submitting to
a public confession of whatever she had been pleased to impute to him;
that in his acknowlegements he retained only one reserve, which he never
would relinquish but with his life, the assertion of a loyal and
unpolluted heart, of an unfeigned af∣fection, of an earnest desire ever to
perform to her majesty the best service which his poor abilities would
permit; and that if this sentiment was recognized by the council, he
willingly acquiesced in any condemnation or sentence which 
<PB N="690" REF="295"/> they could pronounce against him. This
submission was uttered with so much eloquence, and in so pathetic a
manner, that it drew tears from many of the spectators<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 200, 201.</NOTE>. All the
privy-counsellors, in giving their judgment, made no scru∣ple of doing the
earl justice, with regard to the loyalty of his intentions. Even Cecil, whom
he believed his capital enemy, treated him with regard and hu∣manity. And the
sentence given by the lord keeper, (to which the council as∣sented) was
in these words. 
<Q REND="inline">"If this cause," said he, "had been heard in
the Star-chamber, my sentence must have been for as great a fine as ever
was set upon any man's head in that court, together with perpetual
confinement in that prison which belongeth to a man of his quality, the
Tower. But since we are now in another place, and in a course of favour, my
censure is, that the earl of Essex is not to execute the office of a
counsellor, nor that of earl mar∣shal of England, nor of master of the
ordinance; and to return to his own house, there to continue a prisoner,
till it shall please her majesty to release this and all the rest of
his sentence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 454.
Cam∣den, p 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, 627.</NOTE>."</Q>
The earl of Cumberland made a slight opposition to this sentence; and
said, that if he thought it would stand, he would have required a little
longer time to deliberate, that he thought it somewhat se∣vere, and that
any commander in chief might easily incur a like penalty. But, however, added
he, in confidence of her majesty's mercy, I agree with the rest. The earl
of Worcester delivered his opinion in a couple of Latin verses, imply∣ing,
that, where the Gods are offended, even misfortunes ought to be imputed as
crimes, and that accident is no excuse for transgressions against the
Divinity.</P>
<P>BACON, so much distinguished afterwards by his high
offices, and still more by his profound genius for the sciences, was nearly
allied to the Cecil family, being nephew to lord Burleigh, and cousin-german
to the secretary: But notwithstand∣ing his extraordinary talents, he had
met with so little protection from his power∣ful relations, that he had not
yet obtained any preferment in the law, which was his profession. But
Essex, who could distinguish merit, and who passionately loved it,
had entered into an intimate friendship with Bacon; had zealously
at∣tempted, tho' without success, to procure him the office of Queen's
sollicitor; and in order to comfort his friend under the disappointment,
had conferred on him a present of land to the value of eighteen hundred
pounds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 78.</NOTE>. The public could
ill excuse Bacon's appearance before the council, against so munificent a
benefactor; tho' he acted in obedience to the Queen's orders: But she was
so well pleased with his behaviour, that she imposed on him a new
task, of drawing <PB N="691" REF="296"/> a narrative of that day's
proceedings, in order to satisfy the nation of the justice and lenity of
her conduct. Bacon, who wanted firmness of character, more than humanity,
gave to the whole transaction the most favourable turn for Essex; and,
in particular, painted out, in elaborate expression, the dutiful
sub∣mission which that nobleman discovered in the defence which he made
for his con∣duct. When he read the paper to her, she smiled at that
passage, and observed to Bacon, that old love, she saw, could not
easily be forgotten. He replied, that he hoped she meant that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> herself<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 83.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the world, indeed expected, that Essex would soon be
reinstated in his former credit<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol.

inclination, would acquire an additional ascendant with the Queen, and after
all his dilgraces, would again appear more a favourite than ever. They were
confirmed in this hope, when they saw, that tho' he was still prohibited to
appear at court<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II p 162.</NOTE>,
he was continued in his office of master of horse, and was restored to
his liberty, and that all his friends had access to him. Essex himself
seemed determined to per∣severe in that conduct which had hitherto been
so successful, and which the Queen, by all this discipline, had
endeavoured to render habitual to him: He wrote to her, that he kissed her
majesty's hands, and the rod with which she had corrected him; but that he
could never recover his usual chearfulness, till she deigned to admit him
to that presence which had ever been the chief source of his happiness
and enjoyment: And that he had now resolved to make amends for his past
er∣rors, to retire into a country solitude, and to say with Nebuchadnezzar,

<Q REND="inline">"Let my dwelling be with the beasts of the
field; let me eat grass as an ox, and be wet with the dew of heaven; till it
shall please the Queen to restore me to my understanding."</Q> The
Queen was much pleased with these sentiments, and re∣plied, that she
heartily wished his actions might correspond to his expressions; that
he had tried her patience a long time, and it was but just she should now
make some experiment of his submission; that her father would never
have par∣doned so much obstinacy; but that, if the furnace of affliction
produced such good effects, she should ever after have the better opinion
of her chemistry<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 628.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE earl of Essex possessed a monopoly of sweet
wines; and as his patent was near expiring, he patiently expected that the
Queen would renew it, and consi∣dered this event as the critical
circumstance of his life, which would determine whether he could ever hope to
be reinstated in credit and authority<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Birch's
Memoris vol II p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. But
Eli∣zabeth, tho' gracious in her demeanor, was of a temper somewhat haughty
and <PB N="692" REF="297"/> severe; and being continually surrounded with
Essex's enemies, means were found to persuade her, that his lofty
spirit was not yet sufficiently humbled, and that he must undergo this
farther trial, before he could again be safely received into favour. She
therefore refused his demand; and even added, in a contemptuous stile, that
an ungovernable beast must be stinted in his provender<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Camden. p. 628.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His intrigues.</NOTE> THIS rigour, pushed
one step too far, proved the final ruin of this young no∣bleman, and was the
source of infinite sorrow and vexation to the Queen herself. Essex,
who had with great difficulty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
long subdued his proud spirit, and whose patience was now exhausted,
imagining that the Queen was entirely inexorable, burst at once all
restraints of submission and of prudence, and was determined to seek
relief, by proceeding to the utmost extremities against his enemies. Even
during his greatest favour he had ever been accustomed to carry matters
with a high hand against his sovereign; and as this practice gratified his
own temper, and was sometimes successful, he had imprudently imagined,
that it was the only proper method of managing her<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 79.</NOTE>: But being now reduced to de∣spair, he
gave entire reins to his violent disposition, and threw off all appear∣ance
of duty and respect. Intoxicated with the general favour which he al∣ready
possessed, he practised anew every art of popularity; and endeavoured
to increase the general good-will by an hospitable manner of life, little
suited to his situation and his circumstances. His former employments had
given him great connections with gentlemen of the military profession; and
he now entertained; by additional caresses and civilities, a friendship
with all desperate adventurers▪ whose attachment, he hoped, might, in
his present views, prove serviceable to him. He secretly courted the
confidence of the catholics; but his chief trust lay in the puritans, whom he
openly caressed, and whose manners he seemed to have entirely adopted.
He engaged the most celebrated preachers of that sect to resort to
Essex-house; he had daily prayers and sermons in his family; and he
invited all the zealots in London to attend those pious exercises. Such was
the disposition now beginning to prevail among the English, that,
instead of feast∣ing, and public spectacles, the methods anciently
practised in commonwealths to gain the populace, nothing so effectually
ingratiated an ambitions leader with the public, as these fanatical
entertainments. And as the puritanical preachers fre∣quently inculcated in
their sermons the doctrine of resistance to the civil magi∣strate, they
prepared the minds of their hearers for those purposes which Essex was
secretly contriving<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 463.

<P><PB N="693" REF="298"/> BUT the most pernicious imprudence of
this nobleman proceeded from the openness of his temper, by which he was ill
qualified to suceeed in such difficult and dangerous projects. He indulged
himself in great liberties of speech, and was even heard to say of the
Queen, that she was now grown an old woman, and was become as crooked in her
mind as in her body<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 629. Osborne,

her beauty; nor had all her good sense been able to cure her of this
preposterous infirmity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Most of Queen Elizabeth's
courtiers feigned love and desire towards her, and addressed themselves
to her in the stile of passion and gallantry. Sir Walter Raleigh, having
fallen into disgrace, wrote the following letter to his friend Sir Robert
Cecil, with a view, no doubt, of having it shewn to the Queen. 
<Q REND="inline">"My heart was never broke till this day, that
I hear the Queen goes away so far off, whom I have followed so many years,
with so great love and desire, in so many journeys, and am now left
behind her in a dark prison all alone. While she was yet near at hand, that
I might hear of her once in two or three days, my sorrows were the less;
but even now my heart is cast into the depth of all misery. I, that was
wont to behold her riding like <HI>Alexander,</HI> hunting like <HI>Diana,</HI>
walking like <HI>Venus,</HI> the gentle wind blowing her fair hair about her
pure cheeks, like a nymph, sometimes sitting in the shade like a
Goddess, sometimes singing like an angel, sometimes playing like

me of all. O glory that only shineth in misfortune, what is become of thy
assurance? All wounds have scars but that of fantasie: All affections

adversity, or when is grace wit∣nessed but in offences? There were no
divinity but by reason of compassion: For revenges are brutish and
mortal. All those times past, the loves, the sighs, the sorrows, the
desires, cannot they weigh down one frail misfortune? Cannot one drop of gall
be hid in so great heaps of sweetness. I may then conclude, <HI>Spes

therefore what you list. I am more weary of life than they are desirous I

too happily born."</Q> <HI>Murdin,</HI> 657. It is to be remarked, that this
Nymph, Venus, Goddess, Angel, was now about sixty. Yet five or six years
after, she allowed the same lan∣guage to be used to her. Sir Henry Unton,
her ambassador in France, relates to her a conversation which he had with
Henry the fourth. The monarch, after having introduced Unton to his address,
the fair Gabriell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, asked him how
he liked her. 
<Q REND="inline">"I answered sparingly in her praise,"
said the mini∣ster, "and told him, that if, without offence, I might
speak it, I had the picture of a far more excel∣lent mistress, and yet
did her picture come far short of her perfection of beauty. As you love me,
said he, shew it me, if you have it about you. I made some difficulties;
yet upon his importunity offered it to his view very secretly, holding it
still in my hand: He beheld it with passion and ad∣miration, saying,
that I had reason, <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me

had never seen the like; so, with great reverence, he kissed it twice

contention, he took it from me, vowing, that I might take my leave of it: For
he would not forgo it for any treasure: And that to possess the favour
of the lively picture, he would forsake all the world, and hold himself
most happy; with many other most passionate speeches."</Q>

<P><PB N="694" REF="299"/> THERE was another expedient of Essex,
which, if possible, was more provoking to the Queen than those
sarcasms on her age and deformity; and that was, his se∣cret applications
to the King of Scots, her heir and successor. That prince had this year
very narrowly escaped a dangerous, tho' ill formed, conspiracy of the earl
of Gowry; and even his delivery was attended with this disagreeable
cir∣cumstance, that the obstinate ecclesiastics persisted, in
spite of the most incon∣testible evidence, to maintain to his face, that
there had been no such conspiracy. James, harrassed with his turbulent
and factious subjects, cast a wistful eye to the succession of
England; and in proportion as the Queen advanced in years, his de∣sire
increased of mounting that throne, on which, besides acquiring a great
addi∣tion of power and splendor, he hoped to govern a people, so much more
tractable and submissive. He negociated with all the courts of Europe, in
order to en∣sure himself friends and partizans: He even neglected not the
court of Rome and that of Spain; and tho' he engaged himself in no positive
promise, he flat∣tered the catholics with hopes, that, in case of his
succession, they might expect some more liberty than what was at
present indulged them. Elizabeth was the only sovereign in Europe to whom
he never dared to mention his right of succession: He knew, that tho' her
great age might now invite her to think of fixing an heir to the crown, she
never could bear the prospect of her own death without hor∣ror, and was
determined still to retain him, and all other competitors, in an en∣tire
dependance upon her.</P>
<P>ESSEX was descended by females from the royal family; and
some of his sanguine partizans had been so imprudent as to mention his
name among those of other pretenders to the crown; but the earl took care, by
means of Henry Lee, whom he secretly sent into Scotland, to assure
James, that, so far from entertaining such ambitious views, he was
determined to use every expedient for extorting an immediate declaration in
favour of this monarch's right of succession. James willingly hearkened
to this proposal; but did not approve of the violent me∣thods which Essex
intended to employ. Essex had communicated his scheme to Mountjoy, lord
deputy of Ireland; and as no man ever commanded more the cordial affection and
attachment of his friends, he had even engaged a person of that virtue and
prudence to entertain thoughts of bringing over part of his army 
<PB N="695" REF="300"/> into England, and of forcing the Queen to declare the
King of Scots her suc∣cessor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs,
vol. II. p. 47<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</NOTE>. And
such was Essex's impatient ardour, that, tho' James declined this
dangerous expedient, he still endeavoured to persuade Mountjoy not to
desist from the project: But the deputy, who thought that such violence,
tho' it might be prudent, and even justifiable, when supported by a
sovereign prince next heir to the crown, would be rash and criminal, if
attempted by subjects, entirely refused his concurrence. The
correspondence, however, between Essex and the court of Scotland was
still conducted with great secrecy and cordiality; and that nobleman,
besides conciliating the favour of James, represented all his own
adversaries as enemies to that prince's succession, and as men entirely
devoted to the interests of Spain, and partizans of the chimerical title of
the Infanta.</P>
<P>THE Infanta and archduke, Albert, had made some advances to
the Queen for peace; and Boulogne, as a neutral town, was chosen for the
place of conference. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 May.</NOTE> Sir Henry Neville, the
English resident in France, Herbert, Edmondes, and Beale,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere sent thither as
ambassadors from England; and negociated with Zu∣niga, Carillo, Richardot,
and Verheiken, ministers of Spain and the archduke: But the conferences were
soon broke off, on account of a dispute of ceremony. Among the European
states England had ever been allowed the precedency above Castile, Arragon,
Portugal, and the other kingdoms of which the Spanish mo∣narchy was
composed; and Elizabeth insisted, that this ancient right was not lost
on account of the junction of these states, and that Spain, in its
present situa∣tion, tho' it surpassed England in extent, as well as
in power, could not compare with it in point of antiquity, the only durable and
regular foundation of prece∣dency among kingdoms, as well as noble families.
That she might shew, how∣ever, a disposition to peace, she was
contented to yield to an equality; but the Spanish ministers, as their
country had always disputed precedency even with France, to which England
submitted, would proceed no farther in the confer∣ences, till their
superiority of rank was acknowleged<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Winwood's

in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nation to peace; and as the
English nation, flushed with success, and sanguine in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> hopes of plunder and conqued, were in

i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was easy for a person so

ministers had sacrificed the interests of their
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Spain, and would even make
no scruple of receiving a sovereign from that hostile nation.</P>
<P><PB N="696" REF="301"/> <MILESTONE N="1601" UNIT="year"/> BUT
Essex, not contented with these arts for decrying his adversaries,
pro∣ceeded to concert more violent methods of ruining them; chiefly
instigated by Cuffe, his secretary, a man of a bold and arrogant spirit,
who had acquired a great ascendant over his patron. A select council of
malecontents was formed, who commonly met at Drury-house, and were composed
of Sir Charles Davers, to whom the house belonged, the earl of Southampton,
Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Sir Christopher Blount, Sir John Davis, and John
Littleton; and Essex, who boasted, that he had an hundred and twenty
barons, knights, and gentlemen of note, at his devotion, and who trusted
still more to his authority with the popu∣lace, communicated to his
associates those secret designs and resolutions, with which his
confidence in so powerful a party had inspired him. Among other criminal
projects, the result of blind rage and despair, he deliberated with them
concerning the method of taking arms; and asked their opinion, whether he had
best begin with seizing the palace or the Tower, or set out with making
himself master at once of both places. The first enterprize being
preferred, a method was concerted for executing it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His insur∣rection.</NOTE> It was agreed,
that Sir Christopher Blount, with a choice detachment, should possess
himself of the palace gates, that Davis should seize the hall, Davers the
guard-chamber and presence-chamber; and that Essex should rush in
from the Meuse, attended by a body of his partizans, should en∣treat the
Queen, with all demonstrations of humility, to remove his enemies, should
oblige her to assemble a Parliament, and should with common consent
settle a new plan of government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 630.

<P>WHILE these desperate projects were in agitation, many
reasons of suspicion were carried to the Queen; and she sent Robert
Sacville, the treasurer's son, to Essex-house, under pretence of a
visit, but, in reality, with a view of discovering whether there was in
that place any concourse of people, or any extraordinary pre∣parations, which
might threaten an insurrection. Soon after, Essex received a sum∣mons
to attend the council, which met at the treasurer's house; and while he was
musing on this circumstance, and comparing it with the late unexpected
visit from Sacville, a private note was conveyed to him, by which he was
warned to pro∣vide for his own safety. He concluded, that all his
conspiracy was discovered, or at least suspected, and that the
easiest punishment which he could expect, was a new and more severe
consinement: He therefore excused himself to the council on pretence of
an indisposition; and he immediately dispatched messages to his more
intimate confederates, requesting their advice and assistance in the
present cri∣tical <PB N="697" REF="302"/> situation of his affairs. They
deliberated, whether they should abandon all their projects, and fly the
kingdom; or instantly seize the palace with the force which they could
assemble; or rely upon the affections of the citizens, who were generally
known to bear a great affection to the earl. Essex declared against the
first expedient, and professed himself determined to undergo any fate
rather than submit to live the life of a fugitive. To seize the palace
seemed impracticable without more preparation; especially as the Queen
seemed now aware of their projects, and, as they heard, had used the
precaution of doubling her ordinary guards. There remained, therefore, no other
expedient but that of betaking themselves to the city; and while the prudence
and expediency of this resolution was under debate, a person arrived, who,
as if he had received a commission for that purpose, gave them
assurance of the good affection of the Londoners, and affirmed, that they
might securely rest any project on that foundation. The po∣pularity of
Essex had chiefly buoyed him up in all his vain undertakings; and he fondly
imagined, that with no other assistance than the good will of the
multi∣tude, he might be enabled to overturn Elizabeth's government, confirmed
by time, revered for wisdom, supported by vigour, and concurring with the
gene∣ral sentiments of the nation. The wild project of raising the city was
immedi∣ately resolved on; the execution of it was delayed till next day; and
emissaries were dispatched to all Essex's friends, informing them
that Cobham and Raleigh had laid schemes against his life, and entreating
their presence and assistance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8th February.</NOTE> NEXT day, there appeared
at Essex-house the earls of Southampton and Rut∣land, the lords Sandys
and Monteagle, with about three hundred gentlemen of good quality and fortune;
and Essex informed them of the danger, to which, he pretended, the
machinations of his enemies exposed him. To some, he said, that he would
throw himself at the Queen's feet, and crave her justice and pro∣tection:
To others, he boasted of his interest in the city, and affirmed, that,
whatever might happen, this resource could never fail him. The Queen was
in∣formed of these designs, by means of intelligence, conveyed, as is
supposed, to Raleigh by Sir Ferdinando Gorges; and having ordered the
magistrates of Lon∣don to keep the citizens in readiness, she sent
Egerton, lord keeper, to Essex-house, with the earl of Worcester, Sir
William Knollys, controller, and Pop∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am, lord chief justice, in order to learn the cause of these
unusual commotions. They were with difficulty admitted thro' a wicket; but
all their servants were excluded, except the purse-bearer. After some
alternation, in which they charged Essex's retainers, upon their
allegiance, to lay down their army, and were in traced in their turn by the
angry multitude, who surrounded them, the earl▪ who found, that matters
were past rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, resolved to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them prisoners 
<PB N="698" REF="303"/> in his house, and to proceed to the execution of his
former project. He issued out with about two hundred attendants, armed only
with swords; and in his passage to the city was joined by the earl of
Bedford and lord Cromwel. He cried aloud, <HI>For the Queen! for the Queen! a
plot is laid for my life;</HI> and then pro∣ceeded to the house of Smith, the
sheriff, on whose aid he had great reliance. The citizens flocked about him
in amazement; but tho' he told them, that Eng∣land was sold to the infanta,
and exhorted them to arm instantly, otherwise they could not do him any
service, no one showed a disposition to join him. The sheriff, on the
earl's approach to his house, stole out at the back door, and made the
best of his way to the lord mayor. Essex, meanwhile, observing the
coldness of the citizens, and hearing, that he was proclaimed a traitor by
the earl of Cumberland and lord Burleigh, began to despair of success,
and thought of retreating to his own house. He found the streets in his
passage barricadoed, and guarded by the citizens, under the command of Sir
John Levison. In his attempt to force his way, Tracy, a young gentleman, to
whom he bore great friendship, was killed, with two or three of the
Londoners; and the earl him∣self, attended by a few of his partizans (for the
greatest part began secretly to withdraw themselves) retired towards the
river, and taking boat, arrived at Essex-house. He there found, that
Gorges, whom he had sent before to capitulate with the lord keeper and the
other counsellors, had given them all their li∣berty, and had gone to court
with them. He was now reduced to despair; and appeared determined, in
prosecution of lord Sandys's advice, to defend himself to the last
extremity, and rather to perish, like a brave man, with his sword in his
hand, than basely by the hands of the executioner: But after some parley,
and after demanding in vain, first hostages, then conditions, from the
besiegers, he surrendered at discretion; requesting only civil
treatment, and a fair and im∣partial hearing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p
632.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen, who, during all this commotion, had behaved with as
great tran∣quillity and security, as if there had only passed a fray in
the streets, in which she was no way concerned<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 469.</NOTE>, soon gave orders for
the trial of the most conside∣rable of the criminals. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th February.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His trial.</NOTE> The earls of Essex and
Southampton were arraigned be∣fore a jury of twenty-five peers, where
Buckhurst acted as lord steward. The guilt of the prisoners was too
apparent to admit of any doubt; and, besides the insurrection known to
every body, the treasonable conferences at Drury-house were proved by
undoubted evidence. Sir Ferdinando Gorges was produced in court▪ The
confessions of the earl of Rutland, of the lords Cromwel, Sandys, and
Monteagle, of Davers, Blount, and Davies, were only read to the peers,
ac∣cording <PB N="699" REF="304"/> to the practice of that age. Essex's
best friends were scandalized at his assurance in insisting so
positively on his innocence, and the goodness of his in∣tentions; and
still more at his vindictive disposition, in accusing, without any
appearance of reason, secretary Cecil as a partizan of the infanta's title.
The secre∣tary, who had expected this charge, stepped into the court, and
challenged Essex to produce his authority, which, on examination, was found
extremely weak and frivolous<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p.
530.</NOTE>. When sentence was pronounced, Essex spoke like a man who
laid his account to die: But he added, that he should be sorry, if he was
represented to the Queen as a person that despised her clemency; tho'
he should not, he believed, make any cringing submissions to obtain it.
Southampton's behaviour was more mild and submissive: He entreated the
good offices of the peers in so modest and becoming a manner, as excited
compassion in every one.</P>
<P>THE most remarkable circumstance in Essex's trial was
Bacon's appearance against him. He was none of the crown lawyers; so was
not obliged by his office to assist at this trial: Yet did he not
scruple, in order to obtain the Queen's favour, to be active in bereaving of
life his friend and patron, whose generosity he had often experienced. He
compared Essex's conduct, in pretending to fear the attempts of his
adversaries, to that of Pisistratus, the Athenian, who cut and wounded
his own body; and making the people believe, that his enemies had committed
that violence, obtained a guard for his person, by whose assistance
he afterwards subdued the liberties of his country.</P>
<P>AFTER Essex had passed some days in the folitude and
reflection of a prison, his proud heart was at last subdued, not by the
fear of death, but by the senti∣ments of religion; a principle, which he had
before attempted to make the in∣strument of his ambition, but which now took
a more firm hold of his mind, and prevailed over every other motive and
consideration. His spiritual directors persuaded him, that he never could
obtain the pardon of heaven, unless he made a full confession of his
disloyalty; and he gave in to the council an account of all his most
criminal designs, as well as of his correspondence with the King of Scots.
He spared not even his most intimate friends, such as lord Mountjoy, whom
he had engaged in these conspiracies; and he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought to pacify his present
remorse, by making such attonements as in any other period of his life, he
would have deemed more blameable than those attempts themselves, which were
the objects of his penitence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 30<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Sir Harry Neville, in
particular, a man of merit, he accused of a correspondence with the
conspirators; tho' it appears, that that gentleman had never assented to
the proposals made him, and was no farther <PB N="700" REF="305"/> criminal
than in not revealing the earl's treason; an office, to which every man of
honour naturally bears the strongest reluctance<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.</NOTE>. Neville was thrown into prison, and underwent a
severe persecution: But as the Queen found Mountjoy a very able and
successful commander, she continued him in his government, and
sacrificed her resentment to the public service.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH affected extremely the praise of clemency; and in
every great example, which she had made during her reign, she had always
appeared full of reluctance and hesitation: But the present situation of
Essex called forth all her tender affections, and kept her in the most
real agitation and irresolution. She felt a perpetual combat between
resentment and inclination, pride and compassion, the care of her own
safety and concern for her favourite; and her situation, dur∣ing this
interval, was perhaps more an object of pity, than that to which Essex
himself was reduced. She signed the warrant for his execution; she
counter∣manded it; she again resolved on his death; she felt a new return
of tenderness: Essex's enemies told her, that he himself desired to
die, and had assured her, that she could never be in safety while he
lived: It is likely, that this proof of penitence and of concern for her, would
operate a contrary effect to what they intended, and would revive all that fond
affection, which she had so long indulged to the unhappy prisoner. But
what chiefly hardened her heart against him was his sup∣posed
obstinacy, in never making, as she hourly expected, any application to her
for mercy and forgiveness; and she finally gave her consent to his
execution. He discovered at his death symptoms rather of penitence and
piety than of fear; and willingly acknowleged the justice of the sentence,
by which he suffered. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th February</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And execution</NOTE> The execution was private
in the Tower, agreeable to his own request. He was ap∣prehensive, he
said, lest the favour and compassion of the people would too much
raise his heart in those moments, when humiliation under the afflicting
hand of Heaven was the only proper sentiment, which he could indulge<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dr. Barlow's sermon on Essex's execution.
Bacon, vol. IV▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>34.</NOTE>. And the Queen, no
doubt, thought, that prudence required the removal of so melancholy a
spectacle from the public eye. Sir Walter Raleigh, who came to the Tower on
purpose, and who beheld Essex's execution from a window, encreased much
by this action the general hatred, under which he already laboured: It was
thought, that he had no other purpose than to feast his eyes with the death
of his enemy; and no apology, which he could make for so exceptionable a
cir∣cumstance of conduct, could be accepted by the public. The cruelty and
ani∣mosity, <PB N="701" REF="306"/> with which he urged on Essex's fate,
even when Cecil relented<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Murdin, p 811.</NOTE>,
were still regarded as the principles of this unmanly and ungenerous
behaviour.</P>
<P>THE earl of Essex was but thirty-four years of age, when his
rashness, impru∣dence, and violence brought him to this untimely end. We
must here, as in many other instances, lament the inconstancy of human
nature, that a person en∣dowed with so many noble virtues, generosity,
sincerity, friendship, valour, elo∣quence, and industry, should in the
latter period of his life have given such reins to his ungovernable
passions, as involved, not only himself, but many of his friends, in
utter ruin. The Queen's tenderness and passion, as it was the cause of
those premature honours, which he attained, seems, on the whole, the chief
circumstance which brought on his destruction. Confident of her partiality
to∣wards him; as well as of his own merit, he treated her with a haughtiness,
which neither her love nor her dignity could bear; and as her amorous
inclinations in so advanced an age, would naturally make her appear
ridiculous, if not hateful in his eyes, he was engaged, by an imprudent
openness, of which he made pro∣fession, to discover too easily
those sentiments to her jealous pride. The many reconciliations and returns
of affection, of which he had still made advantage, made him venture on new
provocations, till he pushed her beyond all bounds of patience; and he
forgot, that, tho' the sentiments of the woman were ever strong in her,
those of the sovereign had still in the end appeared predomi∣nant.</P>
<P>SOME of Essex's associates, Cuffe, Davers, Blount,
Meric, and Davis were tried and condemned, and all of them, except Davis, were
executed. The Queen pardoned the rest; being persuaded that they were drawn
in merely from their friendship to that nobleman, and their care of his
safety; and were igno∣rant of the more criminal part of his intentions.
Southampton's life was spared with great difficulty; but he was kept in
prison during all the remainder of this reign.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots, who was apprehensive left his
correspondence with Essex might have been discovered, and have given
offence to Elizabeth, sent the earl of Mar and the lord Kinloss as
ambassadors to England, in order to con∣gratulate the Queen on her escape
from the late insurrection and conspiracy. They were also ordered to
enquire whether any measures had been taken by her to exclude him from the
succession, as well as to discover the inclinations of the chief
nobility and counsellors, in case of the Queen's demise<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Memoirs, vol.
II▪ p. 510.</NOTE>. They found the dispositions of men as favourable
as they could wish; and they even entered into <PB N="702" REF="307"/> a
correspondence with secretary Cecil, whose influence, after the fall of
Essex, was now uncontrouled<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Osborne, p.
615.</NOTE>, and who was resolved, by this policy, to acquire, in time, the
confidence of the successor. He knew how jealous Elizabeth ever was of
her authority, and he therefore carefully concealed from her his attachment to
James: But he afterwards asserted, that nothing could be more advantageous
to her, than this correspondence; because the King of Scots, secure of
mounting the throne by his undoubted title, aided by those connexions with
the English ministry, was the less likely to give any disturbance to
the present sovereign. He also persuaded that prince to remain in
quiet, and patiently to expect, that time should open to him the inheritance
of the throne, without pushing his friends on desperate enterprizes, which
would totally incapacitate them from serving him. James's equity, as well as
his natural want of enterprize, easily inclined him to embrace this
resolution<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 471, 472.</NOTE>;
and thus the minds of the English were silently, but universally
disposed to admit, without opposition, the succession of the
Scottish line: The death of Essex, by putting an end to faction, had been
rather fa∣vourable than prejudicial to that great event.</P>
<P>THE King of France, who was little prepossessed in
favour of James, and who was averse to the union of England and Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 352.</NOTE>, made his ambassador
drop some hints to Cecil of Henry's willingness to concur in any measure
for disappointing the hopes of the Scotch monarch; but as Cecil showed an
entire disapprobation of such schemes, the court of France took no
farther steps in that matter: and thus the only foreign power, which could
give much disturbance to James's succession, was induced to acquiesce
in it<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 471.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">French affairs.</NOTE> Henry made a journey
this summer to Calais; and the Queen, hearing of his intentions, went to
Dover, in hopes of having a personal interview with a monarch, whom, of all
others, she most loved and most respected. The French King, who felt
the same senti∣ments towards her, would gladly have accepted of the
proposal; but as many difficulties occurred, it appeared necessary to lay
aside, by common consent, the project of an interview. Elizabeth, however,
wrote successively two let∣ters to Henry, one by Edmondes, another by Sir
Robert Sydney, in which she expressed a desire of conferring about a
business of importance, with some mi∣nister in whom that prince
reposed entire confidence. The marquess of Rhoni, the King's favourite and
prime minister, came to Dover in disguise; and the memoirs of that able
statesman contain a full account of his conversation with Elizabeth. That
magnanimous princess had formed a scheme of establishing, in
conjunction with Henry, a new system of policy in Europe, and of fixing a 
<PB N="703" REF="308"/> durable ballance of power, by the erection of new
states on the ruins of the house of Austria. She had even the wisdom to
foresee the perils, which might ensue from the aggrandizement of her ally;
and she proposed to unite the whole seventeen provinces of the Low
Countries into one republic, in order to form a perpetual barrier against the
dangerous encrease of the French, as well as of the Spanish, monarchy.
Henry had himself long meditated such a project against the Austrian
family; and Rhoni could not forbear expressing his astonishment, when
he found that Elizabeth and his master, tho' they had never communicated
their thoughts on this subject, had not only entered into the same general
views, but had also formed the same project for their execution. The
affairs, however, of France were not yet brought to a situation, which might
enable Henry to begin that great enterprize; and Rhoni satisfied the Queen,
that it would be necessary to postpone for some years their united
attack on the Austrian family. He de∣parted, filled with just admiration of
the solidity of Elizabeth's judgment, and the greatness of her mind; and he
owns that she was entirely worthy of that high reputation, which she
possessed in Europe.</P>
<P>THE Queen's magnanimity in forming such extensive projects
was the more re∣markable, that, besides her having fallen so far into the
decline of life, the af∣fairs of Ireland, tho' conducted with ability and
success, were still in disorder, and made a great diversion of her
forces. The expence incurred by this war lay heavy upon her narrow revenues;
and her ministers, taking advantage of her great disposition to
frugality, proposed to her an expedient of saving, which, tho' she at
first disapproved of it, she was at last induced to embrace. It was
represented to her, that the great sums of money remitted to Ireland for
the pay of the Eng∣lish forces, came, by the necessary course of
circulation, into the hands of the re∣bels, and enabled them to buy abroad all
requisite supplies of arms and ammunition, which, from the extreme poverty
of that kingdom and its want of every useful commodity, they could not
otherwise find means to purchase. It was therefore proposed to her, that
she should pay her forces in money of a base alloy; and it was
asserted, that, besides the great saving to the revenue, this species
of coin could never be exported with advantage, and would not pass in any
foreign market. Some of the wiser counsellors maintained, that, if the pay
of the sol∣diers was raised in proportion, the Irish rebels would
necessarily reap the same benefit from the base money, which would
always be taken at a rate suitable to its value; if the pay was not raised,
there was danger of a mutiny among the troops, who, whatever names might be
affixed to the pieces of metal, would soon find from experience that they
were defrauded in their income<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.

<PB N="704" REF="309"/> tho' she justly valued herself on fixing the
standard of the English coin, much debased by her predecessors, and
had innovated very little in that delicate article, was seduced by the

she coined a great quantity of base money, which she made use of in the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountjoy's success in Ire∣land.</NOTE>
MOUNTJOY, the deputy, was a man of great ability; and foreseeing the dan∣ger
of mutiny among the troops, he led them instantly into the field, and
re∣solved, by means of strict discipline, and by keeping them employed
against the enemy, to obviate those inconveniencies, which were justly
apprehended. He made military roads, and built a fortress at Moghery; he
drove the Mac-Genises out of Lecale; he harrassed Tyrone in Ulster with
inroads and lesser expeditions; and by destroying, every where, and
during all seasons, the provisions of the Irish, he reduced them to
perish with famine in the woods and morasses, to which they were obliged
to retreat. At the same time, Sir Henry Docwray, who com∣manded another body
of troops, took the castle of Derry, and put garrisons into Newton and
Ainogh; and having seized the monastery of Donnegal near Balishan∣non, he
threw troops into it, and defended it against the assaults of O'Donnel
and the Irish. Nor was Sir George Carew idle in the province of Munster. He
seized the titular earl of Desmond, and sent him over, with Florence
Macarty, another chieftain, prisoner to England. He arrested many
suspected persons, and took hostages from others. And having got a
reinforcement of two thousand men from England, he threw himself into
Corke, which he supplied with arms and provisions; and he put every thing
in a condition for resisting the Spanish invasion, which was daily
expected. The deputy, informed of the danger, to which the southern provinces
were exposed, left the prosecution of the war against Tyrone, who was
reduced to great extremity; and he marched with his army into Monster.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Septem∣ber.</NOTE> AT last, the
Spaniards, under Don John d'Aquila, arrived at Kingsale; and Sir Richard
Piercy, who commanded in the town with a small garrison of an hundred and
fifty men, sound himself obliged to abandon it on their appearance. These
in∣vaders amounted to four thousand men, and the Irish expressed a
great desire to join them, in order to free themselves from the English
government, with which they were extremely discontented. One chief ground of
their complaint was the in∣troduction of trials by jury<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 644.</NOTE>; an institution, abhorred by
this barbarous nation, tho' nothing contributes more to the support of that
equity and liberty, for which the English laws are so justly celebrated.
The Irish also bore a great fa∣vour <PB N="705" REF="310"/> to the
Spaniards, having entertained the opinion, that they themselves were
descended from that nation; and their attachment to the catholic religion
proved a new cause of affection to the invaders. D'Aquila assumed the
title of general in the holy war for the preservation of the faith in
Ireland; and he endeavoured to persuade the people, that Queen Elizabeth was,
by several bulls of the pope, deprived of her crown; that her subjects were
absolved from their oaths of alle∣giance; and that the Spaniards were come to
deliver the Irish from the power of the devil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeat of the Spaniards and Irish.</NOTE>
Mountjoy found it necessary to act with vigour, in order to prevent a total
insurrection of the Irish; and having gathered together his forces, he
formed the siege of Kinsale by land; while Sir Richard Levison, with a
small squadron, blockaded it by sea. He had no sooner begun his
operations than he heard of the arrival of another body of two thousand
Spaniards, under the command of Alphonso Ocampo, who had taken
possession of Baltimore and Bere-haven; and he found himself obliged
to detach Sir George Carew to oppose their progress. Tyrone, meanwhile,
with Randal, Mac Surley, Tirel baron of Killey, and other chieftains of the
Irish, had joined Ocampo with all their forces, and were marching to the
relief of Kinsale. The deputy, informed of their design by intercepted
letters, made preparations to receive them; and being joined by Levison with
six hundred marines, he posted his troops on an advantageous ground, which
lay on their passage, leaving some cavalry to prevent a sally from
D'Aquila and the Spanish garrison. When Tyrone, with a body of Irish and
Spaniards, approached, he was surprized to find the English so well
posted, and ranged in such good order; and he immediately sounded a
retreat: But the deputy gave orders to pur∣sue him; and having thrown these
advanced troops into disorder, he followed them to the main body, whom he
also attacked, and put to flight, with the slaughter of twelve hundred
men<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol I p 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Ocampo was taken prisoner; Tyrone fled into
Ulster; Odonel made his escape into Spain; and D'Aquila, finding himself
reduced to the greatest difficulties, was obliged to capitulate upon such
terms as the deputy prescribed to him: He surrendered Kinsale and
Baltimore, and agreed to evacuate the Kingdom. This great blow, joined to other
successes, gained by Wilmot, governor of Kerry, and by Roger and Gavin
Harvey, threw the rebels into dismay, and gave a prospect of the final
reduction of that kingdom.</P>
<P>THE Irish war, tho' successful, was extremely
burthensome on the Queen's revenue; and besides the supplies granted by
Parliament, which were indeed very small, but which they ever regarded as
mighty concessions, she had been obliged, notwithstanding her great
frugality, to employ other expedients, <PB N="706" REF="311"/> such as
selling the royal demesnes and crown jewels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes,
p. 629.</NOTE>, and exacting loans from the people<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, in order to support this cause, so
essential to the honour and interests of England. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th October.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> The necessity of her
affairs obliged her again to summon a Parlia∣ment; and it here appeared,
that, tho' old age was advancing fast upon her, tho' she had lost much of
her popularity by the unfortunate execution of Essex, in∣somuch that,
when she appeared in public, she was not attended with the usual
acclamations<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 602. Osborne, p.
604.</NOTE>, yet the powers of her prerogative, supported by her vigour,
still remained as high and uncontroulable as ever.</P>
<P>THE active reign of Elizabeth had enabled many persons to
distinguish them∣selves in civil and military employments; and the Queen,
who was not able, from her revenue, to give them any rewards proportioned to
their service, had made use of an expedient, which had been employed by her
predecessors, but which had never been carried to such an extreme as
under her administration. She granted her servants and courtiers patents
for monopolies; and these patents they sold to others, who were thereby
enabled to raise commodities to what price they pleased, and who put
invincible restraints upon all commerce, industry, and emulation. It is
astonishing to consider the number and importance of those commodities,
which were thus assigned over to patentees. Currants, salt, iron, powder,
cards, calf-skins, fells, pouldavies, ox-shin-bones, train oil, lists of
cloth, pot-ashes, anniseeds, vinegar, sea-coals, steel, aquavitae,
brushes, pots, bottles, salt-petre, lead, accidences, oil,
calamint-stone, oil of blubber, glasses, paper, starch, tin, sulphur,
new drapery, dried pilchers, transportation of iron ordnance, of beer, of
horn, of leather, importation of Spanish wools, of irish yarn: These are
but a part of the commodities, which had been consigned over to
monopolists<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 648, 650, 652.</NOTE>.
When this list was read over in the house, a member cried out, <HI>Is not
bread in the number? Bread,</HI> said every one with astonishment:
<HI>Yes, I assure you,</HI> replied he, <HI>if affairs go on at this rate,
we shall have bread reduced to a monopoly before next Parliament</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 648.</NOTE>. These monopolists were so
exorbitant in their demands, that in some places they raised the price of
salt, from sixteen pence a bushel, to fourteen or fifteen
shillings<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 647.</NOTE>. Such high
profits naturally begot in∣truders upon their commerce; and in order to
secure themselves against encroach∣ments, the patentees were armed with
high and arbitrary powers from the council, by which they were enabled to
oppress the people at pleasure, and to exact money from such as they
thought proper to accuse of interfering with their patent<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 641, 646, 652.</NOTE>. The patentees of salt-petre,
having the power of entering into every <PB N="707" REF="312"/> house, and of
committing what havock they pleased in stables, cellars, or where∣ever they
suspected salt-petre might be gathered; commonly extorted money from
those who desired to free themselves of this damage or trouble<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 653.</NOTE>. And while all domestic intercourse was
thus restrained, lest any scope should remain for industry, almost
every species of foreign commerce was confined to exclusive companies, who
bought and sold at any price, that they themselves thought pro∣per to offer
or exact.</P>
<P>THESE grievances, the most intolerable for the present, and
the most perni∣cious in their consequences, that ever were known in any age
or under any go∣vernment, had been mentioned in the last Parliament, and a
petition had even been presented to the Queen, complaining of the patents;
but she still persisted in defending her monopolists against her
people. A bill was now introduced into the lower house, abolishing all
these monopolies; and as the former application had been unsuccessful, a
law was insisted on as the only certain expedient for correct∣ing these
abuses: The courtiers, on the other hand, maintained, that this mat∣ter
regarded the prerogative, and that they could never hope for success, if
they did not make application, in the most humble and respectful manner, to
the Queen's goodness and beneficence. The topics, which were advanced in the
house, and which came equally from the courtiers and the country gentlemen,
and were admitted by both, will appear the most extraordinary to such as
are prepossessed with an idea of the antient privileges of the people,
and of the liberty enjoyed under the administration of Elizabeth. It was
asserted, that the Queen possessed both an enlarging and a
restraining power; by her prerogative she might set at liberty what was
restrained by statute or otherwise, and by her prerogative she might
restrain what was otherwise at liberty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
p. 64<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 675.</NOTE>: That the royal

not even admit of any limitation<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 646,
654.</NOTE>: That absolute princes, such as the sovereigns of England,
were a species of divinity<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 649.</NOTE>:
That it was in vain to attempt tying the Queen's hands by laws or statutes;
since, by means of her dispensing power, she could loosen herself
at her pleasure<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>: That even if a
clause should be annexed to a statute, excluding her dispensing
power; she could first dispense with that clause, and then with the
statute<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 64<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>. After all this discourse, more worthy of a Turkish
divan than of an English house of commons, according to our present idea
of this assembly, the Queen, who perceived how odious monopolies had
become, and what heats were likely to rise, sent for the speaker, and
desired him to inform <PB N="708" REF="313"/> the house, that she would
immediately cancel the most grievous and oppressive of these
patents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>It may not be amiss to subjoin some passages of
these speeches; which may serve very much to give us a just idea of the
antient constitution, and of the political principles, which prevailed during
the reign of Elizabeth. Mr. Laurence Hyde proposed a bill, entitled an act
for the explanation of the common law in certain cases of letters patent. Mr.
Spicer said, This bill may touch the prerogative-royal, which, as I learned
the last Parliament, is so transcendant, that the — of the
subject may not aspire thereunto. Far be it therefore from me, that the
state and prerogative-royal of the prince should be tied by me or by the
act of any other subject. Mr. Francis Bacon said, As to the
preroga∣tive-royal of the prince, for my own part, I ever allowed of it; and it
is such as I hope will never be discussed. The Queen, as she is our
sovereign, hath both an enlarging and restraining power. For by her
prerogative she may set at liberty things restrained by statute law or
otherwise, and secondly by her prerogative she may restrain things
which be at liberty. For the first, she may grant a <HI>non obstante</HI>
contrary to the penal laws.—With regard to monopolies and such like
cases, the case hath ever been to humble ourselves unto her majesty,
and by petition desire to have our grievances remedied, espe∣cially when
the remedy toucheth her so nigh in point of prerogative.—I say, and I
say it again, that we ought not to deal, to judge or meddle with her
majesty's prerogative. I wish therefore every man to be careful of this
business. Dr. Bennet said, He that goeth about to debate her majesty's
prerogative had need to walk warily. Mr. Laurence Hyde said, For the bill
itself, I made it, and I think I un∣derstand it: And far be it from this
heart of mine to think, this tongue to speak, or this hand to write any thing
either in prejudice or derogation of her majesty's prerogative-royal and the
state.—Mr. Speaker, quoth serjeant Harris, for ought I see, the
house moveth to have this bill in the nature of a petition. It must then
begin with more humiliation. And truly, Sir, the bill is good of itself, but
the penning of it is somewhat out of course. Mr. Montague said, The
matter is good and honest, and I like this manner of proceeding by bill well
enough in this matter. The grievances are great, and I would note only unto you
thus much, that the last Parliament we proceeded by way of petition, which
had no successful effect. Mr. Francis More said, I know the Queen's
prerogative is a thing curious to be dealt withal; yet all grievances are not
comparable. I cannot utter with my tongue or conceive with my heart the great
grievances that the town and country, for which I serve, suffereth by
some of these monopolies. It bringeth the general profit into a private
hand, and the end of all this is beggary and bondage to the subjects. We have
a law for the true and faithful currying of leather: There is a patent sets
all at liberty, notwithstanding that statute. And to what purpose is it
to do any thing by act of Parliament, when the Queen will undo the same by
her prerogative? Out of the spirit of hu∣miliation, Mr. Speaker, I do speak
it, there is no act of her's that hath been or is more derogatory to her own
majesty, more odious to the subject, more dangerous to the commonwealth
than the grant∣ing of these monopolies. Mr. Martin said, I do speak for a
town that grieves and pines, for a country that groaneth and languisheth
under the burthen of monstrous and unconscionable substitutes to the
mo∣nopolitans of starch, tin, fish, cloth, oil, vinegar, salt and I know
not what; nay, what not? The principalest commodities both of my town and
country are engrost into the hands of these blood∣suckers of the
commonwealth. If a body, Mr. Speaker, being let blood, be left still
languishing without any remedy, how can the good estate of that body
still remain? Such is the state of my town and country; the traffic is
taken away, the inward and private commodities are taken away, and da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not be used without the licence of
these monopolitans. If these blood suckers be still let alone to suck
up the best and principallest commodities, which the earth there hath given
us, what will become of us, from whom the fruits of our own soil and the
commodities of our own labour, which with the sweat of our brows, even up to
the knees in mire and dirt, we have laboured for, shall be taken by warrant
of supreme authority, which the poor subject dare not gainsay? Mr. George
Moore said, We know the power of her majesty cannot be restrained by any
act; why therefore should we thus talk? Admit we should make this statute
with a <HI>non obstante;</HI> yet the Queen may grant a patent with a <HI>non
obstante,</HI> to cross this <HI>non obstante.</HI> I think therefore it
agreeth more with the gravity and wisdom of this house to proceed with all
humbleness by petition than bill. Mr. Downland said, As I would be no let
or over-vehement in any thing, so I am not sottish or senseless of
the common grievance of the commonwealth. If we proceed by way of petition, we
can have no more gracious answer, than we had the last Parliament to our
petition. But since that Parliament, we have no reformation. Sir Robert Wroth
said, I speak, and I speak it boldly, these patentees are worse than
ever they were. Mr. Hayward Townsend proposed, that they should make
suit to her majesty, not only to repeal all monopolies grievous to the
subject, but also that it would please her majesty to give the
Parliament leave to make an act, that they might be of no more force, validity,
or effect, than they are at the common law, without the strength of her
prerogative. Which tho' we might now do, and the act being so reasonable,
we might assure ourselves her majesty would not delay the passing
thereof, yet we, her loving subjects, &amp;c. would not offer without her
privity and consent (the cause so nearly touching her prerogative) or go
about to do any such act.</P> 
<P>On a subsequent day, the bill against monopolies was
again introduced, and Mr. Spicer said, It is to no purpose to offer to tie
her majesty's hands by act of parliament, when she may loosen herself
at her pleasure. Mr. Davies said, God hath given that power to absolute
princes, which he attributes to himself. <HI>Dixi quod Dii estis.</HI> (N.
B. This axiom he applies to the Kings of England.) Mr. secre∣tary Cecil
said, I am servant to the Queen, and before I would speak and give
consent to a case that should debase her prerogative, or abridge it, I
would wish that my tongue were cut out of my head. I am sure there were
law-makers before there were laws: (Meaning, I suppose, that the
sovereign wa above the laws.) One gentleman went about to posters us, with
the execution of the law man ancient record of 5 or 7 of Edward the third.
Likely enough to be true in that time, when the King was afraid of the

should displease. The prero¦gative royal is that which is now in

Let us therefore apply by petition to her majesty.</P> 
<P>After the speaker told the house, that the Queen had
annulled many of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Mr
Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Moore said, I must
confess, Mr. speaker, I moved the house both the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parliament and this, touch∣ing
this point; but I never meant (and I hope the house thinketh so) to set
limits and bounds to the prerogative royal. He proceeds to move, that thanks
should be given to her majesty; and tho, the whereas divers speeches have
been moved extravagantly in the house, which doubtless have been told her
majesty, and perhaps ill conceived of by her, Mr. Speaker would apologize,
and humbly crave pardon for the same. N. B. These extracts were taken by
Townsend, a member of the house, who was no courtier; and the extravagance
of the speeches seems rather to be on the other side: It will certainly
appear odd to us, that this liberty should be thought extravagant However,
the Queen, notwithstanding her cajoling the house, was so ill satisfied
with these proceedings, that she spoke of them peevishly in her
concluding speech, and told them, that she perceived, that private
respects with them were privately masqued under public presence. D'Ewes,
p. 619.</P> 
<P>There were some other topics, in favour of prerogative,
still more extravagant, advanced in the house this Parliament. When the
question of the subsidy was before them, Mr. serjeant Heyle said, Mr.
Speaker, I marvel much, that the house should stand upon granting of a
subsidy or the time of payment, when all we have is her majesty's, and
she may lawfully at her pleasure take it from us: Yea, she hath as much
right to all our lands and goods as to any revenue of her crown. At which all
the house hemmed, and laughed, and talked. Well, quoth serjeant Heyle, all
your hemming shall not put me out of countenance. So, Mr. Speaker stood up
and said, It is a great disorder, that this should be used.—So
the said serjeant proceeded, and when he had spoken a little while, the
house hemmed again; and so he fat down. In his latter speech, he said,
he could prove his former position by pre∣cedents in the time of Henry the
third, King John, King Stephen, &amp;c. which was the occasion of their
hemming. D'Ewes, p. 633. It is observable, that Heyle was an eminent lawyer,
a man of character. Winwood, vol. I. p. 290. And tho' the house in general
shewed their disapprobation, no one cared to take him down, or oppose
these extravagant positions. It was also asserted this session,
that in the same manner as the Roman consul was possessed of the
power of rejecting or admitting mo∣tions in the senate, the Speaker might
either admit or reject bills in the house. D'Ewes, p. 677. The house
declared themselves against this opinion; but the very proposal of it is
a proof at what a low ebb liberty was at that time in England.</P> 
<P>In the year 1591, the judges made a solemn decree, that
England was an absolute empire, of which the King was the head. In
consequence of this opinion, they determined, that even if the act of the
first of Elizabeth had never been made, the King was supreme head of the
church; and might have erected, by his prerogative, such a court as the
ecclesiastical commission: For that he was the head of all his
subjects. Now that court was plainly arbitrary: The inference is, that his
power was equally absolute over the laity. See Coke's Reports, p. 5.
Candrey's case.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="709" REF="314"/> THE house was struck with
astonishment, and admiration, and gratitude at this extraordinary
instance of the Queen's goodness and condescension. A mem∣ber 
<PB N="710" REF="315"/> said, with tears in his eyes, that if a sentence of
everlasting happiness had been pronounced in his favour, he could not have
felt more joy than that with which he was at present overwhelmed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 654.</NOTE>. Another observed, that this message
from the sacred person of the Queen, was a kind of gospel or
glad-tidings, and ought to be received as such, and be written in the tablets
of their hearts<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 656.</NOTE>. And it was
farther remarked, that in the same manner as the Deity would not give his
glory to another, so the Queen herself was the only agent in their
present pros∣perity and happiness<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
657.</NOTE>. The house voted, that the speaker, with a certain num∣ber of
members, should ask permission to wait on her majesty, and return her
thanks for her gracious concessions to her people.</P>
<P><PB N="711" REF="316"/> WHEN the speaker, with the other
members, was introduced to the Queen, they all flung themselves on their
knees; and remained in that posture a consider∣able time, till she
thought proper to express her desire, that they should rise. The
speaker displayed the gratitude of the commons, that her sacred ears were
ever open to hear them, and her blessed hands ever stretched out to
relieve them. They acknowleged, he said, in all duty and thankfulness
acknowleged, that, be∣fore they called, her <HI>preventing grace,</HI> and
<HI>all-deserving goodness</HI> watched over them for their good; more
ready to give than they could desire, much less deserve. He remarked,
that the attribute which was most proper to God, to perform all he
promiseth, appertained also to her; and that she was all truth, all
constancy, and all goodness. And he concluded with these expressions,

<Q REND="inline">"Neither do we present our thanks in words or
any outward sign, which can be no sufficient retribution for so great
goodness; but in all duty and thankfulness, prostrate at your feet, we
present our most loyal and thankful hearts, even the last drop of blood
in our hearts, and the last spirit of breath in our nostrils, to be
poured out, to be breathed up, for your safety<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">D'Ewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8, 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>."</Q> The Queen heard very pa∣tiently this speech, where
she was flattered in phrases appropriated to the Su∣preme Being; and she
returned an answer, full of such expressions of tenderness towards
her people, as ought to have appeared fulsome after the late instances of
rigour which she had employed, and from which nothing but necessity had
made her depart. Thus was this critical affair happily terminated; and
Eliza∣beth, by prudently receding, in time, from her rights, maintained her
dignity, and preserved the affections of her people.</P>
<P>THE commons granted her a supply very unprecedented, of four
subsidies and eight fifteenths; and they were even so dutiful as to vote
this supply before they received any satisfaction in the business of
monopolies, which they justly considered as of the utmost consequence
to the interest and happiness of the nation. Had they attempted to extort
that concession by keeping the supply in suspence; so haughty was
the Queen's disposition, this appearance of constraint and jealousy had
been sufficient to have produced a denial of all their requests, and to
have forced her into some acts of authority still more violent and
arbitrary.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"/> THE remaining events of this reign are
neither very numerous nor important. The Queen, finding that the Spaniards had
involved her in so much trouble, by fomenting and assisting the Irish
rebellion, resolved to give them employment at home; and she fitted out a
squadron of nine ships under Sir Richard Levison, admiral, and Sir
William Monson, vice-admiral, whom she sent on an expedi∣tion 
<PB N="712" REF="317"/> <MILESTONE N="1602" UNIT="year"/> to the coast of
Spain. The admiral, with part of the squadron, met the galleons loaded with
treasure; but was not strong enough to attack them: The vice∣admiral also
fell in with some very rich ships; but they escaped for a like reason:
And these two brave officers, that their expedition might not be entirely
fruitless, resolved to attack the harbour of Cerimbra in Portugal, where,
they received intelligence, a very rich Carrack had taken shelter. The
harbour was guarded by a castle: There were eleven gallies stationed in it:
And the militia of the country, to the number, as was believed, of twenty
thousand men, appeared in arms on the shore: Yet notwithstanding these
obstacles, and others derived from the winds and tides, the English
squadron broke into the harbour, dismounted the guns of the castle,
sunk or burnt, or put to flight, the gallies, and obliged the carrack to
surrender<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 181.</NOTE>. They
brought her home to England, and she was va∣lued at a million of ducats<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 647.</NOTE>. A sensible loss to the
Spaniards; and a supply still more considerable to Elizabeth<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">This year the Spaniards begun the siege of
Ostend, which was bravely defended for five months by Sir Francis Vere. The

<P>THE affairs of Ireland, after the defeat of Tyrone, and the
expulsion of the Spaniards, hastened to a settlement. Lord Mountjoy
divided his army into small parties, and harrassed the rebels on every
side: He built Charlemount, and many other small forts, which were
impregnable to the Irish, and guarded all the important passes of the
country: The activity of Sir Henry Docwray and Sir Arthur Chichester,
permitted no repose or security to the rebels: And many of the
chiestains, after skulking like wild beasts, in woods and morasses,
submit∣ted to mercy, and received such conditions as the deputy was
pleased to impose upon them. <MILESTONE N="1603" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyrone's sub∣mission.</NOTE> Tyrone
himself made application by Arthur Mac-Baron, his bro∣ther, to be received
upon terms; but Mountjoy would not admit him, except he made an absolute
surrender of his life and fortune to the Queen's mercy. He appeared before
the deputy at Millefont, in a habit and posture suitable to his present
fortune; and after acknowleging his offence in the most humble terms, he was
committed to custody by Mountjoy, who intended to bring him over cap∣tive
into England, to be disposed of at the Queen's pleasure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's sick∣ness,</NOTE> BUT Elizabeth
was now incapable of receiving any satisfaction from this for∣tunate event:
She had fallen into a prosound melancholy; which all the advan∣tages of her
high fortune, all the glories of her prosperous reign, were unable, in any
degree, to alleviate or assuage. Some ascribed this depression of
mind to her repentance of granting a pardon to Tyrone, whom she had always
resolved to <PB N="713" REF="318"/> bring to condign punishment for his
treasons, but who had made such interest with the ministers, as to
extort a remission from her. Others, with more likeli∣hood, accounted for
her dejection, by a discovery which she had made, of the correspondence
maintained in her court with her successor the King of Scots, and by the
neglect, to which, on account of her old age and infirmities, she imagin∣ed
herself to be exposed. But there is another cause assigned for her
melancholy, which has long been rejected by historians as remantic, but which
late discoveries seem to have confirmed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the
proofs of this remarkable fact collected in Birth's Negociatious, p. 206. And
Memoir, vol. II. p. 481, 505, 50<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
&amp;c.</NOTE>: Some incidents happened which revived her tender∣ness for
Essex, and filled her with the deepest sorrow for the consent which
she had unwarily given to his execution.</P>
<P>THE earl of Essex, after his return from the fortunate
expedition against Cadiz, observing the increase of the Queen's fond
attachment towards him, took occa∣sion to regret, that the necessity of
her service required him often to be absent from her person, and
exposed him to all those ill offices which his enemies, more assiduous
in their attendance, could practise against him. She was moved with this
tender jealousy; and making him the present of a ring, desired him to
keep that pledge of her affection, and assured him, that in whatever
disgrace he should fall, whatever prejudices she might be induced to
entertain against him, yet, if he sent her that ring, she would
immediately, upon the sight of it, recollect her former tenderness, would
afford him again a h aring, and would lend a favour∣able ear to his apology.
Essex, notwithstanding all his misfortunes, reserved this precious gift
to the last extremity; but after his trial and condemnation, he resolved to
try the experiment, and he committed the ring to the countess of Nottingham,
whom he desired to deliver it to the Queen. The countess was pre∣vailed on
by her husband, who was Essex's capital enemy, not to execute the
commission; and Elizabeth, who still expected that her favourite would
make this appeal to her tenderness, and who ascribed the neglect of it to
his invin∣cible obstinacy, was, after much delay, and many internal combats,
pushed by resentment and policy to sign the warrant for his execution.
The countess of Nottingham, falling into sickness, and sinding
herself approach towards her end, was seized with remorse for her
conduct; and having obtained a visit from the Queen, she craved her pardon,
and revealed to her the fatal secret. The Queen, astonished with this
incident, burst into a surious passion: She shook the dying
countess in her bed; and crying to her, <HI>That God might pardon her, but
she never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould,</HI> she broke
from her, and thenceforth resigned herself over to the deepest 
<PB N="714" REF="319"/> and most incurable melancholy. She rejected all
consolation: She even refused food and sustenance: And throwing
herself on the floor, she kept herself silent and immoveable, feeding
her thoughts on her afflictions, and declaring life and existence an
insufferable burthen to her. Few words she uttered; and they were all
expressive of some inward grief which she cared not to reveal: But
sighs and groans were the chief vent which she gave to her despondency,
and which, tho' they discovered her sorrows, were able to ease or abate
them. Ten days and nights she lay upon the carpet, leaning on cushions
which her maids brought her; and her physicians could not persuade her to
allow herself to be put to bed, much less to make trial of any remedies
which they prescribed to her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. No.
276.</NOTE>. Her anxi∣ous mind at last had so long preyed on her frail
body, that her end was visibly approaching; and the council, being
assembled, sent the lord keeper, the lord admiral, and the secretary,
to know her mind with regard to her successor. She answered with a
faint voice, that as she had held a regal scepter, she desired no other
than a royal successor. Cecil requesting her to explain herself more
parti∣cularly, she subjoined, that she would have a King to succeed
her; and who should that be but her nearest kinsman, the King of Scots.
Being then advised by the archbishop of Canterbury, to fix her thoughts
upon God, she replied, that she did so, nor did her mind in the least
wander from him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And death,</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 March.</NOTE> Her voice soon after left
her, her senses failed, she fell into a lethargic slumber, which
continued some hours, and she expired gently, without farther struggle or
convulsion, in the seventieth year of her age, and forty-fifth of her
reign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And charac∣ter.</NOTE> SUCH a dark cloud
overcast the evening of that day, which had shone out with a mighty
lustre in the eyes of all Europe. There are few great personages in
history who have been more exposed to the calumny of enemies, and the
adulation of friends, than Queen Elizabeth; and yet there scarce is any,
whose reputation has been more certainly determined, by the unanimous
consent of posterity. The unusual length of her administration, and the
strong features of her character, were able to overcome all prejudices; and
obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and her admirers
somewhat of their panegyrics, have at last, in spite of political
factions, and what is more, of religious animosities, produced an uniform
judgment with regard to her conduct. Her vigour, her constancy, her
magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, address, are allowed to merit the
high∣est praises, and appear not to have been surpassed by any
person who ever filled a throne: A conduct less rigorous, less imperious,
more sincere, more indulgent to her people, would have been requisite to
form a perfect character. By the force of her mind, she controuled all her
more active and stronger qualities, and <PB N="715" REF="320"/> prevented them
from running into excess: Her heroism was exempt from all te∣merity, her
frugality from avarice, her friendship from partiality, her enterprize from
turbulency and a vain ambition: She guarded not herself with equal care or
equal success from lesser infirmities; the rivalship of beauty, the
desire of admiration, the jealousy of love, and the sallies of anger.</P>
<P>HER singular talents for government were founded equally on
her temper and on her capacity. Endowed with a great command over herself,
she soon obtain∣ed an uncontrouled ascendant over her people; and while
she merited all their esteem by her real virtues, she also engaged
their affection by her pretended ones. Few sovereigns of England succeeded
to the throne in more difficult circum∣stances; and none ever conducted the
government with such uniform success and felicity. Tho' unacquainted with
the practice of toleration, the true secret for managing religious factions,
she preserved her people, by her superior prudence, from those
confusions in which theological controversy had involved all the
neigh∣bouring nations: And tho' her enemies were the most powerful princes of
Eu∣rope, the most active, the most enterprizing, the least scrupulous,
she was able by her vigour to make deep impressions on their state: Her
own greatness mean∣while remained untouched and unimpaired.</P>
<P>THE wise ministers, and brave warriors, who flourished
during her reign, share the praise of her success; but instead of
lessening the applause due to her, they make great addition to it. They
owed, all of them, their advancement to her choice; they were supported by
her constancy; and with all their ability, they were never able to acquire
any undue ascendant over her. In her family, in her court, in her kingdom,
she remained equally mistress: The force of the tender passions was
great over her, but the force of her mind was still superior; and the
combat which her victory visibly cost her, serves only to display the
firmness of her resolution, and the loftiness of her ambitious
sentiments.</P>
<P>THE fame of this princess, tho' it has surmounted the
prejudices both of fac∣tion and of bigotry, yet lies still exposed to
another prejudice, which is more durable because more natural, and which,
according to the different views in which we survey her, is capable either of
exalting beyond measure, or diminish∣ing the lustre of her character.
This prejudice is founded on the consideration of her sex. When we
contemplate her as a woman, we are apt to be struck with the highest
admiration of her great qualities and extensive capacity; but we are also
apt to require some more softness of disposition, some greater
lenity of temper, some of those amiable weaknesses by which her sex
is distinguished. But the true method of estimating her merit, is to lay
aside all these considerations, and to <PB N="716" REF="321"/> consider
her merely as a rational being, placed in authority, and entrusted with the
government of mankind. We may find it difficult to reconcile our fancy to her
as a wife or a mistress; but her qualities as a sovereign, tho' with
some considerable exceptions, are the object of undisputed applause and
approba∣tion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Government, manners, commerce, arts, and
learning.</NOTE> THE party amongst us who have distinguished themselves
by their adherence to liberty and a popular government, have long indulged
their prejudices against the succeeding race of princes, by bestowing
unbounded panegyrics on the virtue and wisdom of Elizabeth. They have even
been so extremely ignorant of the transactions of this reign, as to extol
her for a quality which, of all others, she was the least possest of;
a tender regard for the constitution, and a concern for the liberties and
privileges of her people. But as it is scarce possible for the
pre∣possessions of party to throw a veil much longer over facts so
palpable and unde∣niable, there is danger lest the public should run into
the opposite extreme, and should entertain an aversion to the memory of a
princess who exercised the royal authority in a manner so much contrary
to all the ideas which we at present enter∣tain of a legal constitution.
But Elizabeth only supported the prerogatives which were transmitted to her
by her immediate predecessors: She believed that her sub∣jects were
entitled to no more liberty than their ancestors enjoyed: She found that they
entirely acquiesced in her arbitrary administration: And it was not
na∣tural for her to find fault with a form of government, by which she
herself was invested with such unlimited authority. In the particular
exertions of power, the question ought never to be forgot, <HI>What is
best?</HI> But in the general distri∣bution of power among the several
members of a constitution, there can seldom be admitted any other
question, than <HI>What is usual?</HI> Few examples occur of princes, who
have willingly resigned their power: None of those who have, without
struggle, allowed it to be extorted from them. If any other rule than ancient
practice be followed, factions and dissentions must multiply w thout end:
And tho' many constitutions, and none more than the British, have been
im∣proved even by violent innovations, the praise which we bestow on
those patriots, to whom we are indebted for our privileges, ought to be given
with some reserve, and surely without the least rancour against
those who adhered to the ancient constitution.</P>
<P>IN order to understand the ancient constitution of England,
there is not a pe∣riod which deserves more to be studied than the reign of
Elizabeth. The pre∣rogatives <PB N="717" REF="322"/> of this princess were
scarce ever disputed, and she therefore employed them without scruple:
Her imperious temper, a circumstance in which she went far beyond her
successors, rendered her exertions of power violent and frequent, and
discovered the full extent of her authority: The great popularity which she
enjoyed, proves, that the did not infringe any established liberties of the
people: There remain monuments numerous enough to as ertain the most noted
acts of her administration: And tho' th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se monument▪ must be sought remote from the ordinary
historians, they become only the more authenti on that account, and serve
as a stronger proof, that the particular exertions of her power were
conceiv∣ed to be nothing but the ordinary course of administration, since
they were not thought remarkable enough to be recorded even by contemporary
writers. If there was any difference in this particular, the people, in former
reigns, seem rather to have been more submissive and servile than
during the age of Elizabeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a memorial of the

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>. It may not here be
improper to recount some of the ancient prerogatives of the crown, and lay
open the sources of that great power which the English monarchs for∣merly
enjoyed.</P>
<P>ONE of the most ancient and most established
instruments of power was the court of Star-chamber, which possessed
an unlimited discretionary authority of fining, imprisoning, and inflict ng
corporal punishment, and whose juris∣diction extended to all sorts of
offences, contempts, and disorders, that lay not within reach of the common
law. The members of this court con∣sisted of the privy council and the
judges; men, who all of them enjoyed their offices during pleasure: And when
the prince himself was present, he was the sole judge, and all the others
could only interpose with their advice. There needed but this one court in
any government, to put an end to all regular, legal, and exact plans of
liberty. For who durst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t
himself in opposition to the crown and ministry, or aspire to the
character of being a patr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of
freedom, while ex∣posed to so arbitrary a jurisdiction? I much
question, whether any of the abso∣lute monarchies in Europe contain, at
present, so illegal and desp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a tribunal.</P>
<P>THE court of High Commission was another jurisdiction
still more terrible, both because the crime of heresy, of which it took
co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ance, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more unde∣sinable than any civil offence, and beca

and imprisonments imposed by this court were frequent: The deprivations and
suspensions of the clergy for non-conformity, were also very numerous,
and comprehended at one time the third of all the ecclesiastics of
England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Neal, vol. I. p. 479.</NOTE>. The Queen,
in a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury, said ex∣pressly, that she
was resolved, 
<Q REND="inline">"That no man should be suffered to decline
ei∣ther on the left or on the right hand, from the drawn line limited by
autho∣rity, and by her laws and injunctions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Murden, p. 183.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>BUT Martial Law went far beyond even these two courts in a
prompt and arbi∣trary and violent method of decision. Whenever there was any
insurrection or public disorder, the crown employed martial law; and it was
during that time exercised not only over the soldiers, but over the whole
people: Any one might be punished as a rebel, or an aider and abettor of
rebellion, whom the provost∣marshal or lieutenant of counties, or their
deputies, pleased to suspect. Lord Bacon says, that the trial at common
law granted the earl of Essex, and his fel∣low conspirators, was a
favour: For that the case would have born and required the severity of
martial law<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vol. IV. p. 510.</NOTE>. We have
seen instances of its being employed by Queen Mary in defence of orthodoxy.
There remains a letter of Queen Elizabeth's to the earl of Suffex, after the
suppression of the northern rebellion, in which she reproves him
sharply, because she had not heard of his having done any execution by
martial law<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">MS. of lord Royston's from the
Paper Office.</NOTE>. But the King of England did not always limit the
exercise of martial law to the times of war and rebellion. In 1552, when
there was no rebellion or insurrection, King Edward granted a commission
of martial law; and empowered the commissioners to execute it, <HI>as
should be thought by their discretions most neces∣sary</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Strype's Eccles. Memoirs, vol. II. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, 458, 9.</NOTE>. Queen Elizabeth too
was not sparing in the use of martial law. In 1573, one Peter Burchet, a
puritan, being persuaded that it was lawful or meritorious to kill such as
opposed the truth of the gospel, ran into the streets, and wounded
Hawkins, the famous sea-captain, whom he took for Hatton, the Queen's
fa∣vourite. The Queen was so incensed, that she ordered him to be
punished in∣stantly by martial law; but upon the remonstrance of some
prudent counsellors, who told her, that that law ought to be confined to
turbulent times, she recalled her order, and delivered over Burchet to the
common law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 449. Strype, vol. II. p.
288.</NOTE>. But she continued not always so reserved in exerting this
authority. There remains a proclamation of hers, where she orders martial law
to be used against all such as import bulls, or even forbidden books and
pamphlets from abroad<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III.
p. 570.</NOTE>; and prohibits the lieute∣nants <PB N="719" REF="324"/> or their
deputies to be questioned for their arbitrary punishment of such
of∣fenders, <HI>any law or statute to the contrary in any wise
notwithstanding.</HI> We have another act of hers still more extraordinary.
The streets of London were very much infested with idle vagabonds and
riotous persons: The lord mayor had endeavoured to repress this disorder:
The Star-chamber had exerted its authority, and inflicted punishment on
these rioters: But the Queen, finding those remedies ineffectual, revived
martial law, and gave Sir Thomas Wilford a commission of
provost-marshal: 
<Q REND="inline">"Granting him authority, and commanding him,
upon sig∣nification given by the justices of peace in London or the
neighbouring coun∣ties, of such offenders, worthy to be speedily executed
by martial law, to at∣tach and take the same persons, and in the presence
of the said justices, ac∣cording to justice of martial law, to execute
them upon the gallows or gibbet openly, or near to such place where the
said rebellious and incorrigible offen∣ders shall be found to have
committed the said great offences<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom.
XVI. p 279.</NOTE>."</Q> I suppose it will be difficult to produce an
instance of such an act of authority in any place nearer than
Muscovy.</P>
<P>THE Star-chamber, and High Commission, and Court Martial,
tho' arbitrary jurisdictions, yet had still some pretence of a trial, at
least a sentence; but there was a grievous punishment very familiarly
inflicted in that age, without any other authority than the warrant of a
secretary of state, or of the privy council<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to prison,
because they refused to pay the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> p
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>; and that was,
imprisonment, in any jail, and during any time, that these ministers
should think proper. In suspicious times, all the jails were full of
prisoners of state; and these unhappy victims of public jealousy were
sometimes thrown into dungeons, and loaded with irons, and treated in the
most cruel manner, without any remedy from law.</P>
<P>THIS practice was an indirect way of employing torture: But the
ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k itself was frequently
used, upon any suspicion, without other authority than a warrant from the
secretary or the privy council. Even the council in the marches of Wales were
empowered, by their very commission, to make use of torture, whenever
they thought proper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 196.</NOTE>. There
cannot be a stronger proof how lightly the rack was employed, than the
following story, told by lord Bacon. We shall give it in his own words. 
<Q REND="inline">"The Queen was mightily incented against
Haywarde, on account of a book he dedicated to lord Essex, being a story
of the first year of King Henry the fourth, thinking it a seditious prelude
to put into <PB N="720" REF="325"/> the people's heads boldness and faction:
She said, she had an opinion that there was treason in it, and asked
me, if I could not find any places in it, that might be drawn within the case
of treason: Whereto I answered, For treason, sure I found none; but for
felony, very many: And when her majesty hastily asked me, wherein? I told
her, the author had committed very apparent theft: For he had taken most of
the sentences of Cornelius Tacitus, and translated them into English, and
put them into his text. And another time, when the Queen could not be
persuaded, that it was his writing whose name was to it, but that it had
some more mischievous author, and said with great indignation, that she
would have him racked, to produce his author; I replied, nay, madam, he is a
doctor, never rack his person, but rack his stile: Let him have pen, ink,
and paper, and help of books, and be enjoined to con∣tinue the story where it
breaketh off, and I will undertake, by collating the styles, to judge whether
he were the author or no<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p.
81.</NOTE>."</Q> Thus, had it not been for Bacon's humanity, or rather his wit,
this author, a man of letters, had been put to the rack, for a most innocent
performance. His real offence was, his de∣dicating a book to that munificent
patron of the learned, the earl of Essex, at a time when this nobleman lay
under disgrace with her majesty.</P>
<P>THE Queen's menace of trying and punishing Haywarde for
treason, could easily have been executed, let his book have been ever so
innocent. While so many terrors hung over the people's heads, no jury durst
have acquitted a man whom the court was resolved to have condemned. The
practice also of not confronting the witnesses with the prisoner, gave
the crown lawyers all imagin∣able advantages against him. And, indeed, there
occurs not one instance, dur∣ing all these reigns, that the sovereign, or
the ministers, were ever disappointed in the issue of a prosecution.
Timid juries, and judges who held their offices during pleasure, never failed
to second all the views of the court.</P>
<P>THE power of pressing, and obliging any person to accept
of any office, was another prerogative totally incompatible with freedom.
Osborne gives the fol∣lowing account of Elizabeth's method of employing this
prerogative. 
<Q REND="inline">"In case she sound any likely to interrupt
her occasions," says he, "she did seasonably prevent him by a
chargeable employment abroad, or putting him upon some service at home,
which she knew least grateful to the people: Contrary to a false maxim,
since practised with far worse success, by such princes as thought
it better husbandry to buy off enemies than reward friends<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Page <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>."</Q> The practice with which Osborne reproaches the two
immediate successors of Elizabeth, pro∣ceeded <PB N="721" REF="326"/>
partly from the extreme difficulty of their situation, partly from the
greater lenity of their disposition. The power of pressing, as may
naturally be imagin∣ed, was often abused; and money was exacted by the
officers for freeing persons from the service<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Murden, p. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE government of England in that age, bore some resemblance
to that of Turkey at present: The sovereign possessed every power,
except that of imposing taxes: And in both countries this limitation,
unsupported by other privileges, appears rather prejudicial to the people. In
Turkey, it obliges the Sultan to per∣mit the extortion of the bashas and
governors of provinces, from whom he af∣terwards squeezes presents, or
takes forfeitures: In England, it engaged the Queen to erect monopolies, and
grant patents for exclusive trade: An invention so pernicious, that had
she gone on, during a tract of years, at her own rate, England, the seat of
riches, arts, and commerce, would have contained at present as little
industry as Morocco, or the coast of Barbary.</P>
<P>WE may further observe, that this valuable privilege, valuable
only because it proved afterwards the means by which the Parliament extorted
all their other pri∣vileges, was very much encroached on, in an indirect
manner, during the reign of Elizabeth, as well as of her predecessors. She
often exacted loans from her people; an arbitrary and unequal kind of
imposition, and which individuals felt severely: For tho' the money had
been regularly restored, which was seldom the case<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 362.</NOTE>, it lay in the prince's hands
without interest, which was a sensible loss to the individuals from
whom the money was borrowed.</P>
<P>THERE remains a proposal made by the lord Burleigh, for
levying a general loan on the people, equivalent to a subsidy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 518, 519</NOTE>; a scheme which would
have laid the burthen more equally, but which was, in different words, nothing
but a taxation, imposed without consent of Parliament. It is remarkable,
that the scheme, thus proposed, without any visible necessity, by
that wise minister, is the very same which Henry the eighth attempted,
and which Charles the first, en∣raged by ill usage from his Parliament, and
reduced to the greatest difficulties, put afterwards in practice, to the
great discontent of the nation.</P>
<P>THE demand of benevolence was another invention of that age for
taxing the people. This practice was so little conceived to be irregular,
that the commons, in 1585, offered the Queen a benevolence; which she very
generously refused, as having no occasion, at that time, for money<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 494.</NOTE>. Queen Mary also, by an or∣der of
council, increased the customs in some branches; and her sister
imitated <PB N="722" REF="327"/> the example<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 362.</NOTE>. There was a species of
ship-money imposed at the time of the Spanish invasion. The several
ports were required to equip a certain number of ships at their own charge;
and such was the alacrity of the people for the public defence, that some
of the ports, particularly London, sent double the number demanded of
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 267.</NOTE>. When any levies were
made for Ireland, France, or the Low Countries, the Queen obliged the counties
to raise the soldiers, to arm and clothe them, and carry them to the
sea-ports at their own charge. New-Year's-Gifts were, at that time, expected
from the nobility, and from the more consi∣derable gentry<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memor. vol. I. p. 137.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PURVEYANCE was another method of taxation, unequal, arbitrary,
and op∣pressive. The whole kingdom felt sensibly the burthen of this
imposition; and it was regarded as a great privilege which was conferred on
Oxford and Cam∣bridge, to prohibit the purveyors from taking any commodities
within five miles of these universities. The Queen victualled her navy by
means of this preroga∣tive, during the first years of her government<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 388.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WARDSHIP was the most regular and legal of all these
impositions by prero∣gative: Yet was it a great badge of slavery, and
oppressive to the great families. When an estate fell to a female, the
sovereign obliged her to marry any one he pleased: Whether the heir was
male or female, the crown enjoyed the whole profit of the rents during the
minority. The giving a rich wardship was an usual method of rewarding a
courtier or favourite.</P>
<P>THE inventions were endless, which arbitrary power might
employ for extorting of money, while the people imagined that their property
was secured by debarring the crown from imposing taxes. Strype has
preserved a speech of lord Burleigh to the Queen and council, wherein are
contained some particulars not a little extra∣ordinary<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Annals, vol. IV. p. 234, &amp; seq.</NOTE>. Burleigh proposes
that she should erect a court for the correction of all abuses, and
should confer on the commissioners a general inquisitorial power over
the whole kingdom. He sets before her eyes the example of her wise
grand∣father, Henry the seventh, who, by such methods, augmented extremely
his revenue; and he recommends, that this new court should proceed, 
<Q REND="inline">"as well by the direction and ordinary course
of the laws, as by virtue of her majesty's su∣preme regiment and
<HI>absolute power, from whence law proceeded.</HI>"</Q> In a word, he
expects from this institution, greater accession to the royal treasure,
than Henry the eighth derived from the abolition of the abbeys, and all the
forfeitures of the ecclesiastical revenues. This project of lord Burleigh
needs not, I think, <PB N="723" REF="328"/> any comment. A form of government
must be very arbitrary, where a wise and good minister could make such
a proposal to the sovereign.</P>
<P>EMBARGOES on merchandize was another engine of royal power, by
which the English princes were able to extort money from the people. We have
seen instances in the reign of Mary. Elizabeth, before her coronation,
issued an or∣der to the custom-house, prohibiting the sale of all
crimson silks which should be imported, till the court was first
provided<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 27.</NOTE>. She expected,
no doubt, a good penny-worth from the merchants, while they lay under this
restraint.</P>
<P>THE Parliament pretended to the right of enacting laws, as well
as of grant∣ing subsidies; but this privilege was, during that age, still
more insignificant than the other. Queen Elizabeth expressly prohibited
them from meddling with state matters or ecclesiastical causes; and
she openly sent the members to prison, who dared to transgress her
imperial edict in these particulars. There passed few Par∣liaments,
during her reign, where there occur not instances of this arbitrary
conduct.</P>
<P>BUT the legislative power of the Parliament was a mere
fallacy, while the so∣vereign was universally acknowleged to possess
a dispensing power, by which all the laws could be invalidated, and
rendered of no effect. The use of this power was also an indirect method
practised for erecting monopolies. Where the statutes laid any branch of
manufacture under restrictions, the sovereign, by exempting one person
from the laws, gave him in effect the monopoly of that commodity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. W. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> D'Ewes, 4. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>. There was no grievance, at
that time, more universally complained of, than the frequent dispensing
with the penal laws<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Monson, p
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT in reality, the crown possessed the full
legislative power, by means of pro∣clamations, which might affect any
subject of the greatest importance, and which the Star-chamber took care to
see more rigorously executed than the laws them∣selves. The motives of
these proclamations were sometimes very ridiculous. Queen Elizabeth had
taken offence at the smell of woad; and she issued an edict prohibiting
any one to cultivate that useful plant<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Townsend's Journal, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. Stow's Annals.</NOTE>. She was also pleased to take offence
at the long swords and high ruffs then in fashion: She sent about
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> officers, to break every man's
sword, and clip every man's ruff, which was be∣yond a certain length<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Townsend's Journal, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. Stow's Annals. Strype, vol. II. p. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>. This practice resembles
somewhat the method employ∣ed by the great Czar Peter, to make his subjects
change their garb.</P>
<P><PB N="724" REF="329"/> THE Queen's prohibition of the
prophesyings was founded on a better reason▪ but shews still the
unlimited extent of her prerogative. Two or three people could not meet
together, in order to read the scriptures, and confer about reli∣gion, tho'
in ever so orthodox a manner, without her permission.</P>
<P>THERE were many other branches of prerogative incompatible with
an exact or regular enjoyment of liberty. None of the nobility could marry
without per∣mission from the sovereign. The Queen detained the earl of
Southampton long in prison, because he privately married the earl of
Essex's cousin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p.
422.</NOTE>. No man could travel without the consent of the prince. Sir
William Evers underwent a severe persecution, because he had presumed
to pay a private visit to the King of Scots<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 511.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament in the thirteenth of the Queen praised her for
not imitating the practice, usual among her predecessors, of stopping
the course of justice by particular warrants<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 141.</NOTE>. There could not possibly be a greater
abuse, nor a stronger mark of arbitrary power; and the Queen, in refraining
from it, was very laudable. But she was by no means constant in this
reserve. There remain in the public records some warrants of her's for
exempting persons from all law-suits and pro∣secutions<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 652, 708, 777.</NOTE>; and these warrants,
she says, she grants from her royal prerogative, which she will not
allow to be disputed.</P>
<P>IT is easy to imagine, that, in such a government, no
justice could, by course of law, be obtained of the sovereign, unless
he was willing to allow it. In the naval expedition, undertaken by Raleigh and
Forbisher against the Spaniards, in 1592, a very rich carrack was taken
worth two hundred thousand pounds. The Queen's share in the adventure was
only a tenth part; but as the prize was so great, and exceeded so much the
expectations of all the adventurers, she was determined not to rest
contented with her share. Raleigh, humbly and earnestly, begged her to
accept of an hundred thousand pounds, in lieu of all demands, or rather
exactions; and says, that the present, which the proprietors were willing
to make her of eighty thousand pounds, was the greatest that ever a prince
re∣ceived from a subject<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p.
128, 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT it is no wonder the Queen, in her administration, should
pay so little re∣gard to liberty; while the parliament itself, in enacting
laws, were so entirely negligent of it. The persecuting statutes, which
they passed against papists and puritans, are extremely contrary to the
genius of freedom; and by exposing such multitudes to the tyranny of
priests and bigots, accustomed the people to the <PB N="725" REF="330"/>
most disgraceful subjection. Their conferring an unlimited supremacy on
the Queen, or what is worse, acknowleging her inherent right to it, was
another proof of their voluntary servitude.</P>
<P>THE law of the 23d of her reign, making seditious words
against the Queen capital, is another very tyrannical statute; and an
use, no less tyrannical, was sometimes made of it. The case of Udal, a
puritannical clergyman, seems singular, even in those arbitrary times.
This man had published a book called a demonstration of discipline, in
which he inveighed against the government of bishops; and tho' he had
carefully endeavoured to conceal his name, he was thrown into prison upon
suspicion, and brought to his trial for this offence. It was pretended,
that the bishops were part of the Queen's political body; and to speak
against them, was really to attack her, and was therefore felony by the
statute. This was not the only iniquity, to which Udal was exposed. The
judges would not allow the jury to determine any thing but the fact, whether
Udal had wrote the book, or not, without examining his intention, or the
im∣port of the words. In order to prove the fact, the crown lawyers did not
pro∣duce a single witness to the court: They only read the testimony of
two persons absent, one of which said that Udal had told him he was the
author; another, that a friend of Udal's had said so. They would not allow
Udal to produce any exculpatory evidence; which, they said, was never to be
permitted against the Queen. And they tendered him an oath, by which he was
required to swear, that he was not author of the book; and his refusal to
give that testimony was employed as the strongest proof of his guilt. It
is almost needless to add, that, notwithstanding these multiplied
iniquities, a verdict of death was given by the jury against Udal: For as the
Queen was extremely bent upon his prosecution, it was impossible he could
escape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 144. Strype, vol. IV.
p. 21. Id. Life of Whitgift, p. 343.</NOTE>. He died in prison before the
execution of the sentence.</P>
<P>THE case of Penry was, if possible, still harder. This
man was a zealous pu∣ritan, or rather a Brownist; and he had wrote against
the hierarchy several tracts, such as Martin Mar-prelate, <HI>Theses
Martinianae,</HI> and other compositions full of low scurrility and
petulant satyre. After concealing himself for some years, he was
seized; and as the statute against seditious words required that the
crimi∣nal should be tried within a year after committing the offence, he
could not be indicted for his printed books. He was therefore tried for some
papers found in his pocket, as if he had thereby scattered sedition<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Whitgift, book IV. chap. II. Neal,
vol. I. p. 564.</NOTE>. It was also imputed to him, by the lord keeper,
Puckering, that in some of these papers, 
<Q REND="inline">"he had only acknow∣leged <PB N="726" REF="331"/>
her majesty's royal power to <HI>establish</HI> laws, ecclesiastical
and civil; but had avoided the <HI>usual</HI> terms of <HI>making, enacting,
decreeing, and ordaining</HI> laws: Which imply," says the lord keeper, "a
most absolute authority<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p.
177.</NOTE>."</Q> Penry for these offences was condemned and executed.</P>
<P>THUS we have seen, that <HI>the most absolute</HI>
authority of the sovereign, to make use of the lord keeper's phrase, was
established on above twenty branches of pre∣rogative, which are now
abolished, and which were, every one of them, totally incompatible with the
liberty of the subject. But what ensured more effectually the slavery of
the people, than even these branches of prerogative, was, the
esta∣blished principles of the times, which attributed to the prince such
an absolute and indefeizable authority, as was supposed to be the origin
of all law, and could be bound and circumscribed by none. The homilies,
published for the use of the clergy, and which they were enjoined to read
every Sunday in all the churches, inculcate every where a blind, and unlimited
passive-obedience to the prince, which, on no account, and under no
pretence, is it ever lawful for them, in the smallest article, to depart
from or infringe. Much noise has been made, because some court chaplains,
during the succeeding reigns, were permitted to preach such doctrines; but
there is a great difference between these sermons, and discourses
published by authority, avowed by the prince and council, and promulgated to
the whole nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gifford, a clergyman, was
suspended in 1584, for preaching up a limited obedience to the civil
magistrate. Neal, vol. I. p. 435.</NOTE>. So thoroughly were these
principles imbibed by the people, during the reigns of Elizabeth and her
predecessors, that opposition to them was regarded as the most flagrant
sedition, and was not even rewarded by that public praise and approbation,
which can alone support men under such dangers and difficulties, as attend
the resistance of tyrannical authority. It was only during the next
generation that the noble principles of liberty took root, and spreading
themselves, under the shelter of puritannical absurdities, became
fashionable among the people.</P>
<P>IT is worth remarking, that the advantage, usually ascribed
to absolute mo∣narchy, a greater regularity of police and a more strict
execution of the laws, did not attend the antient English government, tho' in
many respects it fell under that denomination: A demonstration of this
truth is contained in a judicious paper, which is preserved by Strype<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Annals, vol. IV. p. 290. &amp; seq.</NOTE>, and
which was wrote by an eminent jus∣tice of peace of Somersetshire, in the
year 1596, near the end of the Queen's reign, when the authority of that
princess may be supposed to be fully corrobo∣rated by time, and her
maxims of government improved by long practice. This <PB N="727" REF="332"/>
paper contains an account of the disorders which then prevailed in the county
of Somerset. The author says, that forty persons had been there executed
in a year for robberies, thefts, and other felonies; thirty-five burnt in the
hand, thirty-seven whipt, one hundred and eighty-three discharged: That
those who were discharged were most wicked and desperate persons, who
never could come to any good, because they would not work, and none would
take them into service: That notwithstanding this great number of
indictments, the fifth part of the felonies committed in the county were not
brought to a trial, the greater number escaped censure, either from the
superior cunning of the selons, the re∣missness of the magistrates,
or the foolish lenity of the people: That the rapines committed by the
infinite number of wicked, wandering, idle people were into∣lerable to the poor
countrymen, and obliged them to a perpetual watch of their sheep-folds, their
pastures, their woods and their corn-fields: That the other counties of
England were in no better condition than Somersetshire; and many of them
were even in a worse: That there were at least three or four hundred
able∣bodied vagabonds in every county, who lived by theft and rapine; and who
sometimes met in troops to the number of sixty, and committed spoil on
the in∣habitants: That if all the felons of this kind were assembled, they
would be able, if reduced to good subjection, to give the greatest enemy
her majesty has a strong battle: And that the magistrates themselves
were intimidated from executing jus∣tice upon them; and there were examples
of justices of peace, who, after giving sentence against rogues, had
interposed to stop the execution of their own sen∣tence, for fear of the
danger, which hung over them from the confederates of these felons.</P>
<P>IN the year 1575, the Queen complained in Parliament of the bad
execution of the laws; and threatened, if the magistrates were not, for the
future, more vigilant, that she would entrust authority to indigent and
needy persons, who would find an interest in the more exact distribution
of justice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 23<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. It appears, that she was as good as her
word. For in 1601, there were great complaints made in Parliament of the rapine
of justices of peace; and a member said, that this magistrate was an
animal, who, for half a dozen of chickens, would
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pense with a dozen of penal
statutes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p 661-664.</NOTE>. It is
not easy to account for this relaxation of government, and neglect of police
during a reign of so much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as
that of Elizabeth. The small revenue of the crown is the most likely cause
that can be assigned. The Queen had it not in her power to interest a
great number in assist∣ing her to execute the laws.</P>
<P><PB N="728" REF="333"/> ON the whole, the English have no
reason, from the example of their an∣cestors, to be in love with the
picture of absolute monarchy; or to prefer the un∣limited authority of the
prince, and his unbounded prerogatives, to that noble liberty, that sweet
equality, and that happy security, by which they are at pre∣sent
distinguished above all nations of the universe. The utmost that can be
said in favour of the antient government (and perhaps it may be said with
truth) is, that the power of the prince, tho' really unlimited, was exercised
after the European manner, and entered not into every part of the
administration; that the instances of a high exerted prerogative were not
so frequent as to render pro∣perty sensibly insecure, or reduce the
people to a total servitude; that the free∣dom from faction, the quickness
of execution, and the promptitude of those measures, which could be taken
for offence or defence, made some compensation for the want of a legal and
determined liberty; that as the prince commanded no mercenary army, there was a
tacit check on him, which maintained the go∣vernment in that medium, to which
the people had been accustomed; and that this situation of England was in
reality more remote, tho' seemingly it approached nearer, a despotic and
eastern monarchy, than the present government of that kingdom, where the
people, tho' guarded by multiplied laws, are totally naked, defenceless, and
disarmed.</P>
<P>WE shall close this volume with a brief account of the
revenues, the mili∣tary force, the commerce, the arts, and the learning of
England during this period.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth's oeconomy was very remarkable; and in some
instances seemed to border on avarice. The smallest expence, if it
could possibly be saved, ap∣peared considerable in her eyes; and even
the charge of an express, during the most delicate transactions, was not
below her notice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Negot. p. 21.</NOTE>. She was
also attentive to every profit; and embraced opportunities of gain, which may
appear somewhat extraordinary. She kept the see of Ely vacant nineteen
years, in order to pocket the revenue<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype,
vol. IV. p. 351.</NOTE>; and it was usual with her, when she promoted a
bishop, to take the opportunity of pillaging the see of some of its
manors<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 215.</NOTE>. But that there was
in reality little or no avarice in the Queen's temper appears from this
circum∣stance, that she never amassed any treasure; and even
refused subsidies from the Parliament, when she had no present
occasion for them. Yet we must not con∣clude from this circumstance, that
her oeconomy proceeded from a tender concern for her people: She loaded them
with monopolies and exclusive patents, which are infinitely more
oppressive than the most heavy taxes, levied in a legal and re∣gular 
<PB N="729" REF="334"/> manner. The real source of her frugal conduct was
derived from her de∣sire of independency, and her care to preserve her
dignity, which would have been endangered, had she reduced herself to the
necessity of having frequent recourse to parliamentary supplies. In
consequence of this motive, the Queen, tho' en∣gaged in successful and
necessary wars, thought it more prudent to make a con∣tinual dilapidation
of the royal demesnes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 141.
D'Ewes, p. 151, 457, 525, 629. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 363.</NOTE>, than demand the
most moderate sup∣plies from the commons. As she lived unmarried and had
no posterity, she was contented to serve her present turn, tho' at the
expence of her successors, who, by reason of this policy, joined to
other accidents, found themselves, on a sudden, reduced to the most
extreme indigence.</P>
<P>THE splendor of a court was, during this age, a great part of
the public charge; and as Elizabeth was a single woman, and expensive in no
species of magnificence, except cloaths, this circumstance enabled her to
perform great things by her narrow revenue. She is said to have paid four
millions of debt, left on the crown by her father, brother and sister; an
incredible sum for that age<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 473. I
think it impossible to reconcile this account of the public debts with that
given by Strype, Eccles. Mem. vol. II. p. 344. that in the year 1553, the
crown owed but 300,000 pounds. I own, that this last sum appears a great
deal more likely. The whole revenue of Queen Elizabeth would not in ten years
have paid four millions.</NOTE>. The states at the time of her death owed her
about eight hundred thousand pounds: And the King of France four hundred and
fifty thousand<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 29,
54.</NOTE>. Tho' that prince was extremely frugal, and after the peace of
Vervins, was continu∣ally amassing treasure, the Queen never could, by
the most pressing remonstrances, prevail on him to make payment of
those sums, which she had so generously ad∣vanced him, during his
greatest distresses. One payment of twenty thousand crowns, and
another of fifty thousand, were all she could obtain, by the strongest
representations she could make of the difficulties to which the rebellion
in Ire∣land had reduced her<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 117,
395.</NOTE>. The Queen expended on the wars with Spain between 1589 and 1593,
the sum of one million three hundred thousand pounds, beside the double
subsidy, amounting to two hundred and eighty thousand pounds, granted her
by Parliament<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 483.</NOTE>. In the
year 1599 she spent six hundred thousand pounds in six months in the
service of Ireland<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 167.</NOTE>. Sir
Robert Cecil affirmed, that in ten years time, Ireland cost her three
millions four hundred thousand pounds<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Appendix
to the earl of Essex's apology.</NOTE>. She gave the earl of Essex a
present of thirty thousand pounds upon his departure for the government of
that kingdom<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II.</NOTE>.
Lord Burleigh computed <PB N="730" REF="335"/> that the value of the gifts
conferred on that favourite amounted to three hundred thousand pounds: A
proof of her strong affection towards him! It was a com∣mon saying during
this reign; <HI>The Queen pays bountifully, tho' she rewards
spar∣ingly</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nanton's Regalia, chap.
I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is difficult to compute exactly the Queen's ordinary revenue,
but it certainly fell much short of five hundred thousand pounds a year. In
1590, she raised the customs from fourteen thousand pounds a year to
fifty thousand pounds; and obliged Sir Thomas Smith, who had farmed them, to
refund some of his former profits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 558.
This account of Camden is difficult or impossible to be reconciled to the
state of the customs in the beginning of the subsequent reign, as they
appear in the journals of the commons. See Hist. of Great Britain, vol. I.
chap. 1.</NOTE>. This improvement of the revenue was owing to the
suggestions of one Caermarden; and was extremely opposed by Burleigh,
Leicester, and Wal∣singham. But the Queen's preseverance overcame all
their opposition. The great undertakings, which she executed with so
narrow a revenue, and with such small supplies from her people, prove the
mighty effects of wisdom and oecono∣my. She received from the Parliament,
during the course of her whole reign, only twenty subsidies and
thirty-nine fifteenths. It is not easy to compute ex∣actly the amount of
these supplies; because the value of a subsidy was continually
falling; and in the end of her reign it amounted only to eighty thousand
pounds<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 630.</NOTE>, which in the
beginning had been an hundred and twenty thousand. If we sup∣pose that
the whole supplies granted Elizabeth during a reign of forty-five years
amounted to three millions, we shall not probably be much wide of the truth.
This sum makes only sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty-six
pounds a year; and it is surprizing, that while the Queen's demands were so
moderate, and her expences so well regulated, she should ever have found
any difficulty of getting a supply from the Parliament, or be reduced to make
sale of the crown-lands. But such was the extreme, I had almost said,
absurd parsimony of the Parlia∣ments during that period. They valued
nothing in comparison of their money: The members had no connexion with the
court; and the very idea, which they conceived of the trust committed to
them, was, to reduce the demands of the crown, and to grant as few supplies
as possible. The crown, on the other hand, conceived the Parliament in no
other light than a means of supply. Queen Elizabeth made a merit to her
people of seldom assembling Parliaments<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 124.</NOTE>. No redress of grievances was
expected from these assemblies: They were supposed to meet for no
other purpose than to impose taxes.</P>
<P><PB N="731" REF="336"/> BEFORE Queen Elizabeth's reign, the
English princes had always recourse to the city of Antwerp for voluntary
loans; and their credit was so low, that, be∣sides the exorbitant
interest of ten or twelve per cent, they were obliged to make the city of
London join in the security. Sir Thomas Gresham, that great and
enterprizing merchant, one of the chief ornaments of this reign, engaged the
company of merchant-adventurers to grant a loan to the Queen; and as the money
was regularly paid, her credit by degrees established itself in the city,
and she shook off this dependance on foreigners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe's Survey of London, book I. p. 286.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1559, the Queen employed Gresham to borrow for her two
hundred thou∣sand pounds at Antwerp, in order to enable her to reform the
coinage, which was at that time extremely debased<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">MS. of lord Royston's from the paper office, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>95.</NOTE>. She was so unpolitic
as to make herself an innovation in the coin; by dividing a pound of silver
into sixty-two shillings, instead of sixty, the former standard. This
is the last time, that the coin has been tampered with in England.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth, sensible how much the defence of her
kingdom depended on its naval power, was desirous to encourage commerce and
navigation: But as her monopolies tended to extinguish all domestic
industry, which is much more valuable than foreign trade, and is the
foundation of it, the general train of her conduct was very ill calculated to
serve the purpose at which she aimed, much less to promote the riches
of her people. The exclusive companies also were an immediate check on
foreign trade. Yet, notwithstanding these discouragements, the spirit
of the age was strongly bent on naval enterprizes; and besides the
mi∣litary expeditions against the Spaniards, many attempts were made for new
dis∣coveries, and many new branches of foreign commerce were opened by the
Eng∣lish. Sir Martin Forbisher undertook three fruitless voyages to
discover the north∣west passage: Davis, not disheartened by this ill
success, made a new attempt, when he discovered the straits, which
pass by his name. In 1600, the Queen granted the first patent to the East
India company: The stock of that company was seventy-two thousand pounds;
and they fitted out four ships, under the command of James Lancaster, for
this new branch of trade. The adventure was successful; and the ships
returning with a rich cargo, encouraged the com∣pany to continue that
commerce.</P>
<P>THE communication with Muscovy had been opened in Queen Mary's
time by the discovery of the passage to Archangel: But the commerce to
that country began not to be carried to a great extent till about the year
15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. The Queen 
<PB N="732" REF="337"/> obtained from the Czar an exclusive patent to the
English for the whole trade to Muscovy<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 408.</NOTE>; and she entered into a personal, as
well as national, alliance with him. This Czar was named John Basilides, a
most furious tyrant, who suspect∣ing continually the revolt of his
subjects, stipulated a safe retreat and protection in England. In order
the better to ensure himself of this resource, he proposed to marry an
English woman, and the Queen intended to have sent him the lady Anne
Hastings, daughter to the earl of Huntingdon: But when the lady was informed
of the barbarous manners of the country, she wisely declined pur∣chasing
an empire at the expence of her ease and safety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 493.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English, encouraged by the privileges, which they had
obtained from Basilides, ventured farther into these countries, than any
Europeans had for∣merly done. They transported their goods along the river
Dwina in boats made of one entire tree, which they towed and rowed up the
stream as far as Walogda. From thence, they carried them seven days journey
by land to Yerastau, and then down the Volga to Astracan. At Astracan,
they built ships, crossed the Caspian Sea, and distributed their
commodities into Persia. But this bold at∣tempt met with such
discouragements that it was never renewed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 418.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of John Basilides, his son Theodore revoked
the patent, which the English enjoyed for a monopoly of the Russian
trade; and when the Queen remonstrated against this innovation, he told her
ministers, that princes must carry an indifferent hand, as well between
their subjects as between fo∣reigners; and not convert trade, which by the
laws of nations ought to be com∣mon to all, into a monopoly for the private
gain of a few<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 493.</NOTE>. So much
juster notions of commerce were entertained by this barbarian, than were
practised by the renowned Queen Elizabeth! Theodore, however, continued
some privi∣leges to the English, on account of their being the first
discoverers of the com∣munication between Europe and his country.</P>
<P>THE trade to Turkey was begun about 1583; and that commerce was
imme∣diately confined to a company by Queen Elizabeth. Before that time, the
grand signior had always conceived England to be a dependant province of
France<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. I. p. 36.</NOTE>;
but having heard of the Queen's power and reputation, he gave a good recep∣tion
to the English, and even granted them larger privileges than he had given to
the French.</P>
<P>THE merchants of the Hanse-towns complained loudly in the
beginning of Eli∣zabeth's reign of the treatment, which they had received in
the days of King <PB N="733" REF="338"/> Edward and Queen Mary. She very
prudently replied, that as she would not innovate any thing, she would
protect them still in the immunities and privileges, which she found them
possessed of. This answer not contenting them, their com∣merce was
soon after suspended for a time, to the great advantage of the English
merchants, who tried what they could themselves effectuate for the promotion
of their commerce. They took the whole trade into their own hands; and their
returns proving successful, they divided themselves into staplers and
merchant∣adventurers; the former residing constantly at one place, the
other trying their fortunes in other towns and states abroad with cloth and
other manufactures. This success so enraged the Hanse-towns, that they
tried all the methods, which a discontented people could devise, to draw
upon the English merchants the ill opinion of other nations and states.
They prevailed so far as to obtain an im∣perial edict, by which the English
merchants were prohibited all commerce in the empire: The Queen, by way of
retaliation, retained sixty of their ships, which had been seized in the
river of Lisbon with contraband goods of the Spa∣niards. These ships the
Queen intended to have restored, as desiring to have compromised all
differences with those trading cities; but when she was informed, that a
general assembly was held at Lubec, in order to concert measures for
dis∣tressing the English trade, she caused the ships and cargoes
to be confiscated; only two of them were released to carry home the news,
and to inform these states, that she had the greatest contempt
imaginable for all their proceedings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lives of the
Admirals. vol. I. p. 470.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY the eighth, in order to fit out a navy, was obliged to
hire ships from Hamburg, Lubec, Dantzick, Genoa, and Venice: But Elizabeth,
very early in her reign, put affairs upon a better footing; both by building
some ships of her own, and by encouraging the merchants to build large
trading vessels, which, on occasion, were converted into ships of
war<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 388.</NOTE>. In 1582, the
seamen in Eng∣land were computed at fourteen thousand two hundred and
ninety-five men<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 250.</NOTE>; the
number of vessels twelve hundred and thirty-two; of which there were only
two hundred and seventeen above eighty tons. Monson computes, that tho' the
navigation decayed in the first years of James the first, by the practice
of the merchants, who carried on their trade in foreign bottoms<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 300.</NOTE>, yet before 1640, this number of
seamen was trebled in England<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 210,
256.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE navy which the Queen left at her decease appears
considerable, when we consider only the number of vessels, which were
forty-two: But when we re∣flect that none of these ships carried above
forty guns; that four only came up <PB N="734" REF="339"/> to that number; that
there were but two ships of a thousand ton; and twenty-three below five
hundred, some of fifty, and some even of twenty tons; that the whole number
of the guns belonging to the fleet were seven hundred and seventy-four<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 196. The English navy at present carries
about 14000 guns.</NOTE>; we must entertain a very contemptible idea of the
English navy, com∣pared to the force which it has now attained. In the year
1588, there were not above five vessels, equipped by the noblemen and
sea-ports, which exceeded two hundred tons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 300.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN 1599, an alarm was given of an invasion from the Spaniards;
and the Queen equipped a fleet and levied an army in a fortnight to oppose
them. Nothing gave foreigners a higher idea of the power of England than this
sudden arma∣ment. In 1575, all the militia in the kingdom were computed at an
hundred and eighty-two thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ives of

hundred and forty thousand men, besides those which Wales could
supply<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 221.</NOTE>.
These armies were formidable by their numbers; but their discipline and
experience were not proportioned. Small bodies from Dun∣kirk and Newport
frequently ran over, and plundered the east coast: So unfit was the
militia, as it was then constituted, for the defence of the kingdom. The lord
lieutenants were first appointed to the counties in this reign.</P>
<P>MR. MURDEN<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">p. 608.</NOTE> has
published a paper, which contains the military force of the nation at the
time of the Spanish Armada, and which is somewhat different from the
account given by our ordinary historians. It makes the whole able∣bodied men
of the kingdom amount to an hundred and eleven thousand five hun∣dred and
thirteen; those armed, to eighty thousand eight hundred and seventy-five;
of whom forty four thousand seven hundred and twenty-seven were trained.
It must be supposed that these able-bodied men consisted of such
only as were registered, otherwise the small number is not to be
accounted for.</P>
<P>THE state of the English manufactures was at this time very
low; and foreign wares of almost all kinds had the preference<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>05.</NOTE>. About 1590, there were
in London four persons only rated in the subsidy-books so high as four
hundred pounds<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 107.</NOTE>. This
computation is not indeed to be esteemed an exact estimate of their wealth.
In 1567, there were found on enquiry to be four thousand eight hundred and
fifty-one strangers of all nations in London: Of whom three thou∣sand eight
hundred and thirty-eight were Flemish, and only fifty-eight Scotch<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 461, 462.</NOTE>. The persecut ons in France
and the Low Countries drove afterwards a greater number of foreigners into
England; and the commerce, as well as manufactures, <PB N="735" REF="340"/> of
that kingdom was very much improved by them<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 668.</NOTE>. It was then that Sir Thomas Gresham
built, at his own charge, the magnificent fabric of the Ex∣change for the
reception of the merchants: The Queen visited it, and gave it the appellation
of the Royal Exchange.</P>
<P>THERE were two attempts made in this reign to settle colonies
in America; one by Sir Humphry Gilbert in Newfoundland, another by Sir Walter
Raleigh in Virginia: But neither of these projects proved successful. All
these noble set∣tlements were made in the following reigns. The current
money of the king∣dom, in the end of this reign, is computed at four
millions<NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Admirals, vol. I.
p. 475.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE nobility in this age supported a great deal of the ancient
magnificence in their hospitality, and in the numbers of their retainers; and
the Queen found it prudent to retrench, by proclamation, their expences in this
last particular<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. Appen. p.
54.</NOTE>. The expence of hospitality, she somewhat encouraged, by the
frequent visits she paid her nobility, and the magnificent feasts which
she received from them. The earl of Leicester gave her an entertainment in
Kenibworth castle, which was extraor∣dinary for expence and magnificence.
Among other particulars, we are told, that three hundred and sixty-five
hogsheads of beer were drank at it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Biogr.
Brit. vol. III. p. 1791.</NOTE>. The earl had fortified this castle at great
expence; and it contained arms for ten thou∣sand men<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 394.</NOTE>. The earl of Derby had a family
consisting of two hundred and forty servants<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 674.</NOTE>. Stowe remarks it as a singular proof of
beneficence in this no∣bleman, that he was contented with his rent from his
tenants, and exacted not any extraordinary services from them: A proof that
the absolute power of the sovereign, what was unavoidable, had very
generally countenanced the nobility in tyrannizing over the people. Burleigh,
tho' he was frugal, and had no pater∣nal estate; kept a family consisting
of an hundred servants<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 129.
Appen.</NOTE>. He had a standing table for gentlemen, and two other tables
for persons of meaner condition, which were always served alike, whether he
were in town or in the country. About his person he had people of great
distinction, insomuch that he could reckon up twenty gentlemen retainers
who had each a thousand pounds a year; and as many among his ordinary
servants, who were worth from a thousand pounds to three, five, ten, and
twenty thousand pounds<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Biogr. Brit. p.
1267.</NOTE>. It is to be remarked, that, tho' the revenue of the crown was at
that time very small, the ministers and courtiers found means, by employing
the exorbitant prerogative, to acquire much greater fortunes than it is
possible for them at present to gain, from their larger salaries, and
more limited authority.</P>
<P><PB N="736" REF="341"/> BUT tho' there were preserved great
remains of the ancient customs, the nobi∣lity were, by degrees, acquiring a
taste of elegant luxury; and many edifices, in particular, were built by
them, neat, large, and sumptuous, to the great or∣nament of the kingdom,
says Camden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 452</NOTE>; but to the no less
decay of the glori∣ous hospitality of the nation. It is, however, more
reasonable to think, that this new turn of expence promoted arts and
industry; while the ancient hospitality was the source of vice,
disorder, sedition, and idleness.</P>
<P>AMONG the other species of luxury, that of apparel began much
to increase during this age; and the Queen thought proper to restrain it by
proclamation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 452.</NOTE>. Her example
was very little conformable to her edicts. As no woman was ever more conceited
of her beauty, nor more desirous of making impression on the hearts of
beholders, no one ever went to a greater extravagance in apparel, or studied
more the variety and richness of her dress. She appeared almost every day
in a different habit; and tried all the several modes, by which she hoped
to render herself agreeable. She was also so fond of her cloaths, that
she never could part with any of them; and at her death she had in her
wardrobe all the different habits, to the number of three thousand, which
she had ever worn in her life-time<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Carte, vol.
III. p. 702. from Beaumont's Dispatches.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE retrenchment of the ancient hospitality, and the
diminution of retainers, were favourable to the prerogative of the sovereign;
and by disabling the great noblemen from resistance, promoted the
execution of the laws, and extended the authority of the courts of justice.
There were many particular causes in the situa∣tion and character of Henry
the seventh, which augmented the authority of the crown: Most of these
causes concurred in succeeding princes; together with the factions of
religion, and the acquisition of the supremacy, a most important ar∣ticle
of prerogative: But the manners of the age were a general cause, which
operated during this whole period, and which continually tended to diminish
the riches, and still more the influence of the Aristocracy, anciently so
formidable to the crown. The habits of luxury dissipated the immense
fortunes of the anci∣ent barons; and as the new methods of expence gave
subsistance to mechanics and merchants, who lived in an independant
manner on the fruits of their own industry, a nobleman, instead of that
unlimited ascendant which he was wont to assume over those who were
maintained at his board, or subsisted by salaries con∣ferred on them,
retained only that moderate influence which customers have over 
<PB N="737" REF="342"/> tradesmen, and which can never be dangerous to civil
government. The land∣proprietors also, having a greater demand for money than
for men, endeavoured to turn their lands to the best account with regard to
profit, and either inclosing their fields, or joining many small farms into
a few large ones, discharged those useless hands which formerly were
always at their call, in every attempt to subvert the government, or oppose
a neighbouring baron. By all these means the cities increased; the middle
rank of men began to be rich and powerful; the prince, who, in effect, was the
same with the law, was implicitly obeyed; and tho' the farther progress of
the same causes begot a new plan of liberty, founded on the privileges of
the commons, yet in the interval between the fall of the nobles and the rise
of this order, the sovereign took advantage of the present situation, and
assumed an authority almost absolute.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be commonly imagined, from the authority of lord
Bacon, and from that of Harrington, and later authors, the laws of Henry the
seventh contributed very little towards the great revolutions which happened
about this period in the English constitution. The practice of breaking
entails by a fine and recovery, had been introduced in the preceding reigns;
and this prince only gave indirectly a legal sanction to the practice, by
reforming some abuses which attend∣ed it. But the settled authority which
he acquired to the crown, enabled the so∣vereign to encroach on the
separate jurisdictions of the barons, and produced a more general and
regular execution of the laws. The counties palatine under∣went the same fate
as the feudal jurisdictions; and by a statute of Henry the eighth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hon.
VIII. c. 21.</NOTE>, the jurisdiction of these counties was annexed to the
crown, and all writs were ordained to run in the King's name. But the change of
manners was the chief cause of the secret revolution of the government, and
subverted the power of the barons.</P>
<P>LEARNING, on its first revival, was held in great estimation
by the English princes and nobles; and as it was not yet prostituted by
being too common, even the Great deemed it an object of ambition to attain a
character for literature. The four successive sovereigns, Henry,
Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, may, on one account or other, be admitted into the
class of authors. Queen Catherine Parr translated a book: Lady Jane Gray,
considering her age, and her sex, and her station, may be regarded as a
prodigy of literature. Sir Thomas Smith was raised from being professor
in Cambridge, first to be ambassador to France, and then secretary of
state. The dispatches of those times, and among others those of 
<PB N="738" REF="343"/> Burleigh himself, are very frequently interlarded with
quotations from the Greek and Latin classics. Even the ladies of the court
valued themselves on knowlege: Lady Burleigh, lady Bacon, and their two
sisters, were mistresses of the ancient, as well as modern languages;
and valued themselves more on their eurdition than on their rank and
quality.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth wrote and translated several books; and
she was familiarly acquainted with the Greek as well as Latin tongue. It is
pretended, that she made an extemporary reply in Greek to the university of
Cambridge, who had addressed her in that language. It is certain, that
she answered in Latin, without prepa∣ration, and in a very spirited
manner, to the Polish ambassador, who had been wanting in respect to
her. When she had finished, she turned about to her courtiers, and
said, 
<Q REND="inline">"God's death, my lords," (for she was much
addicted to swearing) "I have been forced this day to scour up my old
Latin, that hath long lain rusting<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Speed.</NOTE>."</Q> Elizabeth, even after she was Queen, did not
entirely drop the ambition of appearing as an author; and next to her desire
of admiration for beauty, this seems to have been the chief object of her
vanity. She tran∣slated Boethius of the Consolation of Philosophy; in
order, as she pretended, to allay her grief for Henry the fourth's change of
religion. As far as we can judge from Elizabeth's compositions, we may
pronounce, that notwithstanding her application, and her excellent parts, her
taste in literature was very indiffer∣ent: She was much inferior to her
successor in this particular, who was himself far from being a just
model of eloquence.</P>
<P>UNHAPPILY for literature, at least for the learned of this
age, the Queen's va∣nity lay more in shining by her own learning, than in
encouraging men of genius by her liberality. Spencer himself, the finest
English writer of his age, was long neglected; and after the death of Sir
Philip Sydney, his patron, was allowed to die almost for want. This poet
contains great beauties, a sweet and harmonious versification, easy
elocution, a fine imagination: Yet does the perusal of his work become so
tedious, that one never finishes it from the mere pleasure which it
affords: It soon becomes a kind of task-reading; and it requires some
essort and resolution to carry us on to the end of his long performance.
This effect, of which every one is conscious, is usually ascribed to the
change of manners: But manners have more changed since Homer's age; and yet
that poet remains still the favourite of every reader of taste and
judgment. Homer copied true natural manners, which, however rough or
uncultivated, will always form an agreeable and interesting picture: But the
pencil of the English poet was employed <PB N="739" REF="344"/> in drawing the
affectations, and conceits, and fopperies of chivalry, which appear ridiculous
as soon as they lose the recommendation of the mode. The tediousness of
continued allegory, and that too seldom striking or ingenious, has also
contri∣buted to render the <HI>Fairy Queen</HI> peculiarly tiresome; not to
mention the too great frequency of its descriptions, and the langour of its
stanza. Upon the whole, Spencer maintains his place in the shelves among
our English classics: But he is seldom seen on the table; and
scarce any one, if he dares to be ingenuous, but will confess, that,
notwithstanding all the merit of the poet, he affords an enter∣tainment with
which the palate is soon satiated. Several writers of late have amused
themselves with copying the stile of Spencer; and no imitation has been
so indifferent as not to bear a great resemblance of the original: His
