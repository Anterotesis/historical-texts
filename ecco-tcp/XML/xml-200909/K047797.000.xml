<P>A SUPPLEMENT TO HUTTON'S ARITHMETIC: CONTAINING THE SOLUTIONS, AT FULL LENGTH, OF THE PROMISCUOUS COLLECTION OF QUESTIONS PROPOSED IN THAT WORK.</P>
<P>BY THE AUTHOR.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE promiscuous collection of questions pro∣posed in the Arithmetic, was intended for the exercise of pupils after they had gone through the several rules of the book, and has been found very useful to them, by accustoming them to think, and to strike out methods of solution unassisted by other helps. But many gentlemen having expressed a de∣sire to have a publication of the solutions of those questions at full length, that they might have the satisfaction to compare their own solutions with those of the Author, and thereby the opportunity of chusing which they like best, he has herein complied with their request.</P>
<P>These solutions are published apart from the work itself, that the teacher may avail himself of them, and yet keep them from the sight of his pupils if he so chuses, each learner having only the book of arith∣metic for the purposes therein mentioned.</P>
<P>The solutions are all delivered in what have been judged to be the best forms. Sometimes two me∣thods are given, where they seemed necessary. In such of them as contain any proportions, or rule-of-three statings, the fourth term is generally put down in the form of a vulgar fraction, placing the product of the second and third terms, as numerator, to be
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>divided by the first as a denominator; the fraction is then abbreviated as much as it can be, before the mul∣tiplication and division are performed; by which means generally these two operations are intirely saved, or at least much shortened and facilitated, by bringing them to such small numbers as can be easily multiplied and divided mentally, and the answer thence discovered without any other intermediate fi∣gures or operations to be written down. So that there is never occasion for more writing than appears in the operations as here printed, where it will be found that, to avoid the long form of division, the large divisors are separated into their component parts, and the divisions performed separately by them, which are always done by writing down only the quotients. But where the numbers are so large as to make long divisions, or multiplications, unavoidable, those ope∣rations are always placed down at the bottom of the solution, that so none of the necessary part of the writing in the full solution, might be omitted.</P>

<P>Laid out in a lot of muslin 500l. upon examination of which, 3 parts in 9 proved damaged, so that I could make but 5s. a yard of the same; and by so doing find I lost 50l. by it. At what rate <HI>per</HI> ell am I to part with the undamaged muslin in order to gain 50l. upon the whole?</P>
<P>— <HI>Ans.</HI> 11s. 7 2/7d.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="solution">
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
<HEAD>SOLUTION.</HEAD>
<P>In order to gain 50l. by the whole, he must gain 100l. by the undamaged part, because he lost 50l. by the part which was damaged.</P>
<P>Now the part damaged was ⅓, and the rest ⅔; also the whole cost 500l.; the ⅓ of which is 166⅔, and the ⅔ of it is 333⅓. Consequently the damaged part was sold for 166⅔ − 50 or 116⅔; and the sound part must be sold for 433⅓=333⅓ + 100.</P>
<P>But the damaged part sold at 5s. <HI>per</HI> yard, therefore as 5s. or ¼l. ∶ 116⅔l. ∷ 1 yd. ∶ 116⅔ × 4=466⅔ yards, the quantity which was damaged. And the double of it, or 933⅓ yards was the undamaged part, which must sell for 433⅓l. Therefore as 933⅓ ∶ 1 ∷ 433⅓ ∶ 433⅓ / 933⅓ = (by multiplying the terms both by 3) 1300/2800=13/28l. the price <HI>per</HI> yard.</P>
<P>And consequently, as <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> the price <HI>per</HI> ell required.</P>
<P>OTHERWISE.</P>
<P>Since the sound part is the double of the part damaged, and the former must gain a sum just the double of that which was lost by the latter, it is evident that <HI>it</HI> must be sold at a rate as much above the prime cost, as the other was below it.</P>
<P>Now the loss on ⅓ part was 50l. at which rate the whole 500 would have brought only 350; therefore as 350 ∶ 500, or as 7 ∶ 10 ∷ 5s. ∶ 50/7=7 1/7s. the prime cost per yard.</P>
<P>Hence 7 1/7 − 5=2 1/7=the loss <HI>per</HI> yard on the damaged part, and 7 1/7 + 2 1/7=9 2/7s. the price <HI>per</HI> yard of the sound part.</P>
