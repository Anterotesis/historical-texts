<HEAD>TO <HI>M. DE LA FAYETTE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER an acquaintance of nearly fifteen years, in difficult situations in America, and various consultations in Europe, I feel a pleasure in pre∣senting to you this small treatise, in gratitude for your services to my beloved America, and as a testimony of my esteem for the virtues, public and private, which I know you to possess.</P>
<P>The only point upon which I could ever discover that we differed, was not as to principles of go∣vernment, but as to time. For my own part, I think it equally as injurious to good principles to permit them to linger, as to push them on too fast. That which you suppose accomplishable in fourteen or fifteen years, I may believe practicable in a much shorter period. Mankind, as it appears to me, are always ripe enough to understand their true interest, provided it be presented clearly to their understanding, and that in a manner not to create suspicion by any thing like self-design, nor offend by assuming too much. Where we would wish to reform we must not reproach.</P>
<P>When the American revolution was established, I felt a disposition to sit serenely down and enjoy
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/> the calm. It did not appear to me that any ob∣ject could afterwards arise great enough to make me quit tranquillity, and feel as I had felt before. But when principle, and not place, is the energetic cause of action, a man, I find, is every where the same.</P>
<P>I am now once more in the public world; and as I have not a right to contemplate on so many years of remaining life as you have, I am re∣solved to labour as fast as I can; and as I am anxious for your aid and your company, I wish you to hasten your principles, and overtake me.</P>
<P>If you make a campaign the ensuing spring, which it is most probable there will be no occasion for, I will come and join you. Should the cam∣paign commence, I hope it will terminate in the extinction of German despotism, and in establish∣ing the freedom of all Germany. When France shall be surrounded with revolutions, she will be in peace and safety, and her taxes, as well as those of Germany, will consequently become less.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I began the chapter entitled the <HI>"Conclusion"</HI> in the former part of the RIGHTS OF MAN, published last year, it was my intention to have extended it to a greater length; but in casting the whole matter in my mind which I wished to add, I found that I must either make the work too bulky, or contract my plan too much. I therefore brought it to a close as soon as the subject would admit, and re∣served what I had further to say to another op∣portunity.</P>
<P>Several other reasons contributed to produce this determination. I wished to know the manner in which a work, written in a style of thinking and expression different to what had been custo∣mary in England, would be received before I pro∣ceeded farther. A great field was opening to the view of mankind by means of the French Revo∣lution. Mr. Burke's outrageous opposition there∣to brought the controversy into England. He at∣tacked principles which he knew (from informa∣tion) I would contest with him, because they are principles I believe to be good, and which I have contributed to establish, and conceive myself bound to defend. Had he not urged the controversy, I had most probably been a silent man.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="5"/>Another reason for deferring the remainder of the work was, that Mr. Burke promised in his first publication to renew the subject at another oppor∣tunity, and to make a comparison of what he called the English and French Constitutions. I therefore held myself in reserve for him. He has published two works since, without doing this; which he certainly would not have omitted, had the com∣parison been in his favour.</P>
<P>In his last work, <Q>His appeal from the new to the old Whigs,</Q> he has quoted about ten pages from the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and having given himself the trouble of doing this, says, <Q>he shall not at∣tempt in the smallest degree to refute them,</Q> meaning the principles therein contained. I am enough acquainted with Mr. Burke to know, that he would if he could. But instead of contesting them, he immediately after consoles himself with saying, that "he has done his part."—He has not done his part. He has not performed his promise of a comparison of constitutions. He started the controversy, he gave the challenge, and has fled from it; and he is now a <HI>case in point</HI> with his own opinion, that, <HI>"the age of chivalry is gone!"</HI></P>
<P>The title, as well as the substance of his last work, his <HI>"Appeal,"</HI> is his condemnation. Prin∣ciples must stand on their own merits, and if they are good they certainly will. To put them under the shelter of other men's authority, as Mr. Burke has done, serves to bring them into suspicion. Mr. Burke is not very fond of dividing his honours, but in this case he is artfully dividing the disgrace.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="6"/>But who are those to whom Mr. Burke has made his appeal? A set of childish thinkers and half-way politicians born in the last century; men who went no farther with any principle than as it suited their purpose as a party; the nation was al∣ways left out of the question; and this has been the character of every party from that day to this. The nation sees nothing in such works, or such politics worthy its attention. A little matter will move a party, but it must be something great that moves a nation.</P>
<P>Though I see nothing in Mr. Burke's Appeal worth taking much notice of, there is, however, one expression upon which I shall offer a few re∣marks.—After quoting largely from the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and declining to contest the principles con∣tained in that work, he says, <Q>This will most probably be done <HI>(if such writings shall be thought to deserve any other refutation than that of criminal justice)</HI> by others, who may think with Mr. Burke and with the same zeal.</Q></P>
<P>In the first place, it has not yet been done by any body. Not less, I believe, than eight or ten pam∣phlets intended as answers to the former part of the "Rights of Man" have been published by different persons, and not one of them, to my knowledge, has extended to a second edition, nor are even the titles of them so much as generally remembered. As I am averse to unnecessarily multiplying publications, I have answered none of them. And as I believe that a man may write
<PB N="x" REF="7"/> himself out of reputation when nobody else can do it, I am careful to avoid that rock.</P>
<P>But as I would decline unnecessary publications on the one hand, so would I avoid every thing that might appear like sullen pride on the other. If Mr. Burke, or any person on his side the question, will produce an answer to the "Rights of Man," that shall extend to an half, or even to a fourth part of the number of copies to which the Rights of Man extended, I will reply to his work. But until this be done, I shall so far take the sense of the public for my guide (and the world knows I am not a flat∣terer) that what they do not think worth while to read, is not worth mine to answer. I suppose the number of copies to which the first part of the <HI>Rights of Man</HI> extended, taking England, Scot∣land, and Ireland, is not less than between forty and fifty thousand.</P>
<P>I now come to remark on the remaining part of the quotation I have made from Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>"If," says he, <Q>such writings shall be thought to deserve any other refutation than that of <HI>cri∣minal</HI> justice.</Q></P>
<P>Pardoning the pun, it must be <HI>criminal</HI> justice indeed that should condemn a work as a substitute for not being able to refute it. The greatest con∣demnation that could be passed upon it would be a refutation. But in proceeding by the method Mr. Burke alludes to, the condemnation would, in the final event, pass upon the criminality of the pro∣cess and not upon the work, and in this case, I
<PB N="xi" REF="8"/> had rather be the author, than be either the judge, or the jury, that should condemn it.</P>
<P>But to come at once to the point. I have dif∣fered from some professional gentlemen on the sub∣ject of prosecutions, and I since find they are fall∣ing into my opinion, which I will here state as fully, but as concisely as I can.</P>
<P>I will first put a case with respect to any law, and then compare it with a government, or with what in England is, or has been, called a consti∣tution.</P>
<P>It would be an act of despotism, or what in England is called arbitrary power, to make a law to prohibit investigating the principles, good or bad, on which such a law, or any other is founded.</P>
<P>If a law be bad, it is one thing to oppose the practice of it, but it is quite a different thing to expose its errors, to reason on its defects, and to shew cause why it should be repealed, or why another ought to be substituted in its place. I have always held it an opinion (making it also my practice) that it is better to obey a bad law, making use at the same time of every argument to shew its er∣rors and procure its repeal, than forcibly to violate it; because the precedent of breaking a bad law might weaken the force, and lead to a discre∣tionary violation, of those which are good.</P>
<P>The case is the same with respect to principles and forms of government, or to what are called constitutions and the parts of which they are com∣posed.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="9"/>It is for the good of nations, and not for the emolument or aggrandizement of particular indi∣viduals, that government ought to be established, and that mankind are at the expence of supporting it. The defects of every government and consti∣tution, both as to principle and form must, on a parity of reasoning, be as open to discussion as the defects of a law, and it is a duty which every man owes to society to point them out. When those defects, and the means of remedying them are ge∣nerally seen by a nation, that nation will reform its government or its constitution in the one case, as the government repealed or reformed the law in the other. The operation of government is restricted to the making and the administering of laws; but it is to a nation that the right of forming or re∣forming, generating or regenerating constitutions and governments belong; and consequently those subjects, as subjects of investigation, are always before a country <HI>as a matter of right,</HI> and cannot, without invading the general rights of that country, be made subjects for prosecution. On this ground I will meet Mr. Burke whenever he please. It is better that the whole argument should come out, than to seek to stifle it. It was himself that open∣ed the controversy, and he ought not to desert it.</P>
<P>I do not believe that monarchy and aristocracy will continue seven years longer in any of the en∣lightened countries in Europe. If better reasons can be shewn for them than against them, they will stand; if the contrary, they will not. Mankind
<PB N="xiii" REF="10"/> are not now to be told they shall not think, or they shall not read; and publications that go no farther than to investigate principles of government, to in∣vite men to reason and to reflect, and to shew the errors and excellences of different systems, have a right to appear. If they do not excite attention, they are not worth the trouble of a prosecution; and if they do, the prosecution will amount to no∣thing, since it cannot amount to a prohibition of reading. This would be a sentence on the public, instead of the author, and would also be the most effectual mode of making or hastening revo∣lutions.</P>
<P>On all cases that apply universally to a nation, with respect to systems of government, a jury of <HI>twelve</HI> men is not competent to decide. Where there are no witnesses to be examined, no facts to be proved, and where the whole matter is before the whole public, and the merits or demerits of it resting on their opinion; and where there is no∣thing to be known in a court, but what every body knows out of it, every twelve men is equally as good a jury as the other, and would most probably re∣verse each other's verdict; or from the variety of their opinions, not be able to form one. It is one case, whether a nation approve a work, or a plan; but it is quite another case, whether it will commit to any such jury the power of determining whether that nation have a right to, or shall reform its govern∣ment, or not. I mention those cases, that Mr. Burke may see I have not written on Government
<PB N="xiv" REF="11"/> without reflecting on what is Law, as well as on what are Rights.—The only effectual jury in such cases would be, a convention of the whole nation fairly elected; for in all such cases the whole nation is the vicinage. If Mr. Burke will propose such a jury, I will wave all privileges of being the citizen of another country, and, defending its principles, abide the issue, provided he will do the same; for my opinion is, that his work and his principles would be condemned instead of mine.</P>
<P>As to the prejudices which men have from edu∣cation and habit, in favour of any particular form or system of government, those prejudices have yet to stand the test of reason and reflection. In fact, such prejudices are nothing. No man is preju∣diced in favour of a thing, knowing it to be wrong. He is attached to it on the belief of its being right; and when he see it is not so, the prejudice will be gone. We have but a defective idea of what pre∣judice is. It might be said, that until men think for themselves the whole is prejudice, and <HI>not opi∣nion;</HI> for that only is opinion which is the result of reason and reflection. I offer this remark, that Mr. Burke may not confide too much in what has been the customary prejudices of the country.</P>
<P>I do not believe that the people of England have ever been fairly and candidly dealt by. They have been imposed upon by parties, and by men assuming the character of leaders. It is time that the nation should rise above those trifles. It is time to dismiss that inattention which has so long
<PB N="xv" REF="12"/> been the encouraging cause of stretching tax∣ation to excess. It is time to dismiss all those songs and toasts which are calculated to enslave, and operate to suffocate reflection. On all such subjects men have but to think, and they will nei∣ther act wrong nor be misled. To say that any people are not fit for freedom, is to make poverty their choice, and to say they had rather be loaded with taxes than not. If such a case could be proved, it would equally prove, that those who govern are not fit to govern them, for they are a part of the same national mass.</P>
<P>But admitting governments to be changed all over Europe; it certainly may be done without convulsion or revenge. It is not worth making changes or revolutions, unless it be for some great national benefit; and when this shall appear to a nation, the danger will be, as in America and France, to those who oppose; and with this re∣flection I close my Preface.</P>

<HEAD>RIGHTS OF MAN. PART II.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT Archimedes said of the mechanical powers, may be applied to Reason and Liberty: <HI>"Had we,"</HI> said he, <Q>a place to stand upon, we might raise the world.</Q></P>
<P>The revolution of America presented in politics what was only theory in mechanics. So deeply rooted were all the governments of the old world, and so effectually had the tyranny and the antiquity of habit established itself over the mind, that no beginning could be made in Asia, Africa, or Europe, to reform the political condition of man. Freedom had been hunted round the globe; rea∣son was considered as rebellion; and the slavery of fear had made men afraid to think.</P>
<P>But such is the irresistible nature of truth, that all it asks, and all it wants, is the liberty of appearing. The sun needs no inscription to distinguish him from darkness; and no sooner did the American go∣vernments display themselves to the world, than
<PB N="2" REF="15"/> despotism felt a shock, and man began to con∣template redress.</P>
<P>The independence of America, considered mere∣ly as a separation from England, would have been a matter but of little importance, had it not been accompanied by a revolution in the principles and practice of governments. She made a stand, not for herself only, but for the world, and looked beyond the advantages herself could receive. Even the Hessian, though hired to fight against her, may live to bless his defeat; and England, con∣demning the viciousness of its government, rejoice in its miscarriage.</P>
<P>As America was the only spot in the political world, where the principles of universal reforma∣tion could begin, so also was it the best in the natural world. An assemblage of circumstances conspired, not only to give birth, but to add gigantic maturity to its principles. The scene which that country presents to the eye of a spec∣tator, has something in it which generates and encourages great ideas. Nature appears to him in magnitude. The mighty objects he beholds, act upon his mind by enlarging it, and he par∣takes of the greatness he contemplates.—Its first settlers were emigrants from different European nations, and of diversified professions of religion, retiring from the governmental persecutions of the old world, and meeting in the new, not as ene∣mies, but as brothers. The wants which necessarily accompany the cultivation of a wilderness produced among them a state of society, which countries, long harassed by the quarrels and intrigues of
<PB N="3" REF="16"/> governments, had neglected to cherish. In such a situation man becomes what he ought. He sees his species, not with the inhuman idea of a natural enemy, but as kindred; and the example shews to the artificial world, that man must go back to Nature for information.</P>
<P>From the rapid progress which America makes in every species of improvement, it is rational to conclude, that if the governments of Asia, Africa, and Europe, had begun on a principle similar to that of America, or had not been very early cor∣rupted therefrom, that those countries must by this time have been in a far superior condition to what they are. Age after age has passed away, for no other purpose than to behold their wretch∣edness.—Could we suppose a spectator who knew nothing of the world, and who was put into it merely to make his observations, he would take a great part of the old world to be new, just struggling with the difficulties and hardships of an infant settlement. He could not suppose that the hordes of miserable poor, with which old countries abound, could be any other than those who had not yet had time to provide for themselves. Little would he think they were the consequence of what in such countries is called government.</P>
<P>If, from the more wretched parts of the old world, we look at those which are in an advanced stage of improvement, we still find the greedy hand of government thrusting itself into every corner and crevice of industry, and grasping the spoil of the multitude. Invention is continually exercised, to furnish new pretences for revenue
<PB N="4" REF="17"/> and taxation. It watches prosperity as its prey, and permits none to escape without a tribute.</P>
<P>As revolutions have begun, (and as the proba∣bility is always greater against a thing beginning, than of proceeding after it has begun), it is natural to expect that other revolutions will follow. The amazing and still increasing expences with which old governments are conducted, the numerous wars they engage in or provoke, the embarrassments they throw in the way of universal civilization and commerce, and the oppression and usurpation they act at home, have wearied out the patience, and exhausted the property of the world. In such a situation, and with the examples already existing, revolutions are to be looked for. They are become subjects of universal conversation, and may be considered as the <HI>Order of the day.</HI></P>
<P>If systems of government can be introduced, less expensive, and more productive of general happiness, than those which have existed, all at∣tempts to oppose their progress will in the end be fruitless. Reason, like time, will make its own way, and prejudice will fall in a combat with interest. If universal peace, civilization, and commerce, are ever to be the happy lot of man, it cannot be accomplished but by a revolution in the system of governments. All the monarchical governments are military. War is their trade, plunder and revenue their objects. While such governments continue, peace has not the absolute security of a day. What is the history of all monarchical governments, but a disgustful picture of human wretchedness, and the accidental respite
<PB N="5" REF="18"/> of a few years repose? Wearied with war, and tired with human butchery, they sat down to rest and called it peace. This certainly is not the condition that Heaven intended for man; and if <HI>this be monarchy,</HI> well might monarchy be reckon∣ed among the sins of the Jews.</P>
<P>The revolutions which formerly took place in the world, had nothing in them that interested the bulk of mankind. They extended only to a change of persons and measures but not of prin∣ciples, and rose or fell among the common trans∣actions of the moment. What we now behold, may not improperly be called a <HI>"counter revolu∣tion."</HI> Conquest and tyranny, at some early period, dispossessed man of his rights, and he is now recovering them. And as the tide of all hu∣man affairs has its ebb and flow in directions con∣trary to each other, so also is it in this. Govern∣ment founded on a <HI>moral theory, on a system of universal peace, on the indefeasible hereditary Rights of Man,</HI> is now revolving from west to east, by a stronger impulse than the government of the sword revolved from east to west. It interests not particular individuals, but nations, in its progress, and promises a new aera to the human race.</P>
<P>The danger to which the success of revolutions is most exposed, is that of attempting them before the principles on which they proceed, and the advantages to result from them, are sufficiently seen and understood. Almost every thing apper∣taining to the circumstances of a nation, has been absorbed and confounded under the general and
<PB N="6" REF="19"/> mysterious word <HI>government.</HI> Though it avoids taking to its account the errors it commits, and the mischiefs it occasions, it fails not to arrogate to itself whatever has the appearance of prosperity. It robs industry of its honours, by pedanticly mak∣ing itself the cause of its effects; and purloins from the general character of man, the merits that ap∣pertain to him as a social being.</P>
<P>It may therefore be of use, in this day of revolu∣tions, to discriminate between those things which are the effect of government, and those which are not. This will best be done by taking a review of society and civilization, and the consequences re∣sulting therefrom, as things distinct from what are called governments. By beginning with this investigation, we shall be able to assign effects to their proper cause, and analize the mass of com∣mon errors.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. OF SOCIETY AND CIVILIZATION.</HEAD>
<P>GREAT part of that order which reigns among mankind is not the effect of govern∣ment. It has its origin in the principles of society and the natural constitution of man. It existed prior to government, and would exist if the for∣mality of government was abolished. The mutual dependance and reciprocal interest which man has upon man, and all the parts of a civilized com∣munity upon each other, create that great chain of connection which holds it together. The landholder, the farmer, the manufacturer, the merchant, the tradesman, and every occupation, prospers by the aid which each receives from the other, and from the whole. Common interest regulates their concerns, and forms their law; and the laws which common usage ordains, have a greater influence than the laws of government. In fine, society performs for itself almost every thing which is ascribed to government.</P>
<P>To understand the nature and quantity of government proper for man, it is necessary to attend to his character. As Nature created him
<PB N="8" REF="21"/> for social life, she fitted him for the station she intended. In all cases she made his natural wants greater than his individual powers. No one man is capable, without the aid of society, of supplying his own wants; and those wants, acting upon every individual, impel the whole of them into society, as naturally as gravitation acts to a center.</P>
<P>But she has gone further. She has not only forced man into society, by a diversity of wants, which the reciprocal aid of each other can supply, but she has implanted in him a system of social affections, which, though not necessary to his exist∣ence, are essential to his happiness. There is no period in life when this love for society ceases to act. It begins and ends with our being.</P>
<P>If we examine, with attention, into the compo∣sition and constitution of man, the diversity of his wants, and the diversity of talents in differ∣ent men for reciprocally accommodating the wants of each other, his propensity to society, and consequently to preserve the advantages resulting from it, we shall easily discover, that a great part of what is called government is mere imposition.</P>
<P>Government is no farther necessary than to supply the few cases to which society and civilization are not conveniently competent; and instances are not wanting to shew, that every thing which govern∣ment can usefully add thereto, has been per∣formed by the common consent of society, without government.</P>
<P>For upwards of two years from the commence∣ment of the American war, and to a longer period
<PB N="9" REF="22"/> in several of the American States, there were no established forms of government. The old go∣vernments had been abolished, and the country was too much occupied in defence, to employ its attention in establishing new governments; yet during this interval, order and harmony were preserved as inviolate as in any country in Europe. There is a natural aptness in man, and more so in society, because it embraces a greater variety of abilities and resource, to accommodate itself to whatever situation it is in. The instant formal government is abolished, society begins to act. A general association takes place, and common interest produces common security.</P>
<P>So far is it from being true, as has been pre∣tended, that the abolition of any formal govern∣ment is the dissolution of society, that it acts by a contrary impulse, and brings the latter the closer together. All that part of its organization which it had committed to its government, de∣volves again upon itself, and acts through its medium. When men, as well from natural in∣stinct, as from reciprocal benefits, have habituated themselves to social and civilized life, there is always enough of its principles in practice to carry them through any changes they may find necessary or convenient to make in their govern∣ment. In short, man is so naturally a creature of society, that it is almost impossible to put him out of it.</P>
<P>Formal government makes but a small part of civilized life; and when even the best that human
<PB N="10" REF="23"/> wisdom can devise is established, it is a thing more in name and idea, than in fact. It is to the great and fundamental principles of society and civilization—to the common usage universally consented to, and mutually and reciprocally main∣tained—to the unceasing circulation of interest, which, passing through its million channels, in∣vigorates the whole mass of civilized man—it is to these things, infinitely more than to any thing which even the best instituted government can perform, that the safety and prosperity of the individual and of the whole depends.</P>
<P>The more perfect civilization is, the less occasion has it for government, because the more does it regulate its own affairs, and govern itself; but so contrary is the practice of old governments to the reason of the case, that the expences of them in∣crease in the proportion they ought to diminish. It is but few general laws that civilized life re∣quires, and those of such common usefulness, that whether they are enforced by the forms of government or not, the effect will be nearly the same. If we consider what the principles are that first condense men into society, and what the motives that regulate their mutual intercourse afterwards, we shall find, by the time we arrive at what is called government, that nearly the whole of the business is performed by the natural opera∣tion of the parts upon each other.</P>
<P>Man, with respect to all those matters, is more a creature of consistency than he is aware, or that
<PB N="11" REF="24"/> governments would wish him to believe. All the great laws of society are laws of nature. Those of trade and commerce, whether with respect to the intercourse of individuals, or of nations, are laws of mutual and reciprocal interest. They are followed and obeyed, because it is the interest of the parties so to do, and not on account of any formal laws their governments may impose or interpose.</P>
<P>But how often is the natural propensity to society disturbed or destroyed by the operations of govern∣ment! When the latter, instead of being ingrafted on the principles of the former, assumes to exist for itself, and acts by partialities of favour and oppression, it becomes the cause of the mischiefs it ought to prevent.</P>
<P>If we look back to the riots and tumults, which at various times have happened in England, we shall find, that they did not proceed from the want of a government, but that government was itself the generating cause; instead of consolidating society it divided it; it deprived it of its natural cohesion, and engendered discontents and disorders, which other∣wise would not have existed. In those associations which men promiscuously form for the purpose of trade, or of any concern, in which government is totally out of the question, and in which they act merely on the principles of society, we see how naturally the various parties unite; and this shews, by comparison, that governments, so far from being always the cause or means of order, are often the
<PB N="12" REF="25"/> destruction of it. The riots of 1780 had no other source than the remains of those prejudices, which the government itself had encouraged. But with respect to England there are also other causes.</P>
<P>Excess and inequality of taxation, however dis∣guised in the means, never fail to appear in their effects. As a great mass of the community are thrown thereby into poverty and discontent, they are constantly on the brink of commotion; and, deprived, as they unfortunately are, of the means of information, are easily heated to outrage. Whatever the apparent cause of any riots may be, the real one is always want of happiness. It shews that something is wrong in the system of govern∣ment, that injures the felicity by which society is to be preserved.</P>
<P>But as fact is superior to reasoning, the instance of America presents itself to confirm these observa∣tions.—If there is a country in the world, where concord, according to common calculation, would be least expected, it is America. Made up, as it is, of people from different nations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That part of America which is generally called New-England, including New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island, and Connecticut, is peopled chiefly by English descen∣dants. In the state of New-York, about half are Dutch, the rest English, Scotch, and Irish. In New-Jersey, a mixture of English and Dutch, with some Scotch and Irish. In Pennsylvania, about one third are English, another Germans, and the remain∣der Scotch and Irish, with some Swedes. The States to the southward have a greater proportion of English than the mid∣dle States, but in all of them there is a mixture; and besides those enumerated, there are a considerable number of French, and some few of all the European nations lying on the coast. The most numerous religious denomination are the Presbyterians; but no one sect is established above another, and all men are equally citizens.</NOTE>, accustomed
<PB N="13" REF="26"/> to different forms and habits of government, speaking different languages, and more different in their modes of worship, it would appear that the union of such a people was impracticable; but by the simple operation of constructing government on the principles of society and the rights of man, every difficulty retires, and all the parts are brought into cordial unison. There, the poor are not oppressed, the rich are not privileged. Industry is not mortified by the splendid extrava∣gance of a court rioting at its expence. Their taxes are few, because their government is just; and as there is nothing to render them wretched, there is nothing to engender riots and tumults.</P>
<P>A metaphysical man, like Mr. Burke, would have tortured his invention to discover how such a people could be governed. He would have supposed that some must be managed by fraud, others by force, and all by some contrivance; that genius must be hired to impose upon igno∣rance, and shew and parade to fascinate the vulgar. Lost in the abundance of his researches, he would have resolved and re-resolved, and finally over-looked the plain and easy road that lay directly before him.</P>
<P>One of the great advantages of the American revolution has been, that it led to a discovery of
<PB N="14" REF="27"/> the principles, and laid open the imposition of go∣vernments. All the revolutions till then had been worked within the atmosphere of a court, and never on the great floor of a nation. The parties were always of the class of courtiers; and what∣ever was their rage for reformation, they carefully preserved the fraud of the profession.</P>
<P>In all cases they took care to represent govern∣ment as a thing made up of mysteries, which only themselves understood; and they hid from the understanding of the nation, the only thing that was beneficial to know, namely, <HI>That govern∣ment is nothing more than a national association acting on the principles of society.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus endeavoured to shew, that the social and civilized state of man is capable of performing within itself, almost every thing necessary to its protection and government, it will be proper, on the other hand, to take a review of the present old governments, and examine whether their principles and practice are correspondent thereto.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. OF THE ORIGIN OF THE PRESENT OLD GOVERNMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is impossible that such governments as have hitherto existed in the world, could have commenced by any other means than a total violation of every principle sacred and mo∣ral. The obscurity in which the origin of all the present old governments is buried, implies the iniquity and disgrace with which they began. The origin of the present government of Ame∣rica and France will ever be remembered, be∣cause it is honourable to record it; but with re∣spect to the rest, even Flattery has consigned them to the tomb of time, without an inscription.</P>
<P>It could have been no difficult thing in the early and solitary ages of the world, while the chief employment of men was that of attending flocks and herds, for a banditti of ruffians to over-run a country, and lay it under contributions. Their power being thus established, the chief of the band contrived to lose the name of Robber in that of Monarch; and hence the origin of Monarchy and Kings.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="29"/>The origin of the government of England, so far as relates to what is called its line of monarchy, being one of the latest, is perhaps the best recorded. The hatred which the Norman invasion and tyranny begat, must have been deeply rooted in the nation, to have outlived the con∣trivance to obliterate it. Though not a courtier will talk of the curfeu-bell, not a village in England has forgotten it.</P>
<P>Those bands of robbers having parcelled out the world, and divided it into dominions, began, as is naturally the case, to quarrel with each other. What at first was obtained by violence, was consi∣dered by others as lawful to be taken, and a second plunderer succeeded the first. They alternately invaded the dominions which each had assigned to himself, and the brutality with which they treated each other explains the original character of monar∣chy. It was ruffian torturing ruffian. The conque∣ror considered the conquered, not as his prisoner, but his property. He led him in triumph rattling in chains, and doomed him, at pleasure, to slavery or death. As time obliterated the history of their beginning, their successors assumed new appear∣ances, to cut off the entail of their disgrace, but their principles and objects remained the same. What at first was plunder, assumed the softer name of revenue; and the power originally usurp∣ed, they affected to inherit.</P>
<P>From such beginning of governments, what could be expected, but a continual system of war and extortion? It has established itself into a trade. The vice is not peculiar to one more than
<PB N="17" REF="30"/> to another, but is the common principle of all. There does not exist within such governments, a stamina whereon to ingraft reformation; and the shortest and most effectual remedy is to begin anew.</P>
<P>What scenes of horror, what perfection of ini∣quity, present themselves in contemplating the character, and reviewing the history of such go∣vernments! If we would delineate human nature with a baseness of heart, and hypocrisy of coun∣tenance, that reflection would shudder at and hu∣manity disown, it is kings, courts, and cabinets, that must sit for the portrait. Man, naturally as he is, with all his faults about him, is not up to the character.</P>
<P>Can we possibly suppose that if governments had originated in a right principle, and had not an interest in pursuing a wrong one, that the world could have been in the wretched and quar∣relsome condition we have seen it? What induce∣ment has the farmer, while following the plough, to lay aside his peaceful pursuits, and go to war with the farmer of another country? or what inducement has the manufacturer? What is dominion to them, or to any class of men in a nation? Does it add an acre to any man's estate, or raise its value? Are not conquest and defeat each of the same price, and taxes the never-failing consequence?—Though this reasoning may be good to a nation, it is not so to a government. War is the Pharo table of governments, and na∣tions the dupes of the game.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="31"/>If there is any thing to wonder at in this mi∣serable scene of governments, more than might be expected, it is the progress which the peaceful arts of agriculture, manufacture and commerce have made, beneath such a long accumulating load of discouragement and oppression. It serves to shew, that instinct in animals does not act with stronger impulse, than the principles of society and civilization operate in man. Under all discou∣ragements, he pursues his object, and yields to nothing but impossibilities.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. OF THE OLD AND NEW SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING can appear more contradictory than the principles on which the old governments began, and the condition to which society, civilization, and commerce, are capable of carrying mankind. Government on the old system, is an assumption of power, for the aggrandise∣ment of itself; on the new, a delegation of power, for the common benefit of society. The former supports itself by keeping up a system of war; the latter promotes a system of peace, as the true means of enriching a nation. The one en∣courages national prejudices; the other promotes universal society, as the means of universal com∣merce. The one measures its prosperity, by the quantity of revenue it extorts; the other proves its excellence, by the small quantity of taxes it requires.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke has talked of old and new whigs. If he can amuse himself with childish names and distinctions, I shall not interrupt his pleasure. It is not to him, but to the Abbé Sieyes, that I address this chapter. I am already engaged to
<PB N="20" REF="33"/> the latter gentleman, to discuss the subject of monarchical government; and as it naturally occurs in comparing the old and new systems, I make this the opportunity of presenting to him my observations. I shall occasionally take Mr. Burke in my way.</P>
<P>Though it might be proved that the system of government now called the NEW, is the most ancient in principle of all that have existed, being founded on the original inherent Rights of Man: yet, as tyranny and the sword have suspended the exercise of those rights for many centuries past, it serves better the purpose of distinction to call it the <HI>new,</HI> than to claim the right of calling it the old.</P>
<P>The first general distinction between those two systems, is, that the one now called the old is <HI>hereditary,</HI> either in whole or in part; and the new is entirely <HI>representative.</HI> It rejects all here∣ditary government:</P>
<P>First, As being an imposition on mankind.</P>
<P>Secondly, As inadequate to the purposes for which government is necessary.</P>
<P>With respect to the first of these heads—It can∣not be proved by what right hereditary govern∣ment could begin: neither does there exist within the compass of mortal power, a right to establish it. Man has no authority over posterity in matters of personal right; and therefore, no man, or body of men, had, or can have, a right to set up hereditary government. Were even our∣selves to come again into existence, instead of being succeeded by posterity, we have not now the right of taking from ourselves the rights
<PB N="21" REF="34"/> which would then be ours. On what ground, then, do we pretend to take them from others?</P>
<P>All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny. An heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what other fanciful name such things may be called, have no other significant expla∣nation than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a government, is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</P>
<P>With respect to the second head, that of being inadequate to the purposes for which government is necessary, we have only to consider what govern∣ment essentially is, and compare it with the cir∣cumstances to which hereditary succession is subject.</P>
<P>Government ought to be a thing always in full maturity. It ought to be so constructed as to be superior to all the accidents to which individual man is subject; and therefore, hereditary suc∣cession, by being <HI>subject to them all,</HI> is the most irregular and imperfect of all the systems of government.</P>
<P>We have heard the <HI>Rights of Man</HI> called a <HI>levelling</HI> system; but the only system to which the word <HI>levelling</HI> is truly applicable, is the hereditary monarchical system. It is a system of <HI>mental levelling.</HI> It indiscriminately admits every species of character to the same authority. Vice and virtue, ignorance and wisdom, in short, every quality, good or bad, is put on the same level. Kings succeed each other, not as rationals, but as animals. It signifies not what their mental or moral characters are. Can we then be surprised
<PB N="22" REF="35"/> at the abject state of the human mind in monar∣chical countries, when the government itself is formed on such an abject levelling system?—It has no fixed character. To day it is one thing; to-morrow it is something else. It changes with the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mper of every succeeding individual, and is subject to all the varieties of each. It is govern∣ment through the medium of passions and acci∣dents. It appears under all the various charac∣ters of childhood, decrepitude, dotage, a thing at nurse, in leading-strings, or in crutches. It reverses the wholesome order of nature. It occa∣sionally puts children over men, and the conceits of non-age over wisdom and experience. In short, we cannot conceive a more ridiculous figure of government, than hereditary succession, in all its cases, presents.</P>
<P>Could it be made a decree in nature, or an edict registered in heaven, and man could know it, that virtue and wisdom should invariably ap∣pertain to hereditary succession, the objections to it would be removed; but when we see that nature acts as if she disowned and sported with the here∣ditary system; that the mental characters of successors, in all countries, are below the average of human understanding; that one is a tyrant, another an ideot, a third insane, and some all three together, it is impossible to attach confi∣dence to it, when reason in man has power to act.</P>
<P>It is not to the Abbé Sieyes that I need apply this reasoning; he has already saved me that trouble, by giving his own opinion upon the case. <Q>If it
<PB N="23" REF="36"/> be asked,</Q> says he, <Q>what is my opinion with respect to hereditary right, I answer, without hesitation, That, in good theory, an hereditary transmission of any power or office, can never accord with the laws of a true representation. Hereditaryship is, in this sense, as much an attaint upon principle, as an outrage upon so∣ciety. But let us,</Q> continues he, <Q>refer to the history of all elective monarchies and principali∣ties: Is there one in which the elective mode is not worse than the hereditary succession?</Q></P>
<P>As to debating on which is the worst of the two, is admitting both to be bad; and herein we are agreed. The preference which the Abbé has given, is a condemnation of the thing that he prefers. Such a mode of reasoning on such a subject is inadmissible, because it finally amounts to an accusation upon Providence, as if she had left to man no other choice with respect to government than between two evils, the best of which he admits to be <HI>"an attaint upon principle, and an outrage upon society."</HI></P>
<P>Passing over, for the present, all the evils and mischiefs which monarchy has occasioned in the world, nothing can more effectually prove its use∣lessness in a state of <HI>civil government,</HI> than making it hereditary. Would we make any office here∣ditary that required wisdom and abilities to fill it? and where wisdom and abilities are not neces∣sary, such an office, whatever it may be, is superfluous or insignificant.</P>
<P>Hereditary succession is a burlesque upon monarchy. It puts it in the most ridiculous
<PB N="24" REF="37"/> light, by presenting it as an office which any child or ideot may fill. It requires some talents to be a common mechanic; but, to be a king, requires only the an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al figure of man—a sort of breathing automaton. This sort of superstition may last a few years more, but it cannot long resist the awakened reason and interest of man.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Burke, he is a stickler for monarchy, not altogether as a pensioner, if he is one, which I believe, but as a political man. He has taken up a contemptible opinion of mankind, who, in their turn, are taking up the same of him. He considers them as a herd of beings that must be governed by fraud, effigy and shew; and an idol would be as good a figure of monarchy with him, as a man. I will, however, do him the justice to say, that, with respect to America, he has been very complimentary. He always con∣tended, at least in my hearing, that the people of America were more enlightened than those of England, or of any country in Europe; and that therefore the imposition of shew was not neces∣sary in their governments.</P>
<P>Though the comparison between hereditary and elective monarchy, which the Abbé has made, is unnecessary to the case, because the representative system rejects both; yet, were I to make the com∣parison, I should decide contrary to what he has done.</P>
<P>The civil wars which have originated from con∣tested hereditary claims, are more numerous, and have been more dreadful, and of longer continu∣ance, than those which have been occasioned by
<PB N="25" REF="38"/> election. All the civil wars in France arose from the hereditary system; they were either produced by hereditary claims, or by the imperfection of the hereditary form, which admits of regencies, or monarchy at nurse. With respect to England, its history is full of the same misfortunes. The contests for succession between the Houses of York and Lancaster, lasted a whole century; and others of a similar nature, have renewed themselves since that period. Those of 1715 and 1745, were of the same kind. The succession war for the crown of Spain, embroiled almost half Europe. The disturbances in Holland are generated from the hereditaryship of the Stadtholder. A government calling itself free, with an hereditary office, is like a thorn in the flesh, that produces a fermentation which endeavours to discharge it.</P>
<P>But I might go further, and place also foreign wars, of whatever kind, to the same cause. It is by adding the evil of hereditary succession to that of monarchy, that a permanent family-interest is created, whose constant objects are dominion and revenue. Poland, though an elective monarchy, has had fewer wars than those which are hereditary; and it is the only government that has made a voluntary essay, though but a small one, to reform the condition of the country.</P>
<P>Having thus glanced at a few of the defects of the old, or hereditary systems of government, let us compare it with the new, or representative system.</P>
<P>The representative system takes society and civilization for its basis; nature, reason, and experience, for its guide.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="39"/>Experience, in all ages, and in all countries, has demonstrated, that it is impossible to controul Nature in her distribution of mental powers. She gives them as she pleases. Whatever is the rule by which she, apparently to us, scatters them among mankind, that rule remains a secret to man. It would be as ridiculous to attempt to fix the hereditaryship of human beauty, as of wisdom. Whatever wisdom constituently is, it is like a seedless plant; it may be reared when it appears, but it cannot be voluntarily produced. There is always a sufficiency somewhere in the general mass of society for all purposes; but with respect to the parts of society, it is continually changing its place. It rises in one to day, in another to∣morrow, and has most probably visited in rotation every family of the earth, and again withdrawn.</P>
<P>As this is the order of nature, the order of government must necessarily follow it, or govern∣ment will, as we see it does, degenerate into igno∣rance. The hereditary system, therefore, is as repugnant to human wisdom, as to human rights; and is as absurd, as it is unjust.</P>
<P>As the republic of letters brings forward the best literary productions, by giving to genius a fair and universal chance; so the representative system of government is calculated to produce the wisest laws, by collecting wisdom from where it can be found. I smile to myself when I contemplate the ridiculous insignificance into which literature and all the sciences would sink, were they made here∣ditary; and I carry the same idea into governments. An hereditary governor is as inconsistent as an
<PB N="27" REF="40"/> hereditary author. I know not whether Homer or Euclid had sons: but I will venture an opinion, that if they had, and had left their works un∣finished, those sons could not have completed them.</P>
<P>Do we need a stronger evidence of the absur∣dity of hereditary government, than is seen in the descendants of those men, in any line of life, who once were famous? Is there scarcely an instance in which there is not a total reverse of the charac∣ter? It appears as if the tide of mental faculties flowed as far as it could in certain channels, and then forsook its course, and arose in others. How irrational then is the hereditary system which establishes channels of power, in company with which wisdom refuses to flow! By continuing this absurdity, man is perpetually in contradiction with himself; he accepts, for a king, or a chief magistrate, or a legislator, a person whom he would not elect for a constable.</P>
<P>It appears to general observation, that revolu∣tions create genius and talents; but those events do no more than bring them forward. There is existing in man, a mass of sense lying in a dor∣mant state, and which, unless something excites it to action, will descend with him, in that con∣dition, to the grave. As it is to the advantage of society that the whole of its faculties should be employed, the construction of government ought to be such as to bring forward, by a quiet and re∣gular operation, all that extent of capacity which never fails to appear in revolutions.</P>
<P>This cannot take place in the insipid state of
<PB N="28" REF="41"/> hereditary government, not only because it pre∣vents, but because it operates to benumb. When the mind of a nation is bowed down by any poli∣tical superstition in its government, such as here∣ditary succession is, it loses a considerable portion of its powers on all other subjects and objects. Hereditary succession requires the same obedi∣ence to ignorance, as to wisdom; and when once the mind can bring itself to pay this indiscrimi∣nate reverence, it descends below the stature of mental manhood. It is fit to be great only in little things. It acts a treachery upon itself, and suffocates the sensations that urge to de∣tection.</P>
<P>Though the ancient governments present to us a miserable picture of the condition of man, there is one which above all others exempts itself from the general description. I mean the democracy of the Athenians. We see more to admire, and less to condemn, in that great, extraordinary peo∣ple, than in any thing which history affords.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke is so little acquainted with consti∣tuent principles of government, that he confounds democracy and representation together. Repre∣sentation was a thing unknown in the ancient de∣mocracies. In those the mass of the people met and enacted laws (grammatically speaking) in the first person. Simple democracy was no other than the common-hall of the ancients. It signi∣fies the <HI>form,</HI> as well as the public principle of the government. As these democracies increased in population, and the territory extended, the simple
<PB N="29" REF="42"/> democratical form became unwieldy and imprac∣ticable; and as the system of representation was not known, the consequence was, they either degenerated convulsively into monarchies, or be∣came absorbed into such as then existed. Had the system of representation been then under∣stood, as it now is, there is no reason to believe that those forms of government, now called mo∣narchical or aristocratical, would ever have taken place. It was the want of some method to consolidate the parts of society, after it became too populous, and too extensive for the simple democratical form, and also the lax and so∣litary condition of shepherds and herdsmen in other parts of the world, that afforded opportu∣nities to those unnatural modes of government to begin.</P>
<P>As it is necessary to clear away the rubbish of errors, into which the subject of government has been thrown, I shall proceed to remark on some others.</P>
<P>It has always been the political craft of cour∣tiers and court-governments, to abuse something which they called republicanism; but what repub∣licanism was, or is, they never attempt to explain. Let us examine a little into this case.</P>
<P>The only forms of government are, the demo∣cratical, the aristocratical, the monarchical, and what is now called the representative.</P>
<P>What is called a <HI>republic,</HI> is not any <HI>particular form</HI> of government. It is wholly characteristical of the purport, matter, or object for which go∣vernment ought to be instituted, and on which
<PB N="30" REF="43"/> it is to be employed, RES-PUBLICA, the public affairs, or the public good; or, literally translated, the <HI>public thing.</HI> It is a word of a good original, referring to what ought to be the character and business of government; and in this sense it is na∣turally opposed to the word <HI>monarchy,</HI> which has a base original signification. It means arbitrary power in an individual person; in the exercise of which, <HI>himself,</HI> and not the <HI>res-publica,</HI> is the object.</P>
<P>Every government that does not act on the principle of a <HI>Republic,</HI> or in other words, that does not make the <HI>res-publica</HI> its whole and sole object, is not a good government. Republican government is no other than government esta∣blished and conducted for the interest of the pu∣blic, as well individually as collectively. It is not necessarily connected with any particular form, but it most naturally associates with the represen∣tative form, as being best calculated to secure the end for which a nation is at the expence of sup∣porting it.</P>
<P>Various forms of government have affected to style themselves a republic. Poland calls itself a republic, which is an hereditary aristocracy, with what is called an elective monarchy. Holland calls itself a republic, which is chiefly aristocra∣tical, with an hereditary stadtholdership. But the government of America, which is wholly on the system of representation, is the only real republic in character and in practice, that now exists. Its government has no other object than the public business of the nation, and therefore it is properly
<PB N="31" REF="44"/> a republic; and the Americans have taken care that THIS, and no other, shall always be the object of their government, by their rejecting every thing hereditary, and establishing government on the system of representation only.</P>
<P>Those who have said that a republic is not a <HI>form</HI> of government calculated for countries of great extent, mistook, in the first place, the <HI>busi∣ness</HI> of a government, for a <HI>form</HI> of government; for the <HI>res-publica</HI> equally appertains to every ex∣tent of territory and population. And, in the second place, if they meant any thing with respect to <HI>form,</HI> it was the simple democratical form, such as was the mode of government in the ancient de∣mocracies, in which there was no representation. The case, therefore, is not, that a republic cannot be extensive, but that it cannot be extensive on the simple democratical form; and the question naturally presents itself, <HI>What is the best form of government for conducting the</HI> RES-PUBLICA, <HI>or the</HI> PUBLIC BUSINESS <HI>of a nation, after it becomes too extensive and populous for the simple democratical form?</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be monarchy, because monarchy is subject to an objection of the same amount to which the simple democratical form was subject.</P>
<P>It is possible that an individual may lay down a system of principles, on which government shall be constitutionally established to any extent of territory. This is no more than an operation of the mind, acting by its own powers. But the practice upon those principles, as applying to the
<PB N="32" REF="45"/> various and numerous circumstances of a nation, its agriculture, manufacture, trade, commerce, &amp;c. &amp;c. requires a knowledge of a different kind, and which can be had only from the various parts of society. It is an assemblage of practical knowledge, which no one individual can possess; and therefore the monarchical form is as much limited, in useful practice, from the incompetency of knowledge, as was the democratical form, from the multiplicity of population. The one degenerates, by extension, into confusion; the other, into ignorance and in∣capacity, of which all the great monarchies are an evidence. The monarchical form, therefore, could not be a substitute for the democratical, be∣cause it has equal inconveniences.</P>
<P>Much less could it when made hereditary. This is the most effectual of all forms to preclude knowledge. Neither could the high democrati∣cal mind have voluntarily yielded itself to be go∣verned by children and idiots, and all the motley insignificance of character, which attends such a mere animal-system, the disgrace and the reproach of reason and of man.</P>
<P>As to the aristocratical form, it has the same vices and defects with the monarchical, except that the chance of abilities is better from the proportion of numbers, but there is still no secu∣rity for the right use and application of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a character of aristocracy, the reader is referred to <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> Part I. page 70.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Referring, then, to the original simple democracy,
<PB N="33" REF="46"/> it affords the true data from which government on a large scale can begin. It is incapable of ex∣tension, not from its principle, but from the in∣convenience of its form; and monarchy and aris∣tocracy, from their incapacity. Retaining, then, democracy as the ground, and rejecting the cor∣rupt systems of monarchy and aristocracy, the re∣presentative system naturally presents itself; re∣medying at once the defects of the simple demo∣cracy as to form, and the incapacity of the other two with respect to knowledge.</P>
<P>Simple democracy was society governing itself without the aid of secondary means. By ingraft∣ing representation upon democracy, we arrive at a system of government capable of embracing and confederating all the various interests and every extent of territory and population; and that also with advantages as much superior to hereditary government, as the republic of letters is to here∣ditary literature.</P>
<P>It is on this system that the American govern∣ment is founded. It is representation ingrafted upon democracy. It has fixed the form by a scale parallel in all cases to the extent of the principle. What Athens was in miniature, America will be in magnitude. The one was the wonder of the an∣cient world; the other is becoming the admiration and model of the present. It is the easiest of all the forms of government to be understood, and the most eligible in practice; and excludes at once the igno∣rance and insecurity of the hereditary mode, and the inconvenience of the simple democracy.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="47"/>It is impossible to conceive a system of govern∣ment capable of acting over such an extent of territory, and such a circle of interests, as is im∣mediately produced by the operation of represen∣tation. France, great and populous as it is, is but a spot in the capaciousness of the system. It adapts itself to all possible cases. It is preferable to simple democracy even in small territories. Athens, by representation, would have outrivalled her own democracy.</P>
<P>That which is called government, or rather that which we ought to conceive government to be, is no more than some common center, in which all the parts of society unite. This cannot be accomplished by any method so conducive to the various interests of the community, as by the repre∣sentative system. It concentrates the knowledge necessary to the interest of the parts, and of the whole. It places government in a state of constant maturity. It is, as has been already observed, never young, never old. It is subject neither to non age, nor dotage. It is never in the cradle, nor on crutches. It admits not of a separa∣tion between knowledge and power, and is supe∣rior, as government always ought to be, to all the accidents of individual man, and is therefore superior to what is called monarchy.</P>
<P>A nation is not a body, the figure of which is to be represented by the human body; but is like a body contained within a circle, having a com∣mon center, in which every radius meets; and that center is formed by representation. To connect
<PB N="35" REF="48"/> representation with what is called monarchy, is eccentric government. Representation is of itself the delegated monarchy of a nation, and cannot debase itself by dividing it with another.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke has two or three times, in his parlia∣mentary speeches, and in his publications, made use of a jingle of words that convey no ideas. Speaking of government, he says, <Q>It is better to have monarchy for its basis, and republican∣ism for its corrective, than republicanism for its basis, and monarchy for its corrective.</Q>—If he means that it is better to correct folly with wisdom, than wisdom with folly, I will no otherwise con∣tend with him, than that it would be much better to reject the folly entirely.</P>
<P>But what is this thing which Mr. Burke calls monarchy? Will he explain it? All men can under∣stand what representation is; and that it must neces∣arily include a variety of knowledge and talents. But, what security is there for the same qualities on the part of monarchy? or, when this monarchy is a child, where then is the wisdom? What does it know about government? Who then is the monarch, or where is the monarchy? If it is to be performed by regency, it proves it to be a farce. A regency is a mock species of republic, and the whole of monarchy deserves no better description. It is a thing as various as imagination can paint. It has none of the stable character that govern∣ment ought to possess. Every succession is a revolution, and every regency a counter-revolu∣tion. The whole of it is a scene of perpetual court
<PB N="36" REF="49"/> cabal and intrigue, of which Mr. Burke is himself an instance. To render monarchy consistent with government, the next in succession should not be born a child, but a man at once, and that man a Solomon. It is ridiculous that nations are to wait, and government be interrupted, till boys grow to be men.</P>
<P>Whether I have too little sense to see, or too much to be imposed upon; whether I have too much or too little pride, or of any thing else, I leave out of the question; but certain it is, that what is called monarchy, always appears to me a silly, contemptible thing. I compare it to some∣thing kept behind a curtain, about which there is a great deal of bustle and fuss, and a wonderful air of seeming solemnity; but when, by any acci∣dent, the curtain happens to be open, and the company see what it is, they burst into laughter.</P>
<P>In the representative system of government, nothing of this can happen. Like the nation itself, it possesses a perpetual stamina, as well of body as of mind, and presents itself on the open theatre of the world in a fair and manly manner. Whatever are its excellences or its defects, they are visible to all. It exists not by fraud and mystery; it deals not in cant and sophistry; but inspires a language, that, passing from heart to heart, is felt and understood.</P>
<P>We must shut our eyes against reason, we must basely degrade our understanding, not to see the folly of what is called monarchy. Nature is orderly in all her works; but this is a mode of
<PB N="37" REF="50"/> government that counteracts nature. It turns the the progress of the human faculties upside down. It subjects age to be governed by children, and wisdom by folly.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the representative system is always parallel with the order and immutable laws of nature, and meets the reason of man in every part. For example:</P>
<P>In the American federal government, more power is delegated to the President of the United States, than to any other individual member of congress. He cannot, therefore, be elected to this office under the age of thirty-five years. By this time the judgment of man becomes matured, and he has lived long enough to be acquainted with men and things, and the country with him.—But on the monarchical plan, (exclusive of the numer∣ous chances there are against every man born into the world, of drawing a prize in the lottery of hu∣man faculties), the next in succession, whatever he may be, is put at the head of a nation, and of a government, at the age of eighteen years. Does this appear like an act of wisdom? Is it consistent with the proper dignity and the manly character of a nation? Where is the propriety of calling such a lad the father of the people?—In all other cases, a person is a minor until the age of twenty-one years. Before this period, he is not trusted with the management of an acre of land, or with the heritable property of a flock of sheep, or an herd of swine; but, wonderful to tell! he may, at the age of eighteen years, be trusted with a nation.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="51"/>That monarchy is all a bubble, a mere court artifice to procure money, is evident, (at least to me), in every character in which it can be viewed. It would be impossible, on the rational system of representative government, to make out a bill of expences to such an enormous amount as this deception admits. Government is not of itself a very chargeable institution. The whole expence of the federal government of America, founded, as I have already said, on the system of representa∣tion, and extending over a country nearly ten times as large as England, is but six hundred thousand dollars, or one hundred and thirty-five thousand pounds sterling.</P>
<P>I presume, that no man in his sober senses, will compare the character of any of the kings of Europe with that of General Washington. Yet, in France, and also in England, the expence of the civil list only, for the support of one man, is eight times greater than the whole expence of the federal government in America. To assign a reason for this, appears almost impossible. The generality of people in America, especially the poor, are more able to pay taxes, than the generality of people either in France or England.</P>
<P>But the case is, that the representative system diffuses such a body of knowledge throughout a nation, on the subject of government, as to ex∣plode ignorance and preclude imposition. The craft of courts cannot be acted on that ground. There is no place for mystery; no where for it to begin. Those who are not in the representation, know as much of the nature of business as those
<PB N="39" REF="52"/> who are. An affectation of mysterious impor∣tance would there be scouted. Nations can have no secrets; and the secrets of courts, like those of individuals, are always their defects.</P>
<P>In the representative system, the reason for every thing must publicly appear. Every man is a proprietor in government, and considers it a necessary part of his business to understand. It concerns his interest, because it affects his property. He examines the cost, and com∣pares it with the advantages; and above all, he does not adopt the slavish custom of following what in other governments are called LEADERS.</P>
<P>It can only be by blinding the understanding of man, and making him believe that government is some wonderful mysterious thing, that excessive revenues are obtained. Monarchy is well calcu∣lated to ensure this end. It is the popery of government; a thing kept up to amuse the igno∣rant, and quiet them into taxes.</P>
<P>The government of a free country, properly speaking, is not in the persons, but in the laws. The enacting of those requires no great expence; and when they are administered, the whole of civil government is performed—the rest is all court contrivance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. OF CONSTITUTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THAT men mean distinct and separate things when they speak of constitutions and of governments, is evident; or, why are those terms distinctly and separately used? A constitution is not the act of a government, but of a people con∣stituting a government; and government without a constitution, is power without a right.</P>
<P>All power exercised over a nation, must have some beginning. It must be either delegated, or assumed. There are no other sources. All dele∣gated power is trust, and all assumed power is usurpation. Time does not alter the nature and quality of either.</P>
<P>In viewing this subject, the case and circum∣stances of America present themselves as in the beginning of a world; and our enquiry into the origin of government is shortened, by referring to the facts that have arisen in our own day. We have no occasion to roam for information into the ob∣scure field of antiquity, nor hazard ourselves upon conjecture. We are brought at once to the point of seeing government begin, as if we had lived in the beginning of time. The real volume, not of
<PB N="41" REF="54"/> history, but of facts, is directly before us, unmu∣tilated by contrivance, or the errors of tradition.</P>
<P>I will here concisely state the commencement of the American constitutions; by which the difference between constitutions and governments will sufficiently appear.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to remind the reader, that the United States of America consist of thir∣teen separate states, each of which established a government for itself, after the declaration of independence, done the fourth of July 1776. Each state acted independently of the rest, in forming its government; but the same general principle per∣vades the whole. When the several state govern∣ments were formed, they proceeded to form the federal government, that acts over the whole in all matters which concern the interest of the whole, or which relate to the intercourse of the several states with each other, or with foreign nations. I will begin with giving an instance from one of the state governments, (that of Pennsylvania), and then proceed to the federal government.</P>
<P>The state of Pennsylvania, though nearly of the same extent of territory as England, was then divided into only twelve counties. Each of those counties had elected a committee at the com∣mencement of the dispute with the English government; and as the city of Philadelphia, which also had its committee, was the most central for intelligence, it became the center of communication to the several county committees.
<PB N="42" REF="55"/> When it became necessary to proceed to the formation of a government, the committee of Philadelphia proposed a conference of all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> county committees, to be held in that city, and which met the latter end of July 1776.</P>
<P>Though these committees had been elected by the people, they were not elected expressly for the purpose, nor invested with the authority, of form∣ing a constitution; and as they could not, con∣sistently with the American idea of rights, assume such a power, they could only confer upon the matter, and put it into a train of operation. The conferrees, therefore, did no more than state the case, and recommend to the several counties to elect six representatives for each county, to meet in convention at Philadelphia, with powers to form a constitution, and propose it for public consideration.</P>
<P>This convention, of which Benjamin Franklin was president, having met and deliberated, and agreed upon a constitution, they next ordered it to be published, not as a thing established, but for the consideration of the whole people, their approbation or rejection, and then adjourned to a stated time. When the time of adjournment was expired, the convention re-assembled; and as the general opinion of the people in approba∣tion of it was then known, the constitution was signed, sealed, and proclaimed on the <HI>authority of the people</HI> and the original instrument deposited as a public record. The convention then appointed a day for the general election of the representatives who were to compose the
<PB N="43" REF="56"/> government, and the time it should commence; and having done this, they dissolved, and returned to their several homes and occupations.</P>
<P>In this constitution were laid down, first, a declaration of rights. Then followed the form which the government should have, and the powers it should possess—the authority of the courts of judicature, and of juries—the manner in which elections should be conducted, and the proportion of representatives to the number of electors—the time which each succeeding assem∣bly should continue, which was one year—the mode of levying, and of accounting for the expen∣diture, of public money—of appointing public officers, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>No article of this constitution could be altered or infringed at the discretion of the government that was to ensue. It was to that government a law. But as it would have been unwise to pre∣clude the benefit of experience, and in order also to prevent the accumulation of errors, if any should be found, and to preserve an unison of government with the circumstances of the state at all times, the constitution provided, that, at the expiration of every seven years, a convention should be elected, for the express purpose of revising the constitution, and making alterations, additions, or abolitions therein, if any such should be found necessary.</P>
<P>Here we see a regular process—a govern∣ment issuing out of a constitution, formed by the people in their original character; and that con∣stitution serving, not only as an authority, but as
<PB N="44" REF="57"/> a law of controul to the government. It was the political bible of the state. Scarcely a family was without it. Every member of the govern∣ment had a copy; and nothing was more com∣mon, when any debate arose on the principle of a bill, or on the extent of any species of authority, than for the members to take the printed consti∣tution out of their pocket, and read the chapter with which such matter in debate was connected.</P>
<P>Having thus given an instance from one of the states, I will shew the proceedings by which the federal constitution of the United States arose and was formed.</P>
<P>Congress, at its two first meetings, in September 1774, and May 1775, was nothing more than a deputation from the legislatures of the several provinces, afterwards states; and had no other authority than what arose from common consent, and the necessity of its acting as a public body. In every thing which related to the internal affairs of America, congress went no further than to issue recommendations to the several provincial assemblies, who at discretion adopted them or not. Nothing on the part of congress was compulsive; yet, in this situation, it was more faithfully and affectionately obeyed, than was any government in Europe. This instance, like that of the national assembly in France, sufficiently shews, that the strength of government does not con∣sist in any thing <HI>within</HI> itself, but in the attach∣ment of a nation, and the interest which the people feel in supporting it. When this
<PB N="45" REF="58"/> is lost, government is but a child in power; and though, like the old government of France, it may harrass individuals for a while, it but facilitates its own fall.</P>
<P>After the declaration of independence, it be∣came consistent with the principle on which representative government is founded, that the authority of congress should be defined and established. Whether that authority should be more or less than congress then discretionarily exercised, was not the question. It was merely the rectitude of the measure.</P>
<P>For this purpose, the act, called the act of con∣federation, (which was a sort of imperfect federal constitution), was proposed, and, after long delibe∣ration, was concluded in the year 1781. It was not the act of congress, because it is repugnant to the principles of representative government that a body should give power to itself. Congress first informed the several states, of the powers which it conceived were necessary to be invested in the union, to enable it to perform the duties and services required from it; and the states severally agreed with each other, and concenterated in congress those powers.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to observe, that in both those instances, (the one of Pennsylvania, and the other of the United States), there is no such thing as the idea of a compact between the people on one side, and the government on the other. The compact was that of the people with each other, to produce and constitute a
<PB N="46" REF="59"/> government. To suppose that any government can be a party in a compact with the whole people, is to suppose it to have existence before it can have a right to exist. The only instance in which a compact can take place between the people and those who exercise the government, is, that the people shall pay them, while they chuse to employ them.</P>
<P>Government is not a trade which any man or body of men has a right to set up and exercise for his own emolument, but is altogether a trust, in right of those by whom that trust is delegated, and by whom it is always resumeable. It has of itself no rights; they are altogether duties.</P>
<P>Having thus given two instances of the original formation of a constitution, I will shew the man∣ner in which both have been changed since their first establishment.</P>
<P>The powers vested in the governments of the several states, by the state constitutions, were found, upon experience, to be too great; and those vested in the federal government, by the act of confederation, too little. The defect was not in the principle, but in the distribution of power.</P>
<P>Numerous publications, in pamphlets and in the newspapers, appeared, on the propriety and necessity of new modelling the federal govern∣ment. After some time of public discussion, carried on through the channel of the press, and in conversations, the state of Virginia, experiencing some inconvenience with respect to commerce, pro¦posed holding a continental conference; in conse∣quence
<PB N="47" REF="60"/> of which, a deputation from five or six of the state assemblies met at Anapolis in Maryland, in 1786. This meeting, not conceiving itself suf∣ficiently authorised to go into the business of a reform, did no more than state their general opinions of the propriety of the measure, and recommend that a convention of all the states should be held the year following.</P>
<P>This convention met at Philadelphia in May 1787, of which General Washington was elected president. He was not at that time connected with any of the state governments, or with congress. He delivered up his commission when the war ended, and since then had lived a private citizen.</P>
<P>The convention went deeply into all the sub∣jects; and having, after a variety of debate and investigation, agreed among themselves upon the several parts of a federal constitution, the next question was, the manner of giving it authority and practice.</P>
<P>For this purpose, they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, send for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a Ger∣man Elector; but they referred the whole matter to the sense and interest of the country.</P>
<P>They first directed, that the proposed consti∣tution should be published. Secondly, that each state should elect a convention, expressly for the purpose of taking it into consideration, and of ratifying or rejecting it; and that as soon as the approbation and ratification of any nine states should be given, that those states should proceed to the election of their proportion of members to
<PB N="48" REF="61"/> the new federal government; and that the opera∣tion of it should then begin, and the former federal government cease.</P>
<P>The several states proceeded accordingly to elect their conventions. Some of those conven∣tions ratified the constitution by very large ma∣jorities, and two or three unanimously. In others there were much debate and division of opinion. In the Massachusetts convention, which met at Boston, the majority was not above nineteen or twenty, in about three hundred members; but such is the nature of representative government, that it quietly decides all matters by majority. After the debate in the Massachusetts convention was closed, and the vote taken, the objecting mem∣bers rose, and declared, <Q>That though they had argued and voted against it, because certain parts appeared to them in a different light to what they appeared to other members; yet, as the vote had decided in favour of the constitution as proposed, they should give it the same practical support as if they had voted for it.</Q></P>
<P>As soon as nine states had concurred, (and the rest followed in the order their conventions were elected), the old fabric of the federal government was taken down, and the new one erected, of which General Washington is president.—In this place I cannot help remarking, that the character and services of this gentleman are sufficient to put all those men called kings to shame. While they are receiving from the sweat and labours of man∣kind, a prodigality of pay, to which neither their
<PB N="49" REF="62"/> abilities nor their services can entitle them, he is rendering every service in his power, and refusing every pecuniary reward. He accepted no pay as commander in chief; he accepts none as president of the United States.</P>
<P>After the new federal constitution was esta∣blished, the state of Pennsylvania, conceiving that some parts of its own constitution required to be altered, elected a convention for that purpose. The proposed alterations were published, and the people concurring therein, they were established.</P>
<P>In forming those constitutions, or in altering them, little or no inconvenience took place. The ordinary course of things was not interrupted, and the advantages have been much. It is always the interest of a far greater number of people in a nation to have things right, than to let them remain wrong; and when public matters are open to debate, and the public judgment free, it will not decide wrong, unless it decides too hastily.</P>
<P>In the two instances of changing the constitu∣tions, the governments then in being were not actors either way. Government has no right to make itself a party in any debate respecting the principles or modes of forming, or of changing, constitutions. It is not for the benefit of those who exercise the powers of government, that con∣stitutions, and the governments issuing from them, are established. In all those matters, the right of judging and acting are in those who pay, and not in those who receive.</P>
<P>A constitution is the property of a nation, and
<PB N="50" REF="63"/> not of those who exercise the government. All the constitutions of America are declared to be estab∣lished on the authority of the people. In France, the word nation is used instead of the people; but in both cases, a constitution is a thing antecedent to the government, and always distinct there∣from.</P>
<P>In England, it is not difficult to perceive that every thing has a constitution, except the nation. Every society and association that is established, first agreed upon a number of original articles, digested into form, which are its constitution. It then appointed its officers, whose powers and authorities are described in that constitution, and the government of that society then commenced. Those officers, by whatever name they are called, have no authority to add to, alter, or abridge the original articles. It is only to the constituting power that this right belongs.</P>
<P>From the want of understanding the difference between a constitution and a government, Dr. Johnson, and all writers of his description, have always bewildered themselves. They could not but perceive, that there must necessarily be a <HI>controuling</HI> power existing somewhere, and they placed this power in the discretion of the persons exercising the government, instead of placing it in a constitution formed by the nation. When it is in a constitution, it has the nation for its support, and the natural and the political controuling powers are together. The laws which are enacted by governments, controul men only as individuals,
<PB N="51" REF="64"/> but the nation, through its constitution, controuls the whole government, and has a natural ability so to do. The final controuling power, therefore, and the original constituting power, are one and the same power.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson could not have advanced such a position in any country where there was a consti∣tution; and he is himself an evidence, that no such thing as a constitution exists in England.—But it may be put as a question, not improper to be in∣vestigated, That if a constitution does not exist, how came the idea of its existence so generally established?</P>
<P>In order to decide this question, it is necessary to consider a constitution in both its cases:—First, as creating a government and giving it powers. Secondly, as regulating and restraining the powers so given.</P>
<P>If we begin with William of Normandy, we find that the government of England was origi∣nally a tyranny, founded on an invasion and con∣quest of the country. This being admitted, it will then appear, that the exertion of the nation, at different periods, to abate that tyranny, and render it less intolerable, has been credited for a constitution.</P>
<P>Magna Charta, as it was called, (it is now like an almanack of the same date,) was no more than compelling the government to renounce a part of its assumptions. It did not create and give powers to government in the manner a con∣stitution does; but was, as far as it went, of the
<PB N="52" REF="65"/> nature of a re-conquest, and not of a constitution; for could the nation have totally expelled the usurpation, as France has done its despotism, it would then have had a constitution to form.</P>
<P>The history of the Edwards and the Henries, and up to the commencement of the Stuarts, exhibits as many instances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had restricted it. The Stuarts endeavoured to pass those limits, and their fate is well known. In all those instances we see nothing of a constitution, but only of restrictions on assumed power.</P>
<P>After this, another William, descended from the same stock, and claiming from the same origin, gained possession; and of the two evils, <HI>James</HI> and <HI>William,</HI> the nation preferred what it thought the least; since, from circumstances, it must take one. The act, called the Bill of Rights, comes here into view. What is it, but a bargain, which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges? You shall have so much, and I will have the rest; and with respect to the nation, it said, for <HI>your share,</HI> YOU <HI>shall have the right of petitioning.</HI> This being the case, the bill of rights is more properly a bill of wrongs, and of insult. As to what is called the convention parliament, it was a thing that made itself, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few persons got together, and called themselves by that name. Several of them had never been elected, and none of them for the purpose.</P>
<P>From the time of William, a species of govern∣ment
<PB N="53" REF="66"/> arose, issuing out of this coalition bill of rights; and more so, since the corruption intro∣duced at the Hanover succession, by the agency of Walpole; that can be described by no other name than a despotic legislation. Though the parts may embarrass each other, the whole has no bounds; and the only right it acknowledges out of itself, is the right of petitioning. Where then is the constitution either that gives or that restrains power?</P>
<P>It is not because a part of the government is elective, that makes it less a despotism, if the persons so elected, possess afterwards, as a parlia∣ment, unlimited powers. Election, in this case, becomes separated from representation, and the candidates are candidates for despotism.</P>
<P>I cannot believe that any nation, reasoning on its own rights, would have thought of calling those things <HI>a constitution,</HI> if the cry of constitu∣tion had not been set up by the government. It has got into circulation like the words <HI>bore</HI> and <HI>quoz,</HI> by being chalked up in the speeches of parliament, as those words were on window shut∣ters and door posts; but whatever the constitu∣tion may be in other respects, it has undoubtedly been <HI>the most productive machine of taxation that was ever invented.</HI> The taxes in France, under the new constitution, are not quite thirteen shillings per head <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole amount of the assessed taxes of France, for the present year, is three hundred millions of livres, which is twelve millions and a half sterling; and the incidental taxes are esti∣mated at three millions, making in the whole fifteen millions and a half; which, among twenty-four millions of people, is not quite thirteen shillings per head. France has lessened her taxes since the revolution, nearly nine millions sterling annually. Before the revolution, the city of Paris paid a duty of upwards of thirty per cent. on all articles brought into the city. This tax was collected at the city gates. It was taken off on the first of last May, and the gates taken down.</NOTE>, and the taxes in England,
<PB N="54" REF="67"/> under what is called its present constitution, are forty-eight shillings and sixpence per head, men, women, and children, amounting to nearly seven∣teen millions sterling, besides the expence of col∣lection, which is upwards of a million more.</P>
<P>In a country like England, where the whole of the civil government is executed by the people of every town and county, by means of parish officers, magistrates, quarterly sessions, juries, and assize; without any trouble to what is called the govern∣ment, or any other expence to the revenue than the salary of the judges, it is astonishing how such a mass of taxes can be employed. Not even the internal defence of the country is paid out of the revenue. On all occasions, whether real or con∣trived, recourse is continually had to new loans and new taxes. No wonder, then, that a machine of government so advantageous to the advocates of a court, should be so triumphantly extolled! No won∣der, that St. James's or St. Stephen's should echo with the continual cry of constitution! No wonder, that the French revolution should be reprobated, and the <HI>res-publica</HI> treated with reproach! The <HI>red
<PB N="55" REF="68"/> book</HI> of England, like the red book of France, will explain the reason <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What was called the <HI>livre rouge,</HI> or the red book, in France, was not exactly similar to the court calendar in England; but it sufficiently shewed how a great part of the taxes was lavished.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I will now, by way of relaxation, turn a thought or two to Mr. Burke. I ask his pardon for neg∣lecting him so long.</P>
<P>"America," says he, (in his speech on the Canada constitution bill) <Q>never dreamed of such absurd doctrine as the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke is such a bold presumer, and ad∣vances his assertions and his premises with such a deficiency of judgment, that, without troubling ourselves about principles of philosophy or politics, the mere logical conclusions they pro∣duce, are ridiculous. For instance,</P>
<P>If governments, as Mr. Burke asserts, are not founded on the Rights of MAN, and are founded on <HI>any rights</HI> at all, they consequently must be founded on the rights of <HI>something</HI> that is <HI>not man.</HI> What then is that something?</P>
<P>Generally speaking, we know of no other creatures that inhabit the earth than man and beast; and in all cases, where only two things offer themselves, and one must be admitted, a negation proved on any one, amounts to an affir∣mative on the other; and therefore, Mr. Burke, by proving against the Rights of <HI>Man,</HI> proves in
<PB N="56" REF="69"/> behalf of the <HI>beast;</HI> and consequently, proves that government is a beast: and as difficult things sometimes explain each other, we now see the origin of keeping wild beasts in the Tower; for they certainly can be of no other use than to shew the origin of the government. They are in the place of a constitution. O John Bull, what honours thou hast lost by not being a wild beast. Thou mightest, on Mr. Burke's system, have been in the Tower for life.</P>
<P>If Mr. Burke's arguments have not weight enough to keep one serious, the fault is less mine than his; and as I am willing to make an apology to the reader for the liberty I have taken, I hope Mr. Burke will also make his for giving the cause.</P>
<P>Having thus paid Mr. Burke the compliment of remembering him, I return to the subject.</P>
<P>From the want of a constitution in England to restrain and regulate the wild impulse of power, many of the laws are irrational and tyrannical, and the administration of them vague and pro∣blematical.</P>
<P>The attention of the government of England, (for I rather chuse to call it by this name, than the English government) appears, since its political connection with Germany, to have been so compleatly engrossed and absorbed by foreign affairs, and the means of raising taxes, that it seems to exist for no other purposes. Domestic concerns are neglected; and, with respect to regular law, there is scarcely such a thing.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="70"/>Almost every case now must be determined by some precedent, be that precedent good or bad, or whether it properly applies or not; and the prac∣tice is become so general, as to suggest a suspicion, that it proceeds from a deeper policy than at first sight appears.</P>
<P>Since the revolution of America, and more so since that of France, this preaching up the doctrine of precedents, drawn from times and circumstances antecedent to those events, has been the studied practice of the English government. The gene∣rality of those precedents are founded on prin∣ciples and opinions, the reverse of what they ought; and the greater distance of time they are drawn from, the more they are to be suspected. But by associating those precedents with a super∣stitious reverence for ancient things, as monks shew relics and call them holy, the generality of mankind are deceived into the design. Govern∣ments now act as if they were afraid to awaken a single reflection in man. They are softly leading him to the sepulchre of precedents, to deaden his faculties and call his attention from the scene of revolutions. They feel that he is arriving at knowledge faster than they wish, and their policy of precedents is the barometer of their fears. This political popery, like the ecclesiastical popery of old, has had its day, and is hastening to its exit. The ragged relic and the antiquated precedent, the monk and the monarch, will moul∣der together.</P>
<P>Government by precedent, without any regard
<PB N="58" REF="71"/> to the principle of the precedent, is one of the vilest systems that can be set up. In numerous instances, the precedent ought to operate as a warning, and not as an example, and requires to be shunned instead of imitated; but instead of this, precedents are taken in the lump, and put at once for constitution and for law.</P>
<P>Either the doctrine of precedents is policy to keep man in a state of ignorance, or it is a prac∣tical confession that wisdom degenerates in govern∣ments as governments increase in age, and can only hobble along by the stilts and crutches of precedents. How is it that the same persons who would proudly be thought wiser than their predecessors, appear at the same time only as the ghosts of departed wisdom? How strangely is an∣tiquity treated! To answer some purposes it is spoken of as the times of darkness and ignorance, and to answer others, it is put for the light of the world.</P>
<P>If the doctrine of precedents, is to be followed, the expences of government need not continue the same. Why pay men extravagantly, who have but little to do? If every thing that can happen is already in precedent, legislation is at an end, and precedent, like a dictionary, determines every case. Either, therefore, government has arrived at its dotage, and requires to be reno∣vated, or all the occasions for exercising its wisdom have occured.</P>
<P>We now see all over Europe, and particularly in England, the curions phaenomenon of a nation
<PB N="59" REF="72"/> looking one way, and a government the other— the one forward and the other backward. If governments are to go on by precedent, while nations go on by improvement, they must at last come to a final separation; and the sooner, and the more civilly, they determine this point, the better <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In England, the improvements in agriculture, useful arts, manufactures, and commerce, have been made in opposition to the genius of its government, which is that of following prece∣dents. It is from the enterprize and industry of the individuals, and their numerous associations, in which, tritely speaking, government is neither pillow nor bolster, that these improve∣ments have proceeded. No man thought about the govern∣ment, or who was <HI>in,</HI> or who was <HI>out,</HI> when he was planning or executing those things; and all he had to hope, with respect to government, was, <HI>that it would let him alone.</HI> Three or four very silly ministerial news-papers are continually offending against the spirit of national improvement, by ascribing it to a minister. They may with as much truth ascribe this book to a minister.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having thus spoken of constitutions generally, as things distinct from actual governments, let us proceed to consider the parts of which a constitu∣tion is composed.</P>
<P>Opinions differ more on this subject, than with respect to the whole. That a nation ought to have a constitution, as a rule for the conduct of its government, is a simple question in which all men, not directly courtiers, will agree. It is only on the component parts that questions and opin∣ions multiply.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="73"/>But this difficulty, like every other, will diminish when put into a train of being rightly understood.</P>
<P>The first thing is, that a nation has a right to establish a constitution.</P>
<P>Whether it exercises this right in the most judicious manner at first, is quite another case. It exercises it agreeably to the judgment it pos∣sesses; and by continuing to do so, all errors will at last be exploded.</P>
<P>When this right is established in a nation, there is no fear that it will be employed to its own injury. A nation can have no interest in being wrong.</P>
<P>Though all the constitutions of America are on one general principle, yet no two of them are exactly alike in their component parts, or in the distribution of the powers which they give to the actual governments. Some are more, and others less complex.</P>
<P>In forming a constitution, it is first necessary to consider what are the ends for which government is necessary? Secondly, what are the best means, and the least expensive, for accomplishing those ends?</P>
<P>Government is nothing more than a national association; and the object of this association is the good of all, as well individually as collec∣tively. Every man wishes to pursue his occupa∣tion, and to enjoy the fruits of his labours, and the produce of his property in peace and safety, and with the least possible expence. When these
<PB N="61" REF="74"/> things are accomplished, all the objects for which government ought to be established are answered.</P>
<P>It has been customary to consider government under three distinct general heads. The legisla∣tive, the executive, and the judicial.</P>
<P>But if we permit our judgment to act unincum∣bered by the habit of multiplied terms, we can perceive no more than two divisions of power, of which civil government is composed, namely, that of legislating or enacting laws, and that of executing or administering them. Every thing, therefore, appertaining to civil government, classes itself under one or other of these two divisions.</P>
<P>So far as regards the execution of the laws, that which is called the judicial power, is strictly and properly the executive power of every country. It is that power to which every individual has appeal, and which causes the laws to be executed; neither have we any other clear idea with respect to the official execution of the laws. In England, and also in America and France, this power begins with the magistrate, and proceeds up through all the courts of judicature.</P>
<P>I leave to courtiers to explain what is meant by calling monarchy the executive power. It is merely a name in which acts of government are done; and any other, or none at all, would answer the same purpose. Laws have neither more nor less authority on this account. It must be from the justness of their principles, and the interest which a nation feels therein, that they derive support; if
<PB N="62" REF="75"/> they require any other than this, it is a sign that something in the system of government is imper∣fect. Laws difficult to be executed cannot be generally good.</P>
<P>With respect to the organization of the <HI>legisla∣tive power,</HI> different modes have been adopted in different countries. In America it is generally composed of two houses. In France it consists but of one, but in both countries it is wholly by representation.</P>
<P>The case is, that mankind (from the long tyranny of assumed power) have had so few oppor∣tunities of making the necessary trials on modes and principles of government, in order to dis∣cover the best, <HI>that government is but now beginning to be known,</HI> and experience is yet wanting to de∣termine many particulars.</P>
<P>The objections against two houses are, first, that there is an inconsistency in any part of a whole legislature, coming to a final determination by vote on any matter, whilst <HI>that matter,</HI> with respect to <HI>that whole,</HI> is yet only in a train of delibera∣tion, and consequently open to new illustrations.</P>
<P>Secondly, That by taking the vote on each, as a separate body, it always admits of the possibility, and is often the case in practice, that the minority governs the majority, and that, in some instances, to a degree of great inconsistency.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That two houses arbitrarily checking or controuling each other is inconsistent; because it
<PB N="63" REF="76"/> cannot be proved, on the principles of just represen∣tation, that either should be wiser or better than the other. They may check in the wrong as well as in the right,—and therefore, to give the power where we cannot give the wisdom to use it, nor be assured of its being rightly used, renders the hazard at least equal to the precaution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>With respect to the two houses, of which the English Par∣liament is composed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a legislature, to have no temper of its own. The minister, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it sleeps obedience.</P>
<P>But if we look at the distinct abilities of the two houses, the difference will appear so great, as to shew the inconsistency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to use it. Wretched as the state of representation is in Eng∣land, it is manhood compared with what is called the house of Lords; and so little is this nick-named house regarded, that the people scarcely inquire at any time what it is doing. It ap∣pears also to be most under influence, and the furthest removed from the general interest of the nation. In the debate on en∣gaging in the Russian and Turkish war, the majority in the house of peers in favour of it was upwards of ninety, when in the other house, which is more than double its numbers, the majority was sixty-three.</P>
<P>The proceedings on Mr. Fox's bill, respecting the rights of juries, merits also to be noticed. The persons called the peers were not the objects of that bill. They are already in possession of more privileges than that bill gave to others. They are their own jury, and if any of that house were prosecuted for a libel, he would not suffer, even upon conviction, for the first offence. Such inequality in laws ought not to exist in any country. The French constitution says, That <HI>the law is the same to every individual, whether to protect or to punish. All are equal in its sight.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="77"/>The objection against a single house is, that it is always in a condition of committing itself too soon.—But it should at the same time be remem∣bered, that when there is a constitution which de∣fines the power, and establishes the principles within which a legislature shall act, there is al∣ready a more effectual check provided, and more powerfully operating, than any other check can be. For example,</P>
<P>Were a bill to be brought into any of the Ame∣rican legislatures, similar to that which was passed into an act by the English parliament, at the com∣mencement of George the First, to extend the du∣ration of the assemblies to a longer period than they now sit, the check is in the constitution, which in effect says, <HI>Thus far shalt thou go and no further.</HI></P>
<P>But in order to remove the objection against a single house, (that of acting with too quick an impulse▪ and at the same time to avoid the incon∣sistencies, in some cases absurdities, arising from two houses, the following method has been pro∣posed as an improvement upon both.</P>
<P>First, To have but one representation.</P>
<P>Secondly, To divide that representation, by lot, into two or three parts.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That every proposed bill, shall be first debated in those parts by succession, that they may become the hearers of each other, but without taking any vote. After which the whole repre∣sentation
<PB N="65" REF="78"/> to assemble for a general debate and de∣termination by vote.</P>
<P>To this proposed improvement has been added another, for the purpose of keeping the represen∣tation in a state of constant renovation▪ which is, that one-third of the representation of each county, shall go out at the expiration of one year, and the number be replaced by new elections.—Another third at the expiration of the second year replaced in like manner, and every third year to be a ge∣neral election <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As to the state of representation in England, it is too absurd to be reasoned upon. Almost all the represented parts are decreasing in population, and the unrepresented parts are increasing. A general convention of the nation is necessary to take the whole state of its government into consideration.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But in whatever manner the separate parts of a constitution may be arranged, there is <HI>one</HI> general principle that distinguishes freedom from slavery, which is, that all <HI>hereditary government over a people is to them a species of slavery, and represen∣tative government is freedom.</HI></P>
<P>Considering government in the only light in which it should be considered, that of a NA∣TIONAL ASSOCIATION; it ought to be so con∣structed as not to be disordered by any accident happening among the parts; and, therefore, no extraordinary power, capable of producing such an effect, should be lodged in the hands of any indi∣vidual. The death, sickness, absence, or defec∣tion,
<PB N="66" REF="79"/> of any one individual in a government, ought to be a matter of no more consequence, with respect to the nation, than if the same circum∣stance had taken place in a member of the English Parliament, or the French National As∣sembly.</P>
<P>Scarcely any thing presents a more degrading character of national greatness, than its being thrown into confusion by any thing happening to, or acted by, an individual; and the ridiculousness of the scene is often increased by the natural insignificance of the person by whom it is occasioned. Were a government so constructed, that it could not go on unless a goose or a gander were present in the senate, the difficulties would be just as great and as real on the flight or sickness of the goose, or the gander, as if it were called a King. We laugh at individuals for the silly difficulties they make to themselves, without perceiving, that the greatest of all ridiculous things are acted in go∣vernments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is related, that in the canton of Berne, in Swisserland, it had been customary, from time immemorial, to keep a bear at the public expence, and the people had been taught to be∣lieve, that if they had not a bear they should all be undone. It happened some years ago, that the bear, then in being, was taken sick and died too suddenly to have his place immediately supplied with another. During this interregnum the people discovered, that the corn grew, and the vintage flourished, and the sun and moon continued to rise and set, and every thing went on the same as before, and, taking courage from these cir∣cumstances, they resolved not to keep any more bears; for said they, <Q>a bear is a very voracious, expensive animal, and we were obliged to pull out his claws, lest he should hurt the citizens.</Q></P>
<P>The story of the bear of Berne was related in some of the French news-papers, at the time of the flight of Louis XVI. and the application of it to monarchy could not be mistaken in France; but it seems, that the aristocracy of Berne applied it to themselves, and have since prohibited the reading of French news-papers.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="80"/>All the constitutions of America are on a plan that excludes the childish embarrassments which occur in monarchical countries. No suspension of government can there take place for a moment, from any circumstance whatever. The system of representation provides for every thing, and is the only system in which nations and governments can always appear in their proper character.</P>
<P>As extraordinary power, ought not to be lodged in the hands of any individual, so ought there to be no appropriations of public money to any per∣son, beyond what his services in a state may be worth. It signifies not whether a man be called a president, a king, an emperor, a senator, or by any other name, which propriety or folly may devise, or arrogance assume, it is only a certain service he can perform in the state; and the ser∣vice of any such individual in the rotine of office, whether such office be called monarchical, presi∣dential, senatorial, or by any other name or title, can never exceed the value of ten thousand
<PB N="68" REF="81"/> pounds a year. All the great services that are done in the world are performed by volunteer characters, who accept nothing for them; but the rotine of office is always regulated to such a general standard of abilities as to be within the compass of numbers in every country to per∣form, and therefore cannot merit very extraor∣dinary recompence. <HI>Government,</HI> says Swift, <HI>is a plain thing, and fitted to the capacity of many heads.</HI></P>
<P>It is inhuman to talk of a million sterling a year, paid out of the public taxes of any country, for the support of any individual, whilst thousands who are forced to contribute thereto, are pining with want, and struggling with misery. Govern∣ment does not consist in a contrast between prisons and palaces, between poverty and pomp; it is not instituted to rob the needy of his mite, and increase the wretchedness of the wretched.—But of this part of the subject I shall speak hereafter, and confine myself at present to political obser∣vations.</P>
<P>When extraordinary power and extraordinary pay are allotted to any individual in a govern∣ment, he becomes the center, round which every kind of corruption generates and forms. Give to any man a million a year, and add thereto the power of creating and disposing of places, at the expence of a country, and the liberties of that country are no longer secure. What is called the splendor of a throne is no other than the corrup∣tion
<PB N="69" REF="82"/> of the state. It is made up of a band of pa∣rasites, living in luxurious indolence, out of the public taxes.</P>
<P>When once such a vicious system is established it becomes the guard and protection of all inferior abuses. The man who is in the receipt of a mil∣lion a year is the last person to promote a spirit of reform, lest, in the event, it should reach to him∣self. It is always his interest to defend inferior abuses, as so many out-works to protect the cita∣del; and in this species of political fortification, all the parts have such a common dependence that it is never to be expected they will attack each other <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is scarcely possible to touch on any subject, that will not suggest an allusion to some corruption in governments. The simile of <HI>"fortifications,"</HI> unfortunately involves with it a cir∣cumstance, which is directly in point with the matter above alluded to.</P>
<P>Among the numerous instances of abuse which have been acted or protected by governments, ancient or modern, there is not a greater than that of quartering a man and his heirs upon the public, to be maintained at its expence.</P>
<P>Humanity dictates a provision for the poor; but by what right, moral or political, does any government assume to say, that the person called the Duke of Richmond, shall be maintained by the public? Yet, if common report is true, not a beggar in London can purchase his wretched pittance of coal, without paying towards the civil list of the Duke of Richmond. Were the whole produce of this imposition but a shilling a year, the iniquitous principle would be still the same; but when it amounts, as it is said to do, to not less than twenty thousand pounds <HI>per ann.</HI> the enor∣mity is too serious to be permitted to remain—This is one of the effects of monarchy and aristocracy.</P>
<P>In stating this case, I am led by no personal dislike. Though I think it mean in any man to live upon the public, the vice originates in the government; and so general is it become, that whether the parties are in the ministry or in the opposition, it makes no difference: they are sure of the guarantee of each other.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="83"/>Monarchy would not have continued so many ages in the world, had it not been for the abuses it protects. It is the master-fraud, which shelters all others. By admitting a participation of the spoil, it makes itself friends; and when it ceases to do this, it will cease to be the idol of courtiers.</P>
<P>As the principle on which constitutions are now formed rejects all hereditary pretentions to government, it also rejects all that catalogue of assumptions known by the name of preroga∣tives.</P>
<P>If there is any government where prerogatives might with apparent safety be entrusted to any individual, it is in the foederal government of America. The President of the United States of America is elected only for four years. He is not only responsible in the general sense of the word, but a particular mode is laid down in the constitution for trying him. He cannot be elected under thirty-five years of age; and he must be a native of the country.</P>
<P>In a comparison of these cases with the govern∣ment of England, the difference when applied to the latter amounts to an absurdity. In England the person who exercises prerogative is often a
<PB N="71" REF="84"/> foreigner; always half a foreigner, and always married to a foreigner. He is never in full natural or political connection with the country, is not responsible for any thing, and becomes of age at eighteen years; yet such a person is per∣mitted to form foreign alliances, without even the knowledge of the nation, and to make war and peace without its consent.</P>
<P>But this is not all. Though such a person cannot dispose of the government, in the manner of a testator, he dictates the marriage connections, which, in effect, accomplishes a great part of the same end. He cannot directly bequeath half the government to Prussia, but he can form a marriage partnership that will produce almost the same thing. Under such circumstances, it is happy for England that she is not situated on the continent, or she might, like Holland, fall under the dicta∣torship of Prussia. Holland, by marriage, is as effectually governed by Prussia, as if the old tyranny of bequeathing the government had been the means.</P>
<P>The presidency in America, (or, as it is some∣times called, the executive,) is the only office from which a foreigner is excluded, and in England it is the only one to which he is ad∣mitted. A foreigner cannot be a member of parliament, but he may be what is called a king. If there is any reason for excluding foreigners, it ought to be from those offices where mischief can most be acted, and where, by uniting every
<PB N="72" REF="85"/> bias of interest and attachment, the trust is best secured.</P>
<P>But as nations proceed in the great business of forming constitutions, they will examine with more precision into the nature and business of that department which is called the executive. What the legislative and judicial departments are, every one can see; but with respect to what, in Europe, is called the executive, as distinct from those two, it is either a political superfluity or a chaos of unknown things.</P>
<P>Some kind of official department, to which reports shall be made from the different parts of a nation, or from abroad, to be laid before the national representatives, is all that is necessary; but there is no consistency in calling this the executive; neither can it be considered in any other light than as inferior to the legislative. The sovereign authority in any country is the power of making laws, and every thing else is an official department.</P>
<P>Next to the arrangement of the principles and the organization of the several parts of a consti∣tution, is the provision to be made for the sup∣port of the persons to whom the nation shall confide the administration of the constitutional powers.</P>
<P>A nation can have no right to the time and services of any person at his own expence, whom it may chuse to employ or entrust in any depart∣ment whatever; neither can any reason be given
<PB N="73" REF="86"/> for making provision for the support of any one part of a government and not for the other.</P>
<P>But, admitting that the honour of being en∣trusted with any part of a government is to be considered a sufficient reward, it ought to be so to every person alike. If the members of the legislature of any country are to serve at their own expence, that which is called the executive, whether monarchical, or by any other name, ought to serve in like manner. It is inconsistent to pay the one, and accept the service of the other gratis.</P>
<P>In America, every department in the govern∣ment is decently provided for; but no one is extravagantly paid. Every member of Congress, and of the assemblies, is allowed a sufficiency for his expences. Whereas in England, a most prodigal provision is made for the support of one part of the government, and none for the other, the consequence of which is, that the one is furnished with the means of corruption, and the other is put into the condition of being corrupted. Less than a fourth part of such expence, applied as it is in America, would remedy a great part of the corruption.</P>
<P>Another reform in the American constitutions, is the exploding all oaths of personality. The oath of allegiance in America is to the nation only. The putting any individual as a figure for a nation is improper. The happiness of a nation is the superior object, and therefore the intention
<PB N="74" REF="87"/> of an oath of allegiance ought not to be obscured by being figuratively taken, to, or in the name of, any person. The oath, called the civic oath, in France, viz. the <HI>"nation, the law, and the king,"</HI> is improper. If taken at all, it ought to be as in America, to the nation only. The law may or may not be good; but, in this place, it can have no other meaning, than as being conducive to the happiness of the nation, and therefore is included in it. The remainder of the oath is improper, on the ground, that all personal oaths ought to be abolished. They are the remains of tyranny on one part, and slavery on the other; and the name of the CREATOR ought not to be introduced to witness the degradation of his creation; or if taken, as is already mentioned, as figurative of the nation, it is in this place redundant. But whatever apology may be made for oaths at the first establishment of a government, they ought not to be permitted afterwards. If a govern∣ment requires the support of oaths, it is a sign that it is not worth supporting, and ought not to be supported. Make government what it ought to be, and it will support itself.</P>
<P>To conclude this part of the subject:—One of the greatest improvements that has been made for the perpetual security and progress of consti∣tutional liberty, is the provision which the new constitutions make for occasionally revising, altering, and amending them.</P>
<P>The principle upon which Mr. Burke formed
<PB N="75" REF="88"/> his political creed, that <Q>of binding and controul∣ing posterity to the end of time, and of renouncing and abdicating the rights of all posterity for ever,</Q> is now become too detestable to be made a subject of debate; and, therefore, I pass it over with no other notice than exposing it.</P>
<P>Government is but now beginning to be known. Hitherto it has been the mere exer∣cise of power, which forbad all effectual en∣quiry into rights, and grounded itself wholly on possession. While the enemy of liberty was its judge, the progress of its principles must have been small indeed.</P>
<P>The constitutions of America, and also that of France, have either affixed a period for their re∣vision, or laid down the mode by which improve∣ments shall be made. It is perhaps impossible to establish any thing that combines principles with opinions and practice, which the progress of circumstances, through a length of years, will not in some measure derange, or render inconsistent; and, therefore, to prevent inconveniences accu∣mulating, till they discourage reformations or provoke revolutions, it is best to provide the means of regulating them as they occur. The Rights of Man are the rights of all generations of men, and cannot be monopolized by any. That which is worth following, will be followed for the sake of its worth; and it is in this that its security lies, and not in any conditions with which it may be encumbered. When a man
<PB N="76" REF="89"/> leaves property to his heirs, he does not connect it with an obligation that they shall accept it. Why then should we do otherwise with respect to constitutions?</P>
<P>The best constitution that could now be de∣vised, consistent with the condition of the present moment, may be far short of that excellence which a few years may afford. There is a morning of reason rising upon man on the subject of government, that has not appeared before. As the barbarism of the present old governments expires, the moral condition of nations with respect to each other will be changed. Man will not be brought up with the savage idea of considering his species as his enemy, because the accident of birth gave the individuals existence in countries distinguished by different names; and as constitutions have always some relation to external as well as to domestic circum∣stances, the means of benefiting by every change, foreign or domestic, should be a part of every con∣stitution.</P>
<P>We already see an alteration in the national disposition of England and France towards each other, which, when we look back to only a few years, is itself a revolution. Who could have foreseen, or who would have believed, that a French National Assembly would ever have been a popular toast in England, or that a friendly alliance of the two nations should become the wish of either. It shews, that man, were he not
<PB N="77" REF="90"/> corrupted by governments, is naturally the friend of man, and that human nature is not of itself vicious. That spirit of jealousy and ferocity, which the governments of the two countries inspired, and which they rendered subservient to the purpose of taxation, is now yielding to the dictates of reason, interest, and humanity. The trade of courts is beginning to be understood, and the affectation of mystery, with all the artificial sorcery by which they imposed upon mankind, is on the decline. It has received its death-wound; and though it may linger, it will expire.</P>
<P>Government ought to be as much open to improvement as any thing which appertains to man, instead of which it has been monopo∣lized from age to age, by the most ignorant and vicious of the human race. Need we any other proof of their wretched manage∣ment, than the excess of debts and taxes with which every nation groans, and the quarrels into which they have precipitated the world?</P>
<P>Just emerging from such a barbarous con∣dition, it is too soon to determine to what extent of improvement government may yet be carried. For what we can foresee, all Europe may form but one great republic, and man be free of the whole.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. WAYS AND MEANS of improving the condi∣tion of EUROPE, interspersed with MISCELLA∣NEOUS OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IN contemplating a subject that embraces with equatorial magnitude the whole region of hu∣manity, it is impossible to confine the pursuit in one single direction. It takes ground on every character and condition that appertains to man, and blends the individual, the nation, and the world.</P>
<P>From a small spark, kindled in America, a flame has arisen, not to be extinguished. With∣out consuming, like the <HI>Ultima Ratio Regum,</HI> it winds its progress from nation to nation, and conquers by a silent operation. Man finds himself changed, he scarcely perceives how. He acquires a knowledge of his rights by attending justly to his interest, and discovers in the event that the strength and powers of despotism consist wholly in the fear of resisting it, and that, in order <Q>to be free, it is sufficient that he wills it.</Q></P>
<P>Having in all the preceding parts of this work endeavoured to establish a system of principles as a basis, on which governments ought to be erected; I shall proceed in this, to the ways and means of rendering them into practice. But in order to introduce this part of the subject with
<PB N="79" REF="92"/> more propriety, and stronger effect, some preli∣minary observations, deducible from, or connected with, those principles, are necessary.</P>
<P>Whatever the form or constitution of govern∣ment may be, it ought to have no other object than the <HI>general</HI> happiness. When, instead of this, it operates to create and encrease wretchedness in any of the parts of society, it is on a wrong sys∣tem, and reformation is necessary.</P>
<P>Customary language has classed the condition. of man under the two descriptions of civilized and uncivilized life. To the one it has ascribed feli∣city and affluence; to the other hardship and want. But, however, our imagination may be impressed by painting and comparison, it is nevertheless true, that a great portion of mankind, in what are called civilized countries, are in a state of poverty and wretchedness, far below the condi∣tion of an Indian▪ I speak not of one country, but of all. It is so in England, it is so all over Eu∣rope. Let us enquire into the cause.</P>
<P>It lies not in any natural defect in the prin∣ciples of civilization, but in preventing those principles having an universal operation; the con∣sequence of which is, a perpetual system of war and expence, that drains the country, and defeats the general felicity of which civilization is capa∣ble.</P>
<P>All the European governments (France now excepted) are constructed not on the principle of universal civilization, but on the reverse of it. So far as those governments relate to each other,
<PB N="80" REF="93"/> they are in the same condition as we conceive of savage uncivilized life; they put themselves be∣yond the law as well of GOD as of man, and are, with respect to principle and reciprocal conduct, like so many individuals in a state of nature.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of every country, under the civilization of laws, easily civilize together, but governments being yet in an uncivilized state, and almost continually at war, they pervert the abun∣dance which civilized life produces to carry on the uncivilized part to a greater extent. By thus engrafting the barbarism of government upon the internal civilization of a country, it draws from the latter, and more especially from the poor, a great portion of those earnings, which should be applied to their own subsistence and comfort.—A∣part from all reflections of morality and philosophy, it is a melancholy fact, that more than one-fourth of the labour of mankind is annually consumed by this barbarous system.</P>
<P>What has served to continue this evil, is the pecuniary advantage, which all the governments of Europe have found in keeping up this state of un∣civilization. It affords to them pretences for power, and revenue, for which there would be neither occasion nor apology, if the circle of civi∣lization were rendered compleat. Civil govern∣ment alone, or the government of laws, is not productive of pretences for many taxes; it ope∣rates at home, directly under the eye of the coun∣try, and precludes the possibility of much imposi∣tion. But when the scene is laid in the unciviliz∣ed
<PB N="81" REF="94"/> contention of governments, the field of pre∣tences is enlarged, and the country, being no longer a judge, is open to every imposition, which governments please to act.</P>
<P>Not a thirtieth, scarely a fortieth, part of the taxes which are raised in England are either occasioned by, or applied to, the purposes of civil government. It is not difficult to see, that the whole which the actual government does in this respect, is to enact laws, and that the country administers and executes them, at its own ex∣pence, by means of magistrates, juries, sessions, and assize, over and above the taxes which it pays.</P>
<P>In this view of the case, we have two distinct characters of government; the one the civil government, or the government of laws, which operates at home, the other the court or cabi∣net government, which operates abroad, on the rude plan of uncivilized life; the one attended with little charge, the other with boundless extra∣vagance; and so distinct are the two, that if the latter were to sink, as it were by a sudden open∣ing of the earth, and totally disappear, the former would not be deranged. It would still proceed, because it is the common interest of the nation that it should, and all the means are in practice.</P>
<P>Revolutions, then, have for their object, a change in the moral condition of governments, and with this change the burthen of public taxes will lessen, and civilization will be left to the en∣joyment of that abundance, of which it is now de∣prived.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="95"/>In contemplating the whole of this subject, I extend my views into the department of com∣merce. In all my publications, where the matter would admit, I have been an advocate for com∣merce, because I am a friend to its effects. It is a pacific system, operating to cordialize mankind, by rendering nations, as well as individuals, useful to each other. As to mere theoretical reformation, I have never preached it up. The most effectual process is that of improving the condition of man by means of his interest; and it is on this ground that I take my stand.</P>
<P>If commerce were permitted to act to the uni∣versal extent it is capable, it would extirpate the system of war, and produce a revolution in the uncivilized state of governments. The invention of commerce has arisen since those governments began, and is the greatest approach towards uni∣versal civilization, that has yet been made by any means not immediately flowing from moral principles.</P>
<P>Whatever has a tendency to promote the civil intercourse of nations, by an exchange of benefits, is a subject as worthy of philosophy as of politics. Commerce is no other than the traffic of two indi∣viduals, multiplied on a scale of numbers; and by the same rule that nature intended the inter∣course of two, she intended that of all. For this purpose she has distributed the materials of manu∣factures and commerce, in various and distant parts of a nation and of the world; and as they cannot be procured by war so cheaply or so com∣modiously
<PB N="83" REF="96"/> as by commerce, she has rendered the latter the means of extirpating the former.</P>
<P>As the two are nearly the opposites of each other, consequently, the uncivilized state of Eu∣ropean governments is injurious to commerce. Every kind of destruction or embarrassment serves to lessen the quantity, and it matters but little in what part of the commercial world the reduction begins. Like blood, it cannot be taken from any of the parts, without being taken from the whole mass in circulation, and all partake of the loss. When the ability in any nation to buy is destroyed, it equally involves the seller. Could the government of England destroy the commerce of all other nations, she would most effectually ruin her own.</P>
<P>It is possible that a nation may be the car∣rier for the world, but she cannot be the mer∣chant. She cannot be the seller and the buyer of her own merchandize. The ability to buy must reside out of herself; and, therefore, the prosperity of any commercial nation is regulated by the prosperity of the rest. If they are poor she cannot be rich, and her condition, be it what it may, is an index of the height of the commercial tide in other nations.</P>
<P>That the principles of commerce, and its uni∣versal operation may be understood, without un∣derstanding the practice, is a position that reason will not deny; and it is on this ground only that I argue the subject. It is one thing in the
<PB N="84" REF="97"/> counting-house, in the world it is another. With respect to its operation it must necessarily be contemplated as a reciprocal thing; that only one half its powers resides within the nation, and that the whole is as effectually destroyed by de∣stroying the half that resides without, as if the destruction had been committed on that which is within; for neither can act without the other.</P>
<P>When in the last, as well as in former wars, the commerce of England sunk, it was because the general quantity was lessened every where; and it now rises, because commerce is in a rising state in every nation. If England, at this day, imports and exports more than at any former period, the nations with which she trades must necessarily do the same; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> imports are their exports, and <HI>vice versa.</HI></P>
<P>There can be no such thing as a nation flourish∣ing alone in commerce; she can only participate; and the destruction of it in any part must neces∣sarily affect all. When, therefore, governments are at war, the attack is made upon the common stock of commerce, and the consequence is the same as if each had attacked his own.</P>
<P>The present increase of commerce is not to be attributed to ministers, or to any political con∣trivances, but to its own natural operations in consequence of peace. The regular markets had been destroyed, the channels of trade broken up, the high road of the seas infested with robbers of every nation, and the attention of the world called to other objects. Those interruptions have ceased,
<PB N="85" REF="98"/> and peace has restored the deranged condition of things to their proper order <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In America, the increase of commerce is greater in pro∣portion than in England. It is, at this time, at least one half more than at any period prior to the revolution. The greatest number of vessels cleared out of the port of Philadelphia, before the commencement of the war, was between eight and nine hundred. In the year 1788, the number was upwards of twelve hundred. As the state of Pennsylvania is estimated as an eighth part of the United States in population, the whole number of vessels must now be nearly ten thousand.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is worth remarking, that every nation reck∣ons the balance of trade in its own favour; and therefore something must be irregular in the common ideas upon this subject.</P>
<P>The fact, however, is true, according to what is called a balance; and it is from this cause that commerce is universally supported. Every nation feels the advantage, or it would abandon the practice: but the deception lies in the mode of making up the accounts, and in attributing what are called profits to a wrong cause.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt has sometimes amused himself, by shewing what he called a balance of trade from the custom-house books. This mode of calcula∣tion, not only affords no rule that is true, but one that is false.</P>
<P>In the first place, Every cargo that departs from the custom-house, appears on the books as an export; and, according to the custom-house balance, the losses at sea, and by foreign failures,
<PB N="86" REF="99"/> are all reckoned on the side of profit, because they appear as exports.</P>
<P>Secondly, Because the importation by the smuggling trade does not appear on the custom-house books, to arrange against the exports.</P>
<P>No balance, therefore, as applying to superior advantages, can be drawn from those documents; and if we examine the natural operation of com∣merce, the idea is fallacious; and if true, would soon be injurious. The great support of com∣merce consists in the balance being a level of benefits among all nations.</P>
<P>Two merchants of different nations trading to∣gether, will both become rich, and each makes the balance in his own favour; consequently, they do not get rich out of each other; and it is the same with respect to the nations in which they reside. The case must be, that each nation must get rich out of its own means, and increases that riches by something which it procures from another in exchange.</P>
<P>If a merchant in England sends an article of English manufacture abroad, which costs him a shilling at home, and imports something which sells for two, he makes a balance of one shilling in his own favour: but this is not gained out of the foreign nation or the foreign merchant, for he also does the same by the article he receives, and neither has a balance of advantage upon the other. The original value of the two articles in their proper countries were but two shillings; but by
<PB N="87" REF="100"/> changing their places, they acquire a new idea of value, equal to double what they had at first, and that increased value is equally divided.</P>
<P>There is no otherwise a balance on foreign than on domestic commerce. The merchants of London and Newcastle trade on the same princi∣ples, as if they resided in different nations, and make their balances in the same manner: yet London does not get rich out of Newcastle, any more than Newcastle out of London: but coals, the merchandize of Newcastle, have an additional value at London, and London merchandize has the same at Newcastle.</P>
<P>Though the principle of all commerce is the same, the domestic, in a national view, is the part the most beneficial; because the whole of the advantages, on both sides, rests within the nation; whereas, in foreign commerce, it is only a participation of one half.</P>
<P>The most unprofitable of all commerce is that connected with foreign dominion. To a few individuals it may be beneficial, merely because it is commerce; but to the nation it is a loss. The expence of maintaining dominion more than absorbs the profits of any trade. It does not increase the general quantity in the world, but operates to lessen it; and as a greater mass would be afloat by relinquishing dominion, the partici∣pation without the expence would be more valu∣able than a greater quantity with it.</P>
<P>But it is impossible to engross commerce by
<PB N="88" REF="101"/> dominion; and therefore it is still more fallacious. It cannot exist in confined channels, and neces∣sarily breaks out by regular or irregular means, that defeat the attempt; and to succeed would be still worse. France, since the revolution, has been more than indifferent as to foreign posses∣sions; and other nations will become the same, when they investigate the subject with respect to commerce.</P>
<P>To the expence of dominion is to be added that of navies, and when the amount of the two are subtracted from the profits of commerce, it will appear, that what is called the balance of trade, even admitting it to exist, is not enjoyed by the nation, but absorbed by the government.</P>
<P>The idea of having navies for the protection of commerce is delusive. It is putting the means of destruction for the means of protection. Com∣merce needs no other protection than the recipro∣cal interest which every nation feels in support∣ing it—it is common stock—it exists by a balance of advantages to all; and the only inter∣ruption it meets, is from the present uncivilized state of governments, and which it is its com∣mon interest to reform <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I saw Mr. Pitt's mode of estimating the balance of trade, in one of his parliamentary speeches, he appeared to me to know nothing of the nature and interest of commerce; and no man has more wantonly tortured it than himself. During a period of peace, it has been havocked with the calamities of war. Three times has it been thrown into stagnation, and the vessels unmaned by impressing, within less than four years of peace.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="102"/>Quitting this subject, I now proceed to other matters.—As it is necessary to include England in the prospect of a general reformation, it is proper to enquire into the defects of its govern∣ment. It is only by each na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> reforming its own, that the whole can be improved and the full benefit of reformation enjoyed. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> partial advantages can flow from partial reforms.</P>
<P>France and England are the only two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ntries in Europe where a reformation in government could have successfully begun. The one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure by the ocean, and the other by the immen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of its internal strength, could defy the maligna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy of foreign despotism. But it is with revolutions as with commerce, the advantages increase by their becoming general, and double to either what each would receive alone.</P>
<P>As a new system is now opening to the view of the world, the European courts are plotting to counteract it. Alliances, contrary to all former systems, are agitating, and a common interest of courts is forming against the common interest of man. This combination draws a line that runs throughout Europe, and presents a cause so entirely new, as to exclude all calculations from former circumstances. While despotism warred with despotism, man had no interest in the con∣test; but in a cause that unites the soldier with the citizen, and nation with nation, the despotism of courts, though it feels the danger, and medi∣tates revenge, is afraid to strike.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="103"/>No question has arisen within the records of history that pressed with the importance of the present. It is not whether this or that party shall be in or out, or whig or tory, or high or low shall prevail; but whether man shall inherit his rights, and universal civilization take place? Whether the fruits of his labours shall be enjoyed by himself, or consumed by the profligacy of governments? Whether robbery shall be banished from courts, and wretchedness from countries?</P>
<P>When, in countries that are called civilized, we see age going to the workhouse and youth to the gallows, something must be wrong in the system of government. It would seem, by the exterior appearance of such countries, that all was happiness; but there lies hidden from the eye of common observation, a mass of wretchedness that has scarcely any other chance, than to expire in poverty or infamy. Its entrance into life is marked with the presage of its fate; and until this is remedied, it is in vain to punish.</P>
<P>Civil government does not consist in execu∣tions; but in making that provision for the in∣struction of youth, and the support of age, as to exclude, as much as possible, profligacy from the one, and despair from the other. Instead of this, the resources of a country are lavished upon kings, upon courts, upon hirelings, imposters, and prostitutes; and even the poor themselves, with all their wants upon them, are compelled to support the fraud that oppresses them.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="104"/>Why is it, that scarcely any are executed but the poor? The fact is a proof, among other things, of a wretchedness in their condition. Bred up without morals, and cast upon the world without a prospect, they are the exposed sacrifice of vice and legal barbarity. The millions that are superfluously wasted upon governments, are more than sufficient to reform those evils, and to benefit the condition of every man in a nation, not included within the purl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eus of a court. This I hope to make appear in the progress of this work.</P>
<P>It is the nature of compassion to associate with misfortune. In taking up this subject I seek no recompence—I fear no consequence. Fortified with that proud integrity, that disdains to tri∣umph or to yield, I will advocate the Rights of Man.</P>
<P>It is to my advantage that I have served an apprenticeship to life. I know the value of moral instruction, and I have seen the danger of the contrary.</P>
<P>At an early period, little more than sixteen years of age, raw and adventurous, and heated with the false heroism of a master<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. William Knowles, master of the grammar school of Thetford, in Norfolk.</NOTE> who had served in a man of war, I began the carver of my own fortune, and entered on board the Terrible, Privateer, Capt. Death. From this adventure I
<PB N="92" REF="105"/> was happily prevented by the affectionate and moral remonstrance of a good father, who, from his own habits of life, being of the Quaker pro∣fession, must begin to look upon me as lost. But the impression, much as it effected at the time, began to wear away, and I entered after∣wards in the King of Prussia Privateer, Capt. Mendez, and went with her to sea. Yet, from such a beginning, and with all the inconvenience of early life against me, I am proud to say, that with a perseverance undismayed by difficulties, a disinterestedness that compelled respect, I have not only contributed to raise a new empire in the world, founded on a new system of govern∣ment, but I have arrived at an eminence in political literature, the most difficult of all lines to succeed and excel in, which aristocracy, with all its aids, has not been able to reach or to rival.</P>
<P>Knowing my own heart, and feeling myself, as I now do, superior to all the skirmish of party, the inveteracy of interested or mistaken opponents, I answer not to falsehood or abuse, but proceed to the defects of the English govern∣ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Politics and self-interest have been so uniformly connected, that the world, from being so often deceived, has a right to be suspicious of public characters: but with regard to myself, I am perfectly easy on this head. I did not, at my first setting out in pub∣lic life, nearly seventeen years ago, turn my thoughts to subjects of government from motives of interest; and my conduct from that moment to this, proves the fact. I saw an opportunity, in which I thought I could do some good, and I followed exactly what my heart dictated. I neither read books, nor studied other people's opinions. I thought for myself. The case was this:</P>
<P>During the suspension of the old governments in America, both prior to, and at the breaking out of hostilities, I was struck with the order and decorum with which every thing was conducted; and impressed with the idea, that a little more than what society naturally performed, was all the government that was necessary; and that monarchy and aristocracy were frauds and impositions upon mankind. On these principles I pub∣lished the pamphlet <HI>Common Sense.</HI> The success it met with was beyond any thing since the invention of printing. I gave the copy right up to every state in the union, and the demand ran to not less than one hundred thousand copies. I continued the subject in the same manner, under the title of the <HI>Crisis,</HI> till the complete establishment of the revolution.</P>
<P>After the declaration of independence, Congress unani∣mously, and unknown to me, appointed me secretary in the foreign department. This was agreeable to me, because it gave me the opportunity of seeing into the abilities of foreign courts, and their manner of doing business. But a misunderstanding arising between congress and me, respecting one of their com∣missioners, then in Europe, Mr. Silas Deane, I resigned the office, and declined, at the same time, the pecuniary offers made me by the ministers of France and Spain, M. Gerard and Don Juan Mirralles.</P>
<P>I had by this time so completely gained the ear and confi∣dence of America, and my own independence was become so visible as to give me a range in political writing, beyond, per∣haps, what any man ever possessed in any country; and what is more extraordinary, I held it undiminished to the end of the war, and enjoy it in the same manner to the present moment. As my object was not myself, I set out with the determination, and happily with the disposition, of not being moved by praise or censure, friendship or calumny, nor of being drawn from my purpose by any personal altereation; and the man who cannot do this, is not fit for a public character.</P>
<P>When the war ended, I went from Philadelphia to Borden-Town, on the east bank of the Delaware, where I have a small place. Congress was at this time at Prince-Town, fifteen miles distant; and General Washington had taken his head∣quarters at Rocky-Hill, within the neighbourhood of Congress, for the purpose of resigning up his commission, (the object for which he accepted it being accomplished,) and of retiring to private life. While he was on this business, he wrote me the letter which I here subjoin.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>During the war, in the latter end of the year 1780, I formed to myself a design of coming over to England; and communi∣cated it to General Greene, who was then in Philadelphia, on his route to the southward, General Washington being then at too great a distance to communicate with immediately. I was strongly impressed with the idea, that if I could get over to England, without being known, and only remain in safety till I could get out a publication, that I could open the eyes of the country with respect to the madness and stupidity of its govern∣ment. I saw that the parties in parliament had pitted them∣selves as far as they could go, and could make no new impres∣sions on each other. General Greene entered fully into my views; but the affair of Arnold and Andrè happening just after, he changed his mind, and, under strong apprehensions for my safety, wrote very pressingly to me from Anapolis, in Maryland, to give up the design, which, with some reluctance, I did. Soon after this I accompanied Col. Lawrens, son of Mr. Lawrens, who was then in the Tower, to France, on business from Congress. We landed at L'Orient; and while I remained there, he being gone forward, a circumstance occurred, that renewed my former design. An English packet from Falmouth to New-York, with the government dispatches on board, was brought into L'Orient. That a packet should be taken, is no extraordinary thing; but that the dispatches should be taken with it, will scarcely be credited, as they are always slung at the cabin window, in a bag loaded with cannon-ball, and ready to be sunk at a moment. The fact, however, is as I have stated it, for the dispatches came into my hands, and I read them. The capture, as I was informed, succeeded by the following stratagem:—The captain of the Madame privateer, who spoke English, on coming up with the packet, passed himself for the captain of an English frigate, and invited the captain of the paeket on board, which, when done, he sent some of his own hands back, and secured the mail. But be the circumstance of the capture what it may, I speak with certainty as to the government dispatches. They were sent up to Paris, to Count Vergennes, and when Col. Lawrens and myself returned to America, we took the originals to Congress.</P>
<P>By these dispatches I saw into the stupidity of the English cabinet, far more than I otherwise could have done, and I renewed my former design. But Col. Lawrens was so unwill∣ing to return alone; more especially, as among other matters, we had a charge of upwards of two hundred thousand pounds sterling in money, that I gave into his wishes, and finally gave up my plan. But I am now certain, that if I could have exe∣cuted it, that it would not have been altogether unsuccessful.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I begin with charters and corporations.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="106"/>It is a perversion of terms to say, that a charter gives rights. It operates by a contrary effect, that of taking rights away. Rights are inherently
<PB N="94" REF="107"/> in all the inhabitants; but charters, by annulling those rights in the majority, leave the right by
<PB N="95" REF="108"/> exclusion in the hands of a few. If charters were constructed so as to express in direct terms,
<Q><PB N="96" REF="109"/>that every inhabitant, who is not a member of a corporation, shall not exercise the right of voting,</Q> such charters would, in the face, be charters, not of rights, but of exclusion. The effect is the same under the form they now stand; and the only persons on whom they operate, are the persons whom they exclude. Those whose rights are guaranteed, by not being taken away, exer∣cise no other rights, than as members of the com∣munity they are entitled to without a charter; and, therefore, all charters have no other than an indirect negative operation. They do not give rights to A, but they make a difference in favour of A by taking away the right of B, and conse∣quently are instruments of injustice.</P>
<P>But charters and corporations have a more extensive evil effect, than what relates merely to elections. They are sources of endless conten∣tions in the places where they exist; and they lessen the common rights of national society. A native of England, under the operation of these charters and corporations, cannot be said to be an Englishman in the full sense of the word. He is not free of the nation, in the same manner
<PB N="97" REF="110"/> that a Frenchman is free of France, and an American of America. His rights are circum∣scribed to the town, and, in some cases, to the parish of his birth; and all other parts, though in his native land, are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m as a foreign country. To acquire a residence in these, he must undergo a local naturalization by purchase, or he is for∣bidden or expelled the place. This species of feudality is kept up to aggrandize the corpora∣tions at the ruin of towns; and the effect is visible.</P>
<P>The generality of corporation towns are in a state of solitary decay, and prevented from further ruin, only by some circumstance in their situation, such as a navigable river, or a plentiful surrounding country. As population is one of the chief sources of wealth, (for without it land itself has no value,) every thing which operates to prevent it must lessen the value of property; and as corporations have not only this tendency, but directly this effect, they cannot but be injurious. If any policy were to be followed, instead of that of general freedom, to every person to settle where he chose, (as in France or America,) it would be more consistent to give encouragement to new comers, than to preclude their admission by exacting premiums from them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is difficult to account for the origin of charter and cor∣poration towns, unless we suppose them to have arisen out of, or been connected with, some species of garrison service. The times in which they began justify this idea. The generality of those towns have been garrisons; and the corporations were charged with the care of the gates of the towns, when no mili∣tary garrison was present. Their refusing or granting admission to strangers, which has produced the custom of giving, selling, and buying freedom, has more of the nature of garrison au∣thority than civil government. Soldiers are free of all corpo∣rations throughout the nation, by the same propriety that every soldier is free of every garrison, and no other persons are. He can follow any employment, with the permission of his officers, in any corporation town throughout the nation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="111"/>The persons most immediately interested in the abolition of corporations, are the inhabitants of the towns where corporations are established. The instances of Manchester, Birmingham, and Sheffield, shew, by contrast, the injury which those Gothic institutions are to property and com∣merce. A few examples may be found, such as that of London, whose natural and commercial advantage, owing to its situation on the Thames, is capable of bearing up against the political evils of a corporation; but in almost all other cases the fatality is too visible to be doubted or denied.</P>
<P>Though the whole nation is not so directly affected by the depression of property in corpora∣tion towns as the inhabitants themselves, it par∣takes of the consequence. By lessening the value of property, the quantity of national commerce is curtailed. Every man is a customer in propor∣tion to his ability; and as all parts of a nation trade with each other, whatever affects any of
<PB N="99" REF="112"/> the parts, must necessarily communicate to the whole.</P>
<P>As one of the houses of the English parlia∣ment is, in a great measure, made up of elections from these corporations; and as it is unnatural that a pure stream should flow from a foul foun∣tain, its vices are but a continuation of the vices of its origin. A man of moral honour and good political principles, cannot submit to the mean drudgery and disgraceful arts, by which such elections are carried. To be a successful candi∣date, he must be destitute of the qualities that con∣stitute a just legislator: and being thus disciplined to corruption by the mode of entering into parlia∣ment, it is not to be expected that the represen∣tative should be better than the man.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in speaking of the English repre∣sentation, has advanced as bold a challenge as ever was given in the days of chivalry. <Q>Our representation,</Q> says he, <Q>has been found <HI>perfectly adequate to all the purposes</HI> for which a representation of the people can be desired or devised. I defy,</Q> continues he, <Q>the enemies of our constitution to shew the contrary.</Q>— This declaration from a man, who has been in constant opposition to all the measures of parlia∣ment the whole of his political life, a year or two excepted, is most extraordinary; and, comparing him with himself, admits of no other alter∣native, than that he acted against his judgment as a member, or has declared contrary to it as an author.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="113"/>But it is not in the representation only that the defects lie, and therefore I proceed in the next place to the aristocracy.</P>
<P>What is called the House of Peers, is consti∣tuted on a ground very similar to that, against which there is a law in other cases. It amounts to a combination of persons in one common interest. No reason can be given, why an house of legislation should be composed entirely of men whose occupation consists in letting landed pro∣perty, than why it should be composed of those who hire, or of brewers, or bakers, or any other separate class of men.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke calls this house, <Q>the great ground and pillar of security to the landed interest.</Q> Let us examine this idea.</P>
<P>What pillar of security does the landed interest require more than any other interest in the state, or what right has it to a distinct and separate representation from the general interest of a nation? The only use to be made of this power, (and which it has always made,) is to ward off taxes from itself, and throw the burthen upon such articles of consumption by which itself would be least affected.</P>
<P>That this has been the consequence, (and will always be the consequence of constructing govern∣ments on combinations,) is evident with respect to England, from the history of its taxes.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding taxes have encreased and mul∣tiplied upon every article of common consump∣tion,
<PB N="101" REF="114"/> the land-tax, which more particularly affects this "pillar," has diminished. In 1788, the amount of the land-tax was 1,950,000 £. which is half a million less than it produced almost an hundred years ago <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sir John Sinclair's History of the Revenue. The land-tax in 1646 was £ 2,473,499.</NOTE>, notwithstanding the rentals are in many instances doubled since that period.</P>
<P>Before the coming of the Hanoverians, the taxes were divided in nearly equal proportions between the land and articles of consumption, the land bearing rather the largest share: but since that aera, nearly thirteen millions annually of new taxes have been thrown upon consumption. The consequence of which has been a constant encrease in the number and wretchedness of the poor, and in the amount of the poor-rates. Yet here again the burthen does not fall in equal proportions on the aristocracy with the rest of the community. Their residences, whether in town or country, are not mixed with the habitations of the poor. They live apart from distress, and the expence of relieving it. It is in manufac∣turing towns and labouring villages that those burthens press the heaviest; in many of which it is one class of poor supporting another.</P>
<P>Several of the most heavy and productive taxes are so contrived, as to give an exemption to this pillar, thus standing in its own defence. The tax upon beer brewed for sale does not affect the ari∣stocracy,
<PB N="102" REF="115"/> who brew their own beer free of this duty. It falls only on those who have not con∣veniency or ability to brew, and who must pur∣chase it in small quantities. But what will man∣kind think of the justice of taxation, when they know, that this tax alone, from which the ari∣stocracy are from circumstances exempt, is nearly equal to the whole of the land-tax, being in the year 1788, and it is not less now, 1,666,152 £. and with its proportion of the taxes on malt and hops, it exceeds it.—That a single article, thus partially consumed, and that chiefly by the work∣ing part, should be subject to a tax, equal to that on the whole rental of a nation, is, perhaps, a fact not to be paralleled in the histories of revenues.</P>
<P>This is one of the consequences resulting from an house of legislation, composed on the ground of a combination of common interest; for what∣ever their separate politics as to parties may be, in this they are united. Whether a combination acts to raise the price of any article for sale, or the rate of wages; or whether it acts to throw taxes from itself upon another class of the com∣munity, the principle and the effect are the same; and if the one be illegal, it will be difficult to shew that the other ought to exist.</P>
<P>It is to no use to say, that taxes are first proposed in the house of commons; for as the other house has always a negative, it can always defend itself; and it would be ridiculous to suppose that its acquiescence in the measures to be proposed were not understood before hand. Besides which, it
<PB N="103" REF="116"/> has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so much influence by borough-traffic, and so many of its relations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> connec∣tions are distributed on both sides of the com∣mons, as to give it, besides an absolute negative in one house, a preponderancy in the other, in all matters of common concern.</P>
<P>It is difficult to discover what is meant by the <HI>landed interest,</HI> if it does not mean a combination of aristocratical land-holders, opposing their own pecuniary interest to that of the farmer, and every branch of trade, commerce, and manufacture. In all other respects it is the only interest that needs no partial protection. It enjoys the general protection of the world. Every individual, high or low, is interested in the fruits of the earth; men, women, and children, of all ages and degrees, will turn out to assist the farmer, rather than a harvest should not be got in; and they will not act thus by any other property. It is the only one for which the common prayer of man∣kind is put up, and the only one that can never fail from the want of means. It is the interest, not of the policy, but of the existence of man, and when it ceases he must cease to be.</P>
<P>No other interest in a nation stands on the same united support. Commerce, manufactures, arts, sciences, and every thing else, compared with this, are supported but in parts. Their prosperity or their decay has not the same uni∣versal influence. When the vallies laugh and
<PB N="104" REF="117"/> sing, it is not the farmer only, but all creation that rejoices. It is a prosperity that excludes all envy; and this cannot be said of any thing else.</P>
<P>Why then does Mr. Burke talk of his house of peers, as the pillar of the landed interest? Were that pillar to sink into the earth, the same landed property would continue, and the same plough∣ing, sowing, and reaping would go on. The aristocracy are not the farmers who work the land, and raise the produce, but are the mere consumers of the rent; and when compared with the active world, are the drones, a seraglio of males, who neither collect the honey nor form the hive, but exist only for lazy enjoyment.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in his first essay, called aristocracy, <HI>"the Corinthian capital of polished society."</HI> To∣wards compleating the figure, he has now added the <HI>pillar;</HI> but still the base is wanting; and whenever a nation chuses to act a Samson, not blind, but bold, down go the temple of Dagon, the Lords and the Philistines.</P>
<P>If a house of legislation is to be composed of men of one class, for the purpose of protecting a distinct interest, all the other interests should have the same. The inequality, as well as the burthen of taxation, arises from admitting it in one case, and not in all. Had there been an house of farmers, there had been no game laws; or an house of merchants and manufacturers, the taxes had neither been so unequal nor so exces∣sive. It is from the power of taxation being in
<PB N="105" REF="118"/> the hands of those who can throw so great a part of it from their own shoulders, that it has raged without a check.</P>
<P>Men of small or moderate estates, are more injured by the taxes being thrown on articles of consumption, than they are eased by warding it from landed property, for the following reasons:</P>
<P>First, They consume more of the productive taxable articles, in proportion to their property, than those of large estates.</P>
<P>Secondly, Their residence is chiefly in towns, and their property in houses; and the encrease of the poor-rates, occasioned by taxes on consump∣tion, is in much greater proportion than the land-tax has been favoured. In Birmingham, the poor-rates are not less than seven shillings in the pound. From this, as is already observed, the aristocracy are in a great measure exempt.</P>
<P>These are but a part of the mischiefs flowing from the wretched scheme of an house of peers.</P>
<P>As a combination, it can always throw a con∣siderable portion of taxes from itself; and as an hereditary house, accountable to nobody, it resembles a rotten borough, whose consent is to be courted by interest. There are but few of its members, who are not in some mode or other participaters, or disposers of the public money. One turns a candle-holder, or a lord in waiting; another a lord of the bed-chamber, a groom of the stole, or any insignificant nominal office, to which a salary is annexed, paid out of the public
<PB N="106" REF="119"/> taxes, and which avoids the direct appearance of corruption. Such situations are derogatory to the character of man; and where they can be submitted to, honour cannot reside.</P>
<P>To all these are to be added the numerous dependants, the long list of younger branches and distant relations, who are to be provided for at the public expence: in short, were an estima∣tion to be made of the charge of aristocracy to a nation, it will be found nearly equal to that of supporting the poor. The Duke of Richmond alone (and there are cases similar to his) takes away as much for himself as would maintain two thousand poor and aged persons. Is it, then, any wonder, that under such a system of government, taxes and rates have multiplied to their present extent?</P>
<P>In stating these matters, I speak an open and disinterested language, dictated by no passion but that of humanity. To me, who have not only refused offers, because I thought them improper, but have declined rewards I might with reputa∣tion have accepted, it is no wonder that meanness and imposition appear disgustful. Independence is my happiness, and I view things as they are, without regard to place or person; my country is the world, and my religion is to do good.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in speaking of the aristocratical law of primogeniture, says, <Q>it is the standing law of our landed inheritance; and which, without question, has a tendency, and I think,</Q>
<PB N="107" REF="120"/> continues he, <Q>a happy tendency, to preserve a character of weight and consequence.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke may call this law what he pleases, but humanity and impartial reflection will de∣nounce it a law of brutal injustice. Were we not accustomed to the daily practice, and did we only hear of it as the law of some distant part of the world, we should conclude that the legislators of such countries had not yet arrived at a state of civilization.</P>
<P>As to its preserving a character of <HI>weight and consequence,</HI> the case appears to me directly the reverse. It is an attaint upon character; a sort of privateering on family property. It may have weight among dependent tenants, but it gives none on a scale of national, and, much less of universal character. Speaking for myself, my parents were not able to give me a shilling, beyond what they gave me in education; and to do this they distressed themselves: yet, I possess more of what is called consequence, in the world, than any one in Mr. Burke's catalogue of ari∣stocrats.</P>
<P>Having thus glanced at some of the defects of the two houses of parliament, I proceed to what is called the crown upon which I shall be very concise.</P>
<P>It signifies a nominal office of a million sterling a year, the business of which consists in receiving the money. Whether the person be wise or foolish, sane or insane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every ministry acts upon the same
<PB N="108" REF="121"/> idea that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the people must be hood-winked, and held in super∣stitious ignorance by some bugbear or other; and what is called the crown answers this purpose, and therefore it answers all the purposes to be expected from it. This is more than can be said of the other two branches.</P>
<P>The hazard to which this office is exposed in all countries, is not from any thing that can happen to the man, but from what may happen to the nation—the danger of its coming to its senses.</P>
<P>It has been customary to call the crown the executive power, and the custom is continued, though the reason has ceased.</P>
<P>It was called the <HI>executive,</HI> because the person whom it signified used, formerly, to sit in the character of a judge, in administering or execut∣ing the laws. The tribunals were then a part of the court. The power, therefore, which is now called the judicial, is what was called the execu∣tive; and, consequently, one or other of the terms is redundant, and one of the offices useless. When we speak of the crown now, it means nothing; it signifies neither a judge nor a general: besides which it is the laws that govern, and not the man. The old terms are kept up, to give an appearance of consequence to empty forms; and the only effect they have is that of increasing expences.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the means of rendering governments more conducive to the general
<PB N="109" REF="122"/> happiness of mankind, than they are at present, it will not be improper to take a review of the progress of taxation in England.</P>
<P>It is a general idea, that when taxes are once laid on, they are never taken off. However true this may have been of late, it was not always so. Either, therefore, the people of former times were more watchful over government than those of the present, or government was administered with less extravagance.</P>
<P>It is now seven hundred years since the Norman conquest, and the establishment of what is called the crown. Taking this portion of time in seven separate periods of one hundred years each, the amount of the annual taxes, at each period, will be as follows:—

The people of Eng∣land of the present day, have a traditionary and historical idea of the bravery of their ancestors; but whatever their virtues or their vices might have been, they certainly were a people who would not be imposed upon, and who kept government in awe as to taxation, if not as to principle.

<P>The difference between the first four hundred years and the last three, is so astonishing, as to warrant an opinion, that the national character of the English has changed. It would have been
<PB N="111" REF="124"/> impossible to have dragooned the former English, into the excess of taxation that now exists; and when it is considered that the pay of the army, the navy, and of all the revenue-officers, is the same now as it was above a hundred years ago, when the taxes were not above a tenth part of what they are at present, it appears impossible to account for the enormous increase and expen∣diture, on any other ground, than extravagance, corruption, and intrigue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Several of the court newspapers have of late made fre∣quent mention of Wat Tyler. That his memory should be traduced by court sycophants, and all those who live on the spoil of a public, is not to be wondered at. He was, however, the means of checking the rage and injustice of taxation in his time, and the nation owed much to his valour. The history is concisely this:—In the time of Richard the second, a poll-tax was levied, of one shilling per head, upon every person in the nation, of whatever estate or condition, on poor as well as rich, above the age of fifteen years. If any favour was shewn in the law, it was to the rich rather than to the poor; as no person could be charged more than twenty shillings for himself, family, and servants, though ever so numerous; while all other families, under the number of twenty, were charged per head. Poll-taxes had always been odious; but this being also oppres∣sive and unjust, it excited, as it naturally must, universal detes∣tation among the poor and middle classes. The person known by the name of Wat Tyler, whose proper name was Walter, and a tyler by trade, lived at Deptford. The gatherer of the poll-tax, on coming to his house, demanded tax for one of his daughters, whom Tyler declared was under the age of fifteen. The tax-gatherer insisted on satisfying himself, and began an indecent examination of the girl, which enraging the father, he struck him with a hammer, that brought him to the ground, and was the cause of his death.</P>
<P>This circumstance served to bring the discontents to an issue. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood espoused the cause of Tyler, who, in a few days was joined, according to some histories, by upwards of fifty thousand men, and chosen their chief. With this force he marched to London, to demand an abolition of the tax, and a redress of other grievances. The court, finding itself in a forlorn condition, and unable to make resistance, agreed, with Richard at its head, to hold a conference with Tyler in Smithfield, making many fair professions, courtier like, of its dispositions to redress the oppressions. While Richard and Tyler were in conversation on these matters, each being on horseback, Walworth, then mayor of London, and one of the creatures of the court, watched an opportunity, and like a cowardly assassin, stabbed Tyler with a dagger; and two or three others falling upon him, he was instantly sacrificed.</P>
<P>Tyler appears to have been an intrepid disinterested man, with respect to himself. All his proposals made to Richard, were on a more just and public ground, than those which had been made to John by the Barons; and notwithstanding the sycophancy of historians, and men like Mr. Burke, who seek to gloss over a base action of the court by traducing Tyler, his fame will outlive their falsehood. If the Barons merited a monument to be erected in Runnymede, Tyler merits one in Smithfield.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="125"/>With the revolution of 1688, and more so since the Hanover succession; came the destruc∣tive system of continental intrigues, and the rage for foreign wars and foreign dominion; systems of such secure mystery that the expences admit of no accounts; a single line stands for millions. To what excess taxation might have extended, had not the French revolution contributed to break up the system, and put an end to pretences, is impossible to say. Viewed, as that revolution ought to be, as the fortunate means of lessening the load of taxes of both countries, it is of as
<PB N="113" REF="126"/> much importance to England as to France; and, if properly improved to all the advantages of which it is capable, and to which it leads, de∣serve as much celebration in one country as the other.</P>
<P>In pursuing this subject, I shall begin with the matter that first presents itself, that of lessening the burthen of taxes; and shall then add such matters and propositions, respecting the three countries of England, France, and America, as the present prospect of things appears to justify: I mean, an alliance of the three, for the pur∣poses that will be mentioned in their proper place.</P>
<P>What has happened may happen again. By the statement before shewn of the progress of taxation, it is seen, that taxes have been lessened to a fourth part of what they had formerly been. Though the present circumstances do not admit of the same reduction, yet it admits of such a beginning, as may accomplish that end in less time, than in the former case.</P>
<P>The amount of taxes for the year, ending at Michaelmas 1788, was as follows:

</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="127"/>Since the year 1788, upwards of one million, new taxes, have been laid on, besides the produce from the lotteries; and as the taxes have in gene∣ral been more productive since than before, the amount may be taken, in round numbers, at £ 17,000,000.</P>
<P>N. B. The expence of collection and the draw∣backs, which together amount to nearly two millions, are paid out of the gross amount; and the above is the nett sum paid into the exchequer.</P>
<P>This sum of seventeen millions is applied to two different purposes; the one to pay the interest of the national debt, the other to the current ex∣pences of each year. About nine millions are ap∣propriated to the former; and the remainder, being nearly eight millions, to the latter. As to the million, said to be applied to the reduction of the debt, it is so much like paying with one hand and taking out with the other, as not to merit much notice.</P>
<P>It happened, fortunately for France, that she possessed national domains for paying off her debt, and thereby lessening her taxes: but as this is not the case in England, her reduction of taxes can only take place by reducing the current expences, which may now be done to the amount of four or five millions annually, as will hereafter appear. When this is accomplished, it will more than counterbalance the enormous charge of the American war; and the saving will
<PB N="115" REF="128"/> be from the same source from whence the evil arose.</P>
<P>As to the national debt, however heavy the interest may be in taxes; yet, as it serves to keep alive a capital, useful to commerce, it balances by its effects a considerable part of its own weight; and as the quantity of gold and silver in England is, by some means or other, short of its proper proportion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Foreign intrigue, foreign wars, and foreign dominions, will in a great measure account for the deficiency.</NOTE>, (being not more than twenty mil∣lions, whereas it should be sixty,) it would, besides the injustice, be bad policy to extinguish a capital that serves to supply that defect. But with respect to the current expence, whatever is saved therefrom is gain. The excess may serve to keep corruption alive, but it has no re-action on credit and commerce, like the interest of the debt.</P>
<P>It is now very probable, that the English go∣vernment (I do not mean the nation) is un∣friendly to the French revolution. Whatever serves to expose the intrigue and lessen the influence of courts, by lessening taxation, will be unwelcome to those who feed upon the spoil. Whilst the clamour of French intrigue, arbitrary power, popery, and wooden shoes could be kept up, the nation was easily allured and alarmed into taxes. Those days are now past; deception, it is to be hoped, has reaped its last harvest, and better times are in prospect for both countries, and for the world.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="129"/>Taking it for granted, that an alliance may be formed between England, France, and America, for the purposes hereafter to be mentioned, the national expences of France and England may con∣sequently be lessened. The same fleets and armies will no longer be necessary to either, and the reduction can be made ship for ship on each side. But to accomplish these objects, the governments must necessarily be fitted to a common and cor∣respondent principle. Confidence can never take place, while an hostile disposition remains in either, or where mystery and secrecy on one side, is op∣posed to candour and openness on the other.</P>
<P>These matters admitted, the national expences might be put back, <HI>for the sake of a precedent,</HI> to what they were at some period when France and England were not enemies. This, consequently, must be prior to the Hanover succession, and also to the revolution of 1688 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I happened to be in England at the celebration of the cen∣tenary of the revolution of 1688. The characters of William and Mary have always appeared to me detestable; the one seek∣ing to destroy his uncle, and the other her father, to get posses∣sion of power themselves; yet, as the nation was disposed to think something of that event, I felt hurt at seeing it ascribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had under∣taken it as a jobb, and who, besides what he otherwise got, charged six hundred thousand pounds for the expence of the little fleet that brought him from Holland. George the First acted the same close-fisted part as William had done, and bought the Duchy of Bremin with the money he got from England, two hundred and fifty thousand pounds over and above his pay as king; and having thus purchased it at the expence of England, added it to his Hanoverian dominions for his own private profit. In fact, every nation that does not govern itself, is governed as a jobb. England has been the prey of jobbs ever since the revolution.</NOTE>. The first instance
<PB N="117" REF="130"/> that presents itself, antecedent to those dates, is in the very wasteful and profligate times of Charles the Second; at which time England and France acted as allies. If I have chosen a period of great extravagance, it will serve to shew modern extravagance in a still worse light; especially as the pay of the navy, the army, and the revenue officers has not encreased since that time.</P>

<P>The parliament, however, settled the whole annual peace establishment at 1,200,000 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles, like his predecessors and successors, finding that war was the harvest of governments, engaged in a war with the Dutch, the expence of which encreased the annual expenditure to £ 1,800,000, as stated under the date of 1666; but the peace establishment was but £ 1,300,000.</NOTE>. If we go back to the time of Elizabeth, the amount
<PB N="118" REF="131"/> of all the taxes was but half a million, yet the nation sees nothing during that period, that reproaches it with want of consequence.</P>
<P>All circumstances then taken together, arising from the French revolution, from the approaching harmony and reciprocal interest of the two nations, the abolition of court intrigue on both sides, and the progress of knowledge in the science of go∣vernment, the annual expenditure might be put back to one million and an half, viz.</P>

<P>Even this sum is six times greater than the ex∣pences of government are in America, yet the civil internal government in England, (I mean that administered by means of quarter sessions, juries, and assize, and which, in fact, is nearly the whole, and performed by the nation,) is less expence upon the revenue, than the same species and portion of government is in America.</P>
<P>It is time that nations should be rational, and not be governed like animals, for the pleasure of their riders. To read the history of kings, a man would be almost inclined to suppose that government consisted in stag-hunting, and that every nation paid a million a year to a huntsman. Man ought to have pride, or shame enough to blush at being thus imposed upon, and when he
<PB N="119" REF="132"/> feel his proper character, he will. Upon all sub∣jects of this nature, there is often passing in the mind, a train of ideas he has not yet accustomed himself to encourage and communicate. Re∣strained by something that puts on the character of prudence, he acts the hypocrite upon himself as well as to others. It is, however, curious to observe how soon this spell can be dissolved. A single expression, boldly conceived and uttered, will sometimes put a whole company into their proper feelings; and whole nations are acted upon in the same manner.</P>
<P>As to the offices of which any civil government may be composed, it matters but little by what names they are described. In the rotine of busi∣ness, as before observed, whether a man be stiled a president, a king, an emperor, a senator, or any thing else, it is impossible that any service he can perform, can merit from a nation more than ten thousand pounds a year; and as no man should be paid beyond his services, so every man of a proper heart will not accept more. Public money ought to be touched with the most scrupulous conscious∣ness of honour. It is not the produce of riches only, but of the hard earnings of labour and poverty. It is drawn even from the bitterness of want and misery. Not a beggar passes, or perishes in the streets, whose mite is not in that mass.</P>
<P>Were it possible that the Congress of America, could be so lost to their duty, and to the interest of their constituents, as to offer General Washing∣ton,
<PB N="120" REF="133"/> as president of America, a million a year, he would not, and he could not, accept it. His sense of honour is of another kind. It has cost England almost seventy millions sterling, to maintain a family imported from abroad, of very inferior capacity to thousands in the nation; and scarcely a year has passed that has not produced some new mercenary application. Even the phy∣sicians bills have been sent to the public to be paid. No wonder that jails are crowded, and taxes and poor-rates encreased. Under such systems, nothing is to be looked for but what has already happened; and as to reformation, when∣ever it come, it must be from the nation, and not from the goverment.</P>
<P>To shew that the sum of five hundred thousand pounds is more than sufficient to defray all the expences of government, exclusive of navies and armies, the following estimate is added for any country, of the same extent as England.</P>
<P>In the first place, three hundred representa∣tives, fairly elected, are sufficient for all the purposes to which legislation can apply, and preferable to a larger number. They may be divided into two or three houses, or meet in one, as in France, or in any manner a constitution shall direct.</P>
<P>As representation is always considered, in free countries, as the most honourable of all stations, the allowance made to it is merely to defray the expence which the representatives incur by that service, and not to it as an office.</P>

<P>If a nation chuse, it can deduct four <HI>per cent.</HI> from all offices, and make one of twenty thousand <HI>per ann.</HI></P>
<P>All revenue officers are paid out of the monies they collect, and therefore, are not in this estimation.</P>
<P>The foregoing is not offered as an exact detail of offices, but to shew the number and rate of salaries which five hundred thousand pounds will support; and it will, on experience, be found impracticable to find business sufficient to justify even this expence. As to the manner in which
<PB N="122" REF="135"/> office business is now performed, the Chiefs, in several offices, such as the post-office, and cer∣tain offices in the exchequer, &amp;c. do little more than sign their names three or four times a year; and the whole duty is performed by under clerks.</P>
<P>Taking, therefore, one million and an half as a sufficient peace establishment for all the honest purposes of government, which is three hundred thousand pounds more than the peace establish∣ment in the profligate and prodigal times of Charles the Second, (notwithstanding, as has been already observed, the pay and salaries of the army, navy, and revenue officers, continue the same as at that period,) there will remain a surplus of up∣wards of six millions out of the present current ex∣pences. The question then will be, how to dis∣pose of this surplus.</P>
<P>Whoever has observed the manner in which trade and taxes twist themselves together, must be sensible of the impossibility of separating them suddenly.</P>
<P>First. Because the articles now on hand are already charged with the duty, and the reduction cannot take place on the present stock.</P>
<P>Secondly. Because, on all those articles on which the duty is charged in the gross, such as <HI>per</HI> barrel, hogshead, hundred weight, or tun, the abolition of the duty does not admit of being divided down so as fully to relieve the consumer, who purchases by the pint, or the pound. The last duty laid on strong beer and ale, was three
<PB N="123" REF="136"/> shillings <HI>per</HI> barrel, which, if taken off, would lessen the purchase only half a farthing <HI>per</HI> pint, and consequently, would not reach to practical relief.</P>
<P>This being the condition of a great part of the taxes, it will be necessary to look for such others as are free from this embarrassment, and where the relief will be direct and visible, and capable of immediate operation.</P>
<P>In the first place, then, the poor-rates are a direct tax which every house-keeper feels, and who knows also, to a farthing, the sum which he pays. The national amount of the whole of the poor rates is not positively known, but can be procured. Sir John Sinclair, in his History of the Revenue, has stated it at £. 2,100,587. A considerable part of which is expended in litiga∣tions, in which the poor, instead of being relieved, are tormented. The expence, however, is the same to the parish from whatever cause it arises.</P>
<P>In Birmingham, the amount of the poor-rates is fourteen thousand pounds a year. This, though a large sum, is moderate, compared with the population. Birmingham is said to contain seventy thousand souls, and on a proportion of seventy thousand to fourteen thousand pounds poor-rates, the national amount of poor-rates, taking the population of England at seven mil∣lions, would be but one million four hundred thou∣sand pounds. It is, therefore, most probable, that the population of Birmingham is over-rated.
<PB N="124" REF="137"/> Fourteen thousand pounds is the proportion upon fifty thousand souls, taking two millions of poor-rates as the national amount.</P>
<P>Be it, however, what it may, it is no other than the consequence of the excessive burthen of taxes, for, at the time when the taxes were very low, the poor were able to maintain themselves; and there were no poor-rates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poor-rates began about the time of Henry the Eighth, when the taxes began to encrease, and they have encreased as the taxes encreased ever since.</NOTE>. In the present state of things, a labouring man, with a wife and two or three children, does not pay less than be∣tween seven and eight pounds a year in taxes. He is not sensible of this, because it is disguised to him in the articles which he buys, and he thinks only of their dearness; but as the taxes take from him, at least, a fourth part of his yearly earnings, he is consequently disabled from providing for a family, especially, if himself, or any of them, are afflicted with sickness.</P>
<P>The first step, therefore, of practical relief, would be to abolish the poor-rates entirely, and in lieu thereof, to make a remission of taxes to the poor of double the amount of the present poor-rates, viz. four millions annually out of the surplus taxes. By this measure, the poor would be benefited two millions, and the house-keepers two millions. This alone would be equal to a reduction of one hundred and twenty millions of the national
<PB N="125" REF="138"/> debt, and consequently equal to the whole expence of the American war.</P>
<P>It will then remain to be considered, which is the most effectual mode of distributing this remis∣sion of four millions.</P>
<P>It is easily seen, that the poor are generally composed of large families of children, and old people past their labour. If these two classes are provided for, the remedy will so far reach to the full extent of the case, that what remains will be incidental, and, in a great measure, fall within the compass of benefit clubs, which, though of hum∣ble invention, merit to be ranked among the best of modern institutions.</P>
<P>Admitting England to contain seven million of souls; if one-fifth thereof are of that class of poor which need support, the number will be one mil∣lion four hundred thousand. Of this number, one hundred and forty thousand will be aged poor, as will be hereafter shewn, and for which a distinct provision will be proposed.</P>
<P>There will then remain one million two hun∣dred and sixty thousand, which, at five souls to each family, amount to two hundred and fifty-two thousand families, rendered poor from the ex∣pence of children and the weight of taxes.</P>
<P>The number of children under fourteen years of age, in each of those families, will be found to be about five to every two families; some having two, and others three; some one, and others four; some none, and others five; but it rarely happens
<PB N="126" REF="139"/> that more than five are under fourteen years of age, and after this age they are capable of service or of being apprenticed.</P>
<P>Allowing five children (under fourteen years) to every two families,
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>The number of children will be</CELL>
<CELL>630,000</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>The number of parents were they all liv∣ing, would be</CELL>
<CELL>504,000</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>It is certain, that if the children are provided for, the parents are relieved of consequence, because it is from the expence of bringing up children that their poverty arises.</P>
<P>Having thus ascertained the greatest number that can be supposed to need support on account of young families, I proceed to the mode of relief or distribution, which is,</P>
<P>To pay as a remission of taxes to every poor family, out of the surplus taxes, and in room of poor-rates, four pounds a year for every child un∣der fourteen years of age; enjoining the parents of such children to send them to school, to learn read∣ing, writing, and common arithmetic; the minis∣ters of every parish, of every denomination, to certify jointly to an office, for that purpose, that this duty is performed.</P>
<P><TABLE>

<CELL>£. 2,520,000</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>By adopting this method, not only the poverty of the parents will be relieved, but ignorance will be banished from the rising generation, and the
<PB N="127" REF="140"/> number of poor will hereafter become less, because their abilities, by the aid of education, will be greater. Many a youth, with good natural genius, who is apprenticed to a mechanical trade, such as a carpenter, joiner, millwright, shipwright, black∣smith, &amp;c. is prevented getting forward the whole of his life, from the want of a little common edu∣cation when a boy.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the case of the aged.</P>
<P>I divide age into two classes. First, the ap∣proach of age beginning at fifty. Secondly, old age commencing at sixty.</P>
<P>At fifty, though the mental faculties of man are in full vigour, and his judgment better than at any preceeding date, the bodily powers for laborious life are on the decline. He cannot bear the same quantity of fatigue as at an earlier period. He begins to earn less, and is less capable of enduring wind and weather; and in those more retired em∣ployments where much sight is required, he fails apace, and sees himself, like an old horse, begin∣ning to be turned adrift.</P>
<P>At sixty his labour ought to be over, at least from direct necessity. It is painful to see old age working itself to death, in what are called civilized countries, for daily bread.</P>
<P>To form some judgment of the number of those above fifty years of age, I have several times counted the persons I met in the streets of London, men, women, and children, and have generally found that the average is about one in sixteen or
<PB N="128" REF="141"/> seventeen. If it be said that aged persons do not come much in the streets, so neither do infants; and a great proportion of grown children are in schools, and in work shops as apprentices. Taking then sixteen for a divisor, the whole number of persons, in England, of fifty years and upwards of both sexes, rich and poor, will be four hundred and twenty thousand.</P>
<P>The persons to be provided for out of this gross number will be, husbandmen, common labourers, journeymen of every trade and their wives, sailors, and disbanded soldiers, worn out servants of both sexes, and poor widows.</P>
<P>There will be also a considerable number of middling tradesmen, who having lived decently in the former part of life, begin, as age approaches, to lose their business, and at last fall to decay.</P>
<P>Besides these, there will be constantly thrown off from the revolutions of that wheel, which no man can stop, nor regulate, a number from every class of life connected with commerce and adventure.</P>
<P>To provide for all those accidents, and what∣ever else may befal, I take the number of persons, who at one time or other of their lives, after fifty years of age, may feel it necessary or comfortable to be better supported, than they can support them∣selves, and that not as a matter of grace and fa∣vour, but of right, at one third of the whole num∣ber, which is one hundred and forty thousand, as stated in page 125, and for whom a distinct pro∣vision was proposed to be made. If there be
<PB N="129" REF="142"/> more, society, notwithstanding the shew and pom∣posity of government, is in a deplorable condition in England.</P>
<P>Of this one hundred and forty thousand, I take one half, seventy thousand, to be of the age of fifty and under sixty, and the other half to be sixty years and upwards.—Having thus ascertained the probable proportion of the number of aged per∣sons, I proceed to the mode of rendering their condition comfortable, which is,</P>
<P>To pay to every such person of the age of fifty years, and until he shall arrive at the age of sixty, the sum of six pounds <HI>per ann.</HI> out of the surplus taxes; and ten pounds <HI>per ann.</HI> during life after the age of sixty. The expence of which will be,

<P>This support, as already remarked, is not of the nature of a charity, but of a right. Every person in England, male and female, pays on an average in taxes, two pounds eight shillings and sixpence <HI>per ann.</HI> from the day of his (or her) birth; and, if the expence of collection be added, he pays two pounds eleven shillings and sixpence; con∣sequently, at the end of fifty years he has paid one hundred and twenty-eight pounds fifteen shillings; and at sixty, one hundred and fifty-four pounds ten shillings. Converting, therefore, his (or her) in∣dividual
<PB N="130" REF="143"/> tax into a tontine, the money he shall re∣ceive after fifty years, is but little more than the legal interest of the nett money he has paid; the rest is made up from those whose circumstances do not require them to draw such support, and the capital in both cases defrays the expences of go∣vernment. It is on this ground that I have extend∣ed the probable claims to one third of the number of aged persons in the nation.—Is it then better that the lives of one hundred and forty thousand aged persons be rendered comfortable, or that a million a year o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> public money be expended on any one individual, and him often of the most worthless or insignificant character? Let reason and justice, let honour and humanity, let even hypocrisy, syco∣phancy and Mr. Burke, let George, let Louis, Leopold, Frederic, Catharine, Cornwallis, or Tippoo Saib, answer the question <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Reckoning the taxes by families, five to a family, each family pays on an average, 12<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. per ann.</HI> to this sum are to be added the poor-rates. Though all pay taxes in the articles they consume, all do not pay poor-rates. About two millions are ex∣empted, some as not being house-keepers, others as not being able, and the poor themselves who receive the relief. The ave∣rage, therefore, of poor-rates on the remaining number, is forty shillings for every family of five persons, which makes the whole average amount of taxes and rates, 14<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> For six per∣sons. 17<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> For seven persons, 20<HI>l.</HI> 16<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI></P>

<P>There will then remain three hundred and sixty thousand pounds out of the four millions, part of which may be applied as follows:</P>
<P>After all the above cases are provided for, there will still be a number of families who, though not properly of the class of poor, yet find it difficult to give education to their children; and such chil∣dren, under such a case, would be in a worse con∣dition than if their parents were actually poor. A nation under a well regulated goverment, should permit none to remain uninstructed. It is monar∣chical and aristocratical government only that re∣quires ignorance for its support.</P>
<P>Suppose then four hundred thousand children to be in this condition, which is a greater number
<PB N="132" REF="145"/> than ought to be supposed, after the provisions already made, the method will be,</P>
<P>To allow for each of those children ten shillings a year for the expence of schooling, for six years each, which will give them six months schooling each year, and half a crown a year for paper and spelling books.</P>
<P>The expence of this will be annually <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Public schools do not answer the general purpose of the poor. They are chiefly in corporation towns, from which the country towns and villages are excluded; or if admitted, the distance occasions a great loss of time. Education, to be useful to the poor, should be on the spot; and the best method, I be∣lieve, to accomplish this, is to enable the parents to pay the ex∣pence themselves. There are always persons of both sexes to be found in every village, especially when growing into years, ca∣pable of such an undertaking. Twenty children, at ten shillings each, (and that not more than six months each year) would be as much as some livings amount to in the remote parts of England; and there are often distressed clergymen's widows to whom such an income would be acceptable. Whatever is given on this ac∣count to children answers two purposes, to them it is education, to those who educate them it is a livelihood.</NOTE> £250,000</P>
<P>There will then remain one hundred and ten thousand pounds.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the great modes of relief which the best instituted and best principled government may devise, there will still be a number of smaller cases, which it is good policy as well as beneficence in a nation to consider.</P>
<P>Were twenty shillings to be given to every wo∣man immediately on the birth of a child, who should make the demand, and none will make it
<PB N="133" REF="146"/> whose circumstances do not require it, it might re∣lieve a great deal of instant distress.</P>
<P>There are about two hundred thousand births yearly in England; and if claimed, by one fourth,
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>The amount would be</CELL>
<CELL>50,000</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>And twenty shillings to every new-married couple who should claim in like manner. This would not exceed the sum of</CELL>
<CELL>£. 20,000</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>Also twenty thousand pounds to be appropriated to defray the funeral expences of persons, who, travelling for work, may die at a distance from their friends. By relieving parishes from this charge, the sick stranger will be better treated.</P>
<P>I shall finish this part of the subject with a plan adapted to the particular condition of a metro∣polis, such as London.</P>
<P>Cases are continually occurring in a metropolis different to those which occur in the country, and for which a different, or rather an additional mode of relief is necessary. In the country, even in large towns, people have a knowledge of each other, and distress never rises to that extreme height it sometimes does in a metropolis. There is no such thing in the country as persons, in the literal sense of the word, starved to death, or dying with cold from the want of a lodging. Yet such cases, and others equally as miserable, happen in London.</P>
<P>Many a youth comes up to London full of ex∣pectations, and with little or no money, and un∣less he gets immediate employment he is already
<PB N="134" REF="147"/> half undone; and boys bred up in London with∣out any means of a livelihood, and as it often hap∣pens of dissolute parents, are in a still worse con∣dition; and servants long out of place are not much better off. In short, a world of little cases are continually arising, which busy or affluent life knows not of, to open the first door to distress. Hunger is not among the postponeable wants, and a day, even a few hours, in such a condition, is often the crisis of a life of ruin.</P>
<P>These circumstances, which are the general cause of the little thefts and pilferings that lead to greater, may be prevented. There yet remain twenty thousand pounds out of the four millions of surplus taxes, which, with another fund here∣after to be mentioned, amounting to about twenty thousand pounds more, cannot be better applied than to this purpose. The plan then will be,</P>
<P>First, To erect two or more buildings, or take some already erected, capable of containing at least six thousand persons, and to have in each of these places as many kinds of employment as can be contrived, so that every person who shall come may find something which he or she can do.</P>
<P>Secondly, To receive all who shall come, with∣out enquiring who or what they are. The only condition to be, that for so much, or so many hours work, each person shall receive so many meals of wholesome food, and a warm lodging, at least as good as a barrack. That a certain portion of what each person's work shall be worth shall be reserved,
<PB N="135" REF="148"/> and given to him, or her, on their going away; and that each person shall stay as long, or as short time, or come as often as he chuse, on these conditions.</P>
<P>If each person staid three months, it would assist by rotation twenty-four thousand persons annually, though the real number, at all times, would be but six thousand. By establishing an asylum of this kind, such persons to whom temporary distresses occur, would have an opportunity to recruit them∣selves, and be enabled to look out for better em∣ployment.</P>
<P>Allowing that their labour paid but one half the expence of supporting them, after reserving a por∣tion of their earnings for themselves, the sum of forty thousand pounds additional would defray all other charges for even a greater number than six thousand.</P>
<P>The fund very properly convertible to this pur∣pose, in addition to the twenty thousand pounds, re∣maining of the former fund, will be the produce of the tax upon coals, and so iniquitously and wantonly applied to the support of the Duke of Richmond. It is horrid that any man, more especially at the price coals now are, should live on the distresses of a community; and any government permitting such an abuse, deserves to be dismissed. This fund is said to be about twenty thousand pounds <HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="149"/>I shall now conclude this plan with enumerating the several particulars, and then proceed to other matters.</P>
<P>The enumeration is as follows:</P>
<P>First, Abolition of two million poor-rates.</P>
<P>Secondly, Provision for two hundred and fifty-two thousand poor families.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Education for one million and thirty thousand children.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Comfortable provision for one hun∣dred and forty thousand aged persons.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Donation of twenty shillings each for fifty thousand births.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Donation of twenty shillings each for twenty thousand marriages.</P>
<P>Seventhly, Allowance of twenty thousand pounds for the funeral expences of persons travelling for work, and dying at a distance from their friends.</P>
<P>Eighthly, Employment, at all times, for the ca∣sual poor in the cities of London and Westminster.</P>
<P>By the operation of this plan, the poor laws, those instruments of civil torture, will be super∣ceded, and the wasteful expence of litigation prevent∣ed. The hearts of the humane will not be shocked by ragged and hungry children, and persons of seventy and eighty years of age begging for bread. The dying poor will not be dragged from place to place to breathe their last, as a reprisal of parish upon parish. Widows will have a maintenance for their children, and not be carted away, on the death of their husbands, like culprits and criminals;
<PB N="137" REF="150"/> and children will no longer be considered as en∣creasing the distresses of their parents. The haunts of the wretched will be known, because it will be to their advantage, and the number of petty crimes, the offspring of distress and poverty, will be lessened. The poor, as well as the rich, will then be interested in the support of government, and the cause and apprehension of riots and tumults will cease.—Ye who sit in ease, and solace yourselves in plenty, and such there are in Turkey and Russia, as well as in England, and who say to yourselves, <Q>Are we not well off,</Q> have ye thought of these things? When ye do, ye will cease to speak and feel for yourselves alone.</P>
<P>The plan is easy in practice. It does not em∣barrass trade by a sudden interruption in the order of taxes, but effects the relief by changing the ap∣plication of them; and the money necessary for the purpose can be drawn from the excise collections, which are made eight times a year in every market town in England.</P>
<P>Having now arranged and concluded this sub∣ject, I proceed to the next.</P>
<P>Taking the present current expences at seven millions and an half, which is the least amount they are now at, there will remain (after the sum of one million and an half be taken for the new cur∣rent expences, and four millions for the before-mentioned service) the sum of two millions; part of which to be applied as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="151"/>Though fleets and armies, by an alliance with France, will, in a great measure, become useless, yet the persons who have devoted themselves to those services, and have thereby unfitted themselves for other lines of life, are not to be sufferers by the means that make others happy. They are a dif∣ferent description of men to those who form or hang about a court.</P>
<P>A part of the army will remain at least for some years, and also of the navy, for which a provision is already made in the former part of this plan of one million, which is almost half a million more than the peace establishment of the army and navy in the prodigal times of Charles the Second.</P>
<P>Suppose then fifteen thousand soldiers to be dis∣banded, and to allow to each of those men three shillings a week during life, clear of all deductions, to be paid in the same manner as the Chelsea Col∣lege pensioners are paid, and for them to return to their trades and their friends; and also to add fif∣teen thousand sixpences per week to the pay of the soldiers who shall remain; the annual ex∣pence will be,

As it falls in, a part of the taxes may be taken off; for in∣stance, when thirty thousand pounds fall in the duty on hops may be wholly taken off; and as other parts fall in, the duties on candles and soap may be lessened, till at last they will totally cease.</P>
<P>There now remains at least one million and an half of surplus taxes.</P>
<P>The tax on houses and windows is one of those direct taxes, which, like the poor-rates, is not con∣founded with trade; and, when taken off, the re∣lief
<PB N="140" REF="153"/> will be instantly felt. This tax falls heavy on the middling class of people.</P>

<P>If this tax be struck off, there will then remain about one million of surplus taxes, and as it is al∣ways proper to keep a sum in reserve, for inciden∣tal matters, it may be best not to extend reduc∣tions further, in the first instance, but to consider what may be accomplished by other modes of reform.</P>
<P>Among the taxes most heavily felt is the com∣mutation tax. I shall, therefore, offer a plan for its abolition, by substituting another in its place, which will affect three objects at once:</P>
<P>First, That of removing the burthen to where it can best be borne.</P>
<P>Secondly, Restoring justice among families by a distribution of property.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Extirpating the overgrown influence arising from the unnatural law of primogeniture, and which is one of the principal sources of cor∣ruption at elections.</P>

<P>When taxes are proposed, the country is amused by the plausible language of taxing luxuries. One thing is called a luxury at one time, and some∣thing else at another; but the real luxury does not consist in the article, but in the means of procur∣ing it, and this is always kept out of sight.</P>
<P>I know not why any plant or herb of the field should be a greater luxury in one country than ano∣ther, but an overgrown estate in either is a luxury at all times, and as such is the proper object of taxation. It is, therefore, right to take those kind tax-making gentlemen up on their own word, and argue on the principle themselves have laid down, that of <HI>taxing luxuries.</HI> If they, or their champion Mr. Burke, who, I fear, is growing out of date like the man in armour, can prove that an estate of twenty, thirty, or forty thousand pounds a year is not a luxury, I will give up the argument.</P>
<P>Admitting that any annual sum, say for instance, one thousand pounds, is necessary or sufficient for the support of a family, consequently the second thousand is of the nature of a luxury, the third still more so, and by proceeding on, we shall at last arrive at a sum that may not improperly be called a prohibitable luxury. It would be impo∣litic to set bounds to property acquired by industry, and therefore it is right to place the prohibition
<PB N="142" REF="155"/> beyond the probable acquisition to which industry can extend; but there ought to be a limit to pro∣perty, or the accumulation of it, by bequest. It should pass in some other line. The richest in every nation have poor relations, and those often very near in consanguinity.</P>
<P>The following table of progressive taxation is constructed on the above principles, and as a sub∣stitute for the commutation tax. It will reach the point of prohibition by a regular operation, and thereby supercede the aristocratical law of primo∣geniture.</P>

<P><PB N="145" REF="158"/>At the twenty-third thousand the tax becomes twenty shillings in the pound, and consequently every thousand beyond that sum can produce no profit but by dividing the estate. Yet formidable as this tax appears, it will not, I believe, produce so much as the commutation tax; should it pro∣duce more, it ought to be lowered to that amount upon estates under two or three thousand a year.</P>
<P>On small and middling estates it is lighter (as it is intended to be) than the commutation tax. It is not till after seven or eight thousand a year that it begins to be heavy. The object is not so much the produce of the tax, as the justice of the mea∣sure. The aristocracy has screened itself too much, and this serves to restore a part of the lost equili∣brium.</P>
<P>As an instance of its screening itself, it is only necessary to look back to the first establishment of the excise laws, at what is called the Restoration, or the coming of Charles the Second. The aris∣tocratical interest then in power, commuted the feudal services itself was under by laying a tax on beer brewed for <HI>sale;</HI> that is, they compounded with Charles for an exemption from those services for themselves and their heirs, by a tax to be paid by other people. The aristocracy do not purchase beer brewed for sale, but brew their own beer free of the duty, and if any commutation at that time were necessary, it ought to have been at the expence of those for whom the exemptions from those ser∣vices
<PB N="146" REF="159"/> were intended <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tax on beer brewed for sale, from which the aristocracy are exempt, is almost one million more than the present commu∣tation tax, being by the returns of 1788, 1,666,152<HI>l.</HI> and con∣sequently they ought to take on themselves the amount of the commutation tax, as they are already exempted from one which is almost one million greater.</NOTE>; instead of which it was thrown on an entire different class of men.</P>
<P>But the chief object of this progressive tax (be∣sides the justice of rendering taxes more equal than they are) is, as already stated, to extirpate the overgrown influence arising from the unnatural law of primogeniture, and which is one of the princi∣pal sources of corruption at elections.</P>
<P>It would be attended with no good consequences to enquire how such vast estates as thirty, forty, or fifty thousand a year could commence, and that at a time when commerce and manufactures were not in a state to admit of such acquisitions. Let it be sufficient to remedy the evil by putting them in a condition of descending again to the community, by the quiet means of apportioning them among all the heirs and heiresses of those families. This will be the more necessary, because hitherto the aristocracy have quartered their younger children and connections upon the public i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> useless posts, places, and offices, which when abolished will leave them destitute, unless the law of primogeniture be also abolished or superceded.</P>
<P>A progressive tax will, in a great measure, effect this object, and that as a matter of interest to the
<PB N="147" REF="160"/> parties most immediately concerned, as will be seen by the following table; which shews the nett produce upon every estate, after subtracting the tax. By this it will appear, that after an estate ex∣ceeds thirteen or fourteen thousand a year, the re∣mainder produces but little profit to the holder, and consequently will pass either to the younger children, or to other kindred.</P>

<P>According to this table, an estate cannot pro∣duce more then 12,3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0<HI>l.</HI> clear of the land tax and the progressive tax, and therefore the dividing such estates will follow as a matter of family interest.

<P>Although an enquiry into the origin of those estates be unnecessary, the continuation of them in their present state is another subject. It is a matter of national concern. As hereditary estates, the law has created the evil, and it ought also to provide the remedy. Primogeniture ought to be abolished, not only because it is unnatural and unjust, but because the country suffers by its operation. By cutting off (as before observed) the younger children from their proper portion of inheritance, the public is
<PB N="149" REF="162"/> loaded with the expence of maintaining them; and the freedom of elections violated by the overbearing influence which this unjust monopoly of family pro∣perty produces. Nor is this all. It occasions a waste of national property. A considerable part of the land of the country is rendered unproduc∣tive by the great extent of parks and chases which this law serves to keep up, and this at a time when the annual production of grain is not equal to the national consumption <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the reports on the corn trade</NOTE>.—In short, the evils of the aristocratical system are so great and numerous, so inconsistent with every thing that is just, wise, natu∣ral, and beneficent, that when they are considered, there ought not to be a doubt that many, who are now classed under that description, will wish to see such a system abolished.</P>
<P>What pleasure can they derive from contemplat∣ing the exposed condition, and almost certain beg∣gary of their younger offspring? Every aristocra∣tical family has an appendage of family beggars hanging round it, which in a few ages, or a few generations, are shook off, and console themselves with telling their tale in alms-houses, work-houses, and prisons. This is the natural consequence of aristocracy. The peer and the beggar are often of the same family. One extreme produces the other: to make one rich many must be made poor; nei∣ther can the system be supported by other means.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="163"/>There are two classes of people to whom the laws of England are particularly hostile, and those the most helpless; younger children and the poor. Of the former I have just spoken; of the latter I shall mention one instance out of the many that might be produced, and with which I shall close this subject.</P>
<P>Several laws are in existence for regulating and limiting workmen's wages. Why not leave them as free to make their own bargains, as the law-makers are to let their farms and houses? Per∣sonal labour is all the property they have. Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy to be infringed? But the injustice will appear stronger, if we consider the operation and effect of such laws. When wages are fixed by what is called a law, the legal wages remain stationary, while every thing else is in progression; and as those who make that law, still continue to lay on new taxes by other laws, they encrease the expence of living by one law, and take away the means by another.</P>
<P>But if those gentlemen law-makers and tax-makers thought it right to limit the poor pittance which personal labour can produce, and on which a whole family is to be supported, they certainly must feel themselves happily indulged in a limita∣tion on their own part, of not less than twelve thou∣sand a year, and that of property they never ac∣quired, (nor probably any of their ancestors) and of which they have made so ill a use.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="164"/>Having now finished this subject, I shall bring the several particulars into one view, and then pro∣ceed to other matters.</P>

</LIST>
<P>There yet remains, as already stated, one mil∣lion of surplus taxes. Some part of this will be required for circumstances that do not immediate∣ly present themselves, and such part as shall not be wanted, will admit a further reduction of taxes equal to that amount.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="166"/>Among the claims that justice requires to be made, the condition of the inferior revenue officers will merit attention. It is a reproach to any go∣vernment to waste such an immensity of revenue in sinecures and nominal and unnecessary places and offices, and not allow even a decent livelihood to those on whom the labour falls. The salary of the inferior officers of the revenue has stood at the petty pittance of less than fifty pounds a year for up∣wards of one hundred years. It ought to be se∣venty. About one hundred and twenty thousand pounds applied to this purpose, will put all those salaries in a decent condition.</P>
<P>This was proposed to be done almost twenty years ago, but the treasury-board then in being
<PB N="154" REF="167"/> startled at it, as it might lead to similar expecta∣tions from the army and navy; and the event was, that the King, or somebody for him, applied to parliament to have his own salary raised an hun∣dred thousand a year, which being done, every thing else was laid aside.</P>
<P>With respect to another class of men, the infe∣rior clergy, I forbear to enlarge on their condi∣tion; but all partialities and prejudices for, or against, different modes and forms of religion aside, common justice will determine, whether there ought to be an income of twenty or thirty pounds a year to one man, and of ten thousand to another. I speak on this subject with the more freedom, because I am known not to be a Presbyterian; and therefore the cant cry of court sycophants, about church and meeting, kept up to amuse and bewilder the nation, cannot be raised against me.</P>
<P>Ye simple men, on both sides the question, do ye not see through this courtly craft? If ye can be kept disputing and wrangling about church and meeting, ye just answer the purpose of every cour∣tier, who lives the while on the spoil of the taxes, and laughs at your credulity. Every religion is good that teaches man to be good; and I know of none that instructs him to be bad.</P>
<P>All the before-mentioned calculations, suppose only sixteen millions and an half of taxes paid into the exchequer, after the expence of collection and drawbacks at the custom-house and excise-office
<PB N="155" REF="168"/> are deducted; whereas the sum paid into the ex∣chequer is very nearly, if not quite, seventeen mil∣lions. The taxes raised in Scotland and Ireland are expended in those countries, and therefore their savings will come out of their own taxes; but if any part be paid into the English exchequer, it might be remitted. This will not make one hun∣dred thousand pounds a year difference.</P>
<P>There now remains only the national debt to be considered. In the year 1789, the interest, exclusive of the tontine, was 9,150,138<HI>l.</HI> How much the capital has been reduced since that time the minister best knows. But after paying the interest, abolishing the tax on houses and win∣dows, the commutation tax, and the poor rates; and making all the provisions for the poor, for the education of children, the support of the aged, the disbanded part of the army and navy, and en∣creasing the pay of the remainder, there will be a surplus of one million.</P>
<P>The present scheme of paying off the national debt appears to me, speaking as an indifferent person, to be an ill-concerted, if not a fallacious job. The burthen of the national debt consists not in its being so many millions, or so many hun∣dred millions, but in the quantity of taxes col∣lected every year to pay the interest. If this quan∣tity continue the same, the burthen of the na∣tional debt is the same to all intents and purposes, be the capital more or less. The only knowledge
<PB N="156" REF="169"/> which the public can have of the reduction of the debt, must be through the reduction of taxes for paying the interest. The debt, therefore, is not reduced one farthing to the public by all the mil∣lions that have been paid; and it would require more money now to purchase up the capital, than when the scheme began.</P>
<P>Digressing for a moment at this point, to which I shall return again, I look back to the appoint∣ment of Mr. Pitt, as minister.</P>
<P>I was then in America. The war was over; and though resentment had ceased, memory was still alive.</P>
<P>When the news of the coalition arrived, though it was a matter of no concern to me as a citizen of America, I felt it as a man. It had something in it which shocked, by publicly sporting with de∣cency, if not with principle. It was impudence in Lord North; it was want of firmness in Mr. Fox.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt was, at that time, what may be called a maiden character in politics. So far from being hackneyed, he appeared not to be initiated into the first mysteries of court intrigue. Every thing was in his favour. Resentment against the coali∣tion served as friendship to him, and his ignorance of vice was credited for virtue. With the return of peace, commerce and prosperity would rise of itself; yet even this encrease was thrown to his account.</P>
<P>When he came to the helm the storm was over, and he had nothing to interrupt his course. It re∣quired
<PB N="157" REF="170"/> even ingenuity to be wrong, and he suc∣ceeded. A little time shewed him the same sort of man as his predecessors had been. Instead of profiting by those errors which had accumulated a burthen of taxes unparalleled in the world, he sought, I might almost say, he advertised for ene∣mies, and provoked means to encrease taxation. Aiming at something, he knew not What, he ran∣sacked Europe and India for adventures, and aban∣doning the fair pretensions he began with, became the knight-errant of modern times.</P>
<P>It is unpleasant to see character throw itself away. It is more so to see one's-self deceived. Mr. Pitt had merited nothing, but he promised much. He gave symptoms of a mind superior to the meanness and corruption of courts. His ap∣parent candour encouraged expectations; and the public confidence, stunned, wearied, and confounded by a chaos of parties, revived and attached itself to him. But mistaking, as he has done, the disgust of the nation against the coalition, for merit in himself, he has rushed into measures, which a man less supported would not have pre∣sumed to act.</P>
<P>All this seems to shew that change of ministers amounts to nothing. One goes out, another comes in, and still the same measures, vices, and extra∣vagance are pursued. It signifies not who is mi∣nister. The defect lies in the system. The foun∣dation and the superstructure of the government
<PB N="158" REF="171"/> is bad. Prop it as you please, it continually sinks into court government, and ever will.</P>
<P>I return, as I promised, to the subject of the national debt, that offspring of the Dutch-Anglo revolution, and its handmaid the Hanover suc∣cession.</P>
<P>But it is now too late to enquire how it began. Those to whom it is due have advanced the mo∣ney; and whether it was well or ill spent, or pocketed, is not their crime. It is, however, easy to see, that as the nation proceeds in contemplat∣ing the nature and principles of government, and to understand taxes, and make comparisons be∣tween those of America, France, and England, it will be next to impossible to keep it in the same torpid state it has hitherto been. Some re∣form must, from the necessity of the case, soon begin. It is not whether these principles press with little or much force in the present moment. They are out. They are abroad in the world, and no force can stop them. Like a secret told, they are beyond recall; and he must be blind indeed that does not see that a change is already beginning.</P>
<P>Nine millions of dead taxes is a serious thing; and this not only for bad, but in a great measure for foreign government. By putting the power of making war into the hands of foreigners who came for what they could get, little else was to be ex∣pected than what has happened.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="172"/>Reasons are already advanced in this work shew∣ing that whatever the reforms in the taxes may be, they ought to be made in the current expences of government, and not in the part applied to the interest of the national debt. By remitting the taxes of the poor, <HI>they</HI> will be totally relieved, and all discontent on their part will be taken away; and by striking off such of the taxes as are already men∣tioned, the nation will more than recover the whole expence of the mad American war.</P>
<P>There will then remain only the national debt as a subject of discontent; and in order to remove, or rather to prevent this, it would be good policy in the stock-holders themselves to consider it as property, subject like all other property, to bear some portion of the taxes. It would give to it both popularity and security, and as a great part of its present inconvenience is balanced by the ca∣pital which it keeps alive, a measure of this kind would so far add to that balance as to silence ob∣jections.</P>
<P>This may be done by such gradual means as to accomplish all that is necessary with the greatest ease and convenience.</P>
<P>Instead of taxing the capital, the best method would be to tax the interest by some progressive ratio, and to lessen the public taxes in the same proportion as the interest diminished.</P>
<P>Suppose the interest was taxed one halfpenny in the pound the first year, a penny more the second,
<PB N="160" REF="173"/> and to proceed by a certain ratio to be determined upon, always less than any other tax upon property. Such a tax would be subtracted from the interest at the time of payment, without any expence of col∣lection.</P>
<P>One halfpenny in the pound would lessen the interest and consequently the taxes, twenty thou∣sand pounds. The tax on waggons amounts to this sum, and this tax might be taken off the first year. The second year the tax on female servants, or some other of the like amount might also be taken off, and by proceeding in this manner, always ap∣plying the tax raised from the property of the debt towards its extinction, and not carry it to the cur∣rent services, it would liberate itself.</P>
<P>The stockholders, notwithstanding this tax, would pay less taxes than they do now. What they would save by the extinction of the poor-rates, and the tax on houses and windows, and the commutation tax, would be considerably greater than what this tax, slow, but certain in its operation, amounts to.</P>
<P>It appears to me to be prudence to look out for measures that may apply under any circumstance that may approach. There is, at this moment, a crisis in the affairs of Europe that requires it. Preparation now is wisdom. If taxation be once let loose, it will be difficult to re-instate it; neither would the relief be so effectual, as to proceed by some certain and gradual reduction.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="174"/>The fraud, hypocrisy, and imposition of govern∣ments, are now beginning to be too well under∣stood to promise them any long career. The farce of monarchy and aristocracy, in all countries, is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dres∣sing for the funeral. Let it then pass quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the mourners be comforted.</P>
<P>The time is not very distant when England will laugh at itself for sending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brunswick for men, at the expence of a million a year, who understood neither her laws, her language, nor her interest, and whose capaci∣ties would scarcely have fitted them for the office of a parish constable. If government could be trusted to such hands, it must be some easy and simple thing indeed, and materials fit for all the purposes may be found in every town and village in England.</P>
<P>When it shall be said in any country in the world, my poor are happy; neither ignorance nor distress is to be found among them; my jails are empty of prisoners, my streets of beggars; the aged are not in want, the taxes are not oppressive; the rational world is my friend, because I am the friend of its happiness: when these things can be said, then may that country boast its constitution and its government.</P>
<P>Within the space of a few years we have seen two Revolutions, those of America and France. In the former, the contest was long, and the conflict se∣vere;
<PB N="162" REF="175"/> in the latter, the nation acted with such a consolidated impulse, that having no foreign ene∣my to contend with, the revolution was complete in power the moment it appeared. From both those instances it is evident, that the greatest forces that can be brought into the field of revolutions, are reason and common interest. Where these can have the opportunity of acting, opposition dies with fear, or crumbles away by conviction. It is a great standing which they have now uni∣versally obtained; and we may hereafter hope to see revolutions, or changes in governments, pro∣duced with the same quiet operation by which any measure, determinable by reason and discussion, is accomplished.</P>
<P>When a nation changes its opinion and habits of thinking, it is no longer to be governed as before; but it would not only be wrong, but bad policy, to attempt by force what ought to be accomplished by reason. Rebellion consists in forcibly op∣posing the general will of a nation, whether by a party or by a government. There ought, there∣fore, to be in every nation a method of occasionally ascertaining the state of public opinion with respect to government. On this point the old govern∣ment of France was superior to the present go∣vernment of England, because, on extraordinary occasions, recourse could be had to what was then called the States General. But in England there are no such occasional bodies; and as to those who are now called Representatives, a great part of
<PB N="163" REF="176"/> them are mere machines of the court, placemen, and dependants.</P>
<P>I presume, that though all the people of Eng∣land pay taxes, not an hundredth part of them are electors, and the members of one of the houses of parliament represent nobody but themselves. There is, therefore, no power but the voluntary will of the people that has a right to act in any matter respecting a general reform; and by the same right that two persons can confer on such a subject, a thousand may. The object, in all such preliminary proceedings, is to find out what the general sense of a nation is, and to be governed by it. If it prefer a bad or defective government to a reform, or chuse to pay ten times more taxes than there is occasion for, it has a right so to do; and so long as the majority do not impose condi∣tions on the minority, different to what they im∣pose on themselves, though there may be much error, there is no injustice. Neither will the error continue long. Reason and discussion will soon bring things right, however wrong they may be∣gin. By such a process no tumult is to be appre∣hended. The poor, in all countries, are naturally both peaceable and grateful in all reforms in which their interest and happiness is included. It is only by neglecting and rejecting them that they become tumultuous.</P>
<P>The objects that now press on the public atten∣tion are, the French revolution, and the prospect of a general revolution in governments. Of all
<PB N="162" REF="177"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="163" REF="178"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="164" REF="179"/> nations in Europe, there is none so much interested in the French revolution as England. Enemies for ages, and that at a vast expence, and without any national object, the opportunity now presents itself of amicably closing the scene, and joining their efforts to reform the rest of Europe. By do∣ing this, they will not only prevent the further ef∣fusion of blood, and encrease of taxes, but be in a con∣dition of getting rid of a considerable part of their present burthens, as has been already stated. Long experience however has shewn, that reforms of this kind are not those which old governments wish to promote; and therefore it is to nations, and not to such governments, that these matters present themselves.</P>
<P>In the preceding part of this work, I have spoken of an alliance between England, France, and Ame∣rica, for purposes that were to be afterwards men∣tioned. Though I have no direct authority on the part of America, I have good reason to con∣clude, that she is disposed to enter into a consi∣deration of such a measure, provided, that the go∣vernments with which she might ally, acted as na∣tional governments, and not as courts enveloped in intrigue and mystery. That France as a na∣tion, and a national government, would prefer an alliance with England, is a matter of certainty. Nations, like individuals, who have long been enemies, without knowing each other, or knowing why, become the better friends when they discover
<PB N="165" REF="180"/> the errors and impositions under which they had acted.</P>
<P>Admitting, therefore, the probability of such a connection, I will state some matters by which such an alliance, together with that of Holland, might render service, not only to the parties immediately concerned, but to all Europe.</P>
<P>It is, I think, certain, that if the fleets of Eng∣land, France, and Holland were confederated, they could propose, with effect, a limitation to, and a general dismantling of all the navies in Europe, to a certain proportion to be agreed upon.</P>
<P>First, That no new ship of war shall be built by any power in Europe, themselves included.</P>
<P>Secondly, That all the navies now in existence shall be put back, suppose to one tenth of their present force. This will save to France and Eng∣land at least two millions sterling annually to each, and their relative force be in the same proportion as it is now. If men will permit themselves to think, as rational beings ought to think, nothing can appear more ridiculous and absurd, exclusive of all moral reflections, than to be at the expence of building navies, filling them with men, and then hauling them into the ocean, to try which can sink each other fastest. Peace, which costs nothing, is attended with infinitely more advan∣tage, than any victory with all its expence. But this, though it best answers the purpose of nations, does not that of court governments, whose habited policy is pretence for taxation, places, and offices.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="181"/>It is, I think, also certain, that the above con∣federated powers, together with that of the United States of America, can propose with effect, to Spain, the independance of South America, and the opening those countries of immense extent and wealth to the general commerce of the world, as North America now is.</P>
<P>With how much more glory, and advantage to itself, does a nation act, when it exerts its powers to rescue the world from bondage, and to create itself friends, than when it employs those powers to encrease ruin, desolation, and misery. The horrid scene that is now acting by the English go∣vernment in the East-Indies, is fit only to be told of Goths and Vandals, who, destitute of princi∣ciple, robbed and tortured the world they were incapable of enjoying.</P>
<P>The opening of South America would produce an immense field of commerce, and a ready money market for manufactures, which the eastern world does not. The East is already a country full of ma∣nufactures, the importation of which is not only an injury to the manufactures of England, but a drain upon its specie. The balance against England by this trade is regularly upwards of half a million annually sent out in the East-India ships in silver; and this is the reason, together with German in∣trigue, and German subsidies, there is so little silver in England.</P>
<P>But any war is harvest to such governments, how∣ever ruinous it may be to a nation. It serves to
<PB N="167" REF="182"/> keep up deceitful expectations which prevent a people looking into the defects and abuses of go∣vernment. It is the <HI>lo here!</HI> and the <HI>lo there!</HI> that amuses and cheats the multitude.</P>
<P>Never did so great an opportunity offer itself to England, and to all Europe, as is produced by the two Revolutions of America and France. By the former, freedom has a national champion in the Western world; and by the latter, in Europe. When another nation shall join France, despotism and bad government will scarcely dare to appear. To use a trite expression, the iron is becoming hot all over Europe. The insulted German and the enslaved Spaniard, the Russ and the Pole, are be∣ginning to think. The present age will hereafter merit to be called the Age of reason, and the pre∣sent generation will appear to the future as the Adam of a new world.</P>
<P>When all the governments of Europe shall be established on the representative system, nations will become acquainted, and the animosities and prejudices fomented by the intrigue and artifice of courts, will cease. The oppressed soldier will become a freeman; and the tortured sailor, no longer dragged along the streets like a felon, will pursue his mercantile voyage in safety. It would be better that nations should continue the pay of their soldiers during their lives, and give them their discharge and restore them to freedom and their friends, and cease recruiting, than retain such mul∣titudes at the same expence, in a condition useless
<PB N="168" REF="183"/> to society and themselves. As soldiers have hither∣to been treated in most countries, they might be said to be without a friend. Shunned by the citi∣zen on an apprehension of being enemies to liber∣ty, and too often insulted by those who com∣manded them, their condition was a double op∣pression. But where genuine principles of liberty pervade a people, every thing is restored to order; and the soldier civily treated, returns the civi∣lity.</P>
<P>In contemplating revolutions, it is easy to per∣ceive that they may arise from two distinct causes; the one, to avoid or get rid of some great calamity; the other, to obtain some great and positive good; and the two may be distinguished by the names of active and passive revolutions. In those which proceed from the former cause, the temper be∣comes incensed and sowered; and the redress, ob∣tained by danger, is too often sullied by revenge. But in those which proceed from the latter, the heart, rather animated than agitated, enters se∣renely upon the subject. Reason and discussion, persuasion and conviction, become the weapons in the contest, and it is only when those are attempted to be suppressed that recource is had to violence. When men unite in agreeing that a <HI>thing is good,</HI> could it be obtained, such as relief from a burden of taxes and the extinction of corruption, the ob∣ject is more than half accomplished. What they approve as the end, they will promote in the means.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="184"/>Will any man say, in the present excess of tax∣ation, falling so heavily on the poor, that a remis∣sion of five pounds annually of taxes to one hun∣dred and four thousand poor families is not a <HI>good thing?</HI> Will he say, that a remission of seven pounds annually to one hundred thousand other poor families—of eight pounds annually to another hundred thousand poor families, and of ten pounds annually to fifty thousand poor and widowed fami∣lies, are not <HI>good things?</HI> And to proceed a step farther in this climax, will he say, that to provide against the misfortunes to which all human life is subject, by securing six pounds annually for all poor, distressed, and reduced persons of the age of fifty and until sixty, and of ten pounds annually after sixty is not a <HI>good thing?</HI></P>
<P>Will he say, that an abolition of two million of poor-rates to the house-keepers, and of the whole of the house and window-light tax and of the com∣mutation tax is not a <HI>good thing?</HI> Or will he say, that to abolish corruption is a <HI>bad thing?</HI></P>
<P>If, therefore, the good to be obtained be worthy of a passive, rational, and costless revolution, it would be bad policy to prefer waiting for a cala∣mity that should force a violent one. I have no idea, considering the reforms which are now passing and spreading throughout Europe, that England will permit herself to be the last; and where the occasion and the opportunity quietly offer, it is better than to wait for a turbulent necessity. It may be considered as an honour to the animal facul∣ties
<PB N="170" REF="185"/> of man to obtain redress by courage and dan∣ger, but it is far greater honour to the rational fa∣culties to accomplish the same object by reason, accommodation, and general consent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know it is the opinion of many of the most enlightened characters in France (there always will be those who see farther into events than others) not only among the general mass of citi∣zens, but of many of the principal members of the former Na∣tional Assembly, that the monarchical plan will not continue many years in that country. They have found out, that as wis∣dom cannot be made hereditary, power ought not; and that, for a man to merit a million stirling a year from a nation, he ought to have a mind capable of comprehending from an atom to a universe; which, if he had, he would be above receiving the pay. But they wished not to appear to lead the nation faster than its own reason and interest dictated. In all the conversations where I have been present upon this subject, the idea always was, that when such a time, from the general opinion of the nation, shall arrive, that the honourable and liberal method would be, to make a handsome present in see simple to the person whoever he may be, that shall then be in the monarchical office, and for him to retire to the enjoyment of private life, possessing his share of ge∣neral rights and privileges, and to be no more accountable to the public for his time and his conduct than any other citizen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As reforms, or revolutions, call them which you please, extend themselves among nations, those nations will form connections and conventions, and when a few are thus confederated, the pro∣gress will be rapid, till despotism and corrupt go∣vernment be totally expelled, at least out of two quarters of the world, Europe and America. The Algerine piracy may then be commanded to cease, for it is only by the malicious policy of old go∣vernments, against each other, that it exists.</P>

<P>I have carefully avoided to enlarge upon the subject, because I am inclined to believe, that what is called the present ministry wish to see contentions about religion kept up, to prevent the nation turning its attention to subjects of govern∣ment. It is, as if they were to say, <Q>Look that way, or any way, but this.</Q></P>
<P>But as religion is very improperly made a poli∣tical machine, and the reality of it is thereby de∣stroyed, I will conclude this work with stating in what light religion appears to me.</P>
<P>If we suppose a large family of children, who, on any particular day, or particular circumstance, made it a custom to present to their parent some token of their affection and gratitude, each of them would make a different offering, and most proba∣bly in a different manner. Some would pay their congratulations in themes of verse or prose, by some little devices, as their genius dic∣tated, or according to what they thought would please; and, perhaps, the least of all, not able to do any of those things, would ramble into the garden, or the field, and gather what it thought the prettiest flower it could find, though, perhaps, it might be but a simple weed. The parent would be more gratified by such variety, than if the whole of
<PB N="172" REF="187"/> them had acted on a concerted plan, and each had made exactly the same offering. This would have the cold appearance of contrivance, or the harsh one of controul. But of all unwelcome things, nothing could more afflict the parent than to know, that the whole of them had afterwards gotten together by the ears, boys and girls, fight∣ing, scratching, reviling, and abusing each other about which was the best or the worst present.</P>
<P>Why may we not suppose, that the great Fa∣ther of all is pleased with variety of devotion; and that the greatest offence we can act, is that by which we seek to torment and render each other miserable. For my own part, I am fully satisfied that what I am now doing, with an endeavour to conciliate mankind, to render their condition hap∣py, to unite nations that have hitherto been ene∣mies, and to extirpate the horrid practice of war, and break the chains of slavery and oppression, is acceptable in his sight, and being the best service I can perform, I act it chearfully.</P>
<P>I do not believe that any two men, on what are called doctrinal points, think alike who think at all. It is only those who have not thought that appear to agree. It is in this case as with what is called the British constitution. It has been taken for granted to be good, and encomiums have sup∣plied the place of proof. But when the nation come to examine into its principles and the abuses it admits, it will be found to have more defects than I have pointed out in this work and the former.</P>
<P>As to what are called national religions, we
<PB N="173" REF="188"/> may, with as much propriety, talk of national Gods. It is either political craft or the remains of the Pagan system, when every nation had its sepa∣rate and particular deity. Among all the writers of the English church clergy, who have treated on the general subject of religion, the present Bishop of Landaff has not been excelled, and it is with much pleasure that I take the opportunity of ex∣pressing this token of respect.</P>
<P>I have now gone through the whole of the sub∣ject, at least, as far as it appears to me at present. It has been my intention for the five years I have been in Europe, to offer an address to the people of England on the subject of government, if the op∣portunity presented itself before I returned to Ame∣rica. Mr. Burke has thrown it in my way, and I thank him. On a certain occasion three years ago, I pressed him to propose a national convention to be fairly elected for the purpose of taking the state of the nation into consideration; but I found, that however strongly the parliamentary current was then setting against the party he acted with, their policy was to keep every thing within that field of corruption, and trust to accidents. Long ex∣perience had shewn that parliaments would follow any change of ministers, and on this they rested their hopes and their expectations.</P>
<P>Formerly, when divisions arose respecting go∣vernments, recourse was had to the sword, and a civil war ensued. That savage custom is exploded by the new system, and reference is had to national conventions. Discussion and the general will ar∣bitrates
<PB N="174" REF="189"/> the question, and to this, private opinion yields with a good grace, and order is preserved uninterrupted.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen have affected to call the prin∣ciples upon which this work and the former part of <HI>Rights of Man</HI> are founded, "a new fangled doc∣trine." The question is not whether those princi∣ples are new or old, but whether they are right or wrong. Suppose the former, I will shew their ef∣fect by a figure easily understood.</P>
<P>It is now towards the middle of February. Were I to take a turn into the country, the trees would present a leafless winterly appearance. As people are apt to pluck twigs as they walk along, I per∣haps might do the same, and by chance might ob∣serve, that a <HI>single bud</HI> on that twig had begun to swell. I should reason very unnaturally, or rather not reason at all, to suppose <HI>this</HI> was the <HI>only</HI> bud in England which had this appearance. Instead of deciding thus, I should instantly conclude, that the same appearance was beginning, or about to begin, every where; and though the vegetable sleep will continue longer on some trees and plants than on others, and though some of them may not <HI>blossom</HI> for two or three years, all will be in leaf in the summer, except those which are <HI>rotten.</HI> What pace the political summer may keep with the na∣tural, no human foresight can determine. It is, however, not difficult to perceive that the spring is begun.—Thus wishing, as I sincerely do, freedom and happiness to all nations, I close the</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>AS the publication of this work has been delayed be∣yond the time intended, I think it not improper, all circumstances considered, to state the causes that have oc∣casioned the delay.</P>
<P>The reader will probably observe, that some parts in the plan contained in this work for reducing the taxes, and certain parts in Mr. Pitt's speech at the opening of the present session, Tuesday, January 31, are so much alike, as to induce a belief, that either the Author had taken the hint from Mr. Pitt, or Mr. Pitt from the Author.—I will first point out the parts that are similar, and then state such cir∣cumstances as I am acquainted with, leaving the reader to make his own conclusion.</P>
<P>Considering it almost an unprecedented case, that taxes should be proposed to be taken off, it is equally as extraor∣dinary that such a measure should occur to two persons at the same time; and still more so, (considering the vast va∣riety and multiplicity of taxes) that they should hit on the same specific taxes. Mr. Pitt has mentioned, in his speech, the tax on <HI>Carts</HI> and <HI>Waggons</HI>—that on <HI>Female Servants</HI>— the lowering the tax on <HI>Candles,</HI> and the taking off the tax of three shillings on <HI>Houses</HI> having under seven windows.</P>
<P>Every one of those specific taxes are a part of the plan contained in this work, and proposed also to be taken off. Mr. Pitt's plan, it is true, goes no farther than to a reduc∣tion of three hundred and twenty thousand pounds; and the reduction proposed in this work to nearly six millions. I have made my calculations on only sixteen millions and an half of revenue, still asserting that it was <Q>very nearly, if not quite, seventeen millions.</Q> Mr. Pitt states it at 16,690,000. I know enough of the matter to say, that he has not <HI>over</HI>stated it. Having thus given the par∣ticulars, which correspond in this work and his speech, I will state a chain of circumstances that may lead to some explanation.</P>
<P>The first hint for lessening the taxes, and that as a con∣sequence flowing from the French revolution, is to be found in the ADDRESS and DECLARATION of the Gen∣tlemen who met at the Thatched-House Tavern, August 20, 1791. Among many other particulars stated in that Address, is the following, put as an interrogation to the
<PB N="176" REF="191"/> government opposers of the French Revolution. <Q>Art they sorry that the pretence for new oppressive taxes, and the occasion for continuing many old taxes will be at an end?</Q></P>
<P>It is well known, that the persons who chiefly frequent the Thatched House Tavern, are men of court connections, and so much did they take this Address and Declaration re∣specting the French revolution and the reduction of taxes in disgust, that the Landlord was under the necessity of in∣forming the Gentlemen, who composed the meeting of the twentieth of August, and who proposed holding another meeting, that he could not receive them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The gentleman who signed the address and declaration as chairman of the meeting, M. Horne Tooke, being generally sup∣posed to be the person who drew it up, and having spoken much in commendation of it, has been jocularly accused of praising his own work. To free him from this embarassment, and to save him the repeated trouble of mentioning the author, as he has not failed to do, I make no hesitation in saying, that as the oppor∣tunity of benefiting by the French Revolution easily occurred to me, I drew up the publication in question, and shewed it to him and some other gentlemen; who, fully approving it, held a meet∣ing for the purpose of making it public, and subscribed to the amount of fifty guineas to defray the expence of advertising. I believe there are at this time, in England, a greater number of men acting on disinterested principles, and determined to look into the nature and practices of government themselves, and not blindly trust, as has hitherto been the case, either to government generally, or to parliaments, or to parliamentary opposition, than at any former period. Had this been done a century ago, corruption and taxation had not arrived to the height they are now at.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>What was only hinted at in the Address and Declara∣tion, respecting taxes and principles of government, will be found reduced to a regular system in this work. But as Mr. Pitt's speech contains some of the same things respect∣ing taxes, I now come to give the circumstances before al∣luded to.</P>
<P>The case is: This work was intended to be published just before the meeting of Parliament, and for that purpose a considerable part of the copy was put into the printer's hands in September, and all the remaining copy, as far as page 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which contains the parts to which Mr. Pitt's speech is similar, was given to him full six weeks before the meeting of parliament, and he was informed of the time at which it was to appear. He had composed nearly the
<PB N="177" REF="192"/> whole about a fortnight before the time of Parliament meeting, and had printed as far as page 112, and had given me a proof of the next sheet, up to page 128. It was then in sufficient forwardness to be out at the time proposed, as two other sheets were ready for striking off. I had before told him, that if he thought he should be straightened for time, I would get part of the work done at another press, which he desired me not to do. In this manner the work stood on the Tuesday fortnight preceding the meet∣ing of Parliament, when all at once, without any previous intimation, though I had been with him the evening before, he sent me, by one of his workmen, all the remaining copy, from page 112, declining to go on with the work <HI>on any consideration.</HI></P>
<P>To account for this extraordinary conduct I was totally at a loss, as he stopped at the part where the arguments on systems and principles of government closed, and where the plan for the reduction of taxes, the education of children, and the support of the poor and the aged begins; and still more especially, as he had, at the time of his beginning to print, and before he had seen the whole copy, offered a thou∣sand pounds for the copy-right, together with the future copy-right of the former part of the Rights of Man. I told the person who brought me this offer that I should not accept it, and wished it not to be renewed, giving him as my reason, that though I believed the printer to be an honest man, I would never put it in the power of any printer or publisher to suppress or alter a work of mine, by making him master of the copy, or give to him the right of selling it to any minister, or to any other person, or to treat as a mere matter of traffic, that which I intended should operate as a principle.</P>
<P>His refusal to complete the work (which he could not purchase) obliged me to seek for another printer, and this of consequence would throw the publication back till after the meeting of Parliament, otherways it would have ap∣peared that Mr. Pitt had only taken up a part of the plan which I had more fully stated.</P>
<P>Whether that gentleman, or any other, had seen the work, or any part of it, is more than I have authority to say. But the manner in which the work was returned, and the particular time at which this was done, and that after the offers he had made, are suspicious circumstances. I know what the opinion of booksellers and publishers is upon such a case, but as to my own opinion, I chuse to make no declara∣tion.
<PB N="178" REF="193"/> There are many ways by which proof sheets may be procured by other persons before a work publicly appear; to which I shall add a certain circumstance, which is,</P>
<P>A ministerial bookseller in Piccadilly who has been em¦ployed, as common report says, by a clerk of one of the boards closely connected with the ministry (the board of trade and plantation of which Hawksbury is president) to publish what he calls my Life (I wish his own life and that thsoe of the cabinet were as good) used to have his books printed at the same printing-office that I employed; but when the former part of <HI>Rights of Man</HI> came out, he took his work away in dudgeon; and about a week or ten days before the printer returned my copy, he came to make him an offer of his work again, which was accepted. This would consequently give him admission into the printing-office where the sheets of this work were then lying; and as booksellers and printers are free with each other, he would have the opportunity of seeing what was going on. —Be the case however as it may, Mr. Pitt's plan, little and diminutive as it is, would have had a very awkward ap∣pearance, had this work appeared at the time the printer had engaged to finish it.</P>
<P>I have now stated the particulars which occasioned the delay, from the proposal to purchase, to the refusal to print. If all the Gentlemen are innocent, it is very unfortunate for them that such a variety of suspicious circumstances should without any design, arrange themselves together.</P>
<P>Having now finished this part, I will conclude with stat∣ing another circumstance.</P>
<P>About a fortnight or three weeks before the meeting of Parliament, a small addition, amounting to about twelve shillings and six pence a year, was made to the pay of the soldiers, or rather, their pay was docked so much less. Some Gentlemen who knew, in part, that this work would contain a plan of reforms respecting the oppressed condition of soldiers, wished me to add a note to the work, signify∣ing, that the part upon that subject had been in the printer's hands some weeks before that addition of pay was proposed. I declined doing this, lest it should be interpreted into an air of vanity, or an endeavour to excite sus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icion (for which, perhaps, there might be no grounds) that some of the government gentlemen, had, by some means or other, made out what this work would contain: and had not the printing been interrupted so as to occasion a delay beyond the time fixed for publication, nothing contained in this appendix would have appeared.</P>
