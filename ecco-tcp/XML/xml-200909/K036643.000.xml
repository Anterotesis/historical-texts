<HEAD>CRAIGMILLAR CASTLE, AN ELEGY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WROTE IN SEPTEMBER M,DCC,LXXV.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Sun, declining o'er the western sky,</L>
<L>In roseat splendor clos'd his circling course,</L>
<L>And ting'd the clouds with many a varied dye,</L>
<L>When, following Fancy's ever-flowing source</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of cool poetic joy, I bent my way</L>
<L>Tow'rd a majestic Castle's ruins wide;</L>
<L>Within whose gates once royalty bore sway,</L>
<L>And for a season laid its cares aside.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The bleating flocks were pent within the fold;</L>
<L>The jovial reapers long had left the vale;</L>
<L>The plowman at his cheary fire-side told</L>
<L>The merry story, or the mournful tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<L>Now SOL had gone to other worlds to rise,</L>
<L>And all the place to silence was resign'd;</L>
<L>While on the ruin fixed were my eyes,</L>
<L>A pleasing melancholy fill'd my mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Comparing present things with past, a tear</L>
<L>Starting from either eye down gently stole;</L>
<L>Tho' from my heart wrung by reflection drear,</L>
<L>A tear which pity wish'd not to control!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While yielding thus to lenient grief, I deem'd</L>
<L>A rushing noise I heard, and looking round,</L>
<L>A sudden light effulgent on me beam'd,</L>
<L>And all my soul in admiration bound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Upon the hill descended from on high,</L>
<L>A BEING far transcending human kind:</L>
<L>I gaz'd upon him as he glided nigh,</L>
<L>His form engaging all my pensive mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An azure robe, of a celestial dye,</L>
<L>Around him wildly wanton'd in the breeze:</L>
<L>Bare were his feet; his looks did seem to vye</L>
<L>With new-fall'n snow that tips the aged trees.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Placid and mild his look, yet conscious seem'd</L>
<L>Of majesty, and piercing was his eye,</L>
<L>That flashing with a heav'nly ardor gleam'd,</L>
<L>As form'd with ease to scan earth, sea, and sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<L>His decent footstops with a silver wand</L>
<L>Were guided, as majestically slow</L>
<L>Tow'rd me he calm advanc'd, and took his stand</L>
<L>Beside me, lost in Pity's balmy woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"AH, mortal! (said he) thou art mov'd in vain</L>
<L>"To see all human grandeur yield to Fate,</L>
<L>"When from its fall thou shouldst essay to gain</L>
<L>"Instruction, not bewail its fallen state.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"'Tis my delight, at fall of dewy eve,</L>
<L>"To visit and converse with mortals good,</L>
<L>"My heav'nly dictates who with joy receive</L>
<L>"In the low cot, or 'mid the shady wood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The vain magnificence of man may prove</L>
<L>"My present mournfully instructive theme,</L>
<L>"Whose fate observ'd, might ev'n the proudest move</L>
<L>"To own all earthly pomp a fleeting dream."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, while he spoke, I recogniz'd the pow'r</L>
<L>Of CONTEMPLATION, radiant son of Truth;</L>
<L>When empty joys invite, or sorrows lowr,</L>
<L>The comforter of age, the guide of youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For often he my lone sequester'd cot</L>
<L>Had deign'd to visit, where he taught my soul</L>
<L>Tranquilly to enjoy life's chequer'd lot,</L>
<L>And each impetuous passion to control.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<L>"Behold (he thus resum'd) yon turrets high,</L>
<L>"The once proud ornaments of that strong tow'r;</L>
<L>"Now rent and shatter'd by th' inclement sky,</L>
<L>"Scarce rests the vestige of their former pow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Th' approaching foe by no portcullis dire,</L>
<L>"Nor bar of massy iron, nor steady gate,</L>
<L>"Would now be forc'd disdainful to retire,</L>
<L>"And leave a strength unworthy of his hate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Upon this moat, once as a sea profound,</L>
<L>"Which erst no daring footstep ever trode,</L>
<L>"The wanton infant now may sportive bound,</L>
<L>"And harmless lambs chuse a secure abode.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The room where arms in horrid order plac'd</L>
<L>"A glimmering light reflected to the eye,</L>
<L>"Is now with instruments of labour grac'd;</L>
<L>"There sword to sickle chang'd thou may'st descry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"That chamber, where the Queen, whose charms divine</L>
<L>"Made wond'ring nations own the pow'r of love,</L>
<L>"Oft bath'd her snowy limbs in sparkling wine,</L>
<L>"Now proves a lonely refuge for the dove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Yon hall capacious, where the flowing bowl</L>
<L>"Inspir'd convivial mirth, unblam'dly free,</L>
<L>"Unfolded all the secrets of the soul,</L>
<L>"And whelm'd each care in heart-enliv'ning glee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
<L>"Where the love-kindling lute, and sounding lyre,</L>
<L>"Rapt all the mind, or in soft pleasure drown'd;</L>
<L>"Where the hoarse trumpet rouzing martial fire,</L>
<L>"Made vaulted roof and rocky walls resound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"There sullen silence reigns, and there the owl</L>
<L>"Makes her abode that loves the gloomy night;</L>
<L>"Thence not the least noise rises, save the howl</L>
<L>"Of bats, and beasts obscene that shun the light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Yon mould'ring chapel, which in days of yore</L>
<L>"To some romantic saint was sacred made,</L>
<L>"Where th' early priest his matins murmur'd o'er,</L>
<L>"And said his numerous masses for the dead;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"There now each noxious animal and weed</L>
<L>"In baleful darkness dwells: And where the cross</L>
<L>"Was plac'd, the henbane spreads a deadly shade;</L>
<L>"And the foul toad conceal'd lyes in the moss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"See o'er the place deep melancholy reigns</L>
<L>"Where splendor once diffus'd its brightest day;</L>
<L>"And of a palace ev'n these poor remains</L>
<L>"Will soon to nameless ruin drop a prey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Such fate awaits all sublunary things,</L>
<L>"Save those that rest on VIRTUE'S firm support;</L>
<L>"She aid alone 'gainst Time's fell ravage brings,</L>
<L>"And smiles secure at Fortune's cruel sport."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<L>Thus while he spoke, his robe expanding wide,</L>
<L>Majestic as a cherub still he stood;</L>
<L>Then thro' the liquid air was seen to glide,</L>
<L>And, swift ascending, gain'd his blest abode.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I silent turning from the eastern seas</L>
<L>Behold the full-orb'd moon refulgent rise;</L>
<L>No fluttering zephyr fans the yellow trees,</L>
<L>Each breathe in gentle cadence softly dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The strepent horn no more the hills rebound,</L>
<L>But all the air is wrapt in stillness mild,</L>
<L>Save where the far-off curfeu's solemn sound</L>
<L>Steals on the ear, melodiously wild!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair CYNTHIA'S ray, swift-gliding as she rose,</L>
<L>First mark'd the place where a proud vessel lay,</L>
<L>Which in the lulling calm seem'd to repose,</L>
<L>While not a gale its slagging sails did sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then slow that tow'ring hill to view disclos'd,</L>
<L>At whose wide base a princely palace stands;</L>
<L>And by it, to each ruthless storm expos'd,</L>
<L>A sacred ruin;—shame of modern hands!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sure SCOTIA'S kings august, and heroes brave,</L>
<L>Claim the most splendid honours of the tomb;</L>
<L>To them their country who but liv'd to save,</L>
<L>No longer be deny'd the grateful dome!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
<L>Soon all EDINA'S glories rose to sight,</L>
<L>Her lofty spires, her castle proudly strong;</L>
<L>The distant <HI>Forth</HI> reflecting the pale light,</L>
<L>As slow he flow'd the laughing fields among.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Autumn her golden mantle o'er the land</L>
<L>Had cast; each sound was hush'd in silence still,</L>
<L>Save where the rivulet murmur'd thro' the sand;</L>
<L>The snowey moon-light sleep'd on every hill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A scene so sweetly solemn Fancy's eye</L>
<L>Survey'd with rapture and tranquil delight;</L>
<L>But while she softly breath'd a parting sigh,</L>
<L>Resign'd its beauties to the silent night.</L>
