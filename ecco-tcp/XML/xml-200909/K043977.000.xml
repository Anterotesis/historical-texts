<P>THE following lines were lately wrote in a fit of illness, without any in∣tention of ever troubling the public with them; but some very incorrect copies having been dis∣pers'd,
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>unknown to the author occasion'd this edition.</P>
<P>The writer has look'd on lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too long, and suffer'd too much in it, to be anxious for the even of these rhymes: they were wrote neither for profit, nor re∣putation; if he gets either by them, its more than he expected or if he offends, its what h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never design'd.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION. A RHAPSODY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BRIGHT emanation of all right'ous power,</L>
<L>Religion! bear me to thy sacred bower;</L>
<L>Where fix'd in faith, by holy patience bless'd,</L>
<L>Calm resignation yields the wretched rest;</L>
<L>Where hope divine to penitence is given,</L>
<L>Beams in each breast, and lists the soul to heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> sons of shew, ye unreflecting gay,</L>
<L>Time-trifling youth, the splendors of a day;</L>
<L>Who lightly bounding o'er life's surface skim,</L>
<L>Monarchs of mode, and worshippers of whim.</L>
<L>Thus, thro' the air, the wing-poiz'd warbler sings;</L>
<L>Wanton thus flies, display their painted wings:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5"/>So struts the fowl, with eye-bespangled train,</L>
<L>Like <HI>you</HI> self pleas'd; as pretty, and— as vain.</L>
<L>The time must come when dress and dancing's o'er,</L>
<L>And your frail forms can play the fool no more:</L>
<L>E'er 'tis too late, look with religious eyes;</L>
<L>Think, think, ye faulty, and be timely wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Ye</HI> tender, lovely, love-inspiring race,</L>
<L>Whose words are music, and whose motion grace;</L>
<L>Whose soft endearing looks insidious play,</L>
<L>Feast the fond eye, and snatch the soul away.</L>
<L>Ye laughing sex, who vainly wanton, rove</L>
<L>Thro' the Elysium of unbounded love:</L>
<L>Tho' round enamour'd crouds observant sigh,</L>
<L>Watch the soft smile, and catch the glancing eye;</L>
<L>Still must you lose this sense-ensnaring form,</L>
<L>And what now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeds your lover, feast a worm.</L>
<L>Yet, yet, ye conscious beauty-beaming train,</L>
<L>A moment think; then, if ye dare,—be vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
<L><HI>Dispassion'd race!</HI> ye wealthy slaves of care,</L>
<L>Whose cheeks ne'er felt the trickling, tender tear;</L>
<L>Whose breasts ne'er heav'd with sympathetic sigh;</L>
<L>Whose hearts ne'er open'd to the asking eye.</L>
<L><HI>Ye sons of trade,</HI> ye busy tasteless train,</L>
<L>Whose God is gold, and whose religion gain;</L>
<L>Your greedy minds, to social joys unknown,</L>
<L>In one, dull, drudging round, rowl restless on.</L>
<L>Can you expect a charity from Heav'n?</L>
<L>Shall you! ye stubborn hearted, be forgiv'n?</L>
<L>Fruitless your sighs, repentant, will appear;</L>
<L>You'll want that mercy you derided here;</L>
<L>Unmov'd the Godhead will your sorrows view,</L>
<L>As weeping want, on earth, was seen by you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Star-lustred breasts, ye court-delectant race,</L>
<L>Ye souls of honour, and ye sons of place,</L>
<L>Big with each blessing that attends a throne,</L>
<L>On the low wealthless look contemptuous down:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>Yet, spite of pride, the statesman and the slave.</L>
<L>Rise, undistinguish'd, from the equal grave.—</L>
<L>Go search within for all ennobled earth;</L>
<L>Go teach the tomb-bred worm respect to birth</L>
<L>Correct his feeding, and refine his taste:</L>
<L>Alas!—</L>
<L>Courtiers and clowns compose alike his feast</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What will avail the di'monds sparkling blaz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>The glare of titles, or the vulgar's gaze,</L>
<L>When worn-out nature panting gasps for breath</L>
<L>And friends fly, frighted, from the face of dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></L>
<L>"To the sad sense what then can give content"</L>
<L>"The sweet reflection of a life well spent."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Calm each great soul quits his clay-cumb'rous.</L>
<L>Springs to the skies, and humbly waits his Go.</L>
<L>While the low wretch, by crime rais'd wealth-g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> great,</L>
<L>Starts at life's loss; and, frightful, meets his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="8"/>Wide-op'ning, wild he rowls his ghastful eyes:</L>
<L>He shakes; he shrinks; and, agonizing, cries,</L>
<L>"Have mercy, Heav'n!—Can I its mercy share?</L>
<L>"See! grief-stab'd merit opes its bosom there:</L>
<L>"Hear, from the grave, the plaintive orphan's groan</L>
<L>"Bursts sorrowing forth, and strikes the heav'nly "throne.</L>
<L>"Hark! the lust-ruin'd fair extends her cries,</L>
<L>"And the sound shakes along the trembling skies"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What shall we say in that great day of dread,</L>
<L>When the rent graves shall render back their dead?</L>
<L>When, at the trumpet's sound, the clouds give way,</L>
<L>And the world blazes in eternal day?</L>
<L>There the fierce tyrant feels th' avenging rod,</L>
<L>And pride sinks trembling at the sight of God;</L>
<L>There suff'ring virtue happiness receives;</L>
<L>There the fool'd atheist, tho' too late, believes:</L>
<L>The poor lost sinner hears th' eternal doom;</L>
<L>And, woe appall'd, clings shudd'ring to his tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
<L>Bring, ye bright fair, your love-attending crow</L>
<L>Command your slain, ye heroes, from their shro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></L>
<L>Ye prime in state display your deepest schemes;</L>
<L>And, ye nice wits, your fancy-forming dreams;</L>
<L>Try, try, ye proud, in that tremendous hour,</L>
<L>The skill of science, or the strength of pow'r,</L>
<L>Self-pleasing wisdom, the renown of birth,</L>
<L>All, all the vis'onary joys of earth;</L>
<L>Lay them before the universal Lord;</L>
<L>Go, plead your merits, and revoke his word.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sooner shall shadows stop the light'ning's blaze</L>
<L>Or gloworms dim the sun's refulgent rays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But chiefly you to whom the word was giv'n</L>
<L>Soul-saving sect, ye delegates of Heav'n;</L>
<L>Whose pious toils dispel the sinner's fear,</L>
<L>Stop the throb'd sigh, and dry confession's fear.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="10"/>Thus, but unpension'd, th' apostles went</L>
<L>On foot, coarse clad, with homely fare content,</L>
<L>Declar'd the dictates of th' almighty Lord,</L>
<L>But prov'd no doctrine by the dint of sword.</L>
<L>Love, justice, faith, humility they press'd,</L>
<L>Yet threaten'd no damnation to the rest.</L>
<L>Plain and unsully'd, like the simple maid,</L>
<L>Religion bloom'd, by int'rest unallay'd:</L>
<L>Leal truly servent, penitence sincere,</L>
<L>Bill'd the wrap'd soul, and spoke the heart-selt pray'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then social bliss descended from above,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pread thro' each sex, and ripen'd into love:</L>
