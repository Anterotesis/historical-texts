<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE dinner-hour of persons of fashion having almost jostled the supper-hour of our an∣cestors out of its place, the first act of a play is either very thinly attended, or considerably inter∣rupted by the clattering of box-doors and seats, while the house is filling; for which reason it has been thought necessary, of late years, at the Hay-Market Theatre, to perform a short piece previous to that which is meant as the principal attraction: those already upon the acting list having been some time in use, Mr. Colman (then junior) desi∣red me to point out such as might occur, suitable to the purpose. I mentioned <HI>The Fatal Extrava∣gance,</HI> written by Joseph Mitchell; (<HI>Vide</HI> BIOGRA∣PHIA DRAMATICA, 1782, <HI>V. II. P.</HI> 119.) which, on looking over it, he was pleased to approve of; ex∣cepting that he thought the catastrophe too tragick for a petite-piece. I, therefore, made such altera∣tions in it as he conceived to be wanting; in doing which, I availed myself of his very judicious ad∣vice, and adopted several energetick expressions,
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>dropt, during the rehearsals, from his mouth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pen.</P>
<P>The concluding lines, <Q>"Hence may the Gamester learn, ere yet too late," &amp;c.</Q> are entirely Mr. Colman's.</P>
<P>I wish I could particularize every word suggest∣ed by him; for tho' I have not, as Ben. Jonson, to our loss, too-scrupulously did (as it is supposed) by Shakspeare, <HI>"rather chosen to put weaker (and no doubt lesse pleasing) of mine own,"</HI> yet would I not <HI>"defraud so happy a Genius of his right, by my lothed usurpation."</HI> See Jonson's Address <HI>"To the Readers."</HI> prefixed to the 4to edit. of his <HI>"Sejanus."</HI> 1605.</P>
<P>The piece, as altered and called <HI>The Prodigal,</HI> has been excellently performed twelve times at Mr. Colman's Theatre, with distinguished appro∣bation; some of the passages, now printed, were omitted in the reprefentation: but, what would have been thought tedious and heavy on the stage, it is hoped will not be found so in the closet.</P>

<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>'TWAS kind! this speed of your return.—But, tell me,</L>
<L>What success had you? was my father mov'd?</L>
<L>Methinks I read your news in your sad visage,</L>
<L>And my heart trembles with prophetic fears.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas as I judg'd 't would be—His own wants press him;</L>
<L>He sinks beneath your husband's wasteful life;</L>
<L>Those boundless dicings, and voluptuous riots,</L>
<L>Which have at once dissolv'd a wealth so vast,</L>
<L>That Pity scarce vouchsafes to heed his sufferings.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>But his late conduct proves my Bellmour chang'd;</L>
<L>Misfortunes have instructed him to think,</L>
<L>And thought has captiv'd every madding passion.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet early vice, by custom long indulg'd,</L>
<L>Leaves such impression of habitual ill,</L>
<L>As finds no cure, but from severe remorse,</L>
<L>And Time's slow working.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay, name not Bellmour's vice;—</L>
<L>He has no vice;—his every power is lost,</L>
<L>Even had he taste for follies:—poor and despis'd,</L>
<L>The slaves, for whose curs'd sakes he stands re∣proach'd,</L>
<L>Now shun his converse. Villains, who betray'd,</L>
<L>Start when they meet him. Poverty, like his,</L>
<L>Spreads a contagion round it, and mankind</L>
<L>Fly frighted from him. What will become of us!</L>
<L>Did you lay open our incumbent ruin?</L>
<L>Urg'd you my father strongly? Want's cold hand</L>
<L>Creeps o'er us, and 'tis now no time for counsel.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>I told him all, and mov'd his utmost pity.</L>
<L>Still, as he set to view your husband's failings,</L>
<L>I urg'd his virtues, and bore down the balance;</L>
<L>I prais'd his wit, his courage, his humanity,</L>
<L>His fine frank spirit, and his generous nature:</L>
<L>He answer'd, and I firmly think with truth,</L>
<L>What he has done, already, weighs him down;</L>
<L>His struggling will to save you has undone him,</L>
<L>And Bellmour's self would there beg aid in vain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! he was never born to be a beggar!</L>
<L>Heav'n is too kind to goodness, to forsake him!</L>
<L>He, whom soft Pity melts at others' misery,</L>
<L>Deserves, himself, to live exempt from woe.</L>
<L>Bellmour could ne'er behold a stranger wretched,</L>
<L>But he partook his pain, 'till he could ease it.</L>
<L>How, then, will he support the weeping anguish</L>
<L>Of three poor children, all undone by him!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>His good, and ill, so chequer out his nature,</L>
<L>That, which excels is doubtful. Nobly will'd,</L>
<L>His pitying heart flows out in generous purposes;</L>
<L>But, wanting power to stem the tide of pleasure,</L>
<L>Irresolute he drives, and floats to ruin.</L>
<L>Men must be rigid, and severe, in virtue!</L>
<L>Serious and noble aims distinguish reason!</L>
<L>To live for luxury is not to live.</L>
<L>The man of pleasure dreams away his days,</L>
<L>And dies, to be forgotten. Bellmour's soul,</L>
<L>Had contemplation bent it to a bias,</L>
<L>Had given a point to Fame's proud pinnacle,</L>
<L>And purpled o'er his name with deathless glory!</L>
<L>Now, it lies lost in dust!—contemn'd, despis'd!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! I shall tremble to behold his face!—</L>
<L>His ruin'd family hangs on his heart;</L>
<L>His helpless children's future fate distracts him;</L>
<L>For, the once-lively Bellmour smiles no more!</L>
<L>Silent he walks, or stands, with folded arms;</L>
<L>And still looks down, as if his soul were earth.</L>
<L>If e'er, by chance, his lifted eyes meet mine,</L>
<L>The starting tears glare dreadfully upon me,</L>
<L>And, quivering, struggle to flow loose in sorrow.</L>
<L>Then sighs, suppress'd by force, strive hard for vent.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="9"/>And heave, and swell, like earthquakes in his bosom.</L>
<L>Groaning, at length, he breaks in whirlwind from me;</L>
<L>Torn by ten thousand pangs, raves, reddens, starts,</L>
<L>And frights me with a dreadful burst of passions!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTNEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Poor, suffering innocent! I would 'twere mine</L>
<L>To screen you from the storm that's gath'ring round;</L>
<L>But I, unbless'd with power, can only wish,</L>
<L>And hope some chance will save you from de∣struction.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, uncle! what remains for Hope to snatch at?</L>
<L>Of all the wide estate, that late was ours,</L>
<L>But this poor house is left us;—this, too, totters.</L>
<L>Soon, Ruin, with his palsied hand, will seize</L>
<L>This ancient pile, and shake it into dust!</L>
<L>Not thrice the worth of all that now is ours</L>
<L>Will save poor Woodly from that fatal bond,</L>
<L>He sign'd to save my Bellmour.—All our hope</L>
<L>Was in your friendly journey to my father;</L>
<L>Woodly must sink, and Bellmour cannot bear it.</L>
<L>Bellmour will never live to sink a friend!—</L>
<L>Look yonder, where, in pensive grief, he walks</L>
<L>Unhoping, and disconsolate!</L>

<L>Why, my Louisa! 'tis a wretch's duty</L>
<L>To learn to bear his misery;—to know it,</L>

<L>To make it easy to us.—Yet, I'm to blame!</L>
<L>Thou had'st no share in any guilt of mine;</L>

<L>So, Sir! I find you make your house your Gar∣rison!</L>

<L>I sent not for you</L>

<L>From which a week's short respite may, perhaps,</L>
<L>Free Woodly, and myself, nor do you wrong.</L>

<L>Oh, Sir!—no doubt; 'tis likely that seven days</L>
<L>Will pay a Bond, which twice seven months, and more,</L>
<L>Have drawn no interest for!—Woodly may claim</L>
<L>Some little pity.—He's a suffering tool,</L>
<L>Who fasts to feed your riots. But, for you,</L>
<L>No plea bears influence. What a mass of wealth</L>
<L>Loaded your youth! the toil of careful Ancestors!</L>
<L>And how it is consum'd, let thousands tell,</L>
<L>Whose lifted eyes and hands proclaim their won∣der:</L>
<L>I dare not whisper it.—Men would think me mad;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="19"/>And laugh to hear, that the once-liberal Bellmour</L>

<L>It grates my inmost soul to suffer this,</L>

<L>Death is too hasty!—I have yet undone,</L>

<L>O, heaven! my little ones!—let me fly to them!</L>

<L>What shall I do?—O, bring my children hither;</L>

<L>Nor to thy other crimes add Suicide!</L>
<L>He, thou thought'st slain by thy revengeful arm,</L>

<L>Nor are your wife and childen sacrificed.</L>
<L>The hand of Heaven (howe'er, from mortal eyes</L>
<L>Obscur'd in clouds, it seems severe) is merciful!</L>

<L>Then, trembling, mark the mazy paths of Provi∣dence!</L>
<L>Fearing, from late events, some dire mishap,</L>
<L>I trac'd your footsteps, as you sadly rang'd</L>
<L>The lonely Gallery; spied a late-fill'd Cup</L>
<L>Of deadly poison, (known by the vessel left,</L>
<L>Which had contain'd it) mingled with a rich draught,</L>
<L>For present use: I took it, secret, thence;</L>
<L>Refill'd the Cup with Cordials that remain'd,</L>
<L>Without the baneful mixture; stood conceal'd</L>
<L>To view what then might hap: Louisa came,</L>
<L>And snatch'd it thence; I follow'd her, unmark'd,</L>
<L>O'erjoy'd to have been the means to intercept</L>
<L>Her and her children's death.</L>

<L>Woodly has heard, tho' mournful, happy news.</L>
<L>Your absent Brother, many years thought dead,</L>
