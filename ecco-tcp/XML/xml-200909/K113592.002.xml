<HEAD>CHAP. I. From the Death of SOCRATES to the Death of
EPAMINONDAS.</HEAD>
<P>HITHER TO we have pursued the Athe∣nians, both in their
successes and their defeats, with peculiar attention: while they took the
lead in the affairs of Greece, it was necessary to place them on the fore
ground of the picture; but now we must change the scene; and, leaving the
Athenians acting an obscure part, go to those states who
successively took the lead after their downfal.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/> Sparta seems to be the first state now that
gave laws to the rest of the Greeks; their old jealousies began to revive
against the petty states that had formerly sided against them: and the
Eleans were the first upon whom they fell, under a pretence that they were
not ad∣mitted by that state to the Olympic games as well as the rest of the
Grecians. Having for∣merly declared war, and being upon the point of plundering
the city of Elis, they were taken into the alliance of Sparta, and the
conquerors now assumed and enjoyed the title of the Protectors and
Arbitrators of Greece. Soon after, Age∣silaus, who was chosen king of
Sparta, was sent into Asia with an army, under pretence of freeing the
Grecian cities: he gained a signal victory over Tissaphernes, near the
river Pactolus, where he forced the enemy's camp, and found considerable
plunder. This success induced the Persian monarch, instead of meet∣ing
Agesilaus openly in the field, to subvert his interest among the Grecian
states by the power of bribery; and indeed this confede∣racy was now so
weakened, its concord and unanimity so totally destroyed, that they were
open to every offer: the love of money was now rooted in their affections; and
the Spar∣tans were the only people that, for a while, <PB N="3" REF="5"/>
seemed to disdain it: but the contagion still spreading, even they, at
last, yielded to its al∣lurements; and every man sought private emo∣lument,
without attending to the good of his country.</P>
<P>The Thebans, as they were the first gained over to the Persian
interest, so they were the most active in promoting it. To strengthen
their alliance, they sent ambassadors to the Athe∣nians, with a long
representation of the present posture of affairs, wherein they artfully
insinua∣ted their zeal and affection to their state; from thence they took
occasion to inveigh against the tyranny of Sparta; and concluded with
telling them, that now was the time to throw off the yoke, and to recover their
former splen∣dor and authority. The Athenians, though they had no share of
the Persian money, needed not many arguments to engage them in a rupture of
this kind, for which they had been long waiting a fit opportunity.</P>
<P>Agesilaus, who had carried on the war in Persia with
success, received news of the war being again broke out in Greece, with
orders, at the same time, for him to return home. He had set his heart upon
the entire conquest of Per∣sia, and was preparing to march farther into the
country; but such was his deference to the laws, <PB N="4" REF="6"/> and
such his submission to the Ephori, that he instantly obeyed their
mandate; but left four thousand men in Asia to maintain his successes
there. The Spartans, however, could not wait his arrival; they found
confederacies thicken on their hands, and they were ready to be at∣tacked on
all sides. The Athenians, Argives, Thebans, Corinthians, and Eubaeans joined
against them, and made up a body of twenty-four thousand men; both sides
encamped near Sicyon, at a small distance from each other; and soon came
to a regular engagement. The Spartan allies at first were entirely routed;
but the Spartans themselves turned the scale of victory by their single
valour, and came off conquerors with the loss of but eight men. This victory,
however, was in some measure overbalanced by a loss at sea, which the
Spartans sustained near Cnidus. Conon, the Athenian General, being
appointed to com∣mand the Persian fleet against them, took fifty of their
ships, and pursued the rest into port. Agesilaus, on the other hand,
gained a considerable victory over the Athenians and their allies upon the
plains of Coronea. Thus was the war continued by furious but unde∣cisive
engagements, in which neither side was a gainer; and in this manner did the
Spartans <PB N="5" REF="7"/> maintain themselves and their allies, without any
considerable increase or diminution of their power. In this general
shock, the Athenians seemed for a while to recover their former spi∣rit;
being assisted by Persian money, and con∣ducted by Conon, an excellent
general, they took the field with ardour, and even rebuilt the walls of their
city. From the mutual jealou∣sies of these petty states among each other,
all were weakened, and the Persian monarch be∣came arbitrator of Greece. In
this manner, after a fluctuation of successes and intrigues, all par∣ties
began to grow tired of a war, and a peace ensued: this peace was concluded in
the second year of the 98th Olympiad; and from the many stipulations in
favour of Persia, Plutarch terms it, The reproach and ruin of Greece.</P>
<P>The Spartans, thus freed from the terrors of a powerful foreign
enemy, went on to spread terror among the petty states of Greece: they gave
peremptory orders to the Mantineans to throw down their walls, and compelled
them to obedience. They obliged the Corinthians to withdraw the garrison from
Argosi; and some other little states they treated with an air of
superiority that plainly marked, that they expected obedience. They marched
against the Olynthians, who had lately grown <PB N="6" REF="8"/> into power,
and effectually subdued them. They interposed also in a domestic
quarrel which was carried on at Thebes. Phaebidas having seized upon the
citadel, they turned him out, and placed a garrison of their own in that
fortress. They then procured arti∣cles to be exhibited against Ismenias
his an∣tagonist, for having taken money of the Per∣sians, and holding
intelligence with them; and for having been a principal promoter of their
intestine broils: upon which he underwent a formal trial before the
commissioners de∣puted from Sparta; and one from each of the other great
cities of Greece, and was condemn∣ed to death. Thus, having secured Thebes,
and having by a tedious war humbled the Olyn∣thians, they went on to
chastise the Phliasians for having abused some exiles that had been
restored by the orders of Sparta. In this man∣ner they continued
distributing their orders with pride and severity; no state of Greece was
able to oppose their authority; and under the co∣lour of executing justice,
they were hourly pa∣ving the way to supreme command. In the midst of this
security, they were alarmed from a quar∣ter where they least expected. The
Thebans had, for four years since the seizing of their cita∣del,
submitted to the Spartan yoke; but they <PB N="7" REF="9"/> now took
occasion, by a very desperate at∣tempt, to throw it off; for which
purpose, there was a secret correspondence carried on between the most
considerable of the exiles of Athens, and those who were well affected to
them in Thebes; and measures were conduct∣ed between them by Phyllidas,
secretary to the Theban governors, by whose contrivance a competent number
of the exiles were to get into the city; and Charon, a man of the first rank
there, offered his house for their reception. The day being fixed, they set
out from Athens; and twelve of the most active and resolute among them were
detached to enter the city, the rest remaining at a proper distance to wait
the event. The first who offered himself was Pelopidas, who was young and
daring, and had been very zealous in encouraging the de∣sign; and, by the
share he had in it, gave a sufficient earnest of what might be further
ex∣pected from him in the service of his country. The next man of
consequence was Mellon, who, by some, is said to have first projected
the scheme with Phyllidas. These two, with their ten associates,
dressed themselves like peasants, and beat about the fields with dogs
and hunting-poles, as in search of game. Having thus passed
unsuspected, and con∣veyed <PB N="8" REF="10"/> themselves into the city,
they met at Charon's house, as the general rendezvous, when they were soon
after joined by thirty-six more of their confederates. It was concerted, that
Phyllidas should, on that day, give a great en∣tertainment to Archias and
Philip, the two governors who were appointed by the Spar∣tans; and, to make it
the more complete, he had engaged to provide some of the finest women in
the town to give them a meeting. Matters being thus prepared, the
associates di∣vided themselves into two bands; one of which, led by
Charon and Mellon, were to attack Archias and his company: and having put on
women's cloaths over their armour, with pine and poplar over their heads, to
shade their faces, they took their opportunity when the guests were well
heated with wine, to enter the room, and immediately stabbed Archias and
Philip, with such others of the company as were pointed out to them by
Phyllidas. A little before this execution, Archias received an express from
Athens, with all the particulars of the conspiracy; and the courier conjured
him, in the name of the person who wrote the letters, that he should read
them forthwith, for that they contained matter of great importance. But he laid
them by unopened; and, with a <PB N="9" REF="11"/> smile, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Business to-morrow:"</Q> which words, upon that
occasion, grew into a proverb. The other band, headed by Pelopidas and
Damo∣clides, went to attack Leontiades, who was at home, and in bed. They
rushed into his house by surprize; but he, soon taking the alarm,
leaped up, and, with his sword in his hand, re∣ceived them at his
chamber-door, and stabbed Cephisodorus, who was the first man that
at∣tempted to enter. Pelopidas was the next who encountered him; and, after a
long and difficult dispute, killed him. From thence they went in pursuit of
Hypates, his friend and neighbour, and dispatched him likewise; after which
they joined the other band, and sent to hasten the exiles they had left in
Attica.</P>
<P>The whole city was by this time filled with terror and confusion;
the houses full of lights, and the inhabitants running to and fro in the
streets, in a wild, distracted manner, and waiting impatiently for
day-light, that they might distin∣guish their friends from their foes,
seemed un∣determined what course to take. Early in the morning, the exiles
came in armed; and Pelopi∣das appeared with his party, in a general
assembly of the people, encompassed by the priests, car∣rying
garlands in their hands, proclaiming li∣berty to the Thebans in general, and
exhorting <PB N="10" REF="12"/> them to fight for their gods and their country;
for though they had made such a prosperous beginning, the most difficult
part still remained, whilst the citadel was in the possession of
the Spartans, with a garrison of fifteen hundred men, besides a great
number of citizens and others, who had fled to them for protection, and
declared themselves on their side.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, the Athenians sent five thousand foot,
and two thousand horse, to the assistance of Pelopidas: several
other bodies of troops also came in from all the cities of Boeotia; so that
the citadel being hemmed round, and despairing of succours from without,
surrendered at discretion.</P>
<P>The Thebans having thus acquired their freedom, the Spartans were
resolved, at any rate, to take the lead in the affairs of Greece; and having
incensed these beyond measure, at∣tempted to seize upon the Pyraeus,
and thus made the Athenians their irreconcileable ene∣mies. Agesilaus was
pitched upon to command the army that was to humble the Grecian states. His
name struck a terror into the Thebans; and his forces, which amounted to near
twenty thousand men, increased their fears. The Thebans, therefore,
instead of attempting to attack, were contented to stand upon their
de∣fence, <PB N="11" REF="13"/> and possessed themselves of a hill
near the city. Agesilaus detached a party of light armed men, to provoke them
to come down and give him battle; which they declining, he drew out his whole
forces, in order to attack them. Chabrias, who commanded the merce∣naries on
the part of the Thebans, ordered his men to present themselves, and keep
their ranks in close order, with their shields laid down at their feet, and
their spears advanced, and with one leg put forward, and the knee upon the
half-bent. Agesilaus, finding them prepared in this manner to receive him,
and that they stood as it were in defiance of him, thought fit to withdraw
his army; and contented himself with ravaging the country. This was looked
upon as an extraordinary stratagem; and Chabrias va∣lued himself so much
upon it, that he procured his statue to be erected in that posture.</P>
<P>Thus, through a succession of engagements, both by sea and
land, the Spartans, having pro∣voked a powerful confederacy, grew every day
weaker, and their enemies more daring. The Thebans continually grew bolder;
and, instead of continuing to defend themselves with diffi∣culty, attacked
the enemy with courage and success. Though the battles fought between
these states, were neither regular nor decisive, <PB N="12" REF="14"/> yet
they were such as served to raise the courage of the Thebans, to gain
them confidence, and to form them for those great undertakings which were
shortly to follow. Pelopidas, who headed them at the battle of Tanagra,
slew the Spartan commander with his own hand. At the battle of Tegyra, with
very unequal forces, he put a large body of the enemy to rout. He himself
commanded a battalion of the Theban army, distinguished by the name of the
Sacred Van. They were as remarkable for their fidelity to each other, as for
their strength and courage: they were linked by the bonds of common
friendship; and were sworn to stand by each other in the most dangerous
extremities. Thus united, they became invincible, and generally turned the
victory in their favour, for a suc∣cession of years; until they were at
last cut down, as one man, by the Macedonian phalanx under Philip.</P>
<P>A peace of short continuance followed these successes of
the Thebans; but they soon fell into tumults and seditions again. The
inha∣bitants of Xacinthus and Corcyra having ex∣pelled their magistrates, put
themselves under the protection of Athens, and repulsed the Spartans, who
attempted to restore their ma∣gistrates by force.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15"/> About the same time, the inhabitants of
Platea, applying to their old friends the Athe∣nians, for their protection and
alliance, the Thebans took offence at it, and demolished the town; and soon
after, did the same by Thespiae. The Athenians were so highly incensed
at the treatment of those two cities, which had deserved so well of the
common cause in the Persian war, that they would act no longer in
conjunction with them; and, upon their breaking with them, the affairs of
Greece took a new and unexpected turn.</P>
<P>It now began to appear, that the Thebans were growing into power;
and while Sparta and Athens were weakening each other by mu∣tual contests,
this state, which had enjoyed all the emoluments, without any of the expences
of the war, was every day growing more vigo∣rous and independent. The Thebans,
who now began to take the lead in the affairs of Greece, were naturally a hardy
and robust people, of slow intellects, and strong constitutions. It was
a constant maxim with them, to side either with Athens or Sparta, in their
mutual contests; and which soever they inclined to, they were generally of
weight enough to turn the balance. However, they had hitherto made no further
use of that weight, than to secure themselves; <PB N="14" REF="16"/> but
the spirit which now appeared among them; was first implanted by Pelopidas,
their deliverer from the Spartan yoke; but still further carried to its
utmost height, by Epaminondas, who now began to figure in the affairs of
Greece.</P>
<P>Epaminondas was one of those few exalted characters, with scarce
any vice, and almost eve∣ry virtue to distinguish him from the rest of
man∣kind. Though in the beginning possessed of every quality
necessary for the service of the state, he chose to lead a private
life, employed in the study of philosophy, and shewing an example of the
most rigid observance of all its doctrines.</P>
<P>Truly a philosopher, and poor out of taste, he despised
riches, without affecting any repu∣tation from that contempt; and if Justin
may be believed, he coveted glory as little as he did money. It was always
against his will that commands were conferred upon him; and he behaved
himself in them in such a manner, as did more honour to dignities, than
dignities to him.</P>
<P>Though poor himself, and without any estate, his very poverty,
by drawing upon him the esteem and confidence of the rich, gave him the
opportunity of doing good to others. One of his friends being in great
necessity, Epami∣nondas sent him to a very rich citizen, with 
<PB N="15" REF="17"/> orders to ask him for a thousand crowns in his name:
that rich man coming to his house, to know his motives for directing his
friend to him upon such an errand, 
<Q REND="inline">"Why," replied Epaminondas, "it is because this
honest man is in want, and you are rich."</Q> Fond of lei∣sure, which he
devoted to the study of philo∣sophy, his darling passion, he shunned
public employments, and made no interest but to exclude himself from them.
His moderation concealed him so well, that he lived obscure, and almost
unknown. His merit however dis∣covered him. He was taken from his solitude
by force, to be placed at the head of armies; and he demonstrated, that
philosophy, though generally in contempt with those who aspire at the
glory of arms, is wonderfully useful in forming heroes; for it was a great
advance to∣wards conquering the enemy, to know how to conquer one's self: in
this school anciently were taught the great maxims of true policy, the rules
of every kind of duty, the motives for a due dis∣charge of them, what we owe
our country, the right use of authority, wherein true courage con∣sists;
in a word, the qualities that form the good citizen, statesman, and great
captain; and in all these Epaminondas excelled.</P>
<P>He possessed all the ornaments of the mind. He had the
talent of speaking in perfection; <PB N="16" REF="18"/> and was well versed
in the most sublime sciences. But a modest reserve threw a veil over
all those excellent qualities, which still augmented their value, and of
which he knew not what it was to be ostentatious. Spintharus, in giving his
character, said, That he never had met with a man who knew more, and spoke
less.</P>
<P>Such was the general appointed to command the Theban army, and act
in conjunction with Pelopidas; with whom he had the most perfect and the
most disinterested friendship. This state being left out in the
general treaty of peace, and thus having the Spartans and Athe∣nians
confederated against it, they appeared under the utmost consternation,
and all Greece looked upon them as lost and undone. The Spartans ordered
levies to be made in all parts of Greece, that sided with them; and
Cleom∣brotus, their general, marched towards the frontiers of Boeotia, secure
of victory: willing, however, to give his hostilities an air of justice, he
sent to demand of the Thebans, that they should restore the cities that
they had usurped, to their liberties; that they should rebuild those they
had demolished before, and make resti∣tution for all their former wrongs.
To this it was replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the Thebans were accountable to none but
Heaven for their <PB N="17" REF="19"/> conduct."</Q> Nothing now remained on
both sides, but to prepare for action. Epaminondas immediately raised all
the troops he could, and began his march: his army did not amount to six
thousand men; and the enemy had above four times that number. As several
bad omens were urged to prevent his setting out, he re∣plied only by a
verse from Homer, of which the sense is, There is but one good omen; to
fight for one's country. However, to reassure the soldiers, by nature
superstitious, and whom he observed to be discouraged, he instructed
several persons to come from different places, and report auguries and
omens in his favour, which revived the spirit and hopes of the troops.</P>
<P>Epaminondas had wisely taken care to secure a pass by
Cleombrotus, which might have short∣ened his march considerably. The
latter, after having taken a large compass, arrived at Leuctra, a small
town of Boeotia, between Plataea and Thespiae. Both parties consulted
whether they should give battle; which Cleombrotus resolved, by the advice
of all his officers; who represented to him, that if he declined fighting
with such a superiority of troops, it would confirm the cur∣rent report,
that he secretly favoured the The∣bans. The latter had an essential
reason for <PB N="18" REF="20"/> hastening a battle before the arrival of
the troops, which the enemy daily expected: how∣ever, the six generals who
formed the council of war, differed in their sentiments; the se∣venth, who
was Epaminondas, came in very good time to join the three that were for
fight∣ing; and his opinion carrying the question, the battle was resolved
upon.</P>
<P>The two armies were very unequal in num∣ber: that of the
Lacedemonians, as has been said, consisted of twenty-sour thousand
foot, and sixteen hundred horse; the Thebans had only six thousand
foot, and four hundred horse; but all of them choice troops, animated by
their ex∣perience in war, and determined to conquer or die. The Lacedemonian
cavalry, composed of men picked up by chance, without valour, and ill
disciplined, was as much inferior to their enemies in courage, as superior
in number. The infantry could not be depended on, except the Lacedemonians; the
allies, as has been said, having engaged in the war with reluctance,
be∣cause they did not approve the motive of it, and being besides
diffatisfied with the Lace∣demonians.</P>
<P>The ability of the generals of either side, supplied the place
of numerous armies, espe∣cially of the Theban, who was the most
accom∣plished <PB N="19" REF="21"/> soldier of his times. He was supported
by Pelopidas, at the head of the sacred battalion, composed of three
hundred Thebans, united in a strict friendship and affection, and engaged,
under a particular oath, never to fly, but to defend each other to the
last.</P>
<P>Upon the day of battle, the two armies drew up on a plain.
Cleombrotus was upon the right, at the head of a body consisting of
Lacedemo∣nians, on whom he confided most, and whose files were twelve deep:
to take the advan∣tage, which his superiority of horse gave him in an open
country, he posted them in front of his Lacedemonians. Archidamus, the son
of Agesilaus, was at the head of the allies, who formed the left wing.</P>
<P>Epaminondas, who resolved to charge with his left, which he
commanded in person, strengthened it with the choice of his heavy∣armed
troops, whom he drew up fifty deep: the sacred battalion was upon his left,
and closed the wing: the rest of his infantry were posted upon his right,
in an oblique line; which, the farther it extended, was the more distant from
the enemy. By this uncommon disposition, his design was to cover his
flank on the right; to keep off his right wing, as a kind of reserved body,
that he might not hazard the event of <PB N="20" REF="22"/> the battle upon the
weakest part of his army; and to begin the action with his left wing, where
his best troops were posted, to turn the whole weight of the battle upon
Cleombro∣tus and the Spartans. He was assured that, if he could penetrate
the Lacedemonian pha∣lanx, the rest of the army would soon be put to the
rout. As for his horse, he disposed them, after the enemy's example, in
the front of his left.</P>
<P>The action began with the cavalry. As the Thebans were better
mounted, and braver troops than the Lacedemonian horse, the latter were not
long before they were broke, and driven upon the infantry, which they put into
some confusion. Epaminondas, following his horse close, marched
swiftly up to Cleombrotus, and fell upon his phalanx with all the weight of
his heavy battalion. The latter, to make a diversion, detached a body of
troops, with orders to take Epaminondas in flank, and to surround him.
Pelopidas, upon the sight of that movement, advanced with incredible speed
and boldness, at the head of the sacred battalion, to prevent the enemy's
design, and flanked Cleombrotus himself; who, by that sudden and
unexpected attack, was put into disorder. The battle was very fierce and
obstinate; and, whilst <PB N="21" REF="23"/> Cleombrotus could act, the
victory continued in suspense, and declared for neither party. But when
he fell dead with his wounds, the The∣bans, to complete the victory, and the
Lace∣demonians, to avoid the shame of abandoning the body of their king,
redoubled their efforts, and a great slaughter ensued on both sides. The
Spartans fought with so much fury about the body, that at length they gained
their point, and carried it off. Animated by so glorious an advantage, they
prepared to return to the charge, which would perhaps have proved
successful, had the allies seconded their ardour: but the left wing,
seeing the Lacedemonian phalanx broken, and believing all lost,
espe∣cially when they heard that the king was dead, took to flight, and drew
off the rest of the army. Epaminondas followed them vigo∣rously, and killed
a great number in the pursuit. The Thebans remained masters of the field of
battle, erected a trophy, and per∣mitted the enemy to bury their dead.</P>
<P>The Lacedemonians had never received such a blow. The most
bloody defeat, till then, had scarce ever cost them more than four or five
hundred of their citizens. Here they lost four thousand men, of whom, one
thousand <PB N="22" REF="24"/> were Lacedemonians, and four hundred Spar∣tans,
out of seven hundred who were in the battle. The Thebans had only three
hundred men killed, among whom were four of their citizens.</P>
<P>The city of Sparta was celebrating at that time the Gymnastic
games, and was full of stran∣gers, whom curiosity had brought thither. When
the couriers arrived from Leuctra with the ter∣rible news of their defeat, the
Ephori, though perfectly sensible of all the consequences, and that the
Spartan empire had received a mortal wound, would not permit the
representations of the theatre to be suspended, nor any changes in the
celebration of the festival. They sent to every family the names of their
relations who were killed, and stayed in the theatre to see that the dances
and games were continued, without interruption, to the end.</P>
<P>The next day, in the morning, the loss of each family being known,
the fathers and rela∣tions of those who had died in the battle, met in the
public place, and saluted and embraced each other with great joy and
serenity in their looks, whilst the others kept themselves close in
their houses; or, if necessity obliged them to go abroad, it was with a
sadness and dejection <PB N="23" REF="25"/> of aspect, which sensibly
expressed their pro∣found anguish and affliction. That difference was
still more remarkable in the women: grief, silence, tears distinguished
those who expected the return of their sons; but such as had lost their
sons, were seen hurrying to the temple, to thank the gods, and
congratulating each other upon their glory and good fortune.</P>
<P>One great point under immediate consi∣deration, was concerning
those who had fled out of the battle. They were, by the law, in that case,
to be degraded from all honour, and rendered infamous; insomuch, that it was
a disgrace to intermarry with them: they were to appear publicly in mean and
dirty habits, with patched and party-coloured garments, and to go half
shaved; and whoever met them in the streets, might insult and beat them,
and they were not to make any resistance. This was so severe a law, and
such numbers had incurred the penalties of it, many of whom were of great
families and interest, that they apprehended the execution of it might
occasion some public commotions; besides, that these citizens, such
as they were, could very ill be spared at this time, when they wanted to
recruit the army. Under this difficulty, they gave Agesilaus a 
<PB N="24" REF="26"/> power even over the laws, to dispense with them, to
abrogate them, or to enact such new ones as the present exigency required.
He would not abolish or make any variation in the law itself; but made a
public declaration, That it should lie dormant for that single day, but
revive and be in full force again on the morrow; and, by that expedient, he
saved the citizens from infamy.</P>
<P>So great a victory was followed by instan∣taneous effects; numbers
of the Grecian states that had hitherto remained neuter, now de∣clared in
favour of the conquerors, and increased their army to the amount of seventy
thousand men. Epaminondas entered Laconia with an army, the twelfth part of
which were not The∣bans; and finding a country hitherto untouched by an enemy,
he ran through it with fire and sword, destroying and plundering as far as
the river Eurotas.</P>
<P>This river was, at that time, very much swoln by the melting of
the snow; and the Thebans sound more difficulty in passing it than they
expected, as well from the rapidity as the extreme coldness of the water. As
Epa∣minondas was passing at the head of his infantry, some of the
Spartans shewed him to Agesilaus, <PB N="25" REF="27"/> who, after having
attentively considered and followed him with his eyes a long time, could not
help crying out, in admiration of his va∣lour, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Oh! the wonder-working man!</HI></Q> The The∣ban
general, however, contented himself with over-running the country, without
attempting any thing upon Sparta, and, entering Arcadia, reinstated it in all
its former privileges and li∣berties. The Lacedemonians had some time before
stripped the harmless natives of all their possessions, and obliged
them to take re∣fuge among strangers. Their country was equal in extent to
Laconia, and as fertile as the best in Greece. Its ancient inhabitants, who
were dispersed in different regions of Greece, Italy and Sicily, on the
first notice given them, returned with incredible joy, animated by the love
of their country, natural to all men; and almost as much by the hatred of the
Spartans, which the length of time had only increased. They built
themselves a city, which, from the ancient name, was called Messene.</P>
<P>After performing such signal exploits, Pelo∣pidas and
Epaminondas, the Theban generals, once more returned home, not to share the
triumph and acclamations of their fellow-citi∣zens, but to answer the
accusations that were <PB N="26" REF="28"/> laid against them; they were now
both sum∣moned as criminals against the state, of having retained their
posts four months beyond the time limited by law. This offence was capital by
the laws of Thebes; and those who stood up for the constitution, were
very earnest in having it observed with punctuality. Pelopidas was the
first cited before the tribunal: he defended himself with less force and
greatness of mind, than was expected from a man of his character, by nature
warm and fiery. That valour, haughty and intrepid in fight, forsook him
be∣fore his judges. His air and discourse, which had something timid and
creeping in it, de∣noted a man who was afraid of death, and did not in the
least incline the judges in his favour, who acquitted him, not without
difficulty. Epa∣minondas, on the contrary, appeared with all the confidence of
conscious innocence: instead of justifying himself, he enumerated his
actions; he repeated, in haughty terms, in what manner he had ravaged Laconia,
re-established Messe∣nia, and re-united Arcadia in one body. He
concluded with saying, That he should die with pleasure, if the Thebans
would renounce the sole glory of those actions to him, and declare that he
had done them by his own authority, and without their participation. All 
<PB N="27" REF="29"/> the voices were in his favour; and he returned from his
trial, as he used to return from battle, with glory and universal
applause. Such dig∣nity has true valour, that it in a manner seizes the
admiration of mankind by force. This manner of reproaching them had so good
an effect, that his enemies declined any further prosecution; and he, with
his colleague were honourably acquitted. His enemies, however, jealous of his
glory, with a design to affront him, caused him to be elected the city
scaven∣ger; he accepted the place with thanks, and asserted, That
instead of deriving honour from the office, he would give it dignity in his
turn.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Spartans, struck with consternation at
their late defeats, applied to the Athenians for succour; who, after some
hesi∣tation, determined to assist them with all their forces; and a
slight advantage the Spartans had gained over the Arcadians, in which they
did not lose a man, gave a promising dawn of success. The Persian
king was also applied to for assistance in the confederacy against
Thebes; but Pelopidas, undertaking an embassy to that court, frustrated
their purpose, and induced that great monarch to stand neuter.</P>
<P>Thebes being thus rid of so powerful an ene∣my, had less fears
of withstanding the confe∣deracy <PB N="28" REF="30"/> of Sparta and Athens:
but a new and an unexpected power was now growing up against them; a power
which was one day about to swallow up the liberties of Greece, and give laws
to all mankind.</P>
<P>Some years before this, Jason the king of Pherae, was chosen
general of the Thessalians by the consent of the people; he was at the
head of an army of above eight thousand horse, and twenty thousand heavy
armed foot, with∣out reckoning light infantry; and might have undertaken any
thing with such a body of dis∣ciplined and intrepid troops, who had an
entire confidence in the valour and conduct of their commander. Death prevented
his designs; he was assassinated by persons who had conspired his
destruction. His two brothers, Polydorus and Poliphron, were substituted
in his place. Against him Pelopidas was sent. The latter of whom killed the
other, for the sake of reign∣ing alone, and was soon after killed himself
by Alexander of Pherae, who seized the government, under the pretence of
revenging the death of Polydorus his father. The Theban general soon
compelled Alexander to make submission to him; and attempted by mild
usage to change the natural brutality of his disposition. But Alexander,
long addicted to a debauched life, <PB N="29" REF="31"/> and possessed
of insatiable avarice, secretly with∣drew from all constraint, resolved
to seize an opportunity of revenge. It was not till some time after that
this offered; for Pelopidas be∣ing appointed ambassador to Alexander, who
was at that time at the head of a powerful ar∣my, he was seized upon, and
made prisoner, contrary to all the laws of nations and huma∣nity. It was in
vain that the Thebans com∣plained of this infraction; it was in vain that they
sent a powerful army, but headed by in∣different generals, to revenge the
insult: their army returned without effect, and Alexander treated his
prisoners with the utmost severity. It was left for Epaminondas only to
bring the tyrant to reason. Entering Thessalia at the head of a powerful
army, his name spread such terror, that the tyrant offered terms of
sub∣mission, and delivered up Pelopidas from prison.</P>
<P>Pelopidas was scarce freed from confinement, when he resolved to
punish the tyrant for his perfidy and breach of faith. He led a body of
troops against Alexander, to a place called Cy∣nocephalus, where a bloody
battle ensued, in which the Thebans were victorious; but Pelo∣pidas was
unfortunately slain: his countrymen considered their successes very
dearly earned <PB N="30" REF="32"/> which they had obtained by his death. The
la∣mentations for him were general; his funeral was magnificent, and his
praises boundless. Alexander himself soon after was killed by Theba his
wife, and his three brothers, who, long shocked at his cruelties, resolved
to rid the world of such a monster. The account has it, that he slept
every night, guarded by a dog, in a chamber which was ascended by a ladder.
Theba allured away the dog, and covered the steps of the ladder with wool to
prevent noise, and then, with the assistance of her brothers, stabbed
him in several parts of his body.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the war between the The∣bans and the Spartans
proceeded with unabated vigour. The Theban troops were headed by their
favourite general Epaminondas; those of Sparta by Agesilaus, the only man
in Greece that was then able to oppose him.</P>
<P>The first attempt of Epaminondas in this campaign, marked his
great abilities, and his skill in the art of war. Being informed that
Agesilaus had begun his march with his army, and had left but few citizens to
defend Sparta at home, he marched directly thither by night, with a design to
take the city by surprize, as it had neither walls nor troops to defend it;
but luckily Agesilaus was apprised of his design, <PB N="31" REF="33"/>
and dispatched one of his horse to advise the city of its danger; soon
after arriving with a powerful succour in person, he had scarce en∣tered
the town, when the Thebans were seen passing the Eurotas, and coming on
against the city. Epaminondas, who perceived that his design was
discovered, thought it incum∣bent on him not to retire without some
attempt. He therefore made his troops advance, and making use of valour
instead of stratagem, he attacked the city at several quarters,
penetrated as far as the public place, and seized that part of Sparta which
lay upon the hither side of the river. Agesilaus made head every where, and
defended himself with much more valour than could be expected from his years.
He saw well that it was not now a time, as before, to spare himself, and
to act only upon the defen∣sive; but that he had need of all his courage and
daring, and to fight with all the vigour of despair. His son Archidamus, at
the head of the Spartan youth, behaved with incredible valour whenever the
danger was greatest; and, with his small troop, stopped the enemy, and
made head against them on all sides.</P>
<P>A young Spartan, named Isadas, distinguish∣ed himself
particularly in this action. He was very handsome in the face, perfectly well
shaped, <PB N="32" REF="34"/> of an advantageous stature, and in the flower
of his youth; he had neither armour nor cloaths upon his body, which shone
with oil; he held a spear in one hand, and a sword in the other. In this
condition he quitted his house with the utmost eagerness; and, breaking
through the press of the Spartans that fought, he threw himself upon the
enemy, gave mortal wounds at every blow, and laid all at his feet who
op∣posed him, without receiving any hurt him∣self. Whether the enemy were
dismayed at so astonishing a sight, or, says Plutarch, the gods
took pleasure in preserving him upon account of his extraordinary valour;
it is said, the Ephori decreed him a crown after the battle, in honour of his
exploits; but afterwards fined him a thousand drachmas, for having exposed
himself to so great a danger without arms.</P>
<P>Epaminondas, thus failing in his design, was resolved, before he
laid down his com∣mand, which was near expiring, to give the Lacedemonians and
Athenians battle, as they followed him close in the rear.</P>
<P>The Greeks had never fought among them∣selves with more numerous
armies. The La∣cedemonians consisted of more than twenty thousand foot,
and two thousand horse; the <PB N="33" REF="35"/> Thebans of thirty
thousand foot, and three thousand horse. Upon the right wing of the
former, the Mantineans, Arcadians, and La∣cedemonians were posted in one
line; the Eleans and Achaeans, who were the weakest of their troops, had the
centre; and the Athe∣nians alone composed the left wing. In the other army,
the Thebans and Arcadians were on the left, the Argives on the right, and the
other allies in the centre: the cavalry on each side were disposed in the
wings.</P>
<P>The Theban general marched in the same order of battle in which he
intended to fight, that he might not be obliged, when he came up with the
enemy, to lose, in the disposition of his army, a time which cannot be
recovered when lost in great enterprizes.</P>
<P>He did not march directly, and with his front to the enemy, but in a
column upon the hills, with his left wing foremost; as if he did not intend
to fight that day. When he was over-against them, at a quarter of a league's
di∣stance, he made the troops halt, and lay down their arms, as if he
designed to encamp there. The enemy, in effect, were deceived by his stand;
and reckoning no longer upon a battle, they quitted their arms, dispersed
themselves a∣bout the camp, and suffered that ardour to be ex∣tinguished,
<PB N="34" REF="36"/> which a near approach of a battle is wont to kindle in the
hearts of the soldiers.</P>
<P>Epaminondas, however, by suddenly wheel∣ing his troops to the
right, having changed his column into a line, and having drawn out the choice
troops, whom he had expressly posted in front upon his march, he made them
double their files upon the front of his left wing, to add to its strength,
and to put it into a condition to attack in a point the Lacedemonian phalanx,
which, by the movement he had made, faced it directly. He ordered the centre
and right wing of his army to move very slow, and to halt before they came up
with the enemy, that he might not hazard the event of the battle upon troops of
which he had no great opinion.</P>
<P>He expected to decide the victory by that body of chosen troops
which he commanded in person, and which he had formed into a co∣lumn to
attack the enemy in a wedge-like point. He assured himself, that if he
could penetrate the Lacedemonian phalanx, in which the enemy's principal force
consisted, he should not find it difficult to rout the rest of the
army, by charging upon the right and left with his victorious troops.</P>
<P>But that he might prevent the Athenians in the left wing from coming
to the support of <PB N="35" REF="37"/> their right against his intended
attack, he made a detachment of his horse and foot advance out of the line,
and posted them upon a rising ground, in readiness to flank the
Athenians, as well to cover his right as to alarm them and give them reason
to apprehend being taken in flank and rear themselves, if they advanced to
sustain their right.</P>
<P>After having disposed his whole army in this manner, he moved on
to charge the enemy with the whole weight of his column. They were strangely
surprized when they saw Epa∣minondas advance towards them in this order;
and resumed their arms, bridled their horses, and made all the haste they
could to their ranks.</P>
<P>Whilst Epaminondas marched against the enemy, the cavalry that
covered his flank on the left, the best at that time in Greece, en∣tirely
composed of Thebans and Thessalians, had orders to attack the enemy's
horse. The Theban general, whom nothing escaped, had artfully bestowed
bow-men, slingers, and dart-men in the intervals of his horse, in order to
begin the disorders of the enemy's cavalry, by a previous discharge of a
shower of arrows, stones, and javelins upon them. The other army had
neglected to take the same precau∣tion; <PB N="36" REF="38"/> and had made
another fault, not less considerable, in giving as much depth to the
squadrons as if they had been a phalanx. By this means their horse were
incapable of sup∣porting long the charge of the Thebans. Af∣ter having made
several ineffectual attacks with great loss, they were obliged to retire
behind their infantry.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Epaminondas, with his body of foot, had charged
the Lacedemonian phalanx. The troops fought on both sides with incredible
ardour, both the Thebans and Lacedemonians being resolved to perish ra∣ther
than yield the glory of arms to their ri∣vals. They began with fighting with
the spear; and those first arms being soon broken in the fury of the
combat, they charged each other sword in hand. The resistance was equally
obstinate; and the slaughter very great on both sides. The troops
despising danger, and desiring only to distinguish themselves by
the greatness of their actions, chose rather to die in their ranks, than to
lose a step of their ground.</P>
<P>The furious slaughter on both sides, having continued a great
while, without the victory inclining to either, Epaminondas, to force it to
declare for him, thought it his duty to make an extraordinary effort in
person, without re∣gard <PB N="37" REF="39"/> to the danger of his own life.
He form∣ed therefore a troop of the bravest and most determinate about him;
and, putting himself at the head of them, made a vigorous charge upon the
enemy, where the battle was most warm, and wounded the general of the
Lace∣demonians with the first javelin he threw. This troop, by his example,
having wounded or killed all that stood in their way, broke and penetrated
the phalanx. The Lacedemonians, dismayed by the presence of Epaminondas,
and overpowered by the weight of that intrepid party, were reduced to give
ground. The gross of the Theban troops, animated by their general's example
and success, drove back the enemy upon his right and left, and made great
slaughter of them. But some troops of the Spartans, perceiving that
Epaminondas aban∣doned himself too much to his ardour, sud∣denly rallied,
and, returning to the fight, charged him with a shower of javelins. Whilst
he kept off part of those darts, shunned some of them, fenced off others,
and was fighting with the most heroic valour, to assure the victory to
his army, a Spartan, named Callicrates, gave him a mortal wound with a javelin
in the breast across his cuirass. The wood of the ja∣velin being broke
off, and the iron head con∣tinuing <PB N="38" REF="40"/> in the wound, the
torment was insup∣portable, and he fell immediately. The battle began around
him with new fury; the one side using their utmost endeavours to take him
alive, and the other to save him. The The∣bans gained their point at last,
and carried him off, after having put the enemy to flight.</P>
<P>After several different movements, and al∣ternative losses and
advantages, the troops on both sides stood still, and rested upon their
arms; and the trumpets of the two armies, as if by consent, sounded the
retreat at the same time. Each party pretended to the victo∣ry, and erected a
trophy; the Thebans, be∣cause they had defeated the right wing, and re∣mained
masters of the field of battle; the Athenians, because they had cut the
detach∣ment in pieces. And, from this point of ho∣nour, both sides refused
at first to ask leave to bury their dead; which, with the ancients, was
confessing their defeat. The Lacedemo∣nians, however, sent first to
demand that per∣mission; after which, the rest had no thoughts but of
paying the last duties to the slain.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Epaminondas had been carried into the camp. The
surgeons, after having examined the wound, declared, that he would expire as
soon as the head of the dart <PB N="39" REF="41"/> was drawn out of it.
Those words gave all that were present the utmost sorrow and
afflic∣tion, who were inconsolable on seeing so great a man upon the
point of expiring. For him, the only concern he expressed was about his
arms, and the success of the battle. When they shewed him his shield,
and assured him that the Thebans had gained the victory, turn∣ing towards
his friends with a calm and se∣rene air, 
<Q REND="inline">"All then is well,"</Q> said he; and soon after,
upon drawing the head of the ja∣velin out of his body, he expired in the arms
of Victory.</P>
<P>As the glory of Thebes rose with Epami∣nondas, so it fell with
him; and he is, per∣haps, the only instance of one man's being able to
inspire his country with military glory, and lead it on to conquest,
without having had a pre∣decessor, or leaving an imitator of his
example.</P>
<P>The battle of Mantinea was the greatest that ever was fought by
Grecians against Grecians; the whole strength of the country being drawn
out, and ranged according to their different in∣terests; and it was fought
with an obstinacy equal to the importance of it, which was the fixing the
empire of Greece. And this must of course have been transferred to the
The∣bans upon their victory, if they had not lost <PB N="40" REF="42"/> the
fruits of it by the death of their gene∣ral, who was the soul of all their
counsels and designs. This blasted all their hopes, and put out their
sudden blaze of power, almost as soon as it was kindled. However, they
did not presently give up their pretensions; they were still ranked among
the leading states, and made several further struggles; but they were
faint and ineffectual; and such as were rather for life and being, than for
superiority and do∣minion. A peace, therefore, was proposed; which was
ratified by all the states of Greece, except Sparta; the conditions of which
were, that every state should maintain what they pos∣sessed, and
hold it independent of any other power.</P>
<P>A state of repose ensued this peace; in which the Grecian
powers seemed to slacken from their former animosities; and if we except
an expedition under Agesilaus into Egypt, whi∣ther he went to assist
Tachos, who had usurp∣ed that kingdom, and in which he died, there was little
done for several years following. The Athenians, more particularly, when they
found themselves delivered from him who kept up their emulation, grew
indolent a nd re∣miss, and abandoned themselves to their ease and
pleasure, being wholly taken up with <PB N="41" REF="43"/> shews, sports
and festivals. They were na∣turally too much addicted to these
amuse∣ments; and they had formerly been encoura∣ged in them by Pericles, who
knew how to lead them by their inclinations, and took this method to ingratiate
himself, and to di∣vert them from inspecting too narrowly into his
administration. But they now carried their diversions to a much higher
pitch of ex∣travagance. They had such a passion for the stage, that it
stifled in them all other thoughts either of business or of glory. In
short, the decorations, and other charges attending the theatre, were so
excessive, that Plutarch says, It cost more to represent some of
the famous pieces of Sophocles and Euripides, than it had done to carry on the
war against the bar∣barians. And, in order to support this charge, they
seized upon the fund which had been set apart for the war, with a
prohibition, upon pain of death, ever to advise the applying of it to any
other purpose. They not only re∣versed this decree, but went as far the
other way, making it death to propose the restoring the fund to the uses
to which it had before been appropriated, under the same penalties. By
diverting the course of the supplies in so ex∣traordinary a manner, and
entertaining the <PB N="42" REF="44"/> idle citizen at the expence of the
soldier and marinet, they seemed to have no remains of that spirit and
vigour which they had exert∣ed in the Persian wars, when they demolished
their houses to furnish out a navy; and when the women stoned a man to
death, who pro∣posed to appease the Great King (as he was called) by paying
tribute, and doing homage.</P>
<P>In this general remissness, it was not to be supposed,
that their allies would treat them with the respect they demanded. Most of
the states, that had hitherto been in alliance with them, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. J. C.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>58.</NOTE> and had found security
under their protection, took up arms against them. In reducing these,
Chabrias, Iphicrates, and Timotheus gained great reputation; and are
supposed to have been consummate generals; but their successes are
too minute to rank them among the class of eminent commanders; and whatever
their skill might have been, there wanted a great occasion for its
display. This war opened with the siege of Chio, in which the Athenians
were repulsed; and Cha∣brias, unwilling to abandon his vessel, pre∣ferred
death to flight. The siege of Byzan∣tium followed; before which, the fleet of
the contending powers was dispersed by a storm; in consequence of
which, the Athenian ge∣nerals <PB N="43" REF="45"/> were recalled. Timotheus was
fined a great sum; but, being too poor to pay, he went into voluntary
banishment. Iphi∣crates was also obliged to answer for him∣self, but
got off by his eloquence; and, in the mean time, the affairs of Athens
succeeded but ill under the guidance of Charis, who was left sole
commander. A peace was con∣cluded, whereby every city and people were left to
the full enjoyment of their liberty: and thus the war of the allies ended,
after having continued three years.</P>
<P>During these transactions, a power was grow∣ing up in Greece,
hitherto unobserved, but now too conspicuous and formidable to be
over∣looked in the general picture; this was that of the Macedonians; a people
hitherto obscure, and in a manner barbarous; and who, though warlike and
hardy, had never yet presumed to intermeddle in the affairs of Greece: but
now several circumstances concurred to raise them from obscurity, and
to involve them in measures, which, by degrees, wrought a tho∣rough change in
the state of Greece; it will be necessary, therefore, to begin with a
short account of their power and origin, before we enter into a detail of
that conspicuous part, which they afterwards performed on the theatre of the
world.</P>

<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. From the Birth to the Death of PHILIP King of
MACEDON.</HEAD>
<P>THE people of Macedon were hitherto con∣sidered as making no part
of the Grecian con∣federacy; they were looked upon as borderers, as men, in a
measure, semi-barbarous; who boasted indeed of taking their origin from
the Greeks; but who hitherto neither possessed their politeness, nor
enjoyed their freedom: they had little or no intercourse with their
mother-country; they had contracted the ha∣bits and manners of the natives
where they were settled, and from thence they were treat∣ed with similar
disrespect.</P>
<P>The first king who is mentioned with any degree of certainty to
have reigned in Macedo∣nia, was Caranus, by birth an Argive, and said to be
the sixteenth in descent from Hercules. It was upon this foundation, that
Philip afterwards grounded his pretensions to be of the race of Hercules, and
assumed to himself divine ho∣nours. Caranus, therefore, is commonly
repu∣ted <PB N="45" REF="47"/> to have led forth a body of his country∣men, by
the advice of the oracle, into these parts where he settled, and made
himself king. Caranus having, according to the general ac∣count, reigned
twenty-eight years; the succession was continued after him to the times
we are now treating of. But there is very little worth notice recorded of
these kings; they being chiefly employed in defending themselves against
the incursions of their neighbours. And as to their domestic affairs, they
were remark∣able only for the frequent murders and usur∣pations which
happened in the royal family.</P>
<P>Amintas, father of Philip, began to reign the third year of the
ninety-sixth Olympiad. Having the very year after been warmly at∣tacked by
the Illyrians, and dispossessed of a great part of his kingdom, which
he thought it scarce possible for him ever to recover again, he
addressed himself to the Olynthians; and, in order to engage them the
more firmly in his interest, he had given up to them a consider∣able track
of land in the neighbourhood of their city. He was restored to the throne by
the Thessalians; upon which he was de∣sirous of resuming the
possession of the lands, which nothing but the ill situation of his
affairs had obliged him to resign to the Olynthians. <PB N="46" REF="48"/>
This occasioned a war; but Amintas not be∣ing strong enough to make head
singly against so powerful a people, the Greeks and the Athe∣nians, in
particular, sent him succours, and enabled him to weaken the power of the
Olyn∣thians, who threatened him with a total and impending ruin.</P>
<P>Amintas died, after having reigned twenty-four years; he left three
legitimate children, namely, Alexander, Perdicas, and Philip. Alex∣ander, the
eldest son, reigned but one year. Perdicas, the second brother, was
opposed by Pausanias, who began, by seizing some for∣tresses; but,
by the assistance of Iphicrates, the Athenian general, the usurper was
expelled, and Perdicas the lawful sovereign confirmed on the throne. He did
not, however, long con∣tinue in tranquillity. Ptolemy, a natural son of
Amintas, laid claim to the crown, and dis∣puted his title; which, by mutual
consent, was referred to Pelopidas the Theban, a man more revered for his
probity than his valour. Pelo∣pidas determined in favour of Perdicas; and,
having judged it necessary to take pledges on both sides, in order to
oblige the two compe∣titors to observe the articles of the treaty ac∣cepted
by them, among other hostages, he car∣ried Philip with him to Thebes, where
he <PB N="47" REF="49"/> resided several years. He was then ten years of
age. Eurydice, at her leaving this much-loved son, earnestly besought
Pelopidas to procure him an education worthy of his birth, and of the city to
which he was going, an hostage. Pelopidas placed him with Epaminondas, who
had a celebrated Pythagorean philosopher in his house for the education of
his son. Philip improved greatly by the instructions of his pre∣ceptor, and
much more by those of Epaminon∣das, under whom he undoubtedly made some
campaigns, though no mention is made of this. He could not possibly have
had a more ex∣cellent master, whether for war, or the con∣duct of life; for
this illustrious Theban was, at the same time, a great philosopher; that
is to say, a wise and virtuous man, and a great commander, as well as a
great statesman. Philip was very proud of being his pupil, and proposed
him as a model to himself; most hap∣py, could he have copied him perfectly!
Per∣haps he borrowed from Epaminondas his acti∣vity in war, and his promptitude
in improving occasions; which, however, formed but a very inconsiderable
part of the merit of that illu∣strious personage. But, with regard to his
temperance, his justice, his disinterestedness, his sincerity, his
magnanimity, his clemency, <PB N="48" REF="50"/> which rendered him truly great,
these were virtues which Philip had not received from nature, and did not
acquire by imitation.</P>
<P>The Thebans did not know that they were then forming and educating
the most danger∣ous enemy of Greece. After Philip had spent nine or ten
years in their city, the news of a revolution in Macedon made him resolve to
leave Thebes clandestinely. Accordingly he stole away, made the utmost
expedition, and found the Macedonians greatly surprized at ha∣ving lost
their king Perdicas, who had been killed in a great battle by the Illyrians;
but much more so, to find they had as many ene∣mies as neighbours. The
Illyrians were on the point of returning into the kingdom with a much greater
force; the Peonians infested it with perpetual incursions; the Thracians
were determined to place Pausanias on the throne, who had not abandoned his
preten∣sions; and the Athenians were bringing Ar∣gaeus, whom Mantias, their
general, was or∣dered to support with a strong fleet, and a con∣siderable
body of troops. Macedonia at that time wanted a prince of years to govern; and
had only a child, Amintas, the son of Perdi∣cas, and lawful heir of the
crown. Philip governed the kingdom for some time, by the <PB N="49" REF="51"/>
title of Guardian to the Prince; but the sub∣jects, justly alarmed,
deposed the nephew in favour of the uncle; and instead of the heir, whom
nature had given them, set him upon the throne whom the present conjuncture
of affairs required, persuaded that the laws of necessity are superior
to all others. According∣ly, Philip, at twenty-four years of age, as∣cended
the throne, the first year of the 105th Olympiad.</P>
<P>Never did the present condition of the Ma∣cedonians require a man
of more prudence and activity. They were surrounded with as many enemies as
they had neighbours. The Illyrians, slushed with their late victory, were
preparing to march against them with a great army. The Paeonians were making
daily incursions upon them; and, at the same time, the title to the crown
was contested by Pausanias and Argaeus; the former whereof was supported
by the Thra∣cians, and the latter by the Athenians; who, for that purpose,
had sent out a good fleet, and three thousand land-men.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, with so many enemies on his hands
at once, and that before he was settled on the throne, his first care was
to make sure of his own people, to gain their affections, and to raise
their spirits; for they <PB N="50" REF="52"/> were very much disheartened,
having lost above four thousand men in the late action with the Illyrians.
He succeeded in these points, by the artfulness of his address, and the
force of his elo∣quence, of which he was a great master. His next step was
to train and exercise them, and reform their discipline; and it was at this
time that he instituted the famous Macedonian phalanx, which did so much
execution. It was an im∣provement upon the ancient manner of fight∣ing among
the Grecians, who generally drew up their foot so close, as to stand the
shock of the enemy without being broken. The com∣plete phalanx was thought to
contain above sixteen thousand men; though it was also taken in general
for any company or party of sol∣diers, and frequently for the whole body of
foot. But this of Philip's invention is descri∣bed by Polybius to be a long
square, consist∣ing of eight thousand pike-men, sixteen deep, and
five hundred in front; the men standing so close together, that the pikes
of the fifth rank were extended three foot beyond the line of the front. The
rest, whose distance from the front made their pikes useless,
rested them upon the shoulders of those who stood before them, and so
locking them together in file, pressed forward to support and push on
the former <PB N="51" REF="53"/> ranks, whereby the assault was rendered
more violent and irresistible.</P>
<P>When Philip had made some proper regu∣lation of his affairs at
home, he began to look abroad, in order to divert the storms which threatened
him from all quarters. By money and promises, he made up matters for the
present with such of his enemies as lay nearest to him; and then turned
his forces against the Athenians, who were marched up to Methone, to
assist Argaeus. He gave them battle, and defeated them; and the death of
Argaeus, who was killed in the action, put an end to that dispute: for he
permitted the Athenians, when they were in his power, to return home. This
instance of his moderation, gained so far upon them, that they soon after
concluded a peace with him; which yet he observed no longer than it served
his design of securing the other part of his dominions.</P>
<P>Accordingly, he marched northward, where he declared war against
the Paeonians, and subdued them; then fell upon the Illyrians, and having
killed above seven thousand of them in a pitched battle, obliged them to
restore all their conquests in Macedonia. He had also ob∣structed the
passage of the Thasians; but yet did not think it sufficiently
secured, without making <PB N="52" REF="54"/> himself master of
Amphipolis, which was very commodiously situated on the river Strymon, and
was the key of that side of his dominions. He knew the importance of it,
therefore he possessed himself of it in the beginning of his reign.
This was the ground of his quarrel with the Athe∣nians; who claimed it as one
of their colonies, and made such a point of it, that their setting up
Argaeus against him, was not so much for his own sake, as for the credit
of imposing a king upon the Macedonians; as it was with a view to get the
city restored to them by his means, in case he should have succeeded in
his inten∣tions. Philip was sensible of their drift, and finding it
necessary at that time to keep some measures with them, would neither
keep the place himself, nor let them have it; but took a middle course, and
declared it a free city; thereby leaving the inhabitants to throw off their
dependence on their old masters, and making it appear to be their own act.
But the city continued no longer in this state, than until he sound
himself at liberty to make a more tho∣rough conquest of it; which at this
time he easily effected, through the remissness of the Athenians, who
refused to send any relief to it; alledging, in their excuse, that it
would be a breach of the peace, which they had concluded <PB N="53" REF="55"/>
with Philip the year before. But the truth is, he tricked them out of it by a
promise of deli∣vering it up to them. But instead of keeping his word with
them, he made further encroach∣ments, by seizing on Pydna and Potidea; the
latter of which being garrisoned by Athenians, he drew them out, and sent
them home; but dismissed them with such marks of civility, as shewed
that he avoided coming to an open rup∣ture with that state, at least until
his designs were more ripe for it; though at the same time he did what he
could to weaken them, and drive them out of his neighbourhood. Pydna, with the
territory belonging to it, he gave up to the Olynthians, who were his father's
inve∣terate enemies. His hands were too full at this time to revive the quarrel
against so rich and powerful a city; which, for three years together, had
withstood the united forces of Sparta and Macedonia; he therefore chose to
buy their friendship for the present, and to amuse them by the delivery
of this town, as he had done the Athenians by the peace, until he could attack
them at more advantage. In this step also he over-reached the Athenians;
who were at the same time courting the alliance of the Olynthians, in order
to maintain their footing in those parts. Which side soever the 
<PB N="54" REF="56"/> Olynthians inclined to, they were strong enough to turn
the balance; and therefore, the gain∣ing them became a matter of great
contention between Philip and the Athenians.</P>
<P>From thence he proceeded to seize the city of Crenides, which had
been built two years before, and then called it Philippi, from his own name. It
was here that he discovered a gold mine, which every year produced an hundred
and forty-four thousand pounds sterling. This, which was an immense sum
for that age, was much more serviceable than fleets or armies, in fighting
his battles; and he seldom failed using it in every negociation. It is
said, that consulting the oracle at Delphos, concerning the success of
an intended expedition, he was answered by the priestess, That with
silver spears he should con∣quer all things. He took the advice of the
oracle, and his success was answerable to its wisdom: indeed, he was
less proud of the suc∣cess of a battle, than of a negociation; well
knowing, that his soldiers and generals shared in the one, but that the
honour of the latter was wholly his own.</P>
<P>But a larger field was now opening to his ambition. The mutual
divisions of the states of Greece were at no time wholly cemented, and they
broke out now upon a very particular <PB N="55" REF="57"/> occasion. The
first cause of the rupture, (which was afterwards called the Sacred War)
arose from the Phocians having ploughed up a piece of ground belonging to the
temple of Apollo at Delphos. Against this all the neigh∣bouring states
exclaimed as a sacrilege: they were cited before the council of Amphyctions,
who particularly took cognizance of sacred matters; they were cast, and an
heavy fine was imposed upon them. This the Phocians were unable to pay; they
refused to submit to the decree: they alledged, that the care and
pa∣tronage of the temple anciently belonged to them; and, to vindicate this,
they quoted a precedent from Homer.</P>
<P>Philomelas, one of their chief citizens, was principally
instrumental in encouraging them to arms: he raised their ardour, and was
ap∣pointed their general. He first applied him∣self to the Spartans, who
had likewise been fined by the Amphyctions, at the instance of the Thebans,
after the battle of Leuctra, for having seized the Cadmea: for this reason
they were very well disposed to join with him, but did not yet think it
proper to declare them∣selves: however, they encouraged his design, and
supplied him under-hand with money; by which means he raised troops, and,
without <PB N="56" REF="58"/> much difficulty, got possession of the
temple. The chief resistance he met with in the neigh∣bourhood, was from
the Locrians; but having worsted them, he erased the decree of the
Amphyctions, which was inscribed on the pil∣lars of the temple. However, to
strengthen his authority, and give a colour to his proceedings, he thought it
convenient to consult the oracle, and to procure an answer in his favour.
But when he applied to the priestess for that pur∣pose, she refused
to officiate, until being inti∣midated by his threats, she told him, the god
left him at liberty to act as he pleased; which he looked upon as a good
answer, and as such took care to divulge it.</P>
<P>The Amphyctions meeting a second time, a resolution was formed
to declare war against the Phocians. Most of the Grecian nations engaged in
this quarrel, and sided with the one or the other party. The Boeotians, the
Locrians, Thessa∣lians, and several other neighbouring people, declared
in favour of the god; whilst Sparta, Athens, and some other cities of
Peloponesus, joined with the Phocians. Philomelas had not yet touched the
treasures of the temple; but being afterwards not so scrupulous, he
be∣lieved that the riches of the god could not be better employed, than in the
deity's defence; <PB N="57" REF="59"/> for he gave this specious name to this
sacri∣legious attempt: and being enabled, by this fresh supply, to double
the pay of his soldiers, he raised a very considerable body of
troops.</P>
<P>Several battles were fought; and the success for some time
seemed doubtful on both sides. Every one knows how much religious wars are
to be dreaded, and the prodigious lengths which a false zeal, when veiled
with so venerable a name, is apt to go. The Thebans having in a rencounter
taken several prisoners, condemned them all to die, as sacrilegious
wretches who were excommunicated: the Phocians did the same, by way of
reprisal. These had at first gained several advantages; but having been
defeated in a great battle, Philomelas their leader being closely attacked on
an eminence from which there was no retreating, defended himself for a long
time with invincible bravery; which however not availing, he threw himself
headlong from a rock, in order to avoid the torments he must undoubtedly have
undergone, had he fallen alive into the hands of his ene∣mies. Oenomarchus was
his successor, and took upon him the command of the forces.</P>
<P>Philip thought it most consistent with his in∣terest to
remain neuter in this general move∣ment of the Greeks, in favour either of the 
<PB N="58" REF="60"/> Phocians or the Thebans. It was consistent with the
policy of this ambitious prince, who had little regard for religion, or the
interests of Apollo, but was always intent upon his own, not to engage in a
war by which he could not reap the least benefit; and to take advantage of a
juncture in which all Greece, employed and divided by a great war, gave him an
oppor∣tunity to extend his frontiers, and push his con∣quests, without any
apprehension of opposition. He was also well pleased to see both
parties weaken and consume each other; as he should thereby be enabled to
fall upon them afterwards to greater advantage.</P>
<P>Being desirous of subjecting Thrace, and of se∣curing the
conquests he had already made there, he determined to possess himself
of Methone, a small city, incapable of supporting itself by its own
strength, but which gave him disquiet, and obstructed his designs,
whenever it was in the hands of his enemies. Accordingly he be∣sieged that
city, made himself master of, and razed it. He lost one of his eyes
before Methone, by a very singular accident. Aster of Amphipolis had
offered his services to Philip, as so excellent a marksman, that he could
bring down birds in their most rapid slight. The monarch made this
answer, 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, I will take <PB N="59" REF="61"/> you into my
service, when I make war upon starlings;"</Q> which answer stung the
archer to the quick. A repartee proves often of fatal consequence to him who
makes it; so that, Aster having thrown himself into the city, he let fly
an arrow, on which was written, 
<Q REND="inline">"To Philip's right eye."</Q> This carried a most
cruel proof that he was a good marksman; for he hit him in the right eye; and
Philip sent him back the same arrow, with this inscription: 
<Q REND="inline">"If Philip takes the city, he will hang up
Aster;"</Q> and accordingly he was as good as his word. A skilful surgeon
drew the arrow out of Philip's eye with so much art and dexterity, that not
the least scar remained; and though he could not save his eye, he yet
took away the blemish.</P>
<P>After taking the city, Philip, ever studious either to weaken his
enemies by new conquests, or gain more friends by doing them some
im∣portant service, marched into Thessaly, which had implored his
assistance against its tyrants. The liberty of that country seemed
now secure, since Alexander of Pherae was no more. Never∣theless, his
brothers, who, in concert with his wife Thebe, had murdered him, grown weary of
having some time acted the part of deliverers, revived his tyranny, and
oppressed the Thessa∣lians <PB N="60" REF="62"/> with a new yoke.
Lycophron, the eldest of the three brothers who succeeded Alexander, had
strengthened himself by the protection of the Phocians Oenomarchus, their
leader, brought him a numerous body of forces, and at first gained a
considerable advantage over Philip; but engaging him a second time, he was
en∣tirely defeated, and his army routed. The flying troops were pursued to
the sea-shore; upwards of six thousand men were killed on the spot,
among whom was Oenomarchus, whose body was hung upon a gallows; and three
thousand, who were taken prisoners, were thrown into the sea by Philip's
order, as so many sacrilegious wretches, the professed enemies of
religion.</P>
<P>Philip, after having freed the Thessalians, resolved to carry
his arms into Phocis. This was his first attempt to get footing in Greece,
and to have a share in the general affairs of the Greeks, from which the
kings of Macedon had always been excluded as foreigners. In this view, upon
pretence of going over into Phocis, in order to punish the sacrilegious
Phocians, he marched towards Thermopylae, to possess himself of a
pass which gave him a free passage into Greece, and especially into
Attica.</P>
<P>An admission of foreigners into Greece, was a measure that was
always formidable to those <PB N="61" REF="63"/> who called themselves
Grecians. The Athenians, upon hearing of a march which might prove of the
utmost consequence, hasted to Thermo∣pylae, and possessed
themselves of this important pass, which Philip did not care attempting to
force. The Athenians were roused from their lethargy of pleasure, to make
use of this pre∣caution, by the persuasions of Demosthenes, the
celebrated orator, who, from the beginning, saw the ambition of Philip, and
the power of which he was possessed to carry him through his
designs.</P>
<P>This illustrious orator and statesman, whom we shall
hereafter find acting so considerable a part in the course of this
history, was born in the last year of the ninety-ninth Olympiad, ac∣cording
to Dionysius, who, in his epistle to Lammacus, hath accurately
distinguished the different periods of his life, and the times in which his
several orations were delivered. He was the son not of a mean and obscure
me∣chanic, as the Roman satyrist hath represented him, but of an eminent
Athenian citizen, who raised a considerable fortune by the manufac∣ture of
arms. At the age of seven years, he lost his father; and to add to this
misfortune, the guardians to whom he was intrusted, wasted and embezzled a
considerable part of his inhe∣ritance. <PB N="62" REF="64"/> Thus
oppressed by fraud, and dis∣couraged by a weak and effeminate habit of
body, he yet discovered an early ambition to distinguish himself as a
popular speaker. The applause bestowed on a public orator, who had
defended his country's right to the city of Oropus, in an elaborate harangue,
inflamed his youthful mind with an eager desire of meriting the like honour.
Isocrates and Isaeus were then the two most eminent professors of
eloquence at Athens. The soft and florid manner of the former did by no means
suit the genius of De∣mosthenes: Isaeus was more vigorous and ener∣getic,
and his style better suited to public bu∣siness. To him therefore he
applied, and under his direction pursued those studies, which might
accomplish him for the character to which he aspired. His first essay
was made against his guardian, by whom he had been so injuriously
treated: but the goodness of his cause was here of more service than the
abilities of the young orator; for his early attempts were unpro∣mising, and
soon convinced him of the necessity of a graceful and manly
pronunciation. His close and severe application, and the extraor∣dinary
diligence with which he laboured to con∣quer his defects and natural
infirmities, are too well known, and have been too frequently the 
<PB N="63" REF="65"/> subjects of historians and critics, ancient and
modern, to need a minute recital. His cha∣racter as a statesman will be
best collected from the history of his conduct in the present
tran∣sactions. As an orator, the reader perhaps is not to be informed of his
qualifications. Indeed, the study of oratory was at that time the readiest
and almost the only means of rising in the state. His first essay
at the bar was two years after this incident, when he called his guardians to
ac∣count for embezzling his patrimony, and reco∣vered some part of it. This
encouraged him some time after, to harangue before the people in their public
assembly; but he acquitted himself so ill, that they hissed him:
however, he ven∣tured a second time, but with no better success than
before, so that he went away ashamed, confounded, and quite in despair.
It was upon this occasion that Satyrus the player accosted him, and in a
friendly way encouraged him to proceed. With this view he asked him to
re∣peat to him some verses of Sophocles, or Eu∣ripedes, which he
accordingly did: the other repeated them after him, but with such a
dif∣ferent spirit and cadence, as made him sensible that he knew very
little of elocution. But by his instructions, and his own perseverance, he 
<PB N="64" REF="66"/> at length made himself master of it; and by the
methods before mentioned, corrected the im∣perfections which were born with
him, as well as the ill habits which he had contracted. It is not very clear
whether this passage be rightly ascribed to Satyrus, who seems to be
confounded with Neoptolemus and Andronicus, who were likewise famous
comedians; and Demosthenes is said to have been instructed by all the
three.</P>
<P>With these advantages and improvements, he appeared again in
public, and succeeded so well, that people flocked from all parts of Greece
to hear him. From thence he was looked upon as the standard of true
eloquence; inso∣much that none of his countrymen have been put in
comparison with him; nor even among the Romans, any but Cicero. And though it
has been made a question by the ancient writers, to which of the two they
should give the pre∣serence, they have not ventured to decide it, but have
contented themselves with describing their different beauties, and
shewing, that they were both perfect in their kind. His eloquence was grave
and austere, like his temper; mas∣culine and sublime, bold, forcible and
impe∣tuous; abounding with metaphors, apostrophes and interrogations; which,
with his solemn <PB N="65" REF="67"/> way of invoking and appealing to the
gods, the planets, the elements, and the manes of those who fell at Salamis
and Marathon, had such a wonderful effect upon his hearers, that they thought
him inspired. If he had not so much softness and insinuation as is
often requisite in an orator, it was not that he wanted art and de∣licacy,
when the case required it: he knew how to sound the inclinations of the
people, and to lead them to the point he aimed at; and some∣times, by
seeming to propose that which was directly the contrary. But his chief
character∣istic was vehemence, both in action and ex∣pression; and indeed
that was the qualification of all others most wanted at this time: for the
people were grown so insolent and imperious, so factious and divided,
so jealous of the power of the democracy, and withal so sunk into a
state of pleasure and indolence, that no arts of persuasion would have
been so effectual, as that spirit and resolution, that force and energy
of Demosthenes, to humble them, to unite them, and to rouse them into a
sense of their common danger.</P>
<P>But neither could Demosthenes himself have made such
impressions on them, if his talent of speaking had not been supported
by their opi∣nion of his integrity. It was that which added <PB N="66" REF="68"/> weight and emphasis to every thing he said, and animated the
whole. It was that which chiefly engaged their attention, and determined their
counsels; when they were convinced that he spoke from his heart, and had no
interest to manage, but that of the community: and this he gave the
strongest proofs of, in his zeal against Philip, who said, He was of
more weight against him than all the fleets and armies of the Athenians; and
that he had no enemy but Demosthenes. He was not wanting in his en∣deavours
to corrupt him, as he had most of the leading men in Greece: but this great
orator withstood all his offers; and, as it was observed, all the gold in
Macedon could not bribe him.</P>
<P>When Philip found himself shut out of Greece by the Athenians,
he turned his arms against those remote places which depended on them,
either as colonies, or as conquests; and particularly against the
Olynthians, whom he had long looked upon with an evil eye; but had courted and
cajoled them, whilst he was otherwise employed. But he came now re∣solved
entirely to reduce them; and advancing towards the city, only sent them a
short message, to let them know, that one of these two points was
become necessary; either that they must quit Olynthus, or he Macedonia.
Whereupon <PB N="67" REF="69"/> they sent immediately to Athens for relief.
The subject was debated there with great solemnity, and Demosthenes was
very earnest in sending them succours: he was opposed by Demades and
Hyperides. The opinion, however, of Demosthenes prevailed; the people of
Athens resolved to unite against Philip, but the great difficulty lay in
furnishing the supplies: their principal fund, which had formerly served
the purposes of war, had long been converted to the use of the stage. The
money arising from this fund was computed at a thousand talents a-year; and
a certain proportion of it was al∣lotted to the citizens, to defray the charge
of their admittance into the theatre. This distri∣bution having been
continued to them from the time of Pericles, they claimed it now as their
right, especially since they had lately obtained a law, which made it
capital to propose the re∣storing the fund to the uses for which it was
originally granted. Hence it was that, upon any pressing emergency,
extraordinary taxes were to be raised; and they were laid so unequally, and
collected with so much difficulty, that they sel∣dom answered the
service for which they were intended.</P>
<P>Demosthenes treated this subject with the ut∣most art and
circumspection. After shewing that <PB N="68" REF="70"/> the Athenians were
indispensibly obliged to raise an army, in order to stop the
enterprizes of their aspiring enemy, he asserted, that the theatrical
fund was the only probable means of supply. These remonstrances had
some weight, but were not attended with deserved success. The Athenians
sent a reinforcement to Olyn∣thus; but Philip, who had corrupted the
prin∣cipal men in the town, entered, plundered it, and sold the inhabitants
among the rest of the spoil. Here he found much treasure, which served
to assist him in his further encroach∣ments.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Thebans, being unable alone to terminate the
war, which they had so long carried on against the Phocians, addressed
Philip. Hitherto, as we before mentioned, he had observed a kind of
neutrality with respect to the Sacred War; and he seemed to wait for an
opportunity of declaring himself; that is, till both parties should have
weakened themselves by a long war, which equally exhausted both. The
Thebans had now very much abated of that haughtiness, and those ambitious
views, with which the victories of Epaminondas had inspired them. The
instant, therefore, they requested the alliance of Philip, he resolved to
espouse the interest of that republic, in oppo∣sition 
<PB N="69" REF="71"/> to the Phocians. He had not lost sight of the project
he had formed of obtaining an entrance into Greece, in order to make himself
master of it. To give success to his design, it was proper for him to
declare in favour of one of the two parties, which at that time divided all
Greece; that is, either for the Thebans, or the Athenians and Spartans. He was
not so void of sense as to imagine, that the latter party would
assist his design of carrying his arms into Greece. He therefore had no
more to do but to join the Thebans, who offered themselves voluntarily to
him, and who stood in need of Philip's power, to support themselves in
their declining condition: he therefore declared at once in their favour. But
to give a specious colour to his arms, besides the gratitude he affected to
have at heart for Thebes, in which he had been educated, he also pretended to
make an honour of the zeal with which he was fired with regard to the violated
god, and was very glad to pass for a religious prince, who warmly
espoused the cause of the god and of the temple of Delphos, in order to
conciliate, by that means, the esteem and friendship of the Greeks.</P>
<P>There was nothing Philip had more at heart than to possess
himself of Thermopylae, as it <PB N="70" REF="72"/> opened him a passage
into Greece; to appro∣priate all the honour of the Sacred War to him∣self, as
if he had been principal in that affair; and to preside in the Pythian games.
He was therefore desirous of aiding the Thebans, and by their means to
possess himself of Phocis. But then, in order to put this double
design in exe∣cution, it was necessary for him to keep it secret from
the Athenians, who had actually declared war against Thebes; and who, for
many years, had been in alliance with the Phocians. His business,
therefore, was to make them change their measures, by placing other objects
in their view; and, on this occasion, the politics of Philip succeeded to a
wonder.</P>
<P>The Athenians, who began to grow tired of a war, which was very
burthensome, and of little benefit to them, had commissioned
Ctesi∣phon, and Phrynon, to sound the intentions of Philip, and in what
manner he stood disposed in regard to peace. These related, that Philip
did not appear averse to it; and that he even ex∣pressed a great
affection for the commonwealth. Upon this, the Athenians resolved to send a
solemn embassy, to enquire more strictly into the truth of things, and
to procure the last ex∣planations, previously necessary to so
important a negociation. Aeschines and Demosthenes were <PB N="71" REF="73"/> among the ten ambassadors, who brought back three from Philip;
<HI>viz.</HI> Antipater, Parmenio, and Eurylochus. All the ten executed their
commission very faithfully, and gave a very good account of it. Upon this,
they were im∣mediately sent back, with full powers to con∣clude a peace, and
to ratify it by oaths. It was then Demosthenes, who, in his first
em∣bassy, had met some Athenian captives in Ma∣cedonia, and had
promised to return and ransom them at his own expence, endeavoured to
enable himself to keep his word; and, in the mean time, advised his
colleagues to embark with the utmost expedition, as the republic had
com∣manded; and to wait, as soon as possible, upon Philip, in what place
soever he might be. How∣ever, these, instead of making a speedy
dis∣patch, as they were desired, went like ambassa∣dors, proceeded to
Macedonia by land, staid three months in that country, and gave Philip time
to possess himself of several other strong places belonging to the
Athenians in Thrace. At last, meeting with the king of Macedonia, they agreed
with him upon articles of peace; but he, having lulled them asleep with the
specious pre∣tence of a treaty, deferred the ratification of it from day to
day. In the mean time he found means to corrupt the ambassadors, one after
another, <PB N="72" REF="74"/> by presents, Demosthenes excepted; who being
but one, opposed his colleagues to no manner of purpose.</P>
<P>Philip being suffered quietly to pursue his march into Phocis,
gained the streights of Thermopylae, but did not immediately discover what
use he intended to make of his entrance into Greece; but went on, according
to his agreement with the Thebans, to put an end to the Phocian war, which he
easily effected. His name and appearance struck such a terror among the
Phocians, that though they had lately re∣ceived a reinforcement of a thousand
heavy armed Spartans, under the command of their king Archidamus, they declined
giving him battle, and sent to treat with him, or rather to submit
themselves to any terms that he would give them. He allowed Phalicus to
retire, with eight thousand men, being mercenaries, into Peloponesus; but
the rest, who were the in∣habitants of Phocis, were left at his mercy. As the
disposing of them was a matter wherein Greece in general was concerned, he
did not think fit to act in it by his own private autho∣rity, but referred it
to the Amphyctions, whom he caused to be assembled for that purpose.
But they were so much under his influence, that they served only to give a
sanction to his deter∣minations. <PB N="73" REF="75"/> They decreed, that all
the cities of Phocis should be demolished; that they who had fled, as being
principally concerned in the sa∣crilege, should be stigmatized as
accursed, and proscribed as outlaws; that they who remained as inhabitants,
should be dispersed in villages, and obliged to pay out of their lands a
yearly tribute of sixty talents, until the whole of what had been taken out
of the temple should be re∣stored: they were likewise adjudged to lose
their seat in the council of the Amphyctions, wherein they had a double
voice. This Philip got transferred to himself, which was a very material
point, and may be looked upon as the principal step towards his gaining that
authority which he afterwards exercised in the affairs of Greece. At the
same time he gained, in conjunction with the Thebans and Thessalians, the
super∣intendency of the Pythian games, which the Corinthians had forfeited,
for their having taken part with the Phocians.</P>
<P>Philip having, by these plausible methods, succeeded in this
expedition, did not think it adviseable, by attempting any thing further at
present, to sully the glory he had acquired by it, or to incense the body
of the Grecians against him; wherefore he returned, in a tri∣umphant manner,
to his own dominions. After <PB N="74" REF="76"/> settling his conquests at
home, he marched into Thessaly; and having extirpated the remains of
tyranny in the several cities there, he not only confirmed the
Thessalians in his interest, but gained over many of their
neighbours.</P>
<P>It was upon this occasion that Philip is re∣marked for an act of
private justice, which far outweighs his public celebrity. A certain
soldier, in the Macedonian army, had, in many in∣stances, distinguished
himself by extraordinary acts of valour, and had received many marks of
Philip's favour and approbation. On some occasion he embarked on board a
vessel, which was wrecked by a violent storm, and he himself cast on
the shore helpless and naked, and scarcely with the appearance of life. A
Macedonian, whose lands were contiguous to the sea, came opportunely to be
witness of his distress; and, with all humane and charitable
tenderness, flew to the relief of the unhappy stranger. He bore him to his
house, laid him in his own bed, re∣vived, cherished, comforted, and for
forty days supplied him freely with all the necessaries and conveniencies
which his languishing condition could require. The soldier, thus happily
res∣cued from death, was incessant in the warmest expressions of
gratitude to his benefactor, assured him, of his interest with the king,
and of his <PB N="75" REF="77"/> power and resolution of obtaining for him,
from the royal bounty, the noble returns which such extraordinary benevolence
had merited. He was now completely recovered, and his kind host supplied
him with money to pursue his journey. In some time after, he presented
himself before the king; he recounted his mis∣fortunes, magnified his
services; and this in∣human wretch, who had looked with an eye of envy on the
possessions of the man who had preserved his life, was now so
abandoned to all sense of gratitude, as to request the king would
bestow upon him the house and lands where he had been so tenderly and
kindly entertained. Unhappily Philip, without examination, incon∣siderately
and precipitately granted his infa∣mous request; and this soldier now
returned to his preserver, repaid his goodness by driving him from his
settlement, and taking immediate possession of all the fruits of his
honest industry. The poor man, stung with this instance of
un∣paralleled ingratitude and insensibility, boldly determined, instead
of submitting to his wrongs, to seek relief; and, in a letter addressed
to Philip, represented his own, and the soldier's conduct, in a lively and
affecting manner. The king was instantly fired with indignation; he ordered
that justice should be done without <PB N="76" REF="78"/> delay; that the
possessions should be imme∣diately restored to the man whose
charitable offices had been thus horridly repaid; and having seized his
soldier, caused these words to be branded on his forehead—The
Ungrateful Guest;—a character infamous in every age, and among all
nations; but particularly among the Greeks, who, from the earliest times,
were most scrupulously observant of the laws of hos∣pitality.</P>
<P>Having strengthened himself in these parts, he went the next
year into Thrace, where he had formed a design against the Chersonese.
This peninsula had, with some little inter∣ruption, been for many years in
the hands of the Athenians; but Cotys, as being king of the country, had lately
wrested it from them, and left it in succession to his son
Chersobleptes. He not being able to defend himself against Philip, gave
it back to the Athenians, reserving to him∣self only Cardia, the capital
city. But Philip having soon after spoiled him of the rest of his
dominions, the Cardians, for fear of falling again under the power of the
Athenians, threw them∣selves into his protection. Diopithes, who was the
chief of the Athenian colony lately sent to the Chersonese, considered
this proceeding of Philip, in supporting the Cardians, as an act of 
<PB N="77" REF="79"/> hostility against Athens; whereupon he invaded the
maritime parts of Thrace, and carried away a great deal of booty. Philip being
at this time in the upper part of the country, was not in a condition to do
himself justice: but he wrote to complain of it at Athens, as an
in∣fraction of the peace; and his creatures there were not wanting on their
part to aggravate the charge against Diopithes, as having acted with∣out
orders, and taking it upon himself to renew the war: they likewise
accused him of com∣mitting acts of piracy, and of laying their allies under
contribution. But whatever grounds there were for this part of the
accusation, the go∣vernment of Athens was principally to blame in it; for
having no proper fund for the wars, they sent out their generals without
money or provisions, and left them to shift for themselves, and yet made
them answerable for any miscar∣riages that should happen, for want of
their being better supplied. This was a great dis∣couragement to the
service, and put those who were employed in it upon pillaging and
plun∣dering, in such a manner, as they would other∣wise have been ashamed
of. Demosthenes, in an harangue that he made upon the stage of the
Chersonese, undertook the defence of Diopithes.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80"/> Philip, however, was no way intimidated at the
wordy resistance of his eloquent antagonist; he went on with artful
industry, quelling those by his power who were unable to resist, and
those by his presents, whom he was unable to oppose. The divisions that
then subsisted in Peloponesus, gave him a pretext for inter∣meddling in
the affairs of the Greek confe∣deracy. These divisions were chiefly owing
to the Spartans; who, having little to do in the late foreign transactions,
were recovering their strength at home; and, according to their usual
practice, as they increased in power, made use of it to insult and
oppress their neighbours. The Argives and Messenians being at this time
persecuted by them, put themselves under the protection of Philip; and the
Thebans joining with them, they all together formed a powerful confederacy. The
natural balance against it, was an union between Athens and Sparta, which the
Spartans pressed with great earnestness, as the only means for their
common security; and Philip and the Thebans did all in their power to prevent
it. But Demosthenes exerting him∣self upon this occasion, roused up the
Athe∣nians, and put them so far upon their guard, that, without coming to an
open rupture with Philip, they obliged him to desist.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81"/> Philip, however, did not continue idle upon
this disappointment. Ever restless and enter∣prising, he turned his
views another way: he had long considered the island of Eubaea as pro∣per,
from its situation, to favour the designs he meditated against Greece;
and, in the very be∣ginning of his reign, had attempted to possess
himself of it. He indeed set every engine to work at that time, in order to
seize upon that island, which he called the shackles of Greece. But it
nearly concerned the Athenians, on the other side, not to suffer it to fall
into the hands of an enemy, especially as it might be joined to the continent
of Attica, by a bridge: however, that people, according to their usual
custom, continued indolent, whilst Philip pursued his conquests. The
latter, who was continually at∣tentive and vigilant, endeavoured to carry on an
intelligence in the island; and, by dint of presents, bribed those who
had the greatest au∣thority in it. At the request of certain of the
inhabitants, he sent some troops privately thi∣ther, possessed
himself of several strong places, dismantled Porthmos, a very important
fortress in Eubaea, and established three tyrants, or kings, over the
country.</P>
<P>The Athenians were conjured, in this di∣stressing juncture, by
one Plutarch, who was at <PB N="80" REF="82"/> that time upon the island, to
come and deliver the inhabitants from the yoke which Philip was going to
impose upon them. Upon this, they dispatched a few troops thither under the
com∣mand of Phocion, a general of whom great expectations were formed, and
whose conduct well deserved the favourable opinion the public had of
him.</P>
<P>This man would have done honour to the early and least corrupted
times of the Athenian state. His manners were formed in the aca∣demy, upon
the models of the most exact and rigid virtue. It was said, that no
Athenian ever saw him laugh, or weep, or deviate in any instance from the
most fettled gravity and composure. He learned the art of war under
Chabrias, and frequently moderated the ex∣cesses, and corrected the errors
of that general: his humanity he admired and imitated, and taught him to exert
it in a more extensive and liberal manner. When he had received his
di∣rections to sail, with twenty ships, to collect the contributions of the
allies and dependent cities; 
<Q REND="inline">"Why that force?" said Phocion; "if I am to meet
them as enemies, it is insuffi∣cient; if I am sent to friends and allies, a
single vessel will serve."</Q> He bore the seve∣rities of a military
life with so much ease, that <PB N="81" REF="83"/> if Phocion ever appeared
warmly cloathed, the soldiers at once pronounced it the sign of a
re∣markably bad season. His outward appearance was forbidding, but his
conversation easy and obliging; and all his words and actions expressed
the utmost affection and benevolence. In po∣pular assemblies, his lively,
close, and natural manner of speaking, seemed as it were the echo of the
simplicity and integrity of his mind, and had frequently a greater effect
than even the dignity and energy of Demosthenes, who called him the pruner of
his periods. He studied only good sense and plain reasoning, and
despised every adventitious ornament. In an assembly, when he was to
address the people, he was sur∣prised by a friend, wrapped up in thought:

<Q REND="inline">"I am considering," said he, "whether I cannot
retrench some part of my intended address."</Q> He was sensible of the
ill conduct of his country∣men, and ever treated them with the greatest
severity. He defied their censures; and so far did he affect to
despise their applause, that at a time when his sentiments extorted
their appro∣bation, he turned about in surprise, and asked a friend, If
any thing weak or impertinent had escaped him? His sense of the
degeneracy of Athens, made him fond of pacific measures. <PB N="82" REF="84"/>
He saw the designs of Philip, but imagined that the state was too
corrupted to give him any effectual opposition; so that he was of the
number of those men who, according to De∣mosthenes in his third Phillipic
oration, gave up the interests of the state, not corruptly or ignorantly,
but from a desperate purpose of yielding to the fate of a constitution,
thought to be irrecoverably lost. He was of consequence ever of the party
opposite to Demosthenes; and having been taught, by experience, to
suspect the popular leaders, considered his earnestness to rouse
the Athenians to arms, as an artifice to embroil the state, and by that means
to gain an influence in the assembly. 
<Q REND="inline">"Phocion," said Demosthenes, "the people, in
some mad fit, will certainly sacrifice thee to their fury."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes," replied he, "and you will be their victim, if
ever they have an interval of reason."</Q> Yet they often pre∣vailed on him
to act against his judgment, though never to speak against his
conscience. He never refused or declined the command, whatever might be his
opinion of the expe∣dition. Forty five times was he chosen to lead their
armies; generally in his absence, and ever without the least application.
They knew his <PB N="83" REF="85"/> merit; and, in the hour of danger, forgot
that severity with which he usually treated their in∣clinations and
opinions.</P>
<P>It was to him the Athenians gave the com∣mand of the forces they
sent to the aid of Plutarch of Eretria. But this traitor repaid his
benefactors with ingratitude; he set up the stan∣dard against them, and
endeavoured openly to repulse the very army he had requested. How∣ever,
Phocion was not at a loss how to act upon this unforeseen perfidy; for he
pursued his en∣terprise, won a battle, and drove Plutarch from Eretria.</P>
<P>These disappointments, however, no way in∣timidated Philip, or
rendered him the least remiss in prosecuting his original design. He
now, therefore, changed the method of his attack, and sought for an
opportunity of di∣stressing Athens another way. He knew that this city,
from the barrenness of Attica, stood in greater want of foreign corn than
any other. To dispose, at discretion, of their transports, and by that
means starve the Athenians, he marched towards Thrace, from whence that city
imported the greatest part of its provisions, with an intention to
besiege Perinthus and Byzantium. To keep his kingdom in obedience 
<PB N="84" REF="86"/> during his absence, he left his son Alexander be∣hind,
with sovereign authority, though he was fifteen years old. This young prince
gave, even at that time, some proofs of his courage; having defeated certain
neighbouring states, subject to Macedonia, who had considered the king's
absence as a very proper time for exe∣cuting the design they had formed of
revolting. This happy success of Alexander's first expe∣ditions, was
highly agreeable to his father, and at the same time an earnest of what
might be expected from him. But fearing lest, allured by this dangerous bait,
he should abandon himself inconsiderately to his vivacity and fire, he
sent for him in order to become his master; and form him, in person, for
the trade of war.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Philip opened the cam∣paign with the siege of
Perinthus, a consider∣able city of Thrace, and firmly attached to the
Athenians. It was assisted from Byzantium, a neighbouring city, which
threw in succours as occasion required. Philip, therefore, resolved to
besiege both at the same time. Still, how∣ever, he was desirous to appear
cautious and tender of displeasing the Athenians, whom he endeavoured to
amuse with the most profound <PB N="85" REF="87"/> respect, mixed with
well-timed abuses, and the most flattering submission. Upon this
oc∣casion, he wrote them a letter, reproaching them, in the strongest
terms, for their infraction of treaties, and his own religious observance of
them. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the times of great enmity," says he, "the
most you did was to fit out ships of war against me, and to seize and
sell the merchants that came to trade in my domi∣nions; but now you carry
your hatred and injustice to such prodigious lengths, as even to send
ambassadors to the king of Persia, to make him declare against
me."</Q></P>
<P>This letter gave the orators who undertook Philip's defence, a fine
opportunity of justifying him to the people. Demosthenes alone stood
firm, and still continued to expose his artful designs, and to break down
all those laboured schemes which were undertaken to deceive the people.
Sensible, on this occasion, how ne∣cessary it was to remove the first
impressions which the perusal of this letter might make, he immediately
ascended the tribunal, and from thence harangued the people, with all the
thunder of his eloquence. He told them, the letter was written in a style not
suitable to the people of Athens; that it was a plain decla∣ration 
<PB N="86" REF="88"/> of war against them; that Philip had long since made
the same declaration by his actions; and that, by the peace he had concluded
with them, he meant nothing further than a bare cessation of arms, in order
to gain time, and to take them more unprepared. From thence he proceeded to his
usual topic of reproving them for their sloth, for suffering themselves
to be deluded by their orators who were in Philip's pay. 
<Q REND="inline">"Convinced by these truths," continued he, "O
Athenians! and strongly persuaded that we can no longer be allowed to
affirm that we enjoy peace, (for Philip has now de∣clared war against us by
his letter, and has long done the same by his conduct) you ought not to
spare either the public treasure, or the possessions of private
persons, but when occasion shall require, haste to your respective
standards, and set abler generals at your head, than those you have
hitherto employed; for no one among you ought to imagine, that the same men
who have ruined your affairs, will have abilities to restore them to their
former happy situation. Think how infamous it is, that a man from Macedon
should con∣temn dangers to such a degree, that merely to aggrandise his
empire, he should rush into <PB N="87" REF="89"/> the midst of combats,
and return from battle covered with wounds; and that the Athenians, whose
hereditary right it is to obey no man, but to impose law on others, sword
in hand; that Athenians, I say, merely through dejection of spirit and
indolence, should degenerate from the glory of their ancestors, and
aban∣don the interest of their country!"</Q> To this expostulation, Phocion
readily offered his voice and opinion. He urged the incapacity of the generals
already chosen; and, in consequence of his advice, he himself was
appointed general of the army that was to go against Philip, who was still
besieging Byzantium.</P>
<P>Phocion having led his troops to the succour of the Byzantians,
the inhabitants, on his ar∣rival, opened their gates to him with joy, and
lodged his soldiers in their houses, as their own brothers and children.
The Athenian officers and soldiers, struck with the confidence reposed in
them, behaved with the utmost prudence and modesty, and were entirely
irreproachable in their conduct; nor were they less admired for their
courage; and in all the attacks they sustained, discovered the utmost
intrepidity, which danger seemed only to improve. Pho∣cion's prudence,
seconded by the bravery of his <PB N="88" REF="90"/> troops, soon forced
Philip to abandon his de∣sign upon Byzantium and Perinthus. He was beat out
of the Hellespont, which diminished very much his fame and glory; for he
hitherto had been thought invincible, and nothing had been able to oppose
him. Phocion took some of his ships, recovered many fortresses which he
had garrisoned, and having made several descents into different parts of
his territories, he plun∣dered all the open country, till a body of forces
assembling to check his progress, he was obliged to retire.</P>
<P>Philip, after having been forced to raise the siege of
Byzantium, marched against Atheas king of Scythia; from whom he had received
some personal cause of discontent, and took his son with him in this
expedition. Though the Scythians had a very numerous army, he defeated them
without any difficulty: he got a very great booty, which consisted not in
gold or silver, the use and value of which the Scythians were not as yet
so unhappy as to know, but in cattle, in horses, and a great number of
women and children.</P>
<P>At his return from Scythia, the Triballi, a people of Moesia,
disputed the pass with him, laying claim to part of the plunder he was
car∣rying <PB N="89" REF="91"/> off. Philip was forced to come to a battle; and
a very bloody one was fought, in which great numbers on each side were killed
on the spot: the king himself was wounded in the thigh, and, with the
same thrust, had his horse killed under him. Alexander flew to his
father's aid, and covering him with his shield, killed, or put to flight all
who attacked him.</P>
<P>The Athenians had considered the siege of Byzantium as an
absolute rupture, and an open declaration of war. The king of Macedon, who
was apprehensive of the consequences of it, and dreaded very much the power
of the Athenians, whose hatred he had drawn upon himself, made overtures of
peace, in order to soften their re∣sentment. Phocion, little
suspicious, and ap∣prehensive of the uncertainty of military wants, was
of opinion, that the Athenians should accept his offers: but Demosthenes,
who had studied more than Phocion the genius and character of Philip, and was
persuaded that, according to his usual custom, his only view was to
impose upon the Athenians, prevented their listening to his pacific
proposals. When Philip found the Athenians would not treat with him, and that
they were acting offensively against him, es∣pecially at sea, where
they blocked up his <PB N="90" REF="92"/> ports, and put an entire stop to his
commerce, he began to form new alliances against them, particularly with the
Thebans and Thessalians, without whom he knew he could not keep open his
passage into Greece. At the same time he was sensible, that his
engaging these powers to act directly against Athens, and in his own
per∣sonal quarrel, would have so bad an aspect, that they would not
easily come into it. For which reason he endeavoured, underhand, to create
new disturbances in Greece, that he might take such a part in them, as
would best answer his views: and when the flame was kindled, his point was
to appear rather to be called in as an assistant, than to act as a
principal.</P>
<P>By the result of his machinations, he soon found an opportunity
of raising divisions be∣tween the Locrians of Amphissa, and their
ca∣pital city. They were accused of having pro∣faned a spot of sacred
ground, (which lay very near the temple of Delphos), by ploughing it, as the
Phocians had done upon a former occa∣sion. In order to produce and widen this
breach, Philip employed Aeschines the orator, who by bribes was entirely
devoted to him, to harangue at the assembly of the Amphyctions against
this outrage upon the religion of their <PB N="91" REF="93"/> country.
Aeschines was a man of great abilities, and only second in eloquence to
Demosthenes. He had now a fair opportunity of raising com∣motions, by
appearing only interested for his country, and zealous for the glory and
defence of Athens. With a passionate warmth, which is frequently the effect
of artifice as well as of real patriotism, and which is most likely to
de∣ceive, and more particularly in popular assem∣blies, by being
considered as the indication of sincerity, and the overflowings of a heart
ho∣nestly affected, he boldly delivered his opi∣nions. His sentiments were
echoed through the assembly by the friends of Philip; the tu∣mult was kept
up to drown all remonstrances of caution and policy, and a resolution was
passed, that a deputation should be sent to Philip king of Macedon,
inviting him to assist Apollo and the Amphyctions, and to repel the
outrages of the impious Amphissoeans; and far∣ther to declare, that he was
constituted, by all the Greeks, member of the council of Amphyctions, and
general and commander of their forces, with full and unlimited powers.</P>
<P>This welcome invitation and commission, the fruit of all his
secret practices, Philip received in Thrace, while he was yet on his return
to <PB N="92" REF="94"/> Macedon. He bowed with an affectionate re∣verence to
the venerable council, and declared his readiness to execute their
orders.</P>
<P>The inferior states of Greece, and all those whose
simplicity and weakness rendered them insensible to the designs now
forming by Philip, entirely approved of the act of the Amphyctions; and of the
nomination of a prince to the com∣mand of their forces, so eminent and
illustrious for his piety, and so capable of executing the vengeance of
Heaven. At Sparta and at Athens, this event was considered in a different
manner. The first of these people, though pos∣sessed but of a
small part of their ancient great∣ness, yet still retained their pride,
and seemed to have looked with a sullen indignation at the ho∣nours paid to
Macedon: the Athenians had been long taught to dread the policy of Philip, and
now their great popular leader repeatedly urged the necessity of
suspicion, and represented all the late transactions in the
Amphyctionic council as the effects of Philip's intrigues, and a design
against Greece in general, but more particularly against the welfare and
liberty of Athens.</P>
<P>To counteract the zeal of Demosthenes, and to prevent the effects
of his incessant remon∣strances, <PB N="93" REF="95"/> the minds of the
people were alarmed with oracles and predictions, uttered with all solemnity
from the sacred tripod, and reported to the Athenians with all the veneration
due to the dictates of Apollo. Vengeance was pro∣nounced against all those
who should presume to oppose the king of Macedon, the destined
in∣strument of Divine Justice; and the people were exhorted not to suffer
artful and designing ora∣tors, and popular leaders, to seduce them to their
ruin.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Philip immediately got his troops together, and,
with all the show of re∣ligious veneration, began to march, in order to
chastise the irreverent Locrians: but he had far different aims; and
instead of proceeding upon so ridiculous a commission, made a sudden
turn, and seized upon Elatea, a capital city of Phocis, which was very well
situated for awing the Thebans, of whom he began to grow jea∣lous, and for
preparing his way to Athens. But by so extraordinary a step as this, he
fairly threw off the mask, and bade defiance to the whole body of Grecians.
Thus was this enter∣prising prince, all of a sudden, master of a port of
the utmost consequence; at the head of an army, capable of striking
terror into his op∣posers; at the distance of but two days march 
<PB N="94" REF="96"/> from Attica; absolute commander, as it were, of the
citadel and fortress, both of Thebes and Athens; conveniently situated for
receiving succours from Thessaly and Macedon; and en∣tirely at liberty
either to give battle to those who might presume to appear in arms
against him, or to protract the war to any length that might be found
convenient.</P>
<P>The news of Philip's recent transaction was quickly spread
through the adjacent countries, and received with all the stupid and
helpless astonishment of men roused from a long le∣thargy, and awakened
to a dreadful sense of their danger, and of the real designs of their
enemy. It was late in the evening when a cou∣rier arriving at Athens, appeared
before the Prytanes, and pronounced the dreadful tidings, that the king of
Macedon had taken possession of Elatea. These magistrates, and all
the other citizens, were now at supper, indulging them∣selves in the
pleasures and gaieties of the table, when the news, which in an instant
rung through all the city, roused them from their state of ease, and put
an end to all their sestivity. The streets and public places were
instantly filled with a distracted concourse; every man with terror and
confusion in his countenance, and every man solicitous for an immediate
con∣sultation, <PB N="95" REF="97"/> on an emergency so important and
alarming. At the dawn of the succeeding day, the assembly met together,
impressed with that consternation which urgent danger naturally
inspires. The whole body of the people flocked to the senate-house,
seized their places, and waited with the utmost anxiety for so important
a deliberation. The herald, as was the custom at Athens, arose, and cried
out with a loud voice, 
<Q REND="inline">"Who among you will ascend the tri∣bunal?"</Q> All
however was silence, terror and dismay: he again repeated the invitation;
but still no one rose up, though all the generals and orators were
present. At length Demosthenes, animated with the greatness of the
approach∣ing danger, arose, undaunted and unmoved in this scene of horror.
With a countenance of serenity, the firm composure of a patriot, and the
sage discernment of a complete states∣man, he addressed himself
to the assembly, in the following manner:—
<Q REND="inline">"Athenians! permit me to explain the circumstances
of that state which Philip has now seized upon. Those of its citizens
whom his gold could corrupt, or his artifice deceive, are all at his devotion.
What then is his design? By drawing up his forces, and displaying his
powers on the bor∣ders of Thebes, he hopes to inspire his ad∣herents 
<PB N="96" REF="98"/> with confidence and elevation, and to terrify and controul
his adversaries, that fear or force may drive them into those measures
which they have hitherto opposed. If then we are resolved, in this
conjuncture, to cherish the remembrance of every act of unkindness, which
the Thebans have done to Athens; if we regard them with suspicion, as men
who have ranged themselves on the side of our enemy; in the first place,
we shall act agree∣ably to Philip's warmest wishes; and then I am
apprehensive, that the party, who now oppose him, may be brought over to
his in∣terest; the whole city submit unanimously to his direction; and
Thebes and Macedon fall, with their united force, on Attica. Grant the due
attention to what I shall now propose; let it be calmly weighed, without
dispute or cavil, and I doubt not but that my counsels may direct you to
the best and most salutary measures, and dispel the dangers now
im∣pending over the state. What then do I re∣commend?—First, shake
off that terror which hath possessed your minds; and, instead of
fearing for yourselves, let the Thebans be the objects of your
apprehensions: they are more immediately affected; they are the first to
feel the dangers. In the next place, all those of <PB N="97" REF="99"/> the
age for military service, both infantry and cavalry, should march
instantly to Eleusis, that Greece may see, that you are also
as∣sembled in arms; and your friends in Thebes be emboldened to assert
their rights, when they are assured, that as they who have sold their
country to the Macedonians, have a force at Elatea to support them, so you
are ready to assist the men who bravely contend for liberty. In the
last place, I recommend to you to nominate ten ambassadors, who, with the
generals, may have full authority to determine the time, and all other
circum∣stances of this march. When these ambassa∣dors arrive at Thebes,
how are they to con∣duct this great affair? This is a point worthy of your
most serious attention. Make no demands of the Thebans; at this conjuncture
it would be dishonourable: assure them that your assistance is
ready for their acceptance, as you are justly affected by their danger, and
have been so happy as to foresee and to guard against it. If they approve
of your sentiments, and embrace your overtures, we shall effect our great
purpose, and act with a dignity worthy of our state. But should it happen
that we are not so successful, what∣ever misfortunes they may suffer,
to them∣selves <PB N="98" REF="100"/> shall they be imputed; while your
con∣duct shall appear, in no one instance, incon∣sistent with the
honour and renown of Athens."</Q></P>
<P>This oration, delivered with ease and reso∣lution, did not want
its due effect; it was re∣ceived with universal applause, and Demosthenes
himself was instantly chosen to head the embassy which he had now
proposed. A decree, in pur∣suance of his advice, was drawn up in form; with
an additional clause, that a fleet of two hundred sail should be fitted
out, to cruize near Thermopylae.</P>
<P>In consequence of this, Demosthenes set out for Thebes, making
the more haste, as he was sensible that Philip might over-run Attica in
two days. Philip, on the other hand, in order to oppose the eloquence of
Demosthenes, sent ambassadors to Thebes, among whom was Python, who
particularly distinguished himself by the liveliness of his orations.
But his per∣suasive powers were far inferior to those of Demosthenes,
who overcame all opposition. The masculine eloquence of Demosthenes was
ir∣resistible; and kindled in the souls of the The∣bans so warm a zeal
for their country, and so strong a passion for freedom, that they were
no longer masters of themselves; laying aside all <PB N="99" REF="101"/>
fear and gratitude, and all prudential con∣siderations.</P>
<P>That which animated Demosthenes, next to his public safety, was
his having to do with a man of Python's abilities; and he some time after
took occasion to value himself upon the victory he had obtained over him, 
<Q REND="inline">"I did not give way," said he, "to the boasting
Python, when he would have bore me down with a torrent of words."</Q> He
gloried more in the success of this negociation, than of any other he had
been employed in, and spoke of it as his masterpiece in politics.</P>
<P>Philip, quite disconcerted by the union of these two nations,
sent ambassadors to the Athenians, to request them not to levy an armed
force, but to live in harmony with him. How∣ever, they were too justly
alarmed and exas∣perated, to listen to any accommodation; and would no
longer depend on the word of a prince, whose whole aim was to deceive. In
conse∣quence, preparations for war were made with the utmost diligence, and
the soldiery discovered incredible ardour. However, many evil-dis∣posed
persons endeavoured to extinguish or damp it, by relating fatal omens, and
terrible pre∣dictions, which the priestess of Delphos was said to have
uttered. But Demosthenes, con∣fiding <PB N="100" REF="102"/> firmly in the
arms of Greece, and en∣couraged wonderfully by the number and bra∣very of the
troops, who desired only to march against the enemy, would not suffer
them to be amused with these oracles and frivolous pre∣dictions. It was on
this occasion, he said, that the priestess Philipized; meaning, that it
was Philip's money that inspired the priestess, opened her mouth, and
made the god speak whatever she thought proper. He bade the Thebans
remember their Epaminondas, and the Athe∣nians their Pericles; who considered
these ora∣cles and predictions as idle scare-crows, and consulted only
their reason. The Athenian army set out immediately, and marched to
Eleusis; and the Thebans, surprised at the diligence of their
confederates, joined them, and waited the approach of the enemy.</P>
<P>Philip, on his part, well knowing that the bravery and spirit of
his enemies wanted that direction which might enable them to improve their
advantages, and conscious also of his own abilities, and the weakness of
those generals who commanded the Greeks, determined to bring on a general
engagement, where his superior skill must appear of the greatest
moment. For this purpose he took a favourable opportunity of decamping, and
led his army to the plain of <PB N="101" REF="103"/> Chaeronea, a name rendered
famous by the event of this important contest. Here he chose his station,
in view of a temple dedicated to Hercules, the author of his race, as if
resolved to fight in his presence; to make him witness of the actions of
his descendant, and to com∣mit his forces, and his cause, to the immediate
protection of this hero. Some ancient oracles were preserved, which seemed
to point out the spot on which he now encamped, as the scene of some
dreadful calamity to Greece.</P>
<P>His army was formed of thirty-two thou∣sand men, warlike,
disciplined, and long enur∣ed to the toils and dangers of the field; but this
body was composed of different nations and countries, who had each their
distinct, and separate views and interests. The army of the confederates
did not amount to thirty thousand complete; of which the Athenians and
Thebans furnished the greatest part: the rest was formed of the
Corinthians and Pelo∣ponesians. The same motives, and the same zeal,
influenced and animated them. All were equally affected by the event; and all
equally resolved to conquer or die in defence of liberty.</P>
<P>On the eve of the decisive day, Diogenes, the famous cynic, who
had long looked with <PB N="102" REF="104"/> equal contempt on either party, was
led by curiosity to visit the camps as an unconcerned spectator. In the
Macedonian camp, where his character and person were not known, he was
stopped by the guards, and conducted to Philip's tent. The king expressed
surprise at a stranger's presuming to approach his camp; and asked,
with severity, Whether he came as a spy? 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes," said Diogenes, "I am come to spy upon
your vanity and ambition, who thus wantonly set your life and kingdom to the
hazard of an hour."</Q></P>
<P>And now the fatal morning appeared, which was for ever to decide the
cause of liberty, and the empire of Greece. Before the rising of the sun,
both armies were ranged in order of battle. The Thebans, commanded by
Theogenes, a man of but moderate abilities in war, and su∣spected of
corruption, obtained the post of honour on the right wing of the confederated
Greeks; with that famous body in the front, called the Sacred Band, formed of
generous and warlike youths, connected and endeared to each other by all the
noble enthusiasm of love and friendship. The center was formed of the
Corinthians and Peloponesians; and the Athenians composed the left wing,
led by their generals, Lysicles and Chares. On <PB N="103" REF="105"/> the
left of the Macedonian army stood Alexander, at the head of a chosen body
of noble Macedo∣nians, supported by the famous cavalry of Thessaly. As
this prince was then but nineteen years old, his father was careful to curb his
youthful impetuosity, and to direct his valour; and for this purpose
surrounded him with a number of experienced officers. In the center were
placed those Greeks who had united with Philip, and on whose courage he had
the least dependence; while the king himself command∣ed on the right wing,
where his renowned phalanx stood, to oppose the impetuosity with which
the Athenians were well known to begin their onset.</P>
<P>The charge began on each side with all the courage and violence
which ambition, revenge, the love of glory, and the love of liberty, could
excite in the several combatants. Alexander, at the head of the Macedonian
nobles, first fell, with all the fury of youthful courage, on the Sacred Band
of Thebas; which sustained his attack with a bravery and vigour worthy of
its former fame. The gallant youths who com∣posed this body, not being
timely, or not duly supported by their countrymen, bore up for a while
against the torrent of the enemy; till at <PB N="104" REF="106"/> length,
oppressed and overpowered by supe∣rior numbers, without yielding or
turning their backs on their assailants; they sunk down on that ground
where they had been originally stationed, each by the side of his darling
friend, raising up a bulwark by their bodies against the progress of the
army. But the young prince and his forces, in all the enthusiastic ardor of
valour, animated by success, pushed on through all the carnage, and over
all the heaps of slain, and fell furiously on the main body of the Thebans;
where they were opposed with obstinate and deliberate cou∣rage, and the
contest was for some time sup∣ported with mutual violence.</P>
<P>The Athenians at the same time on the right wing, fought with a
spirit and intrepidity, worthy of the character which they boasted, and of
the cause by which they were animated. Many brave efforts were exerted on
each side, and success was for some time doubtful; till at length part
of the center, and the left wing of the Macedonians, (except the phalanx)
yielded to the impetuous attack of the Athenians, and fled with some
precipitation. Happy had it been on that day for Greece, if the conduct and
abilities of the Athenian generals had been equal to the valour of their
soldiers! but these brave <PB N="105" REF="107"/> champions of liberty were
led on by the de∣spicable creatures of intrigue and cabal. Trans∣ported by
the advantage now obtained, the presumptuous Lysicles cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Come on, my gallant countrymen; the victory is
ours; let us pursue these cowards, and drive them to Macedon:"</Q> and
thus, instead of im∣proving their happy opportunity, by charging the phalanx
in flank, and so breaking this formidable body, the Athenians wildly and
precipitately pressed forward, in pursuit of the flying enemy;
themselves in all the tumult and disorder of a rout. Philip saw this
fatal error with the contempt of a skilful general, and the secret
exultation arising from the assu∣rance of approaching victory. He coolly
ob∣served to those officers that stood round him, That the Athenians knew
not how to conquer; and ordered his phalanx to change its position, and, by a
sudden evolution, to gain possession of an adjacent eminence. From
thence they marched deliberately down, firm and collected, and fell, with their
united force, on the Athe∣nians, now confident of success, and blind to
their danger. The shock was irresistible; they were at once overwhelmed;
many of them lay crushed by the weight of the enemy, and expiring by their
wounds; while the rest escaped <PB N="106" REF="108"/> from the dreadful
slaughter, by a shameful and precipitate flight; bearing down, and hurrying
away with them, those troops which had been stationed for their support.
And here the re∣nowned orator and statesman, whose noble sentiments and
spirited harangues had raised the courage on this day so eminently
exerted, betrayed that weakness which has sullied his great character. He
alone, of all his country∣men, advanced to the charge, cold and dis∣mayed;
and, at the very first appearance of a reverse of fortune, in an agony of
terror, turned his back, cast away that shield which he had adorned with
this inscription, in golden characters, To Good Fortune; and appeared the
foremost in the general rout. The ridicule and malice of his enemies,
related, or perhaps invented another shameful circumstance; that being
impeded in his flight by some brambles, his imagination was so
possessed with the pre∣sence of an enemy, that he loudly cried out
for quarter.</P>
<P>While Philip was thus triumphant on his side, Alexander continued
the conflict on the other wing, and at length broke the Thebans in spight of
all their acts of valour, who now fled from the field, and were pursued with
great carnage. The center of the confederates was <PB N="107" REF="109"/> thus
totally abandoned to the fury of a victori∣ous enemy. But enough of slaughter
had al∣ready been made; more than one thousand of the Athenians lay dead on
the field of battle, two thousand were made prisoners, and the loss of
the Thebans was not inferior. Philip therefore determined to conclude his
important victory, by an act of apparent clemency, which his ambition and
policy really dictated. He gave orders that the Greeks should be spared,
conscious of his own designs, and still expect∣ing to appear in the field
the head and leader of that body which he had now completely subdued.</P>
<P>Philip was transported with this victory be∣yond measure, and
having drank to excess at an entertainment which he gave upon that
oc∣casion, went into the field of battle, where he insulted over the
slain, and upbraided the pri∣soners with their misfortunes. He leaped and
danced about in a frantic manner, and with an air of burlesque merriment
sung the beginning of the decree, which Demosthenes had drawn up as a
declaration of the war against him. Demades, who was of the number of the
prisoners, had the courage to reproach him with this unge∣nerous behaviour,
telling him, That fortune had given him the part of Agamemnon, but 
<PB N="108" REF="110"/> that he was acting that of Thersites. He was so
struck with the justness of this reproof, that it wrought a thorough
change in him; and he was so far from being offended at Demades, that he
immediately gave him his liberty, and shewed him afterwards great marks of
honour and friendship. He likewise relieved all the Athenian captives, and
without ransom; and when they found him so generously disposed
towards them, they made a demand of their baggage, with every thing else that
had been taken from them; but to that Philip replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"Surely they think I have not beat them."</Q> This
discharge of the prisoners was ascribed in a great measure to Demades,
who is said to have new-modelled Philip. and to have soften∣ed his temper
with the Attic graces, as Dio∣dorus expresses it: indeed Philip himself
acknow∣ledged upon another occasion, that his fre∣quent converse with the
Athenian orators, had been of great use to him in correcting his mo∣rals.
Justin represents his carriage after the battle in a very different light;
alleging that he took abundance of pains to dissemble his joy; that he
affected great modesty and compassion, and was not seen to laugh; that
he would have no sacrisice, no crowns nor perfumes; that he forbade all
kinds of sports; and did nothing <PB N="109" REF="111"/> that might make him
appear to the conquerors to be elated, nor to the conquered, to be in∣solent.
But this account seems to have been confounded with others which were given
of him, after his being reformed by Demades. It is certain that after his
first transport was over, and that he began to recollect himself, he
shewed great humanity to the Athenians; and that in order still to keep
measures with them, he renewed the peace. But the The∣bans, who had renounced
their alliance with him, he treated in another manner. He who affected to be as
much master of his allies as of his subjects, could not easily pardon
those who had deserted him in so critical a conjunc∣ture. Wherefore he
not only took ransom for their prisoners, but made them pay for leave to
bury their dead. After these severities, and after having placed a strong
garrison over them, he granted them a peace.</P>
<P>We are told that Isocrates, the most cele∣brated rhetorician of
that age, who loved his country with the utmost tenderness, could not
survive the loss and ignominy with which it was covered, by the loss of
the battle of Chaeronea. The instant he received the news of its being
uncertain what use Philip would make of his victory, and determined to die a 
<PB N="110" REF="112"/> freeman, he hastened his end by abstaining from
food; he was fourscore and eighteen years of age. This defeat was attributed
chief∣ly to the ill conduct of the Generals Lysicles and Chares; the former
whereof the Athenians put to death at the instance of Lycurgus, who had great
credit and influence with the people, but was a severe judge, and a most
bitter accuser. 
<Q REND="inline">"You Lysicles, said he, were general of the
army; a thousand citizens were slain, two thousand taken prisoners; a
trophy has been erected to the dishonour of this city, and all Greece is
enslaved. You had the command when all these things happened; and yet you
dare to live, and view the light of the sun, and blush not to appear
publicly in the forum; you Lysicles, who are born the monu∣ment of your
country's shame!"</Q> This Lycur∣gus was one of the orators of the first
rank, and free from the general corruption which then reigned among them. He
managed the public treasure for twelve years with great uprightness, and
had all his life long the re∣putation of a man of honour and virtue. He
encreased the shipping, supplied the arsenal, drove the bad men out of
the city, and fram∣ed several good laws. He kept an exact re∣gister of
every thing he did during his ad∣ministration; <PB N="111" REF="113"/> and
when that was expired, he caused it to be fixed up to a pillar, that every
body might be at liberty to inspect it, and to censure his conduct. He
carried this point so far, that, in his last sickness he ordered
him∣self to be carried to the Senate-house to give a public account of all
his actions, and after he had refuted one who accused him there, he went home
and died. Notwithstanding the austerity of his temper, he was a great
en∣courager of the stage; which though it had been carried to an excess
that was manifestly hurtful to the public, he still looked upon as the
best school to instruct and polish the minds of the people. And to this
end, he kept up a spirit of emulation among the writers of Tragedy, and
erected the statues of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. He left three
sons who were unworthy of him, and behaved so ill, that they were all put
in prison; but Demosthenes, out of regard to the memory of their father,
got them discharged.</P>
<P>It does not appear that Chares underwent any prosecution for his
share of this action; though according to his general character, he
deserved it as much or more than his colleague. For he had no talent for
command, and was very little different from a common soldier. 
<PB N="112" REF="114"/> Timotheus said of him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That instead of being a general, he was fitter to
carry the general's baggage."</Q> His person indeed was of that robust kind
of make; and it was that which served in some measure to recommend him to
the people. But he was more a man of pleasure than fatigue. In his military
expe∣ditions, he was wont to carry with him a band of music; and he defrayed
the expence of it out of the soldiers' pay. Notwithstanding his want of
abilities, he had a thorough good opi∣nion of himself. He was vain and
positive, bold and boisterous; a great undertaker, and always ready to
warrant success; but his per∣formances seldom answered; and hence it
was, that the promises of Chares became a proverb: And yet as little as he
was to be depended on, he had his partizans among the people, and among the
orators, by whose means he got himself to be frequently employed, and
others to be excluded who were more capable.</P>
<P>But it was Demosthenes who seemed to have been the principal
cause of the terrible shock which Athens received at this time, and which
gave its power such a wound, as it never reco∣vered. However, at the very
instant the Athe∣nians heard of this bloody overthrow, which affected so
great a number of families, when it <PB N="113" REF="115"/> would have been no
wonder, had the multi∣tude, seized with terror and alarms, given way to an
emotion of blind zeal, against the man whom they might have considered in
some mea∣sure as the author of this dreadful calamity; even at this very
instant, I say, the people sub∣mitted entirely to the councils of
Demosthenes. The precautions that were taken to post guards to raise the
walls, and to repair the ditches, were all in consequence of his advice. He
himself was appointed to supply the city with provisions, and to repair
the walls, which latter commission he executed with so much
genero∣sity, that it acquired him the greatest honour; and for which, at
the request of Ctesiphon, a crown of gold was decreed him as a reward for
his having presented the commonwealth with a sum of money out of his own
estate, suffici∣ent to defray what was wanting of the sums for repairing
the walls.</P>
<P>On the present occasion, that is, after the battle of Chaeronea,
such orators as opposed Demosthenes, having all risen up in concert
against him, and having cited him to take his trial according to law, the
people not only de∣clared him innocent of the several accusations laid to
his charge, but conferred more honours upon him than he had enjoyed before;
so <PB N="114" REF="116"/> strongly did the veneration they had for his zeal
and fidelity overbalance the efforts of calumny and malice.</P>
<P>But the people did not stop here. The bones of such as had been
killed in the battle of Chaeronea having been brought to Athens to be interred,
they appointed Demosthenes to compose the eulogium of those brave men; a
manifest proof that they did not ascribe to him the ill success of the
battle, but to Provi∣dence only, who disposes of human events at
pleasure.</P>
<P>It was in this year that Aeschines drew up an accusation
against Ctesiphon, or rather against Demosthenes, which was the most
remarkable that ever appeared before any tribunal; not so much for the object
of the contest, as for the greatness and ability of the speakers.
Ctesiphon, a partizan and friend of Demost∣henes, brought a cause before
the assembly of the people, in which he urged that a decree should be
passed, giving a golden crown to Demosthenes. This decree was strongly
op∣posed by Aeschines, the rival of Demosthenes, as well in eloquence as
in ambition.</P>
<P>No cause ever excited so much curiosity, nor was pleaded with
so much pomp. Peo∣ple flocked to it from all parts, and <PB N="115" REF="117"/> they had great reason for so doing; for what sight could be
nobler, than a conflict be∣tween two orators, each of them excellent in his
way, both formed by nature, im∣proved by art, and animated by perpetual
dissentions, and an implacable animosity against each other.</P>
<P>The juncture seemed to favour Aeschines very much; for the
Macedonian party, whom he al∣ways befriended, was very powerful in Athens,
especially after the ruin of Thebes. Never∣theless Aeschines lost his
cause, and was justly sentenced to banishment for his rash
accusation. He thereupon went, and settled himself in Rhodes, where he
opened a school of elo∣quence, the fame and glory of which con∣tinued for
many ages. He began his lectures with the two orations that had occasioned
his banishment. Great encomiums were given to that of Aeschines; but when
they heard that of Demosthenes, the plaudits and acclamations were redoubled.
And it was then he spoke these words, so greatly laudable in the mouth of
an enemy and a rival: 
<Q REND="inline">"Alas! what applauses would you not have
bestowed, had you heard Demosthenes speak it himself?"</Q></P>
<P>Demosthenes thus become victor, made a good use of his
conquest. For the instant Aeschines left <PB N="116" REF="118"/> Athens,
in order to embark for Rhodes, De∣mosthenes ran after him, and forced him to
ac∣cept of a purse of money. On this occasion, Aeschines cried out, How
will it be possible for me not to regret a country, in which I leave an
enemy more generous, than I can hope to find friends in any other part of the
world?</P>
<P>In the mean time, Philip had his ambition pleased, but not
satisfied with his last victory; he had one object long in view, and that
he never lost sight of; this was to get himself ap∣pointed in the
Assembly of the Greeks, their chief general against the Persians. It
had long been the object, not only of the confederate states, but also of
the neighbouring Greek nations, to revenge upon the kingdom of Per∣sia, the
injuries they had sustained from it; and to work the total destruction of
that Empire. This was an object which had early inflamed the mind of Philip,
and his late victory paved the way to it. He therefore got himself de∣clared
Generalissimo of the Greek forces, and accordingly made preparations to
invade that mighty Empire.</P>
<P>But whilst Philip was thus successful in poli∣tics and war,
the domestic divisions that reign∣ed in his family, embittered his
happiness, and at last caused his destruction. He had mar∣ried 
<PB N="117" REF="119"/> Olympias, the daughter of the king of Epirus, and the
early part of their union was crowned with happiness; but her ill temper
soon clouded that dawn which promised so much felicity; she was
naturally jealous, vin∣dictive and passionate, and their dissentions
were carried to such a degree, that Philip was often heard to wish for
death. But his passion for Cleopatra, niece to Attalus, his general,
com∣pleted their separation. As Cleopatra was no less amiable in her temper
and accomplish∣ments than in the extraordinary graces of her person, Philip
conceived that he should con∣sult his own happiness most effectually,
by form∣ing an inviolable and perpetual union with this lady; and, without the
least hesitation, resolv∣ed to separate himself for ever from the
prin∣cess who had long appeared so great an enemy to his tranquillity. In
vain did Alexander his son remonstrate, that by divorcing Olympias, and
engaging in a second marriage, he exposed him to the danger of contending
with a num∣ber of competitors for the crown, and render∣ed his succession
precarious. 
<Q REND="inline">"My son, said the king, if I create you a number
of competi∣tors, you will have the glorious opportunity of exerting yourself
to surpass them in merit. Thus shall their rivalship by no means affect
<PB N="118" REF="120"/> your title."</Q> His marriage with Cleopatra was now
declared in form, and celebrated with all the grandeur and solemnity which
the great occasion demanded. The young prince how∣ever dissatisfied, was
yet obliged to attend on these solemnities, and sat in silent
indignation at that feast which proclaimed the disgrace of his mother. In
such circumstances, his youth∣ful and impetuous mind could not but be
su∣sceptible of the slightest irritation. Attalus the uncle of the new
queen, forgetting that just caution, which should have taught him to be
scrupulously observant to avoid offending the prince, intoxicated by the
honours paid to his kinswoman, as well as by the present festi∣vity, was
rash enough to call publicly on the Macedonian nobles to pour out their
libations to the gods, that they might grant the king the happy fruits of the
present nuptials, and legitimate heirs to his throne. Wretch! cried
Alexander, with his eyes sparkling with that fury and vexation which he had
till now sup∣pressed, dost thou then call me bastard? and instantly
darted his goblet at Attalus, who re∣turned the outrage with double violence.
Cla∣mour and confusion arose, and the king, in a sudden fit of rage,
snatched his sword, and flew directly towards his son. His
precipita∣tion, <PB N="119" REF="121"/> his lameness, and the quantity of wine
in which he had by this time indulged, hap∣pily disappointed his rash
purpose; he stum∣bled and fell on the floor, while Alexander, with an
unpardonable insolence, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Behold, ye Macedonians! this is the king who is
preparing to lead you into Asia; see where in passing from one table to
another, he is fallen to the ground."</Q></P>
<P>Philip however, did not lose sight of the con∣quests of
Asia. Full of the mighty project he re∣volved, he consulted the gods to
know what would be the event of it; and the priestess replied, The victim
is already crowned, his end draws nigh, and he will soon be sacrificed.
Philip hearing this, did not hesitate a moment, but interpreted the oracle in
his own favour; the ambiguity of which ought at least to have kept him in
some suspence. In order therefore, that he might be in a condition to
apply entirely to his expedi∣tion against the Persians, and elevate
himself solely to the conquest of Asia, he dispatched with all
possible diligence his domestic affairs. After this, he offered up a
solemn sacrifice to the gods; and prepared to celebrate with incredible
magnificence in Egae, a city of Macedonia, the nuptials of Cleopatra his
daughter, whom he gave in marriage to Alexander king of Epirus, 
<PB N="120" REF="122"/> and brother to Olympias his queen. He had invited to it
the most considerable persons of Greece, and heaped upon them
friendship and honours of every kind, by way of gratitude for electing him
Generalissimo of the Greeks. The cities made their court to him in
emulation of each other, by sending him gold crowns; and Athens
distinguished its zeal above all the rest. Neoptolemus, the poet, had
written purposely for that festival, a tragedy entitled Cinyras, in which
under borrowed names, he represented this prince as already victor over
Darius, and master of Asia. Philip listened to these happy presages
with joy; and, comparing them with the answer of the oracle, assured
himself of conquest. The day after the nuptials, games, and shows were
solemnized. As these formed part of the religious worship, there were
car∣ried in it, with great pomp and ceremony, twelve statues of the gods,
carved with in∣imitable art; a thirteenth that surpassed them all in
magnificence, represented Philip as a god. The hour for his leaving the
palace arrived, he went forth in a white robe; and advanced with an air of
majesty, in the midst of acclamations, towards the theatre, where an
infinite multitude of Mace∣donians, <PB N="121" REF="123"/> as well as
foreigners, waited his coming with impatience.</P>
<P>But this magnificence only served to make the catastrophe more
remarkable, and to add splendor to ruin. Some time before, Attalus, inflamed
with wine at an entertainment, had insulted in the most shocking manner
Pausanias a young Macedonian nobleman. The latter had long endeavoured to
revenge the cruel affront, and was perpetually imploring the king's justice.
But Philip, unwilling to disgust Attalus, uncle to Cleopatra, whom, as was
before observed, he had married after his divorcing Olympias his first
queen, would never listen to Pausanias's complaints. However, to console
him in some measure, and to express the high esteem he had for, and the
great confidence he reposed in him, he made him one of the chief officers of
his life-guard. But this was not what the young Macedonian required, whose
anger now swelling to fury against his judge, he formed the design of
wiping out his shame, by imbruing his hands in the blood of his
sovereign.</P>
<P>And now while this unhappy youth continu∣ed brooding over those
malignant passions which distracted and corroded his mind, he happened to
go into the school of one Hermo∣crates, who professed to teach
philosophy; to <PB N="122" REF="124"/> whom he proposed the following
question: What shall that man do, who wishes to trans∣mit his name with
lustre to posterity? Hermo∣crates, either artfully and from design, or
the natural malignity of his temper, replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"He must kill him who hath atchieved the
greatest actions; thus shall the memory of the hero be joined with his who
slew him, and both de∣scend together to posterity."</Q> This was a maxim
highly agreeable to Pausanias, in the present disposition of his mind;
and thus various ac∣cidents and circumstances, concurred to in∣flame those
dangerous passions which now pos∣sessed him, and to prompt him to
the dreadful purpose of satiating his revenge.</P>
<P>The present solemnity was that which Pau∣sanias chose to put
his dreadful design into execution. Philip, cloathed in a white flowing robe,
waving in soft and graceful folds, the habiliments in which the Grecian
deities were usually represented, moved forward with an heart filled with
triumph and exultation, while the admiring crowds shouted forth their
flattering applause. His guards had orders to keep at a considerable
distance from his person, to shew that the king confided in the
affections of his people, and had not the least apprehen∣sions of danger
amidst all this mixed concourse <PB N="123" REF="125"/> of different
states and nations. Unhappily the danger was but too near him. The injured
Pausanias had not yet forgot his wrongs, but still retained those
terrible impressions which the sense of the indignity he had received,
and the artful and interested representations of others, fixed deeply in
his mind. He chose this fatal morning for the execution of his re∣venge on
the prince who had denied reparation to his injured honour. His design had
been for some time premeditated, and now was the dreadful moment of effecting
it. As Philip marched on in all his pride and pomp, this young Macedonian
slipped through the crowd, and with a desperate and malignant resolution
waited his approach in a narrow passage, just at the entrance into the
theatre. The king advanced towards him, Pausanias drew his poniard, plunged
it into his heart, and the conqueror of Greece, and terror of Asia, fell
prostrate to the ground, and instantly expired.</P>
<P>The murderer flew towards the gates of the city, where there stood
horses ready to favour his escape, which Olympias herself is said to
have prepared. The tumult and confusion was such as might be expected from
so fatal an event; some of the Macedonians crowded round the fallen king
with officious and ineffectual <PB N="124" REF="126"/> care, while others
pursued Pausanias. Among these were Perdicas, Attalus and Leonatus; the
first who excelled in swiftness came up to the assassin, where he
was just preparing to mount his horse, but being by his precipitation
intangled in some vines, a violent effort to ex∣tricate his foot, brought him
suddenly to the ground. As he prepared to rise, Perdicas was upon him, and
with his companions, soon dispatched him by the repeated wounds which their
fury inflicted. His body was immediately hung on a gibbet, but, in the morning
appear∣ed crowned with a golden diadem; the only means by which Olympias could
now express her implacable resentment. In a few days in∣deed, she took a
further occasion of publishing her triumph and exultation in her
husband's fall, by paying the same funeral honours to Pausanias, which
were prepared for Philip; both bodies were burnt on the same pile, and the
ashes of both deposited in the same tomb. She is even said to have
prevailed on the Mace∣donians to pay annual honours to Pausanias; as if she
feared that the share she had taken in the death of Philip, should not be
sufficiently known to the world. She consecrated to Apollo the dagger which
had been the instru∣ment of the fatal deed, inscribed with the name 
<PB N="125" REF="127"/> Myrtalis, the name which she had borne when their
loves first began.</P>
<P>Thus died Philip, whose virtues and vices were directed and
proportioned to his am∣bition. His most shining and exalted qualities were
influenced in a great measure by his love of power; and even the most
exceptionable parts of his conduct were principally deter∣mined by their
conveniency and expediency. If he was unjust, he was, like Caesar, unjust
for the sake of Empire. If he gloried by the suc∣cess acquired by his
virtues and his intellectual accomplishments, rather than in that which the
force of arms could gain, the reason which he himself assigned, points
out his true prin∣ciple. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the former case, said he, the glory is
intirely mine; in the other, my ge∣nerals and soldiers have their
share."</Q></P>
<P>The news of Philip's death was a joyful sur∣prize in Greece, and
particularly in Athens, where the people crowned themselves with garlands,
and decreed a crown to Pausanias. They sacrificed to the gods for their
deliverance, and sung songs of triumph; as if Philip had been slain by
them in battle. But this excess of joy did ill become them. It was looked
upon as an ungenerous and unmanly insult upon the ashes of a murdered
prince, and of <PB N="126" REF="128"/> one whom they just before had revered,
and crouched to in the most abject manner. These immoderate transports
were raised in them by Demosthenes, who having the first intelligence of
Philip's death, went into the assembly unusu∣ally gay and chearful, with
a chaplet on his head, and in a rich habit, though it was then but the
seventh day after the death of his daughter. From this circumstance,
Plutarch, at the same time that he condemns the beha∣viour of the Athenians
in general upon this occasion, takes an opportunity to justify
Demost∣henes, and extols him as a patriot, for not suffering his domestic
afflictions to interfere with the good fortune of the commonwealth. But he
certainly might have acted the part of a good citizen with more decency, and
not have given up to insult, what was due to good manners.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. From the Birth of ALEXANDER, to his setting out for
ASIA.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 364<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ante J. C. 356.</NOTE> ALEXANDER the son of Philip ascend∣ed
the throne upon the death of his father, and took possession of a
kingdom rendered flourishing and powerful by the policy of the preceding
reign.</P>
<P>He came into the world the very day the celebrated Temple of Diana
at Ephesus was burnt, upon which occasion the report goes, that Hegesias
the historian was heard to say, That it was no wonder the temple was burnt,
as Diana was that day employed at the delivery of Olympias, to facilitate the
birth of Alexander.</P>
<P>The passion which prevailed most in Alex∣ander, even from his
tender years, was ambi∣tion, and an ardent desire of glory; but not for every
species of glory. Philip like a sophist, valued himself upon his
eloquence, and the beauty of his style; and had the vanity to have engraved
on his coins the several victories he <PB N="128" REF="130"/> had won at the
Olympick games in the chariot race. But it was not after such empty honours
that his son aspired. His friends asked him one day, Whether he would not
be present at the games abovementioned, in order to dispute the prize
bestowed on that occasion? for he was very swift of foot. He answered,
That he would contend in them, provided kings were to be his antagonists.</P>
<P>Every time news was brought him that his father had taken some
city, or gained some great battle, Alexander so far from sharing in the
general joy, used to say in a plaintive tone of voice, to the young
persons that were brought up with him, Friends, my father will possess
himself of every thing, and leave nothing for me to do.</P>
<P>One day some ambassadors from the king of Persia being
arrived at court during Philip's absence, Alexander gave them so kind and
so polite a reception, and regaled them in so noble and generous a manner
as charmed them all; but that which most surprized them was, the good
sense and judgment he discovered in the several conversations they
had with him. He did not propose to them any thing that was trifling, and
like one of his age; such for instance, as enquiring about the so much 
<PB N="129" REF="131"/> boasted gardens suspended in the air, the riches
and magnificence of the palace; and court of the king of Persia, which
excited the admi∣ration of the whole world; the famous golden plantane-tree;
and that golden vine, the grapes of which were of emeralds, carbuncles, rubies,
and all sorts of precious stones, under which the Persian monarch was
said frequently to give audience. Alexander, I say, asked them
ques∣tions of a quite different nature; enquiring which was the road to Upper
Asia; the distance of the several places; in what the strength and
power of the king of Persia consisted; in what part of the battle he
fought; how he behaved towards his enemies, and in what manner he governed his
subjects. These ambassadors ad∣mired him all the while; and perceiving,
even at that time, how great he might one day be∣come, they observed, in a
few words, the dif∣ference they found between Alexander and Ar∣taxerxes, by
saying one to another, 
<Q REND="inline">"This young prince is great, and ours is rich: that
man must be vastly insignificant, who has no other merit than his
riches!"</Q></P>
<P>So ripe a judgment in this young prince, was owing as much to the
good education which had been given him, as to the happiness 
<PB N="130" REF="132"/> of his natural parts. Several preceptors were appointed
to teach him all such arts and sci∣ences as are worthy the heir to a great
king∣dom; and the chief of these was Leonidas, a person of the most
severe morals, and a relation to the queen. This Leonidas, in their journies
together, used frequently to look into the trunks where his beds and cloaths
were laid, in order to see if Olympias, his mother, had not put some∣thing
superfluous into them, which might ad∣minister to delicacy and luxury.</P>
<P>But the greatest service Philip did his son, was appointing
Aristotle his preceptor, the most famous and the most learned
philosopher of his age, whom he intrusted with the whole care of his
education. One of the reasons which prompted Philip to chuse him a master
of so conspicuous reputation and merit, was, as he himself tells us, that
his son might avoid committing a great many faults, of which he himself had
been guilty.</P>
<P>Philip was sensible how great a treasure he possessed
in the person of Aristotle; for which reason he settled a very genteel
stipend upon him, and afterwards rewarded his pains and care in an infinitely
more glorious manner; for hav∣ing destroyed and laid waste the city of
Stagira, <PB N="131" REF="133"/> the native place of that philosopher, he
rebuilt it, purely out of affection for him; reinstated the inhabitants, who
had fled from it, or were made slaves, and gave them a fine park in the
neighbourhood of Stagira, as a place for their studies and assemblies.
Even in Plutarch's time, the stone seats which Aristotle had placed there
were standing; as also spacious vistoes, under which those who walked
were shaded from the sun-beams.</P>
<P>Alexander likewise discovered no less esteem for his
master, whom he believed himself bound to love as much as if he had been
his father; declaring, That he was indebted to the one for living, and to the
other for living well. The progress of the pupil was equal to the care and
abilities of the preceptor. He grew vastly fond of philosophy, and learned
the several parts of it; but in a manner suitable to his birth. Aristotle
endeavoured to improve his judgment, by laying down sure and certain rules,
by which he might distinguish just and solid reasoning from what is
but speciously so; and by accustoming him to separate in
dis∣course all such parts as only dazzle, from those which are truly
solid, and constitute its whole value. But Alexander applied himself
chiefly <PB N="132" REF="134"/> to morality, which is properly the science of
kings, because it is the knowledge of mankind, and of their duties. This he
made his serious and profound study; and considered it even at that time
as the foundation of prudence and wise policy.</P>
<P>The greatest master of rhetoric that antiquity could ever
boast, and who has left so excellent a treatise on that subject, took
care to make that science part of his pupil's education; and we find that
Alexander, even in the midst of his conquest, was often very urgent with
Ari∣stotle to send him a treatise on that subject. To this we owe the
work entitled Alexander's Rhetoric; in the beginning of which, Aristotle
proves to him the vast advantages a prince may reap from eloquence; as it
gives him the greatest ascendant over the minds of men, which he ought to
acquire as well by his wisdom as authority. Some answers and letters of
Alexander, which are still extant, shew that he possessed, in its
greatest perfection, that strong, that manly eloquence, which abounds with
sense and ideas, and which is so entirely free from superfluous
expressions, that every single word has its meaning; which, properly
speak∣ing, is the eloquence of kings.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="135"/> His esteem, or rather his passion for
Homer, shews, not only with what vigour and success he applied to polite
literature, but the judicious use he made of it, and the solid advantages
he proposed to himself from it. He was not only prompted to peruse this
poet merely out of cu∣riosity, or to unbend his mind, or from a great
fondness for poetry; but his view in study∣ing this admirable writer, was
to borrow such sentiments from him, as were worthy a great king and
conqueror; courage, intrepidity, mag∣nanimity, temperance, prudence; the art of
commanding well in war and peace. The verse which pleased him most in
Homer, was that where Agamemnon is represented as a good king and a brave
warrior.</P>
<P>After this, it is no wonder that Alexander should have so high
an esteem for this poet. Thus when, after the battle of Arbela, the
Macedonians had found, among the spoils of Darius, a gold box (enriched with
precious stones) in which the excellent perfumes used by that prince were
put, Alexander, who was quite covered with dust, and regardless of
es∣sences and perfumes, ordered, that this box should be employed to no
other use than to hold Homer's poems; which he believed the most perfect,
the most precise production of the <PB N="134" REF="136"/> human mind. He
admired particularly the Iliad, which he called, The best provision for a
warrior. He always had with him that edition of Homer which Aristotle had
revised and cor∣rected, and to which the title of The Edition of the Box was
given; and he laid it with his sword every night under his pillow.</P>
<P>Fond, even to excess, of every kind of glory, he was
displeased with Aristotle his master, for having published, in his
absence, certain meta∣physical pieces, which he himself desired to
possess only; and even at the time when he was employed in the conquest
of Asia, and the pur∣suit of Darius, he wrote to him a letter, which is
still extant, wherein he complains upon that very account. Alexander says
in it, That he had much rather surpss the rest of men in the knowledge of
sublime and excellent things, than in the greatness and extent of his
powers. He in like manner requested Aristotle not to shew the treatise
of rhetoric above mentioned to any person but himself.</P>
<P>He had also a taste for the whole circle of arts, but in such
a manner as became a prince; that is, he knew the value and usefulness of
them. Music, painting, sculpture, architecture, flourished in his reign;
because they found him both a skilful judge and a generous protector; 
<PB N="135" REF="137"/> who was able to distinguish and to reward merit.</P>
<P>But he despised certain trifling feats of dex∣terity, that were
of no use. Some Macedo∣nians admired very much a man, who em∣ployed himself
very attentively in throwing small peas through the eye of a needle; which he
would do at a considerable distance, and with∣out once missing.
Alexander seeing him at this exercise, ordered him, as we are told, a
present suitable to his employment; <HI>viz,</HI> a basket of peas.</P>
<P>Alexander was of a sprightly disposition, was resolute, and
very tenacious of his opinion, which never gave way to force, but at the same
time would submit immediately to reason and good sense. It is very
difficult to treat with persons of this turn of mind: Philip accordingly,
notwithstanding his double authority of king and father, believed it
necessary to employ per∣suasion rather than force with respect to his
son, and endeavoured to make himself beloved rather than feared by him.</P>
<P>An accident made him entertain a very ad∣vantageous opinion of
Alexander. There had been sent from Thessaly to Philip a war-horse; a
noble, strong, fiery, generous beast, called <PB N="136" REF="138"/>
Bucephalus. The owner would not sell him under thirteen talents; an immense
sum! The king went into the plains, attended by his courtiers, in order to
view the perfections of this horse; but, upon trial, he appeared so very
fierce, and pranced about in so furious a manner, that no one dared to mount
him. Philip being angry that so furious and unmanageable a creature had been
sent him, gave orders for their carrying him back again. Alexander, who was
present at that time, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"What a noble horse we are going to lose, for
want of address and boldness to back him!"</Q> Philip at first
considered these words as the effect of folly and rashness, so common
to young men; but as Alexander in∣sisted still more upon what he had
said, and was very much vexed to see so noble a creature just going to
be sent home again, his father gave him leave to try what he could do. The
young prince overjoyed at this permission, goes up to Bucephalus, takes
hold of the bridle, and turns his head to the sun, having observed, that
the thing which frighted him, was his own shadow; Alexander therefore first
stroked him gently with his hand, and soothed him with his voice; then
seeing his fierceness abate, and artfully <PB N="137" REF="139"/> taking
this opportunity, he let fall his cloak, and springing swiftly upon his
back, first slackened the rein, without once striking or vexing him; and
when he perceived that his fire was cooled, that he was no longer so furious
and violent, and wanted only to move forward, he gave him the rein, and
spurring him with great vigour, animated him with his voice to his full
speed. While this was doing, Philip and his whole court trembled for fear,
and did not once open their lips; but when the prince, after having run his
first heat, returned with joy and pride, at his having broke a horse which
was judged absolutely ungovernable, all the courtiers in general endeavoured
to outvie one another in their applauses and congratulations; and we are
told, Philip shed tears of joy on this occasion; and embracing Alexander,
after he was alighted, and kissing him, he said to him, 
<Q REND="inline">"My son, seek a kingdom more worthy of thee, for
Macedon is below thy merit."</Q></P>
<P>Alexander upon his accession to the throne, saw himself
surrounded with extreme dan∣gers; the barbarous nations with whom Philip
contended during his whole reign, thought this change for their advantage, and
despising the youth and inexperience of the young mo∣narch, 
<PB N="138" REF="140"/> resolved to seize this opportunity of regaining
their freedom, for satiating them∣selves with plunder: nor had he less to
fear from the Greeks themselves, who now thought this a convenient
opportunity to restore their ancient form of government, revenge their
for∣mer injuries, and reclaim those rights which they had enjoyed for
ages.</P>
<P>Alexander however resolved to prevent their machinations, and to
give them no time to com∣plete their confederacies against him. After taking
revenge upon the conspirators against his father, whom he slew upon his
tomb, he first conciliated the affections of the Macedonians to him, by
freeing them from a vexatious and bodily slavery, only commanding their
service in his wars.</P>
<P>The Macedonians reflecting on his precarious situation, advised
him to relinquish Greece, and not persist in his resolution of
subduing it by force; to recover by gentle methods the bar∣barians who had
taken arms; and to soothe, as it were, those glimmerings of revolt and
inno∣vation, by prudent reserve, complacency and in∣sinuations, in order to
conciliate their affections. However, Alexander would not listen to these
timorous counsels, but resolved to secure and support his affairs, by
boldness and magnani∣mity; <PB N="139" REF="141"/> firmly persuaded, that
should he relax in any point at first, all his neighbours would fall upon
him; and that were he to endeavour to compromise matters, he should be
obliged to give up all Philip's conquests, and by that means confine his
dominions to the narrow li∣mits of Macedon. He therefore made all pos∣sible
haste to check the arms of the barbarians, by marching his troops to the
banks of the Danube, which he crossed in one night. He defeated the king of
the Triballi in a great battle; made the Getae fly at his approach; subdued
several barbarous nations, some by the terror of his name, and others by
force of arms; and notwithstanding the arrogant answers of their
ambassadors, he taught them to dread a danger, which they found but too
well prepared to overwhelm them.</P>
<P>Whilst Alexander was thus employed at a distance against the
barbarians, all the cities of Greece, who were animated more particularly by
Demosthenes, formed a powerful alliance against him. A false report which
prevailed of his death, inspired the Thebans with a boldness that proved
their ruin. They cut to pieces part of the Macedonian garrison in their
citadel. Demosthenes, on the other side, was every day haranguing the
people; and fired <PB N="140" REF="142"/> with contempt for Alexander, whom he
called a child and a hair-brained boy, he assured the Athenians, with a
decisive tone of voice, that they had nothing to fear from the new king of
Macedon, who did not dare to stir out of his kingdom, but would think
himself vastly happy could he sit peaceably on his throne. At the same
time he wrote letters upon letters to Attalus, one of Philip's lieutenants in
Asia Minor, to excite him to rebel. This Attalus was uncle to Cleopatra,
Philip's second wife, and was very much disposed to listen to
De∣mosthenes's proposals. Nevertheless, as Alex∣ander was grown very
disfident of him, for which he knew there was but too much reason, he
therefore, to eradicate from his mind all the suspicions he might
entertain, and the better to screen his designs, sent all Demosthenes's
letters to that prince: but Alexander saw through all his artisices, and
thereupon ordered Hecataeus, one of his commanders, whom he had sent into
Asia for that purpose, to have him assassinated, which was executed
accordingly. Attalus's death restored tranquillity to the army, and entirely
destroyed the seeds of discord and re∣bellion.</P>
<P>The object which seized Alexander's earliest ambition, was the
conquest of Persia; and he <PB N="141" REF="143"/> now expected that he
would have leisure and opportunity to prepare for so great an enter∣prize:
but he was soon called to a new under∣taking; the Athenians, Thebans and
Lacede∣monians united against him; hoping, by the assistance of
Persia, to recover their former freedom. In order to persuade the Greeks to
this, Demosthenes made use of a device, which had more cunning in it than
wisdom. He caused it to be reported that Alexander was slain in a battle
against the Triballi; and he produced a man to the assembly, who ventured
to affirm, that he was present, and wounded, when his general was slain.
These false reports, which serve for a day, are but bad policy; like a
false alarm in battle, the people may sometimes be mocked by them; but in
the end, the success will prove as ridiculous as the invention; for as
those that find themselves at one time abused by such, at other times
neglect the real call of truth, by being summoned without occasion, they
fatally despise the hour of danger. This unfortunate obstacle obliged
Alexander to turn his sword from the Persians against the Greeks, of
whose assistance he had but just before assured himself.</P>
<P>Expedition and activity were the character∣istics of this
monarch's conduct; he led his <PB N="142" REF="144"/> army against the Greeks
with so much celerity, that his appearance before them gave the first news
of his preparation. He appeared so sud∣denly in Boeotia, that the Thebans
could scarce believe their eyes; and being come before their walls, was
willing to give them time to repent; and only demanded to have Phoenix and
Pro∣thules, the two chief ringleaders of the revolt, delivered up to him; and
published, by sound of trumpet, a general pardon to all who should come
over to him. But the Thebans, by way of insult, demanded to have Philotas and
An∣tipater delivered to them; and invited, by a de∣claration, all who were
solicitous for the liberty of Greece, to join with them in its defence.</P>
<P>Alexander finding it impossible for him to get the better of
their obstinacy by offers of peace, saw with grief that he should be
forced to em∣ploy his power, and decide the affair by force of arms. A great
battle was thereupon fought, in which the Thebans exerted themselves with a
bravery and ardour much beyond their strength, for the enemy exceeded them
vastly in numbers. But after a long and vigorous resistance, such as
survived of the Macedonian garrison in the citadel, coming down from it,
and charging the Thebans in the rear; being surrounded on all sides, the
greatest part of them were cut to pieces, and the city taken and
plundered.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145"/> It would be impossible for words to
express the dreadful calamities which the Thebans suf∣fered on this
occasion. Some Thracians having pulled down the house of a virtuous lady of
quality, Timoclea by name, carried off all her goods and treasures; and their
captain having seized the lady, and satiated his brutal lust with her,
afterwards enquired whether she had not concealed gold and silver.
Timoclea, animated by an ardent desire of revenge, replying, That she had
hid some, took him with herself only into her garden, and shewing him a
well, told him, That the instant she saw the enemy enter the city, she
herself had thrown into it the most precious things in her
possession. The officer, overjoyed at what he heard, drew near the
well, and stoop∣ing down to see its depth, Timoclea, who was behind,
pushing him with all her strength, threw him in, and afterwards killed him
with great stones, which she heaped upon him. She was instantly seized
by the Thracians, and being bound in chains, was carried before Alex∣ander. The
prince perceived immediately by her mien, that she was a woman of quality,
and great spirit; for she followed those brutal wretches with a very
haughty air, and without discovering the least fear. Alexander asking her
who she was, Timoclea replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"I am sister <PB N="144" REF="146"/> to
Theagenes, who fought against Philip for the liberty of Greece, and was
killed in the battle of Chaeronea, where he commanded."</Q> The prince,
admiring her generous answer, and still more the action that she had
done, gave orders that she should have leave to retire wherever she
pleased with her children.</P>
<P>Alexander then debated in council how to act with regard to Thebes.
The Phocians, and the people of Plataea, Thespiae, and Orchomenus, who were
all in alliance with Alexander, and had shared in his victory, represented
to him the cruel treatment they had met with from the Thebans, who also had
destroyed their se∣veral cities, and reproached them with the zeal which
they had always discovered in favour of the Persians against the Greeks,
who held them in the utmost detestation; the proof of which was, the oath
they had all taken to destroy Thebes, after they should have vanquished
the Persians.</P>
<P>Cleades, one of the prisoners, being permitted to speak,
endeavoured to excuse in some mea∣sure the revolt of the Thebans; a fault
which in his opinion should be imputed to a rash and credulous imprudence,
rather than to depravity of will and declared perfidy. He remonstrated, that
his countrymen, upon a false report of <PB N="145" REF="147"/> Alexander's
death, had indeed too rashly broke into rebellion, not against the king,
but against his successors; that what crimes soever they might have
committed, they had been pu∣nished for them with the utmost severity, by
the dreadful calamity which had befallen their city; that there now remained in
it none but women, children and old men, from whom they had nothing to fear;
and who were so much the greater objects of compassion, as they had been
no ways concerned in the revolt. He concluded with reminding Alex∣ander, that
Thebes, which had given birth to so many gods and heroes, several of whom
were that king's ancestors, had also been the seat of his father Philip's
rising glory, and like a second native country to him.</P>
<P>These motives which Cleades urged, were very strong and
powerful; nevertheless, the anger of the conqueror prevailed, and the city
was destroyed. However, he set at liberty the priests; all such as had
right of hospitality with the Macedonians; the descendants of Pindar, the
famous poet, who had done so much honour to Greece; and such as had
opposed the revolt. But all the rest, in number about thirty thousand, he
sold; and upwards of six thousand had been killed in battle. The
Athe∣nians <PB N="146" REF="148"/> were so sensibly afflicted at the sad
dis∣aster which had befallen Thebes, that being about to solemnize the
festival of the great mysteries, they suspended them upon account of
their extreme grief; and received, with the greatest humanity, all those
who had fled from the battle, and the plunder of Thebes, and made Athens their
asylum.</P>
<P>Alexander's so sudden arrival in Greece, had very much abated
the haughtiness of the Athe∣nians, and extinguished Demosthenes's
vehe∣mence and fire; but the ruin of Thebes, which was still more sudden,
threw them into the ut∣most consternation. They therefore had recourse to
intreaties, and sent a deputation to Alexander to implore his clemency;
Demosthenes was among them; but he was no sooner arrived at Mount Cytheron,
than dreading the anger of that prince, he quitted the embassy, and
re∣turned home.</P>
<P>Immediately Alexander sent to Athens, re∣quiring the citizens to
deliver up to him ten orators, whom he supposed to have been the chief
instruments in forming the league which Philip his father had defeated at
Chaeronea. It was on this occasion that Demosthenes related to the people
the fable of the wolves and dogs; in which it is supposed, That the wolves
one day <PB N="147" REF="149"/> told the sheep, that in case they desired
to be at peace with them, they must deliver up to them the dogs who were
their guard. The application was easy and natural; especially with
respect to the orators, who were justly compared to dogs, whose duty it
was to watch, to bark, and to fight, in order to save the lives of the
flock.</P>
<P>In this afflicting dilemma of the Athenians, who could not prevvail
with themselves to de∣liver up their orators to certain death, though they
had no other way to save their city, De∣mades, whom Alexander had honoured
with his friendship, offered to undertake the embassy alone, and
intercede for them. The king, whether he had satiated his revenge, or
en∣deavoured to blot out, if possible, by some act of clemency, the
barbarous action he had just before committed; or rather to remove the
se∣veral obstacles which might retard the execu∣tion of his grand design,
and by that means not leave, during his absence, the least pre∣tence for
murmurs, waved his demand with regard to the delivery of the orators, and was
pacified by their sending Caridemus into ba∣nishment; who being a native of
Oraea, had been presented by the Athenians with his freedom, for the
services he had done the <PB N="148" REF="150"/> republic. He was son-in-law
to Chersobleptus, king of Thrace; had learned the art of war under
Iphicrates; and had himself frequently commanded the Athenian armies. To
avoid the pursuit of Alexander, he took refuge with the king of Persia.</P>
<P>As for the Athenians, he not only forgave them the several
injuries he pretended to have received, but expressed a particular regard
for them, exhorting them to apply themselves vigorously to public affairs,
and to keep a watchful eye over the several transactions which might
happen; because, in case of his death, their city was to give laws to the
rest of Greece. Historians relate, that many years after this expedition,
he was seized with deep remorse for the calamity he had brought upon the
Thebans; and that this made him behave with much greater humanity towards many
other nations.</P>
<P>So dreadful an example of severity towards so powerful a city as
Thebes, spread the terror of his arms through all Greece, and made all things
give way before him. He summoned at Corinth, the assembly of the
several states and free cities of Greece, to obtain from them the same
supreme command against the Per∣sians, <PB N="149" REF="151"/> which had
been granted his father a little before his death. No assembly ever debated
upon a more important subject. It was the western world deliberating upon
the ruin of the east; and the methods for executing a re∣venge which had been
suspended more than an age. The assembly held at this time, gave rise
to events, the relation of which appear astonish∣ing, and almost
incredible; and to revolutions which contributed to change the disposition
of most things in the political world.</P>
<P>To form such a design, required a prince bold, enterprising,
and experienced in war; one of great views, who, having acquired a great name
by his exploits, was not to be intimidated by dangers, nor checked by
ob∣stacles; but, above all, a monarch, who had a supreme authority over all
the states of Greece, none of which, singly, was powerful enough to make
so arduous an attempt; and which required, in order for their acting in
concert, to be subject to one chief, who might give motion to the several
parts of that great body, by making them all concur to the same end. Such a
prince was Alexander: it was not difficult for him to rekindle in the minds of
the people their ancient hatred of the Persians. <PB N="150" REF="152"/> their
perpetual and irreconcileable enemies; whose destruction they had more than
once swore, and whom they had determined to ex∣tirpate, in case an
opportunity should present itself for that purpose; a hatred which the
in∣testine feuds of the Greeks might indeed have suspended, but could
never extinguish. The im∣mortal retreat of the ten thousand Greeks,
notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of the prodigious army of the
Persians, shewed plainly what might be expected from an army com∣posed of
the flower of the forces of all the cities of Greece, and those of Macedon,
commanded by generals and officers formed under Philip; and to say all in a
word, led by Alexander. The deliberations of the assembly were therefore
very short; and that prince was unanimously appointed generalissimo
against the Persians.</P>
<P>Immediately a great number of officers, and governors of cities,
with many philosophers, waited upon Alexander, to congratulate him upon his
election. He flattered himself, that Diogenes of Synope, who was then at
Corinth, would also come like the rest, and pay his com∣pliments. This
philosopher, who entertained a very mean idea of grandeur, thought it
improper to congratulate men just upon their exaltation; 
<PB N="151" REF="153"/> but that mankind ought to wait till those per∣sons
should perform actions worthy of their high stations. Diogenes therefore
still con∣tinued at home; upon which Alexander, at∣tended by all his
courtiers, made him a visit. The philosopher was at that time lying down in
the sun; but seeing so great a crowd of people advancing towards him, he
sat up, and fixed his eyes on Alexander. This prince, surprized to be∣hold
so famous a philosopher reduced to such ex∣treme poverty, after
saluting him in the kindest manner, asked, Whether he wanted any thing?
Diogenes replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, that you would stand a little out of my
sun-shine."</Q> This answer raised the contempt and indignation of all
the courtiers; but the monarch, struck with the philosopher's greatness
of soul, 
<Q REND="inline">"Were I not Alexander," says he, "I would be
Diogenes."</Q> In a word, all or nothing presents us with the true image of
Alexander and Diogenes. How great and powerful soever that prince might think
him∣self, he could not deny himself, on this occasion, inferior to a man
to whom he could give, and from whom he could take nothing.</P>
<P>Alexander, before he set out for Asia, was de∣termined to
consult the oracle of Apollo. He therefore went to Delphos, where he happened
<PB N="152" REF="154"/> to arrive in those days which are called unlucky; a
season in which people were forbid consulting the oracle: and accordingly
the priestess refused to go to the temple. But Alexander, who could not
bear any contradiction to his will, took her forcibly by the arm, and as he was
leading her to the temple, she cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"My son, thou art irresistible."</Q> This was
all he desired; and catching hold of these words, which he con∣sidered as
spoke by the oracle, he set out for Macedonia, in order to make
preparations for his great expedition.</P>
<P>Alexander being arrived in his kingdom, held a council with the
chief officers of his army, and the nobles of his court, on the expedition he
meditated against Persia, and the measures he should take in order to
succeed in it. The whole assembly were unanimous, except in one article.
Antipater and Parmenio were of opi∣nion, that the king, before he engaged in an
enterprize which would necessarily be a long one, ought to make choice of a
consort, in order to secure himself a successor to his throne. But
Alexander, who was of a violent fiery tem∣per, did not approve of this advice;
and believ∣ed that after he had been nominated generalis∣simo of the
Greeks, and that his father had left <PB N="153" REF="155"/> him an invincible
army, it would be a shame for him to lose his time in solemnizing his
nup∣tials, and waiting for the fruits of it; for which reason he determined
to set out immediately.</P>
<P>Accordingly he offered up very splendid sa∣crifices to the gods,
and caused to be celebrated at Dia, a city of Macedon, scenical games that
had been instituted by one of his ancestors in honour of Jupiter and the
Muses. This festival continued nine days, agreeable to the number of
those goddesses. He had a tent raised large enough to hold an hundred
tables, on which consequently nine hundred covers might be laid. To this
feast, the several princes of his family, all the ambassadors,
ge∣nerals and officers were invited.</P>
<P>Before he set out upon his great expedition, he settled the
affairs of Macedon, over which he appointed Antipater as viceroy, with twelve
thousand foot, and near the same number of horse. He also enquired into
the domestic affairs of his friends, giving to one an estate in land, to
another a village, to a third the revenues of a town, to a fourth the toll of
an harbour. As all the revenues of his demesnes were already employed, and
exhausted by his donations, Perdicas said to him, 
<Q REND="inline">"My lord, what is it <PB N="154" REF="156"/> you
reserve for yourself?"</Q> Alexander replied, Hope: upon which Perdicas
said, 
<Q REND="inline">"the same hope ought therefore to satisfy
us;"</Q> and so refused very generously to accept of what the king had
appointed him.</P>
<P>After having completely settled his affairs in Macedonia, and
used all the precautions imaginable to prevent any troubles from arising in
it during his absence, he set out for Asia in the beginning of the
Spring. His army con∣sisted of little more than thirty thousand foot, and
four or five thousand horse; but then they were all brave men, well
disciplined, and enu∣red to fatigues. They had made several cam∣paigns
under Philip, and were each of them in case of necessity capable of
commanding: most of the officers were near threescore years of age, and the
common men fifty; and when they were either assembled, or drawn up at the
head of a camp, they had the air of a venerable senate. Parmenio commanded
the infantry, Philotas his son, had eighteen hundred horse under him; and
Callas, the son of Harpalus, the same number of Thessalian cavalry. The
rest of the horse were composed of natives of the several states of
Greece, and amounted to six hundred, had their particular commander. The 
<PB N="155" REF="157"/> Thracians and Poeonians, who were always in front, were
headed by Cassander. Alexander began his march along the lake Cercinum,
to∣wards Amphipolis; crossed the river Strymon, near its mouth; afterwards
the Hebrus, and arrived at Sestos after twenty days march. He then commanded
Parmenio to cross over from Sestos to Abydos, with all the horse, and
part of the foot; which he accordingly did with the assistance of an
hundred and threescore gallies, and several flat-bottomed vessels;
while he himself crossed over the Hellespont, steering his gally with
his own hands: and when he ar∣rived near the shore, as if to take
possession of the continent, he leaped from his ship in com∣plete
armour, and testified many transports of joy.</P>
<P>This confidence soon began to diffuse itself over all the
rest of his army; it inspired his soldiers with so much courage and
security, that they fancied themselves marching not to a precarious war,
but a certain victory.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the city of Lampsacus, which he was determined to
destroy, in order to punish the rebellion of its inhabitants, Anaxi∣menes,
a native of that place, came to him. This man, who was a famous historian,
had been very intimate with Philip his father; and Alex∣ander 
<PB N="156" REF="158"/> himself had a great esteem for him, having been his
pupil. The king suspecting the busi∣ness he came upon, to be
before-hand with him, swore, in express terms, that he would never grant
his request. The favour I have to desire of you, says Anaximenes, is,
that you would destroy Lampsacus. By this witty evasion, the historian
saved his country.</P>
<P>From thence Alexander went to Troy, where he paid great honours to
the shade of Achilles, and caused games to be celebrated round his tomb. He
admired and envied the felicity of that Grecian hero, in having found during
life a faithful friend in Patroclus; and after death a noble panegyrist in
Homer.</P>
<P>When the news of Alexander's landing in Asia was brought to
Darius, he testified the utmost contempt for the Macedonian army, and
indignation at the presumption of their generals. In a letter which he wrote,
he repre∣hended his audacious insolence, and gave or∣ders to his various
governors, in the different parts of his dominions, that if they took
Alex∣ander alive, to whip him with rods, make pri∣soners of his whole army,
and send them as slaves to one of the most deserted parts of his
dominions. Thus confiding in the glittering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <PB N="157" REF="159"/> but barbarous multitude which he commanded,
he disposed of the enemy as already vanquish∣ed: but confidence goes but
a short part of the road to success. The great numbers which he had
gathered, only brought unwiedly splendor into the field, and instead of
procuring him se∣curity, increased his embarrassments.</P>
<P>Alexander, being at length arrived on the banks of the Grannicus, a
river of Phrygia, there first found the Persians disposed to dispute
his passage. The Persian satrap taking possession of the higher
banks, at the head of an army of one hundred thousand foot, and upwards of
ten thousand horse, seemed to promise themselves victory. Memnon, who
was a Rhodian, and commanded under Darius all the coast of Asia, had
advised the generals not to venture a battle, but to lay waste the plains,
and even the cities, thereby to starve Alexander's army, and oblige him to
return back into Europe. Memnon was the best of all Darius's generals, and
had been the principal agent in his victories. It is not easily to determine
what we ought to ad∣mire most in him; whether his great wisdom in council,
his courage and capacity in the field, or his zeal and attachment to his
sovereign. The council he gave on this occasion was ex∣cellent, 
<PB N="158" REF="160"/> when we consider that his enemy was fiery and
impetuous; had neither town, maga∣zine, or place of retreat; that he was
entering a country to which he was absolutely a stranger, and inhabited by
enemies; that delays alone would weaken and ruin him; and that his only hopes
lay in giving battle immediately. But Arfites a Phrygian satrap opposed the
opinion of Memnon, and protested he would never suffer the Grecians to make
such havock in the territories he governed. This ill council pre∣vailed over
that of the Rhodian, whom the Persians to their great prejudice suspected
of a design to protract the war, and by that means of making himself
necessary to Darius.</P>
<P>Alexander in the mean time marched on at the head of his heavy armed
infantry, drawn up in two lines, with the cavalry in the wings, and the baggage
following in the rear. Being ar∣rived upon the banks of the Grannicus,
Par∣menio advised him to encamp there in battle array, in order that his
forces might have time to rest themselves, and not to pass the river till
very early next morning, because the enemy would then be less able to
prevent him: He added, that it would be too dangerous to at∣tempt crossing
a river in sight of an enemy, es∣pecially <PB N="159" REF="161"/> as that
before them was deep, and its banks very craggy; so that the Persian
cavalry, who waited their coming in battle array, on the other side, might
easily defeat them before they were drawn up: That besides the loss which
would be sustained on this occasion, this enterprize, in case it
should prove unsuccessful, would be of dangerous consequence to their
future affairs; the fame and glory of arms de∣pending on the first
actions.</P>
<P>However these reasons were not able to make the least
impression on Alexander, who declar∣ed that it would be a shame should
he, after crossing the Hellespont, suffer his progress to be retarded
by a rivulet; for so he called the Grannicus out of contempt; that they ought
to take advantage of the terror which the suddenness of his arrival, and
the boldness of his attempt, had spread amongst the Persians; and
answer the high opinion the world conceived of his courage, and the valour of
the Macedo∣nians. The enemy's horse which was very nu∣merous, lined the whole
shore, and formed a large front, in order to oppose Alexander where∣ever he
should endeavour to pass; and the foot, which consisted chiefly of
Greeks in Da∣rius's service, was posted behind upon an easy ascent.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="162"/> The two armies continued a long time in
sight of each other, on the banks of the river, as if dreading the event. The
Persians waited till the Macedonians should enter the river, in order to
charge them to advantage upon their landing, and the latter seemed to be
making choice of a place proper for crossing, and to sur∣vey the
countenance of their enemies. Upon this, Alexander ordered his horse to be
brought, commanded the noblemen of the court to follow him, and behave
gallantly. He himself com∣manded the right wing, and Parmenio the left. The
king first caused a strong detachment to march into the river, himself
following it with the rest of the forces. He made Parmenio ad∣vance
afterwards with the left wing: he him∣self led on the right wing into the
river, fol∣lowed by the rest of the troops; the trumpets sounding, and the
whole army raising cries of joy.</P>
<P>The Persians seeing this detachment advance forward, began to
let fly their arrows, and march to a place where the declivity was not so
great, in order to keep the Macedonians from landing. But now the horse
engaged with great fury, one part endeavouring to land, and the other
striving to prevent them. The Mace∣donians, whose cavalry was vastly
inferior in <PB N="161" REF="163"/> number, besides the advantage of the
ground, were wounded with the darts, that were shot from the eminence; not to
mention that the flower of the Persian horse were drawn toge∣ther in this
place, and that Memnon in con∣cert with his sons, commanded there. The
Macedonians therefore at first gave ground, after having lost the first
ranks which made a vigorous defence. Alexander, who had follow∣ed them close,
and reinforced them with his best troops, headed them himself, animated
them by his presence, pushed the Persians, and routed them; upon which
the whole army fol∣lowed after, cross'd the river, and attacked the enemy on
all sides.</P>
<P>Alexander first charged the thickest part of the enemy's
horse, in which the generals fought. He himself was particularly
conspicuous by his shield, and the plume of feathers that over-shadowed
his helmet, on the two sides of which, there rose two wings, as it were, of
a great length, and so vastly white, that they dazzled the eyes of the
beholder. The charge was very furious about his person, and though only the
horse engaged, they fought like foot, man to man, without giving way on
either side; every one striving to repulse his adversary, and gain
ground of him. Spithrobates, lieutenant-governor <PB N="162" REF="164"/> of
Ionia, and son-in-law to Darius, distinguished himself above the rest
of the gene∣rals by his superior bravery. Being surrounded by forty
Persian lords, all of them his relations of experienced valour, and who never
moved from his side, he carried terror where-ever he went. Alexander
observing in how gallant a manner he signalized himself, clapt spurs to
his horse, and advanced towards him. Immedi∣ately they engaged, and each
having thrown a javelin, wounded the other slightly. Spithro∣bates falls
furiously sword in hand upon Alex∣ander, who being prepared for him,
thrusts his pike into his face, and laid him dead at his feet. At that very
moment, Rasaces, brother to that nobleman, charging him on the side, gave
him so furious a blow on the head with his battle-axe that he beat off his
plume, but went no deeper than the hair. As he was going to repeat his blow on
the head, which now appear∣ed through his fractured helmet, Clitus cut off
Rasaces's hand with one stroke of his scimetar, and by that means saved
his sovereign's life. The danger to which Alexander had been ex∣posed,
greatly animated the courage of his soldiers, who now performed wonders. The
Persians in the center of the horse, upon whom the light-armed troops, who
had been posted <PB N="163" REF="165"/> in the intervals of the horse,
poured a perpe∣tual discharge of darts, being unable to sustain any
longer the attack of the Macedonians, who struck them all in the face, the
two wings were immediately broke, and put to flight. Alex∣ander did not
pursue them long, but turned about immediately to charge the foot.</P>
<P>These at first stood their ground, but when they saw
themselves attacked at the same time by the cavalry, and the Macedonian
phalanx which had crossed the river, and that the bat∣talions were now
engaged, those of the Persians did not make either a long or a vigorous
resist∣ance, and were soon put to flight; the Grecian infantry in
Darius's service excepted. This body of foot retiring to a hill, demanded a
pro∣mise from Alexander to let them march away unmolested; but following
the dictates of his wrath, rather than those of reason, he rushed into
the midst of this body of foot, and pre∣sently lost his horse, (not
Bucephalus) who was killed with the thrust of a sword. The battle was so
hot round him, that most of the Mace∣donians, who lost their lives on this
occasion, fell here; for they fought against a body of men, who were well
disciplined, had been inured to war, and fought in despair. They 
<PB N="164" REF="166"/> were all cut to pieces, two thousand excepted, who
were taken prisoners.</P>
<P>A great number of the Persian commanders lay dead on the spot.
Aristes fled into Phrygia, where it is said he laid violent hands on
him∣self, for having been the cause that the battle was fought. Twenty
thousand foot, and two thousand five hundred horse, were killed in this
engagement, on the side of the barbarians; and of the Macedonians,
twenty-five of the royal horse were killed at the first attack. Alexander
ordered Lysippus to make their sta∣tues in brass, all of which were set
up in a city of Macedon, called Dia, from whence they were many years after
carried to Rome, by Metellus. About threescore of the other horse were
killed, and near thirty foot, who, the next day, were all laid with their arms
and equipage in one grave; and the king granted an exemption to their fathers
and children, from every kind of tribute and service.</P>
<P>He also took the utmost care of the wounded, visited them, and
saw their wounds dressed. He enquired very particularly into their
adven∣tures, and permitted every one of them to re∣late his actions in the
battle, and boast his bra∣very. He also granted the rites of sepulture to
<PB N="165" REF="167"/> the principal Persians, and did not even refuse it
to such Greeks as died in the Persian service; but all those whom he
took prisoners, he laid in chains, and sent to work as slaves in
Macedonia, for having fought under the barbarian standard against their
country, contrary to the express prohibition made by Greece upon that
head.</P>
<P>Alexander made it his duty and pleasure to share the honour of
his victory with the Greeks; and sent particularly to the Athenians, three
hundred shields, being part of the plunder taken from the enemy, and caused
the glorious in∣scription following to be inscribed on the rest of the
spoils: 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Alexander son of Philip, with the Greeks,
(the Lacedemonians excepted), gain∣ed these spoils from the barbarians, who
inhabit Asia.</HI>"</Q> The greatest part of the gold and silver plate,
the purple carpets, and other furniture of the Persian luxury, he sent to
his mother.</P>
<P>This victory not only impressed the Persians with
consternation, but served to excite the ardour of the invading army. The
Persians perceiving that the Greeks were not able to overcome them, though
possessed of manifest ad∣vantages, supposed that they never could
be able to face them upon equal terms; and thus, from the first mischance,
they gave up all hopes <PB N="166" REF="168"/> of succeeding by valour.
Indeed, in all inva∣sions where the nations invaded have been once beaten,
with great advantages of place on their side, such as defensive rivers,
straits, and mountains; they soon begin to persuade them∣selves, that
upon equal terms, such an enemy must be irresistible. It is the opinion
of Ma∣chiavel, that he who resolves to defend a passage, should do it
with his ablest forces; for few regions of any circuit are so well defended
by nature, that armies of such force as may be thought sufficient to
conquer them, cannot break through the natural difficulties of the en∣trance;
one passage or other is commonly left unguarded; and some place weakly
defended, will be the cause of a fatal triumph to the in∣vaders. How often
have the Alps given way to armies breaking into Italy? and tho' they pro∣duced
dreadful difficulties and dangers among those that scaled them, yet they
were never found to give security to those that lay behind. It was
therefore wisely done of Alexander to pass the river in the face of the
enemy, with∣out marching higher to seek an easier passage, or labouring
to convey his men over it by some saser method. Having beaten the enemy
upon their own terms, he no less destroyed their re∣putation than their
strength, leaving the wretch∣ed <PB N="167" REF="169"/> subjects of such a
state, no hopes of succour from such unable protectors.</P>
<P>Soon after the battle of Grannicus, he recover∣ed Sardis from the
enemy, which was in a man∣ner the bulwark of the Barbarian empire on the side
next the sea; he took the inhabitants under his protection, received their
nobles with the utmost condescension, and permitted them to be governed
by their own laws and maxims, observing to his friends around him, That
such as lay the foundations of a new dominion, should always endeavour to
have the fame of being merciful. Four days after, he arrived at Ephesus,
carrying with him those who had been banished from thence for being his
adhe∣rents, and restored its popular form of govern∣ment. He assigned to
the Temple of Diana, the tributes which were paid to the kings of Persia.
Before he left Ephesus, the deputies of the cities of Trallis and Magnesia
waited upon him with the keys of those places.</P>
<P>He afterwards marched to Miletus; which city, flattered with the
hopes of a sudden and powerful support, shut their gates against him;
and indeed the Persian fleet, which was very considerable, made a shew as
if it would succour that city; but after having made several fruit∣less
attempts to engage that of the enemy, it <PB N="168" REF="170"/> was forced to
sail way. Memnon had shut himself up in this fortress, with a great
number of his soldiers who had escaped from the battle, and was determined
to make a good defence. Alexander, who would not lose a moment's time,
attacked it, and planted scaling-ladders on all sides. The scalade was
carried on with great vigour, and opposed with no less intrepidity, though
Alexander sent fresh troops to relieve each other without the least
intermission; and this lasted several days. At last finding his
soldiers were every where repulsed, and that the city was provided with
every thing for a long siege, he planted all his machines against it, made
a great number of breaches, and whenever these were attacked, a new scalade
was attempted. The besieged, after sustaining all these efforts with
prodigious bravery, capitulat∣ed to prevent being taken by storm. Alexander
treated the Milesians with the utmost humanity, but sold all the
foreigners who were found in it.</P>
<P>After possessing himself of Miletus, he marched into
Caria, in order to lay siege to Hali∣carnassus. This city was of
prodigious difficult access from its happy situation, and had been
strongly fortified. Besides Memnon, the ablest as well as the most
valiant of all Darius's com∣manders, had got into it with a body of choice 
<PB N="169" REF="171"/> soldiers, with a design to signalize his courage
and fidelity for his sovereign. He accordingly made a very noble defence, in
which he was seconded by Ephialtes, another general of great merit. Whatever
could be expected from the most intrepid bravery and the most consummate
knowledge in the science of war, was conspicuous on both sides on this
occasion. Memnon finding it impossible for him to hold out any longer,
was forced to abandon the city. As the sea was open to him, after having put
a strong garrison into the citadel, which was well stored with
provisions, he took with him the surviving inhabitants, with all their
riches, and conveyed them into the island of Cos, which was not far from
Halicarnassus. Alexander did not think proper to besiege the citadel, it
being of little importance after the city was destroyed, which he
demolished to the very foundations. He left it after having encompassed
it with strong walls, and left some good troops in the country.</P>
<P>Soon after this, he restored Ada queen of Caria to her kingdom, of
which she had been dispossessed some time before; and as a
tes∣timony of the deep sense she had of the favours received from
Alexander, she sent him every day meats dressed in the most
exquisite manner, <PB N="170" REF="172"/> and the most excellent cooks of
every kind. Alexander answered the queen on this occasion, That all this
train was of no service to him; for that he was possessed of much
better cooks, whom Leonidas his governor had given him, one of whom prepared
him a good dinner, and an excellent supper, and those were Temperance and
Exercise.</P>
<P>Several kings of Asia Minor, submitted vo∣luntarily to
Alexander; Mithridates, king of Pontus, was one of these, who afterwards
adhered to this prince, and followed him in his expedi∣tions. He was son to
Ariobarzanes governor of Phrygia and king of Pontus, of whom mention has been
made elsewhere. He is computed to be the sixteenth king from Artabanus, who
is considered as the founder of that kingdom, of which he was put in
possession by Darius, son of Hystaspes his father. The famous
Mithri∣dates, who so long employed the Roman armies, was one of his
successors.</P>
<P>The year ensuing, Alexander began the cam∣paign very early. He had
debated whether it would be proper for him to march direct∣ly against Darius,
or first subdue the rest of the maritime provinces. The latter opinion
appeared the safest, since he thereby would not <PB N="171" REF="173"/> be
molested by such nations as he should leave behind him. This progress
was a little inter∣rupted at first. Near Phaselis, a city situated
between Lysia and Pamphilia, is a defile along the sea shore, which is
always dry at low water, so that travellers may pass it at that time; but
when the sea rises, it is all under water. As it was now winter, Alexander,
whom nothing could daunt, was desirous of passing it before the waters
fell. His forces were therefore ob∣liged to march a whole day in the water,
which came up to their waste.</P>
<P>Alexander after having settled affairs in Cili∣cia and Pamphilia,
marched his army to Coelenae, a city of Phrygia watered by the river
Mar∣syas, which the fictions of Poets have made so famous. He summoned
the garrison of the citadel, whither the inhabitants were retired, to
surrender; but these believing it impregnable, answered haughtily, That
they would first die. However finding the attack carried on with great
vigour, they desired a truce of sixty days, at the expiration of which,
they promised to open their gates, in case they were not succour∣ed. And
accordingly, no aid arriving, they surrendered themselves upon the day
fixed.</P>
<P>From thence he marched into Phrygia, the ancient dominion of the
celebrated king Midas; <PB N="172" REF="174"/> having taken the capital city, he
was desirous of seeing the famous chariot to which the Gordian knot was
tied. This knot which fastened the yoke to the beam, was tied with so much
intricacy, that it was impossible to discover where the ends begun, or
how they were concealed. According to an ancient tradition of the country, an
ora∣cle had foretold that the man who could un∣tie it, should possess
the empire of Asia. Alex∣ander being firmly persuaded that the oracle was
meant for him, after many fruitless trials, in∣stead of attempting to untie
it in the usual manner, drew his sword and cut it in pieces, crying out,
That that was the only way to un∣tie it. The priest hailed the omen, and
de∣clared that Alexander had fulfilled the oracle.</P>
<P>Darius, who now began to be more alarmed than before, used all the
art in his power to raise an army, and encourage his forces: he sent Memnon
into Greece to invade Macedon, in order to make a diversion of the Grecian
forces; but this general dying upon that ex∣pedition, Darius's hopes vanished
on that quar∣ter, and instead of invading the enemy, he was obliged to
consult for the protection of his empire at home.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Alexander having lest Gordion, marched into
Paphlogonia and Cap∣padocia, <PB N="173" REF="175"/> which he subdued. It was
there he heard of Memnon's death; the news whereof confirmed him in the
resolution he had taken, of marching immediately into the provinces of Upper
Asia. Accordingly he advanced, by hasty marches, into Cilicia, and arrived
in the country called Cyrus's Camp. From thence there is no more than fifty
stadia (two leagues and a half each) to the pass of Cilicia, which is a
very narrow strait, through which travellers are obliged to go from
Cappadocia to Tarsus. The officer who guarded it in Darius's name, had left
but few soldiers in it; and those fled the instant they heard of the
enemy's arrival. Upon this, Alexander entered the pass, and after viewing
very attentively the situation of the place, admired his own good fortune,
and confessed, He might have been very easily stopped and defeated
there, merely by the throwing of stones; for not to mention that this pass
was so narrow, that four men, completely armed, could scarcely walk a
breast in it; the top of the mountain hung over the road, which was not only
strait, but broke in several places, by the fall of torrents from the
mountains.</P>
<P>Alexander marched his whole army to the city of Tarsus, where it
arrived the instant <PB N="174" REF="176"/> the Persians were setting fire
to that place, to prevent his plundering the great riches of so flourishing
a city. But Parmenio, whom the king had sent thither with a detachment of
horse, arrived very seasonably to stop the pro∣gress of the fire, and
marched into the city, which he saved, the barbarians having fled the moment
they heard of his arrival.</P>
<P>Through this city the Cydnus runs; a river not so remarkable for
the breadth of its channel, as for the beauty of its waters, which are vastly
limpid; but at the same time excessively cold, because of the tufted
trees with which its banks are overshadowed. It was now about the end of the
summer, which is excessively hot in Ci∣licia, and in the hottest part
of the day; when the king, who was quite covered with sweat and dirt,
arriving on its banks, had a mind to bathe, invited by the beauty and
clear∣ness of the stream. However the instant he plunged into it, he was
seized with so violent a shivering, that all the by-standers fancied he
was dying. Upon this, he was carried to his tent, after fainting away. The
physicians, who were sensible they should be answerable for the
event, did not dare to hazard violent and extraordinary remedies. However,
Philip, one of his physicians, who had always attend∣ed <PB N="175" REF="177"/> upon him from his youth, and loved him with the utmost
tenderness, not only as his sovereign, but his child, raising himself
(merely out of affection to Alexander) above all prudential considerations,
offered to give him a dose, which, though not very violent, would
nevertheless be speedy in its effects; and desired three days to prepare
it. At this proposal every one trembled, but he only whom it most
concerned; Alexander being afflicted upon no other account, than because it
would keep him three days from appearing at the head of his army.</P>
<P>Whilst these things were doing, Alexander received a letter from
Parmenio, who was left behind in Cappadocia, in whom Alexander put greater
confidence than in any other of his courtiers; the purport of which was, to bid
him beware of Philip his physician, for that Darius had bribed him, by the
promise of a thousand talents, and his sister in marriage. This letter
gave him great uneasiness; for he was now at full leisure to weigh all
the reasons he might have to hope or fear. But the considence in a
physician whose sincere attachment and fidelity he had proved from his
infancy, soon pre∣vailed, and removed all suspicions. He folded up the
letter, and put it under his bolster, <PB N="176" REF="178"/> without
acquainting his attendants with the contents; in the mean time, his physician
en∣tered, with a medicine in his hand, and offered the cup to Alexander. The
hero upon this, took the cup from him, and holding out the letter, desired
the physician to read, while he drank off the draught with an intrepid
coun∣tenance, without the least hesitation, or dis∣covering the least
suspicion or uneasiness. The physician, as he perused the letter,
shewed greater signs of indignation than of fear; he bid him, with a
resolute tone, harbour no un∣easiness, and that the recovery of his
health would in a short time wipe off all suspicion. In the mean time,
the physic wrought so vio∣lently, that the symptoms seemed to
strengthen Parmenio's accusation; but at last, the me∣dicine having
gained the ascendant, he began to assume his accustomed vigour; and in
about three days, he was able to shew himself to his longing soldiers, by
whom he was equally beloved and respected.</P>
<P>In the mean time Darius was on his march; filled with a vain
security in the superiority of his numbers; and consident not in the
valour, but in the splendor of his forces. The plains of Assyria, in
which he was encamped, gave him an opportunity of extending his horse as he 
<PB N="177" REF="179"/> pleased, and of taking the advantage which the great
difference between the number of soldiers in each army gave him. But
instead of this, he resolved to march to narrow passes, where his
cavalry, and the multitude of his troops, so far from doing him any
service, would only incumber each other; and accordingly, ad∣vanced towards
the enemy, for whom he should have waited; and thus ran visibly on his
destruction.</P>
<P>His courtiers and attendants however, whose custom it was to
flatter and applaud all his actions, congratulated him upon an approaching
victory, as if it had been certain and inevitable. There was at that time, in
the army of Darius, one Caridemus, an Athenian, a man of great experience in
war, who personally hated Alex∣ander, for having caused him to be
barlished from Athens. Darius turning to this Athenian, asked whether he
believed him powerful enough to defeat his army. Caridemus, who had been
brought up in the bosom of liberty, and for∣getting that he was in a country
of slavery, where to oppose the inclinations of the prince is of the most
dangerous consequence, replied as follows: 
<Q REND="inline">"Permit me, Sir, to speak truth now, when only my
sincerity may be of service; your present splendor, your prodigious
num∣bers <PB N="178" REF="180"/> which have drained the east, may be terrible
indeed to your effeminate neigh∣bours, but can be no way dreadful to a
Macedonian army. Discipline, close combat, courage, is all their care;
every single man among them is almost himself a general. These men are
not to be repulsed by the stones of slingers, or stakes burnt at the
end; none but troops armed like themselves can stop their career; let
therefore the gold and silver which glitters in your camp, be ex∣changed for
foldiers and steel, for weapons and for hearts that are able to defend
you."</Q> Darius, though naturally of a mild disposition, had all his
passions roused at the freedom of this man's advice; he ordered him at
once to be executed; Caridemus all the time crying out, that his avenger was at
hand: Darius too soon repented his rashness, and experienced when it was
too late, the truth of all that had been told him.</P>
<P>The emperor now advanced with his troops towards the river
Euphrates; over his tent was exhibited to the view of his whole army, the image
of the sun in jewels; while wealth and magnificence shone in every quarter
of the army.</P>
<P>First they carried silver altars, on which lay fire, called by
them Sacred and Eternal; <PB N="179" REF="181"/> and these were followed by
the Magi, singing hymns, after the manner of their country: they were
accompanied by three hundred and sixty-five youths (equalling the number of
days in a year) cloathed in purple robes. After∣wards came a chariot
consecrated to Jupiter, drawn by white horses, and followed by a courser
of a prodigious size, to whom they gave the name of the Sun's Horse; and
the equeries were dressed in white, each having a golden rod in his
hand.</P>
<P>Ten chariots, adorned with sculptures in gold and silver
followed after. Then marched a body of horse, composed of twelve nations,
whose manners and customs were various, and all armed in a different
manner. Next advanced those whom the Persians called The Immortals,
amounting to ten thousand, who surpassed the rest of the barbarians
in the sumptuousness of their apparel. They all wore golden collars, were
cloathed in robes of gold tissue, with vest∣ments having sleeves to
them quite covered with precious stones.</P>
<P>Thirty paces from them followed those called the king's relations,
to the number of fifteen thousand, in habits very much resembling those
of women; and more remarkable for the vain pomp of their dress, than the
glitter of their arms.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="182"/> Those called the Doriphori came after; they
carried the king's cloak, and walked before his chariot, in which he seemed
to sit, as on a high throne. This chariot was enriched on both sides with
images of the gods, in gold and silver; and from the middle of the yoke,
which was covered with jewels, rose two statues, a cubit in height, the one
representing War, the other Peace, having a golden eagle between them, with
wings extended, as ready to take its flight.</P>
<P>But nothing could equal the magnificence of the king: he was
cloathed in a vest of pur∣ple, striped with silver, and over it a long
robe, glittering all over with gold and pre∣cious stones, that represented
two falcons, rushing from the clouds, and pecking at one another. Around his
waist he wore a golden girdle, after the manner of women, whence his
scymitar hung, the scabbard of which flamed all over with gems; on his head
he wore a tiara, or mitre, round which was a fillet of blue mixed with
white.</P>
<P>On each side of him walked two hundred of his nearest relations,
followed by two thousand pike-men, whose pikes were adorned with silver,
and tipped with gold; and lastly, thirty thousand infantry, who composed
the rear∣guard. <PB N="181" REF="183"/> These were followed by the king's
horses four hundred in number, all which were led.</P>
<P>About one hundred, or an hundred and twenty paces from thence, came
Sysigambis, Darius's mother, seated on a chariot, and his confort on
another; with the several female attendants of both queens, riding on
horseback. Afterwards came fifteen large chariots, in which were the king's
children, and those who had the care of their education, with a band of
eunuchs, who are to this day in great esteem among those nations. Then
marched the concubines, to the number of three hundred and sixty, in the
equipage of queens, followed by six hundred mules, and three hundred camels,
which car∣ried the king's treasure, and guarded by a great body of
archers.</P>
<P>After these came the wives of the crown-officers, and of the
greatest lords of the court; then the sutlers, and servants of the army,
seated also in chariots.</P>
<P>In the rear were a body of light-armed troops, with their
commanders, who closed the whole march.</P>
<P>Such was the splendor of this pageant mo∣narch; he took the field
encumbered with an unnecessary train of concubines, attended with 
<PB N="182" REF="184"/> troops of various nations, speaking different
lan∣guages, for their numbers impossible to be mar∣shalled, and so rich
and effeminate in gold and in garments, as seemed rather to invite than deter
an invader.</P>
<P>Alexander, after marching from Tarsis, ar∣rived at Bactriana; from
thence, still earnest in coming up with his enemy, he came to Solae, where
he offered sacrifice to Esculapius; from thence he went forward to Pyramus,
to Malles, and at last to Cartabala: it was here that he first received
advice, that Darius, with his whole army, was encamped at Sochus in
As∣syria, two days journey from Cilicia. He therefore resolved, without
delay, to meet him there, as the badness of the weather ob∣liged him to
halt.</P>
<P>In the mean time Darius led on his immense army into the plains of
Assyria, which they co∣vered to a great extent; there he was advised by
the Grecian commanders who were in his ser∣vice, and who composed the
strength of his army to halt, as he would there have sufficient room to
expand his forces, and surround the invader. Darius rejected their advice;
and instead of waiting Alexander's approach, vainly puffed up with pride by
his surrounding courtiers, he re∣solved to pursue the invader, who
wished for <PB N="183" REF="185"/> nothing more ardently than to come to an
en∣gagement.</P>
<P>Accordingly, Darius having sent his treasures to Damascus, a
city of Assyria, he marched with the main body of his army towards Cilicia,
then turned short towards Issus; and quite ignorant of the situation of
the enemy, supposed he was pursuing Alexander, when he had actually left
him in the rear. There is a strange mixture of pride, cruelty, splendor and
magnanimity, in all the actions of this Persian prince. At Issus he
barbarously put to death all the Greeks who were sick in that city, a few
soldiers only excepted, whom he dismissed, after having made them view
every part of his camp, in order to report his numbers and his strength to
the in∣vader: these soldiers accordingly brought Alex∣ander word of the
approach of Darius; and he now began to think seriously of preparing for
battle.</P>
<P>Alexander fearing, from the numbers of the enemy, that they would
attack him in his camp, fortified it with a ditch and a rampart; but at the
same time discovered great joy to see the enemy hastening to its own
destruction, and preparing to attack him in a place which was but wide enough
for a small army to act and move at liberty in. Thus the two armies were 
<PB N="184" REF="186"/> in some measure reduced to an equality: the
Macedonians had space sufficient to employ their whole force, while the
Persians had not room for the twentieth part of theirs.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, Alexander, as frequently hap∣pens to the greatest
captains, felt some emotion when he saw that he was going to hazard all at
one blow. The more Fortune had favoured him hitherto, the more he now dreaded
her frowns; the moment approaching which was to determine his fate. But, on the
other side, his courage revived, from the reflection, that the rewards of his
toils exceeded the dangers of them; and though he was uncertain with regard to
the victory, he at least hoped to die gloriously, and like Alexander.
However, he did not divulge these thoughts to any one; well knowing, that,
upon the approach of a battle, a general ought not to discover the least
marks of sadness or perplexity; and that the troops should read nothing
but resolution and intrepidity in the countenance of their commander.</P>
<P>Having made his soldiers refresh themselves, and ordered them
to be ready for the third watch of the night, which began at twelve, he went to
the top of a mountain, and there, by torch-light, sacrificed, after the
manner of his country, to the gods of the place. As soon as 
<PB N="185" REF="187"/> the signal was given, his army, which was ready to
march and fight, being commanded to make great speed, arrived by day-break at
the several posts assigned them. But now the spies bring∣ing word
that Darius was not above thirty furlongs from them, the king caused his army
to halt, and then drew it up in battle array. The peasants, in the greatest
terror, came also, and acquainted Darius with the arrival of the enemy; which
he would not at first believe, imagining, as we have observed, that
Alex∣ander fled before him, and was endeavouring to escape. This news threw
his troops into the utmost confusion; who, in their surprise, ran to
their arms with great precipitation and disorder.</P>
<P>The spot where the battle was fought, lay near the city of
Issus, which the mountains bounded on one side, and the sea on the
other. The plain that was situated between them both must have been
considerably broad, as the two armies encamped in it; and I before
observed, that Darius's army was vastly numerous. The river Pinarius, ran
through the middle of this plain from the mountain to the sea, and divided it
very near into two equal parts. The mountain formed a hollow kind of gulph, the
extremity of which in a curved line, bounded part of the plain.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188"/> Alexander drew up his army in the following
order. He posted at the extremity of the right wing, which stood near the
mountains, the Argyraspides, commanded by Nicanor; then the phalanx of
Coenus, and afterwards that of Perdicas, which terminated in the center of the
main army. On the extremity of the left wing, he posted the phalanx of
Amyntas, then that of Ptolemy, and lastly that of Meleager. Thus the famous
Macedonian phalanx was formed, which we find was com∣posed of six
distinct bodies. Each of those was headed by able generals; but Alexander
being always generalissimo, had consequently the command of the whole
army. The horse were placed on the two wings; the Macedo∣nians with the
Thessalians on the right, and of Peloponnesians, with the other allies on
the left. Craterus commanded all the foot, which composed the left wing, and
Parmenio the whole wing. Alexander had reserved to him∣self the command of
the right. He had desir∣ed Parmenio to keep as near the sea as
possible, to prevent the barbarians from surrounding him; and Nicanor on
the contrary, was ordered to keep at some distance from the mountains, to
keep himself out of the reach of the arrows dis¦charged by those who were
posted on them. He <PB N="187" REF="189"/> covered the horse on his right
wing with the light horse of Protomachus and the Poeonians, and his foot with
the bowmen of Antiochus. He reserved the Agrians (commanded by At∣talus,) who
were greatly esteemed, and some forces that were newly arrived from Greece,
to oppose those Darius had posted on the moun∣tains.</P>
<P>As for Darius's army, it was drawn up in the following order. Having
heard that Alex∣ander was marching towards him in battle array, he commanded
thirty thousand horse, and twenty thousand bowmen to cross the river
Pinarius, that he might have an opportunity to draw up his army in a commodious
manner on the hither side. In the center he posted the thirty thousand
Greeks in his service, who doubtless were the flower and chief strength
of his army, and were not at all inferior in bravery to the Macedonian phalanx,
with thirty thou∣sand Barbarians on their right, and as many on their left.
The field of battle not being able to contain a greater number, these were
all heavily armed. The rest of the infantry dis∣tinguished by their
several nations, were ranged behind the first line. It is pity Arrian does
not tell us the depth of each of those two lines; but it must have been
prodigious, if we consider <PB N="188" REF="190"/> the extreme narrowness of
the pass, and the amazing multitude of the Persian forces. On the mountain
which lay to their left, against Alexander's right wing, Darius posted
twenty thousand men, who were so ranged (in the several windings of the
mountain) that some were behind Alexander's army, and others be∣fore it.</P>
<P>Darius, after having set his army in battle array, made his
horse cross the river again, and dispatched the greatest part of them
towards the sea against Parmenio, because they could fight on that spot
with the greatest advantage. The rest of his cavalry he sent to the left,
to∣wards the mountain. However, finding that these would be of no service
on that side, be∣cause of the too great narrowness of the spot, he
caused a great part of them to wheel about to the right. As for himself he
took his post in the center of his army, pursuant to the custom of the
Persian monarchs.</P>
<P>The two armies being thus drawn up in order of battle, Alexander
marched very slowly, that his soldiers might take a little breath; so
that it was supposed they would not engage till very late. For Darius
still continued with his army on the other side of the river, in order not
to lose the advantageous situation of his post; <PB N="189" REF="191"/>
and even caused such parts of the shore as were not craggy to be
secured with palisadoes, where the Macedonians concluded that he was
already afraid of being defeated. The two armies being come in sight,
Alexander riding along the ranks, called by their several names, the
principal officers both of the Macedonians and foreigners; and exhorted the
soldiers to signalize themselves, speaking to each nation according to
its pecu∣liar genius and disposition. The whole army set up a shout and
eagerly desired to be led on directly against the enemy.</P>
<P>Alexander had advanced at first very slowly to prevent the ranks
on the front of his phalanx from breaking, and halted by intervals. But when he
was got within bow-shot, he com∣manded all his right wing to plunge
impetu∣ously into the river, purposely that he might surprize the
barbarians, come sooner to a close engagement, and be less exposed to
the enemy's arrows; in all which he was very successful. Both sides
fought with the utmost bravery and resolution; and being now forced to
fight close, they charged both sides sword in hand, when a dreadful
slaughter ensued, for they engaged man to man, each aiming the point of his
sword at the face of his opponent. Alexander who performed the duty both of a
private soldier <PB N="190" REF="192"/> and of a commander, wished nothing
so ar∣dently as the glory of killing with his own hand Darius, who being
seated on a high cha∣riot, was conspicuous to the whole army; and by that
means was a powerful object both to encourage his own soldiers to defend, and
the enemy to attack him. And now the battle grew more furious and bloody than
before, so that a great number of Persian noblemen were killed. Each side
fought with incredible bra∣very. Oxathres, brother to Darius, observing that
Alexander was going to charge that mo∣narch with the utmost vigour, rushed
before his chariot with the horse under his command and distinguished
himself above the rest. The horses that drew Darius's chariot lost all
com∣mand, and shook the yoke so violently, that they were upon the point of
overturning the king, who seeing himself going to fall alive into the hands
of his enemies, leaped down and mounted another chariot. The rest observing
this fled as fast as possible, and throwing down their arms, made the
best of their way. Alex∣ander had received a slight wound in his thigh, but
happily it was not attended with ill con∣sequences. Whilst part of the
Macedonian in∣fantry (posted to the right,) were driving the advantages they
had gained against the Persians, <PB N="191" REF="193"/> the remainder of
them who engaged the Greeks, met with greater resistance. These
observing that the body of infantry in question, were no longer covered by
the right wing of Alex∣ander's army, which was pursuing the enemy, came and
attacked it in flank. The engagement was very bloody, and victory a long time
doubt∣ful. The Greeks endeavoured to push the Macedonians into the river, and
to recover the disorder into which the left wing had been thrown. The
Macedonians also signalized them∣selves with the utmost bravery, in
order to pre∣serve the advantage which Alexander had just before gained and
support the honour of their phalanx, which had always been considered as
invincible. There was also a perpetual jealousy between the Greeks and
Macedonians, which greatly increased their courage, and made the
resistance on each side very vigorous. On Alexander's side Ptolemy the
son of Seleucus, lost his life with an hundred and twenty more
considerable officers, who all had behaved with the utmost gallantry.</P>
<P>In the mean time the right wing, which was victorious under its
Monarch, after defeating all who opposed it, wheeled to the left against
those Greeks who were fighting with the rest of the Macedonian phalanx,
whom they <PB N="192" REF="194"/> charged very vigorously; and attacking them
in flank entirely routed them.</P>
<P>At the very beginning of the engagement the Persian cavalry, which
was in the right wing (without waiting for their being attacked by the
Macedonians) had crossed the river and rushed upon the Thessalian
horse, several of whose squadrons they broke. Upon this the remainder
of the latter, in order to avoid the impetuosity of the first charge, and
oblige the Persians to break their ranks, made a feint of retiring, as
terrified by the prodigious numbers of the enemy. The Persians seeing this,
were filled with boldness and confidence; and there∣upon, the greatest part
of them advancing, without order or precaution, as to a certain victory had no
thoughts but of pursuing the enemy. Upon this the Thessalians seeing
them in such confusion, faced about on a sudden and renewed the fight
with fresh ardour. The Persians made a brave defence, till they saw
Darius put to flight, and the Greeks cut to pieces by the phalanx, when they
fled in the utmost disorder.</P>
<P>With regard to Darius, the instant he saw his left wing broke,
he was one of the first who fled in his chariot; but get∣ting afterwards into
craggy rugged places, <PB N="193" REF="195"/> he mounted on horseback,
throwing down his bow, shield and royal mantle. Alexander, however did not
attempt to pursue him, till he saw his phalanx had conquered the Greeks,
and the Persian horse put to flight; which was of great advantage to the
prince that fled.</P>
<P>Sysigambis, Darius's mother, and that mo∣narch's queen, who also
was his sister, were found remaining in the camp, with two of the king's
daughters, his son (yet a child) and some Per∣sian ladies; for the rest
had been carried to Damascus, with part of Darius's treasure, and all
such things as contributed only to the luxury and magnificence of his court.
No more than three thousand talents were found in his camp; but the rest of
the treasure fell after∣wards into the hands of Parmenio, at the taking the
city of Damascus.</P>
<P>As for the barbarians, having exerted them∣selves with bravery
enough in the first attack, they afterwards gave way in the most shameful
manner; and being intent upon nothing but saving themselves, they took
different ways. Some struck into the high road, which led directly to
Persia; others ran into woods and lonely mountains; and a small number
return∣ed to their camp, which the victorious enemy had already taken and
plundered. In this battle <PB N="194" REF="196"/> threescore thousand of the
Persian infantry and ten thousand horsemen were slain; forty
thou∣sand were taken prisoners, while of Alexander's army there fell but
two hundred and fourscore men in all.</P>
<P>The evening after the engagement, Alexander invited his chief
officers to a feast, at which he himself presided, notwithstanding he
had been wounded that day in battle. The festivity how∣ever had scarce
begun, when they were inter∣rupted by sad lamentations from a neighbour∣ing
tent, which at first they considered as a fresh alarm, but they were
soon taught, that it came from the tent, in which the wife and mother of
Darius were kept, who were ex∣pressing their sorrow for the supposed
death of Darius. An eunuch, who had seen his cloak in the hands of a
soldier, imagining he was killed, brought them these dreadful tidings.
Alex∣ander, however sent one of his officers to un∣deceive them, and to
inform them that the emperor was still alive. The women little used to the
appearance of strangers, upon the ar∣rival of the Macedonian soldier,
imagining he was sent to put them to death, threw themselves at his feet,
and intreated him to spare them a little while. They were ready they said
to die; and only desired to bury Darius, before <PB N="195" REF="197"/> they
should suffer. The soldier assured them, that he came rather to
comfort than afflict them, that the monarch whom they deplored, was still
living, and he gave Sysigambis his hand to raise her from the ground.</P>
<P>The next day Alexander, after visiting the wounded, caused the
last honours to be paid to the dead in presence of the whole army, drawn up
in the most splendid order of battle. He treated the Persians of
distinction in the same manner, and permitted Darius's mother, to bury
whatever persons she pleased according to the customs, and ceremonies
practised in her country. After this, he sent a message to the queens,
to inform them, that he was coming to pay them a visit; and accordingly,
com∣manding all his train to withdraw, he entered the tent accompanied only by
Hephoestion, who made so cautious and discreet a use of the liberty
granted him, that he seemed to take it not so much out of inclination, as
from a desire to obey the king who would have it so. They were of the
same age, but Hephoestion was taller, so that the queens took him first
for the king, and paid him their respects as such. But some captive
eunuchs shewing them Alexander, Sysi∣gambis fell prostrate before him,
and intreated pardon for her mistake, but the king raising 
<PB N="196" REF="198"/> her from the ground, assured her this his friend
also was another Alexander; and after com∣forting her and her attendants,
took the son of Darius that was yet but a child in his arms. The infant,
without discovering the least terror, stretched out his arms to the
conqueror, who being affected with its confidence, said to Hephoestion, Oh!
that Darius had some share, some portion of this infant's
generosity.—This interview has done more honour to Alexander's
character, than all the rest of: his conquests: the gentleness of his
manners to the suppliant captives, his chastity and continence, when he had
the power to enforce obedience, were setting an example to heroes, which it
has been the pride of many since to imitate.</P>
<P>After this overthrow, all Phoenicia, the ca∣pital city of Tyre only
excepted, was yielded to the conqueror, and Parmenio was made gover∣nor. Good
fortune followed him so fast, that it rewarded him beyond his expectations.
An∣tigonus his general in Asia, overthrew the Ca∣padocians, Paphlagonians,
and others lately re∣volted. Aristodemus the Persian admiral, was overcome
at sea, and a great part of his fleet taken. The city of Damascus also,
in which the treasures of Darius were deposited, was given up to Alexander.
The governor of this <PB N="197" REF="199"/> place forgetting the duty he owed
his sovereign, informed Alexander by letter upon a certain day, that he would
lead out his soldiers laden with spoil from the city, as if willing to
secure a retreat; and these with all their wealth might be taken with a
proper body of troops to intercept them. Alexander punctually followed the
go∣vernor's instruction, and thus became possessed of an immense
plunder. Besides money and plate which was afterwards coined, and amount∣ed
to immense sums, thirty thousand men and seven thousand beasts
laden with baggage were taken. We find by Parmenio's letter to Alex∣ander, that
he found in Damascus, three hun∣dred and twenty nine of Darius's concubines
all admirably well skilled in music, and also a multitude of officers,
whose business it was to regulate and prepare every thing relating to
that monarch's entertainments.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Darius having travelled on horseback the whole
night, struck with terror and consternation, arrived in the morning at
Sochus, where he assembled the remains of his army: still however his
pride would not for∣sake him with his fortune; he wrote a letter to
Alexander, in which he rather treated him as an inferior; he commanded, rather
than re∣quested that Alexander would take a ransom <PB N="198" REF="200"/>
for his mother, wife and children. With re∣gard to the empire, he would fight
with him for it upon equal terms; and bring an equal number of troops into the
field. To this Alex∣ander replied, That he disdained all correspon∣dence
with a man whom he had already over∣come; that in case he appeared before him
in a supplicating posture, he would give up his wife and mother without
ransom; that he knew how to conquer, and to oblige the conquered.</P>
<P>Thus coming to no issue, the king marched from thence into
Phoenicia, the citizens of Byblos opening their gates to him. Every one
submitted as he advanced, but no people did this with greater pleasure than
the Sidonians: We have seen in what manner Ochus had de∣stroyed their city
eighteen years before, and put all the inhabitants of it to the sword. After
he was returned into Persia, such of the citizens, as, upon account of
their traffic or for some other cause, had been absent, and by that means
had escaped the massacre, returned thither and rebuilt their city. But
they had retain∣ed so violent a hatred to the Persians, that they were
overjoyed at this opportunity of throwing off their yoke; and indeed they were
the first in that country who submitted to the king by their deputies, in
opposition to Strato their <PB N="199" REF="201"/> king, who had declared in
favour of Darius. Alexander dethroned him, and permitted He∣phoestion to
elect in his stead, whomsoever of the Sidonians he should judge worthy of
so ex∣alted a station.</P>
<P>This favourite was quartered at the house of two brothers who were
young, and of the most considerable family in the city; to these he
of∣fered the crown. But they refused it, telling him that according to the
laws of their country, no person could ascend the throne unless he were
of the blood royal. Hephoestion admiring this greatness of soul, which
could contemn what others strive to obtain by fire and sword; 
<Q REND="inline">"Continue, says he to them, in this way of
thinking, you who before were sensible that it is much more glorious to
refuse a diadem, than to accept it. However, name me some person of the
royal family, who may remem∣ber when he is king, that it was you set the
crown on his head."</Q> The brothers observ∣ing, that several through
excessive ambition; aspired to this high station, and to obtain it,
paid a servile court to Alexander's favourites, declared, that they did not
know any person more worthy of the diadem than one Abdolo∣nymus, descended,
though at a great distance, from the royal line; but who, at the same time 
<PB N="200" REF="202"/> was so poor that he was obliged to get his bread by
day labour in a garden without the city. His honesty and integrity had
reduced him, as well as many more, to such extreme poverty. Solely intent
upon his labour, he did not hear the clashing of the arms which had shaken
all Asia.</P>
<P>Immediately the two brothers went in search of Abdolonymus, with
the royal garments, and found him weeding in his garden. When they saluted
him king, Abdolonymus looked upon the whole as a dream; and, unable to guess
the meaning of it, asked if they were not ashamed to ridicule him in that
manner? But as he made a greater resistance than suited their
incli∣nations, they themselves washed him, and threw over his shoulders a
purple robe, richly em∣broidered with gold; then after repeated oaths of their
being in earnest, they conducted him to the palace.</P>
<P>The news of this was immediately spread over the whole city.
Most of the inhabitants were overjoyed at it, but some murmured,
es∣pecially the rich, who despising Abdolonymus's former abject state,
could not forbear shewing their resentment upon that account in the king's
court. Alexander commanded the new-elected prince to be sent for, and after
surveying him <PB N="210" REF="203"/> attentively a long time, he spoke
thus: 
<Q REND="inline">"Thy air and mien do not contradict what is related
of thy extraction; but I should be glad to know with what frame of mind thou
didst bear thy poverty?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Would to the gods (replied he) that I may bear this
crown with equal patience. These hands have procured me all I desired; and
whilst I possessed nothing, I wanted no∣thing."</Q> This answer
gave Alexander an high idea of Abdolonymus's virtue; so that he pre∣sented
him, not only with the rich furniture which had belonged to Strato, and part of
the Persian plunder, but likewise annexed one of the neighbouring provinces
to his dominions.</P>
<P>Syria and Phoenicia, were already subdued by the Macedonians, the
city of Tyre except∣ed. This city was justly entitled the Queen of the Sea,
that element bringing to it the tribute of all nations. She boasted her
having first in∣vented navigation, and taught mankind the art of braving the
winds and waves by the assistance of a frail bark. The happy situation
of Tyre, the conveniency and extent of its ports, the character of its
inhabitants, who were indus∣trious, laborious, patient, and extremely
cour∣teous to strangers; invited thither merchants from all parts of the
globe, so that it might be considered, not so much as a city belonging to
<PB N="202" REF="204"/> any particular nation, as the common city of all
nations, and the center of their commerce.</P>
<P>Alexander thought it necessary both for his pride and his
interest to take this city. The spring was now coming on. Tyre was at that
time seated in an island of the sea, about a quarter of a league from the
continent. It was surrounded with a strong wall, an hun∣dred and fifty feet
high, which the waves of the sea washed, and the Carthaginians (a colony
from Tyre) a mighty people, and sovereigns of the ocean, whose
ambassadors were at that time in the city offering to Hercules, according
to ancient custom, an annual sacrifice, had en∣gaged themselves to
succour the Tyrians. It was this made them so haughty; firmly deter∣mined
not to surrender, they fix machines on the ramparts and on the towers, arm
their young men, and build workhouses for the arti∣ficers, of whom there were
great numbers in the city, so that every part resounded with the noise of
warlike preparations. They likewise cast iron grapples to throw on the
enemy's works, and tear them away; as also cramp irons, and such like
instruments formed for the defence of cities. So many difficulties opposing
such a hazardous design, and so many reasons should have made
Alexander decline the siege.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="205"/> It was impossible to come near this city
in order to storm it, without making a bank, which would reach from the
continent to the island; and an attempt of this kind would be attended with
difficulties, that were seem∣ingly insurmountable. The little arm of the
sea, which separated the island from the con∣tinent, was exposed to the
west wind, which often raised such dreadful storms there, that the
waves would in an instant, sweep away all works. Besides, as the city was
surrounded on all sides by the sea, there was no fixing scaling
ladders, nor throwing up batteries, but at a distance in the ships; and the
wall which pro∣jected into the sea towards the lower part, pre∣vented people
from landing; not to mention that the military engines, which might have been
put on board the gallies, could not do much execution, the waves were so very
tu∣multuous.</P>
<P>These obstacles however by no means retard∣ed the enterprizing
resolutions of Alexander, but willing to gain a place, rather by treaty than
by the sword, he sent heralds into the place, proposing a peace, between
the Tyrians and him. The citizens however, a tumultuous un∣governable body,
instead of listening to his proposals, instead of endeavouring to avert
his <PB N="204" REF="206"/> resentment, contrary to the law of nations, killed
his heralds, and threw them from the top of the walls into the sea. This
outrage inflamed Alexander's passions to the highest degree, he
resolved upon the city's destruction, and sat down before it with
persevering resentment. His first endeavour was to form a pier jutting
from the continent, and reaching to the city which was built upon an island.
From the foun∣dations of an ancient city upon the shore, he dug stones and
rubbish; from mount Lebanus, that hung over the city, he cut down cedars that
served for piles; and thus he began his work without interruption. But the
farther they went from shore, the greater difficulties they met with,
because the sea was deeper, and the workmen were much annoyed by the darts
dis∣charged from the top of the walls. The enemy also who were masters at
sea, coming in great boats, prevented the Macedonians from carry∣ing on their
work with vigour. At last, how∣ever the pile appeared above water, a level of
considerable breadth: then the besieged at last perceived their
rashness; they saw with terror the vastness of the work which the
sea had till then kept from their sight, and now began to attack the
workmen with javelins and wound them at a distance. It was therefore 
<PB N="205" REF="207"/> resolved that skins and sails should be spread
to cover the workmen, and that two wooden towers should be raised at the
head of the bank to prevent the approaches of the enemy. Yet these were
burned soon after by the besieged, together with all the wood-work
composing the pile that could be touched by the fire.</P>
<P>Alexander though he saw most of his designs defeated, and his
works demolished, was not at all dejected upon that account. His soldiers
en∣deavoured with redoubled vigour, to repair the ruins of the bank; and made
and planted new machines, with such prodigious speed as quite
astonished the enemy. Alexander himself was present on all occasions,
and superintended every part of the works. His presence and great
abi∣lities advanced these still more, than the mul∣titude of hands employed
in them. The whole was near finished, and brought almost to the wall of the
city, when there arose on a sudden an impetuous wind, which drove the waves
with so much fury against the mole, that the cement and other things that
barr'd it, gave way, and the water rushing through the stones, broke it in
the middle. As soon as the great heap of stones which supported the earth
was thrown down, the whole sunk at once as into an abyss.</P>
<P>Any warrior but Alexander would that instant have quite laid
aside his enterprize; and indeed <PB N="206" REF="208"/> he himself debated
whether he should not raise the siege. But a superior Power, who had
foretold and sworn the ruin of Tyre, and whose orders this prince only
executed, prompted him to continue the siege; and, dispelling all his fear
and anxiety, inspired him with courage and confidence, and fired the
breasts of his whole army with the same sentiments. For now the
soldiers, as if but that moment arrived be∣fore the city, forgetting all the
toils they had undergone, began to raise a new mole, at which they worked
incessantly.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Alexander being con∣vinced that while the enemy
remained masters at sea, the city could not be taken, with great diligence
procured a fleet from various parts, and embarking himself, with some
soldiers from among his guard, he set sail towards the Tyrian fleet,
forming a line of battle. The Tyrians were at first determined to oppose
him openly; but perceiving the superiority of his forces, they kept all the
gallies in their harbour, to pre∣vent the enemy from entering there. Alexander
therefore was contented to draw up his ships near the bank along the shore,
where they rode in safety, and kept the enemy from annoying his workmen, who
were employed upon the bank.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209"/> The besiegers, thus protected, went on with
great vigour. The workmen threw into the sea whole trees, with all their
branches on them; and laid great stones over these, on which they put other
trees, and the latter they covered with clay, which served instead of
mortar. Afterwards, heaping more trees and stones on these, the whole, thus
joined together, formed one entire body. This bank was made wider than the
former ones; in order that the towers that were built in the middle, might be
out of the reach of such arrows as should be shot from those ships
which might attempt to break down the edges of the bank. Thus, after many
delays, the patience of the workmen surmounting every obstacle, it was at
last finished in its utmost perfection. The Mace∣donians placed military
engines of all kinds on the bank, in order to shake the walls with
battering-rams, and hurl on the besieged ar∣rows, stones, and burning
torches. Thus, by degrees, approaching to the foot of the wall, the Tyrians
were attacked in close combat, and invested on all sides, both by sea
and land.</P>
<P>A general attack was now therefore thought necessary; and the
king manning his gallies, which he had joined to each other, ordered them to
approach the walls about midnight, <PB N="208" REF="210"/> and attack the city
with resolution. The Ty∣rians now gave themselves over for lost; when on
a sudden the sky was overspread with such thick clouds, as quite took
away the faint glimmerings of light which before darted through the gloom; the
sea rose by insensible degrees, and the billows being swelled by the
fury of the winds, encreased to a dreadful storm; the vessels dashed
one against the other with so much violence, that the cables, which before
fastened them together, were either loosened or broke to pieces; the planks
split, and making a horrible crash, carried off the soldiers with them;
for the tempest was so furious, that it was not possible to manage or
steer the gallies thus fastened together. At last, however, they brought
them near the shore, but the greatest part were in ashattered
condition.</P>
<P>This good fortune of the Tyrians was coun∣terbalanced by an
unexpected calamity; they had long expected succours from Carthage, a
flourishing colony of their own, but they now received advice from thence
that the Car∣thaginians were absolutely unable to give them any
assistance; being over-awed themselves by a powerful army of
Syracusans, who were laying waste their country. The Tyrians therefore,
frustrated in their hopes, still maintained their <PB N="209" REF="211"/>
resolution of defending themselves to the last extremity; and accordingly
sent off their women and children to Carthage, as being of no use in the
defence of their city.</P>
<P>And now the engines playing, the city was warmly attacked on all
sides, and as vigorously defended. The besieged, taught and animated by
imminent danger, and the extreme necessity to which they were reduced,
invented daily new arts, to defend themselves, and repulse the enemy. They
warded off all the darts dis∣charged from the balistas against them, by
the assistance of turning-wheels, which either broke them to pieces, or
carried them another way. They deadened the violence of the stones that were
hurled at them, by setting up a kind of sails and curtains, made of a
soft substance, which easily gave way. To annoy the ships which
advanced against their walls, they fixed grappling irons and scythes to
joists or beams; then straining their catapultas (an enormous kind of
cross-bow), they laid those great pieces of timber upon them instead of
arrows, and shot them off on a sudden at the enemy: these crushed
some to pieces by their great weight; and the hooks, or pensile scythes,
with which they were armed, tore others to pieces, and did considerable
damage to their ships. They also <PB N="210" REF="212"/> had brazen
shields, which they drew red-hot out of the fire; and, filling these with
burning sand, hurled them in an instant from the top of the wall upon the
enemy. There was nothing the Macedonians so much dreaded as this last
in∣vention; for, the moment this burning sand got to the flesh, through the
crevices in the armour, it pierced to the very bone, and stuck so close
that there was no pulling it off; so that the soldiers throwing down their
arms, and tearing their cloaths to pieces, were in this manner ex∣posed,
naked and defenceless, to the shot of the enemy. It was now thought that
Alexander, quite discouraged with his loss, was determined to re∣linquish
the siege; but he resolved to make a last effort, with a great number of
ships, which he manned with the flower of his army. Ac∣cordingly, a second
naval engagement was fought; in which the Tyrians, after fighting with
intrepidity, were obliged to draw off their whole fleet towards the city. The
king pursued their rear very close, but was not able to enter the harbour,
being repulsed by arrows shot from the walls: however, he either took or
sunk a great number of their ships.</P>
<P>Both the attack and defence were now more vigorous than ever. The
courage of the com∣batants increased with the danger; and each 
<PB N="211" REF="213"/> side, animated by the most powerful motives, fought
like lions. Wherever the battering-rams had beat down any part of the wall, and
the bridges were thrown out, instantly the Argy∣raspides mounted the breach
with the utmost valour, being headed by Admetus, one of the bravest
officers in the army, who was killed by the thrust of a spear, as he was
encouraging his soldiers. The presence of the king, and especially the
example he set, fired his troops with unusual bravery. He himself
ascended one of the towers, which was of a prodigious height, and there was
exposed to the greatest dangers his courage had ever made him hazard; for
being immediately known, by his insignia, and the richness of his armour,
he served as a mark for all the arrows of the enemy. On this occasion he
performed wonders; killing with javelins several of those who defended the
wall; then advancing nearer to them, he forced some with his sword, and
others with his shield, either into the city or the sea; the tower where he
fought almost touching the wall. He soon ascended the wall, by the
assistance of floating bridges; and, followed by the principal officers,
possessed himself of two towers, and the space between them. The
battering-rams had already made several breaches; the fleet had forced into
the <PB N="212" REF="214"/> harbour; and some of the Macedonians had
possessed themselves of the towers which were abandoned. The Tyrians
seeing the enemy master of their rampart, retired towards an open place,
called Agenor, and there stood their ground; but Alexander marching up with
his regiment of body-guards, killed part of them, and obliged the rest to
fly. At the same time Tyre being taken on that side which lay towards the
harbour, the Macedonians ran up and down every part of the city, sparing no
person who came in their way, being highly exasperated at the long
resistance of the besieged, and the bar∣barities they had exercised
towards some of their comrades, who had been taken in their return to Sidon,
and thrown from the battle∣ments, after their throats had been cut, in the
sight of the whole army. The Tyrians, thus reduced to the last extremity,
shut themselves up in their houses, to avoid the sword of the
conqueror; others rushed into the midst of the enemy, to sell their lives
as dearly as they could; and some threw stones from the tops of the
houses, to crush the sailors below: the old men waited at their doors,
expecting every instant to be sacrificed, from the rage of the soldiers.
In this general carnage, the Sidonian soldiers alone, that were in
Alexander's army, seemed <PB N="213" REF="215"/> touched with pity for the
fate of their wretched inhabitants: they gave protection to many of the
Tyrians, whom they considered as country∣men, and carried great numbers of
them pri∣vately on board their ships. The numbers that were thus
slaughtered by the enraged soldiers, were incredible: even after
conquest, the victor's resentment did not subside; he ordered no less
than two thousand men, that were taken in the storm, to be nailed to
crosses along the shore. The number of prisoners amounted to thirty
thousand, and were all sold as slaves, in different parts of the world.
Thus fell Tyre, that had been for many ages the most flourishing city in
the world, and had spread the arts of commerce into the remotest
regions.</P>
<P>Whilst Alexander was carrying on the siege of Tyre, he received
a second letter from Darius, in which that monarch seemed more sensible
of his power than before; he now gave him the title of king, and offered him
ten thousand ta∣lents as a ransom for his captive mother and wife; he
offered him his daughter Statira in marriage, with all the country he had
con∣quered, as far as the river Euphrates; he hinted to him the inconstancy
of fortune, and described at large the powers he was still
pos∣sessed of to oppose. These terms were so con∣siderable, 
<PB N="214" REF="216"/> that when the king debated upon them in council,
Parmenio, one of his generals, could not help observing, That if he were
Alexander, he would agree to such a proposal; to which Alexander nobly
replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"And so would I, were I Parmenio:"</Q> He
therefore treated the proposals of Darius with haughty contempt, and
refused to accept of treasures which he already considered as his own.
From Tyre Alexander marched to Jerusalem, fully resolved to punish that
city, for having refused to supply his army with provisions during the
late siege; but the resentment of the conqueror was averted, by meeting a
procession of the in∣habitants of that city on his way, marching out to
receive him, dressed in white, with a Jewish high-priest before them,
with a mitre on his head, on the front of which the name of God was written.
The moment the king perceived the high-priest, he advanced towards him with
an air of the most profound respect, bowed his body, adored the august
name upon his front, and saluted him who wore it with religious veneration.
Then the Jews, surrounding Alex∣ander, raised their voices to wish him
every kind of prosperity. All the spectators were seized with
inexpressible surprise; they could scarce believe their eyes; and did
not know <PB N="215" REF="217"/> how to account for a sight so contrary to
their expectation, and so vastly improbable.</P>
<P>Parmenio, who could not yet recover from his astonishment,
asked the king how it came to pass that he who was adored by every one,
adored the high-priest of the Jews: 
<Q REND="inline">"I do not," replied Alexander, "adore the
high-priest, but the God whose minister he is; for whilst I was at Dia
in Macedonia, my mind wholly fixed on the great design of the Persian
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ar, as I was revolving the methods
how to conquer Asia, this very man, dressed in the same robes, appeared
to me in a dream, exhorted me to banish my fear, bade me cross the
Hellespont boldly, and assured me that God would march at the head of my
army, and give me the victory over that of the Persians."</Q> This speech,
delivered with an air of sincerity, no doubt had its effect in encouraging
the army, and establishing an opinion that Alexander's mission was from
Heaven. Alexander having embraced the high-priest, was conducted by him to
the temple, where, after he had explained to him many prophecies in different
parts of the Old Testament, concerning his invasion, he taught him to offer
up a sacrifice in the Jewish manner.</P>
<P>Alexander was so much pleased with his re∣ception upon this
occasion, that, before he left <PB N="216" REF="218"/> Jerusalem, he
assembled the Jews, and bade them ask any favour they should think
proper. Their request was, To be allowed to live ac∣cording to their ancient
laws and maxims; to be exempted from tribute every seventh year, as they were
by their laws exempted from la∣bour, and could consequently have no
harvests: they requested, that such of their brethren as were settled
in Asia, should be indulged in the same privileges. Thus, being gratified
in all their desires, great numbers of them offered to enlist themselves
in his army. Soon after the Samaritans demanded the same favours; but he gave
them an evasive answer, and promised to take the matter into
consideration, upon his return.</P>
<P>From this city he went on to Gaza, where he found a more obstinate
resistance than he had expected; but at length taking the town by storm,
and having cut the garrison, consisting of ten thousand men, to pieces,
with brutal fero∣city, he ordered Boetis, the governor, to be brought before
him; and having in vain en∣deavoured to intimidate him, commanded, at last,
that holes should be bored through his heels, and thus to be tied by cords to
the back of his chariot, and in this manner to be dragged round the walls of
the city. This he did in <PB N="217" REF="219"/> imitation of Achilles, whom
Homer describes as having dragged Hector round the walls of Troy in the
same manner; but it was reading the poet to very little advantage, to imitate
his hero in the most unworthy part of his cha∣racter.</P>
<P>As soon as Alexander had ended the siege of Gaza, he left a
garrison there, and turned the whole power of his arms towards Egypt. In
seven days march he arrived before Pelusium, whither a great number of
Egyptians had as∣sembled, with all imaginable diligence, to own him for
their sovereign; being heartily displeased with the Persian government,
as likewise the Persian governors; as the one destroyed their liberty,
the other ridiculed their religion. Masaeus, the Persian governor, who
commanded in Memphis, finding it would be to no purpose for him to resist
so triumphant an army, and that Darius, his sovereign, was not in a
con∣dition to succour him, set open the gates of the city to the conqueror,
and gave up eight hundred talents, (about one hundred and forty thousand
pounds) and all the king's furniture. Thus Alexander possessed
himself of all Egypt, without meeting with the least opposition.</P>
<P>He now therefore formed a design of visiting the temple of
Jupiter. This temple was situated <PB N="218" REF="220"/> at a distance of
twelve days journey from Memphis, in the midst of the sandy desarts of
Lybia. Alexander having read in Homer, and other fabulous authors of antiquity,
that most of the heroes were represented as the sons of some deity, was
willing himself to pass for a hero, and knew that he could bribe the
priests to compliment him, as of celestial origin. Setting out therefore
along the river Memphis, and after having passed Canopus, opposite the
island of Pharos, he there laid the foundation of the city of Alexandria,
which in a little time became one of the most flourishing towns for
commerce in the world. From thence he had a journey of three hundred and forty
miles to the temple of Jupiter; the way leading through inhospitable
desarts, and plains of sand. The soldiers were patient enough for the two
first days march, before they arrived amidst the dreadful solitudes; but
as soon as they found themselves in vast plains, covered with sands of
a prodigious depth, they were greatly ter∣rified. Surrounded as with a sea,
they gazed round as far as their sight could extend, to discover if
possible, some place that was in∣habited; but all in vain, for they could
not perceive so much as a single tree, nor the least footsteps of any
land that had been cultivated. <PB N="219" REF="221"/> To increase their
calamity, the water that they had brought in goat-skins, upon camels, now
failed, and there was not so much as a single drop in all that sandy
desart. They were however greatly refreshed by the accidental falling of a
shower, which served to encourage them in their progress, till they came
to the temple of the Deity. Nothing can be more fanciful than the description
the historians have given us of this gloomy retreat: it is represented as a
small spot of fertile ground, in the midst of vast solitudes of
sand; it is covered with the thickest trees, that exclude the rays of the
sun; and watered with several springs, which pre∣served it in perpetual
verdure; near the grove where the temple stood was the Fountain of the Sun,
which at day-break was luke-warm, at noon cold, then towards evening
insensibly grew warmer, and was boiling hot at midnight. The god
worshipped in this place, had his statue made of emeralds, and other
precious stones: and from the head to the navel re∣sembled a ram. No
sooner had Alexander appeared before the altar, than the high priest
declared him to be the son of Jupiter; the conqueror quite intoxicated with
adulation, asked, Whether he should have success in his expedition; the
priest answered, That he should <PB N="220" REF="222"/> be monarch of the
world: the conqueror en∣quired, If his father's murderers were punished; the
priest replied, That his father Jupiter was immortal, but that the murderers
of Philip had been all extirpated.</P>
<P>Alexander having ended his sacrifice, and rewarded the priests,
who had been so liberal of their titles, from that time supposed
himself or would have it supposed, that he was the son of Jupiter. Upon
his return from the temple, and during his stay in Egypt, he settled the
government of that country upon the most solid foundation; he divided it
into districts, over each of which he appointed a lieutenant, who re∣ceived
orders from himself alone. And thus having settled affairs there, he set
out, in the beginning of spring, to march against Darius<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who was now preparing to oppose him.
He made some stay at Tyre, to settle the various affairs of the countries
he had left behind; and advanced towards new conquests. On his march<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the wife of Darius died in child-bed, and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> honoured with a funeral ceremony, due
to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> exalted character. He
continued his journey towards the Tygris, where he at last expected to come
up with the enemy, and to strik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
one blow, which should decide the fate o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nations.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="223"/> Darius had already made overtures of peace to
him twice; but finding at last that there were no hopes of their concluding
one, unless he resigned the whole empire to him, prepared himself again
for battle. For this purpose, he assembled in Babylon an army half as
numerous again as that at Issus, and marched it towards Nineveh. His forces
co∣vered all the plains of Mesopotamia. Advice being brought that the enemy
was not far off, he caused Satropates, colonel of the cavalry, to advance at
the head of a thousand chosen horse; and likewise gave six thousand
to Ma∣saeus, governor of the province; all whom were to prevent Alexander
from crossing the river, and to lay waste the country through which that
monarch was to pass. But he arrived too late.</P>
<P>The Tygris is the most rapid river of all the east; and it was
with some difficulty that Alex∣ander's soldiers were able to stem the
current, carrying their arms over their heads. The king walked on foot among
the infantry, and pointed out with his hand the passage to his soldiers:
he commanded them, with a loud voice, To save nothing but their arms; and let
their baggage that retarded them in the water, float away with the stream. At
length <PB N="222" REF="224"/> they were drawn up in battle-array on the
opposite shore; and encamped two days near the river, still prepared for
action. An eclipse of the moon, which happened about that time, gave
Alexander's soldiers great unea∣siness; but he brought forward some
Egyptian soothsayers, who assured the army, That the moon portended
calamities not to the Greeks, but the Persians. By this artifice the hopes
and the courage of the soldiers being revived once more, the king led them on
to meet the enemy, and began his march at midnight. On his right hand lay the
Tygris, and on his left the Gordylean mountains. At break of day, news was
brought, that Darius was but twenty miles from the place they then were. All
things now therefore threatened an approaching battle; when Darius, who had
already twice sued for peace, sent new conditions, still more
advantageous than the former. But Alexander refused his offers; proudly
replying, That the world would not permit two suns nor two sovereigns. Thus
all negociation being at an end, both sides prepared for battle; equally
irritated, and equally ambitious. Darius pitched his camp near a village called
Gangamila, and the river Bumila, in a plain at a consi∣derable distance
from Arbela. He had before <PB N="223" REF="225"/> levelled the spot, which he
pitched upon for the field of battle, in order that his chariots and cavalry
might have full room to move in; that his fighting in the streights of
Cilicia, had lost him the battle fought there.</P>
<P>Alexander upon hearing this news, continued four days in the place
he then was to rest his army, and surrounded his camp with trenches and
pallisadoes; for he was determined to leave all his baggage, and the
useless soldiers in it, and march the remainder against the enemy, with
no other equipage than the arms they car∣ried. Accordingly he set out about
nine in the evening, in order to fight Darius at day break; who, upon this
advice had drawn up his army in order of battle. Alexander also marched in
battle-array; for both armies were within two or three leagues of each other.
When he was arrived at the mountains, where he could dis∣cover the enemy's
army, he halted; and having assembled his general officers, as well
Macedo∣nians as foreigners, he debated whether they should engage
immediately, or pitch their camp in that place. The latter opinion being
fol∣lowed, because it was judged proper for them to view the field of battle,
and the manner in which the enemy was drawn up, the army en∣camped in the
same order in which it had <PB N="224" REF="226"/> marched; during which
Alexander at the head of his infantry lightly armed, and his royal regi∣ments,
marched round the plain in which the battle was to be fought.</P>
<P>Being returned, he assembled his general of∣ficers a second
time, and told them, that there was no occasion for making a speech,
because their courage and great actions were alone suf∣ficient to excite
them to glory; and he desired them only to represent to the soldiers,
that they were not to fight on this occasion for Phoenicia or Aegypt, but for
all Asia, which would be possessed by him who should conquer; and
tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after having gone through so
many provinces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and left behind them
so great a number of ri¦vers and mountains; they could secure their
re¦treat no otherwise, than by gaining a complea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> victory. After this speech, he ordered them to take
some repose.</P>
<P>It is said Parmenio advised him to attack the enemy in the night
time, alledging, that they might easily be defeated, if fallen upon by
sur¦prize and in the dark; but the king answered so loud, that all
present might hear him; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it
did not become Alexander to steal a victory<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and therefore he was resolved to fight and con¦quer in broad day
light. This was a haughty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but at
the same time, a prudent answer; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <PB N="225" REF="227"/> it was running great hazard, to fall upon
so numerous an army in the night time and in an unknown country. Darius
fearing he should be attacked at unawares, because he had not intrenched
himself, obliged his soldiers to con∣tinue the whole night under arms,
which prov∣ed of the highest prejudice to him in the en∣gagement. In the mean
time Alexander went to bed to repose himself the remaining part of the
night. As he revolved in his mind, not without some emotion, the
consequence of the battle, which was upon the point of being fought, he could
not sleep immediately. But his body being oppressed in a manner by the
anxiety of his mind, he slept soundly the whole night, contrary to his
usual custom, so that when his generals were assembled at day-break
before his tent, to receive his orders, they were greatly surprized to find
he was not awake; upon which they themselves commanded the soldiers to take
some refreshment. Parmenio having at last awaked him, and seeming
surprized to sind him in so calm and sweet a sleep, just as he was
going to fight a battle in which his whole fortune lay at stake, How could it
be possible, said Alexander, for me not to be calm, since the enemy is
coming to deliver himself into my hands? Upon this he immediately took up his
<PB N="226" REF="228"/> arms, mounted his horse, and rode up and down the
ranks, exhorting the troops to behave gal∣lantly, and if possible, to
surpass their-ancient fame, and the glory they had hitherto acquired.</P>
<P>There was a great difference between the two armies in respect to
numbers, but much more with regard to courage. That of Darius con∣sisted at
least of six hundred thousand foot and forty thousand horse; and the
other of no more than forty thousand foot, and seven or eight thousand
horse, but the latter was all fire and strength; whereas on the side of
the Persians it was a prodigious assemblage of men, not of soldiers; an
empty phantom rather than a real army. Both sides were disposed in very
near the same array. The forces were drawn up in two lines, the cavalry on
the two wings, and the infantry in the middle; the one and the other being
under the particular conduct of the chiefs of each of the different nations
that com∣posed them; and commanded in general, by the principal crown
officers. The front of the battle (under Darius) was covered with two hundred
chariots, armed with scythes, and with fifteen elephants, that king taking
his post in the center of the first line. Besides the guards which were
the flower of his forces, he also had fortified himself with the Grecian
infantry, <PB N="227" REF="229"/> whom he had drawn up near his person,
believ∣ing this body only capable of opposing the Ma∣cedonian phalanx. As his
army spread over a much greater space of ground, than that of the enemy, he
intended to surround and to charge them at one and the same time, both in
front and flank, which from Alexander's disposition, he soon after found
impossible.</P>
<P>Darius being afraid lest the Macedonians should draw him from
the spot of ground he had levelled, and carry him into another that was rough
and uneven, commanded the cavalry in his left wing, which spread much farther
than that of the enemy's right, to march direct∣ly forward, and wheel about
upon the Mace∣donians in flank, to prevent them from extend∣ing their troops
farther. Upon which Alexander dispatched against them the body of horse
in his service, commanded by Menidas; but as these were not able to make
head against the enemy, because of their prodigious numbers, he rein∣forced
them with the Paeonians, whom Aretas commanded, and with the foreign cavalry.
Be∣sides the advantage of numbers, the Persians had that also of coats of
mail, which secured them∣selves and their horses much more, and by which
Alexander's cavalry was prodigiously annoyed. However, the Macedonians
marched to the <PB N="228" REF="230"/> charge with great bravery, and at last
put the enemy to flight.</P>
<P>Upon this the Persians opposed the chariots armed with scythes
against the Macedonian phalanx, in order to break it, but with little
success. The noise which the soldiers, who were lightly armed, made by
striking their swords against their bucklers, and the arrows which flew
on all sides, frighted the horses, and made a great number of them turn
back against their own troops. Others laying hold of the horses bridles,
pulled the riders down and cut them to pieces. Part of the chariots drove
between the battalions, which opened to make way for them as they had been
ordered to do, by which means they did little or no execution.</P>
<P>Alexander seeing Darius set his whole army in motion, in order
to charge him, employed a stratagem to encourage his soldiers. When the
battle was at the hottest, and the Macedonians were in the greatest danger,
Aristander the soothsayer, clothed in his white robes, holding a branch
of lawrel in his hand, advances among the combatants as he had been
instructed by the king; and crying, that he saw an eagle hover∣ing over
Alexander's head (a sure omen of vic∣tory) he shewed with his finger, the
pretended bird to the soldiers; who relying upon the sin∣cerity 
<PB N="229" REF="231"/> of the soothsayer, fancied they also saw it; and
thereupon renewed the attack with greater chearfulness and ardour than ever.
Alex∣ander now pressed to the place in which Darius was stationed, and
the presence of the two op∣posing kings inspired both sides with
vigour. Darius was mounted on a chariot, and Alex∣ander on horseback; both
surrounded with their bravest officers and soldiers, whose only
endea∣vours were to save the lives of their respective princes at the
hazard of their own. The battle was obstinate and bloody. Alexander having
wounded Darius's equerry, with a javelin, the Persians as well as Macedonians
imagined that the king was killed; upon which the former, breaking aloud into
the most dismal sounds, the whole army was seized with the greatest
con∣sternation. The relations of Darius, who were at his left hand, fled away
with the guards, and so abandoned the chariot; but those who were at his
right, took him into the center of their body. Historians relate, that this
prince hav∣ing drawn his scymetar, reflected whether he ought not to lay
violent hands upon himself, rather than fly in an ignominious manner. But
perceiving from his chariot, that his soldiers still fought, he was
ashamed to forsake them; and as divided between hope and despair, the 
<PB N="230" REF="232"/> Persians retired insensibly and thinned their
ranks, when it could no longer be called a battle, but a slaughter. Then
Darius turning about his chariot, fled with the rest; and the conqueror was
now wholly employed in pur∣suing him. But in the mean time, finding that the
left wing of his army, which was commanded by Parmenio, was in great danger,
Alexander was obliged to desist from pursuing Darius, whom he had
almost overtaken, and wheeled round to attack the Persian horse, that,
after plundering the camp, were retiring in good order; them he cut in pieces;
and the scale of battle turning in favour of the Macedonians, a total rout of
the Persians ensued. The pursuit was warm, and the slaughter amazing:
Alexander rode as far as Arbela after Darius; every moment hoping to come up
with that monarch: he had just passed through when Alexander arrived, but
he left his treasure, with his bow and shield, as a prey to the enemy.</P>
<P>Such was the success of this famous battle, which gave empire to
the conqueror. Ac∣cording to Arrian, the Persians lost three hundred
thousand men, besides those who were taken prisoners; which at least
is a proof that the loss was very great on their side. That 
<PB N="231" REF="233"/> of Alexander's was very inconsiderable; he not
losing, according to the last mentioned author, above twelve hundred men,
most of whom were horse. This engagement was fought in the month of
October, about the same time, that two years before, the battle of Isus was
fought. As Gangamela, in Assyria, the spot where the two armies engaged,
was a small place of very little note, this was called the battle of Arbela,
that city being nearest to the field of battle.</P>
<P>Darius, after this dreadful defeat, rode to∣wards the river Lycus,
with a very few attend∣ants; he was advised to break down the bridges to
secure his retreat; but he refused, saying, He would not save his life,
at the expence of thousands of his subjects. After riding a great number of
miles full speed, he arrived, at midnight, at Arbela; from thence he fled
to∣wards Media, over the Armenian mountains, followed by his satraps, and a
few of his guards, expecting the worst, despairing of fortune, a wretched
survivor of his country's ruin.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Alexander approached near Babylon; and Mazaeus the
governor, who had retired thither after the battle of Arbela, 
<PB N="232" REF="234"/> surrendered it to him without striking a blow.
Alexander therefore entered the city, at the head of his whole army, as if he
had been marching to a battle. The walls of Babylon were lined with people,
notwithstanding the greatest part of the citizens were gone out before,
from the impatient desire they had to see their new sovereign, whose
renown had far outstripped his march. Bagophanes, governor of the fortress,
and guardian of the treasure, unwilling to discover less zeal than
Mazaeus, strewed the streets with flowers, and raised on both sides of
the way silver altars, which smoaked not only with frankincense, but the
most fragrant perfumes of every kind. Last of all came the presents which
were to be made to the king; <HI>viz.</HI> herds of cattle, and a great number
of horses; as also lions and panthers, which were carried in cages. After
these the Magi walked, singing hymns after the manner of their country;
then the Chaldeans, ac∣companied by the Babylonish soothsayers and
musicians. The rear was brought up by the Babylonish cavalry; of which,
both men and horses were so sumptuous, that imagination can scarce
reach their magnificence. The king caused the people to walk after the
infantry, <PB N="233" REF="235"/> and himself, surrounded with his guards,
and seated on a chariot, entered the city, and from thence rode to the
palace, as in a kind of triumph. The next day he took a view of all Darius's
money and moveables, which amounted to incredible sums, and which he
distributed with generosity among his soldiers. He gave the government of
the province to Mazaeus; and the command of the forces he left there, to
Apollodorus of Amphipolis.</P>
<P>From Rabylon Alexander marched to the province of Syraceni,
afterwards to Susa, where he arrived after a march of twenty days, and found
treasures to an infinite amount. These also he applied to the purposes
of rewarding merit and courage among his troops. In this city he left the
mother and children of Darius; and from thence he went forward, till he came to
a river called, Pasitigris. Having crossed it, with nine thousand foot,
and three thousand horse, consisting of Agrians, as well as of Gre∣cian
mercenaries, and a reinforcement of three thousand Thracians, he entered the
country of Uxii. This region lies near Susa, and extends to the frontiers of
Persia; a narrow pass only lying between it and Susiana. Madathes
commanded this province. He was not a time-server, nor a follower of fortune;
but <PB N="234" REF="236"/> faithful to his sovereign; he resolved to hold
out to the last extremity; and for this purpose, had withdrawn into his own
city, which stood in the midst of craggy rocks, and was surrounded with
precipices. Having been forced from thence, he retired into the citadel, whence
the besieged sent thirty deputies to Alexander, to sue for quarter, which
they obtained at last, by the interposition of Sysigambis. The king not
only pardoned Madathes, who was a near re∣lation of that princess, but
likewise set all the captives, and those who had surrendered
them∣selves, at liberty, permitted them to enjoy their several rights and
privileges, would not suffer the city to be plundered, but let them plough
their lands, without paying any tribute. From thence he passed on to the
pass of Susa, defended by mountains almost inaccessible, and by
Ariobarzanes, with a body of five thousand men; he there stopped for a
while, but being led by a different rout among the mountains, he came over the
pass and so cut the army that defended it in pieces.</P>
<P>Alexander, from an effect of the good for∣tune which constantly
attended him in all his undertakings, having extricated himself hap∣pily out
of the danger to which he was so lately exposed, marched immediately
towards <PB N="235" REF="237"/> Persia. Being on the road, he received letters
from Tiridates, governor of Persepolis, which informed him, that the
inhabitants of that city, upon the report of his advancing towards him, were
determined to plunder Darius's treasures, with which he was intrusted; and
therefore, that it was necessary for him to make all the haste imaginable
to seize them himself; that he had only the Araxes to cross, after which
the road was smooth and easy. Alexander, upon this news, leaving his
infantry behind, marched the whole night at the head of his cavalry, who were
very much harrassed by the length and swiftness of his march, and
passed the Araxes, on a bridge, which, by his order, had been but some
days before.</P>
<P>But as he drew near the city, he perceived a large body of men, who
exhibited a memorable example of the greatest misery. These were about
four thousand Greeks, very far advanced in years, who having been made
prisoners of war, had suffered all the torments which the Persian tyranny
could inflict. The hands of some had been cut off, the feet of others; and
others again had lost their noses and ears. They appeared like so many
shadows, rather than like men; speech being almost the only thing by
which they were known to be such. <PB N="236" REF="238"/> Alexander could not
refrain from tears at this sight; and as they irresistably brought him to
commiserate their condition, he bade them, with the utmost tenderness,
not to despond; and assured them, that they should again see their
wives and country. They chose, however, to remain in a place where misfortune
now be∣came habitual; wherefore he rewarded them li∣berally for their
sufferings, and commanded the governor of the province to treat them with
mildness and respect. The day following he en∣tered the city of
Persepolis, at the head of his victorious soldiers; who, though the
inhabitants made no resistance, began to cut in pieces all those who
still remained in the city. However, the king soon put an end to the
massacre, and forbid his soldiers further violence. The riches he had
found in other places, were but trifling, when compared to those he found
here. This however, did not save the city; for being one day at a banquet
among his friends, and hap∣pening to drink to excess, the conversation ran
upon the various cruelties exercised by the Persians in Greece,
particularly at Athens Thais, an Athenian courtezan, urged the pu∣sillanimity
of not taking revenge for such re∣peated slaughters. All the guests
applauded the discourse; when immediately the king rose from 
<PB N="237" REF="239"/> table (his head being crowned with flowers), and taking
a torch in his hand, he advanced forward, to execute his mad exploit. The whole
company followed him, breaking into loud acclamations, and, after singing and
dancing, surrounded the palace. All the rest of the Macedonians, at this
noise, ran in crowds, with lighted tapers, and set fire to every part of
it. However, Alexander was sorry not long after for what he had done; and
thereupon gave orders for extinguishing the fire; but it was too late.</P>
<P>While Alexander was thus triumphing in all the exultation of
success, the wretched Darius was by this time arrived at Ecbatana, the
ca∣pital of Media. There remained still with this fugitive prince thirty
thousand foot; among whom were four thousand Greeks, that were faithful to
him to the last: besides these he had four thousand slingers, and
upwards of three thousand Bactrian horse, whom Bessus, their go∣vernor,
commanded. Darius, even with so small a force, still conceived hopes of
opposing his rival; or at least of protracting the war: but he was
surrounded with traitors; his want of success had turned all mankind
against him; but Nabarzanes, one of the greatest lords of Persia, and
general of the horse, had conspired <PB N="238" REF="240"/> with Bessus,
general of the Bactrians, to commit the blackest of all crimes, and that was,
to seize upon the person of the king, and lay him in chains, which they
might easily do; as each of them had a great number of sol∣diers under his
command. Their design was, if Alexander should pursue them, to secure
themselves, by giving up Darius alive into his hands; and, in case they
escaped, to murder that prince, and afterwards usurp his crown, and begin a
new war. These traitors soon won over the troops, by representing to
them, that they were going to their destruction; that they would soon be
crushed under the ruins of an empire, which was just ready to fall, at the
same time that Bactriana was open to them, and offered them immense riches.
These promises soon prevailed upon the per∣fidious army; the traitors
seized, and bound their monarch in chains of gold, under the appearance of
honour, as he was a king; then enclosing him in a covered chariot, they set
out towards Bactriana. In this man∣ner they carried him, with the utmost
dis∣patch; until being informed that the Grecian army was still hotly
pursuing them, they found it impossible either to conciliate the
friendship of Alexander, or to secure a throne for them∣selves: 
<PB N="239" REF="241"/> they therefore once more gave Darius his liberty, and
desired him to make the best of his escape with them from the conqueror;
but he replied, That the gods were ready to revenge the evils he had already
suffered; and, appeal∣ing to Alexander for justice, refused to follow a
band of traitors. At these words they fell into the utmost fury,
thrusting him with their darts and their spears, and left him to linger in
this manner, unattended, the remains of his wretch∣ed life. The traitors then
made their escape dif∣ferent ways; while the victorious Macedonians at length
coming up, found Darius in a soli∣tude, lying in his chariot, and drawing
near his end. However, he had strength enough before he died, to call for
drink; which a Macedonian, Polystratus by name, brought him. He had a
Persian prisoner, whom he employed as his interpreter. Darius, after
drinking the liquor that had been given him, turned to the Mace∣donian, and
said, That in the deplorable state to which he was reduced, he however
should have the comfort to speak to one who could understand him; and
that his last words would not be lost. He therefore charged him to tell
Alexander, That he had died in his debt, that he gave him many thanks, for the
great hu∣manity he had exercised towards his mother, <PB N="240" REF="242"/>
his wife, and his children, whose lives he had not only spared, but
restored to their former splendor: that he besought the gods to give
victory to his arms, and make him monarch of the universe; that he thought he
need not intreat him to revenge the execrable murder commited on his person,
as this was the common cause of kings.</P>
<P> After this, taking Polystratus by the hand, 
<Q REND="inline">"Give him," said he, "thy hand, as I give thee
mine; and carry him, in my name, the only pledge I am able to give of my
grati∣tude and affections:"</Q> saying these words, he breathed his
last.</P>
<P>Alexander coming up a moment after, and seeing Darius's body, he
wept bitterly; and by the strongest testimonies of affection that could
be given, proved how intimately he was affected with the unhappiness of a
prince who deserved a better fate. He immediately pulled off his military
cloak, and threw it on Darius's body; then causing it to be embalmed, and his
coffin to be adorned with royal magnificence, he sent it to Sysigambis, to
be interred with the honours usually paid to the deceased Persian
monarchs, and entombed with his ancestors. Thus died Darius, in the fiftieth
year of his age; six of which he reigned with felicity: in him 
<PB N="241" REF="243"/> the Persian empire ended, after having existed, from
the time of Cyrus the Great, a period of two hundred and ninety-nine years.</P>
<P>The death of Darius only served to inflame the spirit of
ambition in Alexander to pursue further conquests. After having in vain
at∣tempted to pursue Bessus, who now assumed the name of king, he
desisted, in order to cross Parthia; and in three days arrived on the
frontiers of Hyrcania, which submitted to his arms. He afterwards subdued
the Mandii, the Arii, the Drangae, the Arachosii, and several other
nations; into which his army marched with greater speed, than people
ge∣nerally travel. He frequently would pursue an enemy for whole days and
nights together; almost without suffering his troops to take any rest. By
this prodigious rapidity, he came unawares upon nations who thought him at a
great distance; and subdued them, before they had time to put themselves
in a posture of defence.</P>
<P>It was upon one of these excursions that Thalestris, queen of
the Amazons, came to pay him a visit. A violent desire of seeing
Alexander, had prompted that princess to leave her dominions, and travel
through a great number of countries to gratify her curiosity. 
<PB N="242" REF="244"/> Being come pretty near his camp, she sent word, That
a queen was come to visit him; and that she had a prodigious inclination to
cultivate his acquaintance; and accordingly was arrived within a little
distance from that place. Alexander having returned a favour∣able answer,
she commanded her train to stop, and herself came forward, with three
hundred women; and the moment she perceived the king, she leaped from her
horse, having two lances in her right hand. She looked upon the king without
discovering the least sign of admiration, and surveying him
attentively, did not think his stature answerable to his fame; for the
Barbarians are very much struck with a majestic air; and think those only
capable of mighty atchievements, on whom nature has bestowed bodily
advantages. She did not scruple to tell him that the chief motive of her
journey was to have posterity by him; adding, that she was worthy of giving
heirs to his empire. Alexander, upon this request, was obliged to make some
stay in this place; after which, Thalestris returned to her kingdom, and
the king into the province inhabited by the Parthians.</P>
<P>Alexander now enjoying a little repose, aban∣dones himself to
sensuality, and he whom the <PB N="243" REF="245"/> arms of the Persians
could not conquer, fell a victim to their vices. Nothing was now to be seen
but games, parties of pleasure, women and excessive feasting; in which
he used to revel whole days and nights. Not satisfied with the buffoons,
and the performers on instrumental music, whom he had brought with him out
of Greece, he obliged the captive women, whom he carried along with him, to
sing songs, after the manner of their country. He happened, among these
women, to perceive one who appeared in deeper affliction than the rest; and
who, by a modest, and at the same time a noble confusion, discovered a
greater re∣luctance than the others to appear in public. She was a perfect
beauty, which was very much heightened by her bashfulness; whilst she
threw her eyes to the ground, and did all in her power to conceal her face. The
king soon imagined, by her air and mien, that she was not of vulgar birth,
and enquiring himself into it, the lady answered, That she was
grand-daughter to Ochus, who not long before had swayed the Persian
scepter, and daughter of his son; that she had married Hystaspes, who
was related to Darius, and general of a great army. Alexander being touched
with compassion, when he heard the unhappy fate of a princess 
<PB N="244" REF="246"/> of the blood royal, and the sad condition to which
she was reduced, not only gave her liberty, but returned all her
possessions; and caused her husband to be sought for, in order
that she might be restored to him.</P>
<P>But now the veteran soldiers who had fought under Philip, not
having the least idea of sensu∣ality, inveighed publickly against the
prodigious luxury, and the numerous vices which the army had learnt in Susa
and Ecbatena. The king therefore thought that the safest remedy would be to
employ them, and for that pur∣pose led them against Bessus. But as the
army was incumbered with booty and an useless train of baggage, so that
it could scarce move, he first caused all his own baggage to be carried
into a great square, and afterwards that of his army (such things excepted
as were absolutely neces∣sary;) then ordered the whole to be carried from
thence in carts to a large plain. Every one was in great pain to know the
meaning of all this; but after he had sent away the horses, he himself
set fire to his own things, and com∣manded every one to follow his
example.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have seen Alexander triumphing by a course of
virtue, we are now to behold him swollen up by success, spoiled by
flattery and enervated by vices, exhibiting a very <PB N="245" REF="247"/>
doubtful character, and mixing the tyrant with the hero. A conspiracy was
formed against him by one Dymnus; this was communicated by a Macedonian
soldier to Philotas one of Alexander's favourites. Philotas neglected
di∣vulging it to his master; and thus became suspected himself as being
concerned in the conspiracy. Parmenio also the father of this young
favourite became equally obnoxious, and as the suspicion of tyrants is
equally fatal with a conviction, Alexander doomed both to destruction.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the night various parties of guards having been
posted in the several places necessary, some entered the tent of
Phi∣lotas, who was then in a deep sleep; when starting from his slumbers,
as they were putting manacles on his hands, he cried, Alas! my sovereign, the
inveteracy of my enemies has got the better of your goodness. After this they
covered his face and brought him to the palace without uttering a single
word. His hands were tied behind him, and his head cover∣ed with a coarse
worn-out piece of cloth. Lost to himself, he did not dare to look up, or
open his lips; but the tears streaming from his eyes, he fainted away in the
arms of the man who held him. As the standers-by wiped off the tears in which
his face was bathed, recovering <PB N="246" REF="248"/> his speech and his
voice by insensible degrees, he seemed desirous of speaking.</P>
<P>The result of this interview was, that Phi∣lotas should be put
to the rack. The persons who presided on that occasion, were his most
inveterate enemies, and they made him suffer every kind of torture. Philotas
at first disco∣vered the utmost resolution and strength of mind; the
torments he suffered not being able to force from him a single word nor
even so much as a sigh. But at last conquered by pain, he confessed
himself to be guilty, named several accomplices, and even accused his own
father. The next day the answers of Philotas were read in full assembly,
he himself being present. Upon the whole he was unanimously sentenced
to die; immediately after which he was stoned, according to the custom of
Mace∣donia, with some other of the conspirators.</P>
<P>The condemnation of Philotas brought on that of Parmenio: whether it
were that Alex∣ander really believed him guilty, or was afraid of the father,
now he had put the son to death. Polydamus one of the lords of the court, was
appointed to see the execution performed. He had been one of Parmenio's
most intimate friends, if we may give that name to courtiers, who affect only
their own fortunes. This was <PB N="247" REF="249"/> the very reason of his
being nominated, because no one could suspect, that he was sent with
any such orders against Parmenio. He therefore set out for Media, where
that general com∣manded the army, and was intrusted with the king's
treasure, which amounted to an hundred and fourscore thousand talents,
about twenty seven millions sterling. Alexander had given him several
letters for Cleander the king's lieutenant in the province; and for the
prin∣cipal officers. Two were for Parmenio; one of them from Alexander, and the
other sealed with Philotas's seal, as if he had been alive, to prevent the
father from harbouring the least suspicion. Polydamus was but eleven days
on his journey, and alighted in the night-time at Cleander's. After having
taken all the precau∣tions necessary, they went together with a great
number of attendants to meet Parmenio, who at this time was walking in a park
of his own. The moment Polydamus spied him, though at a great distance, he
ran to embrace him with an air of the utmost joy; and after compli∣ments,
intermixed with the strongest indica∣tions of friendship, had passed
on both sides, he gave him Alexander's letter, which opening, and afterwards
that under the name of Phi∣lotas, he seemed pleased with the contents. 
<PB N="248" REF="250"/> At that very instant Cleander thrust a dagger into
his side, then made another thrust in his throat; and the rest gave him
several wounds, even after he was dead. He was at the time of his death
threescore and ten years of age, and had served his master with a
fidelity and zeal which in the end was but very ill rewarded.</P>
<P>In order to prevent the ill consequences that might arise from
the contemplation of these cruelties, Alexander set out upon his march and
continued to pursue Bessus, upon which occasion he exposed himself
to great hardships and dangers. Bessus however was treated by his
followers in the same manner he had treated the king his master:
Spitamenes, his chief confi∣dant, having formed a conspiracy against him,
seized his person, put him in chains, forced the royal robes from his back;
and with a chain round his neck, he was delivered up in the most ignominious
manner to Alexander. The king caused this man to be treated with his usual
cruelty; after reproaching him for his treachery, and causing his nose and
ears to be cut off, he sent him to Ecbatana, there to suffer whatever
punishment Darius's mother should think proper to inflict upon him. Four
trees were bent by main force, one towards the other, and to each of these
trees one of the <PB N="249" REF="251"/> limbs of this traitor's body was
fastened. Af∣terwards these trees being let return to their natural
position, they flew back with so much violence, that each tore away the
limb that was fixed to it, and so quartered him.</P>
<P>Thus uniting in his person at once great cruelty and great
enterprize, Alexander still marched forward in search of new nations whom
he might subdue. A city inhabited by the Branchid he totally overturned, and
massacred all the inhabitants in cool blood, only for be∣ing descended
from some traiterous Greeks, that had delivered up the treasures of a
temple with which they had been intrusted. He then ad∣vanced to the river
Jaxerthes, where he re∣ceived a wound in the leg; from thence he went forward
and took the capital of Sogdiana; he there received an embassy from the
Scy∣thians, who lived free and independent, but now submitted to him. He then
marched to Cyropolis and besieged it. This was the last city of the
Persian empire, and had been built by Cyrus, after whom it was called, and
taking the place he abandoned it to plunder. In this manner he went on
capriciously destroying some towns and building others, settling
colonies in some places, and laying whole provinces waste at his
pleasure. Among his other projects an <PB N="250" REF="252"/> invasion of
the kingdom of Scythia was one; but the crossing of the river Jaxerthes was
by no means an easy task; however Alexander being always foremost in
encountring dangers, led on his troops across the stream, which was very
rapid, and gained a signal victory over the Scythians, who vainly attempted
to oppose him on the other side.</P>
<P>A strong hold called Petra Oxiani, defended by a garrison of
thirty thousand soldiers, with ammunition and provision for two years,
was still considered as impregnable. However as difficulties only seemed
to excite his ambition, his soldiers scaled the cliff, and the barbarians
supposing that the whole Macedonian army was got over their heads,
surrendered upon con∣dition that their lives should be spared; but
Alexander forgetting the faith of treaty and the humanity which became a
soldier on this occasion, caused them all to be scourged with rods, and
afterwards to be fixed to crosses at the foot of the same rock.</P>
<P>After this having subdued the Massagetae and Dahae, he entered
the province of Barsaria, from thence he advanced to Maracander, and
appointed Clytus governor of that province. This was an old officer who had
fought under Philip, and signalized himself on many oc∣casions. 
<PB N="251" REF="253"/> At the battle of the Granicus, as Alexander was fighting
bare-headed and Bo∣saces had his arm raised, in order to strike him
behind, Clytus covered the king with his shield, and cut off the barbarian's
hand. Hellanice, his sister, had nursed Alexander; and he loved her with
as much tenderness as if she had been his own mother.</P>
<P>This favour however, only advanced Clytus to a post of greater
danger; one evening at an entertainment, the king after drinking immo∣derately,
began to celebrate his own exploits; his boasting even shocked those very
persons, who knew that he spoke truth, but particularly the old generals of
his army, whose admira∣tions were ingrossed by the actions of his
fa∣ther. Clytus was intoxicated, and turning about to those who sat below
him at table, quoted to them a passage from Euripides, but in such a
manner that the king could only hear his voice, and not the words distinctly.
The sense of the passage was, That the Greeks had done very wrong in
ordaining, that in the inscriptions en∣graved on trophies, the names of kings
only should be mentioned; because by these means, brave men were robbed
of the glory they had purchased with their blood. The king sus∣pecting
Clytus had let drop some disobliging <PB N="252" REF="254"/>
expressions, asked those who sat nearest him, what he had said.
As no one answered, Clitus, raising his voice by degrees, began to relate
the actions of Philip, and his wars in Greece, prefering them to whatever was
doing at that time; which created a great dispute between the young and old
men. Though the king was prodigiously vexed in his mind, he never∣theless
stifled his resentment, and seemed to listen very patiently to all
Clitus spoke to his prejudice. It is probable he would have quite
suppressed his passion, had Clitus stopped there; but the latter
growing more and more insolent as if determined to exasperate and in∣sult
the king, he went such lengths as to defend Parmenio publickly, and to
assert, that the destroying of Thebes was but trifling, in com∣parison
of the victory which Philip had gained over the Athenians; and that the old
Macedo∣nians, though sometimes unsuccessful, were greatly superior to
those who were so rash as to despise them.</P>
<P>Alexander telling him that in giving cowar∣dice the name of ill
success, he was pleading his own cause; Clitus rises up, with his eyes
sparkling with wine and anger, 
<Q REND="inline">"It is never∣theless this hand (said he to him
extending it at the same time) that saved your life at the 
<PB N="253" REF="255"/> battle of Granicus. It is the blood and wounds of
these very Macedonians who are accused of cowardice, that raised you to
this grandeur; but the tragical end of Parmenio shews, what reward they and
myself may ex∣pect for all our services."</Q> This last reproach stung
Alexander, however he still restrained his passion, and only commanded
him to leave the table. 
<Q REND="inline">"He is in the right (says Clitus as he rose up)
not to bear free-born men at his table, who can only tell him truth. He will do
well to pass his life among barbarians and slaves, who will be proud to pay
their adora∣tion to his Persian girdle and his white robe."</Q> But now the
king, no longer able to suppress his rage, snatched a javelin from one of
his guards, and would have killed Clitus on the spot, had not the courtiers
with-held his arm, and Clitus been forced but with great difficulty out of the
hall. However he returned into it that moment by another door, singing with
an air of insolence, verses reflecting highly on the prince, who seeing
the general near him, struck him with his javelin, and laid him dead at his
feet, crying out at the same time, go now to Philip, to Parmenio and to
Attalus.</P>
<P>The king had no sooner murthered his faithful servant than he
perceived the atroci∣ousness <PB N="254" REF="256"/> of the act; he threw
himself upon the dead body, forced out the javelin and would have destroyed
himself had he not been prevent∣ed by his guards, who seized and carried
him forcibly to his own apartment, where the flat∣tery and the persuasions
of his friends at length served to alleviate his remorse. In order to
di∣vert his melancholy, Alexander having drawn his army out of the garrisons
where they had wintered three months, marched towards a country called Gabana.
In his way he met with a dreadful storm, in which his army suf∣fered
greatly; from thence he went into the country of Sacae, which he soon
over-run and laid waste. Soon after this Axertes one of its monarchs,
received him in his palace, which was adorned with barbarous magnificence. He
had a daughter called Roxana, a young lady whose exquisite beauty was
heightened by all the charms of wit and good sense. Alexander sound her
charms irresistible, and made her his wife; covering his passion with
the specious pretence of uniting the two nations in such bonds as should
improve their mutual har∣mony, by blending their interests, and throw∣ing
down all distinctions between the con∣querors, and the conquered. This
marriage displeased the Macedonians very much, and <PB N="255" REF="257"/>
exasperated his chief courtiers, when it was seen that he made one of his
slaves his father-in-law. But as, after his murdering Clitus, no one dared to
speak to him with freedom, they applauded what he did with their eyes and
countenances, for they had nothing else left that was free.</P>
<P>Alexander having thus conquered all the Persian provinces, now
with boundless ambi∣tion resolved upon a perilous march into India. This
country was considered as the richest in the world, not only in gold but in
pearls and preci∣ous stones; with which the inhabitants adorned themselves;
but being willing either to impress his soldiers with an idea of his
authority, or to imitate the barbarians in the magnificence of their titles, he
was resolved not only to be called, but to be believed the son of Jupiter;
as if it had been possible for him to command as absolutely over the mind
as over the tongue, and that the Macedonians would condescend to fall
prostrate and adore him after the Persian manner.</P>
<P>To sooth and cherish these ridiculous pre∣tensions, there
were not wanting flatterers, those common pests of a court, who are more
dangerous to princes than the arrows of their enemies. But the Macedonians
indeed would <PB N="256" REF="258"/> not stoop to this base adulation; all
of them to a man, refusing to vary in any manner, from the customs of their
country. Among the number who disdained to offer these base adu∣lations,
was Callisthenes the philosopher; but his integrity cost him his life; he
was accused of being privy to a conspiracy formed by Her∣molaus a young
officer, upon the life of the king, and for this reason he was thrown into a
dungeon and loaded with irons, he soon found that he had no mercy to expect;
the most grievous tortures were inflicted upon him, in order to extort a
confession of guilt, but he persisted in his innocence to the last,
and ex∣pired in the midst of his torments.</P>
<P>The kingdom of India for which Alexander now set out was an
extensive territory, which has been usually divided into two
parts.—India on this side and India on the other side of the Ganges.
All the Indians at that time were free, nor even did they adopt the base
custom of the Greeks, in purchasing slaves to do the common offices of
life. The people of that country were then divided into seven classes;
the first and most honourable, though the smallest, were the guardians
of religion; the second and the great∣est, was that of the husbandman,
whose only employment was to cultivate the ground; the <PB N="257" REF="259"/>
third was that of herdsmen and shepherds, who led the herds and flocks
among the mountains; the fourth consisted of tradesmen and mer∣chants,
among whom pilots and seamen were included; the fifth was of soldiers,
whose only employment was war; the sixth was of ma∣gistrates, who
superintended the actions of others, either in cities or in the country, and
reported the whole to the king; the seventh class consisted of
persons employed in the pub∣lick councils, and who shared the cares of
go∣vernment with their sovereign; these orders of state never blended nor
intermarried with each other, none of these were permitted to follow two
professions at the same time, nor quit one class for another.</P>
<P>Alexander having entered India, all the petty kings of the country
came to meet him and make their submissions. On his march he took the
city of Nysa, he then marched to∣wards Daedala and dispersed his army
over the whole country, and took possession of it without
resistance. He afterwards went forward to∣wards the city of Hagosa, which
after being be∣sieged in form, surrendered at discretion. The rock of
Aornos, which was deemed inac∣cessible and which it was said Hercules
himself was not able to take, but the garrison in a panic 
<PB N="258" REF="260"/> delivered it up to his army. From thence he marched to
Acleslimus, and after a march of sixteen days, arrived on the banks of the
great river Indus, where he found that Hephestion had got all things ready
for his passage, pur∣suant to the orders he had before received. Here he
was met by Omphis a king of the country, who did homage to Alexander, and made
him a present of fifty-six elephants, and other animals of prodigious
size. The ambas∣sadors from Abisaries a neighbouring monarch, came with
the same offers, sent presents and promised fidelity; there was still
a third mo∣narch whose name was Porus, from whom Alexander expected similar
submission; he even went to require it of him, but Porus answered with
great coldness; that while he could fight, he should disdain to obey.</P>
<P>In pursuance of this message Alexander re∣solved to enforce
obedience, and giving the superintendance of his elephants to Omphis, who had
now changed his name to Taxilus; he advanced as far as the borders of the
Hy∣daspes. Porus was encamped on the other side of it in order to dispute
the passage with him, and had posted at the head of his army eighty-five
elephants of a prodigious size, and behind them three hundred chariots
guarded by <PB N="259" REF="261"/> thirty thousand foot; not having at most
above seven thousand horse. This prince was mounted upon an elephant of a
much larger size than any of the rest; and he himself exceeded the
usual stature of men; so that, clothed in his armour, glittering with
gold and silver, he appeared at the same time terrible and majestic. The
greatness of his courage equalled that of his stature; and he was as wise
and prudent as it was possible for the monarch of so barbarous a people
to be.</P>
<P>The Macedonians dreaded not only the enemy, but the river they were
obliged to pass. It was four furlongs wide (about four hundred fathoms) and
so deep in every part, that it looked like a sea, and was no where
fordable. It was vastly impetuous, notwithstanding its great breadth; for
it rolled with as much vio∣lence as if it had been confined to a narrow
channel; and its raging, foaming waves, which broke in many places,
discovered that it was full of stones and rocks. However, nothing was so
dreadful as the appearance of the shore, which was quite covered with men,
horses and ele∣phants. Those hideous animals stood like so many towers;
and the Indians exasperated them, in order that the horrid cry they made
might fill the enemy with great terror. However, <PB N="258" REF="262"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="259" REF="263"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="260" REF="264"/> this
could not intimidate an army of men whose courage was proof against all
attacks, and who were animated by an uninterrupted series of prosperities;
but then they did not think it would be possible for them, as the banks
were so crazy, to surmount the rapidity of the stream, or land with
safety.</P>
<P>Alexander was in great perplexity with the difficulties that
attended the passage of this nar∣row river; however, he resolved to
attempt it by night, and chose one whose lightening, thun∣der, and
impetuous winds, conspired to drown the noise of his troops in their
embarkation. Scarce any person appeared to oppose their descent; and the
moment Alexander was landed, he drew up the forces that had passed with
him, consisting of six thousand foot, and five thou∣sand horse, in
order of battle.</P>
<P>Porus, upon hearing that Alexander had passed the river, had
sent against him a detach∣ment, commanded by one of his sons, of two
thousand horse, and one hundred and twenty chariots. Alexander imagined
them at first to be the enemy's van-guard, and that the whole army was behind
them; but being informed it was but a detachment, he charged them with such
vigour, that Porus's son was killed upon the spot, with four hundred
horses, and all the chariots were taken.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="265"/> Porus, upon receiving advice of the death of
his son, the defeat of the detachment, and of Alexander's approach,
resolved to go and meet Alexander, whom he justly supposed to be at the
head of the choicest troops of his army. Accordingly, leaving only a few
elephants in his camp, to amuse those who were posted on the opposite
shore, he set out, with thirty thou∣sand foot, four thousand horse,
three thousand chariots, and two hundred elephants. Being come into a firm,
sandy soil, in which his horses and chariots might wheel about with
ease, he drew up his army in battle-array, with an intent to wait the coming
up of the enemy. He posted in front, and on the first line, all the
elephants, at a hundred feet distance one from the other; in order that they
might serve as a bulwark to his foot, who were behind. It was his opinion,
that the enemy's cavalry would not dare to en∣gage in these intervals,
because of the fear those horses would have of the elephants; and much
less the infantry, when they should see that of the enemy posted behind
the elephants, and in danger of being trod to pieces. He had posted some of
his foot on the same line with the ele∣phants, in order to cover their right
and left; and this infantry was covered by his two wings of horse; before
which the chariots were posted. <PB N="262" REF="266"/> Such was the order and
disposition of Porus's army.</P>
<P>Alexander being come in sight of the enemy, waited the coming up
of his foot, which marched with the utmost diligence, and arrived a little
after; and in order that they might have time to take breath, and not to be
led, as they were very much fatigued, against the enemy, he caused his
horse to make a great many evo∣lutions, in order to gain time. But now every
thing being ready, and the infantry having suf∣ficiently recovered their
vigour, Alexander gave the signal of battle. He did not think proper to begin
by attacking the enemy's main body, where the infantry and the elephants were
posted, for the very reason which had made Porus draw them up in that
manner. But his cavalry being stronger, he drew out the greatest part of
them, and marching against the left wing, sent Coenus, with his own
regiment of horse, and that of Demetrius, to charge them at the same time;
ordering him to attack that cavalry on the left behind, during which he
himself would charge them both in front and flank. Seleucus, Antigonus, and
Tauron, who commanded the foot, were ordered not to stir from their posts,
till Alexander's cavalry had put that of the enemy, as well as their foot, into
disorder.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="267"/> Being come within arrow-shot, he detached a
thousand bow-men on horseback, with orders for them to make their
discharge on the horse of Porus's left wing, in order to throw it into
disorder, whilst he himself would charge this body in flank, before it
had time to rally. The Indians having joined again their squadrons, and drawn
them up into a narrower compass, advanced against Alexander. At that
instant Coenus charged them in the rear, according to the orders given him;
insomuch, that the In∣dians were obliged to face about on all sides, to
defend themselves from the thousand bow-men, and against Alexander and
Coenus. Alexander, to make the best advantage of the confusion into which
this sudden attack had thrown them, charged with great vigour those that
had made head against him; who being no longer able to stand so violent
an attack, were soon broke, and retired behind the elephants, as to an
impreg∣nable rampart. The leaders of the elephants made them advance against
the enemy's horse; but, that very instant, the Macedonian phalanx moving on
a sudden, surrounded those animals, and charged with their pikes the
elephants themselves, and their leaders. This battle was very different from
all those which Alexander had hitherto fought; for the elephants rushing 
<PB N="264" REF="268"/> upon the battalions, broke, with inexpressible fury,
the thickest of them; when the Indian horse, seeing the Macedonian foot
stopped by the elephants, returned to the charge: however, that of Alexander
being stronger, and having greater experience in war, broke this body a
second time, and obliged it to retire towards the elephants; upon which the
Macedonian horse, being all united in one body, spread terror and
confusion wherever they attacked. The elephants, being all covered with
wounds, and the greatest part having lost their leaders, did not observe
their usual order; but, distracted as it were with pain, no longer
distinguished friends from foes; but, running about from place to place,
they overthrew every thing that came in their way. The Macedonians, who had
pur∣posely left a greater interval between their bat∣talions, either made way
for them whenever they came forward, or charged with darts, those that fear
and the tumult obliged to retire. Alexander, after having surrounded the
enemy with his horse, made a signal to his foot to march up with all
imaginable speed, in order to make a last effort, and to fall upon them
with his whole force; all which they executed very successfully. In this
manner the greatest part of the Indian cavalry were cut to pieces; and a 
<PB N="265" REF="269"/> body of their foot, which sustained no
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess loss, seeing themselves
charged on all sides, at last fled. Catorus, who had continued in the camp
with the rest of his army, seeing Alexander en∣gaged with Porus,
crossed the river, and charging the routed soldiers with his troops, who
were cool and vigorous, by that means killed as many enemies in the retreat, as
had fallen in the battle.</P>
<P>The Indians lost, on this occasion, twenty thousand foot, and
three thousand horse; not to mention the chariots, which were all broke to
pieces; and the elephants, that were either killed or taken. Porus's two sons
fell in this battle; with Spitacus, governor of the province; all the colonels
of horse and foot; and those who guided the elephants and chariots. As for
Alexander, he lost but fourscore of the six thousand soldiers who
were at the first charge; ten bow-men of the horse, twenty of his
horse-guards, and two hundred common soldiers.</P>
<P>Porus, after having performed all the duty both of a soldier and a
general in the battle, and fought with incredible bravery, seeing all his
horse defeated, and the greatest part of his foot, did not behave like the
great Darius, who, in a like disaster, was the first that fled: on the
con∣trary, he continued in the field as long as one <PB N="266" REF="270"/>
battalion or squadron stood their ground; but, at last, having received a
wound in the shoulder, he retired upon his elephant; and was easily
distinguished from the rest, by the greatness of his stature, and his
unparelleled bravery. Alex∣ander finding who he was, by those glorious marks,
and being desirous of saving this king, sent Taxilus after him, because
he was of the same nation. The latter, advancing as near to him as he might,
without running any danger of being wounded, called out to him to stop, in
order to hear the message he had brought him from Alexander. Porus turning
back, and seeing it was Taxilus, his old enemy, 
<Q REND="inline">"How!" says he, "is it not Taxilus that calls;
that traitor to his country and kingdom!"</Q> Im∣mediately after which, he
would have transfixed him with his dart, had he not instantly retired.
Notwithstanding this, Alexander was still de∣sirous to save so brave
a prince; and thereupon dispatched other officers, among whom was Meroe, one
of his intimate friends, who besought him, in the strongest terms, to
wait upon a con∣queror altogether worthy of him: after much entreaty, Porus
consented, and accordingly set forward. Alexander, who had been told of his
coming, advanced forwards, in order to receive him, with some of his train.
Being come pretty <PB N="267" REF="271"/> near, Alexander stopped, purposely
to take a view of his stature and noble mien, he being about five cubits in
height. Porus did not seem dejected at his misfortune; but came up with a
resolute countenance, like a valiant warrior, whose courage in defending
his dominions ought to acquire him the esteem of the brave prince who had
taken him prisoner. Alexander spoke first; and, with an august and
gracious air, asked him how he desired to be treated? 
<Q REND="inline">"Like a king," replied Porus.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"But," continued Alexander, "do you ask nothing
more?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No," replied Porus; "all things are included in
that single word."</Q> Alexander, struck with this greatness of soul,
the magnanimity of which seemed heightened by distress, did not only
restore him his kingdom, but annexed other provinces to it, and treated him
with the highest testimonies of honour, esteem, and friendship. Porus
was faithful to him till his death.—It is hard to say, whether the
victor or the van∣quished best deserved praise on this occasion.</P>
<P>Alexander built a city on the spot where the battle had been
fought; and another in that place where he had crossed the river. He called
the one Nicaea, from his victory; and the other Bucephalus, in honour of his
horse, who died there, not of his wounds, but of old age. After 
<PB N="268" REF="272"/> having paid the last duties to such of his
sol∣diers as had lost their lives in battle, he solem∣nised games and
offered up sacrifices of thanks in the place where he had passed the
Hydespes.</P>
<P>Alexander having now conquered Porus, advanced into India, which
having never been a warlike nation, he subdued with the rapidity rather of a
traveller than a conqueror. Num∣berless petty states submitted to him,
sensible that his stay would be short, and his conquests
evanescent.</P>
<P>Alexander, passing near a city where several Brachmans or
Indian priests dwelt, was very desirous to converse with them, and if
possible to prevail with some of them to follow him. Being informed that
these philosophers never made visits, but that those who had an
inclina∣tion to see them must go to their houses, he concluded, that it
would be beneath his dig∣nity to go to them; and not just to force these
sages to any thing contrary to their laws and usages. Onesicritus, the
philosopher, who had been a disciple of Diogenes the Cynick, was de∣puted
to them. He met not far from the city fifteen Boxamins, who from morning till
even∣ing stood always naked, in the same posture in which they at first
had placed themselves, and <PB N="269" REF="273"/> afterwards returned to the
city at night. He addressed himself first to Calanus an Indian,
re∣puted the wisest man of his country, who, though he professed the
practice of the most severe philosophy, had however been persuaded in
his extreme old age to attend upon the court; and him he told the occasion of
his coming. The later gazing upon Onesicritus's clothes and shoes, could
not forbear laughing; after which he told him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That anciently the earth had been covered with
barley and wheat, as it was at that time with dust, that besides water, the
rivers used to flow with milk, ho∣ney, oil and wine."</Q> That man's guilt
had occasioned a change of this happy condition; and that Jupiter, to
punish their ingratitude, had sentenced them to a long painful labour. That
their repentance afterwards moving him to compassion, he had restored
them their for∣mer abundance; however, that by the course of things, they
seemed to be returning to their ancient confusion. This relation shews
evi∣dently, that these philosophers, had some no∣tion of the felicity of
the first man and of the evil to which he had been sentenced for his
sins.</P>
<P> Onesicritus was very urgent with both of them to quit their
austere way of life and fol∣low <PB N="270" REF="274"/> the fortune of
Alexander, saying, 
<Q REND="inline">"That they would find in him a generous master and
benefactor, who would heap upon them honour and riches of all kinds."</Q> Then
Mandanis assuming a haughty philosophical tone, answered, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he did not want Alex∣ander, and was the son
of Jupiter as well as himself. That he was exempted from want, desire or
fear. That so long as he should live, the earth would furnish him with
all things necessary for his subsistence, and that death would rid
him of a troublesome com∣panion (meaning his body) and set him at full
liberty."</Q> Calodanus appeared more tractable, and notwithstanding the
opposition, and even the prohibition of his superior, who reproached him
for his abject spirit in stooping so low as to serve another master
besides God, he followed Onesicritus, and went to Alexan∣der's court, who
received him with great de∣monstrations of joy. As it was Alexander's chief
ambition to imitate Bacchus and Her∣cules in their expeditions into the East,
he re∣solved like them to penetrate as long as he could meet new nations to
conquer, however his soldiers satiated with spoil and fatigued with
repeated encounters, at last began to open their eyes at the wildness of
his ambition. <PB N="271" REF="275"/> Some bewailed their calamities in such
terms as raised compassion, others insolently cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"That they would march no further;"</Q> the chief
object of the King's wishes, was to invade the territories of Agramenes, a
prince who lived beyond the great river Ganges; and who was able to bring into
the field two hundred thou∣sand foot, two thousand elephants, twenty
thou∣sand horse, and two thousand armed chariots. The soldiers however
refused to wander over those great deserts that lay beyond the Ganges,
and more terrible to them than the greatest ar∣my the East could muster;
he addressed them in the most persuasive terms not to leave their
general behind; he threatened them, that he would take his Scythian and his
Persian soldiers, and with them alone he would make conquests worthy of
his name and of his glory; but still the Macedonian soldiers, persisted
sullen and inflexible, and only at last complied after many persuasive
orations to follow him towards the South, to discover the nearest ocean,
and to take the course of the river Indus as their in∣fallible guide.</P>
<P>For this expedition he embarked in a fleet consisting of eight
hundred vessels as well gal∣lies as boats, to carry the troops and
provisions, after five days sailing, the fleet arrived where 
<PB N="272" REF="276"/> the Hydespes and the Acesines mixed their streams,
there the ships were very much shat∣tered, because these rivers unite
with prodigi∣ous rapidity. At last he came to the country of the Oxydrace and
the Mallis, the most va∣liant people in the East, however Alexander
defeated them in several engagements, dispos∣sessed them of their
strong holds, and at last marched against their capital city, where the
greatest part of their forces were retired. It was upon this occasion that
seizing a scaling ladder, himself the first, he mounted the wall,
followed only by two of his officers; his at∣tendants believing him to be in
danger, mount∣ed swiftly to succour him, but the ladder break∣ing, he was
left alone. It was now that his rashness became his safety, for leaping
from the wall into the city which was crouded with enemies, sword in hand, he
repulsed such as were nearest, and even killed the general who advanced
in the throng. Thus with his back to a tree that happened to be near, he
received all the darts of the enemy in a shield, and kept even the boldest
at a distance at last an Indian discharging an arrow of three feet long,
it pierced his coat of mail and his right breast, and so great a quantity
of blood issued from the wound, that he dropped his <PB N="273" REF="277"/>
arms and lay as dead. The Indian came to strip him, supposing him really
what he ap∣peared; but Alexander that instant recalled his spirits and
plunged the dagger in his side. By this time a part of the king's attendants
came to his succour, and forming themselves round his body, till his
soldiers without found means of bursting the gates, saved him, and put
all the inhabitants without distinction to the sword.</P>
<P>The wound which at first seemed dangerous, having in the space
of six or seven days a most favourable appearance, Alexander mounted his
horse, and shewed himself to the army, who seem∣ed to view him with
insatiable pleasure. Thus continuing his voyage, and subduing the country
on each side as he passed along, the pilots per∣ceived from the
softness of the breezes that the ocean was near. Nothing so much
astonished the Macedonian soldiers as the ebbing and flowing of the tide.
They were amazed when they saw it rise to a great height and overflow the
country, which they considered as a mark of divine resentment; they were no
less terrified some hours after, when they saw the river for∣sake its
banks, and leave those lands uncovered it had so lately overflowed. Thus,
after a voy∣age of nine months, he at last stood upon the shore; and
after having offered sacrifices to <PB N="274" REF="278"/> Neptune, and having
looked wishfully on the broad expanse of waters before him, he is said to
have wept for having no more worlds left to conquer. Here he put an end to his
excur∣sions; and having appointed Nearchus admiral of his fleet, with orders
to coast along the In∣dian shore as far as the Persian gulph, he set
out with his army for Babylon.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the hardships which his army sustained in
their return: passing through a country destitute of all sorts of
pro∣visions, they were obliged to feast on the beasts of burden, and were
forced to burn those rich spoils for the sake of which they had
encoun∣tered so many dangers; those diseases also, that generally
accompany famine, compleated their calamity, and destroyed them in great
numbers. After a march of threescore days, they arrived in the province of
Gedrosia, the fertility of which soon banished from the minds of the
soldiery all their former difficulties. Alexander passed through the
country, not with the mili∣tary pomp of a conqueror, but in the licen∣tious
disguise of an enthusiast: still willing to imitate Bacchus, he was
drawn by eight horses, on a scaffold in the form of a square stage,
where he passed the days and nights in feasting. Along the roads where he
passed were placed <PB N="275" REF="279"/> casks of wine in great
abundance, and these the soldiery drained in honour of his mock deity. The
whole country echoed with the sound of instruments and the howling of
bach∣anals, who with their hair dishevelled, with frantic mirth, ran up and
down, abandoning themselves to every kind of lewdness. This vice produced
one of a much more formidable nature in the king's mind; for it always
en∣flamed his passions to cruelty, and the execu∣tioner generally followed
the feast.</P>
<P>While he refreshed his army in these parts, Nearchus was
returned from his expedition along the coast, and brought him strange
ac∣counts of the gold to be found in some islands, and of the wonders that
were to be seen in others; he was therefore commanded to make some further
discoveries; and then enter the mouth of the river Euphrates, to meet the
king at Babylon. He here also executed an act of rigorous justice upon
Cleander and others, who had formerly been the ministers of his ven∣geance in
cutting off Parmenio. Against these murtherers great complaints had been
made by the deputies of the provinces in which they had commanded; and such
was the complexion of their crimes, that nothing but the certain expectation of
Alexander's never returning from <PB N="276" REF="280"/> India, could encourage
them to commit such. All men were glad to see them delivered over to
justice. Cleander, with six hundred soldiers, whom he had employed, were
publickly ex∣ecuted; every one rejoicing, that the anger of the king was at
last turned against the mini∣sters of his vengeance. As Alexander drew
near∣er to Babylon, he visited the tomb of Cyrus, in the city of Pasargada;
and here he put a Persian prince, whose name was Orsines, to death, at
the instigation of Bagoas, an eunuch, who falsely accused Orsines of
robbing the tomb; here also, Calanus, the Indian, having lived four-score
and three years, without ever having been afflicted with sickness, now
feeling the approaches of disorder, resolved to put himself to death.
Alexander imagined he might easily be dissuaded from his design; but
finding, in opposition to all the arguments he could use, that Calanus was
inflexible, he gave orders for erecting a funeral pile for him, upon which the
Indian was resolved to die.</P>
<P>Calanus rode on horseback to the foot of the funeral pile; offered
up his prayers to the gods; caused libations to be performed, and the rest
of the ceremonies to be observed which are practised at funerals; cut off a
tuft of his hair, in imitation of victims; embraced such 
<PB N="277" REF="281"/> of his friends as were present; intreated them to be
merry that day, and to feast and carouse with Alexander; assuring them,
at the same time, that he would soon see that prince in Babylon. After
saying these words, he ascend∣ed, with the utmost chearfulness, the
fu∣neeral pile, laid himself down upon it, and covered his face; and, when
the flame reached him, he did not make the least motion; but with a patience
and constancy that surprised the whole army, continued in the same
posture in which he at first had laid himself, and com∣pleated his
sacrifice, by dying agreeably to the strange superstitions of the
enthusiasts of his country. Alexander punctually obeyed him in his
admonitions to debauchery. A banquet followed the night after, in which
Promacus received a talent as a prize, for having drank the largest quantity
of wine; he survived his victory, however, but three days, and of the rest
of the guests, forty-one died of their intem∣perance. From Pasargada,
Alexander proceed∣ed to Susa, where he married Statira, the eldest daughter
of Darius, and gave her youngest sister in marriage to his favourite
Hephestion. Fourscore Persian ladies of rank were given to the principal
favourites among his captains. The nuptials were solemnized after the
Persian <PB N="278" REF="282"/> manner. He likewise feasted all the
Mace∣donians, who had married before in that country. It is related, that there
were nine thousand guests at this feast, and that he gave each of them a
golden cup for their libations. Upon this occasion, there appeared at Susa,
three hundred young soldiers, dressed in the Macedonian manner, whom
Alexander intend∣ed particularly to favour, in order to check the
licentiousness of his veterans, who had but too just reasons to
murmur.</P>
<P>While Alexander was thus employed in Persia, a new commotion was
carrying on in Greece. Harpalus, whom Alexander had appointed go∣vernor of
Babylon, being disgusted with his mas∣ter's cruelty, and ambitious of
power himself, went over into Greece, with immense sums, which he
raised from the plundered prisoners of Persia. He had credit enough to
assemble a body of six thousand soldiers, and with these he landed
at Athens: money, at that time, being thought all-powerful in Greece, he
lavished immense sums among the mercenary orators, whose business
it was to inflame the minds of the people. Of all these, Phocion alone, to
whom he offered se∣ven hundred talents, preserved his well-known integrity,
and remained inflexible; his dis∣interestedness had long been the object
of ad∣miration, <PB N="279" REF="283"/> even in the time of Philip. Being
offered a great sum of money, if not for his own acceptance, at least for
the benefit of his children: If my children, cried Phocion, re∣semble me, the
little spot of ground, with the produce of which I have hitherto lived, and
which has raised me to the glory you mention, will be sufficient to
maintain them; if it will not, I do not intend to leave them wealth, merely to
stimulate and heighten their luxury. Alexander having likewise sent him
an hundred talents, Phocion asked those who brought them, why Alexander
sent him so great a sum, and did not remit any to the rest of the
Athenians? It is, replied they, because Alexander looks upon you as the only
just and virtuous man. Phocion re∣joined, let him suffer me still to
enjoy that character, and be really what I am taken for. This, therefore, was
not a character to be corrupted; on the contrary, he used all his influence
to prevent the success of Harpalus, who being ordered by the assembly
to depart the city, lost all hopes of success.</P>
<P>This commotion was scarcely quelled when another ensued, in
consequence of a declaration, by which all the Macedonians, who from their
age or infirmities were unable to bear the fa∣tigues <PB N="280" REF="284"/> of
war, should be sent back to Greece. They with seditious cries
unanimously demanded to be entirely discharged from his service,
mur∣muring against him as a despiser of his bravest troops, and as a
cruel king, who wanted not their absence but their destruction. Alexander,
however, acted with that resolution upon this occasion, which always marked
his character. Being seated on his tribunal of justice, he rushed among
the principal mutineers, seized thirteen, and ordered them to be immediately
punished. The soldiers, amazed at his intrepidity, with∣held their
complaints, and with down-cast eyes seemed to beg for mercy. You desired
a dis∣charge, cried he: go then, and publish to the world that you have
left your prince to the mercy of strangers; from henceforth, the Persians
shall be my guards. This menace served only to increase the misery and
the con∣sternation of his troops; they attended him with tears and
lamentations, till at last, softened by their penitence, he once more took
them into favour and affection.</P>
<P>Now secure from insurrection, he gave him∣self up to mirth and
feasting; his army was sol∣lowed by all the ministers of pleasure; he
spent whole nights and days in immoderate drinking, and in one of those
excesses, Hephestion lost <PB N="281" REF="285"/> his life. This
courtier was the most intimate friend of Alexander. Craterus alone, of all
the Macedonians seemed to dispute this honour with him. Craterus, as the
king used to say, loves the king, but Hephestion loves Alex∣ander. The
death of this favourite threw the monarch into excessive sorrow; he
seemed to receive no consolation; he even put to death the physician who
attended him, and the extra∣ordinary funeral honours celebrated at his ar∣rival
in Babylon, marked the greatness of his affliction.</P>
<P>After various combats, conquests, cruelties, follies, and
excesses, Alexander arrived at Ba∣bylon; the Chaldeans, who pretended to
fore∣see future events, attempted to persuade him not to enter that city.
The Greek philosophers on the other hand, displayed the futility of their
predictions. Babylon was a theatre for him to display his glory in; and
ambassadors from all the nations he had conquered were there in
rea∣diness to celebrate his triumphs. After mak∣ing a most magnificent
entry, he gave audience to the ambassadors, with a grandeur and dig∣nity
suitable to his power, yet with the affabi∣lity and politeness of a private
courtier.</P>
<P>At that time he wrote a letter, which was to have been read
publickly in the assembly at <PB N="282" REF="286"/> the Olympic-games,
whereby the several cities of Greece were commanded to permit all ex∣iles to
return into their native country, those excepted, who had committed
sacrilege, or any other crime deserving death; ordering An∣tipater to
employ an armed force against such cities as should refuse to obey.
This letter was read in the assembly. But the Athenians and Etolians did
not think themselves obliged to put orders in execution which seemed to
inter∣fere with their liberty.</P>
<P>Finding Babylon, in extent and conveniency, superior to all the
other cities of the East, he resolved to make it the seat of his empire;
and for that purpose was desirous of adding to it all the ornaments
possible. But though he was much employed in projects of this kind, and in
schemes even beyond human power to ex∣ecute, he spent the greatest part
of his time in such pleasures as this magnificent city afforded. He was
often present at new banquets, where he drank with his usual intemperance.
On a particular occasion, having spent the whole night in a debauch, a
second was proposed: he accepted the invitation, and drank to such
excess, that, he fell upon the floor, dead to appearance; and in this
lifeless man∣ner was carried, a sad spectacle of debauchery, 
<PB N="283" REF="287"/> to his palace. The fever continued, with some
intervals, in which he gave the necessary orders for the sailing of the
fleet, and the marching of his land forces, being persuaded he should
soon recover. But at last finding himself past all hopes, and his voice
beginning to fail, he gave his ring to Perdiccas, with orders to convey his
corpse to the temple of Ammon. He struggled however with death for some
time, and raising himself upon his elbow, he gave his hand to the
soldiers, who pressed to kiss it; being then asked to whom he would
leave his empire, he answer∣ed, To the most worthy. Perdiccas enquiring at
what time he should pay him divine honours, he replied, When you are happy.
With these words he expired, being thirty-two years and eight months old, of
which he had reigned twelve, with more fortune than virtue.</P>
<P>In whatever light we view this monarch, we shall have little to
admire, and less to imitate. That courage for which he was celebrated, is but
a subordinate virtue; that fortune which still attended him, was but an
accidental ad∣vantage; that discipline which prevailed in his army, was
produced and cultivated by his father; but his intemperance, his cruelty, his
vanity, his passion for useless conquests, were all his own. His
victories however, served to <PB N="284" REF="288"/> crown the pyramid of
Grecian glory; they served to shew, to what a degree the arts of peace can
promote those of war. In this pic∣ture, we view a combination of petty
states by the arts of refinement, growing more than a match for the rest of
the world united; and leaving mankind an example of superiority of intellect
over brutal force. After the death of this monarch, Greece was rather
considered as a seminary for the education and promotion of the laws of
other nations, than a confederacy for enforcing and promulgating her own. The
successors of Alexander seized upon particular parts of his extensive
empire; and what he gained with much fatigue and danger, became a prey to men
who sheltered their ambition under the sanction and glory of his name. They
had been taught by him a lesson of pride; and as he would never suffer an
equal, his numerous successors could not think of admitting a superior.
They continued their disputes for dominion until in some measure they
destroyed each other; and as no governments were ever worse conducted than
their's, so no period of history was ever left in such darkness, doubt,
and confusion.</P>
