<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The Nymphs who preside over springs and rivulets are ad∣dressed at day-break in honour of their several functions, and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world. Their origin is deduced from the first allegorical deities, or powers of nature; according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets, concerning the gene∣ration of the Gods and the rise of things. They are then successively considered, as giving motion to the air and ex∣citing summer-breezes; as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable world; as contributing to the fulness of na∣vigable rivers, and consequently to the maintenance of commerce; and by that means, to the maritime part of mi∣litary power. Next is represented their favourable in∣fluence upon health, when assisted by rural exercise: which introduces their connection with the art of physic, and the happy effects of mineral, medicinal springs. Lastly, they are celebrated for the friendship which the Muses bear them, and for the trae inspiration which temperance only can receive; in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more licentious poets.</P>

<LG>
<L>O'ER yonder eastern hill the twilight throws</L>
<L>Her dusky mantle; and the God of day,</L>
<L>With bright Astraea seated by his side,</L>
<L>Waits yet to leave the ocean. Tarry, Nymphs.</L>
<L>Ye Nymphs, ye blue-ey'd progeny of Thames,</L>
<L>Who now the mazes of this rugged heath</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>race with your fleeting steps; who all night long</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epeat, amid the cool and tranquil air,</L>

<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eave the gates of sleep; nor shall my lyre</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Too far into the splendid hours of morn</L>
<L>Ingage your audience: my observant hand</L>
<L>Shall close the strain ere any sultry beam</L>
<L>Approach you. To your subterranean haunts</L>
<L>Ye then may timely steal; to pace with care</L>
<L>The humid sands; to loosen from the soil</L>
<L>The bubbling sources; to direct the rills</L>
<L>To meet in wider channels; or beneath</L>
<L>Some grotto's dripping arch, at height of noon</L>
<L>To slumber, shelter'd from the burning heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where shall my song begin, ye Nymphs? or end?</L>
<L>Wide is your praise and copious—First of things,</L>
<L>First of the lonely powers, ere Time arose,</L>
<L>Were Love and Chaos: Love, the sire of Fate;</L>
<L>Elder than Chaos. Born of Fate was Time,</L>
<L>Who many sons and many comely births</L>
<L>Devour'd, relentless father: till the child</L>
<L>Of Rhea drove him from the upper sky,</L>
<L>And quell'd his deadly might. Then social reign'd</L>
<L>The kindred powers, Tethys, and reverend Ops,</L>
<L>And spotless Vesta; while supreme of sway</L>
<L>Remain'd the cloud-compeller. From the couch</L>
<L>Of Tethys sprang the sedgy-crowned race,</L>
<L>Who from a thousand urns, o'er every clime,</L>
<L>Send tribute to their parent; and from them</L>
<L>Are ye, O Naiads: Arethusa fair,</L>
<L>And tuneful Aganippe; that sweet name,</L>
<L>Bandusia; that soft family which dwelt</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
With Syrian Daphne; and the honour'd tribes</L>
<L>Belov'd of Paeon. Listen to my strain,</L>
<L>Daughters of Tethys: listen to your praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You, Nymphs, the winged offspring, which of old</L>
<L>Aurora to divine Astraeus bore,</L>
<L>Owns; and your aid beseecheth. When the might</L>
<L>Of Hyperion, from his noontide throne,</L>
<L>Unbends their languid pinions, aid from you</L>
<L>They ask: Favonius and the mild South-west</L>
<L>From you relief implore. Your sallying streams</L>
<L>Fresh vigour to their weary wings impart.</L>
<L>Again they fly, disporting; from the mead</L>
<L>Half-ripen'd and the tender blades of corn,</L>
<L>To sweep the noxious mildew; or dispel</L>
<L>Contagious steams, which oft the parched earth</L>
<L>Breathes on her fainting sons. From noon to eve,</L>
<L>Along the river and the paved brook,</L>
<L>Ascend the chearful breezes; hail'd of bards</L>
<L>Who, fast by learned Cam, the Mantuan lyre</L>
<L>Sollicit; nor unwelcome to the youth</L>
<L>Who on the heights of Tibur, all inclin'd</L>
<L>O'er rushing Anio, with a pious hand</L>
<L>The reverend scene delineates, broken fanes,</L>
<L>Or tombs, or pillar'd aqueducts, the pomp</L>
<L>Of ancient time; and haply, while he scans</L>
<L>The ruins, with a silent tear revolves</L>
<L>The fame and fortune of imperious Rome.</L>
<L>You too, O Nymphs, and your unenvious aid</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
The rural powers confess; and still prepare</L>
<L>For you their grateful treasures. Pan commands,</L>
<L>Oft as the Delian king with Sirius holds</L>
<L>The central heavens, the father of the grove</L>
<L>Commands his Dryads over your abodes</L>
<L>To spread their deepest umbrage. well the God</L>
<L>Remembereth how indulgent ye supplied</L>
<L>Your genial dews to nurse them in their prime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pales, the pasture's queen, where'er ye stray,</L>
<L>Pursues your steps, delighted; and the path</L>
<L>With living verdure clothes. Around your haunts</L>
<L>The laughing Chloris, with profusest hand,</L>
<L>Throws wide her blooms, her odours. Still with you</L>
<L>Pomona seeks to dwell: and o'er the lawns,</L>
<L>And o'er the vale of Richmond, where with Thames</L>
<L>Ye love to wander, Amalthea pours</L>
<L>Well-pleas'd the wealth of that Ammonian horn,</L>
<L>Her dower; unmindful of the fragrant isles</L>
<L>Nysaean or Atlantic. Nor can'st thou,</L>
<L>(Albeit oft, ungrateful, thou dost mock</L>
<L>The beverage of the sober Naiad's urn,</L>
<L>O Bromius, O Lenaean) nor can'st thou</L>
<L>Disown the powers whose bounty, ill repaid,</L>
<L>With nectar feeds thy tendrils. Yet from me,</L>
<L>Yet, blameless Nymphs, from my delighted lyre,</L>
<L>Accept the rites your bounty well may claim;</L>
<L>Nor heed the scoffings of the Edonian band.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For better praise awaits you. Thames, your sire,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
As down the verdant slope your duteous rills</L>
<L>Descend, the tribute stately Thames receives,</L>
<L>Delighted; and your piety applauds;</L>
<L>And bids his copious tide roll on secure,</L>
<L>For faithful are his daughters; and with words</L>
<L>Auspicious gratulates the bark which, now</L>
<L>His banks forsaking, her adventurous wings</L>
<L>Yields to the breeze, with Albion's happy gifts</L>
<L>Extremest isles to bless. and oft at morn,</L>
<L>When Hermes, from Olympus bent o'er earth</L>
<L>To bear the words of Jove, on yonder hill</L>
<L>Stoops lightly-sailing; oft intent your springs</L>
<L>He views: and waving o'er some new-born stream</L>
<L>His blest pacific wand, "And yet," he cries,</L>
<L>"Yet," cries the son of Maia, "though recluse</L>
<L>"And silent be your stores, from you, fair Nymphs,</L>

"Which wise Phoenicia from their native clime</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such are the words of Hermes: such the praise,</L>
<L>O Naiads, which from tongues coelestial waits</L>
<L>Your bounteous deeds. From bounty issueth power:</L>
<L>And those who, sedulous in prudent works,</L>
<L>Relieve the wants of nature, Jove repays</L>
<L>With generous wealth and his own seat on earth,</L>
<L>Fit judgments to pronounce, and curb the might</L>
<L>Of wicked men. Your kind unfailing urns</L>
<L>Not vainly to the hospitable arts</L>
<L>Of Hermes yield their store. For, O ye Nymphs,</L>
<L>Hath he not won the unconquerable queen</L>
<L>Of arms to court your friendship? You she owns</L>
<L>The fair associates who extend her sway</L>
<L>Wide o'er the mighty deep; and grateful things</L>
<L>Of you she uttereth, oft as from the shore</L>
<L>Of Thames, or Medway's vale, or the green banks</L>
<L>Of Vecta, she her thundering navy leads</L>
<L>To Calpe's foaming channel, or the rough</L>
<L>Cantabrian coast; her auspices divine</L>
<L>Imparting to the senate and the prince</L>
<L>Of Albion, to dismay barbaric kings,</L>
<L>The Iberian, or the Celt. The pride of kings</L>
<L>Was ever scorn'd by Pallas: and of old</L>
<L>Rejoic'd the virgin, from the brazen prow</L>
<L>Of Athens o'er Aegina's gloomy surge,</L>
<L>To drive her clouds and stroms; o'erwhelming all</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
The Persian's promis'd glory, when the realms</L>
<L>Of Indus and the soft Ionian clime,</L>
<L>When Lybia's torrid champain and the rocks</L>
<L>Of cold Imaüs join'd their servile bands,</L>
<L>To sweep the sons of liberty from earth.</L>
<L>In vain: Minerva on the brazen prow</L>
<L>Of Athens stood, and with the thunder's voice</L>
<L>Denounc'd her terrours on their impious heads,</L>
<L>And shook her burning Aegis. Xerxes saw:</L>
<L>From Heracleum, on the mountain's height</L>
<L>Thron'd in his golden car, he knew the sign</L>
<L>Coelestial; felt unrighteous hope forsake</L>
<L>His faltering heart, and turn'd his face with shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, ye who share the stern Minerva's power;</L>
<L>Who arm the hand of liberty for war;</L>
<L>And give, in secret, the Britannic name</L>
<L>To awe contending monarchs: yet benign,</L>
<L>Yet mild of nature; to the works of peace</L>
<L>More prone, and lenient of the many ills</L>
<L>Which wait on human life. Your gentle aid</L>
<L>Hygeia well can witness; she who saves,</L>
<L>From poisonous cates and cups of pleasing bane,</L>
<L>The wretch devoted to the entangling snares</L>
<L>Of Bacchus and of Comus. Him she leads</L>
<L>To Cynthia's lonely haunts. To spread the toils,</L>
<L>To beat the coverts, with the jovial horn</L>
<L>At dawn of day to summon the loud hounds,</L>
<L>She calls the lingering sluggard from his dreams:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
And where his breast may drink the mountain-breeze,</L>
<L>And where the fervour of the sunny vale</L>
<L>May beat upon his brow, through devious paths</L>
<L>Beckons his rapid courser. Nor when ease,</L>
<L>Cool ease and welcome slumbers have becalm'd</L>
<L>His eager bosom, does the queen of health</L>
<L>Her pleasing care withold. His decent board</L>

<L>When herbs, and potent trees, and drops of balm</L>

<L>To brace the nerveless arm, with food to win</L>

<L>Your trickling rills insinuate. There the God</L>
<L>From your indulgent hands the steaming bowl</L>
<L>Wafts to his pale-ey'd suppliants; wafts the seeds</L>
<L>Merallic and the elemental salts</L>

<L><PB N="61" REF="63"/>
Man, only Man sollicitous to know</L>
<L>The springs whence Nature's operations flow,</L>
<L>Plods thro' a dreary waste with toil and pain,</L>
<L>And reasons, hopes, and thinks, and lives in vain;</L>
<L>For sable Death still hov'ring o'er his head,</L>
<L>Cuts short his progress, with his vital thread,</L>
<L>Wherefore, since Nature errs not, do we find</L>
<L>These seeds of Science in the human mind,</L>
<L>If no congenial fruits are predesign'd?</L>
<L>For what avails to Man this pow'r to roam</L>
<L>Thro' ages past, and ages yet to come,</L>
<L>T' explore new worlds o'er all th' aetherial way,</L>
<L>Chain'd to a spot, and living but a day?</L>

<L>Were it not wiser far, supinely laid,</L>
<L>To sport with Phyllis in the noontide shade?</L>
<L>Or at thy jovial festivals appear,</L>
<L>Great Bacchus, who alone the soul can clear</L>
<L>From all that it has felt, and all that it can fear?</L>

<L>Come on then, let us feast: let Chloe sing,</L>
<L>And soft Neaera touch the trembling string;</L>
<L>Enjoy the present hour, nor seek to know</L>
<L>What good or ill to-morrow may bestow.</L>
<L>But these delights soon pall upon the taste;</L>
<L>Let's try then if more serious cannot last:</L>
<L>Wealth let us heap on wealth, or fame pursue,</L>
<L>Let pow'r and glory be our points in view;</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="64"/>
In courts, in camps, in senates let us live,</L>
<L>Our levees crowded like the buzzing hive:</L>
<L>Each weak attempt the same sad lesson brings,</L>
<L>Alas, what vanity in human things!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What means then shall we try? where hope to find</L>
<L>A friendly harbour for the restless mind?</L>
<L>Who still, you see, impatient to obtain</L>
<L>Knowledge immense, (so Nature's laws ordain)</L>
<L>Ev'n now, tho' fetter'd in corporeal clay,</L>
<L>Climbs step by step the prospect to survey,</L>
<L>And seeks, unweary'd, Truth's eternal ray.</L>
<L>No fleeting joys she asks, which must depend</L>
<L>On the frail senses, and with them must end;</L>

<L>Take courage then, these joys we shall attain;</L>
<L>Almighty Wisdom never acts in vain;</L>

<L>And draw nectareous streams from truth's perpetual urn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whilst life remains, (if life it can be call'd</L>
<L>T' exist in fleshly bondage thus enthrall'd)</L>
<L>Tir'd with the dull pursuit of worldly things,</L>
<L>The soul scarce wakes, or opes her gladsome wings,</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="65"/>
Yet still the godlike exile in disgrace</L>
<L>Retains some marks of her celestial race;</L>
<L>Else whence from Mem'ry's store can she produce</L>
<L>Such various thoughts, or range them so for use?</L>
<L>Can matter these contain, dispose, apply?</L>
<L>Can in her cells such mighty treasures lye?</L>
<L>Or can her native force produce them to the eye?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whence is this pow'r, this foundress of all arts,</L>
<L>Serving, adorning life, thro' all its parts,</L>
<L>Which names impos'd, by letters mark'd those names,</L>

<L>Which, whether he attempts to warm the heart</L>
<L>With fabled scenes, or charm the ear with rhyme,</L>
<L>Breathes all pathetic, lovely, and sublime?</L>
<L>Whilst things on earth roll round from age to age,</L>
<L>The same dull force repeated; on the stage</L>
<L>The poet gives us a creation new,</L>
<L>More pleasing, and more perfect than the true;</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="66"/>
The mind, who always to perfection hastes,</L>
<L>Perfection, such as here she never tastes,</L>
<L>With gratitude accepts the kind deceit,</L>

<L>Of those what think you, who the circling race</L>
<L>Of suns, and their revolving planets trace,</L>

<L>Say, can you doubt, but that th' all-searching soul,</L>
<L>That now can traverse heav'n from pole to pole,</L>
<L>From thence descending visits but this earth,</L>

<L>Cou'd she thus act, unless some Power unknown,</L>

<L>Supported, and impell'd her? She approves</L>
<L>Self-conscious, and condemns; she hates, and loves,</L>
<L>Mourns, and rejoices, hopes, and is afraid,</L>
<L>Without the body's unrequested aid:</L>
<L>Her own internal strength her reason guides,</L>
<L>By this she now compares things, now divides;</L>
<L>Truth's scatter'd fragments piece by piece collects,</L>
<L>Rejoins, and thence her edifice erects;</L>
<L>Piles arts on arts, effects to causes ties,</L>
<L>And rears th' aspiring fabric to the skies:</L>
<L>From whence, as on a distant plain below,</L>
<L>She sees from causes consequences flow,</L>
<L>And the whole chain distinctly comprehends,</L>
<L>Which from th' Almighty's throne to earth descends:</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="67"/>
And lastly, turning inwardly her eyes,</L>
<L>Perceives how all her own ideas rise,</L>
<L>Contemplates what she is, and whence she came,</L>
<L>And almost comprehends her own amazing frame.</L>
<L>Can mere machines be with such pow'rs endued,</L>
<L>Or conscious of those pow'rs, suppose they cou'd?</L>
<L>For body is but a machine alone</L>
<L>Mov'd by external force, and impulse not its own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rate not th' extension of the human mind</L>
<L>By the plebeian standard of mankind,</L>

<L>Parent of heroes too in better days.</L>
<L>Why shou'd I try her num'rous sons to name</L>

<L>That there's a self which after death shall live,</L>

<L>That something's ours, when we from life depart</L>

<L>This truth, the public voice declares the same;</L>
<L>No land so rude but looks beyond the tomb</L>

<L>Hence, without hopes to be in life repaid,</L>
<L>We plant slow oaks posterity to shade;</L>
<L>And hence vast pyramids aspiring high</L>
<L>Lift their proud heads alost, and time defy.</L>
<L>Hence is our love of same, a love so strong,</L>
<L>We think no dangers great, or labors long,</L>
<L>By which we hope our beings to extend,</L>
<L>And to remotest times in glory to descend.</L>

<L>For fame the wretch beneath the gallows lies</L>
<L>Disowning every crime for which he dies;</L>

<L>Nature has wove into the human mind</L>
<L>This anxious care for names we leave behind,</L>
<L>T' extend our narrow views beyond the tomb,</L>
<L>And give an earnest of a life to come:</L>
<L>For, if when dead, we are but dust or clay,</L>

<L>Gums, spice, and melted pitch they pour within;</L>

<L>Where <HI>Indian Ganges</HI> rolls his sandy streams,</L>
<L>Of life impatient rush into the fire,</L>

<L>Persuaded the loose soul to regions flies,</L>
<L>Blest with eternal spring, and cloudless skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor is less fam'd the oriental wife</L>
<L>For stedfast virtue, and contempt of life:</L>
<L>These heroines mourn not with loud female cries</L>
<L>Their husbands lost, or with o'erflowing eyes,</L>
<L>But, strange to tell! their funeral piles ascend,</L>

<L><PB N="69" REF="71"/>
Whence this disdain of life in ev'ry breast,</L>
<L>But from a notion on their minds imprest,</L>
<L>That all, who for their country die, are blest.</L>
<L>Add too to these the once prevailing dreams,</L>
<L>Of sweet <HI>Elysian</HI> groves, and <HI>Stygian</HI> streams:</L>

<L>For ev'ry fiction, which can long persuade,</L>
<L>In truth must have its first foundations laid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Because we are unable to conceive,</L>
<L>How unembody'd souls can act, and live,</L>
<L>The vulgar give them forms, and limbs, and faces,</L>
<L>And habitations in peculiar places;</L>

<L>Their whole existence fabulous suspect,</L>

<L>Too indolent to learn what may be known,</L>
<L>Or else too proud that ignorance to own.</L>
<L>For hard's the task the daubing to pervade</L>
<L>Folly and fraud on Truth's fair form have laid;</L>
<L>Yet let that task be ours; for great the prize;</L>

That there's a God from Nature's voice is clear,</L>
<L>And yet what errors to this truth adhere?</L>
<L>How have the fears and follies of mankind</L>
<L>Now multiply'd their gods, and now subjoin'd</L>
<L>To each the frailties of the human mind?</L>
<L>Nay superstition spread at length so wide,</L>
<L>Beasts, birds, and onions too were deify'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' <HI>Athenian</HI> sage revolving in his mind</L>
<L>This weakness, blindness, madness of mankind,</L>
<L>Foretold, that in maturer days, tho' late,</L>
<L>When Time should ripen the decrees of Fate,</L>
<L>Some God would light us, like the rising day,</L>
<L>Thro' error's maze, and chase these clouds away.</L>
<L>Long since has Time fulfill'd this great decree,</L>
<L>And brought us aid from this divinity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well worth our search discoveries may be made</L>
<L>By Nature, void of the caelestial aid:</L>
<L>Let's try what her conjectures then can reach,</L>
<L>Nor scorn plain Reason, when she deigns to teach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That mind and body often sympathize</L>
<L>Is plain; such is this union Nature ties:</L>
<L>But then as often too they disagree,</L>
<L>Which proves the soul's superior progeny.</L>
<L>Sometimes the body in full strength we find,</L>
<L>Whilst various ails debilitate the mind;</L>
<L>At others, whilst the mind its force retains,</L>
<L>The body sinks with sickness and with pains:</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="73"/>
Now did one common fate their beings end,</L>
<L>Alike they'd sicken, and alike they'd mend.</L>
<L>But sure experience, on the slightest view,</L>
<L>Shews us, that the reverse of this is true;</L>
<L>For when the body oft expiring lies,</L>
<L>Its limbs quite senseless, and half clos'd its eyes,</L>
<L>The mind new force, and eloquence acquires,</L>
<L>And with prophetic voice the dying lips inspires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of like materials were they both compos'd,</L>
<L>How comes it, that the mind, when sleep has clos'd</L>
<L>Each avenue of sense, expatiates wide</L>
<L>Her liberty restor'd, her bonds unty'd?</L>
<L>And like some bird who from its prison flies,</L>
<L>Claps her exulting wings, and mounts the skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Grant that corporeal is the human mind,</L>
<L>In must have parts <HI>in infinitum</HI> join'd;</L>
<L>And each of these must will, perceive, design,</L>
<L>And draw confus'dly in a diff'rent line;</L>
<L>Which then can claim dominion o'er the rest,</L>
<L>Or stamp the ruling passion in the breast?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps the mind is form'd by various arts</L>
<L>Of modelling, and figuring these parts;</L>
<L>Just as if circles wiser were than squares;</L>

<L>Allow that motion is the cause of thought,</L>
<L>With what strange pow'rs must motion then be fraught?</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="74"/>
Reason, sense, science, must derive their source</L>
<L>From the wheel's rapid whirl, or pully's force;</L>
<L>Tops whip'd by school-boys sages must commence,</L>
<L>Their hoops, like them, be cudgell'd into sense,</L>

<L>Whence can this very motion take its birth?</L>
<L>Not sure from matter, from dull clods of earth;</L>

<L>Which governs all the bodily machine:</L>
<L>Just as th' Almighty Universal Soul</L>
<L>Informs, directs, and animals the whole.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cease then to wonder how th' immortal mind</L>
<L>Can live, when from the body quite disjoin'd;</L>
<L>But rather wonder, if she e'er cou'd die,</L>
<L>So fram'd, so fashion'd for eternity;</L>
<L>Self-mov'd, not form'd of parts together ty'd,</L>
<L>Which time can dissipate, and force divide;</L>

<L>His Being not the least relation bears,</L>
<L>As far as to the human mind appears,</L>
<L>To shape, or size, similitude or place,</L>
<L>Cloath'd in no form, and bounded by no space.</L>
<L>Such then is God, a Spirit pure refin'd</L>
<L>From all material dross, and such the human mind.</L>

<L>New organs, since ev'n art can these retrieve?</L>
<L>The silver trumpet aids th' obstructed ear,</L>

Shou'd he at length, so truly good and great,</L>

The golden ages wou'd again begin,</L>
<L>But 'tis our lot in this to suffer, and to sin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Observing this, some sages have decreed</L>
<L>That all things from two causes must proceed;</L>
<L>Two principles with equal pow'r endu'd,</L>
<L>This wholly evil, that supremely good.</L>
<L>From this arise the miseries we endure,</L>

<L>Hence tares with golden crops promiscuous grow,</L>
<L>And poisonous serpents make their dread repose</L>
<L>Beneath the covert of the fragrant rose.</L>

<LG>
<L>Can such a system satisfy the mind?</L>
<L>Are both these Gods in equal pow'r conjoin'd,</L>
<L>Or one superior? Equal if you say,</L>
<L>Chaos returns, since neither will obey;</L>
<L>Is one superior? good, or ill must reign,</L>

<L>He holds, that whatsoever yields delight,</L>
<L>Wealth, fame, externals all, are useless things;</L>
<L>Himself half starving happier far than kings.</L>
<L>'Tis fine indeed to be so wond'rous wise!</L>
<L>By the same reas'ning too he pain denies;</L>

Roast him, or flea him, break him on the wheel,</L>
<L>Retract he will not, tho' he can't but feel:</L>

<L>What? vigour, health, and beauty? are these good?</L>

If so, however things affect our sight,</L>
<L>As sings our bard, <HI>whatever is, is right.</HI></L>
<L>But is it right, what here so oft appears,</L>
<L>That vice shou'd triumph, virtue sink in tears?</L>
<L>The inference then, that closes this debate,</L>
<L>Is, that there must exist a future state.</L>
<L>The wise extending their enquiries wide</L>
<L>See how both states are by connection ty'd;</L>
<L>Fools view but part, and not the whole survey,</L>

<L>Hence are they led to hope, but hope in vain,</L>
<L>That Justice never will resume her reign;</L>
<L>On this vain hope adulterers, thieves rely,</L>
<L>And to this altar vile assassins fly.</L>
<L>"But rules not God by general laws divine?</L>
<L>"Man's vice, or virtues change not the design:"</L>

<L>So good, so blest th' illustrious <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bishop of Worcester.</NOTE> <HI>Hough</HI> we find,</L>

<L>The Mitre's glory, Freedom's constant friend,</L>

<L>Or like some victor in th' Olympic games,</L>
<L>Who, having run his course, the crown of Glory claims.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From this just contrast plainly it appears,</L>
<L>How Conscience can inspire both hopes and fears;</L>
<L>But whence proceed these hopes, or whence this dread,</L>
<L>If nothing really can affect the dead?</L>

<L>The sure arrival of a future age!</L>
<L>Whate'er their lot is here, the good and wise,</L>

<L>An honest man, when Fortune's storms begin,</L>
<L>Has Consolation always sure within,</L>
<L>And, if she sends a more propitious gale,</L>
<L>He's pleas'd, but not forgetful it may fail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor fear that he, who sits so loose to life,</L>
<L>Shou'd too much shun its labors, and its strife;</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="90"/>
And scorning wealth, contented to be mean,</L>
<L>Shrink from the duties of this bustling scene;</L>
<L>Or, when his country's safety claims his aid,</L>
<L>Avoid the fight inglorious, and afraid:</L>
<L>Who scorns life most must surely be most brave,</L>
<L>And he, who pow'r contemns, be least a slave:</L>
<L>Virtue will lead him to Ambition's ends,</L>
<L>And prompt him to defend his country, and his friends,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But still his merit you can not regard,</L>
<L>Who thus pursues a posthumous reward;</L>
<L>His soul, you cry, is uncorrupt and great,</L>
<L>Who quite uninfluenc'd by a future state,</L>
<L>Embraces Virtue from a nobler sense</L>
<L>Of her abstracted, native excellence,</L>
<L>From the self-conscious joy her essence brings,</L>
<L>The beauty, fitness, harmony of things.</L>
<L>It may be so: yet he deserves applause,</L>
<L>Who follows where instructive Nature draws;</L>
<L>Aims at rewards by her indulgence giv'n,</L>
<L>And soars triumphant on her wings to heav'n.</L>

<L>No mean rewards, no mercenary views;</L>
<L>Not wealth usurious, or a num'rous train,</L>
<L>Not fame by fraud acquir'd, or title vain!</L>
<L>He follows but where Nature points the road,</L>
<L>Rising in Virtue's school, till he ascends to God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But we th' inglorious common herd of man,</L>
<L>Sail without compass, toil without a plan;</L>
<L><PB N="89" REF="91"/>
In Fortune's varying storms for ever tost,</L>
<L>Shadows pursue, that in pursuit are lost;</L>
<L>Mere infants all, till life's extremest day,</L>
<L>Scrambling for toys, then tossing them away.</L>
<L>Who rests of Immortality assur'd</L>
<L>Is safe, whatever ills are here endur'd:</L>
<L>He hopes not vainly in a world like this,</L>
<L>To meet with pure uninterrupted bliss;</L>
<L>For good and ill, in this imperfect state,</L>
<L>Are ever mix'd by the decrees of Fate.</L>
<L>With Wisdom's richest harvest Folly grows,</L>
<L>And baleful hemlock mingles with the rose;</L>
<L>All things are blended, changeable, and vain,</L>
<L>No hope, no wish we perfectly obtain;</L>
<L>God may perhaps (might human Reason's line</L>
<L>Pretend to fathom infinite design)</L>
<L>Have thus ordain'd things, that the restless mind</L>
<L>No happiness compleat on earth may find;</L>
<L>And, by this friendly chastisement made wise,</L>
<L>To heav'n her safest, best retreat may rise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come then, since now in safety we have past</L>
<L>Thro' Error's rocks, and see the port at last,</L>
<L>Let us review, and recollect the whole.—</L>
<L>Thus stands my argument.—The thinking soul</L>
<L>Cannot terrestrial, or material be,</L>
<L>But claims by Nature Immortality:</L>
<L>God, who created it, can make it end,</L>
<L>We question not, but cannot apprehend</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="92"/>
He will; because it is by him endued</L>
<L>With strong ideas of all-perfect Good:</L>
<L>With wond'rous pow'rs to know, and calculate</L>
<L>Things too remote from this our earthly state;</L>
<L>With sure presages of a life to come,</L>
<L>All false and useless; if beyond the tomb</L>
<L>Our beings cease: we therefore can't believe</L>
<L>God either acts in vain, or can deceive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If ev'ry rule of equity demands,</L>
<L>That Vice and Virtue from the Almighty's hands,</L>
<L>Shou'd due rewards, and punishments receive,</L>
<L>And this by no means happens whilst we live,</L>
<L>It follows, that a time must surely come,</L>
<L>When each shall meet their well-adjusted doom:</L>
<L>Then shall this scene, which now to human sight</L>
<L>Seems so unworthy Wisdom infinite,</L>
<L>A system of consummate skill appear,</L>
<L>And ev'ry cloud dispers'd, be beautiful and clear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Doubt we of this! what solid proof remains,</L>
<L>That o'er the world a wise Disposer reigns?</L>
<L>Whilst all Creation speaks a pow'r divine,</L>
<L>Is it deficient in the main design?</L>
<L>Not so: the day shall come, (pretend not now</L>
<L>Presumptuous to enquire or when, or how)</L>
<L>But after death shall come th' important day,</L>
<L>When God to all his justice shall display;</L>
<L>Each action with impartial eyes regard,</L>

<HEAD>The ARBOUR: An ODE to CONTENTMENT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. THOMAS COLE.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>TO these lone shades, where Peace delights to dwell,</L>
<L>May Fortune oft permit me to retreat;</L>
<L>Here bid the world, with all its cares, farewel,</L>
<L>And leave its pleasures to the rich and great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft as the summer's sun shall chear this scene,</L>
<L>With that mild gleam which points his parting ray,</L>
<L>Here let my soul enjoy each eve serene,</L>
<L>Here share its calm, 'till life's declining day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No gladsome image then should 'scape my sight,</L>
<L>From these gay flow'rs, which border near my eye,</L>
<L>To yon bright cloud, that decks, with richest light,</L>
<L>The gilded mantle of the western sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With ample gaze, I'd trace that ridge remote,</L>
<L>Where op'ning cliffs disclose the boundless main;</L>
<L>With earnest ken, from each low hamlet note</L>
<L>The steeple's summit peeping o'er the plain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What various works that rural landscape fill,</L>
<L>Where mingling hedge-rows beauteous fields inclose;</L>
<L>And prudent Culture, with industrious skill,</L>
<L>Her checker'd scene of crops and fallows shows?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
<L>How should I love to mark that riv'let's maze,</L>
<L>Through which it works its untaught course along;</L>
<L>Whilst near its grassy banks the herd shall graze,</L>
<L>And blithsome milkmaid chaunt her thoughtless song?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still would I note the shades of length'ning sheep,</L>
<L>As scatter'd o'er the hill's slant brow they rove;</L>
<L>Still note the day's last glimm'ring lustre creep</L>
<L>From off the verge of yonder upland grove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor should my leisure seldom wait to view</L>
<L>The slow-wing'd rooks in homeward train succeed;</L>
<L>Nor yet forbear the swallow to pursue,</L>
<L>With quicker glance, close skimming o'er the mead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But mostly here should I delight t' explore</L>
<L>The bounteous laws of Nature's mystic pow'r;</L>
<L>Then muse on him who blesseth all her store,</L>
<L>And give to solemn thoughts the sober hour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Mirth unenvy'd laugh with proud disdain,</L>
<L>And deem it spleen one moment thus to waste;</L>
<L>If so she keep far hence her noisy train,</L>
<L>Nor interrupt those joys she cannot taste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far sweeter streams shall flow from Wisdom's spring.</L>
<L>Than she receives from Folly's costliest bowl;</L>
<L>And what delights can her chief dainties bring,</L>
<L>Like those which feast the heavenly-pensive soul?</L>

<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
<L>Hail Silence then! be thou my frequent guest;</L>
<L>For thou art wont my gratitude to raise,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>What joy for tutor'd Piety to learn,</L>
<L>All that my christian solitude can teach,</L>
<L>Where weak-ey'd Reason's self may well discern</L>
<L>Each clearer truth the gospel deigns to preach?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No object here but may convince the mind,</L>
<L>Of more than thoughtful honesty shall need;</L>
<L>Nor can Suspense long question here to find</L>
<L>Sufficient evidence to fix its creed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis God that gives this bow'r its aweful gloom;</L>
<L>His arched verdure does its roof invest;</L>
<L>He breathes the life of fragrance on its bloom;</L>
<L>And with his kindness makes its owner blest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! may the guidance of thy grace attend</L>
<L>The use of all thy bounty shall bestow;</L>
<L>Lest folly should mistake its sacred end,</L>
<L>Or vice convert it into means of woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Incline and aid me still my life to steer,</L>
<L>As conscience dictates what to shun or chuse;</L>
<L>Nor let my heart feel anxious hope or fear,</L>
<L>For aught this world can give me or refuse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
<L>Then shall not wealth's parade one wish excite,</L>

<LG>
<L>What tho' thy wisdom may my lot deny,</L>
<L>The treasur'd plenty freely to dispense;</L>
<L>Yet well thy goodness can that want supply</L>
<L>With larger portions of benevolence.</L>

<L>And sure the heart that wills the gen'rous deed,</L>
<L>May all the joys of Charity command;</L>
<L>For she best loves from notice to recede,</L>
<L>And deals her unsought gifts with secret hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then will I sometimes bid my fancy steal,</L>
<L>That unclaim'd wealth no property restrains;</L>
<L>Soothe with fictitious aid my friendly zeal,</L>
<L>And realize each goodly act she feigns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So shall I gain the gold without alloy;</L>
<L>Without oppression, toil, or treach'rous snares;</L>
<L>So shall I know its use, its pow'r employ,</L>
<L>And yet avoid its dangers and its cares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And spite of all that boastful wealth can do,</L>
<L>In vain would Fortune strive the rich to bless,</L>
<L>Were they not flatter'd with some distant view</L>
<L>Of what she ne'er can give them to possess.</L>

<L>E'en Wisdom's high conceit great wants would feel,</L>

<L>That she, to satisfy, must promise more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But tho' experience will not fail to show,</L>
<L>Howe'er its truth man's weakness may upbraid,</L>
<L>That what he mostly values here below,</L>
<L>Owes half its relish to kind Fancy's aid;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet should not Prudence her light wing command,</L>
<L>She may too far extend her heedless flight;</L>
<L>For Pleasure soon shall quit her fairy-land</L>
<L>If Nature's regions are not held in sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From Truth's abode, in search of kind deceit,</L>
<L>Within due limits she may safely roam;</L>

<L>But thanks to those, whose fond parental care,</L>
<L>To Learning's paths my youthful steps confin'd,</L>
<L>I need not shun a state which lets me share</L>
<L>Each calm delight that soothes the studious mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While genius lasts, <HI>his</HI> fame shall ne'er decay,</L>

</LG>

<L>Books rightly us'd may ev'ry state secure:</L>
<L>From fortune's evils may our peace defend;</L>
<L>May teach us how to shun, or to endure,</L>

<L>Should rigid Want withdraw all outward aid,</L>

<HEAD>The DROPSICAL MAN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. W. TAYLOR.</BYLINE>
<L>A JOLLY, brave toper, who cou'd not forbear</L>
<L>Tho' his life was in danger, old port and stale beer,</L>
<L>Gave the doctors the hearing—but still wou'd drink on,</L>
<L>Till the dropsy had swell'd him as big as a tun.</L>
<L>The more he took physic the worse still he grew,</L>

<L>Tom, see by what courses I've shorten'd my life,</L>
<L>I'm leaving the world ere I'm forty and five;</L>
<L>More than probable 'tis, that in twenty-four hours,</L>
<L>This manor, this house, and estate will be yours;</L>
<L>My early excesses may teach you this truth,</L>
<L>That 'tis working for death to drink hard in one's youth.</L>
<L>Says Tom, (who's a lad of a generous spirit,</L>
<L>And not like young rakes who 're in haste to inherit.)</L>
<L>Sir, don't be dishearten'd; altho' it be true,</L>
<L>Th' operation is painful, and hazardous too,</L>
<L>'Tis no more than what many a man has gone thro'.</L>
<L>And then, as for years, you may yet be call'd young,</L>
<L>Your lise after this may be happy and long.</L>
<L>Don't flatter me, Tom, was the father's reply,</L>
<L>With a jest in his mouth and a tear in his eye;</L>
<L>Too well by experience, my vessels, thou know'st,</L>
<L>No sooner are tap'd, but they give up the ghost.</L>

<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<BYLINE>By the Honourable Mr. D—</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THO' strength of genius by experience taught</L>
<L>Gives thee to sound the depths of human thought,</L>
<L>To trace the various workings of the mind,</L>
<L>And rule the secret springs that rule mankind;</L>
<L>Rare gift! yet, Walpole, wilt thou condescend</L>
<L>To listen, if thy unexperienc'd friend</L>
<L>Can aught of use impart, tho' void of skill,</L>
<L>And raise attention by sincere good will:</L>
<L><PB N="130" REF="132"/>
For friendship sometimes want of parts supplies,</L>
<L>The heart may furnish what the head denies.</L>
<L>As, when the rapid Rhine o'er swelling tides</L>
<L>To grace old Ocean's coast in triumph rides,</L>
<L>Tho' rich in source, he drains a thousand springs,</L>
<L>Nor scorns the tribute each small riv'let brings:</L>
<L>So thou shalt hence absorb each feeling ray,</L>
<L>Each dawn of meaning in thy brighter day;</L>
<L>Shalt like, or where thou canst not like, excuse,</L>
<L>Since no mean interest shall prophane the Muse;</L>
<L>No malice wrapt in truth's disguise offend,</L>
<L>No flattery taint the freedom of a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When first a generous mind surveys the great,</L>
<L>And views the crowds that on their fortune wait,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the shew, (tho' little understood,)</L>
<L>He only seeks the power, to do the good:</L>
<L>Thinks, till he tries, 'tis godlike to dispose,</L>
<L>And gratitude still springs when bounty flows;</L>
<L>That ev'ry grant sincere affection wins,</L>
<L>And where our wants have end, our love begins.</L>
<L>But they who long the paths of state have trod,</L>
<L>Learn from the clamours of the murm'ring crowd,</L>
<L>Which cramm'd, yet craving, still their gates besiege,</L>
<L>'Tis easier far to give, than to oblige.</L>
<L>This of thy conduct seems the nicest part,</L>
<L>The chief perfection of the statesman's art,</L>
<L>To give to fair assent a fairer face,</L>
<L>Or soften a refusal into grace.</L>
<L><PB N="131" REF="133"/>
But few there are, that can be freely kind,</L>
<L>Or know to fix the favours on the mind;</L>
<L>Hence some whene'er they wou'd oblige, offend,</L>
<L>And while they make the fortune, lose the friend:</L>
<L>Still give unthank'd; still squander, not bestow,</L>
<L>For great men want not what to give, but how.</L>
<L>The race of men that follow courts, 'tis true,</L>
<L>Think all they get, and more than all, their due;</L>
<L>Still ask, but ne'er consult their own deserts,</L>
<L>And measure by their interest, not their parts.</L>
<L>From this mistake so many men we see</L>
<L>But ill become the thing they wish to be:</L>
<L>Hence discontent and fresh demands arise,</L>
<L>More power, more favour in the great man's eyes:</L>
<L>All feel a want, tho' none the cause suspects,</L>
<L>But hate their patron for their own defects.</L>
<L>Such none can please, but who reforms their hearts,</L>
<L>And when he gives them places, gives them parts.</L>
<L>As these o'erprize their worth, so sure the great</L>
<L>May sell their favours at too dear a rate.</L>
<L>When merit pines while clamour is prefer'd,</L>
<L>And long attachment waits among the herd;</L>
<L>When no distinction, where distinction's due,</L>
<L>Marks from the many the superior few;</L>
<L>When strong cabal constrains them to be just,</L>
<L>And makes them give at last, because they must,</L>
<L>What hopes that men of real worth shou'd prize</L>
<L>What neither friendship gives, nor merit buys.</L>
<L><PB N="132" REF="134"/>
The man who justly o'er the whole presides,</L>
<L>His well-weigh'd choice with wise affection guides:</L>
<L>Knows when to stop with grace, and when advance,</L>
<L>Nor gives from importunity, or chance;</L>
<L>But thinks how little gratitude is ow'd,</L>
<L>When favours are extorted, not bestow'd.</L>
<L>When safe on shore ourselves, we see the crowd</L>
<L>Surround the great, importunate and loud,</L>
<L>Thro' such a tumult 'tis no easy task,</L>
<L>To drive the man of real worth to ask;</L>
<L>Surrounded thus, and giddy with the shew</L>
<L>'Tis hard for great men rightly to bestow;</L>
<L>From hence so few are skill'd in either case,</L>
<L>To ask with dignity, or give with grace.</L>
<L>Sometimes the great, seduc'd by love of parts,</L>
<L>Consult our genius, but neglect our hearts;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the glittering sparks that genius flings,</L>
<L>They lift us tow'ring on the eagle's wings:</L>
<L>Mark out the flights by which themselves begun.</L>
<L>And teach our dazzled eyes to bear the sun,</L>
<L>'Till we forgot the hand that made us great,</L>
<L>And grow to envy, not to emulate.</L>
<L>To emulate a generous warmth implies,</L>
<L>To reach the virtues that make great men rise;</L>
<L>But envy wears a mean malignant face,</L>
<L>And aims not at their virtues but their place.</L>

<L>IN frolick's hour, ere serious thought had birth,</L>
<L>There was a time, my dear C—s, when</L>
<L>The Muse wou'd take me on her airy wing</L>
<L><PB N="137" REF="141"/>
And waft to views romantic; there present</L>
<L>Some motley vision, shade and sun: the cliff</L>
<L>O'erhanging, sparkling brooks, and ruins grey;</L>
<L>Bad me meanders trace, and catch the form</L>

<L>Sometimes Ambition, brushing by, wou'd twitch</L>
<L>My mantle, and with winning look sublime</L>
<L>Allure to follow. What tho' steep the track,</L>
<L>Her mountain's top wou'd overpay when climb'd</L>
<L>The scaler's toil; her temple there was fine,</L>
<L>And lovely thence the prospects. She cou'd tell</L>
<L>Where laurels grew, whence many a wreath antique;</L>
<L>But more advis'd to shun the barren twig,</L>
<L>(What is immortal verdure without fruit?)</L>
<L>And woo some thriving art: her num'rous mines</L>
<L>Were open to the searcher's skill and pains.</L>
</LG>

<L>Caught by th' harangue, heart beat, and flutt'ring pulse</L>
<L>Sounded irregular marches to be gone—</L>
<L>What, pause a moment when Ambition calls?</L>
<L>No, the blood gallops to the distant goal,</L>
<L>And throbs to reach it. Let the lame sit still.</L>
<L>When Fortune gentle, at the hill's verge extreme,</L>
<L>Array'd in decent garb, but somewhat thin,</L>
<L>Smiling approach'd, and what occasion ask'd,</L>

Unfit she said, for perilous atrempt,</L>

<L>Amid the gloomy scene of fir and yew,</L>

<L>I stirr'd up my sire, and close by its side</L>
<L>I set him down by me: with napkins I dried,</L>

<L>And I wrung with my hands the wet out of his hair.</L>

<L>He from wet and from cold was no sooner at ease,</L>
<L>But taking his bow up, he said, "if you please</L>

<L>WHILE you, my dear girls, in your paradise stray,</L>

<L>I am just wak'd from one,—wou'd to God it were true.</L>

<L>Methought I was now a fine gentleman grown,</L>
<L>And had got, Lord knows how, an estate of my own;</L>

<L>Some call'd me his worship, and others the squire.</L>

<L>There I built a fine house with great cost and great care,</L>
<L>(Your la'ships have form'd many such in the air)</L>
<L>Not of stucco, nor brick, but as good Portland stone,</L>
<L>As Kent wou'd desire to be working upon.</L>
<L>The apartments not small, nor monstrously great,</L>
<L>But chiefly for use, and a little for state;</L>
<L>So begilt, and becarv'd, and with ornaments grac'd,</L>
<L>That ev'ry one said, I'd an excellent taste.</L>
<L>Here I liv'd like a king, never hoarded my pelf,</L>

<L>A canal made for profit as well as for pleasure,</L>

<L>Both the eye to delight, and the table to crown,</L>
<L>With a jack, or a perch, when my uncles come down.</L>
<L>An exceeding great wood, that's been set a great while,</L>

<L>A sailor's toil, a trav'ler's woe;</L>
<L>Perhaps this very hour he strays</L>
<L>A lonely wretch thro' desart ways;</L>
<L>Or shipwreck'd on a foreign strand,</L>
<L>He falls beneath some ruffian's hand;</L>
<L>Or on the naked rock he lies,</L>
<L>And pinch'd by famine wastes and dies:</L>
<L>Can you this hated brother see</L>
<L>Floating, the sport of wind and sea?</L>
<L>Can you his feeble accents hear,</L>

<L>He faintly strives, his hopes are fled,</L>

<L>IN Russia's frozen clime some ages since</L>
<L>There dwelt, historians say, a worthy prince,</L>
<L>Who to his people's good consin'd his care,</L>
<L>And fix'd the basis of his empire there;</L>
<L>Inlarg'd their trade, the lib'ral arts improv'd,</L>
<L>Made nations happy, and himself belov'd;</L>
<L>To all the neighb'ring states a terror grown,</L>
<L>The dear delight, and glory of his own.</L>
<L>Not like those kings who vainly seek renown</L>
<L>From countries ruin'd, and from battles won;</L>
<L>Those mighty Nimrods, who mean laws despise,</L>
<L>Call murder but a princely exercise,</L>
<L>And if one bloodless sun shou'd steal away,</L>
<L>Cry out with Titus, they have lost a day;</L>
<L><PB N="179" REF="181"/>
Who, to be more than men, themselves debase</L>
<L>Beneath the brute, their Maker's form deface,</L>
<L>Raising their titles by their God's disgrace.</L>
<L>Like fame to bold Erostratus we give,</L>
<L>Who scorn'd by less than sacrilege to live;</L>
<L>On holy ruins rais'd a lasting name,</L>
<L>And in the temples's fire diffus'd his shame.</L>
<L>Far diff'rent praises, and a brighter fame,</L>
<L>The virtues of the young Porsenna claim;</L>
<L>For by that name the Russian king was known,</L>
<L>And sure a nobler ne'er adorn'd the throne.</L>
<L>In war he knew the deathful sword to wield,</L>
<L>And sought the thickest dangers of the field,</L>
<L>A bold commander, but, the storm o'erblown,</L>
<L>He seem'd as he were made for peace alone;</L>
<L>Then was the golden age again restor'd,</L>
<L>Nor less his justice honour'd than his sword.</L>
<L>All needless pomp, and outward grandeur spar'd,</L>
<L>The deeds that grac'd him were his only guard;</L>
<L>No private views beneath a borrow'd name;</L>
<L>His and the public interest were the same.</L>
<L>In wealth and pleasure let the subject live,</L>
<L>But virtue is the king's prerogative;</L>
<L>Porsenna there without a rival stood,</L>
<L>And wou'd maintain his right of doing good.</L>
<L>Nor did his person less attraction wear,</L>
<L>Such majesty and sweetness mingled there;</L>
<L><PB N="180" REF="182"/>
Heav'n with uncommon art the clay refin'd,</L>
<L>A proper mansion for so fair a mind;</L>
<L>Each look, each action bore peculiar grace,</L>
<L>And love itself was painted on his face.</L>
<L>In peaceful time he suffer'd not his mind</L>
<L>To rust in sloth, tho' much to peace inclin'd;</L>
<L>Nor wanton in the lap of pleasure lay,</L>
<L>And lost to glory loiter'd life away;</L>
<L>But active rising ere the prime of day,</L>
<L>Thro' woods and lonely desarts lov'd to stray;</L>
<L>With hounds and horns to wake the furious bear,</L>
<L>Or rouze the tawny lion from his laire;</L>
<L>To rid the forest of the savage brood,</L>
<L>And whet his courage for his country's good.</L>

<L>One day, as he pursued the dang'rous sport,</L>
<L>Attended by the nobles of his court,</L>
<L>It chanced a beast of more than common speed</L>
<L>Sprang from the brake, and thro' the desart fled.</L>
<L>The ardent prince impetuous as the wind</L>
<L>Rush'd on, and left his lagging train behind.</L>
<L>Fir'd with the chase, and full of youthful blood,</L>
<L>O'er plains, and vales, and woodland wilds he rode,</L>
<L>Urging his courser's speed, nor thought the day</L>
<L>How wasted, nor how intricate the way;</L>
<L>Nor, till the night in dusky clouds came on,</L>
<L>Restrain'd his pace, or found himself alone.</L>
<L>Missing his train, he strove to measure back</L>
<L>The road he came, but cou'd not find the track;</L>
<L><PB N="181" REF="183"/>
Still turning to the place he left before,</L>
<L>And only lab'ring to be lost the more.</L>
<L>The bugle horn, which o'er his shoulders hung,</L>
<L>So loud he winded, that the forest rung;</L>
<L>In vain, no voice but echo from the ground,</L>
<L>And vocal woods, made mock'ry of the sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the gath'ring clouds began to spread</L>
<L>O'er the dun face of night a deeper shade;</L>
<L>And the hoarse thunder growling from afar,</L>
<L>With herald voice proclaim'd th' approaching war;</L>
<L>Silence awhile ensued,—then by degrees</L>
<L>A hollow wind came mutt'ring thro' the trees.</L>
<L>Sudden the full fraught sky discharg'd its store,</L>
<L>Of rain and rattling hail a mingled show'r;</L>
<L>The active lightning ran along the ground;</L>
<L>The fiery bolts by fits were hurl'd around,</L>
<L>And the wide forests trembled at the sound.</L>
<L>Amazement seiz'd the prince;—where cou'd he fly?</L>
<L>No guide to lead, no friendly cottage nigh.</L>
<L>Pensive and unresolv'd awhile he stood,</L>
<L>Beneath the scanty covert of the wood;</L>
<L>But drove from thence soon sallied forth again,</L>
<L>As chance directed, on the dreary plain;</L>
<L>Constrain'd his melancholy way to take</L>
<L>Thro' many a loathsome bog, and thorny brake,</L>
<L>Caught in the thicket, floundring in the lake.</L>
<L>Wet with the storm, and wearied with the way,</L>
<L>By hunger pinch'd, himself to beasts a prey;</L>
<L><PB N="182" REF="184"/>
Nor wine to chear his heart, nor fire to burn,</L>
<L>Nor place to rest, nor prospect to return.</L>
<L>Drooping and spiritless, at life's despair</L>
<L>He bade it pass, not worth his farther care;</L>
<L>When suddenly he spied a distant light,</L>
<L>That faintly twinkled thro' the gloom of night,</L>
<L>And his heart leap'd for joy, and bless'd the welcome sight.</L>
<L>Oft-times he doubted, it appear'd so far,</L>
<L>And hung so high, 'twas nothing but a star,</L>
<L>Or kindled vapour wand'ring thro' the sky,</L>
<L>But still press'd on his steed, still kept it in his eye;</L>
<L>Till, much fatigue, aad many dangers past,</L>
<L>At a huge mountain he arriv'd at last.</L>
<L>There lighting from his horse, on hands and knees</L>
<L>Grop'd out the darksome road, by slow degrees,</L>
<L>Crawling or clamb'ring o'er the rugged way;</L>
<L>The thunder rowls above, the flames around him play,</L>
<L>Joyful at length he gain'd the steepy height,</L>
<L>And found the rift whence sprang the friendly light,</L>
<L>And here he stopp'd to rest his wearied feet,</L>
<L>And weigh the perils he had still to meet;</L>
<L>Unsheath'd his trusty sword, and dealt his eyes</L>
<L>With caution round him to prevent surprize,</L>
<L>Then summon'd all the forces of his mind,</L>

<L>Then, summoning his senses, ran to meet</L>

<LG>
<L>HARK, thro' the sacred silence of the night,</L>
<L>Loud Chanticleer doth sound his clarion shrill,</L>
<L>Hailing with song the first pale gleam of light,</L>
<L>That floats the dark brow of you eastern hill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bright star of morn, oh! leave not yet the wave,</L>
<L>To deck the dewy frontlet of the day,</L>
<L>Nor thou, Aurora, quit Tithonus' cave,</L>
<L>Nor drive retiring darkness yet away,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ere these my rustic hands a garland twine,</L>
<L>Ere yet my tongue indite a simple song,</L>
<L>For her I mean to hail my Valentine,</L>
<L>Sweet maiden, fairest of the virgin throng.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sweet is the morn, and sweet the gentle breeze</L>
<L>That fans the fragrant bosom of the spring,</L>
<L>Sweet chirps the lark. and sweeter far than these</L>
<L>The gentle love-song gurgling turtles sing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh let the flowers be fragrant as the morn,</L>
<L>And as the turtle's song my ditty sweet;</L>
<L>Those flowers my woven chaplet must adorn,</L>
<L>That ditty must my waking charmer greet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
<L>And thou, blest saint, whom choral creatures join</L>
<L>In one enlivening symphony to hail,</L>
<L>Oh be propitious, gentle Valentine,</L>
<L>And let each holy tender sigh prevail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh give me to approach my sleeping love,</L>
<L>And strew her pillow with the freshest flowers,</L>
<L>No sigh unhallow'd shall my bosom move,</L>
<L>Nor step prophane pollute my true-love's bowers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At sacred distance only will I gaze,</L>
<L>Nor bid my unreproved eye refrain,</L>
<L>Mean while my tongue shall chaunt her beauty's praise,</L>
<L>And hail her sleeping with the gentlest strain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Awake my fair, awake, for it is time;</L>
<L>Hark, thousand songsters rise from yonder grove,</L>
<L>And rising carol this sweet hour of prime,</L>
<L>Each to his mate, a roundelay of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All nature sings the hymeneal song,</L>
<L>All nature follows, where the spring invites;</L>
<L>Come forth my love, to us these joys belong,</L>
<L>Ours is the spring, and all her young delights.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For us she throws profusely forth her flowers,</L>
<L>Which in fresh chaplets joyful I will twine;</L>
<L>Come forth my fair, oh do not lose these hours,</L>
<L>But wake, and be my faithful Valentine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
<L>Full many an hour, all lonely have I sigh'd,</L>
<L>Nor dared the secret of my love reveal,</L>
<L>Full many a fond expedient have I tried</L>
<L>My warmest wish in silence to conceal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And oft to far retired solitude</L>
<L>All mournfully my slow step have I bent,</L>
<L>Luxurious there indulg'd my musing mood,</L>
<L>And there alone have given my sorrows vent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This day resolv'd I dare to plight my vow.</L>
<L>This day, long since the feast of love decreed,</L>
<L>Embolden'd will I speak my flame, nor thou</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet if I should behold my love awake,</L>
<L>Ah frail resolves, ah whither will ye fly?</L>
<L>Full well I know I shall not silence break,</L>
<L>But struck with awe almost for fear shall die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh no, I will not trust a fault'ring speech</L>
<L>In broken phrase an awkward tale to tell,</L>
<L>A tale, whose tenderness no tongue can reach,</L>
<L>Nor softest melody can utter well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But my meek eye, best herald to my heart,</L>
<L>I will compose to soft and downcast look,</L>
<L>And at one humble glance it shall impart</L>
<L>My love, nor fear the language be mistook.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
<L>For she shall read (apt scholar at this lore)</L>
<L>With what fond passion my true bosom glows,</L>
<L>How hopeless of return I still adore,</L>
<L>Nor dare the boldness of my wish disclose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should she then smile,—yet ah! she smiles on all,</L>
<L>Her gentle temper pities all distress;</L>
<L>On every hill, each vale, the sun-beams fall,</L>
<L>Each herb, and flow'r, each tree, and shrub they bless.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alike all nature grateful owns the boon,</L>
<L>The universal ray to all is free;</L>
<L>Like fond Endymion should I hope the moon,</L>
<L>Because among the rest she shines on me?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hope, vain presumer, keep, oh keep away:</L>
<L>Ev'n if my woe her gentle bosom move,</L>
<L>Pity some look of kindness may display;</L>
<L>But each soft glance is not a look of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet heav'nly visitant, thou dost not quit</L>
<L>Those bow'rs where angels sweet division sing,</L>
<L>Nor deignest thou on mortal shrine to sit</L>
<L>Alone, for round thee ever on the wing,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Glad choirs of loves attend, and hov'ring wait</L>
<L>Thy mild command; of these thy blooming train</L>
<L>Oh bid some sylph in morning dreams relate,</L>
<L>Ere yet my love awake, my secret pain.</L>

<L>WHERE aged elms in many a goodly row</L>

<L>O'er his lov'd ashes frequent flow'd sincere,</L>
<L>Each decent rite with due observance paid,</L>
<L>Each solemn requiem offer'd to his shade,</L>
<L>Plac'd 'mid the brave his urn in holy ground,</L>
<L>And bade his hallow'd banners wave around.</L>
<L>Then left the gaudy scenes of pomp and power,</L>
<L>While prudence beckon'd to that ancient bower,</L>
<L><PB N="223" REF="225"/>
And those paternal fields, the sole remains</L>
<L>Of ample woods and far-extended plains,</L>
<L>Which tyrant custom rudely tore away</L>
<L>To distant heirship an expected prey.</L>
<L>Serene she sought the far-retired grove,</L>
<L>Once the bless'd mansion of her happy love,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the thought, that memory oft would raise</L>
<L>A solemn prospect of those blooming days</L>
<L>Aurelius gave: her pious purpose now</L>

<L>In lonely luxury her sorrows feed,</L>
<L>And pass her life in widow's decent weed.</L>
<L>One pledge of love her comfort still remain'd,</L>
<L>Whom in this solitude she careful train'd</L>
<L>To virtuous lore; and while as year by year</L>
<L>New graces made Aurelia still more dear;</L>
<L>Full many an hour unheeded she would trace</L>
<L>The father's semblance in the daughter's face;</L>
<L>While tender sighs oft heav'd her faithful breast,</L>
<L>And sudden tears her lasting love exprest.</L>
<L>Thus long she dwelt in innate virtues great,</L>
<L>Amid the villagers in sacred state:</L>
<L>For ev'ry grace to which submission bows,</L>
<L>The pow'r which conscious dignity bestows,</L>
<L>She felt superior; for from ancient race</L>
<L>She gloried her long ancestry to trace;</L>
<L>And ever bade Aurelia's thought aspire</L>
<L>To ev'ry grace, each ray of sacred sire,</L>
<L><PB N="224" REF="226"/>
That full of heav'n-born dignity informs</L>
<L>The mortal breast which ardent virtue warms;</L>
<L>Then led her to the venerable hall</L>

<L>And arched windows with their blazon bright</L>
<L>Shed thro' the herald glow a solemn light:</L>
<L>There clad in rough habiliments of war</L>
<L>Full many a hero bore a glorious scar;</L>
<L>There in the civic fur, the sons of peace,</L>
<L>Whose counsels bade their country's tumults cease;</L>
<L>While by their side, gracing the ancient scene,</L>
<L>Hung gentle ladies of most comely mien.</L>
<L>Then eager thro' the well-known tale she run,</L>
<L>In what fair cause each honour had been won,</L>
<L>What female grace each virgin had possess'd</L>
<L>To charm to gentle love the manly breast;</L>
<L>Pleas'd to observe how long her gen'rous blood</L>
<L>Thro' fair and brave had pass'd a spotless flood.</L>
<L>Mean while the young Aurelia's bosom fir'd</L>
<L>With emulation, by each tale inspir'd,</L>
<L>In eager transport frequent breath'd her prayer</L>
<L>The graces of her ancestry to share:</L>
<L>Nor breath'd in vain, her fond maternal guide</L>
<L>Cherish'd with care each spark of virtuous pride;</L>
<L>And ever as she gave a lesson new,</L>
<L>Would point some old example to her view:</L>
<L>Inflam'd by this, her mind was quickly fraught</L>
<L>With each sage precept, that her mother taught.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
<L>The goodly dame thus bless'd in her employ</L>
<L>Felt each soft transport of parental joy,</L>

<L>Resign'd she waited now the aweful hour</L>
<L>When death should raise her to that heav'nly bow'r,</L>
<L>Where with her lov'd Aurelius she might share</L>
<L>The pleasing task, to watch with guardian care</L>
<L>Their offspring's steps, and hov'ring o'er her head,</L>

<HEAD>The Fable of IXION. To CHLORINDA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Same.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>IXION, as the poets tell us,</L>
<L>Was one of those pragmatic fellows,</L>
<L>Who claim a right to kiss the hand</L>
<L>Of the best lady in the land;</L>
<L>Demonstrating by dint of reason,</L>
<L>That impudence in love's no treason.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He let his fancy soar much higher;</L>
<L>And ventur'd boldly to aspire</L>
<L>To Juno's high and mighty grace,</L>
<L>And woo'd the goddess face to face.</L>
<L><PB N="243" REF="245"/>
What mortal e'er had whims so odd,</L>
<L>To think of cuckolding a God?</L>
<L>For she was both Jove's wife and sister,</L>
<L>And yet the rascal wou'd have kiss'd her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How he got up to heav'n's high palace,</L>
<L>Not one of all the poets tell us;</L>
<L>It must be therefore understood,</L>
<L>That he got up which way he cou'd.</L>
<L>Nor is it, that I know, recorded,</L>
<L>How bows were made, and speeches worded;</L>
<L>So, leaving this to each one's guess,</L>
<L>I'll only tell you the success.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But first I stop awhile to shew</L>
<L>What happen'd lately here below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Chlorinda, who beyond compare</L>
<L>Of all the fair ones is most fair;</L>
<L>Chlorinda, by the Gods design'd</L>
<L>To be the pattern of her kind,</L>
<L>With every charm of face and mind;</L>
<L>Glanc'd light'ning from her eyes so blue,</L>
<L>And shot poor Strephon through and through.</L>
<L>He, over head and ears her lover,</L>
<L>Try'd all the ways he cou'd to move her;</L>
<L>He sigh'd, and vow'd, and pray'd and cry'd,</L>
<L>And did a thousand things beside:</L>
<L>She let him sigh, and pray, and cry on—</L>
<L>But now hear more about Ixion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
<L>The Goddess, proud, (as folks report her)</L>
<L>Disdain'd that mortal wight shou'd court her,</L>
<L>And yet she chose the fool to flatter,</L>
<L>To make him fancy some great matter,</L>
<L>And hope in time he might get at her;</L>
<L>Grac'd him with now and then a smile,</L>
<L>But inly scorn'd him all the while;</L>
<L>Resolv'd at last a trick to shew him,</L>
<L>Seeming to yield and so undo him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now which way, do ye think, she took?</L>
<L>(For do't she wou'd by hook or crook)</L>
<L>Why, thus I find it in my book.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She call'd a pretty painted cloud,</L>
<L>The brightest of the wand'ring crowd,</L>
<L>For she you know is queen o' th' air,</L>
<L>And all the clouds and vapours there</L>
<L>Governs at will, by nod or summons,</L>
<L>As Walpole does the house of commons.</L>
<L>This cloud which came to her stark naked,</L>
<L>She dress'd as fine as hands cou'd make it.</L>
<L>From her own wardrobe out she brought</L>
<L>Whate'er was dainty, wove or wrought.</L>
<L>A smock which Pallas spun and gave her</L>
<L>Once on a time to gain her favour;</L>
<L>A gown that ha'n't on earth its fellow,</L>
<L>Of finest blue and lin'd with yellow,</L>
<L>Fit for a Goddess to appear in,</L>
<L>And not a pin the worse for wearing.</L>
<L><PB N="245" REF="247"/>
A quilted petticoat beside,</L>
<L>With whalebone hoop six fathom wide.</L>
<L>With these she deck'd the cloud d'ye see?</L>
<L>As like herself, as like cou'd be:</L>
<L>So like, that cou'd not I or you know</L>
<L>Which was the cloud, and which was Juno.</L>
<L>Thus dress'd she sent it to the villain,</L>
<L>To let him act his wicked will on:</L>
<L>Then laugh'd at the poor fool aloud,</L>
<L>Who for a Goddess grasp'd the cloud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This you will say was well done on her</L>
<L>T' expose the tempter of her honour—</L>
<L>But more of him you need not hear;</L>
<L>Only to Strephon lend an car.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He never entertain'd one thought</L>
<L>With which a Goddess could find fault;</L>
<L>His spotless love might be forgiven</L>
<L>By ev'ry saint in earth and heav'n.</L>
<L>Juno herself, tho' nice and haughty,</L>
<L>Wou'd not have judg'd his passion naughty.</L>
<L>All this Chlorinda's self confess'd,</L>
<L>And own'd his flame was pure and chaste,</L>
<L>Read what his teeming Muse brought forth,</L>
<L>And prais'd it far beyond its worth:</L>
<L>Mildly receiv'd his fond address,</L>
<L>And only blam'd his love's excess:</L>
<L>Yet she, so good, so sweet, so smiling,</L>
<L>So full of truth, so unbeguiling,</L>

One way or other still devis'd,</L>

<HEAD>Epistle from the late Lord Viscount B—GB—KE to Miss LUCY A—K—NS.</HEAD>
<L>DEAR thoughtless CLARA to my verse attend,</L>
<L>Believe for once thy lover and thy friend;</L>
<L>Heaven to each sex has various gifts assign'd,</L>
<L>And shewn an equal care of human-kind;</L>
<L>Strength does to man's imperial race belong,</L>
<L>To yours that beauty which subdues the strong;</L>
<L>But as our strength when misapply'd, is lost,</L>
<L>And what should save, urges our ruin most.</L>
<L>Just so, when beauty prostituted lies,</L>
<L>Of bawds the prey, of rakes th' abandon'd prize,</L>
<L>Women no more their empire can maintain,</L>
<L>Nor hope, vile slaves of lust, by love to reign,</L>
<L>Superior charms but make their case the worse,</L>
<L>And what should be their blessing, prove their curse.</L>
<L>Oh nymph! that might reclin'd on Cupid's breast,</L>
<L>Like Psyche, sooth the God of love to rest;</L>
<L>Or, if ambition mov'd thee, Jove enthral,</L>
<L>Brandish his thunder, and direct its fall;</L>
<L>Survey thyself, contemplate ev'ry grace</L>
<L>Of that sweet form, of that angelic face,</L>
<L>Then CLARA say, were those delicious charms</L>
<L>Meant for lewd brothels, and rude ruffians arms?</L>
<L>No CLARA, no! that person, and that mind,</L>
<L>Were form'd by nature, and by heaven design'd</L>
<L><PB N="268" REF="270"/>
For nobler ends; to these return, tho' late,</L>
<L>Return to these, and so avert thy fate.</L>
<L>Think CLARA, think, (nor will that thought be vain)</L>
<L>Thy slave, thy HARRY, doom'd to drag his chain</L>
<L>Of love, ill-treated and abus'd, that he</L>
<L>From more inglorious chains might rescue thee.</L>
<L>Thy drooping health restor'd; by his fond care,</L>
<L>Once more thy beauty its full lustre wear;</L>
<L>Mov'd by his love, by his example taught,</L>
<L>Soon shall thy soul, once more with virtue fraught,</L>
<L>With kind and gen'rous truth thy bosom warm,</L>
<L>And thy fair mind, like thy fair person charm.</L>
<L>To virtue thus, and to thyself restor'd,</L>
<L>By all admir'd, by one alone ador'd,</L>
<L>Be to thy HARRY ever kind and true,</L>

<L>Except but his own, there's a cheat in them all:</L>
<L>When tax'd with imposture the charge he'll evade,</L>

<HEAD>Extempore Verses upon a Trial of Skill be∣tween the two great Masters of Defence, Messieurs FIGG and SUTTON.</HEAD>

<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>LONG was the great Figg, by the prize-fighting swains,</L>
<L>Sole monarch acknowledg'd of Mary-bone plains:</L>
<L>To the towns, far and near, did his valour extend,</L>
<L>And swam down the river from Thame to Gravesend;</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="289"/>
Where liv'd Mr. Sutton, pipemaker by trade,</L>
<L>Who hearing that Figg was thought such a stout blade,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to put in for a share of his fame,</L>
<L>And so sent to challenge the champion of Thame.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>With alternate advantage two trials had past,</L>
<L>When they fought out the rubbers on Wednesday last.</L>
<L>To see such a contest the house was so full</L>
<L>There hardly was room left to thrust in your skull.</L>
<L>With a prelude of cudgells we first were saluted,</L>
<L>And two or three shoulders most handsomely fluted;</L>
<L>Till weary at last with inferior disasters,</L>
<L>All the company cry'd, come, the masters, the masters.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Whereupon the bold Sutton first mounted the stage,</L>
<L>Made his honours as usual and yearn'd to engage;</L>
<L>Then Figg, with a visage so fierce, yet sedate,</L>
<L>Came, and enter'd the lists, with his fresh-shaven pate;</L>
<L>Their arms were encircled with armigers too,</L>
<L>With a red ribbon Sutton's, and Figg's with a blue.</L>
<L>Thus adorn'd the two heroes, 'twixt shoulder, and elbow,</L>
<L>Shook hands, and went to't, and the word it was Bilboe.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Sure such a concern in the eyes of spectators,</L>
<L>Was never yet seen in our amphi-theatres.</L>
<L>Our commons and peers from the several places,</L>
<L>To half an inch distance all pointed their faces;</L>
<L>While the rays of old Phoebus, that shot thro' the sky-light,</L>
<L>Seem'd to make on the stage a new kind of twilight;</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="290"/>
And the Gods without doubt, if one cou'd but have seen 'em,</L>
<L>Were peeping there thro' to do justice between 'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>Figg struck the first stroke, and with such a vast fury,</L>
<L>That he broke his huge weapon in twain, I assure you;</L>
<L>And if his brave rival this blow had not warded,</L>
<L>His head from his shoulders had been quite discarded.</L>
<L>Figg arm'd him again, and they took t'other tilt,</L>
<L>And then Sutton's blade ran away from it's hilt;</L>
<L>The weapons were frighted, but as for the men,</L>
<L>In truth they ne'er minded, but at it again.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Such a force in their blows, you'd have thought it a wonder</L>
<L>Every stroke they receiv'd did not cleave 'em asunder.</L>
<L>Yet so great was their courage, so equal their skill,</L>
<L>That they both seem'd as safe as a thief in a mill;</L>
<L>While in doubtful attention dame Victory stood,</L>
<L>And which side to take cou'd not tell for her blood,</L>
<L>But remain'd like the ass 'twixt the bundles of hay,</L>
<L>Without ever stirring an inch either way.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Till Jove to the Gods signified his intention</L>
<L>In a speech that he made 'em too tedious to mention;</L>
<L>But the upshot on't was, that at that very bout,</L>
<L>From a wound in Figg's side the hot blood spouted out;</L>
<L>Her ladyship then seem'd to think the case plain,</L>
<L>But Figg stepping forth with a sullen disdain,</L>
<L>Shew'd the gash, and appeal'd to the company round,</L>
<L>If his own broken sword had not given him the wound.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<PB N="289" REF="291"/>
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>That bruises, and wounds a man's spirit shou'd touch,</L>
<L>With danger so little, with honour so much!</L>
<L>Well, they both took a dram, and return'd to the battle,</L>
<L>And with a fresh fury they made the swords rattle;</L>
<L>While Sutton's right arm was observed to bleed,</L>
<L>By a touch from his rival, so Jove had decreed;</L>
<L>Just enough for to shew that his blood was not icor,</L>
<L>But made up, like Figg's, of the common red-liquor.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Again they both rush'd with as equal a fire on,</L>
<L>'Till the company cry'd, hold, enough of cold iron,</L>
<L>To the quarter-staff now, lads. So first having dram'd it,</L>
<L>They took to their wood, and i' faith never sham'd it:</L>
<L>The first bout they had was so fair, and so handsome,</L>
<L>That to make a fair bargain, was worth a king's ransom;</L>
<L>And Sutton such bangs on his neighbour imparted,</L>
<L>Wou'd have made any fibres, but Figg's to have smarted.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>Then after that bout they went on to another,</L>
<L>But the matter must end on some fashion, or other;</L>
<L>So Jove told the Gods he had made a decree,</L>
<L>That Figg shou'd hit Sutton a stroke on the knee.</L>
<L>Tho' Sutton disabled as soon as he hit him</L>
<L>Wou'd still have fought on, but Jove wou'd not permit him;</L>
<L>'Twas his fate, not his fault, that constrain'd him to yield,</L>
<L>And thus the great Figg became lord of the field.</L>

<L>We may converse as well, or better?</L>

<L>I'll tell you as a friend, and crony,</L>

For time, and money, go together</L>
<L>As sure as weathercock, and weather;</L>
<L>And thrifty guardians all allow</L>
<L>This grave reflection to be true,</L>
<L>That whilst we pay so dear for learning</L>
<L>Those weighty truths we've no concern in,</L>
<L>The spark who squanders time away</L>
<L>In vain pursuits, and fruitless play,</L>
<L>Not only proves an arrant blockhead,</L>
<L>But, what's much worse, is out of pocket.</L>
<L>Whether my conduct bad, or good is,</L>
<L>Judge from the nature of my studies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more majestic Virgil's heights,</L>
<L>Nor tow'ring Milton's loftier flights,</L>
<L>Nor courtly Flaccus's rebukes,</L>
<L>Who banters vice with friendly jokes,</L>
<L>Nor Congreve's life, nor Cowley's fire,</L>
<L>Nor all the beauties that conspire</L>
<L>To place the greenest bays upon</L>
<L>Th' immortal brows of Addison;</L>
<L>Prior's inimitable ease,</L>
<L>Nor Pope's harmonious numbers please;</L>
<L>Homer indeed (for critics shew it)</L>
<L>Was both philosopher, and poet,</L>
<L>But tedious philosophic chapters</L>
<L>Quite stifle my poetic raptures,</L>
<L>And I to Phoebus bade adieu</L>
<L>When first I took my leave of you.</L>
<L><PB N="292" REF="294"/>
Now algebra, geometry,</L>
<L>Arithmetic, astronomy,</L>
<L>Optics, chronology, and statics,</L>
<L>All tiresome parts of mathematics;</L>
<L>With twenty harder names than these</L>
<L>Disturb my brain, and break my peace.</L>
<L>All seeming inconsistencies</L>
<L>Are nicely solv'd by a's, and b's;</L>
<L>Our eye-sight is disprov'd by prisms,</L>
<L>Our arguments by syllogisms.</L>
<L>If I shou'd confidently write</L>
<L>This ink is black, this paper white,</L>
<L>Or to express myself yet fuller</L>
<L>Shou'd say that black, or white's a colour;</L>
<L>They'd contradict it, and perplex one</L>
<L>With motion, rays, and their reflexion,</L>
<L>And solve th' apparent falsehood by</L>
<L>The curious texture of the eye.</L>
<L>Shou'd I the poker want, and take it,</L>
<L>When't looks as hot, as fire can make it,</L>
<L>And burn my finger, and my coat,</L>
<L>They'd flatly tell me, 'tis not hot;</L>
<L>The fire, say they, has in't, tis true,</L>
<L>The pow'r of causing heat in you;</L>
<L>But no more heat's in fire that heats you,</L>
<L>Than there is pain in stick that beats you.</L>

The salts, and juices in all meat</L>
<L>Affect the tongues of them that eat,</L>

<L>Carnations, violets, and roses</L>
<L>Cause a sensation in our noses;</L>
<L>But then there's none of us can tell</L>

<L>So when melodious Mason sings,</L>

<L>Or when the trumpet's brisk alarms</L>
<L>Call forth the chearful youth to arms,</L>
<L>Convey'd thro' undulating air</L>
<L>The music's only in the ear.</L>

<L>Whether the man in't, as some tell ye,</L>

<L>Why like a lunatic confin'd</L>

<L>When he at one good hearty shake,</L>
<L>Might whirl his prison off his back;</L>

<L>No more! this due to friendship take,</L>

<L>OLD <HI>Plumb,</HI> who tho' blest in his <HI>Kentish</HI> retreat,</L>
<L>Still thrives by his oilshop in <HI>Leadenhall-street,</HI></L>
<L>With a <HI>Portugal</HI> merchant, a knight by creation,</L>
<L>From a borough in <HI>Cornwall</HI> receiv'd invitation.</L>
<L>Well-assured of each vote, well equip't from the alley,</L>
<L>In quest of election-adventures they sally.</L>
<L>Tho' much they discours'd, the long way to beguile,</L>
<L>Of the earthquakes, the Jews, and the change of the stile,</L>
<L>Of the Irish, the stocks, and the lott'ry committee,</L>
<L>They came silent and tired into <HI>Exeter</HI> city.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Some books, prithee landlord, to pass a dull hour;</L>
<L>"No nonsense of parsons, or methodists sour,</L>

<L>"O Lord! says mine host, you may hunt the town round,</L>

<L>"Shall I leave, quoth the fig-tree, my sweetness and fruit,</L>

<L>"Thus rebuff'd and surpriz'd they apply'd to the vine,</L>
<L>"He answer'd: shall I leave my grapes and my wine,</L>
<L>"(Wine the sovereign cordial of god and of man)</L>
<L>"To be made or the tool or the head of a clan?</L>
<L>"At last, as it always falls out in a scramble,</L>
<L>"The mob gave the cry for a bramble! a bramble!</L>
<L><PB N="302" REF="304"/>
"A bramble for ever! O! chance unexpected!</L>
<L>"But bramble prevail'd and was duly elected."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"O! ho! quoth the knight with a look most profound,</L>
<L>"Now I see there's some good <HI>in good books</HI> to be found.</L>
<L>"I wish I had read this same bible before:</L>
<L>"Of long miles at the least'twould have sav'd us fourscore.</L>
<L>"You, <HI>Plumb,</HI> with your olives and oil might have staid,</L>
<L>"And myself might have tarried my wines to unlade.</L>
<L>"What have merchants to do from their business to ramble!</L>
<L>"Your electioneer-errant should still be a bramble."</L>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now, by the advice and assistance of my friends, brought this Collection of POEMS to a com∣petent size, it has been thought proper that the further pro∣gress of its growth should here be stop'd. From the loose and fugitive pieces, some printed, others in manuscript, which for forty or fifty years past have been thrown into the world, and carelessly left to perish; I have here, according to the most judicious opinions I could obtain in distinguish∣ing their merits, endeavour'd to select and preserve the best. The favourable reception which the former volumes have met with, demands my warmest acknowledgments, and calls for all my care in compleating the Collection; and in this respect, if it appear that I have not been altogether negligent, I shall hope to be allow'd the merit, which is all I claim, of having furnish'd to the Public an elegant and polite Amusement. Little more need be added, than to return my thanks to several ingenious friends, who have obligingly contributed to this Entertainment. If the reader should happen to find, what I hope he seldom will, any pieces which he may think unworthy of having been inserted; as it would ill become me to attribute his dislike of them to his own want of Taste, so I am too con∣scious of my own deficiencies not to allow him to im∣pute the insertion of them to mine.</P>
