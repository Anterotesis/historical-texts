<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A SINCERE wish to benefit the com∣munity, by furnishing its most ancient, most constitutional, and most useful officer with a compendious system or manual of his duty and powers, carefully extracted from, and upon an actual perusal of the best autho∣rities, has produced the following sheets,—a mere epitome, in fact, of the original com∣pilation. But the utility of the measure seemed, upon second thoughts, to be more favoured by a pamphlet, affording the fullest information in the narrowest compass, than by a volume, which the verbose prolixity of mo∣dern statutes, vying, as it were, with each other in conveying the simplest regulation in the most embarrassing manner, and greatest possible number of words, would have ex∣tended to a size and price little calculated to invite the class of readers for whom it was principally intended. The decision, therefor, was in favour of the briefest summary; such a one as men who have little money, leisure, or capacity (one or other, or, indeed, all of
<PB N="iv" REF="9"/>which are, unfortunately, too often met with in the composition of a modern constable) might buy, read, and, if possible, understand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A small tract published under the direction of "the society (as it is called) for carrying into effect the kings proclamation," since the following pages were prepared for the press, has not appeared to supersede the present attempt. Of former publications on the subject it may be sufficient to observe, that all or most of them have been looked into.</NOTE>. The language, however, is generally that of the authority quoted; and the books referred to (which it may be occasionally necessary to consult) are to be found in many booksellers shops, and in the libraries of the four law so∣cieties: few barristers, at the same time, are without all or most of them; and some jus∣tices of peace, it is presumed, may possess "The Statutes at Large." It is undoubtedly a serious consideration, that the persons and property of almost all but professional men should be subjected to laws which they are totally ignorant of, and do not even know where to find, or how, unless by dear-bought and fatal experience, to get acquainted with; and of which the mere study is sufficient em∣ployment for the best part, if not the whole, of a long life. These "Statutes at Large," which, while they preserve many acts that are
<PB N="v" REF="10"/>not, and many more that ought not to be, in force, do not contain above half the number that are actually so<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The private and local acts, every where in force and no where to be met with, are at least as numerous. "How is this?" exclaimed a lawyer one day, "why all these proceedings of yours are manifestly illegal; con∣trary to <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> to the Bill of Rights, to the li∣berty of the subject, to —." "Sir," says his client, who was a churchwarden, "we have got an act of par∣liament." And thus it is; every little dirty parish in the environs of London must have a law for itself. The churchwardens or overseers can provide the money, the attorney wants a job, the justice looks forward to the pe∣nalties, and the <HI>gemmen of the westry</HI> like authority; an act of parliament is accordingly obtained, and, being an admirable compound of ignorance and knavery, cannot fail of proving exceedingly beneficial to the community. To the statutes which <HI>are not</HI> and <HI>ought not to be in force</HI> may be added those which are altogether doubtful, and, till they come in question, cannot be positively said either to be in force or not. The drawer of a modern act of parliament seldom troubles himself about former laws on the same subject; he erects the new house and leaves the old one standing. It is a well-known observation of a grave and learned serjeant, that an act of parliament was much wanted to repeal all the laws made for thirty years past. This, to be sure, would be pretty well; but a retrospect of two or three hundred would be infinitely better. Lord Coke complains bitterly of the injudi∣cious penners of acts of parliament in his time, "over∣laden," as he says, " with provisoes and additions, and many times on a sudden penned or corrected by men of none or very little judgment in law." Those acts, however, which gave such just offence to this truly learned and eminent lawyer, will appear perspicuous as light, and "brief as womans love," when compared with the endless and inextricable parliamentary labyrinths of the present century. See also 1 Black. Com. 10.</NOTE>, are comprised in no less
<PB N="vi" REF="11"/>than <HI>sixteen closely printed quarto volumes;</HI> the Common Law is dispersed through near <HI>two hundred folios,</HI> exclusive of every other size, many of which exist only in a barbarous gibberish peculiar to the profession<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was long since objected as a fault to the profes∣sors of the law, that they wrote their reports and books of the law in a strange and unknown tongue, which none could understand but themselves, to the end that people being kept in ignorance of the law, might the more ad∣mire their skill and knowlege, and esteem and value it at a higher price. Preface to Sir John Davis's Reports, published in 1628.</NOTE>: even a very imperfect <HI>abridgement</HI> of it filling no less than <HI>twenty-four.</HI> This, however, is a com∣plaint which has been so frequently and so in∣effectually made<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bishop Burnet, near a century ago, pronounced the law "the greatest grievance of the nation." And the great lord Bacon, who complains that the laws were then "subject to great incertainties, and variety of opi∣nions, delays, and evasions," delivered a formal propo∣sition to king James I. for their amendment; and this at a time when the statutes were in <HI>two</HI> volumes, and, beside the year books, there were but <HI>four reporters</HI> ex∣tant.</NOTE>, that one must have pa∣tience
<PB N="vii" REF="12"/>till the mischief, every day increasing, shall remedy itself; till, in short, "there is A DROP TOO MUCH."</P>
<P>Sir William Blackstone observes that, con∣sidering what manner of men are for the most part out into the office of constable, it is per∣haps very well that they are generally kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Com. 356.</NOTE>; an observation to which it may be readily con∣ceived, the compiler of the following Digest does not subscribe. In fact, he has ever re∣garded it as equally sarcastic, illiberal, and unbecoming; and only to be accounted for by the professional character and habits of the writer; who, doubtless, thought that <HI>law,</HI> like <HI>religion,</HI> being a <HI>mystery,</HI> the <HI>scriptures</HI> should in both cases be locked up in an <HI>unknown lan∣guage</HI> or <HI>unintelligible jargon</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">3 Com. 322. and Benthams Fragment of Govern∣ment, Preface, p. xxxv.</NOTE>; that the <HI>pro∣fane</HI> ought to know no more than the <HI>initiated</HI> may think fit to communicate; and that, in short, the most ignorant are the most trac∣table, and consequently the fittest for good Christians and good subjects. If the powers which the law has vested in the constable be so large, that it is even dangerous he should know them, why were they given him? why
<PB N="viii" REF="13"/>are they not taken away? why is he to be punished for neglecting duties of which it is best he should be ignorant? Would it not be full as well, considering what manner of men are for the most part put into the office of justice of peace, if they too were to be kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers? This, indeed, it may be, is already the case; though they do not on that account seem the less inclined to abuse them. But wherefor is it that such "manner of men" are put into the Office of Constable? Because upward of a hundred acts of parliament, which few ever see, and still fewer comprehend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The emperor Caligula, it is said, caused his laws to be written so small, and placed so high, that, though all might clearly see, none could possibly read. The English law is thought by some to bear in many instances a great resemblance to the Roman. And it seems a maxim in both, that <HI>ignorantia legis non excusat.</HI> Others have not hesitated to say that British statutes resemble cobwebs, placed in darkness and obscurity, for the purpose of en∣trapping the smaller flies, in order to glut the <HI>bottled-spiders</HI> of Westminster Hall with their blood. But these, no doubt, are the ravings of beggered suitors, and con∣sequently not to be regarded.</NOTE>, added to the arbitrary and capricious decisions of some courts, and the ignorance and innovation of others, have redered it so burthensome, ser∣vile, vexatious, and expensive, that they who possess or usurp the power of filling it, select
<PB N="ix" REF="14"/>those who have nothing to recommend them but the willingness with which they receive the yoke, and the patience with which they bear it. The reason given for this partiality is, that <HI>no</HI> GENTLEMAN can accept <HI>such an office;</HI> poverty, both in purse and in spirit, being looked upon as the proper qualification for a consta∣ble. These same GENTLEMEN, it should seem, are <HI>high-mettled horses,</HI> who would kick and wince, and play the devil, in short, if you at∣tempted to put them in the shafts; the VUL∣GAR are <HI>asses,</HI> who tamely submit to every in∣dignity. But, gentleman or no gentleman, he who can best afford to lose his time and mo∣ney, who has spirit and ability to sustain fa∣tigue, and resolution to oppose insult and op∣pression, is the fittest person to discharge the Office of Constable. To confer it, from what∣ever motive, upon people of base or inferior condition, was long ago reprobated by lord Bacon as "a mere abuse or degenerating from the first institution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Law Tracts, 183.</NOTE>." And, certainly, the ne∣cessity of a man who depends upon his daily employment for the daily bread of himself and his family, and whose time is of course the most precious, ought to be a sufficient excuse in any court of justice why he should not be
<PB N="x" REF="15"/>compelled to serve this office; only it would probably cost him more to obtain the deter∣mination than he can value his time at. It is, doubtless, a very scandalous insinuation that justices of peace, who have some how or other acquired the power of making constables, se∣lect the meanest and most ignorant by way of magnifying their own wisdom and conse∣quence; gems, it is well known, which re∣quire no foil to increase their lustre.</P>
<P>It is, by no means, a less abuse, when a person every way fit for the office is pitched upon, to admit in his stead any worthless fellow that he can procure, base enough to serve the duty for a few guineas. What integrity or pro∣priety of conduct can be expected from one whose necessity renders every shilling that is offered him an irresistible temptation? The great Shakspeare has satirised this practice with admirable pleasantry, in his play of <HI>Mea∣sure for Measure,</HI> where he introduces the character of a foolish substitute bringing a charge before one of the dukes deputies:</P>
<P><HI>Escalus.</HI> Come hither to me, master Elbow; come hither, master constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?</P>
<P><HI>Elbow.</HI> Seven years and a half, sir.</P>
<P><HI>Esca.</HI> I thought, by your readiness in the office, you
<PB N="xi" REF="16"/>had continued in it some time.—Alas! it hath been great pains to you! they do you wrong to put you so oft upon it. Are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it.</P>
<P><HI>Elbow.</HI> Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I do it for some piece of money, and go through with all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is another not over-wise constable in the Comedy of <HI>Much ado about Nothing;</HI> and again in that of <HI>Loves Labour Lost.</HI> It is to be hoped such a character is not so very common now a days.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If the preservation of peace and good order be the interest of society, the legislature would essentially contribute to that end in extending more effectual protection and encouragement to the constable. This would be done by causing all the laws which authorise or oblige him to do particular acts, or any way concern the execution of his office, to be reduced into a single statute, conceived in plain intelli∣gible language<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A resolution of all the judges would answer the same purpose. Something of this kind, it is true, was formerly attempted by a chief justice, but being hastily, carelessly, and every way badly done, was deservedly re∣jected by his brethren.</NOTE>; and by requiring every court, at the election of a constable, to put a
<PB N="xii" REF="17"/>copy of it into his hands: in order that, hav∣ing his power and duty constantly under his eye, he might be without excuse in neglecting the one, and without danger in exercising the other. If it be true that every man who serves the public ought to be paid by the public, it is most unreasonable and unjust that a duty should be imposed upon any one, which, if attended to as it ought to be, would demand the greatest part of his time, not only without making him the slightest recompence, but even obliging him to be at (what is to him) a considerable expence; for even the mere "consumption of time, to him who lives by the sale of his time, is equivalent to expence." Suppose, therefor, that every person duly elect∣ed a constable were, during his continuance in office, not exceeding one year, exempt from all taxes and impositions; parliamentary, or lo∣cal; and, in case of actions against him touch∣ing his office (the dread of which is one great obstacle to its due execution) should be al∣lowed to defend, not <HI>in forma pauperis,</HI> but some really unexpensive mode<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The defence of actions by an <HI>innocent man</HI> requires the fortune of a <HI>rich one.</HI> Even a <HI>pauper,</HI> who is to swear himself not worth <HI>five pounds</HI> in the world, will have to provide <HI>ten,</HI> or possibly <HI>fifty</HI> times that sum, to prosecute or defend his suit.</NOTE> This, if not an
<PB N="xiii" REF="18"/>adequate compensation, would be a great re∣lief, and in some cases, at least, an indemnity, to persons serving the office, would induce them to accept it with cheerfulness, and ex∣ecute it with spirit, conscious that in so doing they were benefiting society without injuring themselves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In some parts of the north, the constable is intitled to an ancient <HI>cess</HI> charged upon certain lands, which has formerly amounted to a pretty considerable sum.</NOTE>. One cannot, however, have the satisfaction to think, that a suggestion so ad∣vantageous both to the community and to the individual, stands the least chance of ever passing into a law. If, indeed, the proposal were for a productive tax upon constables, or for the purpose of making bad worse, or of heaping oppression upon the oppressed, there would be little fear of its being adopted. This, therefor, is another of those self-re∣forming grievances which must be patiently suffered to attain their <HI>worst</HI> state.</P>
<P>To conclude: If the following pages prove at all instrumental toward making a single constable more active, confident, and secure in the discharge of such of the powers and duties of his office as are any way beneficial to society, (for the less he attends to the others
<PB N="xiv" REF="19"/>the better,) the compiler will have reason to flatter himself that his efforts, though humble, have not been useless,</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>§ 1. THE origin of the word CONSTABLE, which some etymologists have errone∣ously sought for in the Saxon language<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">See Lambard, Sir T. Smith, and others.</NOTE>, is un∣doubtedly to be found in the <HI>Comes Stabuli</HI> of the Eastern empire: hence the <HI>constabularius, constabu∣lus,</HI> &amp;c. of barbarous Latinity; the <HI>connestable</HI> of the French; the <HI>conestabile</HI> of the Italians, &amp;<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">See Spelmans Glossary, <HI>voce</HI> CONSTABULARIU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> This <HI>comes stabuli</HI> was at first, as his title imports, no more than prefect or superintendant of the imperial stables, or, in other words, the emperors master of the horse; but having, in process of time, obtained the command of the army, his name, corrupted into <HI>constabulus</HI> and <HI>constabularius,</HI> began to signify a commander; and, with this signification, appears to have been introduced into England at the Norman Conquest, or, perhaps, sooner; since, in fact, some such officer seems to have been already known un∣der the title of <HI>Stallarius.</HI></P>
<P>§ 2. THE CONSTABLE (or LORD HIGH CON∣STABLE) OF ENGLAND was an officer of the highest dignity and importance in the realm. He was the leader of the kings armies; and had the cogni∣zance of all contracts and other matters touching
<PB N="xvi" REF="21"/>arms or war<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">13 R. z. st. 1. c. 2. See also. Madox's History of the Exchequer, p. 27, &amp;c.</NOTE>. This office, which appears to have been granted by William the Conqueror to Walter earl of Gloucester, or, according to others, to William Fitzosbern, or Roger de Mortimer, be∣came, afterward, hereditary in two different families, as annexed to the earldom of Hereford; and, in that right, after a lapse of near two centuries, (several persons enjoying the title and authority in the mean time) was revived, by judgement of law, in the per∣son of Edward Stafford duke of Buckingham; but Henry VIII. thinking the office too high and dan∣gerous for the hands of a subject, took the first op∣portunity of putting an end to it by cutting off his head. Since this period, there has been no lord high constable, except <HI>pro hac vice,</HI> as Robert earl of Lindsey was appointed in 1631 to determine the appeal of lord Rea against Ramsey, and as some person or other is created at the coronation of a king or queen.</P>
<P>§ 3. We had also CONSTABLES OF CASTLES, that is, keepers or governors, so called, of the castles of the king or great barons, whom the French term <HI>châtellains,</HI> from the Latin <HI>castellani,</HI> and who were frequently hereditary, and by feudal tenure; such were the constable of the tower, the constable of London, or Baynards-castle, the constables of the castles of Dover, Windsor, Chester, Flint, &amp;c. some of which offices, though not now hereditary, are re∣maining to this day. These are the constables in∣tended in <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> cc. 17. 20. and who, in the statute of Westminster the first (3 E. 1. c. 15.)
<PB N="xvii" REF="22"/>are called constables of sees, and there considered as keepers of prisons; a constituent part, indeed, of all ancient castles. Lord Coke observes that be∣fore <HI>Magna Charta</HI> these constables of castles had the like authority within their precincts as the sheriff had within his bailiwick, and commonly sealed with their portraiture on horseback <NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot">2 Inst. 31. See also W. 1. c. 17.</NOTE>. The statute of 5 H. 4. c. 10. which recites that, by colour of their commissions as justices of the peace, they took peo∣ple to whom they bore evil will, and imprisoned them in their castles till they made fine and ransom for their deliverance, and ordains that none be im∣prisoned but in the common jail, seems to have put an end to a race of tyrants so odious to the people as to be usually represented in romances under the character of monstrous giants, who, not content with the property, would eat the flesh, drink the blood, and grind the bones of the unwary and un∣fortunate traveler.</P>
<P>§ 4. There was likewise formerly a CONSTABLE OF THE EXCHEQUER; of whom we may read in the <HI>Dialogus Scaccarii,</HI> l. 1. c. 5. in the statute <HI>De Districtione Scaccarii</HI> (51 H. 3. st. 5.) in Fleta, l. 2. c. 31. and in Madox's History of that Court, p. 724, &amp;c. We also find mention made in some old sta∣tutes of THE CONSTABLE OF THE STAPLE. See 27 E. 3. c. 8. 15 R. 2. c. 9. 23 H. 8. c. 6.</P>
<P>§ 5. We now come to THE CONSTABLE OF THE HUNDRED, OR HIGH, CHIEF, OR HEAD CON∣STABLE (as he is otherwise called) of whom we shall have a little more to say. By the statute of
<PB N="xviii" REF="23"/>Wynton, or Winchester (13 E. 1.) c. 6. it is or∣dained, that in every hundred or franchise there shall be chosen two constables to make the view of ar∣mour, as directed in the preceding part of the chap∣ter; and that the constables aforesaid shall present before the justices assigned the defaults of armour and of the suits of towns and of highways; and shall also present those who harbour strangers in up∣land towns for whom they will not answer. They are likewise to present sheriffs or bailiffs who do not follow the cry of the county.</P>
<P>It is agreed by Mr. Lamberd<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">On Constables, 3.</NOTE>, by sir Edward Coke<NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">4 Inst. 267.</NOTE>, and by sir Matthew Hale<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot">2 P. C. 96.</NOTE>, that con∣stables of the hundred were first introduced by this statute. And though Fitzherbert<NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot">J. P. 156, b.</NOTE>, and Crompton after him<NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot">J. P. 201, b.</NOTE>, have asserted that they were conser∣vators of the peace at the Common Law; and though it is said in other books that "notwithstanding the opinions to the contrary," the high constable was an officer at the Common Law, and that the statute of Wynton only enlarged his authority<NOTE N="(10)" PLACE="foot">3 Keble, 231. Salk. 175. 381. 11 Mod. 215. L. Rav. 1193. 1195.</NOTE>, yet no one has hitherto produced the least evidence in support of such assertion. On the other hand, beside the au∣thority of Coke and Hale, it has been expressly held from the Bench, that a high constable is not such an officer, nor conservator of the peace, whereof the
<PB N="xix" REF="24"/>Common Law takes any notice; that he is not men∣tioned in any book; and that, in fine, he is only by custom and for conformity<NOTE N="(11)" PLACE="foot">Cro. Eliz. 375. where it is said that in the North they had no high constables, which appears from Nordens <HI>Description,</HI> p. 30. to be the case in Cornwall.</NOTE>. It must be con∣fessed, that the first mention made of the high con∣stable in any statute subsequent to that already cited, is by 4 E. 4. c. 1.<NOTE N="(12)" PLACE="foot">He afterwards occurs in 19 H. 7. c. 11. 22 H. 8. c. 23. 24 H. 8. c. 10, &amp;c.</NOTE> And though sir William Blackstone has, in one place, attempted to carry up his antiquity as high as king Henry II.<NOTE N="(13)" PLACE="foot">4 Com. 211. The <HI>praepositus hundredi,</HI> whom the learned author has mistaken for the high constable, seems to have been the bailiff of the hundred, as <HI>praepositus comitatus</HI> is the sheriff, and <HI>praepositus manerii</HI> the bailiff or reve of the manor. <HI>Vide</HI> Spelman, <HI>in voce.</HI> The <HI>praepositus hundredi</HI> is frequently mentioned in Domesday Book.</NOTE> he, in an∣other, expressly mentions him to have been first or∣dained by the statute of Winchester<NOTE N="(14)" PLACE="foot">1 Com. 355.</NOTE>. After all, however, nothing can be more certain than that the constable of the hundred, or high constable, whether he be allowed an officer at the Common Law or not, was instituted long before that statute. This curious fact is ascertained by a writ or mandate of the 36th year of king Henry III. preserved in the <HI>Adversaria</HI> to Wats's edition of Matthew Paris, and from which chapters 4. and 6. of the statute of Wynton are evidently taken, though it has hitherto escaped the notice of every writer or speaker upon the subject. By this writ it is provided, that in every hundred there should be constituted a CHIEF
<PB N="xx" REF="25"/>CONSTABLE, at whose mandate all those of his hun∣dred sworn to arms [<HI>i. e.</HI> to have such arms, accord∣ing to the quantity of their lands or chattels, as there directed] should assemble and be observant to him for the doing of those things which belong to the conservation of the kings peace<NOTE N="(15)" PLACE="foot">In singulis vero hundredis constituatur <HI>UNUS CAPITA∣LIS CONSTABULARIUS,</HI> ad cujus mandatum omnet jurati ad arma de hundredis suis conveniant, &amp; cis sint intendentes ad fa∣ciendum ea quae spectant ad conservationem pacis nostrae.</NOTE>. No men∣tion, it is believed, of this officer can be any where found prior to the date of this instrument; which, however, it may be contended, no more determines the question as to his original creation, than the sta∣tute of Wynton appeared to do; the language in both cases being imperative, and the only difference consisting in the word <HI>eleus</HI> (chosen) for <HI>constituatur</HI> (constituted). Be this as it will, the discovery ought at least to teach not antiquaries alone, but even lawyers and judges to look a little into matter of record, and trust less to opinion, which ought no more to be law upon the Bench than it is off it.</P>
<P>§ 6. The CONSTABLE OF THE VILL (or PETTY CONSTABLE, as, to distinguish him from the con∣stable of the hundred, he is frequently called) has been repeatedly acknowleged by the law to be "one of the most ancient officers in the realm for the conservation of the peace<NOTE N="(16)" PLACE="foot">Popham, 13. and below, p. 1.</NOTE>," and is declared by lord Coke to be as ancient as torns or leets be, and not to have begun about the beginning of E. 3. as some have supposed<NOTE N="(17)" PLACE="foot">4 Inst. 265. His lordship here alludes to the opinion of Mr. Lambard, who says, "About the beginning of the reign of K. Ed. 3. petty constables were devised in towns and parishes for the aid of the constables of the hundred." An opinion which certainly detracts from the character of Mr. Lambard as an industrious or judicious antiquary. Lord Bacon, on the contrary, who allows the great antiquity of (petty) constables, doubts that the high constable was not <HI>ab origine,</HI> and only introduced for conveniency sake "when the authority of the justices of the peace [who did not exist before the first year of Edw. 3.] was enlarged by divers statutes." Law Tracts, 181. An idea equally erroneous.</NOTE>. It must be confessed,
<PB N="xxi" REF="26"/>however, that no mention of him, by this identical name, is any where found to occur anterior to the writ or mandate, already mentioned, of king Hen∣ry III. whereby it is provided, that in every villate or township there should be constituted a constable or two, according to the number of the inhabitants<NOTE N="(18)" PLACE="foot">In singulis verò villatis aliis constituatur <HI>UNUS CON∣STABULARIUS</HI> vel duo, secundùm numerum inhabitantium &amp; provisionem praedictorum.</NOTE>. It is, nevertheless, pretty certain, that lord Cokes idea is right, and that this officer is actually owing to the institution of the frankpledge, usually attri∣buted to king Alfred, and was in fact originally the senior or chief pledge of the tithing or <HI>decenna.</HI> In support of this position we may observe, that the constable (or an officer resembling him) is, in many places, at this very day, called the <HI>headborough, tith∣ingman,</HI> or <HI>borsholder;</HI> all names belonging to the chief pledge, and to be found in numerous statutes in company with and as synonimous to <HI>constable</HI><NOTE N="(19)" PLACE="foot">See 28 H. c. 10. now repealed, in which we have likewise a <HI>thirdborough.</HI> See also Sir T. Smith, Com∣monwealth of England, 174, and Lambard on Constables <HI>passim.</HI></NOTE>;
<PB N="xxii" REF="27"/>that the statute of 2 E. 3. c. 3. in which the name of <HI>this</HI> constable first occurs, the words are "BURGH-ALDRES, CONESTABLES, <HI>et gardeins de la pees;</HI>" and, lastly, that in the stat. of 20 H. 6. c. 14. the "CONSTABLES, TITHINGMEN, and CHIEF PLEDGES of every town, are required to aid the venders of goods in disputes with the kings purveyors." It was therefor rightly adjudged in <HI>B. R.</HI> 23 <HI>C.</HI> 2. that "<HI>decennarius, prima facie,</HI> is the same with a con∣stable, and differed little in the execution of that office;" though Hale (who has elsewhere told us all he knew about the matter) said he was not the same officer<NOTE N="(20)" PLACE="foot">1 Ven. 170. It should seem, indeed, from Lambard and others, that where there is a constable as well as a tyth∣ingman, headborough, or thirdborough in one and the same place, the office of the latter is inferior to that of constable. In Shakspeares comedy of <HI>Much ado about Nothing,</HI> two of the characters are a "constable" and a "headborough;" but, though it is sufficiently evident that Master Dogherry, the con∣stable, takes a great deal more upon him than his "comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t∣ner." yet as he supposes himself by much the wiser man, it is not perfectly clear that he was invested with any greater degree of authority. It is allowed, however, that where there is only a headborough, thirdborough or tythingman, his of∣fice does not at all differ from that of constable. One is, there∣for, at a loss to conceive why the court (Gould J.) should, on the trial of Power for murder (O. B. Sep. 1789), ask one of the witnesses, "What are you, a <HI>constable</HI> or a <HI>headborough? —A.</HI> I am <HI>headborough</HI> of Aldgate." "Was there <HI>any consta∣ble</HI> in the passage at that time?—<HI>A.</HI> There was not." Since, the arrest being illegal for want of a <HI>warrant,</HI> it could make no difference what he was, nor whether any constable (sup∣posing Aldgate had <HI>both</HI> constable and headborough) were present or not. Sly, the drunken tinker, in the <HI>Taming of the Shrow,</HI> is threatened by his hostess with the <HI>"third∣borough;"</HI> and, the term not being familiar to the London edi∣tors, got corrupted into <HI>headborough,</HI> which is evidently in∣congruous and absurd; "<HI>Third, or fourth,</HI> or <HI>fifth</HI> borough," says he, "I'll answer him by law." In <HI>Loves Labour Lost,</HI> Goodman Dall says, he reprehends the duke own person, and calls himself "his grace's <HI>tharborough.</HI>"
Norden, in his <HI>Description of Cornwell,</HI> p. 30, tells us, that "tythinges have <HI>therdbarows,</HI> in some places <HI>hedborows,</HI> in some <HI>borrowsheds,</HI> and in the weste partes a tything man." And Ben Jonson, in his <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> introduces the "high constable of Ken∣tish-town," the "headborough" of Islington, the "petty con∣stable" of Hamstead, the "thirdborough" of Belsise, and "the high constables man." This <HI>thirdborough</HI> is supposed by Blount a corruption of the Sax<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>freoborg,</HI> or freepledge; but, if one may be allowed the conjecture, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not improba∣ble, that as the <HI>headborough,</HI> or chief pledge, was the <HI>first</HI> man of the <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>decenna,</HI> and had the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> authority, so the first man of each of the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>maining <HI>threes</HI> (that is, the <HI>first, fourth,</HI> and <HI>seventh</HI> of the <HI>nine</HI>) might have had some subordinate juris∣diction as his assistants, and hence receive the name of <HI>third∣boroughs.</HI> The common pledges were called <HI>handbarrows.</HI></NOTE>. It therefor follows, that the above ord∣nance
<PB N="xxiii" REF="28"/>of Hen. III. far from instituting the office, merely enlarged the number of officers, placing them in towns and villages, instead of franchises; since it might frequently happen, that a manor of great ex∣tent had only a single constable for several town∣ships; a case exactly similar, indeed, sometimes oc∣curring at this day, where a township, comprehend∣ing several hamlets, equally populous it may be with itself, has only one constable for the whole<NOTE N="(21)" PLACE="foot">The book of <HI>Villa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um,</HI> in the Exch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quer, sets out all the vills, and there cannot be a constablewick created at this lay (unless by act of parliament). 1 M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. 13.</NOTE>. We find the constable beginning to be familiarly known by that name in the time of king Edward I. though
<PB N="xxiv" REF="29"/>it is not a little extraordinary that (not to mention Bracton, who wrote toward the end of the reign of Henry III.) there should not be a word about him in either Britton<NOTE N="(22)" PLACE="foot">He seems to mean constables in chap. 16. by <HI>gardeins de villes.</HI></NOTE> or the Mirror, and that he should be only incidentally named by the author of Fleta <NOTE N="(23)" PLACE="foot">He is supposed to have been one of king Edward the First's judges, and by him committed to the <HI>Fleet.</HI> Britton, also, is thought to have been a judge, if not a bishop, in the time of the same prince.

<P>This passage is the rather curious, as we do not elsewhere find that the constable had any power to put people in irons, much less to detain them for so considerable a length of time. Possibly, however, it is to be understood of the constable or keeper of a castle, before mentioned; although in must be con∣fessed that the expression would in this case have been more accurately THE <HI>constable,</HI> since there could not well be more than <HI>one</HI> such officer attending the court.</P>
<P>§ 7. Notwithstanding any thing that has been said or omitted in the course of this enquiry, it seems highly probable that, at the Common Law, and be∣fore the mandate of Henry III. the constable of the hundred, and the constable of the manor, were offi∣cers of the same nature and authority, originating at the same time, and differing only as to the extent of their several districts: In short, that they bore to each other the same analogy as subsisted between the
<PB N="xxvii" REF="32"/>bailiff of the hundred and the bailiff of the manor; and, consequently, that the local jurisdiction of the constable of the hundred was commensurate with that of the torn or leet at which he was elected, be∣ing such part of the division only as was not com∣prehended within the jurisdiction of any other leet. It follows, therefor, that the constable of the hundred neither possessed nor could have exercised any more authority within the precinct of the leet, than the constable of one manor possessed or could have ex∣ercised in another; the manor being, to all intents and purposes, exempt from and excluded out of the hundred<NOTE N="(30)" PLACE="foot">See 4 Inst. 261. It should hence seem that at this day a warrant directed to all constables generally, cannot be legally executed by the high constable within the limits of any petty constablery.</NOTE>. The preeminence, therefor, which the constable of the hundred is supposed to have, or may think proper to assume, over the constables of manors or townships within the hundred, is alto∣gether unfounded and imaginary, and might, with equal justice or propriety, be claimed by the bailiff of the hundred or sheriff of the county over the bai∣liff of the manor, or, in short, by any one constable over another whose district was more circumscribed; for though, as lord Bacon observes, the high con∣stables authority hath the more ample circuit, "yet I do not find," says he, "that the petty constable is subordinate to the high constable, or to be ordered or commanded by him<NOTE N="(31)" PLACE="foot">Law Tracts, 181.187.</NOTE>." Those cases, therefor, wherein it has been adjudged, that the being subject to a particular leet shall not excuse a man from serving the office of constable of the hundred, seem
<PB N="xxviii" REF="33"/>to have been decided upon a wrong principle, and (to use an expression of sir Edward Coke) "for want of the knowlege of antiquity<NOTE N="(32)" PLACE="foot">3 Keble, 197.230, 231. Freeman, 348.11 Mod. 215.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>All this, however, is spoken with an exception not of acts of parliament only, which, tinker-like, for one flaw they pretend to remedy, make a hun∣dred <NOTE N="(33)" PLACE="foot">To offer advice to the legislature may be a pre∣sumptuous but is certainly a useless measure.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aid of the country.</NOTE> THE constable shall have aid of the country to pacify affray.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromp. J. P. 131.</NOTE><NOTE N="{inverted ⁂}" PLACE="foot">Constables are usually summoned by the sheriff to attend at the quarter sessions and assizes to make presentments, &amp;c. which though not warranted by any express law, must be allowed a very ancient usage; but the following practice seems to be per∣fectly unjustifiable. The grand inquest for the county of Middle∣sex, previous to their sitting, and before they are sworn, issue a warrant, under their hands and seals, to the high constable, com∣manding him to summon the petty constables, who, on making default are presented by the inquest and compelled to <HI>appear</HI> to the presentment in the crown office and take a copy of it, which is attended with an expence of between 20 and 30 shillings, and <HI>here</HI> the proceedings uniformly stop. And, this is done every term, but surely without the privity of the Court of Kings Bench, which can never sanction so illegal and oppressive a con∣duct. No grand jury has the least power by law to require the attendance of a single person for any purpose whatever, even after it is sworn, and yet here is one which assumes that power even before it exists. The warrant is sent to the high constable, who is no officer of the Court of the Kings Bench, and has no business to obey it. And yet if any one thus irregularly called upon does not appear he will be subject to the above <HI>fine</HI> in the crown-office. For though the court would doubtless quash the presentment, yet the getting it quashed would cost him a great deal more: he is therefor obliged to submit to an unconstitu∣tional and oppressive measure, because the remedy is worse than the disease. See the warrant in the Complete Constable, 1725. p. 149. If it be necessary for the constables to make their pre∣sentments to the grand inquest, the court of Kings Bench should issue its writ for that purpose to the sheriff.</NOTE></P>

For if the constable of <HI>A.</HI> come into the vill of <HI>B.</HI> to suppress any disorder, and in the tumult be killed, this is only manslaughter, because he had no authority in <HI>B.</HI> 1. <HI>Hale P. C.</HI> 459. The constable of St. Margarets parish in Westminster, having a search warrant directed to the consta∣bles of that parish, came into the parish of St. Paul, Covent-Garden, and took a woman in the street near the theatre, and carried her to the round-house; where he was assaulted and killed by some who wanted to rescue her; and this killing ad∣judged only manslaughter: 1. Because it was a sudden action without precedent malice. 2. Because the constable had no au∣thority at all in Covent-Garden; nor, supposing he had any, was the woman guilty of any disorderly act; and it is not a constables suspecting that will justify his taking up any person, but it must be just grounds of suspicion; and it would be hard that the liberty of the subject should depend on the will of the constable, or his not liking a womans looks be any cause of suspicion. 3. The prisoners had a sufficient provocation; for it one be imprisoned upon an unlawful authority, it is a suffi∣cient provocation to all people out of compassion, much more when it is done under a colour of justice; and WHERE THE LIBERTY OF THE SUBJECT IS INVADED, IT IS A PROVOCATION TO ALL THE SUBJECTS IN ENG∣LAND. (By HOLT, C. J.) 2 L. Ray. 1300, 1301.</P>
<P>There are other instances of a constable, or his assistant, being killed, where he has been too officiously or imprudently, because ignorantly acting as such, and exercising an authority not given him by law; which of course will in such case afford him no more protection than a common man. See the trial of Wil∣liam Power for the wilful murder of John Wilkinson, Sessions paper, 1788-9. p. 820, where Gould, J. having consulted two of his brethren, in directing the jury, said, <Q>the thing being over, it was unwarrantable in these people to seize this man thus quiet, without having an authority from a justice of peace; he was therefore illegally assaulted and arrested by these men: when a man therefore is deprived of his liberty, and does an act that causes the death of the assailant in any manner whatever, certainly by law it reduces the offence to manslaughter:</Q> and so of course the jury found. The de∣ceased had sent for the constable, and given him charge of the prisoner, for having drawn a knife on him twice, and threaten∣ing his life, and in helping the constable to force him away, was unfortunately stabbed. See also Leaches Cases in Crown Law, 211. These little accidents should operate to make every con∣stable more familiar with his actual powers, which, wherever there may be danger, he ought always, for his greater security, to execute with sufficient assistance or properly armed; since the hanging of his <HI>murderer</HI> (though it be all the law can do) will hardly restore him to life, or recompence his family for his loss; let him therefor learn to protect himself; and let others, also, when he is usurping an illegal authority, be taught to protect themselves against him.</P>
<P>At present, by 29 G. 2. c. 25. the Westminster consta∣bles are to be appointed out of the different parishes, for the whole city and liberty. In London, also, by ancient custom, the constables, though appointed in particular wards (of which there are twenty-six) have power to serve warrants and execute their office throughout the city.</P></NOTE>.</P>

Bullers N. P. 24. And although this act may afford the constable protection in a civil suit, yet if the warrant be plainly illegal, as, for instance, to apprehend a man for <HI>adultery</HI> or <HI>incest,</HI> it seems the party may legally resist, and if in defence of his li∣berty he kill the constable, such killing is not murder; but if on the other hand the constable should kill him, he shall be ad∣judged guilty of murder.</P>
<P>☞ Of the above description, perhaps, are the warrants put into the hands of an uninformed constable, who sup∣poses every thing to be legal which comes from a justice of peace, who may possibly at the same time be as ignorant as himself, for the searching after and IMPRESSING OF SEA∣MEN; a practice in direct violation of every constitutional princi∣ple, and certainly unsupported by any positive law. Let the constable therefor who too officiously engages in a business so de∣servedly unpopular, seriously reflect of the risk he runs; let him dread the consequences of a spirited resistance. He murders if he kill; it is justifiable homicide, or at most manslaughter, if he be killed. The law, very properly, encourages and invites all men to repress an act of illegality and violence, and the rather, as we have just seen, if it be done under colour of justice. See the case already cited in Lord Raymonds Reports; and that of Hop∣kins Hugget, in Sir John Kelyngs: Cases of much greater consequence and authority than the flimsy reasoning used in de∣fence of press-warrants. Observe also what is said by Lord Hale on this subject, in his History of the Pleas of the Crown; and consider whether the life, liberty, and happiness of the subject are to be blown away by an insidious side-winded act of parlia∣ment. It is no place here to enter into a discussion of the arguments used by Sir Michael Forster and Mr. Butler on this subject, which, however, might be easily refuted upon the most solid and legal, as well as constitutional, principles.

"This vice, which is a scandal to a christian country, a due exer∣tion of your office might prove the means of checking, and by degrees that reformation may be produced by the fear of punish∣ment, which the commands of the Supreme Being, alas! are too weak to effect."—Alas! and if a man were to stand cursing and swearing for a day together, who (except himself) would be the worse for it? If the Supreme Being have prohibited this practice (which remains to be proved) he will undoubtedly adapt a fit punishment to it in another state. The only object of criminal law is to prevent offences injurious to a society; a description within which a few ridiculous and insensible phrases can never fall.

<P>IT was originally intended that the compilers publica∣tion on the subject here treated of should have comprised all that, to his knowlege, had been said, or in his judge∣ment, could be said, upon it. Large collections were made for the purpose, and the work partly proceeded in; but the bulk of the volume, and the scanty sale it was likely to experience, effectually discouraged him from proceeding with that plan, and produced the Introduction and Analysis now presented to the public.</P>

<PB REF="89"/>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>TO the concise view attempted in the following pages of the jurisdiction of the Court Leet it may not be improper to prefix a few words upon the name, antiquity, nature, and present state of this ancient and venerable tribunal.</P>
<P N="1">I. The name or stile of this court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NAME.</NOTE> as formally entered in its own proceedings, is the "Court Leet and View of Frankpledge." The word <HI>Leet,</HI>—which, it is very remarkable, is to be found neither in the Saxon law, nor in Glanvil, Bracton, Britton, Fleta, or the Mirror, our most ancient law writers, nor in any statute prior to the 27th year of King Ed. III.<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">C. 28. After which it does not appear again till the 4 E. 4. c. 1. See also 12 E. 4. c. 9.</NOTE> though it is allowed to occur in the Conquerors charter for the foundation of Battle Abbey, and not unfrequently in Domesday book<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">Spelmans Glossary, <HI>v. Leta.</HI></NOTE>,—seems to be derived from the Saxon leoð <HI>plebs;</HI> and to mean the <HI>populi curia,</HI> or folk mote, as the Sheriffs tourn or Leet of the county (at least) appears to have been once actually called<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">Spelman, <HI>v.</HI> Folkesmote. Kennets Parochial Antiquities, Glos. <HI>v.</HI> Falmote.</NOTE>; in contra∣distinction, perhaps, to the Halmote or Court Baron,
<PB N="vi" REF="90"/>which consisted of the free tenants only, who, being few in number, might conveniently assemble in the Lords Hall; whereas the Leet, which required the attendance of all the refiants, and concerned the administration of public justice, was, as there will be hereafter occasion to mention, usually held in the open air. The "view of Frankpledge," <HI>visus franciplegii,</HI> means the examination or survey of the freepledges, of which every man, not particularly privileged, was anciently obliged to have nine, who were bound that he should be always forth∣coming to answer any complaint. The better to under∣stand this we are to be informed that the kingdom being divided into countys or shires, and each county into hundreds, and each hundred into tithings, each tithing containing ten families or households, the heads of these families were reciprocally bound and responsible for each other; so that, in fact, of every ten householders through∣out the kingdom each man had nine pledges or sureties for his good behaviour<NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot">Of these pledges the eldest, or most respectable, and first sworn, was called the headborough or chief pledge, and had a degree of authority over the rest, not now exactly ascertained. It was, however, in all probabi∣lity, much the same with that of the constable, who was formerly a character of great consequence, and is to this day in many places called the <HI>headborough,</HI> a word, which, according to Sir William Blackstone, (too implicitly following Sir Thomas Smith) bespeaks its own etymology, and means "the discreetest person in the <HI>borough.</HI>" Great lawyers, how∣ever, are sometimes indifferent etymologists: the word, in fact, implys nothing more or less than the chief pledge, from borg, borh, or borhoe, <HI>fidejussor,</HI> a pledge or surety. He was also called the <HI>borsalder</HI> (borges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alder) (<HI>i. e.</HI> the eldest of the pledges, and the <HI>tithing man.</HI>) Both <HI>tithing man</HI> and <HI>borsholder</HI> are to be found in modern statutes as synonimous with <HI>constable</HI> and <HI>headborough.</HI> But at what period the constable became a distinct officer, and the chief pledges were metamorphosed into a grand jury, is a point which must be left to a more successful enquirer.</NOTE>. This is the famous system of King Alfred, so much applauded by both ancient and
<PB N="vii" REF="91"/>modern writers; which produced such singular effects among a barbarous and disorderly people, that a man might have hung his purse by the side of a public road, and found it untouched a month after; or might have ridden, with much treasure, and no other weapon than a white wand, from one end of the kingdom to the other<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">Ingulphus.

Since, however, this so excellent and admirable institution is, from whatever cause, sunk into total disuse, there not having been any freepledges in the kingdom for two or three centuries, the words "View of Frankpledge" in the stile of the court seem now altogether unnecessary and improper. It is also called a <HI>Lawday</HI><NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">32 H. 8. c. 13. 33 H. 8. cc. 6. 9. 2 &amp; 3 P. &amp; M. c. 8. 4 &amp; 5 P. &amp; M. c. 3. 18 Eliz. c. 10. 1 Ja. 1. c. 22. 21.

Shakspeare mentions the Leet, in another play, quoted below, p. 11. He had possibly served the office of an <HI>aletaster,</HI> at Stratford; or might indeed have got his information by attending the court when his father was <HI>Bailiff.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIQUITY.</NOTE> II. That the Leet is "the most ancient court in the land" (for criminal matters, that is, the Court Baron being of no less antiquity in civil) has been pronounced by the highest legal authority<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot">7 H, 6. 12, b. 1 Roll. R. 73.</NOTE>. For though we do not meet with the <HI>word</HI> among the Saxons, there can be no doubt of the existence of the <HI>thing.</HI> The venerable chief justice who lately retired from the elevated situation
<PB N="viii" REF="92"/>in which he had so long presided found this court "coeval with the establishment of the Saxons here," and its activity "marked very visibly both amongst the Saxons and the Danes<NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot">3 Bur. 1860.</NOTE>." In those times whoever possessed a vill or territory, with the liberties of <HI>soc, sac,</HI> &amp;c. (a long string of barbarous words) was the lord of a manor, had a court leet, court baron, and, in a word, every privilege which it seems to have been possible for the monarch to bestow, or for the subject to acquire<NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Spelman <HI>v. Manerium.</HI> The position used by Fineux in 12 H. 7. 15. that the Leet is derived out of the Sheriffs Tourn is not intitled to any particular notice, being a mere unsupported <HI>dictum;</HI> to which neither Lord Cokes adoption (2 Inst. 71.) nor that of Lord Mansfield, (3 Bur. 1860.) can add any weight. Much matter and many authorities must be sacrificed throughout this little enquiry for the sake of brevity. As to the rest, the word Leet, though generally appropriated to the court of a manor, has in fact nothing essentially distinct from the Tourn, but the being upon a smaller scale. (See, however, Britton. c. 29. 44 E. 3. 9. 1 E. 4. c. 2.) Those writers therefor who suppose the Leet of a hundred or manor inferior to or subject to the controul of the Tourn or Leet of the County are egregiously mistaken: the jurisdiction of the latter being con∣fined to so much of the county or hundred as is not comprised within the precinct of the manor. See 4 Inst. 261: It is indeed repeatedly said in our old books that things of which the Leet (of a manor, that is) omits to enquire shall be enquired of in the Tourn: which may well be; and the reason is that the lord has forfeited his leet for the time, <HI>quoad</HI> the parti∣cular object: it being very clear that, when the Leet of a manor is by any means lost the resiants owe suit to the tourn, and that although they should be within a hundred in the hands of a private person.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATURE.</NOTE> The Leet is a court of record for the cognisance of criminal matters, or pleas of the crown, and necessarily belongs to the King; though a subject, usually the Lord of a Manor, may be and is entitled to the profits, consisting of the essoign pence, fines and amerciaments. It is held before the Steward, (or was, in ancient times, before
<PB N="ix" REF="93"/>the Bailiff)<NOTE N="(10)" PLACE="foot">Mirror, <HI>passim.</HI> Finch's Law. 248. See also Kennets P.

In one instance, at least, he has even more; for, if he should be in want of jurors, he may compel a stranger who is riding along the highway to alight and be sworn<NOTE N="(17)" PLACE="foot">Br. Leete. 14. 24. This power must, however, be confined to those courts in which it is the usage to swear and discharge the Jury in the course of the day, as the stranger is supposed to have no opportunity of marching off.</NOTE>; which, it is conceived, the Lord Chief Justice of England, in all the plenitude of his authority, cannot do. It is held sometimes once, some∣times thrice, but, most commonly, twice in the year; that is, within a month after Easter, and a month after Michaelmas<NOTE N="(18)" PLACE="foot">See Magna Charta. c. 35.

As to the place in which it is held, that, it has been said, may be any where within the precinct<NOTE N="(19)" PLACE="foot">8 H. 7. 3. Br. Court Baron 8. Owen 35.</NOTE>; but, more
<PB N="x" REF="94"/>strictly speaking, ought to be certain and accustomed<NOTE N="(20)" PLACE="foot">Rastalls Entries. 151.</NOTE>. Formerly, either for the convenience of the suitors, or from an excellent principle of the common law, that courts of justice should be as public as possible, if used to be held in the open air, upon a fair green, on the side of a hill, or under a large tree<NOTE N="(21)" PLACE="foot">Spelman <HI>v. Mallobergium.</HI> Kennets Parochial Antiquities Glos. <HI>v. Franciplegium.</HI> It is a curious illustration of the above principle that the Justices itinerant in the time of Edward the first, sat at the stone cross (opposite the Bishop of Worcesters house, now Somerset Place) in the Strand. This venerable monument, which was even then ancient (Pat. 4 E. 2. pl. 2. m. 15. d.) is mentioned by Stow as standing headless in 1598. The Justices, probably in bad weather, sometimes sat in the bishops house; as the Steward or Bailiff of a Leet would for the same reason occasionally do in the church, where, notwithstanding a canon (1 Burn E. L. 361) it is in many places still held.</NOTE>. All persons above the age of twelve years, except peers, clerks, women, and aliens, resiant within the district, whether masters or servants, owe personal suit and attendance to this court, and ought to be here sworn to their fealty and allegiance<NOTE N="(22)" PLACE="foot">52 H. 3. c. 10. 2 Inst. 120. 121.

The general jurisdiction of the court will appear form the following pages to extend to all crimes, offences and misdemeanors at the common law, as well as to several others which have been subjected to it by
<PB N="xi" REF="95"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct of parliament<NOTE N="(25)" PLACE="foot">In general it will be found that the objects of this jurisdiction are the best part of our criminal jurisprudence; most of them abiding the test to which all prohibited or punishable acts should be submitted—the in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury of society:—a manifest proof of the superior excellence of the common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw!

<PB N="xiv" REF="98"/>extant of the criminal part of the constitution. Before the conquest, and probably for some time after, this court of the Leet was, if not the sole, at least the most usual dispensary of criminal justice in the kingdom. No crime, in those remote ages, appears to have been punished by death, unless it were that of open theft, where the offender was taken with the <HI>mainour,</HI> that is, with the thing stolen upon him;—and of this crime, and this only, the cogni∣sance did not belong to the Leet<NOTE N="(36)" PLACE="foot">The elucidation of this circumstance would form a curious if not an interesting article; but could not be easily compressed within the com∣pass of a note; and, in fact, belongs more properly to a different work.</NOTE> All other offences, of what nature or degree soever, subjected the party to a mulct or pecuniary fine, which was, in many cases, de∣terminate and fixed.

<P>It has been said by Sir Edward Coke, and repeated by the noble judge already mentioned, that, by the clause <HI>Nullus vicecomes,</HI> &amp;c. in the Great Charter<NOTE N="(42)" PLACE="foot">No Sheriff, Constable, Coroner, or other <HI>our</HI> Bailiffs, shall hold pleas of our crown. c. 17.

In short, it is very well known that both Sheriff and Coroner have held pleas of the crown ever since the granting of the great charter, and do so at this day. It appears, however, from Glanville, that the crime of theft, at that time, belonged wholly to the Sheriff, and was to be pleaded and determined in the <HI>county court.</HI> And that he had also cognisance of medleys (or affrays), batteries, and wounds, unless where the addition was made, of the Kings peace broken. (l. 1. c. 1. l. 4. c. 8.) These, therefor, one might think, were the plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the crown taken away by <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> that is, the criminal jurisdiction of the county court; if it did not appear both from Fleta (l. 1. c. 47.) and Hengham (Magna, c. 2.) that such sort of pleas were still held by the Sheriff. In any case it is nothing to the Leet.</NOTE>, "the
<PB N="xvii" REF="101"/>jurisdiction of the Leet was abridged, its power to hear and determine taken away;" but it has been said and repeated without due attention either to the nature and constitution of the Court, or to the law of the time. No offence, it is well known, is at this day, or, for aught that appears, ever was, heard and determined in the Leet,—nor, before the period refered to, by any other criminal court in the kingdom,—otherwise than upon the presentment of twelve men,—or what we now, in most courts, call the Grand Jury. This presentment, as has been already observed, found and established the fact; and judgement, whether of <HI>misericordia,</HI> mutilation or death, followed as an incident or matter of course, precisely, indeed, as the punishment does at this day on the ver∣dict for the king of the petty jury. In fact, therefor, the jurisdiction of the Leet was not in the least abridged or affected by that charter; nor is it at all probable that the Barons would either seek or suffer the diminution of their own privileges, of which, on the contrary, there is an express saving.</P>
<P>That this court has no power to enquire of the death of a man, or of rape<NOTE N="(43)" PLACE="foot">Lete &amp; Hundr. 10 Br. Leete 22.</NOTE>, is a more ancient, but not less erroneous, opinion. The contrary is most directly and expressly held in the <HI>Statutum Walliae,</HI> in Britton, Fleta, the Mirror, and the statute (or whatever it is) of 18 Ed. 2. all much older and better authorities than the book of Assises<NOTE N="(44)" PLACE="foot">41 E. 3. pl. 30. A doubt is suggested in 9 H. 6. 44. whether the Leet can enquire of high treason, and an opinion given in Br. Ley Gager. 99. against its power; but this, as my lord Coke observes on a similar occasion, happened "for want of the knowlege of antiquity." See 2 Inst. 72. It is a no less extraordinary <HI>dictum</HI> in Dyer, 233, b. that an indict∣ment of assault and battery found in the Leet, <HI>without blood shed,</HI> is void; the principal case being a <HI>fine</HI> for an assault, <HI>in disturbance and contempt of the Court.</HI> He might possibly allude to the book case of 8 E. 4. 5. which by no means supports his doctrine; as the plaintiff, whose counsel makes that allegation, took nothing by his writ.</NOTE>, in which that opinion first appears. If, in∣deed,
<PB N="xviii" REF="102"/>the reason of the exception be that the enquiry of these two crimes belonged properly to the Coroner, it may be readily admitted without impeaching the jurisdic∣tion of the Leet. The Coroner took cognisance of death <HI>super visum corporis,</HI> and of rape, as well as other offences, by appeal only. It follows, therefor, that in every in∣stance, either where he could not, or did not, act, the enquiry must be in the Leet, otherwise the offender should have escaped without punishment, which would be absurd. They who suppose Rape, as a <HI>felony,</HI> to be excepted, be∣cause it has been made so by act of parliament, and allow it to be enquired of as a trespass<NOTE N="(45)" PLACE="foot">Tourne de Viscount. 5.

If indeed the statute of W. 1. operated a an alteration of the common law, and was not virtually repealed by that of W. 2.

<P>It is indeed unaccountable how such groundless assertions come to be made. There is no point better settled than that the Steward of a Leet may award to prison persons either indicted, or accused, of felony, before him, or

Possibly, however, lord Coke meant to con∣fine the disability of imprisoning to offences presented and punishable in the Leet; which (except in the case of bakers, &amp;c.) can only be punished by amerciament: The reason whereof is, that this Court was established long before imprisonment was adopted as a mode of punishment. And, indeed, how far any other court was authorised to inflict it, by the com∣mon law, might have been once a question.</NOTE>. These errors are, pro∣bably, owing to the imperfect knowlege judges and law∣yers are content to acquire upon certain uprofitable sub∣jects. "From Magna Charta, to this time," says the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate illustrious chief, Courts Leet "have been <HI>always abridged, never enlarged</HI><NOTE N="(51)" PLACE="foot">3 Burr. 1864.</NOTE>."

<P N="4"><NOTE PLACE="marg">PRESENT STATE.</NOTE> IV. Though the Leet, from being principal cri∣minal court in the kingdom, is now considered as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owest, the greater part of its business having been trans∣fered to other more extended jurisdictions, yet it must not be supposed that the power and authority of the court is thereby diminished and gone. On the contrary, there is no offence which it ever did or could enquire of and
<PB N="xx" REF="104"/>punish, which it may not equally enquire of and punish at this day. That the tourn and the leet have been so long in a declining way is not, however, at all owing to the cause refered to by a learned writer<NOTE N="(53)" PLACE="foot">4 Black. Com. 274.</NOTE>, <HI>i. e.</HI> the dis∣charge granted by the statute of Marlbridge (in which, by the way, the Leet is not mentioned) to all prelates, peers, and clergymen, from their attendance on these courts; since the county court and court baron, which they are still com∣pellable to attend (at least by attorney), are scarcely in a more flourishing condition. Neither is it perfectly clear that "experience has shewn the wisdom of widening the circle of both civil and criminal jurisdiction"<NOTE N="(54)" PLACE="foot">3 Burr. 1864.</NOTE>. Changes may be for the worse as well as for the better. True it is that the business of the Leet hath for the most part gra∣dually devolved upon the quarter sessions<NOTE N="(55)" PLACE="foot">4 Black. Com. 274.</NOTE>; but many reasons may be given for this circumstance much more plausible than those already mentioned. In the first place the increased population, and more commercial turn of the country, and the consequent increase of offenders and of∣fences, required the dispensaries of justice to be, if not always, at least frequently, open: whereas the Leet is seldom held more than twice, and sometimes but once, in the year; though it may certainly be kept open by ad∣journment from month to month, from week to week, or even from day to day. Secondly, the jurisdiction of this court is, upon whatever principle, confined to offences at the common law, which are become less numerous than those created by act of parliament. A third reason may be, the Steward of a Leet seldom resides upon the spot; justices of peace, on the contrary, are every where to be

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the books, rolls, and other muniments of the Savoy Court, anterior to the year 1683, are sup∣posed to have perished in private hands. But there is suf∣ficient evidence that the court has been regularly held ever since the accession of King Henry the Fourth, <HI>anno</HI> 1399; as, without doubt, it was long before that period; the Liberty being one of the oldest in the kingdom, and having been parcel of the possessions of the Duchy of Lancaster from the time of its first erection, and even the property of he Earls of that title for near a century before.</P>

<HEAD>Departing without Leave.</HEAD>
<P>E. C. 1696. John Ashley, for "apearing at this court, and in contemp[t] therof departing without lycence," fined<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The difference between a fine and amerciament is, that the former is the sole act of the court; the latter must be grounded upon the presentments of the jury, and must likewise be affeered, <HI>i. e.</HI> ascertained or reduced to certainty, by indifferent persons sworn for that purpose, and who are generally, but not necessarily, taken out of the jury (See E. C. 1754 and 1772, instances of the affeerers not being jurymen). It seems requisite however that they should be ac∣quainted with the nature of the offence in respect whereof the amercia∣ment is imposed. A fine on the contrary needs no affeerment, being imposed by the steward as judge, for offences committed within his own view, or the defaults of the officers of the court. A fine on an officer is likewise called an amerciament or amerciament royal, but does not on that account require any affeering. Unless, therefor, John Ashley was in office, this fine was illegal.</P>
<P>Till the year 1787, (M. C.) the amerciaments were always set by the jury in their presentments, at an express sum, which was afterward affeered. But this practice, being thought irregular, was then altered, upon due deliberation and good advice; so that then and thencefor∣ward the amerciament was and has been set by the court indefinitely, "and therefor he is amerced," answering to the <HI>Ideo ipse in misericordia</HI> of the old precedents; and afterward affeered at a precise sum. It should be noticed, however, that some instances have been since discovered where an amerciament is set upon the presentments of the aleconners, &amp;c. in the very language now adopted, "and therefore he is amerced;" which may induce one to believe that it is but a re∣storation of the ancient practice.

In 1719, it appears the constables kept their watch "in St. Clements church house, to the great damage of the same."</NOTE> —and, in order to remedy this great complaint
<PB N="39" REF="191"/>we haue bin carefull to find out a fitt and proper place which we hope will meet with your approbation—the place is at the east end of the new church in the Strand, we have had the ground measured, and find that there is full roome without aney hinderance to aney of the neigh∣burhood—and we humbly hope you will give orders for the building of a watch house in that place, which will be of great service to the liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A watch-house was soon afterward erected by the burgesses at the <HI>west</HI> end of the New Church, which stood till the year 1780, when (being looked upon as an unsightly object) by virtue of an order of the Duchy court, and with the consent of the burgesses, it was taken down, and, by leave of the rector and churchwardens, a new one erected between the piers of the great entrance to the church, by sir William Chambers, at the expence of government.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>THE BOUNDS OF THE LIBERTY OF THE SAVOY.</HEAD>
<P>FROM THE PLAN OR SURVEY TAKEN THEREOF, BY VIRTUE OF A COMMISSION OUT OF THE DUCHY COURT, IN THE YEAR 1740.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"And the said jurors, upon their oaths aforesaid, do further say and present, That in a certain schedule to this inquisition annexed, comprised in one skin of vellum, intitled the Second Schedule, is con∣tained a true and exact map, plan, and description of the said lordship or manor of the Savoy, and of the liberty and franchise of the Duchy of Lancaster, called the Savoy Liberty, as the same did ap∣pear to the said jurors on a view thereof, and as the same hath been surveyed and admeasured, duly proved on oath, and given in evidence on this inquisition by John Rockque, a skilful surveyor, and which was conformable to the said jurors knowlege and remem∣brance of the known meats and bounds thereof, save and except towards the west end of the said manor and liberty, from the middle of a street called Cecil Street to the middle of a lane, way, or passage called Ivy Lane, which hath of late years been disused, and not claimed as part of the said liberty, but why or for what reason the said jurors know not."</P>
<P>A copy or duplicate of this plan is in the jury room in the Court House.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>This liberty is divided into four wards, viz. Royal-Ward, Middle-Ward, Savoy-Ward, and Church-Ward.</P>
<P>The ROYAL-WARD 'lyes' on the east end of the liber∣ty, beginning at the south-west corner of Temple-Bar, and
<PB N="43" REF="195"/>from thence 'goeth' along by the wall of the Middle Temple on the south, and from thence 'extending' west∣ward, and thence again towards the south, as the said wall goes along to the river, passing by a boundary stone with the mark of an anchor thereon, till it falls into the River of Thames, and from thence 'extending' along by the said river westward by several wharfs on the bank of the said river till it comes to Milford Lane, and thence northward up the middle of the said lane, comprehending the buildings on the east side thereof, till it shoots out into the Strand, and from thence stretching over towards the north-west till it comes to the south-west corner of Saint Clements Church, and from thence passing by the west door of the said church till it comes by the corner of a row of houses on the north side of the church-yard, comprehending the said houses, and going though a passage there to the middle of a street 'called the Backside of' St. Clements, and from thence extending eastward through the middle of Butcher Row by the kennel there till it comes opposite to the Ship Tavern, just beyond the east end of the Butcher Row, and from thence crossing over the way, as the kennel now goes, to the southward, opposite to Cross Keys Court, till it comes to the kennel next without the footway there, and from thence going eastward to Temple-Bar, where it first began.</P>
<P>The MIDDLE-WARD . . . begins at the kennel on the north side of the Strand, without the footway there, opposite to Milford Lane, and from thence extending down by the middle of the said lane to the River Thames, being bound∣ed all the way on the east side by the Royal<SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ard before described, and extending from the bottom of Milford Lane
<PB N="44" REF="196"/>all along by the River Thames, as the said river runs to∣wards the north-west, till it comes to Strand Bridge Stairs, including the same, and from thence turning northward up Strand Bridge Lane, by the wall of Somerset House garden and Somerset House, the boundary towards the west, till it comes into that part of the highway called the Strand, where the kennel runs without the footway on the north side of the said highway, and then turning east∣ward from that part of the said kennel which is opposite to the north-east corner of the front buildings in Somerset House, all long by the said kennel, till it comes opposite to Milford Lane, where the boundary first began.</P>
<P>The SAVOY-WARD . . . begins at the north-east cor∣ner of the buildings in the front of Somerset House in the Strand, and from thence extending by the wall or boundary of Somerset House and garden to the River of Thames, be∣ing bounded all the way on the east side of the Middle-Ward before described, until it comes to Strand Bridge, and from thence extending all along by the River of Thames, as the said river runs to the north-west, till it comes to a stone marked with an anchor in the wall next the river at the bottom of Cecil Street, <HI>and from thence extending in the same manner till it comes to Ivy Bridge, and from thence comprehending the said bridge, turning northward all along by Durham Yard, within the liberty of Westminster, the boundary towards the west end of the Duchy Liberty, till it comes into the middle of the high street called the Strand, comprehending the buildings described in the . . map to be the ancient scite of Salisbury House, and from the middle of the high street, opposite to Ivy Bridge</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>And the said jurors, on their oaths aforesaid, do further say and present, that it appears to them by authentic copiers of two several surveys of the sand man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> or liberty duly proved and given in evidence on this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quisition (that is to say) one a copy of a survey or return of a commission under seal of the said Duchy of Lancaster, and remaining of record in the Duchy Office for bounding her then ma∣jesty's manor of the Savoy, beating date the sixth day of February, in the forty-fourth year of the reign of queen Elizabeth; and the other a copy of a survey taken by ordinance of parliament in the year 1653, remaining of record in the Augmentation office, that the bounds of the said manor, liberty, or franchise, at the respective times of taking the said several surveys, did extend towards the west to the middle of Ivy Lane opposite to Ivy Bridge; and therefore the said jurors, no contrary evidence having been given to them, on their oaths aforesaid, do say and present, that the boundary of the said manor and liberty ought not to terminate to the westward at the middle of Cecil Street, but ought to extend opposite the middle of Ivy Lane aforesaid, according to the surveys aforesaid, and as in the map or plan herein before mentioned is expressed and declared."</P>
<P>This inquisition is, in many respects, an admirable record, and the plan very accurately and neatly delineated. The jurors, however, were undoubtedly misled by the survey of 44 Eliz. for in fact there is no mention of Ivy Lane in that of 1653. Whether there were any blame in not enquiring more minutely into a matter so important as evey this is which men have to deliver upon oath as a guide to posterity, and upon whom it ought to fall, we cannot well say. But the reason and cause of this serious mistake was in truth as follows: Soon after the 44th Eliz. which was the year 1602, being the last of her reign, the ancient lane called Ivy Lane or Ivy Bridge Lane, was by virtue of a grant under the Duchy seal and of a writ of <HI>ad quod dumnam,</HI> and an inquisition thereon, taken away or blocked up by Sir Robert Cecil, afterward Earl of Salisbury, who, in lieu thereof, opened a new lane or passage from the Strand to the river on the west side of his house, which retained the old name of Ivy Lane, as a bridge at the bottom of it did that of Ivy Bridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ancient bridge was of a very different nature. Both Ivy Lane and Strand Lane were originally low subterraneous passages, somewhat resembling, it is thought, the present arched cart-ways to the Adelphi wharfs; the bridges themselves being in the high street. <HI>Vide</HI> Stows Survey by Strype, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. ic. c. 7. It is wonderful that the translation of Ivy Lane should have escaped the re∣searches of this industrious edito<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e works was originally published in 1598.</NOTE> This proceeding, which was confirmed by a private act of parliament in the 3d year of K. James I. could not however affect the boundary of the liberty; and as the middle of Cecil Street has, ever since it was made, been looked upon and perambulated as the west boundary, it seems highly probable that the middle of this street is the identical ground which at the time of taking the survey of the 44th Eliz. was the middle of Ivy Lane. Instead therefore of the words in italies, we ought to read the following:—<HI>and from thence turning directly northward up the middle of Cecil Street, the boundary towards the west end of the Duchy liberty, till it comes into the middle of the high street called the Strand, and from the middle of the high street, opposite to the middle of Cecil Street.</HI></P></NOTE>
extending eastward till
<PB N="45" REF="197"/>it comes opposite to the middle of Burleigh Street near Exeter Change, and from thence extending up the middle of Burleigh Street till it comes to a corner extending
<PB N="46" REF="198"/>towards the north-east to the corner of a building about eighty foot in length, near which is placed in the front the mark of an anchor, and from thence going on by the ancient scite of Burleigh House, on the north-east side thereof, till it comes to the north side of a house fifty-five foot distant from the front thereof, now in the Strand, in the possession of Mrs. Nicholson, pewterer, and from thence proceeding on to the kennel on the north side of the Strand next without the footway there, eighteen foot or thereabouts distant from the front buildings there, and from thence extending to the eastward along by the said kennel, leaving the church of Saint Mary le Strand on the south, till it comes a little beyond the east end of the said church, and from thence stretching over as the said kennel in part goes to the middle of the highway called the Strand, opposite to the north-east corner of the front buildings of Somerset House on the north-west end of Strand Bridge Lane, where the boundary first began.</P>
<P>The CHURCH-WARD... begins a small distance from the end of Holywell Street, and from thence extending southward to the highway called the Strand till it comes to the boundary of the Middle Ward, almost opposite to Strand Bridge Lane, being bounded towards the west by part of the end of the Savoy Ward before described, and from thence extending eastward along the said highway called the Strand, being bounded towards the south by the Middle Ward before described, till it comes almost op∣posite to the end of Milford Lane, and from thence stretching northward and north-eastward, near the corner of Saint Clements Church, being bounded towards the east by the Royal Ward before described, and going through the passage from Saint Clements Church-yard, near the said church, till it falls into the kennel in the middle of the said street, called the Backside of Saint Clements, and from thence extending towards the west all along by the kennel in the middle of Holywell Street, comprehending the buildings on the south side of the said street, till it falls into a cross kennel towards the west end of the said street, where the boundary first began.</P>
