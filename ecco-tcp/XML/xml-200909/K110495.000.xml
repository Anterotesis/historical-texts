<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Writer of this volume could not, for very obvious reasons, entertain the most distant inten∣tion of standing forth the professed Biographer of LIN∣NAEUS, he wishes to preclude any undue expectations, by observing that, the few memoirs relating to the life of this celebrated Professor, which will be found inter∣spersed in the first part of this <HI>View,</HI> were almost wholly collected from LINNAEUS'S own writings, and other printed works; and serve, principally, to relieve the tediousness of a bare account of books, and to connect in a better man∣ner the series and occasion of his publications. He re∣grets that his sources of intelligence have not been suf∣ficiently copious to enable him to render these memoirs more equal to his wishes, and more worthy the accept∣ance of the public. To those who are conversant with the works of LINNAEUS, he is perfectly aware that these pages can afford but little amusement and still less in∣formation, and can have no merit in their eye, beyond that of recalling to their remembrance, a succession of facts and observations, with which they were before ac∣quainted. They will, however, concur with him in wishing to diffuse the knowledge of the writings of so great a master, and in endeavouring to excite an emula∣tion in younger minds, for that science which they cul∣tivate.</P>
<P>All the works of LINNAEUS, as far as they have come to the Author's knowledge, are noticed in the succeeding pages; but, as most of them were subservient to his great object the SYSTEM <HI>of</HI> NATURE, the <HI>outlines</HI> of that work bear a principal part in this <HI>View</HI> of his writings.</P>
<P>The CLASSIFICATION <HI>of</HI> DISEASES, is but a small part of his works; yet, as LINNAEUS was an early writer
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
on that subject, which has since excited the attention of many physicians, and is at this day not sufficiently dis∣cussed, it hath therefore been exhibited more largely than many of his other writings.</P>
<P>The AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE, although strictly speaking they are not LINNAEUS'S own works, have yet so large a share of his authority stamped upon them, are so intimately connected with his writings, and, it is pre∣sumed, are so much less known than they deserve to be, that it was judged proper to give a <HI>brief</HI> account of the <HI>whole</HI> collection.</P>
<P>The PAN SUECUS having been first presented to the <HI>English</HI> reader several years ago, by the Author of this vo∣lume, in a periodical publication, is here subjoined, with additional observations, and some improvements in the general arrangement of the tables.</P>
<P>Few or no criticisms on the <HI>Linnaean</HI> system will be found in these pages. No system yet invented can stand a rigorous examination through all its parts, and LIN∣NAEUS was, perhaps, better acquainted than any other man with the defects of his own. The study of nature on scientific principles, notwithstanding the manifold improvements of later years, may yet justly be considered as in its infancy, and all arrangements hitherto proposed, have, in their turns, given way to others. At present the system of LINNAEUS possesses the advantage of a gene∣ral superiority in the public approbation: how long it may enjoy this pre-eminence, time only can discover: in the mean while, it would be a more agreeable employ∣ment, to endeavour to strengthen its basis, supply its de∣ficiences, and candidly correct its errors, than to <HI>object</HI> to those anomalies and imperfections, which will most likely be ever inseparable from <HI>artificial</HI> arrangements; and as to <HI>natural</HI> method, it is as yet so far unknown, that, in the <HI>vegetable</HI> kingdom Botanists themselves are not agreed on what principles it ought to be established.</P>

<HEAD>A GENERAL VIEW OF THE WRITINGS OF THE LATE CELEBRATED LINNAEUS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES VON LINNÈ, the son of a <HI>Swedish</HI> divine, was born May 24, 1707, at <HI>Roeshult,</HI> in the province of <HI>Smaland,</HI> in <HI>Sweden;</HI> of which place his father had the cure, when this son was born, but was soon after preferred to the living of <HI>Stenbrihult,</HI> in the same province, where dying in 1748, at the age of 70, he was succeeded in his cure by another son. We are told, in the commemoration-speech on this celebrated man, de∣livered in his <HI>Swedish</HI> majesty's presence, before the royal academy of sciences at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> that the ancestors of this family took their sirnames of LINNAEUS, <HI>Lindelius,</HI> and <HI>Tiliander,</HI> from a large <HI>lime-tree,</HI> or <HI>linden-tree,</HI> yet standing on the farm where <HI>Linnaeus</HI> was born; and that this origin of sirnames, taken from natural objects, is not very uncommon in <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7"/>
This eminent man, whose talents enabled him to reform the whole science of natural history, ac∣cumulated, very early in life, some of the highest honours that await the most successful proficients in medical science; since we find that he was made <HI>professor</HI> of <HI>physic</HI> and <HI>botany,</HI> in the university of <HI>Upsal,</HI> at the age of 34; and six years afterwards, physician to his sovereign, the late king <HI>Adolphus;</HI> who in the year 1753 honoured him still farther, by creating him knight of the order of the <HI>Polar Star.</HI> His honours did not terminate here, for in 1757 he was ennobled; and in 1776 the present king of <HI>Sweden</HI> accepted the resignation of his office, and rewarded his declining years by dou∣bling his pension, and by a liberal donation of landed property, settled on him and his family.</P>
<P>It seems probable, that his father's example first gave <HI>Linnaeus</HI> a taste for the study of nature; who, as he has himself informed us, cultivated, as his first amusement, a garden plentifully stored with plants. Young <HI>Linnaeus</HI> soon became acquainted with these, as well as the indigenous ones of his neighbourhood. Yet, from the straightness of his father's income, our young naturalist was on the point of being destined to a mechanical employ∣ment: fortunately, however, this design was over∣ruled. In 1717 he was sent to school at <HI>Wexsio,</HI> where, as his opportunities were enlarged, his progress in all his favourite pursuits was propor∣tionably extended. At this early period he paid attention to other branches of natural history; par∣ticularly to the knowledge of insects: in which, as is manifest from his <HI>oration</HI> on the subject, he must
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
very early have made a great proficiency, since we find that he was not less successful herein, than in that of plants, having given them an arrangement, and established such characters of distinction, as have been universally followed by succeeding ento∣mologists.</P>
<P>The first part of his academical education, <HI>Lin∣naeus</HI> received under professor <HI>Stobaeus,</HI> at <HI>Lund,</HI> in <HI>Scania,</HI> who favoured his inclinations to the study of natural history. After a residence of about a year, he removed in 1728 to <HI>Upsal.</HI> Here he soon contracted a close friendship with <HI>Artedi,</HI> a native of the province of <HI>Angermannia,</HI> who had already been four years a student in that university, and, like himself, had a strong bent to the study of na∣tural history in general, but particularly to <HI>Ich∣thyology.</HI> He was moreover well skilled in chemistry, and not unacquainted with botany, having been the inventor of that distinction in <HI>umbelliferous</HI> plants, arising from the differences of the <HI>involucrum.</HI> Emulation is the soul of improvement, and, heigh∣tened as it was in this instance by friendship, proved a most powerful incentive. These young men prosecuted their studies together with uncom∣mon vigor, mutually communicating their observa∣tions, and laying their plans, so as to assist each other in every branch of natural history and physic.</P>
<P>Soon after his residence at <HI>Upsal,</HI> our author was also happy enough to obtain the favour of several gentlemen of established character in litera∣ture. He was in a particular manner encouraged in the pursuit of his studies by the patronage of
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
Dr. <HI>Olaus Celsius,</HI> at that time professor of divinity, and the restorer of natural history in <HI>Sweden;</HI> since so distinguished for oriental learning, and more particularly for his <HI>Hierobotanicon,</HI> or <HI>Critical Dis∣sertations on the Plants mentioned in Scripture.</HI> This gentleman is said to have given LINNAEUS a large share of his esteem, and he was fortunate enough to obtain it very early after his removal to <HI>Upsal.</HI> He was at that time meditating his <HI>Hierobotanicon,</HI> and being struck with the diligence of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> in describing the plants of the <HI>Upsal</HI> garden, and his extensive knowledge of their names, fortunately for him, at that time involved in difficulties, from the narrow circumstances of his parents, <HI>Celsius</HI> not only patronized him in a general way, but admitted him to his house, his table, and his library. Un∣der such encouragement, it is not strange that our author made a rapid progress, both in his studies, and the esteem of the professors: in fact, we have a very striking proof of his merit and attainments, inasmuch as we find, that after only two years re∣sidence, he was thought sufficiently qualified to give lectures occasionally from the botanic chair, in the room of professor <HI>Rudbeck.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1731, the royal academy of sciences at <HI>Upsal</HI> having for some time meditated the design of improving the natural history of <HI>Sweden,</HI> at the instance particularly of professors <HI>Celsius</HI> and <HI>Rud∣beck,</HI> deputed LINNAEUS to make the tour of <HI>Lap∣land,</HI> with the sole view of exploring the natural history of that arctic region; to which underta∣king, his reputation, already high as a naturalist, and the strength of his constitution, equally re∣commended
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
him. This tour had been made for the first time, with the same view, by the elder <HI>Rudbeck,</HI> in 1695, at the command of <HI>Charles</HI> XI; but unfortunately the whole fruit of that expedi∣tion, except two or three copies of the <HI>Campi Elysii,</HI> perished in the dreadful fire of <HI>Upsal,</HI> in 1702.</P>
<P>As this expedition could not take place till the succeeding summer, LINNAEUS spent his winter with his friends and relations in the south; and particu∣larly paid a visit, in January 1732, to his former preceptor <HI>Stobaeus,</HI> at <HI>Lund;</HI> whom he left in Fe∣bruary, to visit his native province of <HI>Smaland,</HI> and returned to <HI>Upsal</HI> about the middle of April, to prepare for his journey. He left <HI>Upsal</HI> the 13th of May, and took his route to <HI>Gevalia,</HI> or <HI>Gevels,</HI> the principal town of <HI>Gestricia,</HI> 45 miles distant from <HI>Upsal.</HI> Hence he travelled through <HI>Helsingland,</HI> into <HI>Medalpadia,</HI> where he made an excursion, and as∣cended a remarkable mountain, before he reached <HI>Hudwickswald,</HI> the chief town of <HI>Helsingland.</HI> From hence he went through <HI>Angermanland,</HI> to <HI>Hernosand,</HI> a sea-port on the <HI>Bothnic</HI> gulph, seventy miles dis∣tant from <HI>Hudwickswald.</HI> When he had proceeded thus far, he found it proper to retard his journey, as the spring was not sufficiently advanced; and took this opportunity of visiting those remarkable caverns on the summit of mount <HI>Skula,</HI> though at the hazard of his life.</P>
<P>When LINNAEUS arrived at <HI>Uma,</HI> in <HI>West Bothnia,</HI> about 96 miles from <HI>Hernosand,</HI> he quitted the public road, and took his course through the woods westward, in order first to traverse the most southern parts of <HI>Lapland.</HI> Being now come to
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
the country that was more particularly the object of his enquiries, equally a stranger to the language and to the manners of the people, and without any associate, he committed himself to the hospi∣tality of the inhabitants, and never failed to expe∣rience it fully. He speaks in several places, with peculiar satisfaction, of the innocence and simpli∣city of their lives, and their freedom from diseases. In this excursion, he reached the mountains to∣wards <HI>Norway,</HI> and, after encountering great hard∣ships, returned into <HI>West Bothnia,</HI> quite exhausted with fatigue. He seems to have been much struck with the singular use that the <HI>Laplanders</HI> make of the <HI>Pinguicula vulgaris,</HI> which we call <HI>Butterwort,</HI> or Yorkshire Sanicle: They receive the milk of the rein-deer upon the fresh leaves of this plant, which they immediately strain off, and set aside, till it becomes somewhat acescent, and the whole ac∣quires, in a day or two, a consistence equal to that of cream, without separating the serum; and by this method it becomes an agreeable food. When thus prepared, a small quantity of the same has the property of rennet, in producing the like change on fresh milk. But to return: Our tra∣veller next visited <HI>Pitha</HI> and <HI>Lula,</HI> upon the gulph of <HI>Bothnia,</HI> from which latter place he took again a western route, by proceeding up the river of that name, and visited the ruins of the temple of <HI>Jock∣mock,</HI> in <HI>Lula-Lapland</HI> or <HI>Lap-Mark;</HI> thence, he tra∣versed what is called the <HI>Lapland Desert,</HI> destitute of all villages, cultivation, roads, or any conve∣niences; inhabited only by a few straggling people, originally descended from the <HI>Finlanders,</HI> and who
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
settled in this country in remote ages, being en∣tirely a distinct people from the <HI>Laplanders.</HI> In this district he ascended a noted mountain called <HI>Wallevari,</HI> in speaking of which he has given us a pleasant relation of his finding a singular and beautiful new plant <HI>(Andromeda tetragona)</HI> when travelling within the arctic circle, with the sun in his view at midnight, in search of a <HI>Lapland</HI> hut. From hence he crossed the <HI>Lapland Alps</HI> into <HI>Finmark,</HI> and traverfed the shores of the North sea as far as <HI>Sallero.</HI></P>
<P>These journies from <HI>Lula</HI> and <HI>Pitha,</HI> on the <HI>Bothnian</HI> gulph, to the north shore, were made on foot, and our traveller was attended by two <HI>Lap∣landers;</HI> one his interpreter, and the other his guide. He tells us that the vigour and strength of these two men, both old, and sufficiently loaded with his baggage, excited his admiration, since they appeared quite unhurt by their labour, while he himself, although young and robust, was fre∣quently quite exhausted. In this journey he was wont to sleep under the boat with which they forded the rivers, as a defence against rain, and the gnats, which in the <HI>Lapland</HI> summer are not less teazing than in the torrid zones. In de∣scending one of these rivers, he narrowly escaped perishing by the oversetting of the boat, and lost many of the natural productions which he had collected.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS thus spent the greater part of the summer in examining this arctic region, and those mountains, on which, four years afterwards, the
<PB N="8" REF="13" MS="y"/>
French philosophers secured immortal fame to Sir <HI>Isaac Newton.</HI> At length, after having suffered incredible fatigues and hardships, in climbing pre∣cipices, passing rivers in miserable boats, suffering repeated vicissitudes of extreme heat and cold, and not unfrequently hunger and thirst; he re∣turned to <HI>Tornoa</HI> in September. He did not take the same route from <HI>Tornoa</HI> as when he came into <HI>Lapland,</HI> having determined to visit, and examine, the country on the eastern side of the <HI>Bothnian</HI> gulph: his first stage, therefore, was to <HI>Ula,</HI> in <HI>East Bothnia;</HI> from thence to <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Carleby,</HI> 84 miles south from <HI>Ula.</HI> He continued his route through <HI>Wasa, Christianstedi,</HI> and <HI>Biorneburgh,</HI> to <HI>Abo,</HI> a small university in <HI>Fin∣land.</HI> Winter was now setting in apace, he there∣fore crossed the gulph by the island of <HI>Aland,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Upsal</HI> in November, after having per∣formed, and that mostly on foot, a journey of ten degrees of latitude in extent, exclusive of those de∣viations which such a design rendered necessary.</P>
<P>The <HI>result</HI> of this journey was not published till several years afterwards, during his residence in <HI>Holland.</HI> For the present he only gave in to the academy a <HI>Florula Lapponica,</HI> consisting of a very few pages in the <HI>Acta Upsaliensia</HI> for the years 1732 and 1734. In this little catalogue the plants are disposed according to the system which was after∣wards called the <HI>sexual;</HI> and which we should not have mentioned here, but to prove how early <HI>Lin∣naeus</HI> had laid the foundation of that method, which he afterwards wrought up to such perfection.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="14" MS="y"/>
In 1733 he visited and examined the several mines in <HI>Sweden,</HI> and made himself so well ac∣quainted with <HI>mineralogy,</HI> and the <HI>docimastic</HI> art, that we find he was sufficiently qualified to give lectures on those subjects, upon his return to the university. The outlines of his system on mi∣neralogy appeared in the early editions of the <HI>Systema Naturae;</HI> but he did not exemplify the whole until the year 1768.</P>
<P>In the year 1734 LINNAEUS was sent by Baron <HI>Reuterholm,</HI> governor of <HI>Dalekarlia,</HI> with several other naturalists, into that province, to investigate the natural productions of that part of the <HI>Swedish</HI> dominions. Each gentleman had his particular department assigned; and they noted daily the ob∣servations made relating to geography, &amp;c.; but particularly, and as their principal object, the eco∣nomical and natural history, and mineralogy. A full account of these observations was intended to have been published, but the design was laid aside. It was in this journey that our author firft laid the plan of an excellent institution, which was after∣wards executed in a certain degree at least, by himself, with the assistance of many of his pupils, and the result published under the title of <HI>Pan Suecus,</HI> in the second volume of the <HI>Amaenitates Academicae.</HI></P>
<P>After the completion of this expedition, it ap∣pears that LINNAEUS resided for a time at <HI>Fahlun,</HI> the principal town in <HI>Dalekarlia;</HI> where he tells us that he taught <HI>mineralogy,</HI> and the <HI>docimastic</HI> art, and practised physic; and where he was very hospitably treated by Dr. <HI>More,</HI> the physician of
<PB N="10" REF="15" MS="y"/>
the place. It also appears, that he contracted at this time an intimacy with one of that gentleman's daughters, whom he married about five years afterwards, upon his settling as a <HI>physician</HI> at <HI>Stock∣holm.</HI></P>
<P>In this journey he extended his travels quite across the <HI>Dalekarlian Alps</HI> into <HI>Norway;</HI> but we have no particular account of his discoveries in that kingdom. From its situation, however, in the same parallels of latitude and of longitude, nearly, with <HI>Sweden,</HI> as well as from the face of the country, but little variety could be expected; and from the <HI>Flora Norwegica</HI> of Bp. <HI>Gunner,</HI> since published, the vegetable productions of na∣ture appear to be nearly the same, except that the <HI>Norway</HI> coast abounds with <HI>fuci</HI> or sea-wracks, not known in the <HI>Baltic.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1735, LINNAEUS travelled over many other parts of <HI>Sweden,</HI> some parts of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and fixed in <HI>Holland,</HI> where he chiefly resided until his return to <HI>Stockholm,</HI> about the year 1739. He here took his doctor's degree in physic, in June 1735. How clearly the great <HI>Boerhaave</HI> saw his merit will appear hereafter. On the present occasion he sustained a <HI>thesis</HI> under the title of HYPOTHESIS NOVA <HI>de febrium inter∣mittentium causa.</HI> It is an enquiry into the causes of the frequency of that distemper in <HI>Sweden,</HI> particularly in <HI>Upland,</HI> and the south-east parts of that kingdom; which he was inclined to attribute to a <HI>local</HI> cause, after the most minute scrutiny into the soil and situation of those places where this distemper was so remarkably prevalent and
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
obstinate; and finally proposes, Whether it might not be owing to the strong impreg∣nation of the water with <HI>argillaceous</HI> particles? Whether or not he afterwards adhered to this opinion, we are uncertain, as it is but justice to observe, that he did not republish this tract himself, since it was placed at the head of the first volume of the <HI>Amaenitates,</HI> printed at <HI>Ley∣den,</HI> as we believe, without his knowledge, by Dr. <HI>Peter Camper.</HI> In the mean time we may observe, that howsoever insufficient this <HI>hypothesis</HI> may be to solve the difficulties that have at∣tended the search into the remote causes of this disease; the advocates of the modern theory, re∣lating to it, may think the author's facts, of its frequency in <HI>low</HI> situations, confirm and illustrate in no small degree their own, according to which it is imputed to <HI>miasmata</HI> arising from moist and marshy ground.</P>
<P>In this year LINNAEUS also published the first sketch of his <HI>Systema Naturae,</HI> in a very com∣pendious way, and in the form of tables only, in twelve pages <HI>in folio.</HI> By this it appears, that he had at a very early period of his life (cer∣tainly before he was 24 years old) laid the basis of that great structure which he afterwards raised, not only to the increase of his own fame, but to that of natural science.</P>
<P>In 1736, LINNAEUS came into <HI>England,</HI> and vi∣sited Dr. <HI>Dillenius,</HI> the late learned professor at <HI>Oxford,</HI> whom he justly considered as one of the first botanists in <HI>Europe.</HI> He mentions with par∣ticular respect the civilities he received from him,
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
and the privileges he gave him of inspecting his own, and the <HI>Sherardian</HI> collections of plants. It is needless to say, that he visited Dr. <HI>Martyn,</HI> Mr. <HI>Rand,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Miller,</HI> and that he was in a more singular manner indebted to the friendship of Dr. <HI>Isaac Lawson.</HI> He also <Q REND="margQuotes">contracted an intimate friendship with Mr. PETER COLLINSON, which was reciprocally increased by a multitude of good offices, and continued to the last without any diminution.</Q> Dr. <HI>Boerhaave</HI> had furnished him with letters to our great naturalist Sir HANS SLOANE; but, it is with regret that we must ob∣serve, they did not procure him the reception which the warmth of his recommendation seemed to claim.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Boerhaave</HI>'s letter to Sir <HI>Hans Sloane,</HI> on this occasion, is preserved in the British Museum, and runs thus—<Q REND="margQuotes">LINNAEUS, <HI>qui has tibi dabit literas, est unice dignus te videre, unice dignus a te videri; qui vos videbit simul, videhit hominum par, cui simile vix dabit orbis.</HI></Q>—This encomium, howsoever quaintly expressed, yet was in some measure pro∣phetic of <HI>Linnaeus</HI>'s future fame and greatness, and proves how intimately <HI>Boerhaave</HI> had penetrated into the genius and abilities of our author; and, strained as this parallel might be thought, it is likely however that the opening of the <HI>sexual</HI> system, so different from <HI>Ray's,</HI> by which Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI> had always known plants, and particularly the in∣novations, as they were then called, which LIN∣NAEUS had made in altering the names of so many <HI>genera,</HI> were rather the cause of that coolness with which he was received by our excellent naturalist.
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
Probably we have reason to regret this circum∣stance; for otherwise LINNAEUS might have obtained an establishment in <HI>England,</HI> as it has been thought he wished to have done; and doubtless his op∣portunities in this kingdom would have been much more favourable to his designs, than in those arctic regions where he spent the remainder of his days. In the mean time, we may justly infer the exalted idea that <HI>Linnaeus</HI> had of <HI>England,</HI> as a land eminently favourable to the improvement of science, from that compliment which, in a letter to a friend, he after∣wards paid to <HI>London,</HI> when, speaking of that city, he called it <HI>"Punctum saliens in vitello orbis."</HI> However, the <HI>English</HI> naturalists may now con∣gratulate themselves on having adopted a most excellent disciple of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> school; who, with an illustrious associate, shared the perils of a navigation round this globe, incited by thirst of knowledge alone; and who now enjoys that general esteem among us which is due to his extensive science, and to his singular liberality of mind and manners.</P>
<P>One of the most agreeable circumstances that happened to LINNAEUS, during his residence in <HI>Holland,</HI> arose from the patronage of Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> in whose house <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The country seat and garden of Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> was at <HI>Hartcamp,</HI> about three miles from <HI>Haerlem.</HI></NOTE>he lived a considerable part of his time, being now as it were the child of fortune:—<HI>Exivi patriâ triginta sex nummis aureis dives</HI>—are his own words. With Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
however, he enjoyed pleasures and privileges scarcely at that time to be met with elsewhere in the world; that of a garden excellently stored with the finest exotics, and a library furnished with almost every botanic author of note. How happy he found himself in this situation, those only who have felt the same kind of ardour can conceive.</P>
<P>Whilst in <HI>Holland,</HI> our author was recom∣mended by <HI>Boerhaave</HI> to fill the place, then va∣cant, of physician to the <HI>Dutch</HI> settlement at <HI>Suri∣nam;</HI> but he declined it, on account of his hav∣ing been educated in so opposite a climate. He recommended, however, to that department a young German physician of great merit, who had the misfortune to fall a sacrifice, partly to the climate, and partly perhaps to ill usage from the governor, in half a year after his arrival: A circumstance which LINNAEUS has very pathe∣tically lamented in the <HI>Flora Suecica,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 515, when treating of a plant to which he has given this gentleman's name.</P>
<P>Besides being favoured with the particular patronage and friendship of <HI>Boerhaave</HI> and Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> as is above-mentioned, our author had also the pleasure of being contemporary with, and of reckoning among the number of his friends, many other learned persons, who have since proved orna∣ments to their profession, and whose merit has most deservedly raised them to fame and honour. Among these we may properly mention Dr. <HI>John Burman,</HI> professor of botany at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> whose name and family are well known in the republic of
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
letters, to whom our author dedicated his <HI>Biblio∣theca Botanica,</HI> having been greatly assisted in com∣piling that work, by the free access he had to that gentleman's excellent library; <HI>John Frederick Grono∣vius,</HI> of <HI>Leyden,</HI> editor of <HI>Clayton's Flora Virginica,</HI> and who very early adopted <HI>Linnaeus</HI>'s system; Baron <HI>Van Swieten,</HI> late physician to the Empress Queen; <HI>Isaac Lawson,</HI> before-mentioned, after∣wards one of the physicians to the British army, who died much regretted at <HI>Oosterhout,</HI> in the year 1747, and from whom <HI>Linnaeus</HI> received singular and very important civilities; <HI>Kramer,</HI> since well known for an excellent treatise on the Doci∣mastic Art; <HI>Van Royen,</HI> botanic professor at <HI>Leyden; Liëberkun,</HI> of <HI>Berlin,</HI> famous for his skill in microscopical instruments and experiments. On this occasion it is not foreign to our plan to remark, that LINNAEUS, being present with several of these gentlemen, at a meeting when the latter was exhibiting the animalcules <HI>in semine masculino,</HI> openly declared his opinion, that these <HI>moleculae</HI> were not true animalcules; and he appears ever afterwards to have retained the same opinion re∣lating to them. To these may be added also the names of <HI>Albinus</HI> and <HI>Gaubius,</HI> and of others, were it requisite, to shew that our author's talents had very early rendered him conspicuous, and gained him the regard of all those who cultivated and patronized any branch of medical science; and to which, doubtless, the singular notice with which <HI>Boerhaave</HI> honoured him, did not a little contri∣bute.</P>
<P>Early in the year 1738, after LINNAEUS had left
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> and, as it should seem, when he re∣sided with <HI>Van Royen,</HI> at <HI>Leyden,</HI> he had a long and dangerous fit of sickness; and upon his re∣covery, went to <HI>Paris,</HI> where he was properly entertained by the <HI>Jussieu's,</HI> at that time the first botanists in <HI>France.</HI> The opportunity this gave him of inspecting the Herbaria of <HI>Surian</HI> and <HI>Tour∣nefort,</HI> and those of the above-named gentlemen, afforded him great satisfaction. He had intended to have gone from thence into <HI>Germany,</HI> to visit <HI>Ludwig,</HI> and the celebrated HALLER, with whom he was in close correspondence; but he was not able to compleat this part of his intended route, and was obliged to return without this gratification.</P>
<P>Our author did not fail to avail himself of every advantage, that access to the several museums of this country afforded him, in every branch of natural history; and the number and importance of his publications, during this absence from his native country, sufficiently demonstrate that fund of knowledge which he must have imbibed before, and no less testify his extraordinary application. As these works laid the foundation of his future fame, and distinguished character, it will be incum∣bent on us to enumerate them, and give a brief account of each, as nearly as we can in the order of time in which they were published, before we accompany our author into <HI>Sweden;</HI> whither he returned to receive at length the reward of his merit.</P>
<P>The first of these was the SYSTEMA NATURAE, <HI>five regna tria Naturae systematicè proposita, per</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
<HI>classes, ordines, genera et species.</HI> Lugd. Bat. 1735. fol. pp. 14, in Latin, with the <HI>Swedish</HI> names annexed. As this is little more than the general <HI>outlines</HI> of his work, we shall reserve a fuller account of it till we come to the enlarged editions; in which it was fully exemplified by the introduction of the <HI>species.</HI></P>
<P>FUNDAMENTA BOTANICA, <HI>quae majorum operum prodromi instar, theoriam Scientiae Botanices per breves Aphorismos tradunt. Amst.</HI> 1736, 12<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 35. The science of botany is in this work reduced to 365 aphorisms, or canons; and what <HI>Sethus Calvisius</HI> has said of <HI>Ptolemy</HI>'s canon, <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> may be truly said of this work.—<HI>Omni auro pretiosior est, si dudum innotuisset, nec adeo in diversas sectas</HI> BOTA∣NICI <HI>abiisent, sed</HI> RES BOTANICAE, <HI>multo melius se haberent.</HI> It passed through several editions, and was published with a comment upon each aphorism in 1751, under the title of <HI>Philosophia Botanica,</HI> hereafter to be noticed.</P>
<P>BIBLIOTHECA BOTANICA, <HI>recensens libros plus mille de plantis hucusque editos, secundum Systema Auctorum naturale in classes, ordines, genera et species dispositos, additis editionis loco, tempore, forma, lingua.</HI> Amst. 1736, 12<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 153, and afterwards in 8<SUP>o</SUP>, 1751, much enlarged. Botanic writers are in this work distributed into 16 classes, and it is by no means so unentertaining as might be expected from the general idea of a catalogue merely; as the author has frequently subjoined short characters of the books; and at the beginning of each class, as also in the orders or subdivisions, takes occasion to ex∣plain several of his terms used in his subsequent
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
writings. The preface contains a short history of the rise and progress of botany, and an acknow∣ledgment of the aid the author received in the compilation of this work, by his free access to the libraries of Mr. <HI>Sprekelsen</HI> at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> Dr. <HI>Gro∣novius</HI> at <HI>Leyden,</HI> and particularly to those of his patron Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Burman,</HI> professor of botany at <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> Authors are classed in this work as follows:

<P>Subjoined to the last edition, we have a biogra∣phical table, exhibiting, in chronological order, the names of 139 botanic authors, from the time of <HI>Avicenna</HI> in 981, to Mr. <HI>Catesby</HI> in 1749, specifying, wherever it was possible, the year of their birth and death.</P>
<P>The flowering of the <HI>Plantain</HI> or <HI>Banana (Musa paradisiaca)</HI> this year, a thing not seen in <HI>Europe</HI> before more than thrice, in the garden of our au∣thor's patron M. <HI>Clifford,</HI> produced a compleat his∣tory of that plant from LINNAEUS'S pen, under the title of MUSA CLIFFORTIANA <HI>florens Hartecampi</HI> 1736 <HI>prope Harlemum.</HI> Lugd. Bat. 4<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 46. This piece is drawn up with the utmost precision, ac∣cording to the author's own <HI>Methodus Demonstrandi,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>
printed at the end of the <HI>Systema,</HI> and is a model for <HI>Monographers</HI> in this way. It is embellished with two plates, one representing the plant at large, the other, the parts of fructification separately.</P>
<P>GENERA PLANTARUM <HI>eorumque Characteres na∣turales secundum numerum, figuram, situm, et proportio∣nem, omnium fructificationis partium.</HI> Lugd. Bat. 1737, 8<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 384. In this work, which exhibits what LINNAEUS has called the <HI>natural characters</HI> of the <HI>genera</HI> of plants, the <HI>classes</HI> are established upon the <HI>number</HI> or <HI>situation,</HI> or both conjointly, of the <HI>stamina,</HI> analogically considered as the male parts; and the <HI>orders</HI> or subdivisions of the classes, upon the <HI>pistils,</HI> analogous to the female parts: and the <HI>genera</HI> themselves from the agreement of all the parts of fructification compared with each other, as they agree in <HI>number, figure, situation,</HI> and <HI>pro∣portion.</HI> Hence the <HI>Linnaean characters</HI> of plants are applicable to any classical method founded on the parts of fructification alone, in which respect they have the advantage over those of all foregoing writers, and will probably stand firm, even al∣though the <HI>classical</HI> part of the system should be set aside. This is to be considered as one of the capital of <HI>Linnaeus</HI>'s works. He tells us, that before the publication of the first edition, he had examined the characters of 8000 flowers. Those alone who have been accustomed to examine plants with a scientific view, can judge how arduous this undertaking must have been, and how great the application that he must necessarily have bestowed thereon, and that at an early period of life. Neither can any others sufficiently admire that accuracy with which
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
so great a number of flowers <HI>have been</HI> examined and compared, or see the aptitude of that assem∣blage of terms, which were invented by LINNAEUS, to express the different <HI>figure, situation,</HI> and <HI>pro∣portion,</HI> that exist in such a variety of subjects. If this was a proper place to expatiate upon this sub∣ject, by extending the idea to all that LINNAEUS has done, respecting every other part of plants, as considered in their <HI>specific</HI> distinctions, it must still farther exalt the merit of the author, and place him above all praise. At the latter end of this work was given the general plan of a system invented by LINNAEUS, and founded upon the different <HI>kinds,</HI> and <HI>arrangement,</HI> of the <HI>calix</HI> or cup of the flower, in plants: but this was omitted in the lat∣ter editions. Also a fragment of that <HI>primum et ultimum</HI> in botany, the <HI>natural method.</HI></P>
<P>The first edition of this book contained 935 <HI>genera:</HI> the sixth and last, at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in 1764, hath extended the number to 1239, and the <HI>Mantissae</HI> since to 1336. It has been thought by some, that the first idea of the <HI>sexual</HI> me∣thod was received from the writings of <HI>Jungius,</HI> a learned professor, first at <HI>Helmstadt,</HI> and after∣wards <HI>rector</HI> of the Gymnasium at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> where he died in 1657, and whose works contain an uncommon display of original observations on the subject of plants; and prove him to have been a most accurate observer of nature. He has not only discriminated with peculiar nicety, the struc∣ture, and several parts of plants, but he hath also, with equal judgment, shewn the impropriety of many of the old generical and specifical distinc∣tions,
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
and has given rules for forming them anew, that have been of the greatest service to his suc∣cessors in the science, and of which they have not failed to avail themselves. But <HI>Jungius</HI> did not, however, exhibit any plan, by which it appears that he laid the basis either of the sexual, or any other system.</P>
<P>Before the conclusion of the same year (1737) our author published the COROLLARIUM GENERUM, <HI>cui accedit</HI> METHODUS SEXUALIS, in 8<SUP>o</SUP>; the for∣mer contained only the addition of sixty new genera of plants; all which were taken into the next edition of the foregoing book; and the latter ex∣hibits a brief view of the sexual system, as far as respects the <HI>classes</HI> and <HI>orders.</HI> Neither would it be of importance to mention a small piece published in the same year, during his residence with Mr. <HI>Clif∣ford,</HI> under the title of VIRIDARIUM CLIFFORTIA∣NUM, were it not incumbent on us to mention all that came from our author's pen.</P>
<P>In this year, 1737, appeared likewise the result of the <HI>Lapland</HI> expedition, as far, at least, as re∣lates to the plants of that country; for we are now deprived of the expectation of ever seeing the <HI>Lachesis Lapponica,</HI> intended to complete our au∣thor's history of this country through all its parts. This volume includes the plants of a tract of country not less than 100 <HI>Swedish</HI> miles (nearly equal to 600 <HI>English)</HI> in length, and 50 in breadth, under the title of FLORA LAPPONICA, <HI>exhibens Plan∣tas per Lapponiam crescentes, secundum Systema sexuale, collectas in itinere impensis Societatis regiae Litterariae et Scientiarum Sueciae An.</HI> 1732 <HI>instituto, additis syno∣nymis,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
<HI>et locis natalibus omnium, descriptionibus et figuris rariorum, viribus medicatis et oeconomicis pluri∣marum. Amst.</HI> 1737, 8<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 372, tab. 12. This work is much more than a bare enumeration of synonyms; the preface contains an account of the author's journey, and his acknowledgment to the members of a literary society, by whose munifi∣cence this work was adorned with the plates, on which are engraven 58 of the more rare, and chiefly <HI>alpine</HI> plants. This is preceded by ad∣ditional <HI>Prolegomena,</HI> in which the <HI>geographic</HI> and <HI>natural</HI> description of the country is set forth, and the difference between the <HI>Alps</HI> and the <HI>Desart</HI> dis∣tinctly marked; concluding with some observations on <HI>alpine</HI> plants in general. The work is interspersed with many very curious observations relating to the inhabitants, their simplicity of life and man∣ners, their diseases; the animals of the country; the medical and economical uses of many of the plants; descriptions at large of such as were not well described before; and critical observations, in a botanical way, upon others.</P>
<P>To instance briefly a few only of our author's observations. Under</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 16. The dropsy very frequent in <HI>East Both∣nia;</HI> owing to the intemperate use of spirits.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 22. The down of the <HI>Cotton Grass,</HI> used for bedding among the poor, instead of feathers.</P>

<HI>Trefoil.</HI> The scurvy unknown in <HI>Lapland;</HI> although vegetable productions have scarcely any share in the <HI>Lapland</HI> diet, which is almost wholly the recent flesh of the rein-deer: a fact which Sir <HI>John Pringle</HI> has made good use of, among others, in his dis∣course "On the means of preserving the health of "mariners."</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 101. Symptoms of the <HI>Colica Lapponica,</HI> (Sauvag. Nosol. II. p. 103) a most excruciating disease, for which the <HI>Laplanders</HI> use the root of <HI>Angelica.</HI></P>

<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 341, 342. Uses of the <HI>Birch-tree;</HI> and the <HI>Dwarf Birch,</HI> beyond almost all others. The thick woods of this tree frequently set on fire by light∣ning, and consumed for miles. <HI>Moxa</HI> of the <HI>Lap∣landers</HI>

<P>In this work, moreover, our author has first exemplified, what he ever afterwards laboured to bring to its greatest perfection, in all his writings, and particularly in the <HI>Species Plantarum,</HI> a work not published till sixteen years afterwards, <HI>the spe∣cific names of plants,</HI> not taken, as had been custom∣ary with former authors, from the colour of the flower, relative size of the plant, smell, taste, place of growth, time of flowering, name of the dis∣coverer, virtues, uses, duration; none of which are
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
sufficiently permanent: but from those invariable and essential parts, which fully and clearly distin∣guish each species under the same genus, and in the compass of ten or twelve words convey such an idea of the plant intended, as will more effec∣tually distinguish it, than the <HI>verbose descriptions</HI> of many foregoing authors. LINNAEUS has taken in∣credible pains with this part of his system, which is certainly as difficult as any that leads to the perfection of the science, since it depends upon a nice inspection of <HI>every species</HI> belonging to each <HI>genus,</HI> and of every <HI>actual variety</HI> belonging to each <HI>species.</HI></P>
<P>The plants of <HI>Lapland</HI> are but few, not amount∣ing to more than 537 species; and in this number are included upwards of an hundred discovered by <HI>Linnaeus</HI> in this journey, not known to be natives of <HI>Sweden</HI> before; and of which some were non∣descripts: among the former, there seems to be a propriety in mentioning specially the <HI>Campanula serpyllifolia,</HI> or thyme-leaved Bell-flower, which, as it turned out to be a new <HI>genus,</HI> was appropriated to our author by Dr. <HI>J. Gronovius,</HI> and engraved in this volume by the name of LINNAEA.</P>
<P>No part of LINNAEUS'S writings had given more offence to the contemporary botanists, than the liberty he had taken in changing the <HI>generic names</HI> of plants, which had necessarily taken place in many instances, from the rules established by the <HI>Fundamenta.</HI> Even DILLENIUS was by no means reconciled to this innovation. LINNAEUS, who had entertained an high opinion of our <HI>English</HI> pro∣fessor, having said of him—<HI>nullus est in Anglia qui</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
<HI>genera curat, vel intelligit praeterquam Dillenius</HI>—probably, therefore, dedicated to him his next publication, the CRITICA BOTANICA, <HI>in qua No∣mina Plantarum generica, et specifica, et variantia exa∣mini subjiciuntur, selectiora confirmantur, indigna re∣jiciuntur, simulque doctrina circa Denominationem Plan∣tarum traditur.</HI> Lugd. Bat. 1737, 8<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 270. This is a large comment upon the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th parts of the <HI>Fundamenta,</HI> from Aphorism 210 to 324 inclusive; in which he has amply explained all his reasons for these alterations; and there were at that time many who saw the justice of his remarks. <HI>Ludwig</HI> says, when speaking of this work—<HI>"rigo∣rosus quidem, sed saepissime faelix botanicorum censor est."</HI> The work is rendered very applicable to use, by two excellent indexes.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS printed, at the end of this volume, <HI>Discursus de introducenda in scholas et gymnasia Histo∣riae naturalis lectione,</HI> pp. 24, written by Dr. <HI>Bro∣wallius,</HI> who afterwards defended very ably the system of <HI>Linnaeus</HI> against professor <HI>Siegesbeck</HI> of <HI>Petersburgh.</HI></P>
<P>In 1737 was likewise published the most splendid of all our author's writings, the <HI>Hortus Cliffortianus Plantas exhibens quas in Hortis tam vivis quam siccis, Hartecampi in Hollandia, coluit Vir Nob. et Gen. Geor∣gius Clifford, J. U. D. reductis varietatibus ad species, speciebus ad genera, generibus ad classes, adjectis locis plantarum natalibus, differentiisque specierum.</HI> Amst. 1737, fol. pp. 501, t. 32. As this book was printed at the expence of Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> it is orna∣mented with an elegant frontispiece, and adorned with some of the finest engravings of plants that
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
are extant, the drawings for which were made with all possible accuracy by the late Mr. <HI>Ehret.</HI> By the munificence of Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> many of the cele∣brated botanists received a present of this book. How rich this garden was in plants, the book will testify. They are arranged, as in all our author's succeeding works, in the sexual method; the varie∣ties are reduced to their several species, the natural places of the plants are particularly noticed, many new <HI>genera,</HI> and <HI>species</HI> under former genera, are introduced, with their descriptions at large, and curious observations interspersed throughout the whole. And, what must have been more especi∣ally acceptable to those who began to relish our author's system, was, the farther exemplification of his <HI>specific characters,</HI> which the vast number of plants included in this work necessarily led to. Add to this, that from the copious number of synonyms, it is almost a <HI>pinax</HI> of every plant therein mentioned; and on this account, as well as others, will yet retain its value, though superseded in a great degree by the <HI>Species Plantarum.</HI> To the curious and critical botanist also it is no small satisfaction now, to see in this volume, compared with later works, the progress of the author's own knowledge, manifest by the removes and altera∣tions that better information enabled him to make. In the dedication our author enumerates those patrons who have cultivated botanical gar∣dens so greatly to the emolument of the science: he gives a list of the <HI>Cliffortian</HI> library, and an∣nexes two tables, with explanations of all the variety of leaves, according to his new method
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
of defining them. This addition was very neces∣sary, as the number of plants synonymed in this volume amounts to near 2,500. We conclude with <HI>Gesner's</HI> opinion of this work, in a letter to the celebrated <HI>Haller:</HI> <Q REND="margQuotes">Opus sane egregium et acerrimi judicii, nec minoris eruditionis, quo dif∣ficulter botanicus carebit.—Mihi perplacet ab eo in nominibus specierum notas earum essentiales exhiberi, quod ante vix quisquam botanicus recte praestitit.</Q></P>
<P>The last book which LINNAEUS published of his own, during his stay in <HI>Holland,</HI> was the CLASSES PLANTARUM, <HI>seu Systemata Plantarum om∣nia a fructificatione desumta, quorum</HI> 16 <HI>universalia et</HI> 13 <HI>partialia, compendiose proposita secundum classes, ordines et nomina generica, cum clave cujusvis methodi et synonymis genericis.</HI> Lugd. Bat. 1738, pp. 656. This work is a very large illustration of the second part of the <HI>Fundamenta,</HI> from aphorism 53 to 78, and contains a compendious and useful view of all the systems of botany, or methods of classing plants, both general and partial, from <HI>Caesalpinus,</HI> in 1583, who is considered as the inventor, to LINNAEUS himself in 1735. To the generical name in every system, he has added that by which it stands in his own, which is a great advantage in the use of this book. A new edition, with the requisite additions, would be very acceptable to the public even now. The systems at large that are displayed in this book, are those of <HI>Caesal∣pinus, Morison, Ray, Knaut, Herman,</HI> and <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> founded on the fruit: <HI>Rivinus, Ruppius, Ludwig,</HI> and <HI>Knaut,</HI> on the number of petals in the flower: <HI>Tournefort</HI> and <HI>Pontedera,</HI> on the figure of the
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>
same: and of <HI>Magnol</HI> and LINNAEUS, on the cup of the flower. After these follow LINNAEUS'S sexual system, and his fragments of the natural method. We say nothing of the arrangement of <HI>particular</HI> classes, such are the <HI>composite</HI> flowers, the <HI>umbelliferous</HI> plants, the <HI>graminaceous,</HI> the <HI>ferns,</HI> &amp;c. A very large index, referring to every <HI>genus</HI> in each system, concludes the volume.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS, whilst in <HI>Holland,</HI> sustained a very severe loss in the premature death of his friend and fellow student <HI>Artedi;</HI> with whom, as has been before observed, he had contracted the firmest friendship whilst they resided at <HI>Upsal;</HI> insomuch that they had, in case of death, mutually be∣queathed to each other their manuscripts and collections in natural history. <HI>Artedi</HI> had been particularly assiduous in arranging anew, and describing all such fishes as had fallen under his own inspection; and had taken a voyage to <HI>Eng∣land</HI> in 1734, to give more perfection to his plan. Our author, after his death, procured, though with some difficulty, all <HI>Artedi</HI>'s papers, and put the finishing hand to them, and published them at <HI>Leyden</HI> in 1738, in octavo, under the title of <HI>Petri Artedi, Sueci Medici,</HI> ICHTHYOLOGIA: <HI>sive opera omnia de piscibus, scilicet Bibliotheca Ichthyo∣logica; Philosophia Ichthyologica; Genera Piscium; Synonymia Specierum; Descriptiones Specierum. Om∣nia in hoc genere perfectiora quam antea ulla. Post∣huma vindicavit, recognovit, cooptavit, et edidit, Caro∣lus</HI> LINNAEUS. In this work fishes are arranged in an entire new method, and which our author adopted with little or no variation, and continued
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>
through all the former editions of his <HI>System</HI> to the tenth; when he removed the <HI>cetaceous</HI> order into the class of the <HI>mammalia;</HI> and instead of re∣taining in the remaining orders the distinctions arising from the <HI>bony</HI> or <HI>cartilaginous</HI> texture of the <HI>fins;</HI> he established them on the <HI>situation</HI> of the <HI>ventral fins,</HI> which he considers as analogous to the feet in other animals, as they are placed either before, underneath, or behind the <HI>pectoral fins.</HI></P>
<P>In this work <HI>Artedi</HI> has exhibited an instance of genius, labour, and application, that cannot fail to excite the greatest regret at his early death. He has given to <HI>Ichthyology</HI> that degree of perfec∣tion, which his friend afterwards extended through all the animal kingdom, and which must remain a lasting monument of his abilities. In parti∣cular, his descriptions of the indigenous fishes of <HI>Sweden,</HI> are scientific to a degree that had never before been seen; and we cannot sufficiently ad∣mire the pains he must have taken to extricate the synonyms from every author on the subject. <HI>Artedi,</HI> after his return from <HI>England,</HI> was re∣tained, at the recommendation of LINNAEUS, by <HI>Seba</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> to complete that part of his <HI>Thesaurus</HI> relating to fishes, and was unfortunately drowned in one of the canals in that city. LIN∣NAEUS, in a short account of the author's life, has lamented his untimely decease, in a manner which does no less honour to his friend than to his own feelings.</P>
<P>We must now accompany our author into <HI>Sweden,</HI> whither he returned about the latter end
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>
of the year 1738, or the beginning of the next, and settled as a physician at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> where he seems to have met with considerable opposition, and was oppressed with many difficulties; all of which at length he overcame, and got into ex∣tensive practice; and, soon after his settlement, married the lady before spoken of. By the interest of Count <HI>Tessin,</HI> who was afterwards his great patron, and even procured medals to be struck in honour of him, he obtained the rank of physician to the fleet, and a stipend from the citizens for giving lectures in botany. And what at this time especially was highly favourable to the advancement of his character and fame, by giving him an opportunity of displaying his abilities, was the establishment of the <HI>Royal Academy of Sciences</HI> at <HI>Stockholm;</HI> of which LIN∣NAEUS was constituted the first president, and to which establishment the king granted several pri∣vileges, particularly that of free postage to all pa∣pers directed to the secretary. By the rules of the academy, the president held his place but three months, at the expiration of which, he made his ORATIO <HI>de memorabilibus in Insectis,</HI> Oct. 3, 1739; in which he endeavours to excite an atten∣tion and enquiry into the knowledge of insects, by displaying the many singular <HI>phaenomena</HI> that occur in contemplating the nature of those animals, and by pointing out, in a variety of instances, their usefulness to mankind in particular, and to the economy of nature in general.</P>
<P>During all this time, however, LINNAEUS appears to have had his eye upon the botanic and medical
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>
chair at <HI>Upsal,</HI> at this time occupied by <HI>Rudbeck,</HI> who was far advanced in life. We learn in∣deed that he was so intent on pursuing, and per∣fecting, his great designs in the advancement of his favourite study of nature, that he had deter∣mined, if he failed in procuring the professorship at <HI>Upsal,</HI> to accept the offer that had been made to him by <HI>Haller,</HI> of filling the botanic chair at <HI>Gottingen.</HI> However, in course of time, he obtained his wish. In the year 1741, upon the re∣signation of <HI>Roberg,</HI> he was constituted joint pro∣fessor of physic, and physician to the king, with <HI>Rosen,</HI> who had been appointed in the preceding year on the death of <HI>Rudbeck.</HI> These two col∣leagues agreed to divide the medical departments between them; and their choice was confirmed by the university. <HI>Rosen</HI> took anatomy, physiology, pathology, and the therapeutic part. LINNAEUS, natural history, botany <HI>materia medica,</HI> the dietetic part, and the <HI>diagnosis morborum.</HI></P>
<P>During the interval of his removal from <HI>Stock∣holm</HI> to <HI>Upsal,</HI> in consequence of this appointment, our professor was deputed by the states of the kingdom, to make a tour to the islands of <HI>Oëland</HI> and <HI>Gothland,</HI> in the <HI>Baltic,</HI> attended by six of the pupils, commissioned to make such enquiries as might tend to improve agriculture, and arts, in the kingdom; to which the <HI>Swedish</HI> nation had for some time paid a particular attention; awakened, as it were, by the desolating wars of <HI>Charles</HI> the XIIth, to extend their commerce, and cultivate the arts of peace. The result of this journey was very successful, and proved fully satisfactory to
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>
the States, and was afterwards communicated to the public.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS, on his return, entered upon the pro∣fessorship, and pronounced before the university his ORATION <HI>de Peregrinationum intra Patriam neces∣sitate,</HI> Oct. 17, 1741; in which he forcibly displays the usefulness of such excursions, by pointing out to the students that vast field of objects which their country held out to their cultivation; whether in geography, physics, mineralogy, botany, zoology, or economics; and by shewing the benefit that must accrue to themselves and their country as re∣wards to their diligence. That animated spirit which runs through the whole of this composition, renders it one of the most pleasing and instructive of all our author's productions. That intimate knowledge which LINNAEUS himself had acquired of his own country by his repeated travels (fraught as he was too with every requisite for making use∣ful observations) enabled him to point out with the utmost precision the most proper objects of investigation, in every part of nature; and his love to his country gave a zeal to his wishes, that shewed him on this occasion to great advan∣tage; not to add, the aid arising from that self∣congratulation, which he must feel, having just gained, by his late appointment, the summit of his wishes.</P>
<P>The ITER OELANDICUM ET GOTLANDICUM, in 8<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 284, were printed at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in 1745, in the <HI>Swedish</HI> language; as was also the ITER SCANICUM, in 1751, 8<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 435. We cannot help regretting that these <HI>Itinera</HI> have not made
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>
their appearance in the <HI>English,</HI> or some other language besides that of <HI>Sweden;</HI> for though, in a country cultivated like ours, many hints, perhaps, might not be drawn from these volumes, of real importance to agriculture <HI>here;</HI> yet they are so replete with curious and philosophical observa∣tions, that they could not fail to be an acceptable present to the public; as the general scope of these volumes is to adapt natural history to eco∣nomical purposes. In the <HI>Iter Gothlandicum et Oelandicum,</HI> LINNAEUS'S instructions were di∣rected principally to these particulars:—He was to endeavour to find some kind of earth proper for making pottery-ware in imitation of the porcelaine of <HI>China:</HI> he was to notice every production of nature that might supersede the necessity of the importation of any article, used either in physic or manufactures: and in fine, he was to have a regard to every part of natural history. In the execution of his plan, however, he went much farther than his commis∣sion extended, having interspersed a number of observations relating to the antiquities of these islands, the mechanic arts, to the manners of the people, their fishery, and various other articles. He was, as might reasonably be expected, un∣successful in the first part of his commission, since the two islands are almost entirely com∣posed of limestone, or coral rocks, which abound in a remarkable degree in the <HI>Baltic.</HI></P>
<P>As a proof of the little attention that had been paid to natural history in <HI>Sweden,</HI> we may observe,
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>
that our author in this journey discovered above an hundred plants, which before were not known to be indigenous; many of which were such as are used in physic, and in dyeing. He pointed out to the natives several plants of great use in rustic economy, and shewed them the advantage of planting the Sea-reed grass <HI>(Arundo arenaria)</HI> to arrest the sand, and form soil on the shores; to which it is extremely well adapted by the length of the roots. In the ITER OELANDICUM there occurs a curious remark in vegetation, confirming the annual increase of the wood in an oak-tree, in which was perfectly distinguished the hard winters of 1578, 1687, and 1709, by the narrow∣ness of the circles in those years. He describes the process for making tar, as practised by these islanders; and further, intersperses many observa∣tions relating to mineralogy in general; to iron in particular, with which <HI>Sweden</HI> abounds; de∣scribes the iron mountain <HI>Taberg,</HI> (See <HI>Phil. Transact.</HI> vol. xlix. p. 30.) the alum mines of <HI>Mockleby;</HI> the <HI>Poma chrystallina,</HI> or <HI>aëtites marmo∣reus,</HI> which illustrates the formation of chrys∣tals, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the ITER SCANICUM, performed in 1749, our author treats largely on the culture of marshy grounds; on the useful and noxious herbs, for instance, the <HI>Stakan,</HI> supposed to be the <HI>Phellan∣drium aquaticum,</HI> or <HI>Water Hemlock,</HI> which it is believed renders horses that eat it paralytic; on the <HI>Gramen Mannae,</HI> or <HI>Festuca fluitans,</HI> the seeds of which are so particularly useful in fattening geese; on the <HI>Agaricus muscarius,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="41"/>
In 1743, on occasion of conferring a degree on Dr. <HI>J. Westman,</HI> the professor delivered his third ORATION <HI>de Telluris habitabilis incremento:</HI> an elaborate and ingenious defence of that hypo∣thesis, which Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> and several other philosophers, have inclined to, <Q REND="margQuotes">That the pro∣portion of water on the globe of this earth is constantly decreasing.</Q> This leads the pro∣fessor also to discuss the 132d section of the <HI>Philosophia—Initio rerum ex omni specie viventium unicum sexus par creatum fuisse suadet ratio.</HI>—The visible recession of the waters of the sea in divers parts of the earth, particularly apparent in the <HI>Baltic,</HI> had inclined the <HI>Swedish</HI> philosophers to this opinion of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s. The position of the <HI>Philosophia,</HI> he thinks naturally deducible from the foregoing hypothesis, and necessarily so from the <HI>Mosaic</HI> history. In solving the difficul∣ties attending the latter part of the hypothesis, he is led by his subject to enter largely into a part of the economy of nature, which renders his dis∣course highly interesting, independently of ali con∣jectures relating to the main argument: this re∣lates to the various ways in which vegetables are disseminated, and by which they find their way to every part of the globe. To this effect winds, rain, rivers, the sea, animals, &amp;c. are all subser∣vient, as well as the various structure and pro∣perties of the seeds themselves; in illustrating which last affair the professor has taken great pains, and constructed tables of the genera, founded on these different properties of the seeds. In the introduction to this oration, our author turns the
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>
attention of his readers to some of the more re∣markable discoveries that had lately been made in natural history and philosophy; such were those relating to the <HI>Polype, Rattlesnake,</HI> and the <HI>Senega,</HI> &amp;c.; among others also, he mentions a remarkable fact that had been communicated by <HI>Sauvages</HI> of <HI>Montpelier,</HI> respecting the effect of the berries of the <HI>Coriaria myrtifolia,</HI> Spec. pl. 1467 (Myrtle-leaved Sumach) in occasioning instant epilepsy.</P>
<P>The three orations of LINNAEUS are subjoined to the second volume of the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae,</HI> printed in 1752.</P>
<P>In 1745, the professor published his FLORA SUECICA <HI>exhibens Plantas per Regnum Sueciae cres∣centes, systematice cum differentiis specierum, synonymis autorum, nominibus incolarum, solo locorum, usu Pharmacopoeorum,</HI> 8<SUP>o</SUP>, Holm. pp. 392, 1745; and again, with many additions, in 1755, pp. 464. The first edition contains 1140 plants. In the second they are increased, by his own, and the discoveries of his pupils, to 1296. No generical characters are introduced into this work, but re∣ferences made to them as they stand in the <HI>Genera Plantarum,</HI> before spoken of. A number of select <HI>synonyma</HI> is added to his own specific name, under each plant; and not only the <HI>Swedish</HI> names in general, but the <HI>provincial</HI> ones: highly worthy this of imitation in works of this kind, and quite ne∣cessary in so extensive a kingdom. Many of the rare plants are described at large, and botanical criticisms added to many others. In the last edi∣tion the author has interspersed a great number
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>
of curious observations relating to the economical and medical uses of the plants; and has particu∣larly noted those that are capable of being ap∣plied to the purposes of dyeing. The author moreover never fails to mention <HI>euporistic</HI> medi∣cines, which he seems to think, perhaps very justly, have not been attended to by physicians as they deserve. The plan of this work has been a pattern for all succeeding writers of <HI>local</HI> cata∣logues, more especially those who have followed the <HI>Linnaean</HI> system, and has been very little im∣proved by any; perhaps excelled by none. The plants of <HI>Lapland</HI> are all included in this work; and the preface, besides the account of <HI>Swedish</HI> authors on botany, contains a curious division of the several provinces of the kingdom, in respect to their different soils and situation, as adapted to particular plants, specifying under each pro∣vince the plants found therein.</P>
<P>In 1746 appeared the FAUNA SUECICA, <HI>sistens Animalia Sueciae Regni: Mammalia, Aves, Amphi∣bia, Pisces, Insecta, Vermes; distributa per classes et ordines, genera et species, &amp;c. Stockholm</HI> 1746, 8<SUP>o</SUP>; and again, greatly augmented, in 1761, pp. 556. The first edition contained 1350 subjects, the latter comprehends not less than 2266. Neither in this work are any <HI>classical, ordinal,</HI> or <HI>generical</HI> notes given at large. The world had never seen so compendious, and it may be truly said, at the same time, so complete a <HI>zoology</HI> before. Here, as in plants, the author has given to each animal a new specific name, expressive, as far as possible, of its essential character. The <HI>synonyms</HI> are added,
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>
or referred to, from almost every author on the subject, and almost every animal is moreover com∣pendiously described. <HI>Insects</HI> make a very consi∣derable part of this catalogue; near 1700 species, all found in that kingdom, are enumerated, distin∣guished, and methodized, in a manner entirely new, and which has been adopted by nearly every writer on the subject since. We shall speak more fully of the classification in the abstract intended to be given of the <HI>Systema Naturae.</HI> A compendious manual of <HI>English Zoology</HI> on this plan, is a work much wanted; though we think it could not fail to enhance its value, if the tables of the genera were prefixed to each class, and the characters to each genus, as in the <HI>System</HI> of our author. Two plates, of some of the rarer birds chiefly, accom∣pany this volume, on which are explained the technical terms used in <HI>ornithology.</HI> The number of each class of animals stands thus:

<P>An accident having thrown into the hands of the professor an <HI>Herbarium,</HI> consisting of five large volumes of plants, he discovered that it was the collection of the famous Dr. <HI>Paul Herman,</HI> which had been made in the island of <HI>Zeylon,</HI> by that gentleman, at the expence of the <HI>Dutch</HI> East India Company. This <HI>Herbarium</HI> had been lost for up∣wards of half a century, until chance threw it into the hands of M. <HI>Gunther,</HI> apothecary to the king of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who sent it to LINNAEUS, re∣questing
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>
the professor to examine it, and affix the names to the plants of this superb collection. Its great value, as being collected by so eminent a man, induced our author to examine the whole with great attention; and he was thereby enabled to form many new <HI>genera,</HI> and settle many doubt∣ful species. He published the result of his la∣bour under the title of FLORA ZEYLANICA, <HI>sistens Plantas indicas Zeylonae Insulae, quae olim</HI> 1670—1677 <HI>lectae fuere, à Paulo Hermanno Professore Botan. Ley∣densi; demum post</HI> 70 <HI>annos ab A. Gunthero orbi redditae.</HI> Holm. 1747, 8<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 254, tab. 4.</P>
<P>This work is yet of use as a <HI>pinax</HI> of these plants, and as a <HI>Linnaean</HI> catalogue of <HI>Burman</HI>'s <HI>Thesaurus Zeylanicus,</HI> published in 1738, and illus∣trated with the figures of upwards of 200 of these plants. Many of the rare species are described, and a very copious number of synonyms added to several of the <HI>East Indian</HI> plants. The <HI>Her∣barium</HI> consisted of about 660 plants, of which the true places in the system are assigned to up∣wards of 400, and the remainder were too im∣perfect to admit of distinction. This volume is rendered valuable by a concise history of the pro∣gress of botany, from the restoration of learning in the 16th century; a natural history of the island, and its general produce; the life of Dr. <HI>Herman;</HI> a short account of <HI>J. Hartog,</HI> who was sent by Dr. <HI>Sherard</HI> to make collections in this island; and of <HI>Burman</HI>'s <HI>Thesaurus Zeylanicus.</HI> LINNAEUS authenticates this <HI>Herbarium</HI> to have been <HI>Herman</HI>'s, by shewing that the numbers, and
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>
the plants, answer to his <HI>Museum Zeylanicum,</HI> pub∣lished in 1717.</P>
<P>We now see LINNAEUS fixed in the situation that was so well adapted to his character, his taste, and abilities, and which seems to have been the object of his ambition, and center of his hopes. Soon after his establishment, he laboured to get the Academical Garden, which had been founded in 1657, put on a better footing, and very soon effected it; procuring also a house to be built for the residence of the professor. The whole had been in ruin ever since the fire in 1702, and at the time <HI>Linnaeus</HI> was appointed professor of botany, the garden did not contain above 50 plants that were exotic. His correspondence with the first botanists in <HI>Europe,</HI> soon supplied him with great variety. He received <HI>Indian</HI> plants from <HI>Jussieu</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> and from <HI>Van Royen</HI> of <HI>Leyden; European</HI> plants from <HI>Haller</HI> and <HI>Ludwig; American</HI> plants from the late Mr. <HI>Collinson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Catesby,</HI> and others; and variety of annuals from <HI>Dillenius:</HI> in short, how much the garden owed to his diligence and care, in a few years, may be seen by the catalogue published under the title of HORTUS UPSALIENSIS <HI>exhibens Plantas exoticas horto Upsaliensis Academiae a sese</HI> (Linnaeo) <HI>illatas ab anno</HI> 1742, <HI>in annum</HI> 1748, <HI>additis, differentiis synonymis, habitationibus, hospitiis, rariorumque descriptionibus, in gratiam studiosae ju∣ventutis.</HI> Holm. 1748, 8<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 306, tab. 3. By this catalogue it appears that the professor had introduced 1100 species, exclusive of all the <HI>Swedish</HI> plants, and of varieties; which latter, in ordinary gardens, amount not unfrequently
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>
to one third of the whole number. The preface contains a curious history of the cli∣mate at <HI>Upsal,</HI> and the progress of the seasons through the whole year. From these observa∣tions we learn, that the greatest degree of heat, in the summer of 1747, at <HI>Upsal,</HI> was on the second day of <HI>July,</HI> when <HI>Celsius</HI>'s thermometer stood at 30 degrees above 0; that the greatest degree of cold, on the 25th of <HI>January</HI> 1740, was 28 de∣grees below 0. In this thermometer the freezing point is 0, and boiling water 100. From seven years observations on the <HI>leafing</HI> of the oak, it was found never to push before the 6th of <HI>May,</HI> or to be retarded beyond the 22d.</P>
<P>About this period it was, that LINNAEUS made a remarkable discovery, relating to the generation of pearls in the <HI>river Pearl-Muscle</HI> (Mya Margaritifera, Syst. 1112.) This shell-fish must not be confounded with what is called the <HI>Mother of Pearl Shell,</HI> as that belongs to another genus, is a sea-shell, and an inhabitant of the warmer countries only. The shell-fish in question is found in <HI>rivers,</HI> in all the northern parts of the world; in <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> it abounds; it is found in the rivers of the county of <HI>Tyrone</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in those of <HI>Done∣gall;</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Don</HI> is said to abound with it; and it is not unfrequent in the rivers of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> This fish will bear removal remarkably well; and it is said, that in some places they form reservoirs for the purpose of keeping it, and taking out the pearl, which, in a certain period of time, will be again renewed. From observa∣tions on the growth of these shells, and the num∣ber
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>
of their annular <HI>laminae,</HI> or scales, it is sup∣posed the fish will attain a very great age; 50 or 60 years are imagined to be a moderate computation. The discovery turned on a method, which LIN∣NAEUS found, of putting these muscles into a state of producing pearls at his pleasure; though the final effect did not take place for several years: he says, that in 5 or 6 years after the operation the pearl would have acquired the size of a <HI>Vetch.</HI> We are unacquainted with the means by which he accomplished this extraordinary ope∣ration, but it was probably published at the time, and considered as important, since it is cer∣tain that the author was rewarded with a munifi∣cent <HI>praemium,</HI> from the States of the kingdom, on this account. We regret that we cannot speak more fully on this head; but may ob∣serve, that it is probable, from a paper published many years afterwards in the <HI>Berlin</HI> Acts, that the method consisted in injuring the shell externally, perhaps by a perforation; as it has been observed, that these concretions in shell-fish are found on the inside, exactly opposite to perforations and injuries made from without by <HI>serpulae,</HI> and other animals.</P>
<P>From the time that LINNAEUS and <HI>Rosen</HI> were appointed professors at <HI>Upsal,</HI> it should seem that the credit of that university, as a school of physic, had been increasing; and the fact in∣deed is certain, that numbers of students re∣sorted thither from <HI>Germany,</HI> attracted by the character of these two able men: and certainly in <HI>Sweden</HI> itself, many young men were invited to
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>
the study of physic, by the excellent manner in which it was taught, who otherwise would have engaged in different pursuits. We must not deviate into the line of <HI>Rosen</HI>'s department: suf∣fice it to say, that these two eminent men, by their united zeal and abilities, failed not to exalt, together with their own fame, that of their uni∣versity. LINNAEUS, in teaching the <HI>diagnosis mor∣borum,</HI> had adopted the plan, with some alteration, of M. <HI>Sauvages</HI>'s Nosology, of which we shall be led to give some account hereafter. In the year 1749, he published, for the use of his students, MATERIA MEDICA, <HI>Liber I. de Plantis digestus secundum genera, loca, nomina, qualitates, vires, dif∣ferentias, durationes, simplicia, modos, usus, synony∣ma, culturas, praeparata, potentias, composita.</HI> Holm. 1749, 8<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 252. The compendious method in which this work is executed, and the several useful preliminary papers annexed, render it a very useful and instructive manual to students in medicine. A <HI>materia medica</HI> of the vegetable king∣dom, in which every simple was ascertained by so able a botanist as LINNAEUS, was a very con∣siderable acquisition to science. In this volume are arranged 535 subjects, and several are for the first time reduced to their proper <HI>genera;</HI> such are the <HI>Ipecacuanha, Pareira brava, Coculi Indici,</HI> and others. The method pursued in this volume is as follows. The author gives,</P>
<P N="1">1. His own specific character of the plant.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>C. Bauhine</HI>'s synonym: or, if the plant was unknown to him, that of the first discoverer.</P>
<P N="3">3. The country where it is produced. In
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
the same line is expressed, by a single epithet, whether it be an <HI>herb, shrub,</HI> or <HI>tree:</HI> whether it be <HI>annual, biennial,</HI> or <HI>perennial:</HI> also, whether it be <HI>indigenous;</HI> or if not, whether it thrives well by common cultivation in gardens, or requires de∣fence from the cold of the winter in <HI>Sweden;</HI> or whether it will not endure that climate.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Swedish officinal</HI> name, what part is in use, or what preparation of it, if any; and the doses of each.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>sensible</HI> quality of the plant; whether <HI>bitter, aromatic, acid, astringent,</HI> &amp;c.; whether <HI>fra∣grant, foetid,</HI> or <HI>inodorous;</HI> whether <HI>gummy, resinous,</HI> or <HI>milky.</HI> Its reputed quality; whether <HI>uncertain, well-known,</HI> and <HI>approved;</HI> or whether to be cau∣tiously used. Whether chiefly used in physic, or for culinary purposes.</P>
<P N="6">6. Its reputed effects on the human body, whether <HI>purging, emetic, diuretic,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7. The diseases in which it is most frequently prescribed.</P>
<P N="8">8. The compound medicines into which it en∣ters in the <HI>Swedish</HI> dispensatory.</P>
<P>At the end of the volume is an <HI>index morborum,</HI> with the simples appropriated to each: and an <HI>index virium,</HI> adapted to a preceding classification, founded on their qualities or effects, either on the solids or fluids of the human body.</P>
<P>In the year 1749 was published the first volume of a collection of <HI>Theses</HI> in 8<SUP>o</SUP>, under the title of <HI>Amoenitates Academicae, seu Dissertationes variae, phy∣sicae, medicae, et botanicae.</HI> This publication has
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>
been continued, from time to time, to the com∣pletion of the seventh volume in the year 1769. <HI>Holm.</HI> These volumes, as soon as published, were constantly reprinted in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Hol∣land.</HI> As these academical dissertations were sustained under LINNAEUS in his professorial character, and were selected by himself, they have been regarded as of equal authority nearly with his own writings; and many of them do in a particular manner extend and exemplify divers parts of his works, the subjects having been pointed out by himself, in many instances, for that purpose. For these reasons we shall, in the course of this volume, give a very brief ac∣count of the purport of each dissertation, since they contain a great variety of curious intelligence on the subjects of physic and natural history, every where digested in the most scientific taste.</P>
<P>Whilst LINNAEUS was meditating one of his capital performances, which had long been ex∣pected, and greatly wished for, he was interrupted by a very long and painful fit of the gout, which left him in a very weak and dispirited state; and, according to the intelligence that his friends gave of him, nothing was thought to have contributed more to the restoration of his spirits, than the seasonable acquisition, at this juncture, of a col∣lection of rare and undescribed plants.</P>
<P>Upon the recovery of his health, he published his book; PHILOSOPHIA BOTANICA <HI>in qua expli∣cantur fundamenta botanica cum definitionibus partium, exemplis terminorum, observationibus rariorum, ad∣jectis</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
<HI>figuris aeneis.</HI> Stockh. et Amst. 1751, 8<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 362, <HI>tab.</HI> 11. This must be considered as the in∣stitutions of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> system of botany, and is a work which none, who wish to be acquainted with the sexual system, can be without, as it is the author's own comment on his <HI>Fundamenta,</HI> first published in 1736, and which are comprized in 365 aphorisms, divided into 12 chapters. The author's original intention was to have explained all these aphorisms at large, in the manner that had been done in the <HI>Bibliotheca Botanica, Classes Plantarum, Sponsalia Plantarum, Critica Botanica,</HI> and <HI>Vires Plantarum;</HI> but he says his numerous avocations did not allow him requisite time.</P>

<PB N="49" REF="54"/>
Of the <HI>umbelliferous</HI> plants, such as grow in <HI>dry</HI> places are aromatic, and considered as sudorifics and carminatives: those growing in <HI>watery</HI> places, on the contrary, are mostly of a quality to be justly suspected, and not a few of them quite <HI>noxious.</HI> Plants of the <HI>papilionaceous</HI> class are all excellent food for cattle.

<P>In this work of LINNAEUS it is difficult to de∣termine, whether we ought most to admire the ge∣nius of its author in his inventive power, or that exquisite scientific arrangement which he has given to the whole; and which, both together, constitute this a most excellent performance.</P>

<P>In 1753, appeared the Professor's <Q REND="margQuotes"><HI>Opus maximum et aeternum,</HI></Q> the SPECIES PLANTARUM <HI>exhibentes Plantas rite cognitas, ad genera relatas, cum differentiis specificis, nominibus trivialibus, synonymis selectis, locis natalibus, secundum systema sexuale di∣gestas.</HI> Tom. II. <HI>Holm.</HI> 8<SUP>o</SUP>, 1753, pp. 1200; and a second time in 1762, pp. 1684. To give this work its utmost perfection, had been the author's object for many years, and to this all his other bota∣nic productions are in some measure only prepara∣tory; especially the <HI>local</HI> catalogues; as the rightly ascertaining the <HI>species</HI> is the great object of all me∣thod. In this work <HI>Linnaeus</HI> takes in every plant that had come sufficiently under his <HI>own</HI> inspec∣tion; seldom admitting any on the authority of others; and wheresoever he has done it, the plant is distinguished by a proper mark. The plan of this work is, in general, agreeable to that of all his other local catalogues; no other part of the system being exemplified except the <HI>species:</HI> and as it is entirely botanical, none of the uses of the plants are here introduced. Every plant has its <HI>specific</HI> name, constructed according to the rules established in the eighth part of the <HI>Philo∣sophia Botanica,</HI> with a reference to all, or any of his own works, in which it has been mentioned be∣fore;
<PB N="51" REF="56"/>
and the synonym is given, if it be different from the present. Then follow the synonyms of the best authors, and constantly, where the plant is at all rare, or newly-discovered, there is a reference to the best figures. The country in which the plant grows is then added, and frequently a sym∣bol, expressive of its duration, whether annual, biennial, or perennial.</P>
<P>In this work, for the first time, the professor has given to each plant, what he calls a <HI>trivial</HI> name: that is, a single epithet, which may be ex∣pressive, as far as possible, of the <HI>essential specific</HI> difference, among the species of the genus: this, however, can take place but rarely; in other in∣stances it is expressive of some, the most striking and obvious difference; and not seldom it is a lo∣cal term; or the name of the first discoverer. The latter method, could it have taken place, would have had the advantage of conveying, somewhat like a chronological history of each plant, and at the same time perpetuating due credit to the dis∣coverer. These <HI>trivial</HI> names are printed in the margin, to catch the eye instantly, which is a great advantage. The invention of trivial names, the hint of which was probably borrowed from <HI>Rivini,</HI> by assisting the memory, has much promoted the knowledge of plants, and must be considered as a capital improvement. Their use in speaking of plants, and forming compendious catalogues, has been acknowledged by every botanist since the introduction of them.</P>
<P>In the preface the author gives an ample ac∣count of the assistances he received, and of the
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>
pains he had taken, to bring this work to its pre∣sent state. To this end, he specifies, the coun∣tries he had travelled over; the many botanic gardens he had visited; the various excellent <HI>her∣baria</HI> that he had examined, in <HI>Sweden, Holland, England,</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> the names of his pupils educated under him, and their various peregrina∣tions; from all which he reaped great advantages, as from these he received various new plants: and, finally, he acknowledges the many liberal communications of seeds and specimens, sent to him from all parts of the world by the first bota∣nists of the time.</P>
<P>As this work contains all the plants of the known world which had come to <HI>Linnaeus</HI>'s knowledge, or rather inspection; which, at the publication of these volumes, appear to have amounted to about 7,300 species, all varieties excluded, the professed botanist has only to regret, that it could not have been extended by the author himself, to a com∣pleat <HI>pinax,</HI> and <HI>history</HI> of every plant therein de∣scribed.</P>
<P>In this year also LINNAEUS published MUSEUM TESSINIANUM, <HI>opera Ill. Comitis C. G.</HI> TESSIN, <HI>Regis Regnique Senatoris, &amp;c. &amp;c. collectum.</HI> Holm. 1753, fol. pp. 90. tab. 12. This is a description of the cabinet of LINNAEUS'S first patron and great friend <HI>Count Tessin,</HI> at that time preceptor to the Prince Royal, now King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who had spared no expence in collecting a rich museum, principally consisting of subjects in mineralogy, and particu∣cularly abounding in fossils of the figured or ex∣traneous kind. The work is in <HI>Swedish</HI> and <HI>Latin;</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="58"/>
and the tables represent several scarce and very valuable <HI>figured fossils,</HI> not to be seen elsewhere.</P>
<P>The petrifactions or figured fossils in this work, are arranged in four orders, founded on the dif∣ferent modes of the formation of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fossilia,</HI> commonly so called; shells, corals, animal remains, unchanged, except by being de∣prived more or less of the connecting animal gluten.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Redintegrata.</HI> Earthy, stony, or chrystalline fossils, formed within any crustaceous or testaceous body, as in a mould; thus retaining the cast, without the external coat.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Impressa.</HI> Impressions only: as of fishes and capillary plants, or ferns, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Transubstantiata.</HI> Perfect petrifactions, in which the original organic parts are perfectly filled up with stony particles, and retaining the exact structure, externally and internally, of the origi∣nal body.</P>
<P>In 1754 was published MUSEUM REGIS ADOL∣PHI <HI>Suecorum, &amp;c. in quo Animalia rariora, imprimis et exotica Quadrupedia, Aves, Amphibia, Pisces, In∣secta, Vermes describuntur et determinantur, Latine et Suetice.</HI> Fol. 1754, pp. 135. tab. 33. This splen∣did volume is frequently referred to by our author in his <HI>Systema,</HI> on account of the figures of so many of the rarer serpents, and fishes, here engraven. Of the former there are 48 species, and of the lat∣ter 32; specimens of which are all preserved in spirits in the royal museum; in the palace of <HI>Ulricksdahl.</HI></P>
<P>The fame which our author had now acquired
<PB N="54" REF="59"/>
by his <HI>Systema Naturae,</HI> of which a sixth edition, much enlarged, had been published at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in 1748, in 8<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 232, with eight tables, expla∣natory of the classes and orders; and which was also republished by <HI>Gronovius</HI> at <HI>Leyden;</HI> had brought, as it were, a conflux of every thing rare and valuable in every branch of nature, from all parts of the globe, into <HI>Sweden.</HI> The king and queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> had their separate collections of rarities; the former at <HI>Ulricksdahl,</HI> as hath just been mentioned; the latter, very rich in exotic insects and shells, procured at a great expence, at the palace of <HI>Drottningholm.</HI> These our author was employed in arranging and describing. Be∣sides these, the <HI>museum</HI> of the royal academy of <HI>Upsal</HI> had been augmented by a considerable do∣nation from the king, whilst hereditary prince, in 1746; by another, from Count <HI>Gyllenborg,</HI> the year before; by a third, from <HI>M. Grill,</HI> an opulent citizen of <HI>Stockholm.</HI> The contents of these three collections are given in the first volume of the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae.</HI> We mention them here only to shew that LINNAEUS now began to enjoy ample resources in every branch of natural history at home; besides that many ingenious men, who had been educated under him, were now dispersed into various quarters of the globe; and that from their letters he received great intelligence and satisfaction. Seeds and specimens of plants were sent him from <HI>Siberia,</HI> by <HI>Gmelin;</HI> from <HI>America,</HI> by Dr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> and Governor <HI>Coldingham;</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> by Mr. COLLINSON; Mr. <HI>Ellis;</HI> as also from his friends in <HI>Holland,</HI> and various other parts
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>
of <HI>Europe.</HI> And thus it will be seen, that he be∣gan scarcely to feel the disadvantages of his northern situation.</P>
<P>We shall now also begin to see the professor in a more elevated rank and situation in life. His reputation had already procured him ho∣nours from almost all the Royal Societies in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> Into the <HI>Imperial Academy,</HI> he had been very early received, and distinguished, according to the custom of that institution, with a classic name, having most aptly been called DIOSCORIDES <HI>secun∣dus:</HI> and in the year 1753 he received this honour from the Royal Society of <HI>London;</HI> and his own sovereign, truly sensible of his merit, and greatly esteeming his character and abilities, favoured him with a mark of his distinction and regard, by creating him a KNIGHT of the POLAR STAR. It was now no longer <HI>Laudatur et alget.</HI> His emo∣luments kept pace with his fame and honours; his practice in his profession became lucrative, and we find him soon after possessed of his country house and gardens at <HI>Hammarby,</HI> about five miles from <HI>Upsal.</HI> He had moreover received one of the most flattering testimonies of the extent and magnitude of his fame, that perhaps was ever shewn to any literary character, the state of the nation which conferred it, with all its circumstances, duly considered. This was an invitation to <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI> from the king of <HI>Spain,</HI> there to preside as a naturalist, with the offer of an annual pension for life of 2000 pistoles, letters of nobility, and the perfect free exercise of his own religion. An offer not readily parallelled in the history of modern
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>
times! That he did not accept of it is cer∣tain, having, after the most perfect acknowledg∣ments of the singular honour done him, returned for answer, <Q REND="margQuotes">that, if he had any merits, they were due to his own country.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1755, the Royal Academy of Sciences at <HI>Stockholm</HI> honoured our professor with one of the first premiums, agreeably to the will of Count <HI>Sparre;</HI> who had decreed two gold medals, of ten ducats value each, to be annually given by the academy, to the authors of such papers, in the preceding year's <HI>Stockholm</HI> Acts, as should be ad∣judged most useful in promoting agriculture par∣ticularly, and all branches of rural oeconomy. This medal bore on one side, the arms of the Count, with this motto—<HI>Superstes in Scientiis amor</HI> FREDE∣RICI SPARRE.—LINNAEUS obtained it in consequence of a paper <HI>de Plantis, quae Alpium Suecicarum in∣digenae, magno rei oeconomicae et medicae emolumento fieri possint,</HI> and the ultimate intention was to re∣commend these plants, as adapted to culture in <HI>Lapland.</HI> This paper was inserted in the <HI>Stockholm</HI> Acts for 1754. Vol. XV.</P>
<P><HI>LINNAEUS also obtained the</HI> praemium centum au∣reorum, <HI>proposed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences at</HI> Petersburgh, <HI>for the best paper written to</HI> establish, <HI>or</HI> disprove, <HI>by</HI> new <HI>arguments, the doc∣trine of the sexes of plants. On this occasion the professor wrote his DISQUISITIO</HI> de quaestione ab Acad. Imper. Scient. Petrop. in annum <HI>1759</HI> pro praemio proposita: <HI>SEXUM PLANTARUM</HI> argumentis et experi∣mentis novis, praeter adhuc jam cognita, vel corroborare vel impugnare, praemissa expositione historica et physica
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>
omnium Plantae partium, quae aliquid ad faecundationem et perfectionem seminis, et fructus conferre credun∣tur; ab eadem Academia die <HI>6</HI> Sept. <HI>1760,</HI> in con∣ventu publico praemio ornata. Petrop. <HI>1760, 4<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 32.</HI></P>
<P>Apart from all foregoing arguments, facts, and experiments, brought in support of this question, the professor has in this little tract sufficiently proved, by a series of <HI>new</HI> facts, that the dust of the <HI>Antherae,</HI> analogically called the male parts, is absolutely necessary to be shed on the <HI>stigma</HI> or female part, in order to render the seed fertile. His theory of vegetation, prefixed to this paper, is explained more at large in the <HI>Prolepsis Planta∣rum,</HI> printed in the 6th volume of the <HI>Amoenitates.</HI></P>
<P>It was, if possible, an additional glory to LIN∣NAEUS to have merited this premium from the <HI>Peters∣burgh</HI> academy; inasmuch as a professor of that society, a few years before, had with more than common zeal, although with a futility like that of the other antagonists of our author, endeavoured to overturn the whole <HI>Linnaean</HI> system of botany, by attempting to shew that the doctrine of the sexes of plants, had no foundation in nature, and was unsupported by facts and experiments.</P>
<P>The great character of LINNAEUS, and that of his colleagues, particularly of <HI>Rosen,</HI> in the medical departments, and their united endea∣vours, had very considerably raised the credit of the university of <HI>Upsal,</HI> as we have before ob∣served. It is certain, that the number of stu∣dents are, at this time, nearly double what they are said to have been in accounts written 30 and
<PB N="58" REF="63"/>
40 years ago. The emulation excited among the students amply rewarded those gentlemen for their pains, by the vast harvest of useful information flowing in, particularly on the subjects of natural history, from their pupils, now dispersed in every part of the world. Many of these young men, after being properly grounded in the principles of physic, had, with an ardour which nothing but the strongest love of science could inspire, volun∣tarily undertaken the most distant and perilous voyages, supported by the munificence of parti∣cular patrons or societies, to gratify their taste in the pursuits of natural history, and other useful knowledge. Several of these young men perish∣ed, from change of climate, or various other causes, and much of the fruit of their labour was lost with them. Such was the fate of <HI>Ternströem,</HI> at <HI>Pulicandor,</HI> in 1745; of <HI>Hasselquist,</HI> who went into <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Palestine,</HI> and died at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> in 1752; of <HI>Loefling,</HI> who died in <HI>Cumana,</HI> in 1756. Of the first of these we have no remains. The papers of <HI>Hasselquist</HI> were redeemed by the queen of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and published by LINNAEUS, under the title of ITER PALAESTINUM, in 1757, in 8<SUP>o</SUP>; and those of <HI>Loefling,</HI> under the title of ITER HISPANICUM, in 1758; to each of which is pre∣fixed a short account of the author. We have also the fruit of <HI>Kalm</HI>'s journey in <HI>N. America,</HI> and of the voyage of <HI>Osbeck</HI> and <HI>Toren,</HI> who both went chap∣lains to <HI>Swedish East India</HI> ships. These are here mentioned particularly, as they are all translated, and published since in the <HI>English</HI> language. We yet deplore the more recent fate of <HI>Forskal,</HI> and his
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>
unfortunate associates, in <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the more so, since his posthumous pieces, published at <HI>Copen∣hagen</HI> in 1775, are sufficient to convince us, that the fruit of that expedition would have been rich and large, had it not been so unfortunately blasted.</P>
<P>There were also several others, who made less remote journies for the same purpose; such were <HI>L. Montin,</HI> who visited <HI>Lula-Lapmark</HI> in 1749; <HI>M. Koehler,</HI> who travelled into the southern part of <HI>Italy</HI> in 1752; Dr. SOLANDER, who visited <HI>Pitho-Lapmark,</HI> and <HI>Torno-Lapmark,</HI> in 1753, where he made several discoveries, and brought back divers rare plants, and other subjects in natural history, which had escaped the diligence of his great master; <HI>D. Rolander,</HI> who visited <HI>Surinam</HI> and <HI>St. Eustatia,</HI> in 1755; <HI>A. R. Martin,</HI> who searched <HI>Greenland</HI> in 1758, as <HI>C. Alstroëmer</HI> did the southern parts of <HI>Europe</HI> in 1760. We do not mention others, who re-visited the isle of <HI>Gothland</HI> in 1752 and 1760, after <HI>Linnaeus</HI>'s own tour into that place.</P>
<P>The travels of these gentlemen afforded great sources of information, and furnished ma∣terials for our author, that proved very favour∣able to the last editions of his <HI>Systema Naturae,</HI> and <HI>Species Plantarum:</HI> insomuch, that we shall see him exemplifying, in a much more perfect and de∣tailed manner, his <HI>System of Nature.</HI></P>
<P>This work, as far as respected the <HI>vegetable</HI> kingdom, had been separately and largely exhi∣bited, as before mentioned, in the <HI>Genera Plan∣tarum,</HI> and the <HI>species</HI> given in the several <HI>Florae</HI> of
<PB N="60" REF="65"/>
our author, and finally in the <HI>Species Plantarum.</HI> As yet, however, although it had passed through nine editions, little more had appeared in the <HI>ani∣mal</HI> kingdom than the generical characters, with a single specific name; insomuch that the ninth edition at <HI>Leyden,</HI> in 1756, was contained in a small octavo of 226 pages. This it must be ob∣served notwithstanding, was only a republication of the author's sixth edition in 1748. The scheme therefore cannot be considered as perfected by the author, until the publication of the 10th edition, in 1758, the first part of which, relating to the animal kingdom, makes a volume of 821 pages; and the same part, in the 12th and last edition, is augmented by the addition of new subjects to 1327 pages. This work therefore, published in two volumes at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in 1766 and 1767, is to be considered as having received the author's finishing hand, as far as possible, since he pro∣fesses to describe only such <HI>animals</HI> as had fallen under his own inspection, except in some instances, where his dependence upon other authority ren∣dered it justifiable. The title of this enlarged edition runs thus:</P>
<P><HI>SYSTEMA NATURAE</HI> per regna tria Naturae secun∣dum classes, ordines, genera et species, cum charac∣teribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. <HI>Holm. 1766, I. 1767, II. 1768, III.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TOM. I. <HI>The</HI> ANIMAL KINGDOM.</HEAD>
<P>In this volume, after a philosophical history of the animal kingdom in general, our author pro∣ceeds to the establishment of the classical cha∣racters;
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
previous to which, he presents us with the <HI>natural</HI> division of animals, arising from their different <HI>internal structure;</HI> an arrangement partly established by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and of which our own great naturalist Mr. RAY has made considerable use, in the introductory part of his <HI>Synopsis Ani∣malium.</HI> By this division all the animal kingdom naturally falls into six classes, as follow: animals having the

<P>He then gives the <HI>natural</HI> characters at large of each class, taking in with the foregoing internal structure, all the differences arising from the <HI>lungs,</HI> or other organs of respiration, as <HI>gills:</HI> from the <HI>maxillae,</HI> jaws or mandibles: the organs of <HI>genera∣tion:</HI> those of <HI>sensation:</HI> the <HI>teguments,</HI> or outward covering: and the <HI>fulcra,</HI> or legs, wings, &amp;c. Our plan does not admit of introducing these at large.</P>
<P>At the head of each class is given a concise and most instructive <HI>description</HI> of the <HI>classical</HI> cha∣racter; so methodically constructed, as to include at the same time an explanation of all the <HI>terms</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>
appertaining to that class, concluding with a ge∣neral mention of the best authors thereon.</P>
<P>After this, our author proceeds to the establishment of the <HI>natural</HI> characters of each <HI>order</HI> of the class respectively. These also we must omit, as incon∣sistent with our compendious view of the system, and more especially the latter classes of this king∣dom, where the subjects are so numerous: but in the four first classes we propose to give the <HI>artificial</HI> generical characters as they stand at the head of each order.</P>
<DIV3 N="1 (mammals)" TYPE="class">
<HEAD>Class I. MAMMALIA.</HEAD>
<P>This class comprehends not only all the animals which we call <HI>Quadrupeds</HI> (the <HI>Lizard</HI> genus, or rather the <HI>reptiles Pedati,</HI> excepted) but also the <HI>cetaceous</HI> order, or Whales, Cachalots, and Porpesses. This arrangement of Whales with Quadrupeds, which did not take place in the first editions of this work, has not been relished by some very respectable Zoologists who wrote be∣fore LINNAEUS; but our author thinks himself fully justified on account of the agreement of these animals in the <HI>structure of the heart,</HI> in the respiration by means of <HI>lungs,</HI> in their hav∣ing <HI>moveable eyelids, ears,</HI> in being <HI>viviparous,</HI> in being furnished with <HI>teats,</HI> and in other parti∣culars, by which they differ so materially from <HI>fishes,</HI> as to more than balance that single agree∣ment in living in the same <HI>element.</HI></P>
<P>The MAMMALIA are divided by our author into seven <HI>orders;</HI> the distinctions of which are, in this <HI>artificial</HI> arrangement, principally established on
<PB N="63" REF="68"/>
the difference in the <HI>number,</HI> situation, and form, of the three kinds of teeth, namely, the <HI>primores</HI> or <HI>incisores,</HI> called <HI>fore-teeth,</HI> or <HI>cutting</HI> teeth; the <HI>laniarii</HI> or <HI>canini,</HI> called dog-teeth, <HI>canine,</HI> or lace∣rating teeth; and the <HI>molares,</HI> double teeth or <HI>grinders.</HI> LINNAEUS, notwithstanding, does not entirely neglect the <HI>feet,</HI> as will appear from his description of the <HI>natural</HI> characters of the <HI>orders,</HI> as well as from the following <HI>systematic</HI> arrangement, of this class.</P>

<P>Howsoever the pride of man may be offended at the idea of being ranked with the beasts that perish, he nevertheless stands as <HI>an animal,</HI> in the system of nature, at the head of this <HI>order;</HI> and as such is here described, with his several varieties observable in the different quarters of the globe, in a manner, and with an accuracy, peculiar to our author, and which we may venture to say, is no where else to be met with.

<P>The <HI>specific</HI> characters in the class of <HI>birds</HI> are deduced from a great variety of particulars. In several, as in the <HI>Falcon</HI> genus, the colour of the <HI>cere,</HI> or naked tunic that surrounds the basis of the <HI>beak,</HI> and the colour of the legs, assist in distin∣guishing the species. The <HI>colour</HI> of the bird in general is subject to great variation in different countries, as well as in the same country at dif∣ferent
<PB N="84" REF="89"/>
seasons in the year, as is more particularly seen in the arctic regions; not to mention that of the sexes in almost all kinds. Our author therefore does not trust to this, wherever a more permanent mark can be found. It must, however, be con∣fessed, that in too many instances, it is necessary to trust entirely to this distinction, howsoever un∣stable. The form of the <HI>tail,</HI> as it happens to be <HI>even, cuneated,</HI> or <HI>forked,</HI> is an excellent and firm note; in the <HI>Parrot</HI> genus its length, as <HI>shorter</HI> or <HI>longer</HI> than the body, is of great service. In others, the <HI>colour</HI> of the <HI>beak,</HI> a <HI>naked</HI> or <HI>crested head,</HI> con∣tribute to form the note of distinction. And in fine, nature has stamped upon others some pecu∣liarity, which points them out immediately; as, the <HI>receptacle</HI> of the lower mandible, in the <HI>Pelican;</HI> two long <HI>tail-feathers,</HI> in the <HI>Tropic-bird;</HI> the di∣rection of the mandibles in the <HI>Cross-beak,</HI> &amp;c. Among the common marks, none more frequently occur than the differences of colour in the <HI>quill∣feathers</HI> and those of the <HI>tail.</HI> This class compre∣hends upwards of 930 subjects.</P>

<P>This part of the System contains upwards of 290 subjects.</P>
<P>In the REPTILES order, the specific characters of the <HI>Testudo</HI> genus are deduced principally from the difference in the <HI>shells,</HI> and the <HI>feet;</HI> which in the <HI>Turtles</HI> are pinniform, and in the <HI>Tortoises</HI> di∣gitated. In the <HI>Lacerta</HI> genus, from the <HI>tail, head, toes,</HI> and various other parts; and in the <HI>Rana,</HI> from the diversity in the <HI>make of the body,</HI> and number of the <HI>claws</HI> on the fore or hinder feet.</P>
<P>In the SERPENTES order, the specific distinctions have ever been matter of great difficulty with naturalists, as they were commonly taken from the <HI>colour,</HI> which is subject to an almost infinite variation. Hence it has happened that <HI>Seba,</HI> de∣pending on the <HI>colours</HI> alone, hath, in the opinion of our author, figured the <HI>Boa Constrictor,</HI> or Gi∣gantic Serpent, ten times, as so many distinct spe∣cies; and the <HI>Coluber Naga,</HI> or Hooded Viper, fourteen, LINNAEUS at length discovered a much

more certain and permanent note, upon which his <HI>specific</HI> characters are solely founded: it was first exemplified in the <HI>Amphibia Gyllenborgiana,</HI> and he has since retained it in all his works, sensible however that it is yet liable to failure: this arises from the number of the small <HI>shields</HI> and <HI>scales,</HI> or <HI>rings</HI> and <HI>rugae</HI> of the belly and tail; and the pro∣portion those numbers bear to each other in the different species: for example, in our <HI>Common Viper</HI> the <HI>shields</HI> of the <HI>belly</HI> are usually about 146, and the <HI>scales</HI> of the <HI>tail,</HI> that is all below the anus, about 39 or 40: the <HI>shields</HI> in our <HI>Common Snake</HI> about 170, and the <HI>scales</HI> about 60.</P>
<P>In the NANTES the specific characters are short, but very various in the different <HI>genera,</HI> as to the parts of the animal from which they are deduced: in the <HI>Petromyzon</HI> and <HI>Raia,</HI> from the <HI>mouth, fins, teeth,</HI> &amp;c.; in the latter very much from the <HI>body</HI> itself: in the <HI>Squalus,</HI> from a variety of parti∣culars: in the <HI>Acipenser,</HI> from the <HI>cirri</HI> or beard, and the <HI>dorsal shields,</HI> or <HI>squamae:</HI> in the <HI>Balistes,</HI> from the fins and tail: in the <HI>Ostracion,</HI> from the different <HI>angulated form</HI> of the <HI>body:</HI> in the <HI>Tetrodon,</HI> from differences in the body chiefly; and in the remaining <HI>genera,</HI> from the form of the body, and the differences in the fins.</P>

<P>The class of Fishes contains about 400 species, but very great additions have been made to this class by later discoveries: among which those made by Dr. <HI>Forskal,</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> are not the least, as appears by his fragments lately published.</P>
<P>Great pains were taken by <HI>Artedi,</HI> and since by <HI>Gronovius,</HI> and our author, to distinguish the species by the <HI>number</HI> of the <HI>rays</HI> in the <HI>fins;</HI> and although, from repeated observations, they are found to agree in many species very re∣markably; yet, in others, they vary so much as not to establish a sufficient character. At present, in this system, the specifical characters are taken from a great variety of particulars; amongst which, however, the <HI>number</HI> of the <HI>rays</HI> in the <HI>fins</HI> is frequently the most distinctive, and whe∣ther so or not, it is subjoined to most species, and usually, as they have been observed by different authors. The <HI>form</HI> of the <HI>tail,</HI> the <HI>cirri,</HI> or beard at the <HI>mouth,</HI> the <HI>length</HI> of the <HI>jaw,</HI> the <HI>spots</HI> and

<HEAD>Class V. INSECTA. INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>No part of the system of nature has undergone a greater change than this class; neither does our author stand more unrivalled, than in the excel∣lent arrangement he has given to this branch of natural history; which, before his time, was nearly without method. It comprehends 87 GENERA, disposed into seven <HI>orders,</HI> founded, in most of them, on the differences observable in the <HI>number</HI> and <HI>texture</HI> of the <HI>wings.</HI> Our intended brevity will not permit a detail of the <HI>genera,</HI> in the suc∣ceeding parts of the system; we must, therefore, now that we are descended to the inferior parts of the animal kingdom, only give the definitions of the several <HI>orders,</HI> with a few observations. The first order is called,</P>
<P N="1">I. COLEOPTERA. Insects having the wings co∣vered with two crustaceous cases, divided by a longitudinal suture.</P>
<P>This order is the most numerous; it contains almost all those insects which go under the general name of <HI>Beetles:</HI> and includes upwards of 900 species, ranked under 30 genera. Among these are the Chafers, Stag-beetles, Leather-eaters, Car∣rion-beetles, Tortoise-beetles, Lady-flies, Honey-beetles, Weevils, Musk-beetles, Glow-worm, Spring-beetles, Water-beetles, Blister-beetle, Rove-beetle, Earwig, and several other <HI>genera.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. HEMIPTERA. Half-winged insects; having the shells or cases semi-crustaceous, not divided by
<PB N="102" REF="107"/>
a straight suture, but incumbent on each other in the margin. The beak curved inwards.</P>
<P>This order contains about 350 species, under 12 <HI>genera;</HI> among these are the Cock-roach, Camel-cricket, Locusts and Common Crickets, Lan∣thorn-fly, Flea-locust, Boat-fly, &amp;c. Bug, a nu∣merous genus; Aphis, or Currant-louse; Cochi∣neal-insect, and others.</P>
<P N="3">III. LEPIDOPTERA. Insects with four wings, imbricated or cloathed with fine scales or feathers: tongue spiral, and coiled up; body hairy.</P>
<P>This order contains only three <HI>genera;</HI> but the species are very numerous, nearly 800. The But∣terflies, Hawk-moths, and the Moths or <HI>Phalenae.</HI> Of the latter, LINNAEUS enumerates 460 species. This being the most beautiful tribe of insects, has been much sought after, and later entomologists have considerably increased this number.</P>
<P N="4">IV. NEUROPTERA. Insects with 4 naked, trans∣parent, or reticulated wings; tail in most kinds without a sting.</P>
<P>Upwards of 80 species in 7 <HI>genera;</HI> among these are the Dragon-fly, May-fly, Spring-fly, Pearl-fly, Scorpion-fly, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">V. HYMENOPTERA, Insects with 4 membra∣naceous wings, excepting some few species, which are destitute of wings; females with the tail armed with a sting.</P>
<P>This is a numerous order; it contains 320 in∣sects in 10 <HI>genera;</HI> among these are the Saw-fly or <HI>Tenthredo,</HI> Tailed-wasp, Ichneumon-fly, Ichneu∣mon-wasp, Wasp, Bee, Ant, and Golden Wall-fly, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="103" REF="108"/>
VI. DIPTERA. Insects with two wings; fur∣nished also with a balance or club behind each wing.</P>
<P>This order, under 10 <HI>genera,</HI> contains near 270 species, among which are the Gad-flies, Gnats, Common Flesh-fly, Wasp-fly, Horse-fly, Bee-fly, and others.</P>
<P N="7">VII. APTERA. Insects without wings, in either sex.</P>
<P>This order contains 290 species under 14 <HI>genera,</HI> and falls easily into three divisions.</P>
<P N="1">1. With 6 legs: The Sugar-mite, Ground-flea, Death-watch, Louse, Common Flea.</P>
<P N="2">2. With 8 to 11 legs: The Tick-spiders, Scor∣pion, Crab, King-crab, and Millepede.</P>
<P N="3">3. With numerous legs: The Centipede and Gallyworm.</P>
<P>In forming the <HI>genera</HI> under each of these or∣ders, the <HI>antennae</HI> hold a principal rank, and par∣ticularly in the COLEOPTERA; but the author does not trust to them alone; the <HI>elytra</HI> or out∣ward cases, the head, the <HI>rostrum</HI> or mouth, the thorax, and tail; and indeed in almost every <HI>genus,</HI> some or other of them are called in to assist in forming the character.</P>
<P>In the HEMIPTERA, the <HI>rostrum</HI> gives a note of primary use; but here the <HI>antennae, wings,</HI> and <HI>feet</HI> come in also.</P>
<P>In the LEPIDOPTERA, the <HI>antennae</HI> and wings form the character.</P>
<P>In the NEUROPTERA, the mouth, wings, and tail.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="109"/>
In the HYMENOPTERA, the mouth, the wings, and the sting.</P>
<P>In the DIPTERA, the mouth or <HI>proboscis</HI> alone.</P>
<P>In the APTERA, the eyes, the tail, and the num∣ber of the feet, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6 (vermes)" TYPE="class">
<HEAD>Class VI. VERMES.</HEAD>
<P>The sixth and last class contains the VERMES, which are divided into five orders. LINNAEUS very early adopted the new system of <HI>Peysonnel, Jussieu,</HI> and some others, in introducing the corals and corallines into the animal kingdom, under the names of LITHOPHYTA and ZOOPHYTA. This system has had great light thrown upon it by the late excellent Mr. ELLIS, in his history of Coral∣lines, and several papers printed in the Philosophi∣cal Transactions.</P>
<P>As this is by far the most anomalous of all the classes, the characters of the orders are very va∣rious.</P>
<P N="1">1. INTESTINA. Animals simple, naked, desti∣tute of limbs.</P>
<P>This order includes 7 <HI>genera;</HI> among which are the Guinea-worm, Ascarides, Earth-worm, Gourd∣worm, Leech, &amp;c. It contains but 24 species.</P>
<P N="2">II. MOLLUSCA. Animals simple, naked, not in∣cluded in a shell, but furnished with limbs.</P>
<P>This order includes 18 <HI>genera,</HI> containing 110 species. Among these rank the common naked Snail, Sea Hare of <HI>Rondeletius, Doris,</HI> Sea Mouse, <HI>Nereis, Ascidia, Actinia,</HI> or Sea Anemone, <HI>Tethys,</HI> Cuttle-fish, Sea Lungs, or Blubbers, Star-fish, and <HI>Echinus,</HI> called Sea Hedge-hog, and others.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="105" REF="110"/>
III. TESTACEA. Animals, generally of the foregoing order, but included in a shell.</P>
<P>This order takes in the whole tribe of shells, consisting of upwards of 800 species, under 36 <HI>genera,</HI> and disposed in a method entirely new. The three first <HI>genera</HI> are the <HI>multivalves,</HI> the next fourteen <HI>bivalves,</HI> and the remainder <HI>univalves.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. LITHOPHYTA. Composite animals, affixed to, and fabricating a fixed calcareous base, called <HI>Coral.</HI></P>
<P>This order contains 59 species, under four <HI>gene∣ra:</HI> the <HI>Tubipora,</HI> red tubular Coral; <HI>Madrepores</HI> or Brain Stones; <HI>Millepores;</HI> and another called <HI>Cel∣lepore.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. ZOOPHYTA. Animal composite, resembling a flower, and springing from a vegetating stem.</P>
<P>This order contains 14 genera, of which nine are fixed, and the other locomotive: amongst the former rank the <HI>Isis</HI> or red Coral, Sea Fan, <HI>Al∣cyonium,</HI> Sponge, Corallines, &amp;c.: among the latter, the Polype, Sea Pens, <HI>Taenia, Furia,</HI> and lastly the assemblage of chaotic, or microscopi∣cal <HI>Animalcula.</HI> The species under this order are 156.</P>
<P>The <HI>generical</HI> distinctions among the INTESTINA arise from the diversity of the body of the animal, almost solely.</P>
<P>In the MOLLUSCA, from the body and feelers, called <HI>tentacula,</HI> and from other parts.</P>
<P>In the TESTACEA, the included animal, the general differences between the shells themselves, but principally the <HI>cardo</HI> or hinge in the bivalves,
<PB N="106" REF="111"/>
and the <HI>aperture</HI> in the univalves, furnish the ge∣neric note.</P>
<P>In the LITHOPHYTA, the inhabitant animal, and the form of the coral itself: and in the ZOOPHYTA, the animal, and the very different forms of the fabrifications, lay a foundation for the generic notes.</P>
<P>After having thus exhibited a view of the <HI>Classes,</HI> it remains that we give a general account of the method pursued in treating on each species. To this end it must be observed, that throughout the whole <HI>system,</HI> the <HI>classical</HI> character, that of the <HI>order,</HI> and the <HI>generical</HI> note, always make a part in the description of each <HI>species.</HI> After these, our author begins with his own <HI>specific</HI> name for the animal, established upon the most essential difference observable between that and every other species of the <HI>genus;</HI> and here it must be allowed, that he has, in general, happily suc∣ceeded, by giving, in the space of two or three lines, a distinction that more immediately points out the animal sought for, than the long and la∣boured descriptions of many foregoing authors. If the <HI>specific</HI> name is the same that is adopted in any of his former writings, he refers to it. He has, however, in many parts of this enlarged edition, formed new names to animals noticed in the former edition, and in the <HI>Fauna Suecica.</HI> Where indeed the essential or specific distinction is the point in view, this must frequently be the case, so long as new species continue to come in; for, as the essential character of each <HI>species</HI> results
<PB N="107" REF="112"/>
from the most careful comparison of the whole <HI>genus,</HI> the introduction of a new one must, in many instances, so clash with the old, as to re∣quire, perhaps, a total alteration in every <HI>specific</HI> name of the <HI>genus.</HI></P>
<P>After his own specific name, he gives the <HI>synonyms,</HI> and page of the most reputed and au∣thentic writers in each class; and particularly re∣fers to those who have best figured his subject; then the <HI>locus natalis,</HI> and in many instances, more especially among the <HI>Mammalia</HI> and <HI>Aves,</HI> a short but comprehensive history respecting the nature, economy, and uses of the animal. To every animal the author has affixed his <HI>trivial</HI> name, expressive, most commonly, of place where it is found, of its colour, form, or some quality or attribute, descriptive, as far as may be, of the ani∣mal; or, in a great variety of cases, where the subject has been well known by a single term, he retains that as his <HI>trivial</HI> name. To instance in the Partridge and Quail, which both belong to his <HI>genus</HI> established under the name <HI>Tetrao:</HI> he therefore calls the former <HI>Tetrao Perdix,</HI> and the latter <HI>Tetrao Coturnix.</HI></P>
<P>It has been objected to LINNAEUS'S classification in various parts of his system, that he has thrown together subjects too different in their general appearance and economy, by keeping too closely to <HI>one</HI> character; to instance particularly in the MAMMALIA, by confining himself to the teeth. To this it may be answered, in general, that if <HI>only</HI> quadrupeds were to be classed, no system
<PB N="108" REF="113"/>
needed to have bee built, as their number is so small: but when it is recollected, that <HI>all Nature</HI> was under his eye, and that therefore the subjects were almost infinite, it became necessary to form the basis of every great division or class, <HI>as far as possible, on one simple foundation.</HI> And perhaps it is the observance of this rule that has given LIN∣NAEUS'S system so greatly the advantage over all foregoing writers. For, as nature does not seem to have observed <HI>any</HI> system, ours must be artificial, and will ever have its anomalies. As an artificial system therefore, that must have the preference, which will most readily lead to the subject under investigation; in which case it is of small im∣portance where it is placed, and how far removed from others with which it seems to bear a similar and general appearance.</P>
<P>We shall close this brief view of the arrangement of animals, by exhibiting the number of subjects enumerated, all of which are synonymed by the author, in the 12th edition of his <HI>System.</HI></P>

<P>With the first tome of the <HI>Systema Naturae</HI> is in∣timately connected a work of the professor's, pub∣lished under the title of MUSEUM <HI>Ludovicae Ulricae</HI> REGINAE, <HI>in quo animalia rariora exotica, imprimis</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="114"/>
<HI>insecta, et conchylia describuntur et determinantur pro∣dromi instar editum.</HI> Holm. 1764, 8<SUP>o</SUP>, pp. 720. This was drawn up, and published, by order of the queen of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who had constructed a copious and rich cabinet of natural history, at the palace of <HI>Drottningholm;</HI> the subjects of which, as hath been observed, LINNAEUS had been appointed to arrange. The great expence her majesty had be∣stowed in procuring, particularly insects and fhells, had given this collection an advantage that proved very favourable to our author, by throwing in his way a multitude of fine and very expensive objects, which otherwise, probably, he could have had no opportunity of describing; and these were, for∣tunately, all collected before the publication of the enlarged editions of the <HI>System.</HI></P>
<P>In this work the <HI>exotic</HI> insects and shells only are introduced; of the former, 436; and of the latter, 434, with twenty-five of the <HI>Mollusca.</HI> The in∣sects chiefly consist of the large and beautiful <HI>Lepidoptera;</HI> and the shells abound with all their elegant varieties. These are described at large, with all that precision, brevity, and accurate ar∣rangement of the several parts, which every where manifests itself so happily in our author's writings. Both in <HI>entomology</HI> and <HI>conchology</HI> a new language is introduced; and these descriptions may well stand as models for future writings.</P>
<P>Annexed to this work is the second part, or rather only the <HI>prodromus,</HI> of the MUSEUM ADOLPHI <HI>Frederici</HI> REGIS, <HI>in quo animalia rariora, imprimis et exotica, aves, amphibia, pisces describuntur.</HI> 1764, pp.

110. In this additional volume are described at large 156 subjects of the animal kingdom, all be∣longing to the first four classes; and all acquired since the publication of the first part in 1754. Throughout the whole <HI>System,</HI> LINNAEUS has referred to these books for descriptions at large to all the exotics: and nothing could be more ac∣ceptable to the critical zoologist, than to see the plan of this volume perfected through the whole history of animals.</P>

<HEAD>TOM. II. The VEGETABLE KINGDOM.</HEAD>
<P>The second part of the <HI>Systema Naturae,</HI> relating to vegetables, in all the editions prior to the tenth, was very compendiously exhibited; the au∣thor having, after his <HI>Clavis Classium,</HI> only given the names of the <HI>genera,</HI> with their <HI>essential</HI> or ab∣breviated characters, without touching at all on specific distinctions, which were reserved for the present enlarged edition of the System, and for the SPECIES PLANTARUM, a work before spoken of. This volume contains upwards of 560 pages; and in the twelfth edition of 1767, by the accession of new materials, is enlarged to 731. It contains, in a most compendious manner, a view of the whole vegetable kingdom, as far as the subjects thereof had come under our author's own inspection, dis∣posed according to that system of which LINNAEUS had been the inventor, founded, as to the classical part, upon the <HI>sexes</HI> of plants; a system now al∣most universally received. It is in this branch
<PB N="111" REF="116"/>
of the study of nature, that this great naturalist has so distinguished himself. From him <HI>botany</HI> boasts a new <HI>aera;</HI> and HALLER, one of the first writers of this age, in the same line of science, and who alone might dare to rival him, has, with a liberality of mind becoming a great man, allowed this supe∣riority to LINNAEUS.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to a particular account of this part of the system, it may not be improper to premise some observations on <HI>methods</HI> of <HI>botany</HI> in general, before our author wrote. It is needless to urge the necessity of <HI>method</HI> in the study of na∣ture, as it is the very soul of science; and, amidst such a multitude of objects which the vegetable kingdom affords, all attempts towards the acqui∣sition of knowledge without it, must end in un∣certainty and confusion. We have sufficient proofs of this in the writers upon plants before the in∣vention of systems, and see and deplore the want of them, in the loss of many valuable articles, not only in the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> but in the <HI>Materia Pictoria,</HI> and <HI>Tinctoria</HI> of the antients. Articles, the virtues and properties of which appear to have been well ascertained, are now lost to us, for want of a more scientific arrangement of the subjects, and accuracy in the descriptions of them.</P>
<P>Botanic writers chose very different methods of arranging plants, not only before, but since, the invention of systematic botany. The <HI>al∣phabetic</HI> has been much followed, especially in local catalogues. Some have disposed the plants according to <HI>the time of flowering;</HI> as <HI>Pauli,</HI> in his
<PB N="112" REF="117"/>
<HI>Quadripartitum Botanicum,</HI> published in 1639; <HI>Bester,</HI> in the <HI>Hortus Eystettensis,</HI> 1640; and <HI>Dil∣lenius,</HI> in the <HI>Catalogus Gissensis,</HI> 1719. Others have arranged them according to the <HI>different places of their growth;</HI> as the authors of the <HI>Historia Lugdu∣nensis,</HI> in 1587: and some according to their <HI>virtues in medicine.</HI> Others again, observing that numbers of vegetables agreed with each other in their general habit and appearance, or had a certain harmony and proportion in the form and disposition of their roots, leaves, flowers, or fruit; in their particular mode of growing, flowering, or foliation, saw that they naturally fell as it were into classes, agree∣able to such distinctions. Hence their division of trees, into <HI>pomiferae, pruniferae, bacciferae, nuciferae, glandiferae,</HI> &amp;c.; of herbs, into <HI>bulbosae, siliquosae∣umbelliferae, verticillatae, papilionaceae,</HI> &amp;c. These were so many <HI>classes</HI> or <HI>orders,</HI> which nature had so characterized that they could not escape their notice; and, could all the subjects of the vegetable kingdom be <HI>properly reduced</HI> to such combinations, and the whole chain <HI>properly connected,</HI> we should then see what is meant by the NATURAL METHOD, that <HI>ultimum et desideratum</HI> of botany, of which our author says, however, <Q REND="margQuotes">Nec sperare fas est, quod nostra Aetas systema quoddam naturale videre queat, et vix seri nepotes.</Q> Nevertheless the best writers of the last century, such were <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Caspar Bauhine,</HI> endeavoured to preserve the above∣mentioned arrangement, although it was in a rude manner. In this they were followed by our own countrymen <HI>Gerard</HI> and <HI>Parkinson,</HI> but as
<PB N="113" REF="118"/>
they established no precise definitions to their classes, so in their subdivisions, or chapters, they paid little or no regard to the minuter parts of distinction, taken from the fructification; hence, nothing like <HI>generical notes</HI> can be discovered in their methods: so that the only resource, in find∣ing many of their plants, was, to read over their long and tedious descriptions, which, after all, were frequently insufficient to distinguish the plant sought for.</P>
<P>That great naturalist <HI>Conrade</HI> GESNER, who died in 1565, in his 50th year, appears to have been the first who thought, with any precision, of a method of classing plants from the <HI>flower,</HI> or <HI>fruit;</HI> but he only slightly touches thereon in his epistles; he lived not to bring any thing to perfection in this way. It was reserved for <HI>Caesalpinus,</HI> physician to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. to be the first author who arranged plants in a true systematic manner, in his <HI>Libri de Plantis,</HI> published in 1583, in which he establishes the characters principally <HI>from the fruit.</HI> It is wonderful, that after his time, though so many eminent botanists flourished, among whom were the two <HI>Bauhines,</HI> no one ever thought of pursu∣ing the plan he laid down, until <HI>Morison</HI> and <HI>Ray,</HI> who both published, nearly together, their separate systems, founded also upon dis∣tinctions principally drawn from the fruit. Since their time, others have laboured to bring their systems to perfection; as <HI>Knaut</HI> in <HI>Germany; Paul Herman,</HI> and <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> in <HI>Holland;</HI> and <HI>Dillenius,</HI> late professor at <HI>Oxford,</HI> had still far∣ther
<PB N="114" REF="119"/>
perfected Mr. <HI>Ray</HI>'s method, as is evident from the arrangement he has given to the <HI>British</HI> plants, in the third edition of that author's <HI>Synopsis.</HI></P>
<P>Several elegant systems have also been formed from the <HI>flower,</HI> as the basis of the <HI>classical</HI> cha∣racter; in considering which, both the <HI>regularity</HI> and <HI>irregularity,</HI> as well as the <HI>number</HI> of the <HI>petals,</HI> have been made the principal distinction. <HI>Rivini,</HI> at <HI>Leipsic,</HI> in 1690, was the first who took the flower as the foundation of his method, as did <HI>Ruppius</HI> in 1718. But no one carried this me∣thod to such perfection as <HI>Tournefort,</HI> in 1694, who forms his <HI>classical</HI> character from the <HI>figure</HI> of the <HI>flower,</HI> and establishes his <HI>orders</HI> or subdivisions on the different <HI>situation</HI> of <HI>the fruit,</HI> whether above or below the <HI>empalement</HI> or <HI>receptacle.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these methods, in which the authors have considered one part only, either <HI>flower</HI> or <HI>fruit,</HI> as the base of their systems, several others have been constructed of late years, in which ve∣getables have been arranged, as far as possible, according to what have been called the <HI>natural classes;</HI> the foundations of which take in a nu∣merous set of characters, arising from a combina∣tion and agreement in the <HI>habit</HI> of the plants, as well as their <HI>harmony</HI> in the essential <HI>parts of fructification.</HI> Among these, that of <HI>Van Royen,</HI> late professor at <HI>Leyden,</HI> is among the most elegant at∣tempts towards this <HI>ultimum</HI> in botany. This is exhibited in the <HI>Prodromus Florae Leydensis,</HI> 1740. He is followed by <HI>Gmelin,</HI> in the <HI>Flora Sibirica,</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="120"/>
1747, &amp;c. These authors, as also <HI>L. Gerard,</HI> in his <HI>Flora Gallo▪provincialis,</HI> Paris 1761, preserve the <HI>natural generical characters</HI> of LINNAEUS almost entire through their systems; and the latter writer has, with some variations, taken the <HI>orders</HI> of a <HI>natural method,</HI> constructed by <HI>B. Jussieu,</HI> for his <HI>classes.</HI> HALLER also planned, and brought to great perfection, a method of this kind, as is exhibited in his <HI>Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiae,</HI> 1742, and in the <HI>Hortus Gottingensis,</HI> 1753, which he has since still more elaborated, in a work of infinite labour and merit, the <HI>Historia Stirpium Helvetiae,</HI> 3 tom. fol. 1768.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS himself very early attempted a <HI>na∣tural</HI> method; but it is evident he thought there were too many links wanting in the chain, to ren∣der it the readiest guide to botanical science; since he soon deserted it, although he continued to improve it to the last: however he only reduced the <HI>genera</HI> into <HI>orders,</HI> but did not venture so far as to form the <HI>classical</HI> part of a system on that plan. The present learned and indefatigable professor Dr. HOPE, at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> whose zeal and success in cultivating and diffusing the principles of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> system are well known, has constructed perhaps the most elaborate attempt of this kind that the botanists have ever seen. We join with many others in wishing that he may be enabled to give it all that perfection which may encourage him to present it to the public.</P>
<P>Methods have also been formed from the dif∣ferent species and arrangement of the <HI>calyx,</HI> or cup
<PB N="116" REF="121"/>
of the flower in plants. Professor <HI>Magnol,</HI> of <HI>Montpelier,</HI> published in 1720 on this plan; and LINNAEUS himself in 1737, but he did not pursue it.</P>
<P>Every method of arrangement hath its advan∣tage in some respect or other; and it is surely rather to be regretted, howsoever the <HI>flower</HI> may claim the preference, that a method founded in the distinctions of the <HI>fruit,</HI> should not also have as it were a secondary place in common use; for, as all artificial methods are only supposed to be so many <HI>succedanea</HI> to the <HI>natural</HI> one, a due attention to each might tend to illustrate the natural classes, to connect them, and reduce the anomalies, and so far pave the way to the accomplishment of that scheme, which, however, will yet by many be considered as quite impracticable in botany.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS was the first who constituted the <HI>stamina</HI> and <HI>pistils</HI> as the basis of an artificial me∣thod of arranging plants; and he tells us, in his CLASSES PLANTARUM, he was led to this by considering the great importance of these parts in vegetation. They alone are the essentials neces∣sary to fructification; all other parts, except the <HI>anthera</HI> and <HI>stigma,</HI> being wanting in some flowers; and the present philosophy of botany regards the former as the <HI>male,</HI> and the latter as the <HI>female</HI> organs of generation in plants. As such indeed they must be considered <HI>analogically,</HI> and in a phi∣losophical view; yet, perhaps, the <HI>Linnaean</HI> system, admirable as it is, would not have been less ac∣ceptable had the classical terms been expressive
<PB N="117" REF="122"/>
only of <HI>number</HI> and <HI>situation,</HI> without regard to the offices of the parts in framing the terms. <HI>Ludwig,</HI> of <HI>Leipsic,</HI> who has endeavoured to com∣bine the systems of <HI>Rivinus</HI> and LINNAEUS, by taking his <HI>classes</HI> from the method of the former, and his <HI>orders</HI> from that of the latter, has avoided this mode of expression, in substituting the terms <HI>monantherae, monostylae,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The author begins the new and enlarged edition of the <HI>Systema Vegetabilium</HI> of 1767, by premising a compendious view of the philosophy of vege∣tation, and then proceeds to what he calls <HI>Delineatio Plantae,</HI> something analogous to what he had en∣titled, in the editions prior to the 10th, <HI>Methodus Demonstrandi Vegetabilia.</HI> Here he introduces all the terms he makes use of in describing plants, and, by a methodical and apt disposition of them, really explains them at the same time. After this, he gives the <HI>Clavis et Characteres Classium,</HI> and then comes to the system itself.</P>
<P>The prerogative of any artificial system in botany, <HI>is supposed</HI> to consist in its keeping toge∣ther, as much as possible, the <HI>genera,</HI> in what are called the <HI>natural classes</HI> or orders, and thus so far approaching to the system of nature. All <HI>artificial</HI> systems being founded on <HI>some,</HI> or <HI>other,</HI> or <HI>all</HI> the parts of <HI>fructification,</HI> without regard to <HI>habit,</HI> will be found in many instances to break the order of the <HI>natural</HI> classes, and disjoin <HI>genera,</HI> which nature seems to have classed. The more simple and uniform the classical characters of any system are, the more they are likely to interfere in this respect; nevertheless, it is pleasing to observe, how
<PB N="118" REF="123"/>
well many of the <HI>natural</HI> classes are kept together in the <HI>Linnaean</HI> system; the characters of which enjoy the advantage of being very simple, and easy to retain in the memory, and of being found∣ed on the parts of plants as little subject to vari∣ation as any whatever: yet, like all other me∣thods, it has its defects; of which no one was more sensible than the author himself. There are many instances of particular species that break through the <HI>generical</HI> and classical characters of the system itself: but for these defects there is no other remedy, at present, than that which our au∣thor has applied, in the volume under considera∣tion, and which ought ever, in arrangements of this kind, to be rigidly observed. Wherever these <HI>anomalies</HI> take place, they are mentioned among the <HI>fictitious</HI> characters, under the class and order to which the <HI>number</HI> of <HI>stamina</HI> or <HI>pistils</HI> entitle them to a place.</P>
<P>The <HI>sexual</HI> system briefly is as follows:—All known plants are divided into 24 CLASSES; the characters of which are established upon the <HI>num∣ber,</HI> or different situation, or arrangement of the <HI>stamina</HI> or male organs; and the ORDERS, or sub∣divisions, of these classes, as far as possible, on a similar number, situation, or arrangement, of the <HI>pistils,</HI> or female organs.</P>
<P>The first twenty classes contain what the author calls <HI>hermaphrodite</HI> flowers, or such as have the <HI>sta∣mina</HI> and <HI>pistils</HI> both within the same <HI>cup</HI> or <HI>petals,</HI> or standing on the same <HI>receptacle,</HI> where those are wanting. Of these twenty, the first <HI>ten</HI> classes pro∣ceed in an uninterrupted series, from MONAN∣DRIA
<PB N="119" REF="124"/>
to DECANDRIA; the plants of each having as many stamina as the title expresses.</P>
<P>The 11th class is DODECANDRIA, as there are no plants yet discovered which have only eleven stamina.</P>
<P>The 12th, ICOSANDRIA; such plants as have about 20 stamina, or more; but always arising from the <HI>calyx</HI> or <HI>corolla,</HI> and not from the <HI>recep∣tacle.</HI></P>
<P>The 13th, POLYANDRIA; such as have from twenty to even a thousand stamina; but always arising from the <HI>receptacle.</HI></P>
<P>The 14th class, DIDYNAMIA; such as have <HI>four</HI> stamina, two long and two short. The essential character of this class does not consist in the <HI>num∣ber</HI> of stamina, otherwise the plants might be re∣ferred to the <HI>tetrandria</HI> class; but, in having two of the stamina shorter than the other, one pistil only, and an irregularly-shaped corolla.</P>
<P>The 15th, TETRADYNAMIA; plants with <HI>six</HI> sta∣mina, four long and two short.</P>
<P>The 16th, MONADELPHIA; such as have the stamina not distinct at the base, but united into one body.</P>
<P>The 17th, DIADELPHIA; such as have the sta∣mina united at the base into two bodies.</P>
<P>The 18th, POLYADELPHIA; such as have the stamina united at the base into several bodies.</P>
<P>The 19th, SYNGENESIA; such as have the <HI>anthe∣rae,</HI> but not the filaments, coalescing together, so as to form a tube or cylinder, through which the pistil is commonly transmitted.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="125"/>
The 20th, GYNANDRIA; such as have the sta∣mina springing from the pistil itself.</P>
<P>The 21st, MONOECIA; such as have separate male and female flowers on the same plant.</P>
<P>The 22d, DIOECIA; such as have separate male and female flowers on separate plants.</P>
<P>The 23d, POLYGAMIA; such as have constantly, besides hermaphrodite flowers, others, either male or female, on the same plant.</P>
<P>The 24th, CRYPTOGAMIA; containing those plants the mode and organs of whose fructification are not yet sufficiently ascertained; heretofore called imperfect plants.</P>
<P>The secondary part of the system, the OR∣DERS, or subdivisions of the foregoing classes, are established on the <HI>number</HI> of the <HI>pistils</HI> or female parts, through a considerable part of the system; but in other parts, from various characters. Thus,</P>
<P>The arrangement from number is pursued no farther than through the first thirteen classes: that is, so long as the <HI>classical</HI> character, uninterrup∣tedly, depends on the <HI>number</HI> of <HI>stamina,</HI> so long the <HI>orders</HI> likewise depend on the <HI>number</HI> of <HI>pistils:</HI> but, when <HI>situation</HI> or different <HI>arrangement</HI> take place, the <HI>orders</HI> are most commonly founded on other distinctions, which we shall briefly specify.</P>
<P>The 14th class, or <HI>Didynamia,</HI> is divided into GYMNOSPERMIA and ANGIOSPERMIA: the former having four naked seeds; the latter having the seeds inclosed in a seed-vessel.</P>
<P>The 15th, <HI>Tetradynamia,</HI> has two orders, accor∣ding
<PB N="121" REF="126"/>
to the size and shape of the <HI>pod</HI> or <HI>shale;</HI> SI∣LICULOSA, short; and SILIQUOSA, long.</P>
<P>The orders in the three next classes, <HI>Monadel∣phia, Diadelphia,</HI> and <HI>Polyadelphia,</HI> are formed from the NUMBER of the <HI>stamina.</HI></P>
<P>Those of the <HI>Syngenesia</HI> class are six: in five of which the plants are POLYGAMIAE, and in the remaining one MONOGAMIAE; and the differences in the orders of the former, arise from the different structure or sex of the <HI>floscules,</HI> constituting the whole flower.</P>
<P>In the 20th class, <HI>Gynandria,</HI> the arrangement of the orders arises from the NUMBER of the <HI>sta∣mina,</HI> as in the 16th, 17th, and 18th classes.</P>
<P>In the 21st and 22d classes, the <HI>Monoecia</HI> and <HI>Dioecia,</HI> the classical characters of the foregoing parts of the system are adopted as characters of the <HI>orders,</HI> as far down as to the <HI>Monoecia</HI> class it∣self. Thus the first order of those classes contains MONANDROUS plants, and the last GYNANDROUS.</P>
<P>The 23d, the <HI>Polygamia</HI> class, is divided into three orders, as the plants are MONOECIOUS, DIOE∣CIOUS, or TRIOECIOUS.</P>
<P>The 24th and last class, <HI>Cryptogamia,</HI> is divided into four orders, containing the FILICES, MUSCI, ALGAE, and FUNGI.</P>

<P>The GENERA are established upon the assem∣blage of all the parts of fructification compared together, according to their <HI>number, figure, pro∣portion,</HI> and <HI>situation.</HI> Of these we have spoken before, as they constitute a large volume in oc∣tavo, to which we refer.</P>
<P>But, besides these NATURAL CHARACTERS, or GENERA at large, our author has invented, for brevity's sake, two other kinds of characters, which he calls FACTITIOUS and ESSENTIAL. The former serve to distinguish each genus from other <HI>genera</HI> of the same <HI>artificial</HI> order only, by enume∣rating the most remarkable differences: these greatly facilitate the labour of a young botanist. The ESSENTIAL characters, could they be rendered perfect, are designed to distinguish the <HI>genera</HI> from each other in the <HI>natural</HI> orders; but they are not complete as yet, except in a few instances; and
<PB N="128" REF="133"/>
possibly they exist but in a small number: never∣theless, they are attempted through the whole system, to save the trouble of turning over the <HI>na∣tural characters</HI> at large.</P>
<P>As this volume was intended to contain all the plants hitherto known, consequently the <HI>natural</HI> characters could not be introduced; but the <HI>fic∣titious</HI> and <HI>essential</HI> ones are placed, the former at the head of each <HI>class,</HI> and the latter before each <HI>genus.</HI> With each generical name the author refers to the number where it is exhibited at large, in the last edition of the <HI>Genera Plantarum</HI> in 1764, and to the page of the <HI>Species Plantarum</HI> of 1762, where the species are detailed and the <HI>sy∣nonyms</HI> added; as he gives in this volume only the specific name invented by himself.</P>
<P>In forming the last branch of the system, the SPECIFIC names, LINNAEUS has done more than all the writers on the subject had done before him, and taken the utmost pains to fix them upon distinctions as permanent and invariable as pos∣sible. This is indeed the ultimate object of all method; and on this plan he has given new <HI>spe∣cific</HI> names to all the plants that have come to his knowledge: names, not taken (as had been cus∣tomary before) from that of the discoverer, the likeness of the plant to other species, place of growth, time of flowering, its size, the colour of the flower, or of the plant, smell, taste, or vir∣tues in medicine, or any other such vague, in∣definite, or mutable circumstance; but from some remarkable difference in the root, trunk,
<PB N="129" REF="134"/>
stalk, and particularly the leaf, foliation, ramifica∣tion, or some other abiding distinction.</P>
<P>Besides these <HI>specific</HI> names or descriptions, LIN∣NAEUS has invented, and, in all his works, after the first edition of the <HI>Species Plantarum</HI> in 1753, has applied what he calls TRIVIAL names to each plant, consisting of a single adjunct to the generical name, expressive, if possible, of some essential dis∣tinction of the species: as for instance, <HI>integrifo∣lia, laciniata, erecta, repens, aquatica, montana,</HI> &amp;c.: sometimes, of the name of the inventor; and where, from the laws of his <HI>Fundamenta Botanica,</HI> he has been obliged to change the generical name of a plant well known before, and especially if it was an <HI>officinal</HI> one, he frequently retains the <HI>old generical</HI> name as his <HI>trivial</HI> epithet. Thus as the Penny-royal, or <HI>Pulegium,</HI> really belongs to the <HI>Mentha</HI> genus, according to his characters, he therefore calls it <HI>Mentha Pulegium.</HI> The Horse∣radish, known by the old name <HI>Armoracia,</HI> as it agrees with the <HI>Cochlearia</HI> genus, he calls <HI>Cochle∣aria Armoracia.</HI></P>
<P>The VARIETIES of plants, which, for want of fixing true <HI>specific</HI> characters, had almost increased the number of plants double what LINNAEUS thinks they really are, in this work, as in the SPECIES, are totally excluded. Our author has indeed, in the opinion of many of his contemporary botanists, carried this matter too far, in disallowing the name of species to many plants that are thought to have sufficiently permanent distinctions.</P>
<P>To conclude, the space of time elapsed since the publication of the <HI>Genera</HI> and <HI>Species Plantarum,</HI> to∣gether
<PB N="130" REF="135"/>
with the vast quantity of new materials ac∣quired from all parts of the world, enabled our author greatly to elaborate this last edition, and to amend very many <HI>generical</HI> and <HI>specific</HI> characters; as also to make many removes, tending greatly to the advancement and perfection of his work. Among these removes, many have taken place, particularly in the <HI>Monoecious, Dioecious,</HI> and <HI>Polyga∣mous</HI> classes; which is the less to be wondered at, since observations have confirmed, that there are plants of these classes which, in their younger state, have produced only male flowers, afterwards both male and female, and at length only female.</P>
<P>The <HI>Species Plantarum</HI> contains near seven thou∣sand three hundred plants. In this volume, the number is augmented by the addition of new plants, and such as were unknown by our author before, to above seven thousand eight hundred.</P>
<P>It is proper to remark, that this second tome of the System was immediately preceded by MAN∣TISSA PLANTARUM <HI>Generum, editionis sextae, et Specie∣rum editionis secundae.</HI> Holm. 1767, pp. 142. in which are described, as in the <HI>Genera Plantarum,</HI> the natural characters at large of forty-four <HI>genera,</HI> newly constructed. These are followed by an enu∣meration of upwards of four hundred and thirty new species, with their synonyms, as in the <HI>Species Plantarum.</HI> All these plants are included in the volume of the System of which we have just given the account.</P>

<HEAD>TOM. III. The FOSSIL KINGDOM.</HEAD>
<P>We are now to accompany our author into the <HI>Fossil</HI> kingdom; in which, though he very early gave a specimen of his method of classing, he did not fully exemplify, as in vegetables, until the year 1768, when the third tome of the 12th edition of the <HI>Systema</HI> was published, containing the REGNUM LAPIDEUM. This volume makes 222 pages, and is concluded with a short appendix of some unno∣ticed, or not well described animals and vegetables; together with a general index of the author's own <HI>generical</HI> names throughout every part of the System, distinguishing by a different type the subjects of the three kingdoms, the whole amounting to 1820 <HI>genera.</HI></P>
<P>In arranging Fossils, there have been various me∣thods invented; each of which have had their pa∣trons, and, for different purposes, each have their advantage. Some have founded the basis of their system on the <HI>figure, colour, structure,</HI> and other ex∣ternal and visible characters; yet, scarcely ever trusting solely to these, they called in the aid of chemistry, so far at least, as the mineral acids would assist them. Others, as the professed che∣mists and metallurgists, have established their ar∣rangement chiefly on <HI>chemical principles,</HI> as more immediately leading to the <HI>origin</HI> of fossil bodies in general; on which it must be acknowledged, the best basis for a system must be built, when we are happy enough to get sufficient light for this pur∣pose: and at present, mineralogists throughout the world seem more intent on this view than ever:
<PB N="132" REF="137"/>
and probably the due consideration and extension of the volcanic system, will open new sources of information in this way.</P>
<P>This volume begins with LINNAEUS'S own theory of the origin of fossil bodies in general, and their several combinations into those forms in which we meet with them in the body of the earth. The methodical and abbreviated manner in which our author has here given his <HI>philosophy</HI> of fossil bodies, renders it incapable of an ab∣stract. He then proceeds to give a synoptical or classical view of the several systems of arranging those bodies, as they stand exhibited in the best authors on the subject, beginning with <HI>Bromelius,</HI> who published in 1730, and enumerates <HI>Wal∣lerius</HI> in 1747, <HI>Woltersdorf</HI> in 1748, <HI>Cartheuser</HI> in 1755, <HI>Justi</HI> 1757, <HI>Anomymus [Cronstedt]</HI> in 1758, and concludes with <HI>Vogel</HI> in 1762. To each of these he has subjoined short remarks relating to their methods, and theory of fossil bodies, and concludes this introductory part with an ex∣planation of the terms of art used in his own work.</P>
<P>In these <HI>termini artis,</HI> our author, with his usual precision, has defined a set of terms equally new and curious, which are principally adapted to, and used in, the ultimate and most difficult part of the System, the specific characters. They are happily framed to express all differences in the <HI>figures</HI> of fossil bodies; in their <HI>crust,</HI> or outward appear∣ance; their <HI>superficies;</HI> their <HI>component particles,</HI> or <HI>fibres;</HI> in their <HI>texture,</HI> whether plated, fissile, &amp;c.; in their <HI>hardness;</HI> or in their <HI>colour:</HI> the alterations
<PB N="133" REF="138"/>
they undergo by <HI>solution,</HI> whether by acids, or by fire.</P>
<P>It has been doubted by some of the most respectable mineralogists, whether we ought to descend below what are called <HI>generical</HI> distinctions in the fossil kingdom, so infinitely do the subjects thereof vary, and so imperceptible in general is that gradation by which they run into each other, in the various combined forms, in which they are found in the earth. In the mean time, some distinctions of this kind seem quite necessary in systems established principally on external cha∣racters. Those which have for their basis the <HI>elementary</HI> or <HI>constituent principles of bodies,</HI> as ana∣lyzed, may stand with propriety in the form of <HI>synoptical</HI> tables, as exemplified in <HI>Cronstedt</HI>'s mi∣neralogy. LINNAEUS and <HI>Wallerius</HI> were among the first who attempted the arduous task of fixing the <HI>specific</HI> characters: whether future mineralo∣gists will adhere to, and improve this part of the scheme, time only must shew.</P>
<P>In all systems of the fossil kingdom, writers have been more particularly embarrassed by the <HI>earths</HI> and <HI>stones,</HI> especially when those have been more or less reduced to the state of <HI>ores,</HI> by the admixture of <HI>metallic</HI> principles. <HI>Salts, inflamma∣bles,</HI> and <HI>metals,</HI> generally falling more easily, and almost naturally, into their several classes, or or∣ders. The chemical systematics and metallur∣gists, begin usually with the <HI>earths,</HI> considering them as the basis of stones: LINNAEUS begins with the latter, professing to take a middle way between the mere <HI>metallurgist,</HI> and those who
<PB N="134" REF="139"/>
characterize from external appearance only. He divides the whole REGNUM LAPIDEUM into three classes, under the names of <HI>Petrae, Minerae,</HI> and <HI>Fossilia,</HI> each being subdivided into several orders, the whole comprehending 54 genera. We must only give a general account of his <HI>classical</HI> cha∣racters, and those of the <HI>orders;</HI> and enumerate the <HI>genera</HI> under each, with some of the most dis∣tinguished <HI>species.</HI></P>

To this our author tells us he was led, by considering that all regular polyedrous figures or bodies in the mineral kingdom, are the result of chrystallization, which can only take place under re∣quisite and certain degrees of fluidity; and therefore, whether they are saline or lapidose chrystals, they must owe their figure to the same uniform prin∣ciple operating on them in either case, while in the fluid state; hence, from the similarity of the figure, with the chrystals of nitre, <HI>Mountain Chrystal</HI> hath a place in the same genus: the <HI>Topaz</HI> with the <HI>Borax:</HI> the <HI>Diamond</HI> and <HI>Ruby</HI> with <HI>Alum.</HI> LINNAEUS hath given his reasons more at large in a paper published in the first volume of the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae:</HI> and hath since added <Q REND="margQuotes"><HI>Chrystallos</HI> quod subjecerim salibus ne quemquam offendat mutet vocem <HI>salis</HI> in chrystalli, si magis placeat, in verbis erimus faciles.</Q></P>

<P N="2">Order II. CONCRETA. Slight conglutinations of different kinds of <HI>earths.</HI></P>
<P>The specific differences of these bodies arise from the nature principally of the component parts, whether ochraceous, calcareous, gypseous, spatose, argillaceous, arenaceous, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>GENERA MORBORUM, or CLASSIFICATION of DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P>WE must now look backwards a few years, to consider our author in another part of his Profes∣sorial character. It has been observed, that after his establishment at <HI>Upsal,</HI> one of his departments, as a professor, was that of teaching the <HI>Diagnosis Morborum;</HI> and to this end he drew up a system,
<PB N="167" REF="172"/>
in which, as in natural history, all diseases were disposed into <HI>classes, orders,</HI> and <HI>genera,</HI> founded on distinctions taken from the <HI>symptoms</HI> alone, no regard being had either to remote, or proximate causes. Before we proceed to a particular view of LINNAEUS'S method of classing diseases, it will be proper to premise, that a <HI>nosology</HI> on this plan, the great object of which is to fix <HI>pathognomonics</HI> to every disease, had been long wished for by some writers of the first character in the profession: such were <HI>Baglivi, Boerhaave, Gorter, Gaubius,</HI> and <HI>Syden∣ham;</HI> the latter of whom has thus expressed himself on this subject, in the preface to his works: <Q REND="margQuotes">Expe∣dit ut morbi omnes ad definitas ac certas species revo∣centur, eadem prorsus diligentia ac <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, qua id factum videmus à botanicis scriptoribus in suis phytologiis.</Q> Yet, amidst that almost infinite variety and complication of appearances which are seen in diseases, the difficulty of obtaining suf∣ficient distinctions, by which the <HI>genus</HI> and <HI>species</HI> may be accurately discriminated, must be allowed to be very great; and possibly is in many instances unsurmountable. Hence, some of the most emi∣nent physicians have been led to reject all such arrangements as futile, and impracticable. This, however, hath not deterred others from paying attention to the subject, more especially some of those, who, from their province as professors, are led to teach the rudiments of the art; and to whom method, <HI>in some form,</HI> is absolutely neces∣sary. Systematic writers had used various me∣thods in the disposition of their subject. Some
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>
had chosen the <HI>alphabetic;</HI> if that deserves the name of an arrangement: others, after the ex∣ample of <HI>Aretaeus,</HI> and <HI>Caelius Aurelianus,</HI> had di∣vided diseases, from their duration, into <HI>acute,</HI> and <HI>chronical.</HI> Some had preferred the <HI>anatomical</HI> order; which, as it presupposes a knowledge of the seat of the disease, must, not unfrequently, prove fallacious: <HI>Sennertus</HI>'s is an instance of this kind. However, the <HI>äitiological</HI> arrangement has been most followed by the best writers among the moderns; such as <HI>Hoffmann,</HI> and <HI>Boerhaave;</HI> al∣though perhaps not much less fallacious than the anatomical, since it is in many instances founded on an hypothesis of the writer: and though <HI>Felix Platerus,</HI> in his <HI>Praxis Medica,</HI> published in 1602, had given an imperfect sketch of a nosology on the <HI>symptomatic</HI> plan, yet no writer ventured to pursue his idea, for more than a century after his time; discouraged as it should seem by the diffi∣culty of the attempt. At length the late profes∣sor M. SAUVAGES of <HI>Montpelier,</HI> after communi∣cating his scheme to <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> published in 1731, in 12<SUP>mo</SUP>. the outlines of such a work, under the title of <HI>Nouvelles Classes des Maladies,</HI> in which he professes to define diseases, from <HI>their constant and evident symptoms only.</HI> In the year 1763, the au∣thor augmented his work, by the addition of the <HI>species</HI> under each <HI>genus,</HI> into 5 volumes in 8<SUP>vo</SUP>. <HI>Sauvages</HI> may be considered as having spent his life in giving to this design a certain degree of perfec∣tion, having enlarged it into 2 quarto volumes, in which form it was published after his death in
<PB N="169" REF="174"/>
1768: A work, it is to be presumed, now in the hands of most physicians.</P>
<P>It will easily be imagined, that an arrangement of this kind was too congenial to LINNAEUS to be neglected by him. In fact, it appears that he very early corresponded with <HI>Sauvages</HI> on this subject, that he soon adopted it, and framed a set of institutes, under the title of GENERA MOR∣BORUM, as a basis of his lectures in this depart∣ment. LINNAEUS'S scheme was first published in a <HI>thesis</HI> in 1759; but he had taught it in his class for ten years preceding that time. In 1763, he published it himself in a small quarto; though we do not find that he ever enlarged it by the addition of the <HI>species.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>symptomatic</HI> plan of arranging diseases has since been followed by some other professors of physic; Dr. <HI>Vogel</HI> of <HI>Gottingen</HI> having published, in 1764, his <HI>Definitiones Generum Morborum.</HI> Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> also, who at this time fills the practical chair at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> with such deserved reputation, has published a <HI>Synopsis nosologiae methodicae,</HI> and has made it the basis of his <HI>First Lines of the Practice of Physic.</HI> In 1776, Dr. <HI>Sagar,</HI> a physician at <HI>Ig∣law</HI> in <HI>Moravia,</HI> published a <HI>Systema Morborum sym∣tomaticum.</HI> 8vo. <HI>Vien.</HI> pp. 756. His work, allow∣ing for some alterations and additions, may be ac∣counted an useful abridgement of <HI>Sauvages</HI>'s: the author, all theory apart, has described the <HI>species</HI> under every <HI>genus,</HI> and subjoined the method of cure. Dr. <HI>Cullen,</HI> by omitting many <HI>genera,</HI> and reducing others to the rank of <HI>species</HI> only, has so
<PB N="170" REF="175"/>
considerably abridged the whole, as not to have retained more than half the number of <HI>genera,</HI> that the foregoing writers enumerate; and in this form he has published it, annexed to those of the four abovementiond, by which display of each, their several merits may be compared, and a judg∣ment formed of the practicability, and use of the scheme in general, which, it must be confessed, af∣fords a very ample field for cultivation; yet, from that reform which Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> has already made in various parts, it is not, perhaps, too much to hope, that it is capable of receiving a much higher degree of improvement, in the hands of those whose genius and industry may prompt them to extend the design of these writers.</P>
<P>Of LINNAEUS'S method we are led by our plan to exhibit a general view; to which end, although our prescribed brevity will not admit of giving his <HI>definitions</HI> at length, yet it will be necessary to enumerate the <HI>names</HI> of all his <HI>genera,</HI> since no∣thing short of a view of the whole collectively, could enable the reader to form a just idea of the author's scheme. Under each <HI>class</HI> we shall ob∣serve wherein LINNAEUS differs materially from <HI>Sauvages,</HI> and note the alterations which Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> has made in the disposition of the same <HI>genera.</HI></P>
<P>LINNAEUS, in the classification of diseases, has pretty nearly retained the arrangement of M. <HI>Sau∣vages,</HI> although he has altered his terms, and con∣stituted one more class, with which he begins his method; the <HI>Exanthematic,</HI> or eruptive fevers, which, in the systems of <HI>Sauvages</HI> and Dr. <HI>Cullen,</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>
form only an <HI>order,</HI> or subdivision of a class. He has also changed the order of the classes, and re∣ferred the <HI>Vitia,</HI> or <HI>local external disorders,</HI> which are principally the objects of surgery, to the end of his system. In this he has been followed by the two succeeding nosologists, Dr. <HI>Vogel</HI> and Dr. <HI>Cullen.</HI> The classical distribution is, however, confessedly not the <HI>primary</HI> consideration; that of fixing the <HI>generical</HI> character, and determining what shall constitute the <HI>specifical,</HI> being the first object of every system. To this end a still farther reduction of the number of <HI>genera</HI> and <HI>species,</HI> will probably not a little contribute.</P>

In this class, as the disease is complicated of fever and eruption, the genus is defined from the nature of each. To instance, the <HI>Variola,</HI> or Small pox, is defined, <Q REND="margQuotes">A disease attended with pus∣tules of an erysipelatous, suppurating, escha∣rotic kind; at length drying off, and leaving a cicatrix; accompanied by a fever of the ardent, and malignant kind, with head-ach and pain of the loins.</Q> The term <HI>Pustula,</HI> and the others in this class, expressive of the different kinds of eruption, have their definition in another part of the system. Such as appear in the Morta, are called <HI>Phlyctenae;</HI> in the Pestis, <HI>Anthraces,</HI> or <HI>Bu∣bones;</HI> in the Variola, <HI>Pustulae;</HI> in the Rubeola, <HI>Papulae;</HI> in the Petechia, <HI>Sudamina.</HI></P>
<P>This class constitutes the first <HI>order</HI> of Dr. <HI>Sau∣vages</HI>'s PHLEGMASIAE, and the third of Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI>'s PYREXIAE class.

<P>Our author stands alone in bringing the <HI>Syphilis</HI> into the febrile exanthematic class. He thinks himself justified, by considering it as attended, in the advanced state at least, by fever and eruptions. It certainly however ranks better with the IM∣PETIGINES.</P>

LINNAEUS defines the <HI>Phlegmon</HI> to be <Q REND="margQuotes">a tense throbbing tumour, or enlargement of a part, accompanied by fever, and attended with heat and redness.</Q> This he considers as suggest∣ing also the idea of all the foregoing internal in∣flammations.</P>
<P>The generical character in the <HI>Phlogistic</HI> class of our author, does not arise wholly from the part affected supposed to be the seat of the disease, but from the <HI>genus</HI> of the attending fever also. Thus he defines <Q REND="margQuotes">the <HI>Hepatitis</HI> to be the <HI>Amphi∣merina,</HI> attended with a difficult respiration, cough without expectoration, hiccup, and a sense of heat and tension in the right <HI>hypo∣chondre.</HI></Q> <Q REND="margQuotes">The <HI>Nephritis</HI> is a <HI>Synochus,</HI> attend∣ed with nausea, hiccup, eructation, urine vari∣ous, costiveness, burning lumbago, and numb∣ness down the thigh.</Q></P>
<P>In this class LINNAEUS has followed <HI>Sauvages</HI> in dividing the diseases into MEMBRANACEI, and PARENCHYMATICI, a division neglected by Dr. <HI>Cullen,</HI> from the difficulty of determining the seat of the inflammation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Phlegmone,</HI> being external, is ranked by <HI>Sauvages</HI> among his VITIA. On the other hand, Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> gives it the first place in his <HI>order</HI> PHLEG∣MASIAE; and has reduced thirteen <HI>genera</HI> of LIN∣NAEUS'S, and twelve of <HI>Sauvages</HI>'s, to the rank of <HI>species,</HI> under the term <HI>Phlogosis;</HI> further, account∣ing <HI>Abscess, Pustule, Gangrene,</HI> and <HI>Sphacelus,</HI> as effects only of <HI>Phlogosis,</HI> and therefore not entitled

The <HI>Demonia, Vesania,</HI> and <HI>Panopho∣bia,</HI> rank with <HI>Melancholy;</HI> under which he has also brought the <HI>Erotomania</HI> and <HI>Nostalgia,</HI> from the PATHETICI. Of the remaining <HI>genera</HI> only the <HI>Hypochondriasis,</HI> and the <HI>Hydrophobia,</HI> are ad∣mitted as such; the former in the ADYNAMIAE, and the latter among the SPASMI. The <HI>Syrigmus,</HI> and <HI>Phantasma,</HI> are referred to the LOCALES class; and the <HI>Somnambulismus</HI> to the <HI>Oneirodynia,</HI> in the <HI>order</HI> VESANIAE. The <HI>Citta,</HI> or <HI>Pica,</HI> the <HI>Polydipsia, Satyriasis,</HI> and <HI>Bulimia,</HI> belong also to the LOCALES, in the <HI>order</HI> DYSOREXIAE. It is justly doubted whether the <HI>Tarantismus</HI> exists; and the <HI>Rabies</HI> can scarcely be separated from the <HI>Hydrophobia.</HI></P>

<P>Under the <HI>genera</HI> of the SUFFOCATORII our au∣thor has departed from his usual rule, in having subjoined to each a note expressive of the intention of Nature in exciting these affections. Thus, to instance, after defining <HI>Suspirium</HI> to be <Q REND="margQuotes"><HI>a deep, slow, agitating inspiration,</HI></Q> he adds, that the effect is, <HI>"that of expelling the blood from the lungs."</HI> Most of the SUFFOCATORII have a place in <HI>Sau∣vages</HI>'s system among the ANHELATIONES, but the CONSTRICTORII are scattered in various parts of his system.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> hath not introduced into his system the lighter affections under the SUFFOCATORII; which seem to have been defined and explained by LINNAEUS, principally to use them as auxili∣aries in other parts of the work.</P>
<P>In Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI>'s system the <HI>Raucedo</HI> has a place, as symptomatic only, under the Catarrh; and again, in another part, as a species of <HI>Para∣phonia.</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="191"/>
The <HI>Tussis</HI> is also received under the Ca∣tarrh; and the <HI>Empyema</HI> is considered as a conse∣quence of Pleurisy or Peripneumony.

<P>In the CONSTRICTORII order, the <HI>Flatulentia</HI> of LINNAEUS comes under the <HI>Dyspepsia</HI> of Dr. <HI>Cullen;</HI> and the <HI>Obstipatio, Ischuria,</HI> and <HI>Dysmenor∣rhoea,</HI> enter into the fourth <HI>order</HI> of the LOCA∣LES, called EPISCHESES; the latter under the term <HI>Amenorrhaea.</HI></P>

<P>Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> has not given a place to these <HI>genera</HI> in his system.</P>
<P>Our author has subjoined to this distribution of diseases, a brief view of his <HI>Theory of Physic,</HI> de∣livered in that terse, concise, and methodic man∣ner, so peculiar to himself; and which, as it ap∣pears to have been intended entirely for the use of his pupils, nothing less than the author's own comment can do sufficient justice to. We should not therefore have taken notice of it, in our plan, had it not been necessary in order to explain several
<PB N="199" REF="204"/>
papers hereafter to be mentioned in the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae.</HI> Briefly, therefore, the <HI>Linnaean</HI> prin∣ciples of physic suppose the human body to consist of a <HI>cerebrose medullary</HI> part, of which the nerves are so many processes, and which we call the <HI>ner∣vous</HI> system; and, a <HI>cortical</HI> or vital part, includ∣ing the <HI>vascular</HI> system and contained fluids: the former, being the animated part, or that in which the <HI>sentient,</HI> moving principle peculiarly resides, is considered as deriving its <HI>nourishment</HI> from the subtlest fluids of the vascular system, and its <HI>energy</HI> from an electrical principle inhaled by the lungs. Farther, this theory supposes the cir∣culating fluids to be capable of being vitiated, by principles which the author chuses to consider either as <HI>acescent,</HI> or <HI>putrid</HI> ferments; the former acting on the <HI>serum,</HI> and being the exciting cause of <HI>critical</HI> fevers; the latter, on the blood pro∣perly, or <HI>crassamentum,</HI> and exciting <HI>phlogistic</HI> dis∣eases. The <HI>exanthematic</HI> class is supposed to be excited by some external causes, which we call <HI>Contagion,</HI> and which <HI>hypothetically</HI> he proposes as being <HI>animalcula.</HI> From the incessant attrition of the <HI>cortical</HI> or vascular system, it requires perpe∣tual reparation; this is to be effected by an <HI>appro∣priate</HI> diet. From an <HI>impropriate</HI> diet, or regi∣men, spring the diseases of this part of the system, originally and more particularly; these are to be remedied by <HI>sapid</HI> medicines, as those of the <HI>medul∣lary</HI> system are by <HI>olids.</HI> Hence arises the author's general division of all medicines, as discoverable by their sensible qualities, to the <HI>taste,</HI> and <HI>smelling.</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="205"/>
The <HI>Sapids,</HI> according to this theory, acting pecu∣liarly on the cortical part, as the <HI>Olids</HI> do immedi∣ately on the <HI>medullary,</HI> or nervous system. In or∣der however to obtain a more complete idea of the effects of each of these general classes of medicines, each must be viewed in its most simple state, by which <HI>Sapids</HI> will appear to be rather what we call <HI>Nutritives;</HI> and <HI>Olids,</HI> more strictly speaking, <HI>Me∣dicines.</HI> A table of of the several <HI>qualities</HI> of medi∣cines, acording to these two general divisions, closes the <HI>Genera Morborum.</HI></P>
<P>In 1766, LINNAEUS published a small piece, un∣der the title of CLAVIS MEDICINAE <HI>duplex, exterior et interior.</HI> Holm. 8vo. pp. 29. This small tract may be considered as a syllabus of his lectures. It is an enlarged view of the theory just mentioned, connecting it with general <HI>Pathology,</HI> and the the∣rapeutic part of physic. In the latter part all simples are arranged in thirty <HI>orders,</HI> according to their sensible qualities, agreeably to the theory; which is displayed more at large in two papers printed in the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae,</HI> under the titles of <HI>Sapores, et Odores Medicamentorum.</HI></P>
<P>It appears from several parts of the writings of LINNAEUS, that the <HI>dietetic</HI> part of physic had been an object to which he had paid much atten∣tion; and he has explained himself in the follow∣ing manner relating to it:—<HI>In his meae deliciae, in his plura collegi, quam quod novi alius ullus:</HI>—but, whether our author's observations on this sub∣ject may hereafter be published, we are yet to learn.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="206"/>
In 1771 was published LINNAEUS'S last work, being the continuation of the <HI>Mantissa,</HI> in which the work is carried on to 588 pages, under the title of MANTISSA ALTERA. Near one half of this volume comprehends additional new <HI>genera</HI> and <HI>species,</HI> and the remaining part a variety of emendations, with some considerable augmentation to the animal kingdom. These will greatly enrich a future edition of his works; and in the preface he has earnestly intreated succeeding editors to pay a pro∣per regard to them.</P>
<P>Besides his separate works, which we have now brought to a conclusion, LINNAEUS wrote a great number of papers on the subjects of physic and natural history, which were published in the <HI>Acta Literaria Upsaliensia,</HI> and in the <HI>Stockholm Acts.</HI> The first of these works was begun by <HI>Olaus Celsius</HI> in 1720, and continued to the year 1750, and is in Latin, in 5 volumes, quarto. The lat∣ter publication is in the <HI>Swedish</HI> language, in the octavo form, and has been continued ever since the establishment of the academy at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in 1739, by king <HI>Adolphus.</HI> Many of these papers are superseded by the subsequent works of our author, neither would it be within our plan to give a particular detail of them: we are therefore only to subjoin a catalogue of these detached pieces, and regret that it is not in our power to make it more complete; or to add such, if there be any, as may have been given by LINNAEUS to foreign academies.</P>

<P><HI>Florula Lapponica,</HI> in 1732. This, as is before observed, was our author's first publication, and consists only of a bare catalogue of the <HI>Lapland</HI> plants, digested into the order of the <HI>sexual system,</HI> of which it is the first specimen.

This was to have appeared under the title of <HI>Lachesis Lappo∣nica;</HI> but it is with great regret that we must now give up the expectation of this work. Mr. <HI>Pen∣nant</HI> has informed us, that he once reminded him of it, and received for answer,—<HI>nunc nimis sera nciperem:</HI></P>

</LG>
<P>We know not of any other publication of LINNAEUS'S after the <HI>Mantissa altera,</HI> in 1771; and indeed, the preface to that work is sufficient to preclude the expectation of any new performance, if his advanced age had not, of itself, rendered it sufficiently improbable after that period.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="215"/>
In the spring of the year 1772, Dr. <HI>Murray,</HI> Professor of Physic and Botany at <HI>Gottingen,</HI> a <HI>Swede</HI> by birth, who had been educated under LINNAEUS, and had long enjoyed a great share of his confidence and esteem, paid his Preceptor a visit: he found his faculties unimpaired, and his ardor for the improvement of science as strong and vigorous as ever. He speaks with great de∣light of the satisfaction he received from his com∣pany, and in the contemplation and inspection of his museum at <HI>Hammarby;</HI> but regretted much to find, that LINNAEUS had no farther thoughts of publishing a new edition of his <HI>System of Nature;</HI> purposing only to give a supplement. However, before Dr. <HI>Murray</HI> left <HI>Upsal,</HI> he prevailed on him to promise that he would transmit to him his ad∣ditional observations to the <HI>Systema Vegetabilium,</HI> in order to enable him to give a complete edition of that work. This the Professor did; and Dr. <HI>Murray</HI> performed it in the year 1774, very much to the satisfaction of all who pursue the LINNAEAN method. The manuscript additions communica∣ted on this occasion by our author, together with those collected from the several <HI>Addenda,</HI> and from the <HI>Mantissae,</HI> enabled Dr. <HI>Murray</HI> to extend this volume to above one hundred pages beyond that of the 12th edition published in 1767.</P>
<P>It appears that LINNAEUS, upon the whole, en∣joyed a good constitution. At times, however, he had been severely afflicted with an <HI>hemicrania;</HI> and had not been exempted from the gout. How much he suffered from this latter distemper, we
<PB N="211" REF="216"/>
have before mentioned, when treating on the <HI>Phi∣losophia Botanica.</HI> And notwithstanding the sound state in which Dr. <HI>Murray</HI> left him, we find, that very soon after, his memory became somewhat impaired. The consciousness of this defect was said to have induced him to decline all thoughts of further publications, and to transmit to Dr. <HI>Mur∣ray</HI> such materials as were in readiness to compleat future editions of his <HI>System.</HI></P>
<P>In the summer of 1776, it was known here that his strength was declining apace, and his infirmi∣ties in general much increased, he being unable to take his usual walks in his garden without assistance. At the latter end of the year he was seized with an <HI>apoplexy,</HI> which left him paralytic; and at the be∣ginning of the year 1777 he suffered another stroke, which very much impaired his mental powers. These attacks, at his advanced stage of life, shew∣ed that dissolution was not far off. But the dis∣ease, which was said to have been the more imme∣diate cause of his death, was an ulceration of the urinary bladder. Nevertheless, he languished through the year, and died on the 11th of <HI>January,</HI> 1778, aged 70 years and 8 months.</P>
<P>To the lovers of science it will not appear strange, nor will it be unpleasant, to hear, that uncommon respect was shewn to the memory of this great man. We are told, that, <Q REND="margQuotes">on his death, a general mourning took place at <HI>Upsal,</HI> and that his funeral procession was attended by the whole university, as well professors as stu∣dents, and the pall supported by sixteen doctors
<PB N="212" REF="217"/>
of physic, all of whom had been his pupils.</Q> The King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> after the death of LINNAEUS, or∣dered a medal to be struck, of which <Q REND="margQuotes">one side exhibits LINNAEUS'S bust and name, and the other <HI>Cybele,</HI> in a dejected attitude, holding in her left hand a key, and surrounded with ani∣mals and growing plants, with this legend—<HI>Deam luctus angit amissi;</HI>—and beneath,—<HI>post obitum Upsaliae, die x. Jan.</HI> M.DCC.LXXVIII. <HI>Rege jubente.</HI></Q>—The same generous monarch not only honoured the Royal Academy of Sciences with his presence when LINNAEUS'S commemora∣tion was held at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> but, as a still higher tribute, in his speech from the throne to the assembly of the states, lamented <HI>Sweden</HI>'s loss by his death. Nor was he honoured only in his own country. The present learned and worthy professor of botany at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> not only pro∣nounced an eulogium in honour of LINNAEUS, before his students, at the opening of his lectures in the spring of 1778, but laid also the foundation-stone of a monument to be raised to his memory; which, while it perpetuates the name and merits of LINNAEUS, will do honour to the founder, and, it may be hoped, prove the means of raising an emulation favourable to that science which this illustrious <HI>Swede</HI> so highly dignified and improved. This monument consists of a vase, supported on a pedestal, with this inscription,
<Q>LINNAEO POSUIT J. HOPE.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="218"/>
The high reputation which this great man has long held among the naturalists throughout the world, might readily perhaps preclude any encomium from our pen; since, to all lovers of <HI>natural</HI> sci∣ence, his <HI>name</HI> itself is eulogy, and will doubtless very long be inseparable from the idea of his ex∣traordinary merit. Might we, nevertheless, be indulged so far, we hope the following brief esti∣mate of his talents will be thought just, and easily deduced from an impartial view of his writings.</P>
<P>Nature had, in an eminent manner, been liberal in the endowments of his mind. He seems to have been possessed of a lively imagination, corrected however by a strong judgment, and guided by the laws of system. Add to these, the most retentive memory, an unremitting industry, and the greatest perseverance in all his pursuits; as is evident from that continued vigour with which he prosecuted the design, that he appears to have formed so early in life, of totally reforming, and fabricating anew the whole science of natural history: and this fabric he raised, and gave to it a degree of perfection unknown before; and had moreover the un∣common felicity of living to see his own struc∣ture rise above all others, notwithstanding every discouragement its author at first laboured under, and the opposition it afterwards met with. Neither has any writer more cautiously avoided that com∣mon error of building his own fame on the ruin of another man's. He every where acknowledged the several merits of each author's system; and no man appears to have been more sensible of the <HI>par∣tial</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="219"/>
<HI>defects</HI> of his own. Those anomalies which had principally been the objects of criticism, he well knew every <HI>artificial</HI> arrangement must abound with; and having laid it down as a firm maxim, that every system must finally rest on its in∣trinsic merit, he willingly commits his own to the judgment of posterity. Perhaps there is no cir∣cumstance of LINNAEUS'S life, which shews him in a more dignified light, than his conduct to∣wards his opponents. Disavowing controversy, and justly considering it as an unimportant and fruitless sacrifice of time, he never replied to any, numerous as they were at one season.</P>
<P>To all who see the aid this extraordinary man has brought to <HI>natural science,</HI> his talents must appear in a very illustrious point of view; but more especially to those who, from similarity of taste, are qualified to see more distinctly the vast extent of his original design, the greatness of his labour, and the elaborate execution he has given to the whole. He had a happy command of the Latin tongue, which is alone the language of science; and no man ever applied it more successfully to his purposes, or gave to description such copi∣ousness, united with that precision and conciseness, which so eminently characterize his writings.</P>
<P>In the mean time, we are not to learn, that it has been objected as derogatory to his learning in no small degree, that he has introduced a num∣ber of terms not authorized by classical authority. But, granting this, it ought to be recollected, that LINNAEUS, in the investigation of nature, has
<PB N="215" REF="220"/>
discovered a multitude of relations which were entirely unknown to the antients; if therefore there be any force in the objection, it should first be shewn, that the terms which he has introduced to express these relations, are not fairly and analo∣gically deduced from the language; since it must surely be granted, that LINNAEUS could not have spoken the language of <HI>natural history,</HI> as it is known at this day, in that of <HI>Pliny,</HI> or of any clas∣sical writer whatever.</P>
<P>The ardor of LINNAEUS'S inclinations to the study of nature, from his earliest years, and that uncommon application which he bestowed upon it, gave him a most comprehensive view, both of its pleasures and usefulness, at the same time that it opened to him a wide field, hitherto but little cultivated, especially in his own country. Hence he was early led to regret, that the study of natural history, as a public institution, had not made its way into the universities; in many of which, logical dis∣putations, and metaphysical theories, had too long prevailed, to the exclusion of more useful sci∣ence. Availing himself therefore of the advan∣tages which he derived from a large share of elo∣quence, and an animated style, he never failed to display, in a lively and convincing manner, the relation this study hath to the public good; to incite the great to countenance and protect it; to encourage and allure youth into its pursuits, by opening its manifold sources of pleasure to their view, and shewing them how greatly this agreeable employment would add, in a variety of instances,
<PB N="216" REF="221"/>
both to their comfort and emolument. His ex∣tensive view of natural history, as connected with almost all the arts of life, did not allow him to confine these motives and incitements to those only who were designed for the practice of physic. He also laboured to inspire the great and opulent with a taste for this study; and wished particularly that such as were devoted to an ecclesiastic life should share a portion of natural science, not only as a means of sweetening their rural situ∣ation, confined, as many are, perpetually to a country residence, but as what would almost in∣evitably lead, in a variety of instances, to disco∣veries which only such situations could give rise to, and which the learned in great cities could have no opportunities to make. Not to add, that the mutual communication and enlargement of this kind of knowledge among people of equal rank in a country situation, must prove one of the strongest bonds of union and friendship, and con∣tribute, in a much higher degree than the usual perishing amusements of the age, to the pleasures and advantages of society.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS lived to enjoy the fruit of his own labour in an uncommon degree. Natural his∣tory raised itself in <HI>Sweden,</HI> under his culture, to a state of perfection unknown elsewhere, and was from thence disseminated through all <HI>Europe.</HI> His pupils dispersed themselves all over the globe, and with their master's fame, ex∣tended both science and their own. More than this, he lived to see the sovereigns of <HI>Europe</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="222"/>
establish several public institutions in favour of this study, and even professorships established in divers universities for the same purpose, which do honour to their founders and patrons, and which have excited a curiosity for the science, and a sense of its worth, that cannot fail to further its progress, and in time raise it to that rank, which it is entitled to hold among the pursuits of man∣kind.</P>
<P>Were it in our power minutely to describe the person of our author, in conformity to the custom of biographers, it would be a matter of small mo∣ment, as the endowments of his mind, and his great talents, have so superior a claim to atten∣tion. In the commemoration-speech, delivered by his friend Dr. <HI>Baeck,</HI> physician to the king of <HI>Sweden,</HI> LINNAEUS'S stature is described as being <Q REND="margQuotes">diminutive; his head large; his look ardent, piercing, and apt to daunt the beholder. His ear not sensible to music; his temper quick; his memory good, though in the latter period of his life liable to fail him some∣times; his knowledge of languages confined, yet no interesting discovery escaped him. In summer he used to sleep from ten to three o'clock, in winter from nine to six, and instantly to cease from his labours when he found him∣self not well disposed for them. He was an agreeable companion, of quick sensibility, but easily appeased.</Q> Those who would be gra∣tified by forming an idea of his person, may be acquainted, that there are extant three half∣length
<PB N="218" REF="223"/>
prints of LINNAEUS in his works. Two of these are in octavo, and the other in a half∣sheet, or rather large quarto. The first was pre∣fixed to the <HI>Leipsic</HI> edition of the <HI>Systema Naturae,</HI> printed in 1748, and represents LINNAEUS, as we apprehend, in about the fortieth year of his age; another, to the second edition of the <HI>Species Plan∣tarum,</HI> in 1762; and the larger one to the sixth edition of the <HI>Genera Plantarum,</HI> in 1764. In the first and the last of these, which are by much the better engravings, he is figured in an undress, resting upon a volume of the <HI>Systema,</HI> and holding in his hand a sprig of the LINNAEA, a plant so called by Dr. <HI>Gronovius,</HI> in honour of his name. In that of 1762, he is represented in a full dress, with the <HI>insignia</HI> of the <HI>Order of the Polar Star</HI> at his breast, and <HI>Aurivillius</HI>'s inscription under∣neath:
<Q><L>"Hic ille est, cui regna volens natura reclusit,</L>
<L>"Quamque ulli dederat plura videnda dedit."</L></Q></P>
<P>The Academy of Sciences at <HI>Stockholm</HI> have, at their own expence, directed that an engraving of his portrait should be made at <HI>Paris,</HI> from an ori∣ginal picture by the famous <HI>Swedish</HI> painter <HI>Roslin.</HI> There is a striking likeness also exhibited on a large medallion, <HI>a'l'antique,</HI> of almost two feet in dia∣meter, by M. <HI>L'Archeveque.</HI> In <HI>England</HI> we have an elegant small medallion, fabricated by those excellent artists Mess. <HI>Wedgwood</HI> and <HI>Bently.</HI> It represents LINNAEUS in profile, when far advanced in years. The bust is white, upon a light-blue
<PB N="219" REF="224"/>
ground, and the <HI>Linnaea</HI> placed at the breast. This is said, by all who knew the professor, to bear the greatest likeness. We regret that it is not in our power to describe the medals which were struck in honour of LINNAEUS by order of several noblemen of the first distinction in <HI>Sweden,</HI> parti∣cularly that by Count <HI>Tessin</HI>'s direction, since that nobleman was among the first who discerned and patronized the merit of our author, and ever bore to it the most public and honourable testimony. This LINNAEUS hath acknowledged in the warmest effusions of gratitude.</P>
<P>It hath been observed before, that the professor married the daughter of Dr. <HI>More,</HI> the provincial physician of <HI>Dalekarlia,</HI> soon after he settled at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in 1739. This lady survived him; and he has left a son, named <HI>Charles,</HI> and four daughters. The younger <HI>Linnaeus</HI> was demonstra∣tor in the botanical garden at <HI>Upsal,</HI> so early as the year 1762; having in that, and the succeeding year, published two <HI>Decads of rare Plants,</HI> lately raised there, accompanied with the figures. Not long after he was constituted joint professor in the botanical chair with his father; and of late years entirely occupied that department. Since the death of his father, we learn that he has obtained some of his employments, particularly the professorship of the theory of physic; and has resigned that of botany in favour of Dr. <HI>Thunberg.</HI> It has been said, that he intends to publish a MANTISSA TERTIA, which his father left nearly finished; also several collections of plants which had been sent to LIN∣NAEUS,
<PB N="220" REF="225"/>
not long before his death, from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and from several other parts of the world.</P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth Christina,</HI> one of the daughters of our author, made herself known to the learned world, in 1762, by a discovery which was published in the <HI>Swedish Acts</HI> of the same year. It re∣lated to a curious, and before quite unobserved appearance, in the flowers of the <HI>Indian Cresses,</HI> (Tropaeolum majus) which she had perceived to emit spontaneously, at certain intervals, sparks like those of electricity, or rather such as arise from a fulminating powder. This was only visible in the dusk of the evenings, and ceased when total darkness came on. She had shewn this singular appearance to her father, and other philosophers, particularly to Mr. <HI>Wilcke,</HI> a celebrated electrician, who was inclined to believe that it was an electri∣cal phenomenon.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE.</HEAD>
<P>THE collection known under this title con∣sists of seven volumes in 8vo, and contains 150 theses. It is supposed the first volume was not originally collected by LINNAEUS himself; but he at least reprinted it very early, and, that he might not be defrauded of the advantage of these publications, became the editor of all the succeeding volumes. Something has been said relating to this collection in the course of these memoirs; to which we have only to add, that we beg the reader to regard the following pages, as little more than an enlarged table of contents, intended only to excite a due at∣tention to this part of LINNAEUS'S works, which the compiler presumes to be less known than it deserves; and at the same time to entreat him to consider, that it is impossible, by means of any abridgment, to give an adequate idea of that merit, and excellent arrangement of the subjects in these volumes, which cannot but render them an agreeable and useful miscellany, and ornament to the library of every naturalist, philosopher, and physician.</P>

<P>In this dissertation is exhibited a complete his∣tory, accompanied with a figure, of the <HI>Betula</HI> (nana) <HI>foliis orbiculatis crenatis.</HI> Spec. Plant. pp. 1394, or the <HI>Dwarf Birch,</HI> which cloaths the <HI>Lap∣land</HI> alps in great quantities, and is of signal use in the oeconomy of the inhabitants of that arctic region. The branches furnish them with their chief fuel, and the seeds are the food of the ptar∣migans, or white partridge, <HI>(Tetrao Lagopus,</HI> Syst. 274.) These birds, being much esteemed, make a considerable part of the sustenance of the inhabitants: great quantities are caught in the winter season, and sent to different provinces. Before LINNAEUS made his <HI>Lapland</HI> expedition, this <HI>Birch</HI> had been considered as a <HI>variety</HI> only of the common tree of that name; but its distinct specific characters have since been established. This tree has within these few years been added to the <HI>Flora Britannica,</HI> having been found in the highlands of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>

<P>From the earliest times, the cultivation of the fig-tree has been an important object in all the oriental countries. In this dissertation we are presented with a history of this <HI>genus,</HI> of which
<PB N="223" REF="228"/>
the writer has enumerated 22 species: LINNAEUS has however greatly reduced this number, in his <HI>Species Plantarum,</HI> since many are varieties effected by culture. That part of the history of this tree, which for many ages was so enigmatical, and which nothing but the doctrine of the sexes of plants has completely cleared up, namely the husbandry or <HI>caprification,</HI> as it is called, is more particularly worthy of attention, not only as a singular pheno∣menon in itself, but as it has furnished one of the most convincing proofs of the reality of the sexes of plants. Our limits will not allow us to detail this subject; in brief it is this:—It is now known, that the flowers of the fig-tree are situated within a pulpy receptacle, which we call the <HI>Fig,</HI> or fruit of this tree; of these receptacles, in the wild fig-tree, some have male flowers only, and others have male and female, both distinct, though placed in the same receptacle. In the garden, or <HI>cultivated</HI> fig, these are found to contain only fe∣male flowers; which are fecundated by means of a kind of gnat, <HI>(Cynips Psenes,</HI> Syst. Nat. 919.) bred in the fruit of the <HI>wild</HI> fig-trees, which pierces that of the <HI>cultivated,</HI> in order to deposit its eggs within; at the same time diffusing within the re∣ceptacle the <HI>farina</HI> of the male flowers. Without this operation the fruit may ripen, but no <HI>effective</HI> seeds are produced: hence the <HI>garden</HI> fig can only be propagated by layers and cuttings, in these countries, where the <HI>wild</HI> fig is not known. The process of thus ripening the fruit, in the oriental countries, is not left to nature, but is managed
<PB N="224" REF="229"/>
with great art, and different degrees of dexterity, so as to reward the skilful husbandman with a much larger increase of fruit than would other∣wise be produced. A tree of the same size, which, in <HI>Provence,</HI> where caprification is not practised, may produce about 25 pounds of fruit, will, by that art, in the <HI>Grecian</HI> islands, bring ten times that quantity.</P>

It is out of our plan to produce any detail of these arguments; suffice it to say, that although, from the writings of <HI>Theophrastus</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> we learn that the antients had some idea of an analogy in this respect, between the animal and vegetable kingdom, drawn perhaps principally from the artificial mode of foecundating the <HI>date-tree,</HI> yet, so crude and erroneous were their ideas, that in many instances they called those plants male or female, which modern discoveries have taught us are exactly the reverse.

<P>Practical physicians have wished, and some have formed the idea that it is possible, to deduce the virtues of plants from their agreement in similar characters of fructification, in habit or agreement in <HI>natural orders,</HI> or classes. Mr. <HI>Petiver,</HI> long since, was among the first that hazarded some re∣flexions on this subject: see Philosophical Trans∣actions, N<SUP>o</SUP> 255, and <HI>Lowthorp</HI>'s Abridgment, vol. ii. p. 704. And the very eminent Dr. HOFFMANN has a professed dissertation on it, in the fifth volume of his works, p. 58. It is the intention of the present paper, written by this in∣genious but unfortunate disciple of LINNAEUS, to extend and illustrate the same idea, by this com∣mentary on the 12th chapter of the <HI>Philosophia Botanica;</HI> which contains the general doctrine of
<PB N="233" REF="238"/>
this attempt, and an enumeration of those <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>artificial</HI> orders in botany, which are supposed to illustrate and confirm the possibility of attain∣ing this desirable end. To mention a few in∣stances of this agreement in character and qualities: The stellated class, in <HI>Ray</HI>'s system, are mostly <HI>diuretics;</HI> the <HI>asperifoliae,</HI> are chiefly <HI>demulcents;</HI> the <HI>umbelliferous</HI> plants, which grow in dry places, are <HI>aromatics,</HI> particularly the roots and seeds; but if growing in wet situations, usually partake more or less of a deleterious quality. The <HI>Icosan∣drous</HI> plants of LINNAEUS abound with <HI>pulpy</HI> and <HI>esculent</HI> fruits: the <HI>Polyandrous</HI> are many of them poisonous: the <HI>Syngenesious,</HI> in frequent instances, intense <HI>bitters,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>In this tract is discussed at large, that opinion which LINNAEUS early imbibed, and which led him to ascribe to the operation of one and the
<PB N="234" REF="239"/>
same principle, the regular polyedrous figure of all those bodies, called <HI>Chrystals,</HI> acting upon them during their suspension in an aqueous menstruum; and this he conceived to be equally the case, whether these bodies are what we usually call <HI>sa∣line,</HI> or whether they are <HI>lapidose, pyriticose,</HI> or <HI>arsenical;</HI> or finally, whether they are such as are termed <HI>metallic</HI> salts. Hence arose his arrange∣ment of figured <HI>Spars, Selenite, quartzose Chrystals,</HI> including all the <HI>gems</HI> under that <HI>genus</HI> of salt, to which their agreement in figure entitled them to a place. This opinion gave so much offence to mi∣neralogists, that, most probably, it rendered his <HI>System</HI> in the mineral kingdom, much less accept∣able than the other parts of that work had been. In this paper <HI>lapidose</HI> chrystals only are considered; many of which are figured, and described, and referred to the several salts with which they agree in figure. LINNAEUS'S idea on this subject has been lately taken up, and pursued in a very ex∣tensive manner, by M. <HI>de Romé de Lisle,</HI> in an Essay printed at <HI>Paris,</HI> in 1772.

Much controversy has been spent in determining whether these animals have any part that is analo∣gous to the brain or head in other animals; our author affirms the contrary, considering them as <HI>compound animals,</HI> consisting as it were of a chain, every link of which is a perfect animal, furnished with a mouth, and all its proper organs, and ca∣pable, when separated from its original chain, of propagating its species, as if by a vegetative power, and independent of any <HI>oviparous</HI> or <HI>vivi∣parous</HI> process. In this idea he is opposed by Dr. <HI>Tyson,</HI> who has figured the head of the <HI>Taenia Solium</HI> in the Philosophical Transactions; (see N<SUP>o</SUP> 147, and <HI>Lowthrop</HI>'s Abridgment, Vol. iii. p. 130;) as also by <HI>Pallas,</HI> in his <HI>Elenchus Zoophytorum,</HI> and by some other authors. The <HI>Vermes Cucurbitini,</HI> or gourd∣worms of foregoing writers, are now however allow∣ed to be the descending or posterior links of the <HI>Taenia Solium,</HI> and these, according to LINNAEUS, are again capable of extending themselves, and pro∣ducing another chain. According to <HI>Pallas,</HI> and others, these joints are pregnant with <HI>ova.</HI> In either case the reason is at once seen why these noxious creatures are with such difficulty expelled from the human body. LINNAEUS however does not deny that they are capable of propagation by <HI>ova</HI> too; and says, they are found, though much smaller, in muddy springs; to which <HI>Pallas</HI> with difficulty assents. LINNAEUS'S opinion however is confirmed by subsequent observations; and in∣deed

we cannot but observe, that without allow∣ing them to exist elsewhere than in the intestines of animals, it is exceedingly difficult to account for the <HI>locality</HI> of the disease arising from these worms.</P>

<P>In the therapeutic part, notwithstanding all that had been written relating to the power of alkaline medicines in dissolving the connecting gluten, and thus promoting the decomposition of the <HI>Cal∣culus,</HI> the author does not allow them so much merit as hath been attributed to them by many writers.

In∣stances of this admixture, and production of <HI>mon∣sters</HI> in the vegetable kingdom, have been fre∣quent; but, as in the animal kingdom, they have not usually been found to perpetuate themselves by producing fertile seeds. The general effect of culture, and the immense number of species, with which, particularly, many of the <HI>African genera</HI> abound, such as the <HI>Geranium, Erica, Mesembry∣anthemum,</HI> &amp;c. very much favour this hypothesis. A catalogue is given of 34 species of well∣known plants, supposed to have originated in this manner, specifying those also from which they are suspected to have sprung; and a compa∣rison is made between the several parts and habit of each, with the corresponding <HI>hybrid</HI> offspring, to shew the probability of this origin.

<P>Intended to awaken curiosity, and excite atten∣tion to the study of insects, by pointing out the extraordinary instincts and properties with which particular kinds are endued; many of whose operations were inexplicable, and frequently attri∣buted to other causes.</P>
<P>Nothing exemplifies this truth more than the history of a minute insect, or rather worm, of which we have, in this dissertation, the first proper intelligence; it is very curious, and worthy of notice. In <HI>Finland, Bothnia,</HI> and the northern provinces of <HI>Sweden,</HI> it was not unfrequently that people were seized with a pungent pain, confined to a point, in the hand, or other exposed part of the body, which presently increased to a most ex∣cruciating degree, hath sometimes been sud∣denly fatal. This disorder was more particularly observed in <HI>Finland,</HI> especially about boggy and marshy places, and always in autumn. At length it was discovered, that this pain instantly succeeded somewhat that dropped out of the air▪ and in a moment penetrated and buried itself in the flesh. The <HI>Finlanders</HI> had tried variety of applications to no purpose, until at length a poultice of curds, or
<PB N="260" REF="265"/>
cheese, was found the most effectual in easing the pain; and the event confirmed, that the insect was allured by this application to leave the flesh; as on its removal, this worm, no longer than the sixth of an inch, was found in it, and thus the cause of this painful disease explained. LIN∣NAEUS himself once suffered from this animal the effect here spoken of: but we owe the com∣plete history of it, and its place in the System, to Dr. SOLANDER, who gave it in to the Royal Academy of Sciences at <HI>Upsal.</HI> This worm stands in the System under the name of <HI>Furia Infernalis,</HI> p. 1325; but by what means this creature is raised into the air, is as yet unknown.</P>

<P>A curious essay, perhaps the first on the sub∣ject, relating to the <HI>Leafing of Trees</HI> in <HI>Sweden,</HI> being the result of a variety of observations, made at the request of LINNAEUS himself, in almost all the provinces of that kingdom, and intended to lead, as if by the dictates of nature, to the true time of committing the grain to the earth. A table is ex∣hibited, shewing at one view the days on which 19 species of trees, all natives of <HI>Sweden,</HI> put forth their leaves in three successive years. The same table shews also the day on which <HI>Barley</HI> was sown and reaped in all the same provinces. From an∣other table it appears, that at <HI>Pitha,</HI> which lies in about 63 degrees north, from the average of 12 years, there intervene 85 days between the sowing
<PB N="262" REF="267"/>
of barley and its harvest; and at <HI>Upsal,</HI> in 60 de∣grees, the average of six years turned out to be 105 days. It is concluded, upon the whole, that in <HI>Upland,</HI> the leafing of the <HI>Birch-tree</HI> should di∣rect the time for sowing barley; but, that diffe∣rent trees will best indicate the time in different places. Another curious observation follows from this paper: that, notwithstanding the difference in the number of days between the ripening of barley in <HI>Lapland</HI> and in <HI>Upland,</HI> it will be found that the greater <HI>length</HI> of days in the former coun∣try, gives a balance of sun equal to the greater <HI>number</HI> of days in the latter.</P>

The first includes only the antients, by whom are understood <HI>Aristotle, Theophrastus, Dios∣corides,</HI> and <HI>Pliny;</HI> who, as compilers chiefly, did little but deliver the tradition of the times; and whose plants, after the commentaries of a century, cannot be known by their descriptions to this day, so little had they extended their ideas to specific distinctions; yet we must venerate their writings, as the only remains of this science transmitted to our times. The second period commences with the restoration of letters, after the taking of <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> beginning with <HI>Brunfel∣sius,</HI> and ending with the <HI>Bauhines.</HI> The third, which is called the period of <HI>Systematics,</HI> is con∣tinued

to the time of LINNAEUS, who effected that great reformation in the whole science, by which it is fixed as on a new basis.

<P>The intention of this paper is to prove, that the knowledge of the <HI>Natale Solum,</HI> the natural places of growth of plants, is the true foundation on which the art of gardening successfully must be built. The author laments that botanists and writers of <HI>Florae</HI> have been too remiss in their ob∣servations of this kind; whence numbers of exotic seeds and plants have failed to produce flowers, or to perpetuate themselves in gardens.

(Spec. Pl. 638.) which remained destitute of flowers for 20 years in the <HI>Swedish</HI> gardens; at length LINNAEUS rendered it fertile, by means of salt scattered about the roots. The knowledge of the <HI>Stationes Plantarum</HI> is also equally useful to the practical botanist, in assisting his researches.</P>
<P>Every plant has its natural situation and soil, in which alone it will thrive, and out of which, in many instances, no care or culture will preserve it alive.

<P>This work comprehends the plants of <HI>Amboina, Malacca, Banda,</HI> and the neighbouring islands; and, allowing for the time when it was written, contains excellent descriptions of the several vege∣tables of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> with a copious account of their uses; and though inferior to the <HI>Hortus Malabaricus</HI> as to the engravings, excels it in the history of the subjects. There are nearly one thou∣sand vegetables described in this work, of which a great number were entirely new to the <HI>European</HI> botanists: of this number upwards of seven hun∣dred are engraved.</P>
<P>The manuscript was 30 years in the possession of the <HI>Dutch East India</HI> company, and was rescued from oblivion by the interest and extraordinary zeal of the editor, Professor <HI>Burman,</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> who, with great industry and skill, has also ex∣tricated the synonyms as far as possible, and sub∣joined them to each description. He began this
<PB N="272" REF="277"/>
publication in 1741, and finished it in 1750, in seven volumes folio, except a small supplement, which was not published until 1757. In 1769, the editor rendered his work still more useful, by the publication of an alphabetical <HI>index</HI> to these volumes, with the <HI>Linnaean</HI> synonyms; together with a like one adapted to the <HI>Hortus Malaba∣ricus.</HI></P>
<P>The pupils of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> school much re∣gretted, that the <HI>Herbarium Amboinense</HI> had not been completed before the publication of LINNAEUS'S <HI>Species Plantarum,</HI> that the synonyms might have been introduced. To remedy this defect was the intention of Mr. <HI>Stickman</HI>'s paper, in which the sub∣jects are arranged in the order of the original work, with the <HI>Linnaean</HI> name annexed to each; and afterwards, as many as could be extricated, are thrown into a <HI>Flora,</HI> according to the Sexual system.</P>
<P>It is to our neighbours the <HI>Dutch</HI> that the bo∣tanists are obliged for two of the most valuable performances that are yet extant in the history of foreign vegetables: this of <HI>Rumphius,</HI> and the <HI>Hortus Malabaricus</HI> of <HI>Rheede.</HI> But we hope that it will not be long before they will be more indebted to an illustrious <HI>Englishman,</HI> who, in pursuit of the same object, has encountered the perils of a cir∣cuit round this globe, for a work, which, from his taste, his liberality, and zeal for the promo∣tion of science, may be expected to surpass those above-mentioned, as well in extent, as in gran∣deur, and elegance of execution.</P>

<P>The subject of this paper, at the time of its publication, excited the attention of the curious throughout <HI>Europe.</HI> That nocturnal change to which certain plants are liable, and which is here analogically called <HI>Sleep,</HI> is more particularly manifested in those vegetables that are furnished with pinnated leaves, and of these the <HI>Diadel∣phous</HI> class affords the greater number. The change consists in the different position which the <HI>folioles,</HI> or small leaves, assume in the <HI>night</HI>-time, from that which they exhibit by <HI>day.</HI> Slight no∣tices of this faculty are met with in the antients; in this paper the observations have been extended so far, as to take in upwards of 40 species, which are here enumerated, and divided into ten classes, according to the differences observable in the po∣sition of the leaves, during this sleeping state. The late Dr. <HI>Hill,</HI> by a well-instituted set of expe∣riments, fully confirmed the idea, that this change

was owing to the absence of light. His experi∣ments were made with the <HI>Abrus Precatorius,</HI> or scarlet <HI>Indian</HI> Pea, in which plant this change had been observed by <HI>Prosper Alpinus,</HI> and in which it is remarkable.</P>

<P>This plant, notwithstanding the name it bears, is very far removed from the <HI>Fungus</HI> tribe, since it produces perfectly distinct flowers, and belongs to the <HI>Monandria</HI> order of the <HI>Monoecious</HI> class, and is called by LINNAEUS, <HI>Cynomorium Coccineum,</HI> Sp. Pl. 1375. The <HI>Maltese Fungus</HI> is a parasitical plant, singular in its form, which is little more than that of a simple stalk, about a finger's thick∣ness, and six or seven inches long, and in its state of fructification, the whole plant may be consi∣dered as an <HI>Amentum,</HI> or Catkin.

<HEAD>66. METAMORPHOSIS PLANTARUM. <HI>N. E. Dahlberg.</HI> 1755.</HEAD>
<P>The subject of this paper will scarcely admit of an abridgment, agreeable to our contracted plan. In order the more clearly to understand what the author calls the <HI>Metamorphosis Plantarum,</HI> he delivers, in a brief way, the <HI>Linnaean</HI> doctrine of the physio∣logy of plants; which supposes, that the <HI>flower</HI> is no other than the expansion or evolution of the trunk or stem, in the following arrangement: namely, that the <HI>Cortex,</HI> or outer Bark, is ulti∣mately spent in forming the <HI>Perianthium,</HI> or Cup; the <HI>Liber,</HI> or inner Bark, in forming the <HI>Corolla</HI> or Petal; the <HI>Lignum,</HI> or woody part, in forming the <HI>Stamina</HI> or Chives; and the <HI>Medulla,</HI> or pithy part, in forming the <HI>Pistillum,</HI> or Pointal. Hence, what∣soever causes can disturb the usual, natural, and re∣gular expansion and evolution of these parts, may be supposed to occasion great variety, and changes in the appearance of plants; and that such effects are brought about by change of climate, different soil, situation, air, culture, and perhaps various other yet unknown causes, is certain. To these sources must be traced the varieties we observe in the leaves, flowers, and roots, whether permanent, as is the case in some instances, or not. This
<PB N="280" REF="285"/>
doctrine is here illustrated and confirmed by nu∣merous examples; and the young and inexperi∣enced botanist is guarded against the delusion, frequently occasioned by the operation of these causes; which are very extensive in the vegetable creation.</P>

<P>To this end, he first enumerates all the alpine parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and gives a list of 400 plants pe∣culiar to those situations. He expresses a wish, that at the royal, or public expence, a garden might be planted in the <HI>alps,</HI> to determine with precision what exotic plants would bear introduction into <HI>Lapland;</HI> and concludes by pointing out some of the esculent and medicinal kinds, as also some that are applicable to dyeing, and other arts, which he thinks might be culti∣vated to advantage in that northern region.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Ecmark</HI> observes, that the greater number of migrating birds belong to the <HI>flat-billed</HI> order <HI>(Anseres),</HI> particularly to the Goose and Merganser <HI>genera;</HI> and to the Waders, <HI>(Grallae):</HI> the former mostly breed in the extreme north, where, from the relation of LINNAEUS, their number almost darkens the air, and they are driven southward by the freezing of the lakes and rivers. Numbers also of the small-billed birds <HI>(Passeres),</HI> especially those with <HI>slender bills,</HI> are of the migrating class. The <HI>insectivorous</HI> retire southwards when our winter advances, as <HI>others</HI> in that season visit us for the sake of berries.</P>
<P>It is no small merit in Mr. <HI>Ecmark,</HI> that in this paper he brings together, in one view, more com∣pletely
<PB N="288" REF="293"/>
than any other writer had done, all the known species of migrating birds, whether exotic, or indigenous to <HI>Sweden.</HI> He gives a list of all such as are mentioned in the writings of <HI>Catesby, Klein,</HI> and <HI>Hasselquist;</HI> but the most considerable part of his tract is employed in a methodical enu∣meration of the indigenous birds of <HI>Sweden,</HI> under each of which he mentions, as fully as is yet pos∣sible, the particular times of their several migra∣tions, the places whither they resort, their food, &amp;c. and intersperses many other remarks, equally curious and satisfactory to those who wish for in∣formation in this part of natural history.</P>

<HEAD>76. MORBI EXPEDITIONIS CLASSICAE, 1756. <HI>P. Bierchen.</HI> 1757.</HEAD>
<P>The author of this tract was physician to the fleet of observation, which was fitted out in the beginning of the last war between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> to act in conjunction with the <HI>Danes,</HI> in the north sea. The <HI>Swedish</HI> squa∣dron consisted of eight ships of the line, besides frigates. When M. <HI>Bierchen</HI> took his appoint∣ment in <HI>August,</HI> he found not fewer than 1900 men on the sick list; and that the principal diseases were <HI>Fluxes, Fevers,</HI> and the <HI>Scurvy.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> were attended with great pain in the bowels, extreme weakness, fever, and a very weak pulse. The <HI>Fevers</HI> were of that kind which has been
<PB N="289" REF="294"/>
called the <HI>Upsal Fever,</HI> from its having been re∣markably epidemical in that city and neighbour∣hood. This disease was evidently of that class which is called <HI>putrid,</HI> and was much more acute in summer than in autumn. It was at∣tended with frequent and obstinate <HI>haemorrhages</HI> from the nose, early in the disease; a quiet kind of <HI>delirium; trembling tongue; twitching tendons; deafness; petechiae;</HI> and <HI>vibices</HI> on the skin. As the heat declined, <HI>haemorrhages</HI> were not so much observed; the disorder attacked with <HI>pain</HI> and <HI>las∣situde</HI> of body, <HI>vertigo</HI> and <HI>pain</HI> in the head, <HI>cough</HI> and <HI>oppression</HI> of the breast; and was afterwards attended with <HI>cardialgia, nausea, vomiting, turbid,</HI> and sometimes in the decline, <HI>bloody urine.</HI> Also great <HI>prostration</HI> of strength, <HI>weak pulse,</HI> and <HI>sub∣sultus tendinum,</HI> were symptoms of this fever; and many were seized in the beginning with violent <HI>fluxes.</HI> The <HI>Scurvy</HI> seems to have been attended with no other than the usual symptoms.</P>
<P>Our author appears to have been very solicitous in his endeavours to find out the cause of the ex∣treme prevalence of this disease in the fleet. In the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> besides the use of salted meats, he attri∣butes much to the want of sufficient exercise on board the ships; and confirms the observations of some other writers, that the disease, independent of regimen or diet, decreased when the fleet was out at sea, and consequently the ships more agi∣tated by wind and waves, and the men more em∣ployed; and that it augmented when they were in a state of inaction in port. He condemns the use
<PB N="290" REF="295"/>
of fat and lard, as difficult of coction, and favour∣able to the disease. In the cure, he recommends acids; and says, he used principally the <HI>vitriolic:</HI> but above all he celebrates the praises of <HI>sour∣krout;</HI> for the efficacy of which he also cites the authority and experience of Sir <HI>John Pringle.</HI></P>
<P>He considers the <HI>Fevers</HI> as arising from impeded perspiration, co-operating with the effects of cold, moist, and foul air; and in <HI>this expedition,</HI> he thinks, the insufficiency of proper cloathing dur∣ing the <HI>watches</HI> might not unfrequently be found a predisposing cause. He is of opinion that the disease was contagious; and says, many were cured by the early exhibition of <HI>emetics.</HI> In the general method of cure, the practice laid down by our later writers in <HI>England</HI> was successfully pur∣sued.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fluxes</HI> and <HI>Dysenteric</HI> disorders he ascribes particularly to the prevalence of <HI>saline</HI> and <HI>putrid</HI> acrimony in the food of seamen; aided by foul air, and want of exercise, and propagated at length by contagion too.</P>
<P>Our author concludes, by suggesting that there are two causes, of a general and permanent nature, which predispose to these diseases in all naval ex∣peditions. These are, <HI>impure air,</HI> and a constant depression of spirits in seamen, not hitherto suffi∣ciently attended to, and inducing a degree of real <HI>Nostalgia.</HI> He seems to be sufficiently aware of the importance of correcting the first, and re∣commends strongly the use of <HI>ventilators;</HI> to the other it is not easy to apply a remedy. He informs us, that both <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Swiss</HI> find the greatest
<PB N="291" REF="296"/>
relief, in the <HI>Maladie du pais,</HI> next to their return home, from strong exercise: however he hints his wishes, that the <HI>pay</HI> of the men was advanced, as one of the best means of inspiring them with chear∣fulness and hilarity, necessary to counterbalance this evil, at least in some degree.</P>
<P>To conclude, the subject of this paper has been so well treated by several later judicious writers amongst us, that the <HI>English</HI> physician cannot ex∣pect to meet with much new matter in this dis∣sertation; but it is nevertheless very worthy the regard of all who wish to make themselves acquaint∣ed with the diseases of the navy.</P>

<HEAD>77. FEBRIS UPSALIENSIS. <HI>A. Bostrom.</HI> 1757.</HEAD>
<P>The fever here described, which had been re∣markably epidemical in divers parts of <HI>Sweden,</HI> but particularly at <HI>Upsal,</HI> for several years before this time, and which had by many been supposed to be a new distemper, Dr. <HI>Bostrom</HI> considers as of the <HI>Remittent</HI> class, and common in all other parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> He has determined its type to be that of the <HI>Hemitritaea</HI> of LINNAEUS, (see <HI>Gen. Morb.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 23.) or the <HI>Semitertian</HI> of authors. In some years indeed, he observes, that it seemed to have changed its form, was attended with <HI>Petechiae,</HI> and became contagious, under which appearance it was named <HI>Febris Petechizans,</HI> and <HI>Febris Nervosa,</HI> when attended particularly with <HI>delirium</HI> and spasms. In its milder state, especially in the spring, it as∣sumed a regular <HI>quotidian,</HI> or <HI>continued tertian</HI> type.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="297"/>
In seeking the causes of the frequency of this fever, in <HI>Upsal</HI> particularly, our author accedes to that opinion which attributes <HI>intermitting</HI> and <HI>exacerbating</HI> fevers to the effects of <HI>moist</HI> and <HI>foul</HI> air, and thinks, from the situation of the city of <HI>Upsal,</HI> the closeness of the streets, and especially from the stagnating canals and waters, that its pre∣valence in that city may fairly be referred to this cause. To confirm his opinion, he cites two re∣markable instances of cities rendered free from these fevers, by leading off, and drying up, stagnant and putrid waters.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Prognostics,</HI> he says, a stiffness of the neck was not uncommon, and that it usually betokened a long continuance of the disease; and frequently ended in convulsions, or other dangerous affec∣tions of the nervous system.</P>
<P>The cure of this fever was usually begun by giving gentle <HI>emetics,</HI> and repeating them for a few days occasionally; without which it was observed, that the <HI>bark,</HI> and other remedies, failed to have their proper effect. Gentle <HI>paregorics</HI> and saline medicines were interposed, and the following preparation of the bark exhibited:—One ounce was infused in five ounces of red wine for a few hours, the residuum boiled in water to eight ounces, and three ounces of syrup of oranges mixed with this tincture and decoction. Of this a dose was given every two hours. Dr. <HI>Bostrom</HI> entirely forbids bleeding, having commonly found it hurtful.</P>

<P><PB N="297" REF="302"/>
He next proceeds to shew the several analogies that subsist in the symptoms of contagious diseases; and as <HI>Animalcula</HI> have been demonstrated in the <HI>Itch,</HI> and, as he thinks, in the <HI>Dysentery</HI> too; so he tells us, they have been seen in the Measles, by <HI>Langius;</HI> in the Pestilence, by <HI>Kircher;</HI> in the Siphylis, by <HI>Hauptman;</HI> in Petechiae, by <HI>Sigler;</HI> in the Small-pox, by <HI>Lusitanus</HI> and <HI>Porcellus;</HI> as also in the Serpigo, and other cutaneous affections.

<P>In the <HI>Itch,</HI> the existence of the <HI>Acarus Siro,</HI> Syst. p. 1024,) is acknowledged, and he thinks it not less certain, that a species of this genus exists as the cause of <HI>Dysenteries:</HI> to this opinion the au∣thor was led by a singular fact, that occurred to Dr. <HI>Rolander,</HI> during his residence in Professor LINNAEUS'S house; he had been infested with the <HI>Dysentery</HI> for some time, and had been relieved twice by taking rhubarb, but the disease recurred, commonly, at the end of about eight days. He was the only one in the house thus affected; and was put by the Professor, upon examining his <HI>egesta,</HI> with a view to prove the truth of <HI>Bartho∣line</HI>'s assertion, who relates that he had seen the alvine dejections full of the most minute insects in this disease. Dr. <HI>Rolander</HI>'s observation on his own state confirmed the fact; and he afterwards discovered, that these <HI>Animalcula</HI> were conveyed

<P>The purport of this dissertation is to combat, and abolish a long-established vulgar error, which nevertheless prevailed until the time of <HI>Harvey,</HI> among some men of considerable knowledge, and even now still subsists among the vulgar, in some parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> namely, that one kind of grain was convertible, by different soils, into an inferior, distinct, and more useless species: thus, that <HI>Wheat,</HI> in an impoverished soil, would change to <HI>Rye:</HI> this, to <HI>Barley: Barley,</HI> into <HI>Darnel:</HI> this, into <HI>Brome-grass: Brome-grass,</HI> into <HI>Oats.</HI> Some of the antients carried their belief farther, supposing, on the other hand, that in fertile lands, the reverse would take place. As these ideas were repugnant to truth, so they were in many cases unfriendly to improvement. This author, after having ob∣served, that among the <HI>Romans</HI> the <HI>Res Rustica</HI> was held in such estimation, that even the men of quality themselves disdained not to cultivate agriculture, laments that in modern times it is too much ne∣glected by the great; he therefore urges gentle∣men

to pursue the history and philosophy of vegetables, through the whole extent of them, as the foundation of practical improvements. With this view, he refers them to the many excellent papers thereon, contained in this collec∣tion: and from the physiology of plants, the consi∣deration of the mechanism of them, and particu∣larly that of the parts of fructification, he shews the futility of the opinion, which he had under∣taken to confute, and particularly levels his argu∣ments against that part of it which has gained the most belief, and remained longest in the minds of his countrymen and the peasants, that <HI>Oats</HI> are mutable into <HI>Rye.</HI></P>

And further, that the <HI>"Sapida,</HI> or those which more sensibly strike the <HI>taste</HI> than the smell, do principally operate on the <HI>vascular</HI> and <HI>vital</HI> system:" and that the <HI>"Olida,</HI> or those which more sensibly strike the organs of smelling, operate on the <HI>medullary</HI> or <HI>nervous</HI> sys∣tem." The <HI>Sapor Medicamentorum</HI> of this collec∣tion,
<PB N="303" REF="308"/>
N<SUP>o</SUP> 30, may be considered as a comment on the first part of this general distribution of medi∣cines, distinguished by the term <HI>Sapida;</HI> and the present <HI>thesis</HI> as an explanation of a large division of the <HI>Olida,</HI> here called <HI>Graveolentia,</HI> from their strong and ungrateful smell.</P>
<P>The combinations of <HI>Sapids</HI> and <HI>Olids</HI> are innu∣merable; but that simples, strictly of the latter kind, do, in a sudden and extraordinary manner, exert their influence on the nerves, is certain; though our author contents himself with the fact, without enquiring whether the functions of the nerves are performed by means of animal spirits, by vibration, the medium of electricity, or by any other way. And from the <HI>Graveolentia,</HI> which are the subject of his thesis, he justly observes, that we derive some of the most powerful remedies. Of these he gives a catalogue, dividing them into three classes: 1. SUBINSIPID. 2. ACRID. 3. BIT∣TER: each of which is subdivided into two orders, as the subjects differ in degrees of strength. The <HI>Subinsipid</HI> contains chiefly the Narcotics: the <HI>Acrid</HI> several of the purging, and fetid roots; the fetid gums, and carminative seeds: the <HI>Bitter</HI> con∣tains others of the purging roots and leaves; and some of the bitter herbs. Under each, the au∣thor specifies, in technical terms, very briefly, the quality, and the diseases to which it has been ap∣propriated.</P>
<P>He then presents us with a concise, but very in∣structive theory, of the operation of this division of the <HI>Olida;</HI> leaving to the consideration of others, the <HI>Suaveolentia:</HI> after which, follows a general
<PB N="304" REF="309"/>
pathology of those diseases which are remedied by the <HI>Graveolentia.</HI></P>
<P>In treating on the use of external applications, Dr. <HI>Fagraeus</HI> appears to be dissatisfied with the common theory of repellents, which are usually drawn from the styptic class; and thinks, that the first class of <HI>Graveolentia,</HI> the <HI>Narcotics,</HI> which he supposes to induce a relaxation, or temporary palsy, in an inflamed part, more effectually pro∣mote a return of the stagnating and accumulating fluids into the circulation, than any styptics can possibly effect, and are therefore more justly en∣titled to that term.</P>

<HEAD>94. ANIMALIA COMPOSITA. <HI>A. Back.</HI> 1759.</HEAD>
<P>Under the term <HI>Animalia Composita</HI> are compre∣hended the two last orders of the class of <HI>Vermes,</HI> making the last links in the chain of animal na∣ture; and thus connecting it with the vegetable kingdom. These (in opposition to those of the three foregoing orders of the same class, which live simple and separate from each other) are called <HI>Compound Animals,</HI> as being connected together by one common base or support, either in the form of irregular or rudely-branched stony masses, of a calcareous nature, as the <HI>Lithophyta,</HI> or Corals; or, as fixed to one common stalk more or less branched, as the <HI>Zoophyta,</HI> or Corallines, and some others.</P>
<P>In order to give a more perfect idea of the na∣ture of these animals, the author holds forth the general analogy between animals and vegetables, principally to shew that the former are not, like the latter, endowed with that multiplicative power of propagating themselves without the particular energy and exertion of the generative function; whereas the <HI>Animalia Composita</HI> seem to unite these powers, since they not only appear to propagate by <HI>eggs,</HI> or <HI>viva soboles,</HI> but also by progressive extension and ramification.</P>
<P>The animals of the LITHOPHYTA, like the <HI>Testacea,</HI> fabricate their own base of calcareous
<PB N="311" REF="316"/>
matter, forming the whole mass into tubes, each ending on the surface, in pores or cells, according to their specific difference, where alone the animal seems to dwell, and extending these habitations progressively, in the manner of vegetables, leaving the base at length to perish.</P>
<P>The animals of the <HI>Zoophyta,</HI> containing the Corallines, &amp;c. particularly the <HI>fixed</HI> ones, approach much nearer than the foregoing to vegetables, both in their texture and form in general, arising as if from a root, and forming a stem and branches, which are beset at the extremities and articulations with the animals, or <HI>Polypes,</HI> appearing by the help of glasses like so many flowers.</P>

<HEAD>95. FLORA CAPENSIS. <HI>C. H. Wannman.</HI> 1759.</HEAD>
<P>In the time of the <HI>Romans</HI> it was a trite proverb, <HI>that Africa was the land of wonders;</HI> and it still re∣mains true, as in these days it affords, both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, some of the most stupendous and singular productions of nature. From the first discovery of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> from whence <HI>Europe</HI> has chiefly been furnished with the plants of <HI>Africa,</HI> their uncommon aspect, so very different from those of <HI>Europe,</HI> has attracted the notice, not only of naturalists, but of all man∣kind; and as the mildness of that climate allowed of their cultivation here, they soon became fa∣vourites in the <HI>English</HI> gardens.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="317"/>
Some of the first <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> plants that were brought to <HI>Europe,</HI> we owe to <HI>J. Heurnius,</HI> who sent them to his brother, a professor at <HI>Ley∣den;</HI> and they are figured in <HI>Bodeus á Stapel's Theo∣phrastus,</HI> p. 333; among these were the Indian Reed, <HI>(Canna Indica),</HI> the <HI>Haemanthus Coccineus, Stapelia,</HI> the <HI>Aletris Uvaria,</HI> and a few others. But the first botanist who visited the <HI>Cape</HI> was <HI>Paul Herman;</HI> he collected 800 species, then unknown in <HI>Europe:</HI> after him <HI>H. B. Oldenland,</HI> a <HI>Dane,</HI> and <HI>J. Hartog,</HI> a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> both made collections of <HI>African</HI> plants, which at length falling into the hands of the present able professor of botany at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> Dr. <HI>John Burman,</HI> he published en∣gravings of <HI>ten decads</HI> of the more rare kinds. From these materials chiefly the present <HI>Flora</HI> is composed, according to the usual plan, with the <HI>trivial</HI> names only.</P>
<P>Among the plants of the <HI>Cape,</HI> there are 38 <HI>genera</HI> peculiar to that part of the world, several of which excel all others in the number of species, as well as in their uncommon and superb appearance. The vast number of species under the same genus, so frequently met with in that country, strongly favours the idea of the perpetual new origin of plants; and that many, which elsewhere are only <HI>hybrid,</HI> there propagate and become permanent. But <HI>Caffraria,</HI> beyond all other countries, abounds with extensive genera of plants: the succulent kinds, particularly, cover the sandy soil, where nothing but the fact could convince us that vege∣tation would in any degree succeed. Such are the
<PB N="313" REF="318"/>
Fig-marygolds, <HI>(Mesembryanthema),</HI> Aloes, <HI>Purs∣lanes,</HI> &amp;c. Among the others, we are astonished with the variety of the <HI>Heaths,</HI> (Ericae), <HI>Gerania, Protaeae,</HI> and <HI>Gnaphalia.</HI></P>
<P>Since the publication of M. <HI>Wannman</HI>'s thesis, great discoveries in botany have been made in southern <HI>Africa</HI> by <HI>Thunberg</HI> and <HI>Sparmann,</HI> and by Mr. <HI>Masson;</HI> and we have reason to expect a com∣plete account of the plants of that country from Dr. <HI>Laurence Burman,</HI> son of professor <HI>J.

<HEAD>101. GENERATIO AMBIGENA. <HI>C. L. Ramstrom.</HI> 1759.</HEAD>
<P>The author begins his subject with a concise view of the antient and modern theories relating to this obscure affair He observes, that the antient doctrine of <HI>equivocal</HI> generation prevailed in gene∣ral, until <HI>Harvey</HI> exploded it, and taught that every animal is generated <HI>ex ovo;</HI> and that his sys∣tem may now be considered as including a double hypothesis: first, that taught by himself, which supposes the entire rudiments of the future <HI>foetus</HI> to be present in the <HI>ovum,</HI> and only waiting for animation from the vivifying principle, or <HI>aura genitalis masculina;</HI> the other, that of the <HI>seminal animalcule</HI> entering into the <HI>ovum,</HI> according to the theory arising from <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI>'s microscopical discoveries. We have before observed that LIN∣NAEUS very early forsook <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI>'s theory, in consequence of attending <HI>Liëberkuhn</HI>'s demonstra∣tions. The argument of the present hypothesis tends to shew, that both sexes are equally efficient in this work; leaning however to the following opinion, "that the external form, as well as the specific energy, of the vital functions, are princi∣pally derived from the male parent." This is partly the opinion also of the very eminent Dr. <HI>Haller,</HI> Phys. § 786. Our intended brevity does not allow us to pursue our author through all his

arguments in behalf of his hypothesis; we must rest satisfied with observing, that after drawing a physiological analogy between vegetables and ani∣mals, he thinks it <HI>evident</HI> that in both, the <HI>male</HI> is most commonly conspicuous in the <HI>external form:</HI> and this he illustrates by several examples of <HI>hybrid</HI> species in both the vegetable and animal king∣dom.</P>

<HEAD>103. THESES MEDICAE. <HI>J. C. D. Schreber.</HI> 1760.</HEAD>
<P>In this dissertation, Dr. <HI>Schreber</HI> delivers a brief view of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> doctrine, relating to the ana∣tomy and physiology of plants, in which he endea∣vours to sustain the following theses:—That all plants consist of a <HI>medullary</HI> and <HI>cortical</HI> substance; in the former of which is manifested the life of the plant, and through which it is perpetuated, either by seeds or buds, which are considered as the ulti∣mate extension of this part. The <HI>cortical</HI> part is considered as the organ of nutrition to the whole.—That, as in a number of certain species of plants, which in artificial systems form a <HI>genus,</HI> we see a similar proportion and agreement of the parts of fructification, howsoever different the external form of the whole plant; and as we not unfrequent∣ly see <HI>hybrid</HI> plants produced, he therefore proposes it as a matter worthy of speculation, whether, ori∣ginally, <HI>all</HI> the species have not been produced in the same way, by the various admixtures of the <HI>farina.</HI> From this power in the <HI>medullary</HI> part, of perpetuating itself, and modifying the whole
<PB N="320" REF="325"/>
internal structure, the author also deduces the similar qualities which are commonly found in plants of the same genus, as manifested by the <HI>taste</HI> and <HI>smell.</HI></P>

<P>It is not surprizing, that in a country abounding with iron, chalybeate waters should be frequent.

<P>A very circumstantial, botanical, and medical history of the Coffee-tree, and its fruit, <HI>(Coffaea Arabica,</HI> Sp. Pl. p. 245.)

<P><PB N="326" REF="331"/>
Coffee, originally the produce of <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> where the best is <HI>now</HI> most successfully culti∣vated, is called, by the <HI>Egyptians, Bon,</HI> and is first mentioned by the <HI>Arabians</HI> about the year 900. Our author says, it was brought into <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> about the year 1645, and that the first public coffee-house was set up at <HI>Marseilles</HI> in 1671. The shrub itself was introduced into the <HI>European</HI> gar∣dens about the year 1710, by means of seeds pro∣cured from <HI>Arabia,</HI> by Governor <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> of <HI>Batavia,</HI> who also first cultivated it in <HI>America,</HI> at <HI>Surinam.</HI></P>
<P>We are next presented with the classical, gene∣rical, and specific character of this plant; to which succeeds a copious list of synonyms, and the description at large, as it stands in the <HI>Hortus Cliffortianus.</HI> The culture of the shrub; the pre∣paration of the berry; the different times and modes of drinking this liquor, which custom hath established in the various nations; and the <HI>succe∣danea</HI> to this berry, are then discussed. Among the latter are mentioned <HI>Pease, Beans, Beech-nuts, Almonds, Maiz, Wheat,</HI> and the seeds of the <HI>Sun∣flower, (Helianthus Annuus).</HI> Vide <HI>Gouan. Flor. Monsp.</HI> p. 456. Of these he prefers Almonds, but he observes that they dispose to flatulency much more than Coffee.</P>
<P>In speaking of the qualities and virtues of Cof∣fee, our author thinks it should rather be classed with medicines, than considered as a nutritive ar∣ticle in diet. He appears to be no friend to its frequent and indiscriminate use: he thinks it de∣stroys rather than creates appetite: that it occasions
<PB N="327" REF="332"/>
<HI>watchfulness;</HI> and promotes <HI>flatulence</HI> and <HI>indigestion,</HI> instead of relieving them, as is generally believed: that it <HI>debilitates the nerves,</HI> and occasions <HI>tremblings.</HI> On this occasion he thinks it worth enquiry, whe∣ther it may not contribute to those sudden deaths which are frequent at <HI>Stockholm</HI> about the winter solstice, as they have been observed to happen to such as were inordinate drinkers of this liquor: that it is <HI>antiaphrodisiac,</HI> he says, is generally al∣lowed; and he illustrates and confirms this qua∣lity by a pleasant tale from <HI>Olearius</HI>'s Travels: that it <HI>weakens the sight;</HI> is noxious to <HI>melancholic, hypochondriacal,</HI> and <HI>hysterical</HI> people: that it pro∣motes <HI>hemorrhages</HI> of all kinds; and that a free indulgence in the use of this liquor cannot be safe, except to the corpulent.</P>
<P>Considered as a medicine, from its heating qua∣lity it is forbidden in <HI>fevers.</HI> From its stimulating and drying quality, allowed by all physicians, is deduced its usefulness in <HI>corpulency,</HI> and in the <HI>leucorrhaea.</HI> It has been considered as an <HI>anthel∣minthic;</HI> but its ill effects on the tender habits of children, more than balance any good ones in that way. In <HI>soporose affections,</HI> in <HI>phlegmatic</HI> and <HI>cor∣pulent</HI> habits, our author allows its use; and from its known effect in promoting hemorrhages, it must be considered as an <HI>emmenagogue.</HI> That <HI>head-achs</HI> are frequently relieved by Coffee, is con∣firmed by daily experience; and our author relates that LINNAEUS himself found it singularly useful in taking off a <HI>cardialgia,</HI> with which he was affected at the time he was physician to the fleet, in 1740; and which he attributed to the effluvia of the hos∣pital,

There are three species, the two first of which were described and figured by <HI>Pére Feuillée</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> who ranked them with the <HI>Hemerocallis,</HI> or Day Lily.

He then inlarges on <HI>specifical</HI> dis∣tinctions, and shews what constitutes <HI>varieties</HI> in plants. He proceeds to consider the generation of <HI>hybrid</HI> plants, concerning which he favours the opinion laid down in the <HI>Generatio Ambigena,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. 101 of this collection; that the internal struc∣ture, or parts of fructification in hybrid plants, resemble the <HI>impregnated</HI> plant, and the habit, or external parts, that which furnished the <HI>farina foecundans.</HI> A singular instance of this kind is brought from the <HI>Verbascum</HI> genus.

Under the <HI>founders</HI> of the science after the restoration of letters. 2. Under the <HI>systematics.</HI> And, 3. under the auspices of the great <HI>Swedish</HI> botanist.</P>
<P N="1">1. Among the restorers of botany, <HI>Brunsfelsius, Tragus, Gesner, Fuchsius,</HI> and <HI>Cordus,</HI> stand foremost in the list. They may be said to close with <HI>Caspar Bauhine,</HI> who by his incomparable <HI>Pinax,</HI> in which he collected all their synonyms into one work, gave use to their writings and improvement to the study, which otherwise it could not have acquired.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Bauhine</HI> having laid this foundation, the knowledge of plants made a rapid progress in the seventeenth century, and received vast addition from the discoveries of <HI>Cornutus, Marcgrave,</HI> and <HI>Piso,</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> from those of <HI>Herman, Rheede,</HI> and <HI>Commelin,</HI> in <HI>Asia;</HI> from <HI>Sloane, Plukenet, Pe∣tiver,</HI> and <HI>Sherard;</HI> from <HI>Tournefort,</HI> and <HI>Plumier:</HI> during which period also it was reduced to <HI>system,</HI> from the hints of <HI>Gesner;</HI> first, by <HI>Caesalpinus,</HI> and afterwards, more successfully, by <HI>Morison, Ray,</HI> and <HI>Tournefort.</HI></P>

This author dates the <HI>epoch</HI> of <HI>reformation</HI> from the first publication by LINNAEUS in 1735; and then collects together into one view the im∣provement it has received from the labours of this great man. He enumerates the several disciples of LINNAEUS, who assisted him, by their travels into foreign parts; adds a list of those writers that have followed his method; and closes with a sketch of what is yet wanting to give further perfection to the science.</P>

<HEAD>118. PROLEPSIS PLANTARUM. <HI>H. Ulmark.</HI> 1760.</HEAD>
<P>The theory of vegetation built by <HI>Malpighi</HI> and <HI>Grew,</HI> on the anatomy of plants, and that of <HI>Hales</HI> and others, drawn from what may be called their physiology, has not been followed in the <HI>Linnaean</HI> school. LINNAEUS early conceived the idea of an analogy between plants and animals, and speaks of vegetables also, as consisting of a <HI>medullary</HI> and <HI>cortical</HI> substance, (in the former of which the pro∣per life and principle of vegetation resides, and by which alone it is propagated) considering the latter as the organs of nourishment to the former. This idea seems also to have led him to adopt the opinion of <HI>Caesalpinus,</HI> relating to the evolution of these two parts, in the order which is mentioned in the 66th thesis; namely, that the <HI>Cortex,</HI> or outer Bark, is ultimately spent in forming the <HI>Perianthium,</HI> or Cup of the flower, besides which, it must be ob∣served, that the leaves are produced from the cor∣tical substance only; the <HI>Liber,</HI> or inner Bark, in the Corolla or Petals; the <HI>Lignum,</HI> or woody part,
<PB N="336" REF="341"/>
in the <HI>Stamina</HI> or Chives; and the <HI>Medulla,</HI> or pithy part, in the <HI>Pistillum</HI> and Seed.</P>
<P>Principally to confirm and illustrate these <HI>data</HI> is the design of this <HI>thesis,</HI> which in fact is a com∣ment on a part of the 24th section of the Introduc∣tion to the second tome of the <HI>System,</HI> p. 9, con∣taining a concise view of this doctrine. Before the author proceeds to his immediate subject, he reca∣pitulates, with the forementioned, some other prin∣ciples, relating to the life and organization of vegetables, and then endeavours to prove, by appearances observable in plants, that this arrange∣ment of parts, and this evolution actually exists. As this cannot be so aptly illustrated in annual and other plants, on account of the tender texture, and quick growth, the author endeavours to exemplify it from observations made on the bud-bearing trees; in which he observes, that the full evolution of the parts, from the origin of the bud to the expansion of the flower, as the final act of vegetation in each, is a progressive work, the ac∣complishment of which requires five or six years, and that it takes place in the following order: That the <HI>Leaves,</HI> which are unconnected with the <HI>medullary</HI> substance, and derive their origin from the <HI>cortical,</HI> are the produce of the first year; and in plants and trees that are furnished with <HI>Bracte,</HI> or floral Leaves, that such are the issue of the second year; and the <HI>Perianthium,</HI> or Cup of the flower, of the third; the <HI>Petals</HI> of the fourth; the <HI>Stamina</HI> of the fifth; and the <HI>Pistil,</HI> &amp;c. of the sixth. Our author endeavours to sustain this theory

by a number of facts and observations, tending to corroborate the doctrine advanced in this dis∣sertation.</P>

<HEAD>120. PROLEPSIS PLANTARUM. <HI>J. J. Ferber.</HI> 1763.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ferber,</HI> who is probably the same per∣son that has published <HI>Physico-geographical Tra∣vels into Italy,</HI> endeavours, in this paper, as Mr. <HI>Ulmark</HI> hath done, to illustrate and con∣firm the theory of vegetation received in the <HI>Up∣sal</HI> school.</P>
<P>He first treats on the food of plants; which, without entering into any subtle disquisitions re∣lating to its elementary principles and composition, is defined to be the watery tincture of the soil, re∣ceived by the roots, and transmitted to the <HI>medullary</HI> by the vascular part of the <HI>cortical</HI> substance. He establishes it as a fact, that too great an afflux of nutriment thrown into the <HI>cortical</HI> part, retards the fructification, by compressing the <HI>medullary.</HI> He
<PB N="338" REF="343"/>
thinks this is proved by the state of luxuriant plants in general, and by the effects of depriving them of this superfluity: on which head he quotes the experiments of Mr. <HI>Fitzgerald,</HI> re∣corded in the <HI>Philos. Transact.</HI> vol. lii. p. 71, as confirming the truth of the theory here ad∣vanced.</P>
<P>After having established the cortical part as the organ and deposit of nutriment, he proceeds to shew, that <HI>heat alone</HI> excites to action and vigour, the life or protrusive and expansive force of the medullary part; which is ever spent in propagat∣ing the plant, by forming <HI>buds, bulbs,</HI> or <HI>seed,</HI> as its final and most perfect issue: and that this in∣tention of nature succeeds in a proportion equal to the degree of nutriment afforded by the cortical, to that of the heat administered to the medullary part respectively.</P>
<P>In the second chapter, M. <HI>Ferber</HI> treats on the origin and evolution of buds; in which he accedes to the doctrine of the progressive perfection of them, mentioned in the dissertation just reviewed.</P>
<P>The last chapter is appropriated to the <HI>Involu∣tion of Plants</HI> in the Seed, Buds, and Bulbs; in which he asserts, that in the seeds of the <HI>Nymphaea Nelumbo,</HI> the very leaves of the future plant are visible. In bulbs the rudiment of the next year's plant is also conspicuous: in like manner buds contain the perfect plant, although the evolution in these requires a longer process.</P>
<P>Those who would attain a complete idea of the theory of vegetation, advanced in the works of our author, are referred more particularly to the
<PB N="339" REF="344"/>
following papers in the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 24. <HI>Gemmatio Arborum,</HI> 63. <HI>Metamorphosis Plantarum,</HI> 101. <HI>Generatio Ambigena,</HI> 118, 120. <HI>Prolepsis Plan∣tarum;</HI> and to the <HI>Introduction to the Vegetable System.</HI></P>
<P>[It may be observed, that there is a set of ex∣periments made by M. <HI>Mustel,</HI> printed in the <HI>Phil.

Yet it must be allowed that too many difficulties attend every theory on this obscurc subject.]</P>

<P>Insects were scarcely noticed before the time of <HI>Conrad Gesner,</HI> whose comprehensive mind extended over the whole field of nature. He, together with <HI>Mouffet,</HI> and <HI>Aldrovand,</HI> may be said to have laid the foundation of entomological science. To these succeeded another set of writers, who were princi∣pally employed in investigating the economy and surprizing metamorphoses of insects; such were <HI>Geodart, Lister, Swammerdam,</HI> and <HI>Reaumur,</HI> to whom may be added Madam <HI>Merian,</HI> who took a voyage to <HI>Surinam,</HI> with the sole view of gratifying a taste for this branch of natural history.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, after all the researches of these in∣genious persons, and the labours of our excellent Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> a defect of system rendered this subject the most difficult to study of any part of na∣tural

<P>The disease here described is defined in the <HI>Ge∣nera Morborum</HI> of our author to be <Q REND="margQuotes">a spastic con∣traction of the limbs or joints, attended with convulsions, and excruciating periodical pains.</Q> The author gives a full description of this disease from the two most capital <HI>Swedish</HI> writers on the subject. He had seen it himself, and observes, that it had frequently been epidemical in that country: moreover, that some physicians had thought it a new distemper. He has however traced it in the writings of a numerous set of au∣thors, from the year 1596 to 1727; by which it appears to have been common to other parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>This dreadful distemper sometimes held the sick for three or four weeks, and those who perished

generally sunk under a diarrhoea, or died in con∣vulsions. <HI>Valerian, Castor, Camphor,</HI> and Antispas∣modics of the like kind, appear to have been the most beneficial remedies.</P>
<P>He next brings together in one view the <HI>hypo∣theses</HI> of the various authors, relating to the cause of this malady, some of whom suppose it owing to a certain constitution of the air, others to viti∣ated grain, Darnel, or the <HI>Secale Cornutum;</HI> which were all rejected as unsatisfactory by Dr. <HI>E.

Our author says, that in <HI>Sweden</HI> it al∣ways commenced in autumn, was frequent only among the lower order of people, and consequent upon eating bread made of the new corn. Hence he sought for its origin in impure admixtures with the grain, and finally his own hypothesis attributes it to the seeds of the <HI>Raphanus Raphanistrum,</HI> (Sp.

<P>There are few who do not require rather to be reminded, than convinced of the many be∣nefits arising from proper exercise. Its signal uses, both as a preservative and restorer of health, are, in this dissertation concisely, but very strikingly delineated.</P>
<P>After some general physiological observations on the effects of exercise, the writer displays its efficacy as a <HI>preservative;</HI> in strengthening the body, procuring the most genial warmth, helping digestion, increasing perspiration, and promoting all the excretions in due time and proportion; in procuring the most refreshing sleep, and, in vale∣tudinary habits particularly, subduing that fruit∣ful source of disease, acidities in the first pas∣sages.</P>
<P>He then enumerates those diseases in which ex∣ercise is to be considered in a <HI>medicinal</HI> view. In hypochondriac cases, habitual debility, languid appetite, obstructions of the viscera, consumptions, asthma, and in various diseases from laxity, its use has been indispensable.</P>
<P>In speaking of the <HI>Hemicrania,</HI> he relates that LINNAEUS himself had been subject to violent pa∣roxysms of that kind, which usually held him 24 hours, with intervals rarely of little more than a week; and that these fits were excited by very slight causes, even such as the drinking only a spoonful of wine: and that after trying ineffectually various

remedies, the professor attributed the restoration of his health to the use of daily morning exercise, after drinking a large draught of pure water.

<P>The distemper here described has been long endemial in <HI>Norway,</HI> and in several parts of <HI>Sweden,</HI> particularly on the eastern coast of the <HI>Bothnian</HI>
<PB N="348" REF="353"/>
Gulph, and in <HI>Finland;</HI> also in the islands of <HI>Oeland</HI> and <HI>Gothland.</HI> So long since as the year 1631, a pest∣house was erected in the parish of <HI>Croneby,</HI> for the reception of the sick of that neighbourhood. Our author defines the <HI>Lepra</HI> from LINNAEUS'S <HI>Genera Morborum,</HI> as "a distemper shewing itself in pustules, throwing off dry scales or scurf; at∣tended with moveable discoloured nodes in the flesh, and <HI>rhagades</HI> or dry fissures on the skin." N<SUP>o</SUP> 272. Whether the distemper he undertakes to give the history of be the same with the <HI>Lepra Arabum</HI> or <HI>Alexandrina,</HI> the <HI>Javanensis,</HI> and the <HI>Americana,</HI> of all which he has given the charac∣ters, he does not absolutely determine, as he inclines to think it a disease various in its appearance. Being a native of <HI>Bothnia,</HI> he had frequent opportunities of inspecting it, and describes it under the follow∣ing appearances in that country.</P>
<P>It shewed itself in <HI>tubercles,</HI> or nodes, fixed in the fleshy parts, in the forehead, cheeks, arms, hands, and thighs; these were indolent, moveable with the finger, and of a livid hue. There were also tubercles of a livid, or sometimes brown∣ish-yellow cast, in the mouth, palate, fauces, and about the root of the tongue; <HI>ulcers</HI> in the nos∣trils; <HI>tumours</HI> or thickenings of the edges of the outer ears; <HI>thick lips; feet</HI> and <HI>hands</HI> enlarged and inflamed. And in some, ulcers, or rather <HI>fissures,</HI> on the skin, creeping, broad, and deep, with cal∣lous edges, bleeding from slight pressure or hand∣ling, but destitute of pain, as were all the <HI>nodes</HI> and <HI>tubercles,</HI> as far as the author ever observed;
<PB N="349" REF="354"/>
but, he says, they were inclined to itch round their bases.</P>
<P>We cannot pursue our author through his en∣quiries into all the hypotheses relating to the cause of this disorder, howsoever ingenious; it must suf∣fice to observe, that he favours the theory of <HI>Exan∣thematic Animalcula,</HI> and, from the frequency of this disorder on the sea-coast, where the inhabitants live much upon fish, and particularly herrings, which abound with the <HI>Gordius Marinus</HI> (Syst. 1075) or Sea Hair-worm, adduces a train of argu∣ments to shew, that this distemper probably origi∣nates from these worms.</P>
<P>In the cure, he descants upon the <HI>viper-broth</HI> of the antients; and remarks, that the famed viper of the East is a different serpent from ours. He next treats on the inefficacy of mercurials as vermifuges, and quotes Dr. <HI>Scopoli</HI> as observing, that no people are more troubled with worms than those that work in the quicksilver-mines of <HI>Car∣niola.</HI> At length, against this obstinate and for∣midable malady, Dr. <HI>Uddman</HI> informs us, that Dr. <HI>Russel</HI>'s method of cure, which consists in giv∣ing large quantities of sea-water, assisted by the other part of the process, to which were joined frictions with warm and acrid oils, had been at∣tended with more success than any other.</P>

<HEAD>133. FUNDAMENTA ENTOMOLOGIAE. <HI>A. J. Bladh.</HI> 1767.</HEAD>
<P>The knowledge of insects may be said to be the last branch of natural history that raised its head; notwithstanding which, it has of late attained a high degree of perfection: nor can it be too much to attribute this to the excellent arrangement of LINNAEUS, under whose auspices it has extended it∣self beyond all other parts of zoology.</P>
<P>The plan of this paper is exactly that of the foregoing, and will amply satisfy those who wish to enter on the study of insects. In his first chap∣ter, Mr. <HI>Bladh</HI> gives a chronological list of 32 writers on the subject, beginning with <HI>Mouffet,</HI> who published in 1634, and ending with <HI>Schaeffer</HI> in 1767.

<HEAD>134. FUNDAMENTA AGROSTOGRAPHIAE. <HI>H. Gahn.</HI> 1767.</HEAD>
<P>M. <HI>Gahn</HI> professes to have undertaken this tract, partly with a view to aid the good designs of those <HI>societies,</HI> which, to the honour of their founders, have been established in several parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> for the advancement of agriculture; with which the subject of this paper is intimately connected.</P>
<P>In this large natural class of plants, called <HI>Gra∣mina,</HI> are comprehended also the <HI>Cerealia</HI> or Grain, and, including all that are hitherto known, do not amount in the System of our author to fewer than 430 species; in that of others to many more. Such a number of plants, so nearly alike in their habit as these, must require numerous subdivi∣sions, and nice distinctions, to discriminate each species. To effect this is the intention of this tract, in which, after some curious preliminary observations, relating to the station and uses that nature seems to have assigned to some particular species, and a list of the common grasses, classed according to their native places, the author pre∣sents us with an historical account of the prin∣cipal writers who have treated separately on this class, exhibiting under each a brief view of their systems of classification. These are <HI>C. Bauhine, Rudbeck, Ray,</HI> and above all, <HI>Scheuchzer,</HI> who with incredible labour has described all the spe∣cies. To these might be added several other writers, who have also illustrated this branch of botany, particularly <HI>Morison</HI> and <HI>Haller.</HI> Then follows the description of the natural character
<PB N="353" REF="358"/>
and habit of a plant of this class, intended to con∣vey a full explanation of the <HI>terms,</HI> referring to two explanatory plates, on which is engraven a flower of each genus.</P>
<P>Various have been the methods invented to class this tribe; our author here gives them a new dis∣position, entirely independent on the sexual system, established on the <HI>figure</HI> and <HI>number</HI> of the valves composing the Glume or <HI>Calix;</HI> and those of the <HI>flower,</HI> classed under two general heads, as they grow either in the form of <HI>Spikes</HI> or <HI>Panicles.</HI></P>
<P>In all <HI>natural classes</HI> the distinctions of the genera depend on minute differences, which require very nice discriminations; the author therefore proceeds to point these out in several instances of this tribe: he has also added the <HI>exceptions</HI> that arise under the several genera in various species, an imperfection that attends all systems. He concludes with a full explanation of his tables, which are better adapted to convey to a learner a true idea of this class, than any that we are yet acquainted with; since <HI>Schreber</HI>'s tables are not adapted to common use in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>Dr. <HI>Ribe</HI> fixes the heat of the human body be∣tween 35 and 37 of the <HI>Celsian</HI> thermometer, and pronounces all <HI>foods</HI> and <HI>drinks</HI> which arise to 40, to be <HI>fervid.</HI> He considers the constant and daily use of hot aliments as an abuse that calls for the strictest animadversion; and shews, by the effects of them on the solids of the human body, their tendency to produce a variety of chronical diseases, which he here specifies. Man is the only animal accustomed to hot foods, and is almost alone affected with carious teeth. Hence he takes occasion to condemn, in a forcible manner, the cus∣tom of drinking hot tea, coffee, and chocolate, and
<PB N="355" REF="360"/>
dissuade his countrymen from the practice of eat∣ing hot bread, boiled rice, puddings, and other like foods, to which perhaps, from the severity of the climate, the <HI>Swedes</HI> are more addicted than some other nations. He does not however con∣clude this part without pointing out those cases where <HI>tepid,</HI> and even <HI>fervid</HI> liquors, are both al∣lowable and beneficial; such are some fevers, seve∣ral of the spasmodic diseases, and those resulting from rigidity of the fibres.</P>
<P>In the second part, the author reprobates the use of <HI>iced creams, jellies,</HI> and <HI>drinks;</HI> and dissuades especially from a sort of food, unknown among us, though frequent in <HI>Sweden:</HI> this is <HI>congealed oysters.</HI> The pernicious quality of these he endea∣vours to prove by several cases.

<HEAD>137. POTUS THEAE. <HI>P. C. Tillaeus.</HI> 1765.</HEAD>
<P>At the time of its publication, this treatise had perhaps the merit of being the most complete his∣tory of this shrub; occasioned by the lucky inci∣dent of its arriving safe in a vegetating state in <HI>Sweden,</HI> through the care and skill of Capt. <HI>Ekeberg,</HI> who is said to be the first that succeeded in the several attempts that had been made to introduce it into <HI>Europe.</HI> LINNAEUS had suggested the put∣ting the seeds into earth just as the ship left <HI>China;</HI>

and the success confirmed the propriety of his method.</P>
<P><HI>Tea</HI> is now known to be the leaves of a plant of the <HI>monogynous</HI> order, belonging to the <HI>polyandrous</HI> class; the flower of which is succeeded by a <HI>tricoc∣cous Capsule.</HI> The writer describes the shrub at large, gives all the synonyms, and mentions those authors who have given figures of it: among these, <HI>Kaempfer</HI>'s is the only exact one. It was long be∣lieved that there was but one species; but the <HI>Green Tea</HI> is now said to be the produce of another, which differs from the <HI>Bohea,</HI> in having nine pe∣tals in the flower, whereas the Bohea hath but six. It is not known to grow spontaneously else∣where than in <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> in which latter kingdom it is cultivated in all the provinces from <HI>Canton</HI> to <HI>Pekin.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tilley</HI> delivers the mode of preparing the leaves, of which we have a diffuse and most exact account by <HI>Kaempfer,</HI> who, having resided two years in <HI>Japan,</HI> was enabled to give the most com∣plete information. The origin of the use of <HI>Tea</HI> in those countries is too remote to be ascertained, and commerce has now extended its use to almost every corner of the globe. The high price of <HI>Tea,</HI> at its first introduction, induced many physicians to think of a substitute; and it is well known that <HI>Simon Pauli</HI> thought the <HI>Myrica Gale,</HI> Sp.

<P>To this part of our author's treatise may be ad∣ded the well-known sophistication of Tea prac∣tised by the smugglers, in some of the southern parts of this kingdom, who have reduced to a regular process the management of the leaves of the <HI>Ash</HI> and <HI>Elder</HI> particularly; which, when pre∣pared, is called <HI>Smouch,</HI> and mixed, as is said, in the proportion of one third, with the ordinary <HI>Teas.</HI> To what an extent the trade in this sophisti∣cated Tea had been carried, to the detriment of the trees, may be imagined, when the reader is informed, that an act of parliament has lately been obtained to prohibit it, under very severe penal∣ties. But to return to our author.</P>
<P>He next considers the sensible qualities of <HI>Tea,</HI> its fragrant odour, and styptic taste; and from its place in the System, botanically considered, with respect to the <HI>natural orders,</HI> he thinks it highly probable, that what <HI>Kaempfer</HI> relates of its <HI>narcotic</HI> quality, when green, is consonant to truth. And, from similar instances, he proves that this quality may readily be thrown off by that degree of heat which the sudden exsiccation of the leaves require.</P>
<P>In discussing the virtues of Tea, he observes, that the <HI>Chinese</HI> recommend the use of it in all lethargic
<PB N="358" REF="363"/>
diseases, but condemn it in ophthalmies, colics, and palsies. From <HI>Kalm,</HI> he tells us, the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>North America</HI> knew not the inconveniences of carious teeth, debilitated stomachs, nor the wo∣men difficult labours, until the introduction of Tea among them. That the physicians at <HI>Ham∣burgh, Amsterdam,</HI> &amp;c. attribute the frequency of the <HI>Leucorrhaea</HI> among the women of condition to their indulgence in this liquor. And further, that <HI>Boerhaave</HI> ascribed to the sipping hot Tea, a schirrosity in the glands of the oesophagus, which he met with on dissection, and which he thought a disease not known to the antients.</P>
<P>The author subjoins some observations on the important and extensive influence of Tea in a mer∣cantile view, and as an article of luxury; and concludes with the history of the introduction of the living plant into <HI>Europe,</HI> as above mentioned, hinting also at the possibility of naturalizing it in other countries.

<P>We are now come to the last, and what our au∣thor thinks the most salubrious, of the three ele∣gant articles of luxury that the moderns have ac∣quired by the discovery of the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Indies.</HI> Chocolate is the produce of an <HI>American</HI> intertro∣pical tree, flowering twice in a year, and singular in producing its fruit from the body or trunk, and not from the branches.

We are presented with three methods of prepar∣ing Chocolate, as practised by the <HI>Indians,</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and by others, as follow: The <HI>Indians,</HI> to one pound of the roasted nuts, put half a pound of sugar, dissolved in rose-water, and half a pound of flour of Mays, or <HI>Indian</HI> corn. The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to six pounds of the nut, add three and an half of sugar, seven pods of vanillas, one pound and an half of flour of <HI>Indian</HI> corn, half a pound of cinna∣mon, six cloves, one drachm of capsicum, and whatsoever is thought requisite of the roucou-nut to improve the colour, together with amber∣grease or musk, to impart an agreeable scent. In <HI>the other,</HI> and more common way, to seventeen pounds of nuts are added ten pounds of sugar, twenty-eight pods of vanillas, one drachm of am∣bergrease, and six ounces of cinnamon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vanillas</HI> are the pods silled with minute seeds, from a parasitical climbing plant, described under the name of <HI>Epidendrum Vanilla,</HI> Sp. Pl. 1347, belonging to the <HI>Gynandrous</HI> class, with the <HI>Orchides,</HI> and like them reputed an aphrodisiac. Spices are added to give pungency, and mitigate the oleaginous quality of the nut.</P>
<P>Having detailed the history of the <HI>nut,</HI> the au∣thor considers Chocolate as an <HI>aliment,</HI> and in a <HI>medicinal</HI> view. He recommends it in <HI>emaciating</HI> diseases, both as aliment and medicine; and next very strenuously in <HI>hypochondriacal</HI> cases, and in confirmation adduces that of Cardinal <HI>Richelieu,</HI> who, he says, was restored to health by living on Chocolate.

<P>The <HI>Arabians</HI> have the credit of inventing the alembic, and the distillation of ardent spirits; which they are said to have used principally, if not at first entirely, as solvents only, to extract the vir∣tues of simples, and exhibit them in the form of tinctures. Our author observes from <HI>Raymond Lilly,</HI> that they were unknown in <HI>Europe</HI> at the commencement of the 14th century; but the dis∣tillation of <HI>spirit from fermented grain</HI> is attributed to <HI>Arnoldus de Villa Nova,</HI> about the year 1315.

<P>Having enumerated the properties of this in∣flammable fluid from <HI>Boerhaave</HI>'s chemistry, and described a method of preparing the grain for dis∣tillation, as practised in <HI>Sweden,</HI> which is different from ours, the author discusses the salutary effects of <HI>Spirits,</HI> medicinally taken, as analeptic, diuretic, cordial, and stomachic; under all which heads, he lays down apposite rules for their use. Diluted with coffee, he recommends brandy as a diuretic in calculous cases. He much prefers it to wine, as a preservative against contagious dysenteries; and asserts, that this was clearly proved among the seamen of the <HI>Swedish</HI> fleet, in the expedition of 1742.

<P>In a foregoing part of these memoirs, a short account was given of LINNAEUS'S <HI>Theory of Physic,</HI> or his <HI>Clavis Medicinae;</HI> in which was observed the distinction that he has made between the <HI>cortical</HI> and <HI>medullary,</HI> or in other words, the <HI>vascular</HI> and <HI>nervous</HI> systems of the human body. The present dissertation is a comment on the first part of the <HI>Clavis,</HI> relating to the diseases of the vascular system. Dr. <HI>Bergman</HI> traces the immediate effects, both upon the solids and fluids, of any excess or defect in the <HI>Air, Nourishment, Motion</HI> and <HI>Rest, Sleep</HI> and <HI>Watch∣ing, Excretions</HI> and <HI>Retentions.</HI> The <HI>Passions,</HI> as be∣ing more immediately connected with the <HI>medullary,</HI> or nervous system, do not belong to his scheme. Having discussed the ill consequences of these errors to the constitution, and remarked the dis∣eases originating from thence, he turns to the con∣sideration of the old canon, "that diseases are cured by their contraries," and, agreeably to the theory of his master, that such as spring from these errors are principally the objects of dietetic medicine, and are to be cured by <HI>Sapids,</HI> he pro∣duces the several classes of <HI>Aquosa, Sicca, Acida, Amara, Pinguia, Styptica, Dulcia, Acria, Mucosa, Salsa,</HI> and shews their power in preventing and curing diseases; concluding his tract with the distinction between the rational and empirical phy∣sician.</P>
<P>In mentioning the scurvy, and the effects of salted meat, he relates a memorable instance of

an arthritic patient, who, after taking, in one summer, 1800 boles of Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s medicine, became in the highest degree afflicted with the genuine scurvy, which he thinks might fairly be attributed to the quantity of alkaline salt contain∣ed in that medicine.</P>

<P>The uses of this class of vegetables in well-cul∣tivated countries, and in benign climates, can be but little known; in the northern regions they are conspicuous. The writer, after having mentioned those botanists who have particularly attended to this class, and given due praise to the matchless work of <HI>Dillenius</HI> on the subject, displays the particular advantages of mosses in the general economy of nature; for instance, the <HI>terrestrial Liverworts</HI> lay the first foundation of soil on barren rocks, as the <HI>Sphagnum,</HI> and many other <HI>bog mosses,</HI> do in marshy and boggy places. In human economy, nothing is more remarkable than the utility of the <HI>rein-deer moss,</HI> in the arctic regions. Many of the liver∣worts are ingredients in dyeing; and several mosses have their place in medicine, among which parti∣cularly may be mentioned the <HI>Lichen Islandicus,</HI> Sp. Pl. 1611. Iceland, or Eryngo-leaved Liver∣wort, of the virtues of which, in consumptions, Dr. <HI>Scopoli</HI> has written a distinct treatise, published in the <HI>Annus</HI> 2<HI><SUP>dus</SUP> Historico-naturalis.</HI> Lips. 1769.</P>

<HEAD>146. MUNDUS INVISIBILIS. <HI>J. C. Roos.</HI> 1767.</HEAD>
<P>The subjects of this thesis have been much agi∣tated of late years by the philosophical <HI>literati,</HI> who have been skilled in the use of microscopes. It turns principally on the discoveries of the Baron <HI>Munkhausen,</HI> relating to the <HI>smut</HI> of wheat and bar∣ley, and to the dust of the <HI>Lycoperda,</HI> or Puff-balls; <HI>Agarics,</HI> and other <HI>Fungi;</HI> which he has asserted to be no other than the <HI>ova</HI> of <HI>animalcula:</HI> from whence had arisen a doubt, whether mushrooms should be ranked with vegetables or animals. LINNAEUS adopted, though with great hesitation, the Baron's opinion, as appears from his <HI>Systema Nat.</HI> p. 1326; but his sentiments on this subject, after the experiments made by our late Mr. <HI>Ellis,</HI> who, at his request, instituted a course professedly to determine this point, do not appear. The re∣sult of Mr. <HI>Ellis</HI>'s enquiry proved the negative, as may be seen by his papers, published in the <HI>Phil. Trans.</HI> vol. lix. p. 138, and <HI>Gent. Magazine</HI> for 1773, p. 316. Much curious matter on this sub∣ject occurs in Mr. <HI>Roos</HI>'s paper; but we conclude with an important fact, related from the Baron's book, who recommends the seed wheat to be washed in a lye made of lime and sea-salt; by which prac∣tice, for twenty years, he had secured his crop from smut, although his neighbours around him had sometimes lost a third part of theirs. In the lat∣ter
<PB N="368" REF="373"/>
part of the thesis, the author descants on <HI>ex∣anthematic animalcula,</HI> and appears to favour that hypothesis; candidly confessing, however, the dif∣ficulties that occur, and concluding with a string of doubts, proposed by way of queries, relating to this abstruse point.</P>

<HEAD>147. USUS HISTORIAE NATURALIS. <HI>M. Aphonin.</HI> 1766.</HEAD>
<P>This ingenious discourse, written by a young <HI>Russian</HI> nobleman, a student at <HI>Upsal,</HI> is one of the most entertaining and best-digested papers on the subject, that this collection affords, and cannot fail to carry conviction with it. It is divided into two parts: in the first, he displays the necessity of a knowledge of natural history at large, in leading the way to improvements in all branches of agriculture, and in gardening: the utility espe∣cially of being acquainted with the indigenous plants of the country, an object greatly neglected, and which, if more attended to, must lead, as he endeavours to shew, to the improvement of woods, hedges, the culture of barren ground, wet mea∣dows; to the extirpation of hurtful plants, and the better adapting pastures to the several kinds of cattle. To illustrate this latter position, he mentions a memorable fact, related by LINNAEUS in the <HI>Iter Scanicum,</HI> of a number of goats which were perishing in an island that abounded with the Reed Bent Grass, <HI>(Agrostis arundinacea)</HI> a plant on which horses feed with avidity, and thrive
<PB N="369" REF="374"/>
greatly. Thus also, on the other hand, goats will riot and fatten on the Meadow Sweet, <HI>(Fili∣pendula Ulmaria),</HI> whilst horses, and horned cattle especially when they are young, will not touch it.</P>
<P>The second part abounds with curious observa∣tions concerning the economy of domesticated ani∣mals; in treating on which he points out both the most nutritive and noxious herbs to each species; descending afterwards to domestic fowls, and the inferior parts of the animal creation, which are more particularly the objects of husbandmen. A plate is added, on which is engraven, together with a rare species of <HI>Henbane,</HI> the <HI>Actaea Cimici∣fuga,</HI> Sp.

<HEAD>149. RARIORA NORWEGIAE. <HI>H. Tonning.</HI> 1768.</HEAD>
<P>The pen of a learned, ingenious, and skilful naturalist is visible in this agreeable specimen of natural history. The writer first traces the origin of the science among the <HI>Danes,</HI> whose monarchs have lately been its celebrated patrons. Among the principal modern writers stands <HI>Gunner,</HI> the late Bishop of <HI>Dronthem,</HI> who, to the highest merit in his sacred profession, also added an exquisite taste for natural history, and a consummate know∣ledge in that science, as his writings fully testify. Neither is Mr. <HI>J. Strom</HI> forgotten, who published, in 1762, a natural history of <HI>Sondmore,</HI> in the diocese
<PB N="371" REF="376"/>
of <HI>Bergen.</HI> After this literary introduction, the principal intention of the writer is to exhibit lists of the more rare subjects of nature, especially such as are not common in <HI>Sweden.</HI> Agreeably to this design, we have a catalogue of the peculiar plants of <HI>Norway,</HI> the alpine, some other rare species, and particularly of the <HI>Fuci,</HI> or Sea Wracks, with which the coast of <HI>Norway</HI> abounds. Also a list, from the <HI>Dronthem Act;, tom.</HI> II. of all the <HI>American</HI> fruits, which are thrown on the <HI>Norway</HI> shore every year, and which have raised much speculation among the curious, to account for their transmis∣sion so particularly to that part of <HI>Europe.</HI> The author asks the solution of this difficulty from the learned; inasmuch as they are sometimes found in no inconsiderable quantity, and so recent as to germinate, upon being properly secured from the climate. These fruits are usually the <HI>Cassia Fistula: Anacardium,</HI> or Cushew Nuts: <HI>Cucurbitae Lagenariae▪</HI> Bottle Gourds: Pods of the <HI>Mimosa Scandens;</HI> Sp. Pl. p. 1501, called <HI>Cocoons</HI> in the <HI>West Indies:</HI> Pods of the <HI>Piscidia Erythrina,</HI> called Dog-wood Tree by <HI>Sloane:</HI> and Coco-nuts.</P>
<P>The author next pursues his catalogue through all the classes of animals, using only the <HI>Linnaean</HI> trivial names, and referring to the <HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> to <HI>Gunner,</HI> and to <HI>Strom.</HI> It may be observed, that the latter writer thinks that what deceived the fishermen, and by their means Bishop <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> under the appearance of a serpent of the extraordinary length described in his <HI>History of Norway,</HI> was no other than a string of sturgeon, which, at the stated time of the year, follow each other in a line in immense
<PB N="372" REF="377"/>
numbers, with only their backs above water; which might suggest the idea of the waving motion of a serpent.</P>
<P>The remaining part of the tract chiefly respects the medicinal plants, and the diseases of the coun∣try. An account of some vegetable productions, which form an article of commerce, being exported in considerable quantities, among which are reck∣oned the Cloud-berry, <HI>(Rubus Chamaemorus,</HI> Sp. Pl. 708), and the <HI>Lichen Islandicus,</HI> mentioned in the account of the <HI>Usus Muscorum,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 145. Then follows a list of medicines easily obtained, or such as are in use among the country people. Among these the good effects of the <HI>Linnaea borealis,</HI> Sp. Pl. 880, in rheumatic disorders, are well known, and much celebrated. He relates, on the authority of the President himself, that two men, who had been confined to their bed for several months by ischiatic pains, were cured in three days by a strong decoction of it. Its operation appears to have been of the sedative kind, since the patients were thrown into a sleep, which lasted sixteen or twenty hours. He confirms the opinion of the <HI>Lepra</HI> arising from the <HI>Hair Worm,</HI> as mentioned in N<SUP>o</SUP> 131 of this collection; and has some obser∣vations relating to the <HI>Colica Lapponum,</HI> described in M. <HI>Montin</HI>'s thesis, N<SUP>o</SUP> 27.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, tending to shew the Utility of botanical Knowledge in Relation to Agriculture, and the feeding of Cattle: accom∣panied with a Translation of LINNAEUS'S <HI>Pan Suecus,</HI> accommodated to the <HI>English</HI> Plants, with references to Authors, and to Figures of the Plants.</HEAD>
<P>THE science of botany certainly holds its most dignified station when subservient to <HI>medicine;</HI> but its utility does not terminate in this alone, though it has too long been considered as having no other connection. This, notwithstand∣ing, is but a partial, nay even an injurious idea of it, for nothing has more retarded its usefulness than this contracted notion. It has a relation, in a variety of ways, to many other arts and sciences. Among which may be mentioned the <HI>art of paint∣ing and dying;</HI> but of all others <HI>Agriculture</HI> cer∣tainly claims the strictest relation, some of its most important branches being greatly dependent upon it, and others, from an happy application of it, being perhaps capable of further emolument. The subsequent paper, it is presumed, will, in some measure, illustrate this truth. But howsoever great the real dignity and importance of this art, yet, it must be allowed, that it has not been cultivated sufficiently on scientific principles, nor advanced in equal proportion with other branches of know∣ledge. It is not many years since Dr. <HI>Home</HI> ob∣served,
<PB N="375" REF="380"/>
that <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Columella,</HI> old as they are, remained almost the only writers worth con∣sulting upon this subject. The writings of Mr. <HI>Hart,</HI> Dr. <HI>A. Hunter,</HI> Lord <HI>Kaims,</HI> Mr. <HI>Young,</HI> and of many others since published in our own nation, we hope have superseded Dr. <HI>Home</HI>'s remark; and, from that laudable spirit now diffusing among us throughout <HI>Great Britain,</HI> for the improvement of <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> under the protection of our pub∣lic institutions, we may expect to see every branch of agriculture studied as it deserves, and attended with that success which commonly results from the right application of knowledge to the pur∣poses of human life. On the continent, the <HI>Swedes</HI> are making large and daily progress in the im∣provement of this branch of <HI>economics.</HI> In <HI>France,</HI> Mr. <HI>Du Hamel</HI> has rendered himself conspicuous by his writings on this subject; and in various parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> societies have been formed with a professed view to this end. We cannot help mentioning, with peculiar pleasure, that of <HI>Padua,</HI> over which Dr. <HI>Arduin</HI> presides, who, by the mu∣nificence of the <HI>Venetian</HI> state, has a garden allotted for the cultivation of such vegetables as they wish to subject to experiments in agriculture, dyeing, and other arts. A noble institution, and worthy of imitation!</P>
<P>Amidst that almost infinite variety of vegetables, with which the beneficent hand of nature has re∣plenished our earth, those which go under the general name of <HI>Grasses</HI> form the principal food of our cattle; next to these, among the <HI>natural classes</HI> of plants, none are more acceptable than the
<PB N="376" REF="381"/>
<HI>diadelphous</HI> or leguminous herbs: of this class is the <HI>Clover,</HI> so much cultivated in <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Saint Foin,</HI> or <HI>Cocks-head;</HI> and the <HI>Lucern,</HI> or Medic∣fodder, in <HI>France.</HI> Besides these, our horses, horned cattle, sheep, &amp;c. will all, in their turn, eat with equal pleasure, and some with more avi∣dity, a great variety of other vegetables. Nume∣rous instances occur where one species of animals will feed greedily upon those herbs which others refuse to touch, and will even almost famish rather than eat. Some plants are highly noxious, and even poisonous, to certain kinds of animals, while they are eaten by others without the least subsequent ill effect: to instance, the <HI>Cicuta Virosa,</HI> or long∣leaved Water Hemlock, the most virulent plant which grows spontaneously in <HI>England,</HI> (but hap∣pily is not common) is fatal to cows, when, through scarcity of food, they are obliged to eat it; yet sheep and horses feed on it with impunity, and goats even greedily devour it.</P>

<L>Barbigeras pecudes, homini quae est acre venenum.</L>
<BIBL>LUCR.</BIBL></Q>
Facts of this kind must, in some measure, have been obvious to the most incurious of mankind, even in the earliest ages. The first race of shep∣herds had daily instances, among their flocks, of the selection and refusal of particular herbs, and subsequent observations must have multiplied and confirmed them. But they were still only known in the general, and no <HI>experiments</HI> had been insti∣tuted to ascertain the <HI>precise species</HI> thus eaten or
<PB N="377" REF="382"/>
rejected. The facts are, at this time, undeniable. It is well known that <HI>Flag-flowers, Hounds-tongue, Henbane, Mullein, Nightshade, Hemlock,</HI> several <HI>Docks, Arsmart, Agrimony, Celandine,</HI> several <HI>Crowfoots, Marsh Marigold, Horehound, Figwort,</HI> many <HI>Thistles, Fern,</HI> and other plants, are commonly neglected by our horses, and horned cattle, and stand un∣touched, even in pastures where it might be ex∣pected that necessity should constrain them to eat any thing. These are but a few out of many in∣stances; there are more than is commonly imagin∣ed, and it was desirable, in consequence of these observations, that a course of experiments should be instituted to elucidate this instinct, in that part especially of the brute creation which is so imme∣diately subservient to mankind. The utility of such experiments must be evident, as they must necessarily lay the foundation of farther improve∣ments in the economy of cattle. The intelligent husbandman would, by this means, have it in his power to rid his pastures of noxious and useless plants, and give room for the salubrious ones.</P>
<P>In this view of the affair, it will be seen that physicians are not the only persons who may study botany to advantage; many others would find, not only a fund of pleasure from this study, but numberless other advantages resulting from the knowledge of the plants of their own country. In the instance before us, science has opened the way, and surely it is not too much to say, that it evi∣dently points to greater improvements, in one of the most important branches of agriculture, as it relates to the economy of cattle. More than this
<PB N="378" REF="383"/>
ought not to be expected from its aid. It is to the intelligent grazier and the gentleman, well versed in the knowledge of the <HI>indigenous</HI> plants, fraught with careful observation, and practised in the eco∣nomy of cattle, that the rest must be owing. No∣thing but the want of this knowledge, in such gentlemen as reside in the country chiefly, can de∣prive us of the benefit which might otherwise ac∣crue from reducing it into practice. The eradi∣cating from pastures poisonous and useless weeds, would be but one, although indeed no mean one, among many other advantages. Further than this, the husbandman would be better enabled to suit his several sorts of cattle to the different pas∣tures in his possession, more to their benefit, and consequently his own. Even in marshy grounds, where it is a difficult undertaking to mend the soil, the growth of many plants might be encouraged, and the seeds of others sown, which are highly acceptable to different kinds of cattle. By degrees too we should undoubtedly be led to the cultivation of other vegetables besides <HI>clover,</HI> as fodder; and the foregoing observations imply, that this might be done in soils and situa∣tions where that would not thrive. Our hay would in consequence be much improved; for al∣though cattle will eat those herbs among hay, which they reject while green and growing, yet it does not follow that all are in their dried state equally nutritive and wholesome. The benefits, in fine, which would arise from a diligent and general pursuit of these hints, would undoubtedly be vari∣ous and extensive, and many more, in all probabi∣lity,
<PB N="379" REF="384"/>
in a course of years, than can at present be thought of.</P>
<P>Agreeably to these ideas, a beginning has been made, under the auspices of our celebrated author, whose attempt was truly laudable, and worthy of himself. To this end, it is indeed certainly the province of the botanist to make the plants of his own country the principal objects of his atten∣tion. This has been eminently the case with LIN∣NAEUS, and his country will continue to reap the fruit of his labours. The result of these experi∣ments may be seen in a paper, called PAN SUECUS, printed in the second volume of the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae,</HI> the substance of which, so far as the experiments were made with plants common to this country, will be exhibited in the subsequent pages.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS conceived the first design of this in∣stitution from observations made in his <HI>Dalekarlian</HI> journey, which has been mentioned in the course of the preceding pages: he observed, that his horses left untouched, among other plants, <HI>Mea∣dow-sweet, Great Wild Valerian, Lilly of the Valley, Angelica, Rose-bay Willow Herb, Marsh Cinquefoil, Mountain Crowfoot Crane's-bill, Globe Crowfoot,</HI> and various shrubs. It was not till several years after, that these experiments were instituted; in which a number of his pupils were engaged; eight or nine of whom he mentions by name, and he had himself a large share in directing and conducting them. More than two thousand experiments were tried upon the <HI>horned cattle, goats, sheep, horses,</HI> and <HI>hogs:</HI> many were repeated ten, and some twenty
<PB N="380" REF="385"/>
times, with the sole view of determining what vegetables these several animals would eat or re∣ject. It is easy to see that numberless difficulties must arise in the prosecution of this scheme, and that imperfection, in a variety of instances, must at last attend their greatest accuracy. In the mean time, care was taken, as far as circumstances would admit, that the experiments were made as unexceptionably as possible; and it must be con∣cluded, that the result upon the whole is true, as they have a real foundation in those unerring laws of instinct, to which nature has subjected the whole brute creation. The plants were all fresh gather∣ed, not bruised in collecting, nor offered to the cattle when they were either almost famished, or glutted with variety; nor yet in the spring-time, when many of them greedily devour almost any vegetable they can get, sometimes such as are fatal to them, and which at other times they will not touch. The plants were also, in many examples, offered to several individuals of the same species.</P>
<P>These trials were made only with the indigenous plants of <HI>Sweden,</HI> which are (at least three fourths) the same as ours in <HI>England.</HI> The plants growing spontaneously in <HI>Sweden,</HI> exclusive of the mosses and funguses, amount to about 900 species. Of such a number, in every country, many must be very rare; it is not therefore to be expected that all these could be brought to trial. Some, although plentiful in one part of the country, would be very sparingly found in another. From the result it appeared, that the <HI>horned cattle</HI> eat of the plants which were offered to them▪ only 276 species, and
<PB N="381" REF="386"/>
that they rejected 218. The <HI>goats,</HI> of 449 kinds, refusing 126. The <HI>sheep,</HI> of 387, refusing 141. The <HI>horses,</HI> of 262 species, refusing 212. And of those which were offered to <HI>swine,</HI> they eat 72 kinds, and refused 171.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Suecus,</HI> it may be presumed, is but in few hands, at least of such whom the subject most concerns. It is written in Latin, and put into the most compendious form imaginable, by inserting only the <HI>trivial</HI> names of the plants, and referring to the number in the <HI>Flora Suecica,</HI> where the sy∣nonyms are given. In this form it is almost use∣less to persons unacquainted with LINNAEUS'S writ∣ings, and from an <HI>English</HI> reader is entirely hid. It appeared of importance enough to be thrown into an <HI>English</HI> dress, to which end it was necessary to give it a form different from the original.</P>
<P>So far as the trials were made with plants which are common to both countries, the result may be seen in the following pages, and they amount to no very inconsiderable number. Being taken <HI>nearly</HI> in the order in which they stood in the original paper, so the sexual system is of course preserved. Yet perhaps a more apt disposition of them might have been given, by arranging them according to their usual places of growth.</P>
<P>In order to render it more generally intelligible and acceptable, the <HI>English</HI> name of the plant is first given, then the <HI>Linnaean</HI> generical and trivial name, by which it may instantly be found, either in LINNAEUS'S own works, or in Mr. <HI>Hud∣son's Flora Anglica.</HI> To these follow three columns. The first contains the reference to the page in Dr.
<PB N="382" REF="387"/>
<HI>Hill</HI>'s <HI>British Herbal,</HI> which it may be presumed is in many hands, and which has now superseded, in a great measure, the <HI>Herbals</HI> of <HI>Gerard</HI> and <HI>Perkinson,</HI> being better accommodated to the purposes of bo∣tanic intelligence, and furnished also with figures. The second column refers to the page in RAY'S <HI>Synopsis of British Plants,</HI> where the synonyms of the two <HI>Bauhines,</HI> and those of <HI>Gerard</HI> and <HI>Parkinson,</HI> are quoted. By this means the reader is very compendiously directed to a variety of authors on each plant. For the sake of those who wish to see an accurate figure, a reference to the <HI>Flora Danica</HI> is added, a work coming out at the expence of the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and intended to contain all the indigenous plants of that kingdom, of which 840 plates are already done. Of these above 500 are natives of this kingdom, on which account it supplies, so far, the want of a work of the same kind here. It must, however, be observed, that in this column, under the <HI>Grasses,</HI> those excellent tables in <HI>Morison</HI>'s <HI>Historia</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On this head it is much to be regretted, that these tables are not republished separately, with the history of the <HI>Grasses</HI> and <HI>Grain</HI> annexed; a work which, if executed by a proper hand, could not but be acceptable to all lovers of rural economy. This view might be rendered still more complete, by extending it to <HI>all</HI> those plants which are par∣ticularly the objects of this paper.</NOTE><HI>Plantarum Oxoniensis</HI> are referred to. The columns on the other page contain the result of the experiments, for brevity's sake expressed as in the original, by nu∣merical characters, which it will be necessary to illustrate. There is a column retained for every
<PB N="383" REF="388"/>
species of animals with which the experiments were made in <HI>Sweden;</HI> for, although <HI>goats</HI> are not so commonly kept with us, as in that country, yet it will at least be matter of entertainment, if not of utility, to see what choice of vegetables they will make.</P>
<P>When this figure (1) is made use of, it denotes that the plant is eaten by that animal to which the column is appropriated; <HI>(O.)</HI> horned cattle or <HI>Oxen; (G.) Goats; (Sh.) Sheep; (H.) Horses; (S.) Swine.</HI> Two units, thus (11) denote that the ani∣mal is very fond of the plant. When the cypher (0) occurs, we are to understand that the plant is rejected by that animal. When both are found together in a column, thus (10), or (01), they denote that it was sometimes eaten and sometimes rejected: the former is supposed to signify, that it was generally eaten, but sometimes refused; the latter, the reverse. Where no figure occurs, it is to be understood that no opportunity had been taken of making a trial of that plant upon those animals. The native place of each plant is added, and the month in which it flowers, in as compen∣dious a manner as possible, as this seemed to be a requisite addition; also its duration, whether an∣nual <HI>(A.),</HI> biennial <HI>(B.),</HI> or perennial <HI>(P.).</HI> To the whole are collected and subjoined, from the last edition of the <HI>Flora Suecica,</HI> the <HI>Flora Oeconomica,</HI> RAY'S <HI>Historia Plantarum,</HI> HALLER'S <HI>Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiae,</HI> and others, a few notes, point∣ing out particularly the noxious plants, or directing the reader's observation to any other article that seemed worthy of regard.</P>

<P><HI>Diadelphous Plants.</HI> A general view of this class shews at once how very acceptable they are to almost all cattle. Cows and sheep refused none, and horses not more than three out of the whole number with which they were tried. They afford the richest food for cattle, and are cultivated in divers parts of <HI>Europe</HI> with all possible attention. With us the <HI>Com∣mon Purple Tref il,</HI> or Clover, is mostly sown. Lately some trials have been made with the <HI>Saint Foin,</HI> 339, and some have thought it answers better than Clover. I say nothing of the exotic <HI>Lucern.</HI></P>
<P>Among these Plants, the <HI>Kidney Vetch,</HI> 327, is particularly acceptable to sheep, insomuch that separate cultivation of it has been recommended; but it will not succeed well except on chalky grounds.</P></NOTE></CELL>
