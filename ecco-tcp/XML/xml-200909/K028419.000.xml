<P>THE KING in the COUNTRY.</P>
<P>A DRAMATIC PIECE, In TWO ACTS.</P>
<P>Acted at the THEATRES-ROYAL, At RICHMOND and WINDSOR, 1788.</P>
<P>LONDON, Printed for the EDITOR, and Sold at No. 62, <HI>Great Wild-Street,</HI> near <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields;</HI> by Mess. EGERTON, <HI>Whitehall;</HI> Mess. COX and PHILLIPSON, <HI>James-Street, Covent-Garden;</HI> R. RYAN, No. 351, <HI>Oxford-Street;</HI> H. D. SYMONDS, No. 20. <HI>Pater-Noster-Row;</HI> and W. RICHARDSON, under the <HI>Royal-Exchange.</HI> 1789.</P>
<P><HI>[Entered at Stationers-Hall.]</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="note">
<PB REF="2"/>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The following Piece is taken from an underplot in The First Part of King Edward the Fourth, written by Thomas Heywood; the dialogue has been altered a little, to render it fit for modern representation; and a few passages have been added for connexion and conclusion.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="note">
<PB REF="3"/>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The Dramatic Piece of <HI>"The King in the Country,"</HI> was compiled and performed last summer, imme∣diately on <HI>His Majesty's</HI> return from Cheltenham; when Entertainments of various kinds were exhi∣bited at the different Places of Public Amusement, having relation to the Royal Excursion. The Ca∣lamity which, to the grief of every good mind, has since befallen <HI>Our Beloved Sovereign,</HI> does not, it is pre∣sumed, render the publication of this Drama im∣proper; had the Editor thought it so, it would cer∣tainly have been withheld: for, having been honoured with <HI>The Royal Authority</HI> to superintend Theatrical Entertainments these ten years past (during which period it has been necessary for him to adapt pieces of a local, or temporary nature, to Provincial Theatres), no one can entertain a more proper sense of duty, respect, loyalty, and affection, to <HI>Our most gracious King,</HI> whom God preserve and restore!</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YOU lately read in each news-paper,</L>
<L>At morn, at noon, by evening-taper,</L>
<L>Of Cheltenham-water, wooden-house,</L>
<L>Now left to prowling rat or mouse;</L>
<L>With smart bon-mots, and anecdotes</L>
<L>Of Prince and Peasant, Crowns and Cotes;</L>
<L>And how, surprised, the rustics ran</L>
<L>To see the King was but a man;</L>
<L>Wond'ring that blue-coat and bob-wig</L>
<L>Were worn by one they thought so big,</L>
<L>Great Gog or Magog's coat of mail</L>
<L>To cover him would surely fail:</L>
<L>How stars and garters clowns did scare,</L>
<L>And make them at a distance stare;</L>
<L>With Mayors, most loyally addressing,</L>
<L>To beg of Majesty the blessing</L>
<L>Of one short visit to their city,</L>
<L>Which they, no doubt, had trimm'd up pretty:</L>
<L>With
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This anomalous expression is not without a precedent; <HI>Man</HI> Mid-<HI>Wife,</HI> so generally used, being authority for it.</NOTE> <HI>female</HI> bell-<HI>man,</HI> squeaking out</L>
<L>"God save the King!" while rustics shout;</L>
<L>And gracious <HI>GEORGE,</HI> by chance being nigh her,</L>
<L>Most courteous adds, "God bless the cryer!"</L>
<L>These, and a thousand such-like matters,</L>
<L>By news-papers now worn to tatters,</L>
<L>May prove a theme for some Stage-Writer,</L>
<L>Some Laureat-Bard, or Song-Enditer.</L>
<L>Tho' choice the subject, yet, thro' fear</L>
<L>We might debase it, were it here</L>
<L>Attempted to be dramatized,</L>
<L>It being so far oversized</L>
<L>For our weak talents; we, instead,</L>
<L>Evoke the Spirits of the Dead!</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>And crave you to accept a Story</L>
<L>Of our Fourth <HI>EDWARD,</HI> England's glory!</L>
<L>And a blunt Tanner; long since writ</L>
<L>By Thomas Heywood, a Stage-Wit:</L>
<L>Antique the phrase, and coarse the manners,</L>
<L>Yet such as suited Kings and Tanners</L>
<L>Who lived three hundred years ago,</L>
<L>When few could to a goose say Bo!</L>
<L>And needy Kings would beg or borrow</L>
<L>What their poor subjects' toil and sorrow</L>
<L>Had scraped together: happier now!</L>
<L>We under no such bondage bow;</L>
<L>Nor King demands, nor subjects grieve,</L>
<L>Beneath our vines content we live!</L>
<L>And read with wonder of those times,</L>
<L>The simple theme of this night's Mimes.</L>
<L>If it afford some harmless mirth,</L>
<L>Nor shew of humour quite a dearth;</L>
<L>Kindly o'erlook whate'er's amiss,</L>
<L>Nor pay our labours with a hiss:</L>
<L>And should it please you to commend,</L>
<L>We shall atchieve our wish'd-for end;</L>
<L>For every thought, deed, and endeavour,</L>
<L>Is bent to gain that Prize, your Favour!</L>

<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Dudgeon.]</STAGE> And yet, heaven help us, it is a crooked world, and an unthrifty; for some that have ne'er a shoe had rather go barefoot, than buy clout-leather to mend the old, when they can get no new; well, heaven mend <HI>them,</HI> tho' they will not mend their <HI>shoes.</HI> Let me see by my executor here, my leather pouch, what I have taken, what I have spent, what I have gained, what I have lost, and what I have laid out: My taking is more than my spending, for here's store left. I have spent but a groat, a penny for my two jades, a penny to the poor, a penny pot of ale, and a penny cake, for my man and me.—A dicker of cow-hides cost me —'snails, who comes here?

<P>That's a dog's death, I'll not meddle with it. But by my troth I know not when I do speak treason, and when I don't; there's such halting betwixt two Kings, that a man cannot go upright but he shall offend one of them: I would heaven had them both for me.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Mr. Urban, I should be obliged to any of your topographical friends, to inform me, why so many towns in North Wiltshire have the addition of <HI>Basset</HI> to their names, as <HI>Wotton Basset, Compton Basset, Berwick Basset,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.? Every singularity of the kind should be traced to its source; as it frequently produces exemplifications of an∣cient customs, or leads imperceptibly to discussions of antiquity, that seldom fail of rewarding us with some knowledge, that was before lost to all but the incurious tenant of the soil. H. <BIBL><HI>Gentleman's Magazine,</HI> 1788, Part 2, Page 885.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>The several towns in North Wiltshire which have the addition of <HI>Basset</HI> to their names, derive it from their owner <HI>Philip Basset,</HI> who had considerable property in the county, and was a younger branch of the Bassets of Edendon there. See Dugdale's Bar. l. 383, 385. P.P. <BIBL><HI>Idem,</HI> P. 973.</BIBL></Q></NOTE></P>

<P>God make him an honest man, I hope that's well spoken; for, by the mouse-foot, some give him hard words; whether he 'zerves um or not, let him look to that; I'll med∣dle o'my cow-hides, and let the world wag.

<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>A devout man; and what's King Edward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's a frank franion, a merry companion, and loves a wench well; they say he has married a poor widow because she is fair.</P>

<P>Dost thou like him the worse for that?</P>

<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, by my feckens, but the better; for though I be but a plain Tanner, I love a fair lass myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, tell me, how love they King Edward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, as poor folks love holidays.—Glad to have them now and then, but to have them come too often would undo them; so to see the King now and then is a comfort, but to behold him every day would beggar us; and I may say to thee, under the rose, we fear we shall be troubled to lend him money, for we doubt he's but needy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would'st thou not lend him money if he should need it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, by my holydame! he shall have half my purse, and I'll sell sole-leather to help him to more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>In faith now, which lov'st thou best, Harry or Edward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that's a secret! and two may keep it, if one be away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I say my conscience? I think Harry is the true King.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Art advised of that? Harry's of the old house of Lancaster, and that progenity do I love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then dost thou hate the House of York?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, no; for I am just a-kin to Sutton wind-mill; I can grind which way soe'er the wind blow: If it be Harry, I can say well fare Lancaster! if it be Edward, I can sing, York, York for my money!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art of my mind, for I say Harry is the lawful King; Edward is but a usurper; fool and a coward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, there thou lyest! he has wit enough, and courage enough; dost thou not speak treason?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; but I know to whom I speak it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dost thou? an I were constable, I should be for∣sworn if I set thee not in the stocks for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let it go no further; for I did serve King Harry, and I love him best; though now I serve King Edward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art the arranter knave to speak ill of thy master. But, sirrah, what's thy name? what office hast thou? and what will the King do for thee?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>My name is Ned; I am the King's butler, and he will do more for me than for any nobleman in the court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>The devil he will! the more fool he, and so I'll tell him if e'er I see him; and I would I might see him in my poor house at Tamworth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go with me to the court, and I'll bring thee to the King; and what suit soever thou have to him, I'll warrant thee to speed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ha' nothing to do at court; I'll home with my cow-hides; but if the King will come to me, he shall be welcome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hast thou no suit touching thy trade? to transport hides, or have the sole selling of leather within a certain circuit; or about bark, or such like, to have letters patent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the mass, I like not those patents! for, I think it's pity that only one subject should have, what might do good to many throughout the land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say'st thou me so, Tanner? well, let's cast lots, whether thou shalt go with me to Drayton, or I go home with thee to Tamworth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lot me no lotting! I'll not go with thee; if thou wilt go with me, 'cause thou'rt my Liege's man (and yet I think he has many honester) thou shalt be welcome to John Hobbs: thou shalt be welcome to beef and bacon; and per∣haps a bag-pudding: and my daughter Nell shall make a posset for thee ere thou goest to bed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's my hand.—I'll but go and see the King served, and be at home as soon as thyself; ay, and, with thy leave and her's, kiss thy fair daughter too.</P>

<P>What would you have of me? money I have none, and I'll sell no stock; here's old polling!—subsidy, soldiers, and to the poor! and you might have your will, you'd soon shut me out of doors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, by my holydame, neighbour Grudgen, thou'rt but a grumbling, grudging churl! thou hast two ploughs going, and ne'er a cradle rocking, with many a peck of money; and wilt not spare a few pounds to the King.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry come up, goodman Tanner, are you so tart? your prolicateness has brought your son to the gallows almost; you can be frank of another man's cost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou'rt no good man to twit me with my son; he may outlive thee yet: my son's in jail;—is he the first ho∣nest man's son that hath been there? and thou wert a man as thou'rt but a beast, I would have thee by the ears.</P>

<L>Now, frolick Tanner, what wilt thou afford?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Twenty old angels, and a score of hides; if that be too little, take twenty nobles more: while I have it my King shall never want.</P>
</SP>

<P>The King shall know thy loving, liberal heart.</P>

<P>Lord, how does the King? and how does Ned, the King's butler? and Tom of his chamber? I am sure ye know them.</P>

<P>I do, and they are well,</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>I know they were.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>They promised me a good turn for kissing my daughter, Nell; and now I ha' cagion to try them; my son's in Caperdochia, as they call it, in Newgate jail; for peeping into another man's purse: and outcept the King be miser∣able, he's like to totter for lack of ground to stand on! can that same Ned, the butler, do any thing with the King?</P>
</SP>

<P>Come to the court; I warrant thy son's life; Ned will save that, and do thee greater good.</P>
