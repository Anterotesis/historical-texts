<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Piece is founded on the Isola Disabitata of the celebrated ABBE METASTASIO: In reading the Perform∣ance of that great Genius, the present Writer received so exquisite a Pleasure, that he contracted a Passion for the Subject, and could not refrain from exercising his Pen upon it. In the Prose∣cution of his Plan, he knew enough of the mo∣dern Theatre, to perceive that it was thin of what our Play-followers call Business; and he was aware that on the Stage it might prove (to use <HI>Milton</HI>'s Words) <HI>very different from what among us passes for Best.</HI> The same Remark was made by a Friend of the Author's, who thought it hazardous to offer to a popular Assembly a Piece, in which there were none of those Strokes that generally succeed with the Multitude. "Can't you," said he, <Q>throw in something here and there to season it more to the public Appetite?—Suppose you were to change the Title, and fix the Scene among the <HI>Anthropophagi,</HI> or among the <HI>Men, whose Heads do grow beneath their Shoulders</HI>—a few of those extraordinary Personages exhibited on the Stage, will prove very acceptable:—What think you of an <HI>Irish</HI> Servant in it?—That certainly will insure Success, the more especially if you add some aerial Beings, and conclude the Whole with a drunken Song by the Tars of <HI>Old Eng∣land.</HI></Q>—The Author was sensible of the Force of these Observations; but the GREAT MILTON (mentioned above) stared him in the Face, with his Reflections on <Q>the Error of introducing tri∣vial and vulgar Persons, which, by all Judicious, hath been counted absurd, and brought in with∣out Discretion, CORRUPTLY to gratify the Peo∣ple.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide,</HI> Preface to <HI>Samson Agonistes.</HI></NOTE>—He therefore determined to preserve the
<PB REF="4"/>
Integrity of his original Design, and to try what would be the Effect of a simple Fable, with, but few Incidents, supported entirely by the Spirit of Poetry, Sentiment, and Passion. To combine these there Qualities is indeed an arduous Task; and the Author, therefore, does not flatter himself that he has entirely succeeded in so difficult an Attempt.</P>
<P>In Justice to METASTASIO, he thinks proper to inform the mere <HI>English</HI> Reader, that he hath not been a Translator on this Occasion, but has fol∣lowed the Impulse of his own Imagination, ex∣cepting in a few Passages. The ITALIAN POET gave the Fable; the present Writer made his own Use of it; or in other Words, the Ground-work, or <HI>Canevas,</HI> (as the <HI>French</HI> call it) is METASTASIO'S; for the Colouring Mr. <HI>Murphy</HI> is answerable.</P>
<P>He could not but be surprized to find that, on the first Night, the Scene in the third Act, between <HI>Sylvia</HI> and <HI>Henrico,</HI> was deemed equivocal. There is always a sufficient Number ready to ascribe to an Author various Meanings, which he never had, "and see at Cannon's what was never there."—To these Gentlemen he returns his Thanks; but the Species of Wit, which they are willing to allow him, he begs leave publickly to disclaim. The Cha∣racter of a Girl, who has never seen a Man, and who has been taught to think of such a Being with Horror, is merely imaginary; but the possible, or Poetical Existence of such a Girl being once esta∣blished, it is to be wished that the Critics would agree what Questions it is natural for her to ask on her first Interview with a Man, METASTASIO makes her say,</P>
<Q><L>Che vuoi da me?</L>
<L>Un Uom Sei dunque!</L>
<L>Andiamo Insieme.</L>
<L>Ah! troppo ron trattenerli, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB REF="5"/>And these little Touches, (so differently do we judge in <HI>England</HI>) were thought abroad to be deli∣cate Strokes of the most elegant Simplicity.</P>
<P>He could wish it had been universally under∣stood that it was not a TRAGEDY he offered to the Public, but a DRAMATIC POEM; that is to say, a Piece with some interesting Situations to engage the Affections, but which affords more Room for a Picturesque Imagination to display itself, than is generally allowed to the more important Concerns of real Tragedy, where the Distress should be al∣ways encreasing, where the Passions should be al∣ways rising to fuller and stronger Emotions, and where of Course the Poet ought not to find Lei∣sure for Imagery and Description. Had this been felt and acknowledged, no Body would have looked for another Kind of Entertainment than was pro∣mised, and the Smiles arising from SYLVIA'S Dread of a Man (on the first Discovery of him), and her gradual Attachment to him in Compliance with natural Instinct, would never have been judged inconsistent with the Colour of the Whole. But if the Author of the <HI>Desert Island</HI> has erred in this, he has the Consolation of having erred with the greatest Poet now in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>As many of the malevolent Writers of the Age have heretofore honoured the Author with their Abuse, and as he was apprehensive that they still remained under the Oppression of their Dullness and Obscurity, it was deemed proper to call them forth into Daylight, by exhibiting one general Representative of them all on the Stage. For this he returns his Thanks to the Author of the Prologue; and if any needy Booksellers, or un∣happy Authors, can find their Account in taking further Liberties with him, he hereby declares, he should be sorry not to have Merit enough to pro∣voke some of them, and for their Encouragement,
<PB REF="6"/>
he adds in the Words of the noble Author of the <HI>Characteristics,</HI> that <Q>He will never reply, un∣less he should hear of them or their Works in any good Company a Twelve-month after.</Q></P>
