<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TIS a very great Plea∣sure to me, in an Age where Vice is looked
on as a Kind of fashionable Accom∣plishment, to hear of one young
Gentleman, who is not ashamed of being singularly good; who has a Tear for
Pity, and a Hand open as Day for melting Charity, without any sinister
Views; and who has happily united the Fine Gentleman to the Good
Christian.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>These, Sir, are unfading Honours! these shall
embalm and sanctify your Name on Earth; and, when this transient Scene is
past, be a sweet and acceptable Sacrifice to God.</P>
<P>That your Virtues may long adorn and bless this World, and
receive a full and glorious Re∣compence in the next, is the ardent Prayer
of,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your most obliged, and most obedient Servant, L.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is usual with all Au∣thors to write Prefaces, either to beg
the Ap∣plause of the Public, or else, 
<Q> 
<L>By Way of filling,</L> 
<L>To raise their Volume's Price a Shilling.</L></Q> As a
most eminent Poet is said to have done.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>I own, if the Merit of any Writer is to be
judged by the Number of Sheets they have written, I have very little Pretence
to Favour: But as 
<Q> 
<L>Multum in Parvo,</L></Q> is an Expression of an ancient
Poet, I hope my Readers will excuse me, as I would rather have them rise
from Table with an Appetite, than glut them; a Rule of Temperance equally
conducive to the Health of our Minds as of our Bodies.</P>
<P>I once had the Misfortune of wri∣ting for a Printer, who never
exa∣mined the Merit of the Work, but used to measure it, and tell me, it
would not do at all, except I could send him half a Dozen Yards more of the
same Stuff: And, as Dr. <HI>Young</HI> remarks, on large Folios, well gilt
and bound, <PB N="vii" REF="6"/> very proper to adorn a Library, whe∣ther the
Owner of it can read or write, or not: 
<Q> 
<L>So <HI>Tonson,</HI> turn'd Upholsterer, sends home</L> 
<L>The gilded Leather to adorn the Room.</L></Q></P>
<P>If I am obliged to send my Work in a blue Paper Covering, let
them look on the Inside, which, I flatter myself, will at least amuse
them.</P>
<P>As I wrote these Memoirs in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> the describing

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF Mrs. <HI>PILKINGTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALTHO' it has been the com∣mon Practice, with Writers of Memoirs,
to fill their Volumes with their own Praises, which, whatever Pleasure they
may have afforded to the Authors, by indulging their Vanity, are seldom found
to give any to the Readers; I am determined to quit this beaten Track; and by a
strict Adherence to Truth, please even my greatest Enemies, by
presenting them with a lively Picture of all my <HI>Faults,</HI> 
<PB N="2" REF="9"/> my <HI>Follies,</HI> and the <HI>Misfortunes,</HI> which
have been consequential to them.</P>
<P>And I am the more inclined to proceed, in that I think the Story
may be instruc∣tive to the <HI>Female</HI> Part of my Readers, to teach them
that <HI>Reputation</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>Is the immediate Jewel of their Souls,</L> 
<L>And that the Loss of it</L> 
<L>Will make them poor indeed!</L><BIBL>Othello.</BIBL></Q> So
that I propose myself, not as an Ex∣ample, but a Warning to them; that by
my Fall, they may stand the more secure.</P>
<P>However numerous my Mistakes in Life have been, they have
still had most surprizing Additions made to them, not only by base and
unworthy Minds, Wretches devoid of Truth and common Honesty, but also by
Persons of high Rank, and such as outwardly profess Christianity; who
have fancied it an Act of Piety to be∣lieve and spread of me the most
impro∣bable and notorious Falshoods! nay, so far has their persecuting
Zeal been carried, that they have rendered my honest Industry in∣effectual;
<PB N="3" REF="10"/> and by depriving me of any Means to support Life,
endeavoured to make me even such a one, as they repre∣sented me to be: That
Clergymen, and Ladies of Honour, should unite, in driving to Extremity, a
Person, who never yet, either in her Conversation, or Writing, of∣fended
against the Laws of Decency or Hu∣manity, is but too apt to make one think,
they had quite forgotten the Christian Grace, <HI>Charity,</HI> without which
we are told, all other Virtues are of no Avail, and con∣sequently, fall far
short of Perfection them∣selves.</P>
<P>I therefore hope those who have taken such unbounded Liberties
with my Charac∣ter, will also allow me to paint out theirs, only with this
Difference, that I shall con∣fine myself to Truth, a Favour I never yet
received at their Hands; since even the priestly Robe, and Mitred Head,
have, with Regard to me, disclaimed it, of which, in the Series of these
melancholy Adven∣tures, I shall be able to produce many sur∣prizing
Instances.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11"/>I was born in the Year 1712; by my Mother's
Side descended of an antient and honourable Family, who were frequent∣ly
intermarried with the Nobility. My Great Grandfather was Earl of
<HI>Killmallock,</HI> whose Daughter married Colonel <HI>Meade,</HI> by whom
he had twenty-one Children, twelve of whom lived to be married. This Gentleman,
to his Honour be it spoken, tho' he was a Man of Fortune, and in the Army,
declared on his Death-bed, 
<Q REND="inline">'That he never had, either when a Batche∣lor, or a
married Man, criminal Conver∣sation with a Woman; never was drunk; never
broke his Word; nor ever used Tobacco.'</Q></P>
<P>The late Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> when Lord Lieutenant of
<HI>Ireland,</HI> dining at Colonel <HI>Meade</HI>'s, offered to confer on him
the Ho∣nour of Knighthood; but he then being in an advanced Age, declined it
for himself, telling his Grace, 
<Q REND="inline">'As he was going out of the World, and his
eldest Son coming into it, he would chuse, if he thought pro∣per, his Grace
should bestow it on him:'</Q> Which accordingly he did.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12"/>This Gentleman, Sir <HI>John Meade,</HI> was
bred to the Law, and deservedly distin∣guished, as one of the finest
Orators that ever spoke at the Bar: He was a perfect Master of
classical Learning; and a Lover and Judge of the muse-like Arts; his
pa∣ternal Estate was about Fifteen Hundred Pounds a Year, which was augmented
by marrying successively two great Heiresses; as well as by the
vast Business he had in his Profession: So that with all those
Advan∣tages of Nature, Education, and Fortune, it was no Wonder he should
meet with universal Respect and Esteem.</P>
<P>He was in this Situation, when Sir <HI>Ed∣ward Seymor</HI> had an
Estate of five Thousand Pounds a Year left to him in <HI>Ireland</HI>; this
was a Matter too considerable for Sir <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> to hope immediately to
possess with∣out Law-suit or Difficulty; so that he found his
personal Appearance absolutely necessary. It is to be observed, that
Sir <HI>Edward Seymor</HI> was accounted the proudest Man in
<HI>England</HI>; and Sir <HI>John Meade</HI> was as remarkable for the same
Fault; neither indeed did I ever meet with any Person of <PB N="6" REF="13"/>
either of those Names in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> who was not
abundantly stocked with it, tho' without the same Pretensions to
support it.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward Seymor</HI> landed at <HI>Dublin,</HI> filled with
that natural Contempt for the whole Country, which those of the
<HI>English,</HI> who have not been resident amongst them, are but too
apt to express on every Occa∣sion: He there found some of his own
Countrymen in Places of Profit and Trust, of whom he enquired, 
<Q REND="inline">'Whether there are any such Things as good
Lawyers to be met with in this damned Place?'</Q></P>
<P>They answered, 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, very good; but if he hoped to carry his
Cause, he must see Sir <HI>John Meade:</HI> Well, said he, let one of
my Footmen go for him.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Your Footman, Sir <HI>Edward!</HI> said one of
the Gentlemen, who knew Sir <HI>John:</HI> Why, 'tis odds if he will speak to
You. I assure you, if he does, 'tis a Favour few of his Clients obtain from
him.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What, <HI>a Duce,</HI> return'd he, do
<HI>Irish</HI> Lawyers take such State upon them?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are to consider, Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> he is
a Gentle∣man <PB N="7" REF="14"/> of Family, has a noble Fortune, and is so
eminent in his Profession, that should he be employed against you, you
may bid Farewel to your Claim.'</Q></P>
<P>This last Argument had such Force with Sir <HI>Edward
Seymor,</HI> that he condescended to wait on Sir <HI>John Meade</HI> next
Morning: Sir <HI>John</HI> had been apprized of what the other had said; and
resolving to be as state∣ly as himself, sent him down Word, 
<Q REND="inline">'He was very busy, but if he pleased to wait
till he was at Leisure, he would see him.'</Q> So Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was
shewn into a Parlour, where he remained above an Hour, fretting himself to
Death, at this disrespectful Usage offered to a Person of his
Dignity.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>John</HI> thought he had pretty sufficiently
mortified him, he sent to let him know, he should be glad to see him, and
received him with a Politeness natural to him; but when Sir <HI>Edward</HI>
went to open his Case to him, he told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'He must leave him his Brief, for he could not
spare Time to hear him:'</Q> So Sir <HI>Edward</HI> laid down his Brief, with
a large Purse of Gold on it; and, having got his Audience <PB N="8" REF="15"/>
of Leave, departed, full of Indignation at meeting with a Man as proud as
himself.</P>
<P>When the Day appointed for the impor∣tant Trial was come, there
were Numbers of Lawyers engaged on either Side of the Question: Sir
<HI>John</HI> being, I suppose, re∣solved to try his Client's Patience to
the uttermost, permitted every one of them to speak before him, without
Interruption, and sat drawing Birds with a Pencil, till Sir <HI>Edward</HI>
was ready to burst with Rage at him, especially as he found the Cause
likely to go against him: At length, when their Pleadings were ended, and
Judgment going to be pronounced against Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> Sir <HI>John
Meade</HI> arose, and desired to be heard, which he ever was with Favour
and Attention by the Court, when making a Speech, which took an Hour and a half
in Time, he so fully confuted all Sir <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>'s Antagonists, and
made his Title to the Estate so evident, and with such power∣ful
Eloquence, that he had a Decree to be put in immediate Possession.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was so charmed with Sir <HI>John</HI>'s
graceful Elocution, that he could <PB N="9" REF="16"/> not forbear several
Times crying out in Extacy, <HI>An Angel! by Heaven, an Angel!</HI> But when he
found the happy Effects of it so much to his own Advantage, he could no
longer contain himself, but cathing Sir <HI>John</HI> in his Arms, <HI>My
dear, dear Friend!</HI> says he, permit me to have the Honour of calling you
so: I do not wonder you should be proud, who have more Cause to be so,
than any Man living.</P>
<P>The Court not breaking up, till it was late, Sir <HI>Edward</HI>
pressed Sir <HI>John</HI> to give him his Company that Evening; Sir
<HI>John</HI> excused himself, telling him, 
<Q REND="inline">'He was every Night engaged to a Club:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, then, said Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> if you
will give me Leave, I will accompany you; (pro∣vided you think it will be
agreeable to your Friends?)'</Q> Sir <HI>John</HI> answered, 
<Q REND="inline">'They would all, he was sure, esteem it as a
very great Honour.'</Q> So according∣ly Sir <HI>Edward</HI> met them, and they
were mutually delighted with each other's Con∣versation, we may presume, by
their stay∣ing together till Four the next Morning. Some of Sir
<HI>Edward</HI>'s Friends finding him <PB N="10" REF="17"/> in Bed at Twelve
o'Clock the ensuing Day, he told them, 
<Q REND="inline">'He had sat up all Night:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'With whom, Sir <HI>Edward?</HI>'</Q> Why,
returned he, 
<Q REND="inline">'With <HI>Homer, Plato, Socrates, Cicero,</HI> and
all the antient <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Poets, Philosophers and
His∣torians.'</Q></P>
<P>From this Time, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> and Sir <HI>John</HI>
contracted a Friendship, which did not terminate, but with their Lives.</P>
<P>As this little Piece of History redounds to the mutual Honour of
both these great and eminent Gentlemen; I hope it will not be accounted
Vanity in me to recite it.</P>
<P>One of Sir <HI>John Meade</HI>'s Sisters, being smitten with
the good Mien of a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Officer in King <HI>James</HI>'s
Army, stole a Match with him, of which my Mo∣ther was the First-fruits; but
her Mother dying in Childbed of her second Child, and King <HI>William</HI>
entirely subduing <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> my Grandfather thought proper to follow
his Royal Master's Fortune to <HI>France,</HI> leaving my Mother, then an
In∣fant, to the wide World: However, Pro∣vidence did not abandon the helpless
Or∣phan; <PB N="11" REF="18"/> her Grandmother, the Widow of Colonel
<HI>Meade</HI> before-mentioned, took her Home to her; and while she lived,
with true maternal Tenderness, bestowed on her the best and politest
Education: And when the Trustees sat in <HI>Ireland,</HI> it being proved
she was bred a Protestant, she recovered her Mother's Fortune, which had
been settled on her, and which she had been some Years kept out of, on
Account of her Father's being a forfeiting Person.</P>
<P>He, in the mean time, returned privately to <HI>England,</HI> and
married a Niece of the celebrated Jesuit Father <HI>Hugh Peters</HI>: by this
second Venture, he had one Daughter, who was married to Mr. <HI>Fowler</HI>
of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> the sole Heiress of
whom is the present Lady <HI>Faulconbridge,</HI> to whom, were it of any
Use to me, I have the Honour of being a first Cousin by the
Half-Blood.</P>
<P>My Mother being now in Possession of a handsome Fortune,
and by the Death of her Grandmother entirely at her own Dis∣posal, for her
Fathern ever enquired what became of her, did not, it may be sup∣posed, 
<PB N="12" REF="19"/> want Admirers; especially as she had a very graceful
Person, with Abun∣dance of Wit, which was improved by reading and keeping the
best Company: however, none of them made any Impression on her Heart,
till she saw my Father, who was the Son of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Physician,
that ac∣cidentally settled in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and who had no other Fortune
to boast of, than a liberal Education, and a very amiable Person and
Understanding; Qualities which recom∣mended him to my Mother so powerfully,
that she had Constancy enough to wait for him three Years, while he went to
<HI>Leyden,</HI> where he studied Physick under the late fa∣mous Dr.
<HI>Boerhaave</HI>; and having taken his Degree, he returned to
<HI>Ireland,</HI> uniting him∣self in Marriage to his faithful Mistress.
Her Friends were at first much displeased with her; but my Father's Merit
soon re∣conciled them to her Choice; and there being then but one Man-Midwife
in the Kingdom, my Father made himself Master of that useful Art, and
practised it with great Success, Reputation, and Huma∣nity.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="20"/>I was their second Child, and my eldest
Brother dying an Infant, for a long Time their only one; being of a tender
weakly Constitution, I was by my Father greatly indulged; indeed I cannot
say, but it was in some Measure necessary he should, by his
Gentleness, qualify my Mother's Severity to me; otherwise it must have
broke my Heart; for she strictly followed <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Advice, in
never sparing the Rod; inso∣much that I have frequently been whipt for
looking blue of a frosty Morning; and, whether I deserved it or not, I was
sure of Correction every Day of my Life.</P>
<P>From my earliest Infancy I had a strong Disposition to
Letters; but my Eyes being weak, after the Small-pox, I was not permitted to
look at a Book; my Mother regarding more the Beauty of my Face, than the
Improvement of my Mind; nei∣ther was I allowed to learn to read: This
Restraint, as it generally happens, made me but more earnest in the
Pursuit of what I imagined must be so delightful. Twenty times a Day have
I been corrected, for ask∣ing what such and such Letters spelt; my 
<PB N="14" REF="21"/> Mother used to tell me the Word, accom∣panying it with a
good Box on the Ear, which, I suppose, imprinted it on my Mind. Had
<HI>Gulliver</HI> seen her Behaviour, I should have imagined, he had
borrowed a Hint from it for his floating Island, where, when a great Man had
promised any Favour, the Suppliant was obliged to give him a Tweak by the
Nose, or a Kick on the Rump, to quicken his Memory. However, I do assure
you, it had this Ef∣fect on me, insomuch, that I never forgot what was once
told me; and quickly arrived at my desired Happiness, being able to read
before she thought I knew all my Letters; but this Pleasure I was obliged
to enjoy by Stealth with Fear and Trembling.</P>
<P>I was at this Time about five Years of Age; and my Mother being
one Day a∣broad, I had happily laid hold on <HI>Alexan∣der's Feast,</HI> and
found something in it so charming, that I read it aloud;—but how like
a condemned Criminal did I look, when my Father, softly opening his
Study∣door, took me in the very Fact; I dropt my Book, and burst into Tears,
begging <PB N="15" REF="22"/> Pardon, and promising never to do so a∣gain:
But my Sorrow was soon dispelled, when he bade me not be frightened, but
read to him, which, to his great Surprize, I did very distinctly, and without
hurting the Beauty of the Numbers. Instead of the whipping, of which I
stood in dread, he took me up in his Arms, and kissed me, giving me a
whole Shilling, as a Re∣ward, and told me, 
<Q REND="inline">'He would give me another, as soon as I got a
Poem by Heart,'</Q> which he put into my Hand, and proved to be Mr.
<HI>Pope</HI>'s sacred Ec∣logue; which Task I performed before my Mother
returned Home. They were both astonished at my Memory, and from that Day
forward, I was permitted to read as much as I pleased; only my Father took
care to furnish me with the best, and poli∣test Authors; and took Delight
in explain∣ing to me, whatever, by Reason of my tender Years, was above my
Capacity of Understanding.</P>
<P>But chiefly was I charmed and ravished with the Sweets of
Poetry; all my Hours were dedicated to the Muses; and, from a 
<PB N="16" REF="23"/> Reader, I quickly became a Writer; I may truly say with
Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>I lisp'd in Numbers, for the Numbers came.</L></Q></P>
<P>My Performances had the good Fortune to be looked on as
extraordinary for my Years; and the greatest and wisest Men in the
Kingdom did not disdain to hear the Prattle of the little Muse, as they
called me, even in my childish Days. But as I ap∣proached towards Womanhood
there was a new Scene opened to me; and by the Time I had looked on thirteen
Years, I had almost as many Lovers; not that I ever was handsome, farther
than being very fair. But I was well-drest, sprightly, and remarkably
well-tempered, unapt to give or take Offence; insomuch that my Com∣pany was
generally coveted; and no doubt but I should have been happily disposed
of in Marriage, but that my Mother's capri∣cious Temper made her reject every
advan∣tageous Proposal offered, and at last con∣demn me to the Arms of one
of the great∣est V—s, with Reverence to the Priest∣hood. 
<PB N="17" REF="24" MS="y"/> be it spoken, that ever was wrapt up in
Crape.</P>
<P>And here I cannot forbear observing, how very few who wear that
S—d H—t are adorned with any real Sanctity of Man∣ners: What
Ambition, Avarice, Lust, and Cruelty reigns among them; they are ge∣nerally
the first Seducers of Innocence (as the Holiness of their Office gives them
free Admittance into every Family) and as soon as they have made a Breach in
the tender Mind for Ruin's wasteful Entrance, (pro∣vided they can but slip
their own Necks out of the Halter and remain unexposed) they shall be the
first to persecute with Ec∣clesiastical Courts, and Spiritual
Authori∣ty, that very Person, whom they them∣selves first taught the Way
to sin. 
<Q> 
<L>Let none presume to censure this as Spite,</L> 
<L>I suffer for their Crimes of whom I write,</L></Q> And 'tis
ever allowed that the Losers may have leave to speak.</P>
<P>I would not, by this Reflection, be thought to strike at
Religion, or the valuable Part <PB N="18" REF="25"/> of the Clergy: Those who
are possessed of Christian Charity, and make the Sincerity of their
Faith appear in the Righteousness of their Life, are truly worthy of
Reve∣rence and Honour; but alas! their Num∣ber is so few, that the Ears of
Corn are scarce discernable among the Tares, of whom no doubt Satan will
reap a plen∣tiful Harvest.</P>
<P>But to return. Amongst all those who addrest me, my Heart
retained its Freedom; and if their Flattery pleased me, it was only as it fed
my Vanity; that Passion, which, like Pride, is so universal: I had no
parti∣cular Engagement, was entirely submissive to my Parents, punctual
to all the Duties of Religion, unaffectedly innocent, and much more pleased
with my Female Friends, than with the Company of Men.</P>
<P>There were two young Ladies, in parti∣cular, for whom, from my
Childhood, I had a very tender Affection, and whom, as often as I could, I
visited; as their Brother was a Clergyman, many of the Gown fre∣quented their
House, and amongst the rest, the Reader of our Parish-Church, Mr. 
<PB N="19" REF="26"/> <HI>P—n.</HI> He had a good Face, and many agreeable
Accomplishments; as a tolerable Taste in Music, and a poetical Turn,
which greatly entertained me; but being a Man of obscure Birth, and low
Fortune, I had no farther Thoughts of him, than merely as an Acquaintance:
However, it was my Misfortune to be liked by him, when I least imagined it;
as he played very well on the Organ, he gave us an Invitation to Church,
promising, after Evening-Prayer, to sing an Anthem for us. I, who always
delighted in Church-Music, begged my Mother's Per∣mission to go, which,
with some Difficulty, I obtained. After the Music he invited us into the
Vestry-Room, where he had prepa∣red a little Collation of Fruit, Wine,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and singling me out, he began to address me in a very
passionate Stile, and earnestly beg∣ged Leave to visit me: I told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'I was to go into the Country next Day, to stay
all the Summer, and were I not, I had no Male Visitants, but such as my
Parents approved of; and consequently it was out of my Power to grant his
Request.'</Q> My Mother sending for me, prevented any far∣ther 
<PB N="20" REF="27"/> Conversation for that Time; and ear∣ly the next Morning
we set out on our in∣tended Journey.</P>
<P>During my Stay in the Country, he wrote me a great many poetical
Compli∣ments, and subscribed himself <HI>Amintas:</HI> As they were
really very elegant, my Mo∣ther, who always examined my Letters, exprest
great Curiosity to know the Wri∣ter; saying, 
<Q REND="inline">'I ought to return a Letter of Thanks to him:'</Q>
But as I took this only for a Trap, I told her, which was true, I knew not who
it was; lest I should be denied the Pleasure of visiting the young
Ladies, where I first saw him, if I should have given her the
smallest Hint, that I guessed at the Person.</P>
<P>I had, by this Time, a Brother of about nine Years of Age, of whom
my Father and Mother were fond even to Extrava∣gance; whenever I went abroad,
he used to cry to go with me, and was constantly indulged in it.</P>
<P>A few Days after our Return to Town, I went to wait on the young
Ladies before∣mentioned, and took my Brother with me; <PB N="21" REF="28"/> I
was scarce seated when Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> came in; and after saluting
me, began to re∣proach me with Cruelty, in never having favoured him with an
Answer to any of his Letters. I told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'I was much obliged to him, for the agreeable
Entertainment they had afforded me; but that, except∣ing my Father, I had never
wrote to any Man, neither was I Mistress of Wit e∣nough to correspond
with him.'</Q> A good many civil Things were said on either Hand, during Tea
Time; after which my Brother growing urgent with me to return Home, I happened
to say he was so great a Favourite, I durst not contradict him; upon
which, Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> made his Appli∣cation to him, and gave him an
Invitation to his Lodgings; where he entertained him so kindly, that the
Child returned in Rap∣tures with him; and loaden with Toys and Sweetmeats. Upon
this Civility to my Brother, my Father sent and invited Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> to Dinner; (and you may be sure he did not refuse him)
but quickly found the Art of making himself so agreeable to my Parents,
that they were even uneasy <PB N="22" REF="29"/> whenever he was absent;
which seldom happened, except when his Duty required his Attendance. He now
began openly to court me; and, to my great Surprize, nei∣ther of them feemod
averse to it; but al∣lowed him as much Liberty of conversing with me, as a
reasonable Man could desire; and for my own Part, he gained so large a
Share in my Esteem, that as they seemed to approve of him, I was very well
satis∣fied.</P>
<P>One Year past on in this Manner, during which Time, Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> never omitted any Thing to convince me of the Sincerity of
his Passion; and tho' he saw me every Day, and all the Day; yet every Day
was still but as the first: 
<Q> 
<L>So eager was he still to see me more.</L></Q></P>
<P>The ensuing Spring, my Mother took a Lodging, about a Mile from
<HI>Dublin,</HI> by the Sea-side, for the Benefit of bathing, where my Father
and Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> came every Afternoon together to visit us; but my
Father's Business seldom permitting <PB N="23" REF="30"/> him to stay
above half an Hour, he gene∣rally left Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> with us: Who, one
Night happening to stay later than ordina∣ry, left a Gold Watch, and a
handsome Diamond Ring in my Possession; lest, as he said, he
should be robbed of them going Home. My Father and he coming to us the next
Day, (according to Custom) I brought to Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> his Ring and
Watch; but he would by no Means ac∣cept of either, but insisted on my
keeping them as a Present; my Father and Mother were both by; and neither of
them shew∣ing any Dislike to it, I was, with great Reluctance, obliged by
him to take them.</P>
<P>I mention these Particulars, trifling as they are, because I
have been accused of Disobedience to my Parents, in marrying without their
Consent or Knowledge; whereas they were acquainted with the Af∣fair from
Beginning to End; neither was I any more than passive in it; never hav∣ing
allowed myself to have any Will but theirs.</P>
<P>My Father was at this Time so eminent in his Profession, and
lived after so elegant <PB N="24" REF="31" MS="y"/> a manner, that every body
concluded, he was able to give me a very good Fortune; and few People could
believe he counte∣nanced Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Addresses to me; he
neither having any Preferment in the Church, nor any other Fortune: And
what∣ever Merit an <HI>Irish</HI> Clergyman may possess, he has little
Hope of Advancement by it, unless he has some Relation in the House of
Commons, who, by betraying the Inte∣rest of his Country, can procure for him,

<Q> 
<L>The Leavings of a Church distrest,</L> 
<L>A hungry Vicarage at best;</L> 
<L>Or some remote inferior Post,</L> 
<L>With forty Pounds a Year at most.</L><BIBL>Swift.</BIBL></Q>
And in this, the present State of poor <HI>Ire∣land</HI> nearly resembles
that of <HI>England,</HI> un∣der the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> when, as
soon as a Bishoprick became vacant, an <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> was immediately
nominated to it. <HI>Ireland</HI> groans under the same Calamity: An
<HI>English</HI> V—y, <HI>English</HI> Judges, <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Bishops, with their long Train of Re∣lations and Dependants, lay their hard 
<PB N="25" REF="32"/> Hands on all Preferments; while her learn∣ed Sons
languish out Life, in hopeless Po∣verty and Dejection of Spirit.</P>
<P>I have frequently observed it, as a Want of Policy in the
<HI>English</HI> Government, to permit the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> to have
an U∣niversity: Learning naturally inspires Men with the Love of Liberty;
the Principles of which ought to be discouraged in the Minds of those, whom
their Masters are pleased to condemn to Slavery, Want and Oppression;
unless, perhaps it may be done with a cruel Intent, of making their Yoke the
more galling to them.</P>
<P><HI>Ireland,</HI> while free, was remarkable for producing brave
and valiant Men. Ever witness for her, 
<Q> 
<L>Her matchless Sons! whose Valour still remains</L> 
<L>On <HI>French</HI> Records for twenty long Cam∣paigns;</L> 
<L>Yet from an Empress, now a Captive grown;</L> 
<L>She sav'd <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Right, and lost her
own.</L><BIBL>Swift.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="33"/>I hope I shall be pardoned by all true
Patriots for this Digression; if not, I can only make Use of
<HI>Falstaff</HI>'s Apology, <HI>That Rebellion lay in my Way, and I found
it.</HI></P>
<P>But to resume my Thread. All my Friends and Relations attacked
my Father warmly on this Head; who solemnly de∣clared, 
<Q REND="inline">'He knew nothing of any amorous Correspondence
between Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> and his Daughter, that the Gentleman came to
visit us, as being Parishioners:'</Q> But withal declared: 
<Q REND="inline">'Since such a Report was spread, he would
civilly forbid him the House;'</Q> which accordingly he or∣dered my Mother to
do. Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> came as usual, and my Mother delivered her
dreadful Commission to him. No sooner was the fatal Sentence pronounced,
but my astonished Lover fell pale and speechless to the Floor; and to
say the Truth, my Case was little better than his: I raised him in my
Arms, and senseless as he seemed, he grasped me close, and leaned
his drooping Head upon my Bosom; whilst my Mother applied Remedies to 
<PB N="27" REF="34"/> him till he revived: When he came to himself, he blamed
us for our Care: say∣ing, 
<Q REND="inline">'Since I was lost, he could not, would not
live.'</Q></P>
<P>As I was naturally of a soft compas∣sionate Temper, the
Condition I saw him in pierced my very Soul; but I was too much in Awe of my
Mother to venture to say so at that Time. So he left me with Sorrow deeply
imprinted in his Counte∣nance, and, as I believed, in his Heart.</P>
<P>About two Years before this, a young Woman of about eighteen Years
of Age, was brought to my Father, by a Stationer, to be by him instructed in
Midwifery: She was Mistress of <HI>Hebrew, Greek, Latin</HI> and
<HI>French,</HI> understood the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> as well as most Men:
And what made these extraordinary Talents yet more surprizing, was, that
her Parents were poor illiterate Country People; so that her Learning
ap∣peared like the Gift poured out on the A∣postles, of speaking all
Languages, with∣out the Pains of Study; or, like the intui∣tive Knowledge of
Angels: Yet in as much as the Power of Miracles is ceased; we 
<PB N="28" REF="35"/> must allow she used human Means for such great and
excellent Acquirements: And yet in a long Friendship and Famili∣arity with
her, I could never obtain a satis∣factory Account from her on this Head; only
she said, 
<Q REND="inline">'she had received some little Instruction
from the Minister of the Pa∣rish, when she could spare Time from her
Needlework, to which she was closely kept by her Mother.'</Q> She wrote
elegant∣ly both in Verse and Prose; and some of the most delightful
Hours I ever past, were in the Conversation of this female
Philosopher.</P>
<P>My Father readily consented to accept of her as a Pupil; and
gave her a general Invitation to his Table, so that she and I were seldom
asunder. My Parents were well pleased with our Intimacy, as her Piety was
not inferior to her Learning. Whe∣ther it was owing to her own Desire, or the
Envy of those who survived her, I know not; but of her various and
beautiful Wri∣tings, except one Poem of her's in Mrs. <HI>Barber</HI>'s Works,
I have never seen any published; 'tis true, as her Turn was chief∣ly 
<PB N="29" REF="36"/> to philosophical or divine Subjects, they might not be
agreeable to the present Taste; yet could her heavenly Muse de∣scend
from its sublime Height to the easy epistolary Stile, and suit itself
to my then gay Disposition; as may appear by the two following Poems: To
make them intelli∣gible, my Reader must observe, that I being in a Country
Town at the Assizes Time, had writ her an Account to <HI>Dublin</HI> of the
principal Entertainments I met with there and in the rest of the Country. I
must also beg Pardon for publishing the Compliments paid to me in them,
which I really would omit were it possible. Her Answer to my first
Letter was this.

</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="41"/>As this Lady was perfectly well ac∣quainted
with Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Regard for me, he applied to her to intreat a
Meeting at her Lodgings, where I frequently went.</P>
<P>She had too much Compassion for a des∣pairing honourable
Lover to refuse his Re∣quest; and accordingly she gave him No∣tice the
next Visit that I made to her, after having asked my Consent to it. Our
In∣terview was very melancholy, and his Sighs and Tears prevailed so much on
my young soft Heart, that, at last, I faithfully pro∣mised to be his; but
added, 
<Q REND="inline">'We were both so young, that it would be prudent
to wait till he had some Preferment, or till my Parents came into better
Tem∣per; and that, in the mean time, I would see him, or write to him, as
often as I conveniently could.'</Q></P>
<P>I forgot to mention, that I had sent him his Watch and Ring
some Days before; he would fain have prevailed on me to take them again, but
I absolutely refused them.</P>
<P>The next Morning, my Father told me, I must prepare to go and
stay a Year with my Grandfather, who lived a hundred Miles 
<PB N="35" REF="42"/> distant from <HI>Dublin,</HI> and that I must set
out in two Days. I made no Answer, but thought proper to give Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> No∣tice of my Departure, and easily prevailed on my
Brother to give him a Letter; but Heav'ns! how was I frighted when he,
re∣turning in a few Moments, told me, Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> had stabbed
himself with his Penknife: I ran all in Tears to my Mo∣ther, entreating her
Permission to go and see him. She appeared much concerned, and sent for
him to come to us, which pleas∣ing Summons he readily obeyed. But I could
scarce forbear laughing at my own Credulity, when my wounded Swain came to us
in perfect Health. He had indeed given himself a Scratch, on Purpose to
ter∣rify us, and had just such a desperate Wound as I have frequently
received from the Point of a Pin, without complaining.</P>
<P>However, by this Artifice he once more gained Admission to us,
and had an Op∣portunity of assuring my Mother, 
<Q REND="inline">'That if she sent me to the
<HI>West-Indies,</HI> he would follow me;'</Q> and added also, 
<Q REND="inline">'That he was next Heir to a good Estate;'</Q> 
<PB N="36" REF="43"/> which was the most prevailing Argument he could make
use of to her; and took such an Effect, that she not only kept him to
Supper, but so far indulged him, as to give him a Key to the Garden which
o∣pened into a little Stable Lane, by which means he could come in and go out
as often as he pleased unnoticed. As soon as he left us, my Mother spoke
to me in this Manner: 
<Q REND="inline">'Child, said she, I believe that young Man
loves you sincerely, neither have your Father or I any Objection to him; but
in the Light we appear in to the World, it would seem strange to ac∣cept of
him as a Son-in law. Your Fa∣ther is not, at present, able to give you a
Fortune; and I know most of those who address you, hope for one with you;
and he chuses rather to reject them, than let them into his real
Circumstances: What I would therefore advise you to is this: If you love
this Man, marry him; we shall at first seem displeased, and then
forgive it, and do for you every thing within our Power; as he is an ingenious,
sober Man, your Father's Interest may <PB N="37" REF="44"/> soon get him a
Living, and till then ye shall both live with us.'</Q></P>
<P>This Discourse strangely surprized me, and left me
doubtful how to act; to take to myself the Reproach of Disobedience, in the
Eyes of the World, appeared very shocking to me; and tho' I was resolved to
marry Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> some Time or o∣ther, yet I was startled at the
Thought of doing it immediately, and told my Mo∣ther my Objections: However
they ap∣peared but trifling to her. The next Morning she called me pretty
early to Breakfast, and, to my great Surprize, I found Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>
with my Father, his Harpsichord placed in the Parlour, which, with a Cat and
an Owl, were all his world∣ly Goods.</P>
<P>He told me with great Rapture, that he was going for a Ring and a
Licence to be married in the Evening. As for my Part, I thought he only
jested, till my Father confirmed it, by telling me I must either resolve
to marry immediately, or break off with Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> entirely,
leaving it to my Choice which to do. I was too <PB N="38" REF="45"/> much
confounded to make any other Return than to give my Hand to Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> who kissed it with great Extacy; and my unfortunate
Nuptials being thus concluded, we were married privately in the Evening by the
Vicar-General, having no other Wit∣nesses but my Father and Mother, and his
Father, and we resolved to keep it secret for a few Days to avoid the Hurry
and Expence of Matrimony. We went into the Country to my Uncle Brigadier
<HI>Meade</HI>'s Seat for a Fortnight; where my new es∣poused Husband
staying from me a whole Day, in Pursuit of his Game (for he de∣lighted in
Fowling) at his Return, I pre∣sented him with the following Lines, my first
Attempt in Poetry that was not quite childish: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>The Petition of the BIRDS.</HEAD>
<L>AH Shepherd, gentle Shepherd! spare</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>This little poetical Essay met with more Applause than it
really merited, on Account of my Youth, and was extremely acceptable to Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> who, with the Raptures of an enamoured Bridegroom, read it
to every Person whom he thought possessed of Taste or Genius.</P>
<P>On our Return to Town, we received the Visits and Compliments of
all our Ac∣quaintance; every one of whom my Mo∣ther assured, I had married
without their Consent; but this was not all, for she said it so often,
that at length she persuaded her∣self it was so; and made it a Pretence
for giving me all imaginable ill Treatment, both in publick and private, which,
having no Remedy, I was obliged to bear as pa∣tiently as I could; for if I
quitted her House, I had no Place to go to, as Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s whole
Income would scarce have paid the Rent of a tolerable ready furnished
Lodging. However I had some Consola∣tion in Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s
Tenderness, which <PB N="41" REF="48"/> seemed daily to increase for me,
and in the Conversation of a very agreeable Set of Friends, some of whom it
may not be a∣miss to give a particular Description of.</P>
<P>In the first Place, I had the Honour of being well received by
Mrs. <HI>Percival,</HI> who is married to the Brother of the Earl of
<HI>Egmont,</HI> to whose Virtues I cannot refuse doing Justice, (altho'
her Censures of me have not been over-charitable) a Lady of most
universal Genius, there being no one Accomplishment, that adorns the Woman
of Quality but what she possessed; and her Sta∣tion gave her an
Opportunity of shewing them to Advantage; she was also extreme∣ly happy
in her Family; her Husband was a most worthy Gentleman; both her Sons Men
of Sense and Honour, and one of her Daughters very agreeable. It may easily
be supposed this Belle Assembly engaged the Company of all the learned
and polite World; every Night was a Drawing-Room, and the ingenious and curious
of both Sexes went Home delighted and im∣proved. As my Father was Physician
to Mrs. <HI>Percival,</HI> and her eldest Son married <PB N="42" REF="49"/> to
a near Relation of mine, I had at all Times free Access, and so found a
frequent pleasing Relief from my Vexations.</P>
<P>I had also the much envied Honour of being known to Dr.
<HI>Swift,</HI> whose Ge∣nius, excellent as it was, surpassed not his
Humanity in the most judicious and useful Charities; altho' often hid under
a rough Appearance, till he was perfectly convinced both of the Honesty and
Distress of those he bestowed it on: He was a perpetual Friend to Merit
and Learning; and utter∣ly incapable of Envy. Indeed why should he not? who,
in true genuine Wit, could fear no Rival.</P>
<P>Yet as I have frequently observed in Life, that where great
Talents are bestowed, there the strongest Passions are likewise
given: This truly great Man did but too often let them have Dominion over him,
and that on the most trifling Occasions. During Meal-times he was evermore
in a Storm; the Meat was always too much or too little done, or the Servants
had offended in some Point, imperceptible to the rest of the Company;
however, when the Cloth <PB N="43" REF="50"/> was taken away, he made his
Guests rich Amends for the Pain he had given them by the former Part of his
Behaviour. For 
<Q> 
<L>Then was truly mingled in the friendly Bowl</L> 
<L>The Feast of Reason and the Flow of Soul.</L> 
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></Q> Yet strict Temperance preserved; for
the Doctor never drank above half a Pint of Wine, in every Glass of which he
mixed Water and Sugar; yet, if he liked his Company, would sit many Hours
over it, unlocking all the Springs of Policy, Learn∣ing, true Humour and
inimitable Wit.</P>
<P>It is a very great Loss to the World, that this admirable
Gentleman never could be prevailed on to give us the Particulars of his own
Life; because, as it is the Fate of all eminent Persons to have various
Cha∣racters given of them, so it was more re∣markably his: One Reason for
this may justly be assigned; that as at his first setting out Party
ran high, those who on either Side had any Talents for Writing, spared not
to throw the blackest Aspersions on the <PB N="44" REF="51"/> other; so
that, if we give them both Cre∣dit, we must conclude, there was neither
Honour nor Virtue among them; but that all who were out, <HI>Tories</HI> and
<HI>Whigs, Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories,</HI> were equally corrupt: Indeed
Ambition is a grand Deceiver, and apt to undermine Integrity itself; and this
the Doctor himself was so sensible of, that I have frequently heard him
declare, 
<Q REND="inline">'He thought it a great Blessing that all his
Hopes of Preferment were at once cut off; insomuch that he had nothing to
tempt or mislead him from a Patriotism, in which his grateful Country found
their Happiness and Security.'</Q></P>
<P>This leads me to a Story, I remember to have heard him tell, and
therefore, I hope, cannot be impertinent:</P>
<P>A Clergyman, whose Character greatly resembled that I have
heard Bishop <HI>Berkley</HI> give to Bishop <HI>Atterbury</HI>; namely, a
most learned fine Gentleman, who under the soft∣est and politest
Appearance concealed the most turbulent Ambition: This Clergy∣man having made
his Merit, as a Preacher, too eminent to be overlooked, had it early 
<PB N="45" REF="52"/> rewarded with a Mitre; his Friend Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> went
to congratulate him on it; but at the same Time told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'He hoped, as his Lordship was a Native of
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and had now a Seat in the House of Peers, he would employ
his powerful Elocution in the Service of his distressed Country.'</Q> The
Prelate told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'The Bishoprick was but a very small one, and
he could not hope for a better, if he did not oblige the Court.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Very well, says <HI>Swift,</HI> then it is to
be hoped, when you have a better, you will become an honest Man.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, that I will, Mr. Dean, says he, till then,
my Lord, farewel.'</Q> This pious Prelate was twice translated to richer
Sees; and, on every Translation, Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> waited on him to remind
him of his Promise, but to no Purpose; there was now an Archbishoprick in
View, and till that was obtained, nothing could be done: This in a short Time
he likewise possessed; he then sent for the Dean, and told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'I am now at the Top of my Pre∣ferment, for I well
know no <HI>Irishman</HI> will ever be made Primate, therefore as 
<PB N="46" REF="53"/> I can rise no higher in Fortune or Sta∣tion, I will
zealously promote the good of my Country.'</Q> (A fine Reason truly!) And
so he commenced a most outrageous Patriot, from those very laudable
Motives, and continued so till his Death, which hap∣pened within these few
Years.</P>
<P>I hope my Readers will indulge me in the frequent Mention I
shall make of Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>; for tho' his Works are univer∣sally
esteemed; yet few Persons now living, have had so many Opportunities of
seeing him in private Life; as my being a Person <HI>sans</HI>
Consequence afforded me, which Hap∣piness I obtained by the following
Means:</P>
<P>The learned Nymph before-mentioned, whom Curiosity engaged every
Person to see, had shewn many of my Scribbles to Dr. <HI>Delany,</HI>
known sufficiently by his own incomparable Life and Writings: As she was
one of the first to congratulate me on my Marriage; she was a Witness how
severely both Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> and I were used, or rather abused by
my Mother; she told Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> of it, and made such fa∣vourable
mention of the poor young Couple, <PB N="47" REF="54"/> that he generously
imagined his countenan∣cing Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> might be a Means of
pro∣curing us better Treatment. He had been Class-fellow with my Father in
the Col∣lege, and tho' they did not visit, yet they had that mutual Esteem
for each other, which good Men feel for good Men; and were pleased whenever
Accident threw them into each other's Company. The Doctor, preaching at our
Parish Church immedi∣ately after our Marriage, was so kind as to join us
coming out, and accompany us Home, to wish the young Couple Joy, a Favour we
were all extremely proud of; at parting he gave us all an Invitation to to dine
at his beautiful Villa, about a small Mile distant from <HI>Dublin</HI>;
what Opinion I conceived of him and his Improvements, may be seen in the
following Lines, com∣posed in one of his lovely Arbours:—

</LG></Q></P>
<P>Whether it was owing to my Youth, or any real Merit in the
Verses, I know not, but, weak as they were, from the Candour of the Company
they met with great Applause, and the worthy Gentleman to whom they were
directed, praised the Poetry extremely, only modestly wished I had a
better Sub∣ject to employ my fine Genius, as he was pleased to call it.</P>
<P>I hope, if I should live to publish these Writings, none of
the honourable Persons mentioned in them, as having been once my Friends,
will be offended at it; since whate∣ver Misfortunes have since befallen me,
I was not then quite unworthy of the Re∣gard they shewed me, and still
retain a grateful Sense of their Favour; only la∣menting that by one fatal
Folly it is irreco∣verably lost.</P>
<P>And now I must confess, as I have talked of Ambition, I had a
strong one to be known to Dr. <HI>Swift:</HI> As Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> had
recommended and introduced Mr. <PB N="50" REF="57"/> <HI>P—n</HI> to him,
and the learned Lady before-mentioned, I thought it a little hard to be
excluded from the Delight and In∣struction I might possibly receive from
such Conversation; and having often re∣monstrated on this Head, to no
Purpose, I at last told them, (for to give me my due I was pretty pert) 
<Q REND="inline">'that truly they were envious, and would not let
me see the Dean, knowing how much I surpassed them all.'</Q> As I
spoke this but half se∣rious, I set them all a laughing, and as they were
to meet the next Day at the Deanery-House to keep the Anniversary of his
Birth-day, I inclosed to Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> the following Lines: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Dr. <HI>SWIFT,</HI> on his
<HI>Birth-day.</HI></HEAD>
<L>WHILE I the God-like Men of Old,</L>
<L>In Admiration wrapt behold!</L>
<L>Rever'd Antiquity explore,</L>
<L>And turn the long-liv'd Volumes o'er,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Cato, Plutarch, Flaccus</HI> shine</L>
<L>In ev'ry Excellence divine;</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="58"/>I grieve that our degen'rate Days,</L>
<L>Produce no mighty Souls like these;</L>
<L>Patriot, Philosopher and Bard,</L>
<L>Are Names unknown, and seldom heard.</L>
<L>Spare your Reflection, <HI>Phoebus</HI> cries,</L>
<L>'Tis as ungrateful as unwise;</L>
<L>Can you complain this sacred Day,</L>
<L>That Virtues, or that Arts decay?</L>
<L>Behold in SWIFT reviv'd appears</L>
<L>The Virtues of unnumber'd Years;</L>
<L>Behold in him with new Delight,</L>
<L>The Patriot, Bard and Sage unite;</L>
<L>And know, <HI>Ierne</HI> in that Name</L>
<L>Shall rival <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> in Fame.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> presented these Lines to the Dean, and at
the same time told him my saucy Speech above-mentioned. The Dean kindly
accepted of my Compliment, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">'He would see me whenever I pleas∣ed.'</Q> A
most welcome Message to me!</P>
<P>A few Days after, the Dean sent the Doctor Word, he would dine
with him at <HI>Delville,</HI> and desired to meet Mr. and Mrs.
<HI>P—n</HI> there: You may be assured I obeyed this welcome Summons,
and a Gen∣tlewoman <PB N="52" REF="59"/> was so kind as to call on me to go
with her; when we arrived, Dr. <HI>De∣lany</HI>'s Servant told us, his
Master, the Dean, and Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> were walking in the Garden; we
met them on a noble Terrass, whose Summit was crowned with a mag∣nificent
Portico, where Painting and Sculp∣ture displayed their utmost Charms: The
Lady presented me to the Dean, who sa∣luted me, and surprized me, by
asking her, 
<Q REND="inline">'If I was her Daughter?'</Q> She smiled and
said, 
<Q REND="inline">'I was Mrs. <HI>P—n.</HI>'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What, says he, this poor little Child married!
God help her, she is early engaged in Trouble.'</Q> We passed the Day in
a most elegant and delightful Manner; and the Dean, engag∣ing Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> to preach for him at the Cathedral the <HI>Sunday</HI>
following, gave me also with the rest of the Company an Invi∣tation to
Dinner. As the Communion is administered every <HI>Sunday</HI> in this
antique Church, dedicated to St. <HI>Patrick,</HI> the first Prelate who
taught the Gospel in <HI>Ireland,</HI> I was charmed to see with what a
becoming Piety the Dean performed that solemn Ser∣vice; which he had so
much at Heart, that <PB N="53" REF="60"/> he wanted not the Assistance of
the Litur∣gy, but went quite thro' it without ever looking in the Prayer-Book.
Indeed an∣other Part of his Behaviour on this Occa∣sion was censured by
some as savouring of <HI>Popery,</HI> which was, that he bowed to the
Holy-Table; however this Circumstance may vindicate him from the wicked
Asper∣sion of being deemed an Unbeliever, since 'tis plain he had the
utmost Reverence for the Eucharist. Service being over, we met the Dean at
the Church-Door, sur∣rounded by a Crowd of Poor, to all of whom he gave
Charity, excepting one old Woman, who held out a very dirty Hand to him; he
told her very gravely, 
<Q REND="inline">'That though she was a Beggar, Water was not
so scarce but she might have washed her Hands:'</Q> And so we marched
with the Silver Verge before us to the Deanery-House. When we came into the
Parlour, the Dean kindly saluted me, and without allowing me Time to sit
down, bade me come and see his Study; Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> was for
following us, but the Dean told him merrily, He did not desire his Company; 
<PB N="54" REF="61"/> and so he ventured to trust me with him into the
Library: 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, says he, I have brought you here to
shew you all the Mo∣ney I got when I was in the Ministry, but do not
steal any of it.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will not indeed, Sir, says I;'</Q> so he
opened a Ca∣binet, and shewed me a whole Parcel of empty Drawers; 
<Q REND="inline">'Bless me, say he, the Money is flown;'</Q> he
then opened his Bureau, wherein he had a great Number of curious Trinkets of
various Kinds, some of which he told me, 
<Q REND="inline">'Were presented to him by the Earl and
Countess of <HI>Oxford</HI>; some by Lady <HI>Masham,</HI> and some by
La∣dy <HI>Betty Germain</HI>;'</Q> at last, coming to a Drawer filled with
Medals, he bade me chuse two for myself; but he could not help smiling,
when I began to poize them in my Hands, chusing them by Weight rather than
Antiquity, of which indeed I was not then a Judge.</P>
<P>The Dean amused me in this Manner till we were summoned to
Dinner, where his Behaviour was so humorous, that I cannot avoid relating
some Part of it: He placed himself at the Head of his Table opposite 
<PB N="55" REF="62"/> to a great Pier-Glass, under which was a Marble
Side-board, so that he could see in the Glass whatever the Servants did
at it: He was served entirely in Plate, and with great Elegance; but the Beef
being over∣roasted put us all in Confusion, the Dean called for the
Cook-maid, and ordered her to take it down Stairs, and do it less; the Maid
answered, very innocently, 
<Q REND="inline">'That she could not:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, what Sort of a Crea∣ture are you, says he,
to commit a Fault which cannot be amended?'</Q> And turning to me he said
very gravely, 
<Q REND="inline">'That he hoped, as the Cook was a Woman of Genius,
he should, by this Manner of ar∣guing, be able in about a Year's Time to
convince her she had better send up the Meat too little than too much
done;'</Q> charging the Men Servants, 
<Q REND="inline">'Whenever they imagined the Meat was ready, they
should take it Spit and all, and bring it up by Force, promising to aid
them, in case the Cook resisted.'</Q> The Dean then turning his Eye on
the Looking-glass es∣pied the Butler opening a Bottle of Ale, and helping
himself to the first Glass; he <PB N="56" REF="63"/> very kindly jumbled
the rest together, that his Master and Guests might all fare alike. 
<Q REND="inline">'Ha! Friend, says the Dean, Sharp's the Word, I
find you drank my Ale, for which I stop two Shillings of your Board-Wages
this Week, for I scorn to be out∣done in any thing, even in cheating.'</Q>
Dinner at last was over to my great Joy; for now I had Hope of a more
agreeable Entertainment than what the squabbling with the Servants had
afforded us.</P>
<P>The Dean thanked Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> for his Sermon: 
<Q REND="inline">'I never, says he, preached but twice in my
Life, and then they were not Sermons, but Pamphlets.'</Q> I asked him, 
<Q REND="inline">'What might be the Subject of them;'</Q> he told
me, 
<Q REND="inline">'They were against <HI>Wood</HI>'s
Half-pence.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray, Madam, says he, do you smoke;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No indeed, Sir, says I;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nor your Husband;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Neither, Sir:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is a Sign, said he, you were neither of you
bred in the Univer∣sity of <HI>Oxford</HI>; for drinking and smoak∣ing are
the first Rudiments of Learning taught there; and in those two Arts no
University in <HI>Europe</HI> can out-do them.'</Q> <PB N="57" REF="64"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray Mrs. <HI>P—n</HI> tell me your
Faults;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir, I must beg to be excused, for if
I can help it, you shall never find them out;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, says he, then Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>
shall tell me;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will, Sir, says he, when I have discovered
them.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray Mr. Dean, says Dr. <HI>Delany,</HI> why
will you be so unpolite, as to suppose Mrs. <HI>P—n</HI> has any
Faults?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, I will tell you, replied the Dean; whenever
I see a Number of agreeable Qualities in any Person, I am always sure,
they have bad ones sufficient to poize the Scale.'</Q> I bowed, and told the
Dean, 
<Q REND="inline">'He did me great Honour:'</Q> And in this I copied
Bi∣shop <HI>Berkley,</HI> whom I have frequently heard declare, 
<Q REND="inline">'That when any Speech was made to him, which might
be construed either into a Compliment, or an Affront, or (that to make use
of his own Word) had two Handles; he was so meek and so mild, that he
always took hold of the best.'</Q></P>
<P>The Dean then asked me, 
<Q REND="inline">'If I was a Queen, what I should chuse to have
after Dinner?'</Q> I answered, 
<Q REND="inline">'His Conversa∣tion;'</Q> <PB N="58" REF="65"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Phooh! says he, I mean what Regale?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A Dish of Coffee, Sir;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why then I will so far make you as hap∣py as a
Queen, you shall have some in Perfection; for when I was Chaplain to the
Earl of <HI>Berkley,</HI> who was in the Go∣vernment here, I was so poor, I
was ob∣liged to keep a Coffee-house, and all the Nobility resorted to it to
talk Treason:'</Q> I could not help smiling at this Oddity, but I really
had such an Awe on me, that I could not venture to ask him, as I longed to
do, what it meant? The Bottle and Glasses being taken away, the Dean set
a∣bout making the Coffee; but the Fire scorching his Hand, he called to me to
reach him his Glove, and changing the Coffee-pot to his Left-hand, held out his
Right one, ordered me to put the Glove on it, which accordingly I did; when
taking up Part of his Gown to fan himself with, and acting in Character of a
prudish Lady, he said, 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, I do not know what to think; Women may be
honest that do such Things, but, for my Part, I never could bear to touch
any Man's Flesh—<PB N="59" REF="66"/> except my Husband's, whom
perhaps, says he, she wished at the Devil.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> says he, you would not
tell me your Wife's Faults; but I have found her out to be a d—ned,
insolent, proud, unmannerly Slut:'</Q> I looked con∣founded, not knowing what
Offence I had committed.—Says Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, Sir, I must confess she is a little
saucy to me sometimes, but—what has she done now?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Done! why nothing, but sat there quietly, and
never once offered to interrupt me in making the Coffee, whereas had I had a
Lady of modern good Breeding here, she would have struggled with me for the
Coffee-pot till she had made me scald myself and her, and made me throw
the Coffee in the Fire; or per∣haps at her Head, rather than permit me to take
so much trouble for her.'</Q></P>
<P>This raised my Spirits and as I found the Dean always prefaced a
Compliment with an Affront, I never afterwards was startled at the latter,
(as too many have been, not entering into his peculiarly ironical Strain) but
was modestly contented with <PB N="60" REF="67"/> the former, which was more
than I deserv∣ed, and which the Surprize rendered doubly pleasing.</P>
<P>By this Time, the Bell rang for Church; and Dr. <HI>Delany</HI>
and Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> who with myself were now all the Company, (for
the rest departed before the Coffee was out) were obliged to attend the
Summons: But as there is no Service in the Cathedral, but Evening-Prayer at Six
o'Clock, I chose rather to attend the Dean there, than go to hear another
Sermon; by this means I had him all to myself for near three Hours, during
which Time he made me read to him the Annals of the four last Years of the
Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> written by him∣self; the Intentions of which
seemed to be a Vindication of the then Ministry and him∣self, from having
any Design of placing the Pretender on the Throne of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI>
It began with a solemn Adjuration, that all the Facts therein contained were
Truth, and then proceeded in the Manner of Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> with giving
the particular Cha∣racters of every Person whom he should have occasion
to mention; amongst whom, <PB N="61" REF="68"/> I remember, he compared Lord
<HI>Bolling∣broke</HI> to <HI>Petronius,</HI> one who agreeably mingled
Business with Pleasure. At the Conclusion of every Period, he demanded
of me, 
<Q REND="inline">'Whether I understood it? For I would, says
he, have it intelligent to the meanest Capacity, and if you compre∣prehend
it, 'tis possible every Body may.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I bowed, and assured him I did.'</Q> And
indeed it was written with such Perspecuity and Elegance of Stile, that I
must have had no Capacity at all, if I did not taste what was so
exquisitely beautiful.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> when he was Chaplain to Alderman
<HI>Barber,</HI> in the Year of his Mayoralty, mentioned those Annals to Mr.
<HI>Pope,</HI> who said he had dissuaded the Dean from publishing them;
as the Facts contained in them were notoriously false. I was greatly
astonished when Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> told me this, nor could I tell what
to deter∣mine: It seemed strange to me, that a Person of the Dean's good
Sense and Ve∣racity, should in the most solemn manner invocate the
Almighty to bear Testimony to Falshoods, publicly known to be such. 
<PB N="62" REF="69"/> And yet as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was in Prose a Man of
unquestioned Probity, and united to the Dean in the strictest Bonds of
Friendship, and consequently, without doubt, well ac∣quainted with the
Transactions of those Times, we can hardly suppose he would speak in
the manner he did, without just Grounds for so doing; and his Evidence
seems strengthened by his being of the <HI>Ro∣mish</HI> Religion, which
must certainly incline him to wish well to a Prince of the same Faith.
However, upon the whole, I am inclined to judge charitably of the Dean; and to
believe, that tho' the Ministers fre∣quently employed him as a Writer, and
en∣tertained him as a Companion; yet they had not let him into the Depth of
their De∣signs, <HI>the Mystery of Iniquity!</HI> So that what he relates
in his Annals of the invio∣lable Attachment of those in Power to the
<HI>Hanover</HI> Succession and the <HI>Protestant</HI> Faith, might be
by him believed to be Truth: For who so wise but may be de∣ceived? And
perhaps Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s long and intimate Correspondence with Lord
<HI>Bolling∣broke</HI> gave him a better Knowledge of <PB N="63" REF="70"/> what
was really intended at that critical Juncture. Pardon this Digression.</P>
<P>The Bell rang for Evening-Prayer, to which I accompanied the Dean.
There is a fine Organ in this Church, which, with its antique Magnificence and
so harmonious a Choir, brought <HI>Milton</HI>'s Lines into my Mind: 
<Q> 
<L>And let my due Feet never fail</L> 
<L>To walk the studious Cloysters pale,</L> 
<L>And love the high embowed Roof,</L> 
<L>With antique Pillars, massy Proof,</L> 
<L>And story'd Windows richly dight,</L> 
<L>Shedding a dim religious Light;</L> 
<L>There let the pealing Organ blow</L> 
<L>To the full-voic'd Choir below;</L> 
<L>In Service high! and Anthem clear,</L> 
<L>Which may with Pleasure thro' mine Ear,</L> 
<L>Dissolve me into Extasies,</L> 
<L>And bring all Heaven before my Eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>On our Return to the Deanery-house, we found there waiting our
coming Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> and Mr. <HI>Rochford,</HI> to whose Wife, <HI>A
Letter of Advice to a new-married Lady,</HI> <PB N="64" REF="71"/> (published
since in the Dean's Works) was written, and which by the bye, the Lady did
not take as a Compliment, either to her or the Sex, Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Sheridan,</HI> Author of the Art of Punning, with two or three other
Clergymen, (who usually passed <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening with the Dean) Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> and I were for going Home, but the Dean told us, 
<Q REND="inline">'He gave us leave to stay to Supper;'</Q> which
from him was a sufficient Invitation. The Dean then pulled out of his Pocket,
a little Gold Runlet, in which was a Bottle-Screw, and opening a Bottle of
Wine, he decanted it off; the last Glass being muddy, he called to Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> to drink it: 
<Q REND="inline">'For, says he, I always keep some poor
Parson to drink the foul Wine for me:'</Q> Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> entering
into his Humour, thank∣ed him, and told him, 
<Q REND="inline">'He did not know the Difference, but was glad to
get a Glass at any rate:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why then, says the Dean, you shan't, for I'll
drink it my∣self: Why, P—x take you, you are wiser than a paultry
Curate, whom I asked to dine with me a few Days ago; <PB N="65" REF="72"/> for
upon my making the same Speech to him, he told me he did not understand
such Usage, and so walked off without his Dinner. By the same Token, I
told the Gentleman who recommended him to me, That the Fellow was a Blockhead,
and I had done with him.'</Q></P>
<P>The Dean then missing his Golden Bottle-Screw, told me, very
sternly, 
<Q REND="inline">'He was sure I had stolen it:'</Q> I affirmed,
very serious∣ly, 
<Q REND="inline">'I had not:'</Q> Upon which he looked for it, and
found it where he himself had laid it; 
<Q REND="inline">''Tis well for you, says he, that I have got it,
or I would have charged you with Theft:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, pray, Sir, should I be suspected more
than any other Per∣son in the Company?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'For a very good Reason, says he, because
you are the poorest.'</Q></P>
<P>There now came in, to sup with the Dean, one of the oddest
little Mortals I ever met with: He formerly wrote the <HI>Gazetteer</HI>; and
upon the Strength of be∣ing an Author, and of having travelled, took upon him
not only to dictate to the Company, but to contradict whatever any 
<PB N="66" REF="73"/> other Person advanced Right or Wrong, till he had
entirely silenced them all: And then having the whole Talk to himself,
(for, to my great Surprize, the Dean neither interrupted nor shewed any
Dislike of him) he told us a whole String of Improbabi∣lities, such as, 
<Q REND="inline">'That each Pillar of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at
<HI>Rome</HI> took up more Ground than a Convent which was near it, where∣in
were twelve Monks, with their Cha∣pel, Garden, and Infirmary.'</Q> By this
Account, every Pillar must take up, at least, half an Acre, and,
considering the Number of them, we must conclude the Edifice to be some
Miles in Circumference. No one present had ever been at <HI>Rome,</HI> except
himself, so that he might tell us just what he thought proper.</P>
<P>I took notice, that before this dogma∣tical Gentleman the Dean was
most re∣markably complaisant to Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> and me, and at our
going away, the Dean would hand me down all the Steps to the Coach, thanking us
for the Honour of our Company, at the same time sliding into my Hand as
much Money as Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> <PB N="67" REF="74"/> and I had given at
the Offering in the Morning, and Coach-hire also, which I durst not
refuse, lest I should have been deemed as great a Blockhead as the
Parson, who refused the thick Wine.</P>
<P>It has been a Matter of Dispute amongst the Learned, whether
<HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland</HI> had the Honour of giving to the World this
admirable Person; 'tis probable Posterity may contend this Point, as warmly
as the seven Cities of <HI>Greece</HI> did the Birth-place of <HI>Homer:</HI>
And tho' in reality, 'tis of no great Importance where a Man is born; yet as
the <HI>Irish</HI> are the eternal Ridicule of the <HI>English</HI> for
their Ignorance, I am proud <HI>Hibernia</HI> had the Happiness of producing
this brilliant Wit, to redeem the Credit of the Country; and to convince the
World, a Man may draw his first Breath there, and yet be learned, wise,
generous, religi∣ous, witty, social and polite.</P>
<P>The Account I have frequently heard the Dean give of himself,
was, that he was born in <HI>Hoey's-Alley,</HI> in <HI>Warburgh</HI>'s
Parish, <HI>Dublin</HI>; his Father was a Lawyer, and re∣turning from the
Circuit, he unfortunately <PB N="68" REF="75"/> brought home the Itch with him,
which he had got by lying in some foul Bed on the Road. Somebody advised
him to use Mercury to cure it, which Prescription cost him his Life in a
very few Days after his Return. The Dean was a posthumous Son to this
Gentleman, but, as he said, came Time enough to save his Mother's Credit.
He was given to an <HI>Irish</HI> Woman to nurse, whose Husband being
in <HI>England,</HI> and writing to her to come to him; as she could not bear
the Thoughts of parting with the Child, she very fairly took him with her,
unknown to his Mother, or any of his Relations, who could learn no Tid∣ings
either of him or her for three Years; at the End of which Time, she returned
to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and restored the Child to his Mo∣ther, from whom she
easily obtained a Par∣don, both on account of the Joy she con∣ceived at
seeing her only Son again, when she had in a manner lost all Hope of it;
as also, that it was plain, the Nurse had no other Motive for stealing
him, but pure Affection, which the Women of <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>land</HI> generally have in as eminent Degree, for 
<PB N="69" REF="76"/> the Children they nurse, as for their own Offspring.</P>
<P>I believe the Dean's early Youth did not promise that bright Day
of Wit which has since enlightened the learned World. Whilst he was at the
University of <HI>Dublin,</HI> he was so far from being distinguished
for any Superiority of Parts or Learning, that he was stopped of his Degree
as a Dunce. When I heard the Dean relate this Circum∣stance, for I set down
nothing but what I had from his own Mouth, I told him, I supposed he had
been idle; but he affirmed to the contrary; assuring me, he was real∣ly
dull, which, if true, is very surprising.</P>
<P>I have often been led to look on the World as a Garden, and the
human Minds as so many Plants, set by the Hand of the great Creator for
Utility and Ornament. Thus, some we see, early produce beauti∣ful
Blossoms, and as soon fade away; others, whose Gems are more slow in
un∣folding, but more permanent, when blown; and others again, who tho' longer
in arriving at Perfection, not only bless us then with Shade and Odour, but
also with <PB N="70" REF="77"/> delicious wholesome Fruit. To go on with the
Allegory, we often hear from Chil∣dren very bright Sallies of Wit, and
Re∣flections above their Years: From these hopeful Beginnings we are apt to
expect something very extraordinary in their Ma∣turity, but how often are we
disappointed? How often do we see these sparkling Chil∣dren dwindle
gradually into the most hum∣drum Men and Women, as if, to make use of the
Florists Phrase, the <HI>Blow</HI> was quite over; and some, whose
Childhood has given no Presages of great Talents, have improved every Year,
till they have brought forth the beautiful Flowers of Poetry and Rhetorick, and
the rich Fruits of Wisdom and Virtue.</P>
<P>Whether this Comparison will hold, I submit to the Judgment of
those who are better acquainted with the secret Workings of Nature, than I
can presume to be. I am afraid of going out of my Depth, and yet I have a
great Inclination to say a little more on this Subject.</P>
<P>I have known a Person, who in his Youth was an extraordinary
Adept in Music, and <PB N="71" REF="78"/> performed on several Instruments
extreme∣ly well. I saw the same Person some Years after; and lo! his
musical Talent was entire∣ly lost, and he was then a very good Painter. Now
I could not help forming a Notion in my own Mind, that as our Ideas depend on
the Fibres of the Brain, it was possible we might by the continual Use of
some particular one, weaken it so as to make it perish; and at the same
time, another might exert from that very Cause itself with dou∣ble
Strength. Thus, I suppose, when this Gentleman's musical Fibres
perished, his painting ones shot forth with Vigour. If there be any Truth
in this Whim of mine, which, I own, I am fond of believing my∣self, we may
easily account for the various Dispositions which we meet with, even in
the same Person at different Periods of Life.</P>
<P>But to return. Altho' it is not in my Power to give a succinct
Account of the Dean's Life, neither have I any intention to attempt it, yet I
believe I am better qualified to do it, than most of those who have
undertaken it, as they were absolute <PB N="72" REF="79"/> Strangers to him,
and relate Things upon Hearsay. The Dean, for the latter Part of his Life,
contracting his Acquaintance into a very narrow Compass, for as he was
fre∣quently deaf, he thought this Infirmity made him troublesome, and
therefore kept no Company but such as he could be so free with, as to bid
them speak loud, or repeat what they had said; it was owing to this, that
Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> and I frequently passed whole Days with him, while
Numbers of our betters were excluded; and as he was like another
<HI>Nestor,</HI> full of Days and Wis∣dom, so like him, he was pretty
much upon the Narrative, than which nothing could be more delightful to me, as
Pleasure and Instruction flowed from his Lips: 
<Q>His Words 
<L>Drew Audience, and Attention still as Night</L> 
<L>Or Summer's Noontide Air.</L><BIBL>MIL.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I remember in one of these periodica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fits of Deafness, for they returned
on cer¦tain Seasons on him, he sent for me earl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Morning; he told me when I came 
<PB N="73" REF="80"/> he had found Employment for me; so he brought to me out
of his Study a large Book, very finely bound in <HI>Turkey</HI> Lea∣ther, and
handsomely gilt; this, says he, is a Translation of the Epistles of
<HI>Horace,</HI> a Present to me from the Author, it is a spe∣cial good
Cover! But I have a Mind there should be something valuable within side
of it; so taking out his Penknife, he cut out all the Leaves close to the
inner Mar∣gin. Now, says he, I will give these what they greatly want, and
put them all into the Fire. He then brought out two Draw∣ers filled with
Letters: Your Task, Ma∣dam, is to paste in these Letters, in this Cover,
in the Order I shall give them to you; I intended to do it myself, but that
I thought it might be a pretty Amusement for a Child, so I sent for you.
I told him, I was extremely proud to be honoured with his Commands: But, Sir,
may I presume to make a Request to you, yes, says he, but ten to one I
shall deny it. I hope not, Sir, it is this; may I have leave to read the
Letters as I go on? Why, provided you will acknowledge yourself amply
re∣warded <PB N="74" REF="81"/> for your Trouble, I do not much care if I
indulge you so far; but are you sure you can read? I do not know, Sir, I
will try. Well then begin with this: It was a Letter from Lord
<HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> dated six o'Clock in the Morning; it began with a
Remark, how differently that Hour ap∣peared to him now rising cool, serene,
and temperate, to contemplate the Beauties of Nature, to what it had done in
some for∣mer Parts of his Life, when he was either in the midst of
Excesses, or returning Home sated with them; so he proceeded to
describe the numberless Advantages with which Temperance and Virtue bless
their Votaries, and the Miseries which attend a contrary Course. The
Epistle was pretty long, and the most refined Piece of moral Philosophy I
ever met with, as indeed eve∣ry one of his were, and I had the unspeak∣able
Delight of reading several of them.</P>
<P>Nor can I be at all surprized, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> should
so often celebrate a Genius, who, for Sublimity of Thought, and Ele∣gance of
Stile, had few Equals. The rest of the Dean's Correspondents were, the 
<PB N="75" REF="82"/> Lady <HI>Masham,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Atterbury,</HI> Bishop <HI>Burnet,</HI> Lord <HI>Bathurst,</HI> Mr.
<HI>Addison,</HI> Archdeacon <HI>Parnell,</HI> Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> Mr.
<HI>Pultney,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gay,</HI> Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot</HI>;
a noble and a learn∣ed Set! So my Readers may judge what a Banquet I had. I
could not avoid remark∣ing to the Dean, that notwithstanding the Friendship
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> professed for Mr. <HI>Gay,</HI> he could not forbear a
great many satirical, or, if I may be allowed to say so, envious Remarks
on the Success of the <HI>Beggar's Opera.</HI> The Dean very frankly owned,
he did not think Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was so candid to the Merits of other
Writers, as he ought to be. I then ventured to ask the Dean, whe∣ther he
thought the Lines Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> ad∣dresses him with, in the Beginning
of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> were any Compliment to him? <HI>viz.</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>O thou! whatever Title please thine Ear.</L> 
<BIBL>Dunciad.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I believe, says he, they were meant as such;
but they are very stiff;'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, <PB N="76" REF="83"/> Sir, said I, he is
so perfectly a Master of harmonious Number, that had his Heart been in the
least affected with his Subject, he must have writ better;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'How cold, how forced, are his Lines to you,
com∣pared with yours to him:'</Q> 
<Q> 
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Swift</HI>'s Libel on Lord
<HI>Carteret.</HI></NOTE>Hail happy <HI>Pope,</HI> whose generous
Mind.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here we see the masterly Poet, and the warm, sincere,
generous Friend; while he, according to the Character he gives of Mr.
<HI>Addison,</HI> damns with faint Praise.— 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, replied the Dean, I will shew you a late
Letter of his to me;'</Q> he did so; and I own I was surprized to find it
filled with low and ungentleman-like Reflections both on Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> and
the two noble Persons who honoured him with their Patronage after his
Disappointment at Court. 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, Madam, said the Dean, what do you think
of that Letter? (seeing I had gone quite through it:)—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir, re∣turned I, I am sorry I have
read it; for it gives me Reason to think there is no <PB N="77" REF="84"/>
such thing as a sincere Friend to be met with in the World.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, replied he, Authors are as jealous of their
Preroga∣tive as Kings, and can no more bear a Rival in the Empire of Wit, than
a Mo∣narch could in his Dominions.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But, Sir, said I, here is a <HI>Latin</HI>
Sentence writ in <HI>Italics,</HI> which, I suppose, means some∣thing
particular; will you be so kind to explain it?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, replied he, smiling,—I will leave
that for your Husband to do;—I will send for him to come and dine
with us, and in the mean time we will go and take a Walk in <HI>Naboth</HI>'s
Vineyard:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Where may that be, pray, Sir?'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why a Garden—I cheated one of my Neighbours
out of.'—</Q>When we entered the Garden, or rather the Field, which was
square, and inclosed with a Stone Wall, the Dean asked me how I liked it?

<Q REND="inline">'Why pray, said I, where is the Garden?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Look behind you,'</Q> said he; I did so, and
observed the South Wall was lined with Brick, and a great Num∣ber of Fruit
Trees planted against it, which being then in Blossom, looked very
beau∣tiful. <PB N="78" REF="85"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'What are you so intent on, said the
Dean?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'The opening Blooms, Sir, which brought
<HI>Waller</HI>'s Lines to my Re∣membrance:— 
<Q> 
<L>Hope waits upon the flow'ry Prime.</L></Q></Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh! replied he, you are in a poetical Vein; I
thought you had been taking Notice of my Wall, it is the best in
<HI>Ire∣land</HI>; when the Masons were building it, (as most Tradesmen
are Rogues) I watched them very close, and as often as they could, they put
in a rotten Stone, of which however, I took no Notice, till they had built
three or four Perches be∣yond it; now as I am an absolute Monarch in the
<HI>Liberties</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Liberties</HI> belonging to the
Dean.</NOTE>, and King of the Mob, my Way with them, was to have the Wall
thrown down to the Place where I observed the rotten Stone, and by doing so
five or six Times, the Workmen were at last convinced it was their
Interest to be honest;'</Q> or else, Sir, said I, your Wall 
<Q REND="inline">'would have been as tedious a Piece of 
<PB N="79" REF="86"/> Work as <HI>Penelope</HI>'s Web, if all that was done in
the Day was to be undone at Night:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, answered he, I find you have Poetry for
every Occasion; but as you cannot keep Pace with me in walk∣ing; (for indeed
I was not quite so light then, as I had been some Months before) I would
have you sit down on that little Bank, till you are rested or I tired, to
put us more upon a Par.'</Q></P>
<P>I seated myself, and away the Dean walk∣ed, or rather trolled,
as hard as ever he could drive. I could not help smiling at his odd Gait, for
I thought to myself, he had written to so much in Praise of Horses,
that he was resolved to imitate them as nearly as he could: As I was
indulging this Fancy, the Dean returned to me, and gave me a strong
Confirmation of his Par∣tiality to those Animals; 
<Q REND="inline">'I have been considering, Madam, as I walked,
said he, what a Fool Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> was to marry you, for he could
have afforded to keep a Horse for less Money than you cost him, and that,
you must confess, would have given him better Exercise and 
<PB N="80" REF="87"/> more Pleasure than a Wife:—Why you laugh, and do
not answer me—is not it Truth?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I must answer you, Sir, with another
Question; Pray how can a Batchelor judge of this Matter?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I find, said he, you are vain enough to give
yourself the Preference:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I do, Sir, to that Species here, a
<HI>Huyoniam,</HI> I would, as becomes me, give Place to: But, Sir, it is going
to rain;'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I hope not, said he, for that will cost me
Six-pence for a Coach for you, (this Garden being at some Distance from his
House) come, haste: O how the Tester trembles in my Pocket!'</Q> I
obeyed, and we got in a Doors just Time enough to escape a heavy Shower. 
<Q REND="inline">'Thank God, said the Dean, I have saved my
Money; here, you Fel∣low, (to his Servant) carry this Six-pence to the lame old
Man that sells Ginger∣bread at the Corner, because he tries to do
something, and does not beg.'</Q></P>
<P>The Dean shewed me into a little Street-Parlour, (where sat
his Housekeeper, a matron-like Gentlewoman at Work) 
<Q REND="inline">'Here, says he, Mrs. <HI>Brent,</HI> take Care
of this <PB N="81" REF="88"/> Child, meaning me) and see she does no
Mischief, while I take my Walk out within Doors:'</Q> The Deanery-House has
I know not how many Pair of Back-Stairs in it; the preceding Dean who built it
being, it seems, extremely fearful of Fire, was resolved there should be
many Ways to escape in case of Danger.</P>
<P>The Dean then ran up the Great-Stairs, down one Pair of
Back-Stairs, up another, in so violent a Manner, that I could not help
expressing my Uneasiness to the good Gentlewoman, lest he should
fall, and be hurted; she said, 
<Q REND="inline">'It was a customary Ex∣ercise with him, when
the Weather did not permit him to walk abroad.'</Q></P>
<P>I told Mrs. <HI>Brent,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">'I believed the Dean was extremely
charitable;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Ma∣dam, replied she, No body can be
more so; his Income is not above six hundred Pounds a Year, and every Year
he gives above the Half of it in private Pensions to decayed Families;
besides this, he keeps five hundred Pounds in the constant Ser∣vice of the
industrious Poor: This he lends out in five Pounds at a Time, and 
<PB N="82" REF="89"/> takes the Payment back at twelve Pence a Week; this does
them more Service, than if he gave it to them entirely, as it obliges them to
work, and at the same Time keeps up this charitable Fund for the
Assistance of many. You cannot i∣magine what Numbers of poor Tradesmen,
who have even wanted proper Tools to carry on their Work, have by this small
Loan, been put into a prosperous Way, and brought up their Families in
Credit. The Dean, added she, has found out a new Method of being charitable,
in which however, I believe, he will have but few Followers; which is, to debar
himself of what he calls the Superfluities of Life, in order to administer
to the Necessities of the Distressed; you just now saw an
In∣stance of it, the Money a Coach would have cost him, he gave to a poor
Man, unable to walk; when he dines alone, he drinks a Pint of Beer, and gives
away the Price of a Pint of Wine; and thus he acts in numberless
Instances.'</Q></P>
<P>My Reader will, I hope, do me the Jus∣tice to believe I was
quite charmed with this <PB N="83" REF="90"/> Account of the Dean's beneficent
Spirit; and I no longer wondered so many of the Clergy endeavoured to
depreciate him; for, as it is well known, there are not, in the general, a more
voluptuous Set of Men living, this Doctrine of <HI>Self-denial.</HI> was enough
to make them pour out all their Anathema's on him, and brand him with the Name
of <HI>Atheist,</HI> Unbeliever, and such like Terms, as they in their
Christian Zeal thought proper to bestow.</P>
<P>I before admired the Dean as a Person of distinguished
Genius, but now I learned to revere him as the Angel of <HI>Ireland.</HI> The
Dean running into the Parlour, threw a whole Packet of Manuscript Poems into
my Lap, and so he did for five or six Times successively, till I had
an Apron full of Wit and Novelty, (for they were all of his own Writing,) and
such as had not then been made public, and many of them, I believe, never
will. Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> coming, according to the Dean's Desire, to
Dinner, found me deeply engaged, and sat down to partake of my Entertainment,
till we were summoned to Table, to a less <PB N="84" REF="91"/> noble Part. 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> said the Dean, I
hope you are jealous; I have had your Wife a good many Hours, and as she is a
likely Girl, and I a very young Man, (<HI>Note,</HI> he was upwards of
Threescore) you do not know what may have happened: Tho' I must tell you,
you are very partial to her; for here I have not been acquainted with her above
six Months, and I have al∣ready discovered two intolerable Faults in her;
'tis true, I looked sharp, or per∣haps they might have escaped my No∣tice:
Nay, Madam, do not look sur∣prised, I am resolved to tell your
Hus∣band, that he may break you of them.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir, returned I, my Surprize is, that you
have not found out two and fifty in half that time; but let me know them, and I
will mend of them, if I can.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well put in, says he, for I be∣lieve you can't;
but eat your Dinner, however, for they are not capital.'</Q> I obeyed, yet was
very impatient to know my particular Errors; he told me, 
<Q REND="inline">'I should hear of them Time enough.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="92"/>The Things being taken away; 
<Q REND="inline">'Now, good Sir, said I, tell me what I do
amiss, that I may reform;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, returned he; but I'll tell your Husband
before your Face to shame you the more:—In the first Place, Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> she had the in∣solence this Morning, not only to
desire to read the Writings of the most cele∣brated Genius's of the Age, in
which I indulged her; but she must also, for∣sooth, pretend to praise
or censure them,' as if she knew something of the Matter; indeed her
Remarks were not much a∣miss, considering they were Guess-Work; but this
Letter here of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s she has absolutely condemned; read it,
(he did so;) take notice of it, said the Dean; she would also have had
me explain that <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence to her, but I had some Modesty,
tho' she had none you see.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, Sir, said I, sure Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>
would not (especially to you) write any thing which even a Virgin might not
read.'</Q> Now, Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">'said the Dean, is her Curiosity at work; I'll
be hang'd if she lets you sleep to∣night till you have satisfied it. But
this <PB N="86" REF="93"/> is not all; she had the Vanity to affirm, that
she thought herself preferable to a Horse, and more capable of giving you
pleasure: Nay, she laugh'd in my Face for being of a different Opinion; and
asked me how a Batchelor should know any thing of the Matter? If you don't
take down her Pride, there will be no bearing her.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir, said Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> 'tis
your Fault that she is so conceited; she was always disposed to be
saucy, but since you have done her the honour to take notice of her, and
make her your Companion, there is no such thing as mortifying her.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Very fine, said the Dean, I have got much by
complaining to you, to have all your Wife's Faults laid at my Door.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir, said I; all these Misdemeanors
may be included under the Article of <HI>Pride:</HI> Now, let me know my other
Crime:'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, said he, you can't walk fast; but at
pre∣sent, I excuse you.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir, if I can't mend my Pride, I'll try to
mend my Pace.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> said he, I 
<PB N="87" REF="94"/> 'have a mind to clip your Wife's Wit.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir, said I, that's Death by Law, for
'tis Sterling.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Shut up your Mouth, for all Day, <HI>Letty,</HI>
said Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> for that Answer is real Wit.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">Nay, 'said the Dean, I believe we had better
shut up our own, for at this rate she'll be too many for us.'</Q> I am
sure, if I was not proud before, this was enough to make me so.</P>
<P>The Dean guessed right, when he said, I would not let Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> sleep till he had explained to me the <HI>Latin</HI>
Sentence in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Letter; which, at my Request, he did. And,
indeed, none but such a wicked Wit could have contrived to turn the Words of
our blessed Saviour, so as to make them convey a very impure, as well as
a most uncharitable, Idea to the Mind.</P>
<P>Feuds ran so high between my Mother and Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI>
that my Life became very unhappy. So we determined to quit my Father's House
for a little one of our own, which my Husband's Father made us a Present
of; and which, by the Bounty of our Friends, who came a House∣warming 
<PB N="88" REF="95"/> to us, was soon elegantly fur∣nished; there was a
large Garden to it, which Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> laid out in a most beautiful
Taste, and built a delightful Sum∣mer-house in it, fit indeed for a
Nobleman; here we usually entertained our Friends; here also we both
invoked the Muse. Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> coming in Curate, (by the Remo∣val
of Dr. <HI>Owens</HI> to a Living, of whose Behaviour to me in my
Misfortunes, I shall have occasion to speak) and by having the Honour of
being Chaplain to Lady <HI>Charlemont,</HI> with an annual Allowance I had from
my Father, our Income was about one hundred Pounds a Year; so that having no
Rent to pay, and having my Father's Coach and Table always at our Command, we
could, in so cheap a Coun∣try as <HI>Ireland,</HI> live in a very decent
Man∣ner; as Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> mentions our doing in a Letter of his to Mr.
<HI>Pope,</HI> now pub∣lished amongst others.</P>
<P>The Dean came to dine with us in our <HI>Lilliputian</HI> Palace,
as he called it, and who could have thought it? He just looked into the
Parlour, and ran up into the Gar∣ret, <PB N="89" REF="96"/> then into my
Bed-chamber and Li∣brary, and from thence down to the Kit∣chen; and well it was
for me that the House was very clean; for he compli∣mented me on it, and told
me, 
<Q REND="inline">'That was his Custom; and that 'twas from the
Cleanliness of the Garret and Kitchen he judged of the good Housewifery of
the Mistress of the House; for no doubt, but a Slut would have the Rooms
clean, where the Guests were to be entertained.'</Q></P>
<P>He really was sometimes very rude, even to his Superiors, of
which the following Story, related to me by himself, may serve as one
Instance amongst a thousand others.</P>
<P>The last time he was in <HI>London,</HI> he went to dine with
the Earl of <HI>Burlington,</HI> who was then but newly married. My Lord being
willing, I suppose, to have some Di∣version, did not introduce him to
his La∣dy, nor mention his Name: 'Tis to be observed, his Gown was generally
very rusty, and his Person no way extraordinary.—After Dinner, said
the Dean, 
<Q REND="inline">'Lady <HI>Burlington,</HI> I hear you can sing;
sing me a Song.'</Q> The Lady looked on this <PB N="90" REF="97"/>
unceremonious manner of asking a Favour with Distaste, and positively
refused him. He said, she should sing, or he would make her. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, Madam, I suppose you take me for one of
your poor paul∣try <HI>English</HI> Hedge Parsons; sing, when I bid
you.'</Q> As the Earl did nothing but laugh at this Freedom, the Lady was so
vexed that she burst into Tears, and retired.</P>
<P>His first Compliment to her, when he saw her again, was, 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray, Madam, are you as proud and as ill-natured
now, as when I saw you last?'</Q> To which she an∣swered with great
good Humour,— 
<Q REND="inline">'No, Mr. Dean; I'll sing for you, if you
please.'</Q>—From which time he con∣ceived great Esteem for her. But
who that knew him would take offence at his Bluntness? It seems Queen
<HI>Caroline</HI> did not, if we may credit his own Lines, wherein he declares,
That he 
<Q> 
<L>With Princes kept a due Decorum,</L> 
<L>But never stood in Awe before 'em;</L> 
<L><PB N="91" REF="98"/>And to the present Queen, God bless
her,</L> 
<L>Would speak as free as to her Dresser;</L> 
<L>She thought it his peculiar Whim,</L> 
<L>Nor took it ill—as come from him.</L> 
<BIBL>SWIFT, on his own Death.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I cannot recollect that ever I saw the Dean laugh; perhaps he
thought it beneath him; for when any Pleasantry passed, which might have
excited it, he used to suck in his Cheeks, as Folks do when they have a
Plug of Tobacco in their Mouths, to avoid Risibility. He frequent∣ly put me
in mind of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Descrip∣tion of <HI>Cassius:</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>He is a great Discerner, and he looks</L> 
<L>Quite thro' the Deeds of Men—</L> 
<L>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</L> 
<L>As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his Spirit,</L> 
<L>That could be mov'd to smile at any thing.</L> 
<BIBL>JULIUS CAESAR.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>As the Dean, and, after his Example, Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> were
eternally satyrizing and <PB N="92" REF="99"/> ridiculing the <HI>Female</HI>
Sex; I had a very great inclination to be even with them, and expose the
Inconstancy of Men; and bor∣rowing a Hint from a Story in the
<HI>Peru∣vian</HI> Tales, I formed from it the follow∣ing Poem; and I hope it
will be acceptable to my fair Readers, as it is peculiarly ad∣dressed to
them.

<P><PB N="107" REF="114"/>I doubt not but the World will expect to
hear from me some of the Dean's A∣mours, as he has not quite escaped
Censure, on account of his Gallantries; but here I am not able to oblige my
Reader, he be∣ing too far advanced in Years, when I first had the honour of
being known to him, for Amusements of that kind. I make no doubt but he has
often been the Object of Love, and his <HI>Cadenus</HI> and
<HI>Vanessa</HI> seem to assure us, that he was the Favourite of one
Lady; but to speak my Sentiments, I really believe it was a Passion he
was whol∣ly unacquainted with, and which he would have thought it beneath the
Dignity of his Wisdom to entertain. Not that I ever imagined he was an Enemy
to the Fair; for when he found them docile, he took great pleasure to
instruct them: And if I have any Merit, as a Writer, I must gratefully
acknowledge it due to the pains he took to teach me to think and speak with
Propriety; tho', to tell the Truth, he was a very rough sort of a Tutor for
one of my Years and Sex; for whenever <PB N="108" REF="115"/> I made use of an
inelegant Phrase, I was sure of a deadly Pinch, and frequently re∣ceived
Chastisement before I knew my Crime. However I am convinced, had he thought
me incorrigibly dull, I should have escaped without Correction; and the
black and blue Favours I received at his Hands, were meant for Merit, tho'
be∣stowed on me. Yet tho', to my Shame I own it, I was fond of Admiration to
a Fault, and a little too much upon the Co∣quette, for a married Woman, I would
at any Time give up any Pleasure or Gai∣ty, for the more rationaln
Etertainment of the Dean's Conversation.</P>
<P>Five Years rolled insensibly away in a Kind of tolerable
Happiness, as Lady <HI>Town∣ly</HI> terms it; but that it seems, I was not
much longer to enjoy: However, before I begin to speak of Offence and
Trouble, I shall endeavour to enliven my Narration with all the little
amusing Incidents I can possibly recollect.</P>
<P>The following Trifle, as it was produc∣tive of a handsome Letter
to me from the Dean, and of more Honour than I could <PB N="109" REF="116"/>
possibly expect from it, my Vanity will not let me omit. My Brother teized
me one Evening to write some Verse as a School Exercise for him, I
asked him what I should write upon; Why, said he pertly, what should
you write upon but the Paper? So taking it for my Subject, I wrote the
fol∣lowing Lines. 
<Q> 
<L>O spotless Paper, fair and white!</L> 
<L>On whom, by Force, constrain'd I write,</L> 
<L>How cruel am I to destroy,</L> 
<L>Thy Purity, to please a Boy?</L> 
<L>Ungrateful I, thus to abuse</L> 
<L>The fairest Servant of the Muse.</L> 
<L>Dear Friend, to whom I oft impart,</L> 
<L>The choicest Secrets of my Heart;</L> 
<L>Ah, what Atonement can be made</L> 
<L>For spotless Innocence betray'd?</L> 
<L>How fair, how lovely didst thou shew,</L> 
<L>Like lilly'd Banks, or falling Snow!</L> 
<L>But now, alas, become my Prey,</L> 
<L>No Floods can wash thy Stains away.</L> 
<L>Yet this small Comfort I can give,</L> 
<L>That which destroy'd, shall make thee live.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="117"/>As the Lines did not suit my Brother's
Purpose, they lay carelessly on the Table, when a Lady of Distinction,
who was going to <HI>England,</HI> came to take her leave of us: She would
examine what I had been scrib∣bling, and seemed so well pleased with my
Rhymes, that she did them the Honour to put them in her Pocket-Book, and I
never thought more of them.</P>
<P>About four Years after this, making a Visit to Baron
<HI>Wainwright</HI>'s Lady, she told me, she had got a very pretty Poem
from <HI>London,</HI> wrote by the Lord Chancellor <HI>Tal∣bot</HI>'s Daughter,
a young Lady of but twelve Years of Age, and desired I would read them for
the Good of the Company; but how great was my Surprize, to find they were the
above Lines! however, I went through my Task, and Mrs. <HI>Wainwright</HI>
asked my Opinion of them, and seemed impatient at my Silence. I told her,
the young Lady must have wrote them at least four Years before, because I
had seen them so long ago. Upon which the Baron said, that he also
remembered them, and that he was told by the Person he saw them with, 
<PB N="111" REF="118"/> that they were writ by a very young Girl, who was
married to a Clergyman in <HI>Ire∣land.</HI> My smiling made them guess at
the Person, and at the same Time excused me for being not over forward to
praise them. When I returned home, I found a Letter from Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> who was in <HI>London,</HI> with a News Paper inclosed,
wherein the above Poem was printed. I related this to the Dean, who ordered me
to send the Lines to him. The next Morning a Lady came to visit me, who
told me, it being the Dean's Birth-Day, he had received a Book very richly
bound and clasped with Gold, from the Earl of <HI>Orrery,</HI> with a
handsome Poem, wrote by himself to the Dean, in the first Page, the
rest being blank; and that Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> had sent him a silver
Standish, with a complimentary Poem. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why then, said I, as the Dean is furnished
with Paper and Ink, it is the least I can do to send him a Pen;'</Q> so
having a fine Eagle's Quill, I wrapt it into the following Lines, and sent it

<P>But as I have mentioned Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s being in
<HI>London,</HI> I ought also to inform my Reader what Inducement he had to
quit his Family for a whole Year, which was as fol∣lows. Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>
had, in Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign, been the first Promoter of Alderman
<HI>Barber,</HI> who afterwards by many lucky Ac∣cidents rose to be Lord
Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> which Station he filled with distinguished
Abilities, and retained so grateful a Sense of the Dean's Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ur to him, that he made him the
Compliment of nominating a Chap∣lain to him; the Dean offered this Honour to
Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> who gladly accepted of <PB N="115" REF="122"/> it, and
came home in high Spirits to ac∣quaint me with his Preferment; but what∣ever
Joy it brought to him, I was quite sunk in Sorrow at the Thoughts of parting
for so long a Time with one I so dearly loved. All his Friends were
against his going; and the late Primate Dr. <HI>Hoadly,</HI> then
Archbishop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> remonstrated to him, that serving under a
Person so re∣markably disaffected as the Alderman, might very probably
prejudice him in the Eyes of the Government; but all in vain. Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> was ever rash, obstinate, and self-willed; and
should I add treacherous, cruel, and ungrateful, I should not wrong the
Truth; but however unwilling I am to speak harshly of the Husband of my
Youth, and the Father of my Children, I must draw his Character, wherein I
will 
<Q> 
<L>—Nothing extenuate,</L> 
<L>Nor set down aught in
Malice.</L><BIBL>Othello.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>That he is both a Scholar, and a Man of Genius, all who know him
must allow; but like Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> he is so plagued with Envy, 
<PB N="116" REF="123"/> that he even hated me because I could write, and took
an invincible Aversion to Coun∣sellor <HI>Smith,</HI> because he excelled
him on the Harpsichord. It happened one Evening that this Gentleman sung
and played to us the Oratorio of Queen <HI>Esther</HI>; unfortunate∣ly for me
I was so charmed with it, that at the Conclusion of the Music I wrote the
following Lines. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To <HI>JOHN SMITH,</HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MUSIC once more her antient Pow'r displays,</L>
<L>Resistless now, as in <HI>Timotheus</HI>' Days;</L>
<L>Our varied Passions change at thy Com∣mand</L>
<L>Our correspondent Hearts obey thy Hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who can untouch'd attend the awful Sound?</L>
<L>When swelling Notes proclaim <HI>Jehovah</HI>
crown'd.</L>
<L>Borne on the hallow'd Strains our Souls arise,</L>
<L>Till Heav'n seems present to our ravish'd Eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="117" REF="124"/>
<L>When to its Source thy Soul shall wing its Flight,</L>
<L>And with eternal Harmony unite,</L>
<L>Thy skilful Hand shall heav'nly Joys im∣prove,</L>
<L>And add new Rapture to the Bliss above.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>As the Lines were wrote off-hand, as, to say the Truth, every
Thing of mine is, for I am too volatile to revise or correct any thing I
write, Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> complimented Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> on having a Wife
who could write better than himself, he supposing Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>
to be so much the Lover, that he would be delighted with my Praise, and
join in it. But, lack-a-day! he little knew what I was to suffer for the
Superiority of Genius he was pleased to ascribe to me. I then was
continually told with a contemp∣tuous jibing Air, O my Dear! a Lady of your
Accomplishments! why Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> says you write better than I; and
to be sure he is a great Judge! But another unlucky Accident likewise
happened: How fatal to me has Praise been! We supped at the 
<PB N="118" REF="125"/> Dean's, and I had been reading out, by his Command,
some of his prosaic Work; he was pleased to say I acquitted myself
so well, that I should have a Glass of his best Wine, and sent Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> to the Cellar for it. The Dean in the mean Time said to
me, 
<Q REND="inline">'I would have every Man write his own
<HI>English.</HI>'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'To be sure, Sir, said I, that would be
best.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, to be sure, Sir; you give me an Answer,
and P—x take you, I am sure you do not under∣stand my Meaning.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Very possible, Sir; but I certainly
understand my own, when I have any.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well then, what do you understand by writing
one's own <HI>Eng∣lish?</HI>'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why really, Sir, not to confine one's self to a
Set of Phrases, as some of our antient <HI>English</HI> Historians,
<HI>Camden</HI> in particular, seems to have done, but to make use of
such Words as naturally oc∣cur on the Subject.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Hush! says he, your Husband is coming; I
will put the same Question to him.'</Q> He did so; and Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> answered, 
<Q REND="inline">'To be sure a Man ought to write good
<HI>English.</HI>'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay, but his own <HI>English</HI>; I say his
own; <PB N="119" REF="126"/> what do you understand by that?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, Sir, said he, what should I
un∣derstand?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'P—x on you for a Dunce, said he; were
your Wife and you to sit for a Fellowship, I would give her one sooner
than admit you a Sizar.'</Q></P>
<P>And now my Business was compleatly done. Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> viewed me with scornful, yet with jealous Eyes. And tho' I
never presumed to vye with him for Pre∣eminence, well knowing he not only
surpas∣sed me in natural Talents, but also had the Advantage of having
those Talents im∣proved by Learning; and was sensible the Compliments I
received were rather paid to me as a Woman, in whom any thing a Degree above
Ignorance appears surpriz∣ing, than to any Merit I really possessed;
he thought proper to insult me every Mo∣ment. Indeed he did not beat me,
which some of the good-natured Ladies have brought as an Argument that he was
an ex∣cellent Husband; but how a Clergyman should strike a Wife, who
never contra∣dicted him, and who was the most remark∣ably gentle, even of her
own soft Sex, I <PB N="120" REF="127"/> know not. Besides, I had then a dear
and honoured Father to protect me. I am sure I may say with
<HI>Ophelia,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>My Violets all wither'd when he dy'd.</L></Q> Then was I left
defenceless to all the In∣juries my Husband's subtle Cruelty could
devise against open unsuspecting Innocence.</P>
<P>Another trivial Accident also offended my Husband. He was one
Winter's Eve∣ning reading <HI>Horace,</HI> and said he would engage to write
an Ode exactly in his Man∣ner; so he directly set about it. The Fan∣cy came
into my Head to write one also, though I understood not a Word of
<HI>Latin,</HI> nor knew no more of the Poet than from the <HI>English</HI>
Translations. My Lines were as follow: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>An <HI>ODE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>I Envy not the Proud their Wealth,</L>
<L>Their Equipage and State;</L>
<L>Give me but Innocence and Health,</L>
<L>I ask not to be great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="121" REF="128"/>
<L>I in this sweet Retirement find</L>
<L>A Joy unknown to Kings,</L>
<L>For Scepters to a virtuous Mind,</L>
<L>Seem vain and empty Things.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great <HI>Cincinnatus</HI> at his Plough,</L>
<L>With brighter Lustre shone,</L>
<L>Than guilty <HI>Caesar</HI> e'er cou'd shew,</L>
<L>Tho' seated on a Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tumultuous Days, and restless Nights,</L>
<L>Ambition ever knows,</L>
<L>A Stranger to the calm Delights</L>
<L>Of Study and Repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then free from Envy, Care, and Strife,</L>
<L>Keep me, ye Powers divine;</L>
<L>And pleas'd, when ye demand my Life,</L>
<L>May I that Life resign.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>As I had finished my Task first, I shewed it to Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> who, contrary to my Expectation, (for I imagined he would
be pleased) was very angry, and told me the Dean had made me mad, that the
Lines were Nonsense, and that a Needle became <PB N="122" REF="129"/> a
Woman's Hand better than a Pen and Ink. So to bring him into Temper I praised
his Ode highly, and threw my own into the Fire. And here let me seriously
advise every Lady, who has the Misfortune to be poetically turned, never to
marry a Poet, but remember <HI>Swift</HI>'s Lines: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>What Poet wou'd not grieve to see</L>
<L>His Friends cou'd write as well as he;</L>
<L>And rather than be thus out-done,</L>
<L>He'd hang them every Mother's Son.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Her End when Emulation misses,</L>
<L>She turns to Envy, Stings and Hisses;</L>
<L>The strongest Friendship yields to Pride,</L>
<L>Unless the Odds be on our Side.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>And if a Man cannot bear his Friend should write, much less
can he endure it in his Wife; it seems to set them too much upon a Level
with their Lords and Masters; and this I take to be the true Reason why
even Men of Sense discountenance Learning in Women, and commonly chuse
for Mates the most illiterate and stupid of the Sex; and 
<PB N="123" REF="130"/> then bless their Stars their Wife is not a Wit.</P>
<P>But if a Remark be true, which I have somewhere read, that <HI>a
foolish Woman never brought forth a wise Son,</HI> I think the Gentle∣men
should have some Regard to the Intel∣lects of those they espouse.</P>
<P>But to return from this long tho' necessa∣ry Digression,
and take things a little more in their Order. Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> contrary
to every body's Advice, who had any Re∣gard for him, went for <HI>England.</HI>
I was very desirous of going with him; but he told me plainly he did not want
such an In∣cumbrance as a Wife, and that he did not intend to pass there
for a married Man; and that in short he could not taste any Pleasure
where I was. As this was a Secret I did not know before, I received it with
Asto∣nishment; for amidst all his <HI>wayward Moods,</HI> I ever imagined
till then that he loved me, and that the many ill natured Speeches he made me
were rather the Effect of a bad Temper, than any settled Aversion he had
taken against me; especially as I observed he treated every body with
Con∣tempt, <PB N="124" REF="131"/> even Persons every Way superior to him
(the Dean alone excepted, to whom he paid even a servile Complaisance.) And
tho' he now fairly plucked off the Mask, and let me see my Mistake, I
could hardly give him Credit; so unwilling are we to believe Truth, when it
runs counter to our Wishes.</P>
<P>The next Day he went on board the Yacht in Company with Mr.
<HI>Edward Walpole,</HI> to whom he was recommended by a Man of Quality since
dead, and left me and my three Children almost without an Adieu: So eagerly
did he seek his own Destruction.</P>
<P>I am hardly able to describe the various Emotions with which my
Heart was agitated on his Departure. Love, Grief, and Re∣sentment for his
last Speech, by Turns possessed it. However, I received a very kind
Letter from him from <HI>Chester,</HI> which made me a little easy; and as
my Friends seldom permitted me to be alone, I did not give much way to
Melancholy.</P>
<P>I believe it will be expected from the general Reflections I have
thrown out a∣gainst the Clergy, that I should descend to 
<PB N="125" REF="132"/> Particulars, and expose by Name the Guilty; but this
invidious Task I must decline: Be∣sides, as <HI>Angelo</HI> says in
<HI>Measure for Mea∣sure,</HI> when he is tempting a Virgin, and she
threatens to expose him; 
<Q> 
<L>Who will believe thee, <HI>Isabel?</HI></L> 
<L>My unsoil'd Name, th' Austereness of my Life,</L> 
<L>My Interest in the State, may vouch against you,</L> 
<L>That you shall stifle in your own Report,</L> 
<L>And smell of Calumny.</L></Q> Besides, I should arm a
formidable Body against me, who would not fail, sooner or later, to take
ample Vengeance. <HI>As unfor∣giving as a Churchman,</HI> is become
prover∣bial; so, as I am a Sort of a Priestess, I will, like a faithful
Mother-Confessor, keep the Secrets of my ghostly Brethren.</P>
<P>I have another Inducement to Silence, not I must own quite so
good-natured, which is, that I have a malignant Pleasure in keeping those
in Awe, who awe all the World beside, which I should lose the Mo∣ment 
<PB N="126" REF="133"/> I had done my worst. I remember a certain Gentleman,
who happening to be guilty of a venial Transgression with a mean Woman,
it unluckily manifested itself: The Gentleman was young, and had a very
severe Father, who gave him but a scanty Allowance, all of which did not
satisfy the mercenary Wretch of a Woman, who hop∣ing to gain more, went and
told her Story to his Father; the Consequence of which was, that she never
afterwards had a Shil∣ling from either. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>The dullest Genius cannot fail,</L>
<L>To take the Moral of the Tale.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>So let the stricken Deer go weep,</L>
<L>The Hart ungall'd go play.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The Innocent cannot take Offence, and for the Guilty, I will for
the present with the charitable Ghost in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>Leave them to Heav'n,</L> 
<L>And to the Thorn that in their Bosoms lodge,</L> 
<L>To prick and goad them there.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="134"/>But once more to gather up my Clue. I
received so passionately tender a Letter from <HI>London</HI> from Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> that I quite forgot all his Unkindness; and sit∣ting
down to answer it, without the least Intention of Rhyming, the following
Lines flowed from my Pen: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>These Lines, dear Partner of my Life,</L>
<L>Come from a tender faithful Wife;</L>
<L>Happy, when you her Thoughts approve,</L>
<L>Supremely happy in your Love:</L>
<L>O may the blissful Flame endure!</L>
<L>Uninjur'd, lasting, bright, and pure.</L>
<L>Thus far in Verse, but can the Muse</L>
<L>Descend so low as telling News?</L>
<L>Or can I easily in Rhime</L>
<L>Inform you how I pass my Time?</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>To sooth my Woe, and banish Care,</L>
<L>I to the Theatre repair,</L>
<L>Where, charm'd with <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s lofty
Scenes,</L>
<L>And pure inimitable Strains,</L>
<L><PB N="128" REF="135"/>My Rapture rais'd so high
appears,</L>
<L>It seeks to hide itself in Tears.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> last all Day I stray'd</L>
<L>In <HI>Delville</HI>'s sweet inspiring Shade;</L>
<L>There all was easy, gay, polite,</L>
<L>The Weather and the Guests were bright:</L>
<L>My lov'd <HI>Constantia</HI> there appear'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Southern</HI> long for Wit rever'd,</L>

<L>'Tis thus your Absence I beguile,</L>
<L>And try to make Misfortune smile;</L>
<L>But never can my constant Mind</L>
<L>A real Pleasure hope or find,</L>

<L>My <HI>Colin</HI> to my Eyes restore.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<HEAD>P. S.</HEAD>
<L>Permit me here e'er I conclude</L>
<L>To pay a Debt of Gratitude;</L>
<L>To <HI>Worsdale,</HI> your ingenious Friend,</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>The Dean had given Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> Let∣ters of
Recommendation to several eminent Persons in <HI>England,</HI> and
amongst the rest, one to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>; who, no sooner received it,
but he invited Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> to pass a Fortnight with him at
<HI>Twickenham,</HI> he not being yet entered on his Office of Chaplain. I
received from him from thence a Letter filled with Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s
Praises, and the ex∣traordinary Regard he shewed him, intro∣ducing him to
several Noblemen, and even oppressing him with Civilities, which he
modestly attributed to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Respect for the Dean, and
handsomely acknowledg∣ed the Obligation. As I thought this a very proper
Letter to communicate, I went directly with it to the Deanery. The Dean read it
over with a fix'd Attention, and re∣turning it to me, he told me, he had, by
the same Pacquet, received a Letter from Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> which, with
somewhat of a stern Brow, he put into my Hand, and walked 
<PB N="130" REF="137"/> out into the Garden. I was so startled at his
Austerity, that I was for some Minutes unable to open it, and when I did,
the Con∣tents greatly astonished me. The Substance of it was, that he
had, in pure Complai∣sance to the Dean, entertained Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>;
but that he was surprised he should be so mistaken, to recommend him
as a modest ingenious Man, who was a most forward, shallow, conceited
Fellow: That in the Hope of having an agreeable Companion, he had invited him
to pass a Fortnight with him, which he heartily repented, being sick of his
Impertinence, before the End of the third Day; and a great deal more, much to
the same Purpose. By the time I had read it thro', the Dean returned, and
asked me, what I thought of it? I told him, I was sure Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> did not deserve the Character Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> had given
of him; and that he was highly ungenerous to caress and abuse him at the
same time. Upon this the Dean lost all Patience, and flew into such a
Rage, that he quite terrified me; he asked me, Why I did not swear that my
Husband was six Foot high? And, Did I <PB N="131" REF="138"/> think myself
a better Judge than Mr. <HI>Pope?</HI> or, Did I presume to give him the Lie?
and a thousand other Extravagancies. As I durst not venture to speak a
Word more, my Heart swelled so that I burst into Tears, which, he
attributing to Pride and Resent∣ment, made him, if possible, ten times
more angry, and I am not sure he would not have beat me; but that,
fortunately for me, a Gentleman came to visit him. As I was in a violent
Passion of Tears, the Dean did not bring him into the Room where I was, but
went to receive him in another, and I gladly laid hold of that opportunity of
making my escape from his Wrath.</P>
<P>The next Morning early I wrote him a Letter, expressive of the
Anxiety I was un∣der, lest I had any way offended him; and assured him,
which was Truth, my Tears did not flow from Pride, but from the Ap∣prehension
I had, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> might in∣fluence him to withdraw his Favour from
us. I added on my own Part, that even if I was partial to Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> I hoped it was the most pardonable Error a Wife could be
guilty of; and concluded with begging, if <PB N="132" REF="139"/> he had any
Regard for my Peace, he would honour me with an Answer. By the Re∣turn of the
Messenger I received the fol∣lowing Lines: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU must shake off the Leavings of your Sex. If you cannot
keep a Secret, and take a Chiding, you will quick∣ly be out of my Sphere.
Corrigible Peo∣ple are to be chid; those who are other∣wise, may be very
safe from any Lectures of mine: I should rather chuse to indulge them in
their Follies, than attempt to set them right. I desire you may not inform
your Husband of what has passed, for a Reason I shall give you when I
see you, which may be this Evening, if you will, I am very sincerely,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Friend, J. SWIFT.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="140"/>Accordingly I waited on the Dean about five
o'Clock in the Evening, an Hour I knew he would be free from Company. He
received me with great Kindness, and told me, he would write a Letter of
Ad∣vice to Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>; 
<Q REND="inline">'But, said he, should you acquaint him with
this Letter of <HI>Pope</HI>'s, he might, perhaps, resent it to him, and make
him an Enemy.'</Q> How kind! how considerate was this! The Dean then shewed
me the Poem he wrote on his own Death; when I came to that Part of it, 
<Q> 
<L>Behold the fatal Day arrive!</L> 
<L>How is the Dean? He's just alive.</L></Q> I was so
sensibly affected, that my Eyes filled with Tears: The Dean observing it,
said, 
<Q REND="inline">'Phoo, I am not dead yet—but you shall not
read any more now.'</Q> I then earnestly requested he would let me take it
home with me, which he did on certain Conditions, which were, that I should
neither shew it to any body, nor copy it, and that I should send it to
him <PB N="134" REF="141"/> by Eight o'Clock the next Morning; all which I
punctually performed.</P>
<P>But the Dean did not know what sort of a Memory I had, when he
intrusted me with his Verse: I had no occasion for any other Copy, than
what I had registred in the <HI>Book and Volume of my Brain:</HI> I could
repeat the whole Poem, and could not forbear delighting some particular
Friends with a Rehearsal of it. This reached the Dean's Ear, who imagined I
plaid him false, and sent for me to come to him. When I entered, he told
me, I had broke my Word with him, and consequently for∣feited all the good
Opinion he had ever conceived of me. I looked, as I think he generally made me
do, like a Fool; I asked what I had done? He told me, I had copied his Poem,
and shewn it round the Town. I assured him, I had not. He said I lyed,
and produced a Poem some∣thing like it, published in <HI>London,</HI> and
told me, from reading it about, that odd Bur∣lesque on it had taken rise.
He bade me read it, aloud. I did so, and could not forbear laughing, as I
plainly perceived, <PB N="135" REF="142" MS="y"/> tho' he had endeavoured to
disguise his Stile, that the Dean had burlesqued himself; and made no
manner of scruple to tell him so. He pretended to be very angry, asked
me, did I ever know him write Triplets? and told me, I had neither Taste nor
Judgment, and knew no more of Poetry than a Horse. I told him I would
confess it, provided he would seriously give me his Word, he did not
write that Poem. He said, P—x take me for a Dunce. I then assured
him, I did not copy his Poem; but added, when I read any thing peculiar∣ly
charming, I never forgot it; and that I could repeat not only all his Works,
but all <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s, which I put to this Trial; I desired him to
open any Part of it, and read a Line, and I would engage to go on with the
whole Speech; as we were in his Library, he directly made the Experiment: The
Line he first gave me, he had pur∣posely picked out for its singular
Oddness: 
<Q> 
<L>But rancours in the Vessel of my Peace.</L> 
<BIBL>Macbeth.</BIBL></Q> <PB N="136" REF="143"/> I readily went
on with the whole Speech, and did so several times, that he tried me with
different Plays. The Dean then took down <HI>Hudibras,</HI> and ordered me to
examine him in it, as he had done me in <HI>Shakespear</HI>; and, to my great
Surprize, I found he re∣membered every Line, from Beginning to End of it. I
say, it surprized me, because I had been misled by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s
Remark, 
<Q> 
<L>That where Beams of warm Imagination play,</L> 
<L>The Memory's soft Figures melt away.</L> 
<BIBL>Essay on Criticism.</BIBL></Q> To think Wit and
Memory incompatible things. I told the Dean he had convinced me the old Proverb
was false; and, indeed, I know not how any Person can be witty without a
good Memory. When I returned home, I found I had not been mistaken in the
Opinion I had conceived, that the Dean had burlesqued his own Poem. I had a
Confirmation of it in a Letter from Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> to whom he had
sent it, to have it printed in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="144"/>My Evening's Chat with the Dean fur∣nished
me with Matter of Speculation on that most amazing Faculty of the human Mind,
Memory; which, according to my usual Custom, I threw into Rhime, and hope
it will not be displeasing to my Reader. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>MEMORY, a POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN what Recesses of the Brain,</L>
<L>Does this amazing Pow'r remain,</L>
<L>By which all Knowledge we attain?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What art thou, Memory? What Tongue can tell,</L>
<L>What curious Artist trace thy hidden Cell,</L>
<L>Wherein ten thousand diff'rent Objects dwell?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Surprising Store-house! in whose narrow Womb,</L>
<L>All Things, the past, the present, and to come,</L>
<L>Find ample Space, and large and mighty Room.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
<L>O falsely deem'd the Foe of sacred Wit!</L>
<L>Thou, who the Nurse and Guardian art of it,</L>
<L>Laying it up till Season due and fit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then proud the wond'rous Treasure to produce,</L>
<L>As Understanding points it, to conduce</L>
<L>Either to Entertainment, or to Use.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor Love, nor holy Friendship, without thee,</L>
<L>Could ever of the least Duration be;</L>
<L>Nor Gratitude, nor Truth, nor Piety.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where thou art not, the chearless human Mind</L>
<L>Is one vast Void, all darksome, sad and blind;</L>
<L>No Trace of any thing remains behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sacred Stores of Learning all are thine;</L>
<L>'Tis only thou record'st the faithful Line;</L>
<L>'Tis thou mak'st Human-kind almost divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="139" REF="146"/>
<L>And when at length we quit this mortal Scene,</L>
<L>Thou still shalt with our tender Friends remain,</L>
<L>And Time and Death shall strike at thee in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lord, let me so this wond'rous Gift em∣ploy;</L>
<L>It may a Fountain be of endless Joy,</L>
<L>Which Time, nor Accident, may ne'er destroy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still let my faithful Memory impart,</L>
<L>And deep engrave it on my grateful Heart,</L>
<L>How just, and good, and excellent thou art.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>My Reader may now plainly perceive, I was most incorrigibly
devoted to Versifying, and all my Spouse's wholesome Admoni∣tions had no
manner of Effect on me: In short, I believe this scribbling Itch is an
in∣curable Disease; for tho' <HI>Horace</HI> says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Art of Poetry.</NOTE>, taking some Physic in the
Spring rid him <PB N="140" REF="147"/> of it, yet, as he even relates this in
flowing Numbers, we have no Cause to give him Credit. He also declares, all
Poets are visibly possessed, and mad. <HI>Shakespear</HI> seems
to be of the same opinion, tho' he describes it with greater Elegance than
even <HI>Horace</HI> has done, at least in the Translation. 
<Q> 
<L>The Poet's Eye, in a fine Frenzy rolling,</L> 
<L>Doth glance from Heav'n to Earth, from Earth to Heav'n;</L> 
<L>And as Imagination bodies forth</L> 
<L>The Forms of Things unknown, the Poet's Pen</L> 
<L>Turns them to Shapes, and gives to airy Nothing</L> 
<L>A local Habitation and a Name.</L></Q> The Truth of which he
has fully verified, giving us in his divine Works a new Crea∣tion of his own,
with a new Language also peculiar to the different Species and Orders of
Beings he introduces to us. <HI>Milton</HI> had, studied him with Care, and,
like the Bee, committed many sweet Thefts on his im∣mortal Blooms. Whoever
reads the Part <PB N="141" REF="148"/> of the Fairies in the <HI>Midsummer
Night's Dream,</HI> may easily perceive how many beautiful Images
<HI>Milton</HI> has borrowed thence to adorn his Masque of <HI>Comus.</HI>
And really, I think, as <HI>Shakespear</HI> had plun∣dered all Art and
Nature, the visible and invisible World, it was but just to make
Reprizals, and steal from his rich Store.</P>
<P>I hope my Reader will pardon me for so often running away from
<HI>myself</HI>; I can∣not say, I am <HI>Egotist</HI> enough to be much
enamoured of such an unhappy Theme, and have often wished I could do it in
rea∣lity; for I have been plunged in such Ca∣lamity, that I have even thought
it impos∣sible to be true, and vainly hoped to wake, as from some hideous
Dream, to find a better Fate.</P>
<P>And as one travelling in a barren Waste, could not be
displeased to be sometimes led out of the direct Road to view a more
a∣greeable Prospect, I deal thus with my Readers, and turn them from the
gloomy Vale of my Life, to relieve them with something more pleasing.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="149"/>To amuse myself,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d indeed with no other View, I
wrote, in my Husband's Ab∣sence, all the following Poems; which, if they
should not happen also to amuse my Readers, they are at their own
Liberty, and may turn them over.

<P>Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> who loved me best at a Distance, wrote
me a very kind Letter, wherein he told me my Verses were like myself, full
of Elegance and Beauty; that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> and others, whom he had shewn
them to, longed to see the Writer; and that he heartily wished me in
<HI>London.</HI> And this put the Fancy into my Head of going there; and as
some of my Acquaintance intended for it, with whom I thought I could
agreeably travel, I soon resolved to accompany them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> had been absent nine Months; a tedious
Time in a Lover's Reckoning. In three Months Time his Office expired; for every
new Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> has a new Chaplain; so I thought I should
have the Pleasure of passing the Winter in <HI>London,</HI> and then, if
nothing bet∣ter <PB N="154" REF="161"/> offered, we should return home
toge∣ther. <HI>London</HI> has very attractive Charms for most People, as our
<HI>Irish</HI> Nobility and Gentry sufficiently evidence, by spending the
greatest Part of their Time and Fortune there; and can it be wondered at,
that a young lively Woman should be fond of taking the only Opportunity she
might ever have of seeing its Magnificence in Perfec∣tion. Well! but how to
execute my Pro∣ject; for I was apprehensive if either my own Parents or Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI>'s were ac∣quainted with it, they would prevent me; so I
resolved to make but one Confidante, which was a very faithful Servant, who
in the Evening put my Portmanteau aboard the Yacht. Next Morning, the Wind
being fair, I went, under Pretence of seeing my Friends safe aboard, down
the River with them, and into the Ship as it were out of Curiosity; but being
then out of Dan∣ger of Pursuit, I told them my Intention, which some
approved of, and some blamed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
However, as I did not question a kind Re¦ception from my Husband, and knew
my Children would be well taken care of by m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <PB N="155" REF="162"/> Parents, I was very chearful and easy, and
little regarded what was thought of my Frolick; neither could I divine that any
evil Construction would be put upon it.</P>
<P>We had a very safe Passage, and a plea∣sant Journey. I
wrote to Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> from <HI>Parkgate,</HI> and he and Mr.
<HI>W—e</HI> met me about four Miles Distance from <HI>London.</HI> So
I took leave of my Fellow-Travellers for the present, and went into the Coach
to them, which drove to Mr. <HI>W—le</HI>'s. Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>
received me very obligingly, and called me his little Fu∣gitive and Run-away;
but a Stranger would have thought Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> was my Hus∣band, he
welcomed me so kindly, and paid me so many Compliments. As I had been up at
three o'Clock in the Morning, I was heartily fatigued, and desired Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> to take leave; but he whispered me to in∣vite Mr.
<HI>W—le</HI> home to Supper with us, which accordingly I did; and he was
so transported with this Civility, he could not conceal his Joy; whatever I
commended amongst his Paintings, he would force me to accept of; and putting
as many Bottles <PB N="156" REF="163"/> of Wine into the Coach-Box as it would
conveniently hold, we went to Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Lodging, which I found
very handsome and convenient. Wine and good Chear enter∣tained us till
Midnight to our mutual Satis∣factions.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> and I were alone, he told me, that
tho' he was very glad to see me, he was afraid I would have but a lonely Time
of it in <HI>London,</HI> he being ob∣liged to attend on the Lord Mayor, from
Nine in the Morning till Six in the Eve∣ning, and from thence he always went to
the Play, and afterwards to Supper to Mrs. <HI>Heron,</HI> one of the
Actresses, of no very good Fame. Though I thought this but an odd Manner of
Life for a Clergyman, I did not say so, being unwilling to offend him. I
had heard it whispered, that he liked this Woman, but I resolved patient∣ly
to wait the Event.</P>
<P>The next Day, when he was going out, I put him in Mind that Mr.
<HI>W—le</HI> said he would pass the Evening with us; but he laughed
at my believing it; and said he was a Man so uncertain in his Temper, that
per∣haps <PB N="157" REF="164"/> I might never see him again while I lived.
Just then a Lady who came over with me, called on us; and Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> and she had some private Chat. When she was gone he
told me, she had brought him a Letter and some Poetry from the Dean, which
he had ordered him to dispose of, and put the Money in his own Pocket; as
he could not stay to read them, he took them with him to the Lord
Mayor's.</P>
<P>However, Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> was mistaken in imagining Mr.
<HI>W—le</HI> would fail in his Appointment; he came and told me Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> was at the Play, but would sup with us. He made use of
his Absence to compliment me at an unmerciful Rate, and sung me all the
tenderest Love Songs he could think of in the most pathetic Manner: In
short, he exerted his Talents to entertain me, and behaved himself so
much in the Stile of a Lover, that had I not been married, I should have
imagined, he intended to address me. When Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> returned, he
told him, he was certainly the happiest Man living, and won∣dered how he
could be a Moment out of <PB N="158" REF="165"/> my Company, where he could
stay for ever. Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> seemed much pleased with his
Gallantry, and said, he hoped I would induce him to see us often. When we
were alone, he told me, he believed his Friend was in love with me. I
answered, if he thought so, I wondered he gave him so warm an Invitation.
He said, he was a very generous Man, and that his liking to me, if well
managed, might prove very profitable; for he valued no Expence where a Lady was
in the Case. So, it seems, I was to be the Bait, wherewith he was to angle
for Gold out of a Rival's Pocket: A Scheme which had a twofold Prospect of
Gain annexed to it; for while a Lover has Hope, he seldom quits the Chace;
and will even thank the Husband, for taking the friendly Freedom of using
his Purse; and yet should the Gallant be detected in taking any friendly
Freedoms with the Wife in return, the Law is all against him, Da∣mages and
Imprisonment must ensue. Which Consideration may serve as a Warn∣ing
to all Men, not to invade Properties, or commit wilful Trespass on their
Neigh∣bour's Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="166"/>If my Readers are by this Time the least
acquainted with my Spirit, they may judge, I looked on this Project with the
Contempt it deserved; however I promised Complaisance, which indeed Mr.
<HI>W—le</HI>'s seeming Merits might well deserve. The next Day I was
invited to the Lord Mayor's, who, on account of the resolute Opposition he
had given to the Excise Act, was the Darling of the People. He was but
indiffe∣rent as to his Person, or rather homely than otherwise; but he had
an excellent Under∣standing, and the Liveliness of his Genius shone in
his Eyes, which were very black and sparkling. He always treated me with
great Complaisance, and gave me a general Invitation to his Table. As the
Lord Mayor was a Batchelor, he had a Gentle∣woman who managed his Houshold
Af∣fairs, and who, except on public Days, did the Honours of his Table. Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> told me she was violently in love with him, and was ready
to run mad upon hearing I was come to <HI>London.</HI> How true this might be I
know not; but as she was very civil to me, and was old enough to 
<PB N="160" REF="167"/> be my Mother, I was not the least disturb∣ed with
Jealousy on her own Account; tho' I can't help saying, she gave me a
great deal of Uneasiness, by relating to me many Instances of my
Husband's extraor∣dinary Regard for the Player afore-men∣tioned: We went
together to the Play on Purpose to see her; and to do her Justice, she
was a graceful, fine Woman; at least she appeared such on the Stage, and
had a peculiar Skill in dressing to Advantage. Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> and
Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> were at the Play; they met us going out, and Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> committed me to the Care of his Friend, who had a Coach
waiting to convey me home; but Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> went to his old
Rendezvous to the Actress, to my very great Mortification; because I really
preferred his Conversation to any other in the World: However, he was so
com∣plaisant, he used every Evening to send Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> to
keep me Company, while he pursued his Pleasures; and, as I shall
an∣swer it to Heaven, he did every thing in his power to forward and
encourage an Amour between his Friend and me.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="168"/>One Instance, out of an hundred I could
produce, I submit to the impartial Judgment of my Reader. One of the young
Ladies, at whose House I first saw Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> happening to
be in <HI>London,</HI> and but in low Circumstances, came to visit me;
she in∣sisted on my passing the next Evening with her, and just as
I was going Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> came in, and offered to accompany me, to
which I gladly consented, hoping as he was then a Man of Interest, he might
recom∣mend her to some good Family, as a Go∣verness to Children, or a
Lady's Woman, when he knew how well qualified she was for either Place. As
her Spirit was far a∣bove her Ability, I was concerned to see what Expence
she had put herself to for my Reception, having provided a very genteel
Supper, to which she would oblige us to stay. While she was giving Orders
for it, I informed Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> of her Distress, who immediately
gave me a Gui∣nea for her, but entreated I would give it to her as Present
from my self, which, as I knew it was the only Method to make her accept of
it, I did.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="169"/>When I came home, I related to Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> Mr. <HI>W—le</HI>'s obliging and ge∣nerous Behaviour;
but little was he pleased with the Recital: What could I think of him, when
he told me, I did very ill to in∣troduce a new Woman to him, <HI>i. e.</HI> Mr.
<HI>W—le</HI>; and that he hoped I would lose him; and that henceforth
he would bestow his Favours on her? A Speech more pro∣per for the Mouth of
one of those aban∣doned Wretches, who live by the Sale of the Innocent, than
for a Husband, a Gen∣tleman, and one who ought to be a Chris∣tian. But I
believe he was of Opinion that 
<Q> 
<L>Let the malicious World say what it please,</L> 
<L>The fair Wife makes her Husband live at ease.</L></Q> And,
provided he sold me well, and <HI>put Money in his Purse,</HI> little
regarded either my temporal or eternal Happiness.</P>
<P>Another Instance either of his extraor∣dinary Confidence in my
Fidelity to him, or rather Indifference about it, was, that 
<PB N="163" REF="170"/> he obliged me to go alone with his Friend to
<HI>Windsor,</HI> though, as it was Winter, there was no Possibility of
going there and returning the same Day, it being twenty Miles distant from
<HI>London</HI>; so that we had not only two Days, but a Night also, to
pass together. Could any Husband be more obliging to his Rival, than to
give him such an Opportunity to accomplish his Wishes? Had mine but
concurred, I had then been undone; for truly the Gentleman tried eve∣ry
Argument to win me to them, but in vain. My Husband's Misconduct in
expos∣ing me to such Temptation, stung me to the Quick; nay, I could not
help believ∣ing they were both in a Plot to betray me to Ruin; and as we were
at the top Inn in the Town, I started at every Noise of Horsemen who
stopped there; and con∣cluded, though falsly I believe, that Mr.
<HI>W—le</HI> had given Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> a Di∣rection where to find
us; and as this Ima∣ginatlion wholly possessed me, I little re∣garded
either the Elegance of our Enter∣tainment, or the Tenderness and Passion
the Gentleman expressed in every Word <PB N="164" REF="171"/> and Look: His
soft Endearments were all lost on one who regarded him as an Enemy. I was
obstinately sullen, and pretended Wea∣riness, on purpose to quit his
Company; but I lost all Patience, when calling to the Maid to shew me to my
Chamber, I found there was but one, nay, and but one Bed too, provided for two
Guests; for, it seems, my Gentleman had so ordered it, hoping, no doubt,
to supply my Husband's Place.</P>
<P>I was now in a manner convinced, there was Treachery intended
against me, and re∣proached my desiring Swain in such bitter Terms, that
he had no Way to prove his Innocence, but by retiring, tho' very re∣luctantly,
to another Apartment; and I took special Care to barricade my own, not only
double-locking it, but also placing all the Chairs and Tables against the
Door to prevent a Possibility of being surprized.</P>
<P>I rose very early next Morning to take a Survey of what
Curiosities <HI>Windsor</HI> afforded, as it was too late the Night before
to see any thing; but found nothing worth Ob∣servation, except the
Castle, whose emi∣nent Situation and <HI>Gothick</HI> Grandeur, might 
<PB N="165" REF="172"/> very well, some Ages ago, make it es∣teemed a
<HI>Non-pareil:</HI> But as it has frequent∣ly been described and celebrated,
I shall only say, that considering it as the Palace of the
<HI>Edwards</HI> and <HI>Henrys,</HI> I was touched with something like a
religious Veneration for it, which no modern Building could inspire me
with.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> attended me with great Respect, and
excepting that he tenderly re∣proached me with what he called my Cruel∣ty the
Night before, gave me no farther Cause of Displeasure, but brought me
safely home in his Chaise to Mr. <HI>P—n.</HI></P>
<P>But pray, gentle Reader, suppose it had happened otherwise;
that Night-Solitude, an agreeable and importunate Lover, should have
prevailed on human, yielding Frailty, whom could my Husband so properly
have blamed for it as himself? He who best knew our Frames, bids us avoid
Tempta∣tion, as the surest Method, nay and per∣haps the only one of
avoiding Sin; for who so firm that may not be seduced? Why then should
he, Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> drive me <PB N="166" REF="173"/> into the Toils,
unless he meant to have me made a Prey of?</P>
<P>I fairly confess this Action greatly sunk him in my Esteem;
nay, it even did the same in Mr. <HI>W—le</HI>'s, especially as he
reaped no Satisfaction by it. I could scarce∣ly after regard Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> as a Hus∣band; but rather as a Man whose Proper∣ty I
was, and who would gladly dispose of me to the best Bidder. Shocking
Thought!</P>
<P>And yet this Scheme was so artfully ma∣naged, as indeed all his
against me have ever been, that I could not well reproach him for it; for he
would have alledged, it was a Party of Pleasure intended by him for my Health
and Recreation; and to have mentioned Mr. <HI>W—le</HI>'s Attempt, why,
to say the Truth, I looked upon it as a Thing which any Man in the same
Circumstances might naturally be guilty of, even tho' he had no previous
liking to, or Thought of the Woman. So, as there was no Harm done, I judged it
most prudent to be silent. Besides, no Faults are so ea∣sily pardoned
by our Sex, as those we be∣lieve to be occasioned by our own Charms, 
<PB N="167" REF="174"/> the eager Lover's constant Excuse, and which our
Vanity is but too apt to admit as a reasonable one.</P>
<P>Of all Things in Nature, I most wonder why Men should be
severe in their Censures on our Sex, for a Failure in Point of Chasti∣ty:
Is it not monstrous, that our Seducers should be our Accusers? Will they
not em∣ploy Fraud, nay, often Force to gain us? What various Arts, what
Stratagems, what Wiles will they use for our Destruction? but that once
accomplished, every oppro∣brious Term with which our Language so
plentifully abounds, shall be bestowed on us, even by the very Villains who
have wronged us. 
<Q> 
<L>O Heav'n that such Companions thou'dst unfold!</L> 
<L>And put a Whip in ev'ry honest Hand,</L> 
<L>To lash such Rascals, naked thro' the World,</L> 
<L>Even from the East to the West.—</L></Q> I am sure
the whole Female Sex will join with me in a hearty <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="175"/>Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Year of
Chaplainship being near expired, I hoped that he would return to <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eland</HI>; but he had entertained a
Belief that Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> would provide for him, and therefore
determined to stay in <HI>London,</HI> so I was forced to return single;
for as Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Income ceased with his Office, he chose to
accept of an Offer from Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> to lodge in his House. For
several Reasons I thought it most pro∣per to revisit my native Country;
the first and chief was the Affection I bore to my dear little ones; the
next, to avoid both the Temptation and Scandal I must have suffered, by
going into the House of a Person, who, with regard to Women, had an
avowedly dissolute Character.</P>
<P>But however cautiously and prudently I acted in this Affair, it
was not my good Fortune to escape Calumny; so far from it, that I was both
traduced for going to <HI>London,</HI> and for returning from it; and the Wife
of a certain B—, who invited me to dine with her a Day or two after my
Return to <HI>Dublin,</HI> when we retired to our Tea, abused me in Language
I should have <PB N="169" REF="176"/> scorned, in respect to my own
Gentility, to have given to the meanest Servant I was ever Mistress of:
And because my Hus∣band had made me a Present of a few little Trinkets,
all of which in the Expence amounted but to a Trifle, told me she was sure
some Gallant had given them to me. But, as I have since been informed,
she was ragingly jealous of me, although without any Reason, I can the more
readi∣ly pardon her inhuman Treatment of me.</P>
<P>But as I did not chuse to bear Re∣proaches I did not deserve,
I sent for a Chair, and, bursting into Tears, left the Room. In the Hall I
met the B—, who was coming to drink Tea with the Ladies: He was
surprized to see me so disordered, and tenderly laying hold of me,
enquired the Cause. I desired he would ask his Lady, who had invited me,
to use me ill: Which he said, he hoped she would not do, even in Regard
to my Condition (being then pregnant). But, Heaven knows! had he but
considered how cruel all barren Creatures naturally are, insomuch that I
have seen a barren Ewe <PB N="170" REF="177"/> attempt to kill a young Lamb;
he would rationally have judged what might have, even in Law, been my
Protection, was the very Cause of her Hatred and Displeasure to me.</P>
<P>However, as this Lady was the first to attack my Character, I
can do no less than return her these my public and grateful
Acknowledgments; for though perhaps half the World cannot tell whom I mean; yet
as it is more than probable the Person concerned may read over these
Memoirs, she at least will know her own Portrait.</P>
<P>'Tis really a sad Misfortune, that the honest Liberty of the
Press is so suppressed in <HI>Ireland:</HI> But, however, I promise
all my Subscribe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to oblige them
with a Key to whatever Secrets I have been obliged to lock up; and many I have
been obliged to strike out of my Work, otherwise I could never have had a
single Line printed.</P>
<P>Vice in Power will command at least an outward Homage; and
helpless Poverty dare not either oppose or expose it.</P>
<P>A few Days after my Return to <HI>Ireland,</HI> Sir <HI>Daniel
Molineux</HI> said in <HI>French</HI> to my <PB N="171" REF="178"/> Brother in
St. <HI>Ann</HI>'s Church, that he was surprised to see me look so
chearful, consi∣dering my Husband was in the <HI>Bastile.</HI> My Bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her told it to me; but for my Life I
could not guess what the Gentleman meant.</P>
<P>But too soon I was informed by the News-Papers, that Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> Mr. <HI>Motte,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gilliver,</HI> were all
taken up on account of some treasonable Poetry, which Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> had given to the two latter to print; I then recollected the
Papers afore∣mentioned, delivered to him by one of my Female
Fellow-Travellers.</P>
<P>Who was the Informer I know not, both Parties having violently
accused each other; but in my Soul I believe Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> was
innocent, and I am sure I have no Rea∣son to be partial to him. But certain
it is, his Character suffered so much that it al∣most broke my Heart, as
it deprived me of any Hopes even of his having Bread for his Family. The Notion
of his having betrayed Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> incensed the whole Kingdom of
<HI>Ireland</HI> against him; and as I did not for many Weeks receive a
Letter from him, I knew not how to justify him; <PB N="172" REF="179"/> and
when called upon by the late Primate (Dr. <HI>Hoadly</HI>) to give him an
Account of the Affair, I could only answer him with Tears, which, as both he
and his Lady were exceedingly humane, pleaded his Cause as powerfully as the
most moving Eloquence could have done; his Grace bade me be comforted, and
write to my Hus∣band to come over and mind his Duty, and he would still be
a Friend to him; and generously added, that as many Per∣sons busied
themselves in bringing Stories to him to Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s
Disadvantage, I should be welcome to his Table every Day, which would
discountenance those who endeavoured to prejudice him, when they saw it
did not make him or his Spouse withdraw their Regard from me.</P>
<P>His Grace's Goodness affected me so much, that my Tears of
Sorrow were converted to those of Gratitude; nor could I forbear falling on
my Knees to pay my Acknowledgments to him and his friendly Lady, for the Relief
their Kindness had given to a Heart overcome with Anguish.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="180"/>At length I received a Letter from Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> which he was obliged to in∣close to a Gentleman for me,
otherwise it would have been carried to the Castle, and there examined;
so great Notice was taken of these Poems. He wrote me word he had been ill
of the Rheumatism, and in great Trouble; that he would directly return to
<HI>Ireland,</HI> but that he had not Money to bear his Expences. I made an
Application to my Father for him, who bade me let the Fellow go to the
<HI>West-Indies,</HI> and he would take care of me and the Children. But,
unfortunately for me, I had too much Good-nature to take this wholesome
Advice; so far from it, that I never ceased importuning him, but fol∣lowed
him from Morning till Night, like <HI>Niobe</HI> all Tears, till he give me a
Bill of twenty Pounds to send to him, with which he came over to
<HI>Ireland</HI>; but so pale and dejected, that he looked like the Ghost
of his former self; and the Disregard he met with from every body went very
near his Heart. Every Day there was a new Abuse published on him; my Father
battled for <PB N="174" REF="181"/> him, and I did every thing in my power to
chear and comfort his Spirits. Com∣passion wrought now the same Effects
on me, as Love had done heretofore; and as he frequently wept, I could not
forbear mingling my Tears with his; and, by way of Consolation, wrote to him
the follow∣ing Lines. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>NO more, lov'd Partner of my Soul,</L>
<L>At Disappointments grieve,</L>
<L>Can flowing Tears our Fate control,</L>
<L>Or Sighs our Woes relieve?</L>

<L>Adversity is Virtue's School</L>
<L>To those who right discern;</L>
<L>Let us observe each painful Rule,</L>
<L>And each hard Lesson learn.</L>

<L>If fix'd the strong Foundations lie,</L>

<L>Thus fix'd on Faith's unfailing Rock,</L>
<L>Let us endure a while</L>
<L>Misfortune's rude, impetuous Shock,</L>
<L>And glory in our Toil.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Ill Fortune cannot always last,</L>
<L>Or tho' it should remain,</L>
<L>Yet we each painful Moment haste</L>
<L>A better World to gain:</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Where Calumny no more shall wound,</L>
<L>Nor faithless Friends destroy,</L>
<L>Where Innocence and Truth are crown'd</L>
<L>With never-fading Joy.</L>
</LG></Q> </P>
<P>I should not have dwelt so long on every trivial
Circumstance had I not been strangely traduced about this Affair, which, as
I shall answer it to God, I have related with the utmost Truth and
Exactness. I never had any Breach with Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> till our final
Separation; and I am sure if my Father had suspected me of any
Dis∣honour, he would sooner have joined with my Husband to prosecute
me, than have <PB N="176" REF="183"/> given him a single Shilling to make up
Matters between us.</P>
<P>Neither can I really imagine what I had done to merit all the
cruel and scandalous Aspersions thrown on me, especially by the Ladies:
It would be infinite Vanity to sup∣pose Envy had any Share in their gentle
Breasts; or that the Praises I received from the other Sex, on Account of
my Writings, awaked their Displeasure against me: For though 
<Q> 
<L>They had no Title to aspire;</L> 
<L>Yet, when I sunk, they rose the high'r.</L></Q></P>
<P>But what I think most surprising, is, that Women, who have
suffered in their own Reputations, are generally most cruel in their
Censures on others. I could men∣tion a Lady, who was so fond of a cer∣tain
Colonel, that when he died, she was almost mad, though he was a married
Man; and yet she was heedful of the main Chance, in prevailing on him to
leave her his Estate from his Wife, whose Brother's Estate she had
before secured to <PB N="177" REF="184"/> herself, he being married to her.
I re∣member this Lady the whole Town-talk of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and yet, by
having a large ill∣got Fortune, she procured a second Hus∣band, commenced
Prude, though not till Youth and Beauty were fled, and is, if she yet lives,
one of the bitterest Eenmies to any Woman, who has ever committed even an Act
of Indiscretion, that can be found in the World, as I have proved many Years
ago by woful Experience. 
<Q> 
<L>So <HI>Flavia,</HI> full of inward Guilt,</L> 
<L>Calls <HI>Florimel</HI> an arrant Jilt.</L></Q> But enough of
this. When Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> was once more settled in his Cure, I being
very much inclined to a Decay, my Father said, nothing would more effectually
re∣store my Health than the Country; so having often been invited to his
Brother's at <HI>Cork,</HI> I resolved on going there for a few Months, where
I was very kindly re∣ceived. We took the Diversions of the Season at
<HI>Mallow,</HI> where nothing remark∣able happened to me, except that one 
<PB N="178" REF="185"/> Gentleman there took it into his Head to do, what they
there call black-guard me incessantly. It was the reigning Humour of the
Place, amongst the young Folks, to call Names, sell Bargains, and
some∣times talk indecently, all of which I ab∣horred, and therefore this
Gentleman singled me out as a Mark for this Sort of Wit; and the more he
found it vexed me, the more he persisted in it. At last, I very
seriously demanded of him, what I had done to provoke him to teize me in
the manner he did? He said, he heard I was a Wit; and wished I would write
a Satire on him. So, to oblige him, I sent him the following Lines, which
obtained me a Truce from his anti-sublime Conceits.

<P>And here, gentle Reader, I must bid you take leave of the Hope
of any farther chearful Amusement; here commences the <PB N="181" REF="188"/>
mournfullest Tale which ever yet was either told or read.</P>
<P>The Winter's Return brought me to <HI>Dublin.</HI> My Husband
met me about a Mile from Town, and took me and my Aunt <HI>Van Lewen</HI>'s
Sister, who came to Town with me, out of the Stage-Coach into a Hackney one.
He entertained me with an Account of a violent Quarrel he had with my Father;
and said, he hoped, if I had any Regard for him, I would never go with
inside his Doors. This was a strange Command, and as strange did it
appear to me, that he should quarrel with the best natured Gentleman in the
World; his Father in Effect, as he treated him as his Son! I told him, I hoped
he would excuse my once disobeying him; for I owed, if possible, a
superior Duty to my Father, than a Husband could claim. Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> was very angry. This was on <HI>Thursday</HI> Night: The
next Morning, at all Hazards, I went to wait on my Father, who received me with
a Coldness, which struck me to the Heart. I asked him, if I had any way
offended him? He said, <PB N="182" REF="189"/> Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> had
used him so ill, he did not desire to see his Wife. 
<Q REND="inline">'Dear Sir (said I) am I not your Daughter?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, (said he) and had you taken my Advice in
letting the Villain go to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> I should have regarded
you as such; but, make much of him; and remember, the Hour will come, when
you will wish you had followed your Father's Counsel.'</Q> My Aunt's
Sister was with me, to whom he never once spoke, but walked to and fro in a
sort of a distracted Manner, and looked so ill, that, imagining my
Presence disturbed him, I asked him where my Mother was? He said, she
was gone to take the Air; and that he had Company to dine with him, so that
he could not ask me to stay. I took the Hint, and departed from him, in
such inconceivable Sorrow, as I never in my Life experienced before,
because I really loved him more than any thing in the World.</P>
<P>I passed the Remainder of the Day in Tears, for my Husband
never came home till Twelve o'Clock at Night; so that I <PB N="183" REF="190"/> had full Liberty to indulge my Sorrow. I sent my Compliments on
<HI>Friday</HI> and <HI>Satur∣day</HI> Morning to my Parents; they answer∣ed,
they were very well; but they neither asked me to come to them, nor came to
me.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> I was invited to Dinner to Mr.
<HI>Dubourg</HI>'s. I found myself so ill, that I could not go to Church;
however, about Two o'Clock, I went to dine with my Friends, who looked on me
with as much Surprize as if they had seen an Ap∣parition. They had no
sooner seated me, but they both went out of the Room, and held a long
Consultation at the Door: Little did I think how deeply I was con∣cerned in
it. At length Mrs. <HI>Dubourg</HI> came in: I tenderly reproached her with her
Coldness to me: She said, she was not well; and asked me, had I heard
from <HI>Molesworth-street</HI> that Day? I told her, I had not. She
asked me, if Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> would come to Dinner? I told her, he was
engaged to preach at <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s Church in the Afternoon, and
therefore went to Mrs. <HI>Warren</HI>'s, where they dined early. 
<PB N="184" REF="191"/> A little while after, Counsellor <HI>Smith</HI> came
in; but they called him out, and held a long Conference with him. In short,
every body behaved themselves so oddly to me, that I knew not what to make
of it.</P>
<P>Just as Dinner was served up, Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> came in: 
<Q REND="inline">'My Dear (said I) you are bet∣ter than
Promise.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why (says he) I am not come to dine, but to
tell you your Father is stabbed.'</Q> Had he plunged a Dagger in my Heart, it
could not have given me a deeper Wound.</P>
<P>It seems, this Accident, for such my Fa∣ther declared it to
be, happened at Nine o'Clock in the Morning; and so unkind were my Mother and
Sister, they never sent me the least Notice of it. The Company I went to,
had known of it some Hours before; and consequently were surprized to
find me ignorant of what so nearly concerned me, and what, by that Time, all
<HI>Dublin</HI> knew. None of them could find in their Hearts to tell me of it;
and this was the Occasion of the many Consultations they held, which had
appeared so strange to me. It would be tedious to my Readers, to relate
every <PB N="185" REF="192"/> Difficulty I had even to see my Father. In
respect to the Ashes of my Mother, I do not chuse to tell how ill I was
used upon this Occasion; but as I owe no sort of Re∣spect or Ceremony
to my Sister, (if I may call her one, who by no means deserves that Title)
I must proceed. I rose from the Table, had a Chair called, and went to my
Father's: Three of the Servants sat in the Hall, and my Sister,
excessively dirty, walked to and fro in it. She would wil∣lingly have kept
me out; but however, the Servant knowing me, opened the Door. The first
Noise which struck my Ear, upon my Entrance, was the deep and piercing
Groans of my dear Father. When I at∣tempted to go up Stairs to offer my Duty to
him, my Sister by Violence pulled me down; but the Agony I was in for my
Fa∣ther, and the Resentment I conceived at her gross Usage of me,
supplied me with Strength to get up in despight of her. When I opened the
Dining-room Door, the Floor was all besmeared with Blood; my Mother, in an
arbitrary Voice, asked me, what Business I had there? I told her, 
<PB N="186" REF="193"/> I had a Child's Right to pay my Duty to my Father. She
said, if I spoke to him it would kill him. Upon which, for the first, and
indeed the only Time that ever I gave her an impertinent Answer; I said,
that if every Person about my Father had loved him with half my Tenderness,
he would not have been reduced to the Con∣dition I was then too sure he was
in. Upon this, I offered to go into the Bed-chamber, but was not only forcibly
withstood, but even beaten by my Mother, and again asked, if I intended to
kill my Father? I made her no Reply but sat down, and as∣sured her, that
the first Person who opened that Door I would go in. In about three Minutes
time Dr. <HI>Cope,</HI> Dr. <HI>Helsham,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nicholls,</HI> and in
all seven Physicians and three Surgeons (as my Father was univer∣sally
esteemed) came of their own Accord to visit him; when I heard them on the
Stairs, I took that Opportunity to open the Bed-chamber Door, in which neither
my Mother nor my Sister could well op∣pose me, as the Gentlemen were come
into the Dining-room, before they were apprised <PB N="187" REF="194"/> of my
Intention; but, Heavens! how shall I describe the Agony that seized me,
when I beheld my dear Father pale as Death, and unable to utter any thing but
Groans? those only who have loved a Father as well as I did mine, can judge
of my Condition: I kneeled down by the Bedside: Weak as he was he kindly
reached out his Hand to me: He asbed me if this was not an un∣happy Accident.
I begged he would not speak, because Mr. <HI>Nicholls</HI> had told me, his
Lungs were wounded, and that every Word was detrimental to him; but as I had
not ever knowingly offended him, I begged he would give me leave to pay my Duty
to him, and that he would signify it, by laying his Hand on my Head, which he
not only did, but desired I would not leave him. But here my Father gave me
an impossible Task; for no sooner were the Gentlemen departed, but my
Mother said she must speak with me; and whether she was really mad,
or counterfeited to be so, I know not; but she insisted on my going to
Bed with her, alledging that my Sister was younger and stronger than I, 
<PB N="188" REF="195"/> and better able to bear the Fatigue of sitting up.
This seemed to carry the Appearance of Love and Tenderness; but Heaven
knows it was far otherwise, as I afterwards found out; for the three
following Days my Mother never permitted me to leave her; if I ever attempted
it, she tore her Hair, and screamed like a Lunatick. The fourth Night I
heard my Father ring a Bell, my Mother was asleep, and as my Thoughts were
ever on him, I ran down Stairs to him undrest as I was. He seemed
surprized to see me, having been told that I was in my own House, and
would not un∣dertake the Trouble of attending him. I found him in a very cold
Sweat; it sud∣denly came into my Head, that if I could change that into a hot
one, it might, per∣haps, relieve him. So after assuring him, that I had not
quitted him, nor had ever been out of the House, but was prevented by my
Mother and Sister from attending on him, he said he was very dry, and
asked me, what the Physicians had ordered for him to drink. As they all
concluded he would not out-live that Night, they had ordered 
<PB N="189" REF="196"/> nothing, but left him to take what he pleased, as, in
spight of all Precautions to the contrary, I had overheard. Upon this, I
resolved so far to turn Physician myself as to tell him, they ordered
him to drink some Hock and Sack made warm. Weak as he was he could not
forbear smiling, and saying, he never heard of such another
Prescription; 
<Q REND="inline">'Ten Gentlemen meet to order me some Hock and
Sack mixed! said he; well, give it me: it must certainly be a Cure for a
pleuretick Fever.'</Q> I did so; nay, I not only gave it to him that Time,
but plied him with it every Time he called for Drink all Night, till it
produced the Effect I desired, and threw him into a fine breathing Sweat, and
a deep Sleep. It may now be demanded, where my Sister was all this Time? why,
as she had not, if I may speak my Mind, half the Regard for my Father that
I had, she was fast asleep in the Arm-Chair, nor could he awake her.</P>
<P>When the Physicians came in the Morn∣ing, they were agreeably
surprized to find my Father's Fever quite gone, and his Eyes 
<PB N="190" REF="197"/> look very lively; he told them, their merry
Prescription had done him gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rvice. I winked at them not to
undeceive him; they understood me, and Dr. <HI>Helsham</HI> called me
aside, under Pretence of giving me some Directions, but in reality, to
en∣quire of me what I had administered. I told him, and he could not forbear
smiling. He called the Gentlemen into the next Room to a Consultation, to
which present∣ly after I was summoned. As both Dr. <HI>Hel∣sham</HI> and
Dr. <HI>Cope</HI> were Men of Wit and Pleasantry, they rallied me agreeably
on presuming to practise Physick, having never taken my Degrees; and
assured me I should be called before the College of Physicians, and be
prosecuted as an Empyrick.</P>
<P>I rose up, and making a low Courtesy, I told them, as the
best Part of the College of Physicians were then present, they would, I
hoped, have Candour enough to permit me to make my own Defence; to which they
all assented by a gracious Nod, and bade me proceed; I then, making another
Reverence, told them, that as to my Right of practising Physick, I held it
<HI>extra ju∣dice,</HI> <PB N="191" REF="198"/> and smiling said, I
supposed they all understood <HI>Latin</HI>—but as their proper
Business was to destroy Life, I hoped they would not take it amiss, if
I for once, in a Case which so nearly and deeply concern∣ed me, had, to the
utmost of my power, frustrated their Designs; neither had I pre∣sumed
to interfere, till they themselves had assured me all Hope of my Father's
Life was gone, and that he could not live till Morning. But, said I, making
another Courtesy, I, with all respect to this ho∣nourable Board, humbly
presume to believe, 
<Q> 
<L>They had rather chuse that he should die,</L> 
<L>Than their Prediction prove a Lye.</L></Q> Nothing, except my
Father's being so very weak, and so very near to us, could have prevented
the Gentlemen's laughing hearti∣ly at my fine Harangue. However, I was
dismissed with Honour; and as my Father seemed now to want nothing but
Restora∣tives, I was directed to make him some Viper Broth, Hartshorn
Jelly, Chocolate, and other nourishing Aliments.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="199"/>From this Time we entertained Hopes of my
Father's Recovery. In a few Days he was so strong as to be able to sit up
from Morning till Night. The whole Town seemed to participate in our Joy; and
many who had never visited him before, came now to congratulate him and his
Fa∣mily on this happy Change. Whether it was owing to his having seen too
much Company, or to his own over-Neatness in insisting on having his
Chamber cleaned, I know not; but I received a Message from Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> that he was taken very ill, and desired to see me. As I
had flattered myself my Father was out of Danger, I obeyed the Commands of my
Husband, and prevailed on Mr. <HI>Nicholls</HI> to come to visit him. He
had got a Cold, and was a little feverish; Mr. <HI>Nicholls</HI> thought
pro∣per to take a little Blood from him, and I staid with him that Night and
Part of the ensuing Day. Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> being much relieved, gave me
leave in the Evening to go to my Father's, where I found all Things in
Confusion, and he so ill that there was now not the least Hope of his 
<PB N="193" REF="200"/> Recovery: He coughed incessantly, was seized with
what they call a galloping Con∣sumption, and in a very few Days after
expired, leaving me in inconceivable Sor∣row. About an Hour before he departed,
I left the Room being unable to see his last Agonies, and went up to my
Mother, who was as fast locked up in Sleep as guiltless Labour. Some time
after I heard the Windows thrown up, by which I knew his mortal Cares were
ended.</P>
<P>We had that Evening engaged a Nurse Keeper, but did not dare to
let her into my Father's Presence, lest he should say, as he once did,
on proposing such a thing, that we were tired of him; but now her
Assistance was absolutely necessary, tho' my Sister told me,
she herself helped to wash and lay my Father out. I am sure I could
have died sooner; but some Persons have uncommon Courage, or rather, as
<HI>Swift</HI> observes, 
<Q> 
<L>Indiff'rence clad in Wisdom's Guise,</L> 
<L>All Fortitude of Mind supplies.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="201"/>About three o'Clock in the Morning, on
New-Year's-Day, my Sister came into the Room, and desired me to come and
help her to take my Father up, that he wanted to rise. Tho' I was certain he
was dead, as I had not taken off my Cloaths, I went with her, and sent in the
Maid to sit by my Mother. I asked my Sister on the Stairs, was my Father
alive? She answered, No. So with a heavy Heart I went into the Dining-Room;
but by no means could I summon up sufficient Spirits, to look upon the
clay-cold Figure of him, who, under God, was the Author of my Being. My Heart
fluttered; my Tongue refused it's Office; neither had I the poor Relief of
Tears—no Wonder, when <HI>the very Spring and Fountain of my Life was
stopt—the very Source of it was stopped,</HI> if the Streams thereon
dependant, were for a while froze up and dead.</P>
<P>While I was lost in melancholy-musing, my Sister was very
industrious in making the Tea-Kettle boil. I do not say this by way of
Reflection on her; for tho' I was less assiduous about it, my own Mouth
was <PB N="195" REF="202"/> perfectly parched with Thirst, and I was very glad
of something to moisten it.</P>
<P>When the Tea was ready, unluckily we had no Sugar, nor was there
any in the House, but what was in the Tea-Chest, the Key of which was in my
Mother's Pocket under her Head. My Sister went up and waked her, telling her,
my Father wanted a little burned Wine. She readily gave it, and prayed devoutly
that it might do him good. My Sister came down laughing, to think how she
had imposed on her. If any thing could have added Weight to the intolerable
Burthen of my Sorrows, I now felt it, by considering how terrible my Mother's
Surprize and Disappointment must be!</P>
<P>About six o'Clock, I thought is was pro∣per to send the
Chest of Plate into Dean <HI>Madden</HI>'s, and to lock up whatever was
valuable; a prudent Precaution, as it too soon appeared. After this I went
into my Mother's Chamber; she asked me how my Father was. I told her he had
been very ill in the Beginning of the Night, but was now very quiet. She
said, she hoped Sleep <PB N="196" REF="203"/> would do him good. I
answered, I trusted in God it had. So she arose, and would not put on
her Shoes lest she should disturb him: Nay, so strong was the Force
of her Imagination, that she even said, she heard him cough as we
passed by his Chamber Door: But a sad Counterfeit was I; for when we came
into his Dressing-Room, which opened to the Garden, as it was now
Day-light, my Mother easily perceived the Concern in my Countenance; she
shrieked when she looked at me, and with great Impatience asked me, what
ailed me: 
<Q REND="inline">'O Lord! cried she, cannot you give me one Word
of Comfort?'</Q> I answered very faintly, I wished it was in my Power: But
alas! her worst Fears were but too true; all was over. I really thought she
would now have run quite mad; scarcely could I prevent her going into his
Chamber. I sent in for Dean <HI>Madden,</HI> who by Prayers and spiritual
Advice, a little calmed her; but one Woe trod upon the other's Heels: Mr.
<HI>Nicholls,</HI> who for the particular Re∣gard he had for my Father, was his
first Visitor, and whose Humanity during the <PB N="197" REF="204"/> whole
Time of his Sickness, deserves a grateful Acknowledgment; which, if the
surviving Part of his Family refuse, I think it incumbent on me to pay,
so far at least as Words can do it, came into the Dining-Room; he
guessed our Loss 'ere we could speak it, and seemed to bear a Part in
our Sorrows. He asked me what Hour he should come to open my Father. I told
him, he had left his Curse on any Person who attempted it. He said he was
very glad of it; for as this dismal Operation must have fallen to his
Share, it would, I am certain, greatly have shocked his Hu∣manity. I would
have had him go up to see my Mother: He said it would but re∣new her
Trouble, and that when she was a little more calm he would make her a
Visit.</P>
<P>I now thought it highly necessary to per∣suade my poor
Mother to take, at least, a Dish of Tea, which I could not do, but by
assuring her I was ready to faint. Just as it was prepared, a Servant,
looking like a Ghost, opened the Door, and beckoned me to follow him; I did
so, and upon com∣ing <PB N="198" REF="205"/> down Stairs, found the House
filled with Sheriff's Officers: One of them, whose Name was
<HI>Williams,</HI> was most remarkably insolent, and abused me very
grosly. I once more sent in for Dean <HI>Madden</HI>; I believe the worthy
Gentleman thought his Words might prevail, but the Scoundrel <HI>Williams</HI>
bade him, go talk in his Pulpit. However, I had Presence of Mind
suffi∣cient to write a Line to Counsellor <HI>Smith</HI>; he happened not
to be at home; so I begged of the Dean to go to my Mother, least those
licensed Robbers should plunder the House. About seven in the Evening
Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> came; he found the Wretches very busy in taking an
Inventory of the Furni∣ture. They were full as rude to him, as they had been to
the Dean; and at last car∣ried it so far, as to insist upon arresting
my Father's Body, just then laid in a Coffin. I, almost wild with Grief,
ran after them; the Coffin was open, and I raised my dear Father in my Arms,
and, as if he could have heard me, asked him, Would he not protect his
Family? Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> had, in the mean Time, sent for the High-Sheriff;
he <PB N="199" REF="206"/> was a young, good-natured Gentleman; and, after
heartily reprimanding the Fellows, nay, and even making <HI>Williams</HI> beg
pardon on his Knees, dismissed them all, except one, whom he ordered, not
only to be civil, but also to do the Work of a Ser∣vant; assuring us, he
would take an In∣ventory of the Things himself, as soon as the Funeral was
over.</P>
<P>The next Day, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> we deter∣mined to have my
dear Father buried, ac∣cording to his own Directions, privately, at Twelve
o'Clock at Night; and I easily prevailed on Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> and his
present Lady, to give their Company to my Mother, during the Time of this
last sad solemn Ceremony. As my Mother wept in∣cessantly, it made her
sleepy; but the Noise made in carrying down my Father's Corpse, awak'd
her; and as she had only slumber'd in her Chair, she started up, crying
out, they were carrying her dear Husband to the Grave, and that she would
go and be buried with him. We were obliged by Violence to restrain her; nay,
and also to assure her he had been interred <PB N="200" REF="207"/> some
Hours, and that the Noise she heard was only that of the Servants, who were
setting Things in Order. Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> and his Lady, who, according to
their Promise, came and passed the Evening with my Mo∣ther, said every
thing that Reason, Christi∣anity, or Humanity could dictate, to miti∣gate
her Afflictions. Gratitude for their Kindness made her endeavour to
supress the Anguish of her Soul; nay, out of Complaisance to them,
she drank a Glass or two of Wine, which, as she had not done for some
Weeks before, produced the Effect I desired, of making her sleep. Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> attended the Funeral Obse∣quies, which was the only Proof
of Re∣spect or Kindness he ever shewed to the Fa∣mily.</P>
<P>Early the next Morning, I rose; and if, in the melancholy
Situation of my Soul, any thing could have made me smile, the Cookmaid's
Simplicity would certainly have done it; for, finding her Fire made, her
Dishes washed, and every thing set in good Order, so well did the
Bailiff, who was left in the House, obey the High Sheriff's 
<PB N="201" REF="208"/> Orders, in doing the Work of a Servant; and he having
walked into the Garden; the Maid not recollecting there was any such Person
in the House, stood crossing herself, and praying to the Blessed
Virgin, and all the Saints in Heaven. I asked her, What was the matter? 
<Q REND="inline">'O my dear Ma∣dam! (says she) my Master was
always neat; and see, for all he is dead, how he made the Fire, and cleaned
up the Kitchen for me.'</Q></P>
<P>I left the poor Girl in her Mistake, and went up to my Mother.
It grieved me to awake her; yet knowing the High Sheriff would be early with
us, and that the In∣ventory of what was in her Chamber must be taken, I
thought it was most decent for her to be up, as her unhappy Situation could
not authorize her taking on the State of a Lady of Quality, to lie in Bed a
Month for Fashion's-sake.</P>
<P>She was not long up before the Gentle∣man came: From him I
learned, that this Execution was laid at the Suit of the Wi∣dow <HI>Ford,</HI>
who being Executrix to her Children, had asked my Father, where she 
<PB N="202" REF="209"/> could lay out their Money to Advantage. As Mr.
<HI>Monck</HI> wanted Money, my Father immediately thought of him; but as his
Estate was not liable to his Debts, my Father became Surety for him. This was
enough for me; I immediately wrote to Mr. <HI>Monck</HI>; who, on Receipt of
the Letter, came to Town, and, with great Honour, not only discharged his own
Debt, but also paid the Sheriff's Fees, which in three Days amount∣ed to
Twenty Pounds.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was the late <HI>Henry Stanly Monck,</HI> of
<HI>St. Stephen's Green.</HI></P>
<P>My Sister, like all provident Persons, made the best of her
Way to her Husband's Mother; who being assured, by Dean <HI>Mad∣den,</HI>
that he himself had married my Sister to her Son, which had been
questioned, on Account of his abrupt Departure from her, soon after he had
made her a Mother, was so kindly received by her new Parent, that for three
Weeks after, she never either sent, or came, to know what was become of the
old one.</P>
<P>As my Father had positively prohibited us from writing any
Account to my Bro∣ther, <PB N="203" REF="210"/> then at <HI>Paris,</HI> of the
Misfortune that had befallen him, I thought it not proper to disobey him;
yet, at the same time, judged it highly necessary he should be
ap∣prized of the melancholy Situation of his Affairs at home; I therefore
engaged a young Gentleman, an intimate Friend of my Brother's, to undertake the
mournful Task, and advise him immediately to re∣turn to <HI>Ireland:</HI>
But his best Speed could not overtake his Father's Life, who had been three
Weeks buried e're he arrived. When he saw us in deep Mourning, and missed
the dear Parent, who used ever to receive him with the Love of a Father, and
the Freedom of a Companion, all his Resolution could scarce support it:
and tho' he endeavoured to comfort us, 'twas but too visible he wanted it
himself. My Heart bled for him; so disappointed in all his Hopes, which,
as they had been high raised, were now the more depressed. In short, we
were all mere Outside, each endeavouring, by a forced Chearfulness, to
conceal their inward Anguish from each other.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="211"/>As my Brother, soon after, sold off the
Goods by Auction, and placed my Mother, who was left entirely dependant on him,
to board at a Clergyman's House in the Coun∣try, after which I never saw
her more; I returned to my own House.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> having now no Expecta∣tion of a Fortune by
me, he threw off all Disguise, and shewed himself in his proper
Colours; he had, it seems, while I was in the Country, in a bad State of
Health, got in League with the Widow <HI>W—rr—n,</HI> whom he
intended, if I had died, as was expected, should supply my Place. How∣ever,
he was resolved to gid rid of me at any rate; and as nothing but my Death, or
a Divorce, could accomplish his Desires, the latter seemed the safer
Method. To this End, he set all his Engines to work. His first Scheme I
shall here relate.</P>
<P>One Morning pretty early, he sent for me to come to him to
Breakfast in the Summer-house; as I thought he was alone, I ran to him
quite undrest; but was con∣founded at the Sight of a Gentleman, whom I had
never seen before, and who was drest <PB N="205" REF="212"/> out with the
utmost Magnificence and Cu∣riosity, rather in the Habit of a Birth-Night
Beau, than a Morning Visitor. I was for retiring, but Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>
obliged me to come in, and introduced him to me. I sat down with the best
Grace I could; and made the Tea: Before it was half over Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>
said, he was obliged to go visit a sick Person; but that he should
re∣turn in half an Hour, engaging me not to let the Gentleman go till then; at
the same time assuring him, I was very well qualified to entertain him
agreeably. The Gentle∣man did not express the least Reluctance at complying
with his Request; so far from it, that as soon as he was gone, he said,
he was much indebted to Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Complaisance, for the
favourable Oppor∣tunity he had afforded him of speaking his Wishes; and,
laying hold of my Hand, he began to address me in a most bom∣bastic
Stile, with Fustian from exploded Plays. For my part, I thought he was mad,
and growing angry at what I deemed a great Incivility to a married Woman, I
assured him, if he persisted in such Imper∣tinence, 
<PB N="206" REF="213"/> I would quit the Place. He then begged Pardon most
humbly indeed, for he threw himself on the Carpet at my Feet, swearing he
would never rise till I had forgiven him; which, not to be plagued with his
farther Impertinence, I was forced to say, I did. He then wanted me to
confirm it by a Kiss, but that I would by no means grant. In short, his
Company was so tiresome, that I most im∣patiently longed for a Release;
which, however, Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> was resolved not to give me: So
finding the Gentleman was determined to prosecute me, I told him I was
engaged to dine abroad, and hoped he would excuse my leaving him, as I
ex∣pected a Lady to call upon me, which laid me under a Necessity of going
to dress.</P>
<P>Upon this civil Dismiss, to my great Sa∣tisfaction he took his
Leave, promising me, he would do himself the Honour of waiting on me again
very speedily, to which I made no Reply.</P>
<P>I believe he went to Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> to give him an Account
of what had past, <PB N="207" REF="214"/> who some time after returned, and
seemed much offended, that I had suffered his Friend, as he called him, to
go away; add∣ing, that he was related to the Duke of <HI>Dorset,</HI> and
might, by his Interest, get him a good Living. I answered, Let him be ever
so well related, he was a very troublesome Coxcomb, and if he liked such
Company, I did not.</P>
<P>A few Days after my youngest Child died, and that I might avoid
seeing the Funeral, I retired to the Summer-House, where I sat weeping;
when suddently this same fine Spark opened the Door. He told me, Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> had sent him to desire I would have some Coffee ready,
and that he would be at home immediately. I desired the Gentleman to go with
me to the Dwelling-House, not chusing to stay alone with him at so
great a Distance from every Body. The Coffee was prepared, but no Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> came, so we drank it without him, and the Gentleman fell
into his old Vagaries again. I then, 
<Q><PB N="208" REF="215"/> 
<L>All smarting with my Griefs, being vex'd</L> 
<L>To be so pestered by a Popinjay,</L> 
<BIBL>Shakespear.</BIBL></Q> Burst into Tears, and demanded
of him, what he meant by such Insolence? He looked v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y much confounded, and asked me, was I in earnest? I
assured him I was, and that I would acquaint Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> with
his Rudeness. He smiled at that Threat, and to my great Surprize, made me
the following Speech. 
<Q REND="inline">'Madam, I am convinced by your Behaviour, that you
are a Woman of Honour, and am very sorry I should be so unfortunate as to
provoke your Tears: The best Re∣compence I can make you, is, to entrust you
with a Secret; and I doubt not but you will have Discretion enough to make a
proper use of it. Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> de∣scribed you to me, as a Lady
very li∣beral of your Favours, and begged I would be so kind as to make him a
Cuckold, so that he might be able to prove it, in order to a Separation from 
<PB N="209" REF="216"/> you; promising to give me Time and Opportunity for it:
He assured me, it would be no difficult Task; that I need but throw
myself at your Feet, whine out some Tragedy, and you would quick∣ly yield.
But I am now convinced, that he is a very great V—n, and very un∣worthy
of you.'</Q></P>
<P>I leave my Reason to judge of my Asto∣nishment. I could
scarce give the Gentle∣man Credit; and yet it was but too evident that he
spoke Truth, as it was now nine o'Clock at Night, and Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>
not come home to his invited Guest.</P>
<P>When I had recovered Power to speak, I told him, I supposed
Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> knew him to be a Person destitute of all Honour and
Humanity, when he proposed such a Scheme to him as that of betraying any
Woman. 
<Q REND="inline">'Faith, Madam, returned he, I never intended it;
for had you made me happy, I would, like a Gentleman, have forsworn it, and
also have given you a proper Caution: But I would not pay you so ill a
Compliment, as not to assure you, the Bait was very illuring. 
<PB N="210" REF="217"/> I believe there are very few young Fel∣lows who would
have refused him the Favour he desired of me.'</Q> I then beg∣ged he would
be so kind to leave me, which, accordingly, taking his Leave very
respectfully, he did.</P>
<P>I went to Bed full of Disquietude; but the bitter Anguish of
my Soul quite banish∣ed Sleep. I considered the Snares were laid for me,
and that he who ought to be the Guardian and Protector of my In∣nocence, was
the very first Person who sought to destroy it. I wept abundantly, and
prayed heartily to God, to deliver me out of my Trouble; at length I fell into
a Slumber, when methought my Father, just as I had seen him in his Coffin,
drew open the Curtain, and muttered something to me very low and
indistinct; but the Words <HI>Trouble, Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Shame,</HI> I very
plainly heard. I started up, and turned the Head Curtain back; but seeing
nothing, con∣cluded the Trouble of my Mind produced such terrifying Dreams,
and recommend∣ing myself to Heaven, once more addressed myself to
Sleep; when suddenly, me∣thought, <PB N="211" REF="218"/> I was in the midst
of a Parcel of Ruffians who were fighting, and that I, though I knew not why,
was the Occasion of their Quarrel. At last I thought one of them gave me a
severe Blow over the Head, at which I screamed out, and Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> who was now in the Chamber, waked me, and asked me, what
was the matter? I told him, I had a very shocking Dream. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, says he, you grieve so much after your
Father, and your Brat, and take no Sustenance, that it is no Wonder you
should be in the Vapours.'</Q> I desired he would be so kind as give me a
little Water; for I was in a faint cold Sweat; but as he always kept some
Cherry-Brandy in his Study, he made me take a little of it, which greatly
revived me. I then told him Mr. <HI>H—d</HI> had been to see him. He
asked me, how long he stayed? I answered, till I was weary of him. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, did he offend you?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed (returned I) he did.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'How?'</Q> said he. 
<Q REND="inline">'By a great deal of Impertinence, not worth
relating. I suppose (said he) the Coxcomb was re∣peating 
<PB N="212" REF="219"/> his Poetry to you.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No (re∣turned I) he spoke nothing of his own;
he had a proper Authority, I believe, for whatever he said.'</Q> I looked
earnest∣ly in Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Face, and could easily perceive he
was in great Confusion; so he put out the Candle, and came to Bed without
asking me any farther Questions.</P>
<P>Early the next Morning he went out of Town, without either leaving
a Shilling to provide for his Family, which consisted of a Maid, a Footman,
two Children, and my∣self, or any Person to serve his Cure; nei∣ther did
I, for the Space of two Months, hear from him, or receive any Supply; till at
last, by Accident, I learned he was with the Widow
<HI>W—rr—n.</HI> For the Truth of this, the Reverend Dr.
<HI>Bradford</HI> can bear Witness; I mean, so far as his going away
without either asking his Permission, or sub∣stituting any Person
to do his Duty. 
<Q> 
<L>But when a Lady's in the Case,</L> 
<L>All other Bus'ness must give Place.</L> 
<BIBL>Gay's Fables.</BIBL></Q> Even in Religion itself.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="220"/>I now beg leave to demand of every Person,
who has been severe in their Cen∣sures of me, what Duty, Love, or
Re∣spect was due to such a Husband? When an honest Man is linked to a
pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sidious Wo∣man, his
Misfortun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s claim Compassion;
b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ure a voluntary Cuckold is the
mean∣est Wretch in Human Nature, and de∣serves nothing from the World, but
the ut∣most Contempt.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Parish was quite in an Uproar; nobody to
visit the Sick, or read Six o'Clock Prayers. I related this Part of my
Distress to my Brother, who prevailed on a young Gentleman, who had been
his School-fellow and Companion, then newly ordained, to do Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI>'s Duty.</P>
<P>As for my two Children, I sent them to School, and they dined
every Day with Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Father; the Servants were forced to run
in Debt for Provision; and, for my own part, I quartered myself on my next
Door Neighbours, Mr. <HI>Lindsay</HI> and his Spouse, where I always met a
chear∣ful and friendly Reception.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="221"/>I must here observe, that because I
loved reading, Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> took with him the Key of his Study, into
which he had re∣moved all my Books, Presents to me from my Friends before I
was married. He also locked up the Garden, rather chusing it should be
overgrown with Weeds, and the Plants and Flowers die for Want of Water, than
that either I or the Children should have the Pleasure of amusing
our∣selves in it. The Tea-chest was also se∣cured; so I was left like
a tame Cat, with the Liberty of walking about through two or three empty
Rooms.</P>
<P>When I had learned where Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> was, I wrote to
him; but received no Answer. At length, one <HI>Saturday,</HI> about Twelve
o'Clock at Noon, his Horse was brought home and a mangy Dog, of which I was
ordered to take a particular care, which I did; and now expected the Mas∣ter.
But as his buxom old Widow (and old enough she was to be my Mother, and big
enough to make four of me) came to Town with him, he stayed with her till
Twelve o'Clock at Night. His first Ques∣tion <PB N="215" REF="222"/> when he
entered was, where was his Dog? with which having played about half an Hour,
hugging, kissing, and calling it an Angel, he at last vouchsafed to
come up Stairs. I sat in my Closet in a very pensive Posture; his
first Salutation to me was, to ask me, how I had the Impudence to write to
him about my Family Affairs? I asked him to whom else should I write? 
<Q REND="inline">'Very fine! (returned he) suppose Mrs.
<HI>W—rr—n</HI> had opened my Letter!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I could not suppose that, Sir, because it
is a Liberty I never took with you.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You took with me! why should you?</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay then (said I) why should she?</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I have (said he) great Patience, that I do not
turn you out of Doors.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'As soon as you please, Sir; I know my Way to
<HI>St. Sepulchres,</HI> and late as it is, I dare say they will give me
Admission.'</Q></P>
<P>I believe he thought he had now gone too far, and was more than
half afraid I would publish all his Villanies; so he fell into his old
Trade of Dissimulation, in which he is a perfect Master; and taking me by
the Hand, told me, he did not <PB N="216" REF="223"/> think so gentle a Temper
as mine could be disturbed at any Thing; and that it was very unkind in me to
be disobliged at his taking a little Recreation in the Country; adding, that
he often wished for me there. I asked him why he did not take me with him?
He said, he had proposed it to Mrs. <HI>W—rr—n</HI>; but that
she had objected a∣gainst it, telling him, I was a Woman of so bad a
Reputation, that she would not for all the World countenance me. I must beg
leave to ask my Readers, what Sort of Terms this Couple must be on, when
she took the Liberty of traducing his Wife to him? She may be very chaste,
for aught I know; but I verily believe many an un∣happy Creature, who has even
prostituted herself for Bread, would not have been guilty of her Crime.</P>
<P><HI>Cursed be he that parteth Man and Wife</HI> is Part of our
<HI>Ash-Wednesday</HI> Service, to which I say <HI>Amen,</HI> with all my
Heart and Soul.</P>
<P>But to return: I told Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> I was extremely
obliged to the Lady; that most Men, even if they hated their Wives, 
<PB N="217" REF="224"/> would resent any Injury offered to them as being Part
of themselves; but he was too good a Christian for that. So I arose, and
was for leaving the Room. He asked me, where I was going? I answered, 
<Q REND="inline">'To sleep with my Children; for why should I,
Sir, go to bed to a Man, in whose Person, Mind, or Fortune, I have no
longer a Share; and who has actually divorced him∣self from me, as the Law
can do!'</Q></P>
<P>However he insisted on my staying with him, which
accordingly I did. We both rose pretty early; and the Children coming in to
ask his Blessing, he whipt his Daugh∣ter severely, because, as he
said, she re∣sembled my Mother; though indeed she was infinitely more
like his own: And, to shew his Impartiality, he whipt the poor little Boy,
for being like himself.</P>
<P>When this Scene was over, the Children were turned down to the
Kitchen, and the mangy Dog, which it seems was given him by Mrs.
<HI>W—rr—n,</HI> invited to a good Plate of Toast and Butter and
half a Pint of Cream for his Breakfast; so well did he 
<PB N="218" REF="225"/> fulfil the old Proverb, <HI>Love me, love my
Dog.</HI></P>
<P>After these Holy Exercises, he went to the Communion; which
indeed I had in∣tended to do, but as he had really vexed me past my Patience,
I could not compose my∣self sufficiently for the worthily receiving
those sublime Mysteries.</P>
<P>Thus we may see it is in the power of a bad Man, not only to
destroy our temporal, but also our eternal Happiness.</P>
<P>I saw no more of him till Midnight; buxom <HI>Joan</HI> engaging
him till then, or in other Words, the Widow <HI>W—rr—n.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Father hearing he was in Town, came the
next Morning to see him, and demanded of him the Money he had paid for his
Childrens Tuition; upon which he turned to me, with an Air of great Con∣tempt,
and told me, he thought when he had married so accomplished a Lady, she
might have taught her Children to read, write, work, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and at
least have saved him the Expence of their Education. I told him, and indeed
it was Truth, that I should never desire a more delightful Em∣ployment 
<PB N="219" REF="226"/> than that of cultivating their Minds; but that he ought
to consider, he left no Support for our Bodies, and conse∣quently I was
obliged to go abroad every Day to seek for Food, and could not en∣cumber
such Company, as I might be wel∣come to, with my Children. Here Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI>'s Father interrupted me, by say∣ing, I might always have
been welcome to him. Indeed I doubt it not, for he was a good-natured Man; but
as he kept an Ale∣house, it was no very agreeable Place for me to pass my
Time in.</P>
<P>Next Morning buxom <HI>Joan</HI> came in her own Coach for her
Chaplain; a Right which most Widows of Fortune claim. I looked at her, and
she hid her Face. Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> soon waited on her, and away they
went together, leaving me just as de∣solate as I was before.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> has often alledged, in order to prove me an
Adultress, as I was with Child when we parted, that he had no manner of
matrimonial Commerce with me for four Years. I was but just four and twenty
Years of Age when we were sepa∣rated; <PB N="220" REF="227"/> and, as my
Reader may observe, he would not permit me to have a separate Bed, whether
what he not only said, but swore, was true or false, I do not see how
he could gain any Honour by it.</P>
<P>For as the <HI>Spanish</HI> Friar says, when old
<HI>Gomez</HI> boasts that his Wife was a spotless Virgin for him; 
<Q> 
<L>A fine Commendation truly!</L> 
<L>The Church did not put you together for that.</L></Q></P>
<P>And here, gentle Reader, give me leave to drop the Curtain. To
avouch mine own Innocence in a Point, where Appear∣ances were strong
against me, would per∣haps little avail me: The supreme Judge of Hearts
alone will at the last great Day clear or condemn me; to whose unerring
Justice and boundless Goodness I submit my Cause.</P>
<P>When Snares and Limed-Twigs are spread for a poor Bird, it
cannot well escape. Yet I may say with the condemned Duke of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> in <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>Henry the Eighth,</HI> 
<Q><PB N="221" REF="228"/> 
<L>We both fell by our Servants;</L> 
<L>Therefore, this receive as certain:</L> 
<L>Where you are lib'ral of your Loves and Coun∣sels,</L> 
<L>Be sure you are not loose; for those you make
Friends,</L> 
<L>And give your Hearts to, when they perceive</L> 
<L>The least Rub in your Fortune, fall away</L> 
<L>Like Water from ye, never found again,</L> 
<L>But where they mean to sink ye</L></Q> A proper Caution to
both Sexes, to be duly on their Guard against Confidants.</P>
<P>I could reckon up numberless Instances of Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI>'s Aversion to me; one in particular I cannot pass over.
One Day, at Dinner, the Pin in the Robing of my Gown, pricked my Breast; as
there was no body but my Husband and Children present, I made no Scruple of
uncovering my Bosom, to examine what had hurt me; upon which Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> rose from Table, and said I had turned his Stomach. As I
really had a fine Skin, and was then a most remarkably neat Person, I
thought he only <PB N="222" REF="229"/> jested; and merrily told him, he
should kiss my Breast and make it well: But alas! it was not like
<HI>Prior</HI>'s <HI>Lover's Anger,</HI> where when the Lady complains, that 
<Q> 
<L>An ugly hard Rose-bud has fall'n in my Neck,</L> 
<L>It has vex'd me, and plagu'd me to such a Degree!</L> 
<L>Look here now; you'll never believe one, pray see,</L> 
<L>I' th' Left Side of my Breast what a Mark it has made!</L> 
<L>So saying, her Bosom she careless display'd:</L> 
<L>That Seat of Delight I with Wonder sur∣vey'd,</L> 
<L>And forgot ev'ry Word I design'd to have said.</L></Q> For
he told me, he was sure he should faint if I came near him; and either
pretended to throw up his Dinner, or did it in reality. After which polite
Compliment, he drank a large Glass of Cherry-brandy, to settle his Stomach;
and repaired to his usual Haunt, <HI>i. e.</HI> to buxom <HI>Joan.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="230"/>About Twelve at Night, he returned, and
awaked me out of a sweet Sleep, by telling me, I was a most expensive
extrava∣gant Woman. I asked him in what? He said, in putting on clean Linen
every Day; whereas Mrs. <HI>W—rr—n,</HI> who had a Thou∣sand
Pounds a Year, assured him, she never shifted herself but once a
Week, and shewed him Half-sleeves, which she wore, to save the Expence
of washing. I answered him very carelesly, that I supposed that was
what charmed him; and therefore, Dirt to Dirt.</P>
<P>I beg leave here to remark, that my Hus∣band's Complaints were
very different from those of most married Men; their general Excuse for
going astray is, that their Wives are dirty, slothful, ignorant,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> the very Reverse of which swinish Qualities made my good
Man hate me. 
<Q> 
<L>Well, grant me guilty, which never yet was proved;</L> 
<L>Yet I do think, if Wives do fall, it is their Husbands
Fault.</L> 
<L><PB N="224" REF="231"/>Say, that they slack their Duty, and
pour our Treasure into foreign Laps,</L> 
<L>Or else break out in peevish Jealousy,</L> 
<L>Throwing Restraint on us: Or say, they strike us;</L> 
<L>Or scant our former Having, in Despight.</L> 
<L>Why, we have Galls; and though we have some Grace,</L> 
<L>Yet we have some Revenge. Let Hus∣bands know,</L> 
<L>Their Wives have Sense like them: They see and
smell,</L> 
<L>And have their Palates both for sweet and sour,</L> 
<L>As Husbands have. What is it that they do,</L> 
<L>When they change us for others? Is it Sport?</L> 
<L>I think it is. And doth Affection breed it?</L> 
<L>I think it doth. Is't Frailty that thus errs?</L> 
<L>It is so too. And have not we Affections?</L> 
<L>Desire for Sport? and Frailty, as Men have?</L> 
<L><PB N="225" REF="232"/>Then let them use us well; or let them
know,</L> 
<L>The Ills we do, their Ills instruct us to.</L> 
<BIBL>Shakespear.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And in one of the Sermons on Social Duties, published lately by
a real Divine, he makes this Observation, That he be∣lieves, very few Women
have either been so weak, or so wicked, to wrong the Mar∣riage-bed, but
when they have been pro∣voked to it, either by the ill Treatment they received
from their Husbands, or in Re∣venge to their prior Falshoods.</P>
<P>If I have not delivered the most worthy Author's Sentiments with
his own Elegance of Style, I am sure he will pardon me, as I only quote from
Memory, not being Mis∣tress of his admirable Works.</P>
<P>I do assure my Reader, I do not, by those Quotations, mean
to countenance Vice, 
<Q> 
<L>Or to arm my Pen</L> 
<L>Against the Sun-clad Power of Chastity.</L> 
<BIBL>Milton.</BIBL></Q> <PB N="226" REF="233"/> So far from it,
that in my Opinion, Nothing can excuse the Breach of it; and a Fe∣male 
<Q> 
<L>Should strip herself to Death, as to a Bed,</L> 
<L>Which, longing, she'd been sick for,</L> 
<L>Rather than yield her Body up to Shame.</L></Q> All I intend
is this; the World has been pleased to say, I had a most excellent
Hus∣band; and therefore have thought proper, not thinking their Bill of
Accusation large enough, to add <HI>Ingratitude</HI> to every other Vice and
Folly they are pleased to attribute to me.</P>
<P>But so many Yards of Prunella and a Bit of clear Cambrick,
properly placed under the Chin, it seems make a Holy Man. 
<Q> 
<L>Yet, let's write Good Angel, on the De∣vil's Horn,</L> 
<L>'Tis not the Devil's Crest.</L> 
<L>And so an outward Sainted Priest, may</L> 
<L>In all his Dressings, Titles, Caracts, Forms,</L>

<P>I hope Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> will return his Acknowledgments to
me, for making him publicly known; for, as I hear, his Poems have suffered
the Fate of all Things mor∣tal; and, to use his own Lines, 
<Q> 
<L>Since he and his Writings so soon are forgotten,</L> 
<L>E'er his Carcass become, like his Prin∣ciples, rotten;</L> 
<L>My Muse shall forbid it, transmitting his Merits,</L> 
<L>As the Curious, for Shew, preserve Mon∣sters in

<HI>Graffan,</HI> written many Years before the Gentleman's Death.</BIBL></Q>
And so if my <HI>Quondam</HI> Husband arrives at Fame, or ever goes to
Heaven, either of which I very much doubt, I think he must still rest my
Debtor. 
<Q><PB N="228" REF="235"/> 
<L>For <HI>Fame</HI> has but two Doors, a white and a black
one,</L> 
<L>The worst you say, he's stole in at the back
one.</L></Q> And that Cuckolds go to Heaven, no body ever yet disputed. Were
he one, he ought to thank me that helped to send him thi∣ther. If I have
bestowed on him Fame in this World, and Salvation in the next, what could a
reasonable Man desire more from his Wife? But some Folks are never to be
satisfied!—But whether he is entitled to the Horn or not, must always
be a Se∣cret: I hope some curious Commentator will hereafter endeavour to
find out the Truth of it; for my Mind gives me, 
<Q> 
<L>That I, like the Classics, shall be read</L> 
<L>When Time, and all the World are dead.</L></Q> And if a
<HI>Scotch</HI> Barber, one <HI>Allan Ramsay,</HI> promises himself so
much, in a Sort of Bur∣lesque on <HI>Horace,</HI> why may I not be in∣dulged 
<PB N="229" REF="236"/> in equal Vanity, the ruling and darling Passion of
our Sex? Tho' I shall never carry it to such an unnatural Height, as Dr.
<HI>Young</HI> makes a Lady do, when she is dying, 
<Q> 
<L>Odious, in Woollen! 'twould a Saint pro∣voke!</L> 
<L>Were the last Words that dying Flavia spoke!</L> 
<L>No, let a charming Chintz, and <HI>Flander's</HI> Lace,</L> 
<L>Shade my pale Corse, and deck my lifeless Face.</L> 
<L>One wou'd not sure, look ugly when one's dead;</L> 
<L>And—<HI>Betty,</HI> give my Cheeks a little
red.</L></Q></P>
<P>I must beg my Reader's Pardon for these numerous Quotations;
but, as <HI>Swift</HI> says, 
<Q REND="inline">'those anticipating Rascals the Ancients, have
left nothing for us poor Moderns to say:'</Q> But still to shew my
Vanity, let it stand as some sort of Praise, that I have stolen
wisely.</P>
<P>At length the fatal Hour arrived, when Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s
Machinations wrought the Effect he so long desired, namely, my
De∣struction; <PB N="230" REF="237"/> and, as he never did Things by Halves,
that of his own Children also; to whom his Barbarity has exceeded any thing I
ever either heard or read of; but that in due Place.</P>
<P>I own myself very indiscreet in permit∣ting any Man to be at
an unseasonable Hour in my Bed-Chamber; but Lovers of Learning will, I am
sure, pardon me, as I solemnly declare, it was the attractive Charms of a
new Book, which the Gentle∣man would not lend me, but consented to stay
till I read it through, that was the sole Motive of my detaining him. But the
Servants, being bribed by their Master, let in twelve Watchmen at the Kitchen
Win∣dow, who, though they might have open∣ed the Chamber-Door, chose rather
to break it to pieces, and took the Gentleman and myself Prisoners.</P>
<P>For my own Part, I thought they had been House-breakers, and
would willingly have compounded for Life, when entered Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI>
with a Cambric Hand∣kerchief tied about his Neck, after the Fashion of Mr.
<HI>Fribble,</HI> and with the <PB N="231" REF="238"/> Temper of a Stoic, bid
the authorized Ruffians not hurt me: But his Christian Care came too late;
for one of them had given me a violent Blow on the Temple, and another had
dragged two of my Fin∣gers out of Joint. The Gentleman, at the Sight of Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> threw down his Sword, which he observing, made two of the
Watchmen hold him, while he most courageously broke his Head.</P>
<P>After this heroic Action, he told me, who stood quite
stupified between Surprize and Pain, that I must turn out of Doors; but
observing that I was fainting, he brought up a Bottle of Wine, and kindly
drank both our Healths. He would fain have prevailed on us to pledge him; but
we were not in a Temper to return Civili∣ty. Upon which he took my Hand, and
very generously made a Present of me to the Gentleman, who could not in
Honour refuse to take me, especially as his own Liberty was not to be
procured on any other Terms. Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> kindly dis∣missed our
Guards, and assured us, as soon as ever he had obtained a Divorce, he 
<PB N="232" REF="239"/> would with great Pleasure, join us together in holy
Matrimony. At the Door the Gentleman's Sword was delivered to him. Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> offered to kiss me at part∣ing, which mean Piece of
Dissimulation, so much in the Stile of <HI>Jack Ketch,</HI> gave me the
utmost Contempt for the V—n.</P>
<P>It was by this time two o'Clock in the Morning, and we knew not
where to steer our Course: However, the Gentleman's Servant always sat up
for him, and there∣fore he judged it more adviseable to go to his own
Lodging, than to search for any other, and, truly, I little cared where I
went.</P>
<P>And here, I sincerely assure my Reader, that neither of us
even entertained a Thought of any thing like Love, but sat like Statues till
Day-break; when recollect∣ing that I had nothing to change me with, I wrote a
Letter to Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> to desire he would send me my wearing
Apparel, or at least some clean Linen.</P>
<P>He complied with my Request, and wrote me a long Letter, wherein
he seemingly ex∣pressed an infinite Concern for my Loss, but 
<PB N="233" REF="240"/> as I had most strenuously recommended our Children
to his Care, he gave it then un∣der his Hand that he was perfectly con∣vinced
they were his own, and that I might depend on his Tenderness to them; but at
the same time, as he was determined to be legally divorced, he expected I
would not give him any Opposition in it.</P>
<P>Before I received this Letter, I had taken a Lodging in
<HI>Abbey-street</HI> up two pair of Stairs, where my Clothes were brought to
me, together with it; but not a single Shilling to assist me, my Watch,
my Books, and even what few Jewels I possessed be∣fore Marriage, were
detained from me, which threw me quite dependant on the Courtesy of the
Person I was accused with.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> was so highly pro∣voked at our not
cohabiting together, as he wished, that he forced the Gentleman to fly, who
having Notice that there was an Action taken out against him, made the best
of his way to <HI>London,</HI> leaving a Letter with five Guineas enclosed in
it for <PB N="234" REF="241"/> me, in the Hands of a Dissenting Minister,
who very faithfully discharged his Trust.</P>
<P>Curiosity made me go to the Gentle∣man's Lodging to enquire of
his Land∣lady what she knew relating to him; the Gentlewoman was very
obliging, but could give me no Satisfaction or Light into the Affair: However,
she made me drink Tea with her, and we sat together till near nine o'Clock
at Night.</P>
<P>At my return to my own Lodging, the Maid told me my Room was Let;
I said that was odd, as it was taken by the Week, and one not then expired,
to Let it with∣out giving me Warning to provide myself, which, at that Hour,
in a Winter's Night, it was impossible for me to do.</P>
<P>The Maid, to whose care this House was entrusted, for I know
not who was Land∣lord, told me, I might if I pleased lie in the first
Floor, as the Family were not come to Town, and there were only their Servants
in the House, whom she could dispose of into worse Beds; but, to my
great Surprize, I found the Lock had been taken off the Bed-chamber Door, which
I will remem∣bered <PB N="235" REF="242"/> had been on it in the Morning, as I
had some Difficulty to open it to take thence some China.</P>
<P>I asked her the meaning of it? She in∣sisted positively
that there never had been a Lock on it, which knowing to be a Falshood, I
began to be apprehensive some foul play was intended, nor was I
mistaken.</P>
<P>I then asked her for a young Woman, whom she had told me was a
Servant out of Place, that lodged in the back Parlour; she said she was a
Bed in the Garret, and that my Trunk was there also; this gave me a
sufficient Excuse, as there was no Lock on the Trunk, to go up to her; and
as she had been a Lady's Woman, and very well knew who I was, I told her all
my Appre∣hensions, and she readily consented to quit her own Bed and come
to mine.</P>
<P>We brought down the Trunk between us, and placed it against the
Chamber-Door; as the Maid was busied with her new Guests, she took it for
granted I was alone, and therefore resolved to provide me with 
<PB N="236" REF="243"/> a Male Bed-fellow, as a proper Consolation for a
Person in my unhappy Situation.</P>
<P>About seven o'Clock in the Morning, not then clear Day, she
very furiously pushed open the Chamber-Door, and told me, one Mr.
<HI>B—k</HI> desired to breakfast with me, who was a Member of
P—t, and a Man of Fortune, and the Person who had taken the House. I
told her I never wished to see any human Creature, and should be glad I
could hide myself even from my∣self; but she, supposing me to be
alone, directly introduced a Man, full six Feet high, and of the most
disagreeable Aspect I ever beheld—Perhaps it was my Terror that
painted him so to my Imagination.</P>
<P>I started up and threw my Gown about me, but I was not quite
so quick in putting on my Clothes as the Gentleman was, in taking his off,
resolving, without the least Ceremony to come to Bed to me, I pulled my
Companion, who asked him what he meant; why, who the D—l are you, you
old B—ch said he: This Lady, mean∣ing me, is publickly known thro' all
the Coffee-houses in <HI>Dublin.</HI> Had the Gentle∣man 
<PB N="237" REF="244"/> been studying how to disappoint his own Intentions,
he could not more effectual∣ly have done it, as he brought all the Horror of my
Condition full upon my Mind. And as I had no Protector, no Friend, no Guardian,
I burst into Tears, and told him, if he was a Gentleman, he would not
insult Misery. 
<Q REND="inline">'Do I occasion Tears, Madam?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You do, Sir, and and therefore I desire you
will depart.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, Madam, said he, I beg pardon, I had a
full History of you from the Maid of the House, who said, she believed
a Companion would not be disagreeable to you, especially as she was
apprehensive you had no Money.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir, said I, she is mistaken, I have at
least enough to dis∣charge my Lodging, which I will imme∣diately do; and
once more I desire you to withdraw, which accordingly he did.'</Q></P>
<P>I then prevailed on the young Woman who was with me to take a
Lodging for me, and in about half an Hour I went to it. 
<Q> <PB N="238" REF="245"/> 
<L>But now came the general Slander Charge</L> 
<L>Which some invent, the rest enlarge.</L></Q>So from my
Heart, I wrote the following Lines. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>SORROW.</HEAD>

<L>Can no Recess from Calumny be found?</L>

<L>If thrown by Chance upon some desert Coast,</L>

<L>And hopes that Fortune can inflict no more;</L>
<L>Till some fell Serpent makes the Wretch his Prey,</L>
<L>Who 'scaped in vain the Dangers of the Sea;</L>
<L>So I who hardly 'scap'd Domestic Rage,</L>
<L>Born with eternal Sorrows to engage,</L>
<L>Now feel the poisonous Force of sland'rous
Tongues,</L>
<L>Who daily wound me with envenom'd Wrongs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shed then a Ray Divine, all Gracious Heav'n,</L>
<L>Pardon the Soul that sues to be forgiv'n,</L>
<L>Tho' cruel Humankind relentless prove</L>
<L>And least resemble thee in Acts of Love;</L>
<L>Tho' Friends who shou'd administer Relief,</L>
<L>Add Pain to Woe, and Misery to Grief,</L>
<L>And oft! too oft! with Hypocritic Air,</L>
<L>Condemn those Faults in which they deeply shaer.</L>
<L><PB N="240" REF="247"/>Yet thou who dost our various
Frailties know,</L>
<L>And see'st each Spring from whence our Actions
flow,</L>
<L>Shalt, while for Mercy to thy Throne I fly,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou didst the jarring Elements compose,</L>
<L>Whence this harmonious Universe arose;</L>
<L>O speak the Tempest of the Soul to Peace,</L>
<L>Bid the tumultuous War of Passion cease;</L>
<L>Receive me to thy kind Paternal Care,</L>

<L>And since no more I boast a Mother's Name,</L>
<L>Nor in my Children can a Portion claim,</L>
<L>The helpless Babes to thy Protection take,</L>
<L>Nor punish for their hapless Mother's sake:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus the poor Bird when frighted from her Nest</L>
<L>With agonizing Love, and Grief distress'd,</L>
<L>Still fondly hovers o'er the much lov'd Place,</L>
<L>Tho' strengthless, to protect her tender Race;</L>
<L>In piercing Notes she movingly complains,</L>

<BIBL>Swift.</BIBL></Q> <PB N="242" REF="249"/> But I had a
Fellow-Lodger, one Mr. <HI>Don∣nellan,</HI> an Ensign, who it seems knew me
so well, that he thought proper to bring the late Earl of
<HI>R—sse,</HI> of facetious Me∣mory, and several other Persons
of Distinc∣tion, to break open my Lodging. On hearing them coming up Stairs,
I ran into the Dining-Room, and locked myself in. When those worthy
P—rs could not find me, they threatened to kick the Landlady; and one of
them putting his Mouth to the Key-hole of the Dining-Room, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'Do, my Dear, open the Door; by Heaven! it is
nobody but I, <HI>D—g,</HI> the Fiddler.'</Q> I made no Reply; so being
disappointed, they were forced to decamp, cursing and vowing Revenge
against the Woman of the House.</P>
<P>This Accident so terribly alarmed me, that I resolved to quit
this Lodging the next Day; but Mr. <HI>D—n</HI> was de∣termined not to
permit me to depart in Peace; for, being a military Man, he stood Centinel at
the Door of my Chamber all Night, frequently intreating me to let him in; but
truly had I been amorously in∣clined, <PB N="243" REF="250"/> the Sight of the
various Medicines in his Apartment would have 
<Q> 
<L>Damp'd all Passion sympathetic.</L></Q> For, as I had a
back Room, when this Gentleman was abroad, I frequently, for Variety, went into
his, which looked into the Street.</P>
<P>However, at last he went to Bed; and early next Morning he told
the Landlady that I had kept him awake all Night, and that I was a most
notorious common S—t.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Arah, by my Shoul (said the old Dame) you would
make her one, if you could: What Business had you, and all those Lords
with her? One of them bid the Devil to breake my own Neck; but I hope he will
be hanged first.'</Q></P>
<P>While my Landlady, to whom I had never told my Name, related this
to me, I heard somebody enquire for Mrs. <HI>Pilking∣ton,</HI> so I
desired to know who it was, and up came a very well drest matron like
Fe∣male of about Fifty; she expressed great <PB N="244" REF="251"/>
Concern for my Misfortunes; said, my dear Father had saved her Life, and
that she was at present House-keeper to the Earl of <HI>A—m,</HI>
who was extremely troubled for his Rudeness to me, and hoped I would give him
an Opportunity of beg∣ging my Pardon. I told her, as I did not know whom to
blame, I wanted no Apo∣logy; it was my wretched Fate to be sub∣ject to the
Insolence of every Fellow.</P>
<P>She then urged, what I own was a pre∣vailing Argument to one not
worth a Shil∣ling, that my Lord was very generous, and would, she was sure,
make me a hand∣some Present, in Recompence of the Ter∣ror he had put me
into. As I looked on my present Circumstances to be quite de∣sperate,
being near Lying-in, and having nothing to assist me, I agreed to see
him any where, except at my own Lodging. Upon which the artful old Crone told
me of a House in the Neighbourhood, a very reputable one according to her
Account, where my Lord would meet me in the Evening.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="252"/>Accordingly I went; but let any one judge of
my Surprize, when instead of the Earl, I met a Gentleman whom I had never
seen before: So I instantly departing left him to his Contemplations. And
in Pro∣cess of Time it came to light, that the venerable House-keeper of
the Earl, was neither better or worse than the celebrated Mother
<HI>Brown:</HI> And indeed I received many Visits from Ladies of her
sublime Calling.</P>
<P>And what most surprised me, was, that they were generally
employed by sober mar∣ried Men, and such as to my own Know∣ledge, lived
very well with their Wives; but these Ladies assured me, their Husbands
hated them, and would rather have any other Woman. So I found I was not a∣lone
in my Misfortune. And if every married Man, who has ever attacked me, does not
subscribe to my <HI>Memoirs,</HI> I will, without the least Ceremony,
insert their Names, be their Rank ever so high, or their Profession
ever so holy.

<Q> 
<L>Yet he was a B—p, and he wore a Mitre,</L></Q> Which, in
all in good Time, may be 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>Surrounded with Jewels of Sulphur and Nitre.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>How nearly this B—p my B—p re∣sembles!</L>
<L>But his has the Odds, who believes and who trembles.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="255"/>What I thought most cruel in him was that
he never gave a Farthing to the poor Women themselves. But to make up
Mat∣ters with Heaven, he took up ten Bastards every Year; fed, clothed, and
apprenticed them; hoping, no doubt, as his Dealings were pretty promiscuous,
some one of them might belong to him. So 
<Q> 
<L>How could his Charity be better shewn,</L> 
<L>Or whom should he provide for, but his own?</L></Q></P>
<P>As I do not chuse to be guilty of <HI>Scan∣dalum magnatum,</HI>
if nobody can guess who I mean, I will fairly acknowledge myself to be as
arrant a Dunce as any B—p or Parson in the World, and really that is
speaking largely; 
<Q> 
<L>Considering what Dulness reigns</L> 
<L>Amongst our P—s, Priests and Deans.</L></Q></P>
<P>And as <HI>Milton</HI> observes on the Devil's breaking into
Paradise: 
<Q><PB N="249" REF="256"/> 
<L>So since into God's Fold</L> 
<L>Climb Thieves, and Ruffians, and lewd hireling Slaves,</L> 
<L>Turning the Sanctuary of th' Almighty</L> 
<L>Into a Den.</L></Q></P>
<P>And it were to be wished that our Blessed Saviour would once
more come, and drive those Money-Changers out of the Temple.</P>
<P>I was again once more obliged to change my Lodging, and knew not
how to provide for the approaching Calamity: I wrote to Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI>
who generously sent me Six∣pence by my eldest Son, to put me above the
Temptations to which Want exposes our helpless Sex; for so he
expressed him∣self in a long Epistle he wrote with it.</P>
<P>But when things are at the worst they generally mend; for who
should arrive from <HI>London</HI> but Mr. <HI>W—le.</HI> He no
sooner heard of my Misfortune, but he came to visit me, and as he had a
strange Ambition to be thought a Poet, he assured me, if I would devote
my Genius to his Service he would liberally reward me; to which I gladly
consented, as an easy and <PB N="250" REF="257"/> honourable Method of
getting a Subsist∣ence.</P>
<P>I really would not be so ungenerous to strip the
<HI>Jack-Daw</HI> of his borrowed Plumes, but that his Usage of me in
<HI>Lon∣don</HI> was so inhuman, that it merits a worse Punishment from
me, than meerly expos∣ing his Vanity, and the World may con∣clude, 
<Q> 
<L>That of all the fine Things which he keeps in the Dark,</L> 
<L>There's scarce one in ten, but what has my Mark.</L></Q>
Though Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> and <HI>Harry C—ry</HI> were his two
Subalterns, or under Strappers in poetical Stock-jobbing. As Mr.
<HI>W—le</HI> was a musical Man, my first Task was to write a Song
for him, which I performed in the following manner. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L><HI>STELLA,</HI> Darling of the Muses,</L>
<L>Fairer than the blooming Spring;</L>
<L>Sweetest Theme the Poet chuses,</L>
<L>When of thee he strives to sing.</L>

<PB N="251" REF="258"/>
<L>While my Soul with Wonder traces</L>
<L>All thy Charms of Face and Mind,</L>
<L>All the Beauties, all the Graces,</L>
<L>Of the Sex in thee I find.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Love, and Joy, and Admiration,</L>
<L>In my Breast alternate rise;</L>
<L>Words no more can paint my Passion,</L>
<L>Than the Pencil cou'd thine Eyes.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Lavish Nature thee adorning,</L>
<L>O'er thy Lips and Cheeks hath spread,</L>
<L>Colours that might shame the Morning,</L>
<L>Smiling with celestial Red.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Would the Gods, in blest Condition,</L>
<L>Our Requests indulgent view,</L>
<L>Sure each Mortal's first Petition</L>
<L>Would be to resemble you.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> shewed this Ballad to Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> who thought proper to alter the last Verse, giving it
this prophane and non∣sensical Turn; 
<Q><PB N="252" REF="259"/> 
<L>Cou'd the Gods, in blest Condition,</L> 
<L>Aught on Earth with Envy view,</L> 
<L>Lovely <HI>Stella,</HI> their Ambition</L> 
<L>Wou'd be to resemble you.</L></Q> As for the Gods envying
Mortals, and wish∣ing to be like them, it has neither Sense,
<HI>English,</HI> nor even Novelty to recommend it; nor is it agreeable to
the Dictates of Reason or Religion; for even a Heathen Author stands
condemned for setting <HI>Cato</HI> in a Light superior to the Gods; but a
Christian Divine may say any thing, and so much for an old Song.</P>
<P>I thought my Circumstances might have secured me from any
farther Attacks from the Male World; but it seems I was to have no more
Rest than the Patriarch's Dove had; for I had a furious Onset from

insomuch that I was obliged to compliment him with the following Lines.

<P>This did not happen to silence the Fel∣low, who now carried his
Impudence so far, as to declare to all the Lawyers at the <HI>Rose</HI>
Club, that I made Love to him; so, recollecting a Story his Nephew, who was
married to my Sister, had related to me, of a vile Use to which he adapted
three large Folio Volumes of his Uncle's Philosophy, I wrote the following
Ballad, and pacquetted Mr. <HI>T—ffe</HI> with it, at a Time I knew
several Lawyers would be assembled at the Tavern aforementioned; and
threatened Mr. <HI>T—ffe,</HI> if he did not read it out for the
Amusement of the Company, he should be my next Subject for Satyr; but no
body so earnestly insisted on seeing the Song as <HI>C—n</HI>
himself. To oblige him and entertain the Company, <PB N="256" REF="263"/> Mr.

<P>I have been credibly informed that this Song made
<HI>C—n</HI> blush, which was more than any thing had ever done before.
How∣ever he took a Copy of it, which he pro∣mised to publish; but finding
he has not been as good as his Word, I must even be at the Expence of doing
it my self.</P>
<P>But to return: Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> came to me, and told me, he
had been so unfortunate to disoblige a Lady of Distinction; for not
be∣ing apprized that she understood <HI>French,</HI> and being asked in
that Language, how he liked her? he said, she was an indifferent Pic∣ture
of her Sister: But he easily perceived, by an Alteration in her
Countenance, that <PB N="259" REF="266"/> she too well understood him, and
that he was out of Hope of obtaining her Pardon, unless something pretty
could be wrote upon the Subject by way of Apology; so I raised his Spirits
in about half an Hour after, by sending him the following Lines.

<L>Each diff'rent Turn of Mirth or Spleen</L>

<P>In the Evening Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> returned, and told me, the
Lines had made up all Matters; that the other young Lady said, she wished
he had affronted her, so he had made her such a pretty Apology.

<P>Mr. <HI>W—e</HI> now began to make some Figure; and tho'
he kept me pretty fully employed, he drove an underhand Trade with Mr.
<HI>P—n.</HI> And as he was not willing that either of us should
believe him incapable of Writing, he used to shew Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s
Work to me, and swear it was his own; and in return, he, with the same
modest Assurance, presented mine to him; but we were too well
acquainted with each other's Stile to be deceived. At last, Mr.
<HI>P—n,</HI> not satisfied with all the Ex∣pence he put him to in
<HI>London,</HI> made a Demand on him for fifty Pounds; but as Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> had before made the best Penny of me to him he
possibly could, and <HI>W—le</HI> finding what I wrote passed
every Jot as well his, he thought it most convenient, if he did disburse
any thing, to give it to me, as thinking I most wanted it; so I was now
full of Poetical Business, <PB N="264" REF="271"/> by which my Poverty was
relieved, and my Mind amused.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> was so vexed at losing his Chap, that
in Revenge he endeavoured to insinuate that we conversed unlawfully
to∣gether; but this met no Credit, as I very seldom saw him, and never
alone.</P>
<P>In the mean time he carried on a vigorous Prosecution against
me in the Spiritual Court, in which I gave him no opposition; as he
solemnly declared he would always allow me a Maintenance to the utmost of
his Ability; and to live with him, I by no means desired. 
<Q> 
<L>For never cou'd true Reconcilement spring</L> 
<L>Where Wounds of deadly Hate so deep were fix'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>But no sooner had he obtained a Separa∣tion from me, but he
retracted every Word he had said; not only refusing to give me any
Assistance, but also abusing me, in the most unchristian,
false, and scandalous manner, and publickly triumphed in hav∣ing
over-reached me. Upon this I was <PB N="265" REF="272"/> advised to lodge an
Appeal against him, which made him quite mad. He abused his Advocate
Proctor, and the Judge himself, as all doing him Injustice; and tho' I knew
none of them, insisted on it, they were Confederates with me against
him.</P>
<P>But this outragious manner of Proceed∣ing rather injured himself
than me; the Delegates were appointed; and as every body whom he consulted,
assured him, he would be cast, his haughty Spirit was will∣ing to
capitulate; but nobody would un∣dertake to deliver his Message to me,
least he should scandalize them for it; so at length with great
Entreaty he prevailed on <HI>W—le</HI> to make a Proposal from him, to
me, of giving me a small Annuity, and thirty Pounds in Money, which, in
regard to my Children, I rather chose to accept of, than ruin their Father,
as I certainly had it in my power to do.</P>
<P><HI>W—le,</HI> who has really a good deal of Humour, came to
me one Morning after my being a Week without seeing him, and in a Theatrical
manner delivered the following Speech: 
<Q><PB N="266" REF="273"/>Before I speak the Message of the
Priest; first give me leave to glory in the Title of his
Ambassador.</Q></P>
<P>I wondered what odd Whim had now taken <HI>W—le</HI>; and
begged he would deliver himself like a Man of this World.</P>
<P>He then related the Proposal afore∣mentioned, on which I
desired two Days time to consider, and then acquiesced, and withdrew the
Appeal, like an easy Fool as I was.</P>
<P>Dearly have I since repented it, as no Articles of the Agreement
were kept, altho' I thought they were as strongly assured to me, as the
Law could make them; in which there are so many Loop-holes, that even
Persons conversant with it may be de∣ceived; how then should a Female be
sufficiently on her Guard, against the Pro∣fessors of a kind of
unintelligible Jargon, whose Skill is to puzzle the Cause, or a Science
where, 
<Q> 
<L>Endless Tautologies and Doubts perplex;</L> 
<L>Too harsh a Study for our softer Sex!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="274"/>Of the Thirty Pounds, I never received but
Fifteen, and those Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> as∣sured me he advanced out of
his own Pocket, and never was paid, as I can prove under his own Hand.</P>
<P>But Heav'n knows, as I had every thing to provide for a Child, and
myself, and Rent also to pay, this Sum lasted not long, especially as I
had no Friend near me.—No; nor any honest Person; for my Landlady, of
whom before I had conceived a good Opinion, when she found I was in Labour,
insisted either on my paying double the Rent I had engaged for, or quitting
her House, which, as it was then too late for me to do, I was
necessitated to comply with her exorbitant Demand, which made her very
complaisant.</P>
<P>Before I had received even this small Re∣lief I wrote to many
Ladies, to whom my Father had been Physician, and who once seemed to be my
Friends; but to no pur∣pose; their constant Answer was, that I deserved
nothing; to which general Rule, I never met with but two Exceptions.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="275"/>I wrote also to the B—p of
<HI>C—,</HI> who after long Deliberation, picked out of his Purse half
a Piece, which extraordinary Bounty, he by the Force of Imagination doubled;
and also declared that I had sent to him for it, a Woman who had been whipt
thro' the Town; who, as she really was a Gentlewoman of good Character, but
of low Fortune, had it not been for my Persuasion to the contrary, would
have sued his L—p for Defamation.</P>
<P>But as he was so kind to give my Son, who is his God-son, Five
Shillings in small Change in <HI>London,</HI> which he told the Youth was a
Crown Piece, who knowing there was such a Coin as a Five Shilling Piece of
Gold, searched amongst the Half∣pence narrowly to find it, tho' without
Success, I think I must pardon him; espe∣cially, as on my threatning to
expose him since I came to <HI>Ireland,</HI> he, to bribe me to Secrecy,
sent me one Pound, a remark∣able and unaccountable Charity from his
Lordship, to any Person of whom he had not Carnal Knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="276"/>And tho' in a Letter of his, he assures
me he desires no public Praise for what he has done, and makes as long and
learned a Disquisition between the Law of our Mem∣bers and the Law of our
Minds, as he once did between <HI>Graminervous</HI> and <HI>Carniverous,</HI>
which, as I do not understand <HI>Latin,</HI> I may very possibly
mispel, tho' their Signi∣fication is, I believe, Grass or Flesh
de∣vouring Animals; of the later of which, I believe his L—p would make
the best Meal. The antient Priests were never permitted to burn Flesh,
but as a Sacrifice to the Almighty; but it is reported, that one of them
turning a Stake, when it was a little too hot, burned his Finger, on which he
licked it, and found it so savory, that he devoured that part which was
intended for the Gods; and as the Laity beheld him, to their Opinion, breaking
the Law in eating Flesh, he assured them, that he had an immediate
Revelation, that it was lawful for him to eat the prime Part of the Flesh,
and leave the Garbage for the Laity. Thus we may see how early Priestcraft
began; from the very first, they were Flesh∣mongers; <PB N="270" REF="277"/>
and Priests of all Religions are the same. Those who want to look farther
into the Deceits of Priesthood, may trace it up even to the <HI>Nile,</HI>
from whence Su∣perstition and the Crocodile first sprung, both alike
destructive to Mankind.</P>
<P>It is known to every learned Divine, that the Priests
engrossed the whole Country of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as the eldest Son of every
Priest was born a Priest, and was therefore in∣titled to a tenth part of
the Land; upon which <HI>Joseph,</HI> who was not only an admir∣able Man but
an excellent Politician, and had a Divine Revelation that the Land should
suffer Famine ten Years, ordered the Priests to pay in all their
Subsidies to the King, whereby, in those ten Years of Dearth, the King
purchased, at so low a Rate as giving the People a little Corn, all the
Lands in <HI>Egypt.</HI> These are Remarks of the ad∣mirable Lord
<HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> whose inimitable Style and clear Manner of Reasoning
carry Conviction with them.</P>
<P>I never knew any Clergyman who quoted him but to his Prejudice,
except Dr. <HI>Turn∣bull:</HI> And yet I cannot see why Morality, 
<PB N="271" REF="278"/> or the Preaching of it, should in any wise be
offensive to a Christian; since there is a certain Beauty in Holiness,
which, tho' it were never to be hereafter rewarded, gives a sincere
Satisfaction and Quietude of Mind in this Life,—And therefore Virtue does
still, 
<Q> 
<L>With Scorn the mercenary World regard,</L> 
<L>Where sordid Minds do Good, and hope Reward,</L> 
<L>Above the worthless Trophies Men can raise</L> 
<L>She seeks not Honour, Fame, or empty Praise,</L> 
<L>But with herself, herself the Goddess pays.</L></Q> All
I would infer from this rambling Di∣gression is, 
<Q> 
<L>That Authority, tho' it errs like other,</L> 
<L>Bears yet a kind of Medicine in itself,</L> 
<L>To skin the Sore on the Top.</L></Q> And that Subtilty and
Avarice have been almost inseparable from the Priesthood ever since the
World began.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="279"/>But to return. Having at length passed
the Pain and Peril of Child-birth, by the Care and Humanity of Dr.
<HI>Arbuckle,</HI> I was in great Distress. It is true, Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> kindly advised me to leave my Child, which was a Female
one, upon the Parish; and as he would willingly have done the same, or
worse, to those whose Legitimacy he never questioned, I had the less
Reason to blame him; but such a Piece of Inhumani∣ty I from Soul abhorred,
nor could any thing prevail on me to put it in practice.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> went to <HI>Mallow,</HI> where at his
Request I sent to him the following Poems.

</LG></Q></P>
<P>Who wrote those Lines I know not; but as I am certain the Author
need not blush to acknowledge them, I hope he will not only pardon my Vanity
in making them public, but also subscribe to my Writings.</P>
<P>I can only assure the World, I believe Mr. <HI>W—le</HI>
never wrote a poetical Line in his Life; and therefore I am indebted to some
humane and ingenuous Person, who, supposing me guilty, makes an almost
di∣vine Apology for me.</P>
<P>But as it was impossible for me to subsist meerly on
Praise, I made one strong Effort <PB N="281" REF="288"/> to deliver myself
out of Calamity, which was, to beg Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> to send me some
Money, to bear my Expences to <HI>London,</HI> assuring him I was weary of
<HI>Ireland</HI>; which indeed was true: for I am of the same O∣pinion with
the pleasant Lady <HI>Dorchester,</HI> that <HI>Dublin</HI> is a Place of
the least Sin, and the most Scandal, of any City in the World.</P>

<P>Wou'd it were otherwise, my Lord; that my Means were
greater, and my Waist slenderer.</P>
</SP></Q> This Text wants no Comment.</P>
<P>But if my learned Husband will oblige me with one, I shall be
his very humble Servant. He has threatened to give a true and impartial
Narrative of my Proceedings to the Public; and I wonder why he, who rides so
fast, has not got the Whip-hand <PB N="282" REF="289"/> of me: I fear his

<P>I am a sad digressive Writer; by which my Readers may
plainly perceive I am no Methodist.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> agreed to my Proposal; and as he was
fully determined never to give me any more, sent me nine Pounds, for which,
as he said, he sold my Diamond Ring to Mrs. <HI>Dubourg,</HI> and the Chain
of my Watch, which cost six Guineas, to Mrs. <HI>W—rr—n,</HI>
for the Promise of forty Shil∣lings; for which I suppose Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI> and she have since accounted. A good-na∣tured Man will
easily be satisfied with a <PB N="283" REF="290"/> Lady that will return him
a Toy for a Trinket.</P>
<P>Nothing that ever she got vexed me so much as Mr.
<HI>P—n</HI>'s giving her my Fa∣ther's Snuff-box, which he borrowed from
me, under Pretence, that taking a little Snuff preserved him from catching
Sickness in Places he was obliged to go to. He de∣clared to me he had lost
it; but I after∣wards saw it with her, as also several other Things
belonging to me.</P>
<P>But he is not the first Man who has plun∣dered his Wife to
oblige his —. As this Lady was, I may say, the principal Cause of a
Separation between the Parson and me, I thought I had a Right to de∣mand a
Subscription from her; which, since my Return to <HI>Ireland,</HI> I did in
very civil Terms. And I think myself in Duty bound to give my learned Readers
a Taste of her excellent Style, in answer to me.

which, if they doubt, I can produce it in the Lady's own Scrawl. This Lady
sent a Captain of a Ship to me, when she heard I was going for

stay in it six Months longer than I intended. And having not yet done with
her, I can∣not forbear remarking that one <HI>L—ty,</HI> a Painter, a
rude Fellow, a few Nights after my Separation from the Parson, took the 
<PB N="285" REF="292"/> Liberty, on not readily finding him in his own House,
of breaking open his Bed-chamber Door, to which the Maid pointed, where the

spoiling Sport;

<Q><PB N="291" REF="298"/>

<HEAD>To the Honourable Mr. ****.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ADMIRE not, if the grateful Muse,</L>

<P>At the Gentleman's own Request I omit his Name; but when I say
he is the elder Brother of the greatest Man in this King∣dom, he may,
perhaps, be guessed at.</P>

sent him the following

<P>Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> had the Conscience to write to me, to
desire I would, by the Re∣turn of the Post, send him a hundred Bal∣lads
of my own Composition, as he had al∣ready begun to take in Subscriptions
for them; and on the Receipt of them, he would order a Gentleman to pay me two
Guineas. I suppose he thought I could write as fast as the Poet, whom
<HI>Horace</HI> de∣scribes standing on one Leg, while he wrote a thousand
Lines: And because I was un∣able to comply with this Request, he sent me
the following most strange Epistle. 
<LETTER>
<PB N="295" REF="302"/>
<HEAD>To Mrs. <HI>P—N.</HI></HEAD>
<P>D—N you! sink you! G—d fire you! I have beggared
myself be∣tween your scoundrel Husband and you, all to support a little
dirty Vanity. When I want any thing from him, his d—ned Spirits are
sunk: Nor has he given me any think worth a Farthing, for the mon∣strous
Sums he has drawn out of me. I could write before I ever saw either of your
ugly Faces, tho' not quite so well—and d—n me, if I ever write
another Line of Verse—You understand me—I shall be in Town,
so as to meet the P—t. The Eyes of all <HI>Europe</HI> are on me, and
d—n me, if you do not send me the Ballads, but I will despise, and
defy you for ever.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, J. W.</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<PB N="296" REF="303"/>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> By G—, I cannot stir out, for my
Landlady has beat me through the Town with a hot Shoulder of Mut∣ton, which
she snatched from the Fire, Spit and all, only for catching me a little
familiar with her Daughter.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I concluded by this Letter, that the poor Man's Head was turned,
and therefore, thought it not worth answering, being now seriously
determined to leave <HI>Ireland</HI>; for, though I led the Life of a
Recluse, I had every Day some new Story invented of me. If I went out to
take a little Air, they said, I had great Impudence to shew my Face; and if
I staid at Home, I was then in Keep∣ing with some Man who confined me; and,
in short, I could please nobody: Which gave rise to the following Lines. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>EXPOSTULATION.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>O God! since all thy Ways are just,</L>
<L>Why does thy heavy Hand</L>
<L>So sore afflict the wretched Dust,</L>
<L>Thou didst to Life command?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="297" REF="304" MS="y"/>
<L>Thou speak'st the Word, the senseless Clay</L>
<L>Was quick'ned with thy Breath,</L>
<L>Chearless to view the Beams of Day,</L>
<L>And seek the Shades of Death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' ev'ry Scene of Life distress'd,</L>
<L>As Daughter, Mother, Wife;</L>
<L>When wilt thou close my Eyes in Rest,</L>
<L>And take my weary Life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To the past, present, and to come,</L>
<L>Are ever-more the same;</L>
<L>Thou knew'st of all my Woes the Sum,</L>
<L>'Ere I my Thoughts cou'd frame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas thou gav'st Passion to my Soul,</L>
<L>And Reason also gave,</L>
<L>Why didst thou not make Reason rule,</L>
<L>And Passion be its Slave?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O pardon me, thou Pow'r Divine!</L>
<L>That thus I dare presume</L>
<L>At thy Correction to repine,</L>
<L>Or murmur at my Doom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="298" REF="305"/>
<L>Lord, give me Penitence sincere</L>
<L>For ev'ry Error past,</L>
<L>And tho' my Trials are severe,</L>
<L>O give me Peace at last.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>So these were the last Strains I sung in <HI>Ireland</HI>;
which, ill-used as I was in it, I could not quit without very great Regret;
and as the Coach drove by Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Door, I thought my very
Heart would split with Sorrow; for there indeed was all the Treasure of my
Soul enclosed; namely, my dear little ones. Many a Sigh and Tear they cost
me; many a Prayer did I offer up to the Almighty for their Preservation; and
had he not been an infinitely more gra∣cious Father to them, than their earthly
one proved, long long ago had they been finally lost!</P>
<P>My Eyes, even after I went on board the Yatch, were evermore
turned to the Shore of <HI>Ireland,</HI> resting there as on their last
Period; till finding myself observed, and that some of the
Passengers, Colonel <HI>Dalway</HI> in particular, wanted to see my 
<PB N="299" REF="306"/> Face, which I concealed, I pretended to be Sea-sick,
and desired the Steward to shew me a Cabin.</P>
<P>He left me for a few Minutes; and re∣turning, told me, all the
Beds were en∣gaged; but however, there was a Gentle∣man on board, who said,
he would sooner sit up, than a Lady be unprovided for. I returned my
Compliments, without ever so much as enquiring to whom I was obliged.</P>
<P>The Sickness I feigned proved present∣ly true; for no sooner
was the Ship under Sail, but I grew violently Sea-sick; when the Steward once
more entered the Cabin, and told me, the Gentleman, to whom it belonged,
desired a Moment's Chat with me. I begged him to make my Apology, as indeed,
what with Sickness and Sorrow, I was little in Temper to receive any
Person.</P>
<P>However, the Gentleman resolved not to be so easily
dismissed; for following the Steward into my Cabin, he told me, he knew
me to be Mrs. <HI>P—n</HI>; that, he could not sit up all Night; and
therefore, <PB N="300" REF="307"/> he hoped I would not refuse him the
Li∣berty of sleeping in his own Bed.</P>
<P>I answered, I would not, provided he would be so kind as to
leave me for a few Moments; on which, weak as I was, I sprung out of Bed,
and, as I had not un∣dressed myself, soon met him upon Deck.</P>
<P>Who this fame Gentleman was, may, in due Season, be revealed: I
can only assure my Readers, that, I believe had I accepted of the Offers he
made me, Pover∣ty would never have approached me, as he was a Man of Honour, or
at least ap∣peared to me as such: A Man of Fortune he certainly is; and I
doubt not but he has enjoyed many a lovely Lady, without promising them any
Reward, or offering them a Settlement for Life, as he really did me.</P>
<P>I dined with him at <HI>Parkgate</HI>; and I hope Virtue will be
rewarded; for though I had but five Guineas in the World to carry me up to
<HI>London,</HI> I yet possessed Chastity enough to refuse fifty
for a Night's Lodging, and that too from a handsome well-bred Man, whose
Name if I should <PB N="301" REF="308"/> insert, all the World would
acknowledge I spoke but Truth of him.</P>
<P>I shall scarcely ever forget his Words to me, as they seemed
almost prophetic. 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, Madam, (said he) you do not know
<HI>London</HI>; you will be undone there.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, Sir, (said I) I hope you do not imagine I
will go into any bad Course of Life?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, Madam, (said he) but I think you will sit
in your Chamber, and starve;'</Q> which, upon my Word, I have been pretty
near doing; and, but that the Almighty raised me one worthy Friend, good old
Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> to whose Humanity I am, under God, indebted both for
Liberty and Life, I had been quite lost.</P>
<P>I dare say, nobody will imagine he served me from any carnal
Views; since, 
<Q> 
<L>If Truth in Spite of Manners must be told,</L> 
<L>Why really Seventy-six is something old.</L></Q></P>
<P>So here I close the First Volume; and as it has been
industriously and maliciously <PB N="302" REF="309"/> reported, that I had
in reality nothing to publish, I hope this will convince the World, that Mrs.
<HI>Pilkington</HI> was never yet reduced to the Meanness of Falshood or
Tricking. And if this Volume meets with a favourable Reception, I can
assure my Readers, the next will be infinitely more entertaining, and is
now ready for the Press.</P>
