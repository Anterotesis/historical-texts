<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NATURAL HISTORY, considered in its utmost extent, comprehends
two ob∣jects. First, that of discovering, ascer∣taining, and naming all
the various pro∣ductions of nature. Secondly, that of describing the
properties, manners, and relations, which they bear to us, and to each other.
The first, which is the most difficult part of this science, is
sys∣tematical, dry, mechanical, and incom∣plete. The second is more
amusing, exhibits new pictures to the imagination, and improves our relish
for existence, by widening the prospect of nature around us.</P>
<P>Both, however, are necessary to those who would understand
this pleasing <PB N="ii" REF="3"/> science, in its utmost extent. The
first care of every enquirer, no doubt should be, to see to visit and
examine every object, before he pretends to inspect its habitudes or its
history. From seeing and observing the thing itself, he is most
naturally led to spe∣culate upon its uses, its delights, or its
inconveniences.</P>
<P>Numberless obstructions, however, are found in this part of
his pursuit, that frustrate his diligence and retard his cu∣riosity. The
objects in nature are so many, and even those of the same kind are
exhibited in such a variety of forms, that the enquirer finds himself
lost, in the exuberance before him, and, like a man who attempts to count the
stars unassisted by art, his powers are all distracted in the barren
superfluity.</P>
<P>To remedy this embarrasment, arti∣ficial systems have been
devised, which grouping into masses those parts of nature more nearly
resembling each other, refer the enquirer for the name of the single 
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/> object he desires to know to some one of those
general distributions, where it is to be found by further examination.</P>
<P>If, for instance, a man should, in his walks, meet with an
animal, the name, and consequently the history of which, he desires to
know, he is taught by syste∣matic writers of natural history, to ex∣amine
its most obvious qualities, whether a quadrupede, a bird, a fish, or an
insect. Having determined it, for ex∣planation sake, to be an insect, he
exa∣mines whether it has wings; if he finds it possessed of these, he
is taught to ex∣amine whether it has two or four; if possessed of four,
he is taught to observe, whether the two upper wings are of a shelly
hardness, and serve as cases to those under them; if he finds the wings
composed in this manner, he is then taught to pronounce, that this insect
is one of the beetle kind: of the beetle kind, there are three different
classes, distinguished from each other by their feelers; he examines
the insect before <PB N="iv" REF="5"/> him, and finds that the feelers are
clavated or knobbed at the ends; of beetles, with feelers thus formed, there
are ten kinds; and among those, he is taught to look for the precise name
of that which is before him. If, for in∣stance, the knob be divided at the
ends, and the belly be streaked with white, it is no other than the Dor or
the May∣bug; an animal, the noxious qualities of which give it a very
distinguished rank in the history of the insect creation. In this
manner a system of natural history may, in some measure, be compared
to a dictionary of words. Both are solely intended to explain the names of
things; but with this difference, that in the dic∣tionary of words we are led
from the name of the thing to its definition; whereas in the system of
natural history, we are led from the definition to find out the name.</P>
<P>Such are the efforts of writers, who have composed their works
with great labour and ingenuity, to direct the learner in his <PB N="v" REF="6"/> progress through nature, and to inform him of the name of every
animal, plant, or fossil substance, that he happens to meet with; but
it would be only deceiving the reader, to conceal the truth, which is, that
books alone can never teach him this art in perfection; and the solitary
student can never succeed. Without a master, and a previous knowledge of
many of the ob∣jects in nature, his book will only serve to confound and
disgust him. Few of the individual plants or animals, that he may happen to
meet with, are in that precise state of health, or that exact period of
vegetation, from whence their descrip∣tions were taken. Perhaps he meets the
plant only with leaves, but the systematic writer has described it in
flower. Per∣haps he meets the bird before it has moulted its first feathers,
while the syste∣matic description was made in its state of full
perfection. He thus ranges with∣out an instructor, confused and with
sickening curiosity from subject to sub∣ject, till at last he gives
up the pursuit, <PB N="vi" REF="7"/> in the multiplicity of his
disappoint∣ments.</P>
<P>Some practice therefore, much instruc∣tion and diligent reading
are requisite to make a ready and expert naturalist, who shall be able,
even by the help of a system, to find out the name of every object he meets
with. But when this tedious, though requisite part of study is attained,
nothing but delight and variety attend the rest of his journey. Wherever he
travels, like a man in a country where he has many friends, he meets with
nothing but acquaintances and al∣lurements in all the stages of his way. The
meer uninformed spectator passes on in gloomy solitude; but the
naturalist, in every plant, in every insect, and every pebble, finds
something to entertain his curiosity, and excite his speculation.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that a system may be considered as a
dictionary in the study of nature. The ancients, however, who have all
written most delightfully on this subject, seem entirely to have rejected
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/> those humble and mechanical helps to science. They
contented themselves with seizing upon the great outlines of history, and
passing over what was common, as not worth the detail; they only dwelt upon
what was new, great, and sur∣prising, and sometimes even warmed the
imagination at the expence of truth. Such of the moderns as revived this
science in Europe undertook the task more methodically, though not in a
man∣ner so pleasing. Aldrovandus, Gesner, and Johnson, seemed
desirous of uniting the entertaining and rich descriptions of the ancients
with the dry and sys∣tematic arrangement, of which they were the first
projectors. This attempt, however, was extremely imperfect, as the great
variety of nature was, as yet, but very inadequately known. Nevertheless, by
attempting to carry on both objects at once; first, of directing us to the
name, of the thing; and then, giving the detail of its history, they drew out
their works into a tedious and unreasonable length; <PB N="viii" REF="9"/> and
thus mixing incompatible aims they have left their labours, rather to be
oc∣casionally consulted than read with de∣light by posterity.</P>
<P>The later moderns, with that good sense which they have
carried into every other part of science, have taken a diffe∣rent method in
cultivating natural history. They have been content to give, not only the
brevity, but also the dry and disgusting air of a dictionary to their
systems. Ray, Klin, Brisson, and Linnaeus, have had only one aim, that
of pointing out the object in nature, of discovering its name, and where it
was to be found in those au∣thors that treated of it in a more prolix and
satisfactory manner. Thus na∣tural history at present is carried on, in
two distinct and separate channels, the one serving to lead us to the
thing, the other conveying the history of the thing, as supposing it
already known.</P>
<P>The following Natural History is writ∣ten, with only such an
attention to sys∣tem as serves to remove the reader's
em∣barrassments, <PB N="ix" REF="10"/> and allure him to proceed. It can
make no pretensions in directing him to the name of every object he meets
with; that belongs to works of a very different kind, and written with very
different aims. It will fully answer my design, if the reader, being
already possest of the name of any animal, shall find here a short,
though satisfactory his∣tory of its habitudes, its subsistence, its
manners, its friendships and hostilities. My aim has been to carry on
just as much method, as was sufficient to shorten my descriptions by
generalizing them, and never to follow order where the art of writing, which is
but another name for good sense, informed me that it would only contribute
to the reader's embarrass∣ment.</P>
<P>Still, however, the reader will perceive, that I have formed a
kind of system in the history of every part of animated na∣ture,
directing myself by the great ob∣vious distinctions that she herself
seems to have made, which, though too few to <PB N="x" REF="11"/> point
exactly to the name, are yet suffi∣cient to illuminate the subject, and
re∣move the reader's perplexity. Mr. Buf∣fon, indeed, who has brought greater
talents to this part of learning than any other man, has almost entirely
reject∣ed method in classing quadrupedes. This, with great deference to
such a character, appears to me running into the opposite extreme; and, as
some mo∣derns have of late spent much time, great pains, and some
learning, all to very little purpose, in systematic ar∣rangement, he
seems so much disgusted by their trifling, but ostentatious efforts,
that he describes his animals, almost in the order they happen to come
before him. This want of method seems to be a fault; but he can lose little
by a cri∣ticism which every dull man can make, or by an error in arrangement,
from which the dullest are the most usually free.</P>
<P>In other respects, as far as this able philosopher has gone, I
have taken <PB N="xi" REF="12"/> him for my guide. The warmth of his style,
and the brilliancy of his imagina∣tion, are inimitable. Leaving him there∣fore
without a rival in these, and only availing myself of his information, I
have been content to describe things in my own way; and though many of the
materials are taken from him, yet I have added, retrenched, and altered, as I
thought proper. It was my intention at one time, whenever I differed from him,
to have mentioned it at the bottom of the page; but this occured so often,
that I soon found it would look like envy, and might perhaps, convict me of
those very errors which I was wanting to lay upon him. I have therefore, as
being every way his debtor, concealed my dissent, where my opinion was
different; but wherever I borrow from him, I take care at the bottom of the
page to express my obligations. But though my obliga∣tions to this writer are
many, they extend but to the smallest part of the work, as he has hitherto
compleated only the his∣tory <PB N="xii" REF="13"/> of quadrupedes. I was
therefore left to my own reading alone, to make out the history of birds,
fishes and insects, of which the arrangement was so difficult, and the
necessary information so widely diffused and so obscurely related
when found, that it proved by much the most laborious part of the
undertaking. Thus having made use of Mr. Buf∣fon's lights in the first part
of the work, I may, with some share of confidence, recommend it to the
public. But what shall I say to that part, where I have been entirely left
without his assistance? As I would affect neither modesty nor
confi∣dence, it will be sufficient to say, that my reading upon this part
of the subject has been very extensive; and that I have taxed my scanty
circumstances in procuring books which are on this subject, of all others,
the most expensive. In conse∣quence of this industry, I here offer a
work to the public, of a kind, which has never been attempted in ours, or any
other modern language, that I know <PB N="xiii" REF="14"/> of. The ancients,
indeed, and Pliny in particular, have anticipated me, in the present manner
of treating natural history. Like those historians who describe the
e∣vents of a campaign, they have not conde∣scended to give the private
particulars of every individual that formed the army; they were content with
characterizing the ge∣nerals, and describing their operations, while they
left it to meaner hands to carry the muster-roll. I have followed their
manner, rejecting the numerous fables which they adopted, and adding the
improvements of the moderns, which are so numerous, that they actually make
up the bulk of natural history.</P>
<P>The delight which I found in reading Pliny, first inspired me
with the idea of a work of this nature. Having a taste rather classical
than scientific, and hav∣ing but little employed myself in turn∣ing over
the dry labours of modern system-makers, my earliest intention was to
translate this agreeable writer, and by the help of a commentary to make 
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"/> my work as amusing as I could. Let us dignify natural
history never so much with the grave appellation of a useful science,
yet still we must confess that it is the occupation of the idle and the
speculative, more than of the busy and the ambitious part of mankind. My
inten∣tion therefore was to treat what I then conceived to be an idle
subject, in an idle manner; and not to hedge round plain and simple
narratives with hard words, accu∣mulated distinctions, ostentatious
learning, and disquisitions that produced no convic∣tion. Upon the
appearance however of Mr. Buffon's work, I dropped my former plan, and adopted
the present, being con∣vinced by his manner, that the best imita∣tion of
the ancients was to write from our own feelings, and to imitate nature.</P>
<P>It will be my chief pride therefore, if this work may be found an
innocent amusement for those who have nothing else to employ them, or who
require a relaxation from labour. Professed natu∣ralists will, no doubt,
find it superficial; <PB N="xv" REF="16"/> and yet I should hope that even
these will discover hints, and remarks, gleaned from various reading, not
wholly trite or elementary. I would wish for their approbation. But my chief
ambition is to drag up the obscure and gloomy learning of the cell to open
inspection; to strip it from its garb of austerity, and to shew the
beauties of that form, which only the industrious and the inquisitive have
been hitherto permitted to approach.</P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. A Sketch of the Universe.</HEAD>
<P>THE world may be considered as one vast mansion, where man has
been admitted to enjoy, to admire, and to be grateful. The first desires of
savage nature are merely to gratify the importunities of sensual
appetite, and to neglect the contemplation of things, barely satisfied with
their enjoyment: the beauties of nature, and all the wonders of creation, have
but little charms for a being taken up in obviat∣ing the wants of the day, and
anxious for pre∣carious subsistence.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="20"/>Our philosophers, therefore, who have
testi∣fied such surprize at the want of curiosity in the ignorant,
seem not to consider that they are usually employed in making
provisions of a more important nature; in providing rather for the
necessities than the amusements of life. It is not till our more
pressing wants are suffi∣ciently supplied, that we can attend to the
calls of curiosity; so that in every age scientific refinement has been
the latest effort of human industry.</P>
<P>But human curiosity, though, at first, slowly excited, being
at last possessed of leisure for indulging its propensity,
becomes one of the greatest amusements of life, and gives higher
satisfactions than what even the senses can afford. A man of this
disposition turns all nature into a magnificent theatre, replete with
objects of wonder and surprize, and fitted up chiefly for his happiness and
entertainment: he industri∣ously examines all things, from the minutest
insect to the most finished animal; and, when his limited organs can no
longer make the dis∣quisition, he sends out his imagination upon new
enquiries.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, can be more august and striking than the
idea which his reason, aided by his imagination, furnishes of the
universe <PB N="3" REF="21"/> around him. Astronomers tell us, that this
earth which we inhabit forms but a very minute part in that great
assemblage of bodies of which the world is composed. It is a million of
times less than the sun, by which it is enlightened. The planets also,
which, like it, are subordinate to the sun's influence, exceed the earth
one thousand times in magnitude. These, which were at first supposed
to wander in the heavens without any fixed path, and that took their name from
their apparent deviations, have long been found to perform their circuits with
great exactness and strict regularity. They have been discovered as
forming with our earth a system of bodies circulating round the sun, all
obedient to one law, and impelled by one common influence.</P>
<P>Modern philosophy has taught us to be∣lieve, that, when the great
Author of nature began the work of creation, he chose to ope∣rate by second
causes; and, that, suspending the constant exertion of his power, he
endued matter with a quality by which the universal oeconomy of nature might
be continued with∣out his immediate assistance. This quality is called
<HI>attraction</HI>; a sort of approximating influ∣ence, which all bodies,
whether terrestrial or celestial, are found to possess; and which in
all <PB N="4" REF="22"/> encreases as the quantity of matter in each
en∣creases. The sun, by far the greatest body in our system, is, of
consequence, possest of much the greatest share of this attracting
power; and all the planets, of which our earth is one, are, of course,
entirely subject to its superior influence. Were this power, therefore,
left uncontrolled by any other, the sun must quickly have attracted all the
bodies of our celestial system to itself; but it is equably
counteracted by another power of equal efficacy; namely, a progressive
force which each planet received when it was impelled forward, by the divine
architect, upon its first formation. The heavenly bodies of our system
being thus acted upon by two opposing powers; namely, by that of
<HI>attraction,</HI> which draws them towards the sun; and that of
<HI>impulsion,</HI> which drives them strait forward into the great void of
space; they pursue a track between these contrary direc∣tions; and each,
like a stone whirled about in a sling, obeying two opposite forces,
circulates round its great centre of heat and motion.</P>
<P>In this manner, therefore, is the harmony of our planetary
system preserved. The sun, in the midst, gives heat, and light, and
circular motion to the planets which surround it: Mercury, Venus, the Earth,
Mars, Jupiter, <PB N="5" REF="23"/> and Saturn, perform their constant
circuits at different distances, each taking up a time to compleat its
revolutions proportioned to the greatness of the circle which it is to
de∣scribe. The lesser planets also, which are attend∣ants upon some
of the greater, are subject to the same laws; they circulate with the
same exactness; and are, in the same manner, influ∣enced by their
respective centres of motion.</P>
<P>Besides those bodies which make a part of our peculiar
system, and which may be said to reside within its great circumference;
there are others, that frequently come among us, from the most distant
tracts of space, and that seem like dangerous intruders upon the beau∣tiful
simplicity of nature. These are comets, whose appearance was once so
terrible to man∣kind, and the theory of which is so little understood at
present: all we know, is, that their number is much greater than that of the
planets; and that, like these, they roll in orbits, in some measure,
obedient to Solar influence. Astronomers have endeavoured to calculate the
returning periods of many of them; but expe∣rience has not, as yet, confirmed
the veracity of their investigations: indeed, who can tell when those
wanderers have made their excursions into other worlds and distant
systems, what <PB N="6" REF="24"/> obstacles may be found to oppose
their progress, to accelerate their motions, or retard their re∣turn?</P>
<P>But what we have hitherto attempted to sketch, is but a small
part of that great fabric in which the Deity has thought proper to manifest
his wisdom and omnipotence. There are multitudes of other bodies disperst
over the face of the heavens that lie too remote for ex∣amination: these have
no motion, such as the planets are found to possess, and are,
therefore, called fixed stars; and from their extreme brilliancy and their
immense distance, philoso∣phers have been induced to suppose them to
be suns resembling that which enlivens our system: as the imagination
also, once exited, is seldom content to stop, it has furnished each
with an attendant system of planets belonging to itself, and has even
induced some to deplore the fate of those systems, whose imagined
suns, which sometimes happens, have become no longer visible.</P>
<P>But conjectures of this kind, which no reasoning can ascertain,
nor experiment reach, are rather amusing than useful. Though we see the
greatness and wisdom of the Deity in all the seeming worlds that
surround us, it is our chief concern to trace him in that which 
<PB N="7" REF="25"/> we inhabit. The examination of the earth, the wonders of
its contrivance, the history of its advantages, or of the seeming defects
in its for∣mation, are the proper business of the <HI>natural
historian.</HI> A description of this earth, its <HI>animals,
vegetables,</HI> and <HI>minerals,</HI> is the most delightful entertainment
the mind can be fur∣nished with, as it is the most interesting and
useful. I would beg leave, therefore, to con∣clude these common-place
speculations, with an observation, which, I hope, is not entirely so.</P>
<P>An use, hitherto not much insisted upon, that may result
from the contemplation of celestial magnificence, is, that it will teach us
to make an allowance for the apparent irregularities we find below. Whenever we
can examine the works of the Deity at a proper point of distance, so as to
take in the whole of his design, we see nothing but uniformity, beauty, and
precision. The heavens present us with a plan, which, though
inexpressibly magnificent, is yet regular beyond the power of invention.
Whenever, therefore, we find any apparent defects in the earth, which we are
about to consider, instead of attempting to reason ourselves into an
opi∣nion that they are beautiful, it will be wiser to say, that we do not
behold them at the proper <PB N="8" REF="26"/> point of distance, and that our
eye is laid too close to the objects to take in the regularity of their
connexion. In short, we may conclude, that God, who is regular in his great
produc∣tions, acts with equal uniformity in the little.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. A short Survey of the Globe, from the Light of
Astronomy and Geography.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the sciences are in some measure linked with each other,
and before the one is ended the other begins. In a natural history,
there∣fore, of the earth, we must begin with a short account of its
situation and form, as given us by astronomers and geographers: it will be
sufficient, however, upon this occasion, just to hint to the imagination,
what they, by the most abstract reasonings, have forced upon the
un∣derstanding. The earth which we inhabit is, as has been said before, one
of those bodies which circulate in our solar system; it is placed at an
happy middle distance from the centre; and even seems, in this respect,
privi∣leged beyond all other planets that depend upon our great luminary for
their support. Less distant from the sun than Saturn, Jupiter, 
<PB N="9" REF="27"/> and Mars, and yet less parched up than Venus and Mercury,
that are situate too near the vio∣lence of its power, the earth seems in a
peculiar manner to share the bounty of the Creator: it is not, therefore,
without reason that man∣kind consider themselves as the peculiar objects
of his providence and regard.</P>
<P>Besides that motion which the earth has round the sun, the
circuit of which is per∣formed in a year, it has another upon its own axle,
which it performs in twenty-four hours. Thus, like a chariot-wheel, it has a
compound motion; for while it goes forward on its journey, it is all the while
turning upon itself. From the first of these two arise the grateful
vicissitude of the seasons; from the second, that of day and
night.</P>
<P>It may be also readily conceived, that a body thus wheeling in
circles will most pro∣bably be itself a sphere. The earth, beyond all
possibility of doubt, is found to be so. Whenever its shadow happens to
fall upon the moon, in an eclipse, it appears to be always circular, in
whatever position it is projected: and it is easy to prove, that a body
which in every position makes a circular shadow, must itself be round.
The rotundity of the earth may be also proved from the meeting of two ships
at sea: the top <PB N="10" REF="28"/> masts of each are the first parts
that are disco∣vered by both, the under parts being hidden by the convexity
of the globe which rises between them. The ships in this instance may be
resembled to two men who approach each other on the opposite sides of an
hill: their heads will first be seen, and gradually as they come nearer
they will come entirely into view.</P>
<P>However, though the earth's figure is said to be spherical, we
ought only to conceive it as being nearly so. It has been found in the last
age to be rather flatted at both poles, so that its form is commonly
resembled to that of a turnep. The cause of this swelling of the equator
is ascribed to the greater rapidity of the motion with which the parts of the
earth are there carried round; and which, consequently, endeavouring to fly
off, act in opposition to central attraction. The twirling of a mop may
serve as an homely illustration; which, as every one has seen, spreads
and grows broader in the middle as it continues to be turned round.</P>
<P>As the earth receives light and motion from the sun, so it
derives much of its warmth and power of vegetation from the same beneficent
source. However, the different parts of the globe participate of these
advantages in very <PB N="11" REF="29"/> different proportions, and accordingly
put on very different appearances; a polar prospect, and a landscape at the
equator, are as opposite in their appearances as in their situation.</P>
<P>The polar regions, that receive the solar beams in a very oblique
direction, and that con∣tinue for one half of the year in night, receive but
few of the genial comforts that other parts of the world enjoy. Nothing can be
more mournful or hideous than the picture which travellers present of those
wretched regions. The ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Crantz's history
of Greenland, p. 3.</BIBL></NOTE>, which is rocky and barren, rears itself in
every place in lofty mountains and inaccessible cliffs, and meets the
mariner's eye at even forty leagues from shore. These precipices, frightful
in themselves, receive an additional horror from being constantly covered
with ice and snow, which daily seem to ac∣cumulate and to fill all the
vallies with encreas∣ing desolation. The few rocks and cliffs, that are
bare of snow, look at a distance of a dark brown colour, and quite naked.
Upon a nearer approach, however, they are found re∣plete with many different
veins of coloured stone, and here and there spread over with a little
earth, and a scanty portion of grass and heath. The internal parts of the
country are <PB N="12" REF="30"/> still more desolate and deterring. In
wandering this solitude, some plains appear covered with ice, that, at
first glance, seem to promise the traveller an easy journey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Crantz's history of Greenland, p. 22.</BIBL></NOTE>, But
these are even more formidable and more unpassable than the mountains
themselves, being cleft with dreadful chasms, and every where abounding
with pits that threaten certain destruction. The seas that surround
these inhospitable coasts, are still more astonishing, being
covered with flakes of floating ice, that spread like extensive fields, or
that rise out of the water like enormous mountains. These, which are
composed of materials as clear and transparent as glass<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid. 27.</BIBL></NOTE>, assume many strange and
phantastic appearances. Some of them look like churches or castles, with
pointed turrets; some like ships in full sail; and people have often
given themselves the fruitless toil to attempt piloting the imagi∣nary
vessels into harbour. There are still others that appear like large
islands, with plains, valleys, and hills, which often rear their heads two
hundred yards above the level of the sea; and although the height of these
be amazing, yet their depth beneath is still more so; some of them being
found to sink three hundred fathom under water.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="31"/>The earth presents a very different
appear∣ance at the equator, where the sun-beams, darting directly downwards,
burn up the lighter soils into extensive sandy desarts, or quicken all
the moister tracts with incredible vegetation. In these regions, almost
all the same inconveni∣encies are felt from the proximity of the sun, that
in the former were endured from its ab∣sence. The desarts are entirely
barren except where they are found to produce serpents, and that in such
quantities, that some extensive plains seem almost entirely covered
with them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Adanson's Description of
Senegal.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It not unfrequently happens also that this dry soil, which is
so parched and comminuted by the force of the sun, rises with the
smallest breeze of wind; and the sands being composed of parts almost
as small as those of water, they assume a similar appearance, rolling
onward in waves like those of a troubled sea, and over∣whelming all they
meet with inevitable destruc∣tion. On the other hand, those tracts which
are fertile, teem with vegetation even to a noxious degree. The grass rises
to such an height as often to require burning; the forests are
impassable from underwoods, and so matted above, that even the sun,
fierce as it is, can seldom penetrate<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Amaenit. vol. vi. p. 67.</BIBL></NOTE>. These are
so thick as <PB N="14" REF="32"/> scarce to be extirpated; for the tops
being so bound together by the climbing plants that grow round them, though
an hundred should be cut at the bottom, yet not one would fall, as they
mutually support each other. In these dark and tangled forests, beasts
of various kinds, insects in astonishing abundance, and serpents of
surprizing magnitude, find a quiet retreat from man, and are seldom
disturbed except by each other.</P>
<P>In this manner the extremes of our globe seem equally unfitted for
the comforts and con∣veniencies of life; and, although the imagina∣tion may
find an awful pleasure in contemplat∣ing the frightful precipices of
Greenland, or the luxurious verdure of Africa, yet true happi∣ness can only
be found in the more moderate climates, where the gifts of nature may be
enjoyed without incurring danger in obtaining them.</P>
<P>It is in the temperate zone, therefore, that all the arts of
improving nature, and refining upon happiness, have been invented: and this
part of the earth is, more properly speaking, the theatre of natural
history. Although there be millions of animals and vegetables in the
unexplored forests under the line, yet most of these may for ever
continue unknown, as <PB N="15" REF="33"/> curiosity is there repressed by
surrounding danger. But it is otherwise in these delight∣ful regions
which we inhabit, and where this art has had its beginning. Among us there is
scarce a shrub, a flower, or an insect, without its particular history;
scarce a plant that could be useful that has not been propagated; nor a
weed that could be noxious which has not been pointed out.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A View of the Surface of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we take a slight survey of the sur∣face of our globe, a
thousand objects offer themselves, which, though long known, yet still
demand our curiosity. The most obvious beauty that every where strikes
the eye is the verdant covering of the earth, which is formed by an happy
mixture of herbs and trees of va∣rious magnitudes and uses. It has been often
remarked that no colour refreshes the sight so well as green; and it may
be added, as a further proof of the assertion, that the inhabitants of
those places where the fields are continually white with snow, generally
become blind long before the usual course of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="34"/>This advantage, which arises from the ver∣dure
of the fields, is not a little improved by their agreeable inequalities. There
is scarce two natural landscapes that offer prospects en∣tirely
resembling each other; their risings and depressions, their hills and
valleys, are never entirely the same, but always offer something new to
entertain and refresh the imagination.</P>
<P>But to encrease the beauties of the face of nature, the
landscape is enlivened by springs and lakes, and intersected by rivulets.
These lend a brightness to the prospect; give motion and coolness to
the air; and, what is much more important, furnish health and
subsistence to animated nature.</P>
<P>Such are the most obvious and tranquil objects that every where
offer: but there are others of a more awful and magnificent kind; the
<HI>Mountain</HI> rising above the clouds, and topt with snow; the
<HI>River</HI> pouring down its sides, encreasing as it runs, and losing
itself, at last, in the ocean; the <HI>Ocean</HI> spreading its immense
sheet of waters over one half of the globe, swelling and subsiding at
well-known intervals, and forming a communication between the most distant
parts of the earth.</P>
<P>If we leave those objects that seem to be natural to our earth,
and keep the same con∣stant <PB N="17" REF="35"/> tenor, we are presented
with the great irre∣gularities of nature. The burning mountain; the abrupt
precipice; the unfathomable cavern; the headlong cataract; and the rapid
whirl∣pool.</P>
<P>If we carry our curiosity a little further, and descend to the
objects immediately below the surface of the globe, we shall there find
wonders still as amazing. We first perceive the earth for the most part
lying in regular beds or layers, every bed growing thicker in proportion as it
lies deeper, and its contents more compact and heavy. We shall find, almost
wherever we make our subterranean en∣quiry, an amazing number of shells
that once belonged to aquatic animals. Here and there, at a distance from the
sea, beds of oyster-shells, several yards thick, and many miles over;
sometimes testaceous substances of various kinds on the tops of
mountains, and often in the heart of the hardest marble. These, which are
dug up by the peasants, in every country, are re∣garded with little
curiosity; for being so very common, they are considered as
substances entirely terrene. But it is otherwise with the enquirer after
nature, who finds them, not only in shape but in substance, every way
resem∣bling those that are bred in the sea; and he, <PB N="18" REF="36"/>
therefore, is at a loss to account for their re∣moval.</P>
<P>Yet not one part of nature alone, but all her productions and
varieties, become the object of the speculative man's enquiry: he takes
different views of nature from the inat∣tentive spectator; and scarce an
appearance, how common soever, but affords matter for his contemplation: he
enquires how and why the surface of the earth has come to have those
risings and depressions which most men call natural; he demands in what
manner the moun∣tains were formed, and in what consist their uses; he
asks from whence springs arise; and how rivers flow round the convexity
of the globe; he enters into an examination of the ebbings and flowings, and
the other wonders of the deep; he acquaints himself with the irregularities
of nature, and he will endeavour to investigate their causes; by which, at
least, he will become better versed in their history. The internal
structure of the globe becomes an object of his curiosity; and, although
his en∣quiries can fathom but a very little way, yet, if possest with a
spirit of theory, his imagination will supply the rest. He will endeavour
to account for the situation of the marine fossils that are found in the
earth, and for the ap∣pearance <PB N="19" REF="37"/> of the different beds of
which it is composed. These have been the enquiries that have splendidly
employed many of the philosophers of the last and present age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, Woodward, Burnet, Whiston, Kircher, Bourquat,
Leibnitz, Steno, Ray, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>; and, to a certain degree, they
must be serviceable. But the worst of it is, that, as speculations
amuse the writer more than facts, they may be often carried to an extravagant
length; and that time may be spent in reasoning upon nature, which might be
more usefully employed in writing her history.</P>
<P>Too much speculation in natural history is certainly wrong; but
there is a defect of an opposite nature that does much more pre∣judice;
namely, that of silencing all enquiry, by alledging the benefits we receive
from a thing, instead of investigating the cause of its production. If I
enquire how a mountain came to be made, such a reasoner, enumerating its
benefits, answers, because God knew it would be useful. If I demand the
cause of an earth∣quake, he finds some good produced by it, and alledges
that as the cause of its explosion. Thus such an enquirer has
constantly some ready reason for every appearance in nature, which
serves to swell his periods, and give splendour <PB N="20" REF="38"/> to
his declamation: every thing about him is, on some account or other, declared
to be good; and he thinks it presumption to scrutinize into its defects, or
to endeavour to imagine how it might be better. Such writers, and there are
many such, add very little to the advancement of knowledge; and it is finely
remarked by Bacon, that the investigation of final causes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">Investigatio causarum finalium sterilis
est, et veluti virgo Deo dedicata, nil parit.</Q></NOTE> is a barren study;
and, like a virgin dedicated to the Deity, brings forth nothing. In fact,
those men who want to compel every appearance and every irregularity in
nature into our service, and ex∣patiate on their benefits, combat that very
morality which they would seem to promote. God has permitted thousands of
natural evils to exist in the world, because it is by their inter∣vention
that man is capable of moral evil; and he has permitted that we should be
subject to moral evil, that we might do something to de∣serve eternal
happiness by shewing that we had rectitude to avoid it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A Review of the different Theories of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>HUMAN invention has been exercised for several ages to account
for the various irregula∣rities of the earth. While those philosophers
mentioned in the last chapter see nothing but beauty, symmetry, and
order; there are others, who look upon the gloomy side of nature, enlarge on
its defects, and seem to consider the earth, on which they tread, as one
scene of ex∣tensive desolation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon's
second discourse.</BIBL></NOTE>. Beneath its surface they observe
minerals and waters confusedly jumbled together; its different beds of earth
irregularly lying upon each other; mountains rising from places that once
were level<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Senec. Quaest. lib. vi. cap.
21.</BIBL></NOTE>; and hills sinking into vallies; whole regions swallowed
by the sea, and others again rising out of its bosom: all these they
suppose to be but a few of the changes that have been wrought in our globe;
and they send out immagination to describe it in its primaeval state of
beauty.</P>
<P>Of those who have written theories describ∣ing the manner of the
original formation of the <PB N="22" REF="40"/> earth, or accounting for its
present appearances, the most celebrated are Burnet, Whiston, Woodward,
and Buffon. As speculation is endless, so it is not to be wondered that
all these differ from each other, and give opposite accounts of the
several changes, which they suppose our earth to have undergone. As the
systems of each have had their admirers, it is, in some measure,
incumbent upon the natural historian to be acquainted, at least, with their
out-lines; and, indeed, to know what others have even dreamed, in matters of
science, is very useful, as it may often prevent us from indulging
similar delusions ourselves, which we should never have adopted, but
be∣cause we take them to be wholly our own. However, as entering into a
detail of these the∣ories, is rather furnishing an history of opinions
than things, I will endeavour to be as concise as I can.</P>
<P>The first who formed this amusement of earth-making into
system was the celebrated Thomas Burnet, a man of polite learning and rapid
immagination. His <HI>Sacred Theory,</HI> as he calls it, describing the
changes which the earth has undergone, or shall hereafter under∣go, is well
known for the warmth with which it is immagined, and the weakness with which
it <PB N="23" REF="41"/> is reasoned, for the elegance of its style, and the
meanness of its philosophy. The earth, says he, before the deluge, was
very differently formed from what it is at present: it was at first a fluid
mass; a chaos composed of various sub∣stances, differing both in
density and figure: those which were most heavy sunk to the center, and
formed in the middle of our globe an hard solid body; those of a lighter
nature remained next; and the waters, which were lighter still, swam upon
its surface, and covered the earth on every side. The air, and all those
fluids which were lighter than water, floated upon this also; and in the
same manner encompassed the globe; so that between the surrounding
body of waters, and the circumambient air, there was formed a coat of oil, and
other unctuous substances, lighter than water. How∣ever, as the air was
still extremely impure, and must have carried up with it many of those
earthly particles with which it once was inti∣mately blended, it soon began
to defecate, and to depose these particles upon the only surface already
mentioned, which soon uniting together, the earth and oil formed that
crust, which soon became an habitable surface, giving life to vegetation,
and dwelling to animals.</P>
<P>This immaginary antideluvian abode was <PB N="24" REF="42"/> very
different from what we see it at present. The earth was light and rich; and
formed of a substance entirely adapted to the feeble state of incipient
vegetation: it was an uni∣form plain, every where covered with verdure; without
mountains, without seas, or the smallest inequalities. It had no
difference of seasons, for its equator was in the plain of the ecliptic,
or, in other words, it turned directly opposite to the sun, so that it
enjoyed one perpetual and luxuriant spring. However, this delightful face of
nature did not long continue the same, for, after a time, it began to crack
and open in fissures; a circumstance which always succeeds when the
sun dries away the moisture from rich or marshy situations. The crimes
of man∣kind had been for some time preparing to draw down the wrath of
Heaven; and they, at length, induced the Deity to defer repairing these
breaches in nature. Thus the chasms of the earth every day became wider, and,
at length, they penetrated to the great abyss of waters; and the whole earth,
in a manner, fell in. Then ensued a total disorder in the uniform beauty of
the first creation, the terrene surface of the globe being broken down: as
it sunk the waters gushed out into its place; the deluge became
universal; all mankind except eight persons <PB N="25" REF="43"/> were
punished with destruction, and their po∣sterity condemned to toil upon
the ruins of desolated nature.</P>
<P>It only remains to mention the manner in which he relieves the earth
from this universal wreck, which would seem to be as difficult as even its
first formation. 
<Q REND="inline">"These great masses of earth falling into the
abyss, drew down with them vast quantities also of air; and by dash∣ing
against each other, and breaking into small parts by the repeated violence
of the shock, they, at length, left between them large cavities filled with
nothing but air. These cavities, naturally offered a bed to receive the
influent waters; and in proportion as they filled, the face of the earth became
once more visible. The higher parts of its broken surface, now become the
tops of mountains, were the first that appeared; the plains soon after came
for∣ward, and, at length, the whole globe was delivered from the waters, except
the places in the lowest situations; so that the ocean and the seas are
still a part of the ancient abyss that have not had a place to return.
Islands and rocks are fragments of the earth's former crust; kingdoms and
continents are larger masses of its broken substance; and all the
inequalities that are to be found on the sur∣face of the present earth, are
owing to the acci∣dental <PB N="26" REF="44"/> confusion into which both earth
and waters were then thrown.</Q></P>
<P>The next theorist was Woodward, who, in his Essay towards a
Natural History of the Earth, which was only designed to precede a greater
work, has endeavoured to give a more rational account of its appearances; and
was, in fact, much better furnished for such an under∣taking than any of
his predecessors, being one of the most assiduous naturalists of
his time. His little book, therefore, contains many im∣portant facts, relative
to natural history, al∣though his system may be weak and
groundless.</P>
<P>He begins by asserting that all terrene sub∣stances are
disposed in beds of various natures, lying horizontally one over the other,
somewhat like the coats of an onion; that they are replete with shells, and
other productions of the sea: these shells being found in the deepest
cavities, and on the tops of the highest mountains. From these
observations, which are warranted by experience, he proceeds to observe,
that these shells and extraneous fossils are not produc∣tions of the
earth, but are all actual remains of those animals which they are known to
resem∣ble; that all the beds of the earth lie under each other, in the order
of their specific gra∣vity; and that they are disposed as if they had
been left there by subsiding waters. All these <PB N="27" REF="45"/>
assertions he affirms with much earnestness, although daily experience
contradicts him in some of them; particularly we find layers of stone often
over the lightest soils, and the softest earth under the hardest
bodies. However, having taken it for granted, that all the layers of the earth
are found in the order of their specific gravity, the lightest at the top,
and the heaviest next the centre, he consecquently asserts, and it will
not improbably follow, that all the sub∣stances of which the earth is
composed, were once in an actual state of dissolution. This universal
dissolution he takes to have happened at the time of the flood. He
supposes that at that time a body of water, which was then in the center of
the earth, uniting with that which was found on the surface, so far
separated the terrene parts as to mix all together in one fluid mass; the
contents of which afterwards sinking according to their respective
gravities, produced the present appearances of the earth. Being aware,
however, of an objection that fossile substances are not found
dissolved, he exempts them from this universal dissolution, and, for
that purpose, endeavours to shew that the parts of animals have a
stronger cohesion than those of minerals; and that, while even the
hardest rocks may be dissolved, bones and shells may still continue
entire.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="46"/>So much for Wooodward; but of all the
sys∣tems which were published respecting the earth's formation, that of
Whiston was most applaud∣ed, and most opposed. Nor need we wonder; for
being supported with all the parade of deep calculation, it awed the
ignorant, and produced the approbation of such as would be thought
otherwise, as it implied a knowledge of abstruse learning, to be even
thought capable of com∣prehending what the writer aimed at. In fact, it is not
easy to divest it of its mathematical garb; but those who have had
leisure, have found the result of our philosopher's reasoning to be
thus. He supposes the earth to have been originally a comet; and he
considers the history of the creation, as given us in scripture, to have
its commencement just when it was taken by the hand of the Creator, to be
more regularly placed as a planet in our solar system. Before that time,
he supposes it to have been a globe without beauty or proportion; a world
in disosder; subject to all the vicissitudes which comets endure;
some of which have been found, at dif∣ferent times, a thousand times hotter
than melted iron; at others, a thousand times colder than ice. These
alternations of heat and cold, con∣tinually melting and freezing the surface
of the earth, he supposes to have produced, to a certain 
<PB N="29" REF="47"/> depth, a chaos entirely resembling that described by
the poets, surrounding the solid contents of the earth, which still
continued unchanged in the midst, making a great burning globe of more than
two thousand leagues in diameter. This surrounding chaos, however, was far
from being solid: he resembles it to a dense though fluid atmosphere,
composed of substances mingled, agitated, and shocked against each
other; and in this disorder he describes the earth to have been just at
the eve of creation.</P>
<P>But upon its orbit's being then changed, when it was more regularly
wheeled round the sun, every thing took its proper places; every part of the
surrounding fluid then fell into a situation, in proportion as it was light
or heavy. The middle, or central part, which always re∣mained unchanged,
still continued so, retaining a part of that heat which it received in its
primaeval approaches towards the sun; which heat, he calculates, may continue
for about six thousand years. Next to this fell the heavier parts of the
chaotic atmosphere, which serve to sustain the lighter: but as in
descending they could not entirely be separated from many watery parts,
with which they were intimately mixed, they drew down a part of these also
with them; and these could not mount again after the <PB N="30" REF="48"/>
surface of the earth was consolidated: they, therefore, surrounded the
heavy first descend∣ing parts, in the same manner as these sur∣round
the central globe. Thus the entire body of the earth is composed most
internally of a great burning globe: next which, is placed an heavy terrene
substance, that encom∣passes it; round which also is circumfused a
body of water. Upon this body of waters, the crust of earth on which we
inhabit is placed: so that, according to him, the globe is com∣posed of a
number of coats, or shells, one within the other, all of different
densities. The body of the earth being thus formed, the air, which is the
lightest substance of all, surrounded its surface; and the beams of
the sun darting through, produced that light which, we are told, first
obeyed the Creator's command.</P>
<P>The whole oeconomy of the creation being thus adjusted, it only
remained to account for the risings and depressions on the surface of
the earth, with the other seeming irregularities of its present appearance.
The hills and vallies are considered by him as formed by their pressing
upon the internal fluid, which sustains the outward shell of earth, with
greater or less weight: those parts of the earth which are heaviest,
sink into the subjacent fluid more <PB N="31" REF="49"/> deeply, and become
vallies: those that are lightest, rise higher upon the earth's surface,
and are called mountains.</P>
<P>Such was the face of nature before the de∣luge; the earth was then
more fertile and po∣pulous than it is at present; the life of man and animals
was extended to ten times its pre∣sent duration; and all these advantages
arose from the superior heat of the central globe, which ever since has
been cooling. As its heat was then in its full power, the genial prin∣ciple was
also much greater than at present; vegetation and animal encrease were
carried on with more vigour; and all nature seemed teeming with the seeds
of life. But these phy∣sical advantages were only productive of moral evil;
the warmth which invigorated the body encreased the passions and
appetites of the mind; and, as man became more powerful, he grew less
innocent. It was found necessary to punish his depravity; and all living
creatures, except the fishes, who living in a cold element were not subject
to a similitude of guilt, were overwhelmed by the deluge in universal
de∣struction.</P>
<P>This deluge, which simple believers are willing to ascribe to a
miracle, philosophers have long been desirous to account for by 
<PB N="32" REF="50"/> natural causes: they have proved that the earth could
never supply from any reservoir towards its center, nor the atmosphere by
any dis∣charge from above, such a quantity of water as would cover the
surface of the globe to a cer∣tain depth over the tops of our highest
moun∣tains. Where, therefore, was all this water to be found? Whiston has
found enough, and more than a sufficiency, in the tail of a comet; for he
seems to alot comets a very active part in the great operations of
nature.</P>
<P>He calculates, with great seeming preci∣sion, the year, the
month, and the day of the week on which this comet (which has paid the earth
some visits since, though at a kinder distance) involved our globe in
its tail. The tail he supposed to be a vaporous fluid sub∣stance,
exhaled from the body of the comet, by the extreme heat of the sun, and
encreasing in proportion as it approached that great luminary. It was in this
that our globe was involved at the time of the deluge; and, as the earth
still acted by its natural attraction, it drew to itself all the watery
vapours which were in the comet's tail; and the internal waters being also at
the same time let loose, in a very short space the tops of the
highest mountains were laid under the deep.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="51"/>The punishment of the deluge being thus
compleated, and all the guilty destroyed, the earth, which had been broken by
the erup∣tion of the internal waters, was also enlarged by the same; so
that upon the comet's recess, there was found room sufficient in the
internal abyss for the recess of the superfluous waters; whither they all
retired, and left the earth uncovered, but in some respects changed,
par∣ticularly in its figure, which, from being round, was now become oblate. In
this universal wreck of nature Noah survived, by a variety of happy
causes, to re-people the earth, and to give birth to a race of men slow in
believing ill-imagined theories of the earth.</P>
<P>After so many theories of the earth, which had been published,
applauded, answered, and forgotten, Mr. Buffon ventured to add one more to
the number. This philosopher was, in every respect, better qualified than
any of his predecessors for such an attempt, being furnished with more
materials, having a brighter imagination to find new proofs, and a better
style to cloath them in. However, if one so ill qualified, as I am, may
judge, this seems the weakest part of his admirable work; and I could
wish, that he had been content with giving us facts instead of systems;
that, in∣stead <PB N="34" REF="52"/> of being a reasoner, he had contented
himself with being merely an historian.</P>
<P>He begins his system by making a distinction between the
first part of it and the last; the one being founded only on conjecture,
the other depending entirely upon actual observation. The latter part of his
theory may, therefore, be true, though the former should be found
erroneous.</P>
<P>The planets, says he, and the earth, among the number, might have
been formerly (he only offers this as conjecture) a part of the body of the
sun, and adherent to its substance. In this situation, a comet falling
in upon that great body might have given it such a shock, and so shaken
its whole frame, that some of its particles might have been driven off like
streaming sparkles from red hot iron; and each of these streams of
fire, small as they were in comparison of the sun, might have been large
enough to have made an earth as great, nay many times greater than ours. So
that in this manner the planets, together with the globe which we inhabit,
might have been driven off from the body of the sun by an impulsive force:
in this manner also they would continue to recede from it for ever, were they
not drawn back by its superior power of attraction; and <PB N="35" REF="53"/>
thus, by the combination of the two motions, they are wheeled round in
circles.</P>
<P>Being in this manner detached at a distance from the body of the
sun, the planets, from having been at first globes of liquid fire,
gra∣dually became cool. The earth also having been dashed obliquely
forward, received a rotatory motion upon its axis at the very instant of its
formation, and this motion being greatest at the equator, the parts there
acting against the force of gravity, they must have swollen out, and
given the earth an oblate or flatted figure.</P>
<P>As to its internal substance, our globe having once belonged to
the sun, it continues to be an uniform mass of melted matter, very
pro∣bably vitrified in its primaeval fusion. But its surface is very
differently composed. Having been in the beginning heated to a degree equal
to, if not greater than what comets are found to sustain; like them it had
an atmosphere of vapours floating round it, and which cooling by degrees,
condensed and subsided upon its sur∣face. These vapours formed,
according to their different densities, the earth, the water, and the air;
the heavier parts falling first, and the lighter remaining still
suspended.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="54"/>Thus far our philosopher is, at least, as
much a system maker as Whiston or Burnet; and, indeed, he fights his way
with great perseve∣rance and ingenuity through a thousand ob∣jections that
naturally arise. Having, at last, got upon the earth, he supposes
himself on firmer ground, and goes forward with greater security. Turning
his attention to the present appearance of things upon this globe, he
pro∣nounces from the view that the whole earth was at first under water. This
water he supposes to have been the lighter parts of its former evaporation,
which, while the earthy particles sunk downwards by their natural gravity,
floated on the surface, and covered it for a considera∣ble space of
time.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The surface of the earth," says he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Theorie de la Terre, vol. 1, p. 111.</BIBL></NOTE>, "must
have been in the beginning much less solid than it is at present; and,
consequently, the same causes, which at this day produce but very
slight changes, must then, upon so com∣plying a substance, have had
very considerable effects. We have no reason to doubt but that it was then
covered with the waters of the sea; and that those waters were above the
tops of our highest mountains, since, even in such <PB N="37" REF="55"/>
elevated situations, we find shells and other marine productions in very
great abundance. It appears also that the sea continued for a
considerable time upon the face of the earth: for as these layers of
shells are found so very frequent at such great depths, and in such
pro∣digious quantities, it seems impossible for these to have
supported their numbers all alive at one time; so that they must have
been brought there by successive depositions. These shells also
are found in the bodies of the hardest rocks, where they could not have been
deposited, all at once, at the time of deluge, or at any such instant
revolution; since that would be to sup∣pose, that all the rocks in which
they are found, were, at that instant, in a state of dissolution; which
would be absurd to assert. The sea, therefore, deposited them
wheresoever they are now to be found, and that by slow and
succes∣sive degrees. 
<P>It will appear, also, that the sea covered the whole earth,
from the appearance of its layers, which lying regularly one above the other,
seem all to resemble the sediment formed at different times by the ocean.
Hence, by the irregular force of its waves, and its currents driving the bottom
into sand-banks, mountains must have been gradually formed within this
universal <PB N="38" REF="56"/> covering of waters; and these
successively rais∣ing their heads above its surface, must, in time,
have formed the highest ridges of mountains upon land, together with
continents, islands, and low grounds, all in their turns. This opi∣nion will
receive additional weight by consi∣dering, that in those parts of the earth
where the power of the ocean is greatest, the inequa∣lities on the surface
of the earth are highest: the ocean's power is greatest at the equator,
where its winds and tides are most constant; and, in fact, the mountains at
the equator are found to be higher than in any other part of the world. The
sea, therefore, has produced the principal changes in our earth: rivers,
volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, and rain, hav∣ing made but slight
alterations, and only such as have affected the globe to very
inconsider∣able depths.</P></Q></P>
<P>This is but a very slight sketch of Mr. Buf∣fon's Theory of the
Earth; a theory which he has much more powerfully supported, than happily
invented; and it would be needless to take up the reader's time from the
pursuit of truth in the discussion of plausibilities. In fact, a
thousand questions might be asked this most ingenious philosopher,
which he would not find it easy to answer; but such is the lot of 
<PB N="39" REF="57"/> humanity, that a single Goth can in one day destroy
the fabric which Caesars were employed an age in erecting. In fact, we might
ask, how mountains, which are composed of the most compact and ponderous
substances, should be the first whose parts the sea began to
re∣move? We might ask, how fossil-wood is found deeper even than
shells? which argues, that trees grew upon, the places he supposes once
to have been covered with the ocean. But we hope this excellent man is better
employed than to think of gratifying the petulance of incredulity, by
answering endless objections.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of Fossil-shells, and other extraneous
Fossils.</HEAD>
<P>WE may affirm of Mr. Buffon, that which has been said of the
chymists of old: though he may have failed in attaining his principal aim, of
establishing a theory, yet he has brought together such a multitude of
facts relative to the history of the earth, and the nature of its 
<PB N="40" REF="58"/> fossil productions, that curiosity finds ample
compensation even while it feels the want of conviction.</P>
<P>Before, therefore, I enter upon the descrip∣tion of those parts
of the earth, which seem more naturally to fall within the subject, it will
not be improper to give a short history of those animal productions that
are found in such quan∣tities, either upon its surface, or at different
depths below it. They demand our curiosity, and, indeed, there is nothing in
natural history that has afforded more scope for doubt, conjec∣ture, and
speculation. Whatever depths of the earth we examine, or at whatever
distance within land we seek, we most commonly find a number of
fossil-shells, which being compared with others from the sea, of known
kinds, are found to be exactly of a similar shape and nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Woodward's Essay towards a Natural History, p.
16.</BIBL></NOTE>. They are found at the very bottom of quarries and mines, in
the most retired and inward parts of the most firm and solid rocks, upon
the tops of even the highest hills and mountains, as well as in the valleys
and plains: and this not in one country alone, but in all places where there is
any digging for marble, chalk, or any <PB N="41" REF="59"/> other terrestrial
matters, that are so compact as to fence off the external injuries of the
air, and thus preserve these shells from decay.</P>
<P>These marine substances, so commonly dif∣fused, and so
generally to be met with, were for a long time considered by philosophers,
as productions, not of the sea, but of the earth. 
<Q REND="inline">"As we find that spars," said they, "always
shoot into peculiar shapes, so these seeming snails, cockles, and
muscle-shells, are only spor∣tive forms that nature assumes amongst
others of its mineral varieties: they have the shape of fish, indeed, but
they have always been ter∣restrial substances<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lowth Abridgement, Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p.
426.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>With this plausible solution mankind were for a long time
content; but upon closer en∣quiry, they were obliged to alter their opinion.
It was found that these shells had, in every re∣spect, the properties of
animal and not of mine∣ral nature. They were found exactly of the same weight
with their fellow shells upon shore. They answered all the chymical
trials in the same manner as sea shells do. Their parts, when
dissolved, had the same appearance to view, the same smell and
taste. They had the <PB N="42" REF="60"/> same effects in medicine when
inwardly admi∣nistered; and, in a word, were so exactly con∣formable to
marine bodies, that they had all the accidental concretions growing to them,
(such as pearls, corals, and smaller shells) which are found in shells
just gathered on the shore. They were, therefore, from these
considerations, again given back to the sea; but the wonder was, how to
account for their coming so far from their own natural element upon land<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Woodward, p. 43.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>As this naturally gave rise to many conjec∣tures, it is not to be
wondered that some among them have been very extraordinary. An Italian,
quoted by Mr. Buffon, supposes them to have been deposited in the earth
at the time of the crusades, by the pilgrims who re∣turned from Jerusalem;
who gathering them upon the sea-shore, in their return carried them to
their different places of habitation. But this conjecturer seems to have but
a very inadequate idea of their numbers. At Touraine, in France, more than an
hundred miles from the sea, there is a plain of about nine leagues long, and
as many broad, from whence the peasants of the country supply themselves
with marle for <PB N="43" REF="61"/> manuring their lands. They seldom dig
deeper than twenty feet, and the whole plain is composed of the same
materials, which are shells of various kinds, without the smallest
portion of earth between them. Here, then, is a large space, in which are
deposited millions of tons of shells, which pilgrims could not have
collected though their whole employment had been nothing else. England is
furnished with its beds, which though not quite so exten∣sive, yet are
equally wonderful. 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol.
ii. p. 427.</BIBL></NOTE>"Near Reading, in Berkshire, for many succeeding
generations, a continued body of oyster-shells has been found through the
whole circumfe∣rence of five or six acres of ground. The foundation of
these shells is an hard rocky chalk; and above this chalk, the
oyster-shells lie in a bed of green sand, upon a level, as nigh as can
possibly be judged, and about two feet thickness."</Q> These shells
are in their natural state, but they are found also petrified, and almost
in equal abundance<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. i. p.
407.</BIBL></NOTE> in all the Alpine rocks, in the Pyrenees, on the hills of
France, England, and Flanders. Even in all quar∣ries <PB N="44" REF="62"/> from
whence marble is dug, if the rocks be split perpendicularly downwards,
petrified shells, and other marine substances, will be plainly
discerned.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"About a quarter of a mile from the river
Medway<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. p.
426.</BIBL></NOTE>, in the county of Kent, after the taking off the coping of a
piece of ground there, the workmen came to a blue marble, which continued for
three feet and an half deep, or more, and then beneath appeared an hard floor,
or pavement, composed of petri∣fied shells crowded closely together. This
layer was about an inch deep, and several yards over; and it could be walked
upon as upon a beach. These stones, of which it was composed, (the
describer supposes them to have always been stones) were either
wreathed as snails, or bival∣vular like cockles. The wreathed kinds were
about the size of an hazle-nut, and were filled with a stony substance
of the colour of marle; and they themselves, also, till they were washed,
were of the same colour; but when cleaned, they appeared of the colour of
bezoar, and of the same polish. After boiling in water they became
whitish, and left a chalkiness upon the fingers."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="63"/>In several parts of Asia and Africa,
travellers have observed these shells in great abundance. In the
mountains of Castravan, which lie above the city Barut, they quarry out a
white stone, every part of which contains pe∣trified fishes in great
numbers, and of sur∣prizing diversity. They also seem to continue in
such preservation, that their fins, scales, and all the minutest
distinctions of their make, can be perfectly discerned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. i. p. 408.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From all these instances we may conclude, that these
fossils are very numerous; and, in∣deed, independent of their situation,
they afford no small entertainment to observe them as pre∣served in the
cabinets of the curious. The va∣riety of their kinds is astonishing. Most
of the sea shells which are known, and many others to which we are entirely
strangers, are to be seen either in their natural state, or in various
de∣grees of petrefaction<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hill, p.
646.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the place of some we have mere spar, or stone,
exactly expressing all the lineaments of animals, as having been wholly
formed from them. For it has hap∣pened, that the shells dissolving by
very slow degrees, and the matter having nicely and exactly filled all the
cavities within, this matter, <PB N="46" REF="64"/> after the shells have
perished, has preserved exactly and regularly the whole print of their
internal surface Of these there are various kinds found in our pits; many
of them re∣sembling those of our own shores; and many others that are
only to be found on the coasts of other countries. There are some shells
re∣sembling those that are never stranded upon our coasts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Littorales.</NOTE>, but that always remain in the deep<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pelagii.</NOTE>: and many more there are which we can
assimilate with no shells that are known amongst us. But we find not
only shells in our pits, but also fishes and corals in great abundance;
together with almost every sort of marine production.</P>
<P>It is extraordinary enough, however, that the common red coral,
though so very fre∣quent at sea, is scarce seen in the fossil
world; nor is there any account of its hav∣ing ever been met with. But to
recompence for this, there are all the kinds of the white coral now known; and
many other kinds of that substance with which we are unacquainted. Of
animals there are various parts; the vertebrae of whales, and the mouths of
lesser fishes; these, <PB N="47" REF="65"/> with teeth also of various
kinds, are found in the cabinets of the curious; where they receive long Greek
names, which it is neither the in∣tention nor the province of this work to
enu∣merate. Indeed, few readers would think themselves much improved,
should I proceed with enumerating the various classes of the
Conicthyodontes, Polyleptoginglimi, or the Orthoceratites. These names, which
mean no great matter when they are explained, may serve to guide in the
furnishing a cabinet; but they are of very little service in furnishing
the page of instructive history.</P>
<P>From all these instances we see in what abun∣dance these
petrefactions are to be found; and, indeed, Mr. Buffon, to whose accounts we
have added some, has not been sparing in the variety of his quotations,
concerning the places where they are mostly to be found. However, I am
surprized that he should have omitted the mention of one, which, in some
measure, more than any of the rest, would have served to strengthen his
theory. We are in∣formed, by almost every traveller<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hasselquist, Sandys.</BIBL></NOTE>, that has
described the pyramids of Egypt, that one of them is entirely built of a kind
of free-stone, <PB N="48" REF="66"/> in which these petrified shells are
found in great abundance. This being the case, it may be con∣jectured, as we
have accounts of these pyra∣mids among the earliest records of mankind, and
of their being built so long before the age of Herodotus, who lived but
fifteen hundred years after the flood, that even the Egyptian priests could
tell neither the time nor the cause of their erection; I say it may be
conjectured that they were erected but a short time after the flood. It is
not very likely, therefore, that the marine substances found in one of
them, had time to be formed into a part of the solid stone, either during
the deluge, or immediately after it; and, consequently, their petrefaction
must have been before that period. And this is the opinion Mr. Buffon has all
along so strenuously endeavoured to maintain; having given specious
reasons to prove, that such shells were laid in the beds where they are
now found, not only before the deluge, but even antecedent to the formation of
man, at the time when the whole earth, as he supposes, was buried beneath a
covering of waters.</P>
<P>But while there are many reasons to persuade us that these
extraneous fossils have been de∣posited by the sea, there is one fact
that will <PB N="49" REF="67"/> abundantly serve to convince us that the earth
was habitable, if not inhabited, before these ma∣rine substances came to
be thus deposited. For we find fossil trees, which no doubt once grew
upon the earth, as deep, and as much in the body of solid rocks, as these
shells are found to be. Some of these fallen trees also, have lain at
least as long, if not longer, in the earth, than the shells as they have
been found sunk deep in a marly substance, composed of decayed
shells, and other marine productions. Mr. Buffon has proved that fossil
shells could not have been deposited in such quantities all at once by
the flood; and I think, from the above instance, it is pretty plain, that,
howsoever they were de∣posited, the earth was covered with trees before
their deposition; and, consequently, that the sea could not have made a
very permanent stay. How then shall we account for these extraor∣dinary
appearances in nature? A suspension of all assent is certainly the
first, although the most mortifying conduct. For my own part, were I to
offer a conjecture, and all that has been said upon this subject is but
conjecture, instead of supposing them to be the remains of animals
belonging to the sea, I would consider them rather as bred in the numerous
fresh-water lakes <PB N="50" REF="68"/> that, in primaeval times, covered the
face of uncultivated nature. Some of these shells we know to belong to
fresh waters: some can be assimilated to none of the marine shells
now known<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hill's Fossils, p.
641.</BIBL></NOTE>; why, therefore, may we not as well ascribe the production
of all to fresh waters, where we do not find them, as we do that of the
latter to the sea only, where we never find them? We know that lakes, and
lands also, have produced animals that are now no longer existing, why,
therefore, might not these fossil productions be among the number? I
grant that this is making a very harsh supposition; but I cannot avoid
thinking, that it is not at∣tended with so many embarrassments as some
of the former, and that it is much easier to be∣lieve that these shells
were bred in fresh water, than that the sea had for a long time covered the
tops of the highest mountains.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the internal Structure of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, in some measure, got free from the regions of
conjecture, let us now pro∣ceed to a description of the earth as we find it
by examination, and observe its internal composition, as far as it has been
the subject of experience, or exposed to human enquiry. These enquiries,
indeed, have been carried but to a very little depth below its surface, and
even in that disquisition men have been con∣ducted more by motives of
avarice than of curiosity. The deepest mine, which is that at Cotteberg in
Hungary<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. iii. p.
240.</BIBL></NOTE>, reaches not more than three thousand feet deep; but what
proportion does that bear to the depth of the terrestrial globe, down to the
centre, which is above four thousand miles? All, therefore, that has been
said of the earth, to a deeper degree, is merely fabulous or conjectural: we
may sup∣pose with one, that it is a globe of glass<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>; with another, a sphere of heated
iron<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Whiston.</BIBL></NOTE>; with 
<PB N="52" REF="70"/> a third, a great mass of waters<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Burnet.</BIBL></NOTE>; and with a fourth, one dreadful
volcano<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher.</BIBL></NOTE>; but let
us, at the same time, shew our consciousness, that all these are
but suppositions.</P>
<P>Upon examining the earth, where it has been opened to any depth, the
first thing that occurs, is the different layers or beds of which it is
composed: these all lying horizontally one over the other like the leaves
of a book, and each of them composed of materials that encrease in weight
in proportion as they lie deeper. This is, in general, the disposition of
the different ma∣terials where the earth seems to have remained unmolested;
but this order is frequently in∣verted; and we cannot tell whether from its
ori∣ginal formation, or from accidental causes. Of different substances,
thus disposed, the far greatest part of our globe consists, from its
surface downwards to the greatest depths we ever dig or mine<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Woodward, p. 9.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The first layer that is most commonly found at the surface, is
that light coat of blackish mold, which is called, by some, garden earth.
With this the earth is every where invested, unless it be washed off by
rains, or removed by some other external violence. This seems to have been
formed from animal and vegetable <PB N="53" REF="71"/> bodies decaying, and thus
turning into its sub∣stance. It also serves again as a store-house,
from whence animal and vegetable nature are re∣newed, and thus are all vital
blessings continued with unceasing circulation. This earth, however, is
not to be supposed entirely pure, but is mixed up with much stony and
gravelly matter from the layers lying immediately beneath it. It generally
happens, that the soil is fertile in proportion to the quantity that this
putrified mold bears to the gravelly mixture; and as the former predominates,
so far is the vegetation upon it more luxuriant. It is this external covering
that supplies man with all the true riches he enjoys. He may bring up gold
and jewels from greater depths; but they are merely the toys of a capricious
being, things upon which he has placed an imaginary value, and for which fools
alone part with the more substantial blessings of life. It is this
earth, says Pliny<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plinii Naturalis
Historia, lib. 2, cap. 63.</BIBL></NOTE>, that, like a kind mother, receives
us at our birth, and sustains us when born. It is this alone, of all the
ele∣ments around us, that is never found an ene∣my to man. The body of waters
deluge him with rains, oppress him with hail, and drown him with inundations.
The air rushes in storms, <PB N="54" REF="72"/> prepares the tempest, or
lights up the volca∣no; but the earth, gentle and indulgent, ever
subservient to the wants of man, spreads his walks with flowers, and his
table with plenty; returns with interest every good committed to her care;
and, though she produces the poison, she still supplies the antidote;
though constantly teized more to furnish the luxuries of man than his
necessities, yet, even to the last, she continues her kind indulgence,
and, when life is over, she piously covers his remains in her bosom.</P>
<P>This external and fruitful layer which covers the earth, is, as was
said, in a state of conti∣nual change. Vegetables, which are naturally
fixed and rooted to the same place, receive their adventitious nourishment
from the surrounding earth and water: animals, which change from place to
place, are supported by these, or by each other. Both, however, having for
a time enjoyed a life adapted to their nature, give back to the earth those
spoils, which they had bor∣rowed for a very short space, yet still to
be quick∣ened again into fresh existence. But the deposits they make are
of very dissimilar kinds, and the earth is very differently enriched by
their con∣tinuance. Those countries that have for a long time supported men
and other animals, having been observed to become every day more bar∣ren, 
<PB N="55" REF="73"/> while, on the contrary, those desolate places, in
which vegetables only are abundantly produced, are known to be possest of
amazing fertility. 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. i.
353.</BIBL></NOTE>"In regions which are uninhabit∣ed," says Mr. Buffon,
"where the forests are not cut down, and where animals do not feed upon the
plants, the bed of vegetable earth is con∣stantly encreasing. In all woods,
and even in those which are often cut, there is a layer of earth of six or
eight inches thick, which has been formed by the leaves, branches and bark,
which fall and rot upon the ground. I have frequently observed on a Roman way
that crosses Burgundy for a long extent, that there is a bed of black
earth, of more than a foot thick, gathered over the stony pavement, on which
several trees, of a very considerable size, are supported. This I have
found to be nothing else than an earth formed by decayed leaves and branches,
which have been converted by time into a black soil. Now as vegetables draw
much more of their nourishment from the air and water than they do from the
earth, it must follow, that in rotting upon the ground, they must give more
to the soil than they have taken from it. Hence, therefore, in woods kept a
long time without cutting, the soil below <PB N="56" REF="74"/> encreases to
a considerable depth; and such we actually find the soil in those
American wilds where the forests have been undisturbed for ages. But it is
otherwise where men and ani∣mals have long subsisted; for as they make
a considerable consumption of wood and plants, both for firing and other
uses, they take more from the earth than they return to it: it follows,
therefore, that the bed of vegetable earth, in an inhabited country, must be
always dimi∣nishing; and must, at length, resemble the soil of Arabia
Petrea, and other provinces of the East, which having been long inhabited,
are now become plains of salt and sand; the fixed salt always remaining
while the other vo∣latile parts have flown away."</Q></P>
<P>If from this external surface we descend deeper, and view the
earth cut perpendicularly downwards, either in the banks of great rivers, or
steepy sea-shores; or, going still deeper, if we observe it in
quarries or mines, we shall find its layers regularly disposed in their
proper or∣der. We must not expect, however, to find them of the same kind
or thickness in every place, as they differ in different soils and
situations. Sometimes marle is seen to be over sand, and sometimes
under it. The most com∣mon disposition is, that under the first earth 
<PB N="57" REF="75"/> is found gravel or sand, then clay or marle, then chalk
or coal, marbles, oars, sands, gra∣vels, and thus an alternation of these
sub∣stances, each growing more dense as it sinks deeper. The clay, for
instance, found at the depth of an hundred feet, is usually more heavy than
that found not far from the surface. In a well which was dug at Amsterdam,
to the depth of two hundred and thirty feet, the fol∣lowing substances were
found in succession<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Varenius, as quoted by
Mr. Buffon, p. 358.</BIBL></NOTE>: seven feet of vegetable earth, nine of
turf, nine of soft clay, eight of sand, four of earth, ten of clay, four of
earth, ten of sand, two of clay, four of white sand, one of soft earth,
fourteen of sand, eight of clay mixed with sand, four of sea-sand mixed
with shells, then an hundred and two feet of soft clay, and then thirty-one
feet of sand.</P>
<P>In a well dug at Marly, to the depth of an hundred feet, Mr. Buffon
gives us a still more exact enumeration of its layers of earth. 
<Q REND="inline">Thir∣teen of a reddish gravel, two of gravel
mingled with a vitrifiable sand, three of limon, two of marle, four of marly
stone, five of marle in dust mixed with vitrifiable sand, six of very
fine vitrifiable sand, three of earthy marle, three of hard marle, one of
gravel, one of <PB N="58" REF="76"/> eglantine, a stone of the hardness and
grain of marble, one of gravelly marle, one of stony marle, one of a
coarser kind of stony marle, two of a coarser kind still, one of
vitrifiable sand mixed with fossil shells, two of fine gravel, three of
stony marle, one of coarse powdered marle, one of stone, calcinable like
marble, three of grey sand, two of white sand, one of red sand streaked
with white, eight of grey sand with shells, three of very fine sand,
three of gres, four of red sand streaked with white, three of white sand,
and fifteen of reddish vitrifiable sand."</Q></P>
<P>In this manner the earth is every where found in beds over beds;
and, what is still remark∣able, each of them, as far as it extends, always
maintains exactly the same thickness. It is found also, that, as we
proceed to considerable depths, every layer grows thicker. Thus in the
adduced instances we might have observed, that the last layer was fifteen
feet thick, while most of the others were not above eight, and this might
have gone much deeper, for aught we can tell, as before they got through it the
workmen ceased digging.</P>
<P>These layers are sometimes very extensive, and often are found
to obtain over a space of some leagues in circumference. But it must 
<PB N="59" REF="77"/> not be supposed that they are uniformly conti∣nued
over the whole globe without any inter∣ruption: on the contrary, they are ever,
at small intervals, cracked through as it were by perpendicular fissures;
the earth resembling, in this respect, the muddy bottom of a pond, from
whence the water has been dried off by the sun, and thus gaping in several
chinks, which descend in a direction perpendicular to its surface. These
fissures are many times found empty, but oftener closed up with
ad∣ventitious substances, that the rain, or some other accidental
causes, have conveyed to fill their cavities. Their openings are not less
different than their contents, some being not above half an inch wide, some
a foot, and some several hundred yards asunder. These last form
those dreadful chasms that are to be found in the Alps, at the edge of
which the traveller stands dreading to look down at the immeasurable gulph
below. These amazing clefts are well known to such as have past these
mountains, where a chasm frequently presents itself several hundred
feet deep, and as many over, at the edge of which the way lies. It often
happens also, that the road leads along the bottom, and then the spectator
observes on each side frightful precipices several hundred 
<PB N="60" REF="78"/> yards above him; the sides of which tally so exactly
with each other, that they evidently seem torn asunder.</P>
<P>But these chasms to be found in the Alps, are nothing to what
Ovalle tells us are to be seen in the Andes. These amazing mountains, in
comparison of which the former are but little hills, have their fissures
in proportion to their greatness. In some places they are a mile wide, and
deep in proportion; and there are some others, that running underground, in
extent resemble a province.</P>
<P>Of this kind also is that cavern called Elden-hole, in
Derbyshire; which, Dr. Plot tells us, was sounded by a line of eight and
twenty hundred feet, without finding the bottom, or meeting with water: and yet
the mouth at the top is not above forty yards over<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p. 370.</BIBL></NOTE>. This
im∣measurable cavern runs perpendicularly down∣ward; and the sides of it
seem totally so plainly as to shew that they once were united. Those
who come to visit the place, generally procure stones to be thrown into its
mouth; and these are heard for several minutes, falling and striking
against the sides of the cavern, producing a sound that resembles
distant thunder, dying away as the stone goes deeper.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="79"/>Of this kind also is that dreadful cavern
des∣cribed by Aelian; his account of which the rea∣der may not have met
with<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Aeliani Var. Hist. lib. 16, cap.
16.</BIBL></NOTE>. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the country of the Arrian Indians, is to be
seen an amazing chasm, which is called, The Gulph of Pluto. The depth, and
the recesses of this horrid place, are as extensive as they are unknown.
Neither the natives, nor the curious who visit it, are able to tell how it
first was made, or to what depths it descends. The Indians continually
drive thither great multitudes of animals, more than three thousand at a
time, of different kinds, sheep, horses and goats; and, with an absurd
su∣perstition, force them into the cavity, from whence they never return.
Their several sounds, however, are heard as they descend; the bleat∣ing
of sheep, the lowing of oxen, and the neigh∣ing of horses, issuing up
to the mouth of the ca∣vern. Nor do these sounds cease, as the place is
continually furnished with a fresh supply."</Q></P>
<P>There are many more of these dreadful per∣pendicular fissures
in different parts of the earth; with accounts of which, Kircher, Gaffarellus,
and others who have given histories of the won∣ders of the subterranean
world, abundantly sup∣ply us. The generality of readers, however, will
consider them with less astonishment, when they are informed of their
being common all <PB N="62" REF="80"/> over the earth: that in every field, in
every quarry, these perpendicular fissures are to be found; either
still gaping, or filled with matter that has accidentally closed their
interstices. The inattentive spectator neglects the enquiry, but their
being common is partly the cause that excites the philosopher's attention
to them; the irregularities of nature he is often content to let pass
unexamined; but when a constant and a common appearance presents itself,
every return of the object is a fresh call to his curiosity; and the chink
in the next quarry becomes as great a matter of wonder as the chasm in
Elden-hole. Philosophers have long, therefore, endeavoured to find out the
cause of these perpendicular fissures, which our own countrymen,
Woodward and Ray, were the first that found to be so com∣mon and
universal. Mr. Buffon supposes them to be cracks made by the sun, in
drying up the earth immediately after its emersion from the deep. The heat of
the sun is very probably a principal cause; but it is not right to
ascribe to one only, what we find may be the result of many. Earthquakes,
severe frosts, bursting waters, and storms tearing up the roots of
trees, have, in our own times, produced them: and to this variety of causes,
we must, at present, be content to assign those that have happened
before we had opportunities for observation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Caves and subterraneous Passages that
sink, but not perpendicularly, into the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>IN surveying the subterranean wonders of the globe, besides
those fissures that descend perpen∣dicularly downwards, we frequently
find others that descend but a little way, and then spread themselves
often to a great extent below the surface. Many of these caverns, it must
be con∣fessed, may be the production of art and human industry; retreats
made to protect the oppressed, or shelter the spoiler. The famous
labyrinth of Candia, for instance, is supposed to be en∣tirely the work
of art. Mr. Tournefort assures us, that it bears the impression of
human in∣dustry, and that great pains have been bestowed upon its
formation. The stone-quarry of Maestricht is evidently made by labour:
carts enter at its mouth, and load within, then return and discharge their
freight into boats that lie on the brink of the river Maese. This quarry is
so large, that forty thousand people may take shelter in it: and it in
general serves for this purpose, when armies march that way; becom∣ing then
an impregnable retreat to the people <PB N="64" REF="82"/> that live thereabout.
Nothing can be more beautiful than this cavern, when lighted up with torches;
for there are thousands of square pillars, in large level walks, about
twenty feet high; and all wrought with much neatness and regularity. In this
vast grotto there is very little rubbish; which shews both the goodness
of the stone, and the carefulness of the workmen. To add to its beauty,
there also are in various parts of it, little pools of water, for the
con∣venience of the men and cattle. It is remark∣able also, that no droppings
are seen to fall from the roof, nor are the walks any way wet under foot,
except in cases of great rains, where the water gets in by the air shafts.
The Salt mines in Poland are still more spacious than these. Some of the
catacombs, both in Egypt and Italy, are said to be very extensive. But no
part of the world has a greater number of artificial caverns than Spain, which
were made to serve as retreats to the Christians, against the fury of the
Moors, when the latter conquered that country. However, an account of the works
of art, does not properly belong to a natural history. It will be enough to
observe, that though caverns be found in every country, far the greatest
part of them have been fashioned only by the hand of Nature. Their size is
found beyond the <PB N="65" REF="83"/> power of man to have effected; and their
forms but ill adapted to the conveniences of an human habitation. In some
places, indeed, we find mankind still make use of them as houses;
par∣ticularly in those countries where the climate is very severe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p. 368.</BIBL></NOTE>; but in
general they are deserted by every race of meaner animals, except the bat;
these nocturnal solitary creatures are usu∣ally the only inhabitants; and
these only in such whose descent is sloping, or, at least, not
directly perpendicular.</P>
<P>There is scarce a country in the world with∣out its natural
caverns; and many new cries are discovered every day. Of those in England,
Oakey-hole, The Devil's-hole, and Penpark-hole, have been often described.
The former, which lies on the south side of Mendip-hills<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>, within a mile of the town of Wells, is
much re∣sorted to by travellers. To conceive a just idea of this, we must
imagine a precipice of more than an hundred yards high, on the side of a
mountain which shelves away a mile above it. In this is an opening not very
large, into which you enter, going along upon a rocky uneven pavement,
sometimes ascending, and sometimes descending. The roof of it, as you
advance, grows higher; and, in some places, is fifty feet <PB N="66" REF="84"/> from the floor. In some places, however, it is so low that a man
must stoop to pass. It ex∣tends itself, in length, about two hundred
yards; and from every part of the roof, and the floor, there are formed
sparry concretions of various figures, that by strong imaginations have
been likened to men, lion, and organs. At the far∣thest part of this cavern
rises a stream of water, well stored with fish, large enough to turn a
mill, and which discharges itself near the entrance.</P>
<P>Penpark-hole, in Gloucestershire, is almost as remarkable as
the former. Captain Sturmey descended into this by a rope, twenty-five
fa∣thoms perpendicular, and at the bottom found a very large vault in the
shape of an horse-shoe. The floors consisted of a kind of white
stone enamelled with lead ore, and the pendent rocks were glazed with spar.
Walking forward on this stony pavement, for some time, he came to a great
river, twenty fathoms broad, and eight fathoms deep; and having been informed
that it ebbed and flowed with the sea, he remained in this gloomy abode for
five hours, to make an exact observation. He did not find, however, any
alteration whatsoever in its appearance. But his curiosity was ill
requited; for it cost this unfortunate gentleman his life: immediately 
<PB N="67" REF="85"/> after his return, he was seized with an unusual and
violent head-ach, which threw him into a fever, of which he died soon
after.</P>
<P>But of all the subterraneous caverns now known, the grotto of
Antiparos is the most re∣markable, as well for its extent, as for the beauty
of its sparry incrustations. This celebrated ca∣vern was first
discovered by one Magni, an Italian traveller, about an hundred years ago, at
Antiparos, an inconsiderable island of the Ar∣chipelago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher Mund. sub. 122.</BIBL> I have translated a part
of Kircher's description, rather than Tournefort's, as the latter was written
to support an hypothesis.</NOTE>. The account he gives of it is long and
inflated, but upon the whole amusing. 
<Q REND="inline">"Having been informed," says he, "by the na∣tives
of Paros, that in the little island of Antipa∣ros, which lies about two miles
from the former, of a gigantic statue that was to be seen at the mouth of a
cavern in that place, it was resolved that we (the French consul and
himself) should pay it a visit. In pursuance of this resolution,
af∣ter we had landed on the island, and walked about four, miles thro' the
midst of beautiful plains, and sloping woodlands, we at length came to a
little hill, on the side of which yawned a most horrid cavern, that with
its gloom at first struck us with terror, and almost represt
curiosity. Recovering <PB N="68" REF="86"/> the first surprize, however,
we entered boldly; and had not proceeded above twenty paces, when the
supposed statue of the giant presented itself to our view. We quickly
perceived, that what the ignorant natives had been terrified at as a giant, was
nothing more than a sparry concretion, formed by the water dropping from the
roof of the cave, and by degrees hardening into a figure that their fears had
formed into a monster. Incited by this extraordinary ap∣pearance, we were
induced to proceed still far∣ther, in quest of new adventures in this
sub∣terranean abode. As we proceeded, new won∣ders offered themselves; the
spars, formed into trees and shrubs, presented a kind of petrified grove;
some white, some green; and all re∣ceding in due perspective. They
struck us with the more amazement, as we knew them to be mere productions of
Nature, who, hither∣to in solitude, had, in her playful moments, dressed
the scene, as if for her own amuse∣ment. 
<P>"But we had as yet seen but a few of the won∣ders of the
place; and we were introduced as yet only into the portico of this amazing
tem∣ple. In one corner of this half illuminated re∣cess, there appeared an
opening of about three feet wide, which seemed to lead to a place to∣tally 
<PB N="69" REF="87"/> dark, and that one of the natives assured us contained
nothing more than a reservoir of water. Upon this we tried, by throwing down
some stones, which rumbling along the sides of the descent for some
time, the sound seemed at last quashed in a bed of water. In order,
how∣ever, to be more certain, we sent in a Levantine mariner, who, by the
promise of a good re∣ward, with a flambeaux in his hand, ventured into this
narrow aperture. After continuing within it for about a quarter of an hour, he
re∣turned, carrying some beautiful pieces of white spar in his hand, which
art could neither imitate nor equal. Upon being informed by him that the place
was full of these beautiful incrustations, I ventured in once more with
him, for about fifty paces, anxiously and cautiously descending by a
steep and dangerous way. Finding, however, that we came to a precipice which
led into a spacious amphitheatre, if I may so call it, still deeper than
any other part, we returned, and being provided with a ladder, flambeaux, and
other things to expedite our descent, our whole company, man by man, ventured
into the same opening, and descending one after another, we at last saw
ourselves all together in the most magnificent part of the cavern.</P> 
<P><PB N="70" REF="88"/>"Our candles being now all lighted up, and
the whole place completely illuminated, never could the eye be presented with
a more glitter∣ing, or a more magnificent scene. The roof all hung with
solid isicles, transparent as glass, yet solid as marble. The eye
could scarce reach the lofty and noble cieling; the sides were re∣gularly
formed with spars; and the whole pre∣sented the idea of a magnificent
theatre, illu∣minated with an immense profusion of lights. The floor
consisted of solid marble; and in se∣veral places, magnificent columns,
thrones, altars, and other objects appeared, as if nature had designed to
mock the curiosities of art. Our voices, upon speaking or singing, were
re∣doubled to an astonishing loudness; and upon the firing of a gun, the
noise and reverberations were almost deafening. In the midst of this
grand amphitheatre rose a concretion of about fifteen feet high, that, in
some measure, re∣sembled an altar; from which, taking the hint, we
caused mass to be celebrated there. The beautiful columns that shot up
round the altar, appeared like candlesticks; and many other na∣tural objects
represented the customary orna∣ments of this sacrament.</P> 
<P>"Below even this spacious grotto, there seem∣ed another
cavern; down which I ventured with <PB N="71" REF="89"/> my former mariner, and
descended about fifty paces by means of a rope. I at last arrived at a
small spot of level ground, where the bottom appeared different from that
of the amphithe∣atre, being composed of soft clay, yielding to the
pressure, and in which I thrust a stick to about six feet deep. In
this, however, as above, numbers of the most beautiful chrys∣tals were
formed; one of which, particularly, resembled a table. Upon our egress from
this amazing cavern, we perceived a Greek inscrip∣tion upon a rock at the
mouth, but so oblite∣rated by time, that we could not read it. It seemed to
import that one Antipater, in the time of Alexander, had come thither; but
whether he penetrated into the depths of the cavern, he does not think fit to
inform us."</P> </Q></P>
<P>Such is the account of this beautiful scene, as communicated in a
letter to Kircher. We have another, and a more copious description of it by
Tournefort, which is in every body's hands; but I have given the above, both
be∣cause it was communicated by the first disco∣verer, and because it
is a simple narrative of facts, without any reasoning upon them. Accord∣ing
to Tournefort's account, indeed, we might conclude, from the rapid growth of
the spars in this grotto, that it must every year be growing 
<PB N="72" REF="90"/> narrower, and that it must, in time, be choaked up with
them entirely; but no such thing has happened hitherto, and the grotto at
this day continues as spacious as we ever knew it.</P>
<P>This is not the place for an enquiry into the seeming vegetation
of those stony substances with which this and almost every cavern are
incrusted. It is enough to observe, in general, that they are formed by an
accumulation of that little gritty matter which is carried thither by the
waters, and which in time acquires the hard∣ness of marble. What in this
place more imports us to know is, how these amazing hollows in the earth came
to be formed. And I think, in the three instances above-mentioned, it is
pretty evident, that their excavation has been owing to waters. These finding
subterraneous pas∣sages under the earth, and by long degrees hollowing
the beds in which they flowed, the ground above them has slipt down closer
to their surface, leaving the upper layers of the earth or stone still
suspended. The ground that sinks upon the face of the waters forming the
floor of the cavern; the ground, or rock that keeps suspended, forming the
roof: and, indeed, there are but few of these caverns found without water,
either within them, or near enough to point out their formation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Mines, Damps, and Mineral Vapours.</HEAD>
<P>THE caverns, which we have been describ∣ing, generally carry us
but a very little way below the surface of the earth. Two hundred feet, at
the utmost, is as much as the lowest of them is found to sink. The
perpendicular fissures run much deeper; but few persons have been bold
enough to venture down to their deepest recesses: and some few who have
tried, have been able to bring back no tidings of the place, for unfortunately
they left their lives below. The excavations of art have con∣duced us much
further into the bowels of the globe. Some mines in Hungary are known to be a
thousand yards perpendicularly down∣wards; and I have been informed, by good
au∣thority, of a coal mine in the north of England, an hundred yards deeper
still.</P>
<P>It is beside our present purpose to enquire into the peculiar
construction and contrivance of these, which more properly belongs to the
history of fossils. It will be sufficient to ob∣serve in this place,
that as we descend into the <PB N="74" REF="92"/> mines, the various layers of
earth are seen, as we have already described them; and in some of these
are always found the metals or minerals, for which the mine has been dug. Thus
frequently gold is found dispersed and mixed with clay and gravel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. ii. p. 470.</BIBL></NOTE>; sometimes it
is mingled with other metallic bodies, stones, or bitumens; and<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa. ibid.</BIBL></NOTE> sometimes united
with that most obstinate of all substances, platina, from which
scarce any art can separate it. Silver is sometimes found quite pure<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Macquer's Chymistry, vol. i. p.
316.</BIBL></NOTE>, sometimes mixed with other substances and minerals.
Copper is found in beds mixed with various substances, marbles, sulphurs,
and pyrites. Tin, the ore of which is heavier than that of any other metal, is
generally found mixed with every kind of matter: 
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hill's Fossils, p.
628.</BIBL></NOTE>lead is also equally com∣mon; and iron we well know can be
extracted from all the substances upon earth.</P>
<P>The variety of substances which are thus found in the bowels of
the earth, in their na∣tive state, have a very different appearance from what
they are afterwards taught to assume by human induftry. The richest
metals are very often less glittering and splendid than the most 
<PB N="75" REF="93"/> useless marcasites, and the basest ores are in
ge∣neral the most beautiful to the eye.</P>
<P>This variety of substances, which compose the internal parts
of our globe, is productive of equal varieties, both above and below its
sur∣face. The combination of the different mi∣nerals with each other, the
heats which arise from their mixture, the vapours they diffuse, the fires
which they generate, or the colds which they sometimes produce, are all
either noxious or salutary to man; so that in this great elabra∣tory of
nature, a thousand benefits and cala∣mities are forging, of which we are
wholly un∣conscious; and it is happy for us that we are so.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. iii. p.
232.</BIBL></NOTE>Upon our descent into mines of consider∣able depth, the
cold seems to encrease from the mouth as we descend; but after
passing very low down, we begin, by degrees, to come into a warmer air,
which sensibly grows hotter as we go deeper, till, at last, the labourers
can scarce bear any covering as they continue working.</P>
<P>This difference in the air was supposed by Boyle to proceed from
magazines of fire that lay nearer the centre, and that diffused their heat to
the adjacent regions. But we now <PB N="76" REF="94"/> know that it may be
ascribed to more obvious causes. In some mines, the composition of the
earth all around is of such a nature, that upon the admission of water or
air, it frequently be∣comes hot, and often bursts out into eruptions.
Beside this, as the external air cannot readily reach the bottom, or be
renewed there, an ob∣servable heat is perceived below, without the
necessity of recurring to the central heat for an explanation.</P>
<P>Hence, therefore, there are two principal causes of the warmth at
the bottom of mine: the heat of the substances of which the sides are
composed; and the want of renovation in the air below. Any sulphureous
substance mixed with iron, produces a very great heat, by the admission
of water. If, for instance, a quantity of sulphur be mixed with a
proportionable share of iron filings, and both kneaded together into a soft
paste, with water, they will soon grow hot, and at last produce a flame.
This experiment, produced by art, is very commonly effected within the bowels
of the earth by nature. Sul∣phurs and irons are intimately blended together,
and want only the mixture of water of air to excite their heat; and this, when
once raised, is communicated to all bodies that lie within the sphere of
their operation. Those beautiful <PB N="77" REF="95"/> minerals, called
marcasites and pyrites, are often of this composition; and wherever they
are found, either by imbibing the moisture of the air, or having been by any
means combined with water, they render the mine considerably hot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol. ii. p. 216.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The want of fresh air, also, at these depths, is, as we have
said, another reason for their being found much hotter. Indeed, without the
assistance of art, the bottom of most mines would, from this cause,
be insupportable. To re∣medy this inconvenience, the miners are often obliged
to sink, at some convenient distance from the mouth of the pit where they
are at work, another pit, which joins the former be∣low, and which, in
Derbyshire, is called an air∣shaft. Through this the air circulates; and
thus the workmen are enabled to breathe freely at the bottom of the place;
which becomes, as Mr. Boyle affirms, very commodious for res∣piration; and
also very temperate as to heat and cold<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. iii. p. 238.</BIBL></NOTE>. Mr. Locke, however,
who has left us an account of the Mendip mines, seems to pre∣sent a
different picture. 
<Q REND="inline">"The descent into these is exceeding difficult
and dangerous; for they are not sunk like wells, perpendicularly, 
<PB N="78" REF="96"/> but as the crannies of the rocks happen to run. The
constant method is to swing down by a rope, placed under the arms, and
clamber along, by applying both feet and hands to the sides of the narrow
passage. The air is conveyed into them through a little passage that
runs along the sides from the top, where they set up some turfs, on the
lee-side of the hole, to catch and force it down. These turfs being removed
to the windy side, or laid over the mouth of the hole, the miners below
presently want breath, and faint; and if sweet smelling flowers chance to
be placed there, they immediately lose their fragrancy, and stink like
carrion."</Q> An air so very pu∣trifying can never be very commodious for
res∣piration.</P>
<P>Indeed, if we examine the complexion of most miners, we shall be
very well able to form a judg∣ment of the unwholsomness of the place where
they are confined. Their pale and sallow looks shew how much the air is
damaged by passing through those deep and winding ways, that are rendered
humid by damps, or warmed with nox∣ious exhalations. But although every mine is
unwholsome, all are not equally so. Coal-mines are generally less noxious
than those of tin; tin than those of copper; but of all, none are so
dreadfully destructive as those of quicksilver. <PB N="79" REF="97"/> At
the mines near the village of Idra, nothing can adequately describe the
deplorable infir∣mities of such as fill the hospital there: ema∣ciated and
crippled, every limb contracted or convulsed, and some in a manner
transpiring quicksilver at every pore. There was one man, says Dr.
Pope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p.
578.</BIBL></NOTE>, who was not in the mines above half a year, and yet whose
body was so im∣pregnated with this mineral, that putting a piece of brass
money in his mouth, or rubbing it between his fingers, it immediately became as
white as if it had been washed over with quick∣silver. In this manner all
the workmen are killed, sooner or later; first becoming paralytic, and then
dying consumptive: and all this they sustain for the trifling reward of
seven-pence a day.</P>
<P>But these metalic mines are not so noxious from their own
vapours, as from those of the substances with which the ores are
usually united, such as arsenic, cinnabar, bitumen, or vitriol. From the
fumes of these, variously combined, and kept enclosed, are produced
those various damps that put on so many dread∣ful forms, and are usually
so fatal. Sometimes those noxious vapours are perceived by the de∣lightful
fragrance of their smell<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid. p.
375.</BIBL></NOTE>, somewhat re∣sembling the pea-blossom in bloom, from
whence <PB N="80" REF="98"/> one kind of damp has its name. The miners are not
deceived, however, by its flattering appear∣ances; but as they thus have timely
notice of its coming, they avoid it while it continues, which is generally
during the whole summer season. Another shews its approach by the
burning of the candles, which seem to collect their flame into a globe of
light, and thus gradually lessen, till they are quite extinguished. From
this also, the miners frequently escape; however, such as have the
misfortune to be caught in it, either swoon away, and are suffocated, or
slowly recover in excessive agonies. Here is also a third, called the
fulminating damp, much more dangerous than either of the former, as it
strikes down all be∣fore it, like a flash of gunpowder, without giving any
warning of its approach. But there is still another, more deadly than all the
rest, which is found in those places where the vapour has been long
confined, and has been, by some acci∣dent, set free. The air rushing out
from thence, always goes upon deadly errands; and scarce any escape to
describe the symptoms of its ope∣rations.</P>
<P>Some colliers in Scotland, working near an old mine that had been
long closed up, hap∣pened inadvertently to open an hole into it, from the pit
where they were then employed. <PB N="81" REF="99"/> By great good fortune, they
at that time per∣ceived their error, and instantly fled for their lives. The
next day, however, they were re∣solved to renew their work in the same pit,
and eight of them ventured down, without any great apprehensions; but they
had scarce got to the bottom of the stairs that led to the pit, but coming
within the vapour, they all instantly dropped down dead, as if they had been
shot. Amongst these unfortunate poor men, there was one whose wife was
informed that he was stifled in the mine; and as he happened to be next the
entrance, she so far ventured down as to see where he lay. As she
approached the place, the sight of her husband inspired her with a
de∣sire to rescue him, if possible, from that dreadful situation;
though a little reflection might have shewn her it was then too late. But
nothing could deter her; she ventured forward, and had scarce touched him
with her hand, when the damp prevailed, and the misguided, but faith∣ful
creature, fell dead by his side.</P>
<P>Thus, the vapours found beneath the surface of the earth, are very
various in their effects upon the constitution: and they are not less in
their appearances. There are many kinds that seemingly are no way prejudicial
to health, but in which the workmen breathe freely; and yet 
<PB N="82" REF="100"/> in these, if a lighted candle be introduced, they
immediately take fire, and the whole cavern at once becomes one furnace of
flame. In mines, therefore, subject to damps of this kind, they are obliged
to have recourse to a very pe∣culiar contrivance to supply sufficient
light for their operations. This is by a great wheel; the circumference of
which is beset with flints, which striking against steels placed for
that pur∣pose at the extremity, a stream of fire is pro∣duced, which
affords light enough; and yet which does not set fire to the mineral
vapour.</P>
<P>Of this kind are the vapours of the mines about Bristol: on the
contrary, in other mines, a single spark struck out from the collision
of flint and steel, would set the whole shaft in a flame. In such,
therefore, every precaution is used to avoid a collision ; the workmen
making use only of wooden instruments in digging; and being cautious before
they enter the mine, to take out even the nails from their shoes. Whence this
strange difference should arise, that the vapours of some mines catch
fire with a spark, and others only with a flame, is a question that we
must be content to leave in obscurity, till we know more of the nature both
of mineral vapour and of fire, This only we may observe, that gunpowder will
readily fire <PB N="83" REF="101"/> with a spark, but not with the flame of a
can∣dle: on the other hand, spirits of wine will flame with a candle, but not
with a spark; but even here the cause of this difference, as yet, remains a
secret.</P>
<P>As from this account of mines, it appears that the internal parts of
the globe are filled with vapours of various kinds, it is not supriz∣ing,
that they should at different times reach the surface, and there put on
various appear∣ances. In fact, much of the salubrity, and much of the
unwholsomeness of climates and soils, is to be ascribed to these
vapours, which make their way from the bowels of the earth upwards, and
refresh or taint the air with their exhalations. Salt mines being naturally
cold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p.
523.</BIBL></NOTE>, send forth a degree of coldness to the external air, to
comfort and refresh it: on the con∣trary, metallic mines are known, not only
to warm it with their exhalations, but often to destroy all kinds of
vegetation by their volatile corrosive fumes. In some mines dense vapours
are plainly perceived issuing from their mouths, and sensibly warm to
the touch. In some places, neither snow nor ice will continue on the ground
that covers a mine; and over others <PB N="82" REF="102"/>

fields are found destitute of verdure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. iii. p. 238.</BIBL></NOTE>. The inhabitants,
also, are rendered dreadfully sensible of these subterraneous
exhalations, be∣ing affected with such a variety of evils pro∣ceeding
entirely from this cause, that books have been professedly written upon
this class of disorders.</P>
<P>Nor are these vapours which thus escape to the surface of the
earth, entirely unconfined; for they are frequently, in a manner,
circumscribed to a spot: the grotto Del Cane, near Naples, is an instance
of this; the noxious effects of which have made that cavern so very famous.
This grotto, which has so much employed the attention of travellers, lies
within four miles of Naples, and is situated near a large lake of clear and
wholesome water<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol.
i. p. 191.</BIBL></NOTE>. Nothing can exceed the beauty of the landscape
which this lake affords; being surrounded with hills covered with forests
of the most beautiful ver∣dure, and the whole bearing a kind of
amphi∣theatrical appearance. However, this region, beautiful as it appears, is
almost entirely un∣inhabited; the few peasants that necessity com∣pels
to reside there, looking quite consump∣tive and ghastly, from the
poisonous exhala∣tions <PB N="85" REF="105"/> that rise from the earth. The
famous grotto lies on the side of an hill, near which place a peasant
resides, who keeps a number of dogs for the purpose of shewing the
expe∣riment to the curious. These poor animals always seem perfectly
sensible of the approach of a stranger, and endeavour to get out of the
way. However, their attempts being perceived, they are taken and brought to the
grotto; the noxious effects of which they have so fre∣quently experienced.
Upon entering this place, which is a little cave, or hole rather, dug into the
hill, about eight feet high and twelve feet long, the observer can see no
visi∣ble marks of its pestilential vapour; only to about a foot from the
bottom, the wall seems to be tinged with a colour resembling that which is
given by stagnant waters. When the dog, this poor philosophical martyr, as
some have called him, is held above this mark, he does not seem to feel the
smallest inconveni∣ence; but when his head is thrust down lower, he
struggles to get free for a little; but in the space of four or five
minutes he seems to lose all sensation, and is taken out seemingly

<P>This vapour, which thus for a time suffo∣cates, is of the humid
kind, as it extinguishes a torch, and sullies a looking-glass; but there
are other vapours perfectly inflamable, and that only require the approach of a
candle to set them blazing. Of this kind was the burning well at Brosely,
which is now stopped up; the vapour of which, when a candle was brought
within about a foot of the surface of the water, caught flame like spirits
of wine, and con∣tinued blazing for several hours after. Of this kind,
also, are the perpetual fires in the kingdom of Persia. In that province,
where the worshippers of fire hold their chief mysteries, the whole
surface of the earth, for some extent, seems impregnated with inflam∣able
vapours. A reed stuck into the ground continues to burn like a flambeaux; an
hole made beneath the surface of the earth, instantly becomes a furnace
answering all the purposes of a culinary fire. There they make lime by
merely burying the stones in the earth, and watch with veneration the
appearances of a flame that has not been extinguished for times immemorial.
How different are men in various <PB N="87" REF="108"/> climates! This deluded
people worship these vapours as a deity, which in other parts of the world
are considered as one of the greatest evils.</P>

a very little way under the surface of the earth, and we have hitherto had no
opportu∣nities of exploring further. Without all doubt the wonders that are
still unknown surpass those that have been represented, as there are
depths of thousands of miles which are hidden from our enquiry. The only
tidings we have from those unfathomable regions are by means of volcanoes,
those burning mountains that seem to discharge their materials from the
lowest abysses of the earth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Busson, vol. i. p. 291.</BIBL></NOTE>. A volcano may be
considered as a cannon of immense size, the mouth of which is often near

torrents of flame and sulphur, and <PB REF="109"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="88" REF="111"/> rivers of
melted metal. Whole clouds of smoke and ashes, with rocks of enormous
size, are dis∣charged to many miles distance; so that the force of the
most powerful artillery, is but as a breeze agitating a feather in
comparison. In the deluge of fire and melted matter which runs down the
sides of the mountain, whole cities are sometimes swallowed up and
con∣sumed. Those rivers of liquid fire are some∣times two hundred feet
deep; and, when they harden, frequently form considerable hills. Nor is the
danger of these confined to the eruption only: but the force of the internal
fire strug∣gling for vent, frequently produces earth∣quakes through the whole
region where the volcano is situated. So dreadful have been these
appearances, that men's terrors have added new horrors to the scene, and they
have regard∣ed as prodigies, what we know to be the result of natural
causes. Some philosophers have con∣sidered them as vents communicating
with the fires of the center, and the ignorant as the mouths of hell itself.
Astonishment produces fear, and fear superstition: the inhabitants of
Iceland believe the bellowings of Hecla are nothing else but the cries of the
damned, and that its eruptions are contrived to encrease their tortures.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="112"/>But if we regard this astonishing scene
of terror with a more tranquil and inquisitive eye, we shall find that
these conflagrations are pro∣duced by very obvious and natural causes. We
have already been apprized of the various mineral substances in the bosom
of the earth, and their aptness to burst out into flames. Marcasites and
pyrites, in particular, by being humefied with water, or air, contract this
heat, and often endeavour to expand with ir∣resistible explosion.
These, therefore, being lodged in the depths of the earth, or in the bosom
of mountains, and being either washed by the accidental influx of waters
below, or fanned by air, insinuating itself through per∣pendicular
fissures from above, take fire at first by only heaving in earthquakes,
but at length by bursting through every obstacle, and making their dreadful
discharge in a volcano.</P>
<P>These volcanoes are found in all parts of the earth: in Europe
there are three that are very remarkable; Aetna in Sicily, Vesuvius in Italy,
and Hecla in Iceland. Aetna has been a volcano for ages immemorial. Its
eruptions are very violent, and its discharge has been known to cover the
earth sixty-eight feet deep. In the year 1537, an eruption of this mountain
pro∣duced an earthquake through the whole island, <PB N="90" REF="113"/> for
twelve days, overturned many houses, and at last formed a new aperture
which over∣whelmed all within five leagues round. The cinders thrown up were
driven even into Italy, and its burnings were seen at Malta at the distance
of sixty leagues. There is nothing more awful, says Kircher, than the
eruptions of this mountain, nor nothing more dangerous than attempting to
examine its appearances, even long after the eruption has ceased. As we
at∣tempt to clamber up its steepy sides, every step we take upward, the
feet sink back half way. Upon arriving near the summit, ashes and snow,
with an ill assorted conjunction, present nothing but objects of
desolation. Nor is this the worst, for, as all places are covered over,
many ca∣verns are entirely hidden from the sight, into which, if the enquirer
happens to fall, he sinks to the bottom, and meets inevitable destruction.
Upon coming to the edge of the great crater, nothing can sufficiently
represent the tremen∣dous magnificence of the scene. A gulph two miles
over, and so deep that no bottom can be seen; on the sides pyramidical
rocks starting out between apertures that emit smoke and flame; all this
accompanied with a sound that never ceases, louder than thunder, strikes
the bold with horror, and the religious with vene∣ration <PB N="91" REF="114"/>
for him that has power to controle its burnings.</P>
<P>In the descriptions of Vesuvius, or Hecla, we shall find
scarce any thing but a repetition of the same terrible objects, but rather
lessened, as these mountains are not so large as the former. The crater
of Vesuvius is but a mile across, according to the same author; whereas
that of Aetna is two. On this particular, how∣ever, we must place no
dependance, as these caverns every day alter; being lessened by the
mountains sinking in at one eruption, and enlarged by the fury of another. It
is not one of the least remarkable particulars respect∣ing Vesuvius, that
Pliny the naturalist was suf∣focated in one of its eruptions; for his
cu∣riosity impelling him too near, he found him∣self involved in smoke
and cinders when it was too late to retire; and his companions hardly escaped
to give an account of the misfor∣tune. It was in that dreadful eruption that
the city of Herculaneum was overwhelmed; the ruins of which have been lately
discovered at sixty feet distance below the surface, and, what is
still more remarkable, forty feet below the bed of the sea. One of the
most remarkable erup∣tions of this mountain was in the year 1707, which is
finely described by Valetta, a part of <PB N="92" REF="115"/> whose
description I shall beg leave to trans∣late.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Towards the latter end of summer, in the year
1707, the mount Vesuvius, that had for a long time been silent, now began
to give some signs of commotion. Little more than inter∣nal murmurs at
first were heard, that seemed to contend within the lowest depths of the
mountain; no flame, nor even any smoak was as yet seen. Soon after some
smoak appeared by day, and a flame by night, which seemed to brighten all
the campania. At intervals also it shot off substances with a sound
very like that of artillery, but which, even at so great a dis∣tance as we
were at, infinitely exceeded them in greatness. Soon after it began to throw
up ashes, which becoming the sport of the winds, fell at great distances,
and some many miles. To this succeeded showers of stones, which killed
many of the inhabitants of the valley, but made a dreadful ravage among the
cattle. Soon after a torrent of burning matter began to roll down the sides
of the mountain, at first with a slow and gentle motion, but soon with
encreased celerity. The matter thus poured out, when cold, seemed, upon
inspection, to be of vitrified earth, the whole united into a mass of more
than stony hardness. But what <PB N="93" REF="116"/> was particularly
observable was, that upon the whole surface of these melted materials, a
light spongy stone seemed to float, while the lower body was of the
hardest substance, of which our roads are usually made. Hitherto there
were no appearances but what had been often re∣marked before; but on the third
or fourth day, seeming flashes of lightening were shot forth from the
mouth of the mountain, with a noise far exceeding the loudest thunder.
These flashes, in colour and brightness, resembled what we usually
see in tempests, but they assumed a more twisted and serpentine
form. After this followed such clouds of smoak and ashes, that the whole
city of Naples, in the midst of the day, was involved in nocturnal
darkness, and the nearest friends were unable to distinguish each other
in this frightful gloom. If any per∣son attempted to stir out without
torch-light he was obliged to return, and every part of the city was filled
with supplications and terror; at length, after a continuance of some
hours, about one o'clock at midnight, the wind blow∣ing from the north, the
stars began to be seen; the heavens, though it was night, began to grow
brighter; and the eruptions, after a con∣tinuance of fifteen days, to
lessen. The tor∣rent of melted matter was seen to extend from 
<PB N="94" REF="117"/> the mountain down to the shore; the people began to
return to their former dwellings, and the whole face of nature to resume its
former appearance."</Q></P>
<P>The famous bishop Berkley gives an account of one of these
eruptions in a manner some∣thing different from the former. 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol.
ii. p. 209.</BIBL></NOTE>"In the year 1717, and the middle of April, with much
difficulty I reached the top of mount Vesuvius, in which I saw a vast
apperture full of smoak, which hindered me from seeing its depth and
figure. I heard within that horrid gulph cer∣tain extraordinary sounds, which
seemed to proceed from the bowels of the mountain, a sort of murmuring,
sighing, dashing sound, and between whiles a noise like that of thunder
or cannon, with a clattering like that of tiles falling from the tops of
houses into the streets. Sometimes, as the wind changed, the smoak grew
thinner, discovering a very ruddy flame, and the circumference of the crater
streaked with red and several shades of yellow. After an hour's stay,
the smoak being moved by the wind, gave us short and partial prospects of
the great hollow; in the flat bottom of which I could discern two furnaces
almost contigu∣ous; that on the left seeming about three yards 
<PB N="95" REF="118"/> over, glowing with ruddy flame, and throwing up red hot
stones, with an hideous noise, which, as they fell back, caused the
clattering already taken notice of. May 8, in the morning, I ascended the top
of Vesuvius a second time, and found a different face of things. The
smoak ascending upright, gave a full prospect of the crater, which, as I
could judge, was about a mile in circumference, and an hundred yards deep. A
conical mount had been formed since my last visit in the middle of the
bottom, which I could see was made by the stones, thrown up and fallen back
again into the cra∣ter. In this new hill remained the two furnaces already
mentioned. The one was seen to throw up every three or four minutes, with a
dread∣ful sound, a vast number of red hot stones, at least three
hundred feet higher than my head, as I stood upon the brink; but as there was
no wind, they fell perpendicularly back from whence they had been discharged.
The other was filled with red hot liquid matter, like that in the furnace of a
glass-house; raging and working like the waves of the sea, with a short
abrupt noise. This matter would sometimes boil over, and run down the
side of the conical hill, appearing at first red hot, but changing colour
as it hardened and cooled. Had the <PB N="96" REF="119"/> wind driven in our
faces, we had been in no small danger of stifling by the sulphureous
smoak, or being killed by the masses of melted minerals, that were shot
from the bottom. But as the wind was favourable, I had an oppor∣tunity of
surveying this amazing scene for above an hour and an half together. On the
fifth of June, after an horrid noise, the mountain was seen at Naples to
work over; and about three days after, its thunders were renewed so, that not
only the windows in the city, but all the houses shook. From that time it
continued to overflow, and sometimes at night were seen co∣lumns of fire
shooting upward from its summit. On the tenth, when all was thought to be
over, the mountain again renewed its terrors, roaring and raging most
violently. One cannot form a juster idea of the noise, in the most
violent fits of it, than by imagining a mixed sound, made up of the raging of
a tempest, the mur∣mur of a troubled sea, and the roaring of thun∣der and
arillery, confused all together. Though we heard this at the distance of
twelve miles, yet it was very terrible. I therefore resolved to approach
nearer to the mountain; and, accord∣ingly, three or four of us got into a boat,
and were set ashore at a little town, situated at the foot of the
mountain. From thence we rode <PB N="97" REF="120"/> about four or five miles,
before we came to the torrent of fire that was descending from the side of
the volcano; and here the roaring grew ex∣ceeding loud and terrible as we
approached. I observed a mixture of colours in the cloud, above the crater,
green, yellow, red, blue. There was likewise a ruddy dismal light in the
air, over that tract where the burning river flowed. These circumstances,
set off and aug∣mented by the horror of the night; made a scene the most
uncommon and astonishing I ever saw; which still encreased as we
approached the burning river. Imagine a vast torrent of liquid fire, rolling
from the top, down the side of the mountain, and with irresistible fury
bearing down and consuming vines, olives, and houses; and divided into
different channels, according to the inequalities of the mountain. The
largest stream seemed half a mile broad at least, and five miles long.
I walked so far before my companions up the mountain, along the side of the
river of fire, that I was obliged to retire in great haste, the sulphureous
steam having sur∣prized me, and almost taken away my breath. During our
return, which was about three o'clock in the morning, the roaring of the
mountain was heard all the way, while we ob∣served it throwing up huge
spouts of fire and <PB N="98" REF="121"/> burning stones, which falling,
resembled the stars in a rocket. Sometimes I observed two or three
distinct columns of flame, and sometimes one only that was large enough to
fill the whole crater. These burning columns, and fiery stones, seemed to
be shot a thousand feet per∣pendicular above the summit of the volcano:
and in this manner the mountain continued raging for six or eight days after.
On the eighteenth of the same month the whole appear∣ance ended, and the
mountain remained per∣fectly quiet, without any visible smoke or
flame."</Q></P>
<P>The matter which is found to roll down from the mouth of all
volcanoes in general, re∣sembles the dross that is thrown from a smith's
forge. But it is different, perhaps, in various parts of the globe; for, as we
have already said, there is not a quarter of the world that has not its
volcanoes. In Asia, particularly in the islands of the Indian ocean, there
are many. One of the most famous is that of Albouras, near Mount Taurus, the
summit of which is continually on fire, and covers the whole ad∣jacent
country with ashes. In the island of Ternate there is a volcano, which
some tra∣vellers assert, burns most furiously in the times of the
equinoxes, because of the winds which <PB N="99" REF="122"/> then contribute
to encrease the flames. In the Molucca islands there are many burning
moun∣tains; they are also seen in Japan, and the islands adjacent; and in
Java and Sumatra, as well as in other of the Philippine islands. In Africa
there is a cavern, near Fez, which con∣tinually sends forth either smoke or
flames. In the Cape de Verde islands, one of them, called the Island del
Fuogo, continually burns; and the Portuguese, who frequently attempted a
set∣tlement there, have as often been obliged to desist. The Peak of
Teneriffe is, as every body knows, a volcano that seldom desists from
eruptions. But of all parts of the earth, Ame∣rica is the place where those
dreadful irregu∣larities of nature are the most conspicuous. Vesuvius,
and Aetna itself, are but mere fire∣works, in comparison to the burning
moun∣tains of the Andes; which, as they are the highest mountains of the
world, so also are they the most formidable for their eruptions. The
mountain of Arequipa in Peru, is one of the most celebrated; Carassa, and
Malahallo, are very considerable; but that of Cotopaxi, in the province of
Quito, exceeds any thing we have hitherto read or heard of. The mountain of
Cotopaxi, as described by Ulloa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i.
p. 442.</BIBL></NOTE>, is more <PB N="100" REF="123"/> than three miles
perpendicular from the sea; and it became a volcano at the time of the
Spaniards first arrival in that country. A new eruption of it happened in the
year 1743, hav∣ing been some days preceded by a continual roaring in its
bowels. The sound of one of these mountains is not like that of the
vol∣canoes in Europe, confined to a province, but is heard at an hundred and
fifty miles distance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i. p.
442.</BIBL></NOTE>. 
<Q REND="inline">"An aperture was made in the summit of this
immense mountain; and three more about equal heights, near the middle of its
declivity, which was at that time buried under prodigious masses of snow.
The ignited substances ejected on that occasion, mixed with a prodigious
quantity of ice and snow, melting amidst the flames, were carried down with
such astonishing rapidity, that in an instant the valley from Callo to
Lata∣cunga was overflowed; and besides its ravages in bearing down the
houses of the Indians, and other poor inhabitants, great numbers of people
lost their lives. The river of Latacunga was the channel of this terrible
flood; till being too small for receiving such a prodigious current, it
overflowed the adjacent country, like a vast lake, near the town, and carried
away all the buildings within its reach. The inhabitants re∣tired 
<PB N="101" REF="124"/> into a spot of higher ground behind the town, of which
those parts which stood within the limits of the current were totally
destroyed. The dread of still greater devastations did not subside
for three days; during which, the vol∣cano ejected cinders, while torrents of
melte ice and snow poured down its sides. The erup∣tion lasted several
days, and was accompanied with terrible roarings of the wind, rushing through
the volcano still louder than the former rumblings in its bowels. At last
all was quiet, neither fire nor smoke to be seen, nor noise to be heard;
till in the ensuing year, the flames again appeared with recruited violence,
forcing their passage through several other parts of the mountain, so
that in clear nights the flames being reflected by the transparent ice,
formed an awfully magnificent illumination."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the appearance and the effect of those fires which proceed
from the more inward re∣cesses of the earth; for that they generally come
from deeper regions than man has hitherto ex∣plored, I cannot avoid thinking,
contrary to the opinion of Mr. Buffon, who supposes them rooted but a very
little way below the bed of the mountain. We can never suppose, says this
great naturalist, that these substances are ejected 
<PB N="102" REF="125"/> from any great distance below, if we only con∣sider
the great force already required to fling them up to such vast heights
above the mouth of the mountain; if we consider the substances thrown up,
which we shall find upon inspection to be the same with those of the
mountain be∣low; if we take into our consideration, that air is always
necessary to keep up the flame; but, most of all, if we attend to one
circumstance, which is, that if these substances were exploded from a
vast depth below, the same force required to shoot them up so high,
would act against the sides of the volcano, and tear the whole moun∣tain in
pieces. To all this specious reasoning, particular answers might easily
be given; as that the length of the funnel encreases the force of the
explosion; that the sides of the funnel are actually often burst with the
great violence of the flame; that air may be supposed at depths at least
as far as the perpendicular fissures de∣scend. But the best answer is
a well-known fact; namely, that the quantity of matter dis∣charged from Aetna
alone, is supposed, upon a moderate computation, to exceed twenty times the
original bulk of the mountain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher, Mund.
Subt. vol. 1. p. 202.</BIBL></NOTE>. The greatest part of Sicily seems
covered with its eruptions. <PB N="103" REF="126"/> The inhabitants of Catanea
have found, at the distance of several miles, streets and houses,
sixty feet deep, overwhelmed by the lava or matter it has discharged. But
what is still more remarkable, the walls of these very houses have been
built of materials evidently thrown up by the mountain. The inference from all
this is very obvious; that the matter thus exploded cannot belong to the
mountain itself; otherwise, it would have been quickly consumed; it
can∣not be derived from moderate depths, since its amazing quantity evinces,
that all the places near the bottom must have long since been ex∣hausted;
nor can it have an extensive, and, if I may so call it, a superficial
spread, for then the country round would be quickly under∣mined; it must,
therefore, be supplied from the deeper regions of the earth; those
un∣discovered tracts where the Deity performs his wonders in solitude,
satisfied with self-appro∣bation!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of Earthquakes.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given the theory of volcanoes, we have in some measure
given also that of earthquakes. They both seem to proceed from the same
cause, only with this difference, that the fury of the volcano is spent in
the eruption, that of an earthquake spreads wider and acts more fatally by
being confined. The volcano only affrights a province, earthquakes have laid
whole kingdoms in ruin.</P>
<P>Philosophers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Aristotle,
Agricola, Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE> have taken some pains to di∣stinguish
between the various kinds of earth∣quakes, such as the tremulous, the
pulsative, the perpendicular, and the inclined; but these are rather the
distinctions of art than of na∣ture, mere accidental differences arising
from the situation of the country or of the cause. If, for instance, the
confined fire acts directly under a province or a town, it will heave the earth
perpendicularly upward, and produce a <HI>perpen∣dicular</HI> earthquake. If it
acts at a distance, it <PB N="105" REF="128"/> will raise that tract
obliquely, and thus the in∣habitants will perceive an <HI>inclined</HI>
one.</P>
<P>Nor does it seem to me that there is much greater reason for Mr.
Buffon's distinction of earthquakes. One kind of which he supposes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. 328.</BIBL></NOTE> to be produced by fire
in the manner of vol∣canoes, and confined to but a very narrow cir∣cumference.
The other kind he ascribes to the struggles of confined air, expanded by
heat in the bowels of the earth, and endeavouring to get free. For how do
these two causes dif∣fer? Fire is an agent of no power whatsoever without
air. It is the air, which being at first comprest, and then dilated in a
cannon, that drives the ball with such force. It is the air struggling for
vent in a volcano, that throws up its contents to such vast heights. In
short, it is the air confined in the bowels of the earth, and acquiring
elasticity by heat, that produces all those appearances which are generally
ascrib∣ed to the operation of fire. When, therefore, we are told that there
are two causes of earth∣quakes, we only learn, that a greater or smaller
quantity of heat produces those terrible effects; for air is the only active
operator in either.</P>
<P>Some philosophers, however, have been wil∣ling to give the air as
great a share in produc∣ing <PB N="106" REF="129"/> these terrible efforts
as they could; and magnifying its powers have called in but a very moderate
degree of heat to put it in action. Although experience tells us that the earth
is full of inflamable materials, and that fires are produced wherever we
descend; although it tells us that those countries, where there are
volcanoes, are most subject to earthquakes, yet they step out of the way,
and so find a new so∣lution. These only allow but just heat enough to
produce the most dreadful phoenomena, and backing their assertions with
long calculations, give theory an air of demonstration. Mr. Amontons<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires de l' Accademie de Sciences, An.
1703.</BIBL></NOTE> has been particularly sparing of the internal heat in
this respect; and has shewn, perhaps accurately enough, that a very
mode∣rate degree of heat may suffice to give the air amazing powers of
expansion.</P>
<P>It is amazing enough, however, to trace the progress of a
philosophical fancy let loose in immaginary speculations. They run thus: 
<Q REND="inline">"A very moderate degree of heat may bring the air
into a condition capable of producing earthquakes; for the air at the depth of
forty-three thousand five hundred and twenty-eight fathom below the surface
of the earth, becomes almost as heavy as quick-silver. 
<PB N="107" REF="130"/> This, however, is but a very slight depth in
comparison of the distance to the center, and is scarce a seventieth
part of the way. The air, therefore, at the center must be infinitely heavier
than mercury, or any body that we know of. This granted, we shall take
some∣thing more, and say, that it is very probable there is nothing but air
at the center. Now let us suppose this air heated, by some means, even to
the degree of boiling water, as we have proved that the density of the air is
here very great, its elasticity must be in proportion: an heat, therefore,
which at the surface of the earth would have produced but a slight
expan∣sive force, must at the center produce one very extraordinary, and,
in short, be perfectly irre∣sistible. Hence this force may with great
ease produce earthquakes; and if encreased it may convulse the globe; it
may (by only adding figures enough to the calculation) destroy the solar
system, and even the fixed stars them∣selves."</Q> These reveries
generally produce no∣thing; for, as I have ever observed, encreased
calculations, while they seem to tire the me∣mory, give the reasoning
faculty perfect re∣pose.</P>
<P>However, as earthquakes are the most for∣midable ministers of
nature, it is not to be <PB N="108" REF="131"/> wondered that a multitude of
writers have been curiously employed in their consideration. Woodward has
ascribed the cause to a stop∣page of the waters below the earth's
surface by some accident. These being thus accumu∣lated, and yet acted
upon by fires, which he supposes still deeper, both contribute to heave
up the earth upon their bosom. This he thinks accounts for the lakes of water
produced in an earthquake, as well as for the fires that sometimes burst
from the earth's surface upon those dreadful occasions. There are others
still who have supposed that the earth may be itself the cause of its
own convulsions. When, say they, the roots or basis of some large tract
is worn away by a fluid underneath, the earth sinking therein, its weight
occasions a tremor of the adjacent parts, sometimes produc∣ing a noise,
and sometimes an inundation of water. Not to tire the reader with an
history of opinions instead of facts, some have ascribed them to
electricity, and some to the same causes that produce thunder.</P>
<P>It would be tedious, therefore, to give all the various opinions
that have employed the speculative upon this subject. The activity of the
internal heat seems alone sufficient to ac∣count for every appearance that
attends these <PB N="109" REF="132"/> tremendous irregularities of nature. To
con∣ceive this distinctly, let us suppose at some vast distance
under the earth, large quantities of in∣flamable matter, pyrites, bitumens, and
mar∣casites disposed, and only waiting for the as∣persion of water,
or the humidity of the air, to put their fires in motion: at last, this
dreadful mixture arrives; waters find their way into those depths, through
the perpendicular fissures; or air insinuates itself through the same
minute apertures: strait new appearances ensue: those substances,
which for ages before lay dormant, now conceive new apparent qualities; they
grow hot, produce new air, and only want room for expansion. However, the
narrow apertures by which the air or water had at first admission, are
now closed up; yet as new air is continually generated, and as the heat every
moment gives this air new elasticity, it at length bursts, and dilates all
round; and, in its struggles to get free, throws all above it into similar
convulsions. Thus an earthquake is produced, more or less extensive,
according to the depth or the great∣ness of the cause.</P>
<P>But before we proceed with the causes, let us take a short view
of the appearances which have attended the most remarkable earth∣quakes. By
these we shall see how far the <PB N="110" REF="133"/> theorist
corresponds with the historian. The greatest we find in antiquity, is
that mentioned by Pliny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plin. lib. ii. cap.
86.</BIBL></NOTE>, in which twelve cities in Asia Minor were swallowed up
in one night: he tells us also of another, near the lake Thrasymene, which
was not perceived by the armies of the Car∣thaginians and Romans, that were
then en∣gaged near that lake, although it shook the greatest part of Italy.
In another place<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid. lib. iii. cap.
85.</BIBL></NOTE> he gives the following account of an earthquake of an
extraordinary kind. 
<Q REND="inline">"When Lucius Marcus, and Sextus Julius, were
consuls, there appeared a very strange prodigy of the earth, (as I have
read in the books of Aetruscan dis∣cipline) which happened in the province
of Mutina. Two mountains shocked against each other, approaching and
retiring with the most dreadful noise. They, at the same time, and in the
midst of the day, appeared to cast forth fire and smoke, while a vast
number of Roman knights and travellers from the Aemilian way, stood and
continued amazed spectators. Se∣veral towns were destroyed by this shock;
and all the animals that were near them were killed."</Q> In the times of
Trajan, the city of Antioch, and a great part of the adjacent country, was
buried by an earthquake. About <PB N="111" REF="134"/> three hundred years
after, in the times of Justinian, it was once more destroyed, together with
forty thousand inhabitants: and, after an interval of sixty years, the
same ill-fated city was a third time overturned, with the loss of not
less than sixty thousand souls. In the year 1182, most of the cities
of Syria, and the king∣dom of Jerusalem, were destroyed by the same
accident. In the year 1594, the Italian histo∣rians describe an earthquake
at Puteoli, which caused the sea to retire two hundred yards from its
former bed.</P>
<P>But one of those most particularly described in history, is
that of the year 1693; the damages of which were chiefly felt in Sicily, but
its mo∣tion perceived in Germany, France, and Eng∣land. It extended to a
circumference of two thousand six hundred leagues; chiefly affecting the
sea-coasts, and great rivers; more per∣ceivable also upon the mountains
than in the valleys. Its motions were so rapid, that those who lay at their
length, were tossed from side to side, as upon a rolling billow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans.</BIBL></NOTE>. The walls were dashed
from their foundations; and no less than fifty-four cities, with an
incredible num∣ber of villages, were either destroyed or greatly damaged. The
city of Catanea, in particular, <PB N="112" REF="135"/> was utterly overthrown.
A traveller, who was on his way thither, at the distance of some miles,
perceived a black cloud, like night, hanging over the place. The sea, all of
a sud∣den, began to roar; Mount Aetna to send forth great spires of
flame; and soon after a shock en∣sued, with a noise as if all the
artillery in the world had been at once discharged. Our tra∣veller, being
obliged to alight instantly, felt himself raised a foot from the ground;
and turn∣ing his eyes to the city, he with amazement saw nothing but a thick
cloud of dust in the air. The birds flew about astonished; the sun was
darkened; the beasts ran howling from the hills; and, although the shock
did not continue above three minutes, yet near nineteen thousand of the
inhabitants of Sicily perished in the ruins. Catanea, to which city the
describer was tra∣velling, seemed the principal scene of ruin; its place
only was to be found; and not a footstep of its former magnificence was to be
seen re∣maining.</P>
<P>The earthquake which happened in Jamaica, in 1692, was very
terrible, and its description sufficiently minute. 
<Q REND="inline">"In two minutes time it destroyed the town of
Portugal, and sunk the houses in a gulph forty fathoms deep. It was
attended with an hollow rumbling noise, like <PB N="113" REF="136"/> that of
thunder; and, in less than a minute, three parts of the houses, and their
inhabitants, were all sunk quite under water. While they were thus
swallowed up on one side of the street, on the other, the houses were
thrown into heaps; the sand of the street rising like the waves of the
sea, lifting up those that stood upon it, and immediately overwhelming
them in pits. All the wells discharged their waters with the most vehement
agitation. The sea felt an equal share of turbulence, and, bursting over
its mounds, deluged all that came in its way. The fissures of the earth
were, in some places, so great, that one of the streets appeared twice as
broad as formerly. In many places, however, it opened and closed again, and
continued this agitation for some time. Of these openings, two or three
hundred might be seen at a time; in some whereof the people were
swallowed up; in others, the earth closing, caught them by the middle, and
thus crushed them instantly to death. Other openings, still more dreadful
than the rest, swallowed up whole streets; and others, more formidable
still, spouted up whole cataracts of water, drowning such as the
earthquake had spared. The whole was attended with the most noisome
stench; while the thundering of the di∣stant falling mountains, the whole
sky overcast <PB N="114" REF="137"/> with a dusky gloom, and the crush
of falling ha∣bitations, gave unspeakable horror to the scene. After this
dreadful calamity was over, the whole island seemed converted into a
scene of desolation; scarce a planter's house was left standing;
almost all were swallowed up; houses, people, trees, shared one
universal ruin; and, in their places appeared great pools of water, which,
when dried up by the sun, left only a plain of barren sand, without any
vestige of former inhabitants. Most of the rivers, during the earthquake,
were stopt up by the falling in of the mountains; and it was not till after
some time that they made themselves new channels. The mountains seemed
particularly attacked by the force of the shock; and it was supposed that
the principal seat of the concussion was among them. Those who were
saved, got on board ships in the harbour; where many re∣mained above two
months, the shocks con∣tinuing during that interval with more or less
violence every day."</Q></P>
<P>As this description seems to exhibit all the ap∣pearances that
usually make up the catalogue of terrors belonging to an earthquake, I will
suppress the detail of that which happened at Lisbon, in our own times,
and which is too re∣cent to require a description. In fact, there are 
<PB N="115" REF="138"/> few particulars in the accounts of those who were
present at that scene of desolation, that we have not more minutely and
accurately trans∣mitted to us by former writers, whose nar∣ratives I have
for that reason preferred. I will, therefore, close this description of
human cala∣mities, with the account of the dreadful earth∣quake at Calabria, in
1638. It is related by the celebrated Father Kircher, as it happened while he
was on his journey to visit Mount Aetna, and the rest of the wonders that
lie towards the south of Italy. I need scarce inform the reader that
Kircher is considered, by scholars, as one of the greatest prodigies of
learning.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Having hired a boat, in company with four more, two
friars of the order of St. Francis, and two seculars, we launched, on the
twenty-fourth of March, from the harbour of Messina, in Sicily, and
arrived, the same day, at the pro∣montory of Pelorus. Our destination was
for the city of Euphaemia, in Calabria, where we had some business to
transact, and where we designed to tarry for some time. However,
Providence seemed willing to cross our design; for we were obliged to
continue for three days at Pelorus, upon account of the weather; and though we
often put out to sea, yet we were as often driven back. At length, however,
wea∣ried <PB N="116" REF="139"/> with the delay, we resolved to prosecute
our voyage; and, although the sea seemed more than usually agitated, yet
we ventured forward. The gulph of Charybdis, which we approach∣ed, seemed
whirled round in such a manner as to form a vast hollow, verging to a point
in the center. Proceeding onward, and turning my eyes to Aetna, I saw it
cast forth large volumes of smoke, of mountainous sizes, which entirely
covered the whole island, and blotted out the very shores from my view.
This, together with the dreadful noise, and the sulphureous stench, which
was strongly perceived, filled me with apprehensions that some more
dreadful cala∣mity was impending. The sea itself seemed to wear a very
unusual appearance; those who have seen a lake in a violent shower of
rain co∣vered all over with bubbles, will conceive some idea of its
agitations. My surprize was still encreased by the calmness and
serenity of the weather; not a breeze, not a cloud which might be
supposed to put all Nature thus into motion. I therefore warned my
companions that an earthquake was approaching; and, after some time, making
for the shore with all possible diligence, we landed at Tropaea, happy
and thankful for having escaped the threaten∣ing dangers of the sea. 
<P><PB N="117" REF="140"/>"But our triumphs at land were of short
du∣ration; for we had scarce arrived at the Jesuits College in that city,
when our ears were stunned with an horrid sound, resembling that of an
in∣finite number of chariots driven fiercely for∣ward, the wheels rattling, and
the thongs cracking. Soon after this, a most dreadful earthquake ensued;
so that the whole tract upon which we stood, seemed to vibrate, as if we
were in the scale of a balance that continued wavering. This motion, however,
soon grew more violent; and being no longer able to keep my legs, I was
thrown prostrate upon the ground. In the mean time, the universal ruin
round me, redoubled my amazement. The crash of falling houses, the
tottering of towers, and the groans of the dying, all contributed to raise my
terror and despair. On every side of me I saw nothing but a scene of
ruin; and dan∣ger threatening wherever I should fly. I com∣mended myself to
God as my last great refuge. At that hour, O how vain was every sub∣lunary
happiness! wealth, honour, empire, wis∣dom, all mere useless sounds,
and as empty as the bubbles in the deep. Just standing on the threshold
of eternity, nothing but God was my pleasure; and the nearer I approached, I
only loved him the more. After some time, how∣ever, <PB N="118" REF="141"/>
finding that I remained unhurt, amidst the general concussion, I
resolved to venture for safety, and running as fast as I could, reached
the shore, but almost terrified out of my reason. I did not search long
here till I found the boat in which I had landed, and my companions also,
whose terrors were even greater than mine. Our meeting was not of that kind
where every one is desirous of telling his own happy escape; it was all
silence, and a gloomy dread of im∣pending terrors.</P> 
<P>"Leaving this seat of desolation, we pro∣secuted our
voyage along the coasts; and the next day came to Rochetta, where we landed,
although the earth still continued in violent agitations. But we were
scarce arrived at our inn, when we were once more obliged to return to the
boat; and, in about half an hour, we saw the greatest part of the town, and
the inn at which we had set up, dashed to the ground, and burying all its
inhabitants beneath its ruins.</P> 
<P>"In this manner, proceeding onward in our little vessel,
finding no safety at land, and yet, from the smallness of our boat,
having but a very dangerous continuance at sea, we at length landed at
Lopizium, a castle midway between Tropaea and Euphemia, the city to which, as
I <PB N="119" REF="142"/> said before, we were bound. Here, wherever I turned
my eyes, nothing but scenes of ruin and horror appeared; towns and castles
levelled to the ground; Strombalo, though at sixty miles distance, belching
forth flames in an unusual manner, and with a noise which I could
distinctly hear. But my attention was quickly turned from more remote to
contiguous danger. The rumbling sound of an approaching earthquake, which we
by this time were grown acquainted with, alarmed us for the consequences; it
every moment seemed to grow louder, and to ap∣proach more near. The place on
which we stood now began to shake most dreadfully, so that being unable
to stand, my companions and I caught hold of whatever shrub grew next us,
and supported ourselves in that manner.</P> 
<P>"After some time, this violent paroxysm ceasing, we again
stood up, in order to pro∣secute our voyage to Euphaemia, that lay within
sight. In the mean time, while we were pre∣paring for this purpose, I
turned my eyes towards the city, but could see only a frightful dark cloud,
that seemed to rest upon the place. This the more surprized us, as the
weather was so very serene. We waited, therefore, till the cloud was past
away: then turning to look for the city, it was totally sunk. Wonderful to
tell! <PB N="120" REF="143"/> nothing but a dismal and putrid lake was seen
where it stood. We looked about to find some one that could tell us of its
sad catastrophe, but could see none. All was become a melancholy
solitude; a scene of hideous desolation. Thus proceeding pensively
along, in quest of some human being that could give us some little
information, we at length saw a boy sitting by the shore, and appearing
stupified with terror. Of him, therefore, we enquired concerning the fate of
the city; but he could be got to give us no answer. We entreated him with
every expression of tenderness and pity to tell us; but his senses
were quite wrapt up in the con∣templation of the danger he had escaped. We
offered him some victuals, but he seemed to loath the sight. We still
persisted in our offices of kindness; but he only pointed to the place of
the city, like one out of his senses; and then running up into the woods,
was never heard of after. Such was the fate of the city of Eu∣phaemia: and as
we continued our melancholy course along the shore, the whole coast, for
the space of two hundred miles, presented nothing but the remains of
cities; and men scattered, without an habitation, over the fields.
Pro∣ceeding thus along, we at length ended our distressful voyage by
arriving at Naples, after <PB N="121" REF="144"/> having escaped a thousand
dangers both at sea and land."</P></Q></P>
<P>The reader, I hope, will excuse me for this long translation
from a favourite writer, and that the sooner, as it contains some
particulars relative' to earthquakes not to be found else∣where. From the
whole of these accounts we may gather, that the most concomitant
cir∣cumstances are these:</P>
<P>A rumbling sound before the earthquake. This proceeds from the
air, or fire, or both, forcing their way through the chasms of the earth, and
endeavouring to get free, which is also heard in volcanoes.</P>
<P>A violent agitation, or heaving of the sea, sometimes before and
sometimes after that at land. This agitation is only a similar effect
produced on the waters with that at land, and may be called, for the sake of
perspicuity, a sea-quake; and this, also, is produced by vol∣canoes.</P>
<P>A spouting up of waters to great heights. It is not easy to
describe the manner in which this is performed; but volcanoes also perform
the same, Vesuvius being known frequently to eject a vast body of
waters.</P>
<P>A rocking of the earth to and fro, and some∣times a perpendicular
bouncing, if it may be <PB N="122" REF="145"/> so called, of the same. This
difference chiefly arises from the situation of the place with re∣spect
to the subterranean fire. Directly under, it lifts; at a farther distance,
it rocks.</P>
<P>Some earthquakes seem to travel onward, and are felt in different
countries at different hours the same day. This arises from the great
shock being given to the earth at one place, and that being communicated
onward by an undulatory motion, successively affects different regions in
its progress. As the blow given by a stone falling in a lake is not
perceived at the shores till some time after the first
concussion.</P>
<P>The shock is sometimes instantaneous, like the explosion of
gunpowder; and sometimes tremulous, and continuing for several minutes. The
nearer the place where the shock is first given, the more instantaneous
and simple it appears. At a greater distance the earth re∣doubles the
first blow with a sort of vibratory continuation.</P>
<P>As waters have generally so great a share in producing
earthquakes, it is not to be won∣dered that they should generally follow
those breaches made by the force of fire, and ap∣pear in the great chasms
which the earthquake has opened.</P>
<P>These are some of the most remarkable <PB N="123" REF="146"/>
phoenomena of earthquakes, presenting a fright∣ful assemblage of the
most terrible effects of air, earth, fire, and water.</P>
<P>The valley of Solfatara, near Naples, seems to exhibit, in a
minuter degree, whatever is seen of this horrible kind on the great theatre
of Nature. This plain, which is about twelve hundred feet long, and a
thousand broad, is em∣bosomed in mountains, and has in the middle of it a
lake of noisome blackish water, covered with a bitumen, that floats upon
its surface. In every part of this plain, caverns appear smoking with
sulphur, and often emitting flames. The earth, wherever we walk over it,
trembles be∣neath the feet. Noises of flames, and the hissing of waters,
are heard at the bottom. The water sometimes spouts up eight or ten feet
high. The most noisome fumes, foetid water, and sulphu∣reous vapours,
offend the smell. A stone thrown into any of the caverns, is ejected again
with considerable violence. These appearances gene∣rally prevail when the
sea is any way disturbed; and the whole seems to exhibit the appearance
of an earthquake in miniature. However, in this smaller scene of wonders,
as well as in the greater, there are many appearances for which perhaps we
shall never account; and many questions may be asked, which no
conjectures <PB N="124" REF="147"/> can thoroughly resolve. It was the fault
of the philosophers of the last age, to be more inqui∣sitive after the
causes of things, than after the things themselves. They seemed to think
that a confession of ignorance cancelled their claims to wisdom: they,
therefore, had a solution for every demand. But the present age has grown,
if not more inquisitive, at least more modest; and none are now ashamed
of that ignorance which labour can neither remedy nor remove.</P>

<DIV1 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Appearance of New Islands, and Tracts; and of
the disappearing of others.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have taken a survey only of the evils which are
produced by subterranean fires, but we have mentioned nothing of the
be∣nefits they may possibly produce. They may be of use in warming and
cherishing the ground, in promoting vegetation, and giving a more
ex∣quisite flavour to the productions of the earth. The imagination of a
person who has never been out of our own mild region, can scarcely reach to
that luxuriant beauty with which all Nature appears cloathed in those very
countries that we <PB N="125" REF="148"/> have but just now described as
desolated by earthquakes, and undermined by subterranean fires. It must
be granted, therefore, that though in those regions they have a greater
share in the dangers, they have also a larger pro∣portion in the benefits
of Nature.</P>
<P>But there is another advantage arising from subterranean fires,
which, though hitherto dis∣regarded by man, yet may one day become
serviceable to him; I mean, that while they are found to swallow up cities
and plains in one place, they are also known to produce promon∣taries and
islands in another. We have many instances of islands being thus formed
in the midst of the sea, which though for a long time barrren, have
afterwards become fruitful seats of happiness and industry.</P>
<P>New islands are formed in two ways; either suddenly, by the
action of subterraneous fires; or more slowly, by the deposition of mud,
car∣ried down by rivers, and stopped by some ac∣cident<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 343.</BIBL></NOTE>. With respect
particularly to the first, ancient historians, and modern travellers, give
us such accounts as we can have no room to doubt of. Seneca assures us,
that in his time the island of Therasia appeared unexpectedly to some
mariners, as they were employed in <PB N="126" REF="149"/> another pursuit.
Pliny assures us, that thirteen islands in the Mediterranean appeared at
once emerging from the water; the cause of which he ascribes rather to the
retiring of the sea in those parts, than to any subterraneous elevation.
However, he mentions the island of Hiera, near that of Therasia, as formed
by subterraneous explosions; and adds to his list several others,
formed in the same manner. In one of which he relates that fish in great
abundance were found, and that all those who eat of them died shortly
after.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"On the twenty-fourth of May<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hist. del Accad. an. 1708, p. 23.</BIBL></NOTE>, in the
year 1707, a slight earthquake was perceived at Santorin; and the day
following, at sun-rising, an object was seen by the inhabitants of that
island, at two or three miles distance at sea, which appeared like a
floating rock. Some per∣sons, desirous either of gain, or incited by
cu∣riosity, went there, and found, even while they stood upon this rock,
that it seemed to rise be∣neath their feet. They perceived also, that its
surface was covered with pumice stones, and oysters, which it had
raised from the bottom. Every day after, until the fourteenth of June, this
rock seemed considerably to encrease; and then was found to be half a
mile round, and <PB N="127" REF="150"/> about thirty feet above the sea. The
earth of which it was composed, seemed whitish, with a small portion of
clay. Soon after this the sea again appeared troubled, and steams arose,
which were very offensive to the inhabitants of San∣torin. But on the
sixteenth of the succeeding month, seventeen or eighteen rocks more were
seen to rise out of the sea, and at length to join together. All this was
accompanied with the most terrible noise, and fires that proceeded from the
island that was newly formed. The whole mass, however, of all this
new-formed earth, uniting, encreased every day, both in height and breadth,
and, by the force of its explosions, cast forth rocks to seven miles
distance. This continued to bear the same dreadful appearances till the
month of Novem∣ber in the same year; and it is at present a vol∣cano which
sometimes renews its explosions. It is about three miles in circumference;
and more than from thirty-five to forty feet high."</Q></P>
<P>It seems extraordinary, that about this place in particular,
islands have appeared at different times, particularly that of Hiera,
mentioned above, which has received considerable addi∣tions in succeeding
ages. Justin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Justin, l. 30, cap.
4.</BIBL></NOTE> tells us, that at the time the Macedonians were at war with 
<PB N="128" REF="151"/> the Romans, a new island appeared between those of
Theramenes and Therasia, by means of an earthquake. We are told, that this
became half as big again about a thousand years after; another island
rising up by its side, and joining to it, so as scarce at present to
be distinguished from the former.</P>
<P>A new island was formed, in the year 1720, near that of Tercera,
near the continent of Africa, by the same causes. In the beginning of
December, at night, there was a terrible earthquake at that place, and the top
of a new island appeared, which cast forth smoke in vast quantities.
The pilot of a ship, who approached it, sounded on one side of this
island, and could not find ground at sixty fathom. At the other side the
sea was totally tinged of a different colour, exhibiting a mixture of white,
blue, and green; and was very shallow. This island, on its first
appearance, was larger than it is at present; for it has, since that time,
sunk in such a manner, as to be scarce above water.</P>
<P>A traveller, whom these appearances could not avoid affecting,
speaks of them in this man∣ner: 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol.
v. p. 197.</BIBL></NOTE>"What can be more surprizing than to see fire not
only break out of the bowels of the earth, but also to make itself a
passage through <PB N="129" REF="152"/> the waters of the sea! What can be
more ex∣traordinary or foreign to our common notions of things, than to see
the bottom of the sea rise up into a mountain above the water, and be∣come
so firm an island as to be able to resist the violence of the
greatest storms! I know that sub∣terraneous fires, when pent in a narrow
passage, are able to raise up a mass of earth as large as an island.
But that this should be done in so regular and exact a manner, that the
water of the sea should not be able to penetrate and ex∣tinguish those
fires; that, after having made so many passages, they should retain
force enough to raise the earth; and, in fine, after having been
extinguished, that the mass of earth should not fall down, or sink
again with its own weight, but still remain in a manner suspended over
the great arch below! This is what to me seems more surprizing than any
thing that has been related of Mount Aetna, Vesuvius, or any other
volcano."</Q></P>
<P>Such are his sentiments; however, there are few of these
appearances any way more extraordinary than those attending volcanoes and
earthquakes in general. We are not more to be surprized that inflammable
sub∣stances should be found beneath the bottom of the sea, than at
similar depths at land. These <PB N="130" REF="153"/> have all the force of
fire giving expansion to air, and tending to raise the earth at the bot∣tom
of the sea, till it at length heaves above water. These marine volcanoes
are not so fre∣quent; for, if we may judge of the usual pro∣cedure of
Nature, it must very often happen that, before the bottom of the sea is
elevated above the surface, a chasm is opened in it, and then the water
pressing in, extinguishes the vol∣cano before it has time to produce its
effects. This extinction, however, is not effected with∣out very great
resistance from the fire beneath. The water, upon dashing into the
cavern, is very probably at first ejected back with great violence; and thus
some of those amazing water∣spouts are seen, which have so often
astonished the mariner, and excited curiosity.—But of these in
their place.</P>
<P>Besides the production of those islands by the action of fire,
there are others, as was said, pro∣duced by rivers or seas carrying mud,
earth, and such like substances, along with their cur∣rents; and at
last depositing them in some par∣ticular place. At the mouths of most
great rivers, there are to be seen banks, thus formed by the sand and mud
carried down with the stream, which have rested at that place, where the
force of the current is diminished by its junction with the sea. These
banks, by slow <PB N="131" REF="154"/> degrees, encrease at the bottom of
the deep; the water, in those places, is at first found by mariners to grow
more shallow; the bank soon heaves up above the surface; it is
considered, for a while, as a tract of useless and barren sand; but the
seeds of some of the more hardy vege∣tables are driven thither by the wind,
they take root, and thus binding the sandy surface, the whole spot is
cloathed in time with a beautiful verdure. In this manner there are delightful
and inhabited islands at the mouths of many rivers, particularly the Nile,
the Po, the Missi∣sippi, the Ganges, and the Senegal. There has been, in
the memory of man, a beautiful and large island formed in this manner, at the
mouth of the river Nanquin, in China, made from de∣positions of mud at its
opening: it is not less than sixty miles long, and about twenty broad. La
Loubere informs us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lettres Curieuses et
Edificantes, sec. xi, p. 234.</BIBL></NOTE>, in his voyage to Siam, that
these sand-banks encrease every day, at the mouths of all the great
rivers in Asia: and hence he asserts, that the navigation up these
rivers becomes every day more difficult; and will, at one time or another, be
totally ob∣structed. The same may be remarked with re∣gard to the Wolga,
which has at present se∣venty openings into the Caspian sea; and of 
<PB N="132" REF="155"/> the Danube, which has seven into the Euxine. We have
had an instance of the formation of a new island, not very long since, at
the mouth of the Humber, in England. 
<Q REND="inline">"It is yet within the memory of man," says the
relator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil Trans. vol. iv. p.
251.</BIBL></NOTE>, "since it began to raise its head above the ocean. It
began its appearance at low water, for the space of a few hours; and was
buried again till the next tide's retreat. Thus, successively, it lived
and died, until the year 1666, when it began to maintain its ground against
the insult of the waves; and then first invited the aid of human
industry. A bank was thrown about its rising grounds; and being thus
defended from the in∣cursions of the sea, it became firm and solid, and,
in a short time, afforded good pasturage for cattle. It is about nine miles
in circumference, and is worth to the proprietor about eight hundred pounds a
year."</Q> It would be endless to mention all the islands that have been
thus formed; and the advantages that have been de∣rived from them. However, it
is frequently found, that new islands thus formed, may often be considered
as only turning the rivers from their former beds; so that, in proportion as
land is gained at one part, it is lost by the overflow∣ing of some
other.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="156"/>Little, therefore, is gained by such
accessions. Nor is there much more by the new islands which are
sometimes formed from the spoils of the continent. Mariners assure us,
that there are sometimes whole plains unrooted from the main lands, by floods
and tempests. These be∣ing carried out to sea, with all their trees and
animals upon them, are frequently seen float∣ing in the ocean, and exhibiting
a surprizing appearance of rural tranquillity in the midst of danger. The
greatest part, however, having the earth at their roots at length washed
away, are dispersed, and their animals drowned; but now and then some are
found to brave the fury of the ocean, till being stuck either among rocks or
sands, they again take firm footing, and become permanent islands.</P>
<P>As different causes have thus concurred to produce new islands,
so we have accounts of others that the same causes have contributed to
destroy. We have already seen the power of earthquakes exerted in sinking
whole cities, and leaving lakes in their room. There have been islands, and
regions also, that have shared the same fate; and have sunk with their
inhabitants, never more to be heard of. Thus Pausanias<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pausanias, I.8, in Arcad. p. 509.</BIBL></NOTE> tells us
of an island, called Chryses, that was <PB N="134" REF="157"/> sunk near
Lemnos. Pliny mentions several; among others, the island Cea, for thirty
miles, having been washed away, with several thousands of its
inhabitants. But of all the noted de∣vastations of this kind, the total
submersion of the island of Atalantis, as mentioned by Plato, has been
most the subject of speculation. Man∣kind, in general, now consider the
whole of his account as an ingenious fable; but when fables are grown famous by
time and authority, they become an agreeable, if not a necessary part of
literary information.</P>
<P>About nine thousand years are passed, says Plato<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plato in Critia.</BIBL></NOTE>, since the island of
Atalantis was in being. The priests of Egypt were well ac∣quainted with it;
and the first heroes of Athens gained much glory in their wars with the
inha∣bitants. This island was as large as Asia Minor and Syria united; and
was situated beyond the pillars of Hercules, in the Atlantic ocean. The
beauty of the buildings, and the fertility of the soil, were far beyond any
thing a modern ima∣gination can conceive; gold and ivory were every where
common; and the fruits of the earth offered themselves without cultivation.
The arts, and the courage of the inhabitants, were not inferior to the
happiness of their situ∣ation; <PB N="135" REF="158"/> and they were
frequently known to make conquests, and overrun the continent of Europe and
Asia. The imagination of the po∣etical philosopher riots in the
description of the natural and acquired advantages, which they long enjoyed
in this charming region. If, says he, we compare that country to our own,
ours will appear a mere wasted skeleton, when op∣posed to it. Their
mountains to the very tops were cloathed with fertility, and poured down rivers
to enrich the plains below.</P>
<P>However, all these beauties and benefits were destroyed in one
day by an earthquake sinking the earth, and the sea overwhelming it. At
present, not the smallest vestiges of such an island are to be
found; Plato remains as the only authority for its existence; and
philosophers dispute about its situation. It is not for me to enter into
the controversy, when there appears but little probability to support the
fact; and, indeed, it would be useless to run back nine thousand years in
search of difficulties, as we are surrounded with objects that more
closely affect us, and that demand admiration at our very doors. When I
consider, as Lactantius sug∣gests, the various vicissitudes of
nature; lands swallowed by yawning earthquakes, or over∣whelmed in the deep;
rivers and lakes disap∣pearing, <PB N="136" REF="159"/> or dried away;
mountains levelled into plains; and plains swelling up into moun∣tains; I
cannot help regarding this earth as a place of very little stability; as a
transient abode of still more transitory beings.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING at last, in some measure, emerged from the deeps of the
earth, we come to a scene of greater splendour; the contemplation of its
external appearance. In this survey, its moun∣tains are the first objects
that strike the ima∣gination, and excite our curiosity. There is not,
perhaps, any thing in all nature that im∣presses an unaccustomed
spectator with such ideas of awful solemnity, as these immense piles
of Nature's erecting, that seem to mock the minuteness of human
magnificence.</P>
<P>In countries where there are nothing but plains, the smallest
elevations are apt to excite wonder. In Holland, which is all a flat, they
shew a little ridge of hills, near the sea-side, which Boerhaave
generally marked out to his pupils as being mountains of no small
con∣sideration. <PB N="137" REF="160"/> What would be the sensations of
such an auditory, could they at once be pre∣sented with a view of the
heights and precipices of the Alps, or the Andes! Even among us in England, we
have no adequate ideas of a moun∣tain-prospect; our hills are generally
sloping from the plain, and cloathed to the very top with verdure; we can
scarce, therefore, lift our imaginations to those immense piles whose
tops peep up behind intervening clouds, sharp and precipitate, and reach to
heights that human avarice or curiosity have never been able to ascend.</P>
<P>We, in this part of the world, are not, for that reason, so
immediately interested in the question which has so long been agitated
among philosophers, concerning what gave rise to these inequalities on
the surface of the globe. In our own happy region, we generally see no
inequa∣lities but such as contribute to use and beauty; and we, therefore,
are amazed at a question en∣quiring how such necessary inequalities
came to be formed, and seeming to express a wonder how the globe comes to
be so beautiful as we find it. But though with us there may be no great
cause for such a demand, yet in those places where mountains deform the
face of Nature, where they pour down cataracts, or give fury 
<PB N="138" REF="161"/> to tempests, there seems to be good reason for
enquiry either into their causes or their uses. It has been, therefore,
asked by many, in what manner mountains have come to be formed; or for what
uses they are designed?</P>
<P>To satisfy curiosity in these respects, much reasoning has
been employed, and very little knowledge propagated. With regard to the first
part of the demand, the manner in which mountains were formed, we have already
seen the conjectures of different philosophers on that head. One
supposing that they were formed from the earth's broken shell, at the
time of the deluge: another, that they existed from the creation, and only
acquired their deformities in process of time: a third, that they owed their
original to earthquakes: and still a fourth, with much more plausibility
than the rest, ascribing them entirely to the fluctuations of the deep,
which he supposes in the beginning to have covered the whole earth. Such as
are pleased with disquisitions of this kind, may consult Burnet,
Whiston, Wood∣ward, or Buffon. Nor would I be thought to decry any mental
amusements, that at worst keep us innocently employed; but, for my own
part, I cannot help wondering how the opposite demand has never come to be
made; and why <PB N="139" REF="162"/> philosophers have never asked how we
come to have plains? Plains are sometimes more preju∣dicial to man than
mountains. Upon plains, an inundation has greater power; the beams of the sun
are often collected there with suffocat∣ing fierceness; they are
sometimes found desert for several hundred miles together, as in the
country east of the Caspian sea, although other∣wise fruitful, merely
because there are no risings nor depressions to form reservoirs, or
collect the smallest rivulet of water. The most rational answer,
therefore, why either mountains or plains were formed, seems to be, that they
were thus fashioned by the hand of Wisdom, in order that pain and
pleasure should be so contiguous as that morality might be ex∣ercised
either in bearing the one, or commu∣nicating the other.</P>
<P>Indeed, the more I consider this dispute re∣specting the
formation of mountains, the more I am struck with the futility of the
question. There is neither a strait line, nor an exact super∣ficies, in
all nature. If we consider a circle, even with mathematical precision, we
shall find it formed of a number of small right lines, joining at angles
together. These angles, there∣fore, may be considered in a circle as
mountains are upon our globe; and to demand the reason <PB N="140" REF="163"/>
for the one being mountainous, or the other angular, is only to ask why a
circle is a circle, or a globe is a globe. In short, if there be no surface
without inequality in Nature, why should we be surprized that the earth has
such? It has often been said, that the inequa∣lities of its surface are
scarce distinguishable, if compared to its magnitude; and I think we have
every reason to be content with the answer.</P>
<P>Some, however, have avoided the difficulty by urging the final
cause. They alledge that mountains have been formed merely because they are
useful to man. This carries the en∣quirer but a part of the way; for no one
can affirm that in all places they are useful. The contrary is known, by
horrid experience, in those valleys that are subject to their influence.
However, as the utility of any part of our earthly habitation, is a very
pleasing and flatter∣ing speculation to every philosopher, it is not to
be wondered that much has been said to prove the usefulness of these.
For this pur∣pose, many conjectures have been made that have received a
degree of assent even beyond their evidence; for men were unwilling to
be∣come more miserably wise.</P>
<P>It has been alledged, as one principal ad∣vantage 
<PB N="141" REF="164"/> that we derive from them, that they serve, like hoops
or ribs, to strengthen our earth, and to bind it together. In consequence
of this theory, Kircher has given us a map of the earth, in this manner hooped
with its moun∣tains; which might have a much more solid foundation, did it
entirely correspond with truth.</P>
<P>Others have found a different use for them, especially when they
run surrounding our globe; which is, that they stop the vapours that are
continually travelling from the equator to the poles; for these being urged
by the heat of the sun, from the warm regions of the line, must all be
accumulated at the poles, if they were not stopped in their way by those
high ridges of mountains which cross their direction. But an answer to this
may be, that all the great moun∣tains in America lie lengthwise, and
therefore do not cross their direction.</P>
<P>But to leave these remote advantages, others assert, that not
only the animal but vegetable part of the creation would perish for want of
convenient humidity, were it not for their friendly assistance. Their
summits are, by these, supposed to arrest, as it were, the vapours
which float in the regions of the air. Their large inflexions, and channels,
are considered as <PB N="142" REF="165"/> so many basons prepared for the
reception of those thick vapours, and impetuous rains, which descend into
them. The huge caverns beneath are so many magazines or conservatories of
water for the peculiar service of man: and those orifices by which the
water is discharged upon the plain, are so situated as to enrich and
render them fruitful, instead of returning through subterraneous channels
to the sea, after the performance of a tedious and fruitless
cir∣culation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Nature Display'd, vol. iii. p.
88.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>However this be, certain it is that al∣most all our great rivers
find their source among mountains; and, in general, the more extensive the
mountain, the greater the river: thus the river Amazons, the greatest in the
world, has its source among the Andes, which are the highest mountains on
the globe; the river Niger travels a long course of several hundred miles
from the mountains of the Moon, the highest in all Africa; and the Da∣nube
and the Rhine proceed from the Alps, which are probably the highest mountains
of Europe.</P>
<P>It need scarce be said that, with respect to height, there are
many sizes of mountains, from the gently rising upland, to the tall craggy 
<PB N="143" REF="166"/> precipice. The appearance is in general differ∣ent in
those of different magnitudes. The first are cloathed with verdure to the
very tops, and only seem to ascend to improve our prospects, or supply
us with a purer air: but the lofty mountains of the other class have a very
dif∣ferent aspect. At a distance their tops are seen, in wavy ridges, of
the very colour of the clouds, and only to be distinguished from them by
their figure, which, as I have said, resembles the billows of the
sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lettres Philosophiques sur la
Formation, &amp;c. p. 196.</BIBL></NOTE>. As we approach, the mountain
assumes a deeper colour; it gathers upon the sky, and seems to hide
half the horizon behind it. Its summits also are become more distinct,
and appear with a broken and perpendicular line. What at first seemed a
single hill, is now found to be a chain of con∣tinued mountains, whose tops
running along in ridges, are embosomed in each other; so that the
curvatures of one are fitted to the promi∣nences of the opposite side, and
form a winding valley between, often of several miles in ex∣tent; and all the
way continuing nearly of the same breadth. Nothing can be finer, or more
exact than Mr. Pope's description of a traveller straining up the Alps.
Every mountain he comes to he thinks will be the last; he finds, 
<PB N="144" REF="167"/> however, an unexpected hill rise before him; and that
being scaled, he finds the highest sum∣mit almost at as great a
distance as before. Upon quitting the plain, he might have left a green and a
fertile soil, and a climate warm and pleasing. As he ascends, the ground
assumes a more russet colour; the grass becomes more mossy; and
the weather more moderate. Still as he ascends, the weather becomes more
cold, and the earth more barren. In this dreary passage, he is often
entertained with a little valley of surprizing verdure, caused by the
reflected heat of the sun collected into a narrow spot on the surrounding
heights. But it much more frequently happens that he sees only frightful
precipices beneath, and lakes of amazing depths; from whence rivers are formed,
and fountains derive their original. On those places next the highest
summits, ve∣getation is scarcely carried on; here and there a few plants of
the most hardy kind appear: The air is intolerably cold; either continually
refrigerated with frosts, or disturbed with tem∣pests. All the ground
here wears an eternal covering of ice, and snows that seem constantly
accumulating. Upon emerging from this war of the elements, he ascends into a
purer and a serener region, where vegetation is entirely 
<PB N="145" REF="168"/> ceased; where the precipices, composed entirely of
rocks, rise perpendicularly above him; while he views beneath him all the
combat of the ele∣ments; clouds at his feet; and thunders darting upward from
their bosoms below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol i.</BIBL></NOTE>.
A thou∣sand meteors, which are never seen on the plain, present
themselves. Circular rainbows<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>; mock suns; the shadow of the
mountain projected upon the body of the air<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. v. p. 152.</BIBL></NOTE>; and the
traveller's own image, reflected as in a looking-glass, upon the opposite
cloud<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such are, in general, the wonders that present themselves to a
traveller in his journey either over the Alps or the Andes. But we must not
suppose that this picture exhibits either a constant or an invariable
likeness of those stupendous heights. Indeed, nothing can be more
capricious or irre∣gular than the forms of many of them. The tops of some run
in ridges for a considerable length, without interruption; in others, the
line seems notched by great vallies to an amazing depth. Sometimes a
solitary and a single moun∣tain rises from the bosom of the plain; and
sometimes extensive plains, and even provinces, as those of Savoy and
Quito, are found embo∣somed near the tops of mountains. In general, 
<PB N="146" REF="169"/> however, those countries that are most moun∣tainous,
are the most barren and uninhabitable.</P>
<P>If we compare the heights of mountains with each other, we shall
find that the greatest and highest are found under the Line<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon. Passim.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is thought by some,
that the rapidity of the earth's motion in these parts, together with the
great∣ness of the tides there, may have thrown up those stupendous
masses of earth. But, be the cause as it may, it is a remarkable fact,
that the inequalities of the earth's surface are greatest there. Near the
Poles, the earth, indeed, is craggy and uneven enough; but the heights of the
mountains there, are very inconsiderable. On the contrary, at the Equator,
where Nature seems to sport in the amazing size of all her productions,
the plains are extensive; and the mountains remarkably lofty. Some of them
are known to rise three miles perpendicular above the bed of the ocean.</P>
<P>To enumerate the most remarkable of these, according to their
size, we shall begin with the Andes, of which we have an excellent
descrip∣tion by Ulloa, who went thither by command of the king of Spain, in
company with the French Academicians, to measure a degree of the meridian.
His journey up these <PB N="147" REF="170"/> mountains is too curious not to
give an extract from it.</P>
<P>After many incommodious days sailing up the river Guayaquil, he
arrived at Caracol, a town situated at the foot of the Andes. Nothing could
exceed the inconveniencies which he ex∣perienced in this voyage, from the flies
and moschitoes (an animal resembling our gnat). 
<Q REND="inline">"We were the whole day," says he, "in con∣tinual
motion to keep them off; but at night our torments were excessive. Our
gloves, indeed, were some defence to our hands; but our faces were entirely
exposed; nor were our cloaths a sufficient defence for the rest of our
bodies; for their stings penetrating through the cloth, caused a very
painful and fiery itching. One night, in coming to an anchor near a large and
handsome house that was uninhabited, we had no sooner seated
ourselves in it, than we were attacked on all sides by swarms of
moschi∣toes, so that it was impossible to have one mo∣ment's quiet.
Those who had covered them∣selves with cloaths made for this purpose,
found not the smallest defence; wherefore, hoping to find some relief in
the open fields, they ventured out, though in danger of suffering in a more
terrible manner from the serpents. But both places were equally obnoxious. On
quitting <PB N="148" REF="171"/> this inhospitable retreat, we the next night
took up our quarters in an house that was in∣habited; the host of which
being informed of the terrible manner we had past the night be∣fore, he
gravely told us, that the house we so greatly complained of, had been
forsaken on account of its being the purgatory of a soul. But we had more
reason to believe that it was quitted on account of its being the purgatory
of the body. After having journeyed for up∣wards of three days, through boggy
roads, in which the mules at every step sunk up to their bellies, we began
at length to perceive an al∣teration in the climate; and having been long
accustomed to heat, we now began to feel it grown sensibly colder. 
<P>"It is remarkable, that at Tariguagua we often see instances
of the effects of two opposite temperatures, in two persons happening to
meet; one of them leaving the plains below, and the other descending from the
mountain. The former thinks the cold so severe, that he wraps himself up
in all the garments he can procure; while the latter, finds the heat so
great, that he is scarce able to bear any cloaths whatsoever. The one
thinks the water so cold, that he avoids being sprinkled by it; the other
is so delighted with its warmth, that he uses it <PB N="149" REF="172"/> as
a bath. Nor is the case very different in the same person, who
experiences the same diver∣sity of sensation upon his journey up, and
upon his return. This difference only proceeds from the change naturally felt
at leaving a climate to which one has been accustomed, and coming into
another of an opposite temperature.</P> 
<P>"The ruggedness of the road from Tarigua∣gua, leading up the
mountain, is not easily described. In some parts, the declivity is so
great, that the mules can scarce keep their footing; and in others, the
acclivity is equally difficult. The trouble of having people going before to
mend the road, the pains arising from the many falls and bruises, and the
being con∣stantly wet to the skin, might be supported, were not these
inconveniences augmented by the sight of such frightful precipices, and
deep abysses, as must fill the mind with ceaseless terror. There are
some places where the road is so steep, and yet so narrow, that the
mules are obliged to slide down, without making any use of their feet
whatsoever. On one side of the rider, in this situation, rises an
eminence of several hun∣dred yards; and on the other, an abyss of equal
depth; so that if he in the least checks his mule, so as to destroy the
equilibrium, they both must unavoidably perish.</P> 
<P><PB N="150" REF="173"/>"After having travelled about nine days in
this manner, slowly winding along the side of the mountain, we began to
find the whole country covered with an hoar frost, and an hut, in which we
lay, had ice on it. Having escaped many perils, we at length, after a journey
of fifteen days, arrived upon the plain, on the ex∣tremity of which stands
the city of Quito, the capital of one of the most charming regions upon
earth. Here, in the center of the torrid zone, the heat is not only very
tolerable, but in some places the cold also is painful. Here they enjoy all
the temperature and advantages of perpetual spring; their fields being always
covered with verdure, and enamelled with flowers of the most lively colours.
However, although this beautiful region be higher than any other country in the
world, and although it took up so many days of painful journey in the
ascent, it is still overlooked by tremendous mountains; their sides
covered with snow, and yet flaming with volcanoes at the top. These seem
piled one upon the other, and rise to a most astonishing height, with
great coldness. However, at a determined point above the surface of the
sea, the congelation is found at the same height in all the mountains.
Those parts which are not subject to a continual frost, 
<PB N="151" REF="174"/> have here and there growing upon them a rush,
resembling the genista, but much more soft and flexible. Towards the
extremity of the part where the rush grows, and the cold begins to
encrease, is found a vegetable, with a round bulbous head, which, when dried,
becomes of amazing elasticity. Higher up the earth is en∣tirely bare of
vegetation, and seems covered with eternal snow. The most remarkable
moun∣tains are, that of Cotopaxi, (already described as a volcano)
Chimborazo, and Pichincha. Co∣topaxi is more than three geographical miles
above the surface of the sea: the rest are not much inferior. On the top
of the latter was my station for measuring a degree of the me∣ridian; where
I suffered particular hardships, from the intenseness of the cold, and
the vio∣lence of the storms. The sky around was, in general, involved in
thick fogs, which, when they cleared away, and the clouds, by their gravity,
moved nearer to the surface of the earth, they appeared surrounding the
foot of the mountain, at a vast distance below, like a sea,
encompassing an island in the midst of it. When this happened, the
horrid noises of tem∣pests were heard from beneath, then discharging
themselves on Quito, and the neighbouring <PB N="152" REF="175"/> country. I
saw the lightenings issue from the clouds, and heard the thunders roll
far beneath me. All this time, while the tempest was raging below, the
mountain top, where I was placed, enjoyed a delightful serenity; the wind was
abated; the sky clear; and the enlivening rays of the sun moderated the
severity of the cold. However, this was of no very long du∣ration, for the
wind returned with all its vio∣lence, and with such velocity as to dazzle the
sight; whilst my fears were encreased by the dreadful concussions of
the precipice, and the fall of enormous rocks; the only sounds that were
heard in this frightful situation."</P> </Q></P>
<P>Such is the animated picture of these moun∣tains, as given us by
this ingenious Spaniard: and I believe the reader will wish that I had made
the quotation still longer. A passage over the Alps, or a journey
across the Pyrenees, appear petty trips or excursions, in the comparison;
and yet these are the most lofty mountains we know of in Europe.</P>
<P>If we compare the Alps with the mountains already described, we
shall find them but little more than one half of the height of the former.
The Andes, upon being measured by the baro∣meter, are found above three
thousand, one <PB N="153" REF="176"/> hundred and thirty-six toises or
fathoms above the surface of the sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa,
vol. i. p. 442.</BIBL></NOTE>. Whereas the highest point of the Alps is not
above sixteen hundred. The one, in other words, is above three miles high;
the other, about a mile and a half. The highest mountains of Asia are,
Mount Taurus, Mount Immaus, Mount Caucasus, and the mountains of
Japan.—Of these, none equals the Andes in height; although Mount
Caucasus, which is the highest of them, makes very near approaches. Father
Verbiest tells of a moun∣tain in China, which he measured, and found a mile
and a half high<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Verbiest, alla
Chine.</BIBL></NOTE>. In Africa, the moun∣tains of the Moon, famous for giving
source to the Niger, and the Nile, are rather more noted than known. Of the
Pike of Teneriffe, one of the Canary Islands that lie off this coast, we
have more certain information. In the year 1727, it was visited by a company
of English merchants, who travelled up to the top, where they observed its
height, and the volcano on its very summit<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. v.</BIBL></NOTE>. They found it an heap
of mountains, the highest of which rises over the rest like a
sugar-loaf, and gives a name to the whole mass. It is computed to be a mile
and an half perpendicular from the surface of the <PB N="154" REF="177"/>
sea. Kircher gives us an estimate of the heights of most of the other
great mountains in the world; but as he has taken his calcu∣lations, in
general, from the ancients, or from modern travellers, who had not the art of
mea∣suring them, they are quite incredible. The art of taking the heights of
places by the baro∣meter, is a new, and an ingenious invention. As the air
grows lighter as we ascend, the fluid in the tube rises in due proportion:
thus the instrument being properly marked, gives the height with a tolerable
degree of exactness; at least enough to satisfy curiosity.</P>
<P>Few of our great mountains have been esti∣mated in this manner;
travellers having, per∣haps, been deterred, by a supposed impossibility
of breathing at the top. However, it has been invariably found, that the air in
the highest that our modern travellers have ascended, is not at all too
fine for respiration. At the top of the Pike of Teneriff, there was found no
other incon∣venience from the air, except its coldness; at the top of the
Andes, there was no difficulty of breathing perceived. The accounts, therefore,
of those who have asserted that they were un∣able to breathe, although at
much less heights, are greatly to be suspected. In fact, it is very
natural for mankind to paint those obstacles as <PB N="155" REF="178"/>
insurmountable, which they themselves have not had the fortitude or
perseverance to sur∣mount.</P>
<P>The difficulty and danger of ascending to the tops of mountains,
proceeds from other causes, not the thinness of the air. For in∣stance,
some of the summits of the Alps have never yet been visited by man. But
the reason is, that they rise with such a rugged and pre∣cipitate
ascent, that they are utterly inaccessible. In some places they appear
like a great wall of six or seven hundred feet high; in others, there
stick out enormous rocks, that hang upon the brow of the steep, and every
moment threaten destruction to the traveller below.</P>
<P>In this manner almost all the tops of the highest mountains are
bare and pointed. And this naturally proceeds from their being so
con∣tinually assaulted by thunders and tempests. All the earthy
substances with which they might have been once covered, have for ages been
washed away from their summits; and nothing is left remaining, but
immense rocks, which no tem∣pest has hitherto been able to destroy.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, time is every day, and every hour, making
depredations; and huge frag∣ments are seen tumbling down the precipice,
either loosened from the summit by frost or <PB N="156" REF="179"/> rains,
or struck down by lightening. Nothing can exhibit a more terrible picture
than one of these enormous rocks, commonly larger than an house, falling
from its height, with a noise louder than thunder, and rolling down the
side of the mountain. Doctor Plot tells us of one in particular, which being
loosened from its bed, tumbled down the precipice, and was partly shattered
into a thousand pieces. Not∣withstanding, one of the largest fragments of
the same, still preserving its motion, travelled over the plain below,
crossed a rivulet in the midst, and at last stopped on the other
side of the bank! These fragments, as was said, are often struck off by
lightening, and sometimes undermined by rains; but the most usual manner
in which they are disunited from the mountain, is by frost: the rains
insinuating between the interstices of the mountain, continue there until
there comes a frost, and then, when converted into ice, the water swells
with an irresistible force, and pro∣duces the same effect as gun-powder,
splitting the most solid rocks, and thus shattering the summits of
the mountain.</P>
<P>But not rocks alone, but whole mountains are, by various causes,
disunited from each other. We see, in many parts of the Alps, 
<PB N="157" REF="180"/> amazing clefts, the sides of which so exactly
correspond with the opposite, that no doubt can be made of their having
been once joined together. At Cajeta<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
ii. p. 364.</BIBL></NOTE>, in Italy, a mountain was split in this manner by
an earthquake; and there is a passage opened through it, that appears as if
elaborately done by the industry of man. In the Andes these breaches are
frequently seen. That at Thermopyle, in Greece, has been long famous. The
mountain of the Troglodytes, in Arabia, has thus a passage through it: and
that in Savoy, which Nature began, and which Victor Amadeus com∣pleted, is an
instance of the same kind.</P>
<P>We have accounts of some of these disrup∣tions, immediately
after their happening. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the month of June<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hist de l' Accademie des Sciences, p. 4, an.
1715.</BIBL></NOTE>, in the year 1714, a part of the mountain of Diableret, in
the district of Valais, in France, suddenly fell down, be∣tween two and
three o'clock in the afternoon, the weather being very calm and serene. It
was of a conical figure, and destroyed fifty-five cottages in the fall.
Fifteen persons, to∣gether with about an hundred beasts, were also
crushed beneath its ruins, which covered an extent of a good league square.
The dust it occasioned, instantly covered all the neighbour∣hood 
<PB N="158" REF="181"/> in darkness. The heaps of rubbish were more than
three hundred feet high. They stopped the current of a river that ran along
the plain, which now is formed into several new and deep lakes. There
appeared, through the whole of this rubbish, none of those substances
that seemed to indicate that this disruption had been made by means of
subterraneous fires. Most probably, the base of this rocky mountain was
rotted and decayed; and thus fell, without any extraneous violence."</Q> In the
same manner, in the year 1618, the town of Pleurs, in France, was buried
beneath a rocky mountain, at the foot of which it was situated.</P>
<P>These accidents, and many more that might be enumerated of the
same kind, have been pro∣duced by various causes: by earthquakes, as in the
mountain at Cajeta; or by being decayed at the bottom, as at Diableret. But the
most gene∣ral way is, by the foundation of one part of the mountain being
hollowed by waters and, thus wanting a support, breaking from the other. Thus
it generally has been found in the great chasms in the Alps; and thus it
almost always is known in those disruptions of hills, which are known by
the name of land-slips. These are nothing more than the sliding down of
an higher piece of ground, disrooted from its <PB N="159" REF="182"/>
situation by subterraneous inundations, and settling itself upon the
plain below.</P>
<P>There is not an appearance in all nature that so much
astonished our ancestors, as these land∣slips. In fact, to behold a
large upland, with its houses, its corn, and cattle, at once loosened from
its place, and floating, as it were, upon the subjacent water; to behold it
quitting its ancient situation, and travelling forward like a ship, in
quest of new adventures; this is cer∣tainly one of the most extraordinary
appear∣ances that can be imagined; and to a people, ignorant of the powers of
Nature, might well be considered as a prodigy. Accordingly, we find all our
old historians mentioning it as an omen of approaching calamities. In this
more enlightened age, however, its cause is very well known; and, instead
of exciting ominous appre∣hensions in the populace, it only gives rise to
some very ridiculous law-suits among them, about whose the property
shall be; whether the land which has thus slipt, shall belong to the
original possessor, or to him upon whose grounds it has encroached
and settled. What has been the determination of the judges, is not so well
known; but the circumstances of the slips themselves have been minutely
enough, and exactly described.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="183"/>In the lands of Slatberg<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. iv. p. 250.</BIBL></NOTE>, in the
kingdom of Ireland, there stood a declivity, gradually ascending for near
half a mile. In the year 1713, and on the 10th of March, the inhabi∣tants
perceived a crack on its side, somewhat like a furrow made with a plough,
which they imputed to the effects of lightening, as there had been thunder the
night before. However, on the evening of the same day, they were sur∣prized
to hear an hideous confused noise issuing all round from the side of
the hill; and their curiosity being raised, they resorted to the place.
There, to their amazement, they found the earth, for near five acres, all in
gentle motion, and sliding down the hill upon the subjacent plain. This
motion continued the remaining part of the day, and the whole night; nor did
the noise cease during the whole time; pro∣ceeding, probably, from the
attrition of the ground beneath. The day following, however, this strange
journey down the hill ceased en∣tirely; and above an acre of the meadow
below, was found covered with what before composed a part of the
declivity.</P>
<P>However, these slips, when a whole moun∣tain's side seems to
descend, happen but very rarely. There are some of another kind, 
<PB N="161" REF="184"/> ever, much more common; and, as they are always
sudden, much more dangerous. These are snow-slips, well known, and
greatly dreaded by travellers. It often happens, that when snow has long been
accumulated on the tops and on the sides of mountains, it is borne down the
precipice, either by means of tempests, or its own melting. At first, when
loosened, the volume in motion is but small; but it gathers as it continues
to roll; and, by the time it has reached the habitable parts of the mountain,
it is generally grown of enormous bulk. Where∣ever it rolls, it levels all
things in its way; or buries them in unavoidable destruction. In∣stead of
rolling, it sometimes is found to slide along from the top; yet even thus
it is gene∣rally as fatal as before. Nevertheless, we have had an instance,
a few years ago, of a small fa∣mily in Germany, that lived for above a
fort∣night beneath one of these snow-slips. Altho' they were buried,
during that whole time, in utter darkness, and under a bed of some hun∣dred
feet deep, yet they were luckily taken out alive; the weight of the snow
being supported by a beam that kept up the roof; and nourish∣ment being
supplied them by the milk of an ass, if I remember right, that was buried
under the same ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="185"/>But it is not the parts, alone, that are thus
found to subside, whole mountains have been known totally to disappear.
Pliny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plin. I, 2, cap. 93.</BIBL></NOTE> tells
us, that in his own time, the lofty mountain of Cy∣botus, together with the
city of Eurites, were swallowed by an earthquake. The same fate, he says,
attended Phlegium, one of the highest mountains in Aethiopia; which, after
one night's concussion, was never seen more. In more modern times, a very
noted mountain in the Molucca islands, known by the name of the Peak, and
remarkable for being seen at a very great distance from sea, was
swallowed by an earthquake; and nothing but a lake was left in the place
where it stood. Thus, while storms and tempests are levelled against
mountains above, earthquakes and waters are undermining them below. All our
histories talk of their destruction; and very few new ones (if we except
Mount Cenere, and one or two such heaps of cinders) are produced. If
moun∣tains, therefore, were of such great utility as some philosophers
make them to mankind, it would be a very melancholy consideration that such
benefits were diminishing every day. But the truth is, the valleys are
fertilized by that earth which is washed from their sides; 
<PB N="163" REF="186"/> and the plains become richer, in proportion as the
mountains decay.</P>

<DIV1 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of Water.</HEAD>
<P>IN contemplating nature, we shall often find the same
substances possessed of contrary qua∣lities, and producing
opposite effects. Air, which liquifies one substance, dries up another.
That fire which is seen to burn up the desart, is often found, in other
places, to assist the lux∣uriance of vegetation; and water, which, next
to fire, is the most fluid substance upon earth, nevertheless, gives
all other bodies their firm∣ness and durability; so that every element
seems to be a powerful servant, capable either of good or ill, and only
awaiting external direction, to become the friend or the enemy of mankind.
These opposite qualities, in this substance in particular, have not
failed to excite the admi∣ration and enquiry of the curious.</P>
<P>That water is the most fluid penetrating body, next to fire, and
the most difficult to confine, is incontestibly proved by a variety of
experi∣ments. A vessel through which water cannot pass, may be said to
retain any thing. It may <PB N="164" REF="187"/> be objected, indeed, that
syrups, oils, and ho∣ney, leak through some vessels that water can∣not
pass through; but this is far from being the result of the greater tenuity
and fineness of their parts; it is owing to the rosin wherewith the wood of
such vessels abounds, which oils and syrups have a power of
dissolving; so that these fluids, instead of finding their way, may
more properly be said to eat their way through the vessels that contain
them. However, water will at last find its way even through these; for it
is known to escape through vessels of every substance, glass only
excepted. Other bodies may be found to make their way out more readily indeed;
as air, when it finds a vent, will escape at once; and quicksilver,
because of its weight, quickly penetrates through what∣ever chinky vessel
confines it: but water, tho' it operates more slowly, yet always finds a more
certain issue. As, for instance, it is well known that air will not
pass through leather; which water will very readily penetrate. Air also may
be retained in a bladder; but water will quickly ooze through. And those who
drive this to the greatest degree of precision, pretend to say, that it
will pass through pores ten times smaller than air can do. Be this as it
may, we are very certain that its parts are so small that they have 
<PB N="165" REF="188"/> been actually driven through the pores of gold. This has
been proved by the famous Florentine experiment, in which a quantity of water
was shut up in an hollow ball of gold, and then pressed with an huge
force by screws, during which the fluid was seen to ooze out through the
pores of the metal, and to stand, like a dew, upon its surface.</P>
<P>As water is thus penetrating, and its parts thus minute, it may
easily be supposed that they enter into the composition of all bodies,
both vegetable, animal, and fossil. This every che∣mist's experience
convinces him of; and the mixture is the more obvious, as it can always be
separated, by a gentle heat, from those sub∣stances with which it had
been united. Fire, as was said, will penetrate where water cannot pass; but
then it is not so easily to be separated. But there is scarce any
substance from which its water cannot be divorced. The parings or filings
of lead, tin, and antimony, by distillation, yield water plentifully: the
hardest stones, sea salt, nitre, vitriol, and sulphur, are found to
consist chiefly of water; into which they resolve by force of fire. 
<Q REND="inline">"All birds, beasts, and fishes," says Newton,
"insects, trees, and vegetables, with their parts, grow from water; and, by
pu∣trefaction, return to water again."</Q> In short, <PB N="166" REF="189"/>
almost every substance that we see, owes its texture and firmness to
the parts of water that mix with its earth; and, deprived of this fluid, it
falls away, into a mass of shapeless dust and ashes.</P>
<P>From hence we see, as was above hinted, that this most fluid
body, when mixed with others, gives them consistence and form. Water, by
being mixed with earth or ashes, and formed into a vessel, when baked
before the fire, be∣comes a copel, remarkable for this, that it will bear the
utmost force of the hottest furnace that art can contrive. So the Chinese
earth, of which porcelane is made, is nothing more than an artificial
composition of earth and water, united by heat; and which a greater degree of
heat could easily separate. Thus we see a body, extremely fluid of
itself, in some measure as∣suming a new nature, by being united with
others; we see a body, whose fluid and dissolv∣ing qualities are so
obvious, giving consist∣ence and hardness to all the substances of
the earth.</P>
<P>From considerations of this kind, Thales, and many of the ancient
philosophers, held that all things were made of water. In order to confirm
this opinion, Helmont made an expe∣riment, by divesting a quantity of earth
of all its oils and salts, and then putting this earth, <PB N="167" REF="190"/> so prepared, into an earthen pot, which nothing but rain-water
could enter, and planting a wil∣low therein; this vegetable, so planted, grew
up to a considerable heighth and bulk, merely from the accidental
aspersion of rain-water; while the earth in which it was planted, re∣ceived
no sensible dimunition. From this ex∣periment, he concluded, that water was
the only nourishment of the vegetable tribe; and that vegetables, being the
nourishment of animals, all organized substances, therefore, owed their
support and being only to water. But this has been said by Woodward to be
all a mistake: for he shews, that water being impregnated with earthy
particles, is only the conveyer of such substances into the pores of
vegetables, rather than an encreaser of them, by its own bulk: he shews,
that water is ever found to afford so much less nourishment, in
proportion as it is purified by distillation. A plant in distilled water
will not grow so fast as in water not distilled: and if the same be
distilled three or four times over, the plant will scarce grow at all, or
receive any nourishment from it. So that water, as such, does not seem
the proper and only nourishment of vegetables, but only the vehicle thereof,
which contains the nutritious particles, and car∣ries them through all parts of
the plant. Water, <PB N="168" REF="191"/> in its pure state, may suffice to
extend or swell the parts of a plant, but affords vegetable mat∣ter in a
moderate proportion.</P>
<P>However this be, it is agreed on all sides, that water, such as
we find it, is far from being a pure simple substance. The most
genuine, we know, is mixed with exhalations and disso∣lutions of various
kinds; and no expedient that has been hitherto discovered, is capable of
purifying it entirely. If we filter and distill it a thousand times,
according to Boerhaave, it will still depose a sediment: and by repeating
the process, we may evaporate it entirely away, but can never totally remove
its impurities. Some, however, assert, that water, properly distilled,
will have no sediment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hill's History of
Fossils.</BIBL></NOTE>; and that the little white speck which is found at
the bottom of the still, is a substance that enters from without. Kircher
used to shew, in his Musaeum, a phial of water, that had been kept for
fifty years, hermetically sealed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hermetically
sealing a glass-vessel, means no more than heating the mouth of the
phial red hot; and thus when the glass is be∣come pliant, squeezing the
mouth together with a pair of pincers, and then twisting it six or seven
times round, which effectually closes it up.</NOTE>; during which time it
deposed no sediment, but continued as trans∣parent <PB N="169" REF="192"/>
as when first it was put in. How far, therefore, it may be brought to a
state of pu∣rity by distillation, is unknown; but we very well know, that
all such water as we every where see, is a bed in which plants, minerals,
and animals, are all found confusedly floating together.</P>
<P>Rain-water, which is a fluid of Nature's own distilling, and which
has been raised so high by evaporation, is, nevertheless, a very mixed
and impure substance. Exhalations of all kinds, whether salts,
sulphurs, or metals, make a part of its substance, and tend to increase
its weight. If we gather the water that falls, after a thun∣der-clap, in a
sultry summer's day, and let it settle, we shall find a real salt
sticking at the bottom. In winter, however, its impure mix∣tures are fewer;
but still may be separated by distillation. But as to that which is
generally caught pouring from the tops of houses, it is particularly foul,
being impregnated with the smoak of the chimnies, the vapour of the slates
or tiles, and with other impurities that birds and animals may have deposited
there. Besides, though it should be supposed free from all these, it
is mixed with a quantity of air, which, after being kept for some time, will
be seen to se∣parate.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="193"/>Spring-water is next in point of purity. This,
according to Doctor Halley, is collected from the air itself; which being
sated with water, and coming to be condensed by the evening's cold, is
driven against the tops of the moun∣tains, where being condensed, and
collected, it trickles down by the sides, into the cavities of the earth; and
running for a while under∣ground, bubbles up in fountains upon the plain. This
having made but a short cir∣culation, has generally had no long time to
dissolve or imbibe any foreign substances by the way.</P>
<P>River-water is generally more foul than the former. Wherever the
stream flows, it receives a tincture from its channel. Plants, minerals, and
animals, all contribute their share to add to its impurities: so that
such as live at the mouths of great rivers, generally are subject to all
those disorders which contaminated and unwholsome waters are known to
produce. Of all the river∣water in the world, that of the Indus, and the
Thames, are said to be most light and whole∣some.</P>
<P>The impurest fresh water that we know, is that of stagnating
pools and lakes, which, in summer, may be more properly considered as a
jelly of floating insects, than a collection of <PB N="171" REF="194"/> water.
In this, millions of little reptiles, un∣disturbed by any current, which
might crush their frames to pieces, breed and engender. The whole teems with
shapeless life; and only grows more fruitful by encreasing
putrefaction.</P>
<P>Of the purity of all these waters, the light∣ness, and not the
transparency, ought to be the test. Water may be extremely clear and
beau∣tiful to the eye, and yet very much impregnated with mineral principles.
In fact, sea-water is the most transparent of any, and yet is well known
to contain a large mixture of salt and bitumen. On the contrary, those
waters which are lightest, have the fewest dissolutions float∣ing in
them; and may, therefore, be the most useful for all the purposes of
life. But, after all, though much has been said upon this sub∣ject, and
although waters have been weighed with great assiduity, to determine their
degree of salubrity, yet neither this, nor their curdling with soap, nor
any other philosophical standard whatsoever, will answer the purposes
of true in∣formation. Experience alone ought to deter∣mine the useful, or
noxious qualities, of every spring; and experience assures us, that
dif∣ferent kinds of water are adapted to different constitutions. An
incontestible proof of this, are the many medicinal springs throughout the 
<PB N="172" REF="195"/> world, whose peculiar benefits are known to the
natives of their respective countries. These are of various kinds,
according to the different minerals with which they are impregnated; hot,
saline, sulphureous, bituminous, and oily. But the account of these will
come most properly under that of the several minerals by which they are
produced.</P>
<P>After all, therefore, we must be contented with but an impure
mixture for our daily be∣verage. And yet, perhaps, this very mixture may often
be more serviceable to our health than that of a purer kind. We know that it
is so with regard to vegetables: and why not, also, in general, to man? Be
this as it will, if we are desirous of having water in its greatest purity,
we are ordered, by the curious in this particular, to distill it from snow,
gathered upon the tops of the highest mountains, and to take none but the
outer and superficial part thereof. This we must be satisfied to call
pure water; but even this is far short of the pure unmixed philoso∣phical
element; which, in reality, is no where to be found.</P>
<P>As water is thus mixed with foreign matter, and often the
repository of minute animals, or vegetable seeds, we need not be
surprized that, when carried to sea, it is always found to pu∣trefy. 
<PB N="173" REF="196"/> But we must not suppose that it is the element
itself, which thus grows putrid, and offensive, but the substances with
which it is impregnated. It is true, the utmost precau∣tions are taken to
destroy all vegetable and animal substances that may have previously
been lodged in it, by boiling: but, notwithstand∣ing this, there are some
that will still survive the operation; and others, that find their way
during the time of its stowage. Seamen, there∣fore, assure us, that their
water is generally found to putrefy twice, at least, and sometimes three
times, in a long voyage. In about a month after it has been at sea, when the
bung is taken out of the cask, it sends up a noisome and dangerous
vapour, which would take fire upon the application of a candle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. v. part ii. p. 71.</BIBL></NOTE>.
The whole body of the water then is found replete with little worm-like
insects, that float, with great briskness, through all its parts. These
gene∣rally live for about a couple of days; and then dying, by depositing
their spoils, for a while encrease the putrefaction. After a time, the
heavier parts of these sinking to the bottom, the lighter float, in a
scum, at the top; and this is what the mariners call, the water's purg∣ing
itself. There are still, however, another <PB N="174" REF="197"/> race of
insects, which are bred, very probably, from the spoils of the former; and
produce, after some time, similar appearances: these dying, the water is
then thought to change no more. However, it very often happens, espe∣cially
in hot climates, that nothing can drive these nauseous insects from the
ship's store of water. They often encrease to a very disagree∣able and
frightful size, so as to deter the ma∣riner, though parching with thirst,
from tasting that cup which they have contaminated.</P>
<P>This water, as thus described, therefore, is a very different
fluid from that simple elementary substance upon which philosophical
theories have been founded; and concerning the nature of which there have been
so many disputes. Elementary water is no way compounded; but is without
taste, smell, or colour; and incapable of being discerned by any of the
senses, except the touch. This is the famous dissolvent of the
chymists, into which, as they have boasted, they can reduce all bodies; and
which makes up all other substances, only by putting on a different
disguise. In some forms, it is fluid, transparent, and evasive of the
touch; in others, hard, firm, and elastic. In some, it is stiffened by
cold; in others, dissolved by fire. Accord-to them, it only assumes
external shapes from <PB N="175" REF="198"/> accidental causes; but the
mountain is as much a body of water as the cake of ice that melts on its brow;
and even the philosopher himself, is composed of the same materials
with the cloud or meteor which he contemplates.</P>
<P>Speculation seldom rests when it begins. Others, disallowing
the universality of this sub∣stance, will not allow that in a state of
nature there is any such thing as water at all. What assumes the
appearance, say they, is nothing more than melted ice. Ice is the real
element of Nature's making; and when found in a state of fluidity, it is then
in a state of violence. All substances are naturally hard; but some
more readily melt with heat than others. It requires a great heat to melt iron;
a smaller heat will melt copper: silver, gold, tin, and lead, melt with
smaller still: ice, which is a body like the rest, melts with a very
moderate warmth; and quicksilver, melts with the smallest warmth of all.
Water, therefore, is but ice kept in con∣tinual fusion; and still returning
to its former state, when the heat is taken away. Between these opposite
opinions, the controversy has been carried on with great ardour; and much has
been written on both sides: and yet, when we come to examine the debate, it
will probably terminate in this question, whether cold or heat 
<PB N="176" REF="199"/> first began their operations upon water? This is a
fact of very little importance, if known; and what is more, it is a fact we can
never know.</P>
<P>Indeed, if we examine into the operations of cold and heat upon
water, we shall find that they produce somewhat similar effects. Water
dilates in its bulk, by heat, to a very consider∣able degree; and, what is
more extraordinary, it is likewise dilated by cold, in the same
man∣ner.</P>
<P>If water be placed over a fire, it grows gra∣dually larger in bulk,
as it becomes hot, until it begins to boil; after which, no art can either
encrease its bulk, or its heat. By encreasing the fire, indeed, it may be
more quickly evaporated away; but its heat, and its bulk, still continue the
same. By the expanding of this fluid by heat, philosophers have found a way
to deter∣mine the warmth, or the coldness of other bo∣dies: for if put into a
glass tube, by its swelling and rising therein, it shews the quantity
of heat in the body to which it is applied; by its con∣tracting, and sinking,
it shews the absence of the same. Instead of using water in this
in∣strument, which is called a thermometer, they now make use of spirit
of wine, which is not apt to freeze, and which is endued even with a 
<PB N="177" REF="200"/> greater expansion, by heat, than water. The
instrument consists of nothing more than a hol∣low ball of glass, with
a long tube growing out of it. This being partly filled with spirits of wine,
tinctured red, so as to be seen when it rises, the ball is plunged into
boiling water, which making the spirit within expand and rise in the tube,
the water marks the greatest height to which it ascends; at this point the
tube is to be broken off, and then hermetically sealed, by melt∣ing the
glass with a blow-pipe: a scale being placed by the side, completes the
thermometer. Now as the fluid expands or condenses with heat or cold, it will
rise and fall in the tube in proportion; and the degree or quantity of
ascent or descent will be seen in the scale.</P>
<P>No fire, as was said, can make water hotter, after it begins to
boil. We can, therefore, at any time be sure of an equable certain heat;
which is that of boiling water, which is invariably the same. The certainty
of such an heat is not less useful than the instrument that measures
it. It affords a standard, fixed, degree of heat over the whole world;
boiling water being as hot in Greenland, as upon the coasts of Guinea. One
fire is more intense than another; of heat there are various degrees; but
boiling water is an heat every where the same, and easily procurable.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="201"/>As heat thus expands water, so cold, when it
is violent enough to freeze the same, produces exactly the same effect, and
expands it likewise. Thus water is acted upon in the same manner by two
opposite qualities; being dilated by both. As a proof that it is dilated by
cold, we have only to observe the ice which floats on the surface of a
pond, which it would not do were it not dilated, and grown more bulky, by
freez∣ing, than the water, which remains unfroze. Mr. Boyle, however, put the
matter past a doubt, by a variety of experiments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. i. p. 610.</BIBL></NOTE>. Having poured a proper
quantity of water into a strong earthen vessel, he exposed it,
uncovered, to the open air, in frosty nights; and observed, that
continually the ice reached higher than the water, before it was frozen. He
filled also a tube with water, and stopped both ends with wax: the water,
when froze, was found to push out the stopples from both ends; and a rod of
ice appeared at each end of the tube, which shewed how much it was swollen
by the cold within.</P>
<P>From hence, therefore, we may be very cer∣tain of the cold's
dilating of the water; and ex∣perience also shews that, the force of this
ex∣pansion has been found as great as any which <PB N="179" REF="202"/> heat
has been found to produce. The touch∣hole of a strong gun-barrel being
stopped, and a plug of iron forcibly driven into the muzzle, after the barrel
had been filled with water, it was placed in a mixture of ice and salt; the
plug, though soldered to the barrel, at first gave way, but being fixed in
more firmly, within a quarter of an hour the gun-barrel burst with a loud
noise, and blew up the cover of the box wherein it lay. Such is its force in
an or∣dinary experiment. But it has been known to burst cannons, filled with
water, and then left to freeze; for the cold congealing the water, and the ice
swelling, it became irresistible. The bursting of rocks, by frost,
which is frequent enough in the Northern climates, and is some∣times seen
in our own, is an equal proof of the expansion of congealed water. For
having, by some means insinuated itself into the body of the rock, it has
remained there till the cold was sufficient to affect it by congelation. But
when once frozen, no obstacle is able to confine it from dilating; and, if it
cannot otherwise find room, the rock must burst asunder.</P>
<P>This alteration in the bulk of water, might have served as a proof
that it was capable of being compressed into a narrower space than it
occupied before; but, till of late, water was <PB N="180" REF="203"/> held to be
incompressible. The general opinion was, that no art whatsoever could
squeeze it into a narrower compass; that no power on earth, for instance,
could crush a pint of water into a vessel that held an hair's breadth
less than a pint. And this, said they, appears from the fa∣mous Florentine
experiment; where the water, rather than suffer compressure, was seen
to ooze out through the pores of the solid metal; and, at length, making a
cleft in the side, spun out with great vehemence. But later trials have
proved that water is very compressible, and partakes of that elasticity
which every other body possesses in some degree. Indeed, had not
mankind been dazzled by the brilliancy of one inconclusive experiment, there
were nu∣merous reasons to convince them of its having the same properties
with other substances. Ice, which is water in another state, is very
elastic. A stone flung slantingly along the surface of a pond, bounds
from the water several times; which shews it to be elastic also. But
the trials of Mr. Canton have put this past all doubt; which being somewhat
similar to those of the great Boyle, who pressed it with weights
properly applied, carry sufficient conviction.</P>
<P>What has been hitherto related, is chiefly applicable to the element
of water alone; but its sluidity is a property that it possesses in
com∣mon <PB N="181" REF="204"/> with several other substances, in other
re∣spects greatly differing from it. That quality which gives rise to the
definition of a fluid, namely, that its parts are in a continual in∣testine
motion, seems extremely applicable to water. What the shapes of those
parts are, it would be vain to attempt to discover. Every trial only shews
the futility of the attempt; all we find is, that they are extremely minute;
and that they roll over each other with the greatest ease. Some, indeed,
from this property alone, have not hesitated to pronounce them globular; and
we have, in all our hydrostatical books, pictures of these little globes in
a state of sliding and rolling over each other. But all this is merely the
work of imagination; we know that substances of any kind, reduced very
small, assume a fluid appearance, somewhat resembling that of water.
Mr. Boyle, after finely powder∣ing and sifting a little dry powder of
plaister of Paris, put it in a vessel over the fire, where it soon
began to boil like water, exhibiting all the motions and appearances of a
boiling liquor. Although but a powder, the parts of which we know are very
different from each other, and just as accident has formed them, yet it
heaved in great waves, like water. Upon <PB N="182" REF="205"/> agitation, an
heavy body will sink to the bot∣tom, and a light one emerge to the top. There
is no reason, therefore, to suppose the figure of the parts of water
round, since we see their flu∣idity very well imitated by a composition,
the parts of which are of various forms and sizes. The shape of the parts
of water, therefore, we must be content to continue ignorant of. All we know
is, that earth, air, and fire, all conduce to separate the parts from each
other.</P>
<P>Earthy substances divide the parts from each other, and keep
them asunder. This division may be so great, that the water will entirely
lose its fluidity thereby. Mud, potter's clay, and dried bricks, are but so
many different combi∣nations of earth and water; each substance in which
the parts of water are most separated from each other, appearing to be the
most dry. In some substances, indeed, where the parts of water are
greatly divided, as in porcelane, for instance, it is no easy matter to
recover and bring them together again; but they continue in a manner fixed and
united to the manu∣factured clay. This circumstance it was, which led Doctor
Cheney into a very peculiar strain of thinking. He suspected that the
quantity of water, on the surface of the earth, was daily decreasing. For,
says he, some parts of it are <PB N="183" REF="206"/> continually joined to
vegetable, animal, and mi∣neral substances, which no art can again recover.
United with these, the water loses its fluidity; for if, continues he, we
separate a few particles of any fluid, and fasten them to a solid body,
or keep them asunder, one from another, they will be fluid no longer. To
produce fluidity, a con∣siderable number of such particles are required;
but here they are close, and destitute of their natural properties. Thus,
according to him, the world is growing every day harder and harder, and the
earth firmer and firmer; and there may come a time when every object around us
may be stiffened in universal frigidity! How∣ever, we have causes enough
of anxiety in this world already, not to add this preposterous con∣cern to
the number.</P>
<P>That air also contributes to divide the parts of water, we can
have no manner of doubt of; some have even disputed whether water be not
capable of being turned into air. However, though this must not be allowed,
it must be granted, that it may be turned into a substance which greatly
resembles air (as we have seen in the experiment of the oeolpile) with all
its pro∣perties; except that, by cold, this new made air may be condensed
again into water.</P>
<P>But of all the substances which tend to divide 
<PB N="184" REF="207"/> the parts of water, fire is the most powerful. Water,
when heated into steam, acquires such force, and the parts of it tend to
fly off from each other with such violence, that no earthly substance we
know of, is strong enough to con∣fine them. A single drop of water,
converted into steam, has been found capable of raising a weight of twenty
tons; and would have raised twenty thousand, were the vessel confining
it sufficiently strong, and the fire below en∣creased in proportion.</P>
<P>From this easy yielding of its parts to external pressure,
arises the art of determining the bulk of bodies by plunging them in water;
with all the other useful discoveries in that part of na∣tural
philosophy, called hydrostatics. The laws of this science, which
Archimedes first began, and Pascal, with some other of the moderns,
brought to perfection, rather belongs to ex∣perimental than to natural
history. However, I will take leave to mention some of the most
striking paradoxes in this branch of science, which are as well confirmed
by experiment, as rendered universal by theory. It would, indeed, be
unpardonable, while discoursing on the pro∣perties of water, to omit giving
some account of the manner in which it sustains such immense bulks as
we see floating upon its soft and yield∣ing surface: how some bodies,
that are known <PB N="185" REF="208"/> to sink at one time, swim with
ease, if their sur∣face be enlarged: how the heaviest body, even gold
itself, may be made to swim upon water; and how the lightest, such as
cork, shall remain sunk at the bottom: how the pouring in of a single
quart of water, will burst an hogshead hooped with iron: and how it
ascends, in pipes, from the valley, to travel over the mountain: these are
circumstances that are at first surpriz∣ing; but, upon a slight
consideration, lose their wonder.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the above sketch, the manner of
demonstrating used by Monsieur D'Alambert is made use of, as the most
obvious, and the most satisfactory. 
<BIBL>Vide Essai sur, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>In order to
conceive the manner in which all these wonders are effected, we must begin
by observing that water is possessed of an invariable property, which
has not hitherto been mention∣ed; that of always keeping its surface level
and even. Winds, indeed, may raise it into waves; or art spurt it up in
fountains; but ever, when left to itself, it sinks into a smooth even
surface, of which no one part is higher than another. If I should pour
water, for instance, into the arm of a pipe of the shape of the letter U,
the fluid would rise in the other arm just to the same height; because,
otherwise, it would not find its level, which it invariably maintains. A pipe
<PB N="186" REF="209"/> bending from one hill down into the valley, and rising
by another, may be considered as a tube of this kind, in which the water,
sinking in one arm, rises to maintain its level in the other. And upon this
principle all water-pipes depend; which can never raise the water higher than
the fountain from which they proceed.</P>
<P>Again, let us suppose for a moment, that the arms of the pipe
already mentioned, may be made long or short at pleasure; and let us
still further suppose, that there is some obstacle at the bottom of
it, which prevents the water poured into one arm, from rising in the other.
Now it is evident, that this obstacle at the bot∣tom will sustain a
pressure from the water in one arm, equal to what would make it rise in
the other; and this pressure will be great, in pro∣portion as the arm
filled with water is tall. We may, therefore, generally conclude, that the
bottom of every vessel is pressed by a force, in proportion to the
height of the water in that vessel. For instance, if the vessel
filled with water be forty feet high, the bottom of that vessel will
sustain such a pressure as would raise the same water forty feet
high, which is very great. From hence we see how extremely apt to burst our
pipes that convey water to the city are; for descending from an hill of more
than <PB N="187" REF="210"/> forty feet high, they are pressed by the water
contained in them, with a force equal to what would raise it more than forty
feet high; and that this is sometimes able to burst a wooden pipe, we can
have no room to doubt of.</P>
<P>Still recurring to our pipe, let us suppose one of its arms ten
times as thick as the other; this will produce no effect whatsoever upon the
ob∣stacle below, which we supposed hindering its rise in the other arm;
because, how thick soever the pipe may be, its contents would only rise
to its own level; and it will, therefore, press the obstacle with a force
equal thereto. We may, therefore, universally conclude, that the bottom of
any vessel is pressed by its water, not as it is broad or narrow, but
in proportion as it is high. Thus the water contained in a vessel not
thicker than my finger, presses its bottom as forcibly as the water
contained in an hogshead of an equal height; and, if we made holes in the
bottoms of both, the water would burst out as forceful from the one as the
other. Hence we may, with great ease, burst an hogshead with a single
quart of water; and it has been often done. We have only<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Nollet's Lectures.</BIBL></NOTE>, for this, to place an
hogshead on one end, filled with water: we then bore an hole in its top, into
which we plant a narrow <PB N="188" REF="211"/> tin pipe, of about thirty feet
high: by pouring a quart of water into this, at the top, as it con∣tinues to
rise higher in the pipe, it will press more forcibly on the bottom and
sides of the hogshead below, and at last burst it.</P>
<P>Still returning to our simple instrument of demonstration. If
we suppose the obstacle at the bottom of the pipe to be moveable, so as
that the force of the water can push it up into the other arm; such a body
is quicksilver, for instance. Now, it is evident, that the weight of water
weighing down upon this quicksilver in one arm, will at last press it up
in the other arm; and will continue to press it upwards, until the fluid in
both arms be upon a par. So that here we actually see quicksilver, the
heaviest substance in the world, except gold, floating upon water, which
is but a very light sub∣stance.</P>
<P>When we see water thus capable of sustaining quicksilver, we
need not be surprized that it is capable of floating much lighter
substances, ships, animals, or timber. When any thing floats upon water,
we always see that a part of it sinks in the same. A cork, a ship, a
buoy, each buries itself a bed on the surface of the water; this bed may be
considered as so much water displaced; the water will, therefore, lose 
<PB N="189" REF="212"/> so much of its own weight as is equal to the weight of
that bed of water which it displaces. If the body be heavier than a similar
bulk of water, it will sink; if lighter, it will swim. Universally,
therefore, every body that is plunged in water, loses as much of its weight
as is equal to the weight of a body of water of its own bulk. Some light
bodies, therefore, such as cork, lose all their weight, and therefore
swim, because their bulk of water is heavier than they; other more
ponderous bodies sink, because they are heavier than their bulk of
water.</P>
<P>Upon this simple theorem entirely depends the art of weighing
metals hydrostatically. I have a guinea, for instance, and desire to know
whether it be pure gold: I have weighed it in the usual way with another
guinea, and find it exactly of the same weight, but still I have some
suspicion, from its greater bulk, that it is not pure. In order to
determine this, I have nothing more to do than to weigh it in water with that
same guinea that I know to be good, and of the same weight; and this will
instantly shew the difference; for the true ponderous metal will sink,
and the false bulky one will be sustained in proportion to the
greatness of its surface. Those whose business it is to examine the
purity of metals, have a balance made for this purpose, <PB N="190" REF="213"/> by which they can precisely determine which is most ponderous,
or, as it is expressed, which has the greatest specific gravity.
Seventy-one pound and an half of quicksilver is found to be equal in bulk to
an hundred pound weight of gold. In the same proportion, sixty of lead,
fifty-four of silver, forty-seven of copper, forty-five of brass,
forty-two of iron, and thirty-nine of tin, are each equal to an hundred pound
of the same most ponderous of all metals.</P>
<P>This method of precisely determining the purity of gold, by
weighing in water, was first discovered by Archimedes, to whom mankind have
been indebted for many of the most useful discoveries. Hiero, king of
Sicily, having sent a certain quantity of gold to be made into a crown, the
workman, it seems, kept a part for his own use, and supplied the
deficiency with a baser metal. His fraud was suspected by the king, but
could not be proved; till applying to Archimedes, he weighed the crown in
water; and, by this method, directly informed the king of the quantity of gold
which was taken away.</P>
<P>It has been said, that all fluids endeavour to preserve their
level; and, likewise, that a body pressing on the surface, tended to
destroy that level. From hence, therefore, it will easily be 
<PB N="191" REF="214"/> inferred, that the deeper any body sinks, the greater
will be the resistance of the depressed fluid beneath. It will be
asked, therefore, as the resistance encreases in proportion as the body
descends, how comes the body, after it is got a certain way, to sink at
all? The answer is ob∣vious. From the fluid above it pressing it down
with almost as great a force as the fluid beneath presses it up. Take
away, by any art, the pressure of the fluid from above, and let only the
resistance of the fluid from below be suffered to act, and after the body
is got down very deep, the resistance will be insuperable. To give an
instance: a small hole opens in the bottom of a ship at sea, forty feet
we will suppose below the surface of the water; through this the water
bursts up with great violence; I attempt to stop it with my hand, but it
pushes the hand violently away. Here the hand is, in fact, a body attempt∣ing
to sink upon water, at a depth of forty feet, with the pressure from
above taken away. The water, therefore, will overcome my strength; and will
continue to burst in till it has got to its level: if I should then dive
into the hold, and clap my hand upon the opening, as before, I should
perceive no force acting against my hand at all, for the water above
presses the hand as much down against the hole, as the water without 
<PB N="192" REF="215"/> presses it upward. For this reason, also, when
we dive to the bottom of the water, we sustain a very great pressure
from above, it is true, but it is counteracted by the pressure from below;
and the whole acting uniformly on the surface of the body, wraps us close
round without in∣jury.</P>
<P>As I have deviated thus far, I will just men∣tion one or two
properties more, which water, and all such like fluids, is found to
possess. And first, their ascending in vessels which are emptied
of air, as in our common pumps for instance. The air, however, being the
agent in this case, we must previously examine the pro∣perties of that,
before we undertake the expla∣nation. The other property to be mentioned is,
that of their ascending in small capillary tubes. This is one of the most
extraordinary and in∣scrutable appearances in nature. Glass tubes may be
drawn, by means of a lamp, as fine as an hair; still preserving their
hollow within. If one of these be planted in a vessel of water, or
spirit of wine, the liquor will immediately be seen to ascend; and it
will rise higher, in pro∣portion as the tube is smaller; a foot, two feet,
and more. How does this come to pass? Is the air the cause? No: the liquor
rises, although the air be taken away. Is attraction the cause? 
<PB N="193" REF="216"/> No: for quicksilver does not ascend, which it
otherwise would. Many have been the theories of experimental philosophers
to explain this property. Such as are fond of travelling in the regions of
conjecture, may consult Hawksbee, Morgan, Jurin, or Watson, who have
examined the subject with great minuteness. Hitherto, however, nothing but
doubts instead of know∣lege have been the result of their enquiries. It
will not, therefore, become us to enter into the minuteness of the enquiry,
when we have so many greater wonders to call our attention away.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Of the Origin of Rivers.</HEAD>
<P>THE sun ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and pants for the
place from whence he arose. All things are filled with labour, and man
can∣not utter it. All rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full.
Unto the place whence the rivers come, thither they return again. The eye is
not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ecclesiastes, chap. i. v. 5, 7, 8.</BIBL></NOTE>. Thus
speaks the wisest of the Jews. <PB N="194" REF="217"/> And, at so early
a period was the curiosity of man employed in observing these great
circu∣lations of nature. Every eye attempted to ex∣plain those appearances;
and every philosopher who has long thought upon the subject, seems to
give a peculiar solution. The enquiry whence rivers are produced; whence they
derive those unceasing stores of water, which continually en∣rich the
world with fertility and verdure; has been variously considered; and
divided the opi∣nions of mankind, more than any other topic in natural
history.</P>
<P>In this contest, the various champions may be classed under
two leaders, Mr. De La Hire, who contends that rivers must be supplied from
the sea, strained through the pores of the earth; and Doctor Halley, who
has endeavoured to demonstrate, that the clouds alone are sufficient for
the supply. Both sides have brought in ma∣thematics to their aid; and have
shewn, that long and laborious calculations can at any time be made, to
obscure both sides of a question.</P>
<P>De La Hire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hist. de l'Accad. 1713,
p. 56.</BIBL></NOTE> begins his proofs, that rain∣water, evaporated from the
sea, is insufficient for the production of rivers; by shewing, that rain
never penetrates the surface of the earth above sixteen inches. From thence
he infers, <PB N="195" REF="218"/> that it is impossible for it, in many
cases, to sink so as to be found at such considerable depths below.
Rain-water, he grants, is often seen to mix with rivers, and to swell their
currents; but a much greater part of it evaporates away. In fact, continues he,
if we suppose the earth every where covered with water, evaporation alone
would be sufficient to carry off two feet nine inches of it in a year: and
yet, we very well know, that scarce nineteen inches of rain∣water falls in
that time; so that evaporation would carry off a much greater quantity than
is ever known to descend. The small quantity of rain-water that falls is
therefore but barely sufficient for the purposes of vegetation. Two leaves
of a fig-tree have been found, by expe∣riment, to imbibe from the earth, in
five hours and an half, two ounces of water. This im∣plies the great quantity
of fluid that must be exhausted in the maintainance of one single plant.
Add to this, that the waters of the river Rungis will, by calculation, rise
to fifty inches; and the whole country from whence they are supplied, never
receives fifty inches, in the year, by rain. Besides this, there are many
salt springs, which are known to proceed imme∣diately from the sea, and
are subject to its flux and reflux. In short, wherever we dig beneath 
<PB N="196" REF="219"/> the surface of the earth, except in a very few
instances, water is to be found; and it is by this subterraneous water,
that springs and rivers, nay, a great part of vegetation itself, is
sup∣ported. It is this subterraneous water, which is raised into steam,
by the internal heat of the earth, that feeds plants. It is this
subterraneous water that distills through its interstices; and there
cooling, forms fountains. It is this that, by the addition of rains, is
encreased into rivers; and pours plenty over the whole earth.</P>
<P>On the other side of the question<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p. 128.</BIBL></NOTE>, it is
as∣serted, that the vapours which are exhaled from the sea, and driven by
the winds upon land, are more than sufficient to supply not only plants
with moisture, but also to furnish a sufficiency of water to the
greatest rivers. For this pur∣pose, an estimate has been made of the
quantity of water emptied at the mouths of the greatest rivers; and of the
quantity also raised from the sea by evaporation; and it has been found,
that the latter by far exceeds the former. This calculation was made by Mr.
Mariotte. By him it was found, upon receiving such rain as fell in a year, in
a proper vessel, fitted for that purpose, that, one year with another,
there might fall about twenty inches of water upon <PB N="197" REF="220"/> the
surface of the earth, throughout Europe. It was also computed, that the
river Seine, from its source to the city of Paris, might cover an extent of
ground, that would supply it annually with above seven billions of cubic
feet of this water, formed by evaporation. But, upon com∣puting the quantity
which passed through the arches of one of its bridges in a year, it was
found to amount only to two hundred and eighty millions of cubic feet, which is
not above the sixth part of the former number. Hence, therefore, it appears,
that this river may receive a supply brought to it by the evaporated waters
of the sea, six times greater than what it gives back to the sea by its
current; and, therefore, evaporation is more than sufficient for main∣taining
the greatest rivers; and supplying the purposes also of vegetation.</P>
<P>In this manner the sea supplies sufficient hu∣midity to the
air for furnishing the earth with all necessary moisture. One part of
its vapours fall upon its own bosom, before they arrive upon land. Another
part is arrested by the sides of mountains, and is compelled, by the
rising stream of air, to mount upward towards the summits. Here it is
presently precipitated, dripping down by the crannies of the stone. In
some places, entering into the caverns of the <PB N="198" REF="221"/>
mountain, it gathers in those receptacles, which being once filled, all the
rest overflows; and breaking out by the sides of the hills, forms single
springs. Many of these run down by the vallies, or guts between the ridges
of the mountain, and coming to unite, form little ri∣vulets or brooks; many of
these meeting in one common valley, and gaining the plain ground, being grown
less rapid, become a river: and many of these uniting, make such vast
bodies of water as the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Da∣nube.</P>
<P>There is still a third part, which falls upon the lower grounds,
and furnishes plants with their wonted supply. But the circulation does not
rest even here; for it is again exhaled into vapour by the action of the
sun; and again re∣turned to that great mass of waters whence it first
arose. This, adds Doctor Halley, seems the most reasonable
hypothesis; and much more likely to be true, than that of those who derive
all springs from the filtering of the sea waters through certain imaginary
tubes or passages within the earth; since it is well known, that the
greatest rivers have their most copious foun∣tains the most remote from
the sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p.
128.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>This seems the most adopted opinion; and yet, after all, it is
still pressed with great diffi∣culties; <PB N="199" REF="222"/> and there
is still room to look out for a better theory. The perpetuity of many
springs, which always yield the same quantity when the least rain or
vapour is afforded, as well as when the greatest, is a strong objection.
Derham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Derham Physico Theol.</BIBL></NOTE>
mentions a spring at Upminster, which he could never perceive by his eye to
be diminished, in the greatest droughts, even when all the ponds in the
country, as well as an ad∣joining brook, have been dry for several months
together. In the rainy seasons also, it was never overflowed; except
sometimes, perhaps, for an hour or so, upon the immission of the
external rains. He, therefore, justly enough concludes, that had this
spring its origin from rain or vapour, there would be found an encrease or
decrease of its water, corresponding to the causes of its production.</P>
<P>Thus the reader, after having been tossed from one hypothesis
to another, must at last be contented to settle in conscious ignorance.
All that has been written upon this subject, affords him rather something
to say, than something to think; something rather for others than for
him∣self. Varenius, indeed, although he is at a loss for the origin of
rivers, is by no means so as to their formation. He is pretty positive that
all <PB N="200" REF="223"/> rivers are artificial. He boldly asserts, that
their channels have been originally formed by the industry of man. His
reasons are, that when a new spring breaks forth, the water does not make
itself a new channel, but spreads over the adjacent land. Thus, says he,
men are ob∣liged to direct its course; or, otherwise, Nature would never
have found one. He enumerates many rivers, that are certainly known, from
history, to have been dug by men. He alledges, that no salt-water rivers
are found, because men did not want salt-water; and as for salt, that was
procurable at a less expence than digging a river for it. However, it costs
a speculative man but a small expence of thinking to form such an
hypothesis. It may, perhaps, engross the reader's patience to detain him
longer upon it.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, though philosophy be thus ig∣norant, as to the
production of rivers, yet the laws of their motion, and the nature of their
currents, have been very well explained. The Italians have particularly
distinguished them∣selves in this respect; and it is chiefly to them
that we are indebted for the improvement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>S.
Guglielmini della Natura de Fiumi. Passim.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>All rivers have their source either in moun∣tains, or elevated
lakes; and it is in their descent <PB N="201" REF="224"/> from these, that
they acquire that velocity which maintains their future current. At first
their course is generally rapid and headlong; but it is retarded in its
journey, both by the con∣tinual friction against its banks, by the many
obstacles it meets to divert its stream, and by the plains generally
becoming more level as it approaches towards the sea.</P>
<P>If this acquired velocity be quite spent, and the plain through
which the river passes is en∣tirely level, it will, notwithstanding,
still con∣tinue to run from the perpendicular pressure of the water,
which is always in exact proportion to the depth. This perpendicular
pressure is nothing more than the weight of the upper waters pressing
the lower out of their places, and, consequently, driving them forward, as
they cannot recede against the stream. As this pressure is greatest
in the deepest parts of the river, so we generally find the middle of the
stream most rapid; both because it has the greatest motion thus
communicated by the pressure, and the fewest obstructions from the
banks on either side.</P>
<P>Rivers thus set into motion are almost always found to make
their own beds. Where they find the bed elevated, they wear its substance
away, and deposit the sediment in the next hol∣low, <PB N="202" REF="225"/>
so as in time to make the bottom of their channels even. On the other hand,
the water is continually gnawing and eating away the banks on each side; and
this with more force as the current happens to strike more directly against
them. By these means, it always has a tendency to render them more strait
and pa∣rallel to its own course. Thus it continues to rectify its banks, and
enlarge its bed; and, con∣sequently, to diminish the force of its stream,
till there becomes an equilibrium between the force of the water, and the
resistance of its banks, upon which both will remain without any further
mutation. And it is happy for man that bounds are thus put to the erosion of
the earth by water; and that we find all rivers only dig and widen themselves
but to a certain degree<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Guglielmini della Natura
de Fiumi. Passim.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In those plains 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon. De Fleuves. Passim,
vol. ii.</BIBL></NOTE> and large vallies where great rivers flow, the bed of
the river is usually lower than any part of the valley. But it often
hap∣pens, that the surface of the water is higher than many of the grounds
that are adjacent to the banks of the stream. If, after inundations, we take
a view of some rivers, we shall find their banks appear above water, at a
time that all <PB N="203" REF="226"/> the adjacent valley is overflown. This
proceeds from the frequent deposition of mud, and such like substances,
upon the banks, by the rivers frequently overflowing; and thus, by degrees,
they become elevated above the plain; and the water is often seen higher
also.</P>
<P>Rivers, as every body has seen, are always broadest at the
mouth; and grow narrower towards their source. But what is less known, and
probably more deserving curiosity, is, that they run in a more direct
channel as they im∣mediately leave their sources; and that their
sinuosities and turnings become more nu∣merous as they proceed. It is a
certain sign among the savages of North America, that they are near the
sea when they find the rivers winding, and every now and then changing their
direction. And this is even now become an indication to the Europeans
themselves, in their journies through those trackless forests. As
those sinuosities, therefore, encrease as the river approaches the
sea, it is not to be wondered at, that they sometimes divide, and thus
disem∣bogue by different channels. The Danube disembogues into the Euxine
by seven mouths; the Nile, by the same number; and the Wolga, by
seventy.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="227"/>The currents 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon. De Fleuves. Passim. vol.
ii.</BIBL></NOTE> of rivers are to be estimated very differently from the
manner in which those writers who have given us mathematical the∣ories on
this subject, represent them. They found their calculations upon the
surface, being a perfect plain, from one bank to the other: but this is not
the actual state of Nature; for rivers, in general, rise in the middle; and
this convexity is greatest in proportion as the rapidity of the stream is
greater. Any person, to be convinced of this, need only lay his eye as nearly
as he can on a level with the stream, and look∣ing across to the opposite
bank, he will perceive the river in the midst to be elevated considerably
above what it is at the edges. This rising, in some rivers, is often found
to be three feet high; and is ever encreased, in proportion to the ra∣pidity
of the stream. In this case, the water in the midst of the current
loses a part of its weight, from the velocity of its motion; while that at
the sides, for the contrary reason, sinks lower. It sometimes, however,
happens, that this appearance is reversed; for when tides are found to flow
up with violence against the na∣tural current of the water, the greatest
rapidity is then found at the sides of the river, as the 
<PB N="205" REF="228"/> water there least resists the influx from the
sea. On those occasions, therefore, the river presents a concave rather
than a convex surface: and, as in the former case, the middle waters rose
in a ridge; in this case, they sink in a furrow.</P>
<P>The stream in all rivers is more rapid in pro∣portion as its
channel is diminished. For in∣stance, it will be much swifter where it is
ten yards broad, than where it is twenty; for the force behind still
pushing the water forward, when it comes to the narrow part, it must make
up by velocity what it wants in room.</P>
<P>It often happens that the stream of a river is opposed by one of
its jutting banks, by an island in the midst, the arches of a bridge, or
some such obstacle. This produces, not unfrequent∣ly, a back current; and
the water having past the arch with great velocity, pushes the water on
each side of its direct current. This pro∣duces a side current, tending to
the bank; and not unfrequently a whirlpool; in which a large body of waters are
circulated in a kind of cavity, sinking down in the middle. The central point
of the whirlpool is always lowest, because it has the least motion: the
other parts are supported, in some measure, by the violence of theirs;
and, consequently, rise higher as their motion is greater; so that
towards the extremity of the <PB N="206" REF="229"/> whirlpool must be higher
than towards the center.</P>
<P>If the stream of a river be stopped at the sur∣face, and yet
be free below; as for instance, if it be laid over by a bridge of boats,
there will then be a double current; the water at the surface will flow back,
while that at the bottom will pro∣ceed with encreased velocity. It often
happens that the current at the bottom is swifter than at the top, when, upon
violent land-floods, the weight of waters towards the source, presses the
waters at the bottom, before it has had time to communicate its motion to the
surface. How∣ever, in all other cases, the surface of the stream is
swifter than the bottom, as it is not retarded by rubbing over the bed of the
river.</P>
<P>It might be supposed that bridges, dams, and other obstacles
in the current of a river, would retard its total velocity. But the difference
they make is very inconsiderable. The water, by these stoppages, gets an
elevation above the ob∣ject; which, when it has surmounted, it gives a
velocity that recompences the former delay. Islands and turnings also
retard the course of the stream but very inconsiderably; any cause
which diminishes the quantity of the water, most sensibly diminishes
the force and the velocity of the stream.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="230"/>An encrease 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 62.</BIBL></NOTE>
of water in the bed of the river, always encreases its rapidity; except in
cases of inundation. The instant the river has overflowed its banks, the
velocity of its current is always turned that way, and the inundation is
perceived to continue for some days; which it would not otherwise do, if,
as soon as the cause was discontinued, it acquired its former
rapidity.</P>
<P>A violent storm, that sets directly up against the course of
the stream, will always retard, and sometimes entirely stop its course.
I have seen an instance of this, when the bed of a large river was left
entirely dry for some hours, and fish were caught among the stones at the
bottom.</P>
<P>Inundations are generally greater towards the source of rivers,
than farther down; because the current is generally swifter below than
above; and that for the reasons already assigned.</P>
<P>A little river 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Guglielmini,
ibid.</BIBL></NOTE> may be received into a large one, without augmenting either
its width or depth. This, which at first view seems a pa∣radox, is yet very
easily accounted for. The little river, in this case, only goes towards
en∣creasing the swiftness of the larger, and putting its dormant waters
into motion. In this man∣ner, <PB N="208" REF="231"/> the Venetian branch of the
Po was pushed on by the Ferarese branch and that of Panaro, without any
enlargement of its breadth or depth from these accessions.</P>
<P>A river tending to enter another, either per∣pendicularly, or in an
opposite direction, will be diverted, by degrees, from that direction; and be
obliged to make itself a more favourable en∣trance downward, and more
conspiring with the stream of the former.</P>
<P>The union of two rivers into one, makes it flow the swifter;
since the same quantity of water, instead of rubbing against four
shores, now only rubs against two. And, besides, the current being
deeper, becomes of consequence more fitted for motion.</P>
<P>With respect to the places from whence rivers proceed, it may be
taken for a general rule, that the largest 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Doctor Halley.</BIBL></NOTE> and
highest mountains supply the greatest and most extensive rivers. It
may also be remarked, in whatever direction the ridge of the mountain runs,
the river takes an opposite course. If the mountain, for in∣stance,
stretches from north to south, the river runs from east to west; and
so contrariwise. These are some of the most generally received
opinions with regard to the course of rivers; <PB N="209" REF="232"/> however,
they are liable to many exceptions; and nothing but an actual knowledge of each
particular river can furnish us with an exact theory of its current.</P>
<P>The largest rivers of Europe are, first, the Wolga, which is
about six hundred and fifty leagues in length, extending from Reschow to
Astrachan. It is remarkable of this river, that it abounds with water during
the summer months of May and June: but all the rest of the year is so
shallow as scarce to cover its bottom, or allow a passage for loaded
vessels that trade up its stream. It was up this river that the English
attempted a trade into Persia, in which they were so unhappily
disappointed, in the year 1741. The next in order is the Danube. The course
of this is about four hundred and fifty leagues, from the mountains of
Switzer∣land to the Black Sea. It is so deep between Buda and Belgrade, that
the Turks and Chri∣stians have fleets of men of war upon it; which frequently
engaged, during the last war between the Ottomans and the Austrians:
however, it is unnavigable further down, by reason of its ca∣taracts, which
prevent its commerce into the Black Sea. The Don, or Tanais, which is four
hundred leagues from the source of that branch of it called the Sosna, to
its mouth in the Euxine <PB N="210" REF="233"/> sea. In one part of its
course, it approaches near the Wolga; and Peter the Great had actually begun
a canal, by which he intended joining those two rivers; which he did not live
to finish. The Nieper, or Boristhenes, which rises in the middle of
Muscovy, and runs a course of three hundred and fifty leagues, to empty
itself into the Black Sea. The Old Cossacks inhabit the banks and
islands of this river; and frequently cross the Black Sea, to plunder the
maritime places on the coasts of Turky. The Dwina; which takes its rise in
a province of the same name in Russia, then runs a course of three
hundred leagues, and disembogues into the White Sea, a little below
Archangel.</P>
<P>The largest rivers of Asia are, the Hoanho, in China, which is
eight hundred and fifty leagues in length, computing from its source at Raja
Ribron, to its mouth in the Gulph of Changi. The Jenisca of Tartary, about
eight hundred leagues in length, from the Lake Selinga, to the Icy Sea. This
river is, by some, supposed to supply most of that great quantity of
drift wood which is seen floating in the seas, near the Artic circle. The
Oby, of five hundred leagues, running from the lake of Kila into the Northern
sea. The Amour, in Eastern Tartary, whose course is about five hundred
and seventy-five leagues, from its source to its <PB N="211" REF="234"/>
entrance into the sea of Kamtskatka. The Kiam, in China, five hundred and
fifty leagues in length. The Ganges, one of the most noted rivers in the
world, and about as long as the former. It rises in the mountains which
separate India from Tartary; and running through the dominions of the Great
Mogul, discharges itself by several mouths into the bay of Bengal. It is
not only esteemed by the Indians for the depth, and pureness of its
stream, but for a supposed sanctity which they believe to be in its
waters. It is visited annually by several hundred thousand pilgrims, who
pay their de∣votions to the river as to a god; for savage sim∣plicity is
always known to mistake the blessings of the Deity, for the Deity
himself. They carry their dying friends from distant countries, to expire
on its banks; and to be buried in its stream. The water is lowest in April
or May; but the rains beginning to fall soon after, the flat country is
overflowed for several miles, till about the end of September; the waters
then begin to retire, leaving a prolific sediment behind, that enriches the
soil, and, in a few days time, gives a luxuriance to vegetation, beyond what
can be conceived by an European. Next to this may be reckoned the still more
celebrated river Eu∣phrates. This rises from two sources, north∣ward 
<PB N="212" REF="235"/> of the city Erzerum, in Turcomania; and unites about
three days journey below the same; from whence, after performing a course
of five hundred leagues, it falls into the Gulph of Persia, fifty miles below
the city of Bassora in Arabia. The river Indus is extended from its
source to its discharge into the Arabian sea, four hundred leagues.</P>
<P>The largest rivers of Africa are, the Senegal, which runs a
course of not less than eleven hundred leagues, comprehending the Niger,
which some have supposed to fall into it. How∣ever, later accounts seem
to affirm that the Niger is lost in the sands, about three hundred miles up
from the western coasts of Africa. Be this as it may, the Senegal is well
known to be na∣vigable for more than three hundred leagues up the country; and
how much higher it may reach is not yet discovered, as the dreadful fatality
of the inland parts of Africa, not only deter cu∣riosity, but even avarice,
which is a much stronger passion. At the end of last war, of fifty
English men that were sent to the factory at Galam, a place taken from the
French, and nine hundred miles up the river, only one re∣turned to tell the
fate of his companions, who were killed by the climate. The celebrated river
Nile is said to be nine hundred and seventy <PB N="213" REF="236"/> leagues,
from its source among the mountains of the Moon, in Upper Aethiopia, to its
opening into the Mediterranean sea. The sources of this river were
considered as inscrutable by the ancients; and the causes of its
periodical inun∣dation were equally unknown. They have both been ascertained
by the missionaries who have travelled into the interior parts of
Aethiopia. The Nile takes its rise in the kingdom of Gojam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher, Mund. Subt. vol. ii. p. 72.</BIBL></NOTE>, from a
small aperture on the top of a mountain, which, though not above a foot and
an half over, yet was unfathomable. This foun∣tain, when arrived at the foot of
the mountain, expands into a river; and, being joined by others, forms a lake
thirty leagues long, and as many broad; from this, its channel, in some
measure, winds back to the country where it first began; from thence,
precipitating by fright∣ful cataracts, it travels through a variety of
de∣sart regions, equally formidable, such as Amha∣ra, Olaca, Damot, and
Xaoa. Upon its arrival in the kingdom of Upper Egypt, it runs through a rocky
channel, which some late travellers have mistaken for its cataracts. In the
beginning of its course, it receives many lesser rivers into it; and
Pliny was mistaken, in saying that it received none. In the beginning
also of its course, it <PB N="214" REF="237"/> has many windings; but, for
above three hund∣red leagues from the sea, it runs in a direct line. Its
annual overflowings arise from a very ob∣vious cause, which is almost
universal with all the great rivers that take their source near the Line.
The rainy season, which is periodical in those climates, flood the
rivers; and as this al∣ways happens in our summer, so the Nile is at that
time overflown. From these inundations, the inhabitants of Egypt derive
happiness and plenty; and, when the river does not arise to its
accustomed heights, they prepare for an in∣different harvest. It begins to
overflow about the seventeenth of June; it generally continues to augment for
forty days, and decreases in about as many more. This time of encrease and
de∣crease, however, is much more inconsiderable now than it was among the
ancients. Hero∣dotus informs us, that it was an hundred days rising, and as
many falling; which shews that the inundation was much greater at that time
than at present. Mr. Buffon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p.
82.</BIBL></NOTE> has ascribed the pre∣sent diminution, as well to the
lessening of the mountains of the Moon, by their substance hav∣ing so
long been washed down with the stream, as to the rising of the earth in
Egypt, that has for so many ages received this extraneous supply. 
<PB N="215" REF="238"/> But we do not find, by the buildings that have remained
since the times of the ancients, that the earth is much raised since
then. Besides the Nile in Africa, we may reckon the Zara, and the Coanza,
from the greatness of whose open∣ings into the sea, and the rapidity of
whose streams, we form an estimate of the great di∣stance from whence
they come. Their courses, however, are spent in watering deserts and
sa∣vage countries, whose poverty or fierceness have kept strangers
away.</P>
<P>But of all parts of the world, America, as it exhibits the most
lofty mountains, so also it sup∣plies the largest rivers. The
foremost of these is the great river Amazons, which, from its source in
the lake of Lauricocha, to its dis∣charge into the Western Ocean, performs
a course of more than twelve hundred leagues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i. p. 388.</BIBL></NOTE>. The breadth and depth
of this river is answer∣able to its vast length; and, where its width is
most contracted, its depth is augmented in pro∣portion. So great is the body
of its waters, that other rivers, though before the objects of admiration,
themselves are lost in its bosom. It proceeds, after their junction, with
its usual ap∣pearance, without any visible change in its breadth or
rapidity; and, if we may so express <PB N="216" REF="239"/> it, remains
great without ostentation. In some places it displays its whole
magnificence, di∣viding into several large branches, and encom∣passing a
multitude of islands; and, at length, discharging itself into the ocean,
by a channel of an hundred and fifty miles broad. Another river, that may
almost rival the former, is the St. Lawrence, in Canada, which rising in
the lake Assiniboils, passes from one lake to another, from
Cristinaux to Alempigo, from thence to lake Superior; thence to the lake
Hurons; to lake Erie; to lake Ontario; and, at last, after a course of nine
hundred leagues, pours their collected waters into the Atlantic ocean. The
river Missisippi is of more than seven hundred leagues in length,
beginning at its source near the lake Assiniboils, and ending at its
opening into the Gulph of Mexico. The river Plate runs a length of more than
eight hundred leagues from its source in the river Parana, to its mouth. The
river Oroonoko is seven hundred and fifty-five leagues in length, from its
source near Pasto, to its discharge into the Atlantic ocean.</P>
<P>Such is the amazing length of our greatest rivers; and even in
some of these, the most re∣mote sources very probably yet continue
un∣known. In fact, if we consider the number of <PB N="217" REF="240"/> rivers
which they receive, and the little ac∣quaintance we have with the regions
through which they run, it is not to be wondered at that geographers are
divided concerning the sources of most of them. As among a number of roots
by which nourishment is conveyed to a stately tree, it is difficult to
determine precisely that by which the tree is chiefly supplied; so among
the many branches of a great river, it is equally difficult to tell which is
the original. Hence it may easily happen, that a smaller branch is taken
for the capital stream; and its runnings are pursued, and delineated, in
prejudice of some other branch that better deserved the name and the
description. In this manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p.
74.</BIBL></NOTE> in Europe, the Danube is known to receive thirty lesser
rivers: the Wolga, thirty-two or thirty-three. In Asia, the Hohanno receives
thirty-five; the Jenisca above sixty; the Oby as many; the Amour about
forty; the Nanquin receives thirty rivers; the Ganges twenty; and the Euphrates
about eleven. In Africa, the Senegal receives more than twenty rivers; the Nile
receives not one for five hundred leagues upwards, and then only twelve or
thirteen. In America, the river Amazons receives above sixty, and those
very considerable; the river <PB N="218" REF="241"/> St. Lawrence about forty,
counting those which fall into its lakes; the Missisippi receives
forty; and the river Plate above fifty.</P>
<P>I mentioned the inundations of the Ganges and the Nile, but almost
every other great river whose source lies within the tropics, have their
stated inundations also. The river Pegu has been called, by travellers, the
Indian Nile, be∣cause of the similar overflowings of its stream: this it
does to an extent of thirty leagues on each side; and so fertilizes the
soil, that the inha∣bitants send great quantities of rice into other
countries, and have still abundance for their own consumption. The river
Senegal has like∣wise its inundations, which cover the whole flat country of
Negroland, beginning and ending much about the same time with those of the
Nile; as, in fact, both rivers rise from the same mountains. But the
difference between the effects of the inundations in each river, is
re∣markable: in the one, it distributes health and plenty; but in the other,
diseases, famine, and death. The inhabitants along the torrid coasts of
the Senegal, can receive no benefit from any additional manure the river may
carry down to their soil, which is, by nature, more than suffi∣ciently
luxuriant; or, even if they could, they have not industry to turn it to any
advantage. <PB N="219" REF="242"/> The banks, therefore, of the rivers, lie
uncul∣tivated, overgrown with rank and noxious her∣bage, and infested with
thousands of animals of various malignity. Every new flood only tends to
encrease the rankness of the soil, and to pro∣vide fresh shelter for
the creatures that infest it. If the flood continues but a few days longer
than usual, the improvident inhabitants, who are driven up into the higher
grounds, begin to want provisions, and a famine ensues. When the river
begins to return into its channel, the hu∣midity and heat of the air are
equally fatal; and the carcases of infinite numbers of animals, swept away
by the inundation, putrefying in the sun, produce a stench that is almost
insupport∣able. But even the luxuriance of the vegetation itself, becomes a
nuisance. I have been assured, by persons of veracity that have been up
the river Senegal, that there are some plants that grow along the coast,
the smell of which is so powerful, that it is hardly to be endured. It is
certain, that all the sailors and soldiers who have been at any of our
factories there, ascribe the unwholsomeness of the voyage up the
stream, to the vegetable vapour. However this be, the inundations of the
rivers in this wretched part of the globe, contribute scarce any advantage,
if we except to the beauty of <PB N="220" REF="243"/> the prospects which they
afford. These, indeed, are finished up beyond the utmost reach of art: a
spacious glassy river, with its banks here and there fringed to the very
surface by the man∣grove-tree, that grows down into the water, presents
itself to view. Lofty forests of various colours, with openings between,
carpeted with green plants, and the most gaudy flowers; beasts and animals,
of various kinds, that stand upon the banks of the river, and, with a sort
of wild curiosity, survey the mariners as they pass, contribute to
heighten the scene. This is the sketch of an African prospect; which
delights the eye, even while it destroys the constitution.</P>
<P>Beside these annually periodical inundations, there are many
rivers that overflow at much shorter intervals. Thus most of those in
Peru and Chili have scarce any motion by night; but upon the appearance of
the morning sun, they resume their former rapidity: this proceeds from the
mountain snows, which melting with the heat, encrease the stream, and
continue to drive on the current while the sun continues to dissolve
them. Some rivers also flow with an even steady cur∣rent, from their
source to the sea; others flow with greater rapidity, their stream being
poured down in a cataract, or swallowed by the sands, before they reach the
sea.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="244"/>The rivers of those countries that have been
least inhabited, are usually more rocky, uneven, and broken into
water-falls or cataracts, than those where the industry of man has been
more prevalent. Wherever man comes, nature puts on a milder appearance: the
terrible and the sublime, are exchanged for the gentle and the useful; the
cataract is sloped away into a placid stream; and the banks become more
smooth and even<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p.
90.</BIBL></NOTE>. It must have required ages to render the Rhone or the
Loire navigable; their beds must have been cleaned and directed; their
in∣equalities removed; and, by a long course of industry, nature must
have been taught to con∣spire with the desires of her controller. Every
one's experience must have supplied instances of rivers thus being made
to flow more evenly, and more beneficially to mankind; but there are some
whose currents are so rapid, and falls so precipitate, that no art can
obviate; and that must for ever remain as amazing instances of incorrigible
nature.</P>
<P>Of this kind are the cataracts of the Rhine; one of which I have
seen exhibit a very strange appearance; it was that at Schathausen, which
was frozen quite across, and the water stood in columns where the cataract
had formerly fallen. The Nile, as was said, has its cataracts. The 
<PB N="222" REF="245"/> river Vologda, in Russia, has two. The river Zara,
in Africa, has one near its source. The river Velino, in Italy, has a
cataract of above an hundred and fifty feet perpendicular. Near the city
Gottenburgh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p.
325.</BIBL></NOTE>, in Sweden, the river there rushes down from a prodigious
high pre∣cipice, into a deep pit, with a terrible noise, and such dreadful
force, that those trees de∣signed for the masts of ships, which are
floated down the river, usually are turned upside down in their fall, and
often are shattered to pieces, by being dashed against the surface of
the water in the pit; this occurs if the masts fall sideways upon the
water; but if they fall end ways, they dive so far under water, that they
disappear for a quarter of an hour, or more: the pit into which they are thus
plunged, has been often sounded with a line of some hundred fathoms long,
but no ground has been found hitherto. There is also a cataract at
Powerscourt, in Ire∣land, in which, if I am rightly informed, the water falls
three hundred feet perpendicular; which is a greater descent than that of any
other cataract in any part of the world. There is a cataract at Albany, in the
province of New York, which pours its stream fifty feet per∣pendicular. But
of all the cataracts in the <PB N="223" REF="246"/> world, that of Niagara, in
Canada, if we con∣sider the great body of water that falls, must be allowed
to be the greatest, and the most asto∣nishing.</P>
<P>This amazing fall of water is made by the river St. Lawrence, in its
passage from the lake Erie into the lake Ontario. We have already said
that St. Lawrence was one of the largest rivers in the world; and yet the
whole of its waters are here poured down, by a fall of an hundred and fifty
feet perpendicular. It is not easy to bring the imagination to correspond
with the greatness of the scene; a river, extremely deep and rapid, and
that serves to drain the waters of almost all North America into the
At∣lantic ocean, is here poured precipitately down a ledge of rocks, that
rise, like a wall, across the whole bed of its stream. The width of the
river, a little above, is near three quarters of a mile broad; and the rocks,
where it grows narrower, are four hundred yards over. Their direction is not
streight across, but hollowing inwards like an horse-shoe; so that
the cataract, which bends to the shape of the obstacle, round∣ing inwards,
presents a kind of theatre the most tremendous in nature. Just in the
middle of this circular wall of waters, a little island, that has braved the
fury of the current, presents one <PB N="224" REF="247"/> of its points, and
divides the stream at top into two; but it unites again long before it has
got to the bottom. The noise of the fall is heard at several leagues
distance; and the fury of the waters at the bottom of their fall, is
inconceiv∣able. The dashing produces a mist that rises to the very
clouds; and that produces a most beautiful rainbow, when the sun shines.
It may easily be conceived, that such a cataract quite destroys the
navigation of the stream; and yet some Indian canoes, as it is said, have
been known to venture down it with safety.</P>
<P>Of those rivers that lose themselves in the sands, or are
swallowed up by chasms in the earth, we have various information. What we
are told by the ancients, of the river Al∣pheus, in Arcadia, that sinks into
the ground, and rises again near Syracuse, in Sicily, where it takes the
name of Arethusa, is rather more known than credited. But we have better
in∣formation with respect to the river Tigris being lost in this manner
under Mount Taurus; of the Guadalquiver, in Spain, being buried in the sands;
of the river Greatah, in Yorkshire, running underground, and rising again;
and even of the great Rhine itself, a part of which is no doubt lost in the
sands, a little above Leyden. But it ought to be observed of this 
<PB N="225" REF="248"/> river, that by much the greatest part arrives at the
ocean. For, although the ancient channel which fell into the sea, a little to
the west of that city, be now entirely choaked up, yet there are still a
number of small canals, that carry a great body of waters to the sea: and,
besides, it has also two very large openings, the Lech, and the Wal, below
Rotterdam, by which it empties itself abundantly.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, nothing is more common in sultry and sandy
deserts, than rivers being thus either lost in the sands, or entirely
dried up by the sun. And hence we see, that under the Line, the small
rivers are but few; for such little streams as are common in Europe, and
which with us receive the name of rivers, would quickly evaporate, in those
parching and ex∣tensive deserts. It is even confidently asserted, that
the great river Niger itself is thus lost be∣fore it reaches the ocean; and
that its supposed mouths, the Gambia, and the Senegal, are distinct
rivers, that come a vast way from the in∣terior parts of the country. It
appears, there∣fore, that the rivers under the Line are large; but it is
otherwise at the Poles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz's History of
Greenland, vol. i. p. 41.</BIBL></NOTE>, where they must necessarily be
small. In that desolate <PB N="226" REF="249"/> region, as the mountains are
covered with per∣petual ice, which melts but little, or not at all, the
springs and rivulets are furnished with a very small supply. Here,
therefore, men and beasts would perish, and die for thirst, if Providence
had not ordered, that in the hardest winter, thaws should intervene, which
deposit a small quantity of snow-water in pools under the ice; and from
this source the wretched inhabitants drain a scanty beverage.</P>
<P>Thus, whatever quarter of the globe we turn to, we shall find new
reasons to be satisfied with that part of it in which we ourselves
reside. Our rivers furnish all the plenty of the African stream, without
its inundation; they have all the coolness of the Polar rivulet, with a more
constant supply; they may want the terrible magnificence of huge cataracts,
or extensive lakes, but they are more navigable, and more transparent;
though less deep and rapid than the rivers of the torrid zone, they are more
manageable, and only wait the will of man to take their direction. The rivers
of the torrid zone, like the monarchs of the country, rule with despotic
tyranny, profuse in their boun∣ties, and ungovernable in their rage. The
ri∣vers of Europe, like their kings, are the friends, and not the
oppressors of the people; bounded by known limits, abridged in the 
<PB N="227" REF="250"/> power of doing ill, directed by human sagacity, and
only at freedom to distribute happiness and plenty.</P>

<DIV1 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of the Ocean in general; and of its Saltness.</HEAD>
<P>IF we look upon a map of the world, we shall find that the ocean
occupies considerably more of the globe, than the land is found to do. This
immense body of waters is diffused round both the Old and New Continent, to
the south; and may surround them also to the north, for what we know, but
the ice in those regions has stopped our enquiries. Although the ocean,
properly speaking, is but one extensive sheet of waters, continued over
every part of the globe, without interruption, and although no part of it is
divided from the rest, yet geographers have distinguished it by different
names; as the At∣lantic or Western Ocean, the Northern Ocean, the Southern
Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. Others have divided it
differ∣ently, and given other names; as the Frozen Ocean, the Inferior Ocean,
or the American Ocean. But all these being arbitrary di∣stinctions, and not
of Nature's making, the na∣turalist may consider them with
indifference.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="251"/>In this vast receptacle, almost all the
rivers of the earth ultimately terminate; nor do such great supplies seem
to encrease its stores; for it is neither apparently swollen by their
tribute, nor diminished by their failure; it still continues the same.
Indeed, what is the quantity of water of all the rivers and lakes in the world,
compared to that contained in this great recep∣tacle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 70.</BIBL></NOTE>? If we should offer
to make a rude esti∣mate, we shall find that all the rivers in the world,
flowing into the bed of the sea, with a continuance of their present
stores, would take up at least eight hundred years to fill it to its
present height. For, supposing the sea to be eighty-five millions of
square miles in extent, and a quarter of a mile, upon an average, in depth,
this, upon calculation, will give above twenty-one millions of cubic miles of
water, as the contents of the whole ocean. Now, to estimate the quantity of
water which all the rivers supply, take any one of them; the Po, for
instance, the quantity of whose discharge into the sea, is known to be
one cubic mile of water in twenty-six days. Now it will be found, upon a rude
computation, from the quantity of ground the Po, with its influent streams,
covers, that all the rivers of the world furnish about <PB N="229" REF="252"/>
two thousand times that quantity of water. In the space of a year,
therefore, they will have discharged into the sea about twenty-six
thou∣sand cubic miles of water; and not till eight hundred years, will they
have discharged as much water as is contained in the sea at present. I
have not troubled the reader with the odd numbers, lest he should imagine I
was giving precision to a subject that is incapable of it.</P>
<P>Thus great is the assemblage of waters diffused round our
habitable globe; and yet, immeasur∣able as they seem, they are mostly
rendered sub∣servient to the necessities and the conveniencies of so
little a being as man. Nevertheless, if it should be asked whether they
be made for him alone, the question is not easily resolved. Some
philosophers have perceived so much analogy to man in the formation of the
ocean, that they have not hesitated to assert its being made for him
alone. The distribution of land and water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Derham Physico Theol.</BIBL></NOTE>, say they, is
admirable; the one being laid against the other so skilfully, that there
is a just equipoise of the whole globe. Thus the Northern ocean balances
against the Southern; and the New Continent is an exact counter-weight to the
Old. As to any objection from the ocean's occupying too large a share of 
<PB N="230" REF="253"/> the globe, they contend, that there could not have been
a smaller surface employed to supply the earth with a due share of
evaporation. On the other hand, some take the gloomy side of the
question; they either magnify 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Burnet's Theory.
Passim.</BIBL></NOTE> its apparent defects; or assert, that 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pope's Ethic Epistles.
Passim.</BIBL></NOTE> what seems defects to us, may be real beauties to
some wiser order of beings. They observe, that multitudes of ani∣mals are
concealed in the ocean, and but a small part of them are known; the rest,
therefore, they fail not to say, were certainly made for their own benefit,
and not for ours. How far either of these opinions be just, I will not
presume to determine; but of this we are certain, that God has endowed us
with abilities to turn this great extent of waters to our own advantage. He has
made these things, perhaps, for other uses; but he has given us faculties
to convert them to our own. This much agi∣tated question, therefore, seems
to terminate here. We shall never know whether the things of this world have
been made for our use; but we very well know, that we have been made to enjoy
them. Let us then boldly affirm, that the earth, and all its wonders, are ours;
since we are furnished with powers to force them into <PB N="231" REF="254"/> our service. Man is the lord of all the sublunary creation; the
howling savage, the winding ser∣pent, with all the untamable and rebellious
off∣spring of Nature, are destroyed in the contest, or driven at a
distance from his habitations. The extensive and tempestuous ocean,
instead of li∣miting or dividing his power, only serves to assist his
industry, and enlarge the sphere of his en∣joyments. Its billows, and its
monsters, instead of presenting a scene of terror, only call up the
courage of this little intrepid being; and the greatest dangers that man now
fears on the deep, is from his fellow creatures. Indeed, when I consider the
human race as Nature has formed them, there is but very little of the habitable
globe that seems made for them. But when I consider them as accumulating
the experience of ages, in commanding the earth, there is nothing so great,
or so terrible. What a poor contemptible being is the naked savage,
standing on the beach of the ocean, and trem∣bling at its tumults! How little
capable is he of converting its terrors into benefits; or of saying, behold
an element made wholly for my enjoy∣ment! He considers it as an angry deity,
and pays it the homage of submission. But it is very different when he
has exercised his mental <PB N="232" REF="255"/> powers; when he has learned
to find his own superiority, and to make it subservient to his commands.
It is then that his dignity begins to appear, and that the true Deity is
justly praised for having been mindful of man; for having given him the
earth for his habitation, and the sea for an inheritance.</P>
<P>This power which man has obtained over the ocean, was at first
enjoyed in common; and none pretended to a right in that element where all
seemed intruders. The sea, therefore, was open to all till the time of the
emperor Justi∣nian. His successor Leo granted such as were in
possession of the shore, the sole right of fishing before their
respective territories. The Thracian Bosphorus was the first that was
thus appropriated; and from that time it has been the struggle of most of
the powers of Europe to obtain an exclusive right in this element. The
Republic of Venice claims the Adriatic. The Danes are in possession of
the Baltic. But the English have a more extensive claim to the empire of
all the seas, encompassing the king∣doms of England, Scotland, and
Ireland; and altho' these have been long contested, yet they are now
considered as their indisputable pro∣perty. Every one knows that the great
power <PB N="233" REF="256"/> of the nation is exerted on this element; and that
the instant England ceases to be superior upon the ocean, its safety
begins to be pre∣carious.</P>
<P>It is in some measure owing to our depend∣ance upon the sea,
and to our commerce there, that we are so well acquainted with its extent and
figure. The bays, gulphs, currents, and shallows of the ocean, are much
better known and examined than the provinces and kingdoms of the earth
itself. The hopes of acquiring wealth by commerce, has carried man to much
greater lengths than the desire of gaining in∣formation could have done. In
consequence of this, there is scarce a strait or an harbour, scarce a
rock or a quicksand, scarce an inflexion of the shore, or the jutting of
a promontory, that has not been minutely described. But as these present
very little entertainment to the imagination, or delight to any but those
whose pursuits are lucrative, they need not be dwelt upon here. While the
merchant and the ma∣riner are solicitous in describing currents and
soundings, the naturalist is employed in ob∣serving wonders, though not
so beneficial, yet to him of a much more important nature. The saltness
of the sea seems to be the foremost.</P>
<P>Whence the sea has derived that peculiar bit∣terish saltness
which we find in it, appears, by <PB N="234" REF="257"/> Aristotle, to have
exercised the curiosity of na∣turalists in all ages. He supposed (and
man∣kind were for ages content with the solution) that the sun continually
raised dry saline exha∣lations from the earth, and deposited them upon
the sea; and hence, say his followers, the waters of the sea are more
salt at top than at bottom. But, unfortunately for this opinion, neither of
the facts is true. Sea salt is not to be raised by the vapours of the
sun; and sea water is not salter at the top than at the bottom. Father
Bohours is of opinion that the Creator gave the waters of the ocean their
saltness at the begin∣ing; not only to prevent their corruption, but to
enable them to bear greater burthens. But their saltness does not prevent
their corruption; for stagnant sea-water, like fresh, soon grows
putrid: and, as for their bearing greater bur∣thens, fresh water answers
all the purposes of navigation quite as well. The established opi∣nion,
therefore, is that of Boyle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. iii. p.
221.</BIBL></NOTE>, who supposes, 
<Q REND="inline">"that the sea's saltness is supplied not
only from rocks or masses of salt at the bottom of the sea, but also
from the salt which the rains and rivers, and other waters, dissolve in
their passage thro' many parts of the earth, and at length carry with them
to the sea."</Q> But as there is a differ∣ence <PB N="235" REF="258"/> in the
taste of rock-salt found at land, and that dissolved in the waters of
the ocean, this may be produced by the plenty of nitrous and bituminous bodies
that, with the salts, are like∣wise washed into that great receptacle.
These substances being thus once carried to the sea, must for ever
remain there; for they do not rise by evaporation, so as to be returned
back from whence they came. Nothing but the fresh waters of the sea rise
in vapours; and all the saltness remains behind. From hence it follows,
that every year the sea must become more and more salt; and this
speculation Doctor Halley carries so far as to lay down a method of finding
out the age of the world by the saltness of its waters. 
<Q REND="inline">"For if it be observed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. v. p. 218.</BIBL></NOTE>," says he,
"what quantity of salt is at present con∣tained in a certain weight of
water, taken up from the Caspian Sea, for example, and, after some
centuries, what greater quantity of salt is contained in the same weight of
water, taken from the same place; we may conclude, that in proportion as the
saltness has encreased in a certain time, so much must it have
encreased before that time; and we may thus, by the rule of proportion, make
an estimate of the whole time wherein the water would acquire the degree 
<PB N="236" REF="259"/> of saltness it should be then possessed
of."</Q> All this may be fine; however, an experiment, be∣gun in this century,
which is not to be completed till some centuries hence, is rather a little
mor∣tifying to modern curiosity: and, I am induced to think, the inhabitants
round the Caspian sea, will not be apt to undertake the enquiry.</P>
<P>This saltness is found to prevail in every part of the ocean;
and as much at the surface, as at the bottom. It is also found in all
those seas that communicate with the ocean; but ra∣ther in a less
degree.</P>
<P>The great lakes, likewise, that have no out∣lets nor communication
with the ocean, are found to be salt; but some of them in less
proportion. On the contrary, all those lakes through which rivers run into
the sea, however extensive they be, are, notwithstanding, very fresh:
for the rivers do not deposit their salts in the bed of the lake, but carry
them, with their currents, into the ocean. Thus the lakes Ontario and Erie, in
North America, although for mag∣nitude they may be considered as inland
seas, are, nevertheless, fresh water lakes; and kept so by the river
St. Lawrence, which passes through them. But those lakes that have no
communication with the sea, nor any rivers going out, although they be less
than the <PB N="237" REF="260"/> former, are, however, always salt. Thus, that
which goes by the name of the Dead Sea, tho' very small, when compared to
those already mentioned, is so exceedingly salt, that its waters seem
scarce capable of dissolving any more. The lakes of Mexico, and of
Titicaca, in Peru, though of no great extent, are, nevertheless salt; and
both for the same reason.</P>
<P>Those who are willing to turn all things to the best, have not
failed to consider this salt∣ness of the sea, as a peculiar
blessing from Pro∣vidence, in order to keep so great an element sweet
and wholsome. What foundation there may be in the remark, I will not pretend
to determine; but we shall shortly find a much better cause for its being
kept sweet, namely by its motion.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there have been many who have considered the
subject in a different light, and have tried every endeavour to make
salt-water fresh, so as to supply the wants of mariners in long
voyages, or when exhausted of their ordinary stores. At first it was
supposed simple distillation would do; but it was soon found that the
bitter part of the water still kept mixed. It was then tried by uniting
salt of Tartar with sea-water, and distilling both: but here the expence
was greater than the ad∣vantage. Calcined bones were next thought 
<PB N="238" REF="261"/> of; but an hogshead of calcined bones, carried to
sea, would take up as much room as an hogshead of water, and was more hard
to be ob∣tained. In this state, therefore, have the attempts to sweeten
sea-water rested; the chymist satisfied with the reality of his
invention; and the ma∣riner convinced of its being useless. I cannot,
therefore, avoid mentioning a kind of succeda∣neum which has been lately
conceived to answer the purposes of fresh-water, when mariners are quite
exhausted. It is well known, that persons who go into a warm bath, come out
several ounces heavier than they went in; their bodies having imbibed a
correspondent quantity of water. This more particularly happens, if they have
been previously debarred from drinking, or go in with a violent thirst;
which they quickly find quenched, and their spirits restored. It was
supposed, that in case of a total failure of fresh-water at sea, a
warm bath might be made of sea-water, for the use of mariners; and that
their pores would thus imbibe the fluid, without any of its salts, which
would be seen to cry∣stallize on the surface of their bodies. In this
manner, it is supposed, a sufficient quantity of moisture may be
procured to sustain life, till time or accident furnish a more copious
supply.</P>
<P>But, however this be, the saltness of the sea 
<PB N="239" REF="262"/> can by no means be considered as a principal cause
in preserving its waters from putrefaction. The ocean has its currents, like
rivers, which circulate its contents round the globe; and these may be said
to be the great agents that keep it sweet and wholsome. Its saltness
alone would by no means answer this purpose: and some have even imagined,
that the various substances with which it is mixed, rather tend to promote
pu∣tresence than impede it. Sir Robert Hawkins, one of our most enlightened
navigators, gives the following account of a calm, in which the sea
continuing for some time without motion, began to assume a very
formidable appearance. 
<Q REND="inline">"Were it not," says he, "for the moving of the
sea, by the force of winds, tides, and cur∣rents, it would corrupt all the
world. The ex∣periment of this I say in the year 1590, lying with a fleet
about the islands of Azores, almost six months; the greatest part of
which time we were becalmed. Upon which all the sea be∣came so
replenished with several sorts of gellies, and forms of serpents,
adders, and snakes, as seemed wonderful: some green, some black, some
yellow, some white, some of divers colours, and many of them had life; and
some there were an yard and an half, and two yards long; which had I not
seen, I could hardly have <PB N="240" REF="263"/> believed. And hereof are
witnesses all the company of the ships which were then present: so
that hardly a man could draw a bucket of water clear of some corruption. In
which voyage, towards the end thereof, many of every ship fell sick, and
began to die apace. But the speedy passage into our country, was a remedy
to the craz'd, and a preservative for those that were not touched."</Q></P>
<P>This shews, abundantly, how little the sea's saltness was
capable of preserving it from pu∣trefaction: but to put the matter beyond all
doubt, Mr. Boyle kept a quantity of sea-water, taken up in the English
channel, for some time barrelled up; and, in the space of a few weeks, it
began to acquire a foetid smell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol.
iii. p. 222.</BIBL></NOTE>: He was also assured, by one of his
acquaintance who was becalmed for twelve or fourteen days in the Indian sea,
that the water, for want of motion, began to stink; and that had it continued
much longer, the stench would probably have poisoned him. It is the motion,
therefore, and not the saltness of the sea, that preserves it in its
present state of salubrity; and this, very probably, by dashing and
breaking in pieces the rudiments, if I may so call them, of the various
animals that would otherwise breed there, and puterfy.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="264"/>There are some advantages, however, which
are derived from the saltness of the sea. Its waters being evaporated,
furnish that salt which is used for domestic purposes; and, although
in some places it is made from springs, and, in others, dug out of mines,
yet the greatest quantity is made only from the sea. That which is called
bay-salt, (from its coming to us by the Bay of Biscay) is a stronger
kind, made by eva∣poration in the sun: that called common salt, is
evaporated in pans over the fire, and is of a much inferior quality to the
former.</P>
<P>Another benefit arising from the quantity of salt dissolved
in the sea, is, that it thus becomes heavier, and, consequently, more
buoyant. Mr. Boyle, who examined the difference between sea-water and
fresh, found that the former appeared to be about a forty-fifth part heavier
than the latter. Those, also, who have had opportunities of bathing in the
sea, pretend to have expe∣rienced a much greater ease in swimming there,
than in fresh water. However, as we see they have only a forty-fifth part
more of their weight sustained by it, I am apt to doubt whether so minute
a difference can be practically per∣ceivable. Be this as it may, as sea-water
alters in its weight from fresh, so it is found also to differ from
itself in different parts of the ocean. <PB N="242" REF="265"/> In general, it
is perceived to be heavier, and, consequently, salter, the nearer we
approach the Line<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p.
297.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But there is an advantage arising from the saltness of the
waters of the sea, much greater than what has been yet mentioned; which is,
that their congelation is thus retarded. Some, indeed, have gone so far as to
say, that 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Macrobius.</BIBL></NOTE>
sea-water never freezes: but this is an assertion con∣tradicted by
experience. However, it is cer∣tain that it requires a much greater degree of
cold to freeze it, than fresh water; so that, while rivers and springs
are seen converted into one solid body of ice, the sea is always fit for
na∣vigation, and no way affected by the coldness of the severest winter.
It is, therefore, one of the greatest blessings we derive from this
element, that when at land all the stores of Nature are locked up from us, we
find the sea ever open to our necessities, and patient of the hand of
industry.</P>
<P>But it must not be supposed, because in our temperate
climate we never see the sea frozen, that it is in the same manner open
in every part of it. A very little acquaintance with the ac∣counts of mariners,
must have informed us, that at the polar regions it is embarrassed with
moun∣tains, <PB N="243" REF="266"/> and moving sheets of ice, that often
ren∣der it impassable. These tremendous floats are of different
magnitudes; sometimes rising more than a thousand feet above the
surface of the water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz's History of
Greenland, vol. i. p. 31.</BIBL></NOTE>; sometimes diffused into plains of
above two hundred leagues in length; and, in many parts, sixty or eighty
broad. They are usually divided by fissures; one piece following another
so close, that a person may step from one to the other. Sometimes
mountains are seen rising amidst these plains, and presenting the
appear∣ance of a variegated landscape, with hills and valleys, houses,
churches, and towers. These are appearances in which all naturalists are
agreed; but the great contest is respecting their formation. Mr. Buffon
asserts<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buf∣fon, vol. ii. p.
91.</BIBL></NOTE>, that they are formed from fresh water alone; which
congealing at the mouths of great rivers, ac∣cumulate those huge masses
that disturb navi∣gation. However, this great naturalist seems not to
have been aware that there are two sorts of ice floating in these seas;
the flat ice, and the mountain ice: the one formed of sea-water only; the
other, of fresh<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The flat, or driving ice, is entirely composed 
<PB N="244" REF="267"/> of sea-water; which, upon dissolution, is found to
be salt; and is readily distinguished from the mountain or fresh-water
ice, by its whiteness, and want of transparency. This ice is much more
terrible to mariners than that which rises up in lumps: a ship can avoid
the one, as it is seen at a distance; but it often gets in among the other,
which sometimes closing, crushes it to pieces. This, which manifestly
has a dif∣ferent origin from the fresh-water ice, may per∣haps have been
produced in the Icy Sea, be∣neath the Pole; or along the coasts of
Spitz∣berg, or Nova Zembla.</P>
<P>The mountain-ice, as was said, is different in every respect,
being formed of fresh water, and appearing hard and transparent; it is
ge∣nerally of a pale green colour, though some pieces are of a beautiful
sky blue; many large masses, also, appear grey; and some black. If
examined more nearly, they are found to be in∣corporated with earth, stones,
and brush-wood washed from the shore. On these also, are sometimes
found, not only earth, but nests with birds eggs, at several hundred miles
from land. The generality of these, though almost totally fresh, have,
nevertheless, a thick crust of salt-water frozen upon them, probably from
the power that ice has sometimes to produce ice. <PB N="245" REF="268"/> Such
mountains as are here described, are most usually seen at
spring-time, and after a violent storm, driving out to sea, where they at
first terrify the mariner, and are soon after dashed to pieces by the
continual washing of the waves; or driven into the warmer regions of the
south, there to be melted away. They sometimes, however, strike back upon
their native shores, where they seem to take root at the feet of mountains;
and, as Martius tells us, are some∣times higher than the mountains
themselves. Those seen by him were blue, full of clefts and cavities made
by the rain, and crowned with snow, which alternately thawing and freezing
every year, augmented their size. These, com∣posed of materials more
solid than that driving at sea, presented a variety of agreeable figures
to the eye, that, with a little help from fancy, assumed the appearance of
trees in blossom; the inside of churches, with arches, pillars, and
windows; and the blue coloured rays, darting from within, presented the
resemblance of a glory.</P>
<P>If we enquire into the origin and formation of these, which, as we
see, are very different from the former, I think we have a very
sa∣tisfactory account of them in Krantz's History <PB N="246" REF="269"/> of
Greenland; and I will take leave to give the passage, with a very few
alterations. 
<Q REND="inline">"These mountains of ice," says he, "are not
salt, like the sea-water, but sweet; and, therefore, can be formed no
where except on the mountains, in rivers, in caverns, and against the hills
near the sea-shore. The mountains of Greenland are so high, that the
snow which falls upon them, particularly on the north side, is, in one
night's time, wholly converted into ice: they also con∣tain clefts and
cavities, where the sun seldom or never injects his rays: besides
these, are pro∣jections, or landing-places, on the declivities of the
steepest hills, where the rain and snow-water lodge, and quickly congeal.
When now the accumulated flakes of snow slide down, or fall with the rain
from the eminences above, on these prominences; or, when here and there a
mountain-spring comes rolling down to such a lodging place, where the ice
has already seated itself, they all freeze, and add their tribute to it.
This, by degrees, waxes to a body of ice, that can no more be overpowered by
the sun; and which, though it may indeed, at certain seasons, diminish
by a thaw, yet, upon the whole, through annual acquisitions, it assumes
an annual growth. Such a body of ice is often prominent far over 
<PB N="247" REF="270"/> the rocks. It does not melt on the upper sur∣face, but
underneath; and also cracks into many larger or smaller clefts, from whence
the thawed water trickles out. By this it becomes, at last, so weak, that
being overloaded with its own ponderous bulk, it breaks loose, and tumbles
down the rocks with a terrible crash. Where it happens to overhang a
precipice on the shore, it plunges into the deep with a shock like
thun∣der; and with such an agitation of the water, as will overset a boat
at some distance, as many a poor Greenlander has fatally experienced."</Q>
Thus are these amazing ice mountains launched forth to sea, and found
floating in the waters round both the Poles. It is these that have hindered
mariners from discovering the ex∣tensive countries that lie round the South
Pole; and that probably block up the passage to China by the North.</P>
<P>I will conclude this chapter with one effect more, produced by the
saltness of the sea; which is, the luminous appearance of its waves in
the night. All who have been spectators of a sea by night, a little ruffled
with winds, sel∣dom fail of observing its fiery brightness. In 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. i. p. 294.</BIBL></NOTE>
some places it shines as far as the eye can reach; <PB N="248" REF="271"/>
at other times, only when the waves boom against the side of the
vessel, or the oar dashes into the water. Some seas shine often;
others more seldom; some, ever when particular winds blow; and others,
within a narrow compass; a long tract of light being seen along the
surface, whilst all the rest is hid in total darkness. It is not easy
to account for these extraordinary ap∣pearances: some have supposed
that a number of luminous insects produced the effect, and this is in reality
sometimes the case; in general, however, they have every resemblance to
that light produced by electricity; and, probably, arise from the agitation
and dashing of the saline particles of the fluid against each other. But
the manner in which this is done, for we can produce nothing similar, by any
experi∣ments hitherto made, remains for some happier accident to discover.
Our progress in the knowledge of nature is slow; and it is a mor∣tifying
consideration, that we are hitherto more indebted for success to chance
than industry.</P>

<PB N="249" REF="272"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of the Tides, Motion, and Currents of the Sea; with
their Effects.</HEAD>
<P>IT was said in the former chapter, that the waters of the sea
were kept sweet by their mo∣tion; without which they would soon putrefy,
and spread universal infection. If we look for final causes, here,
indeed, we have a great and an obvious one that presents itself before us.
Had the sea been made without motion, and resembling a pool of stagnant
water, the nobler races of animated nature would shortly be at an end.
Nothing would then be left alive but swarms of ill formed creatures, with
scarce more than vegetable life; and subsisting by putre∣faction. Were
this extensive bed of waters entirely quiescent, millions of the smaller
reptile kinds would there find a proper retreat to breed and multiply in; they
would find there no agi∣tations, no concussion in the parts of the fluid to
crush their feeble frames, or to force them from the places where they were
bred: there they would multiply in security and ease, enjoy a short life,
and, putrefying, thus again give nourishment to numberless others, as
little <PB N="250" REF="273"/> worthy of existence as themselves. But the
motion of this great element, effectually destroys the number of these
viler creatures; its currents, and its tides, produce continual agitations, the
shock of which they are not able to endure; the parts of the fluid rub
against each other, destroy all viscidities; and the ocean, if I may so
express it, acquires health by exercise.</P>
<P>The most obvious motion of the sea, and the most generally
acknowledged, is that of its tides. This element is observed to flow for
certain hours, from south towards north; in which motion or flux, which
lasts about six hours, the sea gradually swells; so that entering the
mouths of rivers, it drives back the river waters to their heads. After a
continual flux of six hours, the sea seems to rest for a quarter of an
hour; and then begins to ebb, or retire back again, from north to south, for
six hours more; in which time the waters sinking, the rivers resume their
natural course. After a seeming pause of a quarter of an hour, the sea
again begins to flow as before: and thus it has alternately risen and fallen,
twice a day, since the creation.</P>
<P>This amazing appearance did not fail to ex∣cite the curiosity, as
it did the wonder of the ancients. After some wild conjectures of the 
<PB N="251" REF="274"/> earliest philosophers, it became well known, in the
times of Pliny, that the tides were entirely under the influence, in a small
degree, of the sun; but in a much greater of the moon. It was found that
there was a flux and reflux of the sea, in the space of twelve hours fifty
mi∣nutes, which is exactly the time of a lunar day. It was observed, that
whenever the moon was in the meridian, or, in other words, as nearly as
possible over any part of the sea, that the sea flowed to that part,
and made a tide there; on the contrary, it was found, that when the moon left
the meridian, the sea began to flow back again from whence it came; and there
might be said to ebb. Thus far the waters of the sea seemed very
regularly to attend the motions of the moon. But as it appeared, likewise,
that when the moon was in the opposite meridian, as far off as possible
on the other side of the globe, that there was a tide on this side also;
so that the moon produced two tides, one by her greatest approach to us,
and another by her greatest distance from us: in other words, the moon, in
once going round the earth, pro∣duced two tides, always at the same time; one
on the part of the globe directly under her; and the other, on the part of the
globe directly opposite.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="275"/>Mankind continued for several ages content
with knowing the general cause of these won∣ders, hopeless of
discovering the particular manner of the moon's operation. Kepler was the
first who conjectured that attraction was the principal cause;
asserting, that the sphere of the moon's operation extended to the earth,
and drew up its waters. The precise manner in which this is done, was
discovered by Newton.</P>
<P>The moon has been found, like all the rest of the planets, to
attract, and to be attracted by the earth. This attraction prevails throughout
our whole planetary system. The more matter there is contained in any body,
the more it at∣tracts: and its influence decreases in proportion as the
distance, when squared, encreases. This being premised, let us see
what must ensue upon supposing the moon in the meridian of any tract of
the sea. The surface of the water im∣mediately under the moon, is nearer
the moon than any other part of the globe is; and, therefore, must be more
subject to its attraction than the waters any where else. The waters will,
therefore, be attracted by the moon, and rise in an heap; whose eminence
will be the highest where the attraction is greatest. In order to form this
eminence, it is obvious that <PB N="253" REF="276"/> the surface, as well as
the depths, will be agitated; and that wherever the water runs from one part,
succeeding waters must run to fill up the space it has left. Thus the
waters of the sea, running from all parts, to attend the mo∣tions of the
moon, produce the flowing of the tide; and it is high tide at that part
wherever the moon comes over it, or into its meridian.</P>
<P>But when the moon travels onward, and ceases to point over the
place where the waters were just risen, the cause here of their rising
ceasing to operate, they will flow back by their natural gravity, into the
lower parts from whence they had travelled; and this retiring of the waters
will form the ebbing of the sea.</P>
<P>Thus the first part of the demonstration is obvious; since, in
general, it requires no great sagacity to conceive that the waters nearest
the moon are most attracted, or raised highest by the moon. But the other
part of the demon∣stration, namely, how there come to be high tides at the
same time, on the opposite side of the globe, and where the waters are
farthest from the moon, is not so easy to conceive. To comprehend this,
it must be observed, that the part of the earth, and its waters, that are
farthest from the moon, are the parts of all others that 
<PB N="254" REF="277"/> are least attracted by the moon: it must also be
observed, that all the waters, when the moon is on the opposite side of
the earth, must be at∣tracted by it in the same direction that the earth
itself attracts them; that is, if I may so say, quite through the body of
the earth, towards the moon itself. This, therefore, being con∣ceived, it is
plain that those waters which are farthest from the moon, will have less
weight than those of any other part, on the same side of the globe;
because the moon's attraction, which conspires with the earth's attraction,
is there least. Now, therefore, the waters farthest from the moon, having
less weight, and being lightest, will be pressed on all sides, by
those that, having more attraction, are heavier: they will be pressed, I
say, on all sides; and the heavier waters flowing in, will make them
swell and rise in an eminence directly opposite to that on the other
side of the globe, caused by the more immediate influence of the moon.</P>
<P>In this manner the moon, in one diurnal re∣volution, produces two
tides; one raised imme∣diately under the sphere of its influence, and the
other directly opposite to it. As the moon travels, this vast body of
waters rears upward, as if to watch its motions; and pursues the same
constant rotation. However, in this great work <PB N="255" REF="278"/> of
raising the tides, the sun has no small share; it produces its own
tides constantly every day, just as the moon does, but in a much less
degree, because the sun is at an immensely greater di∣stance. Thus
there are solar tides, and lunar tides. When the forces of these two great
lu∣minaries concur, which they always do when they are either in the same, or
in opposite parts of the heavens, they jointly produce a much greater tide,
than when they are so situated in the heavens, as each to make peculiar
tides of their own. To express the very same thing technically; in the
conjunctions and oppositions of the sun and moon, the attraction of the
sun conspires with the attraction of the moon; by which means the high
spring-tides are formed. But in the quadratures of the sun and moon, the
water raised by the one is depressed by the other; and hence the lower
neap tides have their production. In a word, the tides are greatest in the
syzigies, and least in the quadratures.</P>
<P>This theory well understood, and the astro∣nomical terms
previously known, it may readily be brought to explain the various
appearances of the tides, if the earth were covered with a deep sea, and the
waters uninfluenced by shoals, currents, straits, or tempests. But in
every part of the sea, near the shores, the geographer 
<PB N="256" REF="279"/> must come in to correct the calculations of the
astronomer. For, by reason of the shallowness of some places, and the
narrowness of the straits in others, there arises a great diversity in
the effect, not to be accounted for without an exact knowledge of all the
circumstances of the place. In the great depths of the ocean, for instance,
a very slow and imperceptible motion of the whole body of water will
suffice to raise its sur∣face several feet high; but if the same
encrease of water is to be conveyed through a narrow channel, it must
rush through it with the most impetuous rapidity. Thus in the English
channel, and the German ocean, the tide is found to flow strongest in
those places that are narrowest; the same quantity of water being, in
this case, to be driven through a smaller pas∣sage. It is often seen,
therefore, pouring through a streight with great force; and, by its rapidity,
considerably raised above the surface of that part of the ocean into
which it runs.</P>
<P>This shallowness and narrowness in many parts of the sea,
give also rise to a peculiarity in the tides of some parts of the world.
For in many places, and in our own seas in par∣ticular, the greatest
swell of the tide is not while the moon is at its meridian height, and
directly over the place, but some time after it <PB N="257" REF="280"/> has
declined from thence. The sea, in this case, being obstructed, pursues
the moon with what dispatch it can, but does not arrive with all its waters
till long after the moon has ceased to operate. Lastly, from this
shallowness of the sea, and from its being obstructed by shoals and
streights, we may account for the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Black
Sea, having no sen∣sible tides. These, though to us they seem very
extensive, are not however large enough to be affected by the influence of
the moon; and as to their communication with the ocean, that is through such
narrow inlets, that it is impossible in a few hours time that they should
receive and return water enough to raise or depress them in any
considerable degree.</P>
<P>In general, therefore, we may observe, that all tides are much
higher, and more considerable in the torrid zone, than in the rest of the
ocean; the sea in those parts being generally deeper, and less affected
by changeable winds, or winding shores<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon,
vol. ii. p. 187.</BIBL></NOTE>. The greatest tide we know of, is that at the
mouth of the river Indus, where the water rises thirty feet in height. How
great, there∣fore, must have been the amazement of Alex∣ander's soldiers at
so strange an appearance! They who always before had been accustomed 
<PB N="258" REF="281"/> only to the scarcely perceptible risings of the
Mediterranean, or the minute intumescence of the Black Sea, when made at once
spectators of a river rising and falling thirty feet in a few hours, must
no doubt have felt the most extreme awe, and, as we are told<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Quintius Curtius.</BIBL></NOTE>, a mixture of
curiosity and apprehension. The tides are also remarkably high on the
coasts of Malay, in the streights of Sunda, in the Red Sea, at the mouth of
the river St. Lawrence, along the coasts of China and Japan, at Panama, and
in the gulph of Bengal. The tides at Tonquin, however, are the most
remarkable in the world. In this part there is but one tide, and one ebb, in
twenty-four hours; whereas, as we have said before, in other places there are
two. Besides, there, twice in each month there is no tide at all, when the
moon is near the equinoctial, the water being for some time quite stagnant.
These, with some other odd appearances attending the same phae∣nomena,
were considered by many as inscru∣table; but Sir Isaac Newton, with
peculiar sa∣gacity, adjudged them to arise from the concur∣rence of two
tides, one from the South Sea, and the other from the Indian Ocean. Of each of
these tides there come successively two every day; two at one time
greater, and two at another <PB N="259" REF="282"/> that are less. The time
between the arrival of the two greater, is considered by him as high tide;
the time between the two lesser, as ebb. In short, with this clue, that
great mathematician solved every appearance, and so established his
theory as to silence every opposer.</P>
<P>This fluctuation of the sea from the tides, produces another, and
more constant rotation of its waters, from the east to the west, in this
re∣spect following the course of the moon. This may be considered as one
great and general current of the waters of the sea; and although it be not
every where distinguishable, it is ne∣vertheless every where existent,
except when op∣posed by some particular current or eddy, pro∣duced by
partial and local causes. This ten∣dency of the sea towards the west, is
plainly perceivable in all the great streights of the ocean; as, for
instance, in those of Magellan; where the tide running in from the east,
rises twenty feet high, and continues flowing six hours; whereas the ebb
continues but two hours, and the current is directed to the west. This proves
that the flux is not equal to the reflux; and that from both results a motion
of the sea westward, which is more powerful during the time of the flux
than the reflux.</P>
<P>But this motion westward has been sensibly 
<PB N="260" REF="283"/> observed by navigators, in their passage back from
India to Madagascar, and so on to Africa. In the great Pacific Ocean
also, it is very per∣ceivable: but the places where it is most ob∣vious
are, as was said, in those streights which join one ocean to another. In
the streights be∣tween the Maldivia islands, in the gulph of Mexico,
between Cuba and Jucatan. In the streights of the gulph of Paria, the motion
is so violent that it hath received the appellation of the Dragon's Mouth.
Northward, in the sea of Canada, in Waigat's streights, in the streights
of Java, and, in short, in every streight where the ocean on one part pours
into the ocean on the other. In this manner, therefore, is the sea carried
with an unceasing circulation round the globe; and, at the same time that
its waters are pushed back and forward with the tide, they have thus a
progressive current to the west, which, though less observable, is
not the less real.</P>
<P>Besides these two general motions of the sea, there are others
which are particular to many parts of it, and are called currents. These are
found to run in all directions, east, west, north, and south; being
formed, as was said above, by various causes; the prominence of the
shores, the narrowness of the streigths, the variations of 
<PB N="261" REF="284"/> the wind, and the inequalities at the bottom. These,
though no great object to the philoso∣pher, as their causes are generally
local and ob∣vious, are nevertheless of the most material con∣sequence to
the mariner; and, without a know∣ledge of which, he could never succeed. It
often has happened, that when a ship has un∣knowingly got into one of
these, every thing seems to go forward with success, the mariners
suppose themselves every hour approaching their wish'd-for port, the
wind fills their sails, and the ship's prow seems to divide the water;
but, at last, by miserable experience they find, that instead of going
forward, they have been all the time receding. The business of currents,
there∣fore, makes a considerable article in navigation; and the direction of
their stream, and their ra∣pidity, has been carefully set down. This some
do by the observation of the surface of the cur∣rent; or by the driving of
the froth along the shore; or by throwing out what is called the log-line,
with a buoy made for that purpose, and by the direction and motion of this,
they judge of the setting, and the rapidity of the current.</P>
<P>These currents are generally found to be most violent under the
equator, where indeed all the motions of the ocean are most perceivable. 
<PB N="262" REF="285"/> Along the coasts of Guinea, if a ship happens to
overshoot the mouth of any river it is bound to, the current prevents its
return; so that it is obliged to steer out to sea, and take a very large
compass, in order to correct the former mistake. These set in a
contrary direction to the general motion of the sea westward; and that so
strong∣ly, that a passage which with the current is gone in two days, is
with difficulty performed in six weeks against it. However, they do not
extend above twenty leagues from the coast; and ships going to the
East-Indies, take care not to come within the sphere of their action. At
Sumatra, the currents, which are extremely rapid, run from south to north:
there are also strong cur∣rents between Madagascar and the Cape of Good
Hope. On the western coasts of Ame∣rica, the current always runs from the
south to the north, where a south wind, continually blowing, most
probably occasions this phaeno∣mena. But the currents that are most
remark∣able, are those continually flowing into the Me∣diterranean sea,
both from the ocean by the streights of Gibraltar, and at its other
ex∣tremity, from the Euxine sea by the Archipe∣lago. This is one of the
most extraordinary appearances in nature, this large sea receiving not only
the numerous rivers that fall into it, <PB N="263" REF="286"/> such as the
Nile, the Rhone, and the Po, but also a very great influx from the Euxine
sea on one part, and the ocean on the other. At the same time, it is seen
to return none of those waters it is thus known to receive: outlets run∣ning
from it there are none; no rivers but such as bring it fresh supplies; no
streights but what are constantly pouring their waters into it: it has
therefore been the wonder of mankind in every age, how, and by what means this
vast concourse of waters are disposed of; or how this sea, which is
always receiving, and never re∣turning, is no way fuller than before. In order
to account for this, some have said, that the water was re-conveyed by
subterraneous passages into the Red Sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE>. There is a
story told of an Arabian califf, who caught a dolphin in this sea,
admir∣ing the beauty of which, he let it go again, hav∣ing previously marked
it by a ring of iron. Some time after a dolphin was caught in the Red Sea, and
quickly known by the ring to be the same that had been taken in the
Mediterranean be∣fore. Such, however, as have not been willing to found their
opinions upon a story, have at∣tempted to account for the disposal of the
waters of the Mediterranean by evaporation. For this purpose they have
entered into long calculations <PB N="264" REF="287"/> upon the extent of its
surface, and the quantity of water that would be raised from such a
sur∣face in a year. They then compute how much water runs in by its rivers
and streights in that time; and find, that the quantity exhausted by
evaporation, greatly exceeds the quantity sup∣plied by rivers and seas. And
this solution, no doubt would be satisfactory, did not the ocean, and the
Euxine, evaporate as well as the Mediterranean: and as these are subject to
the same drain, it must follow, that all the seas will in this respect
be upon a par; and, there∣fore, there must be some other cause for this
unperceived drain, and continual supply. This seems to be satisfactorily
enough accounted for by Doctor Smith, who supposes an under current running
through the streights of Gi∣braltar to carry out as much water into the
ocean, as the upper current continually carries in from it. To confirm this, he
observes, that nearer home, between the north and south foreland, the tide
is known to run one way at top, and the ebb another way at bottom. This double
cur∣rent he also confirms by an experiment commu∣nicated to him by an able
seaman, who being with one of the king's frigates in the Baltic, found he
went with his boat into the mid-stream, and was carried violently by the
current; upon which a basket was sunk, with a large cannon∣ball, 
<PB N="265" REF="288"/> to a certain depth of water, which gave a check to the
boat's motion; as the basket sunk still lower, the boat was driven, by
the force of the water below, against the upper current; and the lower the
basket was let down, the stronger the under current was found, and the
quicker was the boat's motion against the upper stream, which seemed not
to be above four fathom deep. From hence we may readily infer, that the same
cause may operate at the streights of Gibraltar; and that while the
Mediterranean seems replenishing at top, it may be emptying at bottom.</P>
<P>The number of the currents at sea are im∣possible to be
recounted, nor indeed are they always known; new ones are daily produced by a
variety of causes, and as quickly disappear. When a regular current is
opposed by another in a narrow streight, or where the bottom of the sea
is very uneven, a whirlpool is often formed. These were formerly considered
as the most formidable obstructions to navigation, and the ancient poets
and historians speak of them with terror; they are described as
swallowing up ships, and dashing them against the rocks at the bottom:
apprehension did not fail to add ima∣ginary terrors to the description, and
placed at the center of the whirlpool a dreadful den, <PB N="266" REF="289"/>
fraught with monsters whose howlings served to add new horrors to the
dashings of the deep. Mankind at present, however, view these eddies of
the sea with very little apprehension; and some have wondered how the
ancients could have so much overcharged their descriptions. But all this is
very naturally accounted for. In those times when navigation was as yet but
be∣ginning, and the slightest concussion of the waves generally sent
the poor adventurer to the bottom, it is not to be wondered at that he was
terrified at the violent agitations in one of these. When his little ship,
but ill fitted for opposing the fury of the sea, was got within the vortex,
there was then no possibility of ever returning. To add to the fatality,
they were always near the shore; and along the shore was the only place
where this ill provided mariner durst ven∣ture to sail. These were,
therefore, dreadful im∣pediments to his navigation; for if he attempted to
pass between them and the shore, he was sometimes sucked in by the
eddy; and if he at∣tempted to avoid them out at sea, he was often sunk by
the storm. But in our time, and in our present improved state of
navigation, Charyb∣dis, and the Euripus, with all the other irre∣gular currents
of the Mediterranean, are no longer formidable. Mr. Addison not attending 
<PB N="267" REF="290"/> to this train of thinking, upon passing through the
streights of Sicily, was surprised at the little there was of terror in
the present appearance of Sylla and Charybdis; and seems to be of opi∣nion,
that their agitations are much diminished since the times of antiquity. In
fact, from the reasons above, all the wonders of the Mediter∣ranean sea are
described in much higher colours than they merit, to us who are acquainted
with the more magnificent terrors of the ocean. The Mediterranean is one of the
smoothest and most gentle seas in the world; its tides are scarce
per∣ceivable, except in the gulph of Venice, and shipwrecks are less known
there than in any other part of the world.</P>
<P>It is in the ocean, therefore, that these whirl∣pools are
particularly dangerous, where the tides are violent, and the tempests fierce.
To mention only one, that called the Maelstroom, upon the coasts of Norway,
which is considered as the most dreadful and voracious in the world. The
name it has received from the natives, sig∣nifies the navel of the sea,
since they suppose that a great share of the water of the sea is
sucked up and discharged by its vortex. A minute de∣scription of the
internal parts is not to be ex∣pected, since none who were there ever
re∣turned to bring back information. The body <PB N="268" REF="291"/> of the
waters that form this whirlpool, are ex∣tended in a circle above thirteen miles
in cir∣cumference<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol. i. p.
156.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the midst of this stands a rock, against which the
tide in its ebb is dashed with inconceivable fury. At this time it
in∣stantly swallows up all things that come within the sphere of its
violence, trees, timber, and shipping. No skill in the mariner, nor
strength of rowing, can work an escape: the sailor at the helm finds the
ship at first go in a current op∣posite to his intentions; his
vessel's motion, tho' slow in the beginning, becomes every moment more
rapid; it goes round in circles still narrower and narrower, till at last
it is dashed against the rocks, and instantly disappears: nor is it
seen again for six hours: till the tide flowing, it is vomited forth with
the same violence with which it was drawn in. The noise of this dreadful
vortex still farther contributes to en∣crease its terror, which with the
dashing of the waters, and the dreadful valley, if it may be so called,
caused by their circulation, makes one of the most tremendous objects in
nature.</P>

<PB N="269" REF="292"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of the Changes produced by the Sea upon the
Earth.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what has been said, as well of the earth as of the sea,
they both appear to be in continual fluctuation. The earth, the common
promptuary that supplies subsistence to men, animals, and vegetables,
is continually furnish∣ing its stores to their support. But the matter
which is thus derived from it, is soon restored and laid down again to be
prepared for fresh mu∣tations. The transmigration of souls is no doubt
false and whimsical; but nothing can be more certain than the
transmigration of bodies: the spoils of the meanest reptile may go to the
for∣mation of a prince; and, on the contrary, as the poet has it, the body of
Caesar may be em∣ployed in stopping a beer barrel. From this, and other
causes, therefore, the earth is in con∣tinual change. Its internal fires, the
deviation of its rivers, and the falling of its mountains, are daily altering
its surface; and geography can scarce recollect the lakes and the vallies
that history once described.</P>
<P>But these changes are nothing to the insta∣bility 
<PB N="270" REF="293"/> of the ocean. It would seem that inqui∣etude was as
natural to it as its fluidity. It is first seen with a constant and
equable motion going towards the west; the tides then interrupt this
progression, and for a time drive the waters in a contrary direction;
beside these agitations, the currents act their part in a smaller
sphere, being generally greatest where the other motions of the sea are
least; namely, nearest the shore: the winds also contribute their
share in this uni∣versal fluctuation; so that scarce any part of the
sea is wholly seen to stagnate.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Nil enim quiescit, undis impellitur unda,</L> 
<L>Et spiritus et calor toto se corpore miscent.</L></Q>
<P>As this great element is thus changed, and continually labouring
internally, it may be rea∣dily supposed that it produces correspondent
changes upon its shores, and those parts of the earth subject to its
influence. In fact, it is every day making considerable alterations, either
by overflowing its shores in one place, or de∣serting them in others; by
covering over whole tracts of country, that were cultivated and peo∣pled, at
one time; or by leaving its bed to be ap∣propriated to the purposes of
vegetation, and to supply a new theatre for human industry at another.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="294"/>In this struggle between the earth and the
sea for dominion, the greatest number of our shores seem to defy the
whole rage of the waves, both by their height, and the rocky materials of which
they are composed. The coasts of Italy, for instance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 199.</BIBL></NOTE>, are bordered with
rocks of mar∣ble of different kinds, the quarries of which may easily be
distinguished at a distance from sea, and appear like perpendicular
columns, of the most beautiful kinds of marble, ranged along the shore. In
general, the coasts of France, from Brest to Bourdeaux, are composed of
rocks; as are also those of Spain and England, which defend the land, and
only are interrupted here and there to give an egress to rivers, and to grant
the conveniences of bays and harbours to our shipping. It may be in general
re∣marked, that wherever the sea is most violent and furious, there the
boldest shores, and of the most compact materials, are found to oppose
it. There are many shores several hundred feet perpendicular, against
which the sea, when swollen with tides or storms, rises and beats with
inconceivable fury. In 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Idem, vol. ii. p.
191.</BIBL></NOTE> the Ork∣neys, where the shores are thus formed, it
some∣times, when agitated by a storm, rises two hun∣dred feet
perpendicular, and dashes up its spray, <PB N="272" REF="295"/> together
with sand, and other substances that compose its bottom, upon land,
like showers of rain.</P>
<P>From hence, therefore, we may conceive how the violence of the
sea, and the boldness of the shore, may be said to have made each
other. Where the sea meets no obstacles, it spreads its waters with a
gentle intumescence, till all its power is destroyed, by its wanting depth
to aid its motion. But when its progress is checked in the midst, by the
prominence of rocks, or the abrupt elevation of the land, it dashes with all
the force of its depth against the obstacle, and forms, by its repeated
violence, that abruptness of the shore which confines its impetuosity.
Where the sea is extremely deep, or very much vexed by tempests, it is no
small obstacle that can confine its rage; and for this reason we see
the boldest shores projected against the deepest waters; all less
impediments having long before been sur∣mounted and washed away. Perhaps of
all the shores in the world, there is not one so high as that to the west
of St. Kilda, which, upon a late admeasurement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Description of St. Kilda.</BIBL></NOTE>, was found to be
six hun∣dred fathom perpendicular above the surface of the sea. Here
also, the sea is deep, turbulent, <PB N="273" REF="296"/> and stormy; so
that it requires great force in the shore to oppose its violence. In many
parts of the world, and particularly upon the coasts of the East Indies,
the shores, though not high above water, are generally very deep, and
con∣sequently the waves roll against land with great weight and
irregularity. This rising of the waves against the shore, is called by
mariners, the surf of the sea; and in shipwrecks is generally fatal to
such as attempt to swim on shore. In this case, no dexterity in the
swimmer, no float he can use, neither swimming girdle nor cork jacket
will save him; the weight of the superincumbent wave breaks upon him at
once, and crushes him with certain ruin. Some few of the natives, however,
have the art of swimming and of navigating their little boats near those
shores, where an European is sure of instant de∣struction.</P>
<P>In places where the force of the sea is less violent, or its
tides less rapid, the shores are ge∣nerally seen to descend with a more
gradual declivity. Over these, the waters of the tide steal by almost
imperceptible degrees, covering them for a large extent, and leaving them bare
on its recess. Upon these shores, as was said, the sea seldom beats
with any great violence, as a large wave has not depth sufficient to float it
<PB N="274" REF="297"/> onwards, so that here only are to be seen gentle
surges making calmly towards land, and lessen∣ing as they approach. As
the sea, in the for∣mer description, is generally seen to present
prospects of tumult, and uproar, here it more usually exhibits a scene of
repose and tranquil beauty. Its waters, which when surveyed from the
precipice, afforded a muddy greenish hue, arising from their depth and
position to the eye<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Newton's Optics, p.
163-167.</BIBL></NOTE>, when regarded from a shelving shore, wear the
colour of the sky, and seem rising to meet it. The deafening noise of
the deep sea, is here converted into gentle murmurs; instead of the water's
dashing against the face of the rock, it advances and recedes, still
going for∣ward, but with just force enough to push its weeds and shells,
by insensible approaches, to the shore.</P>
<P>There are still other shores, beside those al∣ready
described, which either have been raised by art to oppose the sea's
approaches, or from the sea's gaining ground, are threatened with imminent
destruction. The sea's being thus seen to give and take away lands at
pleasure, is, without question, one of the most extraordinary
considerations in all natural history. In some places it is seen to
obtain the superiority by slow and certain approaches; or to burst in at
once, <PB N="275" REF="298"/> and overwhelm all things in undistinguished
destruction; in other places it departs from its shores, and where its
waters have been known to rage, it leaves fields covered with the most
beautiful verdure.</P>
<P>The formation of new lands by the sea's con∣tinually bringing its
sediment to one place, and by the accumulation of its sands in another, is
easily conceived. We have had many instances of this in England. The
island of Oxney, which is adjacent to Romney-marsh, was produced in this
manner. This had for a long time been a low level, continually in danger of
being overflown by the river Rother; but the sea, by its depo∣sitions, has
gradually raised the bottom of the river, while it has hollowed the mouth;
so that the one is sufficiently secured from inundations, and the other
is deep enough to admit ships of considerable burthen. The like also may
be seen at that bank called the Dogger-sands, where two tides meet, and
which thus receive new increase every day, so that in time the place
seems to pro∣mise fair for being habitable earth. On many parts of the
coasts of France, England, Holland, Germany, and Prussia, the sea has
been sensibly known to retire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
vi. p. 424.</BIBL></NOTE>. Hubert Thomas asserts, in his Description of
the Country of Liege, that the <PB N="276" REF="299"/> sea formerly
encompassed the city of Tongres, which, however, is at present
thirty-five leagues distant from it: this assertion he supports by many
strong reasons; and among others, by the iron rings fixed in the walls of
the town, for fastening the ships that came into the port. In Italy there
is a considerable piece of ground gained at the mouth of the river Arno; and
Ra∣venna, that once stood by the sea-side is now considerably removed
from the same. But we need scarce mention these, when we find that the
whole kingdom of Holland seems to be a conquest upon the sea, and in a
manner res∣cued from its bosom. The surface of the earth, in this
country, is below the level of the bed of the sea; and I remember, upon
approaching the coast, to have looked down upon it from the sea, as into a
valley; however, it is every day rising higher by the depositions made upon
it, both by the sea, the Rhine, and the Meuse; and those parts which
formerly admitted large men of war, are now known to be too shallow to
receive ships of very moderate burthen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon,
vol. vi. p. 424.</BIBL></NOTE>. The province of Jucatan, a peninsula in the
gulph of Mexico, was formerly a part of the sea: this tract, which
stretches out into the ocean an hundred leagues, and which is above thirty 
<PB N="277" REF="300"/> broad, is every where, at a moderate depth below the
surface, composed of shells, which evince that its land once formed the
bed of the sea. In France, the town of Aigues Mortes was a port in the times
of St. Louis, which is now removed more than four miles from the sea.
Psalmodi, in the same kingdom, was an island in the year 815, but is now
more than six miles from the shore. All along the coasts of Norfolk, I am
very well assured, that in the me∣mory of man, the sea has gained fifty
yards in some places, and has lost as much in others.</P>
<P>Thus numerous, therefore, are the instances of new lands having
been produced from the sea, which, as we see, is brought about two
dif∣ferent ways: first, by the waters raising banks of sand and mud where
their sediment is deposited; and secondly, by their relinquishing the
shore entirely, and leaving it unoccupied to the indu∣stry of man.</P>
<P>But as the sea has been thus known to recede from some lands,
so has it, by fatal experience, been found to encroach upon others: and,
pro∣bably, these depredations on one part of the shore, may account for
their dereliction from another; for the current which rested upon some
certain bank, having got an egress in some other place, it no longer
presses upon its former bed, <PB N="278" REF="301"/> but pours all its
stream into the new entrance, so that every inundation of the sea may be
at∣tended with some correspondent dereliction of another shore.</P>
<P>However this be, we have numerous histories of the sea's
inundations, and its burying whole provinces in its bosom. Many countries
that have been thus destroyed, still bear melancholy witness to the truth
of history; and shew the tops of their houses, and the spires of their
steeples, still standing at the bottom of the water. One of the most
considerable inundations we have in history, is that which happened in the
reign of Henry I. which overflowed the estates of the Earl Godwin, and forms
now that bank called the Goodwin sands. In the year 1546, a similar
irruption of the sea destroyed an hun∣dred thousand persons in the
territory of Dort; and yet a greater number round Dullart. In Friezland, and
Zealand, there were more than three hundred villages overwhelmed; and their
remains continue still visible at the bottom of the water in a clear day.
The Baltic sea has, by slow degrees, covered a large part of Pome∣rania;
and, among others, destroyed and over∣whelmed the famous port of Vineta. In
the same manner, the Norwegian sea has formed several little islands
from the main land, and still <PB N="279" REF="302"/> daily advances upon the
continent. The Ger∣man sea has advanced upon the shores of Hol∣land, near
Catt, so that the ruins of an ancient citadel of the Romans, which was
formerly built upon this coast, are now actually under water. To these
accidents several more might be added; our own historians, and those of
other countries, abound with them; almost every flat shore of any extent,
being able to shew something that it has lost, or something that it has
gained from the sea.</P>
<P>There are some shores on which the sea has made temporary
depredations; where it has overflowed, and after remaining perhaps some ages,
it has again retired of its own accord, or been driven back by the industry
of man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 425.</BIBL></NOTE>.
There are many lands in Norway, Scotland, and the Maldivia islands, that are
at one time co∣vered with water, and at another free. The country round the
Isle of Ely, in the times of Bede, about a thousand years ago, was one of
the most delightful spots in the whole kingdom. It was not only richly
cultivated, and produced all the necessaries of life, but grapes also
that afforded the most excellent wine. The accounts of that time are copious
in the description of its verdure and fertility; its rich pastures, covered
<PB N="280" REF="303"/> with flowers and herbage; its beautiful shades, and
wholsome air. But the sea breaking in, upon the land, overwhelmed the whole
country, took possession of the soil, and totally destroyed one of
the most beautiful vallies in the world. Its air, from being dry and
healthful, from that time became most unwholsome, and clogged with vapours;
and the small part of the country that, by being higher than the rest,
escaped the deluge, was soon rendered uninhabitable, from its noxious
vapours. Thus this country conti∣nued under water for some centuries; till,
at last, the sea, by the same caprice which had prompted its invasions,
began to abandon the the earth in like manner. It has continued for some ages
to relinquish its former conquests; and although the inhabitants can
neither boast the longevity, nor the luxuries of their former pre-occupants,
yet they find ample means of subsistence; and if they happen to survive
the first years of their residence there, they are often known to arrive at
a good old age.</P>
<P>But although history be silent as to many other inundations of
the like kind, where the sea has overflowed the country, and afterwards
retired, yet we have numberless testimonies of another nature, that prove
it beyond the possi∣bility of doubt: I mean those numerous trees that are
found buried at considerable depths <PB N="281" REF="304"/> in places where
either rivers, or the sea, has accidentally overflown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 403.</BIBL></NOTE>. At the mouth of the
river Ness, near Bruges, in Flanders, at the depth of fifty feet, are found
great quantities of trees lying as close to each other as they do in a wood:
the trunks, the branches, and the leaves, are in such perfect preservation,
that the particular kind of each tree may instantly be known. About five
hundred years ago, this very ground was known to have been covered with the
sea; nor is there any history or tradition of its having been dry ground,
which we can have no doubt must have been the case. Thus we see a country
flourishing in verdure, pro∣ducing large forests, and trees of various
kinds, overwhelmed by the sea. We see this element depositing its
sediment to an heighth of fifty feet; and its waters must, therefore, have
risen much higher. We see the same, after it has thus overwhelmed, and
sunk the land so deep beneath its slime, capriciously retiring from the
same coasts, and leaving that habi∣table once more, which it had formerly
de∣stroyed. All this is wonderful; and perhaps, instead of attempting to
enquire after the cause, which has hitherto been inscrutable, it will
best become us to rest satisfied with ad∣miration.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="305"/>At the city of Modena in Italy, and about four
miles round it, wherever it is dug, when the workmen arrive at the depth of
sixty-three feet, they come to a bed of chalk, which they bore with an augre
five feet deep: they then withdraw from the pit, before the augre is re∣moved,
and upon its extraction, the water bursts up through the aperture with great
violence, and quickly fills this new made well, which continues full, and is
affected neither by rains nor droughts. But that which is most remarkable in
this operation, is the layers of earth as we descend. At the depth of
fourteen feet, are found the ruins of an ancient city, paved streets,
houses, floors, and different pieces of Mosaic. Under this is found a
solid earth, that would induce one to think had never been removed; however,
under it is found a soft oozy earth, made up of vegetables; and at
twenty-six feet depth, large trees entire, such as walnut-trees, with the
walnuts still sticking on the stem, and their leaves and branches in
exact preservation. At twenty-eight feet deep, a soft chalk is found, mixed
with a vast quantity of shells; and this bed is eleven feet thick. Under
this, vegeta∣bles are found again, with leaves, and branches of trees as
before; and thus alternately chalk and vegetable earth to the depth of
sixty-three <PB N="283" REF="306"/> feet. These are the layers wherever the
work∣men attempt to bore; while in many of them, they also find pieces of
charcoal, bones, and bits of iron. From this description, therefore, it
appears, that this country has been alternately overflowed and deserted by
the sea, one age after another: nor were these overflowings and retir∣ings
of trifling depth, or of short continuance. When the sea burst in, it
must have been a long time in overwhelming the branches of the fallen
forest with its sediment; and still longer in form∣ing a regular bed of
shells eleven feet over them. It must have, therefore, taken an age, at
least, to make any one of these layers; and we may conclude, that it must
have been many ages employed in the production of them all. The land also,
upon being deserted, must have had time to grow compact, to gather fresh
fertility, and to be drained of its waters before it could be disposed to
vegetation; or before its trees could have shot forth again to maturity.</P>
<P>We have instances nearer home of the same kind, given us in the
Philosophical Transactions; one of them by Mr. Derham. An inundation of the
sea, at Dagenham, in Essex, laying bare a part of the adjacent pasture,
for above two hundred feet wide, and, in some places, twenty deep, it
discovered a number of trees that had <PB N="284" REF="307"/> lain there for
many ages before; these trees, by lying long under ground, were become black
and hard, and their fibres so tough, that one might as easily break a wire,
as any of them: they lay so thick in the place where they were found, that in
many parts he could step from one to another: he conceived also, that not
only all the adjacent marshes, for several hundred acres, were covered
underneath with such tim∣ber, but also the marshes along the mouth of the
Thames, for several miles. The meeting with these trees at such depths,
he ascribes to the se∣diment of the river, and the tides, which
con∣stantly washing over them, have always left some part of their
substance behind, so as, by repeated alluvions, to work a bed of
vegetable earth over them, to the height at which he found it.</P>
<P>The levels of Hatfield-Chace, in Yorkshire, a tract of above
eighteen thousand acres, which was yearly overflown, was reduced to arable
and pasture-land, by one Sir Cornelius Ver∣musden, a Dutchman. At the
bottom of this wide extent, are found millions of the roots and bodies of
trees, of such as this island either formerly did, or does at present
produce. The roots of all stand in their proper postures; and by them, as
thick as ever they could <PB N="285" REF="308"/> grow, the respective trunks
of each, some above thirty yards long. The oaks, some of which have been
sold for fifteen pounds a piece, are as black as ebony, very lasting, and
close grained. The ash-trees are as soft as earth, and are commonly cut
in pieces by the workmen's spades, and as soon as flung up into the open
air, turn to dust. But all the rest, even the willows themselves, which
are softer than the ash, preserve their substance and texture to this
very day. Some of the firs appear to have ve∣getated, even after they were
fallen, and to have, from their branches, struck up large trees, as great as
the parent trunk. It is observable, that many of these trees have been
burnt, some quite through, some on one side, some have been found
chopped and squared, others riven with great wooden wedges, all
sufficiently ma∣nifesting, that the country which was deluged, had formerly
been inhabited. Near a great root of one tree, were found eight coins of the
Roman emperors; and, in some places, the marks of the ridge and furrow were
plainly perceivable, which testified that the ground had formerly been
patient of cultivation.</P>
<P>The learned naturalist who has given this description<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. iv. part ii. p. 214.</BIBL></NOTE>, has
pretty plainly evinced, that <PB N="286" REF="309"/> this forest, in
particular, must have been thus levelled by the Romans; and that the falling
of the trees, must have contributed to the ac∣cumulation of the waters. 
<Q REND="inline">"The Romans," says he, "when the Britons fled,
always pursued them into the fortresses of low woods, and miry forests:
in these, the wild natives found shelter; and, when opportunity offered,
issued out, and fell upon their invaders without mercy. In this manner, the
Romans were at length so har∣rassed, that orders were issued out for
cutting down all the woods and forests in Britain. In order to effect this,
and destroy the enemy the easier, they set fire to the woods, composed
of pines, and other inflamable timber, which spreading, the conflagration
destroyed not only the forest, but infinite numbers of the wretched
inhabitants who had taken shelter therein: When the pine-trees had thus done
what mis∣chief they could, the Romans then brought their army nearer, and,
with whole legions of the captive Britons, cut down most of the trees that
were yet left standing; leaving only here and there some great trees
untouched, as monuments of their fury. These, unneedful of their labour,
being destitute of the support of the underwood, and of their neighbouring
trees, were easily overthrown by the winds, and, without inter∣ruption, 
<PB N="287" REF="310"/> remained on the places where they happened to fall. The
forest, thus fallen, must necessarily have stopped up the currents,
both from land and sea; and turned into great lakes, what were before but
temporary streams. The working of the waters here, the consumption and
decay of rotten boughs and branches, and the vast encrease of water-moss
which flourishes upon marshy grounds, soon formed a covering over the
trunks of the fallen trees, and raised the earth several feet above its
former level. The earth thus every day swelling, by a conti∣nual encrease
from the sediment of the waters, and by the lightness of the vegetable
substances of which it was composed, soon overtopt the waters by which
this intumescence was at first effected; so that it entirely got rid of
its inun∣dations, or only demanded a slight assistance from man for
that purpose."</Q> And this may be the origin of all bogs whatsoever, which
are formed by the putrefaction of vegetable sub∣stances, mixed with the mud
and slime depo∣sited by waters, and at length acquiring a suf∣ficient
consistency.</P>
<P>From this we see what powerful effects the sea is capable of
producing upon its shores, either by overflowing some, or deserting
others; by <PB N="288" REF="311"/> altering the direction of these, and
rendering those craggy and precipitate, which before were shelving. But the
influence it has upon these, is nothing to that which it has upon that great
body of earth which forms its bottom. It is at the bottom of the sea that the
greatest wonders are performed, and the most rapid changes are produced; it
is there that the motion of the tides and the currents have their whole force,
and agitate the substances of which their bed is com∣posed. But all
these are almost wholly hid from human curiosity: the miracles of the
deep are performed in secret; and we have but little information from its
abysses, except what we receive by inspection at very shallow depths,
or by the plummet, or from divers, who are known to descend from twenty to
thirty fathom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. iv. part ii. p.
192.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The eye can reach but a very short way into the depths of the
sea; and that only when its surface is glassy and serene. In many
seas it perceives nothing but a bright sandy plain at bottom, extending for
several hundred miles, without an intervening object. But in others,
particularly in the Red Sea, it is very different: the whole bottom of this
extensive bed of waters is, literally speaking, a forest of sub∣marine 
<PB N="289" REF="312"/> plants, and corals formed by insects for their
habitation, sometimes branching out to a great extent. Here are seen the
madrepores, the sponges, mosses, sea mushrooms, and other marine
productions, covering every part of the bottom; so that some have even
supposed the sea to have taken its name from the colour of its plants
below. However, these plants are by no means peculiar to this sea, as they
are found in great quantities in the Persian gulph, along the coasts of
Africa, and those of Provence and Catalonia.</P>
<P>The bottom of many parts of the sea near America, presents a
very different, though a very beautiful appearance. This is covered with
vegetables, which make it look as green as a meadow, and beneath are seen
thousands of tur∣tles, and other sea animals, feeding thereon.</P>
<P>In order to extend our knowledge of the sea to greater depths,
recourse has been had to the plummet; which is generally made of a lump of
lead of about forty pounds weight, fastened to a cord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 5.</BIBL></NOTE>. This, however, only
answers in mo∣derate depths; for when a deep sea is to be sounded, the
matter of which the cord is com∣posed, being lighter than the water, floats
upon <PB N="290" REF="313"/> it, and when let down to a considerable depth,
its length so encreases its surface, that it is often sufficient to
prevent the lead from sinking; so that this may be the reason that some
parts of the sea are said to have no bottom.</P>
<P>In general, we learn from the plummet, that the bottom of the sea
is tolerably even where it has been examined; and that the farther from the
shore, the sea is in general the deeper. Not∣withstanding, now and then,
in the midst of a great and unfathomable ocean, we often find an island
raising its head, and singly braving its fury. Such islands may be
considered as the mountains of the deep; and, could we for a moment imagine
the waters of the ocean re∣moved, or dried away, we should probably find the
inequalities of its bed resembling those that are found at land. Here
extensive plains; there valleys; and, in many places, mountains of amazing
height. M. Buache has actually given us a map of that part of its bottom, which
lies between Africa and America, taken from the several soundings of
mariners: in it we find the same uneven surface that we do upon land, the
same eminences, and the same de∣pressions. In such an imaginary
prospect, how∣ever, there would be this difference, that as the tops of land
mountains appear the most barren <PB N="291" REF="314"/> and rocky, the tops
of sea-mountains would be found the most verdant and fruitful.</P>
<P>The plummet, which thus gives us some idea of the inequalities of
the bottom, leaves us to∣tally in the dark as to every other particular;
recourse, therefore, has been had to divers: these, either being bred up in
this dangerous way of life, and accustomed to remain some time under water
without breathing, or assisted by means of a diving-bell, have been able
to return some confused and uncertain accounts of the places below. In the
great diving-bell improved by Doctor Halley, which was large enough to con∣tain
five men, and was supplied with fresh air by buckets, that alternately
rose and fell, they descended fifty fathom. In this huge machine, which was
let down from the mast of the ship, the doctor himself went down to the
bottom, where, when the sea was clear, and especially when the sun
shone, he could see perfectly well to write or read, and much more to take
up any thing that was underneath: at other times, when the water was troubled
and thick, it was as dark as night below, so that he was obliged to keep a
candle lighted at the bottom. But there is one thing very remarkable, which is,
that the water which from above was usually seen of a green colour, when
looked at from below, ap∣peared <PB N="292" REF="315"/> to him of a very
different one, casting a redness upon one of his hands, like that of
da∣mask roses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Newton's Optic, p.
56.</BIBL></NOTE>.—A proof of the sea's taking its colour not from any
thing floating in it, but from the different reflexions of the rays of light.
Upon the whole, the accounts we have received from the bottom, by this
contrivance, are but few. We learn from it, and from divers in general, that
while the surface of the sea may be de∣formed by tempests, it is
usually calm and tem∣perate below<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle,
vol. iii. p. 242.</BIBL></NOTE>; that some divers who have gone down when the
weather was calm, and came up when it was tempestuous, were surprized at
their not perceiving the change at the bottom. This, however, must not be
supposed to obtain with regard to the tides, and the cur∣rents, as they are
seen constantly shifting their bottom; taking their bed with great
violence from one place, and depositing it upon ano∣ther. We are informed,
also, by divers, that the sea grows colder in proportion as they descend
to the bottom; that as far as the sun's rays pierce, it is influenced by
their warmth; but lower, the cold becomes almost intolerable. A person of
quality, who had been himself a diver, as Mr. Boyle informs us, declared,
that though he seldom descended above three or four <PB N="293" REF="316"/>
fathoms, yet he found it so much colder than near the top, that he could not
well endure it; and that being let down in a great diving-bell, although the
water could not immediately touch him, he found the air extremely cold upon his
first arrival at the bottom.</P>
<P>From divers also we learn, that the sea in many places is filled
with rocks at bottom; and that among their clifts, and upon their sides,
various substances sprout forward, which are either really vegetables, or
the nests of insects, encreased to some magnitude. Some of these
as∣sume the shape of beautiful flowers; and, tho' soft, when taken up,
soon harden, and are kept in the cabinets of the curious.</P>
<P>But, of all those divers who have brought us information from the
bottom of the deep, the famous Nicola Pesce, whose performances are told us
by Kircher, is the most celebrated. I will not so much as pretend to vouch
for the veracity of Kircher's account, which he assures us he had from the
archives of the kings of Sicily; but it may serve to enliven an heavy
chapter. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the times of Frederic, king of Sicily, there
lived a celebrated diver, whose name was Nicolas, and who, from his amazing
skill in swimming, and his perse∣verance under water, was surnamed the
fish. <PB N="294" REF="317"/> This man had, from his infancy, been used to
the sea; and earned his scanty subsistence by diving for corals, and
oysters; which he sold to the villages on shore. His long acquaint∣ance
with the sea, at last, brought it to be almost his natural element. He
frequently was known to spend five days in the midst of the waves, without
any other provisions than the fish which he caught there, and ate raw. He
often swam over from Sicily into Calabria, a tempestuous and dangerous
passage, car∣rying letters from the king. He was fre∣quently known to
swim among the gulphs of the Lipari islands, no way apprehensive of
danger. 
<P>"Some mariners out at sea one day observed something at
some distance from them, which they regarded as a sea-monster; but upon
its approach, it was known to be Nicolas, whom they took into their ship.
When they asked him whither he was going in so stormy and rough a sea,
and at such a distance from land, he shewed them a packet of letters,
which he was carrying to one of the towns of Italy, ex∣actly done up in a
leather bag, in such a man∣ner as that they could not be wetted by the sea.
He kept them thus company for some time on their voyage, conversing, and
asking questions; <PB N="295" REF="318"/> and after eating an hearty meal
with them, he took his leave, and jumping into the sea, pur∣sued his voyage
alone.</P> 
<P>"In order to aid these powers of enduring in the deep, nature
seemed to have assisted him in a very extraordinary manner; for the
spaces between his fingers and toes were webbed, as in a goose; and his
chest became so very capa∣cious, that he could take in at one
inspiration, as much breath as would serve him for an whole day.</P> 
<P>"The account of so extraordinary a person did not fail to
reach the king himself; who, actuated by the general curiosity, ordered
that Nicolas should be brought before him. It was no easy matter to find
Nicolas, who generally spent his time in the solitudes of the deep; but at
last, however, after much searching, he was found, and brought before his
majesty. The curiosity of this monarch had been long excited by the
accounts he had heard of the bottom of the gulph of Charybdis; he now,
therefore, con∣ceived that it would be a proper opportunity to have more
certain information. He therefore commanded our poor diver to examine the
bot∣tom of this dreadful whirlpool; and, as an in∣citement to his obedience,
ordered a golden <PB N="296" REF="319"/> cup to be flung into it. Nicolas was
not insensible of the danger to which he was ex∣posed; dangers best
known only to himself; and he therefore presumed to remonstrate: but the
hopes of the reward, the desire of pleasing the king, and the pleasure of
shewing his skill, at last prevailed. He instantly jumped into the
gulph, and was swallowed as instantly up in its bosom. He continued for
three quarters of an hour below; during which time, the king and his attendants
remained upon shore, anxious for his fate; but he at last ap∣peared,
buffeting upon the surface, holding the cup in triumph in one hand, and
making his way good among the waves with the other. It may be supposed he
was received with applause, upon his arrival on shore: the cup was made the
reward of his adventure; the king ordered him to be taken proper care of; and,
as he was somewhat fatigued and debilitated by his la∣bour, after an hearty
meal, he was put to bed, and permitted to refresh himself by
sleeping.</P> 
<P>"When his spirits were thus restored, he was again brought,
to satisfy the king's curiosity with a narrative of the wonders he had
seen; and his account was to the following effect. He would never, he said,
have obeyed the king's commands, had he been apprized of half the 
<PB N="297" REF="320"/> dangers that were before him. There were four things, he
said, that rendered the gulph dread∣ful, not only to men, but even to the
fishes themselves: first, the force of the water bursting up from the
bottom, which require great strength to resist; secondly, the
abruptness of the rocks, that on every side threatened destruction;
thirdly, the force of the whirlpool, dashing against those rocks; and
fourthly, the number and magnitude of the polypous fish, some of which
appeared as large as a man, and which every where sticking against the
rocks, pro∣jected their fibrous arms to entangle him. Being asked how he was
able so readily to find the cup that had been thrown in, he replied, that it
happened to be flung by the waves into the cavity of a rock, against which he
himself was urged in his descent. This account, however, did not satisfy
the king's curiosity: being request∣ed to venture once more into the gulph
for fur∣ther discoveries, he at first refused; but the king, desirous
of having the most exact information possible of all things to be found
in the gulph, repeated his sollicitations; and, to give them still greater
weight, produced a larger cup than the former, and added also a purse of
gold. Upon these considerations, the unfortunate Pes∣sacola once again
plunged into the whirlpool, and was never heard of more."</P></Q></P>

<PB N="298" REF="321"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. A summary Account of the Mechanical Pro∣perties of
Air.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING described the earth and the sea, we now ascend into
that fluid which surrounds them both; and which, in some measure,
sup∣ports and supplies all animated nature. As upon viewing the bottom of
the ocean from its sur∣face, we see an infinity of animals moving therein,
and seeking food; so were some superior being to regard the earth at a
proper distance, he might consider us in the same light: he might, from
his superior station, behold a num∣ber of busy little beings, immersed
in the aerial fluid, that every where surrounds them, and sedulously
employed in procuring the means of subsistence. This fluid, though too
fine for the gross perception of its inhabitants, might, to his nicer organs
of sight, be very visible; and, while he at once saw into its operations,
he might smile at the varieties of human conjecture con∣cerning it: he might
readily discern, perhaps, the height above the surface of the earth to
which this fluid atmosphere reaches: he might exactly determine that peculiar
form of its parts which gives it the spring or elasticity with which it is
endued: he might distinguish which of its <PB N="299" REF="322"/> parts were
pure incorruptible air, and which only made for a little time to assume the
ap∣pearance, so as to be quickly returned back to the element from whence it
came. But as for us, who are immersed at the bottom of this gulph, we must
be contented with a more con∣fined knowledge; and, wanting a proper point of
prospect, remain satisfied with a combination of the effects.</P>
<P>One of the first things, therefore, that our senses informs us
of, is, that although the air is too fine for our sight, it is very obvious
to our touch. Although we cannot see the wind con∣tained in a bladder, we can
very readily feel its resistance; and though the hurricane may want colour,
we often fatally experience that it does not want force. We have equal
experience of the air's spring or elasticity: the bladder, when
pressed, returns again, upon the pressure being taken away; a bottle,
when filled, often bursts, from the spring of air which is included.</P>
<P>So far the slightest experience reaches; but, by carrying
experiment a little farther, we learn, that air also is heavy: a round
glass vessel being emptied of its air, and accurately weighed, has been
found lighter than when it was weighed with the air in it. Upon computing the
superior weight of the full vessel, a cubic foot <PB N="300" REF="323"/>
of air is found to weigh something more than an ounce.</P>
<P>From this experiment, therefore, we learn, that the earth, and all
things upon its surface, are every where covered with a ponderous fluid,
which rising very high over our heads, must be proportionably heavy. For
instance, as in the sea, a man at the depth of twenty feet, sustains a
greater weight of water than a man at the depth of but ten feet; so will a
man at the bottom of a valley have a greater weight of air over him, than a man
on the top of a mountain.</P>
<P>From hence we may conclude, that we sustain a very great weight
of air; and although, like men walking at the bottom of the sea, we can∣not
feel the weight which presses equally round us, yet the pressure is not
the less real. As in morals, we seldom know the blessings that
sur∣round us till we are deprived of them, so here we do not perceive the
weight of the ambient fluid till a part of it is taken away. If, by any means,
we contrive to take away the pressure of the air from any one part of our
bodies, we are soon made sensible of the weight upon the other parts.
Thus, if we clap our hand upon the mouth of a vessel from whence the air
has been taken away, there will thus be air on one side, and none on the
other; upon which, we shall in∣stantly <PB N="301" REF="324"/> find the hand
violently sucked inwards, which is nothing more than the weight of the air
upon the back of the hand that crushes it into the space which is empty
below.</P>
<P>As by this experiment, therefore, we perceive that the air
presses with great weight upon every thing on the surface of the earth,
so by other experiments we learn the exact weight with which it presses.
First, if the air be exhausted out of any vessel, a drinking-glass
for instance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This may be done by burning a bit of
paper in the same, and then quickly turning it down upon the water.</NOTE>,
and this vessel be set with the mouth down∣wards in water, the water will
rise up into the empty space, and fill the inverted glass; for the
external air will, in this case, press up the water, where there is no
weight to resist; as, one part of a bed being pressed, makes the other
parts, that have no weight upon them, rise. In this case, therefore, as was
said, the water being pressed without, will rise in the glass; and
would continue to rise (if the empty glass were tall enough) thirty-two
feet high. In fact, there have been pipes made purposely for this
expe∣riment, of above thirty-two feet high; in which, upon being exhausted,
the water has always risen to the height of thirty-two feet: there it 
<PB N="302" REF="325"/> has always rested, and never ascended higher. From
this, therefore, we learn, that the weight of the air which presses up the
water, is equal to a pillar or column of water, which is thirty-two feet high;
as it is just able to raise such a co∣lumn, and no more. In other words,
the sur∣face of the earth is every where covered with a weight of air, which
is equivalent to a covering of thirty-two feet deep of water; or to a weight of
twenty-nine inches and an half of quicksilver, which is known to be just as
heavy as the former.</P>
<P>Thus, therefore, we see that the air at the surface of the earth
is just as heavy as thirty-two feet of water, or twenty-nine inches and an
half of quicksilver; and it is easily found, by computation, that to
raise water thirty-two feet, will require a weight of fifteen pounds upon
every square inch. Now, if we are fond of computations, we have only to
calculate how many square inches are in the surface of an or∣dinary human
body, and allowing every inch to sustain fifteen pounds, we may amaze
ourselves at the weight of air we sustain. It has been computed, and
found, that our ordinary load of air amounts to within a little of forty
thousand pounds: this is wonderful! but wondering is not the way to grow
wise.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="326"/>Notwithstanding this be our ordinary load,
and our usual supply, there are at different times very great variations.
The air is not, like water, equally heavy at all seasons; but sometimes
is lighter, and sometimes more heavy. It is some∣times more comprest, and
sometimes more elastic or springy, which produces the same effects as
an encrease of its weight. The air which at one time raises water
thirty-two feet in the tube, and quicksilver twenty-nine inches, will not at
another raise the one to thirty feet, or the other to twenty-six inches.
This makes, therefore, a very great difference in the weight we sustain;
and we are actually known, by computation, to carry at one time four thousand
pounds of air more than at another.</P>
<P>The reason of this surprizing difference in the weight of air,
is either owing to its pressure from above, or to an encrease of vapour
floating in it. Its encreased pressure is the consequence of its
spring or elasticity, which cold and heat sensibly affect, and are
continually changing.</P>
<P>This elasticity of the air is one of its most amazing
properties; and to which it should seem nothing can set bounds. A body of
air that may be contained in a nut-shell, may easily, with heat, be dilated
into a sphere of unknown dimensions. On the contrary, the air contained 
<PB N="304" REF="327"/> in an house, may be compressed into a cavity not
larger than the eye of a needle. In short, no bounds can be set to its
confinement or ex∣pansion; at least, experiment has hitherto found its
attempts indefinite. In every situation, it retains its elasticity; and the
more closely we compress it, the more strongly does it resist the
pressure. If to the encreasing the elasticity on one side by
compression, we encrease it on the other side by heat, the force of
both soon be∣comes irresistible; and a certain French phi∣losopher
supposed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Monsieur Amontons.</BIBL></NOTE>,
that air thus confined, and expanding, was sufficient for the explosion of
a world.</P>
<P>Many instruments have been formed to mea∣sure and determine
these different properties of the air; and which serve several useful
purposes. The barometer serves to measure its weight; to tell us when it
is heavier, and when lighter. It is composed of a glass tube or pipe, of
about thirty inches in length, closed up at one end; this tube is then filled
with quicksilver; this done, the maker clapping his finger upon the open end,
inverts the tube, and plunges the open end, finger and all, into a bason of
quick∣silver, and then takes his finger away: now the quicksilver in the
tube will, by its own weight, <PB N="305" REF="328"/> endeavour to descend
into that in the bason; but the external air, pressing on the surface
of the quicksilver in the bason without, and no air being in the tube at
top, the quicksilver will continue in the tube, being pressed up, as was
said, by the air, on the surface of the bason be∣low. The height at which
it is known to stand in the tube, is usually about twenty-nine inches, when
the air is heavy; but not above twenty-six, when the air is very light. Thus,
by this instrument we can, with some exactness, de∣termine the weight of
the air; and, of con∣sequence, tell before-hand the changes of the weather.
Before fine dry weather, the air is charged with a variety of vapours, which
float in it unseen, and render it extremely heavy, so that it presses
up the quicksilver; or, in other words, the barometer rises. In moist,
rainy weather, the vapours are washed down, or there is not heat sufficient
for them to rise, so that the air is then sensibly lighter, and
presses up the quicksilver with less force; or, in other words, the
barometer is seen to fall. Our constitutions seem also to correspond
with the changes of the weather-glass; they are braced, strong, and
vigorous, with a large body of air upon them; they are languid, relaxed, and
feeble, when the <PB N="306" REF="329"/> air is light, and refuses to give our
fibres their proper tone.</P>
<P>But although the barometer thus measures the weight of the air
with exactness enough for the general purposes of life, yet it is often
af∣fected with a thousand irregularities, that no ex∣actness in the
instrument can remedy, nor no theory account for. When high winds blow, the
quicksilver generally is low: it rises higher in cold weather, than in
warm; and is usually higher at morning and evening, than at mid∣day: it
generally descends lower after rain than it was before it. There are also
frequent changes in the air, without any sensible alteration in the
barometer.</P>
<P>As the barometer is thus used in predicting the changes of the
weather, so it is also serviceable in measuring the heights of
mountains, which mathematicians cannot so readily do: for, as the higher we
asccend from the surface of the earth, the air becomes lighter, so the
quicksilver in the barometer will descend in proportion. It is found to
sink at the rate of the tenth part of an inch for every ninety feet we
ascend; so that in going up a mountain, if I find the quicksilver fallen
an inch, I conclude, that I am got upon an ascent of near nine hundred feet
high. In this there has been found some variation; into a de∣tail 
<PB N="307" REF="330"/> of which, it is not the business of a natural
historian to enter.</P>
<P>In order to determine the elasticity of air, the wind gun has been
invented, which is an in∣strument variously made; but in all upon the
principle of compressing a large quantity of air into a tube, in which
there is an ivory ball, and then giving the compressed elastic air free
power to act, and drive the ball as directed. The ball thus driven, will pierce
a thick board: and will be as fatal, at small distances, as if driven with
gunpowder. I do not know whether ever the force of this instrument has been
assisted by means of heat; certain I am, that this, which could be very
easily contrived by means of phosphorus, or any other hot substance
applied to the barrel, would give such a force as I doubt whether gunpowder
itself could produce.</P>
<P>The air-pump is an instrument contrived to exhaust the air from
round a vessel adapted to that purpose, called a receiver. This method of
exhausting, is contrived in the simple instru∣ment, by a piston, like
that of a syringe, going down into the vessel, and thus pushing out its
air; which, by means of a valve, is prevented from returning into the
vessel again. But this, like all other complicated instruments, will be
better understood by a minute inspection, than <PB N="308" REF="331"/> an
hour's description: it may suffice here to ob∣serve, that by depriving
animals, and other sub∣stances, of all air, it shews us what the benefits
and effects of air are in sustaining life, or pro∣moting vegetation.</P>
<P>The digester is an instrument of still more ex∣traordinary
effects than any of the former; and sufficiently discovers the amazing
force of air, when its elasticity is augmented by fire. A com∣mon tea-kettle,
if the spout were closed up, and the lid put firmly down, would serve to
become a digester, if strong enough. But the instru∣ment used for this
purpose, is a strong metal pot, with a lid to screw close on, so
that, when down, no air can get in or return: into this pot, meat and bones are
put, with a small quantity of water, and then the lid screwed close: a
lighted lamp is put underneath, and, what is very extraordinary, (yet equally
true) in six or eight minutes the whole mass, bones and all, are
dissolved into a jelly; so great is the force and elasticity of the air
contained within; struggling to escape, and breaking in pieces all the
sub∣stances with which it is mixed. Care, however, must be taken not to
heat this instrument too violently; for then, the inclosed air would
be∣come irresistible, and burst the whole, with per∣haps a fatal
explosion.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="332"/>There are numberless other useful
instru∣ments made to depend on the weight, the elasticity, or the fluidity
of the air, which do not come within the plan of the present work; the
design of which is not to give an account of the inventions that have been
made for deter∣mining the nature and properties of air, but a mere narrative of
its effects. The description of the pump, the forcing pump, the fire engine,
the steam engine, the syphon, and an hundred others, belong not to the
naturalist, but the ex∣perimental philosopher: the one gives an history
of Nature, as he finds she presents herself to him; and he draws the
obvious picture: the other, pursues her with close investigation,
tortures her by experiment to give up her secrets, and mea∣sures her latent
qualities with laborious pre∣cision. Much more, therefore, might be said of
the mechanical effects of air, and of the con∣jectures that have been made
respecting the form of its parts; how some have supposed them to
resemble little hoops, coil'd up in a spring; others, like fleeces of wool;
others, that the parts are endued with a repulsive quality, by which, when
squeezed together, they endeavour to fly off, and recede from each other. We
might have given the disputes relative to the <PB N="310" REF="333"/> height
to which this body of air extends above us, and concerning which there is no
agree∣ment. We might have enquired how much of the air we breathe is
elementary, and not redu∣cible to any other substance; and of what
den∣sity it would become, if it were supposed to be continued down to the
center of the earth. At that place we might, with the help of figures, and a
bold imagination, have shewn it twenty thousand times heavier than its bulk
of gold. We might also prove it millions of times purer than upon earth, when
raised to the sur∣face of the atmosphere. But these speculations do
not belong to natural history; and they have hitherto produced no great
advantages in that branch of science to which they more properly
appertain.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. An Essay towards a Natural History of the
Air.</HEAD>
<P>A Late eminent philosopher has considered our atmosphere as
one large chymical vessel, in which an infinite number of various
operations are constantly performing. In it all the bodies of the earth are
continually sending up a part of their substance by evaporation, to mix
in this great alembic, and to float a-while in common. Here minerals, from
their lowest depths, ascend in noxious, or in warm vapours, to make a part
of the general mass; seas, rivers, and subter∣raneous springs,
furnish their copious supplies; plants receive and return their share;
and ani∣mals, that by living upon, consume this general store, are found to
give it back in greater quan∣tities, when they die<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. ii. p. 593.</BIBL></NOTE>. The air, therefore,
that we breathe, and upon which we subsist, bears very little
resemblance to that pure elementary body which was described in the last
chapter; and which is rather a substance that may be conceived, than
experienced to exist. Air, such as we find it, is one of the most
compounded bodies in all nature. Water may be reduced to <PB N="312" REF="335"/>
a fluid every way resembling air, by heat; which, by cold, becomes water
again. Every thing we see, gives off its parts to the air, and has a little
floating atmosphere of its own round it. The rose is encompassed with a
sphere of its own odorous particles; while the night-shade in∣fects the air
with scents of a more ungrateful nature. The perfume of musk flies off in
such abundance, that the quantity remaining, be∣comes sensibly lighter by
the loss. A thousand substances that escape all our senses, we
know to be there; the powerful emanations of the load-stone, the effluvia of
electricity, the rays of light, and the insinuations of fire. Such are the
various substances through which we move, and which we are constantly
taking in at every pore, and returning again with imperceptible
dis∣charge.</P>
<P>This great solution, or mixture of all earthly bodies, is
continually operating upon itself; which, perhaps, may be the cause of its
un∣ceasing motion: but it operates still more visibly upon such
grosser substances as are exposed to its influence; for scarce any
substance is found capable of resisting the corroding qualities of the
air. The air, say the chymists, is a chaos, fur∣nished with all kinds of
salts and menstruums; and, therefore, it is capable of dissolving all 
<PB N="313" REF="336"/> kinds of bodies. It is well known, that copper and iron
are quickly covered, and eaten with rust; and that in the climates near the
equator, no art can keep them clean. In those dreary countries, the
instruments, knives and keys, that are kept in the pocket, nevertheless are
quickly encrusted; and the great guns, with every pre∣caution, after some
years, become useless. Stones, as being less hard, may be readily
sup∣posed to be more easily soluble. The marble of which the noble
monuments of Italian antiquity are composed, although in one of the finest
cli∣mates in the world, nevertheless shew the im∣pressions which have
been made upon them by the air. In many places they seem worm-eaten by time;
and, in others, they appear crumbling into dust. Gold alone seems to be
exempted from this general state of dissolution; it is never found to
contract rust, though exposed never so long: the reason of this seems
to be, that sea-salt, which is the only menstruum capable of act∣ing
upon, and dissolving gold, is but very little mixed with the air; for
salt being a very fixed body, and not apt to volatilize, and rise with
heat, there is but a small proportion of it in the atmosphere. In the
elaboratories, and shops, however, where salt is much used, and the air 
<PB N="314" REF="337"/> is impregnated with it, gold is found to rust as well
as other metals.</P>
<P>Bodies of a softer nature are obviously de∣stroyed by the
air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. iii. p. 62.</BIBL></NOTE>. Mr.
Boyle says, that silks brought to Jamaica, will, if there exposed to the
air, rot even while they preserve their colour; but if kept therefrom, they
both retain their strength and gloss. The same happens in Brasil, where
their cloaths, which are black, soon turn of an iron colour; though, in the
shops, they preserve their proper hue<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid, vol. iii. p. 68.</BIBL></NOTE>. In these tropical
climates also, such are the putrescent qualities of the air, that white
sugar will sometimes be full of maggots. Drugs and plaisters lose their
virtue, and become verminous. In some places they are obliged to expose
their sweetmeats by day in the sun, otherwise the night air would quickly
cause them to putrefy. On the con∣trary, in the cold arctic regions, animal
sub∣stances, during their winter, are never known to putrefy; and meat may
be kept for months, without any salt whatsoever. This experiment happily
succeeded with the eight Englishmen that were accidentally left upon the
inhospitable coasts of Greenland, at a place where seven Dutchmen had
perished but a few years before; for killing some rein-deer for their
subsistence, <PB N="315" REF="338"/> and having no salt to preserve
the flesh, to their great surprize, they soon found it did not want any,
as it remained sweet during their eight months continuance upon that
shore.</P>
<P>These powers with which air is endued over unorganized
substances, are exerted in a still stronger manner over plants, animals
of an in∣ferior nature, and, lastly, over man himself. Most of the
beauty, and the luxuriance of vege∣tation, is well known to be derived from the
be∣nign influence of the air: and every plant seems to have its favourite
climate, not less than its proper soil. The lower ranks of animals also,
seem formed for their respective climates, in which only they can live. Man
alone seems the child of every climate, and capable of existing in all.
However, this peculiar privilege does not exempt him from the influences of the
air; he is as much subject to its malignity, as the meanest insect or
vegetable.</P>
<P>With regard to plants, air is so absolutely ne∣cessary for
their life and preservation, that they will not vegetate in an exhausted
receiver. All plants have within them a quantity of air, which supports and
agitates their juices. They are con∣tinually imbibing fresh nutriment from
the air, to encrease this store, and to supply the wants which they
sustain from evaporation. When, <PB N="316" REF="339"/> therefore, the
external air is drawn from them, they are no longer able to subsist. Even
that quantity of air which they before were possessed of, escapes
through their pores, into the ex∣hausted receiver; and as this continues to
be pumped away, they become languid, grow flac∣cid, and die. However, the plant
or flower thus ceasing to vegetate, is kept, by being se∣cured from the
external air, a much longer time sweet than it would have continued, had it
been openly exposed.</P>
<P>That air which is so necessary to the life of vegetables, is
still more so to that of animals; there are none found, how seemingly
torpid so∣ever, that do not require their needful supply. Fishes
themselves will not live in water from whence the air is exhausted; and it
is generally supposed that they die in frozen ponds, from the want of this
necessary to animal existence. Many have been the animals that idle
curiosity has tor∣tured in the prison of a receiver, merely to ob∣serve
the manner of their dying. We shall, from a thousand instances, produce
that of the viper, as it is known to be one of the most vi∣vacious reptiles
in the world; and as we shall feel but little compassion for its
tortures. Mr. Boyle took a new caught viper, and shutting it up into a
small receiver, began to pump away <PB N="317" REF="340"/> the air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle's Phico. Mechan. Exper. Passim.</BIBL></NOTE>. 
<Q REND="inline">"At first, upon the air's being drawn away, it
began to swell; some time after he had done pumping, it began to gape, and
open its jaws; being thus compelled to open its jaws, it once more resumed
its former lankness; it then began to move up and down within, as if to
seek for air, and after a while foamed a little, leaving the foam sticking
to the inside of the glass; soon after the body and neck grew
pro∣digiously tumid, and a blister appeared upon its back; an hour and an
half after the receiver was exhausted, the distended viper moved, and gave
manifest signs of life; the jaws remained quite distended; as it were
from beneath the epi∣glottis, came the black tongue, and reached be∣yond it;
but the animal seemed, by its posture, not to have any life: the mouth
also was grown blackish within; and in this situation it continued for
twenty-three hours. But upon the air's being re-admitted, the viper's mouth was
presently closed, and soon after opened again; and for some time
those motions continued, which ar∣gued the remains of life."</Q> Such is the
fate of the most insignificant or minute reptile that can be thus included.
Mites, fleas, and even the little eels that are found swimming in vinegar,
die for want of air. Not only these, but the eggs <PB N="318" REF="341"/> of
these animals, will not produce in vacuo, but require air to bring them to
perfection.</P>
<P>As in this manner air is necessary to their sub∣sistence,
so also it must be of a proper kind, and not impregnated with foreign
mixtures. That factitious air which is pumped from plants or fluids, is
generally, in a short time, fatal to them. Mr. Boyle has given us many
expe∣riments to this purpose. After having shewn that all vegetable, and
most mineral substances, properly prepared, may afford air, by being
placed in an exhausted receiver, and this in such quantities, that some
have thought it a new sub∣stance, made by the alteration which the mi∣neral
or plant has undergone by the texture of its parts being loosened in the
operation—hav∣ing shewn, I say, that this air may be drawn in great
quantities from vegetable, animal, or mi∣neral substances, such as
apples, cherries, amber burnt, or hartshorn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle's Physic. Mechan. vol. ii. p.
598.</BIBL></NOTE>—he included a frog in artificial air, produced from
paste; in seven mi∣nutes space it suffered convulsions, and at last
lay still, and being taken out, recovered no motion at all, but was dead. A
bird enclosed in artificial air, from raisins, died in a quarter of a
minute, and never stirred more. A snail was put into the receiver, with air
of paste; in four <PB N="319" REF="342"/> minutes it ceased to move, and was
dead, altho' it had survived in vacuo for several hours: so that
factitious air proved a greater enemy to animals than even a vacuum
itself.</P>
<P>Air also may be impregnated with fumes that are instantly fatal
to animals. The fumes of hot iron, copper, or any other heated metal, blown
into the place where an animal is confined, in∣stantly destroy it. We have
already mentioned the vapours in the grotto Del Cane suffocating a dog. The
ancients even supposed, that these animals, as they always ran with their
noses to the ground, were the first that felt any infection. In short, it
should seem that the predominance of any one vapour, from any body, how
whol∣some soever in itself, becomes infectious; and that we owe the
salubrity of the air to the va∣riety of its mixture.</P>
<P>But there is no animal whose frame is more sensibly affected
by the changes of the air than man. It is true, he can endure a greater
va∣riety of climates than the lower orders generally are able to do; but it is
rather by the means which he has discovered of obviating their effects, than
by the apparent strength of his constitution. Most other animals can bear
cold or hunger better, endure greater fatigues in pro∣portion, and are
satisfied with shorter repose. <PB N="320" REF="343"/> The variations of
the climate, therefore, would probably affect them less, if they had the
same means or skill in providing against the severities of the change.
However this be, the body of man is an instrument much more nicely
sensible of the variations of the air, than any of those which his own
art has produced; for his frame alone seems to unite all their properties,
being invi∣gorated by the weight of the air, relaxed by its moisture,
enfeebled by its heat, and stiffened by its frigidity.</P>
<P>But it is chiefly by the predominance of some peculiar vapour,
that the air becomes unfit for human support. It is often found, by dreadful
experience, to enter into the constitution, to mix with its juices, and to
putrefy the whole mass of blood. The nervous system is not less
affected by its operations; palsies and vertigoes are caused by its damps;
and a still more fatal train of distempers by its exhalations. In order
that the air should be wholesome, it is necessary, as we have seen,
that it should not be of one kind, but the compound of several
substances; and the more various the composition, to all appear∣ance the
more salubrious. A man, therefore, who continues in one place, is not so
likely to enjoy this wholesome variety, as he who changes his situation;
and, if I may so express it, instead <PB N="321" REF="344"/> of waiting
for a renovation of air, walks forward to meet its arrival. Thus mere motion,
inde∣pendent even of the benefits of exercise, becomes wholsome, by thus
supplying a greater variety of that healthful fluid by which we are
sustained.</P>
<P>A thousand accidents are found to encrease these bodies of
vapour, that make one place more or less wholsome than another. Heat may
raise them in too great quantities; and cold may stagnate them. Minerals
may give off their effluvia in such proportion as to keep away all other kind
of air; vegetables may render the air unwholsome by their supply; and
animal putrefaction seems to furnish a quantity of vapour, at least as
noxious as any of the former. All these united, generally make up the mass
of respiration, and are, when mixed together, harmless; but any one of
them, for a long time singly predominant, becomes at length fatal.</P>
<P>The effects of heat in producing a noxious quality in the air, are
well known. Those torrid regions under the Line are always unwholsome. At
Senegal, I am told, the natives consider forty as a very advanced time of
life, and generally die of old age at fifty. At Carthagena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i. p. 42.</BIBL></NOTE>, in America, where the
heat of the hottest day ever <PB N="322" REF="345"/> known in Europe is
continual, where, during their winter season, these dreadful heats are
united with a continual succession of thunder, rain, and tempests,
arising from their intense∣ness, the wan and livid complexions of the
in∣habitants might make strangers suspect that they were just recovered
from some dreadful distem∣per; the actions of the natives are conformable
to their colour; in all their motions there is some∣what relaxed and languid;
the heat of the cli∣mate even affects their speech, which is soft and
slow, and their words generally broken. Tra∣vellers from Europe retain their
strength and ruddy colour in that climate, possibly for three or four
months; but afterwards suffer such de∣cays in both, that they are no longer
to be di∣stinguished from the inhabitants by their com∣plexion. However,
this languid and spiritless existence is frequently drawled on
sometimes even to eighty. Young persons are generally most affected by
the heat of climate, which spares the more aged; but all, upon their arrival
on the coasts, are subject to the same train of fatal dis∣orders. Few
nations have experienced the mor∣tality of these coasts, so much as our
own: in our unsuccessful attack upon Carthagena, more than three parts of
our army were destroyed by the climate alone; and those that returned from 
<PB N="323" REF="346"/> that fatal expedition, found their former vigour
irretrievably gone. In our more fortunate ex∣pedition, which gave us the
Havannah, we had little reason to boast of our success; instead of a
third, not a fifth part of the army were left survivors of their victory, the
climate being an enemy that even heroes cannot conquer.</P>
<P>The distempers that thus proceed from the cruel malignity of
those climates, are many: that, for instance, called the Chapotonadas,
car∣ries off a multitude of people; and extremely thins the crews of European
ships, whom gain tempts into those inhospitable regions. The nature of
this distemper is but little known, being caused in some persons by
cold, in others by indigestion. But its effects are far from being obscure;
it is generally fatal in three or four days: upon its seizing the patient, it
brings on what is there called the black vomit, which is the sad symptom
after which none are ever found to recover. Some, when the vomit attacks them,
are seized with a delirium, that, were they not tied down, they would tear
themselves to pieces, and thus expire in the midst of this fu∣rious
paroxysm. This disorder, in milder cli∣mates, takes the name of the bilious
fever, and is attended with milder symptoms, but very dangerous in all.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="347"/>There are many other disorders incident to
the human body, that seem the offspring of heat; but to mention no other,
that very lassitude which prevails in all the tropical climates, may be
considered as a disease. The inhabitants of India<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Amonitates, vol. v. p 444.</BIBL></NOTE>, says a
modern philosopher, sustain an unceasing languor, from the heats of
their cli∣mate; and are torpid in the midst of profusion. For this
reason, the great Disposer of Nature has cloathed their country with
trees of an amazing height, whose shade might defend them from the beams of
the sun; and whose continual fresh∣ness might, in some measure,
temperate their fierceness. From these shades, therefore, the air
receives refreshing moisture, and animals a cool∣ing protection. The whole
race of savage ani∣mals retire, in the midst of the day, to the very center
of the forests, not so much to avoid their enemy man, as to find a defence
against the raging heats of the season. This advantage which arises
from shade in torrid climates, may probably afford a solution for that
extraordinary circum∣stance related by Boyle, which he imputes to a different
cause. In the island of Ternate, be∣longing to the Dutch, a place that had
been long celebrated for its beauty and healthfulness, the clove trees grew
in such plenty, that they in <PB N="325" REF="348"/> some measure
lessened their own value: for this reason, the Dutch resolved to cut
down the forests, and thus to raise the price of the commodity: but they
had soon reason to repent of their avarice; for such a change ensued,
by cutting down the trees, that the whole island, from being healthy and
delightful, having loft its charming shades, became extremely sickly, and
has actually continued so to this day. Boerhaave considered heat so
prejudicial to health, that he was never seen to go near a fire.</P>
<P>An opposite set of calamities are the con∣sequence, in
climates where the air is condensed by cold. In such places, all that train
of distem∣pers which are known to arise from obstructed perspiration,
are very common<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz's History of Greenland,
vol. i. p. 235.</BIBL></NOTE>; eruptions, boils, scurvy, and a loathsome
leprosy, that covers the whole body with a scurf, and white putrid ulcers.
These disorders also, are in∣fectious; and, while they thus banish the
patient from society, they generally accompany him to the grave. The men of
those climates seldom attain to the age of fifty; but the women, who do not
lead such laborious lives, are found to live longer.</P>
<P>The autumnal complaints which attend a wet <PB N="326" REF="349"/>
summer, indicate the dangers of a moist air. The long continuance of an
east wind also, shews the prejudice of a dry one. Mineral ex∣halations,
when copious, are every where known to be fatal; and although we probably owe
the encrease and luxuriance of vegetation to a mo∣derate degree of their
warmth, yet the natives of those countries where there are mines in plenty,
but too often experience the noxious effects of their vicinity. Those trades
also that deal in the preparations of metals of all kinds, are always
unwholsome; and the workmen, after some time, are generally seen to
labour under palsies, and other nervous complaints. The vapours from some
vegetable substances, are well known to be attended with dangerous effects.
The shade of the machinel tree, in America, is said to be fatal; as was
that of the juniper, if we may credit the ancients. Those who walk through
fields of poppies, or in any manner prepare those flowers for making opium,
are very sensibly affected with the drowsiness they occasion. A
physician of Mr. Boyle's acquaintance, causing a large quantity of black
hellebore to be pounded in a mortar, most of the persons who were in the
room, and especially the person who pounded it, were purged by it, and
some of them strongly. He also gathered a certain plant in Ireland, which
the person who beat in a mortar, and the <PB N="327" REF="350"/> physician
who was standing near, were so strongly affected by, that their hands and
faces swelled to an enormous size, and continued tumid for a long time
after.</P>
<P>But neither mineral nor vegetable steams are so dangerous to the
constitution, as those pro∣ceeding from animal substances, putrefying
either by disease or death. The effluvia that comes from diseased
bodies, propagate that frightful catalogue of disorders which are called
infectious. The parts which compose vegetable vapours, and mineral
exhalations, seem gross and heavy, in comparison of these volatile
vapours, that go to great distances, and have been described as spreading
desolation over the whole earth. They fly every where; pene∣trate every
where; and the vapours that fly from a single disease, soon render it
epidemic.</P>
<P>The plague is the first upon the list in this class of human
calamities. From whence this scourge of man's presumption may have its
beginning, is not well known; but we well know that it is propagated by
infection. What∣ever be the general state of the atmosphere, we learn, from
experience, that the noxious vapours, though but singly introduced at
first, taints the air by degrees: every person in∣fected, tends to add to
the growing malignity; <PB N="328" REF="351"/> and, as the disorder becomes
more general, the putrescence of the air becomes more noxious, so that the
symptoms are aggravated by con∣tinuance. When it is said that the origin of
this disorder is unknown, it implies, that the air seems to be but little
employed in first pro∣ducing it. There are some countries, even in the
midst of Africa, that we learn have never been insected with it; but
continue, for centuries, unmolested. On the contrary, there are others, that
are generally visited once a year, as in Egypt, which, nevertheless,
seems peculiarly blessed with the serenity and temperature of its
climate. In the former countries, which are of vast extent, and many of them
very populous, every thing should seem to dispose the air to make the
plague continual among them. The great heats of the climate, the
unwholsomeness of the food, the sloth and dirt of the inhabitants, but,
above all, the bloody battles which are con∣tinually fought among them, after
which heaps of dead bodies are left unburied, and exposed to putrefaction.
All these one might think would be apt to bring the plague among them; and
yet, nevertheless, we are assured by Leo Africanus, that in Numidia the
plague is not known once in an hundred years; and that in Negroland, it is not
known at all. This dread∣ful disorder, therefore, must have its rise, not
<PB N="329" REF="352"/> from any previous disposition of the air, but from
some particular cause, beginning with one individual, and extending the
malignity, by com∣munication, till at last the air becomes actually tainted
by the generality of the infection.</P>
<P>The plague which spread itself over the whole world, in the year
1346, as we are told by Me∣zeray, was so contagious, that scarce a village,
or even an house, escaped being infected by it. Before it had reached
Europe, it had been for two years travelling from the great kingdom of Cathay,
where it began by a vapour most hor∣ridly fetid; this broke out of the earth
like a subterranean fire, and upon the first instant of its eruption,
consumed and desolated above two hundred leagues of that country, even to
the trees and stones.</P>
<P>In that great plague which desolated the city of London, in the
year 1665, a pious and learned schoolmaster of Mr. Boyle's acquaint∣ance,
who ventured to stay in the city, and took upon him the humane office of
visiting the sick and the dying, who had been deserted by better
physicians, averred, that being once called to a poor woman who had buried
her children of the plague, he found the room where she lay so little that
it scarce could hold any more than the bed whereon she was stretched.
However, in this <PB N="330" REF="353"/> wretched abode, beside her, in an
open coffin, her husband lay, who had some time before died of the same
disease; and whom she, poor crea∣ture, soon followed. But what shewed
the peculiar malignity of the air thus suffering from animal putrefaction,
was, that the contagious steams had produced spots on the very wall of
their wretched apartment: and Mr. Boyle's own study, which was contiguous to
a pest-house, was also spotted in the same frightful manner. Happily
for mankind, this disorder, for more than a century, has not been known in
our island; and, for this last age, has abated much of its violence, even
in those countries where it is most common. Diseases, like empires,
have their revolutions; and those which for a while were the scourge of
mankind, sink un∣heard of, to give place to new ones, more dreadful, as being
less understood.</P>
<P>For this revolution in disorders, which has employed the
speculation of many, Mr. Boyle accounts in the following manner. 
<Q REND="inline">"Since," says he, "there want not causes in the
bowels of the earth, to make considerable changes amongst the materials
that nature has plentifully treasured up in those magazines, and as those
noxious steams are abundantly supplied to the surface, it may not seem
improbable, that in this <PB N="331" REF="354"/> great variety, some may be
found capable of particularly affecting the human frame in a par∣ticular
manner, and thus of producing new dis∣eases. The duration of these may be
greater or less, according to the lastingness of those subter∣raneous
causes that produced them. On which account, it need be no wonder that some
diseases have but a short duration, and vanish not long after they
appear; whilst others may continue longer, as having under ground more
settled and durable causes to maintain them."</Q></P>
<P>From the recital of this train of mischiefs pro∣duced by the air,
upon minerals, plants, animals, and man himself, a gloomy mind may be apt to
dread this indulgent nurse of nature as a cruel and an inexorable
step-mother: but it is far other∣wise; and, although we are sometimes
injured, yet almost all the comforts and blessings of life spring from
its propitious influence. It would be needless to observe, that it is
absolutely ne∣cessary for the support of our lives; for of this, every
moment's experience assures us. But how it contributes to this support,
is not so readily comprehended. All allow it to be a friend, to whose
benefits we are constantly obliged: and yet, to this hour, philosophers are
divided as to the nature of the obligation. The dispute is, whether the air
is only useful by its weight to <PB N="332" REF="355"/> force our juices into
circulation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Keil. Robinson.</BIBL></NOTE>; or,
whether, by containing a peculiar spirit, it mixes with the blood in our
vessels, and acts like a spur to their industry<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Whytt upon vital and in∣voluntary
Motions.</BIBL></NOTE>. Perhaps it may exert both these useful offices at
the same time. Its weight may give the blood its progressive motion,
through the larger vessels of the body; and its admixture with it, cause
those contractions of all the vessels, which serve to force it still
more strongly for∣ward, through the minutest channels of the cir∣culation.
Be this as it may, it is well known, that that part of our blood which has
just re∣ceived the influx of the air in our bodies, is of a very different
colour from that which has almost performed its circuit. It has been found,
that the arterial blood which has been immediately mixed with the air in the
lungs, and, if I may so express it, is just beginning its journey through
the body, is of a fine florid scarlet colour; while, on the contrary, the
blood of the veins that is returning from having performed its duty, is of a
blackish crimson hue. Whence this difference of colour should proceed, is
not well understood: we only know the fact, that this florid colour is
communicated by the air; and we are well con∣vinced, <PB N="333" REF="356"/>
that this air has been admitted into the blood for very useful
purposes.</P>
<P>Besides this vital principle in animals, the air also gives life
and body to flame. A candle quickly goes out in an exhausted receiver; for
having soon consumed the quantity of air, it then expires, for want of a
fresh supply. There has been a flame contrived that will burn under water;
but none yet has been found, that will continue to burn without air. Gunpowder,
which is the most catching and powerful fire we know, will not go off in an
exhausted re∣ceiver; nay, if a train of gunpowder be laid, so as that one
part may be fired in the open air, yet the other part in vacuo will remain
un∣touched, and unconsumed. Wood also set on fire, immediately goes out;
and its flame ceases upon removing the air; for something is then wanting
to press the body of the fire against that of the fuel, and to prevent the
too speedy dif∣fusion of the flame. We frequently see cooks, and others,
whose business it is to keep up strong fires, take proper precautions
to exclude the beams of the sun from shining upon them, which effectually
puts them out. This they are apt to ascribe to a wrong cause; namely, the
operation of the light: but the real fact is, that <PB N="334" REF="357"/> the
warmth of the sun-beams lessen and dissipate the body of the air that
goes to feed the flame; and the fire, of consequence, languishes for want
of a necessary supply.</P>
<P>The air, while it thus kindles fire into flame, is notwithstanding
found to moderate the rays of light, to dissipate their violence, and to
spread an uniform lustre over every object. Were the beams of the sun to
dart directly upon us, with∣out passing through this protecting medium,
they would either burn us up at once, or blind us with their effulgence. But by
going through the air, they are reflected, refracted, and turned from their
direct course, a thousand different ways; and thus are more evenly
diffused over the face of nature.</P>
<P>Among the other necessary benefits the air is of to us, one of
the principal is its conveyance of sound. Even the vibrations of a bell,
which have the loudest effect that we know of, ceases to be heard, when
under the receiver of an air-pump. Thus all the pleasures we receive from
conversation with each other, or from music, depend entirely upon the
air.</P>
<P>Odours likewise are diffused only by the means of air; without
this fluid to swim in, they would for ever remain torpid in their
respective <PB N="335" REF="358"/> substances; and the rose would affect
us with as little sensations of pleasure, as the thorn on which it
grew.</P>
<P>Those who are willing to augment the cata∣logue of the benefits we
receive from this ele∣ment, assert also, that tastes themselves would
be insipid, were it not that the air presses their parts upon the nerves
of the tongue and palate, so as to produce their grateful effects. Thus,
continue they, upon the tops of high moun∣tains, as on the Pike of Teneriff,
the most poignant bodies, as pepper, ginger, salt, and spice, have no
sensible taste, for want of their particles being thus sent home to the
sensory. But, we owe the air sufficient obligations, not to be studious
of admitting this among the num∣ber: in fact, all substances have their
tastes, as well on the tops of mountains, as in the bottom of the valley; and
I have been one of many, who have ate a very savoury dinner on the Alps.</P>
<P>It is sufficient, therefore, that we regard the air as the parent
of health and vegetation; as a kind dispenser of light and warmth; and as
the conveyer of sounds and odours. This is an element of which avarice will
not deprive us; and which power cannot monopolize. The treasures of the
earth, the verdure of the fields, <PB N="336" REF="359"/> and even the
refreshments of the stream, are too often seen going only to assist
the luxuries of the great; while the less fortunate part of mankind stand
humble spectators of their encroachments. But the air no limitations can
bound, nor any land-marks restrain. In this benign element, all mankind can
boast an equal possession; and for this we all have equal obligations
to Heaven. We consume a part of it, for our own suste∣nance, while we
live; and, when we die, our putrefying bodies give back the supply, which,
during life, we had accumulated from the ge∣neral mass.</P>

<PB N="337" REF="360"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Of Winds, irregular and regular.</HEAD>
<P>WIND is a current of air. Experimental philosophers produce an
artificial wind, by an instrument called an aeolipile. This is nothing more
than an hollow copper ball, with a long pipe; a tea kettle might be readily
made into one, if it were entirely closed at the lid, and the spout left
open; through this spout it is to be filled with water, and then set upon
the fire, by which means it produces a violent blast, like wind, which
continues while there is any water remaining in the instrument. In this
manner water is converted into a rushing air; which, if caught as it goes
out, and left to cool, is again quickly converted into its former element.
Besides this, as was mentioned in the former chapter, almost every
substance contains some portions of air. Vegetables, or the bodies of
animals left to putrefy, produce it in a very co∣pious manner. But it is not
only seen thus es∣caping from bodies, but it may be very easily made to
enter into them. A quantity of air may be compressed into water, so as to
be in∣timately blended with it. It finds a much easier admission into
wine, or any fermented <PB N="338" REF="361"/> liquor; and an easier still,
into spirits of wine. Some salts suck up the air in such quantities,
that they are made sensibly heavier thereby, and often are melted by its
moisture. In this man∣ner, most bodies, being found either capable of
receiving or affording it, we are not to be sur∣prized at those streams
of air that are continually fleeting round the globe. Minerals, vegetables, and
animals, contribute to encrease the current; and are sending off their
constant supplies. These, as they are differently affected by cold or
heat, by mixture or putrefaction, all yield dif∣ferent quantities of air at
different times; and the loudest tempests, and most rapid whirlwinds, are
formed from their united contributions.</P>
<P>The sun is the principal instrument in rarefying the juices of
plants, so as to give an escape to their imprisoned air; it is also
equally operative in promoting the putrefaction of animals. Mi∣neral
exhalations are more frequently raised by subterranean heat. The moon, the
other pla∣nets, the seasons, are all combined in producing these effects
in a smaller degree. Mountains give a direction to the courses of the air.
Fires carry a current of air along their body. Night and day alternately chill
and warm the earth, and produce an alternate current of its vapours. These,
and an hundred other causes, may be <PB N="339" REF="362"/> assigned for
the variety, and the activity of the winds, their continual change, and
uncertain duration.</P>
<P>With us on land, therefore, as the wind pro∣ceeds from so many
causes, and meets such a variety of obstacles, there can be but little
hopes of ever bringing its motions to conform to theory; or of foretelling how
it may blow a minute to come. The great Bacon, indeed, was of opinion, that by
a close and regular history of the winds, continued for a number of ages
to∣gether, and the particulars of each observation reduced to general maxims,
we might at last come to understand the variations of this ca∣pricious
element; and that we could foretell the certainty of a wind, with as much
ease as we now foretell the return of an eclipse. Indeed, his own
beginnings in this arduous undertaking, seem to speak the possibility
of its success; but, unhappily for mankind, this investigation is the
work of ages, and we want a Bacon to direct the process.</P>
<P>To be able, therefore, with any plausibility, to account for the
variations of the wind upon land, is not to be at present expected; and to
understand any thing of their nature, we must have recourse to those
places where they are more permanent and steady. This uniformity 
<PB N="340" REF="363"/> and steadiness we are chiefly to expect upon the
ocean. There, where there is no variety of substances to furnish the air
with various and inconstant supplies, where there are no moun∣tains to
direct the course of its current, but where all is extensively uniform and
even; in such a place, the wind arising from a simple cause, must
have but one simple motion. In fact, we find it so. There are many parts of
the world where the winds, that with us are so uncertain, pay their stated
visits. In some places, they are found to blow one way by day, and another
by night; in others, for one half of the year, they go in a direction contrary
to their former course: but what is more extraordinary still, there are
some places where the winds never change, but for ever blow the same way.
This is particularly found to obtain between the tropics in the Atlantic and
Aethiopic oceans; as well as in the great Pacific sea.</P>
<P>Few things surely can appear more extra∣ordinary to a person who
has never been out of our variable latitudes, than this steady wind, that for
ever sits in the sail, sending the vessel forward; and as effectually
preventing its re∣turn. He who has been taught to consider that nothing in
the world is so variable as the winds, must certainly be surprized to
find a place where <PB N="341" REF="364"/> there is nothing more uniform. With
us their inconstancy has become a proverb; with the natives of those
distant climates, they may talk of a friend or a mistress as fixed and
unchange∣able as the winds, and mean a compliment by the comparison. When our
ships are once ar∣rived into the proper latitudes of the great Pa∣cific
ocean, the mariner forgets the helm, and his skill becomes almost
useless: neither storms nor tempests are known to deform the glassy
bosom of that immense sheet of waters; a gentle breeze, that for ever
blows in the same di∣rection, rests upon the canvas, and speeds the
navigator. In the space of six weeks, ships are thus known to cross an
immense ocean, that takes more than so many months to return. Upon
returning, the trade-wind, which has been propitious, is then avoided; the
mariner is ge∣nerally obliged to steer into the northern lati∣tudes, and to
take the advantage of every casual wind that offers, to assist him into
port. This wind, which blows with such constancy one way, is known to
prevail not only in the Pacific ocean, but also in the Atlantic, between the
coasts of Guinea and Brazil; and, likewise, in the Aethiopic ocean. This
seems to be the great universal wind, blowing from the east to the 
<PB N="342" REF="365"/> west, that prevails in all the extensive oceans
where the land does not frequently break the general current. Were the whole
surface of the globe an ocean, there would probably be but this one wind, for
ever blowing from the east, and pursuing the motions of the sun
westward. All the other winds seem subordinate to this; and many of them
are made from the de∣viations of its current. To form, therefore, any
conception relative to the variations of the wind in general, it is fittest
to begin with that which never varies.</P>
<P>There have been many theories to explain this invariable motion of
the winds; among the rest, we cannot omit that of Doctor Lyster, for its
strangeness. 
<Q REND="inline">"The sea," says he, "in those la∣titudes, is
generally covered over with green weeds, for a great extent; and the air
produced from the vegetable perspiration of these, pro∣duces the
trade-wind."</Q> The theory of Car∣tesius was not quite so absurd. He
alledged, that the earth went round faster than its atmosphere at the
equator; so that its motion, from west to east, gave the atmosphere an
imaginary one from east to west; and thus an east-wind was eternally
seen to prevail. Rejecting those arbi∣trary opinions, conceived without
force, and asserted without proof, Doctor Halley has given 
<PB N="343" REF="366"/> one more plausible; which seems to be the reigning
system of the day.</P>
<P>To conceive his opinion clearly, let us for a moment suppose the
whole surface of the earth to be an ocean, and the air encompassing it on
every side, without motion. Now it is evident, that that part of the air that
lies directly under the beams of the sun, will be rarefied; and if the sun
remained for ever in the same place, there would be a great vacuity in the
air, if I may so express it, beneath the place where the sun stood. But
the sun moving forward, from east to west, this vacuity will follow too,
and still be made under it. But while it goes on to make new vacuities, the
air will rush in to fill up those the sun has already made; in other
words, as it is still travelling forward, the air will continually be
rushing in behind, and pursue its motions from east to west. In this
manner, the air is put into motion by day; and by night, the parts continue to
impel each other, till the next return of the sun, that gives a new force to
the circulation.</P>
<P>In this manner is explained the constant east-wind that is found
blowing round the globe, near the equator. But it is also known, that as we
recede from the equator on either side, we come into a trade-wind, that
continually blows <PB N="344" REF="367"/> from the poles, from the north on one
side, or the south on the other, both directing towards the equator. This
also proceeds from a similar cause with the former; for the air being
more rarefied in those places over which the sun more directly darts its
rays, the currents will come both from the north and the south, to fill up
the intermediate vacuity.</P>
<P>These two motions, namely, the general one from east to west,
and the more particular one from both the Poles, will account for all the
phae∣nomena of trade-winds; which, if the whole sur∣face of the globe were
sea, would undoubtedly be constant, and for ever continue to blow in one
direction. But there are a thousand circum∣stances to break these
air-currents into smaller ones; to drive them back against their general
course; to raise or depress them; to condense them into storms; or to
whirl them in eddies. In consequence of this, regard must be often had to
the nature of the soil, the position of the high mountains, the course of
the rivers, and even to the luxuriance of vegetation.</P>
<P>If a country lying directly under the sun, be very flat and
sandy, and if the land be low and extensive, the heats occasioned by the
reflection of the sun-beams, produces a very great rare∣faction of the air.
The desarts of Africa, which <PB N="345" REF="368"/> are conformable to this
description, are scarce ever fanned by a breath of wind by day; but the
burning sun is continually seen blazing in intolerable splendor above
them. For this rea∣son, all along the coasts of Guinea, the wind is always
perceived blowing in upon land, in order to fill up the vacuity caused by the
sun's ope∣ration. In those shores, therefore, the wind blows in a
contrary direction to that of its ge∣neral current; and is constantly found
setting in from the west.</P>
<P>From the same cause it happens, that those constant calms,
attended with deluges of rain, are found in the same part of the ocean. For
this tract being placed in the middle, between the westerly winds blowing on
the coast of Guinea, and the easterly trade-winds that move at some
distance from shore, in a contrary di∣rection, the tendency of that part of
the air that lies between these two opposite currents, is indifferent to
either, and so rests between both in torpid serenity; and the weight of
the incum∣bent atmosphere, being diminished by the con∣tinual contrary
winds blowing from hence, it is unable to keep the vapours suspended that
are copiously borne thither; so that they fall in con∣tinual rains.</P>
<P>But it is not to be supposed, that any theory 
<PB N="346" REF="369"/> can account for all the phaenomena of even those winds
that are known to be most regular. In∣stead, therefore, of a complete
system of the trade-winds, we must rather be content with an imperfect
history. These<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p.
230.</BIBL></NOTE>, as was said, being the result of a combination of
effects, assume as great a variety as the causes producing them are
various.</P>
<P>Besides the great general wind abovemen∣tioned, in those parts
of the Atlantic that lie under the temperate zone, a north wind pre∣vails
constantly during the months of October, November, December, and January.
These, therefore, are the most favourable months for embarking for the
East-Indies, in order to take the benefit of these winds, for crossing
the line: and it has been often found, by experience, that those who had
set sail five months before, were not in the least farther advanced in
their voyage, than those who waited for the favourable wind. During the
winter of Nova Zembla, and the other arctic countries, a north wind reigns
al∣most continually. In the Cape de Verde islands, a south wind prevails
during the month of July. At the Cape of Good Hope, a north-west wind blows
during the month of September. There are also regular winds, produced by
various causes, upon land. The ancient Greeks were the <PB N="347" REF="370"/>
first who observed a constant breeze, produced by the melting of the
snows, in some high neigh∣bouring countries. This was perceived in Greece,
Thrace, Macedonia, and the Aegean sea. The same kind of winds are now
remarked in the kingdom of Congo, and the most southern parts of Africa.
The flux and reflux of the sea also produces some regular winds, that
serve the purposes of trade; and, in general, it may be observed, that
wherever there is a strong current of water, there is a current of air that
seems to attend it.</P>
<P>Beside these winds that are found to blow in one direction,
there are, as was said before, others that blow for certain months of the
year one way, and the rest of the year the contrary way: these are called
the Monsoons, from a famous pilot of that name, who first used them in
navigation with success<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Varenii Geographia
Geurculis, cap. 20.</BIBL></NOTE>. In all that part of the ocean that lies
between Africa and India, the east winds begin at the month of January, and
continue till about the commencement of June. In the month of August, or
September, the contrary direction takes place; and the west winds prevail for
three or four months. The interval between these winds, that is to say,
from the end of June to the beginning of <PB N="348" REF="371"/> August, there
is no fixed wind; but the sea is usually tossed by violent tempests,
proceeding from the north. These winds are always subject to their
greatest variations, as they approach the land; so that on one side of
the great penin∣sula of India, the coasts are, for near half the year,
harrassed by violent hurricanes, and north∣ern tempests; while, on the
opposite side, and all along the coasts of Coromandel, these dread∣ful
tempests are wholly unknown. At Java, and Ceylon, a west wind begins to
reign in the month of September; but at fifteen days of south latitude, this
wind is found to be lost, and the great general trade-wind from the east,
is perceived to prevail. On the contrary, at Co∣chin, in China, the west wind
begins at March; so that these Monsoons prevail, at different
sea∣sons, throughout the Indies. So that the ma∣riner takes one part of the
year to go from Java to the Moluccas; another from Cochin to Mo∣lucca; another
from Molucca to China; and still another to direct him from China to
Japan.</P>
<P>There are winds also that may be considered as peculiar to
certain coasts; for example, the south wind is almost constant upon the
coasts of Chili and Peru; western winds almost constantly prevail on
the coast of Terra Magellanica; and <PB N="349" REF="372"/> in the environs of
the Streights le Maire. On the coasts of Malabar, north and north-west
winds prevail continually; along the coast of Guinea, the north-west wind
is also very fre∣quent; and, at a distance from the coasts, the
north-east is always found prevailing. From the beginning of November to the
end of Decem∣ber, a west wind prevails on the coasts of Japan; and, during
the whole winter, no ships can leave the port of Cochin, on account of the
impetuosity of the winds that set upon the coast. These blow with
such vehemence that the ports are entirely choaked up with sand, and even
boats themselves are not able to enter. However, the east winds that
pre∣vail for the other half of the year, clear the mouths of their harbours
from the accumu∣lations of the preceding winter, and set the confined ships
at liberty. At the Streights of Babelmandel there is a south wind that
perio∣dically returns, and which is always followed by a north-east.</P>
<P>Beside winds thus peculiar to certain coasts, there are others
found to prevail on all the coasts, in warm climates; which, during one part
of the day, blow from the shore, and, during another part of it, blow from
the sea. The sea-breeze, in those countries, as Dampier 
<PB N="350" REF="373"/> observes, commonly rises in the morning, about nine,
proceeding slowly, in a fine small black curl, upon the surface of the
water, and making its way to refresh the shore. It is gentle at first,
but encreases gradually till twelve, then insen∣sibly sinks away, and
is totally hushed at five. Upon its ceasing, the land-breeze begins to take
its turn, which increases till twelve at night, and is succeeded, in the
morning, by the sea-breeze again. Without all doubt, nothing could have been
more fortunate, for the inha∣bitants of the warm countries, where those
breezes blow, than this alternate refreshment, which they feel at those
seasons when it is most wanted. The heat, on some coasts, would be
insupportable, were it not for such a supply of air, when the sun has
rarefied all that which lay more immediately under the coast. The
sea-breeze temperates the heat of the sun by day; and the land-breeze
corrects the malig∣nity of the dews, and vapours, by night. Where these
breezes, therefore, prevail, and they are very common, the inhabitants enjoy a
share of health, and happiness, unknown to those that live much farther
up the coun∣try, or such as live in similar latitudes with∣out this
advantange. The cause of these ob∣viously seems to arise from the
rarefaction of <PB N="351" REF="374"/> the air by the sun, as their duration
continues with its appearance, and alters when it goes down. The sun, it is
observed, equally dif∣fusing his beams upon land and sea, the land, being
a more solid body than the water, re∣ceives a greater quantity of heat, and
reflects it more strongly. Being thus, therefore, heated to a greater degree
than the waters, it, of con∣sequence, drives the air from land out to sea;
but, its influence being removed, the air re∣turns to fill up the former
vacuity. Such is the usual method of accounting for this phaeno∣mena; but,
unfortunately, these sea and land breezes are visitants that come at all
hours. On the coasts of Malabar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
ii. p. 252.</BIBL></NOTE>, the land-breezes be∣gin at midnight, and continue
till noon; then the sea-breezes take their turn, and continue till midnight
again. While, again, at Congo, the land-breezes begin at five, and continue
till nine the next day.</P>
<P>But, if the cause of these be so inscrutable, that are, as
we see, tolerably regular in their visitations, what shall we say to
the winds of our own climate, that are continually shifting, and incapable of
rest? Some general causes may be assigned, which nothing but particular
ex∣perience can apply. And, in the first place, it <PB N="352" REF="375"/> may
be observed, that clouds, and heat, and, in short, whatever either
encreases the density or the elasticity of the air, in any one place,
will produce a wind there: for the encreased activity of the air thus
pressing more powerfully on the parts of it that are adjacent, will drive
them forward, and thus go on, in a current, till the whole comes to an
equality.</P>
<P>In this manner, as a denser air produces a wind, on the one hand;
so will any accident, that contributes to lighten the air, produce it on the
other: for, a lighter air may be considered as a vacuity, into which the
neigh∣bouring air will rush: and hence it happens, that when the barometer
marks a peculiar light∣ness in the air, it is no wonder that it foretells a
storm.</P>
<P>The winds upon large waters are generally more regular than those
upon land. The wind at sea generally blows with an even steady gale; the
wind at land puffs by intervals, encreasing its strength, and remitting it,
without any ap∣parent cause. This, in a great measure, may be owing to the
many mountains, towers, or trees, that it meets in its way, all contri∣buting
either to turn it from its course, or in∣terrupt its passage.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="376"/>The east wind blows more constantly than
any other, and for an obvious reason: all other winds are, in some
measure, deviations from it, and partly may owe their origin thereto. It is
generally, likewise, the most powerful, and for the same reason.</P>
<P>There are often double currents of the air. While the wind blows one
way, we frequently see the clouds move another. This is almost ever the
case before thunder; for it is well known that the thunder cloud always moves
against the wind: the cause of this surprizing appearance has hitherto
remained a secret. From hence we may conclude, that weathercocks only inform
us of that current of the air, which is near the surface of the earth; but
are often erroneous with regard to the upper regions; and, in fact, Derham has
often found them erroneous.</P>
<P>Winds are generally more powerful on ele∣vated situations than on
the plain, because their progress is interrupted by fewer obstacles. In
proportion as we ascend the heights of a moun∣tain, the violence of the
weather seems to en∣crease, until we have got above the region of storms,
where all is usually calm and serene. Sometimes, however, the storms
rise even to the tops of the highest mountains; as we learn from those
who have been on the Andes, and <PB N="354" REF="377"/> as we are convinced by
the deep snows that crown even the highest.</P>
<P>Winds blowing from the sea are generally moister, and more
attended with rains, than those which blow over extensive tracts of land:
for the sea gives off more vapours to the air, and these are rolled forward
upon land, by the winds blowing from thence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Derham's Phisico Theol.</BIBL></NOTE>. For this reason
our easterly winds, that blow from the conti∣nent, are dry, in comparison
of those that blow from the surface of the ocean, with which we are
surrounded on every other quarter.</P>
<P>In general the winds are more boisterous in spring and autumn,
than at other seasons: for, that being the time of high tides, the sea
may communicate a part of its motions to the winds. The sun, and moon,
also, which then have a greater effect upon the waters, may also have
some influence upon the winds; for, there being a great body of air
surround∣ing the globe, which, if condensed into water, would cover it to
the depth of thirty-two feet, it is evident that the sun and moon will, to a
proportionable degree, affect the atmosphere, and make a tide of air. This
tide will be scarce perceivable, indeed; but, without doubt, it actu∣ally
exists; and may contribute to encrease the <PB N="355" REF="378"/> vernal
and autumnal storms, which are then known to prevail.</P>
<P>Upon narrowing the passage through which the air is driven, both
the density and the swiftness of the wind is encreased. For as
cur∣rents of water flow with greater force and ra∣pidity by narrowing their
channels, so also will a current of air, driven through a contracted
space, grow more violent and irresistible. Hence we find those dreadful
storms that pre∣vail in the defiles of mountains, where the wind, pushing
from behind through a narrow chan∣nel, at once encreases in speed and
density, le∣velling, or tearing up, every obstacle that rises to
obstruct its passage.</P>
<P>Winds reflected from the sides of moun∣tains and towers, are often
found to be more forceful than those in direct progression. This we
frequently perceive near lofty buildings, such as churches or steeples,
where winds are generally known to prevail, and that much more powerful than at
some distance. The air, in this case, by striking against the side
of the building, acquires additional density and, there∣fore, blows with more
force.</P>
<P>These differing degrees of density, which the air is found to
possess, sufficiently shew that the force of the winds do not depend
upon their velo∣city <PB N="356" REF="379"/> alone; so that those
instruments called <HI>anemometers,</HI> which are made to measure the
ve∣locity of the wind, will by no means give us certain information of the
force of the storm. In order to estimate this with exactness we ought to
know its density; which also these are not cal∣culated to discover. For
this reason we often see storms, with very powerful effects, that do not
seem to shew any great speed; and, on the con∣trary, we see these
wind measurers go round, with great swiftness, when scarce any damage
has followed from the storm.</P>
<P>Such is the nature, and the inconstancy, of the irregular winds
with which we are best acquainted. But their effects are much more formidable
in those climates, near the tropics, where they are often found to break in
upon the steady course of the trade-winds, and to mark their passage
with destruction. With us the tempest is but rarely known, and its ra∣vages
are registered as an uncommon calamity; but, in the countries that lie
between the tro∣pics, and for a good space beyond them, its visits are
frequent, and its effects anticipated. In these regions the winds vary their
terrors; sometimes involving all things in a suffocating heat; sometimes
mixing all the elements of fire, air, earth, and water together; sometimes,
with a momentary swiftness, passing over the face <PB N="357" REF="380"/> of the country, and destroying all things in their passage;
and sometimes raising whole sandy deserts in one country, to deposit
them upon some other. We have little reason, therefore, to envy these
climates, the luxuriance of their soil, or the brightness of their skies.
Our own muddy atmosphere, that wraps us round in obscurity, though it fails
to gild our prospects with sun-shine, or our groves with fruitage,
ne∣vertheless answers the calls of industry. They may boast of a
plentiful, but precarious harvest; while, with us, the labourer toils in a
certain expectation of a moderate, but an happy return.</P>
<P>In Egypt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p.
258</BIBL></NOTE>, a kingdom so noted for its fertility, and the brightness
of its atmosphere, during summer, the south winds are so hot, that they
almost stop respiration; besides which, they are charged with such
quantities of sand, that they sometimes darken the air, as with a thick
cloud. These sands are so fine, and driven with such violence, that
they penetrate every where; even into chests, be they shut never so
closely. If these winds happen to continue for any length of time, they
produce epidemic diseases; and are often followed by a great mor∣tality. It
is also found to rain but very seldom in that country; however, the want of
showers <PB N="358" REF="381"/> is richly compensated by the copiousness
of their dews, which greatly tend to promote vegetation.</P>
<P>In Persia, the winter begins in November, and continues till
March. The cold at that time is intense enough to congeal the water; and
snow falls, in abundance, upon their mountains. Dur∣ing the months of March
and April, winds arise, that blow with great force, and seem to usher in
the heats of summer. These return again, in autumn, with some violence;
without, how∣ever, producing any dreadful effects. But, during their summer,
all along the coasts of the Persian Gulph, a very dangerous wind pre∣vails,
which the natives call the Sameyel, still more dreadful and burning than that
of Egypt, and attended with instant and fatal ef∣fects. This terrible
blast, which was, perhaps, the pestilence of the ancients, instantly
kills all those that it involves in its passage. What its malignity
consists in, none can tell, as none have ever survived its effects, to
give information. It frequently, as I am told, assumes a visible form;
and darts, in a kind of bluish vapour, along the surface of the country.
The natives, not only of Persia, but Arabia, talk of its ef∣fects with
terror; and their poets have not failed to heighten them, with the
assistance of imagination. They have described it as un∣der 
<PB N="359" REF="382"/> the conduct of a minister of vengeance, who governs
its terrors, and raises, or depresses it, as he thinks proper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Herbelot. Bibliotheque Oriental.</BIBL></NOTE>. These
deadly winds are also known along the coasts of India, at Neca∣patan,
Masulipatan, and Petapoli. But, luckily for mankind, the shortness of
their duration diminishes the injuries that might ensue from their
malignity.</P>
<P>The Cape of Good Hope, as well as many islands in the
West-Indies, are famous for their hurricanes, and that extraordinary kind of
cloud which is said to produce them. This cloud, which is the fore-runner of
an approaching hurricane, appears, when first seen, like a small black
spot, on the verge of the horizon; and is called, by sailors, the bull's
eye, from being seen so minute at a vast distance. All this time, a
per∣fect calm reigns over the sea and land, while the cloud grows gradually
broader as it ap∣proaches. At length, coming to the place where its fury is to
fall, it invests the whole horizon with darkness. During all the time of
its approach, an hollow murmur is heard in the cavities of the mountains; and
beasts and animals, sensible of its approach, are seen running over the
fields, to seek for shelter. Nothing can be more terrible than its violence
when it begins. The houses in those countries, <PB N="360" REF="383"/> which
are made of timber, the better to resist its fury, bend to the blast like
osiers, and again recover their rectitude. The sun, which, but a moment
before, blazed with meridian splendor, is totally shut out; and a midnight
darkness prevails, except that the air is inces∣santly illuminated with
gleams of lightening, by which one can easily see to read. The rain falls,
at the same time, in torrents; and its descent has been resembled to what
pours from the spouts of our houses after a violent shower. These
hurri∣canes are not less offensive to the sense of smell∣ing also;
and never come without leaving the most noisome stench behind them. If
the seamen also lay by their wet cloaths, for twenty-four hours, they are
all found swarming with little white maggots, that were brought with the
hur∣ricane. Our first mariners, when they visited these regions, were
ignorant of its effects, and the signs of its approach; their ships,
therefore, were dashed to the bottom at the first onset; and numberless
were the wrecks which the hurri∣cane occasioned. But, at present, being
fore∣warned of its approach, they strip their masts of all their sails,
and thus patiently abide its fury. These hurricanes are common in all the
tro∣pical climates. On the coasts of Guinea they have frequently three, or
four, in a day, that thus shut out the heavens, for a little space; 
<PB N="361" REF="384"/> and when past leave all again in former splen∣dor.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey chiefly prevail, on that
coast, in the intervals of the trade winds; the approach of which clears the
air of its meteors, and gives these mortal showers that little degree of
whole∣someness which they possess. They chiefly obtain there during
the months of April and May; they are known, at Loango, from January to April;
on the opposite coast of Africa, the hurricane season begins at May;
and, in general, whenever a trade wind begins to cease, these irregular
tempests are found to exert their fury.</P>
<P>All this is terrible; but there is a tempest, known in those
climates, more formidable than any we have hitherto been describing, which is
called, by the Spaniards, a Tornado. As the former was seen arriving from one
part of the heavens, and making a line of destruction; so the winds in this
seem to blow from every quarter, and settle upon one destined place, with
such fury, that nothing can resist their vehemence. When they have all
met, in their central spot, then the whirlwind begins with circular rapidity.
The sphere, every moment widens, as it con∣tinues to turn, and catches every
object that lies within its attraction. This, also, like the former, is
preceded by a flattering calm; the air is every where hushed; and the sea
is as <PB N="362" REF="385"/> smooth as polished glass: however, as its
effects are more dreadful than those of the ordinary hurricane, the mariner
tries all the power of his skill to avoid it; which, if he fails of doing,
there is the greatest danger of his going to the bottom. All along the
coasts of Guinea, beginning about two degrees north of the line, and so
downward, lengthwise, for about a thousand miles, and as many broad, the
ocean is unnavigable, upon account of these tornados. In this torpid region
there reigns unceasing tor∣nados, or continual calms; among which, what∣ever
ship is so unhappy as to fall, is totally deprived of all power of
escaping. In this dreadful repose of all the elements, the solitary
vessel is obliged to continue, without a single breeze to assist
the mariner's wishes, except those whirlwinds, which only serve to
encrease his calamity. At present, therefore, this part of the ocean is
totally avoided; and, although there may be much gold along the coasts of
that part of Africa, to tempt avarice, yet there is something, much more
dreadful than the fabled dragon of antiquity, to guard the treasure. As the
internal parts of that country are totally unknown to travellers, from their
burning sands and extensive desarts, so here we find a vast tract of
ocean, lying off its shores, equally unvisited by the mariner.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="386"/>But of all those terrible tempests that
deform the face of Nature, and repress human pre∣sumption, the sandy
tempests of Arabia and Africa, are the most terrible, and strike the
imagination most strongly. To conceive a pro∣per idea of these, we are by
no means to suppose them resembling those whirlwinds of dust that we
sometimes see scattering in our air, and sprinkling their contents upon
our roads, or meadows. The sand-storm of Africa, exhibits a very different
appearance. As the sand of which the whirl∣wind is composed, is
excessively fine, and al∣most resembles the parts of water, its motion
entirely resembles that of a fluid; and the whole plain seems to float
onward, like a slow inun∣dation. The body of sand thus rolling, is deep
enough to bury houses and palaces in its bo∣som: travellers who are
crossing those extensive deserts, perceive its approach at a
distance; and, in general, have time to avoid it, or turn out of its way, as
it generally extends but to a moderate breadth. However, when it is extremely
rapid, or very extensive, as sometimes is the case, no swiftness, no
art, can avail; nothing then remains, but to meet death with fortitude, and
submit to be buried alive with resignation.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="387"/>It is happy for us of Britain, that we have no
such calamity to fear; for, from this, even some parts of Europe are not
entirely free. We have an account given us, in the History of the French
Academy, of a miserable town in France, that is constantly in danger of
being buried under a similar inundation; with which I will take leave to
close this chapter. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the neighbourhood of St. Paul de Leon, in Lower
Brittany<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Histoire de l'Accademic des Sciences,
an. 1722.</BIBL></NOTE>, there lies a tract of country along the sea-side,
which before the year 1666 was inha∣bited, but now lies deserted, by reason
of the sands which cover it, to the height of twenty feet; and which every
year advance more and more in land, and gain ground continually. From the time
mentioned above, the sand has buried more than six leagues of the country
inward; and it is now but half a league from the town of St. Paul; so that,
in all appearance, the inhabit∣ants must be obliged to abandon it entirely.
In the country that has been overwhelmed, there are still to be seen the
tops of some steeples peeping through the sand, and many chimnies that
still remain above this sandy ocean. The inhabitants, however, had
sufficient time to escape; but being deprived of their little all, they had
no other re∣source <PB N="365" REF="388"/> but begging for their
subsistence. This calamity chiefly owes its advancement to a north, or an
east-wind, raising the sand, which is ex∣tremely fine, in such great
quantities, and with such velocity, that M. Deslands, who gave the account,
says, that while he was walking near the place, during a moderate breeze of
wind, he was obliged, from time to time, to shake the sand from his cloaths
and his hat, on which it was lodged in great quantities, and made them too
heavy to be easily borne. Still further, when the wind was violent, it drove
the sand across a little arm of the sea, into the town of Roscoff, and
covered the streets of that place two feet deep; so that they have been
obliged to carry it off in carts. It may also be ob∣served, that there are
several particles of iron mixed with the sand, which are readily affected
by the loadstone. The part of the coast that furnishes these sands,
is a tract of about four leagues in length; and is upon a level with the sea
at high-water. The shore lies in such a manner as to leave its sands
subject only to the north and east winds, that bear them farther up the
shore. It is easy to conceive how the same sand that has at one time
been borne a short way in land, may, by some succeeding and stronger 
<PB N="366" REF="389"/> blast, be carried up much higher; and thus the whole
may continue advancing forward, de∣luging the plain, and totally destroying
its fer∣tility. At the same time, the sea, from whence this deluge of
sand proceeds, may furnish it in inexhaustible quantities. This unhappy
country, thus overwhelmed in so singular a manner, may well justify what
the ancients and the moderns have reported concerning those tempests of
sand in Africa, that are said to destroy villages, and even armies, in
their bosom."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. Of Meteors, and such Appearances as result from a
Combination of the Elements.</HEAD>
<P>IN proportion as the substances of nature are more compounded
and combined, their appear∣ances become more inexplicable and amazing. The
properties of water have been very nearly ascertained. Many of the qualities
of air, earth, and fire, have been discovered, and estimated; but when
these come to be united by Nature, they often produce a result which no
artificial combinations can imitate; and we stand sur∣prized, that although
we are possessed of all those substances which Nature makes use
of, she shews herself a much more various operator than the most
skilful chymist ever appeared to be. Every cloud that moves, and every
shower that falls, serves to mortify the philoso∣pher's pride, and to
shew him hidden qualities in air and water, that he finds it difficult to
ex∣plain. Dews, hail, snow, and thunder, are not less difficult for being
more common. Indeed, when we reflect on the manner in which Nature performs any
one of these operations, our wonder encreases. To see water, which is
heavier than air, rising in air, and then falling in <PB N="368" REF="391"/> a
form so very different from that in which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rose; to see the same fluid at one time descend∣ing in the
form of hail, at another in that of snow; to see two clouds, by dashing
against each other, producing an electrical fire, which no watery
composition that we know of can ef∣fect; these, I say, serve
sufficiently to excite our wonder; and still the more, in proportion as the
objects are ever pressing on our curiosity. Much, however, has been
written concerning the manner in which Nature operates in these productions;
as nothing is so ungrateful to mankind as hopeless ignorance.</P>
<P>And first, with regard to the manner in which water evaporates,
and rises to form clouds, much has been advanced, and many theories
de∣vised. All water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Spectacle de la Nature,
vol. iii.</BIBL></NOTE>, say some, has a quantity of air mixed with it; and
the heat of the sun dart∣ing down, disengages the particles of this air
from the grosser fluid: the sun's rays being re∣flected back from the
water, carry back with them those bubbles of air and water which, being
lighter than the condensed air, will ascend till they meet with a more
rarefied air; and they will then stand suspended. Experience, how∣ever,
proves nothing of all this. Particles of air or fire, are not thus known to
ascend with a thin coat of water; and, in fact, we know that 
<PB N="369" REF="392"/> the little particles of steam are solid drops of
water. But besides this, water is known to eva∣porate more powerfully in the
severest frost, than when the air is moderately warm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires de l'Accademie des Sciences, an.
1705.</BIBL></NOTE>. Doctor Ha∣milton, therefore, of the university of
Dublin, rejecting this theory, has endeavoured to esta∣blish another.
According to him, as aqua fortis is a menstruum that dissolves iron, and
keeps it mixed in the fluid; as aqua regia is a menstruum that dissolves
gold; or as water dissolves salts to a certain quantity; so air is a
menstruum that corrodes and dissolves a certain quantity of water, and
keeps it suspended above. But how∣ever ingenious this may be, it can hardly
be ad∣mitted; as we know, by Marriotte's experi∣ment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mariotte, de la Nature de l'Air, p. 97, 106.</BIBL></NOTE>,
that if water and air be enclosed toge∣ther, instead of the air's acting as
a menstruum upon the water, the water will act as a men∣struum upon the
air, and take it all up. We know also, that of two bodies, that which is
most fluid and penetrating, is most likely to be the menstruum of the
other; but water is more fluid and penetrating than air, and, therefore, the
most likely of the two to be the menstruum. We know that all bodies are
more speedily acted upon, the more their parts are brought into con∣tact 
<PB N="370" REF="393"/> with the menstruum that dissolves them: but water,
inclosed with comprest air, is not the more diminished thereby<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Boyle's Works, vol. ii. p. 619.</BIBL></NOTE>. In
short, we know, that cold, which diminishes the force of other
menstruums, is often found to promote evapo∣ration. In this variety of
opinion, and uncer∣tainty of conjecture, I cannot avoid thinking that a theory
of evaporation may be formed upon very simple and obvious principles, and
embarrassed, as far as I can conceive, with very few objections.</P>
<P>We know that a repelling power prevails in nature, not less than
an attractive one. This repulsion prevails strongly between the body of
fire and that of water. If I plunge the end of a red hot bar of iron into a
vessel of water, the fluid rises, and large drops of it fly up in all
manner of directions, every part bubbling and steaming until the iron be
cold. Why may we not, for a moment, compare the rays of the sun, darted
directly upon the surface of the water, to so many bars of red hot iron;
each bar, in∣deed, infinitely small, but not the less powerful? In this
case, wherever a ray of fire darts, the water, from its repulsive quality,
will be driven on all sides; and, of consequence, as in the case of the
bar of iron, a part of it will rise. The <PB N="371" REF="394"/> parts thus
rising, however, will be extremely small; as the ray that darts is
extremely so. The assemblage of the rays darting upon the water in this
manner, will cause it to rise in a light thin steam above the surface;
and as the parts of this steam are extremely minute, they will be lighter
than air, and, consequently, float upon it. There is no need for
supposing them bubbles of water, filled with fire; for any sub∣stance,
even gold itself, will float on air, if its parts be made small enough; or,
in other words, if its surface be sufficiently encreased. This water,
thus disengaged from the general mass, will be still farther attenuated
and broken by the reflected rays, and, consequently, more adapted for
ascending.</P>
<P>From this plain account, every appearance in evaporation may be
easily deduced. The quantity of heat encreases evaporation, because it
raises a greater quantity of steam. The quan∣tity of wind encreases
evaporation; for, by waving the surface of the water, it thus exposes a
greater surface to the evaporating rays. A dry frost, in some measure,
assists the quantity of evaporation; as the quantity of rays are found to
be no way diminished thereby. Moist wea∣ther alone prevents evaporation;
for the rays being absorbed, refracted, and broken, by the 
<PB N="372" REF="395"/> intervening moisture, before they arrive at the
surface, cannot produce the effect; and the va∣pour will rise in a small
proportion.</P>
<P>Thus far we have accounted for the ascent of vapours; but to
account for their falling again, is attended with rather more difficulty. We
have already observed, that the particles of va∣pour, disengaged from the
surface of the water, will be broken and attenuated in their ascent, by the
reflected, and even the direct rays, that happen to strike upon their minute
surfaces. They will, therefore, continue to ascend, till they rise above
the operation of the reflected rays, which reaches but to a certain height
above the surface of the earth. Being arrived at this region, which is cold
for want of reflected heat, they will be condensed, and suspended in the
form of clouds. Some vapours that ascend to great heights, will be frozen
into snow; others, that are condensed lower down, will put on the
appearance of a mist, which we find the clouds to be, when we ascend among
them, as they hang along the sides of a mountain. These clouds of snow
and rain, being blown about by winds, are either entirely scattered and
dispersed above, or they are still more condensed by motion, like a
snow-ball, that grows more large and solid as it continues to roll. At
last, therefore, they will <PB N="373" REF="396"/> become too weighty for the
air which first raised them, to sustain; and they will descend, with
their excess of weight, either in snow or rain. But as they will fall
precipitately, when they be∣gin to descend, the air, in some measure,
will resist the falling; for, as the descending fluid gathers velocity in
its precipitation, the air will encrease its resistance to it, and the
water will, therefore, be thus broken into rain; as we see, that water which
falls from the tops of houses, though it begins in a spout, separates
into drops before it has got to the bottom. Were it not for this happy
interposition of the air, between us and the water falling from a
considerable height above us, a drop of rain might fall with dangerous force,
and an hail-stone might strike us with fatal rapidity.</P>
<P>In this manner, evaporation is produced by day; but when the sun
goes down, a part of that vapour which his rays had excited, being no lon∣ger
broken, and attenuated by the reflecting rays, it will become heavier than the
air, even before it has reached the clouds; and it will, therefore, fall back
in dews, which differ only from rain in descending before they have had time
to condense into a visible form.</P>
<P>Hail, the Cartesians say, is a frozen cloud, half melted, and
frozen again in its descent. <PB N="374" REF="397"/> An hoar-frost is but a
frozen dew. Lightening we know to be an electrical flash, produced by the
opposition of two clouds: and thunder to be the sound proceeding from the
same, continued by an echo reverberated among them. It would be to very
little purpose, to attempt explaining exactly how these wonders are
effected: we have as yet but little insight into the manner in which these
meteors are found to operate upon each other; and, therefore, we must be
contented with a detail rather of their effects than their causes.</P>
<P>In our own gentle climate, where Nature wears the mildest and
kindest aspect, every me∣teor seems to befriend us. With us, rains fall
in refreshing showers, to enliven our fields, and to paint the landscape
with a more vivid beauty. Snows cover the earth, to preserve its tender
ve∣getables from the inclemency of the departing winter. The dews descend
with such an imper∣ceptible fall as no way injures the constitution.
Thunder itself is seldom injurious; and it is often wished by the
husbandman, to clear the air, and to kill numberless insects that are
noxious to ve∣getation. Hail is the most injurious meteor that is known in
our climate; but it seldom visits us with violence, and then its fury is
but transient.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="398"/>One of the most dreadful storms we hear
of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p. 147.</BIBL></NOTE>,
was that at Hertfordshire, in the year 1697. It began by thunder and
lightening, which con∣tinued for some hours, when suddenly a black cloud
came forward, against the wind, and marked its passage with
devastation. The hail-stones which it poured down, being measured, were
found to be many of them fourteen inches round, and, consequently, as large
as a bowling-green ball. Wherever it came, every plantation fell before it; it
tore up the ground, split great oaks, and other trees, without number; the
fields of rye were cut down, as if levelled with a scythe; wheat, oats, and
barley, suffered the same damage. The inhabitants found but a pre∣carious
shelter, even in their houses, their tiles and windows being broke by the
violence of the hail-stones, which, by the force with which they came,
seemed to have descended from a great height. The birds, in this
universal wreck, vainly tried to escape by flight; pidgeons, crows, rooks,
and much more of the smaller and feebler kinds, were brought down. An unhappy
young man, who had not time to take shelter, was killed; one of his eyes was
struck out of his head, and his body was all over black with the bruises:
another had just time to escape, but not <PB N="376" REF="399"/> without the
most imminent danger, his body being bruised all over. But what is most
ex∣traordinary, all this fell within the compass of a mile.</P>
<P>Mezeray, in his History of France, tells us of a shower of hail
much more terrible, which hap∣pened in the year 1510, when the French mo∣narch
invaded Italy. There was, for a time, an horrid darkness, thicker than that
of midnight, which continued till the terrors of mankind were changed to
still more terrible objects, by thunder and lightening breaking the gloom,
and bringing on such a shower of hail, as no history of human calamities
could equal. These hail-stones were of a bluish colour; and some of
them weighed not less than an hundred pounds. A noisome vapour of sulphur
attended the storm. All the birds and beasts of the country were entirely
destroyed. Numbers of the hu∣man race suffered the same fate. But what is
still more extraordinary, the fishes themselves found no protection from
their native element; but were equal sufferers in the general cala∣mity.</P>
<P>These, however, are terrors that are seldom exerted in our mild
climates. They only serve to mark the page of history with wonder; and
stand as admonitions to mankind, of the va∣rious stores of punishment in
the hands of the <PB N="377" REF="400"/> Deity, which his power can treasure
up, and his mercy can suspend.</P>
<P>In the temperate zones, therefore, meteors are rarely found thus
terrible; but between the tro∣pics, and near the poles, they assume very
dread∣ful and various appearances. In those incle∣ment regions, where cold
and heat exert their chief power, meteors seem peculiarly to have fixed their
residence. They are seen there in a thousand terrifying forms,
astonishing to Eu∣ropeans, yet disregarded by the natives, from their
frequency. The wonders of air, fire, and water, are there combined, to produce
the most tremendous effects; and to sport with the la∣bours and
apprehensions of mankind. Lighten∣ings, that flash without noise;
hurricanes, that tear up the earth; clouds, that all at once pour down their
contents, and produce an instant de∣luge; mock suns; northern lights, that
illumi∣nate half the hemisphere; circular rainbows; halo's; fleeting balls of
fire; clouds, reflecting back the images of things on earth, like mirrors; and
water-spouts, that burst from the sea, to join with the mists that hang
immediately above them. These are but a part of the phaenomena that are
common in those countries; and from many of which, our own climate is, in a
great measure, exempted.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="401"/>The meteors of the torrid zone, however, are
different from those that are found near the po∣lar circles: and it may
readily be supposed, that in those countries where the sun exerts the
greatest force in raising vapours of all kinds, there should be the
greatest quantity of me∣teors. Upon the approach of the winter months, as
they are called, under the line, which usually begin about May, the sky,
from a fiery brightness, begins to be overcast, and the whole horizon
seems wrapt in a muddy cloud. Mists and vapours still continue to rise;
and the air, which so lately before was clear and elastic, now becomes
humid, obscure, and stifling: the fogs become so thick, that the light of
the sun seems in a manner excluded; nor would its pre∣sence be known, but
for the intense and suffocat∣ing heat of its beams, which dart through the
gloom, and, instead of dissipating, only serve to encrease the
mist. After this preparation, there follows an almost continual
succession of thunder, rain, and tempests. During this dreadful
sea∣son, the streets of cities flow like rivers; and the whole country
wears the appearance of an ocean. The inhabitants often make use of this
oppor∣tunity to lay in a stock of fresh water, for the rest of the year;
as the same cause which pours <PB N="379" REF="402"/> down the deluge at one
season, denies the kindly shower at another. The thunder which attends
the fall of these rains, is much more terrible than that we are generally
acquainted with. With us, the flash is seen at some distance, and the
noise shortly after ensues; our thunder gene∣nerally rolls on one quarter
of the sky, and one stroke pursues another. But here it is other∣wise;
the whole sky, all around, seems illumi∣nated with unremitted flashes of
lightening; every part of the air seems productive of its own thunders; and
every cloud produces its own shock. The strokes come so thick, that the
inhabitants can scarce mark the intervals; but all is one unremitted roar of
elementary con∣fusion. It should seem, however, that the light∣ening of
those countries is not so fatal, or so dangerous, as with us; since, in
this case, the torrid zone would be uninhabitable.</P>
<P>When these terrors have ceased, with which, however, the natives
are familiar, meteors of another kind begin to make their appearance. The
intense beams of the sun, darting upon stagnant waters, that generally
cover the surface of the country, raise vapours of various kinds. Floating
bodies of fire, which assume different names, rather from their accidental
forms, than from any real difference between them, are seen 
<PB N="380" REF="403"/> without surprize. The draco volans, or flying dragon,
as it is called; the ignis fatuus, or wandering fire; the fires of St. Helmo,
or the mariner's light, are every where fre∣quent; and of these we have
numberless de∣scriptions. 
<Q REND="inline">"As I was riding in Jamaica," says, Mr. Barbham,
"one morning from my habitation, situated about three miles north∣west from
Jago de la Bega, I saw a ball of fire, appearing to me of the bigness of a
bomb, swiftly falling down with a great blaze. At first I thought it fell
into the town; but when I came nearer, I saw many people gathered to∣gether,
a little to the southward, in the Sa∣vannah, to whom I rode up, to enquire
the cause of their meeting: they were admiring, as I found, the ground's
being strangely broke up and ploughed by a ball of fire; which, as they
said, fell down there. I observed there were many holes in the ground; one
in the middle of the bigness of a man's head, and five or six smaller
round about it, of the bigness of one's fist, and so deep as not to be
fathomed by such implements as were at hand. It was ob∣served, also, that
all the green herbage was burnt up, near the holes; and there continued a
strong smell of sulphur near the place, for some time after."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="404"/>Ulloa gives an account of one of a similar
kind, at Quito<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i. p.
41.</BIBL></NOTE>. 
<Q REND="inline">"About nine at night," says he, "a globe of fire
appeared to rise from the side of the mountain Pichinca, and so large,
that it spread a light over all the part of the city facing that mountain.
The house where I lodged, looking that way, I was surprized with an
extraordinary light, darting through the crevices of the window-shutters. On
this ap∣pearance, and the bustle of the people, in the street, I hastened
to the window, and came time enough to see it, in the middle of its ca∣reer;
which continued from west to south, till I lost sight of it, being
intercepted by a moun∣tain, that lay between me and it. It was round; and its
apparent diameter about a foot. I ob∣served it to rise from the sides of
Pichinca; although, to judge from its course, it was be∣hind that mountain
where this congeries of in∣flammable matter was kindled. In the first half of
its visible course it emitted a prodigious effulgence, then it began
gradually to grow dim; so that, upon its disappearing behind the
intervening mountain, its light was very faint."</Q></P>
<P>Meteors, of this kind, are very frequently seen between the
tropics; but they sometimes, also, visit the more temperate regions of
Eu∣rope. We have the description of a very ex∣traordinary 
<PB N="382" REF="405"/> one, given us by Montanari, that serves to shew to
what great heights, in our atmosphere, these vapours are found to ascend.
In the year 1676, a great globe of fire was seen at Bononia, in Italy, about
three quarters of an hour after sun-set. It past westward, with a
most rapid course, and at the rate of not less than a hundred and sixty
miles in a minute, which is much swifter than the force of a can∣non-ball,
and, at last, stood over the Adriatic sea. In its course it crossed
over all Italy; and, by computation, it could not have been less than
thirty-eight miles above the surface of the earth. In the whole line of its
course, wherever it approached, the inhabitants below could di∣stinctly
hear it, with a hissing noise, resembling that of a fire-work. Having
past away to sea, towards Corsica, it was heard, at last, to go off
with a most violent explosion, much louder than that of a cannon; and,
immediately after, ano∣ther noise was heard, like the rattling of a great
cart, upon a stony pavement; which was, pro∣bably, nothing more than the echo
of the for∣mer sound. Its magnitude, when at Bononia, appeared twice as long
as the moon, one way; and as broad the other; so that, considering its
height, it could not have been less than a mile long, and half a mile broad.
From the height <PB N="383" REF="406"/> at which this was seen, and there
being no vol∣cano, on that quarter of the world, from whence it came, it is
more than probable that this terrible globe was kindled on some part of the
contrary side of the globe, in those regions of vapours, which we have been
just describing; and thus, rising above the air, and passing, in a
course opposite to that of the earth's motion, in this manner it acquired
its amazing rapidity.</P>
<P>To these meteors, common enough south∣ward, we will add one more
of a very uncommon kind, which was seen, by Ulloa, at Quito, in Peru; the
beauty of which will, in some measure, serve to relieve us, after the
description of those hideous ones preceding. 
<Q REND="inline">"At day-break," says he, "the whole mountain of
Pambamarca, where we then resided, was encompassed with very thick
clouds; which the rising of the sun dis∣persed so far, as to leave
only some vapours, too fine to be seen. On the side opposite to the
rising sun, and about ten fathoms distant from the place where we were
standing, we saw, as in a looking-glass, each his own image; the head
being, as it were, the center of three cir∣cular rainbows, one without the
other, and just near enough to each other as that the colours of the internal
verged upon those more ex∣ternal; while round all was a circle of white, 
<PB N="384" REF="407"/> but with a greater space between. In this man∣ner
these circles were erected, like a mirror, before us; and as we moved, they
moved, in disposition and order. But, what is most re∣markable, though we
were six in number, every one saw the phenomenon, with regard to
him∣self, and not that relating to others. The dia∣meter of the arches
gradually altered, as the sun rose above the horizon; and the whole, after
continuing a long time, insensibly faded away. In the beginning, the
diameter of the inward iris, taken from its last colour, was about five
degrees and a half; and that of the white arch, which surrounded the rest,
was not less than sixty-seven degrees. At the beginning of the
phenomenon, the arches seemed of an oval or eliptical figure, like the disk
of the sun; and afterwards became perfectly circular. Each of these was of
a red colour, bordered with an orange; and the last bordered by a bright
yel∣low, which altered into a straw colour, and this turned to a green; but,
in all, the external colour remained red."</Q> Such is the description of one
of the most beautiful illusions that has been ever seen in nature. This
alone seems to have combined all the splendours of optics in one view. To
understand the manner, therefore, how this phaenomena was produced, 
<PB N="385" REF="408"/> would require a perfect knowledge of optics; which it is
not our present province to enter upon. It will be sufficient here,
therefore, only to observe, that all these appearances arise from the
density of the cloud, together with its uncommon and peculiar situation,
with respect to the spectator and the sun. It may be observed, that but
one of these three rain∣bows was real, the rest being only reflections
thereof. It may also be observed, that when∣ever the spectator stands
between the sun and a cloud of falling rain, a rainbow is seen, which is
nothing more than the reflection of the dif∣ferent coloured rays of light from
the bosom of the cloud. If, for instance, we take a glass globe, filled
with water, and hang it up before us, opposite the sun, in many
situations, it will appear transparent; but if it is raised higher, or
sideways, to an angle of forty-five degrees, it will at first appear red;
altered a very little higher, yellow; then green, then blue, then violet
colour; in short, it will assume successively all the colours of
the rainbow; but, if raised higher, still it will become transparent
again. A falling shower may be considered as an infinite number of these
little transparent globes, assuming dif∣ferent colours, by being placed
at the proper heights. The rest of the shower will appear 
<PB N="386" REF="409"/> transparent, and no part of it will seem coloured;
but such as are at angles of forty-five degrees from the eye, forty-five
degrees upward, forty-five degrees on each side, and forty-five degrees
downward, did not the plain of the earth pre∣vent us. We, therefore, see only
an arch of the rainbow, the lower part being cut off from our sight by the
earth's interposition. However, upon the tops of very high mountains,
circular rainbows are seen, because we can see to an angle of forty-five
degrees downward, as well as upward, or sideways, and therefore we take in
the rainbow's complete circle.</P>
<P>In those forlorn regions, round the poles, the meteors, though of
another kind, are not less numerous and alarming. When the winter begins, and
the cold prepares to set in, the same misty appearance which is produced
in the southern climates by the heat, is there produced by the contrary
extreme<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Paul Egede's History of
Greenland.</BIBL></NOTE>. The sea smokes like an oven, and a fog arises,
which mariners call the frost smoke. This cutting mist most commonly
raises blisters on several parts of the body; and, as soon as it is
wafted to some colder part of the atmosphere, it freezes to little icy
particles, which are driven by the wind, and create such a cutting cold on
land, that <PB N="387" REF="410"/> the limbs of the inhabitants are sometimes
frozen, and drop off.</P>
<P>There also, halos, or luminous circles round the moon, are oftener
seen than in any other part of the earth, being formed by the frost
smoke; although the air otherwise seems to be clear. A lunar rainbow
also, is often seen there, though somewhat different from that which is
common with us; as it appears of a pale white, striped with grey. In these
countries also, the aurora borealis streams, with peculiar lustre, and
variety of colours. In Greenland it gene∣rally arises in the east, and
darts its sportive fires, with variegated beauty, over the whole horizon. Its
appearance is almost constant in winter; and, at those seasons when
the sun departs, to return no more for half a year, this meteor kindly
rises to supply its beams, and affords sufficient light for all the
purposes of existence. However, in the very midst of their tedious night,
the inhabitants are not entirely forsaken. The tops of the mountains are
often seen painted with the red rays of the sun; and the poor Greenlander
from thence begins to date his chronology. It would appear whimsical to read
a Greenland calendar, in which we might be told, that one of their chiefs,
having lived forty days, died, at last, of a good old age; and 
<PB N="388" REF="411"/> that his widow continued for half a day, to deplore his
loss, with great fidelity, before she admitted a second husband.</P>
<P>The meteors of the day, in these countries, are not less
extraordinary than those of the night: mock suns are often reflected upon
an opposite cloud; and the ignorant spectator fan∣cies that there are often
three or four real suns in the firmament at the same time. In this
splen∣did appearance the real sun is always readily known by its superior
brightness, every reflexion being seen with diminished splendour. The
solar rainbow there is often seen different from ours. Instead of a
pleasing variety of colours, it appears of a pale white, edged with a
stripe of dusky yellow; the whole being reflected from the bosom of a
frozen cloud.</P>
<P>But, of all the meteors which mock the imagi∣nation with an
appearance of reality, those strange illusions that are seen there, in
fine serene wea∣ther, are the most extraordinary and entertain∣ing. 
<Q REND="inline">"Nothing," says Krantz, "ever surprized me more,
than, on a fine warm summer's day, to perceive the islands that lie four
leagues west of our shore, putting on a form quite different from what they
are known to have. As I stood gazing upon them, they appeared, at first,
infi∣nitely greater than what they naturally are; and seemed as if I viewed
them through a large <PB N="389" REF="412"/> magnifying glass. They were not
thus only made larger, but brought nearer to me. I plainly descried every
stone upon the land, and all the furrows filled with ice, as if I stood
close by. When this illusion had lasted for a while, the prospect
seemed to break up, and a new scene of wonder to present itself. The
islands seemed to travel to the shore, and represented a wood, or a
tall cut hedge. The scene then shifted, and shewed the appearance of all
sorts of curious figures; as ships with sails, streamers, and flags;
antique elevated castles, with decayed turrets; and a thousand forms, for
which fancy found a resemblance in nature. When the eye had been satisfied
with gazing, the whole groupe of riches seemed to rise in air, and at
length vanish into nothing. At such times the weather is quite serene and
clear; but comprest with such subtle vapours, as it is in very hot
weather; and these appearing be∣tween the eye and the object, give it all
that variety of appearances which glasses of dif∣ferent refrangibilities
would have done."</Q> Mr. Krantz observes that, commonly a couple of hours
afterwards, a gentle west wind and a visible mist follows, which puts an
end to this <HI>lusus naturae.</HI></P>
<P>It were easy to swell this catalogue of meteors 
<PB N="390" REF="413"/> with the names of many others, both in our own climate
and in other parts of the world. Such as falling stars, which are thought to
be no more than unctuous vapours, raised from the earth to small heights,
and continuing to shine till that matter which first raised, and
supported them, being burnt out, they fall back again to the earth, with
extinguished flame. Burning spears, which are a peculiar kind of aurora
borealis; bloody rains which are said to be the excrements of an insect,
that at that time has been raised into the air. Showers of stones,
fishes, and ivy-berries, at first, no doubt, raised into the air by
tem∣pests, in one country, and falling at some con∣siderable distance,
in the manner of rain, to astonish another. But omitting these, of which
we know little more than what is thus briefly mentioned, I will conclude this
chapter with the description of a water-spout; a most sur∣prizing
phenomenon; not less dreadful to ma∣riners than astonishing to the
observer of na∣ture.</P>
<P>These spouts are seen very commonly in the tropical seas,
and sometimes in our own. Those seen by Tournefort, in the
Mediter∣ranean, he has described as follows. 
<Q REND="inline">"The first of these," says this great
botanist, "that we saw, was about a musket-shot from our ship. 
<PB N="391" REF="414"/> There we perceived the water began to boil, and to
rise about a foot above its level. The water was agitated and whitish; and
above its surface there seemed to stand a smoke, such as might be
imagined to come from wet straw before it begins to blaze. It made a sort
of a murmuring sound, like that of a torrent, heard at a distance, mixed,
at the same time, with an hissing noise, like that of a serpent:
shortly after we perceived a column of this smoke rise up to the clouds,
at the same time whirling about with great rapidity. It appeared to be as
thick as one's finger; and the former sound still continued. When this
disappeared, after lasting for about eight minutes, upon turning to the
opposite quarter of the sky, we perceived another, which began in the
manner of the former; presently after a third appeared in the west; and
instantly beside it still another arose. The most distant of
these three could not be above a musket-shot from the ship. They all
continued like so many heaps of wet straw set on fire, that continued to
smoke, and to make the same noise as before. We soon after per∣ceived
each, with its respective canal, mount∣ing up in the clouds, and spreading
where it touched; the cloud, like the mouth of a trum∣pet, making a figure, to
express it intelligibly, <PB N="392" REF="415"/> as if the tail of an animal
were pulled at one end by a weight. These canals were of a whitish colour,
and so tinged, as I suppose, by the water which was contained in them;
for, previous to this, they were apparently empty, and of the colour of
transparent glass. These canals were not straight, but bent in some
parts, and far from being perpendicular, but rising in their clouds with a
very inclined ascent. But what is very particular, the cloud to which one of
them was pointed happening to be driven by the wind, the spout still
continued to follow its motion, without being broken; and passing behind
one of the others, the spouts crossed each other, in the form of a St.
Andrew's cross. In the beginning they were all about as thick as one's
finger, except at the top, where they were broader, and two of them
dis∣appeared; but shortly after, the last of the three encreased
considerably; and its canal, which was at first so small, soon became
as thick as a man's arm, then as his leg, and at last thicker than his whole
body. We saw distinctly, through this transparent body, the water, which
rose up with a kind of spiral motion; and it sometimes diminished a
little of its thickness, and again resumed the same; some∣times
widening at top, and sometimes at bot∣tom; <PB N="393" REF="416"/> exactly
resembling a gut filled with water, pressed with the fingers, to make the
fluid rise, or fall; and I am well convinced, that this al∣teration in the
spout was caused by the wind, which pressed the cloud, and impelled it
to give up its contents. After some time its bulk was so diminished as to
be no thicker than a man's arm again; and thus, swelling and diminish∣ing,
it at last became very small. In the end, I observed the sea which was
raised about it to resume its level by degrees, and the end of the canal
that touched it to become as small as if it had been tied round with a cord;
and this continued till the light, striking through the cloud, took away the
view. I still, however, continued to look, expecting that its parts would
join again, as I had before seen in one of the others, in which the spout
was more than once broken, and yet again came together; but I was
disappointed, for the spout appeared no more."</Q></P>
<P>Many have been the solutions offered for this surprizing
appearance. Mr. Buffon supposes the spout, here described, to proceed
from the operation of fire, beneath the bed of the sea; as the waters at the
surface are thus seen agi∣tated. However, the solution of Dr. Stuart is
not divested of probability; who thinks it may <PB N="394" REF="417"/> be
accounted for by suction, as in the applica∣tion of a cupping-glass to the
skin.</P>
<P>Wherever spouts of this kind are seen they are extremely dreaded
by mariners; for if they happen to fall upon a ship they most commonly
dash it to the bottom. But, if the ship be large enough to sustain the
deluge, they are at least sure to destroy its sails and rigging, and
render it un∣fit for sailing. It is said that vessels of any force
usually fire their guns at them, loaden with a bar of iron; and, if so
happy as to strike them, the water is instantly seen to fall from them,
with a dreadful noise, though without any further mischief.</P>
<P>I am at a loss whether we ought to reckon these spouts called
typhons; which are some∣times seen at land, of the same kind with those
so often described by mariners, at sea. as they seem to differ in
several respects. That, for instance, observed at Hatfield, in
Yorkshire, in 1687, as it is described by the person who saw it,
seems rather to have been a whirlwind than a water-spout. The season in
which it appeared was very dry, the weather extremely hot, and the air very
cloudy. After the wind had blown for some time, with con∣siderable force,
and condensed the black clouds one upon another, a great whirling of the air 
<PB N="395" REF="418"/> ensued; upon which the center of the clouds, every now
and then, darted down, in the shape of a thick long black pipe; in which the
re∣lator could distinctly view a motion, like that of a screw, continually
screwing up to itself, as it were, whatever it happened to touch. In its
progress it moved slowly over a grove of young trees, which it violently
bent, in a cir∣cular motion. Going forward to a barn, it in a minute stript
it of all the thatch, and filled the whole air with the same. As it came near
the relator, he perceived that its blackness pro∣ceeded from a gyration of
the clouds, by con∣trary winds, meeting in a point, or a center; and where the
greatest force was exerted, there darting down, like an Archimedes's screw,
to suck up all that came in its way. Another which he saw, some time
after, was attended with still more terrible effects; levelling, or tearing
up great oak trees, catching up the birds in its vortex, and dashing them
against the ground. In this manner it proceeded, with an audible whirling
noise, like that of a mill; and, at length, dissolved, after having done
much mischief.</P>
<P>But we must still continue to suspend our assent as to
the nature even of these land spouts; <PB N="396" REF="419"/> since they
have been sometimes found to drop, in a great column of water, at once upon
the earth, and produce an instant inundation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. iv, p. 2, 108.</BIBL></NOTE>, which
could not readily have happened had they been caused by the gyration of a
whirl∣wind only. Indeed, every conjecture, regard∣ing these meteors, seems
to me entirely unsa∣tisfactory. They sometimes appear in the calmest
weather at sea, of which I have been an eye-witness; and, therefore,
these are not caused by a whirlwind. They are always capped by a cloud;
and, therefore, are not likely to pro∣ceed from fires at the bottom. They
change place; and, therefore, suction seems imprac∣ticable. In short, we
still want facts, upon which to build a rational theory; and, instead of
knowledge, we must be contented with ad∣miration. To be well acquainted with
the ap∣pearances of Nature, even though we are ig∣norant of their causes,
often constitutes the most useful wisdom.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus gone through a particular description of the earth,
let us now pause for a moment, to contemplate the great picture be∣fore us.
The universe may be considered as the palace in which the Deity resides;
and this earth as one of its apartments. In this, all the meaner races of
animated nature mechanically obey him; and stand ready to execute his
com∣mands, without hesitation. Man alone is found refractory; he is the only
being endued with a power of contradicting these mandates. The Deity was
pleased to exert superior power in creating him a superior being; a being
endued with a choice of good and evil; and capable, in some measure, of
co-operating with his own in∣tentions. Man, therefore, may be considered as a
limited creature, endued with powers imita∣tive of those residing in the
Deity. He is thrown into a world that stands in need of his help; and has
been granted a power of producing harmony from partial confusion.</P>
<P>If, therefore, we consider the earth as al∣lotted for our
habitation, we shall find, that much has been given us to enjoy, and much 
<PB N="398" REF="421"/> to amend; that we have ample reasons for our
gratitude, and still more for our industry. In those great outlines of
nature, to which art can∣not reach, and where our greatest efforts must
have been ineffectual, God himself has finished these with amazing
grandeur and beauty. Our be∣neficent Father has considered these parts of
nature as peculiarly his own; as parts which no creature could have skill or
strength to amend: and therefore, made them incapable of alteration, or of
more perfect regularity. The heavens, and the firmament, shew the wisdom,
and the glory of the Workman. Astronomers, who are best skilled in the
symmetry of systems, can find nothing there that they can alter for the
better. God made these perfect, because no subordinate being could
correct their defects.</P>
<P>When, therefore, we survey nature on this side, nothing can be
more splendid, more cor∣rect, or amazing. We there behold a Deity residing
in the midst of an universe, infinitely extended every way, animating all,
and cheer∣ing the vacuity with his presence! We behold an immense and
shapeless mass of matter, formed into worlds by his power, and
dispersed at inter∣vals, to which even the imagination cannot travel! In
this great theatre of his glory, a thou∣sand suns, like our own, animate
their respec∣tive <PB N="399" REF="422"/> systems, appearing and
vanishing at divine command. We behold our own bright lumi∣nary, fixed in the
center of its system, wheeling its planets in times proportioned to their
di∣stances, and at once dispensing light, heat, and action. The earth
also is seen with its twofold motion; producing, by the one, the change of
seasons; and, by the other, the grateful vicissi∣tudes of day and
night. With what silent mag∣nificence is all this performed! with what
seem∣ing ease! The works of art are exerted with inter∣rupted force; and
their noisy progress discovers the obstructions they receive: but the
earth, with a silent steady rotation, successively presents every
part of its bosom to the sun; at once im∣bibing nourishment and light
from that parent of vegetation and fertility.</P>
<P>But not only provisions of heat and light are thus supplied, but
its whole surface is covered with a transparent atmosphere, that turns
with its motion, and guards it from external injury. The rays of the sun are
thus broken into a ge∣nial warmth; and, while the surface is assisted,
a gentle heat is produced in the bowels of the earth, which contributes to
cover it with ver∣dure. Waters also are supplied in healthful abundance, to
support life, and assist vegetation. Mountains arise, to diversify
the prospect, and <PB N="400" REF="423"/> give a current to the stream. Seas
extend from one continent to the other, replenished with ani∣mals, that may
be turned to human support; and also serving to enrich the earth with a
suffi∣ciency of vapour. Breezes fly along the surface of the fields, to
promote health and vegetation. The coolness of the evening invites to rest;
and the freshness of the morning renews for labour.</P>
<P>Such are the delights of the habitation that has been assigned
to man; without any one of these, he must have been wretched; and none of
these could his own industry have supplied. But while many of his wants
are thus kindly furnished, on the one hand, there are numberless
inconvenien∣cies to excite his industry on the other. This habitation, though
provided with all the conve∣niencies of air, pasturage, and water, is but a
desert place, without human cultivation. The lowest animal finds more
conveniencies in the wilds of nature, than he who boasts himself their
lord. The whirlwind, the inundation, and all the asperities of the air, are
peculiarly terrible to man, who knows their consequences, and, at a
distance, dreads their approach. The earth it∣self, where human art has not
pervaded, puts on a frightful gloomy appearance. The forests are dark and
tangled; the meadows over-grown with rank weeds; and the brooks stray without
a de∣termined <PB N="401" REF="424"/> channel. Nature, that has been kind to
every lower order of beings, has been quite neglectful with regard to him; to
the savage uncontriving man the earth is an abode of de∣solation, where his
shelter is insufficient, and his food precarious.</P>
<P>A world thus furnished with advantages on one side, and
inconveniences on the other, is the proper abode of reason, is the fittest
to exercise the industry of a free and a thinking creature. These evils,
which art can remedy, and pre∣science guard against, are a proper call for
the exertion of his faculties; and they tend still more to assimilate him
to his Creator. God beholds, with pleasure, that being which he has made,
converting the wretchedness of his natu∣ral situation into a theatre of
triumph; bring∣ing all the headlong tribes of nature into sub∣jection to his
will; and producing that order and uniformity upon earth, of which his own
heavenly fabric is so bright an example.</P>
