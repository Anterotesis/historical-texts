<L>HIP! music! music!—Have you more to play?</L>
<L>Somewhat I'd offer—Stop your cat-gut, pray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Will you permit, and not pronounce me rude,</L>
<L>A bookseller one moment to intrude?</L>
<L>My name is Fools-cap:—Since you saw me last,</L>
<L>Fortune hath given me a rare helping cast.</L>
<L>To all my toils a wife hath put a stop—</L>
<L>A devil then; but now I keep a shop.</L>
<L>My master died, poor man!—He's out of print!</L>
<L>His widow,—she had eyes and took my hint.</L>
<L>A prey to grief, she could not bear to be,</L>
<L>And so turn'd over a new leaf with me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I drive a trade; have authors in my pay,</L>
<L>Men of all work, per week, per sheet, per day.</L>
<L>TRAV'LLERS—who not one foreign country know:</L>
<L>And PAST'RAL POETS—in the sound of Bow.</L>
<L>TRANSLATORS—From the Greek they never read</L>
<L>CANTABS and SOPHS—in Covent Garden bred.</L>
<L>HISTORIANS, who can't write;—who only take</L>
<L>Scissars and paste;—cut, vamp; a book they make.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I've treated for this play; can buy it too,</L>
<L>If I could learn what you intend to do.</L>
<L>If for nine nights you'll bear this tragic stuff;</L>
<L>I have a news-paper, and there can puff.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A news-paper does wonders!—None can be</L>
<L>In debt, in love, dependant or quite free,</L>
<L>Ugly or handsome, well, or ill in bed,</L>
<L>Single or married, or alive or dead,</L>
<L>But we give life, death, virtue, vice with ease;</L>
<L>In short a news-paper does what we please.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<L>There jealous authors at each other bark;</L>
<L>Till truth leaves not one glimpse, no, not one spark;</L>
<L>But lies meet lies and justle in the dark.</L>
<L>Our bard within has often felt the dart</L>
<L>Sent from our quiver, levell'd at his heart.</L>
<L>I've press'd him, ere he plays this desp'rate game,</L>
<L>To answer all, and vindicate his name.</L>
<L>But he, convinc'd that all but truth must die,</L>
<L>Leaves to its own mortality the lie.</L>
<L>Would any know,—while parties fight pellmell,</L>
<L>How he employs his pen?—his play will tell.</L>
<L>To that he trusts; that he submits to you,</L>
<L>Aim'd at your tend'rest feelings,—moral,—new.</L>
<L>The scenes, he hopes, will draw the heart-felt tear;</L>
<L>Scenes that come home to ev'ry bosom here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If this will do, I'll run and buy it straight;</L>
<L>Stay—Let me see;—I think I'd better wait—</L>
<L>Yes;—I'll lie snug, till you have fix'd it's fate.</L>

<L>THE GRECIAN DAUGHTER'S compliments to all;</L>
<L>Begs that for Epilogue you will not call;</L>
<L>For leering, giggling would be out of season,</L>
<L>And hopes by me you'll hear a little reason.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A father rais'd from death, a nation sav'd,</L>
<L>A tyrant's crimes by female spirit brav'd,</L>
<L>That tyrant stabb'd, and by her nerveless arm,</L>
<L>While Virtue's spell surrounding guards could charm!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<L>Can she, this sacred tumult in her breast,</L>
<L>Turn Father, Freedom, Virtue, all to jest?</L>
<L>Wake you, ye fair ones, from your sweet repose,</L>
<L>As wanton zephyrs wake the sleeping rose;</L>
<L>Dispel those clouds, which o'er your eyelids crept,</L>
<L>Which our wise Bard mistook, and swore you wept.</L>
<L>Shall she to MACARONIES life restore,</L>
<L>Who yawn'd, half dead, and curs'd the tragic BORE?</L>
<L>Dismiss 'em, smirking, to their nightly haunt,</L>
<L>Where dice and cards their moon-struck minds enchant?</L>
<L>Some muffled, like the witches in Macbeth,</L>
<L>Brood o'er the magic circle, pale as death!</L>
<L>Others, <HI>the cauldron go about—about—</HI></L>
<L>And Ruin enters, as the Fates run out!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bubble, bubble,</L>
<L>Toil and trouble,</L>
<L>Passions burn,</L>
<L>And bets are double!</L>
<L>Double! double!</L>
<L>Toil and trouble,</L>
<L>Passions burn,</L>
<L>And all is bubble!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But jests apart, for scandal forms these tales,</L>
<L>Falsehood be mute—let Justice hold her scales:</L>
<L>Britons were ne'er enslav'd by evil powr's;</L>
<L>To peace, and wedded love, they give their midnight hours;</L>
<L>From slumbers pure, no rattling dice can wake 'em!</L>
<L>Who <HI>make</HI> the laws, were never known to <HI>break</HI> 'em.</L>
<L>'Tis false, ye fair, whatever spleen may say,</L>
<L>That you down Folly's tide are borne away;</L>
<L>You never wish at deep distress to sneer;</L>
<L>For eyes, tho' bright, are brighter thro' a tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should it e'er be this Nation's wretched fate</L>
<L>To laugh at all that's good, and wise, and great;</L>
<L>Arm'd at all points, let Genius take the field,</L>
<L>And on the stage afflicted Virtue shield,</L>
<L>Drive from the land each base unworthy passion,</L>
<L>Till Virtue triumph in despite of Fashion.</L>

<L>Obdurate man!</L>
<L>Thus wilt thou spurn me, when a king distress'd;</L>
<L>A good, a virtuous, venerable king,</L>
<L>The father of his people, from a throne</L>
<L>Which long with ev'ry virtue he adorn'd,</L>
<L>Torn by a ruffian, by a tyrant's hand,</L>

<L>Lives a sequester'd prisoner?—Oh! Philotas,</L>
<L>If thou ha'st not renounc'd humanity;</L>

<L>My royal master.</L>

<SPEAKER>Melan.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou can'st not mean it—his to give the law!</L>
<L>Detested spoiler!—his!—a vile usurper!</L>
<L>Have we forgot the elder Dionysius,</L>
<L>Surnam'd the Tyrant? To Sicilia's throne</L>
<L>The monster waded thro' whole seas of blood.</L>
<L>Sore groan'd the land beneath his iron rod,</L>
<L>Till rous'd at length Evander came from Greece,</L>
<L>Like Freedom's Genius came, and sent the tyrant</L>
<L>Stript of the crown, and to his humble rank</L>
<L>Once more reduc'd, to roam, for vile subsistence,</L>
<L>A wandering sophist, thro' the realms of Greece.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philo.</SPEAKER>
<L>Melanthon, yes; full clearly I remember</L>
<L>The splendid day, when all rejoicing Sicily</L>
<L>Hail'd her deliverer.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melan.</SPEAKER>
<L>Shall the tyrant's son</L>
<L>Deduce a title from the father's guilt?</L>
<L>Philotas, thou wert once the friend of goodness;</L>
<L>Thou art a Greek; fair Corinth gave thee birth;</L>
<L>I mark'd thy growing youth; I need not tell,</L>
<L>With what an equal sway Evander reign'd,</L>
<L>How just, how upright, generous and good!</L>
<L>From ev'ry region bards and sages came;</L>
<L>Whate'er of science ancient Egypt stor'd,</L>
<L>All that the East had treasur'd; all that Greece</L>
<L>Of moral wisdom taught, and Plato's voice</L>
<L>Was heard in Sicily. Shall Dionysius</L>

<L>Bow to his yoke the necks of freeborn men,</L>
<L>And here perpetuate a tyrant's reign?</L>

<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<L>But soon that Pow'r shall cease; behold his walls</L>
<L>Now close encircled by the Grecian bands;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>Timoleon leads them on; indignant Corinth</L>
<L>Sends her avenger forth, array'd in terror,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philo.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou wert a statesman once, Melanthon; now</L>
<L>Grown dim with age, thy eye pervades no more</L>
<L>The deep-laid schemes which Dionysius plans.</L>
<L>Know then, a fleet from Carthage even now</L>
<L>Stems the rough billow, and, e'er yonder sun,</L>
<L>That now declining seeks the Western wave,</L>
<L>Shall to the shades of night resign the world,</L>
<L>Thou'lt see the Punic sails in yonder bay,</L>
<L>Whose waters wash the walls of Syracuse.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melan.</SPEAKER>
<L>Art thou a stranger to Timoleon's name?</L>
<L>Intent to plan, and circumspect to see</L>
<L>All possible events, he rushes on</L>
<L>Resistless in his course! Your boasted master</L>
<L>Scarce stands at bay; each hour the strong blockade</L>
<L>Hems him in closer, and e'er long thou'lt view</L>
<L>Oppression's iron rod to fragments shiver'd!</L>
<L>The good Evander then—</L>

<L>Alas, Evander!—</L>

<L>Thrice has the sun gone down, since last these eyes</L>
<L>Have seen the good old king; say, why is this?</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="10"/>Wherefore debarr'd his presence? Thee, Philotas,</L>

<L>Dispatch some friend, who may o'er-leap the walls,</L>
<L>And tell Timoleon, the good old Evander</L>
<L>Has liv'd three days, by Dionysius' order,</L>

<L>On the sharp summit of the pointed rock,</L>
<L>Which overhangs the deep, a dungeon drear;</L>
<L>Cell within cell, a labyrinth of horror,</L>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Tragedy, here offered to the Public, is founded on a passage in VALERIUS MAXIMUS<NOTE PLACE="foot">Vide Valer. Max. lib. 5, c. 4, <HI>de Pictate in Parentes.</HI> 7.</NOTE>. We are told by that Author, <Q>That a woman of ingenuous birth was convicted before the PRAETOR of a capital crime, and delivered over to the TRIUMVIR to be put to death in prison. The jailer received her into his custody, but, touched with compassion, did not proceed immediately to execute the sentence. His humanity went so far as to admit the daughter of the unhappy criminal into the goal; but not without a previous search, left any nourishment should be secretly conveyed. To starve the prisoner to death was his design. Several days passed, when it became a matter of wonder how the poor woman subsisted so long. The jailer's curiosity was excited: he watched the daughter narrowly, and saw her give her breast to the famished mother, and with her milk supply the cravings of nature. Touched by the novelty of so affecting a sight, he made his report to the TRIUMVIR, from whom it reached the PRAETOR, and, the whole matter being referred to the JUDICIAL MAGISTRATES, the mother received a free pardon. What will not filial piety undertake?—What place will it not penetrate?—What will it not devise, when in a dungeon it finds unheard of means to preserve a parent's life?—Is there in the course of human affairs, a scene so big with wonder, as a mother nourished at the daughter's breast?—The incident might, at the first view, be thought repugnant to the order of nature, if TO LOVE OUR PARENTS were not the FIRST LAW stamped by the hand of Nature on the human heart.</Q> Thus far VALERIUS MAXIMUS. He goes on in the same place, and tells a Greek tale, in which the heroine performs the fame act of piety to a father in the decline of life. For the purposes of the drama, the latter story has been preferred. The painters long since seized the subject,
<PB REF="80"/>
and by them it has been called ROMAN CHARITY. The Author has taken the liberty to place it in the reign of DIONYSIUS the Younger, at the point of time when TIMOLEON laid siege to SYRACUSE. The general effect, it was thought, would be better produced, if the whole had an air of real history.</P>
<Q><L>Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet,</L>
<L>Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum.</L></Q>
<P>The Author does not wish to conceal that the subject of his Tragedy has been touched in some foreign pieces: but he thinks it has been <HI>only</HI> touched. The ZELMIRE of Mons. BELLOY begins after the daughter has delivered her father out of prison. The play indeed has many beauties; and if the sentiments and business of that piece coincided with the design of THE GRECIAN DAUGHTER, the Author would not have blushed to tread in his steps. But a new fable was absolutely necessary: and, perhaps, in the present humour of the times, it is not unlucky that no more than three lines could be adopted from Mons. BELLOY. Every writer, who makes up a story with characters and incidents already hackneyed on the English stage, and invents nothing, cries out with an air of triumph, That he has not borrowed from the wits of FRANCE. In the Isle of Man, it is said, there is an epitaph in these words: <HI>"He who lies here interred, was never out of this island."</HI> The poor man was to be pitied: a similar inscription upon the tomb-stone of a modern poet would, perhaps, do as little honour to the memory of the deceased.</P>
<P>The Author cannot dismiss his Play, without declaring, that, though in love with the subject, he has not satisfied even his own ideas of the drama: he laments that he had neither time nor ability to make it better. To heighten it with additional beauties was reserved for the decorations with which the zeal of Mr. GARRICK has embellished the representation; for the admirable performance of Mr. BARRY, and, above all, for the enchanting powers and the genius of Mrs. BARRY.</P>
