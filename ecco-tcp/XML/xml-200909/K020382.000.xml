<P>AN ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND: BEING THE PROTEST OF A PRIVATE PERSON Against every SUSPENSION OF LAW that is liable to injure or endanger PERSONAL SECURITY.</P>
<P>WHEREIN IS SHEWN That the Claim of <HI>personal Protection and Relief from unjust Imprisonment,</HI> <Q>BY DUE PROCESS OF THE LAW,</Q> (and that "WITHOUT DELAY,") is a "COMMON RIGHT," so indispensably due to all <HI>innocent Persons,</HI> that it cannot be set aside, or with∣drawn from any <HI>that are so,</HI> (who demand it,) without <HI>fundamentally subverting the political Constitution,</HI> or <HI>legal Establishment of these Kingdoms,</HI> and thereby rendering the Advisers and Promoters of such a Measure <HI>guilty of</HI> HIGH-TREASON!</P>
<Q>"It is the Duty of every Individual whatsoever to aid <HI>PEACE</HI> and <HI>PUBLIC JUSTICE,</HI>" — agreeable to a MAXIM of the Law—"UNUSQUISQUE PACI ET JUSTITIAE PUBLICAE TENETUR SUCCURRERE."</Q>
<Q>"Those Men, who set aside" <HI>(or suspend)</HI> "the Law of the Land, do thereby incur a perpetual Stain of Infamy!"—For it is a funda∣mental MAXIM of the Constitution —"<HI>LEGEM TERRAE</HI> amit∣tentes perpetuam infamiae notam inde merito incurrunt."</Q>

<HEAD>TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>COMMON CHARITY will induce us to believe that the advocates for an occasional <HI>suspension</HI> of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> laws are not really aware of the dangerous tendency of such a measure; and therefore when the author of this Protest (in the following pages) charges the advisers and promoters of the sus∣pension with <Q>high-treason against the king and state,</Q> he professes to aim the severity of his censure chiefly against <HI>the measure itself,</HI> (in order to express the <HI>real danger</HI> and <HI>malignity</HI> of its ef∣fect,) rather than against the <HI>persons</HI> of those men who, inadvertently, or through inattention to the <HI>fundamental</HI> or <HI>indis∣pensable principles of law,</HI> have promoted
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
it: and therefore to <HI>those</HI> persons, joint∣ly with all the other People of England, (as being equally interested with the rest in the effects of such a measure) the au∣thor of this Protest now addresses himself, not to promote a spirit of vengeance and personal resentment, but merely for the purposes of warning and instruction to <HI>all parties,</HI> that they may cordially unite in restoring the <HI>due limitations</HI> of govern∣ment, on which depends the common safety both of king and people.</P>
<P>The Advocates for an occasional <HI>sus∣pension of the law,</HI> perhaps, will alledge, that the new <HI>temporary</HI> powers (whate∣ver they may happen to be) which would thereby be thrown into the hands of the persons intrusted with the administra∣tion of government, are by no means intended to take effect against <HI>the People of England,</HI> that are resient <HI>in</HI> this island, but only against such persons as
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
have <HI>been guilty of treason in foreign parts</HI> (in <HI>America,</HI> let us suppose, for instance) or <HI>on the high seas, or for piracy;</HI> and therefore they conceive, that the free inhabitants of this island could not be injured by so limited a <HI>suspension</HI> of the laws, especially if they should admit in their bill an additional clause of limita∣tion, proposed even by an opposite par∣ty, by way of security; which we will suppose to be couched in the following terms, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That nothing herein is intended, or shall be construed, to extend to the case of any other prisoner or pri∣soners than such as shall have <HI>BEEN OUT OF THE REALM AT THE TIME OR TIMES OF THE OFFENCE OR OFFENCES</HI> wherewith he or they shall be charged, or of which they shall be suspected.</Q> Such a clause as this seems, on a slight examination, to se∣cure the inhabitants of this island from the danger of an <HI>unlimited</HI> power, against
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
which all true Englishmen ought to be ever upon their guard: but, alas! so dan∣gerous is it to stop the ordinary course of <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>common right,</HI> or to alter the <HI>"due process of the law,"</HI> in any ca∣ses whatsoever wherein <HI>personal liberty</HI> (the highest and most valuable <HI>temporal</HI> object of Englishmen) is concerned, that, if we should <HI>suppose</HI> the case of such a <HI>suspension of the laws</HI> as courtiers in general would endeavour to obtain, were they to be intrusted with <HI>the com∣piling of a bill</HI> for that purpose, and then carefully compare the said <HI>supposed bill</HI> with the abovementioned <HI>clause of limitation,</HI> we should soon have reason to be convinced that the security of the latter is only <HI>imaginary;</HI> and that mul∣titudes of his majesty's <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>peaceable</HI> subjects would be still liable to be oppressed, and be denied the benefits of <HI>public justice</HI> and <HI>common right,</HI> by such a <HI>suspension of law,</HI> if they should happen
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
to incur the displeasure of persons in power, or be misrepresented to them by any secret enemy.</P>
<P>The proposed clause leaves unpro∣tected all the nobility, gentry, and other persons whatsoever, that have made any excursions into <HI>France, Italy, Germany, Flanders, &amp;c.</HI> or even to <HI>Ireland,</HI> ever since the commencement of the troubles (whatever they might be) which occa∣sioned an <HI>imaginary necessity,</HI> or plea, for SUSPENDING THE LAWS. And this, perhaps, might be extended three or four years back, and might thereby exclude from the protection of the limiting clause a great multitude of the most re∣spectable people of the kingdom, who might happen to have travelled abroad during such a period. Neither does the clause protect the merchants, traders, and other persons, that have arrived from the West-Indies, Ireland, or any other
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
country, within such a supposed period. And they are, surely, too numerous and respectable a body to be thus <HI>outlawed!</HI></P>
<P>Add to this, that all <HI>seafaring Persons without exception</HI> (though they are the most valuable subjects of this maritime state) would be left unprotected by such a clause, and of course would be rendered subject to the <HI>unlimited</HI> WILL <HI>of man,</HI> (ARBITRIUM <HI>hominis,</HI> which is the true definition of ARBITRARY POWER,) <HI>in∣stead</HI> of LAW! And, lastly, all other persons whatsoever are liable to suffer the same inconveniences, if they have not kept a diary, or have not memory or memo∣randums, to enable them to produce suf∣ficient evidence of their being actually WITHIN THIS REALM at any period of time that might be fixed upon within the last three or four years; so that not only persons <Q><HI>seized and taken</HI> OUT OF THE REALM</Q> would be made liable to
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
the effects of such a <HI>suspending act,</HI> but all the other persons abovementioned, though they are actually RESIENT WITHIN THE REALM.</P>
<P>In order to state the case for my argu∣ment as clearly as I am able, I have here supposed the adoption of such a <HI>suspend∣ing bill</HI> as we might naturally conceive to be proposed by any set of men in power, who are warmed by the sunshine of court-favour till they forget that their own real interest is inseparably connected with that of the public, and that the increase of power, which they promote, may possibly fall into some other hands than their own. But the hands of govern∣ment must be strengthened, they would probably say; and, for this purpose, they would be very apt to insert in their bill some discretionary powers to enable the king and his ministers to imprison not on∣ly persons <Q>seized and taken out of the
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
realm,</Q> <HI>but also persons</HI> <Q>who shall be committed in any part of his majesty's do∣minions for the said crimes,</Q> I mean, any crimes which I have before sup∣posed in stating this case, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>High-treason in any of his majesty's colonies or plantations in America, or <HI>ON THE HIGH SEAS,</HI></Q> <HI>(which will include our own coasts any where beyond low-water mark,)</HI> <Q>or the crime of piracy,</Q> without any description or limitation of place whatsoever! So that if any inno∣cent man (who happens not to be able to prove an <HI>alibi</HI> for every day, and even every hour, since these troubles began) should be maliciously <HI>"charged with"</HI> the crime of <HI>treason</HI> or <HI>piracy</HI> committed within half a mile of the British coasts, he may be seized and imprisoned, <Q>without bail or mainprize,</Q> at the <HI>will and plea∣sure</HI> of the king and council, for <HI>many months;</HI> and, at the expiration of the <HI>limited</HI> time, (without any farther exa∣mination
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
or opportunity of being heard at all by his country,) his term of con∣finement is prolonged by another <HI>such act,</HI> and perhaps another after that, (as <HI>evil</HI> examples beget others,) till the time of his relief by <Q>due process of the law</Q> becomes totally <HI>uncertain</HI> and <HI>in∣definite!</HI> — A deplorable condition this! which, in our common law, is deemed <HI>"wretched slavery;"</HI> — for, <Q>Misera est servitus</Q> <HI>(says the maxim)</HI> <Q>ubi <HI>JUS</HI> est vagum aut incertum.</Q> (<HI>Prin∣cipia leg. &amp; Aeq. p.</HI> 61.)</P>
<P>But the condition of the <HI>deluded</HI> sub∣jects will be rendered still more com∣pletely <HI>uncertain</HI> and <HI>wretched,</HI> if the compilers of the supposed suspending act should endeavour to avail themselves of <HI>vague</HI> terms and expressions: — for in∣stance, — (in the body of the bill,) — <HI>"Such crimes"</HI> (referring to the crimes particularly named in the former part)
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
instead of <HI>"the said crimes:"</HI> — for, as <HI>"Nullum simile est idem,"</HI> — <Q>( LIKE <HI>is not</HI> THE SAME,)</Q> — the expression, <HI>"such crimes,"</HI> signifies only <HI>similar crimes,</HI> and not <HI>the same crimes</HI> before expressed, whereby the power of the act would be liable to an arbitrary exten∣sion at the <HI>will</HI> of the magistrate!</P>
<P>Whenever persons in power cease to be <HI>duly limited</HI> by a free parliament, they will pay but very little regard to the grossness of the propositions which they tender to that, <HI>once,</HI> august assembly; and therefore, if such an <HI>illegal</HI> power should ever be usurped by any set of men, we may then expect to find many more <HI>vague</HI> expressions in our public acts! — We may in that case, without improbability, suppose the penning of a <HI>suspending act</HI> to be — not only <Q>for such crimes, <HI>OR ANY</HI> of them,</Q> — but also <Q>for <HI>SUSPICION</HI> of <HI>SUCH
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
 CRIMES,</HI> or any of them, by any ma∣gistrate,</Q> <HI>&amp;c. viz.</HI> any trading ma∣gistrate, pensioned Middlesex justice, or other wretched time-server, that may happen to be entrusted with a power of committing to prison. — And in such times it will afford a sufficient handle against any person whatsoever, if they are but <HI>"charged with"</HI> such crimes, whether they be guilty of them or not; or even if they be but <Q><HI>CHARGED WITH</HI></Q> the <Q><HI>SUSPICION</HI> of <HI>SUCH</HI> crimes, or any of them, by <HI>ANY</HI> ma∣gistrate, </Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — Nothing more <HI>arbitrary</HI> or <HI>capricious</HI> can easily be de∣scribed; and yet, alas! my <HI>supposed bill</HI> by no means exceeds the bounds of probability; for, when the baneful practice of <HI>bribery</HI> becomes triumphant, and the very foundations of government are thoroughly <HI>corrupted,</HI> we may ex∣pect that <HI>probability</HI> will still go farther, and that the above <HI>supposed</HI> extraordinary
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
powers will be farther augmented by a <HI>"non obstante,"</HI> to trample down at once, not only the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act,</HI> but all the other fences of British <HI>liber∣ty,</HI> national <HI>justice,</HI> and <HI>common right,</HI> on which the safety of Englishmen de∣pends! <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>any law, statute, or u∣sage, to the contrary, in any wise not∣withstanding. </Q></P>
<P>The clause is indeed a common one, for the repeal of useless or indifferent matters; but, when the effect extends to annul all the laws of <HI>personal protec∣tion,</HI> and the <HI>common right</HI> of English∣men to <HI>"the due process of the law,"</HI> (which is, to be tried <HI>without delay</HI> by their country, <HI>[per legem terrae,]</HI> and, <HI>if innocent,</HI> to be restored to freedom,) — such a <HI>suspension,</HI> I say, of <HI>common justice</HI> and <HI>common right</HI> is so fun∣damentally subversive of the British constitution of state, that no authority
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
of parliament can make it <HI>legal;</HI> because it it is <HI>high-treason</HI> against the king and people! and all the abettors and promo∣ters of such an act would thereby render themselves <HI>"eternally infamous"</HI> in the eye of the law! — which is declared by a constitutional maxim: — <Q>LEGEM TERRAE <HI>amittentes</HI> PERPETUAM IN∣FAMIAE NOTAM <HI>inde merito incur∣runt.</HI></Q> (3. inst. p. 221.)— <Q> <HI>Those men, who set aside</HI> THE LAW OF THE LAND,</Q> (which is certainly the case of those who vote for <HI>suspending</HI> it,) <Q><HI>do thereby incur a</HI> PERPETUAL STAIN <HI>of</HI> INFAMY!</Q></P>
<P>If ever such an act, therefore, should subsist, and the promoters of it remain in power, British subjects may amuse themselves with the <HI>name of freedom</HI> if they please, but they will have no more <HI>real</HI> and <HI>just</HI> right to boast of their <HI>liber∣ty</HI> than the subjects of France or Prussia!
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
For they would then be involved exactly in the same <HI>uncertain</HI> and <HI>precarious</HI> con∣dition! And, though they might not, perhaps, for some considerable time af∣terwards, begin to feel the pernicious effects of a government <HI>unlimited by law,</HI> yet that would not render their condi∣tion less <HI>base</HI> or <HI>slavish,</HI> for our common law has already stated the condition of such as an <HI>outlawed</HI> people: — <Q>Res est misera, ubi <HI>JUS</HI> est vagum.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q> Grounds and Rudiments of Law and Equity, p. 304.</Q></NOTE> — <Q> <HI>WRETCHED</HI> is the state of affairs wherever <HI>COMMON RIGHT</HI> is vague</Q> <HI>and uncertain!</HI> — Nay it is downright <HI>slavery,</HI> as declared by another maxim, already cited, in p. 11.</P>
<P>The learned Sir Robert Atkins (for∣merly one of the judges of the Common Pleas) has remarked, (concerning <Q>the pope's exercise of his power of dispen∣sing, </Q>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
or rather of <HI>suspending laws,</HI> by virtue of such a <HI>"non obstante,"</HI>) that <Q><HI>it was used with some moderation</HI> AT FIRST, in cases that seemed to be <HI>of</HI> GREAT NECESSITY only; but at last, by degrees, it grew to be <HI>in∣tolerable and unlimited.</HI></Q> (See his parliamentary and political Tracts, p. 247.) And surely we ought to be e∣qually jealous of every claim or preten∣sion to <HI>omnipotence,</HI> or <HI>unlimited power,</HI> whenever and by whomsoever it is made, though we do not immediately feel the baneful effects of it.—There are but too many advocates for the imaginary <HI>omni∣potence,</HI> or <HI>unlimited power,</HI> of parlia∣ment!</P>
<P>True it is, that the same persons, who are entrusted with authority to <HI>make laws,</HI> are entrusted likewise with autho∣rity to <HI>suspend</HI> or <HI>repeal</HI> them; but in this (without the least detriment to their
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
just <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>free</HI> privileges) they are not without <HI>limitation.</HI> Even <HI>liberty</HI> it∣self is <HI>limited,</HI> and submits to the same sort of definition; for <Q><HI>liberty</HI></Q> (says an old and eminent law-writer) <Q>is not a power to act, <HI>quidquid libet, what we list,</HI> (for this may be <HI>licentious,</HI> and a lust or passion may enslave a man</Q> [or men] <Q>as much as any chain or fetter,) but, <HI>quod licet,</HI> what is <HI>just</HI> and <HI>ratio∣nal. </HI></Q> <Q>(Rights of the Kingdom, <HI>p. 136.</HI>)</Q> And, in the preceding page, speaking expressly of the house of com∣mons, or parliaments, he says: — <Q> When they are <HI>FREEST</HI> they have <HI>LI∣MITS,</HI> for they be <HI>NOT INFINITE.</HI> Nay, when they are <HI>MOST FREE,</HI> they are <HI>MOST BOUND</HI> to <HI>GOOD ORDERS</HI> and <HI>TO RIGHT REASON.</HI></Q> The truth of this doctrine is unquestionable: for, if a <HI>parliament,</HI> or <HI>legislative power</HI> of any kind, (regal or popular,) presume to enact ordinances which oppose, or in
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
any respect set aside, <HI>natural justice,</HI> or <HI>the common right of innocent persons,</HI> and shall claim an <HI>authority</HI> or <HI>privilege</HI> to do so, (which is ignorantly and vainly cal∣led <HI>omnipotence of parliament,</HI>) the said <HI>power</HI> ceases to be a <HI>legal power,</HI> because it casts off the restraint and government of God's indispensable laws, and thereby becomes excommunicated from God! —<Q>Shall the throne of <HI>INIQUITY</HI> have fellowship with thee, which <HI>FRAMETH MISCHIEF BY A LAW?</HI></Q> (Psalm xciv. 20.)</P>
<P>A due consideration of this ought to restrain the modern rage of act-making! for it is laid down, in that ancient and re∣spectable law-book, called FLETA, that <Q> the power of <HI>RIGHT</HI> (<HI>or</HI> justice) is of God alone, but the power of <HI>WRONG (or injury)</HI> is of the <HI>DEVIL;</HI> and the works of whichsoever of these two,</Q> (viz. <HI>of God or of the devil,</HI>) <Q>he shall

<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
the persons entrusted with the power of legislation, are to be esteemed as <HI>the ser∣vants of the devil,</HI> and as enemies to <HI>God,</HI> while they promote or establish any no∣torious <HI>injustice:</HI> for, <Q>Know ye not, that, to whom ye yield yourselves ser∣vants, to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin, unto death, or of obedience, unto righteous∣ness? </Q> (Rom. vi. 16.)</P>

preventing his <HI>judges</HI> from proceeding to do <HI>justice</HI> according to Magna Charta and the other ancient and fundamental laws of the land; for the judges are also sworn to <Q>deny to no man common right, by the king's letters, nor none other man's, nor for none other cause.</Q> (See the oath made 18 Edward III. Keble's Statutes, p. 110.) This wary expression in the oath, (viz. <Q><HI>for none other cause,</HI></Q>) ex∣cludes all possibility of admitting any <HI>ex∣ception</HI> whatsoever; so that the sworn judges are so bound to GOD, <HI>the king, and the people,</HI> (for they are sworn to <HI>"serve the people"</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q> Ye shall swear, and well and lawfully ye shall SERVE <HI>our lord the king,</HI> AND HIS PEOPLE, <HI>in the office of justice,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></NOTE> as well as the king,) that they must not obey even an act of parliament which sets aside this matter of <HI>"common right,"</HI> I mean the <HI>common right of</HI> PERSONAL LIBERTY <HI>to all ranks of men</HI> that are innocent from crimes and free from debt.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32"/>Some worthy men, zealous for the <HI>privileges of parliament,</HI> are, indeed, un∣willing to admit this <HI>seeming independence</HI> of the judges, in the administration of <HI>justice</HI> or <HI>common right;</HI> which, by their oaths, they are to <HI>"deny to no man:"</HI> but the <HI>just</HI> privileges of parliament never can be injured by the independence of the judges <HI>in this single point;</HI> because, if a judge is so scrupulous, or conscientious, that he refuses to enforce or obey an <HI>un∣just</HI> statute, it is still in the power of par∣liament to impeach or discharge him from his office for disobedience, so that the <HI>loss</HI> would fall only upon the honest and worthy judge, though the <HI>dishonour</HI> of the <HI>injustice</HI> would rest where it began! Nevertheless, while JUDGES remain in office, they must not acknowledge any obligation <HI>superior</HI> to that which they owe to <HI>natural justice</HI> and <HI>the laws of God;</HI> for they are <HI>bound to</HI> GOD (as I

have already remarked) by the nature of their office, as well as to the <HI>king</HI> and the <HI>people;</HI> though this <HI>first</HI> and <HI>most binding</HI> obligation is not expressed in their oath; yet the Scripture says, <Q>The judgement is God's;</Q> (Deut. i. 17.) and again, <Q>Ye judge not for man, but for <HI>THE LORD,</HI> who is with you in the JUDGEMENT:</Q>
(2 Chron. ix. 6.) and, therefore, neither the <HI>judges</HI> nor the <HI>king</HI> himself are to be accounted <HI>laymen,</HI> but <HI>"ministers of God,"</HI> for <HI>righteousness, justice,</HI> and <HI>judgement.</HI> — By the two lat∣ter, in the present case, I do not mean <HI>penal</HI> justice or judgement, but the duties of maintaining the <HI>"common right"</HI> of <HI>inno∣cent</HI> persons, and of relieving the op∣pressed. These are, in a peculiar man∣ner, <HI>sacred to God,</HI> and, therefore, <HI>una∣lienable</HI> from the people, and not to be <HI>sus∣pended</HI> by the authority of parliament; because the commands of <HI>God,</HI> in these matters, are peremptory, and can admit
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
of no exceptions.—<Q> Thus saith the Lord,</Q> <HI>(Jehovah,)</HI> <Q><HI>KEEP YE</HI> judge∣ment and do justice,</Q> (Isaiah lvi. 1.) which is diametrically opposite to the measure of <HI>suspending</HI> or <HI>postponing</HI> them.

<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
<HI>innocent man</HI> should suffer by the <HI>denial</HI> or <HI>suspension</HI> of "COMMON RIGHT."— <Q> Melius est ut <HI>DECEM NOXII</HI> evadant, quam ut <HI>UNUS INNOCENS</HI> pereat.</Q> — For herein the difference between the sort of <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>judgement,</HI> for which I contend, and <HI>penal justice,</HI> (which may be <HI>suspended</HI> by competent authority,) is manifested, viz. that THE RIGHTEOUS "JUDGE OF ALL THE WORLD" decla∣red himself willing to <HI>suspend</HI> his <HI>penal</HI> judgement against A WHOLE NATION of notorious convicted offenders, rather than he would involve TEN <HI>innocent</HI> persons in their destruction, if so many could have been found among them! This senti∣ment of <HI>divine justice</HI> was revealed, for our instruction, to a man, who was honoured with the testimony of being inclined to <Q> <HI>KEEP</HI> the way of the Lord;</Q>—and <Q>the way of the Lord,</Q> <HI>(as the following words declare,) is</HI> —<Q>to <HI>DO</HI> justice and judgement,</Q> (Gen. xviii. 19-33.) —
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
The <HI>suspension,</HI> therefore, of <Q>justice <HI>and</HI> judgement</Q> from <HI>innocent</HI> persons, is plainly the reverse of <Q><HI>KEEPING</HI> the way of the Lord!</Q> Wherefore,— <Q> Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel; remove violence and spoil, and <HI>EXECUTE JUDGEMENT AND JUSTICE;</HI></Q> <HI>(which is the very reverse of</HI> suspending <HI>them!</HI>) <Q>take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord.</Q> (Ezek. xlv. 9.)— <Q> Cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgement; <HI>RIGHTEN</HI> the <HI>OPPRESSED;</HI></Q> (for this is plainly the kind of <HI>judgement,</HI> which, in the former texts, God has com∣manded men to KEEP, and which, there∣fore, ought never to be SUSPENDED;) <Q> judge the fatherless; plead for the wi∣dow. </Q> (Isaiah i. 16, 17.)</P>
<P>It is also necessary to remark the divine testimony against those who <HI>suspended</HI> or did not "KEEP <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>judgement;</HI>" but, on the contrary, devised wicked ordinan∣ces:

—<Q>They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. They hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the spider's web,</Q> &amp;c.

<P>The plea of <HI>necessity</HI> for the service will not excuse them; because that very plea in the very same case, <HI>the necessity for the sea service,</HI> viz. for <Q>the good and safety of the kingdom in general, &amp;c. and the whole king∣dom in danger</Q> (and a stronger or more urgent <HI>necessity</HI> cannot be expressed); yet it was deemed INSUFFI∣CIENT to <HI>justify</HI> the opinion of <HI>all the judges</HI> in favour of extorting SHIP-MONEY (16 Cha.

<P><PB N="67" REF="70"/>All that I have said against the <HI>supposed act</HI> for <HI>suspending the law,</HI> would be e∣qually applicable to an act of parliament for <HI>impressing</HI> either <HI>seamen,</HI> or any other rank or denomination of British subjects: because it would be a real <HI>suspension</HI> (with respect to <HI>one part</HI> of the community) of all the most valuable acts of parliament which are deemed the pillars of the con∣stitution, though the learned judge Foster has prostituted his pen by asserting that it is <Q><HI>not inconsistent with any statute.</HI></Q> That learned man, surely, did not con∣sider that the practice of <HI>impressing</HI> (as now carried on) necessarily includes the circumstances of <Q>taking</Q> <HI>and</HI> <Q>im∣prisoning</Q> <HI>without</HI> <Q>due process of the law;</Q> which is expressly prohibited not only by <HI>one</HI> statute, but by many <HI>sta∣tutes.</HI> The very first <HI>statute</HI> in our book ordains, that <Q>No freeman shall be <HI>TA∣KEN</HI> or <HI>IMPRISONED,</HI> &amp;c. but by the

lawful judgement of his peers, or by the <HI>LAW OF THE LAND:</HI></Q> which, in a∣nother recital, <HI>by parliamentary authority,</HI> is explained to signify <Q>process of the law.</Q>—And another venerable statute (which, like Magna Charta, has been so frequently confirmed by other acts of parliament, in different periods, that <HI>no single parliament</HI> can have sufficient au∣thority to repeal it) expressly ordains, that <Q> No man, of what estate or condition that he be,</Q> <HI>(so that there can be no excep∣tion of SEAMEN,)</HI> <Q>shall be put out of land or tenements, nor <HI>TAKEN,</HI> nor <HI>IMPRISONED,</HI> nor disinherited,</Q> <HI>(and the protection of THE LAW is already shewn to be our</HI> most valuable <HI>inheritance,)</HI> <Q>nor put to death, without being brought to answer by <HI>DUE PROCESS OF LAW.</HI></Q> Stat. 28 Ed.

<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
(3 Cha. I. c. 1.) and also in the act for <HI>regulating the privy-council,</HI> (16 Cha. I. c. 10.)—So that judge Foster's assertion in favour of <HI>pressing,</HI> viz. that it is <Q>not in∣consistent with any statute,</Q> is an unpar∣donable instance of disingenuity! For what <HI>"due process of law"</HI> can be pointed out to justify or warrant the <HI>taking, im∣prisoning,</HI> and <HI>disinheriting,</HI> (of his <HI>most</HI> va∣luable <HI>inheritance,</HI> THE LAW) an innocent sailor? — An <HI>admiralty-warrant</HI> cannot be considered as a <Q>due process of the law,</Q> to justify any such <HI>taking, im∣prisoning, &amp;c.</HI> because it is founded on no other authority than that of <Q>the king and council,</Q> whose warrant, <HI>for any such purposes,</HI> is rendered totally <HI>illegal</HI> by authority of an act of parliament, still in force; (16 Cha. I. c. 10.) so that if a judge should presume to <HI>remand</HI> a man to confinement, that has been <Q>taken and imprisoned</Q> by any such <HI>warrant,</HI> (which is <HI>illegal,</HI> and of course no <Q>pro∣cess
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
 of law,</Q>) he would be liable to an impeachment of <HI>high-treason to the state:</HI> for promoting an <HI>illegal</HI> power and pre∣tension of the crown, in direct opposition to <HI>a solemn act of the whole legislature!</HI></P>
<P>For the same reasons, every magis∣trate who presumes to <HI>back a press-war∣rant</HI> is also highly criminal, and makes himself an <HI>adviser</HI> and <HI>party,</HI> in a most notorious breach of the king's peace! because the effect of promoting an <HI>illegal</HI> warrant, to <HI>suspend</HI> (as much as in him lies) the laws of the king's peace, <HI>common right,</HI> and <HI>personal protection,</HI> from any of the <HI>king's subjects,</HI> (and this even in the <HI>king's name,</HI>) must necessarily <HI>suspend</HI> also, at the same time, the <HI>allegiance</HI> of the persons injured, for so a long time as they are in any actual danger; and they are permitted, even by the FIRST <HI>foun∣dation
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
of the English law,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q> Primum fundamentum legis Angliae est lex <HI>RATIO∣NIS.</HI></Q> <HI>—Doct. et Stud. c. 5.</HI>—<Q>Insuper lex ratio∣nis permittit plurima fieri, ut scilicet quod <HI>LICITUM EST</HI> vim vi repellere, et quod fas est <HI>UNICUIQUE</HI></Q> <HI>(seamen not excepted)</HI> <Q>se tueri, et rem suam defendere contra vim injustam.</Q> Doct. et Stud. c. ii.</NOTE> <Q>to repel force with force, and to defend themselves and their own property against <HI>UNJUST</HI> violence.</Q> And they are not deemed guilty of <HI>murder,</HI> even if they <HI>kill</HI> the assailants, provided the <HI>killing</HI> be <HI>inevi∣table</HI> in their defence; and that they can∣not otherwise maintain their rights.—Nay, men are not only <HI>justified</HI> in defend∣ing <HI>themselves</HI> with force and arms, but may also legally <HI>defend</HI> and <HI>rescue</HI> any o∣ther person whatever, that is attacked or oppressed by an <HI>unlawful violence,</HI> though he be totally unknown to the rescuers!— For this was literally the case of Hopkins, Hugget, and three others, (an adjudged case in B. R. 18 Car. 2.) who, in at∣tempting to <HI>rescue</HI> a stranger from the
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
custody of some <HI>press-masters,</HI> in Smith∣field, happened to kill one of them.—<Q><HI>This was but man-slaughter,</HI></Q> (says Ld. C. J. Holt,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See his Report of <HI>"Regina versus Mawgridge,"</HI> published at the end of Ld C. J. Kelyng's Reports, of which judge Holt was the editor. Some stress has been laid on the circumstance in the above case, that <HI>"the piece of paper,"</HI> which the press-masters shewed to Hugget, &amp;c. <HI>"was not a sufficient warrant."</HI> This is, indeed, readily allowed; and we may safely add, that, if the <HI>lord admiral himself</HI> had attended to assist his <HI>press-masters,</HI> his authority in this case would have been as insignificant as that of any other man; since the baneful clause of <HI>"Non obstante statuto"</HI> in the <HI>lord admiral's patent</HI> is declared <HI>null and void:</HI> and, e∣ven if <HI>the king,</HI> at that time, and the <HI>lords of the privy-council</HI> had also attended in person, with the BEST WARRANT they could make, it would still have been <HI>"an insufficient warrant"</HI> to justify any such vio∣lent attacks upon the liberty of innocent subjects! and the same <HI>judgement in law</HI> must inevitably have been given (supposing the LAW to be DULY MAIN∣TAINED) as in the recited case: because the <HI>meanest subjects</HI> are as much entitled to <HI>the protection of the law</HI> as a king is to <HI>his crown,</HI> and consequently are <HI>equally</HI> justified in defending it, and in resisting <HI>unlawful</HI> force with force, according to the <HI>first foundation of the English law</HI> as already recited. For it is a maxim in law, that <HI>"the king can order nothing"</HI> (i. e. nothing of legal process) <Q>except by a court legally appointed.</Q> <Q> Rex nil potest jubere nisi per curiam legitime constitu∣tam. </Q> Now, as all pretence of <HI>legal power</HI> (in the capaci∣ty of a court of law) is taken from the <HI>king and council</HI> by express act of parliament, it would be absurd to attribute to their <HI>warrants and orders,</HI> or the <HI>admiralty press-warrants,</HI> (which are founded on no other autho∣rity,) the least <HI>legal</HI> authority as <HI>"a sufficient warrant"</HI> to justify the <HI>taking</HI> and <HI>imprisoning</HI> any man whatsoe∣ver; because they are not, nor cannot be considered as, any part of "THE DUE PROCESS OF THE LAW," which alone can justify the <HI>taking</HI> and <HI>imprisoning</HI> Bri∣tish subjects! And, therefore, as <HI>press-gangs</HI> (officers as well as men) are manifestly employed in an <HI>unlawful</HI> business, acting WITHOUT LAW, there is no crime in <HI>beating,</HI> or even in <HI>killing,</HI> them, if they cannot other∣wise be repelled, which must necessarily be deemed a <HI>justifiable manslaughter,</HI> "SE DEFENDENDO;" because it is a maxim, that— <Q>where there is <HI>NO LAW</HI> there is no <HI>TRANSGRESSION.</HI></Q> <Q>Ubi non est <HI>LEX</HI> ibi non est <HI>TRANSGRESSIO.</HI></Q> And another maxim says: —<Q>In vain doth that man implore the aid</Q> <HI>(or protec∣tion)</HI> <Q>of <HI>LAW,</HI> who strives to subvert even the <HI>LAW</HI> itself.</Q>—<Q>Frustra <HI>LEGIS</HI> auxilium implorat, qui <HI>LEGES IPSAS</HI> subvertere conatur:</Q> which must ine∣vitably be deemed the case of <HI>press-gangs;</HI> insomuch that judge Foster himself (if he meant to act according TO LAW) must have directed the jury to find <HI>the same</HI> verdict, in his famous reported case of <HI>Alexander Broadfoot,</HI> even if, instead of a <HI>common sailor</HI> belong∣ing to <HI>the press-gang,</HI> Broadfoot had shot the lieutenant of the gang, or even the captain himself with the <HI>ad∣miralty warrant</HI> in his hand; because the same <HI>just objection</HI> would still have held good against the press-gang, <HI>viz.—"that they acted without legal warrant;"</HI> for an admiralty warrant, to impress seamen, is <HI>no legal warrant,</HI> or <HI>"process of the law,"</HI> to <HI>take</HI> or <HI>imprison</HI> any man whatsoever: — and, therefore all the pains that have been taken, by that learned man, to dis∣guise and confound the true <HI>legal</HI> state of the case, are frivolous, and unworthy his rank and character!</NOTE>) <Q>for, when the liberty of

<P>In short, that excellent adage for all the ordinary circumstances of life, viz. "<HI>Honesty the best</HI> POLICY," will be found to hold equally good in real <HI>poli∣tics,</HI> or affairs of government, even throughout the most dangerous and a∣larming difficulties and emergencies of state; because (if we entertain any real be∣lief in divine Providence) examples may be produced, from the histories of all na∣tions, to demonstrate, that the crafty re∣finements of mere <HI>worldly policy</HI> do fre∣quently
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
hasten or produce the very evils they were intended to avert! An ad∣ministration of <HI>government,</HI> therefore, which cannot subsist with <HI>law, justice,</HI> and <HI>common honesty,</HI> is <HI>unfit to subsist at all!</HI> be∣cause <HI>law</HI> is the only basis of <HI>good and law∣ful government;</HI> so that no man can be es∣teemed truly <HI>loyal</HI> who thinks otherwise; and though several precedents for <HI>sus∣pending</HI> THE LAW (both in pressing and other cases) may easily be produced; yet they can afford no justification or ex∣cuse for such measures; because the <HI>ini∣quity</HI> of them still remains, and <Q>Malum quo communius eo pejus;</Q> so that the citing <HI>bad presidents</HI> is a manifest aggravation of the <HI>treason!</HI> And it is a maxim,—that <Q> PEACE IS THE LIFE OF THE COM∣MONWEALTH, LIBERTY THE SOUL OF IT, AND THE LAWS IT'S BODY.</Q>—<Q>VITA REIPUBLICAE PAX, ET A∣NIMUS LIBERTAS, ET CORPUS LE∣GES. </Q> —And, therefore, the hateful

measure of SUSPENDING THE LAWS, under a pretended <HI>necessity</HI> of carrying on a cruel WAR against the advocates for LIBERTY, ought to be deemed an at∣tempt to destroy the LIFE, SOUL, and BODY, <HI>of the republic!</HI></P>
