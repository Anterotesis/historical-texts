<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE COMIC BALLAD.</HEAD>
<P>THE pieces here selected under the title of Comic Ballads fall under the several denominations of Pastoral, Amatory, Ludicrous, and Convivial; this Dissertation therefore naturally divides itself into these several heads.</P>
<P>No subject of critical discussion has been examined with more assiduity, and less success, than Pastoral composition. The French critics, whom a writer of any discernment seldom quotes but to confute their absurdities, have here blundered with more than or∣dinary address. Rapin has found that pastoral writing
<PB N="x" REF="6"/>must faithfully represent the manners of the golden age. Dubos, a more judicious writer, has discovered that the real dialogues of modern shepherds are too gross for poetic relation; he therefore advises a poet, who would now venture into this walk of verse, to choose for his speakers princes who had lost themselves in a wood. He is surely himself lost in a wood of false criticism, when he informs us that the first Dialogue of Fontenelle's Plurality of Worlds, is an excellent Pastoral Eclogue. It is no doubt a very fine piece of writing, but, considered in the light of a Bucolic Po∣em, it makes fully as aukward a figure as an ancient River God in a French Opera with a tye wig, and silk stockings.</P>
<P>Did these writers ever read Theocritus? Did they not know that he was the father, and his works the only models, of this kind of poetry?</P>
<P>Of all the poets of antiquity, none has been imitated with less success than that excellent writer. He would himself appear to be perfectly original; for though we read that Homer was indebted for some of his beauties to his poetical predecessors, we never find Theocritus lay under this accusation. His eclogues breathe the very spirit of nature; and surpass those of all his imi∣tators in beauty, as much as a romantic river, wander∣ing through the richest rural scenes, does a Dutch jet∣d'eau
<PB N="xi" REF="7"/>squirting among hedges of clipt yews. Virgil, who was born an elegiac poet, but never happened upon his proper province, has in pastoral only displayed excellent skill in versification, which is indeed his first and almost only praise in all his works. His very persons are ridiculous; for what have Thyrsis and Corydon to do with the Po? An absurdity followed by the whole imitators of this imitator; and among others by Pope, who gravely makes Alexis sing upon the banks of the Thames. His admired French author Boileau, might have told him that Truth alone is fair and lovely. To confound the <HI>names</HI> of different climates and ages must, to every reader of taste, appear fully as ludicrous as to confound places and dates in defiance of geography and chronology. Who but must smile if he read that Theocritus was born at the Devil tavern, in the Strand at Paris, in the year of Christ 908, and had the honour to recite one of his eclogues before that merry prince Charles I. of England, who was so pleased with it, that he cut three capers of a most surprising height, to the amazement of the bard; and afterwards made him a present of a lottery ticket? Yet this is not more absurd than to mingle names, places, and subjects, that are perfectly heterogeneous, as is done in Pope's pastorals; which are very much inferior to them of Philips, though Phillips has no
<PB N="xii" REF="8"/>claim to praise. The fact is, that pastoral eclogue is quite foreign to modern manners. Those of The∣ocritus appear natural from their antiquity, and from his inimitable language and manner, but he stands alone, and ever will.</P>
<P>Any eclogues that occur in this collection, such as <HI>Robene and Makyne,</HI> &amp;c. are of a lyric nature; and may with much more propriety be called songs than eclogues, though they partake of the manner of both. I there∣fore leave the pastoral eclogue to come to the pastoral song or ballad, a species of composition, which, though not very remote in its essence from the pastoral dialogue, is infinitely more consonant to modern man∣ners, as it implies no personal representation. It is not supposed to be written or spoken by a shepherd, but merely to convey rural sentiments and images.</P>
<P>Dubos tells us, that the peasants of Italy at this day go to keep their flocks, or labour the ground, with their guitar on their backs; and that they sing their loves in extempore verses, which they accompany with their instrument. This they call <HI>Improvisadare</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This practice of making extempore verses is frequent in Italy, as we may observe in many of the latest travellers. But I suppose the principal merit of such poetry arises from the surprize of the hearer. The works of Barnardino Per∣fetti, a Patrician of Sienna, <HI>Firenze,</HI> 1774, now lie before me. He was the best of modern extemporary poets, and crowned in the capitol, yet there is nothing in them.</NOTE>, Were
<PB N="xiii" REF="9"/>any of these songs to be committed to writing, and of high merit, it might be considered as a pastoral song complete in every circumstance.</P>
<P>Yet I question if in truth of character, it could exceed some of the pieces of that kind now under our eye, though written perhaps in the smoke and noise of a capital. But to pass from this theory, many of the Scotish songs now selected, must be allowed by every good judge to have uncommon excellence in the pastoral mode of poetry. They possess the utmost truth of manner and of colouring. They have all that sweetness which an ancient critic
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Hermogenes, l.</HI> II. <HI>c.</HI> 23.</BIBL></NOTE> observes, is the result of perfect simplicity. As most of the Pastoral pieces in this Selection are likewise of the Amatory style, I shall proceed to consider these kinds of poetry in conjunction.</P>
<P>If the antiquity of the different kinds of poetry were properly ascertained, it is to be believed that love, poetry would be found among those of the first inven∣tion. Love, that sweetest and best of passions, is ever the inspirer of poetry. Love is a master that can call forth musical sounds from the heart of the savage of Iceland, amid his half year's wintry night, as well as from that of the exulting inhabitant of Arabia the
<PB N="xiv" REF="10"/>happy under the influence of the summer sun. His effects are controlled by no manner of life, and con∣fined by no zone. In the most barbarous countries Love will be found the inspirer of sentiment, and re∣finer of thought and of language:
<Q><L>Spirero nobil sensi a rozzi petti;</L>
<L>Raddolciro delle lor lingue il suono.</L></Q></P>
<P>As Love is perhaps the father of poetry
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; Plato, loq. de Amore.</NOTE>, so it is observed that the fair objects, and best judges of that passion, have always esteemed it the most complete triumph of their charms when their lovers are so en∣flamed as to commence poets in their praise. Amorous poetry has often been the supposed <HI>magic charm</HI> that has caught the heart of the fair novice in that passion. This has not escaped Shakspere, that anatomist of the heart.</P>
<Q><L>My gracious Duke,</L>
<L>This man has witched the bosom of my child:</L>
<L>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast <HI>given her rhymes;</HI></L>
<L>And stolen th' impression of her fantasy</L>
<L>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,</L>
<L>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, (messengers</L>
<L>Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth.)</L>
<BIBL><HI>Midsummer Nights Dream.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="11"/>If we except Sappho, the only female who ever wrote any thing worth preservation; there is no writer who has painted love in more genuine and tender co∣lours than are used in the Scotch Amatory Ballads. Yet there are none of them, that I remember, are written by ladies
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is indeed of very late years, one insignificant exception to this rule. <HI>Auld Robin Gray</HI> having got his silly psalm set to soporific music, is to the credit of our taste, popular for the day. But after lulling some good-natured audiences asleep, he will soon fall asleep himself.</NOTE>. That profligacy of manners which always reigns before women can so utterly forget all sense of decency and propriety as to commence authors, is yet almost unknown in Scotland. May it ever be so! May domestic duties and affections be ever the sole employments and amusements of my fair country-women, while those of other kingdoms are showing themselves naked in love songs and romances, or stalking the streets in the breeches of criticism and morality!</P>
<P>The love verses in this volume are of almost every different hue incident to that changeable passion; but a plaintive tenderness is the more general characteristic of them. Fielding, I think, has observed that love is generally accompanied by a pleasing melancholy. The songs in this collection called <HI>Lochaber, Ewbuchts Ma∣rion, Low down in the broom,</HI> and many others have,
<PB N="xvi" REF="12"/>when accompanied witn their proper airs, a most ex∣quisite pathos:
<Q><L>They yield a very echo to the seat</L>
<L>Where Love is throned.</L></Q></P>
<P>Others again possess an equal power of sprightliness; such as <HI>An thou wert my ain thing, Soger Ladie, O'er the Bogie,</HI> &amp;c. which do not yield to the best French songs in spirit, though these are likewise excellent in their kind. Indeed if the French excel in any species of poetry, it is in their songs, though their best efforts in this way do not seem much known in England. As this is the case, and it is perfectly coherent with my subject, I shall beg leave to present my reader with a few French songs of the first merit.</P>

<P>But to return, I must not quit this subject without offering a few remarks on the principal scene of the Scotish pastoral songs, namely the southern part of Scotland in the neighbourhood of the Tweed. I can∣not do this better than in the words of an excellent writer. He forms a fine contrast by beginning with a description of the Northern parts of Scotland. <Q>The highlands of Scotland, says he, are a picturesque, but in general a melancholy country. Long tracts of mountainous desert covered with dark heath, and often obscured by misty weather; narrow vallies, thinly inhabited, and bounded by precipices, resound∣ing with the fall of torrents; a soil so rugged and a climate so dreary, as in many parts to admit neither the amusements of pasturage, nor the la∣bours
<PB N="xxv" REF="21"/>of agriculture; the mournful dashing of waves along the friths and lakes that intersect the country; the portentous noises which every change of the wind, and every increase and diminution of the wa∣ters is apt to raise in a lonely region full of echoes, and rocks, and caverns: the grotesque and ghastly appearance of such a landscape by the light of the moon:—Objects like these diffuse a gloom over the fancy, which may be compatible enough with oc∣casional and social merriment, but cannot fail to tincture the thoughts of a native in the hour of silence and solitude.</Q> And a little further he ob∣serves, <Q>that the ancient highlanders of Scotland had hardly any other way of supporting themselves than by hunting, fishing, or war; professions that are continually exposed to fatal accidents. And hence, no doubt, additional horrors would often haunt their solitude, and a deeper gloom overshadow the imagi∣nation even of the hardiest native.</Q> He proceeds,</P>
<P><Q>What then would it be reasonable to expect from the fanciful tribe, from the musicians and poets, of such a region? Strains expressive of joy, tranquillity, or the softer passions? No. Their style must have been better suited to their circumstances. And so we find in fact that their music is. The wildest ir∣regularity appears in its composition; the expression
<PB N="xxvi" REF="22"/>is warlike and melancholy, and approaches even to the terrible—And that their poetry is almost uni∣formly mournful, and their views of nature dark and dreary, will be allowed by all who admit of the authenticity of Ossian; and not doubted by any who believe these fragments of highland poetry to be ge∣nuine, which many old people, now alive, of that country remember to have heard in their youth, and were then taught to refer to a pretty high an∣tiquity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Some of the Southern provinces of Scotland pre∣sent a very different prospect. Smooth and lofty hills covered with verdure, clear streams winding through long and beautiful valleys, trees produced without culture, here straggling or single, and there crowding into little groves and bowers, with other circumstances peculiar to the districts I allude to, render them fit for pasturage, and favourable to ro∣mantic leisure, and tender passions. Several of the old Scotch songs take their names from the rivulets, villages and hills adjoining to the Tweed near Mel∣rose, a region distinguished by many charming va∣rieties of rural scenery, and which, whether we consider the face of the country, or the genius of the people, may properly enough be termed the Arcadia of Scotland. And all these songs are sweetfully and
<PB N="xxvii" REF="23"/>powerfully expressive of love and tenderness, and other emotions suited to the tranquillity of pastoral life
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essays by Dr. Beattie, 3d edit. Essay I.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Thus far this eminent philosopher and poet; whose ideas are so fully expressed, and so consonant with my own, that they leave me little or nothing further to add. I must, however, observe that the genuine Old Songs, which were originally set to the most ad∣mired of the Scotish airs, are most of them unfor∣tunately lost. For the present words to the greater part of them we are indebted to Allan Ramsay, and his friends, as he himself informs us in the fol∣lowing words of the preface to his Tea-table Miscel∣cellany, or Collection of Songs. <Q>My being well as∣sured how acceptable new words to known good tunes would prove, engaged me to the making verses for above SIXTY of them in this and the second vo∣lume:</Q> (which are Scotish songs, the third and last volume containing mostly English,) <Q>about THIRTY more were done by some ingenious young gentlemen.</Q> I heartily wish honest Allan and his ingenious young gentlemen had rather used their endeavours to recover and preserve the real ancient ballads, than to compose new ones. For uncouth as those might be, I much
<PB N="xxviii" REF="24"/>suspect they exceeded their substitutes in variety at least. Indeed as I meant this as a POETICAL, not as a MUSICAL work, I found myself obliged to admit only the best of these modern pieces, always prefering the ancient when it could be found. Those who wish for words to all the Scotish airs, may find them in many collections. This only means to present the reader of taste with the very best of Scotish ballad poetry. The reader, whom I could wish to please, would turn with contempt from a constant succession of the same ideas expressed in the same words and stanza. For though the airs vary, their verbal accom∣paniments have in general a similarity as disgusting as the poems of Blackmore, or the pictures of Angelica Kauffman. Though the ancient songs were perhaps less smooth than their successors, they were doubtless more varied, being composed at distant periods by different minstrels, than they could possibly be by Allan Ramsay (a writer not rich in ideas) and his young friends, who perhaps begun and finished their labours in this way in the space of a few weeks. And if they were harsh or uncouth, the ancient composer might plead with Tasso:
<Q><L>— se ben miri,</L>
<L>Molle, e dura e costei;</L>
<L><PB N="xxix" REF="25"/>Cosi son duri, e molli i versi miei.</L>
<L>Molle e in lei quel di fuori;</L>
<L>Dentro ha marmi e diaspri:</L>
<L>Sol nella scorza i versi miei son aspri.</L>
<L>Ma senti, come spiri</L>
<L>Da loro interni amori</L>
<L>Spirto gentil, ch' intenerisce i core.</L></Q></P>
<P>A very celebrated and intelligent physician, who was born, and passed his early years in the south of Scotland, informs me, that it is his opinion, that the best of the ancient Scotish airs were really composed by shepherds. In his remembrance there was, in al∣most every village of that district, a chief shepherd, who had acquired celebrity by composing better songs than others of the same profession. And he thinks that though the best airs are in general known, yet the words to at least one half have never been published. The musical instruments used by these rude minstrels, are the common flute, and the <HI>stock-and-horn,</HI> which is a flute with a small horn fastened to the further end of it, and which forms a <HI>base,</HI> in the nature of a bassoon.</P>
<P>The beginning of one of their unpublished ballads of the mournful kind, he happens to remember. It was written on the fatal expedition to Darien, in the end of last century, a project that seems to have been
<PB N="xxx" REF="26"/>formed for the destruction of the Scotish youth, and opens with the following most striking couplet.</P>
<L>We'll a awa to the woods and murne</L>
<L>Untill our Scotish joes come hame.</L>
<P>I believe not above half a dozen of these genuine Scotish pastoral ballads are in print; and suspect all such may be found in this volume. They have certain strokes in them which, in my opinion, could only occur to real shepherds. Such are <HI>The yellow-hair'd laddie, Ewbuchts Marion, In simmer I maw'd my meadow,</HI> &amp;c. What a sad exchange to give such songs for the poor tinsel of Allan Ramsay, and his bottle companions!</P>
<P>There is a book printed at St. Andrews in 1548, called <HI>The Complaint of Scotland.</HI> It is written by a Sir James Inglis, and is of such exceeding rarity as to be almost unique: but Dr. George Mackenzie in his Lives of Scotish Writers, has given us an abstract of it. The author mentions a masque, and enumerates the following songs, as forming part of the entertain∣ment.</P>

</LIST>
<P>This list, which is of exceeding curiosity, may teach us that not one of our Scotish popular airs is so ancient as 1548. Indeed I suspect these of which the scene lyes in the south of Scotland, as <HI>Tweedside,</HI> &amp;c. are all of them posterior to the accession of James VI. to the throne of England. Any of the above songs, that have local marks, belong to the Northern parts of Scotland; and it is to be supposed that the provinces which first felt the blessings of repose, would first break out into finging. Not above two of the pieces in this list are now known. If I do not mistake, numbers 2 and 19, or something like them, may be found in <HI>Smith's Songs in score before the year</HI> 1500. They are English songs; and prove the author has intermingled English airs with those of his own country. I am told No. 17 used lately to be sung on the stage at Edinburgh, and contains a mock courtship between a frog and a mouse, of some satyrical merit.</P>
<P>Some few of the modern songs have the merit of being written on real occasions, and such always speak
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="29"/>the language of the heart, a language of difficult simulation. Some of such yield not to the Elegies of Tibullus in nature and pathos, though that ancient poet is a wonderful master in Amatory verse. Ham∣mond has never caught his spirit, except in imitations, which are so close as to be almost translations, but I have lately had the pleasure of seeing some Elegies of this kind in manuscript, which rival those of Tibullus himself.</P>
<P>The most ancient pieces in this selection are of the LUDICROUS style of poetry, which is something sur∣prising, as that species of writing has been thought by able crities to be an effort of modern refinement. It is true the images given us in the Scotish Ludicrous pieces are often not the most agreeable or delicate; but have the most modern writers, Swift for example, been more laudable in this respect? In <HI>Peblis to the Play, Christ's Kirk on the Green,</HI> and others, the reader will find curious descriptions of low life and manners, as they were in Scotland in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; the more curious as they were drawn by the hands of monarchs themselves. It is certainly much to the credit of the united kingdoms that, while the poets of the other countries of Europe were writing extravagant romances, Chaucer, and the princely bards of Scotland, were employed in delineating real life and manners.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxiv" REF="30"/>In the <HI>Wyfe of Auchtermuchty,</HI> and similar productions here given, there is abundance of humour, though a critic of fashion may perhaps pronounce it <HI>low.</HI> But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is NATURE, and will ever be so. Had Chaucer only written, or rather translated, the <HI>Romaunt of the Rose,</HI> his works might now have been fast asleep in some old chest; but his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ales,</HI> replete with humour of the lower kind, will perpetuate his fame. That father of Eng∣lish poetry appears to have been as much esteemed in Scotland, as in his native country. Dunbar, the chief of the Scotish poets, has in his <HI>Goldin Terge</HI> the following spirited apostrophe in his praise, which is highly generous, if we consider the inveterate enmity at that time subsisting between the two kingdoms. It proves that the pursuit of poetry is productive of large and liberal sentiments, even in a barbarous period.</P>
<L>O reverend Chawser, rose of rethouris all,</L>
<L>As in oure toung ane flour imperial,</L>
<L>That raise in Brittane evir, quha reidis richt,</L>
<L>Thou beiris of makars the triumphs royal;</L>
<L>Thy fresche ennamalit termes celestial,</L>
<L>This mater couth haif illuminit full bricht.</L>
<L>Was thou nocht of our Inglis all the licht,</L>
<L>Surmounting every toung terestrial,</L>
<L>As far as Mayis morrow dois midnicht?</L>
<P><PB N="xxxv" REF="31"/>Chaucer may indeed be regarded as the father, not only of English poetry, but of that remarkable quality of writing called <HI>humour;</HI> a word which, I believe, has no corresponding term in any language, as we have none for the French <HI>naïveté,</HI> for they are distinct ideas. <HI>Naïveté,</HI> if I mïstake not, only implies a <HI>na∣tive gaiety, an unconscious simplicity,</HI> and is never used in a synonymous sense with <HI>humour,</HI> which implies something characteristic, even though <HI>severe</HI> or <HI>morose,</HI> as we say a <HI>humourous gravity.</HI> Fontaine has <HI>naïveté,</HI> Chaucer has hu∣mour. Wit is an assimulation of distant ideas: Humour is confined to <HI>manner</HI> either of speaking or writing.</P>
<P>It has been affirmed by some eminent critics, that the moderns much excel the ancients in witty and hu∣mourous composition; and alledged, that the ancients have no writers in these kinds to oppose to Don Quixote, Hudibras, The Splendid Shilling, the Adventures of Gil Blas, The Tale of a Tub, and the Rehearsal
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adventurer, No. 133. The reader will smile at the works here enumerated, when he thinks on the omission of those of Shakspere, Fielding, and Smollet; the last of whom was a writer of the most genuine humour that ever existed.</NOTE>. But in this they did not reflect that they only saw one side of the question. The fact is, that with is the most fleeting and transitory quality writing can have. Like an exquisite essence, it wastes itself, and leaves
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="32"/>only the vase that contained it. The Margites of Homer I suspect began, like Hudibras in our time, to cease being understood before it was allowed to perish. But the argument I would use is, in short, that we cannot judge of the efforts of the ancients in this way, because their best works are lost. Surely then to pro∣nounce against them, when they cannot be heard in their defence, is not candid. It must, however, be allowed, that the modern Novel, descriptive of real life, and the most useful kind of writing known, when properly conducted, appears to have been fo∣reign to ancient conception. But it appears to me very evident that the human mind, in the progress of ages, alters its shape and powers, if I may so express myself. In the days of Greece and Rome, its criterion would seem to have been strength: in modern times, ver∣satility aud acuteness. Hence the dignity and grandeur of their writings; and the wit and precision of ours. Reasons might be given for the difference, but this is not the proper place.</P>
<P>As we have seen Chaucer was so much regarded by the ancient Scotish poets, I suppose it was from him they took their ideas of burlesque descriptions of vulgar life.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxvii" REF="33"/>The CONVIVIAL songs in this Selection are not many, I shall not therefore insist on this head. It may, however, be observed that, considering how much the French have written in this way, it is something strange their ancient allies, the Scots, should have been so barren in this very easy mode of composition. One would imagine the juice of the grape, that inspired Anacreon, was equally potent in his numerous French imitators; while the Scots, having little of that liquid inspiration, were by ale confined in the bands of sleep at the social hour that gave the French <HI>bons vivants</HI> free access to the regions of fancy.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be expected that, before closing this essay, I should offer some remarks on Scotish Music, a subject of much interest and curiosity to every lover of that best sort of melody which speaks to the heart and passions. But the ingenious author of an essay on Scotish Music, annexed to Mr. Arnot's History of Edinburgh, has left me nothing to add on that head. Dr. Beattie has likewise treated this subject more briefly, but with his usual elegance and ability, in his Essay on Poetry and Music as they affect the Mind. Another good writer
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Gregory in his Comparative View of the State and Faculties of Man with those of the Animal World.</NOTE> has likewise dropt a few re∣marks on this matter. Both these eminent authors
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="34"/>have used many arguments to confute the opinion of those who ascribe to David Rizzio the invention of our Scotish melodies; an idea that, like many heresies, is only made important by its opponents, for it carries absurdity and confutation in itself
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am informed that some Scotishman has made some stanzas to the favorite Irish air of <HI>Langolce</HI> under the name of <HI>The Banks of the Dee.</HI> Such a thest cannot be too severely condemned, as if persisted in, there is an end of all national music. As the Irish air is rather impure, had the scene of the new verses been laid in Ireland, they might have been innocent enough.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I shall therefore conclude with an observation or two respecting the volume now under the reader's eye.</P>
<P>He has already been admonished not to look upon this Work as a Collection, but as a Selection; not as pretending to offer the whole of the Scotish Ballads to his view, but only the very best of them. The first volume
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The second edition is here meant.</NOTE> indeed presents the reader with a complete digest of such tragic pieces yet discovered in the Scotish dialect, as any ways deserve preservation; those omitted being of no merit of any kind. Such are <HI>Johnie Armstrong, Young Waters, Laird of Ochiltree, The Battle of Harlaw, The Battle of Raidquair,</HI> and others. Not to mention <HI>Lord Thomas and fair Annet</HI> which is an English Ballad; as well as <HI>Chevy Chace,</HI> though some who have not seen Dr. Percy's ancient
<PB N="xxxix" REF="35"/>ballad of this name, will still contend for its being Scotish
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Such has been the generous impartiality of the minstrel who composed this fine ballad, and who perhaps had been entertained with equal attention at Alnwick and at Douglass castles, that hardly one intrinsic mark could be given to authorise the ascribing of it to a native of either country, till the ancient copy appeared, which at once terminated the dispute.</P>
<P>An edition printed at Aberdeen 1754, has a preface and notes, which present the arguments that were then valid for <HI>Chevy chace</HI> being a Scotish composition.</P>
<P>The loss of Chevy chace might be compensated to Scot∣land by the recovery of many tragic pieces of no inferior merit, were means used by those who have opportunities for that purpose. <HI>Bertram the archer,</HI> the Robin Hood of Scotland, is now hardly known to have existed, though he was celebrated in many a heroic ditty. The only stanza known to the Editor is given, as it closes with a pretty thought. Bertram, being surrounded by his enemies, ad∣dresses his weapons in this manner:
<Q><L>My trusty bow of the tough yew,</L>
<L>That I in London bought;</L>
<L>And silken strings, if ye prove true,</L>
<L>That my true love has wrought.</L></Q></P></NOTE>. Of the Scotish Ballads, which fall under the title of this second volume, I must confess, perhaps, twenty or thirty more would have been admitted, had the limits of the work allowed it. Yet here, I have, to use a vulgar metaphor, presented the reader with the cream of about a dozen volumes, most of them un∣common in this part of the kingdom. The comic
<PB N="xl" REF="36"/>pieces here given, are chosen either from their being rare, their being unpublished, or their intrinsic merit.</P>
<P>For the very curious piece, which is placed at the head of this volume, and now first published, I am in∣debted to the friendship of the most learned and in∣genious Editor of the Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. <HI>Peblis to the Play</HI> will certainly be looked upon as a very considerable acquisition to ancient Scotish Poetry, and will, I doubt not, gain Dr. Percy, to whom alone the reader is beholden for it, much grate∣ful applause in the Northern part of the kingdom in particular. Indeed considerable fame is already due to him who first set the example of a legitimate collec∣tion of this kind, than which, if conducted with taste, nothing can well be more entertaining to the lover of Poetry. The Reliques of Ancient English Poetry were only the amusement of his youthful hours of relaxa∣tion from severer studies; but might well be called a work of infinite labour and disquisition, if executed by a writer of less genius to form a noble plan, and less ability to put it in execution. For the politeness peculiar to himself, with which the communication of this poem was made, I now beg leave to offer him my public acknowledgments.</P>
<P><PB N="xli" REF="37"/>Some readers may perhaps think, that a few of the pieces in this volume might, with equal propriety, have been allotted to the first, as being of a plaintive or mournful kind. In excuse it may be alledged, that the melancholy of these productions is not of the deepest shade, but such as may, with no blame, fall in with the present arrangement; in the same manner as the best comic writings are interspersed with a few scenes of fugitive gravity.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="ballad">
<HEAD>PEBLIS TO THE PLAY.</HEAD>
<P>FOR this very curious specimen of ancient Scotish poetry, the reader has already been informed that the editor was indebted to Dr. Percy; who to the copy in his hand-writing, from which this is printed, annexed the following account of the original MS.</P>
<P><Q>This old song is preserved in the Pepysian Library, at Magdalen College in Cambridge, in p. 155, of an ancient MS. collection of old Scotish songs and poems in folio; which MS. had, I believe, been a present to the founder of that library, (old Mr. Pepys) from the duke of Lauderdale, minister to king Charles II. It had originally belonged to that duke's
<PB N="162" REF="199"/>ancestor, Sir Richard Maitland, knt. who lived in the reign of queen Mary, and her son king James VI; and contains a great number of songs and poems by the said Sir Richard Maitland, which are of high poetical merit, and throw moreover great light on the incidents and manners of that age. It is remarkable that this old bard, Sir Richard Maitland, was blind (like Homer and Milton), at least at the time when some of his poems were written; as he expressly mentions it, and consoles himself very poetically under the loss of his sight, and very advanced age, in one of his pieces intitled, <HI>The blind Baron's Comfort.</HI> Besides his own pieces, the MS. contains a selection of the pieces of other bards collected by him: some of them (as this of James I.) no where else pre∣served.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The foregoing poem is expressly quoted for king James I's composition, and postiively ascribed to that monarch, in John Major's Scotish History, 4to. See his account of king James I. towards the end, where Major seems to hint that a parody had been made of this song of the king's, to ridi∣cule him for some low intrigue in which the king had been detected, &amp;c. I have not the book by me, but with this clue the meaning of that very obscure passage, I think, may be decyphered.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="200"/><Q>This song written by king James I. is a proof that <HI>Christ's Kirk on the Green,</HI> was written by his de∣scendant James V. being evidently a more modern composition.</Q></P>
<P>The passage of Major, mentioned above, is as fol∣lows. <Q>Artificlosum libellum de Regina dum captivus erat composuit, antequam eam in conjugem duceret: et aliam artificiosam cantilenam ejusdem, <HI>Yas sen,</HI> &amp;c. et jucundum artificiosumque illum cantum, <HI>At Bel∣tayn,</HI> &amp;c. quam alij de Dalkeith et Gargeil mutare studuerunt, quia in arce aut camera clausus serva∣batur, in qua mulier cum matre habitabat.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. P. after writing his own remarks, having communicated this poem to several of his learned friends, they interspersed theirs; and I shall here give their observations, and a few of my own, upon this singular production, after a few preliminary notices that may be necessary to the English reader.</P>
<P>James I, king of Scotland, and the undoubted au∣thor of the production now under view, was born in the year 1393, being the son of Robert III. His fa∣ther to screen him from the ambitious designs of his uncle, the duke of Albany, sent him to France, but he was unfortunately taken at sea; and ungenerously detained in captivity by the kings of England, though during a truce between the two realms, for nineteen
<PB N="164" REF="201"/>years: nor was he released without payment of an immense ransom. Upon his assuming the government on the death of his father, in 1424, he enacted many wise laws, and acquired the esteem and af∣fection of his people; but attempting to reform the feudal system of his kingdom, and in consequence to curb the power of his nobles, he was by some of the chief of them murdered in his bed in 1437, being the 44th year of his age, and 13th of his reign.</P>
<P>Ballenden, in his translation of Hector Boece's His∣tory, gives this character of him: <Q>He was weil learnit to fecht with the sword, to just, to turnay, to wer∣syl, to syng and dance; was an expert mediciner, richt crafty in playing baith of lute and harp, and sindry othir instrumentis of musik. He was expert in gramar, oratry, and poetry; and maid so flowand and sententious versis apperit well he was ane natural and borne poete.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Walpole, in his Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors, gives us this list of the works of James I.</P>
<P>A panegyric on his queen.</P>
<P>Scotch Sonnets; one book. One of them, a lamen∣tation while in England, is in MS, in the Bodleian Li∣brary, and praises Gower and Chaucer exceedingly.</P>
<P>Rythmos Latinos, lib. I.</P>
<P>On Music.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="202"/>He is said to have written some poetical pieces when in England, which is very likely; but it appears to me, that <HI>Peblis to the Play</HI> could not be one of these. He being not more than twelve years of age when he left Scotland, it is not to be supposed that he was so fa∣miliar with the manners of his countrymen, as to paint them so minutely as is done in this poem.</P>
<P>PEBLIS TO THE PLAY.] Peblis or Peebles is the county-town of Twedale. Ettrick forest is not far dis∣tant from it. That forest was a royal chace: hence the kings of Scotland frequently resided there. Darn∣ley was there in the winter before his death. H.</P>
<P><HI>Play</HI> appears to me here to mean an <HI>annual festival:</HI> some of which are still celebrated in different villages in England. The day is still observed, though the occasion is lost in remote antiquity. ED.</P>
<P>Stanza 1. <HI>Beltane.</HI>] A great Celtic festival on the first or second of May. See more of it in Macpherson's Dissertations. H.</P>
<P>Ib. <HI>found.</HI>] Perhaps from the A. S. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>tendere.</HI> (to go) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> aliquo tendens. Vide Lye, Lexicon Anglo-Saxon. P.</P>
<P>The construction of this passage, which is miserably confused, owing solely as would appear to the lust of alliteration, seems to me this; <HI>They found the solace</HI> (of the singing and music) <HI>sooth to say, by firth and by forest furth,</HI> (or around.) ED.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="203"/>St. 2. <HI>Garray.</HI>] Perhaps the same as <HI>deray:</HI> vulgar words for jollity. P.</P>
<P><HI>Garish</HI> is used in England for shewy, vain pomp. H.</P>
<P><HI>Garray</HI> perhaps is <HI>prattle,</HI> from Anglo-Saxon <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Garrire.</HI> P.</P>
<P>Ib. <HI>Glew.</HI>] In English <HI>Glee,</HI> Mirth. Anglo-Saxon <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. P.</P>
<P>Ib. <HI>Blew.</HI>] That is <HI>blue,</HI> quite gloomy, out of hu∣mour. P.</P>
<P>To <HI>look blue</HI> is still a phrase implying to <HI>seem melan∣choly.</HI> ED.</P>
<P>St. 3. <HI>Gend.] Gent</HI> is an epithet often applied to la∣dies by Spenser. It probably means <HI>delicate,</HI> or perhaps <HI>slender;</HI> or it may be an abbreviation of <HI>gentle.</HI> J.B.</P>
<P>The annotator has not observed that none of his in∣terpretations has any connexion with the context. The girl was so <HI>guckit</HI> (foolish) and so <HI>gend,</HI> that she would not eat. <HI>Gend</HI> must imply <HI>peevish.</HI> ED.</P>
<P>St. 4. <HI>Amang yon marchands my dudds do?</HI>] Dr. P. reads, <HI>Amang yon marchands, (my dudds do)</HI> and interprets the latter clause, <HI>My clothes or dudds being done.</HI> I think the line only required the point of interroga∣tion which I have lent it, to be perfectly intelligible: What! says the country girl, <HI>My ragged cloths do amang
<PB N="167" REF="204"/>you fine folk?</HI> An expression quite natural, and in cha∣racter. The whole stanza strongly paints the affecta∣tion of a rustic beauty and coquette. <HI>Alas!</HI> says she, <HI>am I not clearly ruined? I dare not go to the show I am so sunburnt!</HI> (though at the same time she was too sensible of the lustre of her complexion;) <HI>Will my ragged clothes do among you folks drest as fine as foreign merchants?</HI> (though at this time she was drest out in all her sinery:) <HI>Marry I shall only try to stand afar off and look at them, as if I was at home in my homely habit;</HI> (though at the same time she meaned not to go as a gazer, but as knowing her∣self an object that would draw universal admiration.) ED.</P>
<P>St. 5. Hop, <HI>Hop; Calyé, and Cardronow.</HI>] <HI>Cailyé</HI> is the name of a place in the neighbourhood of Peebles, so also is <HI>Cardrona.</HI> H.</P>
<P><HI>Hop</HI> or <HI>Hope</HI> is the same. If I remember right I have seen in print a metrical charter of a Scotish king, either of <HI>Hop</HI> by itself, or with other lands, <HI>for service of a braid arrow, whenever he came to hunt in Yarrow.</HI> ED.</P>
<P>Ib. <HI>Rohumbelow.</HI>] is the burden of an old Scotish tune.</P>
<P>It was the burden or chorus of a triumphal song made by the Scots on occasion of the victory gained at Bannock-burn. P.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="205"/>One stanza of this song is preserved by Abercromby; and is, if my memory serves me,
<Q><L>What weened the king of England</L>
<L>So soon to win all Scotland?</L>
<L><HI>With a bey and a how rohumbelow.</HI></L>
<BIBL>ED.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>St. 6. <HI>birkin hat.</HI>] A hat made of birch interwoven like straw hats, worn by rusticks. P.</P>
<P>Ib. <HI>There fore ane man to the holt.</HI>] This seems to be a piece of an old song. P.</P>
<P>St. 7. <HI>How at thai wald dispone thame.] How at,</HI> that is, <HI>How that;</HI> a common Northern defect. So in the Northumberland Houshold Book, <HI>passim. As ye wald es∣chew that at may ensue,</HI> for 'that which may follow.' P.</P>
<P>St. 8. <HI>Malkin.</HI>] The Scots cant word for a hare, and something of Esau's beauty. ANONYM.</P>

<P>St. 26. <HI>Settand schaftis.</HI>] I suspect the word <HI>schaftis</HI> has been brought from the end of the third line to this. The sun <HI>settand schaftis,</HI> if it means <HI>throwing darts,</HI> and no other interpretation can be thought of, may indeed be that kind of bastard sense that is not uncommon in old versifiers of the middling class, but I believe James I. would not have written it. <HI>The sun was sett, and</HI>—Or, <HI>The sun was setting,</HI> (a word wanting,) would appear the proper way of reading this line.

<HEAD>II. CHRISTS KIRK ON THE GREEN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS edition is given from the last, intitled, <HI>Two ancient Scottish poems; The Gaberlunzie Man, and Christs Kirk on the Green; with Notes and Observations by John Calendar, Esq. of Craigforth, Edinburgh,</HI> 1782, 8vo. Bishop Gibson's edition of this ballad, printed at Oxford 1691, from Bannatyne's MS. is the earliest edition. I am sorry, however, to see Mr. Calendar quoting Ramsay's edition for some parts of his text, as there certainly never was a more ignorant or rash transcriber of an∣cient Scotish poetry than Allan Ramsay. He seems to have considered it as very much his property; and to have exercised his own profession upon it by shaving, curling, and powdering it at his will and pleasure. Mr. Calendar might have given us a transcript of this piece from Bannatyne's MS. in the Advocate's library at Edinburgh; in which Dr. Percy has observed in a MS. note, <HI>Christs Kirk on the Green</HI> is very different from what it was when filled with the innovations of Allan Ramsay. This most ingenious and faithful of all editors of ancient English poetry has likewise the fol∣lowing notice prefixed to his MS. copy of <HI>Peblis to the
<PB N="174" REF="211"/>Play.</HI> <Q>In Maitland's MS. the old song of <HI>Christs Kirk</HI> differs from all the copies I have seen in the con∣clusion of all the stanzas; each of which ends with this line, by way of burden or chorus,
<L>At Christis Kirk on the greene.</L>
always preceded by some short line, as in this first stanza;
<L>Was never in Scotland hard nor sene</L>
<L>Sic dansing nor deray,</L>
<L>Nother in Falkland on the grene,</L>
<L>Nor Peblis to the Play,</L>
<L>As was of Wowairis, as I wene,</L>
<L>At Chrystis kirk on ane day,</L>
<L>Thair come our Kittie, wesching clene,</L>
<L>In hir new kirtil of gray,</L>
<L>full gay</L>
<L>At Chrystis kirk on the grene.</L> which I cannot help thinking is more genuine than that in the Evergreen, and the other editions, as it so exactly resembles the conclusions of the stanzas in <HI>Peblis to the Play.</HI></Q> In consequence of these well founded remarks, I have preserved the burthen in this edition throughout.</P>
<P>As the foregoing piece was undoubtedly written by James I. of Scotland, so we have good authority, thongh not so infallible, to ascribe this to James V. a
<PB N="175" REF="212"/>prince who delighted in low manners and adventures so much, as often to disguise himself in order to enjoy them. He reigned from 1514 to 1542. A most cu∣rious account of his death may be found in <HI>Knox's His∣tory of the Reformation of Religion in Scotland.</HI> He was the <HI>Zerbino</HI> of Ariosto; and is celebrated by Ronsard in as good verses as ever came from his pen.</P>
<P>The notes of Mr. Calendar are fraught with that knowledge of Northern literature for which he is so justly celebrated; and, though my opinion can add nothing to the general suffrage, I cannot help saying that, for universal science of Northern Antiquities and languages, Mr. Calendar may justly be regarded as the most learned man in Europe. I am sorry to see he takes no notice of a work he published a specimen of some time ago in his present publication; which leads me to fear he has dropt that grand design. This was his <HI>Bibliotheca Septentrionalis</HI> in the manner of D'Her∣belot's Bibliotheque Orientale, containing a complete system of Northern science of every kind to be com∣prized in two folio volumes. An amazing work! and which ought to be made a national concern. In his present volume he promises a Glossary of the ancient Scotish language; but would he return to the large design above praised, the fame would be infinitely greater, without much greater labour. Words are for
<PB N="176" REF="213"/>pedants, but facts are for all. There is, perhaps, no branch of learning more painful, and less glorious, than etymology. To Mr. Calendar the glossary to this vo∣lume is much obliged. They who would see what vast intelligence may be bestowed in elucidating <HI>Christs Kirk on the green,</HI> and the following piece called <HI>The Gaber∣lunyie man,</HI> are referred to his work.</P>
<P>I must remind the reader of a curious circumstance, which is, that Sappho, the celebrated poetess, wrote a ballad (if I may so call it) on a <HI>Country Wedding,</HI> which is mentioned by Demetrius Phalereus; and which, I doubt not, resembled this. He observes, she made the Rustic Bridegroom and the Porter speak in mean and vulgar language, though she was herself happy in the most exquisite expression, where it was to be used with propriety. See <HI>Dem. Phal.</HI> §. 166 &amp; seq.</P>
<P><HI>Christs Kirk on the green.</HI>] The kirk-town of Leslie, near Falkland in Fife.</P>
<P>St. 1. <HI>Falkland on the green.</HI>] Dr. Percy observes, there possibly once existed a Scotish song of this title. Could this be recovered, he adds, the subject would be com∣plete.</P>
<P>St. 3. <HI>As ony rose,</HI> &amp;c.] The alliteration in the first of these two lines is happy, in the second unfortunate and harsh; <HI>lire</HI> signifying flesh, nor <HI>skin.</HI></P>

<P>St. 13. <HI>Fy! he had slain a priest.</HI>] That is, committed the most atrocious of murders. To kill a priest was thought to unite sacriledge and murder.

From stanza II. it would appear the writer wished to have it ascribed to James I; the first lines of that stanza bearing an analogy to his imprison∣ment in England. The nature and naiveté of this piece are exquisite.</P>

The transitions to opposite passions in both are described in such a rapid and easy manner, as would have done credit to the first comic writer.</P>

<HEAD>V. THE VISION.</HEAD>
<P>In a letter which the Editor received some time ago from the author of the Minstrel, the following remarks are made upon this poem; which, being of so good a judge, will, he doubts not, have great weight with the reader.</P>
<P><Q>The best Scotish poem of modern times that I have seen (for, though the title pretends that it was written four hundred years ago, I have reason to think that it was produced in this century) is called <HI>The Vision.</HI> I am inclined to think that the Author of it, whoever he was, must have read Arbuthnot's His∣tory of John Bull. But there are noble images in it, and a harmony of versification superior to every thing I have seen in the kind. I suspect that is the work of some friend of the family of Stuart, and that it must have been composed about the year 1715.</Q></P>
<P>St. 6. <HI>Saya Fere.</HI>] Fere, for <HI>mate,</HI> is a common word in ancient Scotish. The Scotish writers even carried it into England with them, as we may observe in <HI>the Tra∣gedies of William Alexander of Menstrie, London,</HI> 1607.</P>
<P>St. 13.] It is with regret I observe, that the latter part of this stanza is still applicable. Many Scotish
<PB N="180" REF="217"/>peers have not sufficient spirit to slight English gold, but ignobly to this hour, barter the liberties of their country, and their own independence for it. May ex∣ecration pursue their memories! Scotland is, perhaps, at this day, the only country in Europe to which the philosophical light of liberty has not penetrated. To oppose a foolish or corrupt minister is, with my coun∣trymen, to oppose legal power. One of their most cele∣brated writers is just now engaged, at a rated salary, to defend the cause of corruption.—Not all his talents will save him from the contempt of more enlightened pos∣terity.</P>
<P>St. 19.] This ludicrous description of the drunken gods is perfectly risible. Nothing in <HI>Midas</HI> or <HI>The Golden Pippin</HI> can exceed it. The several attributes are finely preserved.</P>
<P>St. 25.] <HI>Bruce</HI> is here used for him the Jacobites esteem legal heir of the crown. The principles of this poem are utterly detested by the Editor, as they are by every friend of mankind: he only gives it as a piece of fine writing in its way. The unhappy attachment to the family of Stuart, has wasted the finest estates, and shed some of the best blood in Scotland. It now exists only in the breasts of old women.</P>
<P>The real Bruce (Robert I.) was a hero, if ever any such existed. The finest epic poem in the world might
<PB N="181" REF="218"/>be founded on his story. <HI>The famous History of the va∣liant Bruce in heroic verse, by Patrick Gordon, gentleman.</HI> Dort, 1615; <HI>reprinted at Edinburgh,</HI> 1718, is the best attempt in this way. Some of the stanzas are worthy of Spenser.</P>

<P>This piece, as Lord Hales observes, exhibits a lu∣dicrous picture of the <HI>curta supellex</HI> of the Scotish com∣mons in the 16th century. Every country must be poor till agriculture or commerce enrich it. That the first of these was little cultivated in Scotland till within these late years is well known. The following epistle of James VI. to Queen Elizabeth of England, is a curious proof of the poverty of the grain in Scotland in former times. It is copied from a MS. in the Editor's posses∣sion.</P>

<HEAD>XI. ANE LITTIL INTERLUD, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>Lord Hales observes on this singular piece, that <Q>some traces of theatrical composition may be dis∣covered in Scotland during the 16th century. Sir David Lindsay wrote several interludes.</Q></P>
<P>By the way, Sir David Lindsay was once a most po∣pular author in Scotland, witness the proverb, <HI>Its no in Davie Lindsay;</HI> meaning any thing out of the common road. He was in great celebrity in his own life time, about the period of the reformation. A story is told of an honest farmer, who being on his death-bed, a pious neighbour brought an English bible to read to him. The dying man had to that day never known of such a book, and, upon hearing some of its mi∣raculous contents, cried out, <HI>Hoot awa! Bring me Davie Lindsay. That's all a made story.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="222"/>St. 4, <HI>Fyn Mackowl.</HI>] 'Better known in England, says Lord Hales, <Q>under the modernised name of Fingal.—Concerning this personage, whether real or imaginary, there are innumerable legends in the highlands of Scotland. He is more celebrated as a giant, then as the hero of Ossian.</Q></P>
<P>On the next line, 'That dang the devill, &amp;c.' his lordship observes, <Q>This may allude to the contest with the spirit of Loda. Here let me observe, that to doubt Fingal and Temora being ancient compositions, is indeed, a refinement in scepticism. They contain various allusions to the manners of other times, which have escaped the observation of Mr. Macpher∣son himself.</Q></P>
<P>The Editor has been called a zealous defender of the antiquity of Ossian by those who had not understanding enough to perceive the scope of his dissertation on the Oral Tradition of Poetry; which only attempts to prove that poetry may be a long time preserved by tradition; without the slightest reference to Ossian's antiquity, but from probability only of preservation; which the candid reader will confess to be no argu∣ment. These people will stare when he assures them that, so far from being an advocate of Ossian's an∣tiquity, he does not regard twenty pages in the whole work as ancient, and has always expressed that notion.
<PB N="186" REF="223"/>Nay be must add that, if not two lines in the poems of Ossian are ancient, that circumstance would, if in∣fallibly proved, give an infinite addition in his opinion, to their superlative merit. So little has he of the spirit of an antiquary.</P>

<P><PB N="191" REF="228"/>This nobleman, who was certainly a great warrior, and is esteemed a hero by the defenders of Charles I. <Q>was diverse yeires very zealous for the covenant, and at the first time that the English came down to the kirks, when the Scots army lay at Dunslaw, the lot of his regiment was first to cross Tweed, whilk he did himself, in the midst of the winter, boots and all. Yet thereafter, at the subscryving of the league and covenant, finding that General Lesly was preferred to him, he changed his mind, and betook himself to the king's party.</Q> <HI>Scot of Scotstarvet's Staggering State of the Scottish Statesmen,</HI> MS. 1662. Heroes are mighty cheap baubles in the eyes of people of reflection and knowledge of mankind.</P>
<P>There is a curious account of his condemnation, &amp;c. in a MS. in the Editor's possession, intitled, <HI>A Letter of the proceedings of the parliament</HI> (of Scotland) <HI>Anno</HI> 1650, <HI>written from Edr. May</HI> 20, <HI>an.</HI> 1650, <HI>by Mr. Thomas Winzat, to his brother George Winzat,</HI> 4to.</P>
