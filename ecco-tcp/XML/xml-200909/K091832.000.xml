<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>EVERAL Pamphlets having from Time to Time been published
concerning the RO∣BINHOOD SOCIETY, some in Vindication of it, and others
against it, the public At∣tention has been awakened; and many have desired
to know the <PB N="vi" REF="4"/> Origin of this Society, and to be acquainted
with its Proceed∣ings, from it first Formation to its present State. But no
Work hitherto printed, has related these Particulars. Indeed, they have all
been so remarkably silent on these Heads, that, like the brave
<HI>Irishman,</HI> who, born of a com∣mon Prostitute, and unable to learn
who was his real Father, concluded he had none at all, many People imagine,
either that this Society had no Origin, or that it is so obscure and
uncer∣tain, that no Traces of it can now be discovered.</P>
<P>BUT this is a Mistake. A true and impartial Review of these 
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/> Particulars may be expected in these Memoirs; and it is
not doubted, but it will amply gratify the Curiosity of the Reader. If he
desires to know from whence these Materials have been drawn, I shall
inform him, that they were from Manuscripts of my Grandfather and Father; the
for∣mer of whom was not only a Member, but the Promoter of 
<Q REND="inline">"THE SOCIETIE FOR FREE AND CANDYD ENQUIRIE,"</Q>
for so were they at first called; and in∣deed, they have retained the Title
ever since.</P>
<P>AS to the History of the Mem∣bers of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY, for
1764, that, indeed, is intirely <PB N="viii" REF="6"/> my own Work. I have been
obli∣ged to no one for Anecdotes, but to the Members themselves; and I have,
with no small Pains and Industry, as well as Time and Expence, collected
from them such Accounts as the Reader will here meet with. Indeed, in a Work
of this Nature, some Anec∣dotes, not founded on Facts, must be expected;
Anecdotes invented by the Envy or Vanity of the Relater. But it is hoped, the
Number of these is but few: For the Author, or rather Compiler, has, when he
suspected the Truth of any Relation, not contented himself with having
something new to say, as too many of our Biographers and History-Writers 
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/> do; but has made the most dili∣gent Enquiries of
different People, to whom the several Members were intimately known, and
some as School-fellows; and from them he has learnt their real
<HI>Parentage</HI> and <HI>Education, Life, Character</HI> and
<HI>Behaviour:</HI> So that, in gene∣ral, these Memoirs may be deem∣ed as
authentic and genuine, as, perhaps, any that have been ever given to the World,
though they may not be so gaudily dressed.</P>
<P>THE Speeches I have given on different Subjects, as Specimens of
the Members Abilities, are, in the strict Sense of the Word,
<HI>Original;</HI> for they were taken <PB N="x" REF="8"/> down in Short-Hand,
at the very Time they were spoken.</P>
<P>THE Reader may now discern what he has to expect in this Work.
And, without the Im∣putation of Vanity, I think I may affirm, that the Public
will be both instructed and entertained in the Perusal of it. The ROBINHOOD
SOCIETY has, of late, greatly at∣tracted the Notice of the World; and is now
so much frequented, that, almost every <HI>Monday</HI> Night, Numbers are
robbed of the En∣tertainment they expect, because it is so crowded, that no
more can be admitted.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="9"/> TO those who have often at∣tended the
Society, and are ac∣quainted with the Nature of it, the Author of these
Memoirs ap∣peals for a Character of Candour and Impartiality; and he is
confi∣dent they will allow, that his De∣scription of the Debates is true and
faithful, his Portraits of the Members just and striking, and the Speeches
he has selected au∣thentic and <HI>original.</HI></P>
<P>HE will only add farther con∣cerning this Work, that he be∣lieves
no other MSS. but those he has in his Possession, containing the
Origin of the Society and its Proceedings, till it was re∣moved 
<PB N="xii" REF="10"/> to the <HI>Butcher-Row,</HI> are now extant.</P>
<P>AS then no other Person is able to trace the Original of the
Soci∣ety, and relate its Progress for no less a Term than 151 Years, (for
so long it has subsisted) he doubts not but his <HI>complete
History</HI> will favourably be received.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE <HI>Robinhood Society.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>English</HI> have been cha∣racterised by many
ingenious Foreigners, as a People that delight greatly in Clubs and
Assemblies; which they im∣pute to a social and good-natured
Dispo∣sition, and to a Love of Science. It is owing to this
Disposition, and to this af∣fection for Knowledge, that there is scarce a
Town or Village in our Kingdom, but <PB N="2" REF="12"/> what has its Clubs, or
Places of nocturnal Entertainment; where, after the Fatigues of the Day, Men of
various Occupations in Life, meet to dissipate the Gloom which has been
spread by Study, or any intense Application; and, by a mutual
Commu∣nication of Sentiment, either in Flashes of Wit, or solid Argument,
to improve their Judgments, and entertain their Imagi∣nations.</P>
<P>SUCH is the favourable Point of View in which judicious Foreigners
behold our natural Propensity of forming and fre∣quenting Clubs; and such
their Description of the good Effects resulting from them.</P>
<P>BUT, I am afraid, that though some Clubs produce these
Effects, the Genera∣rality of them produce the Reverse; and may be deemed
Receptacles for the Idle and the Dissolute, where Modesty is thrown
aside, like their Great Coats, and where Impiety, Obscenity, and
Li∣centiousness prevail to the greatest Degree; where a Love of
Laziness, and an Aversion to honest Industry are contracted; where the
keeping ill Hours is encouraged, to the great Detriment of Individuals, and to
the Prejudice of the Community; and <PB N="3" REF="13"/> where, in short, no
useful Subject em∣ploys their Thoughts or Tongues, but mere Noise and
Nonsense, obscene Songs or Tales, and large Draughts of Liquor, form
their Savage Happiness.</P>
<P>BUT, however true this Description may be of Clubs in general,
it cannot be said, that the particular Kind of Club, re∣sembling that of
the ROBINHOOD, is of their Nature, or produces their Effects: Those are
<HI>Drinking Clubs;</HI> this is a <HI>Dis∣puting</HI> one. At those
Places, Men meet to feed their Bodies; at this, they assemble to feed their
Minds. At those, Intoxi∣cation is very frequent; at this, very rare. I could
heighten the Contrast, but it is needless. The Perusal of these Sheets
will sufficiently acquaint the Reader with the Nature and Tendency of the
ROBINHOOD SOCIETY, and of Disputing Clubs in general; and therefore, without
striving to biass his Judgment, or preclude his Re∣marks by any of my own,
I shall proceed to my Account of 
<Q REND="inline">"THE SOCIETY FOR FREE AND CANDID ENQUIRY",</Q>
from its infant State, to its present mature Growth, at the ROBINHOOD and
LITTLE JOHN, in <HI>Butcher-Row.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="14"/> IN the Year 1613, when that fine Piece of
Work, equally honourable and useful, the <HI>New River</HI> was completed,
Sir HUGH MYDDLETON, who had a great Affection and Regard for my Grand-father,
WIL∣LIAM G********, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> being in Com∣pany with him one Day,
lamented it as a great Infelicity, and a vast Obstruction of human
Knowledge, that light and trivial Subjects alone generally found Admittance
into polite Companies, while important and weighty ones were excluded. My
Grand-father acquiesced with him in Sen∣timents, and proposed it as his
Opinion, that a Society might be formed to consist of a certain Number of
Gentlemen, of li∣beral Education and acquired Accomplish∣ments, to meet
Weekly, at some conve∣nient Room, to discourse on Subjects that would
contribute to their mutual Instruc∣tion and Entertainment. Sir HUGH de∣clared
it was a lucky Suggestion, and he would think of it at Leisure, and let him
know his Opinion of the Practicability of putting such a Scheme into
Execution the next Time he saw him.</P>
<P>THE Intimacy that had, for many Years, subsisted between Sir
HUGH and my Grand∣father, <PB N="5" REF="15"/> would not permit their being
ab∣sent for any considerable Time after this Meeting, and the Starting of a
Subject which had such Charms for both. My Grand-father was a good Speaker,
and no bad Writer. In the juvenile Part of his Life, he had been engaged in
mercantile Business in a very extensive Manner; and conducting his
Affairs with Skill and Pru∣dence for about seven-and-twenty Years, he had
amassed no less a Sum than forty-seven thousand Pounds; with which,
con∣trary to a great Number of Merchants, being contented, he retired from
Business, and lived on the Interest of his Fortune. As to Sir HUGH, he
was a Man of ex∣treme good natural Parts, heightened and embellished by the
Acquisition of the use∣ful and ornamental Parts of Learning; and having, at
the Expence of the greatest Part of an opulent Fortune, completed his darling
Project of bringing Water from <HI>Ware,</HI> through various Turnings and
Windings, to <HI>London,</HI> thereby supplying that great Metropolis with
one of the greatest Necessaries of Life, he had now Leisure to
consider of other Employ∣ments, and partake of other Amusements, not less
suited to his Taste, and for which he was not less qualified. At the
Meet∣ing <PB N="6" REF="16"/> my Grand-father and Sir HUGH had at the oldest
Tavern in <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>Lon∣don Stone,</HI> in
<HI>Cannon-Street,</HI> over a Bottle of sound Red Port, and, while
smoaking a Pipe of the new-found Plant, Tobacco, (which had been introduced
into <HI>England</HI> by Sir WALTER RALEIGH, but about twenty-five Years
before) they discoursed at large of the Advantages that might be reaped
from a Society of judicious Persons, meet∣ing once a Week to debate on
Subjects of Importance. For an Account of the In∣stitution and Nature of the
Society, I am indebted to a Folio Book, which I have now in my Custody, in my
Grand-father's own Hand-writing, and from which I have transcribed the
following Passages.</P>
<Q>IT was here (says the good old Man) that wee fully
discoursed of the Affaire. Sir HUGH declared the Number of Per∣sons that
were to compose our Societie ought to be limitted, and that they shoulde
not exceede twentie; and in fine, wee both agreed in this Point, that wee
woulde forthwith looke out and search for proper Persons to be∣longe to the
Societie, and whose Names wee woulde enter into a little Booke: And after
that we had gained our pro∣posed <PB N="7" REF="17"/> Number of Persons,
which wee alsoe agreed shoulde be noe more than twentie, nor less than
twelve, wee would assembel oureselves once in a Week, at a House of one
of the So∣cietie, and the next Week, at the House of another, and so on
'till wee had been at each other's House. After wee had spoken of these
Things, and fully agreed thereon, as I have here amply related, wee parted; Sir
HUGH going to a Countrie House he had late∣lie rented at <HI>Mile-end,</HI>
and I going to mine in <HI>Norfolk-Street.</HI></Q>
<Q>ABOUT one Moneth after this, wee had gotten the Number of fifteen
Per∣sons, all of whome were Men of good∣lie Parts and discreete and worthie
Conduct; and at the Intreatie of my verie good Friende Sir HUGH, wee met all of
us at the <HI>London-Stone,</HI> of a <HI>Wed∣nesday</HI> Night, to write
downe our Names in a Booke, and to abide by, and agree to, a few Articles,
which were drawne up by Sir HUGH, which conteined all the Rules that wee would
be subject to, and which I think meet here to set down.</Q>
<P><PB N="8" REF="18"/> LET not the Reader think me too
cir∣cumstantial for giving him the Articles which this Society of
Disputants drew up and signed: Any Thing relative to the Institution of a
Society which has since that Time made such Noise in the World, cannot be
uninteresting; on the contrary, it may afford greater Pleasure to a curious
Person, than the Perusal of the trifling Anecdotes that the most eminent
History-Writers often swell their Works with, or even than many Papers that
are obtruded on the World by a certain Society, who yet deem themselves great
Philosophers.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLES and RULES Which WEE, The undernamed PERSONS,
Do hereby agree to abide bye, and to performe.</HEAD>
<P>First, THAT we do agree to com∣pose and forme a
Socie∣tie, which shall be styled and called, <PB N="9" REF="19"/> THE

<P>Second, That wee will assemble and meet at each

Esquier, the second Weeke, and at the succeed∣ing thirteene Gentlemens

<P>Sixth, That wee do agree that noe Question that is

for us to handel, nor a proper Objecte for the Enquiryes of studious Men, who
wante onlie to cultivate and to mende their reasonable Faculties. Besides,
it is flying in the Face of the Kinge himself, whose sole Business it

<P><PB N="13" REF="23"/>THE first Meeting which this Society of
Gentlemen had, was the <HI>Monday</HI> subse∣quent to the Drawing up and
Signing the foregoing Articles, being the 20th Day of <HI>October,</HI> 1613.
At Seven o'Clock in the Evening, precisely, they all met at Sir HUGH
MYDDLETON'S Town House, which was in the <HI>Strand;</HI> and, after
con∣gratulating each other on their proposed Undertaking, and drinking two
Glasses of Wine each, Sir HUGH got into a large Elbow Chair, and officiated
as President, the rest being seated in common Chairs, placed there for
that Purpose.</P>
<P>SIR HUGH then read the Question to them, for their Night's
Debate; which was as follows:</P>
<Q>Whether the common Methods of edu∣cateing Youth, in this Nation,
are not very defective, both with respecte to Morals, and a Knowledge of the
<HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Tongue?</Q>
<P>THIS Question, the Reader will per∣ceive, was a very good one,
and worthy the Consideration of the most respectable Society. I might be
thought unpardonably <PB N="14" REF="24"/> prolix, were I to transcribe the
long Ac∣count which my Grand-father has given of the Debate upon this
Question, and the many learned and ingenious Arguments produced by the
several Members; yet it would be equally unpardonable, to omit the capital
Arguments, and pass over in Silence the Manner in which this first
Question of <HI>The Society for Free and Can∣did Enquiry,</HI> was
handled.</P>
<P>Sir HUGH, after he had read the Ques∣tion, asked if any of the
Gentlemen pre∣sent chose to deliver his sentiments of it to the Company.
On which Mr. WHI∣TAKER got up, and in a learned Speech pointed out the many
errors, which, he apprehended, prevailed in the then defec∣tive System of
Education. He expatiated on the Folly of the major Part of Parents of the lower
Class, in sending their Sons to School, to learn many Parts of Educa∣tion,
which it was almost impossible, and highly improbable, from their
situation in life, they could possibly ever have any Occasion for. He
then pointed out the erroneous Methods that Schoolmasters in general made
Use of, to introduce Youth to the Knowledge of the Languages;
di∣stinguished with great Propriety and Pre∣cision, the various
Qualifications that <PB N="15" REF="25"/> ought to centre in that Person, that
took on him the arduous Business of fashioning the juvenile Mind, and
instilling the Prin∣ciples of Science; and shewed how these various
Qualifications ought to be exerted towards those committed to their Care, if
any Fruit was to be expected from the young Nursery. He then considered the
Business of Education, so far as it related to the Morals of Youth: And
here he lamented, that the most important should be the most neglected
Branch of Educa∣tion; that the inculcating the great Duties of Religion and
Morality, should be look'd on as of such small moment, as to be to∣tally
disregarded; and, in fine, that the System of Education in general, left
the Minds of Youth unfurnished with real Knowledge, and their Hearts
uninfluenced by the great Principles of Christianity.</P>
<P>MY Grand-father enforced this Speech of Mr. WHITAKER by some
additional Arguments, and placing the others in a stronger and more
striking Light. But the best, and most remarkable Speech, is that which
was made by Mr. JERVIS, who was, as appears by my MS. at that time
possessed of a Place at Court, which pro∣duced him upwards of thirteeen
hundred <PB N="16" REF="26"/> Pounds a Year; an immense Sum at that time! This
Speech, in my Opinion, is so good, and the Complaint he makes of the
defective Methods of Education in those Days, so well adapted to the
<HI>modern</HI> Me∣thod of Education, that, I think, I can∣not do better than
give his Speech at full Length.</P>
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<P> THIS Question, Mr. President, is certainly of the
last Importance, and worthy of the most serious Considera∣tion. The
forming of the Minds of Youth, and implanting in them such Seeds as, when
ripened to Maturity, may bring forth much good Fruit, is, in my Opinion, of
more Moment than any other Subject about which we may interest ourselves;
and therefore de∣serves to be fully spoken to.</P>
<P> THE human Mind has been compa∣red, by antient Writers, to
a Piece of Wax, that may be moulded to any Form, and is capable of receiving
any Impression, while it is young and pli∣able; but when it grows old and
stiff, it is with the utmost Labour, and at a vast Expence of Time, that
we can imprint the Shape of what we desire, on it. <PB N="17" REF="27"/> From
hence we may and must infer, that it is the Duty of every Parent to train up
his Child to such Learning, as may in time qualify him to be a worthy Member
of that Community to which he belongs: And let it be considered too, that
Youth is the best Time for doing this, for the Reason before as∣signed,
and also, because such Princi∣ples both of Religion, Morality and
Learning, which are inculcated, or, as it were, engraved on his Heart, will
grow with his Growth, and strengthen with his Strength, and at length will be
written on the Tablet of his Soul, in such deep and legible Characters, as
Time itself shall not be able to erase. Consider too, Gentlemen, it is
far ea∣sier to learn good things, than to unlearn bad ones, which, I
apprehend, there is some Necessity of doing, according to the present
System of Education pre∣vailing in this Kingdom, and which I shall now
endeavour to prove.</P>
<P> IN the first Place then, I think, that the true End of
Education is both grosly neglected, and manifestly perverted by the
Professors of it, not duly consider∣ing the Difference of Genius in Boys,
<PB N="18" REF="28"/> the different Conditions of Life in which they are placed,
and the different Pro∣fessions and Trades they are designed for.
Education is like a vast Bason of fine Water, which belongs to a large
Town, and to which every Inhabitant has an equal Right; but every one that
would receive the Advantages of it, must furnish Conduit-Pipes to direct it
to his own House, in like Manner as our worthy President first planned,
and has now compleated, the Current of <HI>Ware</HI> Water, to the House of
every Inhabitant in <HI>London.</HI> But if our Pro∣fessors of Education do
not duly consi∣der the Capacities of those intrusted to their Care, but
furnish the Heads of intended Taylors, Barbers, and Shoe∣makers, with such
Branches of Learn∣ing, as are not only ornamental, but absolutely
necessary in Divines, Law∣yers, Physicians, or Gentlemen of Rank, who
want to make a Figure in the World, then Education may be truly said, like
Water running to Waste, though extremely good in it∣self, to be of no real
service to any one, but rather a Misfortune to the educated Person; since
the Length of Time employed in gathering Chaff, <PB N="19" REF="29"/> might have
been much better employed in reaping Corn; by which, I mean such Parts of
Education as are necessary for such particular Person.</P>
<P> When a Person, like that I have been describing,
arrives to an Age, when Reason begins to exert itself, and to blaze forth
with a considerable Degree of Lustre, he finds he has miserably mispent
his Time, in learning Things which can possibly be of no Service to him,
and neglecting those which are necessary to his going through life with
Credit to himself, and Utility to So∣ciety in general. Before he can
furnish himself with Pieces of useful Know∣ledge, it is necessary
that he divest him∣self of some Prejudices which he must have
contracted, and some Things which he must have learnt, while at School: And
it is not less difficult to do these Things, than to gain new and useful
Acquisitions, in travelling the Road of Science, and rambling in the Fields
of Learning. Since then Sub∣stances, not Shadows, Things, not Sounds,
deserve the Attention of a wise Man, it is highly necessary, that
Wisdom and real Learning, should be taught in our public Schools and
Semi∣naries. <PB N="20" REF="30"/> But it may be asked, what are Wisdom and
real Learning? I answer, a thorough Knowledge of the Princi∣ples of the
Christian Religion, and of the great Duties of Morality, and a competent
Knowledge of the <HI>English</HI> Tongue. But neither of these, I
ap∣prehend, are taught. The dead Lan∣guages only engross the Attention, and
excite the Care of Tutors and School∣masters: And, indeed, if a Knowledge of
those Languages would facilitate the Attainment of Wisdom itself, and
mend the Morals of those that learn them, it would be a useful and an
ornamental Part of Education to every one; not only to the Prince, but
Peasant; not only to the Nobleman or Divine, but to the Tradesman and
Artificer. But I will be bold to say, these Things are not so, nor do
they produce these ef∣fects. A Knowledge of the Languages, is not Knowledge
itself, but a Key only, that being in the Hands of People of Rank and
Fortune, or those of the learned Professions, may by them be made an
Instrument to unlock and open the Chests of Knowledge, from whence they may
load themselves with Trea∣sure; but the same Things taken from 
<PB N="21" REF="31"/> these Chests of Knowledge, are not only of no Value to
Men in mean Trades, or to low Artisans, but abso∣lutely an Incumbrance.</P>
<P> NAY, we may go still farther, and assert, that the
learning of some particular Branches of Literature, has manifestly a bad
Tendency to encourage in the Minds of those Youths intended for Trade, such
Notions of Things as will absolutely disqualify them from excel∣ling in
their Businesses; for, instead of endeavouring to become eminent in
their Trades, they will be ambitious of being thought great Scholars; though,
after all, perhaps, the Rudiments and first Principles of Learning only they
have Capacities for acquiring. Hence a mistaken Notion of their Superiority
over others in the same humble Stations of Life will arise; and the Pride
and Vanity they possess, and which lead them to disdain their Fellows,
will in∣fallibly draw down on them <HI>their</HI> Con∣tempt and Indignation,
and the Laugh∣ter or Pity of the rest of Mankind. By these Means, Men that
might have become useful Members, turn Pests of Society, or, at least,
mere excrescences; <PB N="22" REF="32"/> and thus is the Community robbed of
the Industry and Genius of many Indi∣viduals, whose Talents, if diverted
into a proper Channel, and exerted on pro∣per Objects, might have brought
Ho∣nour to their Country, Improvement to their particular Trade, and Profit to
themselves and Family.</P>
<P> THE Care and Attention of a School∣master ought to be
immediately directed to these Points. He should endeavour to discover the
particular Genius which every Boy possesses; for there is no Boy but
has a Genius for some Art or Science more than another; and it ought to be
cherished, and cultivated to the utmost. Many a Man, for Want of a due
Attention to this Rule, now cuts a despicable Figure as a Poverty-struck
Physician, who might have proved an ingenious Painter, and have acquired
great Fame and Wealth: And many a dull Clergyman now thumps a Cushion, or
reads a dull Composition to a drowsy Audience, who might have proved an
excellent Cutler, and furnished the World with such Wares as might have
engrossed the Trade in that Branch of Manufac∣ture <PB N="23" REF="33"/> to
<HI>Britain</HI> alone, which is now shared by other Nations.</P>
<P> BESIDES, consider too, Gentlemen, that the Time we are
at School is by far too long, and too precious to be thrown idly away; which it
most cer∣tainly is, if not properly employ'd. No less than seven or eight
Years is thought sufficient to lay in a proper Stock of Learning, even for
the lowest Rank of People; and what that Learning is, I have before told you.
For my Part, I must pronounce it a most ridiculous Piece of Vanity, in the
lowest Order of People, to have their Children taught <HI>Latin, Greek,
French,</HI> the Mathema∣tics, or any other Branch of Literature, which is not
immediately necessary and requisite to them in the Trades they are
designed for: And I would gladly know, whether, to weigh a Pound of Rasins
or Sugar, to make a full-bot∣tomed Peruque, to cut out a Suit of Cloaths, or to
sell a Pair of Shoes, a Man that is illiterate is not as well qua∣lified as
he that understands <HI>Algebra</HI> or <HI>Greek?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="34"/> I AM not, Gentlemen, speaking
against the Utility of such Branches of Learning; but I am for confining
them to their proper Learners: nor am I to be understood as an Enemy to
Tradesmen and Artisans partaking of the common Advantages that flow from
Literature; but I am for limitting them to such Branches of it as may be for
their own Good. What these Branches are is very evident; a Know∣ledge of
their own Tongue, so as to be capable of reading and speaking it with
Propriety; a Knowledge of the Principles of their Religion; and a Knowledge
also of Writing and Arith∣metic: And these, in my Opinion, are sufficient
for People intended for mean Trades.</P>
<P> I SHALL now, Gentlemen, shew you another Defect in the
Conduct of our Schools; and that is, an improper Choice of Books. Sure I am,
that a great Number of Books now univer∣sally made Use of, are a Disgrace
to Humanity, and a Scandal to a Christian Nation. It has ever been an Opinion
of mine, that without a Perusal of <PB N="25" REF="35"/> HORACE, JUVENAL,
CATULLUS, MARTIAL, in our tender Years, we might attain a thorough Knowledge of
the <HI>Latin</HI> Language; and we might understand <HI>Greek</HI> without
learning ARISTOPHANES. All these Authors were great Libertines, and speak
of a de∣testable Vice, that reflects Dishonour on Human Nature, in such
Terms, as shew their Approbation and Practice of it; and I must declare it
as my Opinion, that had such Authors not have men∣tioned it in the Manner
they do, the Vice itself would have been unknown to, and unpractised by
succeeding Ages. Were there no other Cause but this, those Authors ought
never to enter a School; and surely, the Impossibility of learning
<HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> without them, can never be pleaded, when we
have <HI>Christian</HI> Writers that have written on the most important
Subjects, in a pure and classical Style, in such great Num∣bers.</P>
<P> THE Knowledge of the <HI>English</HI> Tongue is of the
last Importance to every one; but this great Branch is al∣most entirely
neglected. We do not learn to <HI>speak</HI> it at all; and how we are 
<PB N="26" REF="36"/> taught to <HI>read</HI> it, I leave to every one's own
Experience. In <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> which, perhaps, we have no
Occasion to make Use of above once a Year, no Pains, no Expence, is thought
too great to make us Adepts; but to make us speak <HI>English</HI> well,
which we have Occasion to do every Day of our Lives, no Expence, no Pains are
bestowed on us.</P>
<P> In these several Particulars I have mentioned, I
think the common Me∣thods of educating Youth in this Na∣tion, are very
defective; and, I think, that Man who would point out a proper Remedy for
these Diseases, would de∣serve well of Society, and be justly
considered as a Friend to Mankind in general. I shall mention one, which, I
think, would contribute not a little to cure the Disorders that must
inevita∣bly ensue from the present defective System; for he must be a
bad Man who shews us our Unhappiness, and does not in some Measure
endeavour to re∣move it.</P>
<P> THE remedy then which I imagine would be serviceable in
the literary Dis∣ease <PB N="27" REF="37"/> I am speaking of, is, to
compel all those who set up public Schools for the Education of Youth, to
wait on four or five Clergymen of Integrity and Learn∣ing, to be examined with
Respect to their Abilities, and to receive under their Hands, duly
attested, proper Cer∣tificates of their being capable of under∣taking that
great Work, previous to their actually engaging in it. Were this to be done,
the Number of School∣masters would be greatly reduced; but it would excite a
sufficient Number of able Men to engage in the Business of Teaching, as
the fewer there were of them, the greater would be their Profit.</P>
<P>I COULD point out more Methods, Mr. President, to
advance Education, but I have been already too prolix, and therefore shall
trespass no more on your Time at present, but propose a Ques∣tion on
that Subject for our debating some future evening.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>How far these Complaints of one of the first Members of the
Disputing Society, made one hundred and fifty one Years ago, were just,
appears by the unanimous Ap∣plause my Grand-father has observed was 
<PB N="28" REF="38"/> given to his Speech: And how far appli∣cable his
Observations on the defective Sy∣stem of Education then in Vogue, are to
the present, I leave to the Determination of every learned Reader.</P>
<P>THE subsequent <HI>Monday,</HI> being the 27th of
<HI>October,</HI> 1613, the Society met for the second Time. This Meeting was
held at the House of THOMAS VENNE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Man of an immense
Fortune, and great Erudition, at his House in St. <HI>James's
Square.</HI></P>
<P>THE Question debated that Evening, was,</P>
<Q>Whether, notwithstanding the Complaints made both by the Clergye
and Laitye of the Degeneracye of the Age, the Moderns are not more virtuous and
wise than the Ancients?</Q>
<P>IN discussing this Question, many learn∣ed and ingenious
Arguments were produ∣ced by the Members, in Support both of the Affirmative and
Negative Sides of it: But the major Part of the Society were for the
Affirmative, and evidently demon∣strated the Superiority of the then
present <PB N="29" REF="39"/> Age to any former, both with Respect to their
Knowledge of the Arts and Sciences, and their leading more exemplary Lives.
They proved these two Opinions, by the infallible Evidence of Scripture,
drawing a Comparison between the Principles and Manners of the People of old,
with the present, wherein the latter appeared infi∣nitely more wise, and
not near so wicked as the Holy Writings inform us the World antiently was.
They then enquired into the Cause of public Speakers and Writers
representing the Degeneracy of the Age in such lively Colours, and their
being sunk deeper into the Pits of Iniquity and Ignorance than any former
Ages; and they supposed it to arise from the Want of a Relish for
innocent Gratifications, in those public Speakers and Writers; from their
having been disappointed in their Pur∣suits and Expectations, which
sowered their Minds, and gave them a Disgust to the World; and from Pride
and Vani∣ty, which swelling their Souls, and in∣toxicating their
Imaginations, made them look down with Contempt from their own fancied Height
of Excellence, on those they imagined so far beneath them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="40"/> THE next Time of their Meeting was on
<HI>Monday</HI> the 3d of <HI>November,</HI> at my Grand-father's House near
<HI>Charing-Cross;</HI> but I should be too prolix, were I to relate the
Particulars of this Meeting, and the several Arguments which this ingenious
Set of Gentlemen made Use of in the debating of their Question. I shall
how∣ever inform my Reader what that Question was, and mention a few others,
which were debated in their Turn at the Houses of the other Members.</P>
<Q>Whether, from the various Accounts gi∣ven to us in Historie, we
may not reasonablie conclude, that <HI>Demost∣henes</HI> was a greater
Orator than <HI>Cicero?</HI></Q>
<Q>Whether the Manufacture of Broad Cloth might not be carried to a
still greater Degree of Perfection?</Q>
<P>THIS Question was agreed by the So∣ciety to be debated on again
the next <HI>Mon∣day</HI> Night, which was the 24th of <HI>Novem∣ber;</HI> and
the Subject being, in their Opinion, of the greatest Importance, and not
ex∣hausted, after they had again discussed it <PB N="31" REF="41"/> that
Evening, it was agreed that it should be a Subject for their Entertainment a
third Night.</P>
<Q>Whether Emulation in brave and noble Minds, and Envy in cowardly
and base ones, are not Acquirements in the Possessors own Power?</Q>
<P>ON this Question I must remark, that, however intelligible it
might be at that Time of the Day, it is not so now; nor do I see what
Purpose the proposing it could serve—no Debates appear by my
Manuscript to have been made upon it.</P>
<Q>Whether the Improvement of our Heads and the Improvement of our
Hearts, do not go Hand in Hand?</Q>
<Q>What Kind of Education is the most proper for a Nobleman, a
Gentleman, and a Tradesman?</Q>
<Q>What Regulations or Improvements are needful to be made, in Order
to ad∣vance the great Work of Education in this Kingdom?</Q>
<Q><PB N="32" REF="42"/>Whether, if a Committee or Number of Gentlemen
of acknowledged Abilities, were appointed either to draw up, or to alter the
Epitaphs which, according to the present Method, disgrace our Church-Yards,
it would not reflect Honour on the Nation, and excite a higher Opinion of our
Wisdom in the Minds of judicious Foreigners?</Q>
<Q>Whether the Stage, under proper Regu∣lations, might not be made an
Aid to Wisdom, an Enforcer of Virtue, and a Supplement to the Pulpit?</Q>
<Q>Whether a Spendthrift or a Miser, is the most useless
Member of the Com∣munity?</Q>
<P>ON this Question, my Grand-father made a Remark, which I cannot
forbear transcribing.</P>
<Q>A Spendthrift, says he, is like a Grashopper, and a Miser
like a Jack∣daw. The former dissipates his Sub∣stance, and sings away
his Time, in his Summer of Life, regardless of what may happen to him in
Winter, and <PB N="33" REF="43"/> not considering that wilful Waste brings
woeful Want; and the latter hides the Treasure he has collected, and which he
can never enjoy. They both are Fools, and unfit for Society; but the Miser, I
think, is most so. The Miser is a mere Muckworm, a Dunghill∣maker, that
has brought together a Quantity of Manure, which, if pro∣perly distributed,
would enrich the na∣tional Soil; the Spendthrift, however an Enemy to
himself, is the generous Hand that scatters the rich Dung, that doth Good
to Thousands.</Q>
<Q>Whether the Difference of Genius, obser∣vable in the People of
different Na∣tions, is owing to the Climate, Soil, Form of Government, or
Education?</Q>
<Q>Whether an hypocritical Sinner, or an open and audacious one, be
the greatest Enemy to Society?</Q>
<P>SUCH were the first thirteen Questions debated by the then
infant Society, at their Meetings at the Members Houses; the last of which
was held at the House of my Grand-father.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="44"/> I SHALL now take a Liberty frequently used
by Biographers, and other Writers, that of skipping over a long Space of
Time, in which nothing material happened in the Society, save that it
increased in Numbers and in Fame.</P>
<P>FOR no less than eight-and-twenty Years was it continued on the
same Principles, and conducted in the same Manner, as at its first
Establishment, during all which Time my Grand-father belonged to it, who
has not only preserved in a large Folio Book all the Questions proposed,
but also the Debates on those that were more particu∣larly interesting,
or which more forcibly excited his Curiosity.</P>
<P>FROM whatever Cause it was owing, I know not, but for half a
Year the Society was adjourned, which was the Summer of 1641. I have been
sometimes tempted to impute it to the particular Severity of the Usurper's
Government, and the criti∣cal Exigency of the Times; but that could not be the
Case, as the Meetings were again held in <HI>October,</HI> being at the Time
of the dreadful <HI>Irish</HI> Massacre, when no less than 45,000 Souls
were cruelly mur∣dered; <PB N="35" REF="45"/> though some Writers, for some
sinister Views, or Reasons best known to themselves, have
diminished the Numbers that fell by the Hands of the Murderers, more than
two-thirds.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after their assembling toge∣ther again, a great Number
of Gentlemen of Rank and Fortune, having heard of their Fame, and approving
their Scheme, offered themselves as Members: But the Society imagining that
it would be ex∣tremely inconvenient for a greater Number of Members to meet
together, refused ad∣mitting them, and declared they would not alter, or
break in on their original Plan.</P>
<P>IN this Manner they continued 'till the Restoration of King
CHARLES II. in 1660; and to shew in what Esteem they were held, I shall
transcribe the following curious Anecdote, which the Reader may depend on as
a Matter of Fact.</P>
<Q>OUR Society now began to attract the public Attention in a very
particu∣lar Manner, and was so much discour∣sed of, and so
universally applaused, that it even excited Majesty itself to pay 
<PB N="36" REF="46"/> us a Visit. He was introduced to us by Sir HUGH, who
inform'd us he was a distant Relation of his; that coming lately from the
Country, and hearing of our Fame, as he expressed it, was desirous of
hearing himself those Debates which the World talk'd so loudly of. Now
several of us would have known the King, had he appear'd in <HI>propriâ
Personâ,</HI> but he had put a Piece of black Silk over his left Cheek,
which almost cover'd it; and his Eye∣brows which were quite black, he had by
some Artifice or other, converted to a light brown, or rather to a flaxen
Colour, and had disguised himself in his Apparel and Looks so
effectually, that none of us knew him; and of this Circumstance my good
Friend, Sir HUGH, was entirely silent 'till two Years afterwards, being, no
Doubt, so caution'd by his Majesty.</Q>
<P>THIS little Anecdote throws a farther Light on the Character of
that facetious Monarch, who, as we may gather from History, lov'd a Frolic at
his Heart, and was never happier than when at some pub∣lic Entertainments, or
Assemblies, of his Subjects, where he might throw off the 
<PB N="37" REF="47"/> cumbrous Robes of Majesty, and give a free and natural
Vent to his humorous Dis∣position. I find that he was so well
en∣tertain'd with the Debates of the Society, that he came there three Times
more, and expressed himself greatly satisfied with an Institution,
which, he declared, had so great a Tendency to enlarge the Mind, and to
refine the Taste.</P>
<P>THE Society had now existed forty-seven Years, and of the
Members that first form'd it, two only surviv'd, my Grand∣father and Sir
HUGH. But it being like the immortal Regiment of FREDERICK II. King of
<HI>Prussia,</HI> supplied with new Mem∣bers as the old ones dropp'd off,
there was no Doubt of its Dissolution, especially as they took Care to
elect such Men only as were possessed of Integrity and Abilities; for
it was an invariable Maxim with them that none but such should be admitted,
let their Station in Life, Age, Connections, or Fortune, be what they
would.</P>
<P>FIVE Years after this Time, the dread∣ful Plague happen'd, which
carried off no less than sixty-eight Thousand five Hundred and
eighty-six Souls, Men, Women, and Children. Among them was my Grand∣father, 
<PB N="38" REF="48"/> who, after being seized with it, and continuing
excessively ill for eleven Days, departed this Life in the
eighty-se∣venth Year of his Age, having for the last fifty-two Years been a
Member of the Society for free Enquiry, of which he was the first Proposer
and Promoter, and, with the Assistance of Sir HUGH MYDDLE∣TON, the chief
Establisher.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE <HI>Robinhood Society.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>ITHERTO we have been enabled to compile this Histo∣ry by the
Manuscript of my Grand-father. He has been, as it were, our Polar Star, by
whose Light we have directed our Course; and if that Light shall be
adjudged suffi∣cient to reflect a Splendor on so obscure a Subject as
that which we have attemp∣ted, <PB N="40" REF="50"/> (a Subject whose
Original, Rise, and Progress cannot, I believe, be traced with greater
Fidelity, involved as it is in the Darkness of Time) and to satisfy the
Expectations of the Reader, we shall think ourselves very happy. It is
true, that we could have been more minute in the Description of several
Things; could have transcribed many Speeches of various Members on different
Subjects, which we have entirely omitted; and have given <HI>all</HI> the
Questions that were debated by the Society from their first
Establishment in 1613, to the Time of my Grand-father's Death in 1665. But
the doing these Things we have conceived unnecessary, since it must
have been very dry and in∣sipid to our Readers, a very disagreeable Task
for ourselves, and would have swel∣led this History to an enormous
Size.</P>
<P>WE shall now, in this Second Part, continue our History from
my Grand∣father's Death, till the Removal of the Society to the
<HI>Essex-Head</HI> in <HI>Essex-Street,</HI> when its original Plan
was alter'd, and its Conduct became very different; and shew its various
Fortune, till its last Trans∣migration to the <HI>Robinhood</HI> in
<HI>Butcher-Row,</HI> where it now continues to be held.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="51"/> MY Father, for some Years before my
Grand-father's Death, had been admitted a Member of the Society, and was looked
on as a very intelligent and worthy Man. He was not less fond of it than my
Grand∣father, and no less particular in transcri∣bing from the Club-Book
the various Que∣stions that were inserted there, and the several
Arguments that passed <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> on the Subjects, when
they came to be debated. This he performed in the same large Folio Book my
Grand-father made Use of for the same Purpose; and which being now in my
Possession, enables me to compile this Work.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1667 the Society had some Thoughts of enlarging
their Plan, and admitting more Members. They had re∣ceived Applications from
several Men of Quality, and great Numbers of others di∣stinguished for
Wit and Judgment, for their being admitted to partake of the In∣struction and
Entertainment which their Debates afforded; but so general an Ad∣mission
was deemed impracticable, on Ac∣count of the great Inconvenience the Members
would all be put to, in their Turn, to entertain so many Persons, and 
<PB N="42" REF="52"/> therefore such Applications were to no Purpose.</P>
<P>OCCASIONAL Visitants had been, how∣ever, allowed the Liberty of
being present at the Debates, and to speak themselves to the Question
if they thought proper. Re∣straint irritates Desire, and Things forbid∣den
have greater Charms for Mankind, than those they are at free Liberty to
en∣joy. So proved it with those Gentlemen, who, though they had been
present at the Debates of the Society, were not Mem∣bers of it. Enraged to
find they had not the Liberty of becoming Members, they deviated from the
Questions they should have spoken to; and complained, that a Society that
was not free for the Reception of every one in general that had an Incli∣nation
to frequent it, could have no good Effect, and that, supposing its
Influence on the Manners and Principles of those that attended it ever so
great, the Public in general could reap no Advantage from it.</P>
<P>IN this Manner the Society went on for some Time, and the
Debates were a mot∣ly Mixture of angry Censures and solid Arguments,
Animadversions on the Que∣stions proposed, and Complaints of the 
<PB N="43" REF="53"/> narrow Spirit of the Society: So that the original
Intention of the first Members was entirely frustrated, and the
Satisfaction and Pleasure which must always arise from a reciprocal
Communication of Sentiments between learned and ingenious Men, gave Way to
private Cabals and personal Invec∣tives; which will ever check the Growth of
Knowledge, and choak up the Paths of Truth.</P>
<P>TO put a Stop to these Proceedings, one of the Members, a Man of
a violent Spirit, and boisterous Disposition, proposed it to the
Consideration of the Society, whether it would not be adviseable to
refuse Admit∣tance, for the future, to any Gentleman whatever, that might
desire to be an occa∣sional Visitant, and to make such an Order in
their Book. And he gave it as his Opi∣nion, that without doing it, the Society
must soon fall to the Ground, by the Up∣roar and tumultuous Proceedings
which frequently prevailed there.</P>
<P>HE was seconded in his Motion by ano∣ther of the Members, a Man
of like Tem∣per with himself; who also gave it as his Opinion, that no
Person whatever, let his Fortune or Rank in Life be what it would, 
<PB N="44" REF="54"/> ought to be admitted as an occasional Visi∣tant. He
observed, that their Society was of a private Nature; and that, for People to
insist on pushing into their Company, and hearing their Sentiments of Men
and Things, whether they would or not, was an unparallelled Piece of
Assurance, and equally unmannerly with a Beggar, that, cloathed in Rags and
Wretchedness, yet, full of a true <HI>Hibernian</HI> Impudence, would force
his Way into a Gentleman's Parlour against his Consent. He expatiated
largely on the Folly of first permitting any Gentle∣man to attend there who
was not a Mem∣ber, and observed, that though it was a Custom to grant
such Permission, yet the Breach of foolish Customs is better than the
Observance of them: And concluded, by remarking, that if they had, in that
Re∣spect, travelled on in a wrong Road for fif∣teen Years last past,
there was no Reason they should still travel in it, especially as they
had then experienced the Inconveni∣encies that arose from it.</P>
<P>THE many Debates and Arguments they had at various Times on this
Topic, at last produced the following Question:</P>
<Q><PB N="45" REF="55"/>Whether it is proper to allow any Gentle∣man,
who is not a regularly chosen Member of this Society, a Liberty of attending
it?</Q>
<P>THIS Question gave Rise to many Ar∣guments on both Sides, and
produced no small Commotion. The two hot-headed Members I have just
mentioned, were of Opinion, that no Man, however dignified or
distinguished, ought to have Liberty of coming there; and urged all the
Argu∣ments they were Masters of to support their Opinions; which they did
not do with the calm Demeanour of a venerable and pacific NESTOR, whose Words
fall from him like Flakes of Snow, that melted as they fell, but with all the
Fire and Fury of an enraged AJAX.</P>
<P>AS the Issue of this Debate produced a Revolution in the
Society not less remark∣able, in Proportion to the Numbers that were affected
by it, than the Revolution in the State that happened but two Years afterwards,
I shall transcribe the Speech that my Father made on the Occasion, and
which, he declares, made such an Impres∣sion on them, that they followed
his Ad∣vice, <PB N="46" REF="56"/> in the Alteration and Enlargement of their
Plan.</P>
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<P> I LOOK on this Question, Gentlemen to be of no small
Importance; as not only the Well-being, but the very Ex∣istence of our
Society must depend on the Determination we make concerning it, and the
Influence such Determina∣tion must necessarily have on our Con∣duct. It
has been allowed, ye all know, for Gentlemen, recommended by any Member of our
Society, to be present at our Debates. How long it has been allowed, I cannot
say; but it has been so ever since I have had the Honour of belonging to
it. The Ad∣vantage our Society derives from this Permission is not
inconsiderable. It re∣ceives a Lustre and Character from the Reports which
our occasional Visitants make of it to their Friends; and thus Men of real
Genius and Learning are induced to visit us, and by their hear∣ing our
Debates, and listening to our Sentiments on Subjects of Importance, or
Matters of Controversy, they are excited to give us theirs; and thus we are
mutually improved, and mutually obligated. Besides, consider that very 
<PB N="47" REF="57"/> frequently not one Half of the Members attend, and if
occasional Visitants were not then to come among us, the De∣bates would
grow languid, and no Ar∣gument could subsist. Those Gentle∣men that are
for having no Persons to partake of the Entertainment they may expect, and
seek for here, but Mem∣bers, seem to resemble an avaritious, covetous old
Miser, that hoards up his Bags, and would have no one the bet∣ter for them.
Let us not be misers in Knowledge, but despise the Character as much as
we do him that closets up his Gold. The worst Avarice is that of Wisdom;
and if we really possess any, let us act like the generous Man, and the
good Christian, that will commu∣nicate to others the good Things that he
hath, and give unto him that want∣eth: If we have not that Wisdom which we
may imagine, and without Vanity imagine, People think we have, and which they
come here to partake of, they will, perhaps, give us some. Ye all know,
Gentlemen, that in the Di∣stribution of Things of this Kind, he that gives
away the most is never the poorer for it; his Treasures are not the more
exhausted: Then let us not <PB N="48" REF="58"/> be afraid that ours will be
so, but rather hope that we shall be enriched by the Treasures of those
that often visit us, and frequently come to us very oppor∣tunely in the
Absence of some of our Members.</P>
<P> ONE Gentleman has observed, that foolish Customs
ought to be broke through; and that if we have travelled in a wrong Road for
some Time, it is proper to quit it, and travel in a right Road. I allow it,
Gentlemen; but he ought to have <HI>proved</HI> these two Things: He ought to
have shewn that our Ad∣mission of Visiters was a foolish Cus∣tom,
and that the Road we had hitherto travelled in was a wrong one; but he has not
done these Things; he has on∣ly given us his mere <HI>Ipse Dixit.</HI></P>
<P> HE has observed likewise, that for People to push
themselves into our So∣ciety, to hear our Debates, is as un∣mannerly as for a
Beggar to push, with∣out Permission, into a Gentleman's Parlour. This I
deny. Gentlemen that come here, do it by the Liberty that is given to each
Member, to bring one Friend with him; and therefore, <PB N="49" REF="59"/> that
is not a Case <HI>in Point.</HI> As to the Inconveniencies that have
arisen, and the Tumults that have been raised, they have not been owing to
our admitting Visiters, as that Gentleman has asserted, but to our not
admitting more. And really, I am of Opinion, that a Society for free and candid
Inquiry, ought to be a free rnd candid Society. But how can it be a free one,
if Gentlemen are denied Entrance? How can it be a candid one, if we obstruct
the Propaga∣tion of Knowledge?—In short, Gentle∣men, I think our Plan
might be im∣proved, and a very necessary Reforma∣tion take Place; a
Reformation that will put a Stop to all Manner of Distur∣bances, and
increase our Reputation by the Accession of more Members.</P>
<P> YOU experience very clearly, Gentle∣men, that the chief
Inconveniencies we are put to, is the Want of Room. Could we but get a larger
Place, ca∣pable of holding conveniently a lar∣ger Company, we should neither
be so crowded, nor would the Debates meet with such Obstructions.
Besides, to speak my Sentiments plainly, I don't <PB N="50" REF="60"/> think
that meeting at each other's Houses is at all proper. We put our∣selves to
many Inconveniencies we might avoid; we suffer many Per∣plexities we have no
Occasion to suffer; and we disorder our Family Affairs, when we might
avoid doing it.</P>
<P> I AM confident, Gentlemen, there is not a Man among ye,
how attached soever he is to the Interest of the Socie∣ty, but dreads the
Approach of that <HI>Monday,</HI> when, perhaps, no less than fifty People
are to assemble; and some of us perfectly tremble at it. For my Part, I
must contess, that on the <HI>Mon∣day</HI> Evening the Society meets at my
House, I am the unhappiest Creature imaginable; my Wife dislikes it, and
my Servants detest it. I doubt not but this is the Case with ye all,
Gentlemen, though your Respect for the Society, and for one another, has
prevented your making Mention of it. The Method of Meeting at each other's
Houses might be extremely proper for the So∣ciety in its Infancy; but I don't
appre∣hend it is so now. The same Reasons do not now exist as might
then; and <PB N="51" REF="61"/> therefore we are not under the same Obligation
to follow the same Method of Procedure in this Respect.</P>
<P>WHEN this Society was first institu∣ted, which was
fifty-three Years ago, there were only fifteen Members that composed it; and
no more were added to it for some considerable Time. No Member then brought
a Friend with him; so that the Society might then be, with great Propriety,
stiled a private one. But that is not the Case now. Our Number of
established Members doubles theirs, and the Number of oc∣casional
Visitants that come among us, allowing for the Absence of some Mem∣bers
every <HI>Monday</HI> Night, at least trebles it. The Inconveniency that
such a Num∣ber of People occasion to a Family I have before set forth;
and therefore shall now deliver it as my Opinion, that this is a Grievance
that wants a speedy Re∣dress, and demands our Attention much more than,
whether it is proper to al∣low Gentlemen, not Members of our Society, a Liberty
of attending it.</P>

<P>This Speech was received with universal Applause. Even the
Gentlemen that op∣posed <PB N="52" REF="62"/> my Father in the former Part of
his Speech, could not but join with him in the latter; and they all came to a
Resolution, that their meeting at one another's Houses to debate, threw
their Families into great Confusion, was improper in itself, and re∣quired
an Alteration.</P>
<P>IN Consequence of this Opinion, the Society came to a
Determination, of having their Meetings at some Tavern or Coffee∣house,
where they might be accommoda∣ted with a Room sufficient to hold a large
Number of Gentlemen, and where every one, whose Curiosity excited him to
attend the Debates, might have a Liberty of en∣tering.</P>
<P>IT may easily be imagined, that in a City like <HI>London,</HI>
it could not be a very long Time before a House possessed of such a
Room was discovered. Indeed, many such occurred to the Minds of the
Mem∣bers; but that which seemed most com∣modious, and best adapted to
their Pur∣pose, was the <HI>Essex-Head</HI> in
<HI>Essex-Street.</HI></P>
<P>TO this House, therefore, several of the Members went; and
having examined it very attentively, reported to their Bre∣thren, 
<PB N="53" REF="63"/> on their Return, that it would, with some Alterations,
answer their Pur∣pose extremely well; that they had spoken to the
Landlord concerning it; and that he had promised to do every Thing in his
Power to make it agreeable to them.</P>
<P>THE Society received this Account with general Approbation; and
informing the Landlord of the Nature of their Club, he fitted up the largest
Room in his House, fixing Benches therein, so as to make it contain upwards
of an hundred Persons.</P>
<P>THE Rules and Orders the Society had before observed, were now
altered. <HI>Be∣fore,</HI> every Member had, in his Turn, defray'd the whole
Expence attendant on the Meeting held at his House; but <HI>now,</HI> they
ordered, that every Member, and every Person that came to the Society to hear
their Debates, should, previous to his Admission into the Club-Room, take
a Ticket at the Bar, for which he should pay Six-pence: That every Six-pence
so paid would be received by the Landlord; in Consideration of which, he
should furnish them with as much <HI>Porter</HI> and <HI>Lemonade</HI> as
would amount to the Sum total recei∣ved: That the Price of both those Kinds 
<PB N="54" REF="64"/> of Liquors should be rated at Four-pence a Pot: That if
any Gentleman chose other Liquors, he should pay for them separately: And
that if any Money remained in the Landlord's Hands, after he had deducted, from
the whole Money received, the Price of the Porter and Lemonade he had
fur∣nished the Society with, it should be paid to his Servants, in
proportionable Shares, in Consideration of the Trouble they were put to.</P>
<P>THEY likewise formed some new Rules with Respect to the
Conduct of the Society, and their Methods of Debate; of which the following are
the most remarkable.</P>
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">

a Member of the Society, un∣less he is elected by a Majority of Voices; and

<P>THESE are the most material new Re∣gulations which the Society
made on their removing to the <HI>Essex-Head,</HI> their other Rules and
Orders being the same as before.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to conceive what Num∣bers of People attended
the Society as soon as it was declared a free one, and Liberty was given to
every Person to enter it, on pay∣ing Six-pence. No one Topic for
Con∣versation so universally prevailed as this. It became a general
Subject of Debate with∣out Doors, as much as Philosophy, Meta∣physics, and
the <HI>Belles Lettres</HI> did within. From the Courtier down to the
Peasant, from the hoary Sage down to the playful School-boy, Curiosity had
extended her Influence, and excited Desires in every <PB N="57" REF="67"/> one
to visit an Assembly of Men that had rendered themselves so
famous.</P>
<P>IN Consequence of such an universal and eager Curiosity,
Multitudes of People as∣sembled at the <HI>Essex-Head</HI> every
<HI>Monday</HI> Night, some as Orators, and some as Au∣ditors; some to be
instructed, some to be entertained; some to see, and some to be
seen; some to shew their fine Cloaths, and delicate Persons; and some
to criti∣cise the Speeches of the <HI>Essex-Head</HI> Ora∣tors, and
entertain their Mistresses with an Account of the Debates, and display
their own Sagacity in distinguishing their Merits, and their Defects.</P>
<P>IT is not more wonderful for Critics to congregate at such
Places, than for Rooks and Jackdaws to meet in the Fields of human Slaughter. A
Critic that has not the Power of speaking a single Sentence in Public, is
yet able to dissect the finest Ora∣tions of the finest Orators; he can
dimi∣nish the Graces of Elocution and Action, and exaggerate little Defects,
with all the petulance of Pedantry, and Rage of Cen∣sure.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="68"/> SUCH Critics are like Eunuchs: They have not
Vigour nor Courage to act man∣fully themselves, and they envy and cen∣sure
those that do. When they come into a public Assembly, it is not to
partake of its Entertainments, but to seek Occasions of finding Fault, and
giving an ill-natured Turn to the most harmless Amusements. They are like
so many Hounds at a Car∣case, devouring their Prey as fast as they can,
and growling all the Time they are eating.</P>
<P>THERE was likewise a Number of these Gentlemen of a higher
Class, the Writing Critics, who attended the Society, in Search of fresh
Topics to exercise their Abilities, and amuse the Public. They knew that
the Passion for Novelties must be gratified; and when almost every
Sub∣ject had been exhausted, and every Field been so much traversed, as
to render the Whole a common, beaten, and highway Path, it was necessary
for those Sportsmen to turn out of the common Road, where nothing but
common Objects, and Things that have been a thousand Times descri∣bed, meet
the Eye, and strike into bye Lanes and covert Places, where, perhaps, 
<PB N="59" REF="69"/> Plenty of original and curious Game might he started,
hunted down with Sport and Plea∣sure, and be at length cooked, and served
up as a choice Dish for the public Taste.</P>
<P>THIS was the Case of the <HI>Essex Head</HI> Society. While
it was confined within the Bounds of each Member's House, the Public in
general knew but little of it, and the venal Authors of those Days, not
having Intimacy and Interest enough with any of the Members to gain
Admittance, were of Course disabled from informing the World of the Nature
of the Society, and signalizing themselves, by striking into a new
Species of Writing, and entertain∣ing the Public with a new Subject. Not but of
late Years the Race of Writing-Critics is greatly improved. Formerly, those
Votaries of Dullness never attempted to write on Subjects of which they had
no Knowledge; but now, grown more vivacious, and cultivating the finer Powers
of Imagination, they can traduce Men whom they never knew, refute Arguments
they do not understand, and pronounce Sentence on Books they have not
read.</P>
<P>Nay, the Writing-Critics of the present Age, are so
sagacious, that even the raw <PB N="60" REF="70"/> and undisciplined can
form a right Judg∣ment of every new Production, by read∣ing only the first
ten Lines; and as to <HI>Veterans,</HI> the Cooks of Monthly Hashes for the
public Palate, they can discover an Author by his <HI>Style,</HI> and of
Course know, in ten Minutes, whether they are to praise or censure his
Piece: Though, indeed, to their Credit it must be observ'd, that they are
not absolute Slaves to malig∣nant Obduracy; for, after they have vowed to
damn a Work and its Author to Contempt and Obscurity, a Beef-Steak and a
Bottle of Wine have had a wonder∣ful Efficacy in softening the Severity of
their Dispositions, making them adore and cherish that very Work, which,
without the Interposition and Agency of the Wine and the Beef, they would
have butchered without Decency, and devoured without Remorse.</P>
<P>SO much for Critics of every Species.—I shall now return
to my History, and as I am too poor to give a Beef-Steak and a Bottle to
secure it from the Reviewer's Place of Torment, it must of Course be
—, but no Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="71"/> AS the Society was now declared to be free,
and Religion and Politics, those in∣exhaustible Topics of Conversation,
were allowed to be handled, the Room was crowded every Night, and Orators, like
Mushrooms in a foggy Morning, started up from every Seat. The Exclusion
of these Subjects from their Debates before, had, in the general Opinion of
the Society, robbed them of much Entertainment and Knowledge. They, therefore,
departed from the Maxims of the original Members, who had declared, that the
Christian Reli∣gion being of Divine Original, could not but be pure and holy,
and therefore not a fit Object for the Debates of Disputing Clubs; and that
for Philosophers and stu∣dious Men, who wanted only to cultivate their
rational Faculties by the Discussion of useful Subjects, to wade into
the Depths of Politics, and to take on them the Li∣berty of scrutinizing into
the Measures of State, would be an unwarrantable Action, and productive of no
Good.</P>
<P>NAY, as it is usual not only with private Men, but with public
Assemblies, to run into Extremes; so our Society now deba∣ted 
<PB N="62" REF="72"/> very few Questions, but what were religious, or
political.</P>
<P>TRUE Religion, they observed, like Silver seven Times purified
in the Fire, appear'd the brighter the more it was exa∣mined into; and it was
the indispensible Duty of every Man, to search the Scrip∣tures, and to
endeavour to give an Answer to him that asketh a Reason for the Hope that
is in him. Nay, without doing it, every Man must be extremely criminal;
since, if the only Reason a Man can give for his being of any particular
Persuasion with Respect to his Religious Principles, is, that his Father
and Mother were of the same Religion <HI>he was,</HI> and that he
professed that Religion, because he was educated in it; then, by a Parity
of Rea∣son, a <HI>Hottentot,</HI> or a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> a <HI>Jew,</HI> or
a <HI>Pagan,</HI> has as strong Reasons for his Mode of Religious
Worship, and is as justifiable in the Continuance of it, as the
Christian. As to the seeming Impropriety of debating on Religion in a
Public House, and examining into its Principles over a Pot of Beer, they
concluded, it was not only warrantable, but laudable, and infi∣nitely better
than doing it in private <PB N="63" REF="73"/> Houses, where they could not
have an Opportunity to instruct their Minds and refresh their Bodies at the
same Time: For they insisted, that in all Debates whatever, more
especially on Religion, the Conversation grows languid and insipid, in
Proportion as the Speakers grow hungry and thirsty; and therefore, a Welch
Rab∣bit and a Pot of Beer, were as necessary Requisites for a
professed Orator, as Know∣ledge and Elocution, or even a Subject to
harangue on.</P>
<P>AS to the Admission of Political Ques∣tions, they
observ'd, that in this Land of Liberty, where the Goddess herself reigns
with so much Lustre, and infuses her chearing Influence into every
Breast, it is absolutely necessary for every one who has the Good of
his Country at Heart, to scrutinize into, and examine the Measures which
are from Time to Time taken by our State Pilots, in the Management of, and
steering the Political Vessel: That it is a Duty incumbent on every Man
in a free State, in a Rank of Life, and posses∣sed of Abilities beyond
the Vulgar, to fathom the Depths of Government, and to point out and expose
the hidden Rocks <PB N="64" REF="74"/> and dangerous Shoals, on which
Statesmen often split: That as we are all Links of one great Chain, we are
all interested in the Fate of each other, and bound by the most solemn
Ties of doing our utmost, for the Support and Welfare of that Com∣munity to
which we belong: And, that though to direct the Helm of State requires an able
Head and an incorrupt Heart, Practice and Experience, Courage and Prudence;
yet, it has been found, that as a Pigmy mounted on the Shoulders of a Giant,
may be able to see farther than the Giant himself, so People not
conversant with State Affairs, may strike out some Road, that, being
pursued, may lead to Glory and Happiness, and make some Observations,
of which those that have the Direction of public Affairs, may avail
themselves.</P>
<P>FOR these, and some other Reasons <HI>equally</HI> cogent,
they determined, that Re∣ligion and Politics should find a Place in their
Debates, and employ their Attention as much as any other Subjects.</P>
<P>THE first Question they had of a reli∣gious Nature, was the
following; which the Reader will perceive was as ingenious <PB N="65" REF="75"/>
as it was modest, highly emblematical of that Freedom of Enquiry which
afterwards prevailed in that free Society.</P>
<Q>Whether Faith and Belief are not one and the same Thing? And, if
so, Whether it is in the least meritorious to believe what we cannot help
upon the Conviction of the Senses? 
<BIBL>ANTI-FIDELIS.</BIBL></Q>
<P>MANY Arguments were urged on both Sides, and Religion and Reason
were ban∣died to and fro by the various Disputants, as a Foot-ball is by a
Company of Soldiers, or a Shuttlecock by the alternate Strokes of sounding
Battledores.</P>
<P>THE Affirmatives strongly insisted that Faith was nothing
but a Conviction in the Mind, of the Truth of any particular Doctrine, or
Thing; that we could not help, from the internal Evidence we have of Things, to
believe or disbelieve them; that in Consequence of our examining them, we
form our Opinion, or in other Words, our Faith; and that since the Evidence
produced within every Man's Mind, is more or less forcible, in Propor∣tion as
it strikes the Imagination, it is no <PB N="66" REF="76"/> Wonder that the
Opinion, or Faith of Mankind, should be so greatly different, and that one
should firmly believe what another so strenuously denies. They
al∣ledged, that if a Man did all in his Power to arrive at a due Knowledge of
Things, and in Consequence of his gaining the best Information he could,
grounded his Belief, he was not culpable, let that Belief be what it would; but
any one that sits down contented with Things as he finds them, and believes
them without a free and im∣partial Examination of their Nature and Tendency, is
extremely culpable; since he only believes what he has been taught, as a
Parrot may prate what he has been in∣structed in. That to examine into the
Truth of any Doctrine before we assent to it, is our Duty; that implicit
Faith is a Monster in its Nature, and worthy only of Papal Regions, where the
Mind is fet∣tered and Credulity and Ignorance stalls at large.</P>
<P>MANY other Arguments were produced, in Support of the Opinions of
those inge∣nious Gentlemen, which it would be too tedious to enumerate; the
Result, how∣ever, of their Enquiries, and the Inferen∣ces they drew from
their Propositions, <PB N="67" REF="77"/> were, that Faith, of whatever Kind
or Nature soever, was not in the least meri∣torious, and of consequence
not necessary to Salvation; since it depended only on the Formation of
our Minds, and their Capability of distinguishing with Precision and
Accuracy, the Nature of Things, which accordingly influenced us to reject or
admit, to believe or disbelieve any Pro∣position or Doctrine which came
under the Examination of our Senses; and that an Infidel and a Christian,
are alike accepta∣ble to God, and useful Members of the Community.</P>
<P>I SHALL not give the Substance of what was said on the other
Side of the Question, for the greater Part of the Speakers were those who
disbelieved the Truth of the Christian Religion; and those who spoke in
its Defence, injured the Cause they should have supported, and betrayed
the Fort they should have defended, by their feeble and ridiculous Arguments.
To re∣fute, therefore, the Observations before made, would not be to record
the Proceed∣ings of the Society, but to give my own Opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="78"/> ONE Observation I must, however, be
permitted to make. An ignorant Chris∣tian that pretends to defend
Christianity against the Attacks of Infidels, is the greatest Enemy it
can have. The Shafts of Ridicule pointed against it by its Foes, are too
blunted, and the divine Shield of Truth, which Christianity has to defend
her, is too strong for any Impression to be made on it. It must not be
concluded therefore, that if, in public Societies, Christianity is not always
defended with a cool and intrepid Spirit, against the hot Assaults of a
whole Legion of Adversaries, that it is not defensible. Let but the
pre∣tended Friends of Christianity hold their Tongues, and it will defend
itself; but if they open the Gate to its Foes, it is no Wonder that they
should enter, and tri∣umph without a Victory.</P>
<P>TO give the Reader as satisfactory Ac∣count of the Society as I
can, and to en∣able him to form an adequate Idea of the Members that composed
it, I shall trans∣cribe a few of the Questions they debated, and give a
brief History of a few of the principal Speakers.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="79"/> SOME of the Questions that adorn the Book
of Debates, and called forth the Oratorial Abilities of the Members, are as
follow:</P>
<P> 
<LABEL>RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS.</LABEL> 
<Q>Whether the Ceremonies and Practice of Mankind, relative to
Marriage, under the Mosaic Dispensation, were super∣seded, or set
aside by the Christian Revelation? 
<BIBL>JUDAEUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Character of the Man after <HI>GOD</HI>'s own Heart,
is proper for the Imitation of People in these Days? 
<BIBL>TITUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether a Plurality of Wives, practised by the first Race of
Men, is not justi∣fiable by the present, as the Doctrine and Practice were
not abrogated by the first Christians? 
<BIBL>ANGLICANUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Doctrine of the Trinity can be justified either by
Reason or Scripture? 
<BIBL>ANTI-TRINITARIAN.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q><PB N="70" REF="80"/>Whether a positive Command to believe in
Doctrines we have no Conception of, and cannot compel our Reason to sub∣mit
to, has not a manifest Tendency to hoodwink our rational Faculties, and to
put us on a Level with Beasts, whom we command to perform our Wills without
giving them any Reasons for our so doing? 
<BIBL>PHILO-LIBERTATIS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Doctrines of Christianity are not irreconcileable
to the Reason, and repugnant to the Interests of Mankind? 
<BIBL>DRACO.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Exercise of our rational Fa∣culties, independent
of any supernatural Assistance, be not sufficient to guide us to
Salvation? And if it is not a gross Affront to the Wisdom of the <HI>Great
First Cause</HI> to suppose the contrary? 
<BIBL>BRITANNICUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether it is consistent with the Common Sense of Mankind
to believe, that the Divine <HI>LOGOS,</HI> or <HI>Word,</HI> or <HI>Su∣preme
Being,</HI> could be born of a Vir∣gin? 
<BIBL>NEGATIVUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q><PB N="71" REF="81"/>Whether any one is accountable to any Body
of Men whatever for his religi∣ous Sentiments? 
<BIBL>CHRISTIANUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Variety of Religious Systems, all pretending to
have the Divine Au∣thority of the Sacred Writings for their Foundation, does
not warrant an un∣prejudiced and a rational Person to sus∣pect the
Authenticity of those Writings? Or, if not, to decline being a Member of any
visible Church? 
<BIBL>CHUBB.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>As these Questions are sufficient to shew into what
Extravagancies Men may be led by the <HI>Freedom of Enquiry,</HI> some,
though not expunged from the Book of Debates, are yet omitted here, as too
impious and blasphemous to be repeated.</P>
<P> 
<LABEL>POLITICAL QUESTIONS.</LABEL> 
<Q>Whether the Power lodged in a Prime Minister, be not too great
to be en∣trusted with any Subject; and if, in <PB N="72" REF="82"/> Time, it
will not sap the very Vitals of our Constitution? 
<BIBL>ARISTARCHUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether, if it can be undeniably proved, that a K— has
broke his Coronation Oath, the Subjects are not discharged from their
Allegiance? 
<BIBL>DUBITOR.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether a Monarch, who loads an unde∣serving Favourite with
Treasures, and who hears and sees every thing with <HI>HIS</HI> Ears and
Eyes, merits the glorious Title of a Patriot King, notwithstand∣ing the
fulsome Adulation and servile Compliments paid him by dependent Sy∣cophants
and venal Authors? 
<BIBL>REPUBLICANUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the great Snow we had some time past<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great Snow here alluded to happened in 1674, and continued
without Intermission eleven Days. Great Damages were occasioned thereby,
Huts and little Houses were intirely covered, the Current of our Rivers was
stopped, and Multitudes of People miserably perished.</NOTE>, attended
with a smart Frost, has not had a wonderful Effect in freez∣ing 
<PB N="73" REF="83"/> and congealing the Senses of some certain Ministers?

<BIBL>SARCASTICUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether a King, who, in a Speech he makes from his Throne,
solemnly declares he will perform certain Actions which he never does
perform, asserts manifest Falsehoods that are evident to the whole
Nation, and endeavours to make his Subjects believe that black is white, and
that two and two make five, is a bet∣ter Monarch than <HI>Alfred</HI> or
<HI>Constan∣tine?</HI> 
<BIBL>ANTONINUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Smiles of a Monarch can purify the Heart of a
Gamester, or the Bed of a Countess sanctify Lewdness and Adultery,
notwithstanding both the <HI>UTOPIAN</HI> Monarch and Countess are bedawbed
over by venal Pens, and re∣presented as Pious, Good, Great, and every Thing
that is excellent? 
<BIBL>DUN SCOTUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the notorious Practice of the Mi∣nistry's interfering
with the Election of Members of Parliament, and the Arts of Bribery and
Corruption, so univer∣sally known to be made Use of on those 
<PB N="74" REF="84"/> Occasions, do not reflect Dishonour on the —
that permits or connives at those illegal Practices, which manifestly tend
to destroy the Freedom of the Sub∣ject? 
<BIBL>MARCUS AURELIUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether triennial Parliaments would not be for the good of this
Nation? 
<BIBL>AUGUSTUS.</BIBL></Q> </P>
<P>THESE are some of the Religious and Political Questions
debated by the Soci∣ety, and from their Nature and Tendency the Reader is
enabled to judge of the rest. He may observe, that the most abstruse,
and the most easy Subjects, are alike de∣bated on; those that the
greatest human Faculties cannot reach, and those that the veriest
Blockhead can understand.</P>
<P>THE Absurdity of such Questions must appear to every one.
What can be more ridiculous, than for a Society of Philoso∣phers and
Christians to endeavour to explain Mysteries, to fathom what is
unfathom∣able, and to conceive what is inconcei∣vable? Such is the Pride of
human Wit, and such our Delight in reconciling Para∣doxes, and fighting with
Shadows, that we neglect the Study of Subjects that are of <PB N="75" REF="85"/>
the last Importance, and easy to be under∣stood, and employ our Thoughts
on those that are out of the Reach of finite Capa∣cities, and which, could
they be explained and understood, would cease to be myste∣rious; for, as
an eminent Divine has just∣ly observed, a Mystery explained is a
Con∣tradiction in Terms, since, being explained, it becomes no Mystery at
all.</P>
<P>NOR less absurd and ridiculous is the de∣bating on Subjects
that can admit of no rational Debate, or the least Doubt. Why should an
Assembly of Men, whose pro∣fessed Intention is to improve one
ano∣ther, propose a Queston, <HI>Whether Vice is Vice or not?</HI> For that
is the whole Pur∣port of the sixth Political Question before set down.
That Vice is intrinsically Vice, in Subject or in King, can admit of no
Dispute: No Power, no Rank, no For∣tune can alter the Essence of Things,
however they may gild them over, and conceal their native Horror. As to the
other Questions, both Religious and Poli∣tical, I forbear commenting on them:
But I must needs observe, that I think the first are extremely indecent,
and the latter vastly bold, to be discussed in a public So∣ciety; to
say nothing of the Application <PB N="76" REF="86"/> that every one cannot
help making when attentively considering the last.</P>
<P>I COME now to perform the Promise I before made, of giving a
concise Account of a few of the principal Speakers in this illustrious
Society: But as some of them are still living, instead of their real
Names, I shall characterise them under fictitious ones.</P>
<P>POMPONIUS ATTICUS was a young Gentleman of Genius and Judg∣ment,
of a graceful Presence, and ready Elocution. But Fancy frequently got the
better of sober Reflection, and hurried him into Inconsistencies and
Paradoxes, which all his Wit and Learning could not support. He was,
according to the recei∣ved Meaning of the Word, a Deist; but, according to a
true Expression of that Cha∣racter, an Unbeliever of the Truth of the
Christian Religion, and the Divinity of its Author. He had an Estate left
him by his deceased Father, of seven hundred a Year, which he had mortgaged
to almost its full Value at different Times, and dissipated the Produce
in the Pursuit of fashionable Vices and Follies; so that, at the Age of
twenty-seven, when he first became a <PB N="77" REF="87"/> Member of the
<HI>Essex-Head Society,</HI> an Annuity for Life of sixty Pounds only
re∣mained. A loose and disorderly Life gene∣rally brings on some Rebukes
of Consci∣ence, and some alarming Reflections. To prevent their Influence,
returning Appe∣tite and strong Temptation present them∣selves, and
enlisting the Will under their Banners, Reason is seduced, and
Consci∣ence smothered. But, as under the most mountainous Oppression,
these rigid Mo∣nitors will call sorth, with a loud Voice, and bid their
Master beware of the gilded Poison that presents itself to his View,
and dash the unblessed Cup from his desiring Lips; so, POMPONIUS
feeling the dread∣ful Consequences of Vice, and attending to the Monitors
within, resolved to reform his Life, and to forsake the Companions of his
Wickedness. But this Resolution was but transitory: The first fine
Woman he saw disarmed him, and he fell from his Heroism. A Continuance in
Wickedness debilitates the Faculties, and urges us to defend what we
practise. Instead, there∣fore, of leaving off the Practice of Vice,
POMPONIUS began to extenuate it—to justify it—and to admire it.
He now commenced a philosophic Rake, defended his Actions by Figures of
Speech, and ha∣rangued <PB N="78" REF="88"/> on the Expediency and Utility of
Fornication, with the choicest Metaphors. He was now surprised at his
former Pusil∣lanimity and Doubt; and was clearly of Opinion, that the
Practice of Whoredom was justifiable by Reason, that great Lord Chief
Justice in the Court of Man, and tended greatly to the Support of the
Com∣mon-Wealth. The Transition of this State of Mind, into a perfect
Composure and Serenity in the Practice of Vice, is very quick. Before we have
deviated from the Path of Duty, indeed, Consci∣ence, that ill-natured
Snarler, that Enemy to our Happiness, suggests a thousand Rea∣sons
for our Continuance in the same Road, and pretends to assert, that the
pleasant Views, and delightful Prospects we see on each Side of us, are
unreal, and a mere Moc∣kery of the Senses; and warns us, with an an earnest
and a loud Voice, not to for∣sake the Road we are in, to grasp at Sha∣dows,
or to catch Butterflies. Nobly disdaining to be controuled by so rigid a
Monitor, we quit the Path in which we safely trod, and turn towards the
Bowers of Bliss, and Beds of Roses, where Sy∣rens solicit our Approach,
and urge us to recreate our jaded Senses, and refresh our tired Limbs. We
comply with the kind <PB N="79" REF="89"/> Invitation: We are lulled to rest
by the soft Melody of ensnaring Voices: We en∣ter the Bowers of Bliss; we
throw our∣selves on the Beds of Roses, fully persua∣ded we shall there
be happy—But, ah! what Horror invades us, when we find Harpies and Furies
are the Inhabitants of those Bowers, and that Adders, and Vi∣pers, and
Scorpions, lurk beneath the Rose Beds!</P>
<P>So was it with POMPONIUS. But of the latter Pa t of this
Description he ex∣perienced not the Truth, 'till Conviction came to him on a
Death-Bed—Fre∣quenting the <HI>Essex-Head Society,</HI> he was
considered by all as a fine Speaker, and close Reasoner. No Christian
dared enter the Lists with our Unbeliever; but if, rash and impetuous, by
Chance any one at∣tempted it, he was sure of being foiled.</P>
<P>IN this Manner he went on 'till he ar∣rived at the Age of Forty,
happy in his Vices, and perfectly convinced of their Innocence. His deistical
Notions were confirmed by the Authority of many Writers of the first Note,
and many Speakers of the same Sentiments, that attended the Society; and they
encouraged <PB N="80" REF="90"/> each other in them, and from Time to Time
entertained the World with their Productions, in Order, as themselves
ob∣served, that the Cause of Truth should be propagated, and Bigotry and
Superstition be banished from the World.</P>
<P>A MELANCHOLY Sequel remains to complete the Story. Shall I relate,
or leave the Imagination to guess at the Power of Sickness, and the
Prospect of Death?—No; there is no Occasion. Suffice it to say,
that the witty, the face∣tious, the learned POMPONIUS, retracted the Opinions
he had espoused, and declared that he <HI>felt</HI> Christianity was no
empty Name, no Juggle or Trick put upon Mankind by artful Priests, to fetter
Rea∣son, and impose on the Senses, but a sub∣stantial Good, which its
Professors may possess, but of which he could entertain no Idea, but
from the Despair and Horror he felt from the Want of it.—These Things
he now declared; but <HI>where</HI> de∣clared them? Alas! on a Bed from whence
he never more arose into this World: His immortal Spirit freed from its
Imprison∣ment in the Body, entered the Regions of Eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="91"/> A VERY different Kind of Being was that
whose History I shall now give. GRIPUS was born of very mean and poor
Parents at <HI>Shiffnall</HI> in <HI>Shropshire,</HI> who, with great
Difficulty, brought him up to a Knowledge of Reading and Writing. At the Age of
thirteen, he was put Ap∣prentice to a Peruke-maker, and on his Arrival to his
twenty-second Year, with eleven Shillings and nine Pence only, he set out
for <HI>London.</HI> On his coming to this great City, and examining into the
State of his Finances, he found he had one Shilling and three Pence Halspenny
left. With that Sum he determined to try his Fortune, and looked out for a
Place in the Capacity of a Journeyman Barber. His Endeavours were crown'd with
Success: He found a Place, and he was happy. Nine Months he continued here,
and saved up the Sum of seven Pounds nine Shillings. It was a Fortune to
him, and he resolv'd to improve it; but not in the Business he was bred
to, for he found it would not answer his Purpose. With seven Pounds and
nine Shillings only, GRIPUS enter'd <HI>the Alley,</HI> and took on him a
Business he knew nothing of; but he had heard that small Sums had
pro∣duced <PB N="82" REF="92"/> immense Fortunes in it. He was ignorant and
illiterate to the last Degree; had no Accomplishments that could re∣commend
him to the Notice of the World, or rescue him, according to all Probability,
from that low and mean State he had been bred in, and was then subject
to.</P>
<P>AS Fortune is hoodwink'd, and re∣gardless of the Merits of her
Suitors, it frequently happens, that the Unworthy are admitted into her Temple,
and re∣ceiv'd as her peculiar Favourites, while the Learned and Ingenious
languish in Ob∣scurity, or drag a heavy, galling Chain, condemn'd to Penury
and Want. GRIPUS experienced the Truth of this Observation. With not a
single Qualification that could intitle him to the Regard of any one, or
rescue him from the servile and ignomi∣nious State he had been used to,
he met with great Success, and abounded in Af∣fluence; Wealth flow'd in
fast upon him, while Men of infinitely greater Merit were sinking beneath a
Load of Misfor∣tunes, and patiently enduring the Frowns of Fortune. The
<HI>Alley</HI> prov'd a real Friend to him, and his Substance conti∣nually
increased. As he grew more weal∣thy, he was more parsimonious; and he 
<PB N="83" REF="93"/> seldom or never spent more than three Half-pence for
his Breakfast, three Pence Half-penny for his Dinner, and three Half-pence
for a Nipperkin of home∣brewed, either at the Crooked Billet in <HI>Shire
Lane,</HI> or the Welch Harp in <HI>Full∣wood's Rents.</HI></P>
<P>IN about twenty Years he had amassed together the Sum of
Twenty Thousand Pounds, with the greatest Part of which he purchased an
Estate in <HI>Shropshire,</HI> and laid out the Remainder in the Stocks.
His Substance, like a Snow-ball, was conti∣nually increasing, and with it
the Desire of more. Like the Grave, his Lust for Money was boundless, and
he endea∣vour'd to obtain it by all the Means in his Power.</P>
<P>ON his Arrival to his forty-seventh Year, Curiosity brought
him to the <HI>Essex Head,</HI> and Avarice kept him there. Six-pence a
Night was, indeed, more than he had made it a Rule to spend; but for that
Six-pence he might drink a Gallon or two of good Porter, and on the Days he
went there, he took Care to drink none any where else; so that he justly 
<PB N="84" REF="94"/> consider'd, that if he drank but three full Pots, he was
Three-pence Gainer.</P>
<P>IT can scarcely be expected that such a <HI>Genius</HI> as I
am describing, could be an Orator; but he was as good a Drinker as any of
them, and though he could neither speak to a Question, or comprehend the
Force of any Argument, yet while the Debates were held, he could amuse
him∣self with his Tankard, and smoke his Pipe; and after they were
finished, could for two or three Hours longer, smoke his Pipe, and amuse
himself with his Tan∣kard—and all for Six-pence.</P>
<P>IN this Manner old GRIPUS went on 'till the last Day of his
Life, the Jest of Fools, the Contempt of Coxcombs, the Pity of Men of
Sense, and the Detestation of his Relations; though, indeed, these latter
being needy, paid him some Court, and shewed him some Respect, which
his Wealth, not his Merit, extorted; mere 
<Q REND="inline">"Mouth-Honour, which the poor Heart would fain
have denied."</Q></P>
<P>GRIPUS had many Relations, who stood in Need of his Bounty; but,
insen∣sible <PB N="85" REF="95"/> to every Thing but the Lust of Mo∣ney,
dead to all the social Feelings of the Soul, he cared not a Straw if his
Kindred and all Mankind were at the Bottom of the Sea, so that he could
stand safely on Land, survey the Scene, and, like a <HI>Sussex</HI>
or <HI>Cornish</HI> Savage, pillage the Wreck.</P>
<P>A LENGTH of Years, however, weigh'd him down at las;t, and he fell
ill. Death was written in his Face, and he was pro∣nounced incurable. The
Landlord, in whose House he had for many Years lodged by Way of
Cheapness, had Two Hundred Pounds in his Hands belonging to GRIPUS; and this
Sum, he determin'd, by some Artifice, to appropriate to his own Use. How
this was to be obtain'd, was the grand Question, and well worthy the
Contriver's Genius. WILL was no less a Miser than GRIPUS, and had, by
keeping a mean, beggarly Coffee-House, in a dirty Lane, saved up Three or
Four Thousand Pounds; but he consider'd, that Two Hundred would be a good
Ad∣dition to it. The Scheme being at length duly adjusted, WILL made his
Appear∣ance before GRIPUS, attended by two Witnesses, who were to stand
concealed, hear the Discourse, and, if necessary, give 
<PB N="86" REF="96"/> in Evidence of it. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have Two Hun∣dred Pounds of yours in my Hands,
Mr. GRIPUS, said WILL, and I want to know what I must do with it."</Q>
GRIPUS, rack'd with Pain, and scarce sensible of any Thing, replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"Keep it yourself."</Q> A Wink of the Eye, and a
Projection of the Hand, now were necessary, to bring the two Witnesses
forward. They came. 
<Q REND="inline">"What must I do with the Two Hundred Pounds, Mr.
GRIPUS? As you are now, in all Pro∣bability, on a Death-bed, it is best to
settle these Affairs."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"You may keep it yourself, answer'd the sick
Man."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Then you give and bestow the Two Hundred Pounds
on me, don't you?"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"I do, reply'd he."</Q> This was sufficient.
WILL hasten'd down Stairs, had an Affidavit drawn of the Legacy given him,
and in a short Time after GRIPUS expired; That GRIPUS who lived despised
and hated, and died unlamented.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Member of the Society, was Father MURTAGH O'FLAHERTY, a
Popish Priest. <HI>Ireland</HI> gave him Birth, St. <HI>Omer</HI>'s
Education, and <HI>England</HI> a good Income. He had for a long Time, 
<PB N="87" REF="97"/> after his Return from St. <HI>Omer</HI>'s, resided in
the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and was look'd on as a very learned and able
Divine. The Aged revered him for his Judgment; and the Youthful for his gay and
lively Dispo∣sition, freed from the Austerity and Ri∣gour that frequently
make Wisdom odious. MURTAGH would demonstrate with the greatest
Clearness, that Mirth and Chear∣fulness were not in the least
inconsistent with Religion; that a Bottle of good Claret fortified the
Body, and raised the Spirits; and that the Joys which a good Tavern and boon
Companions afford, were not to be despised by Men of Sense.</P>
<P>IN Consequence of this natural Propen∣sity, this longing
Desire to be happy, and to make others so, Father MURTAGH would frequent
Clubs, and sing Catches, speak Speeches, drink Toasts, break
Glas∣ses, and tell merry Stories, with any one: And though some rigid
Priests, and severe Moralists, would censure him behind his Back for
his immoral Conduct, as they term'd it, yet, when he appear'd before them, he
had such a pretty Way, such a forcible Method of vindicating his
Beha∣viour, and winning their Affections, that <PB N="88" REF="98"/> they could
not find in their Hearts to blame him.</P>
<P>BUT, with such Accomplishments, if he was a Favourite of the
Men, what must he be with the Women? They per∣fectly idolized him, and, in
Return, Fa∣ther MURTAGH had no less Passion and Veneration for them.
Indeed, there was another Circumstance, which, though it may be deem'd a
Trifle by some Folks, had a wonderful Effect in forcing the Af∣fections of
the Fair. As he acted in the Character of a Confessor, to rivet the
Esteem of his Penitents, he used Lenity instead of Severity, and in
Cases where some Confessors would have scourged with a Rod of Iron,
he rebuked with the Mildness of a Father, and exhorted them to a contrary
Conduct, if they would avoid his just Indignation. These lenient and gentle
Methods prevail'd where rough and violent ones would not. The human Mind is
rather won by Entreaty, than dragged by Force, and receives Conviction from a
Friend that soothes its Anguish, and makes Allowance for its Frailties;
when, by a contrary Conduct, venial Er∣ror might rise to Guilt, and youthful
In∣dulgence <PB N="89" REF="99"/> terminate in confirmed Wicked∣ness and
obstinate Villainy.</P>
<P>FATHER MURTAGH being such a pro∣fessed Admirer of the Fair,
and treating them with such Mildness, he had so won their Hearts, that
they resounded his Praises continually. They insisted on it, he was the
best Priest in the Kingdom, the most learned and judicious Man, and
infinitely the best qualified to be a Confes∣sor. In short, they would
confess to no one but Father MURTAGH. Father MURTAGH was the universal
Cry.</P>
<P>THIS Trade continued so long, that a Conspiracy was formed by
his envious Bre∣thren against his Monopoly, and by Force of Bribes and
Numbers, he fell a Victim to popular Wrath, and priestly Artifice.</P>
<P>FOR a long Time the good Man, poor and friendless, wandered
about, a melan∣choly Proof of the unhappy Fate that may attend Men of the
greatest Parts, and of the Want of Gratitude for past Favours, when the
Power of continuing them is taken away.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="100"/> FINDING he could scarcely support
him∣self in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he came to <HI>London,</HI> and soon formed
an Acquaintance with many People of his own Religion. An <HI>Irish</HI> Roman
Catholick Priest need never fear wanting a Beef-Steak and a Pot of Porter for
his Dinner in <HI>London:</HI> Nay, he need not fear wanting Venison or
Ortolans, and good Claret. There are Abundance of Papists in this City, who
regard their Priests as so many Demi-Gods, and who will think themselves
as highly honoured with their Presence at Dinner or Supper, as BAUCIS and
PHILEMON thought them∣selves by the Presence of their heavenly Guest; and
in consequence of this Opi∣nion, the Markets are ransacked for the
choicest Viands, and the Wine Vaults for the best Wines, to entertain them.
As stolen Interviews between Lovers are the sweetest, so the
Necessity the Roman Ca∣tholic Clergy are under to keep themselves
concealed, in order to gain Proselytes, and pervert the People to their
Religion, give a Relish to their Entertainments which they would otherwise
want.</P>
<P>FATHER MURTAGH soon saved up a good deal of Money, and lived
as elegantly <PB N="91" REF="101"/> as his Heart could wish. He attended
eve∣ry <HI>Monday</HI> night at the <HI>Essex-Head,</HI> spoke to the
Questions in the Character of a Pro∣testant, yet could not help betraying
the cloven Foot on some Occasions. After the Debates of the Evening were
over, and the Company entered into private Conferences with each other, Father
<HI>Murtagh</HI> would single out that Person whom he conceived most fit
for his Purpose, and use the greatest Industry and exert all his
Abilities, to de∣preciate the established Religion of this Kingdom, and
extol that of the Roman Catholic, and his Endeavours were often
successful.</P>
<P>HE is now very old, and having for many Years attended at the
<HI>Essex-Head Society,</HI> he comes to the <HI>Robinhood;</HI> but not
con∣stantly, on Account of his Age and Infir∣mities.</P>
<P>BOB SCAMPER was a Man very different from the three I have been
de∣scribing: BOB was born in the West of <HI>England,</HI> and was reckoned
a Youth of enterprising Genius, and ready Parts. At the Age of eighteen he
came to <HI>London,</HI> and having spent the five Guineas he brought up with
him on Women of the Town, <PB N="92" REF="102"/> was greatly at a Loss to what
to betake himself. Poverty stared him in the Face, and tho' he had some
good natural Parts, and a great Assurance, yet having no Learn∣ing, he
could get no genteel Employment. His Female associates, however, soon
fur∣nished Hints, which a Lad of his ready Wit and enterprising Spirit,
easily understood, and as intrepidly executed. He turned Collector on the
Road, and having Suc∣cess, rioted in the Spoils he had taken, and with his
Girls enjoyed all the Happiness he desired: Not but that sometimes it was
dashed with some Remorse, and the Dread of the fatal Consequences that
might ensue. But Excess of drinking, the Company of Libertines, and the
Conversation of his Women, dispersed the Clouds that obscured his
Happiness, and confirmed him in the Resolution he had taken to plunder and
rob the Public, and to gain a Livelihood by the bold Hands of Violence.</P>
<P>A CONTINUANCE in Wickedness fa∣miliarises the Mind to it, and
what at first a Man would start even to think of, he at length practises
without Horror. All Guilt is progressive: We go not at once, but Step by
Step, into the Extremes of Vice; and tho' it is impossible to silence the
Cries <PB N="93" REF="103"/> of Conscience, and to stifle the Dictates of
Reason all at once, yet an habitual Viola∣tion of their Admonitions, brings
us to an Insensibility of the Horror of our Crimes, and renders us quite
callous to the Sense of Shame, and deaf to every Thing but the importunate
Cravings of sensual Appetite.</P>
<P>BOB SCAMPER experienced the Truth of these Observations. In
the Day-Time he mounted his Horse, and robbed on the Highway with the same
Composure, as any other Man follows <HI>his</HI> customary Occupation, and
at Night he spent the ill∣got Treasure among Whores and Thieves, the
Encouragers of his Wickedness, and the Sharers of his Spoils.</P>
<P>THIS was a worthy Member of a So∣ciety that met to improve
themselves by free and candid Inquiry; but Captain SCAMPER, as he was
intitled, was well received by all. He was a tall handsome Fellow, endued
with a Power of Face that disdained a Blush, and though not wise was
witty, though not learned was ingeni∣ous, and had a Power of imposing on the
Understandings of those he conversed with, and making them believe him to
be what he was not. He dressed well, had a free <PB N="94" REF="104"/> and
<HI>degagée</HI> Air, wanted not Words, and addressed the
Passions of those he conversed with, with such Skill and Success,
that you could not help giving him Credit for much more Understanding than he
pos∣sessed.</P>
<P>THERE are two Kinds of People that are better thought of in most
Companies, than their intrinsic Merit deserves: These are the solemn
Prig, and well-dressed Cox∣comb. The first, by the Help of a full∣trimmed
grave Suit, and a large Peruque, a sagacious Look, and a slow Deli∣very,
shall make you take him for a second SOLON. The most unmeaning Speech,
the tritest Observation, the most superficial Hint, delivered in a dry,
yet important, slow but solemn Tone, and enforced by some shakes of the
Head, shrugs of the Shoulders, and significant Hand-Oratory, shall be
received as the Dictates of Wisdom, and procure the Speaker the Character of
the SOLOMON of the Age.</P>
<P>THE other, aided by his Taylor, Mil∣lener, and Barber, tho' he
gives Vent to the Fulness of his Soul only by dry Jokes, and insipid
Remarks, is yet listened to with <PB N="95" REF="105"/> Attention, and heard
with Pleasure. No one will dare to contradict the Assertions of a Wit,
with laced Cloaths, Bag-Wig, and a Sword; and thus Folly is received for
Wisdom, and vivacious Impudence for Ge∣nius.</P>
<P>SCAMPER was to be ranked in this second Class of Orators. He
spoke to eve∣ry Question, and tho' what he said had no great Depth or
much Meaning in it, yet being delivered from the Mouth of a Man that was
extremely well dressed, and with no bad Accent or ill Grace, it was always
well received, and the Speaker was con∣sidered as a very great
<HI>Genius,</HI> and an Or∣nament to the Society.</P>
<P>BUT this Ornament of the Society did not last above five Years
and a Half. He had committed a Robbery on <HI>Hounslow-Heath,</HI> and taken
a Booty of no less than three Hundred Guineas. The Gentle∣man he had robbed,
happened accidentally to come to the <HI>Essex-Head</HI> one
<HI>Monday</HI> Evening, and the Moment he entered the Room, Captain SCAMPER
had got up to speak to the Question. The Question was</P>
<Q><PB N="96" REF="106"/> Whether the Doctrine of Repentance taught by
the Christian Religion, has not a manifest Tendency to encourage
Wickedness? 
<BIBL>DEISTICUS.</BIBL></Q>
<P>SCAMPER, after desiring the Presi∣dent to read the Question
again, spoke to it in the best Manner he could. He vindi∣cated
Christianity in general, and demon∣strated that all its Doctrines tended to
the Support of Morality, by discountenancing all Manner of Vice. He shewed
its su∣perior Excellency over all the Religions that had ever appeared in the
World; he proved the Authenticity of the Sacred Writings, and defied the
Deists, with all their Ingenuity, to point out any Defects in them. He
observed of our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount, that as it compre∣hended in
one concise View, all the Doc∣trines and Precepts of Christiany, so it
was the most sublime System of Ethics in the World. He took Notice, that
not only the Philosophers and Sages of the Heathen World, considered
abstractedly, were un∣able to form a complete System of moral Duties, but
that all their Writings put to∣gether were insufficient to form such a
System, and that if all their Morality was <PB N="97" REF="107"/> to be
extracted, that is, all their Excellen∣cies to be reduced into a System, it
would still be an imperfect one. He then spoke more immediately to the
Question, and deli∣vered it as his Opinion, that the Doctrine of Repentance,
as taught by the established Church, of which, he said, he was not
a∣shamed to own himself a Member, so far from encouraging Wickedness,
had the greatest Tendency imaginable to annihilate it; for he observed,
that the Repentance taught in the Gospel, is not merely a Sor∣row for our
past Sins, but likewise a Reso∣lution of reforming our Conduct for the
fu∣ture. As to the Objection that had been brought by a Deist, who
observed, that Repentance was no Atonement, he said, it was very true, if
we speak as Deists, but if we believe as Christians, it must be looked
on as an Atonement, since GOD, in those Books which Christians believe
were writ∣ten by his Inspiration, has been graciously pleased to declare,
he will receive it as such. Our Duty he observed, without Doubt, it was
always incumbent on us to practise; and after the Commission of the
greatest Sins, and our sincere Repentance of them, we perform no more than
our Duty, by living a Righteous and a Holy Life: But as the Deity had declared
to <PB N="98" REF="108"/> every one, even the greatest of Sinners, that though
his Crimes were as red as Scarlet, yet by Repentance the should be made as
white as Snow; it is certainly a Doctrine that encourages the Soul, and
supports it under the Reproaches of Conscience, that would otherwise whip
us with her Scor∣pions, and throw us into the Agonies of Despair and Horror.
He concluded, by drawing a Contrast between the Repen∣tance of the
Protestant, and the Absolution of the Roman Catholic Church; and
in∣sisted, that the former tended to our spi∣ritual and temporal Welfare,
and the latter to the Destruction of both.</P>
<P>DURING all the Time this great Advo∣cate for Religion and Morality
was speak∣ing, the Gentleman eyed him attentively, and thought he had seen
him somewhere before. He went up close to him, and after a minute
examination of his Person and Manner, at length recollected that it was on
<HI>Hounslow-Heath</HI> he had the Mis∣fortune to have seen him. Without
saying any Thing to him, or to the Company, he withdrew, and in about a
Quarter of an Hour returned with his Servant, who was present at the Robbery,
and with a Con∣stable, who was to take Care of SCAM∣PER, <PB N="99" REF="109"/> if the Servant agreed with his Master in the Identity of the
Person.</P>
<P>THE Servant had no sooner entered the Room, than, without his
Master's pointing the Object out, he swore that the tall Gen∣tleman in
laced Cloaths, near the Presi∣dent, was the Man that robbed his Master on
<HI>Hounslow-Heath.</HI> This was sufficient. The Constable went up to
him, and tap∣ping him on the Shoulder, said, he should be glad to speak
to him. The Captain obeyed, and they withdrew out of the Disputing-Room,
attended by the Gentle∣man and his Servant. They had no sooner reached the
Stairs, than SCAMPER wanted to know the Gentleman's Commands. 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh, says the Constable, there is a Coach
waiting at the Door, and if you'll enter it, you'll know presently."</Q>
SCAMPER declin'd it, but the Constable was importunate, and being somewhat
irritated at his Obstinacy, told him he <HI>must</HI> enter it. The Captain
stared, bit his Lips, and was mute. The Gentleman and his Servant now came
up, and the latter opening the Coach-Door, waited for his Master to enter.
But he was too complaisant to go in before the Captain, and bowing to him,
asked him to go in <PB N="100" REF="110"/> first. The Captain still
declin'd it, and they insisted on it in a higher Tone, and declar'd that he
should go whether he would or not. Already was half the Captain's Sword out
of the Scabbard, and he had resolv'd to resist their utmost Efforts,
when a Whistle from the Constable made him stare, and of a Sudden
suspend his Action. Immediately three strapping Fel∣lows came up, and the
Constable pointing to SCAMPER, and telling them to do their Duty, they took
away his Sword, hurried him into the Coach, the Gentleman, his Servant, and the
Constable following, and drove off to Justice DE VEIL'S.</P>
<P>I SHALL not multiply Words. The Gentleman and his Servant swore
positively that he was the Person that robb'd them on <HI>Hounslow
Heath.</HI> He was search'd. A Powder Horn, a Pair of Pistols, a Mask,
and some other Things were found on him. His Mittimus was made, and he was
sent to <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>IN a Fortnight, Abundance of People swore to their being robb'd
by him; and by means of some of his Girls, three of his Confederates were
taken, and sent to bear him Company. In due Time, their Trials 
<PB N="101" REF="111"/> came on at the <HI>Old Baily,</HI> and they were found
guilty, and sentenced to be hang'd.</P>
<P>SCAMPER had very little Hopes of gaining a Reprieve, yet did not
prepare for Death in the Manner he ought. His favourite Doctrine, Repentance,
he hardly thought of, at least he did not practise it. He drank to such
Excess, that when the Hour came that he was to suffer an igno∣minious Death
in the Sight of a nume∣rous and gaping Populace, he seem'd quite
insensible of his Fate.</P>
<P>HE was put into the Cart with his Companions, and they were driven
to <HI>Tyburn.</HI> The fatal Rope was fasten'd round their Necks—the
Ordinary told them they were going to another World—the Cart was driven
away—and they were left suspended in the Air.</P>
<P>THUS perish'd BOB SCAMPER, a Man of no mean Abilities, but who
prostituted them to infamous Purposes, and lived an immoral, vicious Life,
though ever ha∣ranguing in the Society, on the Beauty of Holiness, and the
Necessity of Repentance.—I wish this were not a common Case in
the World.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="112"/> ANOTHER Member of the Society, not less
worthy than this, was TOM RAKE∣WELL. TOM, after having receiv'd an Education,
that barely enabled him to read and write, was sent from the West of
<HI>England</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> and there bound Ap∣prentice to a Grocer.
But TOM'S Genius was not to be confin'd within so narrow a Channel. He
soared to higher Things, and was ambitious enough to attempt get∣ting on the
Stage, where all his Desires were placed, and all his Hopes terminated. He
offer'd himself to FLEETWOOD, the Manager, and was refused. Not daunted,
however, at this Repulse, he ran away from his Master in the third Year of
his Apprenticeship, went to <HI>Norwich,</HI> where a Company of Strollers
were then per∣forming, made a Tender of his Services, and was accepted. The
pitiful Income of a strolling Player was too scanty for our Hero, and the
Debts he had contracted were so numerous, and his Creditors so
pressing, that <HI>Norwich</HI> became quickly too hot to hold him. He,
therefore, set out from that Place for <HI>Newcastle upon Tyne,</HI> where
there was another Company of Players: But, to enable himself to travel with
greater Conveniency, he took with <PB N="103" REF="113"/> him as large a Bundle
of the Manager's Cloaths as he could carry, and set out early in the Morning
in a Post-Chaise.</P>
<P>HE quickly converted his Effects into ready Money, and reach'd
<HI>Newcastle</HI> in two Days. But he was soon forced to decamp. The News
of his being there, having reached his <HI>quondam</HI> Companions at
<HI>Norwich,</HI> a Hue and Cry was raised, and two of the Actors were sent
to <HI>Newcastle</HI> to apprehend him. RAKEWELL, by some Means, had
Intelligence of their Arrival, and guessed their Errand; but declin'd the
Honour of their Company, by leaving the Town so precipitately, that he had
not even Time to pay the Landlord of the Inn he had set up at, a Score of
thirty-seven shillings.</P>
<P>FROM hence he went to <HI>Exeter,</HI> at which Town he was born;
and going to his Father, told him a long Story of his Master's ill Usage,
and of the Impossibility of his living with him. His Father pro∣duced a
Letter from his Master, informing him of his Son's running away without any
Cause, but of his Readiness to pardon him if he would return. The Father
and Son had now a great Contest, and the Master's <PB N="104" REF="114"/>
Letter had greater Weight with the old Man, than the Son's Assertions. He,
however, promised RAKEWELL, that he would write to his Master in his
Favour, and that 'till he could receive an Answer, he might stay with him.
The Son ac∣quiesced with the Proposal, seem'd pleased with it, and the
old Man immediately wrote, extenuating his Son's Guilt, and apologizing for the
Misconduct which the Weakness incident to Youth had drawn him into.</P>
<P>THREE Days after, TOM got up at One in the Morning, and opening a
Bu∣reau, found a Purse with no less than fifty-seven Guineas in it, being
the poor old Man's whole Fortune, and which he had been hoarding up ever
since his Son was first sent to <HI>London,</HI> out of the small
Profits that accrued to him from a little Trade he had as a Peruke-maker. This
was a Fortune to the over-joyed Youth, and putting it safe in his Pocket, he
took his Stick, and walk'd 'till Seven in the Morning very briskly, when he
had reach'd ****. Here he breakfasted, and the Stage-Coach coming by, he
agreed with the Driver for his Passage to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="115"/> HE had no sooner arriv'd at the
Metro∣polis, than the Scenes he had before been engag'd in, were renew'd, and
the same Pranks play'd over again. While he was in his Apprenticeship, an
indulgent Master had permitted him, after the Business of the Night was
over, and Shop was shut, to spend his Evenings abroad. A Youth of such a
Disposition as TOM had, it may naturally be imagin'd, did not spend them
in very good Company, nor very inno∣cently. The Houses he frequented were
either Brothels, or Night-Houses, and the Company consisted of wild, and
thoughtless young Apprentices like him∣self, or thorough-paced Rogues, who
ini∣tiated the young ones into all the iniquitous Schemes and Arts they were
Masters of. Tutors of Villainy like these, for whom <HI>Tyburn</HI> groans,
abound in Houses of this Sort, and young Scholars attend there in great
Numbers.</P>
<P>TOM keeping very bad Hours, was fre∣quently lock'd out; but after
he had the Experience of three Weeks Learning from a Veteran, he knew how to
seduce his Master's Maid, and to prevail on her to let him in at any Hour.
This Kindness went not unrewarded: To discharge his <PB N="106" REF="116"/>
Obligations to her, TOM robb'd his Master of Tea, Sugar, Spices and
Snuff.</P>
<P>THIS was a pretty Life, which he now not only renew'd, but
improv'd. He be∣came a complete Buck and Blood, sallied out every Night in
Quest of Adventures, beat the Watch, bullied Constables, de∣molished
Lamps, kicked Waiters, bilked Bawdy-Houses, and went Home reeling to Bed.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Time he return'd to <HI>London</HI> from
<HI>Exeter,</HI> he attended the <HI>Essex-Head Society.</HI> Their Debates
charmed him, and he thought if he could be admitted a Member of so
respectable and learned a Body, he should be quite happy. If Hap∣piness
consisted in being a Member, he was soon in Possession of it, for
he was chosen <HI>Nem. Con.</HI></P>
<P>RAKEWELL had a great Talent for Disputation. He had a ready Wit,
great Volubility of Speech, and wanted not for a consummate Assurance.
These Accomplishments must have endeared him greatly to the Society, and
he was look'd on as a valuable Acquisition. It is true, there was no Solidity
of Judgment, no Depth of Knowledge in him, any more <PB N="107" REF="117"/> than
in his Friend SCAMPER; but he had no less Art in exciting the Admiration of
the Superficial, and the Ignorant, (a vast Body of Men!) and in making his
Tinsel Ornaments pass for real Plate.</P>
<P>RAKEWELL's chief Fort was Re∣ligion. He distinguish'd
himself greatly on Subjects of this Kind, and was thought to be as good an
Orthodox Member as any in the Society. He combated the Deists with the
invincible Armour of Revealed Religion, and played off the great Guns of
Mysteries against them with no little Success. As the Doctrine of
<HI>occult Causes</HI> is the greatest Friend of Metaphysicians and
natural Philosophers, and serves as a Retreat for them where no Foes can
enter; so, when pressed by Argument, or urged by Authority, the Deists
would demand Reasons for Assertions, and Proofs for <HI>Ipse
Dixits,</HI> RAKEWELL would prudently retire from the Charge, and tell them
that where Faith begins, Reason ends—that the Natural Man cannot
comprehend Spi∣ritual Subjects—that what is an Object of Faith, cannot be
intelligible by Reason—and that though Revealed Religion may seem
above Reason, yet it is not against it. These, and many other Answers
of the like Kind, he gave to the Heterodox <PB N="108" REF="118"/> Gentry, and
ever shew'd an inviolable Resolution to defend Religion in general, and the
Establish'd Church in particular, against all the Attacks of their Foes:
In Consequence of which, the Society look'd on him as an honourable Member,
and a very learned and ingenious Man. After Debates on such Subjects, and
Holy Ar∣guments alledged in Favour of his Opi∣nions, our Orator would leave the
Society, and proceed to his usual Night Entertain∣ments, of breaking the
Lamps, and going Home to his Girls, where he rioted in Excess of
Wickedness.</P>
<P>BY some Means or other, RAKEWELL had got acquainted with an old
Maiden Lady, worth no less than Thirteen Hun∣dred Pounds. After paying his
Addresses to her for some Time, he gain'd her Heart, and a Day was
proposed for Marriage. The antiquated Virgin, not doubting the Ho∣nour of her
Lover, the Day before the intended Marriage, transferr'd over her whole Fortune
to him. The Lover was now happy. He sold out the Thirteen Hundred Pounds Old
South Sea An∣nuities, and Three per Cent. Bank An∣nuities, immediately. With
the Money these produced, he set up a Chariot and Pair, took genteel
Lodgings in <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> <PB N="109" REF="119"/> and appear'd in every
Respect as a Man of Fortune, quite regardless of the Attempts that might be
made on him by the Sons of Law, and hoping to find out some other wealthy
Dame, with whom he might meet with equal Success.</P>
<P>BUT though RAKEWELL was safe with Respect to the Revenge
threaten'd him by the Lady he had tricked, and her Friends, yet his high Living
and Extravagance soon dissipated his Substance, and he was at a Loss
what to do. Paying ready Money for some Time, however, induced Trades∣men
to give him Credit; and having run in Tick to the Amount of Three Hundred
Pounds, with various People; and being dunned, and threatened several Times
by the most Importunate of them, he was in∣duced to shift his Quarters, to
go away from his Lodgings without settling with his Landlord or his Footman
(for he kept one to the last) and set out again for <HI>Exeter.</HI></P>
<P>ON his Arrival there he told his Father a miserable Story, of
his having been rob∣bed of Five Hundred Guineas, of his ha∣ving a Combat with
the Highwaymen that had robbed him, and of his having em∣ploy'd several
active Fellows to go in Search of them. His Father seeing him 
<PB N="110" REF="120"/> well-dressed, and appear more like a Lord than
<HI>his</HI> Son, testified his Joy at his Re∣turn. RAKEWELL then voluntarily
men∣tioned his having robbed him of fifty-seven Guineas; and, putting a Bill
in his Hand, drawn on the most eminent Banker in <HI>London,</HI> for One
Hundred Pounds, told him, he was not to look on that as a Re∣compence in full,
but as an Earnest only of what he should receive. He then in∣formed him of
his having married a Lady worth Twenty Thousand Pounds but a Fortnight ago;
that he was then going to <HI>Penzance</HI> to settle Affairs with her
Guar∣dian, and would return to <HI>London</HI> in five Days, where his Lady
impatiently expect∣ed him.</P>
<P>THE good old Man was so overjoy'd at hearing this Account of his
Son's good Fortune, that he fell on his Neck, and kissed him, and with
Tears in his Eyes told him, that he was glad to hear of his Success in Life;
but that he had no Occa∣sion for the Hundred Pounds he had given him, he
having, by his Care and Industry, since his leaving him last, saved up
Twen∣ty-seven Pounds; and therefore he begged him to take back again his
generous Gift of a Hundred Pounds, as, till his Affairs were settled, he
might have Occasion for it.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="121"/> BUT this RAKEWELL declined, and observed,
that the Trifle he had given him, he could well spare; that he insisted
on his keeping it; and that in a Fort∣night he might have the Pleasure of
treb∣ling it to him. The old Man, filled with Joy at seeing such a Son,
seemed perfectly happy; went about to his Friends—told them of his
Son's good Fortune—invited them to his House—bought the
greatest Dainties he could possibly procure—and at Eight at Night
the House was full of Guests, drinking Wine, Punch, and Beer, while roast
Geese were at the Fire, Fowls in the Pot, and some other substantial
Dishes provided, to entertain the Friends on the Prodigal's Return; a
Prodigal, that had been guilty of some Er∣rors, that had been bred in
Obscurity, and was now raised to great Grandeur.</P>
<P>THE Evening was spent in great Jolity, and all but RAKEWELL were
perfecty in∣toxicated. After all the Company was gone, the old Man, whose
Heart was now quite merry, went to a private Clo∣set, took out a Bottle of
excellent Citron Water, and desired his Son to take a Glass. The Son obeyed
him, and the Father fol∣lowed the Example. One Glass intro∣duced 
<PB N="112" REF="122"/> another, another followed, and, in short, the
Duumvirate emptied the Bottle. The Son was now what they call half-seas over;
but the old Man was so intoxicated, he could heither sit or stand. With
some Difficulty RAKEWELL got him to-bed, took the Key out of the Door, locked
it, and then—went down Stairs.</P>
<P>HE began now to ransack the House, immediately seized the
old Man's twenty-seven Pounds, and took every Thing away he could
conveniently carry. He then went to the Inn he had put up at on his first
coming to Town, ordered a Post Chaise, and told the Driver to go on as
fast as he could.</P>
<P>A CHANGE of Chaises soon brought him to <HI>London;</HI> and
it happening to be on a <HI>Monday</HI> Night, he attended at the
<HI>Essex-Head Society,</HI> and spoke to the Question, which was;</P>
<Q>Whether, even in this World, a vicious and immoral Man, is not
severely pu∣nished? And if Virtue distressed, does not feel greater
Happiness than exal∣ted Vice? 
<BIBL>PLATO.</BIBL></Q>
<P> <PB N="113" REF="123"/>RAKEWELL took the Affirmative Side of the
Question, and proved, beyond all Manner of Contradiction, that Vice and
Immorality met with its Punishment, by inflicting the Stings of Conscience
at pre∣sent, and the Dread of future Pain. Not that this Doctrine, he
observed, tended in the least to set aside that of a future
Retri∣bution of Rewards and Punishments in another State; where, as we are
taught by the Christian Religion, that Suffering Virtue will meet its ample
Reward, and Triumphant Vice be suitably punished: But the Commission of
good Actions, and the Consciousness of our having performed our Duty,
gave a placid Serenity to our Minds, and a Composure to our Thoughts: A
Felicity which the Huzzas of applau∣ding Thousands could not give, nor the
Hisses of detracting and bitter Enemies take away. He took Notice also of
the Distresses and Agonies of Mind a wicked Man always laboured under,
through a Fear of being exposed, and his Wicked∣ness revealed to the World;
which would consequentially draw on him the severe Penalties of the Law,
and the just Detes∣tation of Mankind. He insisted on it, that the
continual Apprehensions of Disco∣very a wicked Man must be under, and 
<PB N="114" REF="124"/> the Terrors of an abused Conscience, must prevent
the Approaches of Happiness, and dash the Cup of Pleasure with a great
De∣gree of nauseous and bitter Herbs. He then launched out into the
Pleasures of Vir∣tue and Religion; and made it appear, that their Votaries
reaped greater Satis∣faction, and tasted a more home-felt Plea∣sure than
could possibly result from the highest Gratifications of sensual
Appetite, or mere Animal Bliss. To prove these Assertions, he quoted a
few Authors he had either read or heard of, as Enforcers of his Sentiments, and
as Authors of his Doc∣trine: A great Name frequently proves more than a sound
Argument; and People, with whom Learning and Reason have no Sort of Weight,
are yet prevailed on to resign their Judgments, and to give up their Opinions
to an Antient whom Time has sanctified, or to an illustrious Ortho∣dox
Writer, whose Notions and Senti∣ments have been honoured and embraced by the
World.</P>
<P>THE Speech RAKEWELL delivered was well received, and the Society
thought no one could excel him in Propriety of Thought, or Regularity of
Conduct. Af∣ter the Debates were over, RAKEWELL left the Society, and
traversed the Streets, <PB N="115" REF="125"/> till he met with a Female he
liked, and with whom he went to the most conveni∣ent Bagnio.</P>
<P>IN this Manner he continued for some Time, an unaccountable
Aenigma, which none was able to solve: But being at ength discovered to
have robbed a Gentle∣man of Eminence in <HI>Grosvenor-Square,</HI> he was
tried, convicted, and condemned, and executed at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> at the very
Time that his Colleague and Companion, the facetious BOB SCAMPER
suffered.—Thus was the Society deprived of two of their best Members,
the most powerful and ornamental Pillars of their Fabric.</P>
<P>FOR some short Time after this the So∣ciety was observed to
dwindle away, and its staunch Advocates and firm Friends be∣gan to fear that
its Dissolution was nigh. Some imputed it to the Absence of two of their
best Speakers, and the Despair the Public in general had of hearing any
Thing debated on by able Orators, now the best were gone: Some imagined, that
the melancholy Fate of those two Mem∣bers deterred People from attending a
So∣ciety on which they had once reflected such Honour, and which was now
disgraced by <PB N="116" REF="126"/> their ignominious Death; and some were
earnestly wishing for its Annihilation.</P>
<P>IT was not long, however, before the Fears of the one Party, and
the Hopes of the other were turned into Certainty. The Society triumphed, their
Friends rejoiced, and their Enemies were disappointed.</P>
<P>To give a long Detail of every Event that happened in this
Society, to particu∣larize all their Proceedings, and to cha∣racterize all
their Members, would exceed the Bounds I have prescribed myself, and would
be uncommonly tedious: I shall therefore only observe, that from the Time
the Society was removed to the <HI>Essex-Head,</HI> it increased both in
Num∣bers and in Reputation; and so well was it known, that Gentlemen who
lived in the Country, as well as Foreigners of all Nations, if in the least
curious, learned, or ingenious, resorted to it to hear De∣bates that had so
much attracted the At∣tention, and extorted the Admiration of the World.</P>

<PB N="117" REF="127"/>
<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE <HI>Robinhood Society.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Year 1747, the Society was removed to the
<HI>Robinhood</HI> in <HI>Butcher-Row,</HI> at that Time kept by Mr. HALL. The
Room here was vastly more convenient than the other: New Benches were made,
in or∣der that a greater Number of People might be admitted; a Branch for
eighteen <PB N="118" REF="128"/> Candles was suspended from the Ceiling; a
large Chair for the President, curiously gilt, was erected; a Box to keep
the Book of Questions, was provided; a Hammer was purchased for the
President; and, in short, every Thing that was necessary to reflect
Splendor on the Society, and to accommodate its Visitants in the best
Manner, was obtain'd by the industrious Landlord, who had formed great Hopes
of adding a Reputation to his House, and en∣riching himself, from the
vast Concourse of People he expected would assemble there.</P>
<P>IN order to convey the best Idea I can of this famous Society to
the Mind of the Reader, I apprehend it is necessary for me to give a fuller
Account of the Manage∣ment of it, than I have before done.</P>
<P>EVERY Person that attended it, was to pay Six-pence; and that
while these Disputants were enriching their Minds with the Treasures of
Knowledge, they might also practise the God-like Virtue of Charity, they
agreed, that out of every Six-pence the Landlord should be paid Four-pence
for each Quart of Lemonade and Porter; Three Half-pence should be 
<PB N="119" REF="129"/> set by, and appropriated to charitable Uses, to be
agreed on by a select Com∣mittee appointed for that Purpose; and the
remaining Half-penny should be paid to the Clerk, as a Recompence for the
Trouble he was put to, in receiving each Person's Ticket, and taking Care
that the Society in general, and the Dispu∣tants in particular, were duly
serv'd with Liquor.</P>
<P>A PERPETUAL President was also ap∣pointed, whose Name was
JEACOCKE, who was to act as Moderator, and who had, indeed, given great
Satisfactio nin that Character at the <HI>Essex-Head,</HI> for four Years.
His Duty consisted in reading whatever Questions were proposed for
Consideration, and offering them separately to the Choice of the Members:
Those who chose that a Question, should be ad∣mitted, and enter'd in
the Book, were to signify it by holding up their Hands; and those who did
not think it a proper Ques∣tion, were to signify their Opinion in the
same Manner; and the Majority carried it. After this Part of his Duty, he was
to read the Question for the Night's De∣bate, and then ask the several
Members whether they chose to speak to it, begin∣ning <PB N="120" REF="130"/> with the Person who sat next to his left Hand, and proceeding
all round the Room 'till he came to the Person who sat next his right Hand.
When any Person got up to speak, he was also to take Mi∣nutes of what he
conceiv'd to be of par∣ticular Importance, and by thus collecting the different
Sentiments of different People, he was enabled, when it came to his Turn to
speak, to enforce the Arguments that strengthen'd his own Opinion, and
invali∣date those that were against it. If no Person thought proper to
own a Question, or to confess himself the Proposer of it, then the
President was the adopted Father, and he open'd the Question, by explaining
the Terms of it, and concluded the De∣bates on it, by a Speech of his own; but
if the Author of the Question own'd it, then the Person next to his left
Hand spoke to it, and it was to go round in due Order, and the Proposer
concluded it. The Pre∣sident was likewise to keep Order and De∣corum in the
Society; to prevent any personal Altercations, or mean Invectives; to make
them stick to the Point; to bring them back when they went astray; to see
likewise with the Clerk, that the Society was well supplied with Liquor;
and, in short, to do every Thing that was for <PB N="121" REF="131"/> the
Interest of the Society, and the Good of the Members present.</P>
<P>BY this Account of the Duty of the President, it will appear
that his Trouble every Night was not little. It is always difficult to keep a
promiscuous Company in good Order; and a Society, like the ROBINHOOD, where
every one is ad∣mitted for his Six-pence, must be liable to many
Irregularities. But though the Pre∣sident's Trouble was so great, yet his
Attachment to, and Veneration for, the Society was such, that, unlike the
inte∣rested Conduct of most other Presidents, he acted <HI>Gratis,</HI>
contenting himself only with the Honour of the Office.</P>
<P>ONCE a Year a Paper was publish'd by the Society, containing a
Justification of it from the Sneers of Witlings, and the Sarcasms of some
satirical Authors, and setting forth its Nature and Tendency; and
underneath it, was an Account of the Number of People that had attended it all
the Year, distinguishing the particular Number that met each
<HI>Monday</HI> Night. This was thought more likely to vindicate their Conduct,
and wipe off the Asper∣sions that had been thrown on them, than 
<PB N="122" REF="132"/> an elaborate Defence; since by seeing what a vast
Number of People attended each Night, amounting in a Year's Time to upwards of
Five Thousand, on a mo∣derate Computation, the Public might perceive that no
less than Five Thousand three Half-pennies were distributed in Cha∣rity,
amounting to 31<HI>l.</HI> 5<HI>s.</HI>—And even supposing that the
Society could not vie in Splendor with the ROYAL SOCIETY, or in Dignity with
the ANTIQUARIAN, or in Numbers with the SOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF ARTS,
MANU∣FACTURES AND COMMERCE, and even granting their Antagonists
Assertions to be true, that it was a Receptacle for the Illiterate and the
Impious, where horrid and blasphemous Notions were defended and propagated,
and where Religion and Virtue were trodden under Foot; yet still, it may be
urged from great Authority, that Charity <HI>covers</HI> a Multitude of
Sins.</P>
<P>THE Society now advancing in its Reputation, and some of the
most distin∣guished Wits and Scholars frequenting it, it greatly excited
the public Attention. There was scarce a public Paper, but in the Course of
its Animadversions, the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY was taken Notice 
<PB N="123" REF="133"/> of. Doctor HENLEY vindicated it from his Rostrum, and
comparing it to some of the famed Assemblies of Yore, where a CICERO, or
a DEMOSTHENES harangued, he affirm'd it to be of the most eminent Service to
Mankind, by mending their Morals, enlarging their Knowledge, and refining their
Taste; that it was infinitely preferable, consider'd as a School of
Ora∣tory, to the Bar, or the Senate; and that it excell'd the Pulpit, both with
Respect to the Advancement of TRUE RELIGION, and the spreading of Human
Knowledge. Nay, he affirm'd it to be the Sun of the intellectual and moral
World, that with its radiant Beams enlighten'd, chear'd, and vivified the
Spiritual System, as the Fir∣mamental Sun doth the Natural.—In short,
he undertook to vindicate it from his Rostrum in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn
Fields,</HI> from all the Calumnies and Aspersions, that ever had been, or
could be raised against it, and insisted on its being the most
perfect human Institution that was ever form'd, except—his own
Oratory.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, the Pulpits every where display'd its evil
Tendency, and resounded with its Infamy. The Clergy were so much against
it, that, Surgeon∣like, <PB N="124" REF="134"/> they dissected and cut it up
without Mercy. They averr'd, that the House itself could not stand long;
that it was a second Pandemonium, or Assembly of evil Spirits; that
though they at present triumphed, yet they would shortly be de∣feated; and
that every one of the Members that composed it, would infallibly be
d—d. Nay, one Reverend Gentleman in parti∣cular,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That very popular Gentleman, the candid, the ingenious, and
ingenuous Mr. R—M—NE.</NOTE> prophesied, some Years after the
Period I am now describing, that as it was absolutely certain, that the
Merchants that were settling their Books at the Earth∣quake in
<HI>Lisbon,</HI> in the Year 1749, were swallow'd up, and immediately
consign'd to the Care of the D—l; so the ROBIN∣HOOD would shortly
meet the like Fate, or be torn from its Foundations, whirled through the Air by
the Prince of it, be carried, like OUR LADY OF <HI>Loretto,</HI> Thousands of
Leagues, and at Length, with its whole Cargo, thrown down to H—ll.</P>
<P>THE Society, however, in Spight of these Denunciations,
maintain'd its Ground, <PB N="125" REF="135"/> and increased in Fame. The
Names of the Members had been written in their Book of Questions, and new
ones were continually added. The Regulations they were under, were likewise
copied out fair; and these, with the List of the Questions that
succeeded them, were open to every one's Perusal.</P>
<P>THE President discharg'd his Trust with Fidelity and Honour,
and the Society in general thought themselves much oblig'd to him for the
Care he had taken of their Interest, and the good Order and Regula∣rity he
preserv'd.</P>
<P>TO make this History compleat, and to perform my Promise made
in the Title-Page, of giving Memoirs of the most re∣markable Members, I

<DIV1 TYPE="memoir">
<HEAD>Mr. CALEB JEACOCKE, Or, As he is more frequently
called, The BAKER.</HEAD>
<P>MY Intention in giving a few Me∣moirs of this Gentleman,
is not to surprise the Reader, by a Relation of uncommon or interesting
Events, but merely to rescue a Character, greatly traduced, and viely
misrepresented, by all the Authors, as far as I have seen, who have
employ'd their Pens on this Subject.</P>
<P>IN the Lives of the Generality of Men, there is nothing
remarkable enough to satisfy the Curiosity of Readers, unless the
Imagination of the Author is exerted, to feign Events that never happen'd, and
employ his Hero in Scenes he was never engaged in. This is the Case with Mr.
JEACOCKE. His Life has not been che∣quer'd with those variegated Hues that
make so pleasing an Appearance in the Biographer's Page, nor did he ever
run <PB N="127" REF="139"/> through such a Variety of Adventures, as in the
Recital excite alternately the diffe∣rent Passions of the Mind.</P>
<P>HE was born in <HI>London,</HI> and having receiv'd such
an Education as enabled him only to read, write, and cast Accompts, he was
put Apprentice to a Baker. He behaved extremely well in his Appren∣ticeship,
and was pointed out as an Exam∣ple for others in the same Station of Life. As
soon as his Apprenticeship was expir'd, by the generous Legacy of a good
old Aunt, he was enabled to set up for him∣self, and pitch'd upon St.
<HI>Giles</HI>'s for that Purpose. He was remarkably diligent in his
Business, punctual in his Engage∣ments, and, in every Respect, approv'd
himself a truly honest Man; so that he was valued and esteemed by every
one to whom he was known.</P>
<P>HAVING a perfect Knowledge of Ac∣compts, and being
blessed with such a clear Judgment, as could almost intuitively
distinguish and separate Truth from False∣hood, he was requested by
many Mer∣chants and Tradesmen, whose Accompts were long, embarrassed,
and intricate, to adjust and settle them: And this he per∣form'd 
<PB N="128" REF="140"/> with an Expedition and Correct∣ness, that few could
equal, and none excel; even after some of the most emi∣nent Accomptants in
<HI>London</HI> had despaired settling them, and pronounced them
im∣possible to be made out clear and evident.</P>
<P>PROVIDENCE smiled on his Underta∣kings, and he got Money
apace. His being appointed President of the ROBIN∣HOOD SOCIETY, made him
universally known, and THE BAKER has been talk'd of, I believe, in every City
and Town in <HI>England.</HI> JEACOCKE was not averse to Popularity, nor in
Love with it for its intrinsic Worth, but for the Benefit that accompanied
it, in making him known to some of the greatest Men in the Kingdom, and
some of the most respectable and wealthy Merchants, whose Accompts he
settled, and for which he was paid very large Sums.</P>
<P>IN this Situation he continued, increa∣sing his Wealth
and Fame, 'till the latter End of the Year 1761, when he thought proper to
resign his Office of President of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY, having con∣tinued
in that honourable Station nineteen Years: And in a few Months afterwards, 
<PB N="129" REF="141"/> he was appointed one of his Majesty's Justices of
the Peace for the County of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> in which Capacity he now acts
with an Integrity and Honour, with a Clearness of Judgment, and a Fervour of
Humanity, excell'd by none. He is consi∣der'd by the Rational and Judicious,
as a tacit Satire on the Practice of some trading Justices, who sell
their <HI>Judgment</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI> as a <HI>Grocer</HI> sells his
Raisins and Sugar, at so much <HI>per</HI> Pound.</P>
<P>THOUGH JEACOCKE has never re∣ceiv'd, what we term, a
liberal Educa∣tion, yet his Mind is stored with a greater Stock of real
Knowledge, than nineteen Parts out of twenty of those who have breathed a
College Air for many Years. But though his Judgment is clear, and his Knowledge
extensive, yet his unbounded Humanity, his amiable Chearfulness, his
discreet Complaisance, his incorruptible In∣tegrity, are still
superior. His Philanthropy is so great, that Misery and Distress
never applied to him in vain. His Advice and Purse were ever open to the
Indigent; but his Knowledge of the World teaching him to distinguish
between real and pre∣tended Distress, between honest Poverty and artful
Villainy, whenever he found <PB N="130" REF="142"/> Examples of the latter, he
was as rigorous in inflicting Punishments, as in the former he was ready to
afford Relief. In his De∣portment he is grave, but not austere; serious,
but not melancholy; chearful, but not merry; reserved, but not hypo∣critical.
He possesses Judgment without Ostentation; Humility without
Mean∣ness; and Worth without Pride. Ever open to Conviction, in his Office of
Presi∣dent, he never obtruded his Opinions on his Auditors for certain
Truths, but re∣tracted them, and own'd his Mistakes, if pointed out.
<HI>Slave</HI> to no Sect, but a Friend and Member of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> he vindicated her from the rude Assaults of Deists and
Unbelievers, not by positive Dogmas, and mere <HI>Ipse Dixits,</HI> but by
candid Reasoning, and fair Argu∣ment. When unacquainted with the Sub∣ject of
Debate, he sought not by retailing the Sentiments of others, to pass as an
in∣telligent Man, or to take up their Time by delivering a String of Words
without Meaning, but left the Question to be debated by those whose
Inclination or Si∣tuation in Life put it in their Power to speak to it
properly. By these Means, and having a retentive Memory, and a fine natural
Genius, and being remarkably <PB N="131" REF="143"/> attentive to whatever was
said on every Subject, there are few he has not now a general Knowledge of,
and a great many he is particularly conversant in. His Reasoning is
close, but not void of Pers∣picuity; and his Elocution free and na∣tural,
but not rapid and verbose. He ever strives rather to convince the Mind,
than to excite the Passions, and to deliver wholsome Truths and useful
Precepts, than to charm the Imagination with Paradoxes, and lead the Soul to
Fairy Ground, by the Pomp of Words, and the Richness of Imagery; so that
his Eloquence rather resembles a smooth and gentle Current that glides
softly along, than the foaming and majestic <HI>Tyber,</HI> or the rapid
<HI>Tagus,</HI> that rolls its golden Waves in Disdain of Limits, overbearing
and sweeping every Thing before it.</P>
<P>JEACOCKE being such a Person as I have described, it
is no Wonder that he should be revered by the Society. He He had a prodigious
Influence over them, and kept them in more Awe, than a Pe∣dagogue doth his
Scholars, or even than the Speaker of a great Assembly can fre∣quently keep
the Members, as Mr. A—R <PB N="132" REF="144"/> O—S—W

<DIV1 TYPE="memoir">
<HEAD>Mr. Orator HENLEY.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Account of this Phenomenon may not be unacceptable to
the Public. But as a better than I can give of him, has been already given in
one of the Notes to Mr. POPE'S <HI>Dunciad,</HI> I shall extract that
Paragraph, and then hazard a few Remarks of my own on this singular
Genius.</P>
<Q>J. HENLEY the Orator; he preach'd on the <HI>Sundays</HI>
upon Theological Mat∣ters, and on the <HI>Wednesdays</HI> upon all other
Sciences. Each Auditor paid One Shilling. He declaimed some Years against
the greatest Persons, and occa∣sionally did our Author that Honour.
WELSTED, in Oratory Transactions, No. I. publish'd by HENLEY himself,
gives the following Account of him: <PB N="133" REF="145"/> He was born at
<HI>Melton Mowbray</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire.</HI> From his own Parish
School he went to St. <HI>John's College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge.</HI> He began
there to be uneasy; for it <HI>shock'd</HI> him to find he was
<HI>commanded to believe</HI> against his own Judgment in Points of Religion,
Philosophy, &amp;c. for his Genius leading him freely to <HI>dispute all
Propositions,</HI> and <HI>call all Points to Account,</HI> he was impatient
under those Fetters of the free-born Mind. Being admitted to Priest's
Orders, he found the Examina∣tion very short and superficial; and that it
was not <HI>necessary to conform to the Christian Religion,</HI> in order
either to <HI>Deaconship</HI> or <HI>Priesthood.</HI> He came to Town, and
after having for some Years been a Writer for Booksellers, he had an
Ambition to be so for Mini∣sters of State. The only Reason he did not
rise in the Church, we are told, was the Envy of others, and a Disrelish
entertain'd of him, because <HI>he was not qualified to be a complete
Spaniel.</HI> However, he offer'd the service of his Pen to two great Men, of
Opinions and Interests directly opposite; by both of whom being rejected,
he set up a new Project, and stiled himself the <PB N="134" REF="146"/>
<HI>Restorer of antient Eloquence.</HI> He thought it as lawful to take a
Licence from the King and Parliament at one Place, as another; at <HI>Hick's
Hall,</HI> as at <HI>Doctors Commons;</HI> to set up his Oratory in
<HI>Newport Market, Butcher Row.</HI> There (says his Friend) he had the
<HI>Assurance</HI> to form a Plan, which no Mortal ever thought of; he had
Success against all Opposition; chal∣leng'd his Adversaries to fair
Disputa∣tions, and <HI>none would dispute</HI> with him: Writ, read, and
studied twelve Hours a Day; composed three Dissertations a Week on all
Subjects; undertook to teach in <HI>one Year,</HI> what Schools and
Universities teach in <HI>five;</HI> was not terrified by Menaces, Insults,
or Satires, but still proceeded, matured his bold Scheme, and put the
<HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>all that in Danger.</HI> 
<BIBL>WESLTED, Narrative in Orat. Transact. No.
I.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>AFTER having stood some Prosecu∣tions, he turn'd his
Rhetoric to Buf∣foonry upon all public and private oc∣currences. All this
pass'd in the same Room; where sometimes he broke Jests, and
sometimes that Bread which <PB N="135" REF="147"/> he call'd the <HI>Primitive
Eucharist.</HI>—This wonderful Person struck Medals, which he
dispers'd as Tickets to his Subscribers: The Device, a Star rising to the
Meridian, with this Motto, AD SUMMA; and below, INVE∣NIAM VIAM AUT FACIAM. This
Man had a Hundred Pounds a Year given him for the secret Service of a Weekly
Paper of unintelligible Non∣sense, call'd the Hyp-Doctor. 
<BIBL>POPE'S Works, Vol. V.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE Doctor was indeed a Composition of Inconsistency
and Singularity. He wanted not Sense or Learning, but perverted both to the
most unworthy Purposes. He un∣derstood the Principles of Religion very
well; but his chief Delight was in making it appear ridiculous, by the
ludicrous Light in which he view'd it himself, and repre∣sented it to
others. As to any fix'd Prin∣ciples, with Respect to political Notions, he
had none, but employ'd all his Talents to laugh at, and make all Government
appear a mere Joke. But though the Doctor understood Religion tolerably well,
and could, when he thought proper, com∣pare the different Sects, and exhibit
their various Excellencies in a striking and pic∣turesque 
<PB N="136" REF="148"/> Manner, yet he was more dis∣posed to cull out their
several Defects and Imperfections, so as to make all of them appear mere
human Inventions, and the Creatures which interested Priests and art∣ful
Knaves had dressed up, to impose on, and frighten the Vulgar. His chief
Talent lay in Buffoonery, and making the most amiable Things appear mere
Monsters, and hideous Caricatures. Thus Religion was vilified, her
Ministers traduced, Mo∣rality laugh'd at, Merit treated as a mere Non-Entity,
and the greatest Characters in the Kingdom taken to Pieces and ana∣tomised
with all the Licentiousness imagi∣nable, every <HI>Sunday,</HI> when the
Ollio of Scandal and Nonsense was serv'd up to the Public. He was of an
over-bearing Temper, insolent to his Inferiors, and unmannerly to his
Superiors. His Pride, which was excessive, taught him to despise every
one with whom he conversed; and his Self-Love, which was inordinate, and
reign'd over him with a despotic Sway, led him to suppose, that every one
was inferior to himself in Point of Judgment. Hence that ridiculous Vanity
which was visible in his every Action, and prompted him to enforce his own
Arguments with the most indecent Noise and violent Gesticulations, 
<PB N="137" REF="149"/> to disregard the Sentiments of others, and to be
continually interrupting them in the Course of their Reasoning. As a
Com∣panion, therefore, he was odious; as a Clergyman, indecent; as an Orator
re∣prehensible; as a Christian, culpable; and as Man, contemptible.</P>
<P>THE Doctor being such a Person as I have describ'd
him, it may be wonder'd that his Oratory should be so prodigiously
frequented: But, I apprehend, it is no Wonder at all. Novelties will always
attract; Scandal has Charms for many Appetites; and an unrestrain'd
Licentious∣ness of railing against Religion and Go∣vernment, will always
draw vast Numbers of Infidels and Libertines to hear their Patron and
Advocate sounding the Trum∣pet of Sedition. Not but that others of a
different Cast attended the Oratory: Some came to laugh <HI>with</HI> the
Orator, and some to laugh <HI>at</HI> him: Some, to un∣bend their Minds, and
forget the rigid Rules of Morality they had just before heard in our Places
of public Worship; and some to confirm themselves in Infide∣lity and
Impiety, and enable themselves to become Disputants.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="150"/> THE Orator, with various Success,
still kept up his ORATORY KING GEORGE'S, or CHARLES'S CHAPEL, as he
differently term'd it, 'till the Year 1759, when he died. At its first
Establishment it was amazingly crowded, and Money flowed in upon him apace;
and between whiles, it languished and drooped: But for some Years before
its Author's Death, it dwin∣dled away so much, and fell into such an hectic
State, that the few Friends of it fear'd its Decease was very near. The
Doctor, indeed, kept it up to the last, determin'd it should live as long
as he did, and actually exhibited many Evenings to empty Benches. Finding no
one at length would attend, he admitted the Acquaintances of his Door-Keeper,
Runner, Mouth-Piece, and some others of his Followers, <HI>gratis.</HI> On
the 13th of <HI>October,</HI> however, the Doctor died, and the Oratory
ceased; no one having Iniquity or Impudence suf∣ficient to continue it on;
since which it is turn'd into a Tradesman's Warehouse.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. WILLIAM R*D*R.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman enter'd into Holy Orders about five Years
ago, since which he has not frequented the ROBIN∣HOOD SOCIETY. Before that,
he used to be a constant Member, and spoke to every Question that was
debated, with an Extent of Knowledge, and a Clearness of Precision, that
evinced, there were few Subjects he was unacquainted with. But if his Judgment
is very great, his Integrity is still greater. He is a faithful Husband, an
affectionate Father, a good Christian, a firm Friend, a chearful Companion.
His Exposition of the BIBLE, is a stand∣ing Proof of his Piety and
Learning; his DICTIONARY, a noble Monument of critical Accuracy; and his
HISTORY of <HI>England,</HI> an undeniable Evidence of his Candor and Judgment.
As a Preacher, he is deservedly admir'd. His Composi∣tions, 
<PB N="154" REF="166"/> abstracted from the Charms of his Delivery, will bear
the strictest Scrutiny; but when heighten'd and enforc'd by the Beauty of
Pronunciation, and Energy of Action, it is no Wonder they should ex∣tort the
Admiration, and secure the Esteem of the enraptured Congregation. As a
Scholar, he is greatly celebrated, being thoroughly conversant with both the
learned and modern Languages, and which all his Works in general, but his BIBLE
and DICTIONARY in particular, irrefragably prove. The last contains a Fund of
Knowledge beyond any other I know of; and I dare pronounce it to be the best
and most useful of any we have in this Dic∣tionary-making Age.</P>

Oratory, and Turn of Thinking, we shall give a Speech he made some Years
since, on the following Question.</P>
<Q>How are we to be certain of the Incor∣ruptibility and
Freedom of a Parlia∣ment? 
<BIBL>Sign'd, ARISTARCHUS.</BIBL></Q>
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<P> THIS Question is undoubtedly, Mr. President,
of no small Importance; though whether it can be properly de∣bated 
<PB N="163" REF="175"/> in a Society like this, I much doubt. I don't
insinuate by this Obser∣vation, that such Gentlemen of Genius and
Judgment as honour us with their Company, are incapable of determining this
Question, and ascertaining the Marks whereby we may judge and
di∣stinguish a free and incorrupt Parlia∣ment from a venal and corrupt one;
but am afraid, very much afraid, that those Marks are not so easy to be
point∣ed out in any <HI>extempore</HI> Speech. To speak to a Question of
this Nature pro∣perly, requires a previous Consideration of the Subject, and
a deliberate Thought of what we are to utter, lest a hasty Judgment, or
crude Conjectures, might mislead instead of informing a candid Searcher
after Truth. I shall, however, attempt to point out some Criterions to
judge of a free and incorrupt Parlia∣ment, which, I apprehend, may be looked on
as infallible; though I must necessarily omit others, perhaps not less
important, which the Brevity of Time allowed me, will not permit my
men∣tioning.</P>
<P> A FREE and incorrupt Parliament the People will
ever repose the utmost Con∣fidence <PB N="164" REF="176"/> in, and though
their Decisions may be sometimes erroneous, they will never be unjust.
When this is the Case, it will appear evidently by the following Marks,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P> WHEN the Members of Parliament act with a
visible Independency, and will not suffer any one Man to lead them by the
Nose, or brow-beat them into Com∣pliance with his Schemes, and thereby
destroy that Equality which is essentially requisite to preserve the
Liberty of these Assemblies.</P>
<P> WHEN all the Acts and Resolutions of Parliament
are manifestly calculated for the public Good, and not to serve any dark
and private Purposes.</P>
<P> WHEN the Conduct of Gentlemen in Employment makes
it evident, that they are under no Restraint in the House, but are left at
full Liberty to give their Votes, upon all Occasions, according to their
Consciences and Opi∣nions.</P>
<P> THIS is, indeed, the strongest Mark of a free
Parliament, and we may certain∣ly <PB N="165" REF="177"/> conclude it to be the
Case, when the Members, who are in Office, do not constantly run in Herds,
and slavishly follow a Minister in all his Proposals; but when it is
observed, on the con∣trary, that they frequently divide against, what is
called, the Court Party, and are not turned out of their Places, at the End of
a Session, without any visible Reason, but giving a Vote, perhaps,
against some favourite Question, or to make Room for others, whose only
Merit is a sordid, pliant, and prostitute Complisance.</P>
<P> IN short, Gentlemen, a Parliament cannot be
truly denominated free, which lies under any Restraint or Discourage∣ments
whatsoever; nor will their Re∣solutions have any other Weight than what
Force gives them; for I will ven∣ture to assert, that the most
inconsider∣able Minority, or even one honest Man, of the meanest
Understanding, is a better Judge of political Affairs than the largest
Majority, which is packed together, and bribed to serve the Pur∣poses of a
bad Minister.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="178"/> BY viewing our own
Parliament, and having an Eye to the Marks and To∣kens I have pointed out, we
may be enabled to judge whether it is such a one as mentioned in the
Question. I hope, I trust it is, and that it is quite opposite to one I
well remember, a few Years ago, when the grand Corrupter presided at the
Helm. Under his Ad∣ministration Bribery and Corruption were reduced to a
<HI>Susetem,</HI> Election-Jobbing was carried on as openly as any other
Trade, all Virtue and Mo∣rality were laughed out of Countenance, the
interests of Religion were disregard∣ed, and its sacred Foundations
under∣minded, and sapped by Vice and Vena∣lity. Nay, the great Engine of
Cor∣ruption had so despicable an Opinion of <HI>hooman</HI> Nature, that he
laid it down as an incontestible Truth, that no Man could, in the true
Sense of the Word, deserve the Appellation of Patriot, <HI>for every Man
had his Price.</HI> I shall close these Remarks with a beautiful
Passage from our great Poet, describing the Si∣tuation of Things at this
Juncture, re∣marking, by the Way, that every Thing was subservient to the
Cause of <PB N="167" REF="179"/> Venality, and contracted, like the vari∣ous
Rays of the Sun, into one <HI>Focus,</HI> to feed this dark and infamous
Passion.</P>

Schoolmaster, when he leaves his School, ought to leave his
stiff-starched Airs, and imaginary Consequence behind him, and come into
Company with the Ease and Deportment of a Gentleman.—I men∣tion these
Things because the Person, whose Character I am now attempting, is a

<P>THIS Person is consider'd of so much Importance in
the Society, that he has frequently acted as President, in which Character he
has appeared in a very singu∣lar Light. To draw a Comparison be∣tween
J**C**KE and him, might appear invidious, and is certainly unnecessary;
since every one that has seen each of them in the Chair but once, must
have perceiv'd <PB N="173" REF="185" MS="y"/> the Difference. He is by Trade a
Cabinet Maker, and lives in <HI>L—g A—e.</HI> He was born at
<HI>Falmouth</HI> in <HI>Devonshire;</HI> and tho' he has been settled in
<HI>London</HI> some Years, he retains much of his Country Dialect. Whether
he scorns the ignoble Path of Imitation, or whether having no Sense of what
is proper and improper in the Conduct of others, he is an Original without
Design, we are not enough ac∣quainted with his Principles of Action to
determine: But his Manner of opening and conducting the Debates of the Night,
is, in all Respects, different from that of every other President of every
Dispu∣ting-Club that we have either heard of, read of, or seen.</P>
<P>HIS first Movement is a very singular
<HI>Manoeuvre,</HI> or rather <HI>Doit-O Euvre:</HI> It is a deliberate
Extension of the Fore-finger and Thumb of his Right-hand to that Part of the
Candle which is inflam'd, and which he suddenly compresses between his
said Fore-finger and Thumb, giving it a cer∣tain Pull, call'd by the
<HI>Romans, Vellicatio:</HI> and by this <HI>Doit-O Euvre,</HI> he severs the
said inflamed Part of the Candle exactly in the Middle, just as a
School-boy severs a Half-penny Cake, for a Moiety of which 
<PB N="174" REF="186"/> he has received a Farthing from one of his
School-fellows; or, as a facetious old Gentleman divides and sub-divides the
Fragments of a Tobacco-Pipe, while with circumstantial Exactness he relates
some amorous Adventure of his youthful Days. After the useless
Excrescence of the Can∣dle is thus nicely vellicated, the worthy President
casts it on the Floor, with a Grace similar to that, which one Poet says
another exhibits with his Dung; and then, while Mirth sits on every Face, and
sparkles in every Eye, wiping his aforesaid Fore-finger and Thumb upon his
Leathern Breeches, or Black Everlasting Waistcoat, he cries out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Will you be pleased, Gentlemen, <HI>to

<P>THE <HI>next</HI> Question on the Book for our
Evening's Debate, is <HI>a Thing</HI> of Importance; and it is this: Whether a
Lawyer or a <HI>Sollier</HI> is the <HI>most reputablest</HI>
Person?—Pray, Gen∣tlemen, don't laugh; it is worded so in the
Question: Whether a Lawyer, or a <HI>Sollier</HI>—Gentlemen, you may
laugh, if you please, but it is so here <HI>(pointing to the
Book)</HI>—Whether a Lawyer or a <HI>Sollier</HI> is the <HI>most
reputa∣blest</HI> Person? There is no Occasion for my explaining the
Terms of the Que∣stion, for <HI>it is</HI> easy of <HI>themselves.</HI>
The Question, Gentlemen, is sign'd <HI>Bri∣tannius.</HI>—Pray,
Gentlemen, don't laugh—It is against Order—<HI>Bri∣tannicus!</HI>
Well; that's the same Thing. Is Mr. <HI>Britannius</HI> here? If he is not,
the Question is to go from me as if <HI>'twere</HI> mine. Pray, Gentlemen, is
Mr. <HI>Bri∣tannius</HI> here, Gentlemen?—Pray, Gentlemen, <HI>to
Order!</HI> This is against Rule, Gentlemen, for Gentlemen to laugh, and to
shew their Mirth here. <PB N="176" REF="188"/> Pray, Gentlemen, will you be
pleased <HI>to Order</HI>—Well, Gentlemen, as Mr. <HI>Britannius</HI>
is not here, it <HI>oft</HI> for to go from me; and the Terms of it are very
easy, Gentlemen: You all know, Gentlemen, What is meant by the Question,
which is, to know, which is the <HI>more reputabler</HI> Profession, that
of the Lawyer, or the <HI>Sollier.</HI> Now, as to a Lawyer, Gentlemen, I
think, the Term needs no Explanation, and therefore I sha'n't trespass on
your Time to tell you what it is: And as to a <HI>Sollier,</HI> it is as easy
to understand as the other; and therefore the Question may be
<HI>thoft</HI> to be an Enquiry only, which is the <HI>preferabler,</HI> a
Lawyer, or a <HI>Sollier.</HI> Now, there is no Doubt but some Gentlemen will
think the Lawyer is the <HI>eminenter</HI> Man, and others will think the
<HI>Sollier</HI> is so; but that will appear by the Debates. Now, Gentlemen,
I must needs say, that for my own Part, I think a <HI>Sollier</HI> is the
most <HI>cruellest</HI> Man; because as why; he carries Destruction and
<HI>Ruin∣ation</HI> with his Sword, when he is or∣der'd by the General: But
so you may say, the Lawyer does likewise. It's <PB N="177" REF="189"/>
true; but then People may avoid going to Law, but not to War: And there∣fore, I
<HI>include,</HI> the <HI>Sollier</HI> is the most <HI>cruellest,</HI> and
his Profession <HI>froft</HI> with the greatest Mischief in general. A
<HI>Sollier</HI> is possessed with <HI>Enthusiam</HI>—I say,
<HI>Enthusiam</HI>—Pray, Gentle∣men, don't laugh.—I say, a
<HI>Sollier</HI> is <HI>toft</HI> the Dictates of <HI>Enthusiam,</HI> and he
is a <HI>worser</HI> Character than a Lawyer, though some People may say,
that bad's the best. The most <HI>commonest</HI> Thing in the World is to
hear both these Characters <HI>traducified</HI>—Pray, Gentle∣men, don't
laugh. Gentlemen, pray, <HI>to Order</HI>—You are guilty of great
<HI>Irregulation</HI>—Gentlemen, if you don't behave better, I shall
desire your Com∣pany out of the Room—Well: Does any Gentlemen here
choose to speak to the Question? Do <HI>you</HI> choose to speak to
it, Sir? Does any Gentleman on this Side of the Way choose to give us his
Sentiments? What No-body speak to it, Gentlemen! Why, Gen∣tlemen, it's not a
<HI>difficulter</HI> Question than we usually have for our
<HI>Discussa∣tion</HI>—Pray, Gentlemen, <HI>to Order</HI>—I
say, it's not a more <HI>difficulter</HI> Question <PB N="178" REF="190"/>
than many are that are proposed for our
<HI>Discussation</HI>—Why, Gentlemen, you should n't laugh; you
know what I mean; besides, I am a <HI>Falmouth</HI> Man; from
<HI>Falmouth,</HI> Gentlemen, in <HI>Devonshire;</HI> and you must not
expect my <HI>Pronunsation</HI> to be the most <HI>per∣fectest,</HI> for
they all talk there as I do here—Pray, Gentlemen, don't laugh!—Does
any one chuse to speak to the Question? Oh, a Gentleman is
<HI>up</HI>—Pray, Gentlemen; be silenced.</P>

<P>WE shall next give a Character of a Gentleman very well known in
the So∣ciety, by the Name of 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="memoir">
<HEAD>Mr. S**TH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman is by Trade a Dyer, and in Religion a
red-hot <HI>Antimonian.</HI> When he bellows forth his peculiar No∣tions, his
Eyes are inflamed, and his whole Body seems to be the Mansion of some
turbulent Spirit. He is no tame Orator, nor wants for Choice of Words, but is
so unhappy in the Application of them, that he conveys a quite different
Meaning <PB N="179" REF="191"/> to the Minds of the Auditors from what he
himself understands: Let the Question be what it will, he lugs in
Religion by the Head and Shoulders, and the most carnal Proposition is
spiritualized into the most divine Meaning: Thus, the secret Parts of
Religion are all peeped into and exposed, and Discourses in the Style of
the <HI>Canticles,</HI> proposed as proper for Imi∣tation. S**TH is a great
Admirer of WHITFIELD, and thinks him one of the greatest Men in
<HI>Europe.</HI> If Regard is extorted, and Esteem rivetted, by a mutual
Sympathy of Minds, and a similar Turn of Thinking, it is no Wonder our Orator
should have conceived an high Opinion of his Brother Orator: And, indeed,
their Oratory is not much unlike, for Orator S**TH is as ranting, as
unin∣telligible, and as enthusiastic, as Orator WH**F***D.</P>
<P>AS to the Abilities of this curious Gentleman, they may be
easily guessed at from what we have said, and to dwell longer on such
a Character, would be to intimate he was of more Importance than he really is.
However, we should ill dis∣charge our Duty of giving competent 
<PB N="180" REF="192"/> Ideas of our Orators, did we not draw their leading
Features; though we pretend not to be so particular as to paint all of
them.</P>

the End of their speaking during the six Minutes allow'd them, seems to
be merely to shew that they are endued with one Faculty, which other Animals

<HEAD>Mr. V*N*B**S.</HEAD>
<P>AN Attorney, or an Attorney's Clerk, that pours out
Vollies of Nonsense, as fast as a <HI>London</HI> Militia Platoon fire
their Muskets. He is a professed Advocate for all ministerial
Measures, and endeavours to prove, by Logic and Noise, that Mini∣sters,
like Kings, can do no Wrong. If his Opponents insist, that if they
<HI>can</HI> do no Wrong, they must be infallible, and In∣fallibility only is
the Attribute of GOD; he answers, they are infallible, and are ap∣pointed by
GOD; so that the divine inde∣feasible Right of Kings, with all its
con∣commitant Circumstances of Non-Resi∣stance and Passive Obedience,
are strongly enforced by this ingenious Quill-driver in every Political
Debate. If it is objected to him, that the <HI>Jure Divino</HI> is a Doctrine
that strikes at the Vitals of our present Constitution, by tacitly
declaring the glori∣ous Revolution to be an Usurpation, and the present
illustrious House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to be mere P**t**d**s to the Throne,
he will not dispute the Inference, but maintain his Position.—So much
for his Political Notions. As to his religious ones, <PB N="183" REF="195"/> he
is not less strenuous. He thinks the Church, established by Law in this
King∣dom, not only the best visible Church on Earth, but that it is
absolutely without Spot or Blemish; and he would have as implicit a Regard
paid to all human Ordi∣nances and Ceremonies as to the most divine Precepts;
and in consequence of these ve∣ry orthodox and very charitable Opinions, he
thinks all who dissent from the established Church, <HI>should
immediately quit</HI> England, <HI>and reside elsewhere:</HI> But to what
Place they are to retire he does not inform us. As to the Deists, he lashes
them without Mercy, and pronounces it impossible for them to be useful
Subjects, or honest Men; and therefore, as they cannot be serviceable in a
State, they should be banished from it, or broke upon the Wheel, or, at
least, be kept in Prison to hard Labour, till their Minds are open to
Conviction, and prepared to believe the glorious Truths of the Gospel.</P>
<P>IT is with no small Difficulty we have fathomed these
Sentiments of our Man of Law; who brings together such a Cloud of unmeaning
Words, that it requires a very penetrating Eye to see through the
Obscurity: That Eye we think we pos∣sess.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="196"/> AS an Orator, he is extremely
con∣temptible: His Action is forced, violent, and unnatural, and his
Pronunciation, which is very vicious, is made more disa∣greeable by his
stammering. His Mind seems stored with very few Ideas, and those few,
very wrong ones. His mental Op∣tics are extremely defective, and he views
Things by such broken and refracted Rays, as render them scarcely
visible. It is no Wonder, therefore, that he should not be able to make his
Auditors fully perceive what he does not clearly behold himself. In a Word,
his Character is well expres∣sed in Mr. POPE'S Parody of a Passage in
DENHAM'S <HI>Cooper's-Hill,</HI> describing the River <HI>Thames:</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>Flow, Welsted flow! like thine Inspirer, Beer,</L>

<L>Tho' stale, not ripe, tho' thin, yet never
clear;</L> 
<L>So sweetly mawkish, and so smoothly dull:</L> 
<L>Heady, not strong; o'erflowing, tho' not full.</L></Q> A Specimen of his Oratory is given in the following little Speech which he
made on this Question, 
<Q><PB N="185" REF="197"/>Whether the <HI>Robinhood

<HEAD>Mr. A. M. E. C**KE.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Readers will wonder what My∣stery is couched under
the Letters A. M. E. and some will suppose that they are no more than the
Initials of Mr. C**KE'S Christian Names—His Christian Name is THOMAS;
but since a certain Operation he perform'd on himself, he 
<PB N="187" REF="199"/> has, in his numerous Writings, intitled himself A. M.
E. C**KE; Letters, which though unintelligible to the Public, are yet full of
Meaning to us, who have a great Intimacy with this Gentleman; and they
signify ADAM, MOSES, EMA∣NUEL.—So much for his adopted Name.</P>
<P>HE was born in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> re∣ceiv'd a
liberal Education there, and from thence was sent to <HI>Oxford:</HI> In due
Time he enter'd into Orders, return'd to his native County, and was soon
after pre∣sented with a pretty good Living. A Turn for Mysteries led him to
a Perusal of some of our mystic Writers, and he caught the same
enthusiastic Flame which warm'd them. A recluse and sedentary Life
greatly cherish'd his Notions, and it was not long before Parson C**KE was
look'd on by all the Country as a second JACOB BEHMEN. But he had some
Notions peculiar to himself. He maintain'd in his Sermons, and in his private
Conversation, that the <HI>Jewish</HI> Ceremonies were not ab∣rogated by
the Christian Dispensation, but were still of universal Obligation.
In par∣ticular, he insisted on the Necessity of Circumcision, and
supported his Doctrine by his own Practice. Such novel Notions, 
<PB N="188" REF="200"/> and such extravagant Behaviour in a Pro∣testant
Clergyman, soon reached the Ears of the Bishop of the Diocese, and he was
deprived, and his Living given to another. Our <HI>Jewish</HI> Christian
then came to <HI>London,</HI> and commenced Author; but his unintelli∣gible
Jargon not selling, he was reduced to great Distress. In this Dilemma he
knew not what to do; but, at last, put in Practice another odd Notion, that
the Goods of Fortune ought to be shared in common by all God's
Creatures..</P>
<P>AMONG various Expedients for satisfying his Hunger
formed upon this Plan, one was, to resort to some well-frequented
Coffee-house, and placing himself at a Table, to appropriate to his own
Use the first buttered Muffin and Pot of Coffee that was brought to it.
This he would often be permitted to do, without any In∣terruption from the
Gentlemen that sat near him, some of whom were diverted, and some
astonished, to see a Clergyman thus familiarly regale himself with a
Break∣fast that was not provided for him. As soon as it was finished,
however, he would rise from the Table, say a short Grace, and very
unconcernedly make towards the Door; and, when questioned by the 
<PB N="189" REF="201"/> Master of the Coffee-house, about the Impropriety of
using that which he did not order, and the Injustice of not paying for it
when he had done, he would prove by Mode and Figure, that the good Things of
this World ought to be in common. The Bucks and Bloods enjoyed the Joke, and a
Ring was usually formed for the two Disputants, the Parson and the
Coffee-man; but the Coffee-man being unable to invalidate the Testimonies
brought out of the <HI>Talmud,</HI> and many learned Writings, which were
quoted in <HI>Hebrew, Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> the Parson always came
off vic∣torious.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Practice by which this Gentleman signalized
himself, was Street-Preaching; and having for some Time before let his
Beard grow, he was gene∣rally known by the Name of <HI>The Bearded
Priest.</HI> In this extravagant Manner he went on for some Time, 'till
some Clergymen made Interest for him to be sent to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> where
he was confined for about two or three Years. As soon as he was released,
he took a Resolution of going to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and actually travel∣led
over that Country on Foot, with not a single Farthing in his Pocket,
subsisting, <PB N="190" REF="202"/> as himself informs us in one of his
Pamph∣lets, by the Contributions of the well∣disposed. From thence he went
to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and travelled over a great Part of that Kingdom; and on
his Arrival at <HI>Dublin,</HI> in 1760, was entertained by some Gen∣tlemen
in <HI>Trinity College,</HI> who, compas∣sionating the melancholy Case of
a Clergy∣man in Distress, gave him his Board and Lodging <HI>gratis.</HI>
After he had staid here a few Months, and published some ve∣ry
<HI>original</HI> Pieces, which no one could understand but himself, he
return'd to <HI>England,</HI> visited <HI>Oxford,</HI> and then came again to
<HI>London,</HI> where he now resides, but intends going to <HI>America,</HI>
as soon as his Finances will enable him.</P>

<P>A MAN that, by his Oddity of Aspect, and Peculiarity of
Expression, has attracted the public attention in a consi∣derable Degree;
for he has been frequent∣ly honoured by being made the Subject of some
Essays in our daily Papers.</P>
<P>HE was born at <HI>Exeter</HI> about fifty∣eight Years
ago, of poor, but, as it is said, honest Parents, who sent him to School,
where he learnt both to read and write. At the Age of thirteen he was
apprenticed there to a Shoemaker, and during his Apprenticeship, took great
De∣light in reading the delectable Poems of WITHERS, QUARLES, HERBERT,
CLEVELAND, and other <HI>very great</HI> Au∣thors, and read them so
frequently, that he got many of them by Heart. At the Expiration of his
Apprenticeship, he came to <HI>London,</HI> and having received some
small Pittance from his Friends, set up for him∣self in the
<HI>Strand,</HI> took unto him a Wife, and had four or five Children by her. So
far we see the bright View of his Life's History. But the World soon
frowned <PB N="196" REF="208"/> on him; and though he was continually 
<Q REND="inline">"supplying his Knowledge-Box with
Furniture,"</Q> as himself elegantly ex∣presses it, by reading the
before-mentioned Authors, and attending constantly at Mr. Orator HENLEY'S
Chapel, to whom he was Mouth-Piece, running on his Errands, praising his
Oratory, and doing him other Services, yet his Stock in Trade, his Houshold
Goods, his Customers, and his Reputation, were decreasing daily. Altho'
Poverty now not only stared our Orator in the Face, but was his constant
Compa∣nion, yet was he indefatigable in the Im∣provement of his Mind, and bore
his Misery with great Patience. But his <HI>Rib</HI> possessed not
the same Fortitude. She lamented her Infelicity in very pathetic Terms, and
Tears ran from her Eyes in copious Streams. P*** beheld her Distress with
the Apathy of a Stoic; he answered her Complaints and Remonstrances with
some Verses of QUARLES, and her Tears he endeavoured to dry up with some
Sen∣timents from HERBERT or CLEVELAND: but all would not avail; her Tongue
still ran on, and her Tears still flowed. She wanted more substantial
Food, than dull Lines of Jingle; and had rather see some Bread and
Cheese, and small Beer <PB N="197" REF="209"/> on the Table, for herself
and Children, than hear the best Arguments in the World, to prove that
<HI>whatever is, is right.</HI> Up∣braidings and severe Reproaches followed,
and the Wife insisted, that the Husband was an idle Fellow, who neglected
his Business, and the most important Con∣cerns, merely to prate about
Things he did not understand, and to attend the Atheistical Orator, whose
Discourses he could never be benefitted by. After living some Years in
this uncomfortable State, the Wife and Children left the Husband to his Fate,
and pursued their own. The Wife took decent Lodgings, sought out for
Business in Washing and Plain-Work, and succeeded so well, that she
bred up her Children properly, wanted for nothing, and lived happily. As to our
Son of CRISPIN, he took a paltry Lodging, and went on in the same idle Manner
as be∣fore, getting what Work he could, and putting it out to be performed. In
this Manner he has continued for some Years.</P>
<P>As to the Oratory of this <HI>Poetical Cobler,</HI> as he
is usually called, it is, 
<Q> 
<L>—Rudis, indigestaque moles,</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. PRESIDENT!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT there Gentleman, on this Side of the Way,
seems to want a Light to be struck into his Knowledge-Box: If he had opened
the Trap-Doors of his Mind, it might have entered in. But I find it has not;
and therefore, <PB N="199" REF="211"/> his Understanding wants snuffing. He
has really spoke like a Crabb-Lantern, and a Snap-Jack; so I have done with
him. <HI>Howsumdever,</HI> I shall now take Notice of the other rum
Gentleman, who thought I was a Man of Fortune, in his speaking to the last
rum Question, in so rum a Manner. 
<Q> 
<L>But tho' I in this Scarlet Coat appear,</L> 
<L>I am not worth a single Groat a
Year.</L></Q> So much for him—As to the Question, Mr. President, I
think it is no Question at all; for every one that has not De∣traction in the
Head, and Prejudice in the Heart, must own and confess, 
<Q> 
<L>That Words alone can Harmony impart,</L> 
<L>To charm th' Attention, and command the
Heart</L></Q> And that is Eloquence, Mr. President, and such as must be
admitted by all who do not seek the Indulgence of their vo∣racious Appetites:
And 
<Q> 
<L>Which Heads refin'd alone by Reason
know,</L> 
<L>Where Sense and Judgment do together
flow.</L></Q> Reason, Mr. President, is King Na∣ture's 
<PB N="200" REF="212"/> Privy Counsellor; and Eloquence is to teach us 
<Q> 
<L>To reason down the Fever of the Blood,</L>

<L>And sooth with Words the Tumult of the
Soul.</L></Q> I wish the Gentleman in his own Hair, yonder, who is now
picking his Teeth, and who looks with three Eyes at me, had marshalled up his
Thoughts, har∣monized his Understanding, regulated his Ideas, and informed
his Judgment; then he might 
<Q> 
<L>Blow away, and speak at large,</L> 
<L>And with a holy Violence ram down the
Charge.</L></Q> Instead of which he has taken hold of the Muzzle instead of
the But-End of the Doctrine, and hurried a half-formed Production on the
Public. 
<Q> 
<L>He has launch'd forth quite into wild
Ex∣tremes,</L> 
<L>Of senseless Noise, and
undistinguish'd Themes.</L></Q> <HI>Howsumdever,</HI> Mr. President, I
for∣give him for his <HI>Fun-Dawsit</HI> on me; especially, as his Thoughts
<HI>is</HI> stagnated, <PB N="201" REF="213"/> and an Embargo laid on his
Under∣standing: For, 
<Q> 
<L>Forgiveness to the Injur'd does
belong;</L> 
<L>They never pardon that have done the
Wrong.</L></Q> Eloquence, Mr. President, may be de∣fined to be, as it were,
as when a Man is eloquent; and to be so, he ought to do as I do; that is,
drink a good deal of Gin, and avoid eating Onions. A great Poet says; 
<Q> 
<L>Immortal Gin! since I have sung thy
Praise,</L> 
<L>Crown me with Juniper instead of
Bays,</L></Q> And that is Eloquence itself, Mr. Pre∣sident; and no one will
dispute it that has poised <HI>their</HI> Understanding, and not violated
the Dignity of human Nature. Those who dispute it, like my Wife's
Relations, 
<Q> 
<L>May the Curse of G— then light on
one and all,</L> 
<L>To d— their Bodies, but preserve
their Soul.</L></Q> As to that Gentleman that said Elo∣quence is hurtful to
Society, because Poets are eloquent, and, in consequence 
<PB N="202" REF="214"/> of it, poor, it by no Means follows;
<HI>howsumdever,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>If Thought alone the Appetite can clay,</L> 
<L>Could Poets live, Camelion-like, on Air;</L>

<L>If neither Thirst or Hunger could
annoy,</L> 
<L>The poorest Poet never need despair.</L></Q> So that this Gentleman's Speech was a false Motion, Mr. President, and
the Question topped his Understanding; <HI>howsumdever,</HI> he chose
to speak to it, lest he should over-gorge himself, and burst at the
Touch-hole. Another Gentleman, who said as how Elo∣quence was pernicious,
seems to have contracted all his Senses into his Bow∣sprit, to have
loaded his Head with Ar∣gument, and then to have primed, cock∣ed, and fired
away; <HI>howsumdever,</HI> I excuse him, because I find he is one of the
cross-legged Knights of the Steel-Bar, and a Wit. But Mr. POPE says, 
<Q> 
<L>A Wit's a Feather, and a Chief's a Rod;</L> 
<L>An honest Man's the noblest Work of
<HI>GOD.</HI></L></Q> Eloquence, Mr. President, is the Gift of the SUPREME;
and we <HI>oft</HI> not to despise any of his Gifts: Now, if I had 
<PB N="203" REF="215"/> the Wisdom of ULYSSES, the Arms of ACHILLES, the
Riches of CROESUS, and the Wisdom of SOLOMON, 
<Q> 
<L>I'd scower the Universe from Folly and
from Vice,</L> 
<L>And make this World a second
Paradise.</L></Q> But I fear it's impossible for me to do this, though,
with Eloquence, one might almost do any Thing, even if one were attacked both
in Front and Flank, and knocked down in the Rear. But I think that those
should, 
<Q> 
<L>Who strive to discompose th' exalted
Mind,</L> 
<L>Be to eternal Banishment confin'd.</L></Q>
And some of these there are in this So∣ciety, who are for interrupting me
in my Discourse very often; but they had better open the Casements of
their Bo∣dies to let in Light to their Minds, as I do; for I always 
<Q> 
<L>Do much desire and long to know,</L> 
<L>The Wit that from Choice Spirits
flow.</L></Q> Mr. President! I see your all-silencing Hammer is lifted up
to knock me <PB N="204" REF="216"/> down; but I shall just desire to
relate a Fact, which I know to be true, of the public Crier at
<HI>Topsham</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> which I consider as a very good
Piece of Eloquence. He had no less than ten Children; and they becoming
charge∣able to the Parish, he was required by the Church-wardens to get no
more, and used barbarously for those he had; whereupon he went into the
Market∣place, took his Bell in his Hand, rung it, and then said, <HI>O
Yes!—O Yes!—O Yes!—This is to give Notice,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>That when Breeches and Petticoats do come
near,</L> 
<L>Flesh and Blood cannot forbear.</L></Q>
This was wielding the sacred Weapon, and making the Muse to flow, and I
think he acted right in all Respects; for Mr. POPE says, 
<Q> 
<L>The Goods of Fortune variously are
giv'n;</L> 
<L>A Wife is the peculiar Gift of
Heav'n.</L></Q> He doesn't say two, Mr. President. But I see the
uplifted, all-silencing Hammer again fills your Hand, and threatens my Head;
and therefore I <PB N="205" REF="217"/> must conclude. But, Mr. President,
give me Leave to mention a bad Cus∣tom in this Society, which is to shew
Marks of their <HI>Approbration</HI> or <HI>Dis∣approbration:</HI> Now, Mr.
President, I never clap the Speakers, for fear of p*x**g their
Understandings; and yet, I'll work, walk, or talk, as much for a Shilling, as
any Lawyer or Parson in <HI>England</HI> will for a Guinea.</P>

<P>WITH this Character we shall close our Account of the
principal Speakers of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY; an Account, that though written
without Embellishment, is not destitute of Fidelity and Candour.
Un∣influenced by any private Views, we have neither indulged Resentment by
wanton Censure, nor, for the Sake of personal At∣tachments, prostituted
Praise.</P>
<P>OF the general Character of the Socie∣ty, and its Influence on the
Minds of young Persons, little has been said: And while we were lately
ruminating on the Manner in which we should conclude this great Work, a
Friend, who had perused our Manuscript, came in; and, after knowing the
Subject of our Meditations, thus warmly expostulated upon it.</P>
<Q><PB N="206" REF="218"/> 
<P> THERE can be no Doubt in what Light the Society must appear
to every Mind, whose Judgment is not determi∣ned by Fancy and Passion,
but by the Nature and Tendency of Principles and Actions demonstrated by
Facts. From the History you have given of the Socie∣ty, it is evident, that
it maintained its Usefulness and Honour no longer, than while it faithfully
adhered to that fun∣damental Law of its Institution, by which all religious
Questions were excluded from the Subjects of Debate.</P> 
<P>WHEN, for the Diffusion of useful Knowledge, it was thought
expedient to admit every Person that chose to come, and, for that
Purpose, to assem∣ble at a Public-House; if two or three Hours had been
set apart for the Busi∣ness of the Night, and no eating drink∣ing or
smoaking had been permitted in that Interval; and, if the Subjects of Debate
had been confined to the Trade and Manufactures of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to
Natural History, the Mathematics, and the Liberal Arts; how poorly would the
Meetings of the Society have been attended! Though its Credit might 
<PB N="207" REF="219"/> have remained, its Number would not have been much
increased. But, as soon as it was known, that the Drunkard and the Glutton
might regale them∣selves at the Expence of the Temperate, and that every
illiterate Prater might display his Oratory, and signalize him∣self as
the Champion of Deism or Chri∣stianity; the Society was immediately crowded
with noisy Butchers, Tinkers, and Coblers; with self-conceited and
frontless Infidels; with those not less profane, though more
inconsistent, <HI>Ari∣ans</HI> and <HI>Socinians;</HI> and with the most
contentious, and yet the worst Dis∣puters about Christianity,
<HI>Calvinists</HI> and <HI>Antinomians.</HI> The first Principles of
Religion, and the essential Doctrines of the Gospel, were called in
Question every Night in the Presence of young People, who unhappily
deviating in their Search after Truth and Goodness, were here betrayed into
Error, and shut up from the Sight of That, by which alone Sin can be
destroyed and Holiness re∣stored.</P> 
<P>THE <HI>Book of Questions,</HI> as you have represented it,
is itself a sufficient Proof of the licentious and even wan∣ton 
<PB N="208" REF="220"/> Levity, with which the most sacred Doctrines and
Characters have been treated: In the Specimen of Religious Questions which,
you say, you have selected from that Book, there were two, which I was
compelled to strike out, to save myself from being a Par∣taker in the
Guilt of the most horrid Blasphemy. And he, who, by his Presence, has
contributed to support a Society, in which such Questions are suffered
to be proposed, registered, and debated, has so far contributed to the
Support of Profaneness and Impiety. From this Charge I exempt not even THE
BAKER himself, who is intitled to no higher Honour from his long
Presidentship, than that of keeping a rude Multitude in some external
Order, and preserving the Regularity of an Infidel-Disputation.</P> 
<P>MANY Things, indeed, are called Religion that do not belong to
it; but that which is essential in Religion, is private and personal,
subsisting not in disputable Notions and refined Ar∣guments, but in the
Sensibilities and Perceptions of the Heart: For who, in his Senses, can
dispute a Moment <PB N="209" REF="221"/> whether he is a Sinner? and who, that
feels himself a Sinner, can dispute a Moment whether he should receive or
reject the Pardon that is offered him? and who can depend upon the Pardon of
Sin, any further than he feels in his Heart a Principle disapproving,
dis∣owning, resisting and subduing the Power of Sin? And yet what is
more prevalent in all our <HI>Societies for Free Debate and Inquiry,</HI> than
the Folly and Madness of attempting to destroy these Sensibilities, to
stifle these Convictions, and to prove, by Logical Disputation, that Man
is now as he was originally made; that he is, therefore, no Sin∣ner; and that,
consequently, he need∣eth no Redeemer. But he, who abandons that penitential
and humbling Sense of Sin, and that endearing Sense of pardoning Mercy,
which the Chri∣stian Redemption awakens in every Heart; and endeavours to
persuade himself, that he can be set free from his Evil and Misery, and
made good and happy, by Definitions, or Axioms, or Forms, or Systems, or any
Thing less than the Renovation of a Divine Life; abandons that for which the 
<PB N="210" REF="222"/> whole Creation cannot yield him a Recompence.</P> 
<P>OF the Nature and Tendency of all these <HI>Societies for free
Debate and In∣quiry,</HI> the Writer of THE ADVEN∣TURER has expressed his
Sentiments with just Indignation.</P> 
<P>NOTHING <HI>(says he)</HI> has offended me more, than the
Manner in which Sub∣jects of eternal Moment are often treat∣ed. To dispute on
Moral and Theological Topics, is become a Fashion; and it is usual with
Persons, of whom it is no Reproach to say they are ignorant, because
their Opportunities of gaining Knowledge have been few, to deter∣mine with the
utmost confidence upon Questions to which no human Intellect is equal. In
almost every Tavern and every Alehouse, illiterate Petulance prates of
Fitness and Virtue, of Free∣dom and Fate; and it is common to hear Disputes
concerning everlasting Happiness and Misery, the Mysteries of Religion
and the Attributes of GOD, intermingled with Lewdness and Blas∣phemy, or at
least treated with wanton Negligence and absurd Merriment.</P> 
<P><PB N="211" REF="223"/> FOR Lewdness and Blasphemy, it is
hoped no Apology will seriously be of∣fered: And it is probable, that if
the Question in Debate was, which of the Disputants should be hanged on
the Morrow, it would be conducted with Decency and Gravity, as a Matter of
some Importance: That visible good Humour, and that noble Freedom, of which
they appear to be so fond, would be thought not well to agree with their
Subject; nor would either of the Gen∣tlemen be much delighted, if an Argu∣ment
intended to demonstrate that he would, within a few Hours, be sus∣pended
on a Gibbet, should be embel∣lished with a witty Allusion to a Button and
Loop, or a jocular Remark, that it would effectually secure him from future
Accidents, either by Land or Water: And yet the Justice and Mercy of
OMNIPOTENCE, the Life and Death of the Soul, are treated with Ridicule and
Sport; and it is contended, that with Ridicule and Sport, they ought always to
be treated.</P> 
<P>BUT the Effect, as well as the Man∣ner of those fashionable
Disputes, is <PB N="212" REF="224"/> always ill: They tend to establish
what is called Natural Religion, upon the Ruins of CHRISTIANITY; and a Man has
no sooner stiled himself a Moral Philosopher, than he finds that his
Duty both to GOD and Man, is contracted into a very small Compass, and may
be practised with the greatest Facility. Yet, as this Effect is not always
appa∣rent, the Unwary are frequently delu∣ded into fatal Error, and imagine
they are attaining the highest Degree of Moral Excellence, while they are
in∣sensibly losing the Principles upon which alone Temptation can be
resisted, and a steady Perseverance in well-doing, secured.</P> 
<P>AMONG other favourite and unsus∣pected Topics, is the
EXCELLENCY OF VIRTUE. Virtue is said necessarily to produce its own
Happiness, and to be constantly and adequately its own Reward; as Vice, on
the contrary, never fails to produce Misery, and in∣flict upon itself the
Punishment it de∣serves; Propositions, of which every one is ready to
affirm, that they may be admitted without Scruple, and be∣lieved without
Danger. But from hence <PB N="213" REF="225"/> it is inferred, that future
Rewards and Punishments are not necessary, either to furnish adequate
Motives to the Practice of Virtue, or to justify the Ways of GOD: In
Consequence of their being not necessary, they become doubtful; the DEITY
is less and less the Object of Fear and Hope; and as Virtue is said to be
that which produces ultimate Good below, whatever is sup∣posed to produce
ultimate Good below, is said to be Virtue: Right and wrong are confounded,
because remote Con∣sequences cannot perfectly be known; the principal
Barrier by which Appe∣tite and Passion are restrained, is broken down.
The Remonstrances of Con∣science are overborne by Sophistry; and the
acquired and habitual Shame of Vice is subdued by the perpetual Efforts of
vigorous Resistance.</P> 
<P>THE Paper which contains this Pas∣sage, seems to have been
written as an Introduction to the Story of poor DICK FREEMAN, related by
himself under the assumed Name of OPSINOUS. And as that Story is a
forcible Instance of the unhappy Influence of <HI>Disputing-Clubs,</HI> and
may strike those whom <PB N="214" REF="226"/> Persuasion will not reach,
I think you cannot do better than print it as a Con∣clusion to your History
of the ROBIN∣HOOD SOCIETY.</P></Q>
<P>THUS ended my Friend, whose Opi∣nion upon this Matter I have
made pub∣lic, as the best Reason for my taking his Advice. The Story he
recommends, is as follows.</P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>ADVENTURER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OF all the Expedients that have been found out to
alleviate the Miseries of Life, none is left to despair but Com∣plaint: And
though Complaint, without Hope of Relief, may be thought rather to increase
than mitigate Anguish, as it re∣collects every Circumstance of
Distress, and imbitters the Memory of past Suffer∣ings by the
Anticipation of future; yet, like weeping, it is an Indulgence of that which it
is Pain to suppress, and sooths with the Hope of Pity the Wretch who
despairs of Comfort. Of this Number is he who now addresses you: Yet the
Solace of Complaint and the Hope of Pity, are not the only Motives that have
induced <PB N="215" REF="227"/> me to communicate the Series of Events, by which
I have been led on in an insensi∣ble Deviation from Felicity, and at last
plunged in irremediable Calamity: I wish that others may escape Perdition;
and am, therefore, solicitous to warn them of the Path, that leads to the
Precipice from which I have fallen.</P>
<P>I AM the only Child of a wealthy Farmer, who, as he was
himself illiterate, was the more zealous to make his Son a Scholar,
imagining, that there was in the Knowledge of Greek and Latin, some se∣cret
Charm of perpetual Influence, which, as I passed through Life, would
smooth the Way before me, establish the Happi∣ness of Success, and
supply new Resources to Disappointment. But not being able to deny
himself the Pleasure he found in having me about him, instead of
sending me out to a Boarding-School, he offered the Curate of the Parish
ten Pounds a Year and his Board, to become my Tutor.</P>
<P>THIS Gentleman, who was in Years, and had lately buried
his Wife, accepted the Employment, but refused the Salary: The Work of
Education, he said, would agreeably fill his Intervals of Leisure, and 
<PB N="216" REF="228"/> happily coincide with the Duties of his Function: But he
observed that his Cu∣racy, which was thirty Pounds a Year, and had long
subsisted him when he had a Family, would make him wealthy now he was a
single Man; and therefore he insisted to pay for his Board: To this my
Father, with whatever Reluctance, was obliged to consent. At the Age of six
Years I began to read my Accidence under my Precep∣tor, and at fifteen had gone
through the Latin and Greek Classics. But the Lan∣guages were not all that
I learned of this Gentleman; besides other Science of less Importance, he
taught me the Theory of CHRISTIANITY by his Precepts, and the Practice by his
Example.</P>
<P>AS his Temper was calm and steady, the Influence which
he had acquired over me, was unlimited: He was never capri∣eiously severe;
so that I regarded his Dis∣pleasure not as an Effect of his Infirmity,
but of my own Fault: He discovered so much Affection in the Pleasure with
which he commended, and in the tender concern with which he reproved me, that I
loved him as a Father; and his Devotion, tho' rational and manly, was yet so
habitual and fervent, that I reverenced him as a <PB N="217" REF="229"/> Saint.
I found even my Passions con∣trouled by an Awe which his Presence
impressed; and, by a constant Attention to his Doctrine and Life, I
acquired such a Sense of my Connexion with the invisi∣ble World, and
such a Conviction of the Consciousness of DEITY to all my Thoughts,
that every inordinate Wish was secretly suppressed, and my Conduct
regulated by the most scrupulous circum∣spection.</P>
<P>MY Father thought he had now taken sufficient Care of my
Education, and therefore began to expect that I should assist in
overlooking his Servants, and ma∣naging his Farm, in which he intended I
should succeed him: But my Preceptor, whose principal View was not my
tem∣poral Advantage, told him, that, as a Farmer, great Part of my Learning
would be totally useless; and that the only Way to make me serviceable to
Mankind, in Proportion to the Knowledge I had ac∣quired, would be to send me
to the Uni∣versity, that at a proper Time I might take Orders. But my Father,
besides that he was still unwilling to part with me, had probably many
Reasons against my entering the World in a Cassock: Such, 
<PB N="218" REF="230"/> however, was the Deference which he paid to my Tutor,
that he had almost im∣plicitly submitted to his Determination; when a
Relation of my Mother's, who was an Attorney of great Practice in the
<HI>Temple,</HI> came to spend part of the long Vacation at our House, in
consequence of Invitations which had been often repeated during an Absence
of many Years.</P>
<P>MY Father thought that an Opportuni∣ty of consulting how
to dispose of me with a man so well acquainted with Life, was not to be
lost; and perhaps he secretly hoped, that my Preceptor would give up his
Opinion as indefensible, if a Person of the Lawyer's Experience should
declare against it. My Cousin was accordingly made Umpire in the Debate;
and after he had heard the Arguments on both Sides, he declared against my
becoming a Farmer: He said it would be an Act of Injustice to bury my Parts
and Learning in the Ob∣scurity of Rural Life; because, if produ∣ced to the
World, they would probably be rewarded with Wealth and Distinction. My
Preceptor imagined the Question was now finally determined in his Favour; and
being obliged to visit one of his Pari∣shioners that was sick, he gave me
a Look <PB N="219" REF="231"/> of Congratulation as he went out, and I perceived
his Cheek glow with a Flush of Triumph, and his Eye sparkle with Tears of
Delight.</P>
<P>BUT he had no sooner left the Room, than my Cousin
gave the Conversation another Turn: He told my Father, that though he had
opposed his making me a Farmer, he was not an Advocate for my becoming a
Parson; for that, to make a young Fellow a Parson, without being able to
procure him a Living, was to make him a Beggar. He then made some witty
Reflections on the old Gentleman who was just gone out: 
<Q REND="inline">"Nobody <HI>(he said)</HI> could
question his having been put to a bad Trade, who considered his
Circum∣stances now he had followed it forty Years."</Q> And after some
other sprightly Sallies, which, though they made my Fa∣ther laugh, made me
tremble, he clapped him upon the Shoulder, 
<Q REND="inline">"If you have a Mind your Boy should make
a Figure in Life, old Gentleman, <HI>(says he)</HI> put him Clerk to me: My
Lord Chancellor <HI>King</HI> was no better than the Son of a Country Shop
keeper; and my Master gave a Person of much greater Eminence many a
Half-crown, when he was an <PB N="220" REF="232"/> Attorney's Clerk in the next
Chambers to mine. What say you? Shall I take him up with me or no?"</Q> My
Father, who had listened to this Proposal with great Eagerness, as soon
as my Cousin had done speaking, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"A Match;"</Q> and im∣mediately gave him
his Hand in Token of his Consent. Thus the Bargain was struck, and my Fate
determined before my Tutor came back.</P>
<P>IT was in vain that he afterwards ob∣jected to the
Character of my new Ma∣ster, and expressed the most dreadful
Apprehensions at my becoming an Attor∣ney's Clerk, and entering into the
Society of Wretches who had been represented to him, and perhaps not
unjustly, as the most Profligate upon Earth: They do not, in∣deed, become
worse than others, merely as Clerks; but as Persons who, with more Money to
spend in the Gratification of Ap∣petite, are sooner than others abandoned
to their own Conduct: For, though they are taken from under the Protection of a
Parent, yet, being scarce considered as in a State of Servitude, they are
not suffici∣ently restrained by the Authority of a Master.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="233"/> MY Father had conceived of my
Cousin as the best natured Man in the World, and, probably, was intoxicated
with the Romantic Hope of living to see me upon the Bench in
<HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> or of meet∣ing me upon the Circuit, lolling in
my own Coach, and attended by a Crowd of the inferior Instruments of
Justice. He was not therefore to be moved, either by Expostulation or
Intreaty; and I set out with my Cousin on Horseback, to meet the Stage at
a Town within a few Miles, after having taken Leave of my Father, with a
Tenderness that melted us both; and received from the hoary Saint his last
Instructions and Benediction, and at length the parting Embrace, which was
given with the silent Ardour of unutterable Wishes, and repeated with Tears
that could no lon∣ger be suppressed or concealed.</P>
<P>WHEN we were seated in the Coach, my Cousin began to
make himself merry with the Regret and Discontent that he perceived in my
Countenance, at leaving a Cow-house, a Hog-stye, and two old Grey-pates,
who were contending whether I should be buried in a Farm or a College. I, who
had never heard either my Father <PB N="222" REF="234"/> or my Tutor treated
with Irreverence, could not conceal my Displeasure and my Resent∣ment:
But he still continued to rally my Country Simplicity with many Allusions,
which I did not then understand, but which greatly delighted the rest of
the Company. The fourth Day brought us to our Jour∣ney's End; and my Master,
as soon as we reached his Chambers, shook me by the Hand, and bid me
welcome to the <HI>Temple.</HI></P>
<P>HE had been some Years a Widower, and his only Child, a
Daughter, being still at a Boarding-school, his Family consisted only
of a Man and Maid Servant, and my∣self; for, though he had two hired Clerks,
yet they lodged and boarded themselves. The horrid Lewdness and
Profaneness of these Fellows terrified and disgusted me; nor could I
believe that my Master's Pro∣perty and Interest could be safely
intrusted with Men who, in every Respect, appear∣ed to be so destitute
of Virtue and Reli∣gion: I therefore thought it my Duty to apprise him of his
Danger; and accor∣dingly one Day, when we were at Din∣ner, I communicated my
Suspicion, and the Reason upon which it was founded. The formal Solemnity
with which I intro∣duced this Conversation, and the Air of 
<PB N="223" REF="235"/> importance which I gave to my Discovery, threw him
into a violent Fit of Laughter, which struck me dumb with Confusion and
Astonishment. As soon as he recovered himself, he told me, that though
his Clerks might use some Expressions that I had not been accustomed
to hear, yet he believed them to be very honest; and that he placed more
Confidence in them, than he would in a formal Prig, of whom he knew nothing but
that he went every Morning and Evening to Prayers, and said Grace before and
after Meat; that, as to swearing, they meant no Harm; and, as he did not
doubt but that every young Fellow liked a Girl, it was better they should
joke about it than be hypocri∣tical and sly: not that he would be thought to
suspect my Integrity, or to blame me for Practices which he knew to be
merely Effects of the Bigotry and Superstition, in which I had been educated,
and not the Disguises of Cunning, or the Subterfuges of Guilt.</P>
<P>I WAS greatly mortified at my Cousin's Behaviour on this
Occasion, and wondered from what Cause it could proceed, and why he
should so lightly pass over those <PB N="224" REF="236"/> Vices in
others, from which he abstained himself; for I had never heard him swear;
and as his Expressions were not obscene, I imagined his Conversation
was chaste; in which, however, my Ignorance deceived me, and it was not long
before I had Reason to change my Opinion of his Character.</P>
<P>THERE came one Morning to enquire for him at his Chambers,
a Lady, who had something in her Manner which caught my Attention, and
excited my Curiosity: Her Cloaths were fine, but the Manner in which they
were put on, was rather flaunting than elegant; her Address was not easy
nor polite, but seemed to be a strange Mixture of affected State and
li∣centious Familiarity: She looked in the Glass while she was speaking
to me, and without any Confusion adjusted her Tucker; she seemed rather
pleased than disconcerted, at being regarded with Earnestness; and
being told, that my Cousin was abroad, she asked some trifling
Questions, and then making a light Curtsey, took up the Side of her Hoop
with a Jerk, that disco∣vered at least half her Leg, and hurried down
Stairs.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="237"/> I COULD not help enquiring of the
Clerks, if they knew this Lady; and was greatly confounded when they told me,
with an Air of Secrecy, that she was my Cousin's Mistress, whom he had
kept al∣most two Years in Lodgings near <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI> At first I
suspected this Infor∣mation; but it was soon confirmed by so many
Circumstances, that I could no longer doubt of its Truth.</P>
<P>AS my Principles were yet untainted, and the Influence of
my Education was still strong, I regarded my Cousin's Senti∣ments as
impious and detestable; and his Example rather struck me with Horror, than
seduced me to Imitation. I flattered myself with Hopes of effecting his
Refor∣mation, and took every Opportunity to hint the Wickedness of allowed
Inconti∣nence; for which I was always rallied when he was disposed to be
merry, and answered with the contemptuous Sneer of Self-sufficiency, when
he was sullen.</P>
<P>NEAR four Years of my Clerkship were now expired, and I
had never yet entered the Lists as a Disputant with my Cousin: For tho' I
conceived myself to be much <PB N="226" REF="238"/> his Superior in Moral and
Theological Learning; and though he often admitted me to familiar
Conversation, yet I still regarded the Subordination of a Servant to a
Master, as one of the Duties of my Station, and preserved it with such
exact∣ness, that I never exceeded a Question or a Hint, when we were alone,
and was always silent when he had Company; tho' I frequently heard such
Prositions ad∣vanced, as made me wonder that no tre∣mendous Token of the
Divine Displeasure immediately followed: But coming one Night from the
Tavern, warm with Wine, and, as I imagined, flushed with Polemic Success,
he insisted upon my ta∣king one Glass with him before he went to Bed; and
almost as soon as we were seated, he gave me a formal Challenge, by
denying all DIVINE REVELATION, and defying me to prove it.</P>
<P>I NOW considered every Distinction as thrown down, and
stood forth as the Champion of Religion, with that Elation of Mind which the
Hero always feels at the Approach of Danger. I thought my∣self secure of
Victory; and rejoicing that he had now compelled me to do what I had often
wished he would permit, I obliged <PB N="227" REF="239"/> him to declare that
he would dispute upon equal Terms, and we began the Debate. But it was not
long before I was astonished to find myself confounded by a Man, whom I
saw half drunk, and whose Learning and Abilities I despised when he was
sober; for as I had but very lately discovered, that any of the Principles
of Religion, from the Immortality of the Soul to the deepest Mystery, had
been so much as questioned, all his Objections were new. I was
as∣saulted where I had made no Preparation for Defence; and having not been
so much accustomed to Disputation, as to consider, that in the
present Weakness of Human Intellects, it is much easier to object than to
answer, and that in every Disquisition, Difficulties are found which
cannot be re∣solved, I was overborne by the sudden Onset, and in the
Tumult of my Search after Answers to his Cavils, forgot to press the
positive Arguments on which Religion is established: He took Advantage of
my Confusion, proclaimed his own Triumph, and, because I was depressed,
treated me as vanquished.</P>
<P>As the Event which had thus mortified my Pride, was
perpetually revolved in my Mind, the same Mistake still continued: 
<PB N="228" REF="240"/> I enquired for Solutions instead of Proofs, and found
myself more and more en∣tangled in the Snares of Sophistry. In some other
Conversations which my Cousin was now eager to begin, new Difficulties were
started, the Labyrinth of Doubt grew more intricate, and as the Question
was of infinite Moment, my Mind was brought into the most distressful
Anxiety. I ru∣minated incessantly on the Subjects of our Debate,
sometimes chiding myself for my Doubts, and sometimes applauding the
Courage and Freedom of my Enquiry.</P>
<P>WHILE my Mind was in this State, I heard by Accident that
there was a Club at an Alehouse in the Neighbourhood, where such Subjects
were freely debated, to which every Body was admitted with∣out Scruple or
Formality: To this Club in an evil Hour I resolved to go, that I might learn
how knotty Points were to be discussed, and Truth distinguished from
Error.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, on the next Club-Night, I mingled with the
Multitude that was assembled in this School of Folly and Infidelity: I was
at first disgusted at the gross Ignorance of some, and shocked at 
<PB N="229" REF="241"/> the horrid Blasphemy of others; but Cu∣riosity
prevailed, and my Sensibility by Degrees wore off. I found that almost
every Speaker had a different Opinion, which some of them supported by
Argu∣ments, that to me, who was utterly un∣acquainted with Disputation,
appeared to hold opposite Probabilities in exact Equi∣poise; so that,
instead of being confirmed in any Principle, I was divested of all; the
Perplexity of my Mind was increased, and I contracted such a Habit of
question∣ing whatever offered to my Imagination, that I almost doubted of
my own Existence.</P>
<P>IN Proportion as I was less assured in my
Principles, I was less circumspect in my Conduct: But such was still
the Force of Education, that any gross Violence offered to that which I had
held sacred, and every Act which I had been used to regard as incurring the
Forfeiture of the DIVINE FAVOUR, stung me with Re∣morse. I was, indeed,
still restrained from flagitious Immorality, by the Power of Habit: But
this Power grew weaker and weaker, and the natural Propensity to Ill
gradually took Place, as the Motion that is communicated to a Ball which is
struck up into the Air, becomes every <PB N="230" REF="242"/> Moment less
and less, 'till at Length it recoils by its own Weight.</P>
<P>FEAR and Hope, the great Springs of Human Action, had now
lost their princi∣pal Objects, as I doubted whether the Enjoyment of the
present Moment was not all that I could secure; my Power to resist
Temptation diminished with my De∣pendance upon the GRACE OF GOD, and Regard
to the Sanction of his Law; and I was first seduced by a Prostitute, in
my Return from a Declamation on the BEAUTY of Virtue, and the Strength of the
MORAL SENSE.</P>
<P>I BEGAN now to give myself up intirely to Sensuality,
and the Gratification of Ap∣petite terminated my Prospects of Felicity. That
Peace of Mind, which is the Sun∣shine of the Soul, was exchanged for the
Gloom of Doubt, and the Storm of Pas∣sion; and my Confidence in GOD, and
Hope of everlasting Joy, for sudden Ter∣rors and vain Wishes, the
Loathings of Satiety, and the Anguish of Disappoint∣ment.</P>
<P>I WAS, indeed, impatient under this Fluctuation of
Opinion, and therefore I <PB N="231" REF="243"/> applied to a Gentleman, who was
a prin∣cipal Speaker at the Club, and deemed a profound Philosopher, to
assist the Labours of my own Mind in the Investigation of Truth, and
relieve me from Distraction by removing my Doubts: But this Gen∣tleman,
instead of administring Relief, la∣mented the Prejudice of Education, which
he said hindered me from yielding without Reserve to the Force of Truth,
and might perhaps always keep my mind anxious, though my Judgment should be
convinced. But as the most effectual Remedy for this deplorable Evil, he
recommended to me the Works of CHUBB, MORGAN, and many others, which I procured
and read with great Eagerness; and though I was not at last a sound
Deist, yet I perceived with some Pleasure, that my Stock of Polemic
Knowledge was greatly increased; so that, instead of being an Auditor, I
commenced a Speaker at the Club: And though to stand up and babble to a Crowd
at an Alehouse, 'till Silence is commanded by the Stroke of a Hammer, is as
low an Ambition as can taint the human Mind; yet I was much elevated by my new
Di∣stinction, and pleased with the Deference that was paid to my Judgment.
I some∣times, indeed, reflected, that I was pro∣pagating 
<PB N="232" REF="244"/> Opinions, by which I had myself become vicious and
wretched: But it im∣mediately occurred, that though my Con∣duct was changed, it
could not be proved that my Virtue was less, because many Things which I
avoided as vicious upon my old Principles, were innocent upon my new. I
therefore went on in my Ca∣reer, and was perpetually racking my In∣vention for
new Topics and Illustrations; and among other Expedients, as well to advance
my reputation, as to quiet my Conscience, and deliver me from the Torment of
Remorse, I thought of the following.</P>
<P>HAVING learned that all Error is inno∣cent, because it
is involuntary, I concluded that nothing more was necessary to quiet the
Mind, than to prove that all Vice was Error: I therefore formed the follow∣ing
Argument: 
<Q REND="inline">"No Man becomes vi∣cious, but from a
Belief that Vice will confer Happiness: He may, indeed, have been told the
contrary; but im∣plicit Faith is not required of reasonable Beings:
Therefore, as every Man ought to seek Happiness, every Man may law∣fully
make the Experiment: If he is disappointed, it is plain that he did not 
<PB N="233" REF="245"/> intend that which has happened; so that every Vice is
an Error, and there∣fore no Vice will be punished."</Q></P>
<P>I COMMUNICATED this ingenious Con∣trivance to my Friend
the Philosopher, who, instead of detecting the Difference between Ignorance
and Perverseness, or stating the Limitations within which we are bound to
seek our own Happiness, applauded the Acuteness of my Penetra∣tion, and
the Force of my Reasoning. I was impatient to display so novel and
im∣portant a Discovery to the Club, and the Attention that it drew upon me,
gratified my Ambition to the utmost of my Ex∣pectation. I had, indeed, some
Oppo∣nents; but they were so little skilled in Argumentation, and so
ignorant of the Subject, that it only rendered my Conquest more signal and
important; for the Chair∣man summed up the Arguments on both Sides, with so
exact and scrupulous an Impartiality, that as I appeared not to have been
confuted, those who could not discover the Weakness of my Antagonists,
thought that to confute me was impossible; my Sophistry was taken for
Demonstration, and the Number of Proselytes was incredi∣ble. The
Assembly consisted chiefly of <PB N="234" REF="246"/> Clerks and
Apprentices, young Persons who had received a religious, though not a liberal
Education; for those who were totally ignorant, or wholly abandoned, troubled
not themselves with such Dispu∣tations as were carried on at our Club:
And these unhappy Boys, the Impetuosity of whose Passions was
restrained chiefly by Fear, as Virtue had not yet become a Habit, were glad
to have the Shackles struck off, which they were told Priestcraft had put
on.</P>
<P>BUT however I might satisfy others, I was not yet
satisfied myself; my Torment returned, and new Opiates became
neces∣sary: They were not, indeed, easily to be found; but such was my
good Fortune, that an illiterate Mechanic afforded me a most seasonable
Relief, 
<Q REND="inline">"by discussing the important
Question, and demonstrating that the Soul was not, nor could be
immortal."</Q> I was, indeed, disposed to believe without the severest
Scrutiny, what I now began secretly to wish; for such was the State of my
Mind, that I was willing to give up the Hope of ever∣lasting Happiness, to
be delivered from the Dread of perpetual Misery; and as I thought of dying as
a remote Event, the <PB N="235" REF="247"/> Apprehension of losing my
Existence with my Life, did not much interrupt the Plea∣sures of the Bagnio
and the Tavern.</P>
<P>THEY were, however, interrupted by another Cause; for I
contracted a Distem∣per, which alarmed and terrified me, in Proportion as its
Progress was swift, and its Consequences were dreadful. In this
Distress, I applied to a young Surgeon, who was a Speaker at the Club, and
gained a genteel Subsistence by keeping it in Repair: He treated my
Complaint as a Trifle; and to prevent any serious Re∣flections in this
Interval of Pain and Soli∣tude, he rallied the deplorable Length of my
Countenance, and exhorted me to behave like a Man.</P>
<P>MY Pride, rather than my Fear, made me very solicitous
to conceal this Disorder from my Cousin; but he soon discovered it
rather with Pleasure than Anger, as it compleated his Triumph, and afforded
him a new Subject of Raillery and Merri∣ment. By the Spiritual and Corporeal
Assistance of my Surgeon, I was at Length restored to my Health, with
the same dissolute Morals, and a Resolution to pur∣sue 
<PB N="236" REF="248"/> my pleasures with more Caution: In∣stead, therefore,
of hiring a Prostitute, I now endeavoured to seduce the Virgin, and corrupt
the Wife.</P>
<P>IN these Attempts my new Principles afforded me great
Assistance: For I found that those whom I could convert, I could
easily debauch; and that to convert many, nothing more was necessary than
to advance my Principles, and allege something in Defence of them, by which I
appeared to be convinced myself; for not being able to dispute, they
thought that the Argument which had convinced me, would, if they could
understand it, convince them: So that, by yielding an implicit Assent,
they at once paid a Compliment to their own Judgment, and smoothed the Way to
the Indulgence of Appetite.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus gratifying every in∣ordinate Desire,
and passing from one De∣gree of Guilt to another, my Cousin de∣termined
to take his Daughter, who was now in her nineteenth Year, from School; and as
he intended to make her Mistress of his Family, he quitted his Chambers,
and took a House.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="249"/> THIS young Lady I had frequently
seen, and always admired; she was therefore no sooner come home, than I
endeavoured to recommend myself by a thousand Assidui∣ties, and
rejoiced in the many Opportuni∣ties that were afforded me to entertain her
alone, and perceived that she was not displeased with my Company, nor
insensi∣ble to my Complaisance.</P>
<P>MY Cousin, though he had seen the Effects of his
Documents of Infidelity in the Corruption of my Morals, yet could not forbear
to sneer at Religion in the Presence of his Daughter; a Practice in which I
now always concurred, as it faci∣litated the Execution of a Design that I had
formed of rendering her subservient to my Pleasures. I might, indeed,
have married her, and, perhaps, my Cousin secretly intended that I
should: But I knew Women too well to think that Marriage would confine my
Wishes to a single Object; and I was utterly averse to a State in which
the Pleasure of Variety must be sacrificed to domestic Quiet, or
domestic Quiet to the Pleasure of Variety; for I neither imagined that I
could long in∣dulge myself in an unlawful Familiarity <PB N="238" REF="250"/>
with many Women, before it would by some Accident be discovered to my Wife;
nor that she would be so very courteous or philosophical, as to suffer
this Indulgence without Expostulation and Clamour; and besides, I had no
Liking to a Brood of Children, whose Wants would soon be∣come importunate,
and whose Claim to my Industry and Frugality, would be uni∣versally
acknowledged; though the Off∣spring of a Mistress might be abandoned to
Beggary, without Breach of the Law, or Offence to Society.</P>
<P>THE young Lady, on the contrary, as she perceived that
my Addresses exceeded common Civilities, did not question but that my
View was to obtain her for a Wife; and I could discern that she often
expected such a Declaration, and seemed disappoin∣ted that I had not yet
proposed an Appli∣cation to her Father: But imagining, I suppose, that
these Circumstances were only delayed 'till the fittest Opportunity,
she did not scruple to admit all the Free∣doms that were consistent
with Modesty; and I drew every Day nearer to the Ac∣complishment of my
Design by insensible Approaches, without alarming her Fear, or confirming
her Hopes.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="251"/> I KNEW that only two Things were
necessary; her Passions were to be inflam'd, and the Motives from which
they were to be suppressed, removed. I was there∣fore perpetually
insinuating, that nothing which was natural, could be ill; I com∣plained of
the Impositions and Restraints of Priestcraft and Superstition; and, as
if these Hints were casual and accidental, I would immediately afterwards
sing a ten∣der Song, repeat some seducing Verses, or read a Novel.</P>
<P>BUT, henceforward, let never insulted Beauty admit a
second Time into her Pre∣sence the Wretch, who has once attemp∣ted to
ridicule Religion, and substitute other Aids to human Frailty, for that 
<Q REND="inline">"Love of GOD which is better than
Life,"</Q> and that Fear 
<Q REND="inline">"which is the Beginning of Wisdom:"</Q>
For whoever makes such an Attempt, intends to betray; the contrary Conduct
being without Que∣stion the Interest of every one whose Inten∣tions are
good, because even those who profanely deny Religion to be of DIVINE
Origin, do yet acknowledge that it is a Political Institution, well
calculated to strengthen the Band of Society, and to <PB N="240" REF="252"/>
keep out the Ravager, by intrenching In∣nocence and arming Virtue. To oppose
these Corrupters by Argument rather than Contempt, is to parley with a
Murderer, who may be excluded by shutting a Door.</P>
<P>MY Cousin's Daughter used frequently to dispute with
me, and these Disputes always favoured the Execution of my Pro∣ject:
Though, lest I should alarm her too much, I often affected to appear half
in Jest; and when I ventured to take any Liberty, by which the Bounds of
Mo∣desty were somewhat invaded, I suddenly desisted with an Air of
easy Negligence; and as the Attempt was not pursued, and nothing farther
seemed to be intended than was done, it was regarded but as Wag∣gery, and
punished only with a Slap or a Frown. Thus she became familiar with
Infidelity and Indecency by Degrees.</P>
<P>I ONCE subtily engaged her in a Debate, whether the
Gratification of natural Ap∣petites was in itself innocent, and whether, if
so, the Want of external Ceremony could in any Case render it criminal. I
insisted that Virtue and Vice were not influenced by external Ceremonies,
nor founded upon human Laws, which were <PB N="241" REF="253"/> arbitrary,
temporary, and local: And that as a young Lady's shutting herself up in a
Nunnery, was still evil, though en∣joined by such Laws; so the
transmitting her Beauty to Posterity was still good, though under certain
Circumstances it had by such Laws been forbidden. This she affected
utterly to deny, and I proposed that the Question should be referred to
her Papa, without informing him of our De∣bate, and that it should be
determined by his Opinion; a Proposal to which she readily agreed. I
immediately adverted to other Subjects, as if I had no Interest in the
Issue of the Debate; but I could per∣ceive that it sunk deeply into her
Mind, and that she continued more thoughtful than usual.</P>
<P>I DID not fail, however, to introduce a suitable Topic
of Discourse the next Time my Cousin was present, and having stated
the Question in general Terms, he gave it in my Favour, without
suspecting that he was Judge in his own Cause; and the next Time I was
alone with his Daughter, without mentioning his Deci∣sion, I renewed my
Familiarity; I found her Resistance less resolute, pursued my
Advantage, and compleated her Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="254"/> WITHIN a few Months she perceived
that she was with Child; a Circumstance that she communicated to me with
Expres∣sions of the most piercing Distress: But instead of
consenting to marry her, to which she had often urged me with all the
little Arts of Persuasion that she could practice, I made Light of the
Affair, chid her for being so much alarmed for so trivial an Accident, and
proposed a Medicine which I told her would effectually prevent the
Discovery of our Intercourse, by de∣stroying the Effect of it before it
could appear. At this Proposition she fainted, and when she recovered,
opposed it with Terror and Regret, with Tears, Trem∣bling and Intreaty: But I
continued in∣flexible, and at Length either removed or over-ruled her Scruples,
by the same Argu∣ments that had first seduced her to Guilt.</P>
<P>THE long Vacation was now commen∣ced, and my Clerkship
was just expired: I therefore proposed to my Cousin, that we should all
make a Visit to my Father, hoping that the Fatigue of the Journey would
favour my Purpose, by increasing the Effect of the Medicine, and
account∣ing for an Indisposition which it might be supposed to
cause.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="255"/> THE Plan being thus concerted, and
my Cousin's Concurrence being obtained, it was immediately put in Execution.
I applied to my old Friend the Club Surgeon, to whom I made no Secret of such
Affairs, and he immediately furnished me with Medicaments, which he
assured me would answer my Purpose; but either by a Mi∣stake in the
Preparation, or in the Quan∣tity, they produced a Disorder, which, soon
after the dear injured unhappy Girl arrived at her Journey's End, terminated in
her Death.</P>
<P>MY Confusion and Remorse at this Event, are not to be
expressed: but Con∣fusion and Remorse were suddenly changed into
Astonishment and Terror; for she was scarce dead before I was taken
into Custody, upon Suspicion of Murder. Her Father had deposed, that
just before she died, she desired to speak with him in pri∣vate; and
that then, taking his Hand, and intreating his Forgiveness, she told him
that she was with Child by me, and that I had poisoned her, under Pretence
of preserving her Reputation.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="256"/> WHETHER she made this
Declaration, or only confessed the Truth, and her Fa∣ther, to revenge the
Injury, had forged the rest, cannot now be known; but the Coroner having been
summoned, the Body viewed, and found to have been pregnant, with many Marks
of a violent and un∣common Disorder, a Verdict of Wilful Murder was brought
in against me, and I was committed to the County Gaol.</P>
<P>AS the Judges were then upon the Circuit, I was within
less than a Fort∣night convicted and condemned by the Zeal of the Jury,
whose Passions had been so greatly inflamed by the Enormity of the
Crime with which I had been charged, that they were rather willing that I
should suffer being innocent, than that I should escape being guilty;
but it appearing to the Judge, in the Course of the Trial, that Murder was
not intended, he reprieved me before he left the Town.</P>
<P>I MIGHT now have redeemed the Time, and, awakened to a
Sense of my Folly and my Guilt, might have made some Repara∣tion to Mankind
for the Injury which I had <PB N="245" REF="257"/> done to Society; and
endeavoured to re∣kindle some Spark of Hope in my own Breast, by Repentance
and Devotion. But, alas! in the first Transports of my Mind, upon so
sudden and unexpected a Calamity, the Fear of Death yielded to the Fear of
Infamy, and I swallowed Poison: The Excess of my Desperation hindered
its immediate Effect; for, as I took too much, great Part of it was thrown up,
and only such a Quantity re∣mained behind, as was sufficient to insure my
Destruction, and yet leave me Time to contemplate the Horrors of the Gulph
into which I am sinking.</P>
<P>IN this deplorable Situation I have been visited by the
Surgeon, who was the im∣mediate Instrument of my Misfortune, and the
Philosopher who directed my Stu∣dies: But these are Friends who only rouze
me to keener Sensibility, and inflict upon me more exquisite Torment. They
reproach me with Folly, and upbraid me with Cowardice; they tell me too, that
the Fear of Death has made me regret the Errors of Superstition; but what
would I now give for those erroneous Hopes, and that credulous Simplicity,
which, though I have been taught to despise them, would 
<PB N="246" REF="258"/> sustain me in the tremendous Hour that approaches,
and avert from my last Agony the Horrors of Despair.</P>
<P>I HAVE, indeed, a Visiter of another Kind, the good old
Man who first taught me to frame a Prayer, and first animated me with the
Hope of Heaven; but he can only lament with me, that this Hope will not return,
and that I can pray with Confidence no more: He cannot, by a sudden Miracle,
re-establish the Principles which I have subverted. My Mind is all Doubt,
and Terror, and Confusion; I know nothing but that I have rendered
in∣effectual the Clemency of my JUDGE, that the Approach of Death is swift
and inevitable, and that either the Shades of Everlasting Night, or the
Gleams of un∣quenchable Fire are at Hand. My Soul, in vain, shrinks
backwards: I grow giddy with the Thought: The next Moment is Distraction!
Farewell.</P>
