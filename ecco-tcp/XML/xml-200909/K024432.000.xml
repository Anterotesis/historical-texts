<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>GUATIMOZINO, the last emperour of MEXICO, having op∣posed the SPANIARDS with great bravery, in various en∣gagements, was at length defeated and taken prisoner. In order to extort from him a discovery of the principal mines, he was laid on burning coals: The second in command was also condemn'd to the same torture, and amidst his sufferings called upon his royal master to be released from the vow of secrecy, which drew from GUATIMOZINO these memo∣rable words: <HI>Am I on a Bed of Roses?</HI></P>
<P>DRYDEN has put these words into the mouth of MONTEZU∣MA contrary to the testimony of the historians.</P>

<L>THE Sun now glitter'd in the front of day,</L>

<L>Whom for his valour tried and virtue known,<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>

<LG>
<L>Now, thro' th' applauding clamour of the throng,</L>
<L>Th' august procession slowly mov'd along,</L>

<L>(Inwrought with plumage of celestial blue)</L>
<L>Mark'd from the summit of a lofty tow'r,</L>

<L>Which posting on the rapid wings of sight,</L>

<L>Behold the solemn slow-advancing train <MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Approach the precincts of the sacred fane;</L>
<L>A venerable, rude, majestic pile,</L>

<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>But chiefly GUATIMOZINO confess'd</L>
<L>The hero's feelings lab'ring in his breast:<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>There youthful Valour wak'd his ardent flame,</L>
<L>There breath'd contempt of death and love of fame,</L>
<L>There Intrepidity that scorns to stoop,</L>
<L>And soft-ey'd Clemency—enchanting group!</L>
<L>O'er these as Fancy stretch'd her brooding wing,<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>Prescient she saw, from this assortment, spring</L>
<L>Some great, she knew not what, excelling deed,</L>

<L>Ev'n thus the bard who sleeps near Avon's wave,</L>

THE VENETIAN MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE western sun's expiring ray▪</L>
<L>To VENICE gave a milder day;</L>
<L>Till by degrees the ling'ring light</L>
<L>Hung trembling on the verge of night.</L>
<L>CAMILLA then, with fearful soul,</L>
<L>To th' Adriatic margin stole,</L>
<L>Where in a bark, at Love's command,</L>
<L>PLACENTIO took his faithful stand.</L>
<L>Possessing now his future bride,</L>
<L>He bade the bark securely glide,</L>
<L>Which far unlike that gally show'd</L>
<L>That down the silver Cydnus row'd,</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="54"/>Beneath whose purple sails were seen,</L>
<L>Proud Ostentation's gaudy Queen,</L>
<L>Who sure of conquest, vain of mind,</L>
<L>All languishingly lay reclined!</L>
<L>Here Beauty undefil'd by art,</L>
<L>Whose bosom own'd a tender heart,</L>
<L>Beneath the sails from home remov'd,</L>
<L>And trusted to the man she lov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A vernal calmness lull'd the deep,</L>
<L>And hush'd each wavy surge to sleep:</L>
<L>The air along the sultry day,</L>
<L>Scorch'd by the Summer's fervent ray,</L>
<L>Was freshen'd by a recent show'r,</L>
<L>While Silence solemniz'd the hour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The still solemnity impress'd</L>
<L>With awful thought's CAMILLA'S breast,</L>
<L>For now by prompting Love impell'd,</L>
<L>Now by Timidity witheld,</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="55"/>The words which to pronounce she tried,</L>
<L>Recoil'd, and unaccented died.</L>
<L>PLACENTO too alike subdued,</L>
<L>They sail'd along in silent mood,</L>
<L>And stillness reign'd from shore to shore,</L>
<L>Unbroke— but by the dashing oar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length the fair dissolv'd the charm—</L>
<L>"Ah, wonder not I feel alarm!</L>
<L>"Confiding in thy love I came,</L>
<L>"And risk'd for thee my virgin fame:</L>
<L>"Ah tell me to what place we sail,</L>
<L>"For in my bosom fears prevail:</L>
<L>"Yet answer not this idle fear,</L>
<L>"Where'er thou art bright honour's there."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The plan I form, the youth replied,</L>
<L>"To Innocence is close allied,</L>
<L>"And fearful of thy virgin fame</L>
<L>"As of her babe the tender dame.</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="56"/>"These waves that wander to the sea,</L>
<L>"Wash in their pilgrimage a tree,</L>

<L>"There, in a shade compos'd of reeds,</L>
<L>"An aged hermit tells his beads:</L>

<L>"In wedlock's unremitting bands.</L>
<L>"Then to VALCLUSA we'll repair▪</L>
<L>"Where LAURA'S soul informs the air:</L>

<LG>
<L>"As when chill Winter quits the land,</L>

<LG>
<L>"Ye walls where first I drew the air,</L>

<L>Its sensibility unfolds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See now they reach the sacred cell</L>
<L>Where Wisdom, Peace, and Virtue dwell:</L>
<L>There, bent beneath the weight of age,</L>
<L>They find prepar'd th' expecting sage</L>
<L>He hail'd them in a friendly tone,</L>
<L>And bade them call his cell their own:</L>
<L>Where rose an altar form'd of moss,</L>
<L>Crown'd with a simple wooden cross!</L>
<L>There too a taper, mildly bright,</L>
<L>Supplied a pompous glare of light▪</L>
<L>No holy relick rich-enchas'd</L>
<L>This unambitious altar grac'd:</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="59"/>Here Flora, Nature's priestess, stood,</L>
<L>And round her fragrant off'rings strew'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The hermit spoke—"Hail, virtuous pair,</L>
<L>"May your misfortunes perish here:</L>
<L>"Tho' youth be yours, yet well I know</L>
<L>"You've tasted deep of human woe!</L>
<L>"Control, and art, and baseness join'd,</L>
<L>"To cancel what your hearts design'd:</L>
<L>"But now Misfortune's reign is o'er,</L>
<L>"And Pleasure opens all her store."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He paus'd—and now the youthful pair</L>
<L>Th' irrevocable vow prefer:</L>
<L>And now the hermit clos'd their hands</L>
<L>In willing and unvenal bands,</L>
<L>Unspotted bands! which mutual Love,</L>
<L>And Confidence and Virtue wove.</L>
