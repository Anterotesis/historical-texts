<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The following sheets are printed for the benefit of Mr.
Psalmanazar's executrix; who thought it right to prefix his LAST WILL AND
TESTAMENT, as the best introduction to them. Mr. Psalmanazar's first
intimation of giving this public ac∣count of himself, may be found under the
article Formosa, in the COMPLETE SYSTEM OF GEOGRAPHY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 251. This work was published in 1747.</NOTE>, in
which he assisted as a writer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mem. p.
339.</NOTE>. Where he was born, and who were his parents, do not yet appear for
certain; even in these posthumous memoirs he has endeavoured to keep them
inviolable secrets. From circumstances however there is little reason to
doubt, but that he was a native of France: indeed he spoke the French
lan∣guage so well, beyond what is usual when attained by grammar or travel
only, that we do not question to say, He was a French∣man. His
pronunciation had a spice of the Gascoin accent, and in that provincial 
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/> dialect he was so masterly, that none but those born
in the country could equal, none though born there could excel him: for
notwithstanding it may be esteemed but a <HI>patois,</HI> or jargon, yet
foreigners find it imprac∣ticable to be spoken with propriety, and with that
fluency and vivacity peculiar to those people: and from this we presume,
that some part of Languedoc may lay claim to his birth. The reverend Mr.
Villette, who was intimately acquainted with him for upwards of four and twenty
years, (and had many opportunities to observe him, and to know him well) has
communicated these conjectures, which the judicious reader, perhaps, will
see sufficiently confirmed from several passages in the memoirs
themselves.</P>

<HEAD>THE LAST WILL AND TESTA∣MENT OF ME A POOR SINFUL AND WORTHLESS
CREATURE COMMONLY KNOWN BY THE ASSUMED NAME OF GEORGE PSALMANAZAR</HEAD>
<P>Thy ever blessed and unerring Will, Oh most gracious, though
offended God! be done by me and all the world, whether for life or death.</P>
<P>Into thy all-merciful hands I commit my soul, as unto a most
gracious Father, who, though justly provoked by my past vain, and wicked
life, but more especially so during the youthful sallies of a rash and
unthinking part of it, has yet been gra∣ciously pleased, by thy
undeserved grace and mercy, to preserve me from the reign∣ing errors and
heresies, and the more de∣plorable apostacy and infidelity of the
pre∣sent age, and enabled me to take a constant <PB N="2" REF="6"/> and
stedfast hold on the only author of our salvation, thy ever adorable and
divine Son Jesus Christ, our powerful and meritorious Redeemer, from
whose alone, and all-powerful intercession and merits (and not from any
the least inherent righteousness of my own, which I heartily abhor as
filthy rags in thine all purer eyes) I hope and beg for pardon and
reconciliation, and for a happy resurrection unto that blessed
im∣mortality to which we are redeemed by his most precious and inestimable
blood. I likewise bless and adore thy infinite good∣ness for preserving
me from innumerable dangers of body and soul, to which this wretched life,
but more particularly by my own youthful rashness and inconsideration,
might have exposed me, had not thy Di∣vine Providence interposed in such
a won∣derful manner, as justly challenges my deepest admiration and
acknowledgment: particularly I am bound to bless thee for so timely nipping
that ambition and vain∣glory, which had hurried me through such scenes of
impiety and hypocrisy, and as the most effectual antidote against it,
next to thy divine grace, hast brought me not only <PB N="3" REF="7"/> to
prefer, but to delight in a state of ob∣scurity and lowness of
circumstances, as the surest harbour of peace and safety; by which,
though the little I have left in my possession be dwindled to so
little value as to be but a poor acknowledgment for the services which I have
received from my friend hereafter named, to whom I can do no less than
bequeath it all, yet I hope the will may be accepted for the deed, and that the
Divine Providence will supply to her what is wanting in me. And now, O
Fa∣ther of Mercies, I beseech thee for thy dear Son's sake, so to direct
me by thy grace through all the future concerns of this life, that when, where,
or in what manner so∣ever it shall please thee to call me out of it, I
may be found ready and willing to re∣turn my soul, worthless as it is of
itself, to thee who gavest it; and my death, as well as my latter end, may
be such as may tend all possible ways to thy glory, the edification of
thy church, and my own eternal com∣fort. And in hopes there is nothing in this
my last will that is not agreeable to thine, I leave it to be executed after
my death by my worthy and pious friend Sarah Re∣walling, <PB N="4" REF="8"/> of
this parish of St. Luke, in Mid∣dlesex, in the manner hereafter mentioned,
viz.</P>
<P>I desire that my body, when or where∣ever I die, may be kept
so long above ground, as decency or conveniency will permit, and afterwards
conveyed to the common burying-ground, and there in∣terred in some obscure
corner of it, with∣out any further ceremony or formality than is used to the
bodies of the deceased pen∣sioners where I happen to die, and about the
same time of the day, and that the whole may be performed in the lowest and
cheapest manner. And it is my ear∣nest request, that my body be not
in∣closed in any kind of coffin, but only de∣cently laid in what is called a
shell of the lowest value, and without lid or other co∣vering which may
hinder the natural earth from covering it all around.</P>
<P>The books relating to the Universal Hi∣story, and belonging to
the Proprietors, are to be returned to them according to the true list of
them, which will be found in a blue paper in my account book. All the rest
being my own property, together with <PB N="5" REF="9"/> all my houshold
goods, wearing apparel, and whatever money shall be found due to me after my
decease, I give and bequeath to my friend Sarah Rewalling above named,
together with such manuscripts as I had written at different times, and
designed to be made public, if they shall be deemed worthy of it, they
consisting of sundry es∣says on some difficult parts of the Old
Testament, and chiefly written for the use of a young Clergyman in the
country, and so unhappily acquainted with that kind of learning, that he was
likely to become the but of his sceptical parishioners, but being, by this
means, furnished with proper ma∣terials, was enabled to turn the tables upon
them.</P>
<P>But the principal manuscript I thought my∣self in duty bound
to leave behind, is a faithful narrative of my education, and the sallies of
my wretched youthful years, and the various ways by which I was in some
measure unavoidably led into the base and shameful imposture of
passing upon the world for a native of Formosa, and a con∣vert to
Christianity, and backing it with a fictitious account of that island, and
of my <PB N="6" REF="10"/> own travels, conversion, &amp;c. all or most of
it hatched in my own brain, without re∣gard to truth and honesty. It is true,
I have long since disclaimed even publicly all but the shame and guilt of
that vile im∣position, yet as long as I knew there were still two editions
of that scandalous romance remaining in England, besides the several
versions it had abroad, I thought it incum∣bent upon me to undeceive the
world, by unravelling that whole mystery of iniquity in a posthumous work,
which would be less liable to suspicion, as the author would be far out
of the influence of any sinister motives that might induce him to deviate
from the truth. All that I shall add con∣cerning it is, that it was began
above twenty-five years ago with that view, and no other, during a long
recess in the country, ac∣companied with a threatening disease, and
since then continued in my most serious hours, as any thing new
presented itself; so that it hath little else to recommend it∣self
but its plainness and sincerity, except here and there some useful
observations and innuendoes on those branches of learning in which I had
been concerned, and particu∣larly <PB N="7" REF="11"/> with such excellent
improvements as might be made in the method of learning of Hebrew, and in the
producing a more perfect body of Universal History, and more answerable
to its title than that which hath already passed a second edition. And
these, I thought, might be more deserving a place in that narrative, as the
usefulness of them would in a great measure make amends for the small
charge of the whole. If it therefore shall be judged worth printing, I
desire it may be sold to the highest bidder, in order to pay my arrears
for my lodgings, and to defray my funeral; and I further re∣quest that it be
printed in the plain and undisguised manner in which I have writ∣ten it,
and without alteration or embellish∣ment. I hope the whole is written in the
true, sincere spirit of a person awakened by a miracle of mercy, unto a
deep sense of his folly, guilt, and danger, and is desirous, above all
things, to give God the whole glory of so gracious a change, and to shew
the various steps by which his Divine Provi∣dence brought it about. The whole
of the ac∣count contains fourteen pages of Preface, and <PB N="8" REF="12"/>
about ninety-three more of the said relation, written in my own hand with a
proper title, and will be found in the deep drawer on the right hand of my
white cabinet. How∣ever, if the obscurity I have lived in, dur∣ing such a
series of years, should make it needless to revive a thing in all
likeli∣hood so long since forgot, I cannot but wish, that so much of it
was published in some weekly paper, as might inform the world, especially
those who have still by them the above-mentioned fabulous account of the
Island of Formosa, &amp;c. that I have long since owned both in
conversation and in print, that it was no other than a mere forgery of my own
devising, a scandalous imposition on the puclic, and such, as I think
myself bound to beg God and the world pardon for writing, and have been long
since, as I am to this day, and shall be as long as I live, heartily
sorry for, and ashamed of.</P>
<P>These I do hereby solemnly declare and testify to be my
last Will and Testament; and in witness thereof have thereto set my
name, on the 23d day of April, in the <PB N="9" REF="13" MS="y"/> year of our
Lord 1752, O. S. and in the 73d year of my age.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>As the design of my leaving the follow∣ing Memoirs, is at once
to undeceive the world with respect to that vile and ro∣mantic account I
formerly gave of myself, and of the island of Formosa, and to make all
the amends in my power for that shame∣ful imposition on the public, by
leaving behind me this faithful narrative of my∣self, and of the remarkable
accidents of my wretched life that led me to it, as well as of those that
deterred me from persisting in it; it will not be improper here to
pre∣mise some of the chief motives that deter∣mined me to write the
following sheets, to be printed after my death.</P>
<P>The religious education I had happily re∣ceived during my tender
years, had made so strong an impression upon my mind, that, though it
did not prove sufficient to preserve me from being unwarily and gra∣dually
hurried, by my own strong passion, <PB N="12" REF="15"/> into that
scandalous piece of forgery; yet it never failed of making me condemn
myself, in my more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, for every
step I took towards it; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
particu∣larly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the last and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 
<PB N="13" REF="16"/> care and concern for me into the justest abhorrence
and detestation of me.</P>
<P>Under these pungent reflections, which were, however, but too
often smothered by various carnal considerations, and the violent hurry of
my passions, I was not without some hopes that the same divine
goodness, which had not suffered me to harden into an utter
insensibility of my guilt, might, in his own good time, enable me to
surmount all the dreadful difficulties which my carnal mind laid in my way,
and finish that good work which my re∣morse gave me cause to hope was
begun by his undeserved grace in me. I was not, however, without some
apprehensions from a sense of my extreme guilt, lest that, which I
cherished under the notion of hope, should prove only a vain and
ill-grounded pre∣sumption, at least I began to fear I had reason to think
it so, whilst I continued inactive, and depended merely on a few faint
wishes and prayers, instead of mak∣ing some strong resolutions and
efforts, which might assure me of the divine grace co-operating with
them.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17"/>In this fluctuating and wretched uncer∣tainty
I continued some years, not knowing which way to begin or go about the
ar∣duous and dreaded task, when a grievous and lingering fit of illness
did, in some measure, hurry me to it, and made me determine immediately to
set pen to paper, and employ all the time my distemper would allow me, to
undo as much as was in my power all the mischief I had done, by leaving
behind me a faithful account of every thing I could recollect, and that had
been instrumental to so fatal and long a train of miscarriages, in order
to set the whole imposture in so true a light, that no part of the
shame may fall on the guiltless, but on the guilty; and that is chiefly on
my∣self.</P>
<P>I set about it accordingly, and if I did not begin so
necessary and laudable a work, till driven as it were to it by pain and
sick∣ness, by the fear of death, and of the divine displeasure, I hope
it will be so far from lessening the credit of the following narra∣tive,
that it will rather add weight to it, seeing no time or circumstances can
be <PB N="15" REF="18"/> more apt to inspire a man with the deepest
seriousness and sincerity, than those I was in, when I wrote the
most considerable and mortifying part of it.</P>
<P>I shall therefore only add, that my di∣stemper was a lingering
every-other-day ague, which lasted me about six weeks, and that being then
in a sweet place of re∣tirement in the country, at a very good friend's
house, and taken sufficient care of in all other respects, I had all the
time and opportunity I could wish for, joined with the properest
disposition of mind for such a task, so that through God's
blessing I was enabled to bring down the shameful ac∣count of my former
unfortunate life through the most shocking and impious scenes of it, to
my arrival into England without any in∣terruption, and I hope in God with that
sincerity and seriousness as such a relation could require, and my
bad state of health could inspire me with, still taking care be∣fore all
things to implore the divine assistance of the great searcher of all
hearts every time I sat down to write, that he would direct me to go through
the arduous task with <PB N="16" REF="19"/> such a due regard to truth,
whatever shame reflected on me, as might in all respects re∣dound to his
glory, and entitle me to his pardon and mercy; and to him I give all the
praise, for having enabled me not only to go on so far with the wished
for work during my retreat there, but to resume it since at proper times,
till I had brought it to the desired conclusion.</P>
<P>For being, soon after my recovery, obliged to return to London,
and engaged in a work, which necessarily took up too much of my time and
thoughts, to permit me to go on with this, in the same regular manner I had
done in the country (though still resolved by God's assistance to go
through with it) I determined to set apart an hour at least every
Wednesday and Friday to revise what I had wrote, and to continue the
narrative as my memory served; not doubting but the solemnity of the
fast, joined to the prayers and other meditations I had appropriated for
these two days, in the method of de∣votion I was through God's blessing
entered into, would prove effectual means to ob∣tain that spirit of
sincerity and seriousness <PB N="17" REF="20"/> which I earnestly
wished might go through the remainder, as I was conscious it had done in
the former part, whilst I laboured under my illness.</P>
<P>I went on accordingly for some time with it, till the other
business I had in hand, and some other avocations, as well as sometimes
an indisposition of the mind, unhinged me from my method oftener than I
wished; for at such times I found myself so unfit to pursue it, that
I plainly saw it was better to discontinue it till I could recover my
for∣mer frame. This occasioned sometimes an intermission of two or more
weeks as to the writing part, though the matter was still so pressing
on my mind, that it only gave me an opportunity, either of recol∣lecting some
things I had omitted, or of gathering fresh materials for the sequel.</P>
<P>But as my aim was only to give an ac∣count of what either chiefly
hurried me on through such a long train of the most un∣accountable follies
and vanities, or of what brought me to a sense and abhorrence of them, I
have omitted a great number of the former, as rather apt to disgust than
entertain or inform a sober reader, and <PB N="18" REF="21"/> confined
myself to the latter, as the more likely to prove instructive and useful
to him. And I shall not be very solicitous what judgment those will
pass on this nar∣rative, who are strangers to religion and the various ways
of the Divine Providence in reclaiming sinners, first by driving, and then
drawing them to himself, provided I can acquit myself to my own
conscience that I have taken all possible care to write it with that
sincerity and faithfulness that I would wish it to be done at my last
moments, and with no other view than that of mak∣ing such a full and ample
acknowledgment of my great folly and guilt, as my con∣science told me I ought
to do for having so long and so shamefully imposed upon the world, as
well as of God's singular good∣ness which inspired me with the design,
and hath enabled me to go through it in the manner I have done.</P>
<P>The reasons of my not chusing to have it published during my
life, besides those already hinted, will be seen in the sequel, and I
hope will be thought solid and satis∣factory, especially as it hath given
me an opportunity of continuing the latter (and <PB N="19" REF="22"/> as I hope
in God) the much better part of my life, and of adding to it several useful
particulars, which the reader will find there; such as my easy and
expeditious method of studying, and attaining to a fuller knowledge of the
Hebrew tongue; sundry curious and instructive observations relating to
some of the works I have been engaged in, in the learned way, particularly in
that long and laborious one of the Uni∣versal History, of the design,
beginning, and pursuit, together with the difficulties, miscarriages,
faults, and other matters re∣lating to both editions of it; and I have been the
better able to give such an account of the whole as may be of use to the
public, especially to the purchasers, as I have been concerned in it from
the beginning.</P>
<P>The reader will likewise find the latter part of this narrative
interspersed with many other particular accidents which have hap∣pily
contributed not only to keep me steady in my resolutions and change of
life, but which have likewise insensibly led me into a more regular way
of thinking and acting; and, as true repentance begins in the change of the
heart, and ends at the reformation <PB N="20" REF="23"/> of the sinner's life,
I may humbly hope that I have not been negligent in finding out and using the
most effectual helps and means, nor failed of the divine blessing on
them, which are promised to all sincere pe∣nitents. Though the fear I was
in, lest too particular an account of them should be deemed, by the
censorious, as ostentatious and pharisaical, hath obliged me to con∣ceal
a great number of them, which might perhaps have otherwise proved very
en∣couraging to people in my condition; not doubting but to those who are
sincere in their repentance and resolutions, the same Divine Providence
will suppeditate all the necessary helps and directions as their case
requires, even as it hath graciously done to me.</P>
<P>All I would add by way of encourage∣ment to persons in my
unhappy circum∣stances (and worse or more dangerous no man could hardly be
in than I was) is not to let the greatness of their guilt, or the
difficulties of the duties of repentance, de∣ter, but rather invite him to the
throne of mercy, through the merits of our Divine Redeemer; for how dark and
gloomy so∣ever <PB N="21" REF="24"/> the prospect of so extraordinary a
change may appear at first, as every thing doth to those that are fled from
the broad sun-shine into some dark place; yet those thick and
discouraging mists will gradually disappear, and every object that at
first raised our fears will grow more hopeful and com∣fortable, when we
call to mind that there is mercy sufficient in God, merits enough in
Christ, power more than sufficient in the Divine Spirit, room enough in
heaven, scope enough in the evangelical promises, and the most endearing
invitations in the Gospel, to bring the greatest sinners to God of
infinite mercy and compassion; so that there can be thenceforth no
condemnation to them that, with faith and repentance, ap∣ply to him for pardon
and grace through the merits of his ever-blessed Son, and use all proper
means and helps to render him∣self a fit object of it.</P>
<P>We must not however suppose that the blessed effects of
such a repentance will be so soon felt by us as we could wish, or that
the duties of self-denial, self-abhorrence, fasting, solitude,
meditation, self-exami∣nation, &amp;c. will become easy and delight∣ful 
<PB N="22" REF="25"/> as soon as we are entered into a reli∣gious regimen: we
must, on the contrary, expect them to appear difficult and gloomy at the
beginning, in order to excite our faith and reliance on the Divine
assistance, which draws us not with an irresistible force, but with
the cords of men, and the bands of love (Hos. xi. 4.) We must likewise
expect to meet with frequent foils and backslidings in order to make us more
dili∣gent and watchful, more sensible of our own weakness, and more
intent on that help which comes from above. By this means, we shall
likewise be happily preserved from that pride and presumption, which is
but too apt to insinuate itself into the minds of new converts; for
experience plainly shews, that those two dangerous vices will be apt to
spring, not only out of our sins and passions, but likewise out of
our very virtues and graces, if not duly kept down, by the sense or
experience of our own infirmities and impotence.</P>
<P>It was an excellent caution of a pious clergyman: 
<Q REND="inline">"Don't presume; you are not yet come to a
state of Christian perfec∣tion: don't despair; you are in the way 
<PB N="23" REF="26"/> to it."</Q> So that whatever difficulties or
discouragements we may meet with in our progress, how short soever we
may come of our duty, or whatever frailties, or even vices we may still be
prone to, which may either divert or retard our speed, we may still comfort
ourselves with the hopes, that we are in a way of growing better, and that
the use of those means hath not only preserved us in a great measure
from grow∣ing a great deal worse, but enabled us to rise after every fall,
if it hath not sometimes made even those falls rebound to a greater heighth
of grace, by teaching us, from every such step, to tread more sure for
the fu∣ture; and what a comfortable prospect must this yield to a man that
hath made any progress in this happy way, to see God's strength magnified
in his own weakness, especially when he adds thereto this bliss∣ful
consideration, that the same all-merito∣rious blood which was shed to
expiate all his wilful, if truly repented, transgressions, will much more
effectually atone for all his involuntary defects.</P>
<P>Thus much I thought incumbent on me to say on this head,
because whatever our <PB N="24" REF="27"/> freethinkers may boast of the
sufficient power of reason to reclaim a man from a long vicious course,
from the prevalency of evil habits and constitutional vices, what∣ever
powerful influence they may ascribe to the notion of eternal rectitude,
&amp;c. to reduce a man that hath deflected so wide and far from it, without
any of those su∣pernatural helps above-mentioned; yet I am well
assured, that the former, without the latter, would have proved (to me at
least, if not to any man in my condition) rather a determent than an
effectual means; for what hopes or likelihood could there be that a wretch, who
had, by his impe∣tuous passion, been hurried into the com∣mission of
such a series of impieties against his own reason and conscience,
should ever be able to extricate himself from such a sla∣vish state
by his own base natural power?</P>
<P>What efficacious help could he expect from his own reasoning
faculties, which, however cried up by others, he had found, by sad
experience, so weak and impotent, that the most they could do for him, was
to make him condemn himself, without being able to rectify or resist the
violent <PB N="25" REF="28"/> impulses of his predominant vice? Had, indeed,
his knowledge of mankind fur∣nished him with any remarkable instance of the
prevalency of reason above a favourite vice, it might have given him some
encou∣ragement; but when he sees, on the con∣trary, that these strenuous
despisers of all supernatural helps, equally enslaved to some
favourite passion, and only differing from him perhaps in degree; the
most he could expect his reason to do for him, would be to keep his own
under some restraint and decorum, till time and indulgence had quite
exhausted them.</P>
<P>But what poor encouragement is this to one in my dangerous case?
how inconsider∣able the change or remorse? what poor sa∣tisfaction to the
world for so vile an impo∣sition, and what likelihood that it would procure
a pardon from an offended God, or calm the stings of a wounded conscience?
And how much happier was it for me that I was directed to look up for and
depend on a superior assistance, and instead of trust∣ing to such
a broken reed of my reason and strength, to apply myself to that Supreme
Being, whose grace alone could work such <PB N="26" REF="29"/> an
extraordinary change in the heart, give an effectual blessing on my weak
efforts, and keep me steady in those resolutions which he had inspired
me with, as well as in the use of those means he hath provided and
prescribed to us!</P>
<P>I gladly repeat it, that nothing less than the hopes of his
promised grace could have induced me to endeavour after it, and no∣thing but
a full reliance on the merits of a Divine Intercessor could have invited me
to cry to him for pardon and acceptance; and, on the other hand, nothing but
the obtain∣ing it could have supported me under my doubts and fears, my
difficulties and dis∣couragements, nor enabled me to persevere in, and
nothing less than the continuance and increase of it could have brought a
work of such extraordinary and undeserved mercy to perfection.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore but think it the greatest injury that can be
done, to persons who have unhappily swerved from the paths of vir∣tue and
religion, to make them depend solely on the strength of their rational
faculties for an effectual change, and to in∣spire them with a disregard
for the more <PB N="27" REF="30"/> powerful means and motives which the Gospel
offers to them, and which, upon experience, will be found the only ones that
can bring it about. And may what I have here said inspire every awakened
sinner, (who hath tried in vain the success of the former) with the more
comfortable hope and stedfast confidence, in the never-failing efficacy of
the latter.</P>
<P>Having said thus much on the subject of the divine grace
offered to us in the Gospel, it will doubtless be expected that I should
give some farther account of my private be∣lief so far as relates to the
controversy be∣tween the church of Rome, in which I was educated, and that of
England, in the com∣munion of which I have lived, ever since my coming into
England. And here I must confess, to my very great shame, that though I
did for several years profess myself a zealous member of the latter, yet
the pre∣judices of my education, and the general course of my studies, did
still strongly in∣cline me in favour of the former; insomuch that neither
the many books of controversy I had read on that subject, nor my frequent
disputes with priests and others of that com∣munion <PB N="28" REF="31"/>
(in which, however, I had still va∣nity enough to give the preference to my
arguments against it) could fix my waver∣ing mind, much less could I be
induced to think it so corrupt and dangerous, antichris∣tian and idolatrous
as it was with so much warmth maintained to be by most prote∣stant
writers and preachers; insomuch that this uncharitable zeal of theirs made me
still more doubtful whether the reasons they urged were sufficient to
justify their separa∣tion from it.</P>
<P>I was indeed sincerely persuaded, from all that I had read or
heard, that the church of England was by far the best and safest of all
the protestant churches; but that it was really more so than that of Rome,
I was far enough from being satisfied in my mind; so that there was
almost as little sincerity in my pretended zeal for and constant
com∣munion with it, than in my pretended con∣version to it: the truth of it
is, that I was too young and heedless, vain and conceited, to lie open to
conviction, and that I read and heard the arguments on both sides, rather to
fill my head than to rectify my heart, or fix my belief; so that I must
con∣fess <PB N="29" REF="32"/> that I acted at that time a very shame∣ful
and insincere part, in the preference I so strenuously gave to the one
above the other, which, though ever so justly de∣served, did not appear
then in that light to me.</P>
<P>In this careless, though impious and abo∣minable, suspence I
continued some years (which, upon the whole, was but of a piece with the
other and more flagrant part of my imposture) till I came to read a
treatise, intituled, THE CASE STATED BETWEEN A NOBLEMAN OF THE CHURCH OF
ROME, AND A GENTLEMAN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND, in which I thought I found the
controversy fully and clearly decided in favour of the latter. And I gave the
heed to the arguments on both sides, not only as they appeared to me to be
stated with the greatest clearness and impartiality, but as I had been
long ac∣quainted with Mr. Charles Lesley, the re∣puted author of that book,
who was uni∣versally allowed to be one of the learnedest men in that
controversy, and had moreover given the strongest proofs of his probity
and sincerity, as well as of his capacity and <PB N="30" REF="33"/>
unbiassed judgment; of all which I was so fully apprised, that no book
that I had read did ever contribute so much, if not to fix my wavering mind,
yet at least to make me think more seriously on the sub∣ject, and to
give myself up to a fresh and more close application to that
controversy, and the reading of all the best authors who had, or should
afterwards write on either side; for I doubted not but we should soon
hear of one or more answers from some of the best pens from that side,
against it. However, though I never could learn of any that was made to it,
it did not divert me from my purpose. And indeed I found myself so
strongly prepossessed in favour of the author, that I had reason to
fear lest the impression which his book had made upon my mind, should
be owing to that, rather than to the validity of his arguments, until I had
read over afresh all that had been urged in favour of the opposite side.
But here again, though I went over them with the greatest attention and
sincerity, I found the dispute so strangely managed, and clog∣ged with
such elaborate learning and so∣phistry, such controverted quotations
from <PB N="31" REF="34"/> the Scriptures and ancient fathers, such
un∣christian charges of forgery, and perverting the sense of those
authors, and other un∣charitable language, as rather bewildered than convinced
my mind; so that the only fruit I reaped from all my reading (besides a
strong prejudice against those of the Ro∣mish side, whom I observed
to deal most in that unfair way of disputing) was, that there could be no
safety in trusting to my own judgment in a matter of such vast concern;
and that it was next to impossible for men, frail as we are, and warped by
our own passions and prejudices, to wade through such stormy seas of
controversy, without an extraordinary assistance from the fountain of
all light and truth. I have accordingly made it my constant care ever
since, that is, for above these twenty-five years, to ap∣ply myself
fervently, and to depend wholly upon that divine guide for a deliverance from
all errors of faith and practice, and for such an increase of his light and
grace as may confirm me in the belief of all his saving truths, obedience to
all his commands, sincere communion with his holy catholic church, and a
tender and charitable concern <PB N="32" REF="35"/> for all those who have
swerved from it. To these petitions (which I constantly offered up to
God, not only morning and night for a long series of years, but in a more
copious and fuller form, suitable to my own exi∣gence, on more solemn, that
is, on fast and festival days) I hope is owing, that in∣ward satisfaction
which I have since been blessed with, in my more steady and sincere
communion with the church of England, and in the preference I now give it to
all other churches; and, as I hope in God, without the least breach of
charity to any of the rest. And indeed by all that I have read, or been able
to judge, I have been more and more convinced that theirs and ours are all in
an imperfect state, though some more than others, and that they are like to
con∣tinue so till the rising again of the sun of righteousness upon
us, whose brightness will then enlighten at once both hemispheres, and
who will then not only reform what∣ever is amiss in his mystical body, but
bring the Jews, Turks, and Heathen into it; till then we can only in charity
bewail what∣ever errors we see in them, either in faith or practice, and pray
to God to reform them <PB N="33" REF="36"/> in his own good time, and to be
merciful to those whose hearts are sincere towards him, whatever
involuntary mistakes they may labour under.</P>
<P> Infallibility in the church were a blessing as much to be
wished for in this uncertain state, as it is falsely challenged by the
church of Rome; but since reason and experi∣ence shew it to be denied to
us, and many sincere members of that church do pri∣vately bewail the errors
that are crept into it, though loath to own them a sufficient cause for our
separation from it, it highly becomes us all to make the best use of that
guide which God hath given us, viz. his divine revealed Will and Word, without
breaking the bond of Charity with those who interpret it in a different way
from us: for though, in that respect, we may justly enough acknowledge in
the words of our church's confession, that 
<Q REND="inline"> "we have" all, more or less, "erred and
strayed like lost sheep,"</Q> and that perhaps chiefly through our 
<Q REND="inline">"following too much the devices and desires of
our hearts;"</Q> yet as God is the only judge how far every man is faulty in
that respect, should we not be very <PB N="34" REF="37"/> careful to pass
such a favourable judgment on them, as may entitle us to the same
in∣dulgence from the judge of all hearts? Should it not at least (seeing we
are all alike fallible, and stand in need of the same charitable allowance)
make us exceeding fearful how we do, by our anathemas and other unchristian
denunciations against those that differ from us, expose ourselves to
the same severe sentence, and meet with the same measure at the
last day, as we have so freely dealt unto them? This unchari∣table
condemning spirit, which hath so long reigned among Christians of all
denomina∣tions, I have long since looked upon as the most dangerous error a
man can fall into, as it is indeed the most open violation of the grand
characteristic of the Gospel.</P>
<P>I have been ready to shudder when I have heard some of our
preachers inveigh, in that uncharitable way, against their
Fellow-christians, or even against our modern Free∣thinkers and Deists.
Some of them I have heard and read, who could not speak or write of them
without ridicule and derision, instead of that pity and concern which is
due to persons in that dangerous state; and, <PB N="35" REF="38"/> for that
reason, have always thought them the most unfit to teach others, who had
all the true spirit of Christianity to seek, and can allow themselves
to exult and droll over the errors and frailties of their fellow-creatures,
which even common humanity forbids us to think of or mention without the
utmost seriousness and compassion.</P>
<P>This uncharitable and untimely zeal, even in controversies of
the highest nature, doth still more mischief in another way, by
mag∣nifying and aggravating the differences be∣tween the contending sides,
which serves only to render them the more irreconcile∣able; whereas a true
christian spirit will, from a sense of its own infirmity, rather
chuse to excuse and palliate them, and will be extremely careful to
soften and smooth every thing that is offered in the opposition, in order
to render it less irksome and inef∣fectual.</P>
<P>Had our divine Lawgiver designed that we should have all
agreed, in the main points of religion, or had he seen any thing so
sinful and dangerous in our disagreement about it, his infinite wisdom
and goodness would, doubtless, either have given us <PB N="36" REF="39"/>
greater helps and brighter faculties, or would have taken care to have his
revelation made so plain and obvious, that none but the wil∣ful and
perverse could have erred from it. In either of which cases, where would
there have been any room for that charitable and forbearing spirit which is
the peculiar cha∣racteristic of Christ's true disciples, and is so
acceptable to him? not towards those that agreed with us from the same
motives we agreed with them; nor yet much less to∣wards those that differ
from us, when it would have plainly appeared, that not their infirmity or
ignorance, but their pride and perveseness made them do so. May we not
therefore safely conclude, that God suf∣fers us to continue in this
imperfect and uncertain state, and unavoidable diversity of opinions, in
order to give us an opportunity of exercising a virtue, which is of all
others the most exalted and most acceptable to him, as being the nearest
to its divine ori∣ginal.</P>
<P>God, who is emphatically stiled love, and hath been beyond all
possible conception diffusive of it to us, hath, at the same time,
assured us, that the best returns we can make <PB N="37" REF="40"/> to him
for it, or he expects from us, is to make our own as extensive as we can to
all that bear his divine image: herein there∣fore is this most excellent
virtue, this cha∣ritable spirit displayed in a manner most nearly
resembling his own, when (instead of treating those that differ from us
with contempt, sourness, or impatience, which is base and selfish, or
with ill language, opprobrious names, unjust reflections, curses, and
anathemas, which is truly diabolical) we think and look upon them with the
same candor, benevolence, and compas∣sionate concern, as we should
wish to be shewn to us were their case our own; when we make the most
charitable allow∣ances for their infirmities and mistakes, and are ready to
ascribe their errors to the weakness of their understanding, wrong
education, or any thing rather than to the perverseness of their will;
when, by our behaviour, our prayers, and good wishes, we strive to convince
them that all our en∣deavours to reclaim them from their errors, do really
spring from our tender sense of their danger, and from such a sincere
and disinterested concern for their spiritual wel∣fare, 
<PB N="38" REF="41"/> as no opposition or obstinacy on their part shall be
able to lessen in the least, be∣cause that being a duty enjoined by
God, we cannot in any case dispense with it, without danger of incurring
his displeasure; and lastly, when we can, in spight of all their
obstinacy or untowardness, make them sensible, by our words and
deportment, that we wish their happiness as heartily as ever; and that,
after having tried our best efforts in vain, we heartily recommend them
still to that merciful God, whose equity and goodness will acquit and
approve every man who conscientiously seeks for, and endea∣vours after
the best light, and is ready to obey it as far as he is able to observe
it.</P>
<P>Could we once make this the aim and re∣sult of all our religious
differences and dis∣putes, they would, instead of a bane, prove a strong
cement and support to Christianity; we might then differ one from another
without breach of charity, as friends love one another, though of different
tempers, complexions, &amp;c. Our unbelievers would be so far from taking an
advantage from them to cry it down, that they must be forced to admire and
esteem it for the bles∣sed <PB N="39" REF="42"/> effects it produced in
mens hearts and lives, how wide soever their judgments differed in other
cases; whereas, whilst we make them the sad occasion of faction and
strife, of selfishness and malignity, or of unreasonable
impositions on the faith and practice, of slander, hatred, persecution,
&amp;c. it can hardly be expected that our sceptics and infidels will be
candid or ingenuous enough to perceive, or at least to own, that all this
unchristian behaviour is diametri∣cally opposite to the Gospel.</P>
<P>It is indeed much to be wished, that some of the ancient
fathers had not mingled so much of this antichristian spirit with their
otherwise pious and learned writings, and had not done, as the great St.
Jerome owns himself, in his epistle to Pammachius; to have done against
Jovinian, that he had less regarded what was exactly to have been urged
against him, than what might be laid as a charge against him. How much of
our now reigning scepticism and infidelity may have been owing to such an
unchristian spi∣rit, propagated and improved as it hath been in
subsequent ages, and how much such uncharitable writers and preachers of 
<PB N="40" REF="43"/> controversy will have to answer for it at the last
day, I will not presume to determine; but thus much I may venture to infer
from it, that those Boanerges did chuse the most unlikely means of
recommending Christi∣anity to the unbelieving part of the world, (if such
was their real design) when they strove to propagate it in a way so
diametri∣cally opposite to the meek and benevolent spirit of its divine
author.</P>
<P>This single consideration, joined to the sense had of the
weakness of our understanding and incapacity of judging in matters of so
high a nature, hath long ago made me very careful of condemning or censuring
any church or sect for holding any tenets which my conscience could not
readily join in. We may indeed expose ourselves to a se∣verer judgment,
by passing too rash or un∣charitable a one on others, but can never run
the same risk by the most candid and favourable allowance we can make for
them. And, after all, what have we to do to judge those that differ from us,
since both they and we must stand accountable to him only who is the
unerring judge of all hearts?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44"/>I cannot forbear adding, that the almost
unsurmountable difficulties I have found to come to the bottom of the greater
part of our disputed points, and the little certainty or satisfaction I
have reaped from reading of most controversies, clogged and disguised
as they are with sophistry and endless sub∣tilities, and managed with
so little appear∣ance of impartiality and charity, have made me such a
Pyrrhonian in polemic divinity, that I have not dared to allow myself the
liberty of censuring those who held what I thought an error in faith or
practice, or even to pronounce it to be such, though I have been wanting in
neither zeal nor cou∣rage to oppose any such on all proper occa∣sions,
and to give the best reason I could for my dissenting from them; and I
much question whether, in the imperfect and un∣certain state we are in,
reason or religion will permit us, much less require of us, to proceed
farther; and whether a more po∣sitive or categorical declaration doth not
ar∣gue something worse than prepossession and narrowness of mind,
and will not be liable to be condemned as an unchristian warp of the
will.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="45"/>The transubstantiation of the church of
Rome, is a doctrine that appears the most shocking to sense and
reason. That of abso∣lute predestination among the greater part of the
reformed churches, appears not only the most opposite to the divine
attributes of love, goodness, justice, &amp;c. but to strike at the root
of the Christian religion, which is founded on the love of God; for how is it
possible for a man to look upon so ar∣bitrary a being as that doctrine
represents him, but with the utmost awe and dread, even though he was ever
so fully persuaded that himself was one of the predestinate? and how
much more so the more he is re∣moved from such a persuasion?
Neverthe∣less, as I have all possible reason to believe that there are
myriads of men of learning and probity who behold those two doc∣trines in a
quite different light, and not only hold them as necessary articles of
their faith, but are ready to condemn all that do not, why should I be so
partial to my own judgment, as to think it more infallible than theirs, or
venture to pass the same uncharitable sentence on them for believing
which I blame them in my conscience for <PB N="43" REF="46"/> pronouncing
against me for not believing them?</P>
<P>With what justice can I charge the former with idolatry for
worshipping what they sincerely believe to be the real body of our divine
and adorable Redeemer? Or how can I tax the latter with impiety for
pro∣fessing a doctrine, which I ought in charity to think they would abhor,
did it appear to them as derogatory of God's goodness and justice, as it
doth to me, especially as the belief of both is founded on their im∣plicit
belief, (and consequently, and at the worst, on a mistaken
interpretation) of the Holy Scripture?</P>
<P>Is it not therefore more safe and more chris∣tian for me to
content myself with giving my reasons in the strongest manner I am
able, for my dissent from them, than to charge them, even in thought, with
wil∣fully perverting the word of God, and with all the guilt and infamy of
imposing damn∣able errors, under pain of damnation? It may be indeed truly
said, that this kind of retaliation is what not only reigns too much in
most christian churches, even to this day, but hath proved the frequent
occasion <PB N="44" REF="47"/> of the most horrid persecutions and
anti∣christian cruelties: But is it not therefore the more to be avoided and
abhorred by all true Christians for the mischief it hath done, and is
still able to do, to the Gospel, and for the scandal it reflects on the
best religion in the world?</P>
<P>Ought it not to be a matter of the deepest grief and concern to
a good Christian, to see the most gracious designs of heaven to∣wards
mankind thus miserably obstructed and frustrated, and so great a part
of man∣kind deprived of the inestimable benefits of it, by an untimely zeal,
the most opposite to the spirit of our meek and divine Redeemer, and the
most condemned, both by his pre∣cepts and example? Doth not right reason
itself, as well as our natural self-love, tell every man how careful he
ought to be not to be mistaken in a matter of such infinite concern? And
suppose we have ever so much reason to think those that differ from
us are really so, must we therefore take upon us to censure and condemn,
to anathema∣tize and persecute them, whom reason and charity should
rather incline us to pity and pray for, whether their error be wilful or 
<PB N="45" REF="48"/> involuntary, which can only be known to God?</P>
<P>I have chosen to instance in the doctrines of
transubstantiation and predestination, as they appear the most
shocking and anti∣scriptural to every one, except those who believe them;
nevertheless, from a sense of my fallibility, as well as of the
weakness of human reason, I should be very fearful of pronouncing them
absolutely false (much less to call them anti-christian, damnable,
&amp;c.) their appearing so to me is a sufficient reason for my declaring
my dissent from them, but doth not authorize me to pro∣nounce those that
believe them to be guilty before God for so doing.</P>
<P>Were I to indulge myself in the liberty of censuring or
condemning any christian church, for any thing either in their faith or
practice, it would be that uncharitable authority they assume of
condemning, as hereticks, &amp;c. all those who cannot believe as they
do.</P>
<P>And yet I own it highly necessary that there should be, in
every particular church (since it is not given to us in this imperfect
state to be thus happily united in our belief) <PB N="46" REF="49"/> a
stated rule of faith, a summary of what is to be principally believed and
practised by all its members; but then care should be taken not to multiply
those articles be∣yond what is absolutely necessary, nor yet to
impose them with any such damnatory clauses against recusants as are
commonly used by most churches, to the great detri∣ment and discredit of
Christianity, and the intimidating and bewildering the sincere and
well-meaning Christians, who are inca∣pable of judging of the merit of
those con∣troversies, and being commonly by far the most numerous, are
entitled to a more cha∣ritable and tender regard than to be obliged blindly to
believe and act as their church prescribes, or be liable to be rescinded
from it.</P>
<P>Even in those articles wherein our church is obliged to declare
its dissent from any of the tenets of others, methinks they might and
should in charity content themselves with giving their reasons, in the
plainest and concisest manner, for their dissent, and with such
impartial candor and tenderness as should rather inspire its members with
pity and concern for, than prejudice and <PB N="47" REF="50"/> hatred against,
those that differ from them: and, above all things, they should all be
ex∣ceedingly fearful of charging their antago∣nists, and their tenets, with a
greater de∣gree of guilt and danger than is consistent with truth, and with
that spirit which con∣demns and abhors all misrepresentation and
opprobrious language as the most de∣structive, next to ill offices or
persecution, of all errors that a Christian can fall into.</P>
<P>It is plainly the want of this meek christian spirit, that
makes men to intermix so much deadly acrimony in all their disputes and
differences, as serves only to destroy the small sparks of charity that
are left among us. But where the love of Christ unites our hearts in the
bonds of peace and mu∣tual benevolence, no difference in religion, however
greatly misrepresented or aggra∣vated by untimely zeal, will ever be able
to dissolve the tye, or create the least dis∣agreement or indifference
in their affec∣tions.</P>
<P>There are many things in the Greek, and Roman church, in that of
Geneva, and Augs∣burgh, &amp;c. which my conscience will not permit me to
join with; but which I, at <PB N="48" REF="51"/> the same time, firmly hope
and believe will not be laid to their charge by the merciful searcher of all
hearts, who rather pities than punishes the involuntary errors of his frail
creatures: and were there none better to be found in the christan world than
those, I should think myself obliged to join com∣munion with that which
appeared to me the freest from them, rather than to stand by myself, and
be deprived of the benefit of church-fellowship, provided nothing was
imposed upon me by it that my conscience thought sinful. I look upon them
all (ex∣cepting such as deny the fundamental arti∣cles of Christianity,
especially the merits and mediation of our divine Redeemer) as so many
branches of Christ's church; and tho' some are more corrupted than others,
yet all united into one body, of which he himself is the supreme head and
governor, and is acknowledged by them as such.</P>
<P>However, I own that the church of Eng∣land hath, in all
respects, appeared to me, ever since I have made myself more
se∣riously acquainted with its faith and prac∣tice, the best reformed and
freest from every thing that could restrain me from her com∣munion, 
<PB N="49" REF="52"/> especially as I am a layman: for with respect to her
clergy, I think some of the injunctions she lays them under to be such as
I could by no means submit to, and which the more conscientious among them
would, I believe, be glad to be freed from, if it could be done
consistently with the honour, and safety of its establishment. I am
far from intending by this to cast any blemish on the reverend order, or on
the first reformers; but as it hath given so much occasion for cavil and
disrespectful reflections against both, I could heartily wish to see
it effectually removed. In other respects I have long since had a vast
esteem and regard for her liturgy, sacraments, or∣dination, and other
ordinances, that it hath been, and is still, a matter of regret to me,
whenever business or any other impediment hath deprived me of the benefit
of them.</P>
<P>Her episcopacy, though so much disre∣garded by other
protestant churches, and cried down, as invalid, by that of Rome, hath long
ago been looked upon by me, not only as a singular blessing, but as a
ne∣cessary constituent of a church, the divine institution of which
hath been, in my opi∣nion, <PB N="50" REF="53"/> as fully proved against the
former, as the validity of its ordination hath against the latter; and all I
have to wish for her sake, is, that she was as happy in the choice,
appointment, and promotion of her prelates; and that the Congès Delire
were something more than a phrase without meaning: however, that needs not
to debar us, in this imperfect state, from enjoying the benefits of their
sacred function to very good pur∣poses; nor discourage us from wishing
and praying for a reformation of those abuses which worldly politicians
have introduced into it.</P>
<P>Most people indeed, who look upon the evil to lie in human
nature itself, have little hopes to see any amendment to it, till we have a
new heaven and a new earth, especially as those in whose power the remedy
is, are most interested to suppress it: But a good Christian will
look higher up than those at the helm for so desirable a change, since,
as I believe, we have much more reason to hope for it from the
interposition of heaven, than any of the neighbouring churches which labour
under the same difficulties. As for those countries abroad, which have
secula∣rized <PB N="51" REF="54"/> their bishopricks, &amp;c. they will
hardly charge our church with abusing hers worse than they have done
theirs; so that, upon the whole, it appears in all respects to stand upon
a better and more hopeful foot than any other I know, with all its
imperfections and defects.</P>
<P>I cannot dismiss this point without taking some notice of a
charge which some of our present Methodists have laid to it, viz. its
having departed from some of its ancient doctrines, particularly those of
predestina∣tion and free-grace, or imputed righteous∣ness. With respect
to the former, it doth not appear that the compilers of the se∣venteenth
article ever designed to impose the belief of it as necessary to
salvation, but only to define the term of predestina∣tion, as
strenuously maintained by the re∣formed churches of Geneva, Switzerland,
Holland, &amp;c. leaving it to the option of every one either to assent or
dissent from it: much less do they seem to have insisted upon the
belief of it in that full and exten∣sive sense (and including absolute
reproba∣tion) in which the Supralapsarians explain it, which doctrine is now
justly rejected by <PB N="52" REF="55"/> most divines and members of this
church. Mr. Whitefield's charge of innovation is therefore unjust; and it is
well known, that he did not think otherwise of it, till he was persuaded
into that opinion upon his going to preach in America: however, could it be
supposed that the first reformers really designed it in that
supralapsarian sense, I should have commended any synod who
should have since then ordered it to have been erazed, seeing the truth
of a christian doctrine is not founded on the opinion or authority of any
men, but on the evidence of Holy Writ.</P>
<P>With respect to the other charge, viz. in∣herent and imputed
righteousness, it must be owned, that our sermons and books of devotion
seem rather to run so much in commendation of good works, as to lead people
to lay a greater stress on the former than on the latter, and to confide
more on their good deeds than on the merits of Christ, which is certainly a
dangerous mi∣stake, since our hope of acceptance and sal∣vation must be
chiefly founded upon the latter, without which our best duties could never be
acceptable from such frail and <PB N="53" REF="56"/> sinful creatures to a
God of infinite holi∣ness.</P>
<P>It were therefore to be wished, that our preachers and divines
would take some more care to caution their hearers and readers, whenever they
insist on the necessity of good works, against their putting their
chief de∣pendence on them, and to remind them that the alone merits and
intercession of our divine Redeemer can give them their saving efficacy.
But though this last point is not so frequently inculcated and insisted
upon as could be wished, yet that it is al∣ways understood and implied, is
certain, be∣cause it always was, and is still acknow∣ledged to be a
fundamental article of the church of England; so that it is unjust to
charge it with having departed from it; and yet this is the common cry of
these modern enthusiasts, who are every where denouncing damnation
against all those who insist on or put any dependence on inherent
righteousness: but how unjustly and falsely, let the apostle St. Paul
inform them, who expresly tells us (1 Corinth. iii. 11-15.) that such
men shall be saved, though with great difficulty; or, as he expresses
it, so <PB N="54" REF="57"/> as by fire, though not one of their works
should stand the fiery trial; for how pre∣carious soever the
superstructure be, whilst Christ is the foundation, he cannot but be
safe that builds his hopes upon it, whatever straw, stubble, or other
trash he may in∣termix with it.</P>
<P>However, I do not doubt but this false alarm of the Methodists
hath proved of some use to many Christians, as I own it hath to me, and
hath awakened them into a better and humbler opinion of their inhe∣rent
righteousness, than they perhaps had before. As to my own particular, tho'
I al∣ways depended solely on the merits of a cru∣cified Redeemer for pardon
and acceptance, and looked upon all our best services to be destitute of
the least worth, but what they receive from him; yet I have been warned, by
this late outcry, to put less stress and confidence in them, and to look
upon them rather as the evidence of our sincerity and salvation, than as
the means or foundation of it, rather as our qualification for heaven (on which
account we may safely wish, en∣deavour, and pray that we may more and more
abound in them) than as things ca∣pable <PB N="55" REF="58"/> to give us any
title to it, which no∣thing can do but the imputed righteousness of
Christ.</P>
<P>Thus much I thought incumbent on me to declare concerning my
notions of religion in general, of the church of England in particular, and my
reason for preferring her communion to all other. I hope they are all
agreeable to the word of God, and that I have taken all possible care and
pains to have them chiefly founded on that, by fre∣quently reading and
consulting the sacred volumes in their original, and using all pro∣per
helps, as commentators, paraphrasts, books of controversy, &amp;c. in order
to come at their true meaning. But above all, my chief dependence hath been
upon the guid∣ance and assistance of God's Holy Spirit, which, for a
great number of years, I have never failed daily to implore, as I was truly
sensible, how poor and insignificant all other helps would be without it,
towards the bring∣ing us through the vast mazes of contro∣versy, which
reign all over Christendom, to the wished-for haven and salvation, to
which I earnestly pray to God to bring every sincere soul, that longs and
strives for <PB N="56" REF="59"/> it. I firmly rely on the same divine
good∣ness to whom I owe so many mercies, and so wonderful a change, that
if there be yet any thing erroneous or amiss, either in my belief and
practice, he will, in his own time, and by his all-sufficient light and
grace, enable me to rectify it, that I may have nothing left to do but to
acknowledge and adore his infinite and undeserved mercies to me, and
particularly for having enabled me to see so much of my own weakness and
insufficiency, unworthiness and misery, as to put my whole trust and
confidence in his all-powerful grace and unbounded goodness, through the
infinite merits of our blessed Redeemer.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this Preface, it will be likewise
necessary for me to give some ac∣count of that vast quantity of
laudanum I have been known to take for above these forty years, and my
motives for so doing, in order to undeceive such persons as may have
conceived too favourable an opinion of that dangerous drug, from any thing they
may have heard me say, heard at second∣hand, or may have observed of the
small <PB N="57" REF="60"/> visible hurt I have received from it, during
so long and constant a use of it.</P>
<P>And first of all, as to the true occasion of my taking it,
whatever pretence I may here∣tofore have made for it, such as its easing
the pain of the gout, (which distemper, though I heretofore pretended to be
often troubled with, yet I never was, nor had the least symptom or tendency
to in my consti∣tution) or of its being a great help to study, a reviver of
the spirits, and the like, which qualities it in some measure hath; yet
my motive for taking it at first, and continuing it so long, was no other
than my vanity and senseless affectation of singularity; and as that
was then my predominant passion, so I indulged it in this and many other
such extravagant ways, at any hazard, as the following sheets will more
fully shew.</P>
<P>Secondly, as to the quantity, though it never came up to that
vast excess as I did then pretend; yet I own that I frequently took such
large doses, by way of ostenta∣tion, as must have proved detrimental, if
not quite fatal, to any man that had had a less strong and happy
constitution than I was blessed with; and I have been very 
<PB N="58" REF="61"/> often surprised to find that I received so little
prejudice from it. And this it was that emboldened me to take such large and
dangerous draughts of it, without the least necessity or motive for it,
but to be taken notice and talked of; insomuch that I con∣tinued it during
such a number of years, that I was become a perfect slave to, and could not
be easy without it, tho' I had for some time been sensible of the ill
consequences attending the constant use of it, especially as often as I
indulged my vanity with a larger dose than usual.</P>
<P>Thirdly, As to my vain pretence of having found an effectual way
of stripping the opium of all its pernicious qualities, though it was true in
part, and I had fallen upon a preparation of it (which was a kind of safe and
useful improvement on that which Dr. Jones gives us in his MYSTERY OF OPIUM)
by the help of some acids, particularly the juice of Seville oranges, which,
mixed with some alcalies, raised a kind of ferment in the infusion, by
which some of the most viscous and narcotic parts were either scum∣med
off, or made to subside; yet so far was it from being so inoffensive
and benefi∣cial, <PB N="59" REF="62"/> as I gave it out, that I had frequent
occasion to observe some of its ill effects in those whom I
unadvisedly persuaded to use it in some proper cases, as I thought,
so that I was obliged to leave off prescribing it to others; though, as to
myself, I was a long while before I found any inconvenience in taking it,
even in that large quantity; and I have great reason still to think it
less dangerous by far than either that of Dr. Sydenham's, or any infusion
exhibited by the apothecaries and common dispen∣saries.</P>
<P>However, when I began to feel the incon∣venient effects of it,
which was not till a good number of years using it, I thought it high time to
lessen the usual dose (which was then about ten or twelve tea
spoonfuls morning and night, and very often more) as fast as I conveniently
could, and in about six month's time had reduced myself to half an ounce
per day, and somewhat weaker than the common Sydenham. I still conti∣nued
decreasing; but such was my foolish vanity, that, to conceal my
reduction, I added some other bitter tincture, especially that of
hierapicra, or some other such corrective, <PB N="60" REF="63"/> among it,
to appear as still taking my usual quantity.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I found that this re∣duction, gradual as it
was, could not be continued without some affecting and dis∣couraging
inconveniences; such as a great lassitude and uneasiness of the mind,
an in∣dolence and incapacity for study, a dislike to every thing I read or
wrote, to solitude and application; all which made me apprehen∣sive, that
if I did not slacken it, and go more warily on with it, I might bring
myself into a greater evil than that which I endeavoured to shun, and fling
myself at length into a kind of habitual torpor and inactivity, which might
prove at least as detrimental to me: to prevent which, I was forced to take a
new method, and to inlarge or lessen my dose, according to the state of
health I was in, sometimes according as the weather was more or less
enlivening, or according as the course of my studies required a greater or
lesser degree of application. All this, how∣ever, was rather owing to my
own natural indolence and want of resolution to go on in spight of all
those inconveniences, than to any danger there really was in the 
<PB N="61" REF="64"/> case, as I happily found reason afterwards to think;
for when the Divine Providence was pleased to bless me with a contrary turn
of mind, and to make me detest and abhor all my former follies, and this
among the rest, to such a degree, as to resolve, by his assistance,
upon a thorough change, I then found both the task, and all the
inconve∣niences attending it, to grow more and more easy; and as this
resolution was founded upon a much better principle than my former ones were,
so it was attended with such a blessing at my last stay at Oxford,
anno — from July to the latter end of September, by which time I had made
a considerable pro∣gress in my reduction, that I had quite com∣pleted the
conquest, and lived some weeks there without taking one drop, or even
wishing for it, although neither then nor since was I without some
employment which required a pretty close application.</P>
<P>In this pleasing state, as I justly thought it, I continued
for some months, when the severity of the ensuing winter overturned all
my measures, and forced me, though much against my will, to have recourse
to it again: neither could I think of any safer or <PB N="62" REF="65"/> more
effectual remedy against that chilness of my blood, and lowness of
spirits, which I laboured under through the excessive cold∣ness of the
season. I resolved, however, to resume it in the smallest quantity
that I could find would answer my end; that is, what was, as near as I could
judge, equiva∣lent to ten or twelve drops of Sydenham's, and with full
intention to leave it off as soon as the warm weather returned, and had
ac∣cordingly reduced myself to about half that quantity, though not without
some diffi∣culty, on account of a work I was still en∣gaged in, and the
necessity we were under to keep time with the printers and publishers.
Finding it at length so necessary and pleasant, as well as safe and
harmless, I resolved to continue it, and have done so to this pre∣sent
time; that is, for seven or eight years, without the least inconvenience
from it. On the contrary, I have reason to think that even that small
quantity, though scarce equi∣valent to twelve drops of Sydenham's, hath been
of some service to me to prevent that decay of spirits which old age,
(being now drawing near my seventieth) a sedentary life, and close
study, might otherwise proba∣bly <PB N="63" REF="66"/> have brought upon me:
and it is to this small dose, which I take every night in a pint of very
small punch, as soon as I leave off writing, that I attribute, next to the
blessing of God, that good share of health I have hitherto enjoyed, and
my having been able, for so many years, to go through the fatigues and
applications of study, from seven in the morning to seven at night,
pre∣serving still a good appetite and digestion, a clear head, and
tolerable flow of spirits, and enjoying a sound sleep of six or seven
hours, without indulging myself in any other li∣quors than tea all the day,
and the above∣mentioned quantity of punch, or something equivalent to it at
night; and as I have not opportunity for much exercise, I take care to live
on the plainest diet at noon, and to observe the old adage at night, 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Ut fis nocte levis, fit tibi caena brevis.</HI></L></Q> 
<Q> 
<L>To sleep easy at night, let your supper be
light.</L></Q></P>

<PB REF="67"/>
<HEAD>MEMOIRS, OF GEORGE PSALMANAZAR.</HEAD>
<P>I cannot better begin this melancholy ac∣count of my former life,
vile and abo∣minable as it hath been, and blended with such mixture of the
most unaccountable pride, folly, and stupid villainy, in oppo∣sition to
reason, religion, and all checks of conscience, till almost to the
thirtieth year of my age, than by humbly acknowledging the infinite mercy of
God, not only in pre∣serving me so long from the many evils and
disasters which my own wicked rash∣ness must else unavoidably have
precipitated me into, as the sequel will sufficiently show; but much more
so in that gradual and vi∣sible change which his grace wrought in me, by
enabling me frequently to retro∣spect with shame and remorse on a life
so basely spent, to send up the most fervent wishes to heaven that
I might at length break off from so shameful and wicked a course of the
vilest and most scandalous <PB N="66" REF="68"/> imposture, that a wild
and abandoned youth could be guilty of, and that I might but be blessed
with such a steady resolution as at once publickly to disclaim all the
lies and forgeries I had formerly published in that monstrous romance, and
at any rate or risk to take the shame to my self, and make a free
confession of the whole imposture. But I had not only my pride to combat,
but the displeasure which such a declaration would give to all my
friends, who being very honest and religi∣ous, could not but have taken it
much at heart, and, perhaps, been exposed to the censure of the world for
their charitable opinion of me; to say nothing of the ab∣horrence they must
have conceived-against so detestable a cheat. As these therefore were
such powerful determents to a man wholly destitute of any laudable way of
living, I could not expect that my earnest wishes would be speedily
answered; and my only hope was, that the same gracious God, who had thus
effectually awaked me to a sense of my guilt and danger, would also in
his own time hear those prayers which himself had inspired me to make, 
<PB N="67" REF="69"/> especially, as upon a retrospection of my past
follies, I was apt to comfort myself with the thoughts, that the violence of
my favourite passion, pride, could never have hurried me so
irresistibly through such scenes of folly and danger, if there had not
been some sad flaw in my understand∣ing, some unavoidable degree of
madness in my temper, which might in some mea∣sure extenuate, if not
wholly excuse, the atrocious guilt it had involved me in; and the hope that
it might still be placed to that account, by a merciful Judge of all our
thoughts and intents, of our frail and corrupt nature, joined to the
stedfast con∣fidence I had in the promises of the Gospel, and in the
infinite merits of a divine Saviour, preserved me from de∣spairing of mercy
and pardon, of success and blessing on those happy beginnings, if
closely and earnestly pursued.</P>
<P>But as such a hope, without a sincere desire of doing one's
part, to the best of one's power, and according to the degree of
as∣sistance given from above, would rather deserve the name of rash
and shameful pre∣sumption; <PB N="68" REF="70"/> so the next step I
took, at least in view, was to set about making all possi∣ble
reparation to God and his church, and to the world, and my own consci∣ence,
for the scandal which such a vile piece of hypocrisy must have given to
all, especially to good men, and in spite of all reluctance from pride and
self-love, which the greater it was, would the more natu∣rally lead one to
the throne of mercy for a proportionable supply of Divine grace, and
patiently to wait for it in God's own proper time. I had not continued many
months in this hopeful disposition, before I perceived all those
difficulties and dis∣couragements to vanish by degrees, but more
especially at the approach of a se∣vere disease, though lingering, and
the apprehensions of death, which last, as it did not appear to be so
near at hand, gave me room to hope I might have time sufficient granted me in
mercy, to go through this faithful narrative, and unde∣ceive the world; so
that if the Divine Providence did think fit to drive me to the writing of it by
his afflicting hand, I hope it will rather add weight to the cre∣dit 
<PB N="69" REF="71"/> of it, seeing no time is fitter than this to inspire a
man with the deepest serious∣ness and sincerity. But as to me, I
still more rely on the assistance of that spirit of truth, to whose
special grace I am bound to ascribe the abhorring sense I had al∣ready
conceived against my former guilt, as well as the earnest desire and
resolution of transmitting to the world such an ac∣count of my past
guilty life, as might wholly contradict and explode that false and impious
one, which I had been induced to publish in the days of my abominable folly
and vanity. Under that Divine Guide therefore I set myself immediately
about it, and carried on daily, and with as much application as my disease
(a very violent ague and fever) would permit, not doubt∣ing but the sincerity
which I resolved, by God's assistance, should reign through the
whole, would make some amends for the lowness of stile, and other
imperfections, which, considering my weakly condition both of mind and body,
were in some measure unavoidable. Thus far I thought necessary to
apprise the reader concerning the (happy, I hope I have reason to call 
<PB N="70" REF="72"/> it) occasion of my writing the following account, which
in the name, and under the direction of that same God of truth, I now hope to
live to see finished, in or∣der to be printed, if thought worthy of it,
after my death; and I shall only add, that I am at this present time of
writing (April 22, 1728) at a friend's house in the coun∣try, free from all
study and business, or any other impediment, but what is caused by my
distemper, and shall dedicate all the time I have to spare in the writing
of it.</P>
<P>But here I hope I shall be excused from giving an account
either of my real country or family, or any thing that might cast a
reflection upon either, it being but too common, though unjust, to censure
them for the crimes of private persons, for which reason I think myself
obliged, out of respect to them, to conceal both. Out of Europe I was not
born, nor educated, nor ever travelled; but continued in some of the
southern parts of it till about the six∣teenth year of my age, when
necessity obliged me in some measure to remove into more northern ones,
though never farther northward than the Rhine in Germany, <PB N="71" REF="73"/>
or Yorkshire in England. And this I pur∣posely mention, because I have
been here∣tofore suspected to be a German, Swede or Dane by some; by
others, an English or Scotchman, as their fancy lead them, though I never
saw Germany till I was sixteen, nor England till about two or three years
after. As for my parents and relations they were Roman Catholics, and most of
them very zealous in their way, and strongly biassed against all
Protestants. My father was of an ancient, but decayed family, and had been
obliged to leave my mother before I was five years old, and to live near five
hundred miles from her, whilst she was left to live and breed me up upon
her small fortune, without re∣ceiving any assistance from him, his
mis∣fortunes having put it quite out of his power to contribute any thing;
so that I was wholly left to her care. However, nei∣ther that, nor the
narrowness of her cir∣cumstances, hindered her from giving me the best
education she could, being then her only surviving child. She was a pious
good woman in her way, and though I was no small favourite of hers, was yet 
<PB N="72" REF="74"/> kept with due strictness whilst I staid with her,
which was however but a short time, and do not remember that I had then any
the least vicious inclination, nor in all like∣lihood might have had, had I
still conti∣nued under her wing; whereas through the mismanagement of
those first persons to whose tuition I was next committed, such a
wrong foundation was laid, and so strong a biass given me to vanity and
self-conceit, as proved the unhappy source of all my sad miscarriages
since.</P>
<P>One general remark here I cannot avoid making concerning the
schools of the Roman Catholics, viz. that all their students must learn
to read, and even pray, in Latin, before they are capable of understanding
one word of it; for this doth but inure them to read and pray without any
atten∣tion, even when they are afterwards capa∣ble of understanding what they
read and pray for. This ill-timed method had been complained of by many a one
who have since felt the sad effects of it, as well as the almost
insurmountable difficulty of mastering a defect so early contracted and
so deeply rooted, as it were, in our nature, <PB N="73" REF="75"/> and none
hath had more reason to bewail it than I.</P>
<P>But what did me in particular the most hurt, in my education
abroad, was the great admiration which my more than com∣mon readiness at
learning whatever came in my way had gained me, and the im∣prudent fondness
and partiality which my masters shewed to me on that account. I was hardly
turned of six years when I was sent to a free-school taught by two
Francis∣can monks, the eldest of whom perceiving my uncommon genius for
languages, for till then I had only learned to read all sorts of print and
writings, and was besides very careless about writing a tolerable hand,
took it into his head to put me to the Latin form, though my mother and all my
friends thought me much too young for it, especially as I was to be ranked
and classed among other boys of twice my years, and who had already been at
it a year or two, and some more; however he depended so much on his
judgment, about my genius and application, that he doubted not, he said, but
to see me out-top all the rest in less than a year or two.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76"/>He was not mistaken, and though it put me to
great difficulties and hard study to reach them, I began to feel such
emotions of vanity at the quick progress I made, and the commendations he
gave me upon it, that I rested not satisfied till I had gained the first
rank in the form, as well as in his affection, for as he spared nei∣ther
caresses nor encouragement to me, I soon became sensible both by his
behaviour, as well as by the deference which the other boys paid to me, how
much I was got in his favour.</P>
<P>Our school was often visited by priests, monks, gentlemen,
and other persons that passed through our city, and though we had in it
several boys whose parents were in a much higher station, yet I was
al∣ways singled out as the flower of the flock, and as the most ready to
answer such questions as were suitable to our form. Our monk had
likewise, by way of animating us, caused some curious nicknacks to be
made by the nuns of a neighbouring mo∣nastery, which they were to wear
hanging to their button-holes, by a fine ribon, who held the first seats.
These were of several <PB N="75" REF="77"/> sizes, and one of them much
larger than the rest was for the foremost in rank. We were to be entitled
to these accord∣ing to our merit, and this last fell to my lot from the
first exercise, and so proud was I become of this bauble, that I ne∣ver
lost it for one single day; for I had such a ready and retentive memory,
and quick apprehension, as by the help of a moderate application, made it
impossible for my school-fellows to wrest it from me. This mark of
distinction did moreover en∣title me to be head monitor and marshal of that
whole school. All which filled me with such vanity and ambition to excel,
that I could not brook any superiority or preference, and our monk was but
too fond of indulging, and even encouraging me in it, though to my no small
detri∣ment, as he might easily perceive that it had given me such a
strong bias to pride, as a prudent man would have rather chosen to nip in
the bud, especially as he easily perceived that it created no small envy
in my school-fellows, and a kind of dissatisfaction in some of their
parents and relations.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78"/>He tried once indeed to thwart his par∣tiality
to me, by giving our form a new kind of exercise, the price of which to the
best performer was to be a fine piece of nun's work, which he adjudged to
an∣other, whom all the school knew to be a dunce, but in point of quality the
head of us all. Had he given it to some others of our form, who were greater
proficients in learning, I might have thought they had succeeded better in
their performance than I at that time; and though it would have been a great
mortification to me, it might have only made me double my diligence; but here
the preference was so flagrant and visible, that I could not forbear
expressing a desire to know wherein he had outdone me, and a
suspicion that he had been as∣sisted underhand by some monk or
some∣body else. When the good father found that I took the matter so to
heart, and, in some measure, threaten to bid adieu, if not to the Latin, at
least to his school; (and I believe I should really have done it, so
highly I resented what I called the in∣justice done me) he thought fit to
pacify me by assuring me, that my competitor <PB N="77" REF="79"/> had, upon
this occasion, so far excelled himself, that he could not forbear
assign∣ing him the prize by way of encourage∣ment, though my performance
was far enough from being inferior to his; and so, to put an end to the
contention, immedi∣ately sent for another piece of the same curious work,
and gave it to me, not with∣out some great encomium on my uncom∣mon diligence
and progress, and other to∣kens of his singular regard, which sent me
home so satisfied and full of myself, that, alas for me! every thing
seemed to contri∣bute to swell my growing pride, and make me forget
myself.</P>
<P>Many other such instances of his partial fondness I could
name, which all tended to make me still more assuming and arro∣gant; one
however I cannot pass by, which shall serve as a specimen: as I never
was guilty of a fault at school, so let me do what I would out of it, I was
never pu∣nished for it, as the other boys were, but had, perhaps, a soft
reprimand or some easy task assigned me by way of penance, for I
cannot call to mind that I ever had a blow or cross word from him. One day 
<PB N="78" REF="80"/> in particular, some strangers, who visited us after
dinner, obtained us a discharge for the rest of the day. We were no
sooner got out but I told my school-fellows, that we ought to go and
procure the same re∣lease to the girls of another school. Ac∣cordingly we
went and broke into the house, and drove the mistress and scho∣lars
out, and then locked the doors, that they might not be obliged to come in
a∣gain, and sent her the key at night. On the next day a severe complaint
was brought against us for the assault, and I charged as the ringleader
of the rest, upon which a suitable punishment was promised, and soon
after put in execution, in which I not only expected to have a share, but to
be the first called down to it, and yet by what partial motive I know not, I
had no other punishment than a seeming severe reprimand, and some
easy task, whilst all the rest were forced to submit to the
di∣scipline of the school. This partiality they loudly complained of, not
only to him, but to their friends; but their resentment upon it only gave me
new matter for triumph, as it did to them new cause for envy, 
<PB N="79" REF="81"/> which yet they dared not vent in any other way than
words.</P>
<P>Thus I went on learning of Latin apace, I could translate out of
it, write and speak it with great readiness, as far as I had been taught,
which was thought surprising, con∣sidering I had hardly attained my ninth
year, and been but two years under his care. The misfortune was, that he made
us only conversant with common school-books, and but with few of any of the
old classics either in prose or verse, so that I was quite
unacquainted with their stile till I came into better hands, as I soon
after did; for our good father being shortly af∣ter chosen head, or, as
they stile it, guardian of another convent, about twenty-four miles from
this, and in an archiepis∣copal city, where was also a college of Jesuits
for the education of youth, he ea∣sily prevailed upon my mother to let me go
with him thither, and to board at the monastery under his eye, whilst I
went on with my studies at the college, where he also promised to
recommend me to the care of those fathers. He likewise promised her that
he would, in the evening, make <PB N="80" REF="82"/> me repeat and explain what
I had learned in the day, and by that means push me so forward in my
learning that I should out-top all my age, all which proved such powerful
persuasives to my mother, that she easily agreed to it, especially as
he took four or five more youths with him to be on the same foot with me both
at the college and in the convent. We set out accordingly with him for the
place, and when I was introduced into the Je∣suits college, there was no
small strife what class I should be admitted into at first. Here it
will be necessary to acquaint the reader that the Jesuits distinguish
their forms, or, as they more properly stile them, classes, each of them
being kept in a se∣parate apartment, as follows, viz. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The vith, or lowest, where they begin to learn the
Latin Grammar.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 2. vth, where they perfect themselves in that, and begin
to learn some Latin books, and to make some wretched Latin.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 3. ivth, where they read Tacitus, Cicero's Epistles,
Ovid, and some other easy Ro∣man <PB N="81" REF="83"/> authors, and begin to
make better Latin.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 4. iiid, where they read Curtius, Cicero's speeches,
Virgil, and make pretty good Latin, and learn to make Latin verses. They
likewise begin here to learn the Greek Grammar.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 5. Humanity. In this class they read Ho∣race, Cicero,
Terence, make good verses, and compose some set speeches on a
subject given, and if they have a genius for it, make some considerable
progress in the Greek tongue, though they only read ho∣milies of the fathers,
and make versions out of Latin into Greek. They likewise make some set
speeches, or poetical works, before a full audience.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 6. Rhetoric. Here Homer and other Greek poets,
Demosthenes and other Greek authors, are read; together with Cicero de
Oratore, Horace's Satyres, and de Arte poetica. Themes are composed on given
subjects, as much as can be, in the Ciceronian stile and method; and
likewise poems in imitation of the Greek and Latin poets, and other books,
compiled by some of the society for the use of this class, as 
<PB N="82" REF="84"/> there are others for every class else, and every
branch of learning that is taught in them, the greatest part of which is to
be learned by heart by the scholars, as well as several other persons,
out of the classic authors, in order to exercise their memory, as is
pretended, but rather serves to clog it with a deal of unintelligible
stuff, which being sooner forgot than learned, serves to little
purpose, except it be to take up so much of their time, to the neglect of
more useful things, and more adapted to their capacities; to which I may
safely add another great inconveni∣ency, viz. that these lessons being
to be repeated to the decurions or monitors, be∣fore the regent comes in, and
an account to be given to him who hath, or who hath not learned them duely, in
order to be commended or reproved, both the scholar and the monitor are in
such haste to go through the drudgery, that those are most approved of
who can repeat theirs with the greatest speed, or rather with
precipi∣tation, by which such an habit is formed of speaking and reading
with such mon∣strous quickness, as will require a great 
<PB N="83" REF="85"/> deal of trouble and pains, to break one's self off
afterwards, if ever it is really rec∣tified, and this I found long since to
my loss, and no small grief.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 7. The last is philosophy, which they di∣vide into
logic, physics, metaphysics, and morality, each of which takes them a
quarter of a year in learning, or, at least, in expounding. Every scholar
is obliged to spend a year at least in each of the classes; and if, at
the year's end, when they are all to be separately examined, any be found
tardy, either through dul∣ness or negligence, they are condemned to go
through the same studies another year, whilst the rest, who are found
worthy, are promoted to the next class in rank.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>When I came therefore to be acquainted with the particular
studies and books of each class, and came to reflect on my be∣ing such a
stranger to the classics, I begged of my old master that I might be
offered only as candidate for the third class, where they began to be taught,
and this I should have looked upon as a favour, considering that it was
then Midsummer, and that I <PB N="84" REF="86"/> was herded as a beginner into
a class where the rest had already studied six months; so that I
thought I should have still enough to do to overtake them before the year
was out. But the good father would by no means agree to it, but insisted
upon my being examined as a candidate to huma∣nity. This, I complained, was
putting a double hardship upon me, being an utter stranger to the every
author that was read in this as well as in the other below it, and having, at
most, but seven months to master them all; he so far engaged, though
a∣gainst my will, for my overcoming all those difficulties by my genius and
application, that I was obliged to undergo the exami∣nation of a candidate for
humanity: and though my repugnance made me less soli∣citous how I went
through it, as I was so desirous to be sent down to the class be∣low
it, yet whether the old monk's inte∣rest prevailed, or my own merit gained
it, I was readily admitted into the class of humanity, and found it a very
hard tug to keep up my credit under those disad∣vantages I laboured under.
I wondered indeed how my old master could be guilty <PB N="85" REF="87"/> of
such a neglect, and often pressed him to give me his assistance,
which he trying to comply with, gave me but too fair an opportunity of
discovering the true cause of it, viz. his being as unacquainted with them
as I was. This therefore proved a very difficult class to me; and what was
still more discouraging to me was, that our regent, so they call the
person that teaches in every class, instead of making any kind allowance
for my tender years, for my being entered so late, and under such
disadvantages, often charged me with neglect and indolence, and, in a
jocose manner, threatened to leave me <HI>inter ma∣nentes,</HI> that is,
instead of raising to the next class, to leave me in this for another
year. And though I was sensible that would have been more for my advantage,
yet the shame of it was what I could not have brooked; and I thought it a
mortification more than sufficient to be ranked among the middle∣most of
his class, who had till then been used to be at the head. But this he did
rather to spur me on than to dispirit me, that I might the more easily be
admitted into the class of rhetoric against the time <PB N="86" REF="88"/>
of the yearly examination. This grand ceremony is performed a little before the
Christmas holidays, and when the scholars have learned their doom, that is,
whe∣ther to go up or to stay in the old class, they break up for ten or
twelve days, and go to their respective homes. There were at this time four
or five of my own towns∣boys, all of them not only much older, but who had
been at the college several years before me, and bore a kind of envy
against me for being admitted at once into the same class with them, and
would have been glad to have left me behind in it. This consideration, joined
to the displea∣sure such a piece of news would have been, not only to my
old master, but much more so to my mother, made me so much the more
diligent against the time of trial, and the more easily forego the
advantage of another year's humanity: for the pride and pleasure of keeping
pace with, and following them into rhetoric. Accordingly, I exerted myself
so well, and gave such satisfaction at my examina∣tion, that I was
nominated, as well as they, for that higher class. But tho' this 
<PB N="87" REF="89"/> gave me no small joy, and made me go home with a lighter
heart, yet I have had since sufficient reason to wish it had proved
otherwise; for our next regent, (the Je∣suits customs is to change them
every year, and to send new ones out of other colleges) proved a person
every way almost unquali∣fied for that high class, so that we rather went
backwards than forward under him. He essayed at first to expound some
of the Greek poets and orators by the help of the Latin versions annexed to
them, in doing which he so far betrayed his igno∣rance of that tongue, that
every one of us soon became sensible of it, which obliged him to set it
quite aside. He was not much happier in the Latin ones, though better
acquainted with them, and took at length such a disgust to the college
method, that he may justly be said to have diverted himself with teaching
us things quite op∣posite to it, and altogether foreign to our class, but
which suited his genius better.</P>
<P>It will not be amiss to observe here, that the three main
qualifications that procure admission into that society, are quality, or
high rank, learning and riches. Our good <PB N="88" REF="90"/> regent was one of
the last sort, being the son of an overgrown citizen or trades∣man, who
brought money enough into the fraternity to make amends for his want of
learning; and as this college was but an obscure one, in comparison to
those which they have in their great universities, he might be thought
perhaps good enough to teach here; at least, if he was not fit to do so
here, he could be much less so any where else. He complied however so
far with the rules of the college, and of our class, as to oblige us now and
then to make verses, themes, versions, and such low ex∣ercises; but I
soon found that he did not give himself the trouble of looking them over,
or even, for form's sake, of com∣mending or discommending our perform∣ances
according to their merit. As he was of a facetious temper, he would often so
far indulge his vein, as to entertain us for a whole hour with stories, which
were nei∣ther calculated to improve our minds, nor to make us in love with our
books. At length, quite tired, as he seemed, with the drudgery of the
college, he took it into his head to teach us heraldry, geography, and 
<PB N="89" REF="91"/> fortification, instead of the proper lessons of our
class; so that we were forced, in some measure, to exchange books for
maps, coats of arms, plans of cities, castles, &amp;c. and, at length, to
dabble with him in clay and dirt, in order to make a variety of fortifications,
with all their ap∣purtenances and proper colours; and these he took no
small pride in shewing to stran∣gers, but with this salvo, that this
was our and his employment only between the school hours, tho' we were but
too sensi∣ble that they took up likewise all our school-time, so that
some days we did no∣thing else but that, to the neglect of every other
branch of learning that was proper for our class. At length, after having
tri∣fled away near two thirds of the year, to our no small detriment, and to
my great regret, who was so far behind-hand in my my learning, I was timely
relieved, as I thought, by a letter from my mother, in∣forming me, that the
rector of a small con∣vent of Dominicans in our neighbourhood, was going to
teach philosophy to as many young gentlemen as he could get, and in∣viting me
to make one of the number. <PB N="90" REF="92"/> I readily agreed to it, the
convent being but a pleasant walk out of my native city; and though I found I
must take my leave of the classics if I went, yet I thought the learning
of philosophy would be both more creditable and useful, than the poor
stuff which our Jesuit taught us; though had I been then as well acquainted
with the subtleties of Tho. Aquinas (or rather Aristotle, for that is the
philosophy which the Dominicans teach) as I became after∣wards, I doubt
whether I should ever have been one of his disciples, at least by my
consent. However, I left the college without any further ceremony, and having
acquainted four or five of our class that were my townsboys with my
design, they soon followed me, and at our coming to the rector, we found
that he had already about twenty more, some, from a great university about
sixty miles off, others, from the neighbouring towns, several of them mere
dunces and rustics, with no other educa∣tion than a little smattering of
the Latin tongue, and not above five or six tolera∣bly qualified for the
study we were en∣gaging in. As for me, whatever my old <PB N="91" REF="93"/>
Franciscan master might depend upon as to the strength of my genius and
closeness of application, for acquiring these branches of learning I was
still wanting in, yet the discouragements which I had already en∣countered
through his mismanagement, in placing me in too high a form, as well as the
time we had trifled away in the class of rhetoric, had much abated my
thirst after learning; and the much greater dis∣appointment I met with
under this new pretended teacher of philosophy, quite com∣pleated my
misfortune, by turning it into a downright carelessness and indifference
a∣bout it. For tho' I was naturally quick enough, and assiduous at whatever
I could gain the mastery of, and applause for so doing, yet, whenever the
case proved other∣wise, no youth could be more naturally lazy and supine
than I; so that I cannot but think, on the strictest recollection I can
make, that these many discouragements so closely following one another,
were ra∣ther the cause of that deplorable indolence I since contracted for
all laudable applica∣tion to study, than my own natural tem∣per and genius,
which, had it been rightly <PB N="92" REF="94"/> directed and encouraged by
proper motives, and especially if kept under some strict dis∣cipline,
might have easily been enabled to have overcome the greatest difficulties
in almost every branch of learning: but to re∣turn to our Dominican
rector.</P>
<P>He began as usual with logic, and display∣ed a pretty good
talent at explaining it to as many of us as had a genius for it; for as to the
rest, which were near two-thirds of his school, both he and we could
easily perceive that he was only wronging them of their time and money,
though little did I think how soon that was to be my case: for though I
took his logic with such surprising quickness and delight, as to have
but one competitor, and was become a great favourite of his, by the free and
hu∣morous way in which I used to put, now and then, some puzzling
questions to him; yet when we came to the second branch, which was
Aristotle's physics, with Aquinas's comments, I found it such an
unintelligible jargon, and him so little qualified to ex∣plain it to us, that
I became quite tired with it; for some of us, especially my competitor and
I, expected at least that he <PB N="93" REF="95"/> would have made every point
as clear and evident to us, as he had before in logical lectures, and have
answered such objec∣tions as we were able to raise against ei∣ther the
doctrines, or his expositions; but, to our great surprize, we found that he
had undertaken to expound what himself did not understand, and that
Aquinas's subtilities and distinctions were as much above his reach as
above ours. Thus, for instance, Aristotle's account of the <HI>materia
prima,</HI> together with his subtile commen∣tator's expositions on it, in
which our rector spent above a fortnight, including the rubs we threw into
his way, appeared to us such an unintelligible heap of stuff, that, at our
taking leave of it, to pass to another point, we made ourselves very merry
about it, and owned ourselves as much in the dark as when he began it;
insomuch, that he was forced to own he never could thoroughly comprehend it,
and only delivered it to us on the autho∣rity of that philosopher, and of his
many eminent disciples of the Dominican order, such as Albertus Magnus,
Aquinas, &amp;c. &amp;c. I have since, upon running over his lessons 
<PB N="94" REF="96"/> more carefully, found reason to doubt whe∣ther a much
abler head than his, would not have been as much at a loss to have beat it
into any man's brain, that would not be satisfied with words without a
meaning. However, as I plainly perceiv∣ed that his chief view was to get our
mo∣ney, without troubling himself whether our progress was answerable, I
contracted by degrees such a habit of indolence and listless∣ness to
all he said (especially as he had got a singular knack at extricating
himself, when closely pressed, by some facetious joke or merry
story) that I wrote his lec∣tures, and heard his expositions, without any
attention, or offering any objection, unless it was in the jocund way, and to
enliven our drooping spirits, and without troubling myself whether what he
said or answered was right or wrong.</P>
<P>I know not whether it was not owing to his perceiving this
listlessness in us, that he began to raise our expectation and hopes
that his metaphysics, which was soon to follow, would prove more delightful
to us. We did indeed expect it, from the nature of the subjects it treats of,
and were not a little <PB N="95" REF="97"/> impatient to have this quarter
finished, that we might enter into a more entertaining field: but when we
found ourselves no less disappointed in this, it only damped our
spirits the more, and gave me a still greater dislike to the jargon of
the school, so that by that time we entered into the last quarter, when
ethics were to be the new subject of his lectures, and might have otherwise
proved more useful and en∣tertaining to us, if it had been handled by a more
proper person, we were grown so tired and out of conceit with him, that we
reaped no more benefit from it than we had from the rest; and instead of
diverting ourselves with repetitions and disputes a∣bout his lessons,
as we used to do at first, we studied to forget every subject he had
discussed to us, as soon as we were got out of his sight. Thus having
murdered, as I may say, another year, we were dis∣missed, not without
great applause and compliments to some of us, on account of our parts and
proficiency. But if I may judge of the rest by myself, to whom he was
always pleased to allow the first rank, I am sure his praises were ill
bestowed as <PB N="96" REF="98"/> to any benefit we had reaped from his pains
and ours: however, I was by that time become so great a favourite to him,
that he afterwards left no means nor ca∣resses untried to induce me to
enter into their order, and I believe, in the mind I then was in, he might
easily have prevail∣ed, had not my mother strenuously op∣posed it. I
was sensible of my deficiency in all the branches of learning I had
hi∣therto gone through, by the misconduct of those under whom I had
learned, and could easily see what dunces both my old Franciscan master
and this Dominican rec∣tor were, though they passed for able men; and where
could I better conceal my own defects and ignorance than under a monk∣ish
habit, which would, at least, give one the reputation of learning? But this I
had taken care to conceal from her, partly out of pride, and partly to prevent
her taking it to heart, and our rector had ad∣dress enough to make her
believe I was a prodigy, considering how young I still was, and to
persuade her to send me to the next university, and to learn theology
there, promising to give me such a recom∣mendation <PB N="97" REF="99"/> to
the Dominicans who taught it there, as well as the Jesuits, that no pains
should be spared to make me shine in the world. She easily consented
to it, and he gave me a certificate directed to the prior of their convent at
that great city, testifying that I had gone thro' a course of philosophy,
and was fit to be admitted a student in theology, to which he tacked some
farther commendations; all which could be of no service to me, unless I
re∣solved to go and learn under the Domini∣cans, for the Jesuits would
hardly have admitted me to that class, before I had gone a new course
through their philoso∣phy. It had been, indeed, much better for me to have
chosen the latter, consider∣ing the little proficiency I had made in it;
but my pride, and the fear of disobliging my mother, determined me to the
for∣mer, and I offered myself accordingly, and was readily admitted a
student under two very reverend rectors, the one for the morning, and the
other for the afternoon; both very grave and learned, indeed, in their way;
but, upon my first admittance, the school appeared to me like a new world, 
<PB N="98" REF="100"/> where I was looked upon as a little raw strippling, too
young quite, in all appear∣ance, to herd among the rest of the stu∣dents,
some of whom were twice my age, and none by many years so young as I. What
was still more discouraging was, that here was no distinction made
between those who had already studied near two years (for the whole
course of theology lasts two whole years) and those who were but newly
admitted. The same lectures were read and expounded to all alike, and in the
usual course, so that those who came not at the very beginning, had no
other chance, but at the end, to put middle and both ends together as well as
they could, which made the old standers assume such an over∣bearing air
over the new ones, as was alto∣gether mortifying, at least it proved so to
me, who never had, till then, seen my school-fellows so much above
me.</P>
<P>I may fairly date the completion of my ruin from the time of my
coming to this populous place, on more accounts than one: for first, the city
was a noble, great one, full of gentry and nobility, of coaches, and all kinds
of grandeur, all which did greatly <PB N="99" REF="101"/> affect me, who had
never seen so much by far of the beau monde, neither in my native city, nor
in the archiepiscopal one, where I had studied under the Jesuits. 2dly, I
had been already cloyed with Aquinas's philosophy, when I had no such
bright tempting objects dancing before my eyes, what likelihood could there be
that such a school as this, should reconcile me to the more refined and
unintelligible sub∣tilities of his theology, especially consider∣ing the
disadvantages we late comers were forced to labour under, and the high
state which our two rectors took upon them? for here was no room for
objecting, or even desiring a point or a term to be explained, and we had
nothing to do but to write what they dictated, and take their exposi∣tions
for sound doctrine. Even those who had studied longest under them, and
were looked upon as the brightest, were not in∣dulged to start a
difficulty, though the oc∣casion was ever so fair; all which damped my
spirits, who had never been used to such a restraint, and had,
moreover, the mortification to see myself placed in the lowest rank, who
had, till then, been <PB N="100" REF="102"/> mostly at the head, that I grew
by degrees quite out of conceit both with myself and with the school. What
added still more to my discontentedness was, that I boarded at some
near relations in one of the suburbs of the city, and at a great distance
from the convent, and these commonly dined so late, that I must either
take up with an irregular meal, or come near an hour after the rest to the
school. I did indeed pre∣fer the first for some time, but grew by degrees
weary of it, as the study I was upon grew less engaging to me; so that
though I took up as little time as I could at my dinner, yet one half hour, at
least, was lost by it, and our rector had dictated some pages of matter
to the rest, which, after school was over, I used to copy out of the
manuscripts of some of my school-fellows. Our rector having more than
once observed what irregular hours I kept, was so kind as to give me a
civil repri∣mand, and not expecting, perhaps, a re∣ply to it, was going on with
his lecture, but I had been so little used to make answers to it in dumb
show, as I observed many of his hearers were forced to do, that I 
<PB N="101" REF="103"/> bluntly told him the occasion, assuring him, that
I had not influence enough in the family to prevail on them to alter their
hours.</P>
<P>The good father not approving of my ex∣cuse, which plainly
shewed that I could not forego my dinner for his lessons, and might be an
ill precedent to some of the rest, seemed rather inclined to lay the
fault on my being better pleased with those late hours of dining, or else
he thought I might easily persuade my relations to alter their method on my
account. But whether so or not, he insisted, and reasonably enough,
that I should conform to the school-hours, whatever inconveniency it might
put me as to my dinner. I was sensible of the justness of his reproof,
and after having been often at high words with my relati∣ons (for they were
fully paid for my board) to no purpose, and tried to conform to the
school-hours for some time, I grew weary of it, and having nobody to
controul me, which proved my greatest misfortune, I quite forsook the
afternoon lectures, and spent that time in sauntring about the city and
country adjacent, viewing the build∣ings, <PB N="102" REF="104"/> and
sometimes taking plans and vis∣toes of such places as pleased me, but
without any other design than to divert myself. I was, however,
surprised soon after, to find myself interrogated by our morning
professor, about the reason of my not coming to the afternoon lectures.
Whether my quondam master of philoso∣phy had wrote any thing particularly
con∣cerning his expectation of getting me into their order or not, I knew not,
but I was in a genteel manner given to understand by this, that I ought to
look on it as a sin∣gular favour that they so far concerned themselves
about me. What answer I made him, besides my thanking him for his care, I
cannot recollect; but though we parted good friends, I soon after forsook
his lecture also, and from that time minded little else but my own
pleasures, which, though altogether of the innocent kind, sometimes with
the fair sex, at other times in viewing the curiosities of the place, or
making solitary excursions, and the like; yet were not without some
pungent remorse, as they tended to little else but to inure me to a habit
of indolence and careless <PB N="103" REF="105"/> inactivity. At some
intervals, indeed, I tried to read over all my manuscripts both in
philosophy and theology, but still so dis∣gusted with them, that I
never had the pa∣tience to go through them.</P>
<P>I had before this sent some complaining letters to my mother,
as well as messages by word of mouth by some of my towns∣men, who had
been witnesses of the bad hours we kept, and to whom I had re∣lated the
inconveniency it had put to, with relation to my studies; and she, good
wo∣man, thinking that I took it more to heart than I did, sent me a small
supply to con∣vey me to Avignon, where I was to meet an old rich counsellor
of our town, who was gone to spend some time in that famed city. He had no
children of his own, but some nephews, one of which he designed to breed up
a scholar under me, in consi∣deration of which I was to lodge and board
with the uncle, till I could better provide for myself. As this was likely to
be a kind of change for the better for me, as well as an easement to my
mother, whose strait circumstances could hardly permit her to be at
such expence for my education, I <PB N="104" REF="106"/> made no delay to go
down to Avignon, where I found the old gentleman ready to receive me, and, a
day or two after, en∣tered into my new office of tutor to his nephew, who had
already made some pro∣gress in the Latin Grammar. I had not been long there
before I got acquainted with a young abbé, or candidate for priestly
orders, a countryman of mine, and an in∣genious young man, of some learning;
and he finding that I had studied philosophy and theology under the
Dominicans, in∣troduced me to one of their professors in this city, by whom
I was courteously re∣ceived, and soon after admitted to be one of his
disciples. This father, who was a man of singular modesty and humanity,
and was reputed a saint, paid me an un∣common regard upon my first
admission to his lectures, and made an apology to the rest of his
scholars for recapitulating some of his former lessons and
expositions, <HI>in gratiam,</HI> as he was pleased to word it,
<HI>charissimi nostri novi discipuli,</HI> that I might the better
understand what he was then, and afterwards, to deliver to us. This great
condescension, which had not been <PB N="105" REF="107"/> shewed to me by
either of the professors of the last university, and which I since
understood was not usual among them, did highly oblige me, and I would have
been glad to have made such a proficiency under him, as might have, in some
mea∣sure, answered his singular kindness to me, which he still
continued to express all the time I went to hear him, but my misfor∣tune was,
that I was still so unacquainted as well as disgusted at the
subtilities of the school, and met with such crampt distinc∣tions and
technical terms I was still a stranger to, and was ashamed to ask the
meaning of from any of the scholars, who were far enough from thinking me
so great a novice to the language of the Thomists, that I began again, in
spite of all his ca∣resses, and my own eager desires, to de∣spair of
ever becoming a theologian; and these difficulties added to the lazy and
unthinking habit I had so long indulged, made me at length forbear going any
more to hear him.</P>
<P>I have already hinted that my mother's cir∣cumstances were too
narrow for the expence I had already put her to, and my father 
<PB N="106" REF="108"/> was still more unable to give her any
assist∣ance in it, though he was not a little pleased at the great
progress he was told I had made for my years. Her hopes and mine were,
indeed, that I might by that means introduce myself as a tutor into some
good family, and save her all farther charges. But I had been so far
neglected in the o∣ther parts of my education, had so little address or
politeness, and knew so little of the world, that I could not look upon
myself as fit for such an employment a∣mong persons above the common
rank, and my pride would not let me aim at any thing below it; so that
instead of trying as I might, and ought to have done, I was rather become
careless and indifferent a∣bout it, and I was indeed both too young and too
naturally unfit for it. Notwith∣standing which, some of my acquaintance,
unknown or undesired, got me into a mid∣dling family, where I was upon
somewhat better terms than with my old counsellor; but the overgrown youth,
who was put under my care, and was much older, and taller by the head and
shoulders than I, had, by that time, contracted such an in∣dolence, 
<PB N="107" REF="109"/> or rather averseness, both to the Latin tongue, and
to other laudable studies, that had I been ever so diligent in teach∣ing
him, it would have been to little pur∣pose, because, as I soon found, he
wanted parts as well as inclination for study; so that we spent more of
our time in play∣ing on the violin and flute than at our books. His mother, who
heard us at it longer and oftner than she thought was consistent with the
progress she expected him to make under me, complained more than once of it
to me; upon which I made no difficulty to tell her, that a greater degree of
application would rather confirm him in his averseness, than reconcile him
to his study, as he had so small a capacity for it. I left this soon
after for a better place with a person of distinction, who in∣trusted two
sons of his to my care, both very young, and spoiled by the mother, that
the eldest, above seven years of age, could but just read, and neither of
them inclined to learn. I tried what I could to bring them to it, but to little
purpose, ex∣cept a little history, which the eldest took more freely to,
but the mother's indul∣gence <PB N="108" REF="110"/> was not the only
obstacle, and as she was a sprightly lady, and her spouse somewhat
heavy, though not old, I soon found by her behaviour, and her parting beds
with him soon after my coming, that she would have been better pleased I
had transferred my care from them to her; and as I was naturally fond of
ingratiating myself with the sex, I indulged her in all her little foibles,
but without having the least design of going farther than a bare
complaisance, in order to gain her esteem and admiration, rather than her
affection, and to satisfy my own vanity, rather than cherish a dangerous
passion for her. This made me to take frequent occasions to re∣commend
myself by false merit, since I had no real one that could do it, by
pre∣tending to more virtue and religion than I had, and to palliate the low
circumstances of my parents by some vain excuses, and pretences, all
which I did with so little caution, and in so aukward a manner, as made me
appear rather more despicable in her eyes, considering the mean appearance
I made, and which was owing chiefly to my own negligence and bad oeconomy. 
<PB N="109" REF="111"/> All these disadvantages, however, might have been
easily overlooked, and I might have been readily suffered to indulge my own
prevailing passion, if I could but have shewed more concern for hers.</P>
<P>It is not my design to dwell on such scenes as these, much
less to ascribe my neglect and overlooking the several distant offers
made by so agreeable a person to my own virtue. I might more justly
impute it to my natural sheepish bashfulness, and un∣experienced youth;
however, after a six month's stay, and some visible proofs that it was
not in my power to conquer it, I perceived a strange coldness to succeed,
which made me think it would not be long before I was discharged. She was
soon after visited by some relations, who per∣suaded her to go and
spend some part of the summer with them about twenty miles off. They,
especially the gentlemen, af∣fected the air of libertines, and all of them
expressed a singular contempt for the su∣perstitions of the church of
Rome, by which I guessed them to be concealed Pro∣testants, of whom there
were great num∣bers in Languedoc, Provence, Dauphinee, <PB N="110" REF="112"/>
and I have had since reason to think, that my young lady was so
likewise, by her light behaviour at church, and on other occasi∣ons. I had
some small disputes with them, being then very zealous for that church,
but they knowing that I had studied divi∣nity, and fearing, I suppose,
lest too ea∣ger an opposition to what I urged against them should
cause a discovery, they de∣clined entering the list with me any far∣ther,
and I then found, for the first time, that the Protestants had more to
say for themselves than I had ever imagined; for the divinity we were
taught at the schools seldom meddled with the controversies be∣tween us
and the Protestants, so that had it not been for fear, those gentlemen, I
found, might easily have foiled me, not∣withstanding all my theology. The
lady was preparing for her journey, and was to take her sons with her, yet
kept me in suspense whether I was to accompany her, or stay with her
husband, or be discharged. I have had reason to think since, that she
had an end in it; but finding my behavi∣our still aukward and unpromising,
not∣withstanding some fresh essays, which I <PB N="111" REF="113"/>
did not then so well comprehend, she left it to her husband, who was a
person that cared for nothing but his bottle, and left her to do as she
pleased in every thing else, to acquaint me with the news that they
should have no farther occasion for me. I was more grieved than
surprised at it, which, she perceiving, occasioned one more snare to
be laid by means of the chambermaid, which proving still unsuc∣cessful,
and this was the very night before they were to set out, I was despised
and laughed at, and given to understand, that I might thank myself if the
lady and I went different ways.</P>
<P>I have already hinted that virtue and reli∣gion had little or no
share in my disap∣pointing her, but rather a vanity of being thought more
chaste than I really was, which kept me so indeed, as to the act, not only
on this, but many other ren∣counters, though in heart and thought few men were
more strangers to that vir∣tue than I, even at those tender years; and
though religion, which, in all my foolish extravagancies, I never once lost
sight of, held still some check on my mind, yet <PB N="112" REF="114"/> it
could hardly turn even the scale against any favourite passion of mine,
farther than to make me condemn myself after having yielded to it; so that
it was rather the fear of a repulse, or some other or worse
con∣sequence that kept me from shewing an equal ardor for her, whatever
opinion my different behaviour might give her of me. The company and she were
no sooner gone than I took the road to Avignon, where I heard that my old
counsellor was gone home, with his nephews, to my no small grief,
especially as my pockets were then low; the widow where we had boarded very
poor, and I had so few acquaintance in that city; however, I ven∣tured to
stay with her till I could write to my mother for a fresh supply, or till
some∣thing better fell in my way, though I had little reason to expect any
success from ei∣ther; being by this time become very shabby in cloaths
and linnen, and more indolent and inactive than ever. To ward off, as much as
possible, the pungent mor∣tification of my present circumstances, I had
recourse to my old stratagem, of cloath∣ing myself with some false
merit for want <PB N="113" REF="115"/> of a great one, and of pretending to be a
sufferer for religion for a too great attach∣ment to the church, and laying
most of the blame on my own father, as using me the more severely on that
account; all which, though abominably false in every respect, yet being too
easily listened to by some of my acquaintance, especially among the
friars, did gain me so much pity and admiration, as soothed my vanity for
the present, though it did not answer the main end I proposed, its
introducing me into some new family as a tutor, and at the same time
accounting, in some tolera∣ble measure, for the mean appearance I then
made.</P>
<P>I was about the same time informed that the famed fair of
Baucaire, a city in Lan∣guedoc, on the Rhone, and one of the largest fairs in
Europe, was at hand, and that among the great concourse at it, I might meet
with some of my own towns∣men, from whom I might get a fresh sup∣ply. I
went accordingly, and found there several merchants of my acquaintance, who
furnished me with as much money for the present, as would just serve,
but, on the <PB N="114" REF="116"/> next day, when I expected to have re∣ceived
a much larger sum, I only met with a severe reprimand for my mean
ap∣pearance, and for not having made a better use of the opportunities I had
had of dis∣charging my mother from all future ex∣pences on my account. I
excused it as well as I could to them, they being no strangers to the great
poverty, not to say universal misery, that then reigned at A∣vignon,
where the streets abounded with people, who, from living very comforta∣bly,
and some of them richly, on the silk manufacture of the place, were, on the
decay of it, reduced to the lowest degree of beg∣gary. They told me, that
though that was too truly the case of the tradesmen, yet the priests and
monks lived in as much plenty as ever, and a lad of my parts and learning might
easily have found means to have recommended himself to some of them,
instead of appearing in such a guise as I did, and which they said made
them apprehensive I had taken up some ill courses. This censure, which
was no less unjust than severe, if they spoke what they thought, did
cut me to the heart; for no <PB N="115" REF="117"/> youth could be more free
from the vices of drinking, gaming, intriguing, &amp;c. than I was. Happy it
would have been for me if I could have as easily disculpated myself from
those of indolence, vanity, and bad oeconomy; for these were the true
sources of my misfortunes, insomuch that I am persuaded, if they had
supplied me with as great a sum, as I could in reason have desired, I
should have been induced to have laid out the greatest part of it in such
curious nicknacks and trifles as that fair affords, especially of the
musi∣cal kind; for I had already, in that short interval, agreed for a good
number of them; but whether they had set any body to watch my motions, and
guessed at the preposterous use I should make of what money they
might lend me, or whatever other reason they might have, they abso∣lutely
refused to let me have even so much as would bring me back to Avignon; so
that one may easily imagine the dismal plight I was in all the way thither,
to say nothing of that mortification I should meet with among my
acquaintance there at my ill success. I found, however, a plausible 
<PB N="116" REF="118"/> excuse for it, by pretending that I was come a day or
two too late, and that the merchants were, by that time, so short of cash
that they could not supply me, but that they would remit me what I wanted
soon after their return home. I likewise told my old landlady, to whom I
was hardly indebted for a quarter of a year's board and lodging, that I
expected two of them to be there shortly at an approaching fair, which was
actually true, and she knew and dealt with one of them for some sort of
goods, so that had I had the pa∣tience to have staid till then, my mother,
who had expressed no small resentment at their ungenerous refusal,
would not have failed sending me a fresh supply by them; whereas, hearing
that I had left the place, she sent only what would pay the poor wo∣man,
whilst I, unknown to her, or any one else, had taken a resolution to
return home, bare as I was of money and cloaths.</P>
<P>I lately took notice of my shameful pre∣tence of being a kind of
sufferer for reli∣gion, to some of my acquaintance, and tho' vanity and my
then ill plight was my only incentive to it, I began now to think 
<PB N="117" REF="119"/> it might be made a means of facilitating my long journey
homewards; I went ac∣cordingly and furnished myself with a kind of pass,
or certificate, at a proper office, signifying that I was a young student
in theology, of Irish extract, and that I had left the country for the sake
of religion, by which is commonly implied the Ro∣man Catholic, and that I was
then going on a pilgrimage to Rome. This absurd and false assertion
cost me since many a shameful lye to make it pass for current,
especially as often as I met with any per∣sons who had any tolerable
knowledge of Irish affairs, to which I was an utter stranger. I did,
indeed, know several English and Irish, who had followed king James's
fortune, and were well respected in France, Italy, &amp;c. but my vanity
could not be satisfied with the credit of passing for the son of some
one of them; I wanted to have it thought my own voluntary act, that I forsook
that country and my parents, and fortune, for the sake of religion. Had the
secretary, from whom I had procured that certificate, been ever so little
diffident, my very name, which had nothing of Irish <PB N="118" REF="120"/> or
English, but which my pride would not let me forego, because it had
something of quality in it, would easily have disco∣vered the roguery of
the pretence; and this I mention to shew my rashness and ignorance, of
which I shall give a fur∣ther instance, in the method I took immediately
after obtaining the pass, to equip myself in a pilgrim's garb; for I was
not in a condition to purchase one, tho' it consisted only of a long
staff handsomely turned, and a short leathern or oil-cloth cloak, not
unlike what the women call a pelerine. However, I had observed such a one
in a chapel belonging to a parish-church, and dedicated to a miraculous
saint, which, I suppose, had been set up there as a monument of
gratitude by some wan∣dering pilgrim come to the end of his jour∣ney. The
chapel was never without a number of devotees, who prayed and burnt tapers
before the image of the saint; but this did not deter me from venturing in,
and taking both staff and cloak away at noon-day; had I been examined about
it, I was only furnished with a juvenile pre∣tence, that I looked upon it to
be set up <PB N="119" REF="121"/> there to accommodate such pilgrims as
could not otherwise provide themselves with it. How far such a poor
excuse might have gone I know not, neither did I trouble my head about it;
however, I escaped without such an enquiry, and carried it off
unmolested, and made what haste I could to some private corner, where I
threw the cloak over my shoulders, and walked with a sanctified gravity
with the staff in my hand, till I was got out of the city.</P>
<P>Being thus accoutred, and furnished with a pass to my mind, I
began at all proper places to beg my way in a fluent Latin; accosting only
clergymen, or persons of figure, by whom I could be under∣stood, and was
most likely to be relieved; and I found them mostly so generous and
credulous, that had I had the least propen∣sity to provide for hereafter, I
might easily have saved a good deal of money, and put myself into a much
more creditable garb, before I had gone through a score or two of miles; but
such was my vanity and ex∣travagance, that as soon as I had got what I
thought a sufficient viaticum, I begged no more, but viewed every thing worth
<PB N="120" REF="122"/> seeing, then retired to some inn, where I spent my
money as freely as I got it, not without some such aukward tokens of
generosity, as better suited with my vanity than my present
circumstances. The nearer I drew to my native place, the more irre∣solute I
grew, whether I should pay a vi∣sit to my mother, or continue my journey to
Rome; the concern I knew she must be in about me, strongly inclined me to
the former, but my uncommon mean garb, which was become only more scandalous
by the length of the journey, made me so ashamed to be seen either by
her, or any of my friends, that I fully resolved on the latter. I had, in
order to it, wheeled a∣bout to the left, to leave the place at some twenty or
thirty miles distance, and was got into a small town where I little
ex∣pected to be known, when venturing on the Sunday into the church, at the
time of high mass, I was surprised to see some persons,
especially two or three gentle∣women, whose chief residence was at my
native city, but who it seems were spending part of the summer at that
place, and who, in spight of my being thus <PB N="121" REF="123"/>
transmogrified, did easily recall me to mind, and gave me to understand
they did. I was so shocked at it, that I left the church at the most
solemn part of the service, when they were most intent on their
de∣votions, not caring to stand an examen from them, and made the best of
my way through private paths, to avoid being caught if pursued. Whether I was
so I know not, but the sight of them made such a strong impression
on my mind, and raised such an earnest desire in me of seeing once
more that beloved city, especially considering that it was now
impossible to conceal either my way of travelling, or mean appearance from
my friends, that as soon as I thought myself out of the reach of a
pursuit, I took the direct road home∣ward, with an intent to go and satisfy
my poor anxious mother, before she got the intelligence from other hands, and
consult with her, whether I should pursue my journey to Rome, or get into
any other way she liked better. And I only took care to enter the city in the
dusk of the even∣ing, and got to her house unperceived by any but those of
the family.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124"/>My poor mother was glad to see me, tho'
sorry to behold the mean garb I was in, and failed not, though with her
usual ten∣derness, to chide me, for having made so bad an use of the
opportunities, she sup∣posed I had had, of pushing my fortune, which,
she knew as well as I, was but too much owing to my indolence. Much more
reason would she have had to chide me, had she known how much of my time
I had trifled away during the last year and half I had been absent from
her; but that I concealed from her, and the good woman was sometimes inclined
to think, that my too great eagerness after my studies had made me neglect
every thing else. But I was greatly surprised at the end of two or three
days, during which I had kept as much from sight as I could, to hear her
propose to me, since I had found out so cheap, safe, and easy a way
of travelling, to go and pay a visit to my father, who then lived some
hun∣dreds of miles from her, and try what I could get him to do for me; and I
had the more reason to wonder at her propo∣sal, because she knew, as
well as I, that a <PB N="123" REF="125"/> tradesman of our town, who had been
with him about two or three years before, had brought us a very indifferent
account of his circumstances. This made me su∣spect that a cousin of
mine, and a great fa∣vourite of hers, whose fortune was in no wise
suitable to his high spirit, had put that strange project in her head,
that I might be far enough out of the way of obstructing her kindness to
him. Whe∣ther there was any real foundation for my suspicion, I cannot
say, but the surprize she observed me to be in at her proposal, made
such an impression upon her, that she forgot nothing that could
assure me of her maternal and unalterable tenderness, alledging that
she only wanted to be bet∣ter satisfied of the condition my father was in,
than she was from the report of the tradesman above mentioned, and adding,
that in case I found it not to my liking, and him as tender as I might
expect, she charged me expressly to leave him, and come back to her as
soon as possible, and by no means to stay longer than a year from her,
unless I could convince her that it was very much to my advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126"/>Being thus far satisfied of her maternal
af∣fection, I easily consented to take the journey, having by that time
contracted an inclination to ramble and see new coun∣tries, and as it was a
long and dangerous one, we thought it improper to alter my dress, the
meaness of which would rather be a safeguard; however, she thought fit to
sew up a small quantity of gold to my cloaths, which, she said, would
serve to buy me some better ones, when I came near the end of my journey.
My staff and cloak, with the addition of a long loose gown, made of a light
kind of black buck∣ram to cover the rest from dust, were sent by a man to
a place on the road, about four miles off; and very early in the morn∣ing I
took a sorrowful leave of my mo∣ther, and she of me, and she repeated her
charge to me to return to her, if I did not find things to my satisfaction.
When I came to the place where my pilgrim's dress waited for me, I put it on,
and went on not without a heavy heart, tho' with∣out the least doubt of my
mother's con∣stant affection. My direct rout was thro' the first great
university where I had be∣gan <PB N="125" REF="127" MS="y"/> to study
theology, so that I was forced to wheel about to avoid it, for fear of being
known. All the rest of the way I was an utter stranger to, and I met
frequently with some objects that made me shrink, tho' it was a
considerable high road; now and then at some lonely place lay the carcase
of a man rotting and stinking on the ground by the way-side, with a rope
about his neck, which was fastened to a post about two or three yards
distance, and these were the bodies of highwaymen, or rather of
sol∣diers, sailors, mariners, or even galley-slaves, disbanded after
the peace of Res∣wick, who, having neither home nor occu∣pation, used to
infest the roads in troops, plunder towns and villages, and when ta∣ken were
hanged at the county-town by dozens, or even scores sometimes, after which
their bodies were thus exposed a∣long the highway <HI>in terrorem.</HI> At
other places one met with crosses, either of wood or stone, the highest
not above two or three feet, with inscriptions to this pur∣port; 
<Q REND="inline">"pray for the soul of A. B. or of a stranger
that was found murdered on this spot."</Q> These deterring objects made me 
<PB N="126" REF="128"/> willing to associate myself to some
fel∣low-travellers whom I met on the same road; but such was my vanity,
that I never renewed the pilgrim's trade of begging whilst any of my money
lasted, but was rather lavish of it on some of them, tho' I know not how
soon I might feel the want of it; and I had not resumed it long before I
met with such a mortification as made me heartily repent of my folly. I was
to go through the celebrated city of Lyons, abounding with the finest
buildings and other curiosities, which I was very de∣sirous to see; and
when I came to one of the gates, was asked by an officer, in a li∣very like our
beadles, whether I wanted a viaticum? Not knowing the consequence of his
question, I answered in the affirmative, and was bid immediately to follow
him. I was surprised at the length of the way he led me, and observed
several fine churches, palaces, squares, &amp;c. which I stood still to
admire, but was not suffered to do so long; and at length, after about an
hour and half's good walking, was told, that that was the opposite gate at
which I was <PB N="127" REF="129"/> to go out and pursue my journey; he then
clapped a couple of pence into my hand, and told me, that I must not venture
back into the city under some severe punish∣ment, and left me quite
astonished and unable to reply. As soon as I had reco∣vered myself, I
began to reflect on my ex∣travagance and disappointment in a most lively
manner, but thought it best, how∣ever, to follow his advice, rather than
ex∣pose myself to some shameful treatment, if I attempted to return.
What increased my concern was, the fear of finding the same method
observed in every great city I came to, but, happily for me, it proved
otherwise, and I not only went through them all without molestation, but
staid in some of them long enough to view every thing worth seeing, and
to converse with men of learning and piety, from whom I received some
tokens of their generosity.</P>
<P>The misfortune was, that my rashness and vanity would not
suffer me to keep within due bounds, but I must set myself off to the
highest advantage, by pretending to greater merit and learning than was
consist∣ent <PB N="128" REF="130"/> even with common prudence, as it
ex∣posed me to the continual danger of a shame∣ful discovery. I took
notice heretofore how little progress I had made in the Greek tongue, rather
through the igno∣rance and neglect of some of my teachers, than want of
capacity or application, but now I pretended to be not only master of it, but
likewise in some measure of the Hebrew, though I knew not a single
let∣ter of the latter, and had only seen some Hebrew books belonging to the
Jews of Avignon, by which I just could distinguish that from other
characters; the truth is, that neither that nor any of the oriental tongues,
nor even the Greek, were much studied by the clergy; so I was not under any
great danger on that account, though I own I have been sometimes foiled at
the latter, because I commonly addressed myself to the priests, among
whom I met, now and then, with one who understood it. I must also
acknowledge that I found the generality of them very charitable, and some of
them even generous, though it the more redounds to my shame, seeing neither
the meanness of my garb, of <PB N="129" REF="131"/> which yet I was not a
little ashamed, nor the mortifying accidents that had happened to me could
prevail upon me to save a shil∣ling towards buying any thing better. I had
indeed some hopes to do so, as I came nearer to my father, but here I was
again justly disappointed; the two or three last provinces I was to
pass through, hav∣ing been greatly impoverished, and even laid waste by
the late war, so that I found the clergy here less rich and generous, and
so great poverty reigned among the laity, that I had much ado to get
sufficient sub∣sistance among them. I should likewise observe
here, that every town, or even village I came through, had a number of
Lutherans and Calvinists, who were still in a worse condition, insomuch
that their ministers were obliged to keep some poor inn or alehouse for
subsistance; so that by that time I had reached my father I was quite
pennyless and threadbare. I pre∣sently, however, made myself known to
him, though to his great surprise, not only on that account, but as it was
such an un∣expected visit, of which he had not had the least notice given
him, nor did at all <PB N="130" REF="132"/> dream of. The city where I met him
be∣ing about three or four miles from his house, he clapped a small piece
in my hand, and directed me to a house where I might get some
refreshment, and towards night conducted me to his own home, which I was not
a little surprised to find even meaner than our townsman had described
to my mother and me. Here he bid me a fresh and most tender welcome, and
ex∣pressed such a visible concern that he was not able to give me at
least as good enter∣tainment as I had been used to with my mother, that I
was hardly able to make him a proper answer.</P>
<P>And indeed the difference I found between the two places, the
forlorn condition I saw myself in, the mean figure I made in an obscure
kind of village, my being now not only out of the way of any improvement, but
in danger of losing what I had got, afforded me such a dismal prospect,
that I could not easily conceal my uneasiness, and, in a little time, a
more than ordinary desire of returning to my old home, since this new one
was in every respect so little inviting to me. He found it no less
diffi∣cult <PB N="131" REF="133"/> to conceal his dislike of my returning to
my mother, and tried all he could to dissuade me from it. He advised me
to try my fortune at two or three neighbour∣ing cities or universities, and I
complied with his desire, but found much greater discouragements than I
could expect: first, the Jesuits were the teachers in all of them, and I
had studied with the Dominicans, between whom and them there never was a
right understanding, but rather quite the contrary. I was got into a new
country, (Germany) where the pronunciation of the Latin differed so much from
that I had been used to, that though no one could speak it more fluently
than I, I neither could understand them, nor make myself understood by
them, without the greatest difficulty. The country had been so ruin∣ed by
the war, that those few mendi∣cant scholars that remained in those
uni∣versities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Most of the universities of Germany
have a number of these mendicant students, who, as soon as the
school-hours are over, go along the streets from house to house,
sing∣ing some pious Latin verses to excite people's charity, and, in
some opulent cities, get enough to live well and comfortably, and to buy all
the books that are necessary for them, by which means some of them become
very learned men, and get to good preferment; but as it was quite otherwise
in these, and, indeed, every city along the Rhine, quite down below the great
city of Cologn (where the French forces had caused such dreadful
delapidations as could not be seen without horror); these universities
had been long since forsaken by all those mendicant stu∣dents, who
could no longer find means of subsisting them. And this I afterwards
observed to be the case in every place where the French troops had been, as
I may have further occasion to shew in the sequel.</NOTE>, might be
rather said to starve than <PB N="132" REF="134"/> to subsist. My
youth and ignorance of the German tongue, as well as my foreign pronunciation
of the Latin and Greek, would likewise have disqualified me for being a
tutor in any family, had there been any in a condition to have maintained one;
so that after all my efforts, which I rather tried out of obedience to my
fa∣ther, than any likely hopes I could have of success, I returned to him
<HI>re infecta,</HI> all which only served to revive my desires of
returning to my mother. But he being still as averse to it as ever,
bethought him∣self of a new way to dissuade me from it, and with so
much art at the same time, that I could not discover his aim. He had seen
the greatest part of Europe, and <PB N="133" REF="135" MS="y"/> could give an
extraordinary account of it; he understood several of its languages,
particularly the Italian, French, Spanish and German, and expatiated much on
the advantages he had gained by travelling; and expressed, at some
distance, a desire that I should visit several of those coun∣tries
I had not yet seen, particularly those of Holland, Flanders, and Brabant,
which he highly commended for their opulence, and the great number of learned
men they produced, and expatiated much on their hospitality, generosity,
and fondness for men of parts and genius, and how greatly I might be admired
and promoted there on account of my learning, knowledge of languages and
sciences, and for having al∣ready travelled through so many consider∣able
parts of the world, all which he said was the more surprising, as I was
still so very young, for I was then hardly full six∣teen years old. He
could not indeed have found a more effectual way than that of soothing my
vanity, to make me give wholly into his views, and as to the objection of the
want of money, consi∣dering how well acquainted I was with the 
<PB N="134" REF="136"/> way of travelling at free-cost, he said I could not
but promise myself much better success through those countries, where
the peoples generosity was equal to their known opulence.</P>
<P>I was now (unknown to him) to think of some more cunning,
safe, and effectual way of travelling than that I had followed in my two
former journies; and since I found that my passing for an Irishman and
a sufferer for religion, did not only expose me to the danger of being
disco∣vered, but came short of the merit and admiration I had expected from
it, I re∣solved on a new project, which, though equally hazardous, I had not
sense enough to foresee, and tho' still more dishonest, I had not
virtue enough to deter me from. I say, unknown to my father, for I had
carefully concealed all the vile indirect pretences I had already used, and
much more was I now obliged to do so, know∣ing him to be so upright and
religious a man, that I should not only have incurred his utmost anger, but
that he would like∣wise have taken all possible means to have deterred me
from, or disappointed me in <PB N="135" REF="137"/> it. I recollected, that
whilst I was learn∣ing humanity, rhetoric and geography with the Jesuits, I
had heard them speak of the East-Indies, China, Japan, &amp;c. and
ex∣patiate much in praise of those countries, and the ingenuity of the
inhabitants. The idea they had given us of them was indeed too general and
imperfect, at least what I remembered of it, was by far too short and
confused, for a person of the least pru∣dence or forecast to have built
such a wild project upon, because all the notion they had given us of it,
was only from their maps and comments upon them, for they made use of
geographical books. However, I was rash enough to think, that what I wanted
of a right knowledge of them, I might make up by the strength of a pregnant
invention, in which I flat∣tered myself I might succeed the more easily,
as I supposed they were so little known by the generality of Europeans,
that they were only looked upon, in the lump, to be Antipodes to them in
almost every respect, as religion, manners, dress, &amp;c. This was my
crude notion of the matter, which I thought afforded a vast 
<PB N="136" REF="138"/> scope to a fertile fancy to work upon, and I had no
mistrust of myself on that head. I had likewise heard that their way of
writ∣ing differed very much from ours, but how, and in what, I was altogether
igno∣rant, or had quite forgot it, and so took it into my head, that like the
Hebrew, and other oriental tongues I had heard of, they must write from the
right to the left, and on this puerile supposition, I set about
ex∣cogitating of an alphabet that might an∣swer my purpose. Another thing
that shewed my inconsiderate folly was, that tho' I could not but know that
the Greeks and Hebrews had particular names for their letters, it never came
once into my head to imitate them in that, as I had in the figures, powers,
&amp;c. of some of the letters on a supposition, that as they might flow
originally from the same fountain, so they might be reasonably imagined
to re∣tain still some kind of resemblance. The truth is, my time was
short, and know∣ledge in what I went about so very small and confused,
and what I did was by stealth, and fear of being detected by my father; that
I was soon after made sensible of my <PB N="137" REF="139"/> want of
forecast, when I came to con∣verse with proper judges, and found the
necessity not only of inventing names for the letters, but to make
several amend∣ments to my wild scheme, as I became better acquainted with
those Eastern coun∣tries.</P>
<P>However, considering my tender years, small experience, and
other such disad∣vantages, I have had since no small cause to wonder
how I could excogitate not only such an alphabet, and names of letters, but
likewise many other particulars e∣qually difficult, such as a
considerable piece of a new language and grammar, a new division of the
year into twenty months, a new religion, &amp;c. and all out of my own head, in
order to stuff them into that most abominable romance which I published
soon after my coming into Eng∣land, and which occasioned such variety of
opinions concerning it, and its shameless author; some thinking it above
the capa∣city of such a young fellow to invent, and others believing it the
result of long thought and contrivance. Alas, for me, my fancy was but too
fertile and ready for all such <PB N="138" REF="140"/> things, when I set
about them, and when any question has been started on a sudden, about
matters I was ever so unprepared for, I seldom found myself at a loss
for a quick answer, which, if satisfactory, I stored up in my retentive
memory. But to return to my alphabet, as soon as I had finished it to my
mind, I began to inure my hand to write it with some readiness, that it
might upon occasion appear natural to me, which I found the more difficult,
as I never was expert at my pen, and was quite unused to this backward way of
writing; and this obliged me to alter the form of some of them, for the more
easy tracing them with the pen, and to con∣trive some abreviations and
joining of let∣ters, and other such improvements for ex∣pedition, which done,
I thought myself sufficiently prepared for passing for a Japanese
converted to Christianity. The only difficulty was, how to reconcile this new
and vile assumption with my Avignon certificate, which was not to be done
but by copy∣ing it anew, and altering it where I saw fit, and clapping the
seal from the origi∣nal one to the counterfeit; but though I 
<PB N="139" REF="141"/> was ready enough at wording it to my mind, I wrote so
indifferent a hand, that it could never pass for that of a secretary of a
vice-legate, and to have had it done by a better penman was too difficult and
hazardous for me to venture. At length I thought it safest to trust to my
copying it as well as I could, with its flourishes and ornaments, though I
did it in such a coarse and clumsy manner, that it would hardly have
passed for a tolerable counterfeit. There was likewise another danger of
a dis∣covery from the different marks and make of the German and Avignon
paper, but that never came then in my head; so that having made what
alterations I thought proper in the tenor of the pass, and clap∣ping the old
seal to it, I made no difficulty to trust the rest to fortune, and took a
melancholy leave of my poor father, who shed abundance of tears over me, and
wished me all possible blessings and suc∣cess, not dreaming how
little this new pro∣ject of mine deserved of either; and when I was got at
some distance from him, I put on my old pilgrim's habit, and began my
journey with a kind of heavy heart, <PB N="140" REF="142"/> according to the
rout he had penned down for me, and which was quite opposite to that which
would have brought me to my own home. I had, indeed, taken care to write to my
anxious mother, and to ac∣quaint her with what had passed between my father
and me, and with my desire of taking a tour into the Low Countries be∣fore I
returned to her, but I had afterwards reason to fear, that the melancholy
style in which it was worded, did rather increase than mitigate her concern
for her now really worthless son; for, from that time, neither she, nor
yet my father, ever heard of me more, nor I of them, and, in all likelihood,
both of them have bewailed my loss at a much greater rate than I de∣served,
if it did not prove the means of shortening their days.</P>
<P>The reader may see by all this, what a rash and abandoned
fellow I was, how lost to all sense of religion, nature and rea∣son,
and how I exposed myself to so many dangers, over head and ears, to
indulge a fa∣vourite passion, and without the least prospect of reaping
any benefit from it, or even aim∣ing at it. However, this is nothing in
com∣parison <PB N="141" REF="143"/> of what is to follow, and it is ra∣ther a
wonder that so bad a beginning, so ill concerted, and worse followed,
hath not had a more dreadful ending, and I can only ascribe it to the
undeserved mercy of God, that it did not end in my total ruin of body and
soul. And I must desire the reader to bear still in mind the
consi∣deration of my tender years, and the dis∣advantages of my wrong
education, if he intends to read what is to follow with any tolerable patience,
at least till he comes to some more agreeable scenes: In the mean time,
as I am now entering into One of the blackest shame and guilt, I
sincerely pro∣test, that it is the farthest from my heart to aggravate or
extenuate either, in order to render the following account more sur∣prizing
or agreeable, but to relate the whole with the same sincerity, as I
should be willing to do it, or wish it to have been done, at my last
moments. And I hope I shall be the more readily believed, as I do not
design to have it printed till after my death, when all sinister views
will be quite taken away, and nothing be able to yield any satisfaction on
the other side of the <PB N="142" REF="144"/> grave, but the
consciousness of its sincerity, especially considering that I
shall leave nei∣ther children nor relations to reap any be∣nefit from this
narrative. But to return to my proposed rout:</P>
<P>I was at first to visit all the considerable cities on both
sides of the Rhine, as they lay in my way to that of Cologn, whither I
pretended to go on a religious pilgrimage to the three kings, whose remains
are said to be there interred in the cathedral<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those were the wise men that came to worship our Infant
Saviour, and are, by the church of Rome, stiled kings, and pretended to have
been only three, whom they call Gaspar, Melchior and Balthazar; the legend
adds, that upon their being warned not to return to Jerusalem, they took the
way to Cologn, and died, and were buried there. Their heads are exposed in a
stately shrine be∣hind the great altar every Wednesday, and they shew
you the gate by the Rhine-side, at which it is pretended they came in by, and
which hath been since walled. This Cathedral doth likewise contain a number
of other relicks, and miraculous pictures to feed the devotion of the vulgar,
and bring a constant concourse of people thither.</NOTE>, to which there is
a great resort of devotees almost all the year: for the Germans are equally
fond of pilgrims that come to any of their great saints, as the Italians are
of those that come to Rome or Loretto, or <PB N="143" REF="145" MS="y"/> the
Spaniards to those that go to St. Jago de Compostella; so that I did not
doubt of meeting with a kind reception wherever I came. I shall not take up
the reader's time in describing the places I came through, that being much
better done in books of travels; but only observe, that I found them all in a
most dismal plight, most of the fine buildings ruinated, noble palaces
with only the bare walls, half de∣molished, cathedrals, and other stately
churches, built of the finest marble and other costly stones finely
carved, battered half down, and nothing left fit for divine service but the
choir or chancel, which in many places were quite unroofed, and only thatched
with straw. All the rest appear∣ed in a still more woeful condition,
where∣ever the conquering arms of Lewis XIV. had penetrated, for this was but a
few years after the peace of Reswick, so that they had not had time to
recover them∣selves from these dreadful ravages.</P>
<P>An accident happened to me before I had gone far, which, had I
been less rash and inconsiderate, might have deterred me from pursuing
my sham pilgrimage farther. <PB N="144" REF="146"/> It was at the city of
Landau, garrison∣ed by the French, and commanded by an old experienced
officer, and was then a very strong place, and the last town they had in
Alsace. The familiarity I was ob∣served to carry on with some of the
infe∣rior officers and soldiers of the garrison, who were pleased with
the whimsical ac∣count I gave of myself and my pretended country, made me
suspected of being a spy, and as such I was accordingly con∣ducted by a
file of musqueteers to the go∣vernor, who, not being satisfied with my
account, ordered me to be sent to gaol, where I was at first confined in a
noisome place for some hours, but afterwards ad∣mitted to the liberty of
the prison till the next day, when I was conducted in the same manner out
of the city, and forbid, under the severest penalties, to return into
it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In that fabulous account I give of myself,
prefixed to the history of Formosa, I pretended to have been seized here
for taking a plan of the fortifications of the place, which was absolutely
false; for though I had done so more than once in my native country, where
I could give no umbrage, I was not so stupid as to do so in this; neither
was it consistent with my scheme to pretend to any skill in drawing and
fortifications. However, as to the governor of the place it is most likely
that my youth and simplicity moved his pity more than any credit he could
give to what I said for myself; for excepting my making a longer stay in
it than is usual for pilgrims, there had been nothing said or done by me
that could give the jealousy of my being a spy.</NOTE>. This dreadful
escape might, one <PB N="145" REF="147"/> would think, have opened my eyes to
see the folly and danger of my ill-concerted scheme, as well as reminded me
of my promise of returning to my poor anxious mother, if I did not think fit
to stay with my father. But my religion and prudence were much of a piece,
just sufficient to make me apply myself to heaven in time of danger,
which was no sooner blown over, but I as quickly forgot what I owed to
either, except that I looked on myself as obliged to assist at the
church offices, such as mass, vespers, &amp;c. as often as opportunity
offered, which I continued do∣ing till a more wicked and abominable project
made me leave it off. These par∣ticulars may perhaps be thought too tri∣fling
to my readers to be worthy inserting, but to me they appear in a quite other
light, and do but too plainly shew how naturally one miscarriage draws on a
worse, <PB N="146" REF="148"/> where religion and reason have unhappily
lost their influence, or yielded it to a predo∣minant and ungovernable
passion, and how easily the indulging of it will, by de∣grees, come to
quench all remorse and conviction, and unless the Divine Grace
interposes, hurry a man into utter perdi∣tion. And as no man hath more
sensibly felt the sad effects of the one, as well as the blessed ones
of the other, what can I do less than acknowledge and adore that divine and
undeserved mercy, to which a∣lone I owe so great, and I hope effectual,
deliverance? And what cause have I not to be, to the highest degree,
thankful that I had such early impressions of religion inculcated into my
mind, and which tho' suppressed and smothered for a long time, by the
violence of a favourite vice, did yet, in God's own time, bring me into a
sense and abhorrence of my past follies, and, in some measure, drove
me from the most dreadful danger into the arms of a merciful and forgiving
Saviour, and that in so wonderful and unhoped for a manner, that it was
impossible for me to attribute <PB N="147" REF="149" MS="y"/> the
blessed change to any thing but to a supernatural grace and mercy?</P>
<P>I shall, however, in the sequel, be more succinct,
especially in my account of what happened to me from Landau, to the fa∣tal
time in which I was unwarily drawn into the most abandoned piece of
impos∣ture, that of my pretended conversion to Christianity by Dr. James,
then chaplain to a Scotch regiment garrisoned at Sluys; for to mention all
those particulars would not only appear a most stupid and tedious, but an
almost incredible series of the most unaccountable follies and
disasters that any rash youth could fall into. It will be suf∣ficient
to say, that I travelled several hun∣dred leagues through Germany, Brabant
and Flanders, under the notion of a Japa∣nese converted to Christianity by
some jesuit missionaries, and brought to Avig∣non, by them to be
farther instructed, as well as to avoid the dreadful punishment inflicted
on all that turn Christians in the dominions of the emperor of Japan. In
pursuance of which shameful pretence, I kept up an outward form or
religion, was frequent at church, and was sometimes <PB N="148" REF="150"/>
affected with those duties, and, at other times, pinched with a transient
remorse and shame at the consciousness of the wicked part I was then
acting. My fluency in the Latin tongue, and smattering of other branches of
learn∣ing, especially logic, philosophy and the∣ology, of which my
tenacious memory still preserved some of the most curious parts, joined
to the flagrant account I gave of myself, procured me, indeed, more re∣gard
and a greater share of beneficence, than was commonly shewed to other
tra∣vellers or pilgrims, but my carelessness and extravagance not
suffering me to lay out any money in dress, or even linnen, to keep me
clean and decent, I, by degrees, made so dismal and shabby an appearance,
that I outdid the very common beggars, and this misfortune brought on worse
upon me. For first, it gave such an ill face and discredit to all my
pretences, as all my learning could not counterbalance; and 2dly, when I came
into some considerable cities, which I was desirous to see, and where
they have hospitals for pilgrims and strangers, with suitable
accommodations according to their rank, appearance, or re∣commendation, 
<PB N="149" REF="151"/> commendation, I shewed, in vain, my counterfeit
pass, which, if I had been in a better trim, would, from the advantageous
manner in which I had dressed it, have procured a much better reception;
those who attend on such occasions would sel∣dom give themselves the
trouble of read∣ing it, though I begged of them so to do, but, taking it for
granted, that I was one of the lowest rank, or deserving to be treated as
such, did generally herd me a∣mong the meanest, by which I saw my∣self
in a short time covered with rags and vermine, and infected with a most
virulent itch. This dismal plight, one would have thought sufficient, to
rouse me from my senseless lethargy, and make me follow the example of
the returning prodigal, espe∣cially, as I found, to my great mortification,
that all my fair shew of learning, made me appear now only the more
despicable in the eyes of the soberer part; for how could even those, who
gave any credit to what I told them, forbear supposing that I must have
been guilty of some great enormity, or else the Jesuits, by whom I
pretended to have been brought out of Japan into <PB N="150" REF="152"/>
Avignon, would never have given me up to so shameful a vagabond life; and
no doubt but the far greater part believed it all a forgery, though they did
not think it worth the while to have me called to an account for it. Thus did I
find my affairs grow from bad to worse, insomuch that I was often pinched
with want, and glad would I have been to have returned home to my mother; but
the thought of my pre∣sent condition would not permit me to think of it, and,
perhaps, I could have preferred any death to so great a morti∣fication as it
would have been both to her and me. I have, however, had reason to think it a
mercy that I had such an inve∣terate itch, added to all my other
misfor∣tunes, for I perceived that in several great cities of Brabant and
Flanders, there are a sort of procuresses, who wander about the streets
under the character of Begines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The true Begines are a
good sort of unmarried wo∣men, who dedicate themselves to works of charity;
but instead of being cloistered up like the nuns, visit the houses of
the poorer sort, and procure them all proper relief from the charitable rich.
They likewise extend their care to the sick, lame, prisoners and
strangers, and are known by a particular plain dress, not unlike that of
the nuns. But there are also many vile women, who, under the cloak of that
dress and character, carry on the trade of procuresses, and are but too
commonly encouraged and supported in it, by the profligate rich and
great.</NOTE>, <PB N="151" REF="153"/> and pick up all the likely fellows they
meet with, in order to make a lewd trade of them; and I being then very young,
sanguine, and likely in person, have now and then been invited and led by
them in a seeming hospitable manner, to some cha∣ritable ladies to
receive, as was pretended, some token of their generosity, but, in reality,
to return a less commendable one to the benefactress. But my distemper,
whether or no it was imagined to be of a worse kind than it was, proved
such a disgustful bar, that I never was put to the trial, otherwise I
am sure neither my vir∣tue nor prudence would have been proof against it;
for though I was then absolutely innocent of any criminal commerce with any
of the sex, yet, circumstanced as I was, I have reason to believe I
should easily have yielded at any hazard, and this fur∣ther consideration
made me still more weary of my wretchedness.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="154"/>I was at length come to the celebrated city
of Liege, and stayed some time there, to view all the curiosities of the
place, and at night took up my lodging at the hospital, where we were
likewise allowed some kind of supper. There I was informed that an
officer was arrived at one of the suburbs belonging to the Dutch, who
inlisted peo∣ple into the Dutch service, and gave good encouragement to
such vagrants as appear∣ed fit to carry a musket. I had no great hopes that
I should pass muster with him, being both too young and short, as I
thought, for his purpose: however, I re∣solved to try, and soon
persuaded half a dozen of my fellow ragamuffians to follow me; but as nobody
could have a greater aversion than I to a soldier's life, by what I had
seen at my native place, where was always kept a strong garrison, I began
to wish I might meet with a repulse. The rest were presently inlisted
by the pretend∣ed officer, for he only bought them to sell them again; but
when he came to me, and had heard my patched up story, in∣stead of
seeming discouraged from taking such a raw and tender boy, he really, to 
<PB N="153" REF="155"/> my great surprize, shewed me an uncom∣mon regard,
tho' I made the worst figure of any of his recruits; and I could by no means
conceive the reason of it till near a month after, during which time we were
well entertained at an inn, wanting for neither victuals nor drink. He soon
ob∣served me to be averse to strong liquors, and indulged me in it. At
length, having sold away all his recruits but me, he began to tell me that he
had too great a regard for me, to send me with them to carry a brown
musket, and that he designed some∣thing better for me, and more
suitable to my education; but that he must first try to get me cured of
the scabious disease, which by that time had spread itself all over
my skin. Accordingly he tried all proper medicines, got me physicked,
a∣nointed, blooded, bathed, &amp;c. but with∣out success. Being at length
obliged to return to his then home, he got me hand∣somely equipt, and took me
to Aix-la-Chapelle, where I found he kept a grand coffee-house, and
billiards, and other games, in the most handsome part of the city, over
against the town-hall, and here I <PB N="154" REF="156"/> was to wait on the
customers, and to teach a boy of his to read, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I had reason to believe that my new-master had conceived hopes
that I should bring a good number of customers to his house; and, as for
myself, I ex∣pected to find no small satisfaction in be∣ing seen, and
suffered to display my parts among them. But we found ourselves both
disappointed, in a great measure, be∣cause, tho' it was then the heighth
of the season for drinking the waters, and the town was full of people; yet
the greatest part of them were seldom to be seen any where but at the
pump, and the walks about it, and these were at another and distant part of
the town; so that there was hard∣ly any resorted to his coffee-house,
except gentlemen that came thither to spend an hour or two at billiards,
backgammon, bas∣set, or some other game, and these were men of little
or no taste for learning, ex∣cept two or three French refugees, who appeared
to me to be professed gamesters. These, and now and then some German
gentlemen, that dropped in by chance, would condescend to divert themselves
<PB N="155" REF="157"/> with my company, question me about variety of things,
and hold an argument with me about some curious or instructing subject,
and at their going away commonly left some marks of their generosity,
which, however, my master gave me to understand, I was to be contented with
such a share of as he should please to allow me.</P>
<P>Besides his coffee-house, he furnished the balls, and other
places of that resort, with lemonade, orgeat, and other cooling li∣quors
proper for the season, as well as with variety of drams for such as liked
them. And here it was that I beheld the beau monde in such extraordinary
splen∣dor, as was like to have been of the most fatal consequence to me,
and to have drove me to the most desperate piece of folly and madness
that a man in his senses could have been guilty of, and which I shall
forbear mentioning, merely for the ill im∣pression it might be apt to make
on some weak and sceptical minds; but which, while I live, I shall never
forget, nor cease blessing the divine mercy which kept me back from it.
And it was well for me that I was sent thither but once more, tho' 
<PB N="156" REF="158"/> another man he kept, much older and fitter for the
business, was obliged to give daily attendance there; and I can only think
that my cuticular disease, which dis∣played itself too visibly in my
hands, was the cause why I was so seldom sent thi∣ther.</P>
<P>Before the season was over, my master, who had other irons
in the fire, was obliged to go to Spa, some German leagues from
Aix-la-Chapelle, for a fort∣night, during which time a great noble∣man, at
least one who passed for such there, had run himself pretty deep in
his debt, by some grand entertainments he had given on several occasions;
and it was now whispered about, that he was just on the point of
disappearing. My mistress, upon the first hint of it, told me I must
immediately set out and fetch her husband. The time was so short, and
the way so long and difficult, considering that I was to go on foot, that
there was scarcely any probability of my reaching the place time enough, and
much less so, considering I was a stranger to the road and to the
lan∣guage, that I would have willingly ex∣cused <PB N="157" REF="159"/>
myself from it, and have persuaded her to have dispatched a man and
horse to him, but she was a haughty dame, and above being advised, so
that I was forced to comply, though without any hopes of getting there time
enough, in which case it would be of no service to him, especi∣ally if I
should chance to lose my way, of which there was so much the more danger,
as it was very intricate, and I knew not a step of it, nor how to be
in∣formed about it, for want of the German tongue. And indeed, though I took
all the care I could, I found before I was got half way to the place, that it
would be impossible for me to avoid being so often out, through the
various windings and turnings, and cross-roads I frequently met with, that I
despaired of reaching it in double the time. The anxiety and fear I was in
was so great, about the reception I should meet with, both from him and her
for my succeeding so ill, that I began to think of preventing it, by giving
them both the slip. My heart, however, hesi∣tated a good while, and
upbraided me with the ingratitude and injustice I was <PB N="158" REF="160"/>
going to be guilty of, as likewise with the danger I might incur, should I
be caught afterwards by him; for in such a case, I must have expected
nothing less than the highest marks of his resentment. But when I
considered, on the other hand, that all my care and diligence could not bring
me to him time enough, and that I should be ill treated for that which I
could not avoid, I preferred a distant danger to one seemingly at hand; and
being then just going to cross a high road, which I was told led to the
city of Cologn, immediately took to it, with a resolution to return to my
father, and then to my mother, by the same way I had formerly gone. This
last consideration was then strong with me, as it revived in my mind the
concern and grief they must be in about me, especially my poor mother, who
had heard nothing from me since that melancholy letter I sent to her upon
leaving my father. The thoughts of seeing again two such dear pa∣rents, had
so enlivened me, that it had in a great measure effaced all other
reflec∣tions, particularly the remorse of my in∣gratitude to my late
master. But here I <PB N="159" REF="161"/> was again disappointed, not only
of that happiness, but even from the very pros∣pect and hopes of it, and
that justly too, and by my own stupid folly. And since the Divine
Providence had so wonderfully de∣livered me from the dangers and miseries
of a soldier's life, by inspiring my master with sentiments, whether of
gain or pity, or both, and I had made such ungrateful re∣turns, both to God
and him, it was but just I should plunge myself into the mi∣sery and
danger I was so unworthy to escape.</P>
<P>I had already passed through Cologn, and Bon the residence
of the elector of Co∣logn, and got to another city of his elec∣torate
likewise on the Rhine, when upon my entering it at one of the gates, I was
accosted by a person genteely dressed, who, among several other
questions, asked me if I was willing to enter into that elector's
service, and used some of the usual topicks to induce me to it. I was
surprised at his question, and readily enough answered in the negative,
but was soon after per∣suaded by him to accept his offer, tho' without the
least force or circumvention, <PB N="160" REF="162"/> and merely by my own
weakness and stu∣pidity, or rather some judicial fatality, for nothing
less than that I should think could have made me alter the laudable
resolution I had taken, or so easily set aside the thoughts of
revisiting and reviv∣ing two such dear and afflicted parents once more,
after I was got so far in the way to it; but this was not the only misfortune
that attended this rash and unnatural action, which rather proved the fatal
source of new scenes of miseries and wickedness.</P>
<P>The liberty that is commonly granted to soldiers to swear,
game, drink, whore, &amp;c. is very great among the Germans, and much more
among the French; these last may be justly affirmed to be the most
profligate of any I ever have known or read of. There is no crime or lewdness
they will not commit, no oaths or curses so terrible they will not delight
in. They seem destitute of all sense of religion and
shamefacedness, and so wholly careless a∣bout a future state, that I
have seen many of them go to the gallows for desertion with as much
unconcern, and some of them <PB N="161" REF="163"/> with a seeming
jocundity, as if they were mounting the guard; and not one of them did I ever
observe to shew the least sign or repentance, fear of death, or concern
about another life. Those we had in this regi∣ment were, if possible,
still worse, being mostly deserters from the French service, and to
the last degree profligate: and if there was any one among them that was more
soberly or religiously inclined, he was sure to become the object of
their scorn and contempt, and to be baited like some wicked or monstrous
creature, a vast num∣ber of which we had in this regiment; and these,
coming to be intermixed with a number of raw young German recruits, taken
some from the plough and cart, others from their trades, and some even from
the Universities, did debauch them into all manner of wickedness. This was
the un∣happy herd I was now got among, and whose company and example
compleated my ruin, by extinguishing those few faint traces of religion I
had left. I was indeed neither inclined to drinking nor gaming, and was not
hardened enough in impu∣dence to follow them in their lewdness; 
<PB N="162" REF="164"/> but was bad enough, nevertheless, to in∣dulge
myself, in order to appear as vile and abandoned as they, in a shameful
habit of uttering such new and fashionable oaths, and monstrous curses,
as I had lately rather heard with horror, than learn∣ed, at Aix-la-Chapelle;
and as I was still as ambitious as ever to pass for a Japonese, chose
to profess myself an unconverted or heathenish one, rather than what I
had then pretended to be, a convert to Chri∣stianity. My vanity soon made
me begin to make an aukward jest and ridicule of the most solemn and
sacred truths of the Gos∣pel, and to take a brutish delight at the
surprize which the more sober people of the town I conversed with,
expressed at my blasphemous and prophane expressions and objections,
as well as in the pleasure I observed this gave to my fellow-soldiers, or
rather fellow-brutes.</P>
<P>As the former had observed me to be, in all other respects, a
sober young fellow, given to no vice; and found me likewise master of
some sense and learning, they began to express an uncommon
compassion for me, and, believing me a heathen in∣deed, 
<PB N="163" REF="165"/> proposed to me to enter the lists with some of
their learned priests or monks, who, they doubted not, would easily
con∣vince me of my error and danger; tho' they themselves had not been able
to do it. It can hardly be doubted, but such a vain abandoned fellow as I
was, would readily accept the offer. To have declin∣ed, would have betrayed a
diffidence I was not capable of; so that I pleased myself with having a
fair opportunity of display∣ing my parts and learning against my
an∣tagonists, and either to stand proof against all their arguments, or
yield myself con∣vinced by them, according as I should find it suit
best with my vanity or interest; for if I found it worth my while to
chuse the latter, I thought I should appear to the world as a convert of
uncommon size, and gain no small applause by it. There was but one thing
could make me hesi∣tate about it, viz. the horrid guilt I should plunge
myself into by such a vile piece of hypocrisy, and I own it made some
im∣pression upon my mind; but it proved short-lived, and my own
sanguine temper soon got the mastery of it, and I at length 
<PB N="164" REF="166"/> consented to be introduced to a Capuchin of that city,
who was esteemed a man of great piety as well as learning, and who had been
apprised before of the intended visit, and the purport of it.</P>
<P>When we came to the monastery, we found the good old capuchin
sitting on a bench, in an outward room of it, facing the gate, with a lusty
young woman kneeling before him, barking like a dog, and making a great many
other antick noises and postures; upon which I was told that she was
possessed, and that the good father was exorcising the evil spirit
out of her. Whether she was then sent for on purpose, or came by
accident, I know not; but I remembred to have seen her at some
processions, and once or twice at church, in the same unaccount∣able
attitudes; and, as I was then weak enough to think it a real
possession, from her extravagant actions and words, I be∣gan to fear,
so great is the power of guilt on some occasions, that the devil might
either expose me for the vile part I was then acting, or perhaps do me some
other and worse mischief, as he had formerly <PB N="165" REF="167"/> done to
those vagabond exorcists of whom we read Acts xix. 16. to avoid which I
withdrew as soon as I decently could, as if to leave him to go on with his
exorcism. Whether he took it in this sense or not, I know not; but at our
next meeting, when she was out of the way, he took occasion from thence to
prove the truth of the Christian religion in general, and of the church of
Rome in particular; and that her priests alone have the power of casting
out devils. I told him, with a smile, that it would be time enough to
insist on the mi∣racle, or enquire into the reality of it, when it was
actually performed; to which he replied, with an air of great pity and
se∣riousness, that God did frequently permit such poor creatures to be
tormented for some time, before he vouchsafed them a deliverance; but that
tho' exorcisms and prayers would not avail till then, yet they were obliged
in charity to make use of them, in hopes that they would one time or other
prove successful.</P>
<P>As we came to enter into other arguments, I found that the good
old Capuchin was better provided for a controversy against 
<PB N="166" REF="168"/> Protestants than against heathens, which gave me no
small advantage against him; and this I took with such an assuming
air, and lightness of mind, that could not but be displeasing to him;
this was so na∣tural to me, that I never could forbear dis∣playing it upon
all such occasions, and no wonder if it gave them great cause to think me
either not serious enough for the momentousness of the dispute, or
per∣haps rather that I was nothing less than what I pretended to be. I cannot
indeed recollect, that any thing like this last was their real judgment of
me, from any thing that dropped from them, though it was but too visible to
be the case, if their cha∣rity did not blind their judgment in my favour;
however, I could see plainly e∣nough from their uneasiness, that they
were not likely to be very forward in repeat∣ing our conferences, and I was
vain e∣nough to impute it to my being an over∣match for them in the dispute.
And it was in the same vain boasting strain, that I affirmed in that
fabulous account I gave of myself in England, that I was discharg∣ed out of
that service for being a heathen, <PB N="167" REF="169"/> and for refusing
to yield to the arguments of those who had attempted to convert me. The
assumption was absolutely false, and I was discharged by order of the
colonel, because I was not only below the standard, but also too tender
for the fatigues of a sol∣dier's life. And indeed I cannot express the
miseries we underwent in the service of that prince, who was then so
eminently poor, that great numbers of his troops pe∣rished for want of
cloaths, fewel, and e∣ven of bread; and had I not been treated with greater
care and tenderness than most of the rest were, must inevitably have
pe∣rished in a very hard winter at Bon, where, besides the want of all
other ne∣cessaries, the greatest part of the garrison were quartered in
barracks open to all winds and weather, and forced to lie on the bare
boards.</P>
<P>Being thus happily discharged from so dreadful a slavery, it
was natural for me to think once more of returning to my long-wished-for
home, at any rate, and at all hazards; but here likewise my ill fate had laid
an unexpected obstacle, which it was not in my power to remove; for my late 
<PB N="168" REF="170"/> captain, a sordid wretch, who had been raised to his
post from that of a common centinel, by the basest means, had taken
those cloaths I had brought from Aix-la-Chapelle under his care, and, as he
pre∣tended, to prevent my selling them, and spending the money; but upon my
being discharged, refused to restore them to me, though he stripped me
of my ammunition ones, and had the conscience to send me away in the heart
of a severe winter, with a bare loose old frock of blue linnen, and without
waistcoat or shoes to my feet, for those he gave me were
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o worn out that my feet touched the
ground, so that I could never have travelled far before the hardness of the
weather would have made an end of me. This made me resolve to go back to
Cologn, and try how far my dismal plight and fluent tongue would work upon
peoples charity; but it being then war∣time, I was stopped, as is usual in
garri∣soned cities, at the gate, and conducted to the main guard, to give an
account of myself to the officer then on duty. I did so, and lighted on a
person, who was really a gentleman, and took such liking 
<PB N="169" REF="171"/> to me, that I listed myself in his company, and was
presently after supplied with cloaths fitter for the season. I
passed to him for a Japonese and a heathen, and was entered in his
company under the name of Salmanazar, which, since my coming into England, I
altered, by the addition of a letter or two, to make it somewhat different
from that mentioned in the book of Kings, but whether my new captain believed
what I told him or not, I be∣came no small favourite of his. He was a man of
good sense, spoke Latin and French well, and had some good scholars
in his company, one or two of them of the church of Rome, whereas the regi∣ment
consisted mostly of Lutherans, it be∣longing to the duke of Mecklenburg,
but was then in the Dutch pay, and garrisoned at Cologn.</P>
<P>That great city is, perhaps, one of the most superstitious
in all Germany; every street and every house hath the statue or image of
some saint or other, to which they light candles at night, but mostly to
that of the Virgin Mary. Our Lutherans, in spight of all prohibitions from
the ma∣gistracy, <PB N="170" REF="172"/> could not forbear shewing their
dislike and contempt to these, and many other superstitious customs
they beheld, and were sometimes punished for it. Yet did not this deter me
from taking pride in outdoing them, though I was so far from having the
same laudable pretence for it, that in my heart I condemned them for their
untimely zeal, and myself for my impious vanity. We had likewise several
loose gentlemen brought up in some of the best universities, who had
been prevailed upon to exchange their gowns and books for a musket; some of
them were Protest∣ants, others Papists, and with these our chief officers
delighted to set me on dis∣puting, by which I had gained their ill will
so far, as I generally proved too hard for them, that they had stigmatized
me with the titles of heathen, infidel unbap∣tized, and the like; but these,
instead of giving me any uneasiness or remorse, ra∣ther soothed my
pride, and made me now and then, upon a proper occasion, take de∣light to
remind them that I could give better reasons for my being so, than they
could for themselves. My captain think∣ing <PB N="171" REF="173"/> that our
chaplain, who had been brought up a regular clergyman in the Lutheran way,
might succeed better with me, proposed a conference to him; but he being a
bashful young gentleman, modestly declined it, and con∣tented himself
with exposing the folly and absurdity of the heathenish religion in
some of his sermons, where he had a large field to expatiate on, without
the danger of opposition. I was afterwards introduced to two others, one who
served the Lutheran meeting at Cologn (for they tolerate Protestant
meetings in time of war for the use of the garrison, though they shut
them up in time of peace) and the other a man of great learning, at a small
distance from the city. Our disputes proved but of short duration, I
always attacking them upon such points, as I knew they were the least able
to defend, but by Scripture, which I pretended not to believe, but urged even
those very points, such as the Trinity, Consubstanti∣ation, &amp;c. as
arguments against it; and this, as well as my vain and assuming
be∣haviour, might easily raise a dislike, if not <PB N="172" REF="174"/>
more likely, a mistrust of me. One thing I had occasion to observe,
that where Papists and Protestants are so intermin∣gled, their guides are
better stored with arguments against each other, than a∣gainst the common
enemies of the Christian faith.</P>
<P>From Cologn we were ordered into Hol∣land by the next spring,
and began to encamp as soon as the campaign began. The Lutherans and
Calvinists had prayers morning and night at the head of every regiment, and a
sermon on Sundays, and I was vain enough to go from one to the other to
observe their method of devotion, and singing of psalms and hymns, at
which they both behaved with great seriousness: but as for me, after
listening awhile to them, I was commonly driven by my rash∣ness and
vanity to turn my back to them, and turning my face to the rising or
set∣ting sun, to make some aukward shew of worship, or praying to it,
and was no less pleased to be taken notice of for so doing. This vain fit
grew up to such a height, that I made me a little book with figures of the
sun, moon and stars, <PB N="173" REF="175"/> and such other imagery as my
phrensy suggested to me, and filled the rest with a kind of gibberish
prose and verse, writ∣ten in my invented character, and which I muttered or
chanted as often as the hu∣mour took me.</P>
<P>I have often justly wondered at the singu∣lar goodness of
God to such a vile aban∣doned wretch as I was become by this time, that in
neither regiment, in which I had continued, as I remember, about two years,
during which a sharp and se∣vere war was carried on with equal
fierce∣ness, it never was my lot to be com∣manded to a siege, battle,
party, skirmish, or place of danger, in which I might have been suddenly
cut off in the midst of a most impious career; or, what is equally
surprising, that the apprehension of so dreadful an end, should not
have deterred me from so senseless and wicked a course, and made me
feel the monstrous stupidity of running such desperate hazards of body
and soul, for the sake of a little popular admiration at the best; but,
instead of which, I have more frequently met with mortification and contempt.
But I was <PB N="174" REF="176" MS="y"/> still very young, to the best of my
remem∣brance not above eighteen, if quite so much; my mind misguided by a
wrong education, as I have before observed; conscious of my own want of any
real merit, and yet fond to excess for any kind of pretence to it; and so
desirous of being admired and taken notice of, that, rather than have
foregone that favourite passion, I would have chosen to indulge it, I
verily believe at that time, at the hazard and expence of being looked upon as
the very vilest fellow that ever lived. As for those impressions of
religion which I had so strongly imbibed in my youth, they gradually lost
their influence in proportion to my giving way to that destructive
pas∣sion, and, at the best, were more in my head than in my heart, till
it pleased the divine grace to transplant them thither, as the properest
soil for their fructifying; but this blessing did not come down to me
till after several years, and a variety of scenes of impiety and guilt. I
shall pass by the other occurrences of my soldier's life, to come to that
fatal one which proved the <PB N="175" REF="177"/> source of new and more
horrid offences against God and man.</P>
<P>The last garrison I came to was at Sluys, where was a French
and a Scotch regi∣ment in the Dutch pay. There I soon be∣came acquainted with
several of the French officers, whose language I perfectly under∣stood;
but as I was wholly unacquainted with the Scotch and English, and few of them
could speak Latin, I could not be so conversant with them. I found most
of those French gentlemen very superficial, and did not a little indulge my
vanity in ridiculing their tenets, whether they were Papists or
Protestants, for there was a mix∣ture of them, and had occasion to
observe (tho' to my shame, had I had the least sense of the vile part
I played) that, tho' the greater number of them were given to such flagrant
vices as are but too common among gentlemen of that profession; yet they
all appeared so firmly attached to the tenets of their particular churches,
that they expressed much more uneasiness at those sarcasms I
used to throw out, than they did at the most dreadful oaths they commonly
swore, or any vices that <PB N="176" REF="178"/> reigned among them. And as I
still kept myself untainted from the latter, and had long ago broke
myself of that horrid one of swearing, which I had taken up on my first
entrance into the soldier's life (not so much indeed out of a principle of
religion, as from an ambition I had of passing for a moral heathen) I
frequently used to ob∣serve to them the unreasonableness of their
untimely zeal, which made them so readily condemn me for what they called my
irreligious sarcasms, which yet were but agreeable to my notions and
belief, whilst they indulged themselves in vices, such as duelling,
wenching, swearing, and drinking, which were not only incom∣patible with
theirs, but such as, bad as they thought me, I could not on any
con∣sideration be guilty of. These kinds of se∣vere rebukes ought, I
say, to have filled me with the deepest sense of my own more vile and
abominable inconsistency; but as that did not so openly appear, the
applauses I received from the sober part, and even from some of the
ministers, for so strenuously pleading the cause of virtue, made me
quite blind to my more <PB N="177" REF="179"/> odious vices; so that as long
as the cha∣racter or shadow of moral virtue procured me so much regard and
esteem, I never troubled myself about the want of the real
substance.</P>
<P>Brigadier Lauder, a Scottish gentleman, well respected, and
colonel of a regiment in that garrison, was then governor, and, unhappily for
me, conceived a curiosity of seeing me at his own house, where were
assembled several officers, besides the minister of the French
church, and Mr. Innes, chaplain to the Scottish regiment; and after dinner I
was admitted to have a kind of conference with them. I own, indeed, that the
account I gave of it in that published romance of mine, was far enough from
candid or impartial, with re∣spect to the French minister, who was the
chief manager in the dispute, my usual vanity having made me relate it too
much to his disadvantage, and Mr. Innes, be∣tween whom and that gentleman
there was a great misunderstanding, added some other particulars, equally
misrepresented and mortifying; but, abating that, the rest is the
truest part I can call to mind in that <PB N="178" REF="180"/> forged
narrative of myself. However, Mr. Innes, since dubbed doctor by one of the
Scotch Universities, and a near rela∣tion to the governor, would not lose
so fair an opportunity of triumphing over his rival, and finding that I had
nonplussed him at almost every argument, but more particularly against
that of absolute predesti∣nation, took occasion to inform me that it was
a doctrine as much condemned by some, as it was strenuously asserted
by other churches, and that consequently Christi∣anity, he would undertake
to prove, was not to be charged with it. He had a much smoother and less
overbearing way of speaking than the other gentleman, and kindly invited me
to his lodgings, where we might, at our leisure, discuss that or any
other points in dispute, not doubting but a person of my sense,
learn∣ing, and seeming candor (as he was pleased to compliment my vanity)
would easily yield to conviction, when the point was once cleared to my
satisfaction, as he did not doubt he should shortly do.</P>
<P>I readily accepted of his invitation, by which I found he
designed to exclude the <PB N="179" REF="181"/> French minister from having
any share in our future conferences, but did not then suspect his farther
drift, which was, if he could, at any rate, or by any means, make a convert of
me, to recommend himself to the then worthy bishop of Lon∣don, a person,
he knew, of such singular candor, as not to be over suspicious, and too
generous not to encourage what he thought a charitable, worthy action; so
that, as I easily found afterwards, the hopes of procuring some preferment
to himself, rather than any regard or con∣cern for me, was the main spring
of all his pretended zeal for my conversion. I am sorry that I shall be
obliged, in the sequel, to relate several very harsh truths concerning
his behaviour on this scandalous occasion, though I will be still careful
to mention no more of it than is barely necessary to set the matter in a
true light, and rather conceal than expose such parts of it, as have not an
immediate relation to the sub∣ject I am upon; much less will I go a∣bout to
aggravate his faults, in order to extenuate my own. If he should be still
alive when these memoirs shall be published, <PB N="180" REF="182"/> will
not be the first thing that has been published with truth and justice to
his dis∣advantage, and may all contribute to in∣spire him with a true
remorse and sincere repentance: if dead, it can neither hurt him, nor any
that belong to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The doctor is long since dead,
and, I am sorry to say, hath left a character behind him that reflects no
great cre∣dit to his cloth, and may easily, among those that knew him,
justify what I have already said, and shall be farther obliged to mention
in the sequel; he was not many years older than I when I first came
acquainted with him, and I soon perceived him to be a man of no small
ambition, though he was so far from having any of the generous
disposition which is mostly known to accompany it, that he was no less
a slave to avarice: witness his arrogating to himself the credit as well
as advantage of that excellent treatise, intituled, A Modest Enquiry after
Moral Virtue, for which he obtained from the present bishop of London a
very good living in Essex; but which the real and wor∣thy author, a poor
episcopal clergyman in Scotland, since obliged him publickly to disown
and disclaim in print, as well as to compromise with him for the profit of
the edi∣tion. This, together with his malversation in sundry re∣spects in
the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster, still fresh in people's
memory, obliged him to retire to his new living, where, I am told, he lived
very private, and, I hope, made the best use of his solitude. As
therefore he had long ago lost his character among all that knew him, or had
heard of his shameful actions, I thought myself less obliged to treat it
with that tenderness that I should have done, had he taken more care to
conceal his vile actions from the world.</NOTE>. He <PB N="181" REF="183"/> was,
however, intent upon his pursuit, and so assiduous in sending for me,
that some of the Dutch ministers thought fit likewise to do the same,
and more parti∣cularly, as I found afterwards, to recon∣cile me to their
favourite article of pre∣destination, by expounding it to me ac∣cording to
what they call the infralapsarian system, which is indeed less dreadful
and antiscriptural; but Mr. Innes easily dis∣suaded me from going
amongst them, that he might have me wholly to himself, and seldom failed
at our parting to clap a small piece of Dutch silver into my hand, which
proved an effectual bait to me, who was still so bad an oeconomist of my
poor sol∣dier's pay, and then wanted several neces∣saries, with which
this supplied me.</P>
<P>By this time I began not to be a little tired with a soldier's
life, the place was very cold and bleak, the duty hard, and the pay so
small, that even they who could make the most of it, could but just make
shift to live on the plainest things; so that all things considered,
there was no likelihood I should make any long opposition to his arguments,
especially as he took care to <PB N="182" REF="184"/> back them with very
large promises of get∣ting my discharge, and bringing me into England,
where he made me hope to meet with the greatest encouragement, and I own that
the prospect of such a change of life made so great an impression
upon me, that he rather found me more for∣ward to answer his design than
was con∣sistent with prudence, and too ready to be wholly directed by him.
As soon as I had given him this assurance, he wrote a long letter to the
bishop of London, wherein he told me he had said so many things in my
favour, that he doubted not of my soon being sent for by, and meeting with
the kindest reception from him. However, the wished-for answer not
com∣ing till six or seven weeks afterwards, gave me an opportunity of
seeing farther into his temper, than I had been able to do; his messages
to me were gradually less frequent, our interviews more cold, as well as our
parting, when he likewise with-held his hand from making me the usual
presents. This latter I indeed sup∣posed might be owing to his cash
running lower than usual; but I have seen so many <PB N="183" REF="185"/>
instances of his nigardness, that I have more reason to impute it to
that, and partly to his despairing of the success of his letter; for
whilst he was in hopes of it, he had taken care to introduce me to some
learned gentlemen, ministers and o∣thers, under pretence of examining
whe∣ther I was capable of giving a satisfactory account of my pretended
conversion, and had obtained from some of them very ad∣vantageous
certificates in my favour, which he took no small pride to shew to the
brigadier and to his other acquaintance; but upon the unexpected delay of the
an∣swer, he behaved with more coldness and indifference, till a jealous
thought started in his mind, lest that should encourage some of these
ministers, who had expressed themselves in my favour, to take the
bu∣siness out of his hand, and rob him of the credit of his new convert.
This sus∣picion made him all at once alter his be∣haviour, and resolve to
baptize me with such haste and so little warning, that my surprize gave
me no time to consider what an abominable piece of irreligion I had engaged
myself in, though I must confess, <PB N="184" REF="186"/> to my shame;
that had he given me more time to think upon it, yet I have but too much
reason to think, his fair promises and delusive prospects would
easily have swal∣lowed up all my scruples and reluctance, upon his
first renewal of them.</P>
<P>This, and some other parts of his beha∣viour, had already
convinced me that a charitable design of converting a soul was the
farthest from his thoughts, and that he was so far from believing me to be
what I pretended, that he had some time before taken a most effectual way
to con∣vince himself of the contrary, beyond all possibility of doubting.
His stratagem, if I may so call it, was to make me translate a
passage in Cicero de <HI>naturâ deorum,</HI> of some length, into
my (pretended) For∣mosan language, and give it to him in writing; and this I
easily did, by means of that unhappy readiness I had at invent∣ing of
characters, languages, &amp;c. But, after he had made me construe it, and
desired me to write another version of it on another paper, his proposal,
and the manner of his exacting it, threw me into such visible confusion,
having had so little <PB N="185" REF="187"/> time to excogitate the first,
and less to commit it to memory, that there were not above one half of the
words in the second that were in the first. His desiring me to construe
this likewise, confused me still more; especially, when he shewed me
the palpable difference. The serious air he as∣sumed upon it, made me
expect nothing else than a total rupture, and his exposing the imposture
in the manner I was consci∣ous it deserved. I was however agreeably (and,
to my shame, I ought to add) de∣ceived; and he finding, by this unexpect∣ed
trial, what a memory and readiness I had, and how qualified I was to carry on
such a cheat, began to clear his brow, and calm the disorder he had thrown
me into, by a more chearful and friendly look; but did not forget, at the
same time, to give me to understand, tho' at a great distance, that I
ought to take care to be better pro∣vided for the future. I promised to take
his advice, and did so in part; but was become too indolent to go thro' the
fatigue of forming a whole language, at least till I was convinced that it
would stand me in some stead; though, by what I have tried 
<PB N="186" REF="188"/> since I came into England, I cannot say but I could
have compassed it with less difficulty than can be conceived, had I been
capable of applying closely to it. However, his continuing his assiduity
and seeming regard for me, at least till the delay of the bishop's
answer, which made him suspend it for ten or twelve days, gave me but too
much reason to think, that he had not one jot more of conscience or
re∣ligion than I, tho' older, and a learned di∣vine, since he made no
scruple not only to join in, but to encourage and pursue so vile a cheat.
But if he had no more re∣ligion, he had at least more worldly pru∣dence than
I, in that he laid the founda∣tion for some considerable preferment for
himself; whilst I, like the stupid abandon∣doned wretch I had been
hitherto, looked no farther than a little vain satisfaction for the
present, or, at most, a deliverance from the soldier's life. For by that
time I could see so far thro' all his artifices, and different behaviours,
that I did not much depend on any of his other promises. And he soon after
gave me cause to think my∣self not mistaken in him. For when, upon 
<PB N="187" REF="189"/> his bringing me into England, he got him∣self into the
post of chaplain-general of the English forces in Portugal, by the
interest of the good bishop Compton, he not only left me to shift for
myself, and to bear the brunt of all objections, but was guilty of such
other vile actions, as easily con∣vinced me that he was a more real convert
to Spinozism, than I was to him; for I observed him often reading that
au∣thor's posthumous works, tho' he was an utter stranger to his sober
way of living. I had likewise a greater opinion of his parts and learning,
than I have since found cause for, which made me conclude, that I had no
reason to be more scrupulous than he, and this in a great measure quelled
all my slight and transitory qualms, at least till it came to the
solemn push.</P>
<P>I have already hinted, that his fear of being supplanted by
some other minister, made him resolve to hasten the impious cere∣mony,
for so I thought it, whatever he did; but of this he had apprised me only
in general terms, and without fixing any time for it, or mentioning how he
design∣ed to perform it, probably that I might <PB N="188" REF="190"/> think
the less upon it. Accordingly some days passed without my seeing him,
or at least hearing any thing about it, when one afternoon he sent his man
to my lodgings, to acquaint me that he had fixed that evening about six of
the clock for it, and to desire me to be ready against the time. As I had
hardly three hours to consider of it, one may easily imagine the
surprise and hurry, the confusion and dread, it threw me into; and,
indeed, I was so divided between the fear of bringing upon myself some
heavy judgment for so impious a pro∣phanation of that divine institution,
and the thoughts, if I submitted to it, of be∣having with some proper
decency under all those tumults with which my mind was then agitated, that I
began to wish I might have resolution enough to avoid it, when the dreaded
time was come. But that not only failed me, when I saw the governor and
several other officers and gentlemen going to the chapel, where the mock
cere∣mony was to be dispatched; but the devil, I believe, did then find a way
of calming my conscience for the present, by putting it into my head that
it being to be per∣formed <PB N="189" REF="191"/> by a heretic, for such I
then judged, if not all the Protestant ministers, at least such a one
as I now knew my un∣godly guide to be, it could be indeed no sacrament, nor a
repetition of it. And this confused distinction I then called to mind from
what I had learned at the schools, tho' I was far enough from being
satisfied that it was right. What salvo he had for himself, I can only
guess; but, as far as I could perceive, he went thro' the ceremony with a
very composed counte∣nance and presence of mind, and seeming devotion;
and tho' he only had his English common-prayer book before him, yet he read
the office all in a good Latin off-hand, as the saying is, and without any
hesita∣tion or solecism, as those observed who heard him with greater
attention than I was then capable of. For tho' I was a perfect master of the
Latin, and he pro∣nounced it, as most of his countrymen do, in a very
intelligible manner; yet such was my confusion and hurry of spirits, that
I scarcely knew or could mind one word he said. And a much greater one, I
dare affirm, I should have been in, had I been <PB N="190" REF="192"/> either
able to attend to the solemnity of the office, or had been made acquainted
with it before. But I was an utter stranger to every part of it; and it is my
opinion, that he chose I should be so, for he never once shewed, much
less explained, the least part of it in any of the meetings I gave him at
his lodgings. All I could recollect of the whole, was that I kept up so much
presence of mind, as to appear demure and serious all the while, which I
thought very long, and that I was very glad when it was over, and much more
so that my abominable hypocrisy had not been detect∣ed, or rather
punished, by some severe judgment.</P>
<P>The name he gave me was that of George Lauder, which was that of
the governor, whom he had prevailed upon to pass for my godfather; and it was
accordingly en∣tered into the muster-roll, instead of that of Salmanazar,
which I had till then an∣swered to. This new name and surname, joined to
some congratulations then given me, and a present of a pistole from the
governor, made me, for some time, for∣get the heavy guilt I had plunged
myself <PB N="191" REF="193"/> into. But this calm proved but short, and the
delay of the bishop's answer, and much more Mr. Innes's coldness and
in∣difference, after he had once made sure of me, soon brought me to repent
of my wicked compliance, as I then judged it, though not so much from a
sense of reli∣gion, as because I did not look upon my vanity and ambition
sufficiently recom∣pensed for the atrocious guilt I had con∣tracted; and
this the reader will the better judge by what follows.</P>
<P>The long expected letter came at length; it was full of
commendations to Mr. Innes for his zeal, besides a very kind invitation to me
from that worthy prelate, to come over into England. I was by that time so
weary of a soldier's life, that I should have readily come upon a less
promising prospect than that which he now began again to feed my sanguine
hopes with. Some things he talked to me quite incon∣sistent with what, as I
before hinted, he knew of me, and which of course could be no temptations to
me, unless I was base enough to add still more weight to my guilt; of
this kind in particular was what <PB N="192" REF="194"/> he mentioned to me of a
design of send∣ing me to Oxford, to teach the Formosan language to a
set of gentlemen, who were afterwards to go with me to convert those people
to Christianity, which, if he be∣lieved any thing of, he must needs de∣pend
upon my inventing such a language, and involving myself in still deeper
guilt; and yet I own, to my shame, though I knew not with what view he could
men∣tion such a proposal, nor looked upon it but with dread, yet I could
not forbear being much elevated with it, though I was still in hopes that I
might find some pretence for setting it aside, and being made useful
there in some other and more suitable way. How I might have behaved in
such a case I know not, only I have reason to ques∣tion whether I
should have had integrity and resolution to have confessed the truth,
rather than to have involved myself in a still more shameful imposture;
but, as I observed before, I knew him too well to rely on any of his fluent
and disingenuous promises.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="195"/>The governor, at his request, got me
dis∣charged, or rather gave my captain ano∣ther man in my room, whilst Mr.
Innes took care to procure a certificate signed by that gentleman and a
number of other officers of the garrison, and even by seve∣ral ministers,
much more in my commen∣dation than I could possibly deserve; after which,
having got all things in order for our departure, we set out for Rotterdam,
where he introduced me to some persons of consideration for piety and
learning, particularly the celebrated Mr. Basnage, au∣thor of the
Continuation of the Jewish History, and likewise to some of the
mi∣nisters and gentlemen of the English church, and to some of the French
Pro∣testants there; among whom I was so much caressed, that I begun to
look upon myself in a very agreeable and advan∣tageous light. There were,
however, two things that mortified me not a little, viz. the mean appearance I
made in some cast∣off cloaths, with which Mr. Innes had supplied me upon
my leaving off my regi∣mental ones, but which were both too big and too long
for me, and the shrewd ques∣tions <PB N="194" REF="196"/> put to me by
several gentlemen, which convinced me that they did not give all the credit I
could have wished, to the ac∣count I gave of myself and country. For as to
any real remorse or concern for the shame∣ful part I was acting, I found it
sit lighter on my mind, in proportion to the many things I met with that
flattered my vanity. The more effectually therefore to remove these two
obstacles to it, I fell upon one of the most whimsical expedients that
could come into a crazed brain, viz. that of liv∣ing upon raw flesh, roots
and herbs; and it is surprising how soon I habituated my∣self to this
new, and, till now, strange food, without receiving the least pre∣judice in
my health; but I was blessed with a good constitution, and I took care to
use a good deal of pepper, or other spices, for a concocter, whilst my
vanity, and the people's surprize at my diet, served me for a relishing
sauce.</P>
<P>We embarked at the Brill for England in the packet-boat, and in
our passage had such a dreadful storm, that as many pas∣sengers,
and among them Mr. Innes, got into the long boat, as it could well con∣tain. 
<PB N="195" REF="197"/> They all shewed an uncommon dread in their looks,
whilst I, who staid behind, beheld them with a kind of stu∣pid unconcern,
rather than a generous pity, every moment in danger of meeting with that
dreadful end they had endeavoured to avoid; yet, terrible as the sight was,
it hardly raised in me one serious resolu∣tion against the more
dangerous design I was unhappily embarked in, or the more dreadful
shipwreck I had exposed myself to, that of the soul; or if any such
thoughts came then into my mind, they were soon dispelled at our landing at
Harwich, and at the pleasing prospect with which Mr. Innes had flattered my
ambition and va∣nity. At my arrival at London, Mr. Innes, and some worthy
clergymen of his acquaintance, introduced me to the bishop of London, by whom
I was received with great humanity, and got soon after a good number of
friends among the clergy and laity, most of them persons of piety and
worth. But I had a much greater number of opposers to combat with, who put me
under a necessity of having my senses and memory about me more than
ever, to avoid <PB N="196" REF="198"/> a fatal detection; for I had been so
negligent, notwithstanding Mr. Innes's caution of be∣ing prepared, against
exigencies, with a lan∣guage and a prudent readiness at reading and writing
my new invented character, that had I been attacked on that side, I must
have been infallibly foiled; but they took a contrary way, and though they
judged rightly of me in the main, yet I can safely affirm, that they have
been very far from being candid, or even just in the account of the
discoveries they pretended to have made, to my disadvantage; parti∣cularly
Drs. Halley, Mead and Woodward; and as I had then several zealous patrons of
great candor and integrity, who made it their business to search into the
bottom of those reports, they found so much so∣phistry and
disingenuity in them, that I cannot but observe here, that the too
visi∣ble eagerness of these gentlemen to ex∣pose me, at any rate, for a
cheat, served only to make the more serious and candid part think the
better of me, and to look upon me as a kind of confessor, especi∣ally as
the three gentlemen abovementioned, but more particularly the first, were
known <PB N="197" REF="199"/> to be no great admirers of the Christian
revelation, to which my patrons thought I had given so ample a testimony.
My complexion, indeed, which was very fair, appeared an unanswerable
objection against me; there being but few such to be met with in those
hot climates, especi∣ally that of Formosa, which lies under the tropic; but
by the help of what I had read or heard of some of those coun∣tries, I
soon hatched a lucky distinction between those whose business
exposes them to the heat of the sun, and those who keep altogether at
home, in cool shades, or apartments under ground, and scarce ever feel the
least degree of the reigning heat. And this distinction indeed is not only
very reasonable, but was afterwards confirmed by persons of candor and
ex∣perience, who had been in those countries, and affirmed that they had
seen persons as fair as any northern Europeans, tho' not in so great a
number, that lived under the rays of a vertical sun.</P>
<P>On the other hand, my opposers were as much at a loss how to
find out my real country, either by my idiom, or my pro∣nunciation 
<PB N="198" REF="200"/> of the Latin, French, Italian, or any other language I
was master of. For though this may appear an easy thing to be done, by
those who are acquainted with the European languages, and the dif∣ferent
pronunciations peculiar to every na∣tion, yet both my idiom and pronuncia∣tion
were so mixed and blended, and I may say designedly so, by the many
lan∣guages I had learned, and nations I had been conversant with, that it was
impossi∣ble for the most curious judge to discover in it any thing like
an uniform likeness to any other European one they knew of. Dr. Mead, indeed,
took upon him to be very positive from both, that I was of ei∣ther German or
Dutch extract; he could not have pitched upon a more unlikely one, seeing the
Dutch idiom and language were the only one I was the least acquainted with,
and accordingly some of my friends, who were better judges of such matters,
and could plainly see that mine was more opposite to them than to any
other, did freely censure him for it, and tell him he might as well have
affirmed me to be an Ethiopian from my complexion, as a Ger∣man 
<PB N="199" REF="201"/> from my pronunciation. But the truth was, I knew enough
of all of them to blend my discourse more or less with any of them, as
either to put people up∣on the wrong scent, whilst I kept every one from
getting into the right one; for I can safely say that I never met with, nor
heard of any one, that ever guessed right, or any thing near it, with
respect to my native country.</P>
<P>I might here add several visible advan∣tages which my friends
might justly take in my defence, and among them a great number of
scandalous falshoods dispersed abroad from what quarter I know not, of
which those, who were better acquainted with me, knew me to be wholly
innocent, as well as crimes. I was naturally averse to, such as drinking,
gaming, &amp;c. for, bating my vain-glori∣ous foible, which, though I could not
overcome, I took such care to conceal from them by the most opposite
behavi∣our, my conversation was such as the most censorious could not
have blamed, but which my friends highly admired in me. The plainness of my
dress and diet, <PB N="200" REF="202"/> the little trouble I gave myself
about worldly wealth, preferment, or even ac∣quiring or securing a bare
competency, a good-natured and charitable disposition, visibly natural to
me, my averseness to drinking, lewd women, &amp;c. and a great
reservedness to such of the fair sex as had either lost their
reputation, though they lived still in credit and splendor, and even to
those who betrayed too small a regard for their character, the
conversation of whom I professedly avoided, though against my own
interest, not indeed so much from a principle of virtue, as an affectation
of it; these, together with the warmth I natu∣rally expressed for
religion, and the real delight I took in the public offices of it, appeared
such convincing proofs of my sincerity, that those of my friends, to whom
I was most intimately known, were the most impatient, and displeased to
have it called in question; for who could imagine, as they often urged, that
a youth of so much sense and learning for his years, so seemingly
free from am∣bition and other vices, could be abandon∣ed enough to be guilty of
such abomi∣nable <PB N="201" REF="203"/> an imposture and impiety, for the
sake of a little plain, homely food and ray∣ment, beyond which he neither
makes the least effort, or seems to have the least wish.</P>
<P>I am aware that what I have said in the last paragraph, will
so far carry the face of my once favourite vanity, that it will be
cen∣sured by several of my readers as a rank piece of ostentation, rather
than a sincere acknowledgment of my guilt; tho' a more candid one, who joins
both parts of it to∣gether, will rather see, that the display of the one,
is only the greater aggravation of the other. But as neither was the motive of
what I have there said, but rather to do justice to those friends of mine
who so kindly took my part on that account, I had much rather undergo
censure a∣gainst myself, than to have omitted any thing that can
vindicate their character, and convince the world that the zeal they
expressed for me, was really the effect of a most candid and charitable
construction on a life so seemingly innocent and disin∣terested, and
not owing to any rash or blind prepossession, or to an unreasonable
<PB N="202" REF="204"/> opposition against my censurers, much less to
dishonest connivance with any views or designs of mine; when I am very
sure, that if they had had any well-grounded suspicion of my being what I
was, an im∣postor, they would have been the first who would not only have
exposed me to the world, but would have become my most irreconcileable
enemies. And I thought myself the more obliged, in justice as well as
gratitude, to say thus much in their vindication; because some of them,
men of probity and learning, undertook to be my advocates in print, and not
only complained of those asper∣sions so freely and unjustly cast
upon me, but even challenged my accusers, in se∣veral advertisements
published in the Lon∣don Gazzette, to prove any of them against me, or to
produce any one solid proof or objection against the account I had given of
myself. Notwithstanding, which cha∣ritable efforts on my behalf, and the
can∣did vindication they printed some months after, both they and I had the
mortifica∣tion to find (and I have had since great reason to bless God
for it) that my fabu∣lous <PB N="203" REF="205"/> account was as much
discredited by the greatest part of the world as ever; which proved an
effectual means, in time, to bring me, thro' his mercy, to a deeper sense
of my folly and impiety, than I could have been, if that had gained a more
ge∣neral credit.</P>
<P>There was likewise a variety of judgments formed about me, by
those who thought me a cheat. Those of the church of Rome believed I was
bribed to that imposture by some English ministers, on purpose to
ex∣pose their church. The Protestants in Holland were much of the same
mind; but added, that I was farther hired to explode their doctrine of
predestination, and cry up the episcopacy of the church of England, in
derogation of their Presby∣terian government. Here some represented me as
a jesuit or priest in disguise, others as a tool of the nonjurors,
because Mr. Innes had introduced me among a set of them, particularly the
famed Mr. Lesley, of whose writings, as well as instructive and facetious
company, I was very fond; and I may add, that their conversation had not a
little biassed me to their principles, <PB N="204" REF="206"/> especially
as I found them so conformable to the school divinity I had learned be∣yond
sea, tho' it never affected me so far as to go to any of their meetings.
How∣ever, the reader may see, by what I have said hitherto, that all
these various opinions were but random shots, and without any foundation.
And indeed my case was so intricate and perplexing, that it was next to
impossible for the ablest heads to have guessed what my motives were,
or for what, or by whom, I was induced thus to impose upon mankind. And I am
fully persuaded, that my being wholly innocent of any such vile designs,
either against the church or state, or of being employed by the enemies of
either, was the cause of my disappointment turning so much to my
advantage, which might otherwise have been attended with a more fatal and
shameful catastrophe; and that the merci∣ful judge of all hearts, knowing
mine to be actuated only by mere youthful folly and vanity, without any other
dangerous or guilty design, than the indulging a wild and phrantic
passion (which was grown too powerful for me to resist, with that 
<PB N="205" REF="207"/> little share of reason and experience I was then
master of, and with these disadvant∣ages and temptations I laboured
under) did, in his great pity, prevent my going on and perishing under such
a load of un∣repented guilt, and I accordingly desire to be ever thankful for
that great and unde∣served instance of his divine mercy and goodness.
And, next to my humble ac∣knowledgment of it, I do think myself bound to
declare thus solemnly, that I never was set upon, nor directly or
indi∣rectly inticed, by any set of men for any private ends, to act the part
I did, except what I have lately related of Mr. Innes's encouragements and
promises to me, in which I am very well satisfied he had no other ends to
serve, but that of his own private interest and advancement.</P>
<P>I am far enough however from reflecting upon, or bearing any
resentment against those who looked upon me as a tool of some
designing set of men, engaged in some private design. It was not
natural to suppose that such a young, and, in all appearance, as well as
reality, raw and unexperienced fellow, could of his own <PB N="206" REF="208"/>
head have imbarked in such an impos∣ture, and carried it on so long, and
with such boldness and success, as to have pro∣cured to himself so
many zealous patrons among men of character for learning and probity, unless
he had been privately set upon, instructed, and supported in it, by
some designing persons of more years, discretion, and abilities, tho'
from what quarter was not easy to guess, either from my behaviour,
writings, or any view they could perceive me in pursuit of. As for those
who took me for a jesuit, priest, or emissary from Rome, they were
certainly the widest from the mark. The gentle∣men of that church were always
my most strenuous opposers, and not without cause, as they could be
very sure that whatever design or errand I might be embarked in, it could
not be in favour of it; and had my fabulous account met with that credit which
it must be supposed was expected, it must have done their cause more
dis∣service than any private design I might carry on could have done
good. Besides, it was visible I shunned their company as much as
possible, tho' my motive for it, <PB N="207" REF="209"/> the
consciousness of my own guilt, was not so apparent. I never conversed
with any of them, but in the jarring and con∣troversial way; and, tho' at
that time much against my conscience, was a stre∣nuous opposer of their
particular doctrines, both in conversation and writing. I never once entered
into any of their chapels, (nor have since, all the time I have been in
England) neither did I shew the least favour or partiality towards them.
This was indeed rather looked upon as an arti∣fice, said to be very usual
and common amongst them, it being urged as an ob∣servation of a long
standing, that those disguised emissaries affected to appear the
most outrageous enemies of that cause they were privately carrying on.
Whether the fact be true or not, I can only say, that I never knew of any
such but by hearsay; neither am I any farther concerned about it, than to
say, that I was the farthest from being one of that sort, and that
whatever I have said or written against that church, was only with a view
of gaining credit to myself, without any view of serving or hurting it, or
indeed caring which of the <PB N="208" REF="210"/> two was likely to be the
result. For tho' all the arguments I had heard or read a∣gainst it, and in
which I was not a little versed, had not yet been able to wipe off the
prejudices of my education, which I had imbibed under the jesuits and
domi∣nicans, of its being, if not the only saving church as they affirm it to
be, yet, at least, of its not being so bad and corrupt, so dan∣gerous and
damnable a one as some Prote∣stants, with more zeal than charity, have
represented it, under the odious titles of Anti-christ, whore of Babylon,
&amp;c. never∣theless, my youth and inconsiderate vanity would not suffer
me to enquire whether or no, or how far, I incurred a guilt in my opposing
and exposing it.</P>
<P>It was likewise from the same shameful motive of vanity that
I pretended, from my own knowledge, not only to confirm but aggravate the black
account which authors had published against the jesuits and other
missionaries, especially with regard to their boasted conversions and
success in the East-Indies, and more particularly concerning the cause
of the persecution raised against the Christians in Japan; when all
that I <PB N="209" REF="211"/> knew of it was only from reading or hear-say.
And as to the Jesuits, though I was then and am still sensible that
some of their maxims, tenets, and politics, do justly deserve to be
condemned; yet I was far enough from having such disad∣vantageous notions
of that society, as the world seems generally to have of it, and much
less from any thing I had ever ob∣served among them, considering how
young I was when I left them, and how close and recluse they keep
themselves from the rest of the world. But whe∣ther they deserve the
disadvantageous cha∣racter they have, or not, which is best known to him,
to whom both they and every man is to give an account at the last great day,
it is incumbent upon me thus far to do them justice, as to own, that those
reflexions I have cast upon their missionaries in China and Japan, had no
other foundation than common report, without any enquiry whether that was true
or false; so far was I from having any just or real reason for
confirming or ag∣gravating it. As for the rest of the priests of that
church, as far as I was capable of <PB N="210" REF="212"/> judging of them, in
those juvenile days in which I was more intimately conversant with
several of them, I can only say, with the common voice, that there are good
and bad among them, though per∣haps to a much higher degree than I have had
occasion to observe of those of any other church. One thing I can truly
say, however, to their praise, that they gene∣rally take greater care to
instruct their youth in matters of religion, and to oblige them all to
assist at their catechetical lec∣tures on Sundays in the afternoon. The
misfortune was, that we had no books to learn them by heart beforehand, but the
priest was forced by repetitions to incul∣cate them in our memories; whence
it followed, that those who were wanting either in attention or memory, went
a∣way little the better for the pains he took with them. As for me, I never
failed coming, because my memory being very tenacious, and my apprehensions
pretty quick, I could carry an answer of any length at once or twice
repeating, so that I was mostly the first interrogated, and re∣ceived no
small commendations from our <PB N="211" REF="213"/> instructors,
especially as I was one of the youngest, and was as ready at those
an∣swers on the next meeting, as if I had thought on nothing else all that
time. And as this used to make me to be much admired by the numerous
audience, so it of course failed not to feed me with se∣cret pride, and a
natural fondness for all such occasions of shewing my talents.</P>
<P>The same happened to me on my coming first into England, when
Dr. Innes, proud of his pretended proselyte, introduced me into the company
of all the learned di∣vines of his acquaintance, that they might hear me
descant on the grounds of my conversion; and I was by that time so well
versed in that kind of learning, more from the books I occasionally read on
that subject, than from any pains he had taken to instruct me, that I
believe few people of my years, notwithstanding I had mur∣dered so much of
my time, could have said more in defence of the Christian re∣ligion; all
which was sufficiently acknow∣ledged with no small commendations and
congratulations, both by all that heard me, and by those who have first
read these ar∣guments <PB N="212" REF="214"/> in the fictitious book
above∣mentioned; for that system of religion, and defence of
Christianity, was what I had mostly extracted out of Limborch, and some
other divines, without Dr. Innes's help, or even knowledge, though what follows
there, with respect to Church go∣vernment, was wholly his, as may be
ea∣sily perceived from the difference of style and method. However, when
all these kinds of conversations were ended, my doctor failed not to spur
my pride still far∣ther on, by telling me what those gentle∣men said in
my commendation, which, whether or not exaggerated by him, gave me such an
extraordinary notion of my parts, that I was proud of every opportunity of
shewing myself in all companies and public places, without any other view
than that of feeding my natural vanity, whilst he was privately pursuing
what appeared to him more weighty, the advancing of his fortune, to which end
he strove to in∣troduce me, and himself by my means, to all the great men
in church and state, which he found no hard matter to do, because, ere I
had been in London three <PB N="213" REF="215"/> months, I had been so cried
up for a pro∣digy, that they were all exceedingly de∣sirous of seeing and
conversing with me; and not only the domestic, but even the foreign papers,
had helped to blaze forth many things in my praise, for which there was not
any foundation. Thus I remem∣ber a remarkable article from London, printed in
the Dutch and French papers, that the young Japaner had been presented to the
archbishop of Canterbury, who admired him chiefly for his readiness in
speaking a great variety of languages. Whereas I cannot call to mind that I
spoke any but the Latin, which his grace having either forgot, or being
unused to my fo∣reign pronunciation, was forced to have interpreted to him,
by Dr. Innes, in English. So that I found I needed not to be very
solicitous to blow my own trumpet, when the common cry, and the public
papers, did it beyond my expectation for me. I had indeed a fluency of the
Latin, and a smattering of several modern lan∣guages, as well as a great
readiness in learn∣ing them, had I applied myself to them; but I boasted
of more knowledge in them <PB N="214" REF="216" MS="y"/> by far than I had,
especially in the oriental ones; tho' at that time quite ignorant of
them.</P>
<P>I had not been two months in London be∣fore the doctor persuaded
me to translate the church catechism into my pretended Formosan language;
and I, tho' much a∣gainst my will, was forced, by his over∣bearing command,
not only to perform the odious task, but to present it afterwards to the
bishop of London, who received and rewarded it with his usual candor and
ge∣nerosity, and laid it up among his other curious manuscripts, tho' it
rather deserved to have been condemned to the flames. However, the doctor had
his own views to serve, one of which was to confirm me in the good opinion of
that worthy prelate, and of as many other gentlemen as should either see or
hear of it. And another, to make me exert my talents in inventing and
familiarising myself to this pretended For∣mosan language and character,
for fear my want of it should cause some unexpected discovery, at
least before he had got the preferment he was in pursuit of. When I had
finished the pretended version, he not <PB N="215" REF="217"/> only examined
it himself carefully, but got other persons to do the same, who all found
the language so regular and gram∣matical, as well as different from all
others they knew, both with respect to the words and idiom, that they gave it
as their opi∣nion, that it must be a real language, and could be no
counterfeit, much less have been invented by such a stripling as I; and
hence some of those of my opposers, who thought me a Romish priest in
disguise, imagined that I had been assisted in, or taught it, by
some of the fraternity be∣yond sea. I should have observed, that I had
taken care to write it in one column in Roman character, with an interlineal
Latin version in Italick, and in my invent∣ed character on the opposite
column.</P>
<P>As he found me to succeed so well in this vile piece of
invention, he soon after pre∣vailed upon me to write the history of
Formosa, and got several of his and my acquaintance to back the motion, as
a thing which would bring much credit and profit to me, and be very acceptable
to the public. One might have imagined, that a task so arduous and
dangerous would have start∣led <PB N="216" REF="218"/> such a raw young
fellow as I was, be∣ing then scarce twenty years old, and so very great a
stranger to these countries. I had indeed got some imperfect notions from
a few books that had fallen in my way, as well as from conversation with
those who had either been in those parts, or had read more about them than
I, but was forced to hatch many things out of my own fertile fancy, to supply
the defects of my knowledge. One thing I found a great help and relief from,
that the accounts we then had of that island from Candidus, a Dutch
minister, who had resided there, and from the rest of the writers who had
in some measure copied him, were stuffed with such monstrous
absurdities and contradictions, and that the place upon the whole was so
very un∣known to the Europeans, even to those who had been in China, Japan,
and other parts of that country, that I might the more easily make whatever I
should say of it, to pass current with the generality of the world. So
that without much he∣sitation I undertook the work, and resolv∣ed with
myself to give such a description <PB N="217" REF="219"/> of it as
should be wholly new and surpriz∣ing, and should in most particulars
clash with all the accounts other writers had given of it; particularly that
it belonged to Japan, contrary to what all other writers and travellers have
affirmed of its being subject to China. And this I was left to hammer out of
my own brain, without any other assistance than that of Varenius's
description of Japan, which Dr. Innes put into my hands, to get what I could
out of it. All this while both he and the book∣sellers were so earnest
for my dispatching it out of hand, whilst the town was hot in expectation
of it, that I was scarcely allowed two months to write the whole,
notwithstanding the many avocations I had by frequent visitors, and
invitations abroad. So that it is no wonder the thing came out so crude,
imperfect, and absurd, and more so would it have been, had not the
person, who englished it from my Latin, assisted me to correct many
more and greater improbabilities, which I had not had time to discover: but
he like∣wise was hurried on by the booksellers, and had the fewer
opportunities of con∣sulting <PB N="218" REF="220"/> me on that head.
Besides, there was one maxim I could never be prevailed upon to depart from,
viz. that whatever I had once affirmed in conversation, tho' to ever so few
people, and tho' ever so improbable, or even absurd, should never be
amended or contradicted in the narra∣tive. Thus having once, inadvertently in
conversation, made the yearly number of sacrificed infants to amount
eighteen thousand, I could never be persuaded to lessen it, though I
had been often made sensible of the impossibility of so small an
island losing so many males every year, without becoming at length quite
depopu∣lated, supposing the inhabitants to have been so stupid as to
comply with, or the priests inhuman enough to have exacted such a number of
human victims. I must moreover observe here, that my friends found still
a much weightier objection a∣gainst my account, viz. how such a
strip∣ling as I must be when I left that coun∣try (for being then but near
twenty years of age I could not be supposed to have been above fifteen or
sixteen, upon my pretended coming away) could give such 
<PB N="219" REF="221"/> a large and particular account of it, as could hardly
have been expected from a man of twice my age. Many of them were hence inclined
to impute what was so liable to objection in my narrative to my want of years
and experience, which might make me the more liable to mistake. This, though
a very candid excuse for me, I was not inclined to admit of, and therefore,
to abate the wonder, was forced, by Dr. Innes's advice, to assume three
years more than I had, and to pretend I was nineteen years when I came away,
and between twenty-two and twenty-three at the writing of the book; more than
that had I pretended to be, my face, air, and behaviour would have given me the
lye, for in that only respect did I appear what I really was, a raw, young,
hot-headed and inconsiderate stripling. However, these monstrosities,
as I may justly call them, which gave me so much trouble to vindi∣cate
afterwards, both in company and in a new preface to the second edition of
that vile romance, have really, since I came to be in a better mind, proved
no small com∣fort to me, since they have been an effec∣tual 
<PB N="22O" REF="222"/> means of discrediting the whole rela∣tion, and saved
me the trouble and shame of doing it in print, especially during the life
of many of my worthy friends, who, from a real principle of candor and charity,
had publicly engaged in my quarrel, and to whom such an open acknowledgment
must have given the greatest mortification; so that though I was come by
that time to abhor the imposture, yet I contented myself with owning it
only to some of my most intimate friends; and in other com∣pany, when
questioned about it, with turning the subject in such manner as should
give them to understand, that I was ashamed to enter farther into it.</P>
<P>The first edition had not been long pub∣lished before it was
all sold, and a new one demanded, with such alterations and vindication of
the old one as might most likely promote the sale, and satisfy at once
the curiosity of the public, and the avarice of the proprietor; for, as to
me, I had only the small sum of ten guineas for the copy of the first,
and twelve more for the improvements in the second, be∣sides such
presents as were made me by <PB N="221" REF="223"/> the generous few to whom I
presented them. But before I ventured on the se∣cond, I was sent by the
good bishop of London, and my other friends, to Oxford, to pursue such
studies as I was fit for, or inclined to, whilst my opposers and
advo∣cates were disputing here about the merit or demerit of the first. And
when I came to the university, I found many learned and worthy friends as
warmly engaged for, as others were against me; and with this seeming
advantage on my side, at which I have had frequent occasion to blush,
that the former were men of the best character for candor and probity, as
well as learning and parts, and whom, for that very reason, I forbear, as I
ought, to name, their partiality for me being the mere effect of too
extensive a charity and generosity, and which only exposed them to the
sarcasms and ridicule of my oppo∣nents.</P>
<P>However that be, I had a convenient a∣partment assigned me in
one of the most considerable colleges by the worthy head of it, a man in
high reputation for his writ∣ings and universal skill in all polite
litera∣ture, <PB N="222" REF="224"/> and esteemed one of the most
ac∣complished gentlemen of his age. I was not, indeed, immatriculated, for
reasons scarce worth troubling the world with, but had all the other
advantages of learning which that college or the university could afford me,
either by access to the public and private libraries, or by acquaintance with
some of the learned in several other colleges as well as our own, and in
this last I had, moreover, a very worthy and learned tutor assigned me,
who not only gave me leave to assist at all the lectures he read to his
other pupils, some of whom were gentlemen of high birth and for∣tune, and
greatly advanced in learning, but allowed, and even invited me to make such
objections as my mind suggested to me, or even to chuse the subject of
our entertainment, whether the Newtonian phi∣losophy, logic, poetry, or
divinity; which last was, of all others, my favourite one, as well as in a
great measure his, for he took orders soon after I left Oxford.</P>
<P>As to the mathematics, in which he was also well skilled,
though I had a great opinion of that study, yet could I never 
<PB N="223" REF="225"/> be prevailed to go over the threshold; and the
needless demonstrations, as I then thought them, to many of Euclid's
propo∣sitions, which appeared to me self-evi∣dent, such as that the lines
that are drawn through a circle, are longer or shorter ac∣cording to their
nearness or distance from the centre, and others of the like nature,
seemed to me rather trifling than serious or useful, and I could never
have the pa∣tience to be better informed. History, especially ancient
chronology, &amp;c. ap∣peared so dark, intricate and liable to such
unsurmountable difficulties, that I never ex∣pected to meet with any
satisfaction in them, worth the time and pains they would cost to learn,
so that I was a long while before I could be induced to read Scripture
history, neither did I begin to be conversant in it till I came to have a
taste for the Hebrew tongue, which was not till many years after, and that by
mere accident, as I shall shew in the sequel. Church music, which was
then in great perfection by the encouragement which the worthy dean of
Christ-Church gave it, as well as by several of his excellent
compositions in <PB N="224" REF="226"/> that kind, was the main thing that
capti∣vated my vain roving fancy, and took up most of my spare hours,
though I was not a little ashamed to see what drunken, idle ragamuffians
composed almost every choir there, and with what indolence, to call it by
no worse a name, they performed their parts, except on some more solemn
occasions than ordinary, as when the bi∣shop, or some persons of
distinction, ap∣peared at the Divine worship. The even∣ing I commonly
spent with some select company, but without drinking to excess, or even
to a degree of exhilaration, which I neither wanted nor was inclined to, and at
the usual hour of nine retired to my apartment. But here to make a shew, at
least, of retrieving the time I wasted a∣broad in the day-time in company,
mu∣sic, &amp;c. I used to light a candle, and let it burn the greatest
part of the night in my study, to make my neighbours believe I was plying of
my books; and sleeping in my easy chair, left the bed often for a whole
week as I found it, to the great sur∣prize of my bed-maker, who could hardly
imagine how I could live with so little <PB N="225" REF="227"/> sleep, and
without the usual benefit of bed refreshment. Had I not been blessed
with a strong constitution, seasoned moreover by two years fatigues in
the army, and by my living moderate and low, I might perhaps have felt the
sad effects of such an irregu∣larity, and I don't know but my
appre∣hension of it might be one main motive that induced me to make a shew
of it, in order to give it the greater merit; for I began to pretend to have
swelled legs and feet, and a gouty kind of distemper, which my friends
failed not to attribute to that, and earnestly intreated me to submit to
more regular hours and method of rest. They likewise prevailed upon me to
go and drink some medicinal waters at a small distance from the city, it
being then the season, and a good deal of company of both sexes
resorting to it; but as I knew myself to stand in no need of any of
those helps, I went thither only twice or thrice, rather for the sake of
the company, diver∣sion, and music; but as my pretended lameness gave me
a kind of gravity, which I was not willing to part with, not know∣ing how to
keep up to the one without the <PB N="226" REF="228"/> other, I went still
limping about like an old gouty fellow, though no man could enjoy a better
share of health and flow of spirits than I did all the time I staid
there.</P>
<P>It were a shame for me to tell how idly I spent most of my
time, and how little progress I made in such a place, company, and among
such noble libraries, and learned acquaintance; for, excepting those
lec∣tures which I heard from my tutor, most of what I got was by
conversation, but little or nothing by reading, except in books of
controversy, almost the only ones that could captivate my roving mind.
Howe∣ver, it was during my short abode here, (scarcely six months) that I
employed my leisure hours in correcting and revising my romance of
Formosa, and wrote the best answer I could to the objections that had
been made to the first edition, in a second preface, which, all things
considered, met with much greater approbation than it de∣served, from
those few intimates I had shewed it to; after which, taking my leave of all
my friends there, I set out for London, where I soon after published that
second <PB N="227" REF="229"/> edition. At my coming to my old lodgings in
Pall-Mall, where Dr. Innes and I had for∣merly lodged, I was told that he was
gone over chaplain-general to the English forces in Portugal. I had no
reason to regret his ab∣sence, for he had, before I went to Oxford, been
guilty of such notorious and barefaced immoralities, as well in this as in a
former lodging in the Strand, both those of sober and reputable families,
that his character had greatly suffered by it, and he went a∣way, just time
enough to save himself the mortification of being shamefully turned out
of this last, as he had been out of the former. Had I been, indeed, a real
con∣vert from heathenism to Christianity, it might have been truly said
of him, what our Divine Master said of the Pharisees, compassing
sea and land to gain a prose∣lyte, and making him ten times more wicked
than themselves; and he hath been more than once severely reproved by his
acquaintance, for the scandalous example he gave to me in particular, who was
admired by them for the contrary virtues. The truth is, he had an almost
insurmount∣able propensity to wine and women, and <PB N="228" REF="230"/>
when fraught with the former, fell immo∣derately foul on the latter, whether
maids or married, not scrupling to use even vio∣lence; which I particularly
mention, be∣cause his behaviour in these, and several other respects,
to say nothing of what I have hinted in a former note, gave me but too much
cause to think that he had no real regard to religion, either natural or
re∣vealed; so that had I not been happily restrained by Divine Grace, his
example would not have failed to have extinguished all sense of remorse
which accompanied every indirect action I did, and confirmed me in downright
infidelity, in which case I might never have been so happily made
sensible of the error of my ways, as I have since been, nor ever repented
of them, till it had been too late. I have therefore great reason to
acknowledge it the greatest mercy that could befal me, that I was so well
grounded in the principles and evi∣dence of the Christian religion, that
nei∣ther the conversation of the then free∣thinkers, as they loved to stile
themselves, and by many of whom I was severely at∣tacked, nor the writings
of a Hobbs, Spinosa, <PB N="229" REF="231"/> Toland, Collins, Tindal, &amp;c.
against the truth of Divine revelation, could appear to me in any other light
than as the vain ef∣forts of a dangerous set of men to over∣turn a religion,
the best founded, and most judiciously calculated to promote the peace
and happiness of mankind, both tempo∣ral and eternal; I must own, that the
so∣phistry which perpetually runs thro' their writings, like the warp
through the woof, gave me but too much cause to suspect their
sincerity, and that the inveteracy they shew against the noblest
system of mora∣lity that ever could be thought of, to which all their
united force could never substitute any thing better, or near so good, is
but a sorry proof of their pretended love to truth, and to the good of
mankind, es∣pecially when I considered how fully and frequently their
writings have been an∣swered and exploded by better hands, with∣out any other
visible effect than that of their trumping up the same old trite argu∣ments
in some new dress, and claiming a fresh victory from them.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="232"/>I hope that what I have now wrote will not
be deemed by the candid at least, as designed to proclaim my own praise,
see∣ing it rather aggravates my guilt that I could act such a notorious
piece of hypo∣crisy, contrary to the strongest convictions I then felt,
that it was impious and of∣fensive to God. What I chiefly men∣tion it here
for, is only to observe, that it was that very conviction (which his good
providence would not suffer to be quite extinguished in me, though he
per∣mitted it to be so long kept under by the impetuosity of my wild and
ungovernable vanity) that did at length co-operate with his grace to work in me
an utter abhor∣rence both against that vile and dangerous passion, and
the still viler crimes it had involved me in: for if sincerity is one of
the most essential virtues of the gospel, how abominable must such
a long-wind∣ed and multifarious dissimulation appear to a guilty person,
when brought to a deep sense of it, however light it might seem to him in
the more youthful and inconsiderate part of his life? Those only who have
felt can judge of the smart and horror of it, <PB N="231" REF="233"/> under
which nothing could well support them but a sure reliance on the death and
merits of a Divine Saviour, and a sincere repentance for, and detestation
of it. For as such a happy change can only be the work of Divine Grace, so
it gives one a moral and comfortable assurance of pardon and acceptance at
the throne of infinite mercy, through the efficacious interces∣sion of our
common Redeemer and eternal High Priest.</P>
<P>But though I occasionally mention it here, I would not have it
inferred from thence, that I began so soon to give way to so sa∣lutary
a remorse. I was too young, vain, rash and thoughtless to be any other
way influenced by it, than as it put me upon finding out the most
senseless excuses and palliatives, such as every one may easily
guess at, that hath been, like me, a slave to youthful passions. So
that above half a score or a dozen years were mis-spent in a course of
the most shameful idleness, va∣nity and extravagance; some sort of
gal∣lantry with the fair sex, with many of whom, even persons of fortune
and cha∣racter of sense, wit, and learning, I was <PB N="232" REF="234"/>
become a great favourite, and might, if I could have overcome my natural
sheepish∣ness and fear of a repulse, have been more successful
either by way of matrimony or intrigue; which I have since the more wondered
at, considering my great pro∣pensity to women was as strong as my vanity,
and the opportunities so many and inviting, and I so little scrupulous
a∣bout the danger or guilt of them; yet I may truly say, that hardly any man
who might have enjoyed so great a variety, ever in∣dulged himself in so
few instances of the unlawful kind as I have done. This I am far from hinting
by way of pretence to a greater degree of virtue, of which no man could then
have a less share than I; for in those few, wherein I was unhap∣pily
engaged, but especially one wherein my effection was captivated to an
immo∣derate degree, no man pursued them with more eagerness and excess
than I did. But I am far enough from being inclined to entertain my reader with
a detail of my sad irregularities and follies, either in this or other
respects, which I have long since looked back upon with shame and 
<PB N="233" REF="235"/> sorrow; only, with regard to such kind of unlawful
amours, I cannot recal to mind my strong and vehement bias for them, without
thankfully acknowledging that there must have been some secret
provi∣dence that kept me from giving such way as I might otherwise have
done to the ruin of my health, circumstances, &amp;c. or my being unwarily
drawn into some unhappy marriage, or other snares, into which I have
observed many a one less rash, extravagant, and inconsiderate than I,
have so unhappily fallen into.</P>
<P>I was led into this sense of God's divine providence towards
me, by some (I may say) unavoidable observations on his gra∣cious
dispensations, in which it was im∣possible for me to be mistaken: one
was, my meeting with an almost constant dis∣appointment in my most
pleasing prospects, my most sanguine expectations and favou∣rite
projects, whenever the end proposed was the satisfaction of my predominant
passion, or the means to attain it were such as my conscience condemned
as un∣lawful; so that I seldom failed of reaping some pungent shame,
mortification or dis∣grace, <PB N="234" REF="236"/> where I expected
approbation and applause, or with losses and poverty, where I looked for
profit or gain. On the other hand, whenever I chearfully entered into any
laudable method of living that offered itself, or rather, which the same
good Providence threw in my way, I always met with surprising success,
and with such credit and approbation as made me ample amends for the
struggles my pride made against it on account of its meanness. I shall
take the liberty of giving a signal instance, because it hath an
immediate connection with the imposture I was still striving to carry on,
and consequently de∣serves to be exposed.</P>
<P>I had been about five or six years in Eng∣land, and lived in
such an extravagant and careless manner (if not in expences, which were
rather moderate than lavish, had I been in any laudable way of gaining a
competency, but which for want of that often run me into debt, without any
visi∣ble way of extricating myself) when a plau∣sible way was offered to
me, by one Pat∣tenden, of getting money, and credit too, by a white sort of
Japan which he had <PB N="235" REF="237"/> found out, and was then, in vain,
endea∣vouring to recommend to the world, tho' it was really a curious sort of
work. His proposal was, that I should father, and introduce it, under the
notion of my hav∣ing learned and brought the art from Formosa; on which
condition, and my putting now and then a hand to the painting, he offered me a
considerable share in the profit. I readily agreed to his proposal, not
only on account of the pro∣fit we supposed it would bring, but much more
so as it would yield a kind of convincing proof to the fabulous account I had
given of myself. We accordingly advertised it under the name of White
Formosan Work; and it was viewed and greatly admired by the curious for its
fine whiteness, smoothness, and hardness, and for the beauty of the
other colours painted upon it: notwithstanding which, and all the extravagant
encomiums we gave it, by far beyond what it really deserved, and our care and
artifice to conceal its real faults, for some it had, we could never make it
succeed so as to be gainers by it. And though our disappointment might be
<PB N="236" REF="238"/> owing, in some measure, to the vast high price he
rated it at, contrary to my opi∣nion, yet I have cause to bless God it so
happily miscarried, and was forced to quit it; for had the project
succeeded accord∣ing to my sanguine hopes, it would have hardened me only
the more irretrievably in my vile imposture and self-conceit, but its being
so unaccountably blasted, in spite of all our endeavours to push it
forward, did not a little contribute to inspire me with a dislike to all
such unlawful and dishonest ways of getting of money, though this was not
the immediate result of my disap∣pointment; on the contrary, I grieved at
it, and at some other of the like nature, for some years, till the
frequency of them made me see clearly into the true cause of them, and
fully persuaded me that nothing but an honest and sincere intention,
followed by the use of right and lawful means, could be attended with
success; for I attempted since then several other means of getting of
mo∣ney, which, though not equally odious as this, were still blameable in me,
by rea∣son of my incapacity for them, such as the <PB N="237" REF="239"/>
practising a kind of empyrical physic, teach∣ing of some modern
languages, &amp;c. of which I neither was a sufficient master, nor capable
of a competent application to make myself so. However, as I was hap∣pily
disappointed in them all, and as I had reason to think justly too, it
set me, at length, on a more honest and laudable scent; and it was not
long before Provi∣dence threw That in my way, which nei∣ther my pride nor my
reluctance to a close application, would have suffered me to have sought
after, or even thought of: for a counsellor of Lincoln's-Inn, who brought up
his three sons and a daughter under his own eye, and had a better opinion of
me by far than I deserved, sent for me, and proposed to me the
instructing his sons in the Latin tongue, and such other branches of
learning, as I should think them capa∣ble of, at his own chambers. I readily
ac∣cepted the offer, notwithstanding the salary was rather too small for
the charge, as I was to attend them twice a day, and spend, at least, three
hours with them every day, and lived at some distance from him. I was, in
about a year's time, honourably <PB N="238" REF="240"/> discharged, upon his
sending them to be farther educated beyond sea.</P>
<P>Soon after this I was recommended to be tutor to a young
gentleman, about eight miles from London: his father, who was an officer in the
army, had kept him for se∣veral years at some considerable schools to
little purpose, for when I came to him, he could hardly translate one line
out of the plainest Latin authors, which he at∣tributing rather to the
remissness of his for∣mer masters, than to his want of genius,
resolved to give him a home education. I found him, however, so
unacquainted with every grammar rule, and so averse to begin afresh with
it, he being then near fifteen years of age, that I was obliged to acquaint his
father with the little hopes I had of him in the literary way, and pro∣posed
the teaching him some other branches of learning, for which he shewed a
rea∣dier genius, and particularly fortification, which, as I formerly hinted, I
had learned from our indolent Jesuit, and of which I was become a pretty good
master, by con∣versation in the army, by seeing a good number of
considerable fortresses in several <PB N="239" REF="241"/> parts of
Europe, and more particularly by reading Vauban, Cohorn, and other emi∣nent
authors on the subject. My proposal was readily agreed to both by father
and son, and the latter made a considerable progress in it in a little
time, insomuch that we had not only gone through all the theory of it, and he
could take any plan of a place, but had likewise made a model in clay of a
large fortified city, in which I had contrived to have a specimen of every
thing that related to the art of fortifying, both in the regular and irregular
way, en∣gineering, &amp;c. and which, when finished, was not a little
admired, not only as a no∣velty, but likewise as a compleat piece of
fortification. The misfortune was, that my salary was neither answerable,
as I thought, to the pains I took with my pu∣pil (whom I still made, at
proper times, apply himself to Latin, and other branches of literature) but
likewise, through the ex∣travagance of the father, very ill paid; which made
me so much the more uneasy, as I had contracted some debts which I
should have been glad then to have paid with it. This, at length, determined
me <PB N="240" REF="242"/> before the year was quite out, to accept of an offer,
which not only appeared more advantageous, but likewise more suit∣able to
my vanity, though it so far diso∣bliged the gentleman's father, that he
made no scruple to refuse paying me what was still due to me, and to let
me go from him with visible tokens of his re∣sentment.</P>
<P>This happened just after the rebellion was broke out in
Lancashire and Scotland, anno 1715, on which account new troops were raised
every where, and he became so considerable and flush of money, that I
might have made my own terms to have staid with him. But, by that time,
some of my friends had prevailed upon the ma∣jor of a regiment of dragoons,
to make me the offer of being clerk to the regi∣ment, and as I knew him to be
by far a much finer, and more generous gentleman of the two, nothing could
dissuade me from accepting it. He could not, how∣ever, prevail on the other
captains to make me clerk to their troops, that being, as they said, a
perquisite belonging to the quarter-master; but it did not hinder 
<PB N="241" REF="243"/> him from retaining me to this, and mak∣ing such
additions to the common salary out of his own pocket, as made it near an
equivalent, and the friendship and regard he shewed me, made me be looked
upon as a fit companion to the rest of the officers, several of whom having
had a liberal education at some of the univer∣sities, it was not long
before we came in∣to a kind of intimacy; there was, besides, another thing,
which procured me no small esteem among them, viz. my becoming very soon
acquainted with the clergy and other gentlemen in every place we came to,
especially with the learned and curious, by which means I could introduce
such of our officers to them as were men of me∣rit or character, as the
most part of them were. But what added still more weight to the rest was,
that my friend, the ma∣jor, who had often heard me called by the familiar
nick-name of Sir George, in some of the families where he had become
ac∣quainted with me, after the peace of U∣trecht, took it into his head not
only to continue the same stile to me, but even to give it out, that I had
been knighted by <PB N="242" REF="244"/> queen Anne. This last I was indeed
wholly ignorant of, for a long while, and denied it as often as the question
was put to me, but was, however, so fond of the fea∣ther in the fool's cap,
that rather than fore∣go it, I used to lay a stronger claim to it, under
pretence of my birth and family, for I still passed current for a
Formosan, and was as proud as ever of being thought so, as it procured me
such an access a∣mong persons of rank and learning, which I likewise
made a means of bringing our officers and them into a familiar and agree∣able
acquaintance, who might otherwise have been more than ordinarily shy of
each other at that critical juncture. I might add, that as I was likewise a
greater favourite of the fair sex, than any of the red coats, whom they could
not but look upon with some dread at that time, I had frequent invitations
from them, even those of rank and fortune, whose curiosity would not
permit them to suffer so great a stranger as I was to come, or even to
pass so near them, without having the pleasure of seeing and
conversing with him, and informing themselves in all the 
<PB N="243" REF="245"/> particulars that related to him. And as I always took
care to behave in such a man∣ner as might gain their esteem, as well as
admiration, so I could the more easily in∣troduce such of our gentlemen
as bore an unexceptionable character to them, by which means we had the
satisfaction of spending many a pleasant day in their com∣pany in the
most innocent and agreeable manner, particularly in Lancashire, and, after
the suppression of the rebellion, where we continued quarters, at Wigan,
War∣rington and Manchester, in which last I had, moreover, the opportunity
of fre∣quently visiting a noble library belonging to the collegiate church,
and well furnished with all manner of books that could be purchased with
money: for it is endowed with 100l. per ann. to supply it with new ones as
they come out, and yet, when I was there, they had above 500l. in bank, and
scarce knew how to lay it out, in∣somuch that they were thinking of
pur∣chasing of some of the most curious ma∣nuscripts. This, I could not
but observe to them, was ill judged, considering the situ∣ation of it,
chiefly among tradesmen, who <PB N="244" REF="246"/> have neither taste nor
knowledge of such valuable pieces, and the few learned men in that
neighbourhood that could reap any benefit from them, and rather advised them
to lay out that income in purchasing such valuable modern books, as were
yearly published both in England and out of it, and which, I thought, would
better answer the intention of the noble donor. They seemed to acquiesce
in what I said; but whether they followed my advice or not, I never enquired
since.</P>
<P>These allurements, so soothing to my na∣tural vanity, and
our often moving from one county to another, made me stay longer in the
regiment than I ought in rea∣son or conscience (had I been capable of
listening to either) to have done, considering that I was of no service,
but only a dead weight to my friend the major, who, be∣ing moreover as bad an
oeconomist as my∣self, would have been glad enough to have been rid of me,
though he never, either in word or carriage, gave me the least hint of it,
but rather the contrary; yet some of those friends of mine, who had
recom∣mended me to him at first, had more than <PB N="245" REF="247"/> once
advised me to ease him of so expen∣sive a load; yet so pleased was
I with this wandering and idle kind of life, which gave me an opportunity of
travelling through, and seeing, so many countries I should otherwise
never have been able to see, that I could not prevail upon myself to leave
the regiment, till it was ordered into Ireland, and then marched as far as
Bristol with them, and saw them embarked for that kingdom: so that I had
been, from first to last, somewhat above two years in this wandering kind
of amusing life, without reaping any other advantage than the see∣ing
variety of places and people, and con∣versing here and there with some
learned men and books, though nothing so much with the latter as I might have
done, if my indolence, vanity and the variety of objects which danced before my
eyes, had not diverted me from it.</P>
<P>Upon my return from Bristol, I was at no small loss how to
dispose of myself for some time, and having had time to rumi∣nate upon
my mis-spent time and idle life, was easily induced, by some of my
friends, to alter my course, and, if possible, to get 
<PB N="246" REF="248"/> into a way of earning a competency by my own industry,
rather than live at other peo∣ple's cost, or, which was much worse, on
their charity, which I could not now but look upon myself as a most
unworthy ob∣ject of; and, as I had a little smattering of painting and
drawing, and had I been capable of a proper application, might, with
assistance, have attained to a consi∣derable proficiency in it, having
a strong genius for, and no indifferent judgment in it. However, to go the
nearest and easiest way to work, I resolved on that of fan painting,
which required less time and pains to learn; and had the profit been any
thing answerable to my assiduity, I could have been contented to have
drudg∣ed on with it still. But that business was then at so low and
contemptible an ebb, that, though I lived with a good fa∣mily almost gratis,
and was early and late at work, yet I found it impossible to get a bare
competency by it; notwithstanding the encouragement several of my friends
and acquaintance gave me. This, how∣ever, brought me acquainted with a worthy
clergyman; who, thinking the employ∣ment <PB N="247" REF="249"/> too mean for a
man of my education and parts, and that I might bestow my time to much better
purpose in some kind of laudable study, particularly that of di∣vinity,
which I had always been most fond of and conversant in, engaged to raise
a subscription among his acquaintance, by which I might be enabled to
follow my studies with more ease. He did it accord∣ingly, to the amount of
between twenty and thirty pounds per ann. which, with the help of a small
addition I got to it, by per∣fecting of a young gentleman in the Latin tongue
and some other branches of learn∣ing, made it a comfortable competency,
especially as I was become, by this time, a better oeconomist, and had
fallen into a more frugal way of living.</P>
<P>But all this while this subscription did lie somewhat heavy
on my conscience, and at some particular times gave me no small
unea∣siness, inasmuch as it was founded on a belief of my being a
Formosan, and a real con∣vert to the church of England, which those pious
subscribers had not any doubt of, that I could find, even to their dying
day; for whenever I waited on them, I always met <PB N="248" REF="250"/> with
the kindest reception and civil treat∣ment that could be wished. This
uneasi∣ness still increased, as I now and then met with some people
at their houses, whose behaviour and objections, though not in plain terms,
gave me but too much reason to think they had not the same charitable
opinion of me; and this put me upon va∣rious indirect means to prevent my
friends being prevailed upon by them to withdraw their benevolence. This made
me often wish and pray, that I might but fall into some more honest way
of living without it, and free myself by it from that aggravated re∣morse,
with which I was forced to receive it. But though I was fully persuaded of
the guilt, yet I was not sensibly enough af∣fected with it to make an open
confession of it, and how unworthy I was of their charitable opinion and
assistance; and con∣tented myself with making some resolutions of
giving up the latter, at least, as soon as I could get myself into a way
of living without it.</P>
<P>I became, at length, providentially I may say, acquainted with a
person who was concerned in various branches relating to 
<PB N="249" REF="251"/> the printing trade, and in very good cir∣cumstances.
He was, moreover, a very generous and good-natured gentleman, and I became, in
a little time, so great a fa∣vourite, that he could scarce pass a day
without seeing and consulting me about some of his affairs; and by his
means I came at last to translate books, and to get a comfortable living by
it. It was then I began to perceive, with no small joy, how God blessed
my endeavours in propor∣tion to my diligence and honesty, which made so
lively an impression on my mind, that I resolved never to be concerned in
any works, that were either prophane, he∣retical, or of a trifling nature or
ill ten∣dency, and have accordingly refused them whenever they have been
offered to me. From translating of other people's works, I came at length to
print some of my own, and with the same laudable view, and have found
still more credit and comfort in it, and more cause to bless the Divine
mer∣cy, for the wonderful and undeserved success I have since met with.
But of these I shall speak in a more proper place; in the mean time I
shall only ob∣serve <PB N="250" REF="252"/> here, that my charitable
friends, dying one after another, as my business increased, I never
applied to the survivors for a conti∣nuance of their benevolence, but
declined it where it was offered, as being then able to live without it: and I
can only add, that though I once looked upon these sub∣scriptions as no
less unworthily bestowed upon, than basely received by me, yet I have had
the comfort to observe since, that they proved the happy means of freeing
me from a more laborious and unprofitable life, and of enabling me to follow
those studies with more ease and chearfulness, which fitted me, in
time, for those more arduous and beneficial tasks, which I have been
since engaged in; seeing it was during the greater part of that time, that
I applied myself to the Hebrew tongue, and to the more close study of the
sacred books; by which means I had an opportunity of making a large
collection of critical and other remarks, which, though designed then only
for my own information, came at length to have a place in one of those works
I shall speak of in the sequel, where they have since met with the
approbation of the public, both in <PB N="251" REF="253"/> England and abroad;
though even under those encouragements, and with those op∣portunities I
had, I must own, to my shame, that I was still fair enough from such a
lau∣dable application, as might have turned them to better advantage; and that
I still mis-spent a great deal of my time in a loose, careless
manner, and that it was not till after a year or two that I disengaged
myself from company, especially of the fair sex, though, one person
excepted, rather trifling than culpable, to follow my books more closely. I
shall therefore skip all the for∣mer part of my time, from the twentieth to
the thirty-second year of my age, as a sad blank to every thing that was
good or laudable, and fraught with a dismal variety of folly, indiscretion
and other miscarriages, which would rather disgust than inform, or even
divert a sober reader, to come to a more hopeful and instructive period;
and only observe, before-hand, that it was no small happiness to me,
(which, to whatso∣ever owing, I ought at least to attribute to my own
discretion) that the many learned and pious persons I was formerly, and
con∣tinued still, acquainted with, (for it was <PB N="252" REF="254"/> with
such that I mostly chose to converse) were never acquainted with, nor,
as I could perceive, ever suspected me of being guilty of such a
shameful, idle and scanda∣lous way of living, but believed that I spent
most of my time to better purpose; else it is not to be doubted but I had
been discarded and shunned by them. In which case I should have
entirely lost the most ef∣fectual means of coming into a better way of
thinking, which their conversation, ex∣ample, and the many good books which
they lent me, did at length happily bring me to, and been left, like a
weather-cock, exposed to all winds: for though I could talk, and, at some
serious intervals, think as seriously as they of religion and its most
important duties, and even comply with them in such a manner, as seemed
very delightful and edifying to them; yet was my roving heart so far from
joining sin∣cerely, or being affected with them, that I could easily forego
them, to indulge any new rising satisfaction, though ever so op∣posite.
And indeed, such a frequent va∣riety did offer itself naturally in my way,
as I was in no way able to resist.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="255"/>Thus, for instance, it was natural for
those intimates to introduce or renew some old subject or topic relating
to my pretended country, travels, conversion, or other ro∣mantic part of my
life, which, however irksome it was then become to me to repeat, and as it
were to confirm anew; yet there was no way for me to avoid it, unless I had
at once acknowledged the whole relation to have been a notorious and shameful
impos∣ture; and what a deadly wound must have such an unexpected
confession given to my natural vanity? and what a mortification would it
have been, to such sincere honest people, to hear it from my own mouth?
so that, could I even have had courage enough to forego the former, as I have
more than once thought and even resolved to do, yet how could I find it in my
heart to give so sensible a displeasure to persons that had shewn
so much friendship and zeal for me? to say nothing of the dreadful
apprehensions of the consequence of their charitable opinion being thereby
turned in∣to a just abhorrence and detestation. This was the sad dilemma
I found myself in when I came to reflect seriously on my 
<PB N="254" REF="256"/> case, and which made me conclude it, all things
considered, altogether impossible for me to extricate myself out of,
without some miraculous power to assist me to overcome a passion,
which had hitherto eluded all the opposition which my reason and
ex∣perience had been able to raise against it. But what glimpse of hope
of any such Divine help could such a wretch have, who, with his eyes open
to the guilt and dan∣ger, had brought himself into such a dan∣gerous
state? But God's mercy, which is over all his works, is not to be judged of
by us according to our narrow apprehen∣sions, but according to the gracious
ma∣nifestation he has given us of it in his gospel; and as that
assurance gave me good grounds to hope, so that hope inspired me with a
design to use all proper means to obtain it, and leave the issue of it
to his Divine Providence. To him, therefore, I thankfully give all the praise
for his unde∣served and singular blessing on those means which
himself directed me to, and what the chiefest of them were I have alrea∣dy
mentioned, and shall take notice of some others in the sequel, in hopes
they <PB N="255" REF="257"/> may prove of service to such as may stand in
the same need of them as I did then.</P>
<P>However, I must own, that the resolution had something awful
and deterring, when I considered it in its full extent, to exchange the
delights of variety and multiplicity of company (which had been so delightful
and insnaring to me till then, that no mo∣tive or obstacle could keep me
from it) for solitude and retirement; their bewitching flatteries and
commendations, whether for a false merit I had assumed, or for some
valuable things they fancied in me, for a closer recollection and abhorrence
of my own vileness; to spending of so much pre∣cious time in the gaities
and guilty vanities of life, for a more close application and search after
the properest and most effectual means of redeeming that invaluable jewel,
and the parcelling and bestowing it to the most beneficial purposes; to
retrench not only all unnecessary and unlawful expences, but even some of
the common and neces∣sary ones, in order to make some amends for past
extravagancies, by supplying the wants of those many objects, that used
to pass by unobserved and unpitied by me. <PB N="256" REF="258"/> These,
and other such like indispensable preparatives, to the desired thorough
change, seemed to carry such unsurmount∣able difficulties with them, that
neither my small share of reason nor philosophy could have supported
me to any tolerable degree in the resolutions I was daily striving to make
after it. And indeed, nothing so effectually did it, as the consideration
that that Divine Providence, which had inspired me with that desire, would
not fail of com∣pleating it, if I was not wanting to myself; for that at once
set me upon trying some∣times one, sometimes another, of those duties,
with success enough at least to en∣courage me to proceed.</P>
<P>And here I was again providentially helped by a worthy clergyman
at Braintree in Essex; who, good man, had a much better opi∣nion of me than
I deserved, and presented me with that excellent book called Reform∣ed
devotions, and recommended by the late reverend Dr. Hicks. This excellent book,
though then unknown to me, and disrelished by some weak Christians, is
so well known to all the true devout ones, that I need say no more in
commendation <PB N="257" REF="259"/> of it, than that it proved of such vast
be∣nefit to me, that I can never sufficiently admire it, or the piety of the
compiler and reformer; for the many opportunities and invitations it gives one
of frequent and closer intercourse with God, and of meditating, in the
most exalted manner, on his various works, infinite mercies, and on all the
sub∣lime truths and duties of Christianity, did so effectually reconcile
me to that solitude and retirement I had formerly been so averse to, and
afforded me a most noble refresh∣ment several times a day, from my
close application to other studies I was then pur∣suing, some of which
being of the dry, others of the complex kind, might have gone but
sluggishly on without it. The late pious Mr. Nelson's Method of Devotion
falling likewise, soon after, into my hands, in order to be conveyed, by my
means, to a young gentlewoman lately recovered from a state of despondency,
I had the curiosity to run through it, and found in it such ex∣cellent, yet
easy rules for the conquering of our natural vices, and recovering the
con∣trary virtues to them, that I made it one <PB N="259" REF="260"/> of my
daily monitors, and with no small success.</P>
<P>But that which gave me the greatest help, was the learned and
pious Mr. Law's Se∣rious Call to Devotion. This truly valu∣able treatise I
accidentally found on a cler∣gyman's table, who, nevertheless, soon took it
out of my hand, and gave such a character of it, as might have discouraged
me from looking farther into it, had not the place I had opened given me a
quite different notion of it. However, as I could not prevail upon him to lend
it me, I went and bought me one, and read it over and over, from beginning to
end, with greater eagerness and satisfaction than any I had ever met with
on that subject. I was particularly much taken with the au∣thor's motives, as
well as his method for the right use of our time, money, talents, &amp;c. not
to mention that his variety of characters and reasonings upon them, which are
a continued appeal to the most unbiassed and soundest judgement,
which admit of neither cavil or objection, soon opened to me a much better
way of applying them to ad∣vantage, than any I had hitherto, or could 
<PB N="259" REF="261"/> indeed have fallen into, without such an excellent
guide. The directions he gives for the obtaining of those Christian
virtues, which he there recommends as the proper subject for the several
hours of prayer in the day, may indeed appear to have some∣thing too
technical (since it is no other than a daily renewing of those very
desires, till themselves become the virtues we want) from which too much of
the success may, by the light and thoughtless, be ascribed to the
method, and too little to the grace of God accompanying it. For may not, some
will be apt to say, an honest heathen or deist, by the same method,
raise him∣self up into a habit of sobriety, chastity, &amp;c. without
any such application to, or parti∣cular assistance from, the Supreme
Being? yet let any serious person try the efficacy of it against any of
his favourite, especially his constitutional vices, and he will find, at
length, that he hath been only trying to wash a Blackmoor white, and must
do so to the end of the chapter, without the intervention of Divine grace. As
for me I shall always, I hope, look upon the de∣sire itself, as well as
the success of the <PB N="260" REF="262"/> means used for the obtaining
any virtue, to be alike the work of God in the soul, let these be such as
Mr. Law directs, or any other, which Providence puts into our hands.</P>
<P>I had long before this, however, began to consecrate part of my
time to the study of the sacred books, tho' not in that re∣gular and
uniform manner as I happily fell into after reading the excellent directory
above mentioned, and had made a pretty collection of criticisms, and other
obser∣vations upon them, such as occurred on my reading of the various
commentators on them; and now it was that I became sensible, indeed, of my
own want of know∣ledge of the original Hebrew, and to be∣wail the loss of
several opportunities I had missed of gaining a more perfect know∣ledge
in that sacred and useful tongue. For I had been so discouraged from
the pursuit of it, by the difficulties I met with at the very threshold,
that is, in the gram∣mars, that I never had the patience to go thro' one of
them, but contented myself with the interliniary versions of Pagninus,
Arias Montanus, and other Interpreters; <PB N="261" REF="263"/> chusing rather
to rely on their honesty and skill, than to be at the trouble of becoming a
proper judge of either. It was not in∣deed possible for me to go on long in
this groping way, before their various inter∣pretations of the text,
(especially those of some bold critics, which seemed calculated to
unhinge, rather than confirm our belief, by exploding several, till then,
acknowled∣ged facts and doctrines, or interpreting them in their own artful
way) set me again upon making some fresh efforts, for attain∣ing a more
perfect knowledge of the original, which were however soon damped by every
fresh difficulty I met with in the common way of learning it, till I
providen∣tially stumbled, as it were, on the following easy method.</P>
<P>I was then hammering at an exercitation on the 34th Psalm,
printed at the end of the grammar that goes under the name of Bellarmine; in
which I found at almost every word some exceptions to the gram∣mar rules,
and such reasons assigned for them as still carried one farther from
the point in view; when a poor man came and offered me a pocket Hebrew
psalter, with <PB N="262" REF="264"/> Leusden's Latin version, over
against each page. I greedily bought it, and finding the ver∣sion much more
easy and natural than those literal ones of Pagninus and Montanus, quickly
went through every verse in the book, without troubling myself about
grammar, or any thing but the true mean∣ing of every word as they occurred. So
that by the time I had given it a second reading, my memory being the best
faculty I could boast of, I had by that very rote, as I may call it, not only
gained a conside∣rable copia verborum, but by observation on the flexion of
nouns, verbs, &amp;c. got a tolerable insight into the declensions,
con∣jugations, and other parts of the grammar and syntax; and, whenever any
difficulty or doubt occurred, could easily turn to my Bellarmine or even
Buxstorf, the most dis∣couraging of all; because, having then but one
point in view, I could, without per∣plexing my mind with any more than that,
either satisfy myself about it, or at the worst postpone it, till a
further reading and observation brought me to it: I became so fond of this
method, that having gone through a third reading of it, with little or 
<PB N="263" REF="265"/> no obstacle, and in a very little time, I re∣solved
thenceforth to confine myself to the psalms of each day, as they are read
at church, and to begin with the historical books.</P>
<P>Here, instead of perplexing myself with such Bibles as had
the servile letters printed in a different kind of character, to
distin∣guish them from the radicals, I pitched upon the first edition of
that of Munster, which is far inferior to the second, and, by the help of
his version on the opposite column, though often at several lines
distance from the original, had hardly gone through six or eight chapters
of the first book of Samuel, before the ease I found in it invited me to go
back to Genesis, and take every chapter in its course. I resolved at
first to run them over once, without taking notice of his notes, because
the greatest part of them were either of the Massoretic or of the
Cabbalistical kind, and would rather clog than assist; and even in
these of the gram∣matical sort he lays all along so great a stress on
the punctuation for the true meaning and import of each word, as made his
ver∣sion the less to be depended upon. For <PB N="264" REF="266"/> though I
always did and do still look upon the points to be of singular help to
learners, and consequently on the method proposed by some moderns of
teaching the Hebrew without them, as wild, intricate, and in some cases
dangerous, yet from all I had been able to gather from the learned au∣thors who
have wrote on the controversy, I was so far from thinking them of the
same authority with the text, they plainly appeared of too modern a date to
be used in any other shape than as an expeditious help; and as such I
still made use of them, without confining myself to them any far∣ther
than they were supported by the dia∣lect, by the ancient paraphrases and
ver∣sions, and other such critical helps, but made no scruple to depart
from them whenever a small change of them could afford one a clearer or
better sense. And for that I shall refer the reader to what I have
since wrote on that so much controverted subject in the Jewish
history, which makes the seventh chapter of the Universal History, and
especially in the folio edition, where I had more room to expatiate upon it
than in the octavo one, in which our being confined <PB N="265" REF="267"/> to
reduce the whole within the compass of twenty volumes, obliged us to be a
little more concise. I must therefore here own with pleasure, that all
that I there advanced hath been so well received, and looked upon as so
well grounded, that it hath not, that I know of, been since censured or
con∣tradicted; and that though the controversy in favour of the antiquity and
authority of the points hath been of late revived with no small warmth, I
have met with nothing in it, nor heard from either those I converse or
correspond with, any thing that could give me cause to alter my mind. I
shall only beg leave to add, that my looking on the Hebrew points, both vowel
and gra∣matical only in that view, enabled me to make many useful
discoveries in the sacred books, which have been highly approved by those
who have since read them in the history abovementioned.</P>
<P>But to return to my first reading of the origi∣nal books, I ran
with ease through the Penta∣euch, Joshua, Judges, &amp;c. except the few
po∣etical parts which occur in it, such as Exod. xv. pass. Deut. xxxii.
Judges v. .1 Sa∣muel <PB N="266" REF="268"/> ii. 1-10. where the stile
is not only swoln and figurative, but where the construc∣tion is harsh,
irregular, and to appearance truncated, and several terms which occur no
where else; so that finding them too hard for me to surmount, with all
the application I had, I postponed them to a future read∣ing. I found
likewise pretty near the same difficulty in the Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
and the Song of Solomon, and much more still in Job; and therefore contented
myself with catching as much as I could at one cursory reading, and leaving
the rest for hereafter; yet did not this discourage me from going through
all the Prophets in course, though it proved an arduous task, and I went
but slowly on, because in these I endeavoured to make myself as much
mas∣ter of their meaning and stile, as well as of the new words and
phrases peculiar to them: and as I spent generally some hours a day on
that study, I had quickly gone through all the sacred books of the Old
Testament, excepting those chapters in Da∣niel, Ezra, &amp;c. which are in
the Chaldee, and where I contented myself at this first reading, with
examining as well as I was <PB N="267" REF="269"/> able, the difference between
that and the Hebrew. And here I own I found such a disparity between them,
such a noble sim∣plicity, and yet masculine energy in the latter, and
such an apparent softness and effeminacy in the former, not unlike what
is justly observed between Latin and Italian, that I believe nothing could
have tempted me to become more acquainted with it, had it not been for the
vast helps which the Chaldee paraphrase affords us, not only in fixing the
meaning of many obscure words and expressions, but, what is still more
va∣luable, in discovering the sentiments of the ancient Jews concerning
many pregnant prophecies of the Messiah, from which the Talmudic writers
have since departed out of dislike to him.</P>
<P>When I came to the second reading of Ge∣nesis, by which time I
had likewise ran through the Psalms five or six times, and was got again
into the historical stile, I found myself so unclogged, so acquainted
with the grammar and syntax, and master of such a vast number of words,
that I began to think I might begin to read the Latin into Hebrew; that is, by
hiding the Hebrew <PB N="268" REF="270"/> column with my hand, try how I could
make my own agree to it. This I found however too hard and tedious, except in
some easy places or chapters, and I found myself not only at a loss for
the words, but mostly in the conjugating and syntax, and though it might in
all likelihood have quitted cost, had I proceeded regularly in that method,
yet I found it too tedious, as it took me above twice the time, so that I
contented myself with only trying it now and then, when the humour took, or
the subject invited me to it. At other leisure times, I used likewise
to exercise myself in conjugating of verbs by dint of memory and
observation, and then to compare it with those in the grammar, by which I
soon found out wherein I was deficient, and this I thought more expeditious,
diverting, and effectual, than the dull method of begin∣ners, who, by dint of
hammering, learn them by heart, scarcely knowing what they are about. One
thing however I found would be a great help, viz. in all dubious words, as the
Hebrew is so figurative and scanty, to have recourse to the Lexicon, in
order to find out the primitive sense of them <PB N="269" REF="271"/> from
the more remote, which it was easy to do by the parallel texts there pointed
at, where they occurred. This method duely attended to, opens a spacious
insight into the true meaning of the sacred books. Thus I found for
instance in the words <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Genesis
i. 2. the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters, com∣pared with the
motion of the eagle in stir∣ring her young ones to flight, Deut. xxxii. 11.
that the verb <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the former in
its primitive sense, is not such a motion as our version expresses,
nor a brooding like that of the hen over her eggs, as some other
translations intimate, but a lively agitation, such as much better explains
the action of the spirit of God upon the face of the waters. This method,
which I preferred to the consulting that variety of versions we have, which
rather confound than fix the sense, inabled me in my very second going
through the sacred books, to make a pretty large collection of such kind of
criticisms and observations, as have been since of singu∣lar use to
me in the progress of my study, and in some of those works in which I
have been since engaged, though I little thought then <PB N="270" REF="272"/>
either they, or those which I made out of other authors that came in my way,
would ever come into public view.</P>
<P>I had by this time made so great a profi∣ciency in the Hebrew,
tongue that I could have talked it pretty fluently, had I been as well
acquainted with the pronunciation of it. But as that could not be attained from
grammars, which differed almost as much in the rules they gave for it, as the
native languages of their authors differed from each other, I thought it might
be more easily attained by conversing with the Jews them∣selves, going to
their synagogues, and hear∣ing the Scriptures read by their chazans or
ministers, who, I supposed, were perfect masters of it. But here, to my
great surprise, I found that they not only greatly differed among
themselves, that is, the nor∣thern from the southern, or German, Polish,
Hungarian, &amp;c. from the Spanish, Portu∣guese, Italian, &amp;c. but that
every one of them pronounced it after the same manner as they did the
languages of the countries where they had been brought up, and, as it plainly
appeared to me, none of them right. And this was farther confirmed to me by
con∣versing <PB N="271" REF="273"/> with some Morocco Jews, whose native
language being the Arabic, made me think they bid fairest for having retained
the antient pronunciation in a greater degree at least of purity; for some
of them whom I met with by chance in the Portuguese synagogue, made a mere
ridicule of their way of reading and pronouncing it. And it was by conversing
with some of these, who were besides well acquainted with the Hebrew,
that I took my rules for a more genuine way of speaking it: and it was no
small pleasure to me to find, that I could be very readily understood by
all the southern Jews, though I could not so easily understand them, on
account of their not sufficiently distinguishing between the sounding
of sundry consonants, aspirations, gutturals, &amp;c. which seemed to
me to have originally differed very greatly; such as the
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> &amp;c. but between which they do
not make any distinction, nor in∣deed can, for want of having been taught it
in their youth. In the same manner do they murder it, when they go about to
write it in European characters, witness that Spanish dialogue of the famed
R. Netto, <PB N="272" REF="274"/> intituled
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> esh dath, the legal fire, but
which he spells, after his Spanish man∣ner of pronouncing, <HI>es dat.</HI>
However, after I had once been fully apprised of all the defects of their
reading, which several of them I have conversed with have had the
in∣genuity to own as such, I could easily enough understand both their
lectures of the Old Tes∣tament and their prayers. But as to the nor∣thern
Jews, I own I never could con∣verse with them in that tongue, without an
interpreter, or some go-between, who, by the help of travelling into other
parts, had learned the way to accomodate their speech to both ways of
pronouncing, so much wider and uncooth is theirs to that of the southern;
and this was no small grief to me, because I always found the northern more
learned and communicative, as well as more fluent and ready at speaking that
sacred tongue; though that consideration was never sufficient to induce
me to be at the pains to accustom myself to their way. Thus much I thought
might be necessary to say with respect to the pronunciation of the
Hebrew, to which I shall only add, that my method for learning and
preserving it <PB N="273" REF="275"/> was by reading it aloud to myself, and
with the same exactness, as if I had been reading it to an
assembly.</P>
<P>But what contributed most to this extraor∣dinary readiness of
speaking it, was a me∣thod I fell into at proper times, when I found myself
inclined to close thinking, to cloath my ideas in that, instead of any
other language, or, as one may more pro∣perly word it, to think in Hebrew
rather than in English, or any other language I was used to. The Psalter,
which at my first setting up for this study, I had read over for some
time, at least three or four times a month, and afterwards constantly went
through once a month ever since, was become so familiar to me, that I had
got it by heart; and as that contains most of the radical words, as well as
idioms, which are most in use, I seldom was at a loss for either in
these my soliloquies, or, if I was, I immediately endeavoured to call to
mind where I had read any thing like it, either in that or any other of the
sacred books, and by turning to it, if I could not readily recover it by dint
of memory, seldom failed of fixing it there <PB N="274" REF="276"/> indelibly.
By this means I soon acquired not only a surprising fluency in it, but
could speak it in the pure and elegant stile of the sacred writers, and
now and then, upon occasion, raise it to the lofty strain of the poetical
books. This I was the more admired for, because it was what few, if any, of
the learned among the Jews could do, who commonly marred their own by an
heterogeneous mixture of the corrupt Talmudic and Rabbinic words and idioms, to
which I was then in a great measure a stranger, nor could ever be
reconciled to after I became more ac∣quainted with them. One may, indeed,
observe almost the same difference between the former and the latter,
some few of these excepted, as there is between the Latin of the Augustin
age, and that which was in vogue after the inundation of the northern
barbarians into the Roman em∣pire, as the reader may see by what I have
said of it in my History of the Jews from their Dispersion after the
destruction of Jerusalem to this time.</P>
<P>By what I have said hitherto of my me∣thod of learning Hebrew,
any one may <PB N="275" REF="277"/> see how easily men at years of maturity
may come to as perfect knowledge of it, as the thing will admit of, and without
the discouraging slavery of beginning at the grammar, and may even make
that a pleasing relaxation from other studies; and it is with a view of
lessening, if not al∣together removing those fancied difficul∣ties and
discouragements which have been the cause of that sacred tongue being
so much, and, I may add, so shamefully neglected, by the clergy
especially, that I have ventured to write so far on that sub∣ject from my
own experience; for, let them think of or palliate it as they will, such a
neglect must of necessity be condemned, by all who seriously
consider how impos∣sible it is to come at a true knowledge, not only of
the Old, but I will be bold to say of the New Testament, without a
suf∣ficient knowledge of the Hebrew: the first seems to me
self-evident, and with re∣spect to the second, or New Testament, I need
only observe, that the writers of it, though inspired, and endowed with the
gift of tongues, did visibly adhere still to the Hebrew idiom in which they
had been <PB N="276" REF="278"/> brought up, St. Paul himself not excepted.
Hence, the vast quantity of Hebraisms that occur more or less in the
Gospels, Acts, and in the Epistles, and which ne∣ver can be rightly
understood or explained, but by having recourse to the Hebrew idiom; but
this hath been so fully dis∣played by much better pens, that I shall
say no more on the subject.</P>
<P>I have often wished, indeed, that we had some more inviting
helps to that study than we have, and such as might more effectually
contribute to overcome the a∣version, or indifference, which our young clergy
seem to have for it. And in order to contribute something more than a bare
wish towards it, I had once gone a good way in composing a tragi-comic
piece, intituled, David and Michol, in Hebrew verse, wherein I introduced
this young princess, acknowledging with a suitable reluctancy and shame
to her confident, her new born affection for the young shep∣herd, after she
had seen him unperceived from behind a curtain in her father's pa∣vilion, and
heard some of these inimita∣ble strains with which he was wont to 
<PB N="277" REF="279"/> enliven that desponding monarch in his most
melancholy hours. The distress a∣rising from the apprehended rivalship
of her eldest sister, who was soon after promised as a reward to that
brave youth, for kill∣ing the vapouring champion of the Phi∣listines and
Morabs, being represented here as having already settled her affections on
Adriel the Meholathite, to whom Saul ac∣tually gave her soon after, contrary
to his promise (1 Sam. xviii. 19.) the different fears and emotions of the
two sisters, the means by which they came to understand each other's
case and inclinations, the sin∣gular affection of Jonathan towards David,
and the kind offices he did him with Saul, in order to procure him his beloved
Mi∣chol, instead of her sister; all these, I say, are represented
in divers affecting scenes, to which the energy of the Hebrew gives no
small beauty and pathos. The Epi∣sodes, the most considerable of which
con∣sist of several interviews and conferences between the prophet Samuel
and young David, as when he acquainted him with Saul's utter rejection, and his
being chosen by God to succeed him in the Israelitish 
<PB N="278" REF="280"/> kingdom, David's surprise, scruples and fears, his
dread of entertaining even the most distant hope of a crown, which he could
not obtain but by the most unnatural and blackest treason against his
father-in-law, and his most generous friend Jonathan, and the arguments by
which the prophet endeavours to satisfy his scrupulous mind, that he
shall enjoy the promised crown, without the least stain to his loyalty,
and at length prevails on him to suffer himself to be anointed king;
these, and some others of less importance, are not improper inter∣ludes
to bring the piece to its happy cata∣strophe, his marrying the kind and
beloved Michol, and being justly raised to the command of the
Israelitish army. To this I had added a literal version, which I
designed to have illustrated with critical notes; but some avocations
obliged me to set it aside for a considerable number of years, and when I
came to give it a fresh reading, I found it to fall so short of the
elegance and loftiness of the sacred poets, with whom I was become by that
time much better acquainted, and a much greater admirer of, that I was quite
discouraged from <PB N="279" REF="281"/> improving or even finishing,
especially when I considered the little likelihood there was of its meeting
with encouragement answerable to the pains and cost, at a time when one
might observe the study of that tongue to dwindle more and more visibly
into con∣tempt, among those whose duty and busi∣ness it ought to have
been to cultivate and promote it.</P>
<P>The same mortifying consideration made me likewise set
aside a design I had formed, of compiling some scriptural Hebrew
Dia∣logues, in imitation of the Latin ones of Castalio, and a set of others
on more com∣mon subjects, like those of Corderius, tho' not so puerile,
for the encouragement and diversion of young beginners; and a third between a
Jew, and a Christian, on the most material points of controversy between
us, together with a collection and exposi∣tion of a great number of texts,
both in the Old, and New Testament, plainly foretelling the future
restoration of the twelve tribes of Israel, to their own Land, and their
embracing Christian religion at the second coming of Christ, towards 
<PB N="280" REF="282" MS="y"/> the close of the sixth, or in the beginning
of the seventh millenary of the world; for though that doctrine is, as the
Jews at Rome said of Christianity, every where spoken against, (Acts,
cap. ult. v. 22.) I never found it to be so but by men who, like these Jews
had never rightly consi∣dered it; whilst those who really have, (among
whom I have known several emi∣nent divines of the church of England, and
some among the Dissenters who were thoroughly satisfied with it)
contented them∣selves with owning their belief of it to their intimate
friends, without daring to preach or promote it, for fear of being re∣flected
or ridiculed for it. But I have had frequent occasion to observe since
(vide Jual un Hestor, fol. edit. vol. i. p. 613, &amp;c. 8vo. edit. vol. iii.
p. 39. and above all, see the conclusion of their history, from the
disper∣sion to this present time) that the Chris∣tians denying that
doctrine, is one of the most effectual means not only of hardening the Jews
in their unbelief, but of unhing∣ing one of the greatest evidences of the
Christian faith, since it cannot be proved in any sense, that any of
those glorious pro∣phecies <PB N="281" REF="283"/> concerning the happy
state of the Jews under the Messiah, which are scat∣tered through the
Old and New Testa∣ment, have been fulfilled; but that, on the contrary, they
have for the most part been hated, persecuted and miserable, in most
countries in the world, ever since the death of Christ. However, as I had
little en∣couragement to hope that such a subject, written in Hebrew, how
beneficial soever it might have proved, at least to young be∣ginners,
especially by the help of the Latin version, would relish with the
present age, I likewise postponed it for some happier time, which is
not yet come, if ever I should live to see it.</P>
<P>I therefore contented myself with preparing for the press a
new edition of the Psalms, with Leusden's Latin version over against
it, and some critical and other notes for the use of the learners,
interspersed here and there, with others of a more curious nature, on
several defficient places of that book, and most of them new. To this I
designed a preface, that should give an account of the method by which I
had, chiefly by the means of the psalms, attained to my know∣ledge 
<PB N="282" REF="284"/> of the Hebrew tongue, in the man∣ner I have lately
related. I designed to add some further directions than those I have
mentioned, with respect to the more easy attaining a readiness of
understanding and speaking it, one of which was, in the frequent reading to
change the third into the second person at proper places, and so turn∣ing
the psalm into a kind of prayer, which, by raising the attention, imprints
the words more in the mind, as well as familiarizes the conjugating of the
verbs, &amp;c. and this I found a great help to my progress, and was approved
by some judges, upon which I acquainted Mr. Palmer, of Bartholomew's Close,
one of the best printers then in Eng∣land, with my design, and was
surprised one day on my coming to talk further about it, to hear that the
reverend Dr. W— had been there just before, to treat with him about
printing a new edition of it, said to have been compiled by Dr. Hare, since
bishop of Chichester, who pretended to have found out the true metre of the
Psalms, and by means of that to have made a great number of considerable
discoveries and emendations in the original. I knew <PB N="283" REF="285"/>
but too well how many excellent critics had already split upon that fatal
rock, and who, instead of correcting, had quite marred the Hebrew, by
distorting, transposing and altering it at pleasure, in order to bring
it to their model, to expect any thing solid or satisfactory from that
quarter, consider∣ing especially the character of the author. Nor was I
mistaken, though this performance did not appear in print till seven or
eight years after, and then to my great surprise. For Mr. Palmer had
amused me with the belief that the design was set aside, either on
account of its being found impracticable, or at least too difficult and
dangerous; for that, upon his applying to Dr. W— to enquire further about
it, he had received such evasive answers, as plainly convinced him, that
the author did not design to go on with it, which still confirmed me more
in my old opinion, that all attempts to recover the antient metre of the
sacred poetical books, were fruitless and lost labour. It appeared
however, as I shall show here∣after, that Mr. Palmer imposed upon me, and
that he knew that the design was car∣ried on in another printing-house,
though <PB N="284" REF="286"/> with such privacy, that I never heard or
dreamed of it, though I had been long ac∣quainted with Mr. Bowyer, who was
em∣ployed in the printing of it. So far from it was I, that I began to think
Mr. Palmer had only invented that story to divert me from printing my
proposed edition, in order to set me upon another work, in which he was
more immediately concerned, and expected greater credit, as well as present
profit from. This was his history of print∣ing, which he had long promised
to the world, but for which he was not at all qualified. However, he designed
to have added a second part, relating to the practical art, which was more
suited to his genius, and in which he designed to have given a full account
of all that relates to that branch, from the letter-founding to the most
ele∣gant way of printing, imposing, bind∣ing, &amp;c. in which he had made
conside∣rable improvements of his own, besides those he had taken from
foreign authors; but this second part, though but then as it were in embryo,
met with such early and strenuous opposition from the respective bodies
of letter founders, printers, and book∣binders, <PB N="285" REF="287"/> under an
ill-grounded apprehension, that the discovery of the mystery of those
arts, especially the two first, would render them cheap and contemptible
(whereas the very reverse would have been the case, they appearing indeed
the more curious and worthy our admiration, the better they are known) that he
was forced to set it aside. But as to the first part, viz. the history
of printing, he met with the greatest en∣couragement, not only from them, but
from a very great number of the learned, who all engaged to subscribe
largely to it, particularly the late earls of Pembroke and Oxford, and the
famous doctor Mead, whose libraries were to furnish him with the noblest
materials for the compiling of it, and did so accordingly.</P>
<P>The misfortune was, that Mr. Palmer, knowing himself unequal to
the task, had turned it over to one Papiat, a broken Irish bookseller
then in London, of whom he had a great opinion, though still more
un∣qualified for it than he, and only aimed at getting money from him, without
ever doing any thing towards it, except amusing him with fair promises for
near three quar∣ters <PB N="286" REF="288"/> of a year. He had so long dallied
with him that they were come within three months of the time in which Mr.
Palmer had engaged to produce a compleat plan, and a number or two of the
first part, by way of specimen of the work, viz. the inven∣tion and
improvement of it by John Faust at Mentz; and these were to be shewn at a
grand meeting of learned men, of which Dr. Mead was president that year, and
being his singular friend and patron, was to have promoted a large
subscription and pay∣ment, which Mr. Palmer stood in great need of at
that time. Whereas Papiat had got nothing ready but a few loose and imperfect
extracts out of Chevalier la Caille, and some other French authors on the
subject, but which could be of little or no use, because he frequently
mistook them, and left blanks for the words he did not understand.</P>
<P>These however, such as they were, Mr. Palmer brought to me,
and earnestly pressed me that I would set aside all other things I
might be then about, and try to produce the expected plan and specimen by the
time promised, since he must be ruined both in credit and pocket, if he
disappointed his <PB N="287" REF="289"/> friends of it. It was well for him
and me, that the subject lay within so small a com∣pass as the
consulting of about twelve or fourteen principal authors, and the
con∣troversy between Mentz and Harlem univer∣sally decided in favour of the
former, so that I easily fell upon a proper plan of the work, which I
divided into three parts, the first which was, to give an account of the
inven∣tion of the art, and its first essays by Faust at Mentz, and of
its improvement by fusile or metal types, varnish, ink, &amp;c. by his
son-in-law Peter Schoeffer. The second was to contain its propagation and
further improvement, through most part of Europe, under the most celebrated
printers; and the third an account of its in∣troduction and progress into
England. This, together with above one half of the first part, were happily
finished, and produced by the time appointed, and met with more approbation
and encouragement from his friends than I feared it would, being con∣scious
how much better it might have turned out, would time have permitted it. And
this I chiefly mention, not so much to excuse the defects of such a
horrid perfor∣mance, <PB N="288" REF="290" MS="y"/> as because it hath given
me since frequent occasion to observe how many much more considerable
works have been spoiled, both at home and abroad, through the impatience of
the subscribers; though this is far enough from being the only, or even the
greatest inconvenience that attends most of those kinds of
subscriptions.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Palmer, his circumstances were by this time so
unaccountably low and unfor∣tunate, considering the largeness and
success of his business, and that he was himself a sober
industrious man, and free from all extravagance, that he could not extricate
himself by any other way, but by a statute of bankrupt, which caused his
history to go sluggishly on; so that notwithstanding all the care and
kind assistance of his good friend Dr. Mead, a stubborn distemper,
which his misfortunes brought upon him, carried him off before the third part
of it was finished. This defect, however, was happily supplied by the late
noble earl of Pembroke, who being informed by Mr. Pain the engraver, Mr.
Palmer's brother-in-law, what condition the remainder was left in, and that I
was the person who had <PB N="289" REF="291"/> wrote the former parts, sent
for me, and, with his usual generosity, enjoined me to compleat the work,
according to the plan; and not only defrayed all the charges of it, even of the
paper and printing, but furnished me with all necessary materials out of
his own library; and, when the work was finished, his lordship reserved
only some few copies to himself, and gave the re∣mainder of the
impression to Mr. Palmer's widow, not without some farther tokens of his
liberality.</P>
<P>Before I leave this subject, I must, in justice to that
noble peer, give an instance or two of his generosity and singular
integrity. At my first coming into England, I had had the honour to be
introduced to him, and to dine with him and other great persons in his
company, and had received no small tokens of his regard, till he conceived a
just disgust at one absurd fact I had affirmed in my fabulous history
of Formosa, viz. the Greek tongue being taught there as a learned language,
which monstrous absur∣dity sufficiently shewed my ignorance and
indiscretion at the time of my writing it, and from that time his lordship
gave me up <PB N="290" REF="292"/> for what I was, an impostor, and I saw
him no more, till above twenty-eight years after, when Mr. Pine brought me to
him, in or∣der to finish the book abovementioned. At my first coming into
his presence, his lord∣ship presently knew me again, and reminded me of
my having been often with him, and of the reason of his taking a dislike to
me; upon which I readily owned the justness of the charge, and of his
resentment, which I begged his lordship to look upon as the effect of a
rash inconsiderate piece of youthful vanity, which I had long since
disclaimed, and condemned myself for, and assured him, that I had
since then, I thanked God, fallen into so laudable a way of living, as I
doubted not his lordship, if he knew of it, would not but approve of. Mr.
Pine confirmed what I had said; and his lord∣ship with his usual
affability and condescen∣sion, highly congratulated and commended me for
it, and was pleased to express a more than ordinary pleasure at it,
exhort∣ing me to continue in the same good mind and way, and assuring me
of his friend∣ship and encouragement; and from that time I cannot
sufficiently acknowledge his <PB N="291" REF="293"/> extreme benevolence and
condescension, in not only furnishing me with all the books and other
helps I wanted, but in his generously rewarding me for what I did; and when I
was forced afterwards to ac∣quaint him that I was a person concerned in the
writing of the Universal History, became a subscriber and encourager of
it, as I shall presently have occasion to shew. It was a little before
Mr. Palmer's death, that this work, the project of which had been formed by Mr.
Crockat, and the ex∣cellent plan by the late famed Mr. Sale, met with an
unexpected stop, by an un∣happy quarrel between the proprietors and the
authors, at the head of whom was Mr. Sale abovementioned, when I was
recom∣mended to the former as a proper person to supply the place of some
of the latter, who had absolutely declined being farther concerned in it.
This rupture happened soon after the publication of the third number, anno
1730, when Mr. Pal∣mer brought me the three printed num∣bers from the
proprietors, and desired, if after having read them and the plan, I had a
mind to engage myself in the work, <PB N="292" REF="294"/> I should give
them and the rest of the authors a meeting at a place and day appointed,
which I accordingly did, and after having informed myself with their terms,
method, and other previous particulars, readily un∣dertook to write the
Jewish history, in which I was the most versed, and for which I knew
myself already provided with a considerable quantity and variety of
mate∣rials, which I had been collecting for my private use for several
years; and as I have been one of the chief persons concerned as an author,
not only in the first, but also in the second edition, and so was
perfectly acquainted with every step taken in the progress of the work, the
encouragements and difficulties it hath met with, as well as with the merit and
demerit of every part of it, I shall make no difficulty to insert here a
faithful and impartial account of the whole, at least so far as it may be
of service to the public, and prove a means of making any future editions
more compleat, by pointing out the many false steps which I found were
impossible for us to avoid in the two former.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="295"/>And here I must observe, in the first
place, that though the design was publicly pre∣tended to be carried on by a
society of learned gentlemen, yet in fact Mr. Sale was to be the sole
conductor of it, by the assistance of such ammanuenses as he should
think fit to employ in the work. And though, in point of learning, no man might
be better qualified than he, for such an ar∣duous and extensive
undertaking, yet his known strait circumstances obliged him to have so
many other irons in the fire (to say nothing of his natural indolence, the
sad effects of which, not only the proprietors of this work, but many others
of that pro∣fession have sufficiently felt) that it was im∣possible
for him to give it that attention which a work of that nature deserved, much
less the dispatch he had engaged with them for, viz. the publishing
twenty sheets per month. Accordingly upon enquiry I could not find that he
ever wrote more than the first number; which, though puffed up with the
specious pretence of a second edition, every reader versed on the
subjects treated in it, might easily know where he had got all his
materials ready <PB N="294" REF="296"/> gathered to his hand; yet so long was
he in publishing it, that his delay occasioned the first
misunderstanding between him and the proprietors, which was however
fol∣lowed by a greater.</P>
<P>The second and third numbers, which ap∣peared afterwards to have
been written by his two ammanuenses, till then unknown to the partners, came
out indeed more regularly; but the proprietors, who had already paid Mr. Sale
for them, were not a little surprised when the two young authors (whom I
forbear naming, because they are both alive and make a good figure, the one
in a high post, and the other in the commonwealth of learning) came and
demanded the money for their copy. The propietors did indeed produce his
receipts for much greater sums than the three numbers could amount to, but
though they knew that he was not in a capacity to pay them, they refused to
make a second disbursement for what they had more than payed for,
whilst the sufferers, on the other hand, refused to go on further with
the work, till they were satisfied for what they had done. The partners
stiffly refusing to comply, the result was, that one of them 
<PB N="295" REF="297"/> not only quite declined all further meddling in the
work, but vented his resentment by crying it down, and all the persons
con∣cerned in it, authors as well as proprietors. Mr. Sale was still more
outrageous against them, of whom the latter had taken a note of 72 pounds,
payable on demand, for money overpaid, and the embezzlement of a considerable
number of books, which they had furnished him to carry on the design. This
note was probably taken with a view of keeping him in awe, but neither that nor
their threats could contain him within bounds, so that he became a most
inveterate enemy to the design, and did all he could to dis∣credit and
obstruct it.</P>
<P>This was the hopeless situation of the work at my first
being invited to it, and against which I cannot forbear mentioning an∣other
discouragement, viz. the freedom which the authors of the foregoing part had
taken in reflecting, as often as they had op∣portunity, against the Mosaic
account, espe∣cially in the history of the antient Canaan∣ites, where God
is recorded to have treated them with such severity in favour of the
Israelites, and where they made no diffi∣culty <PB N="296" REF="298"/> to
reflect upon that partiality, as incon∣sistent with the divine justice
and goodness towards a favourite nation, who are there represented as by
far the worse of the two: for, as I took the liberty to observe to them,
besides that all the objections against the divine conduct in this
particular have been so often and so effectually answered by learned
divines, that there can be no justifi∣able reason given for reviving them
here, this manner of treating Moses's writings is far below the regard that
such an antient and celebrated author may challenge, ab∣stractedly even
from his being acknowledged an inspired penman, by Jews, Turks and
Christians. And therefore added, I will never engage in the work, unless
you will allow me to follow the opposite tract, and, instead of reflecting,
to vindicate both his character and writings, as often as occasion offers,
either from the works of our best divines, or from sundry new
observations I have had opportunity to make on the books of that divine
lawgiver. I much question, if they had not been at such a nonplus for a
hand to go immediately upon the Jewish history, whether they would have
ever <PB N="297" REF="299"/> yielded to these terms, such was their opinion
of Mr. Sale, whom they knew had no great regard for the Old Testament, and
who had long ago inspired one, if not both of his ammanuenses with a most
outrageous zeal against it. However, I got them with some trouble to
acquiesce, and let me take my own way, only Mr. Provost, then one of the
partners, begged it as a favour of me, that I <HI>would not be righteous over
much.</HI></P>
<P>I gave them soon after good cause to be satisfied with my
advice and conduct, and the unexpected encouragement which the work met with,
after the regular publica∣tion of two or three numbers of the Jewish
history (to say nothing of the commenda∣tions given to it in print, by two
such learned persons as Dr. Chapman, chaplain to his grace of Canterbury,
and Dr. Pearce, rector of St. Martin's in the fields) raised it into such
reputation and vogue, that they no longer doubted of its success;
inso∣much that they began now to enlarge the edition from 750 to 1000. And
this I mention with pleasure, because the great call there was for it from
that time, to what they had found before, when the numbers 
<PB N="298" REF="300"/> were returned to them by dozens from other
booksellers, plainly shewed how few encouragers it would have met with
among the freethinkers and unbelievers, to what it did among those of a
different, and I may add, of a better way of thinking. There was indeed one
main objection made, viz. my clashing with those who had gone be∣fore me;
and I remember more particularly, that the late earl of Pembroke (who, as I
lately hinted, was an encourager of the work, and to whom I was obliged to
ex∣cuse my not waiting so often on him as he desired, in order to
finish the third part of Mr. Palmer's history above mentioned, by
acquainting his lordship that much of my time was taken up with the
Universal His∣tory, in which I was engaged) expressed no small
dislike at this contrast, or, as he was pleased to call it, chequer-work
between the Jewish history, and some of the num∣bers that preceded it;
the one expressing all along an unaccountable disregard for the Mosaic
writings, whilst the other took all proper occasion to vindicate them, in a
manner which he was pleased to call so very laudable and just; upon which
I was <PB N="299" REF="301"/> forced to acquaint his lordship, that the former
part had been printed some time before I was concerned in the work, and
written by persons in a very different way of thinking from me, and which I
had publicly disallowed; but as they had since declined the work, the
proprietors had left me wholly at my liberty to take my own way, which I was
fully determined to pur∣sue to the end, so that there would be no more
such contradictions to be found in the sequel, because all that related
to the Jewish nation down to their dispersion at the de∣struction of
Jerusalem, or even from that to the present time, if we were encouraged to
continue it, would fall to my share; and that those who were to write the
histo∣ries of the Assyrians, Medes, Persians, and other nations which
had any connection with the Jewish, should be obliged to fol∣low the same
tract, and acknowledge the divine authority of the Old Testament. This his
lordship highly approved, and as to the remaining difficulty, viz. the
reconciling what was already printed, and he thought past remedying, I told
his lordship, that the greatest part of these early numbers having 
<PB N="300" REF="302"/> been mislaid, and so bandied about and wasted that
there would be speedily a ne∣cessity of reprinting them, I would engage
to revise and correct them, so as to make the whole uniform, which was
soon after done accordingly. But when, for the credit of the work, I
proposed to the proprietors the calling in of the old numbers, and giving the
purchasers the new ones in lieu of them, the greater part of them lent a deaf
ear to it, alledging, that they were so much out of pocket already, that they
could not afford to destroy so great a number of copies for the sake of
uniformity, and that the work must take its chance without it.</P>
<P>This was not the only instance in which they stood in their
own light; I shall beg leave to add one or two more. Before the ninth number
of the first volume had been published, they had received several letters
from the learned both at home and abroad, directed to the authors,
particu∣larly two from Holland, the one from a person who translated our
history into French, and the other into Dutch, and published them there
regularly every month, as we did here. These, among other com∣mendations 
<PB N="301" REF="303"/> and encouragements, desired us to send them the
sheets as fast as printed here, for the better dispatch of their
ver∣sion, and keeping time with us; offering to make any reasonable
satisfaction for it, and to promote the credit and sale of the English
original on the other side the water. The Dutch translator in particular,
who was a man of learning and character, ac∣quainted us, not without a
handsome and modest apology, with some alterations and deviations he had
taken the liberty to make from our printed copy, in the three or four first
numbers, and desired us above all things to settle a correspondence with
him, that we might freely communicate our thoughts to one another, promising
to send us, at the conclusion of each volume a copy, of his version, with
the alterations marked in the margin, and the sentiments of the learned
beyond sea; about the work which he accordingly did at the close of his
first volume, though we had not been able to prevail upon the proprietors to
send them the sheets in the manner above desired, and were not willing to
do it without their con∣sent, they being all apprehensive that these 
<PB N="302" REF="304"/> would hinder the sale of the English original there.
We tried in vain to con∣vince them of the contrary, by shewing them that it
would rather forward it, by making it more known and famed abroad; for that not
only the English there, but likewise those who understood that
lan∣guage, would still chuse to read it in the original rather than in a
version. I like∣wise tried to make them sensible how ne∣cessary and
useful such a correspondence would be to us, and how much it would in all
likelihood contribute to the credit and re∣putation of the work, and what need
we stood in to use all proper helps, in a work of so arduous and
extensive a nature. The only thing they would agree to, was that we might, if
we thought fit, still correspond with them, (and that they knew we could do
without their leave) but as to the sending the sheets as soon as printed,
they absolutely refused; so that we were forced to put an end to the one
for want of being able to comply with the other.</P>
<P>The next instance I shall give is still of a more sordid
nature. They were obliged to furnish us with all necessary books 
<PB N="303" REF="305"/> for the work, and on my first going upon the Jewish
history, I sent them a list of such as were really wanted, though
some of them very considerable both in bulk and value, such as the
Thalmuds, Polyglott, Opera Criticorum, &amp;c. and was surprised at the
difficulties they made, and objections they raised against both the number
and charge of them, alledging on the one hand the vast number of them that
had been for∣merly embezzled and lost, which they pre∣tended to amount to
near 200<HI>l.</HI> and on the other, the vast expence they had already been
at, and the little returns made for it in the four first numbers; so that
if I would not dispense with a good number of the dearest sort, they
were afraid they must desist from proceeding farther. It was well for
them, as well as me, that I had then a free access to Sion College library,
by an order from the president and some of the heads of that society, and
which I had made use of for some years, whenever I stood in need of it;
so that I readily engaged to strike out all those that I should find
there, provided they would promise to find me all the rest. By which means,
as well as by the <PB N="304" REF="306"/> kind assistance of my good
friend the re∣verend Mr. Reading, the late worthy library-keeper, who having
the goodness to bring me all the books I called for, without the trouble of
my looking out for them in their respective shelves, to my writ∣ing desk
at the farther end of the li∣brary, I could with ease consult all my
au∣thors, make what extracts I wanted out of them, after which he took the
pains of returning them to their proper places.</P>
<P>Now as this saved the booksellers the buy∣ing of near, if not
more than 100<HI>l.</HI> worth of books, and me a great deal of trouble, (for
Mr. Reading did most frequently enquire of me what part of a book I
de∣signed to consult, and being well acquainted with most of them,
brought them to me opened at the very place I wanted, which enabled me to make
more dispatch, and to keep up to the time of publication) I in∣sisted at
one of our meetings, and I thought justly too, that they should, by way of
acknowledgement, present either the library, or the worthy keeper of it, with
a set of volumes, as soon as they come out, which, I told them, might
likewise be a means of <PB N="305" REF="307"/> recommending the work to
those divines and others that frequented that place. They all seemed
readily to agree to the proposal, and I acquainted Mr. Reading, who was not a
little pleased with it, and told me, that, for his part, he was very ready to
do all he could to promote our design, without any such view, though he
said that he should be glad to see it pre∣sented to the library, as it
was a work which he much approved as far as we had gone, the chronology
excepted, to which he thought that of the learned Usher vastly preferable.
I told him I was wholly of his opinion, and was sorry Mr. Sale had ever fixed
upon this, but that it was done before I was concerned in the work, and could
not now be retrieved, at least in this first edition, but by the readers
making up the difference either in their mind or with the pen. I added, that I
had reason to believe, that if the work came ever to be reprinted, we
should exchange it for that of Archbishop Usher, as we have actually
done. However, as soon as the first part of the Jewish history was
printed off, I took a little recess among some of my <PB N="306" REF="308"/>
friends in Hampshire, where I compleated my next task, viz. the history
of the Celtes and the Scythians, and as I had the free use of several
libraries there, I saved the proprietors the charge of buying those books I
was sure to find in any of them, and as soon as I found by the public
papers, that the first volume was published, wrote a letter to put them in
mind of their promise of presenting one of them to Sion College library;
but I was much surprised at my coming to town, to find that they had
absolutely resolved against it, on pre∣tence that it might hinder many
clergymen from buying it, if they could have the reading of it there. I tried
in vain to fore∣warn them that I should want most of the same scarce
and chargeable books, besides a number of others, for the writing the
second part of the Jewish history, in a subsequent volume, in which
case they could not expect that I should again have recourse to my good
friend Mr. Reading, but must of necessity be at the expence of buying
them; they chose to run the hazard of it, and I took care not to spare them
in one of them, when it came to the point.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="309"/>From these few instances, the reader may
easily guess that the then partners were not quite so solicitous for
the credit of the work, as might have been wished, con∣sidering how well it
took by this time. But I must in justice to them acquaint him, that
(besides the great difficulties they la∣boured under to procure proper hands
to go on with it, and for which I refer him to what I have said in the
dedication and preface to the last volume of the folio edi∣tion) they had met
with many unexpected and considerable losses; some of the newly engaged
authors, for instance took up pretty round sums before-hand, and never
wrote a line of the part they had undertaken; others, even among the old ones,
wrote theirs in such a careless manner as not to be fit to appear in print,
when they came to be examined by the rest, and yet were paid the same to
the full as if their copy had passed muster, though the whole was to be
done again <HI>de novo,</HI> and the re∣tarding of the work was an additional
loss to the proprietors. I will add, that I have since known near twenty
sheets of the be∣ginning of the Byzantine history, done by 
<PB N="308" REF="310" MS="y"/> a judicious hand, and printed off, yet con∣demned
to waste paper chiefly because it was spun to too great a length, which
was still a much greater loss. The truth is, that the author of the Roman
history, hav∣ing wire-drawn it to above three times the length it was to have
been, there was an absolute necessity of curtailing that of the
Constantinopolitan emperors, to prevent the work swelling into an enormous
bulk; and he himself hath abridged it in such a manner as hath quite marred
it, since the reader will find most reigns contained in as many short
paragraphs as they would have required sheets, which is so much the greater
loss to the public, inasmuch as the Roman history being so well known,
and written by so many hands, was the fittest to have been thus
epitomised; whereas the Byzantine, though equally curious and instructive,
is so little known, that it ought to have been written in a more copious
manner, especially as it abounds with the most interesting incidents to
the church as well as the state. So that the author hath done in both
respects <PB N="309" REF="311"/> the very reverse of what he ought to have
done.</P>
<P>The reader may, from the instances above mentioned, suppose
perhaps, that we the au∣thors kept constantly to our meetings and ex∣amining
each part in a body, as we used to do at first setting out, a method of
the greatest consequence towards the carrying on such a work, and which
the proprietors were not wanting in generosity to promote; but we soon
found the new comers so averse to continue it, or submit the review of
their copy to the old ones, that they either absented themselves from our
meetings, or else condescended only to answer such questions as were
asked them by the old ones concerning their fixing any point of history,
which had a connection with that of another nation; as the Macedonians and
Greeks, for instance, done by two or three hands, to prevent our clashing
with each other about uncertain or controverted facts; in every respect, they
insisted on going on each in his own way, as they were, they told us,
sufficiently acquainted with the subject they had in hand. By this means it
was that they indulged themselves in the <PB N="310" REF="312"/> liberty of
going beyond their bounds, and swelling each part to double the bulk agreed
on, by often repeating the same common facts in each separate history,
which we had agreed should be related at length but in its proper place,
whilst every other occa∣sion that offered for fresh mention of them, was
to be only referred to that, either as promiscua to follow in the sequel,
or as a reference to what hath already been said.</P>
<P>For we had from the beginning agreed upon this method, that
nothing should be related at length concerning the history of any nation or
country, but what was trans∣acted within the boundaries of it; and that the
wars, conquests, &amp;c. which were car∣ried on abroad, should be mentioned
chiefly in the history of those countries where they were made; to do
otherwise, would be, as was hinted at the beginning of the first vo∣lume,
treating those conquered nations with the same arbitrary contempt and
neg∣lect as their conquerors had formerly done. Thus, for instance, it was
resolved that Alexander's history should be confined to Macedonia, and
his other conquests re∣ferred <PB N="311" REF="313"/> to that of those
nations he subdued; that that of the Romans, should be con∣fined within the
limits of Italy, and their new lawless acquisitions referred to the
history of the Gauls, Germans, Spaniards, Carthaginians, &amp;c. that were to
follow. This would at once have effectually cut off all needless repetitions,
with which the work hath been swelled beyond its de∣signed length, without
docking the history of any nation, as we have been since forced to do, to
avoid falling into the same fault in which the writers of the several Greek
histories have fallen, where the reader may see the same facts related
over and over in the histories of the Macedonians, Athenians, Spartans,
&amp;c. not without some visible and unjustifiable variations, all which
might easily have been avoided, had the au∣thors kept within the rules
abovementioned. But no one hath shewn a greater disregard to them, than the
author of the Roman history, who hath swallowed up all the unhappy nations
that fell into those con∣querors clutches without distinction, and
expatiated with the same diffuseness on their history without, as he
hath in that within <PB N="312" REF="314"/> their territories, which though
some of our readers have approved of, as it gives a more connected history
of that nation, a thing so much the less needful in a work of this
extensive nature, as we have it written in a body by so many different
hands, yet hath been highly disliked by the far greater, and I may add the
more judi∣cious part of them, as contrary to our plan and engagements to the
public, and to the nature of an Universal History, wherein that of every
nation, should be found fully displayed, and every fact confined to its
pro∣per scene of action. It was to the neglect of attending to, or rather
keeping up to this original design, that we must ascribe two
considerable defects in the work, against which our readers have justly
complained. The one, that some histories, as for instance, that of the
Carthaginians, had been fraught with an unnecessary repetition of all their
wars with the Romans, or which had been already fully related in the Roman
history, to the swelling of the work beyond its due limits; the other, that
to avoid that inconveniency and charge to the purchasers, those of the
Gauls, Germans and Spaniards <PB N="313" REF="315"/> are truncated, and their
wars with, and reduction by the Romans are barely referred to what hath been
said in the Roman his∣tory, where they are scattered and so
inter∣spersed with that of other nations, that it cannot be called a
regular and compleat history of them. And what is this but absorbing all
these brave nations by the lump, into that of their tyrannic conquerors; and
how could I, to whose lot the history of those three ancient nations
fell, avoid it by any other way, but that of recapitulating all afresh, in
the most compendious manner I could, to avoid swelling the work and
re∣ferring the reader to the volume and page of the Roman history, where the
facts are mentioned at length. And there was by that time the more cause to
abridge all these needless repetitions, because the pur∣chasers, and
after them the booksellers, had justly complained, how vastly the work
was already swelled beyond the bounds to which we had promised to confine
it. But this was not so readily complied with by the rest, who having
finished each their respective histories, according to the plan and
me∣thod agreed upon, and mentioned above, <PB N="314" REF="316"/> and either did
not dream that the writer of the Roman history would go contrary, or when
they found he had, did resent it too much to suffer their own to be
truncated on his account, insisted upon their being printed at full length,
and with all their repe∣titions. And this the booksellers were forced to
submit to, for fear not only of disoblig∣ing the authors, but likewise of
retarding the regular publication of the volumes.</P>
<P>But what will easily convince the reader, as it hath me long
since, how much more earnest the writer of the Roman history was to
promote his own ignoble interest, at the expence of the proprietors as well
as the credit of the work, is, that when he came afterwards to write the
second part of the history of the Persians, he hath re∣peated at length
all their wars with the eastern emperors, together with all the other facts
and incidents that passed between them, at full length, instead of
referring to what he had formerly said in the Byzan∣tine history; for this
plainly shews that the <HI>dulcis odor lucri,</HI> more effectually
influenced him than all the complaints of the propri∣etors and purchasers,
which last were be∣come <PB N="315" REF="317"/> so rife that we thought it
necessary to publish something by way of excuse for this excess of
bulk, and at the same time to make the best appology we could for that and
other deviations from our original plan, without discovering the causes
they were owing to, which would have rather helped to discredit the work in
the eye of the world, which did not dream how little unanimity there was in our
proceedings, and how impossible it was for the best in∣clined of us to
keep such selfish spirits as were then employed, within the bounds
prescribed. I shall now give a farther in∣stance of it, and such a
pregnant one, as will convince the reader that such a work as this could
never be carried on fairly, and according to our promise, notwithstanding
all our care and precaution, even in the second impression of the work;
how much less possible must it have been, to have done so in the
first.</P>
<P>But there was still a greater inconvenience resulting from
these repetitions, and the monstrous bulk of the Roman history, and by
that time the seventh volume was <PB N="316" REF="318"/> finished, the
public began to think we de∣signed to spin the work to nine or ten, for
there were still a great number of ancient kingdoms and countries to be
described, ac∣cording to our original design, such as the Mohammedan
history, and other nations interwoven with it, consisting of above twenty
articles in Mr. Sale's plan, most of them of such hard names as few readers
were acquainted with, besides the kingdoms of the great Mogul and other parts
of India, those of Siam, China, Japan, Tartary, Russia both in Europe and
Asia, the Turkish empire in both, and the whole country of America; all
which could hardly be contained in less than two volumes at the least.
However, by that time the seventh volume was published, the pro∣prietors
met with so little encouragement to go on from the purchasers, and were
al∣ready such considerable losers, that they thought fit to stop there,
and leave the work thus maimed and imperfect; but what not only determined, but
in some measure forced them to it, was their having the mortification
soon after, to see their property invaded by three different pyratical 
<PB N="317" REF="319"/> booksellers of Dublin, who, as they were not at any
other charge than printing and paper, both which are much cheaper in Ireland
than here, could well enough afford it to the public for half the price that
ours sold for at London, and unknown to each other reprinted the work there
word for word, two of them in folio and the third in oc∣tavo, and when each of
them came to un∣derstand that the like pyracy had been committed by the other
two, fell foul against each other in their advertisements, in such
language and opprobrious names as all three justly deserved. As therefore
such a piece of flagrant injustice could not but greatly affect the
original proprietors, who were already so considerably losers, it could
not be expected that they should run the manifest hazard of throwing away
more money in pursuit of their plan. We were therefore obliged to frame
an∣other kind of excuse for their dropping it, viz. that those countries
and kingdoms not spoken of in the foregoing volumes, being of later
discovery, such as India, China, &amp;c. in Asia, a great part of Africa,
and the new American world, they would <PB N="318" REF="320"/> be more properly
described, and their histo∣ries begun and continued in the modern part,
which they were however no farther resolved to go on with, than as they found
a probability of its meeting more encour∣agement than the old had hitherto
done. So that they had now time to think on some proper means of
suppressing the three pyrated impressions as far as possible, by
exposing them to the public as they justly deserved, and proposing to
give the world a new and more correct edition of the whole in octavo, together
with additions of such material points as had been omitted in the former.</P>
<P>When this second impression came to be resolved on, both
the authors and proprie∣tors, sensible of the many miscarriages of the
former, for want of our following our first plan, did unanimously agree
among other things, that every one of us in the revising, correcting, and
improving each our respective parts, should oblige ourselves, so far to
stick close to it for the future, that all the unnecessary repetitions
should be rescinded, and every historical fact be confined to the history
of that country in <PB N="319" REF="321"/> which it was transacted, and no
where mentioned at length but there; as the con∣quest of Sicily in the
history of that Island, of Carthage in that of the Republic, of the
Spaniards, Gauls, &amp;c. in that of those nations, which was the only way of
mak∣ing every one of them compleat, and at the same time shorten the work,
by the avoid∣ing all needless repetitions. And this we not only promised,
but bound ourselves in writing to perform; however to make the point still
more sure, as I had reason to doubt an unanimous compliance to the
agreement from one quarter, I further pro∣posed that no part should go to
the press, till it had been examined and approved by the rest. This was
accordingly opposed by the party I suspected under several specious
pretences, such as taking up too much time, as we lived at some distance
from each other, the danger of mislaying or losing some of the copy, and
having now and then some alteration in controverted points, all which might
retard if not hinder the work; upon which the proprietors thought fit to give
it up, and to depend upon our honour for the exact performance of our 
<PB N="320" REF="322"/> agreement. However, as he hath hardly in one single
instance kept up to it, but hath reprinted, not only his own Roman history,
but several other parts done for∣merly by other hands, and now com∣mitted to
his care by the booksellers, almost verbatim from the first edition, to
the no small trouble of, and damage to the other authors who had filled up
these un∣necessary chasms in their respective parts, which he
should have struck out of his own, and have been since obliged to erase
all those additions; he hath sufficiently convinced every one of us what
his views were in so strenuously opposing my propo∣sal, and
consequently how impossible it is for such a design as this to be
rightly ex∣ecuted, unless the whole care and revisal be left to one
single person of ability equal to it. The thing is now past all remedy
with respect to this second edition, though it may be easily rectified in
every re∣spect in a future one, if any such may ever find encouragement.
But the wrong done to the public in this second, is the more considerable,
through the unfairness of the author above mentioned, in as much as, 
<PB N="321" REF="323"/> though he is the only one concerned, that hath not
complied with our articles, he has by his subdulous artifice had the far
greater share in the work committed to him. And I think I have the greater
right to complain of his breach of promise, and the discredit he hath
brought on us and the work, as I can make it appear that neither in the first
nor second edition, I have ever departed from our original plan, in any of
those parts I have been engaged in, nor inserted any thing in them except
by way of promissum or reference, that properly belonged to an∣other. And
for the truth of this I shall only appeal to these parts, a list of which
I shall, in justice to my own character, now give to the reader. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Jewish history, from Abraham, to the
Babylonish captivity.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 2. The history of the Celtes and Scythians.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 3. The ancient history of Greece, or the fabulous and
heroic times.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 4. The sequel of the Jewish history, from the return
from Babylon, to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 5. The history of the ancient Empires of Nice and
Trebizon.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="322" REF="324" MS="y"/> 6. The history of the
ancient Spaniards.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 7. Of the Gauls.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 8. Of the ancient Germans.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In the second edition, wherein we endea∣voured to supply all
the material omissions in the first, the following parts came to my
share, viz. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The sequel of the Theban, and Corin∣thian
history.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 2. The Retreat of Xenophon.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 3. The continuation of the Jewish history, from the
destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, to this present time. </ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I must here observe with respect to the last of these,
that it had been promised in our plan from the very beginning, but had been
deferred, as more properly belonging to the modern history; upon which
several of our subscribers and correspondents complained of the
omission, as it is a subject not only curious and instructive, but
likewise little known, and therefore much wanted; upon which we had agreed to
satisfy their de∣mand, and to have inserted it at the end of the second
part of the Jewish or the Roman history, and I had accordingly pre∣pared it
for the press against that time, and <PB N="323" REF="325"/> bestowed full
six months in the writing of it, besides what I had spent before in
col∣lecting such curious materials as fell in my way; so that the copy,
which will make about fifteen or sixteen sheets of the octavo edition, hath
been a good while in the hands of the proprietors, and as I had reason to
expect, would have been printed before now in the fifteenth or sixteenth
volume, of which I had apprised several of my correspondents, as well as
those of my acquaintance who enquired after it. But to my surprise, the
proprietors have since de∣termined to postpone it till the Modern History
comes out, as it brings the history of the Jewish nation down to the
present time, which no other in the work doth, and can have no place in the
Antient. But the real cause was the want of room, the work being like to
swell beyond the number of volumes promised in their proposals.</P>
<P>The truth is they being in some measure obliged to include it
within the compass of twenty, or at most twenty-one volumes, in order to
suppress the pyratical Irish edi∣tion (which was promised to be
contained <PB N="324" REF="326"/> within that number, though without any
probability (or perhaps design) of their so doing, if one may guess by
the bulk of each of those volumes that have been published) there was a
necessity of reducing matters within a narrower com∣pass. And this upon a
strict computation might have been easily done, notwithstand∣ing the
several additions that were to be made to the work, had all the needless
repetitions been rescinded, the style made more concise, and a great
number of super∣fluous facts, circumstances, disquisitions, and
controversies, most of them useless and incompatible with the nature of
so ex∣tensive a work, been struck out of both the text and notes, as we
had agreed should be done by every one in his respective parts, and hath
been actually done by all but one, and him the person who had the largest
share in the revising and contracting of the work; so that through his
neglect and noncompliance, the work hath swelled not only much beyond our
computation, but would have done much more so, had not the proprietors from a
laudable desire of keeping up as much as could possibly 
<PB N="325" REF="327"/> be done to the first proposals, not only
generously thrown in five or six sheets ex∣traordinary into every volume,
but likewise enlarged every page both in the length and number of the lines,
by which each volume from the fourth downwards, may be justly said to
contain between six or seven sheets more of matter than was origi∣nally
proposed, or than the third or fourth contained. And this I am bound to
men∣tion in justice to them, because though they were considerable
losers by the first edition, they yet chose to put themselves to this
extraordinary expence, rather than in∣cur the charge of imposing upon the
public, by the unexpected addition of three or four volumes more than they had
engaged to comprise the whole work in. However, I cannot but be sorry that
these considerations should be looked upon as a sufficinet pretext for
their suppressing that sequel of the Jewish history I have been
speaking of, contrary to the original plan of the work, and the expectation
of so many of its en∣couragers. And I do purposely take notice of it, that
in case I can not prevail upon them to print it at the end of the work, 
<PB N="326" REF="328"/> and leave it at the option of subscribers, either to
buy or leave it, the public may know where the fault lies, and that my friends
may not lay it at my door.</P>
<P>Thus much may suffice for the history of this work, and to
account for the great imperfections of the first edition, and for the
second not turning out better than it hath; and I doubt not, when the reader
considers all these things he will be apt rather to wonder, as I have often
done, that it is come out so well as it is. I have no intention, much less
any cause to reflect on the proprietors of the work, especially those who
are become so since the deaths or failure of most of the old ones. They
have spared neither pains nor cost towards its improve∣ment, nor been
wanting in generosity to the authors. They never once disputed with me
about the price I set upon my la∣bour, nor refused to supply me with
such sums as I drew upon them for. This is indeed more than I can or ought
to say of the old set of them, some of whom often put us to great
difficulties by their sordidness and mutual jealousies and
misunderstandings, all which I with pleasure observed to vanish 
<PB N="327" REF="329"/> upon the coming in of this new set. It is true that as
far as related to me, they always found me diligent and punctual; I performed
the parts I undertook to the best of my abi∣lity, and being content with a
moderate gain, could bestow the more time and labour upon them, and always
took care to have them finished at the time required; and so wholly, and I
may add cordially, was I in∣tent upon the work in general, that I would never
engage in any other whilst that lasted. And this they were so far
satisfied of, and so entirely relied on me, that whether in town or
country, I have been allowed to drawn upon Mr. Millar, for some scores of
pounds before hand, which were punctu∣ally answered by him, though neither he
nor any of the partners, ever saw any of my copy till it went to the press;
and when printed off paid the surplus with uncom∣mon generosity, for I
always took care to keep within compass. This may look like vanity for me to
say of myself, but as it will not be made public till after my death, when
I shall be out of the way of reaping any satifaction from it, but the
conscious∣ness of having acted an honest part; and 
<PB N="328" REF="330"/> as this hath been my constant method with all the
booksellers with whom I have been concerned, and for this I dare appeal to
all who have employed me, I am the less scru∣pulous about any sinister
construction a censorious reader may put upon it; those who have known me
and my conversation for much above these twenty years, will I hope pass a
more candid judgment upon it.</P>
<P>However, with respect to the management of the partners about
this second edition, I cannot but observe that they were guilty of two
fatal errors. The first in com∣mitting so great a share of the work, as
well as the revisal of the whole to a man, who they had all reason to
believe aimed chiefly at gain and dispatch, and to agree with him by the lump
as they did, which would only prove a temptation to him to hurry it off as
fast as he could, and as he accordingly did, to their no small
mortifica∣tion, as well as hurt to themselves and the work. I might add, that
as he was and owned himself quite unacquainted with the eastern languages,
he was the most unqualified for several parts that fell to 
<PB N="329" REF="331"/> his lot of any and if care had not been taken would have
committed such mistakes in the very spelling of pro∣per names, as would
quite have dis∣credited it.</P>
<P>The other was their engaging to publish a volume monthly, and
beginning to pub∣lish before they had a sufficient number ready printed
before hand, to have enabled them to keep up to their time; the want of which
precaution hath since obliged them to have several volumes on the anvill at
different presses at once, and to be dis∣patched with such
precipitation that the compositors have overlooked many litteral errors which
had been corrected by the authors, and which is still worse, this hath
likewise made it impossible for us to make the proper and necessary
references from one volume to the other as they were printed at the same
time, and not regularly one after another, as they should have done, so
that in some cases we could hardly refer to the volume much less to the
page; but the reader will find many instances of this last.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="332"/>I shall now give some few useful hints
how this work may be made compleat in a future edition by one single hand, if
equal to the task; first, let whoever under∣takes it read it all over again
attentively and regularly, one volume after another, and as he reads,
common-place every thing, person, fact, &amp;c. as if he designed it for a
compleat and copious index. Let him not depend upon that general one which is
ready made to his hand, at the end of the work, and where all these
needless repeti∣tions, inconsistences, and contradictions may be artfully
omitted or concealed, but either make a full and exact one <HI>de novo,</HI> or
at least consult the printed one upon every point he reads over, and mark
down every such omission or concealment; though were it my case I
should rather prefer the former, because there will be the less labour
lost, as it will stand ready for such when the work comes to be
reprinted, and he will have afterwards nothing to do but add the printed pages
to every article as they come in course, only if it should be deemed too
full, he may strike out afterwards such as ap∣pear of less moment. But he
will find <PB N="331" REF="333"/> this singular benefit by such an exact
com∣mon-placing of every thing, that it will discover to him at once every
needless re∣petition, every inconsistency and contra∣diction as he reads
on, which he may at the same time mark down in the margin of the book, in
order to correct them on the second reading. He may then set down
likewise in the margin, the volume and page where the same thing is told
be∣fore, where it is differently related or set in a different light, and in
cases that admit a dispute, by consulting the original au∣thors, be able
to judge which is right or most probable. Thus for instance, when he finds
the very same facts related in the histories of Sicily, Rome and Carthage,
he will easily know where they ought to have been set down at length,
namely, where the scene of action happened, and where only to be referred to
it, viz. in the other two. So that whatever either the Romans or Carthaginians
transacted in Sicily, should be only promised or referred to in their
history, and only related at full length in that of the Sicilians; and so
of the rest. He will likewise by such an index find <PB N="332" REF="334"/> out where any facts or transactions have been differently related
or represented by each of their writers, who must of course be
supposed, and will upon trial be found to clash often, for want of
frequently con∣ferring with each other, or duly consult∣ing and examining, or
perhaps some times of rightly understanding the original authors they
pretend to follow.</P>
<P>By this means he will likewise be able to discover many facts
related in one place, which more properly belong to, or might be more
conveniently transferred to an∣other, and place them so accordingly in his
marginal notes. By that time he hath common-placed the whole set of volumes,
he will be likewise able to discover every material omission under
every article, either from his own memory and reading, or by turning to the
index of such books as treat of the same subject, and be able to supply
every such defect from them. Thus in the articles of nations, as Jews,
Egyptians, Romans, &amp;c. or of cities, as Jerusalem, Alexandria, Rome,
&amp;c. if he finds any thing material, which not being in his common-place
book, makes him conclude <PB N="333" REF="335"/> it was omitted in the work, he
will like∣wise easily supply from those authors and their indexes, and
the same may be done by the articles of names of kingdoms, provinces,
monarchs, &amp;c. by furnishing himself with the best modern authors who
have wrote of them, and supplying each with every thing he finds wanting in
his own common-place book, as well as ex∣change some less material trifles
that are in this, for more momentous ones he will find in them, all which may
be done with little trouble, and he will still reserve to himself the
liberty of the difference in con∣troverted points he will meet with among
those moderns, by having recouse to the original ones; for he must make
it a stand∣ing rule to himself, not to rely on the for∣mer which are more
copious than exact, without consulting the latter, and where those differ
among themselves as they often do, to use all proper helps either to
recon∣cile them, or to chuse the more probable side.</P>
<P>This would have been the method I should have taken, had I had
any share in the revising any other but my own particu∣lar 
<PB N="334" REF="336"/> parts in the work; tho' I must still have thought it
too much for any one to have revised the whole, and should have thought it
necessary to have imparted the above mentioned rules to the rest, in
order to have enabled them to have rectified every mistake, contrast, and
jarring, between their parts. For as I knew that all the hopes of the
proprietors, was in a second, and more correct edition, to reimburse the
losses they had sustained by the first; I had their con∣sent to
compose the index to each of the volumes, (the first excepted, which was
done by the same hand that wrote the Roman history, and justly condemned
for its unnecessary length and verbosity) by which I could observe as I
read along, and marked in the margin of the leaves, every needless
repetition, superfluity, contrariety, omission, transposition,
&amp;c. that would be necessary to make the next impression more
compleat, especially when I came to make the general one to the whole; and
was the better inabled by it, to rescind and alter what I found amiss or
superfluous in those parts that came more immediately under my care, though
I have had since <PB N="335" REF="337"/> reason to think I have gone too far
in it, and out of complaisance to the proprietors, who complained that my
Jewish history was too diffuse for a work of this nature, have been
prevailed on to strike out in this second edition many curious things,
which I have since found had been very well liked and approved of in the
first. But without such rescisions it was impos∣ble to bring the
whole within the com∣pass proposed, especially as they were so much
neglected in several other parts of the work, which would at least as
conve∣niently admit of them, such as the Dyna∣stes of the Egyptians, the
history of Persia from the oriental writers, and many other such fabulous
absurdities. However, I can∣not accuse myself of having suppressed
any thing that was of moment in that history; though several perhaps, and
to my no small regret, which would have been acceptable to the curious in
that kind of learning. As for all the other parts within my province, I have
rather enlarged and improved them with new proofs, observations and curious
additions, as may be easily found by com∣paring the two editions
together.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="338"/>With relation to the desiderata in both
editions, I cannot forbear taking notice that the ancient history of the
northern nations, such as Moscovy, Poland, Sweden, Den∣mark, Norway,
&amp;c. hath been altogether omitted except some few hints that have been
given in that of the Scythians and Celtes, intimating only that the former were
originally descended from the latter. It is indeed commonly believed that
these remote nations have no records of their ancient times, but I had a
singular oppor∣tunity of being convinced of the contrary, by a learned
gentleman who was a pro∣fessor of history, &amp;c. in the university of
Abbo in Norway, but came to London mostly every summer as an agent from the
king of Sweden, and among other new books, used to buy several setts of
the Uni∣versal History for that Prince, for count Coningsegg, and other
great persons in that kingdom. This gentleman having ex∣pressed a
desire to Mr. Symons his book∣seller, and one of the proprietors, of
con∣versing with one of the authors, particu∣larly with that of the Jewish
history, we soon came acquainted together, and upon <PB N="337" REF="339"/>
my enquiring of him after such records or monuments of those northern
nations on which one might compile their ancient his∣tory, gave me such a
satisfactory account, as made me persuade Mr. Symon, and the other
partners, to engage him to undertake it, which he, with some difficulty,
agreed to do, notwithstanding his other avocations. I had the pleasure of
seeing him every time he came to London, and to hear how well he proceeded in
the work; and accordingly in about three years he brought a large and elaborate
account of all the northern nations and countries, their origin, ancient
settlements, history, &amp;c. with many curious observations on their
geogra∣phy, natural history, and the whole backed with such good
authorities and proofs, as one would hardly have expected from such barren
climes, and was recommended by several of the most learned men in Swe∣den
and Norway, who had the perusal, or even contributed to some part or other
of it.</P>
<P>This chapter, which, according to our ori∣ginal plan, was to have
preceded the ir∣ruption of the Huns, Goths, Vandals, Suevi 
<PB N="338" REF="340"/> and into the southern parts of Europe, would have
given a much better and clearer account of these barbarous nations, than that
which hath been given in the history of their new settlements in Hungary,
Italy, France, Spain, &amp;c. The misfortune was, that it proved too bulky
(though no∣thing could be said to be superfluous or impertinent in it) it
being computed to amount to above seventy folio sheets, for which they
could not find room, our work being already swolen vastly beyond its bulk;
so that Dr. Sidenius, that was the learned author's name, had the
mortification of having that curious part refused by the proprietors, and
returned upon his hands, the old ones, as Mess. Symon and Batley, being dead,
and the rest, except Mr. Os∣borne in Grays-Inn, being gone off, and the new
ones not looking upon themselves concerned in the agreement. And this I
mention with no small regret, because it was a considerable loss to the
learned world, as well as to the author, and such as I much fear will hardly
be ever recovered.</P>
<P>In the interval between the conclusion of the first, and the
resolution of printing the <PB N="339" REF="341"/> second, I was invited
into a share of the new System of Geography, in which though the Public
found just fault with the extra∣vagant length of that which related to Great
Britain and Ireland, I yet found the authors concerned in it, so well
qualified for the work, so communicative and punc∣tual in their regular
meetings once a fort∣night, that I readily came into it, and found with
pleasure the work carried on with more unanimity, exactness, and to the
satis∣faction of the proprietors, as well as of the public. The parts I did
in that work were those that follow. 1. Spain, Portugal and the islands
belonging to them. 2. Italy, Savoy, Piedmont, and the islands of Sicily,
Sardinia, Corsica, &amp;c. 3. Muscovy both in Europe and Asia. 4. Turky
in Asia. 5. In Asia, China, Japan, Jetzo, and the islands along those
coasts, particularly that of Formosa, which part I chose, that I might
take occasion publickly to acknow∣ledge, as it were by a third hand, the
fals∣hood and imposture of my former account of that island. 6. In
Africa, the king∣doms of Egypt, Abyssinia, Lybia, Barbary, Tripoli, Tunis,
Morocco, Fez, with an <PB N="340" REF="342"/> account of the Mediterranean Sea,
and the famed river of Sanaga. 7. The Azores islands. 8. In America, the
countries of Brasil, Magellan, Terra del Fuego, Canada, Louisiana, and the
Bahamas and Bermudas islands. And by the time I had concluded these last,
I was called upon to prepare my respective parts of the Universal
History, for the second impression mentioned above. I have however
found sufficient reason to complain of the wrong management of this work in
several respects, though other∣wise carried on with greater exactness
and unanimity than that of the Universal His∣tory, and I shall now take
the liberty of mentioning some of the most considerable ones, because
they have been the cause of some unavoidable errors and blunders, not only
in the two above mentioned works, but in most others that have been
published in the same or near the same way. The first is the authors
being tied to produce such a number of sheets in so short a time as is
almost incompatible with their desire, if any such they have, of
performing their respective parts with any exactness; for, though the
publishers seldom fail of ac∣quainting <PB N="341" REF="343"/> the public
that the work is either already, or pretty near finished and ready for the
press, so that there is no danger of its meeting with any delay or
impediment, yet that is seldom if ever the case, and with respect to the
works I am speaking of, I found it quite the reverse, and that they have
frequently been sent to the press, under the promise of being regularly
pub∣lished, by such a number of sheets every week or month, when
scarcely a fourth part of it was written. So that, to prevent the retard∣ing
of the work, they have been obliged to call in for new helps, whom they have
obliged to engage to perform their part in less than half the time, that it
would have reasonably required; considering that they not only had it all
to begin and go through in that short space, as was the case in this new
System of Geography, but that some of them were likewise engaged in
some other work, between which and this, they were forced to divide their
time and diligence, though either of them did more than re∣quire it all; and
how could it be possible for either to be performed as it ought?</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="344"/>Another mismanagement from the be∣ginning
was, the interlarding every fourth or fifth number with a set of maps which
indeed gave some breathing time to the authors, but then it confined them to
re∣ceive all their directions concerning the limits, situation, longitude,
latitude, dis∣tances, &amp;c. from those maps, which being such as the
engraver rather than the au∣thors had made choice of, as the most au∣thentic
in his opinion, were not always so judiciously chosen as could have been
wished. This made many errors remedi∣less and irretrievable, because the
greatest part of those maps had been published in such numbers,
several months before the authors were called upon to begin the geography of
those countries. This I often complained of to the proprietors from the
beginning, both as a great over∣sight and a hardship upon the authors, who,
instead of being allowed to direct the en∣graver in the choice or compiling
of them, were obliged to follow him implicitly, and often contrary to their own
opinion and liking, in those which he had thought fit to pitch upon for our
guide. Thus in the <PB N="343" REF="345"/> map of Japan, for instance, the
land of Jetzo is affirmed to be the same with Cum∣schatta, though contrary
to fact, it not being so much as part of it. I might add likewise, that
those maps confined us to the orthography of places, though very often
erroneous, or being of foreign extract, con∣veyed a wrong sound of the name
to an English ear.</P>
<P>But the most considerable mismanagement was in the choice of
such printers as bore indeed the greatest sway and interest, and who
consequently had such a glut of busi∣ness, that every thing was
dispatched with the utmost hurry and precipitation, in order to keep up to
their time. This never failed causing a great deal of confusion and
in∣correctness in the printing, particularly in the othography of proper
names, and giv∣ing the authors a great deal of trouble in correcting the
proofs, which, however, was but too often of no service, through the hurry
the compositors were in, which made them overlook and often neglect those
cor∣rections. It frequently happened likewise, that they required such a
quick dispatch of the author, in correcting the sheets, that 
<PB N="344" REF="346"/> they had not time enough to read them over with that
carefulness they would otherwise have done; so that they them∣selves
could not avoid overlooking even some material errors in the spelling, but
most chiefly in the numbers and figures. As for me, it being my constant
rule not to be engaged in two works at once, I never would let a proof go out
of my hands, without a second, and, in some cases, a third reading, but I
have often found that I might as well have saved myself that labour,
since the correctors or compositors had not time enough left to make the
pro∣per emendations, and sometimes have sent the sheet to the press
before the proof hath been returned.</P>
<P>To prevent this unfair dealing, as I may justly call it, or at
least to lay the blame at the right door, I had taken a method of
insisting upon having two proofs, of each sheet, sent me from the
press; under pre∣tence of keeping one of them by me, to refer to when it was
requisite, but in fact by correcting both proofs alike in the mar∣gin, to be
able to produce that which I kept by me, against both the compositor, 
<PB N="345" REF="347"/> and corrector, when ever they were guilty of any such
neglect. But as soon as my design was found out by them, some
plau∣sible excuses were made, for not continu∣ing to send duplicates, and
I was forced to give up that point, unless I had a mind to disoblige the
very master printers, who were some of the richest, and bore the
greatest sway with the proprietors, and had already deprived us, under the
pretence of dispatch, of the privelege of revising our copy, after our
first correction. This last indeed was denied us, on account of the
unreasonable trouble, which one of the authors too frequently gave them, in
those revises at the first setting out? who did often require three or
four of them, and every one loaded with new, and mostly needless
alterations, which took up so much of the compositors time that they were
obliged to complain of it. This was, though true with respect to one author,
but a poor pretence for depriving the rest of the liberty of one single
revise, which they chiefly insisted on, not so much to make any
necessary alterations, as only to be satisfied that none of their
corrections were <PB N="346" REF="348"/> overlooked. However, the point was
over∣ruled by the printers; and that material check being taken off from the
compositors, the literal errors multiplied so fast upon us, especially
in the words and quotations out of the eastern languages, that we were
obliged to take notice only of such as were of the greatest moment in the
table of errata of the first edition, and to curtail as many of those
foreign words as we could in the second, especially those of the Arabic,
Hebrew, and Syriac kind.</P>
<P>These are some of the principal causes of that
incorrectness which commonly, I had almost said unavoidably, happen in
these kinds of works, let an author be ever so desirous and careful to
avoid them, unless he hath so great a sway over the printers, that they
dare not refuse him the liberty of revising his own work as often as he
sees it needful. And the least that he can insist on, for his own
credit and satisfaction, is a revisal of every proof after it hath been
corrected by him.</P>
<P>I did take occasion to mention a little higher the wrong
information which Mr. Palmer gave me concerning Bishop Hare's Metrical 
<PB N="347" REF="349"/> Psalter, which was, unknown to me, put into Mr.
Bowyer's hands to print, whilst I was writing the first part of the
Jewish history, and as there had elapsed several years be∣tween the
time, in which Mr. Palmer was applied to by Dr. Washburn, and that of my
becoming in course to write on the sub∣ject of the Hebrew poetry, which had
confirmed me in the opinion that the bishop's design was quite set
aside; I made no difficulty to affirm after the generality of the learned
writers on that subject, that the metre of the Hebrew Psalms and other
poetical pieces in the Old Testament, was looked upon as irretrievably
lost, notwithstanding the efforts of some, and the pretences of others,
who vainly imagined they had or were in the way of recovering it. I backed my
opinion with some new arguments which had occurred to me during my
fruit∣less search after it, and which appeared to me to carry no small
force. This part, which was contained in the ninth number of the first
volume, was scarcely published, before the bishop's Psalter came out.
It may be easily imagined that my curiosity would not permit me to be long
without <PB N="348" REF="350"/> examining that performance, which seemed to
overthrow all that I had said on that sub∣ject, and sadly was I vexed
that my part was published before I had seen this un∣expected piece. Had I
dreamed of any such being so near coming out, I would doubtless have
suppressed mine till I had thereby examined it. What surprised me
most, and made me entertain some higher notion of that enterprize, was the
long inter∣val which had passed between the time of its being finished
and offered to Mr. Pal∣mer, and that of its being published, which I reckon
to have been about six or seven years, and which I therefore supposed
the bishop and his learned friend Dr. W—, had spent in the revising
and polishing it; but, upon stricter enquiry, I found the cause of that
delay to have been of a different nature, and was as follows.</P>
<P>His lordship had excepted against Mr. Pal∣mer's Hebrew types,
which were of Athias's font, and a little battered, and in∣sisted upon his
having a new sett from Mr. Caslon, which greatly exceeded it in beauty. But
Mr. Palmer was so deep in debt to him, that he knew not well how to 
<PB N="349" REF="351"/> procure it from him without ready money, which he was
not able to spare. The bishop likewise insisted upon having some
Roman and Italic types cast with some distinguishing mark, to direct
his readers to the Hebrew letters they were designed to answer, and these
required a new sett of punches and matrices before they could be cast, and
that would have delayed the work, which Mr. Palmer was in haste to go about,
that he might the sooner finger some of his lordship's money. This put
him upon such an unfair stratagem, which when discovered, quite
disgusted his lordship against him, viz. representing Mr. Caslon as
an idle, dilatory work∣man, who would in all probability make them wait
several years for those few types, if ever he finished them. That he was
in∣deed the only artist that could supply him with those types, but that
he hated work, and was not to be depended upon, and therefore advised his
lordship to make shift with some sort which he could substi∣tute;
and would answer the same purpose, rather than run the risk of
staying so long, and being perhaps disappointed. The 
<PB N="350" REF="352"/> bishop, however, being resolved, if possible, to
have the desired types, sent for Mr. Bowyer, and asked him whether he
knew a letter founder that could cast him such a sett out of hand, who
immediately recom∣mended Mr. Caslon; and, being told what a sad and
disadvantageous character he had heard of him, Mr. Bowyer not only
assured his lordship that it was a very false and un∣just one, and
engaged to get the above-mentioned types cast by him, and a new font of his
Hebrew ones, in as short a time as the thing could possibly be done. Mr.
Caslon was accordingly sent for by his lordship, and having made him
sensible of the time the new ones would require to be made ready for use,
did pro∣duce them according to his promise, and the book was soon after put
to the press; and this it was that had so long retarded its
publication.</P>
<P>I was not long without it, and must own that his preface, in
which his lordship con∣futed, with uncommon learning and keeness, all the
systems that hitherto appeared in public, raised my expectation to a high
de∣gree. For if the metre of the sacred book <PB N="351" REF="353"/> could but
be supposed to come up to the loftiness and dignity of the thoughts and
expressions, (and who could ever have doubted of it, that considers how
much greater genius the latter requires than the former?) it must I thought
have greatly ex∣celled that of Homer and Virgil. But how great was my
surprise, when upon reading on I found that his lordship had reduced it
to a poor low, crawling humdrum, bitony of trochaics and iambics, or <HI>vice
versa</HI> as the reader pleased, and into which he might with ease, and
with much less than half the variations, maiming and dis∣tortion of the
text, have reduced any com∣mon prose out of any language! How much more
still to find in almost every line, words, and sometimes whole verses
mutilated, stretched out or lopped off, transposed or exchanged <HI>ad
libitum,</HI> in order to bring them to his ill contrived standard! To hear a
learned prelate, with all the seeming gravity imaginable, affirm that the
Hebrew poetry, (which by the way was arrived to such prodigious heights, with
respect to the grandeur and loftiness of its figures and imagery, even so
early as <PB N="352" REF="354"/> Mose's time) was even so low as in David's
time, so crude, imperfect and vague, as not to have so much as a
determinate dif∣ference between long and short syllables, especially
considering to what a heighth of perfection that monarch had improved the art
of music; and, what is still more sur∣prising than all the rest, to
see his lordship, in consequence of this his low conceit of the Hebrew
poetry, take such pains to marr, deface, and destroy some of the most
sur∣prising, lofty and complicated figures and allusions in that sacred
book, and such as far excel all that is to be met with in the Greek and Latin
poets. But for these I must refer the reader to what I have ob∣served of
the Hebrew poetry, and on that absurd performance, in the Universal
History (see vol. iv. of folio edition p. 710 <HI>&amp; seq.</HI> and
notes, and in the octavo one, vol. x. p. 202 <HI>&amp; seq.</HI> and note
(E). The occasion of my being obliged to make those animadversions on it,
was as follows.</P>
<P>I was so shocked at the freedom which that prelate took to
depreciate, muti∣late and vilify so sublime a set of the noblest and
most divine poems, that I <PB N="353" REF="355"/> thought myself obliged to
write against him, and to expose, as they deserved, all his unfair
criticisms on it, all his forced emendations, and, above all, the absurdity
of his new-discovered metre; but withal, in such a respectful manner, as
was due to a person of his character. And in order to that, retired for three
months into Surry and Hampshire, where I had an op∣portunity to consult,
upon proper occasions, some of my friends, who were no stran∣gers to that
kind of learning. I found the task the less difficult, as I presently
fell in among some of them, who not only condemned his performance, but had
raised already some very material objections against it, which they
readily communi∣cated to me as soon as they were apprised of my design.
One of them among the rest had (by way of exposing his lord∣ship's
contemptible metre) reduced the English Lord's Prayer, Creed, Ten
Com∣mandments, and the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> into the same crawling measure;
whilst I, who wholly confined myself to the Hebrew, had already done the
same by the first chapter of Genesis, and the last chapter of 
<PB N="354" REF="356"/> Malachi, both which I had likewise turned into the
same dull verse, without half the deviations from the text, which his
lordship had been forced to make in al∣most every Psalm. Some of his very
pretended emendations proved such, that the frequency of them directed me to
the discovery of a more elegant metre than he had ever dreamed of, and which
con∣vinced me, as they have since many more Hebraists, that there was in
the metre of the Psalms, not only a real and settled distinction between
the long and the short syllables, but that two of the latter were
equivalent, in the constituting of a foot or verse, to one of the former;
so that they had at least three different kinds of feet, viz. long
monosyllables, bisyl∣lables, consisting of two long, and
trisylla∣bles, consisting of two short and one long, or <HI>vice
versa;</HI> but which in the metre an∣swered to a spondee, or two long
syllables. Of this I gave so many instances, as made me think, contrary
to what I had done till then, that the Hebrew metre was not so irrecoverably
lost as I had imagined, and that a little more application than I 
<PB N="355" REF="357"/> had time then, or have had since to bestow upon it,
might go near to recover most, if not all, the various kinds of it.</P>
<P>However, as soon as I had finished what I, and some of my
friends as well as I, thought a sufficient confutation of the bishop's
performance, and in the same, tho' not so florid and elegant a Latin, I
sent to desire one of my booksellers to enquire of Mr. Bowyer, whether
the new types, cast for his lordship, were still in his
pos∣session? and whether I might be permitted the use of them, in the
answer I had pre∣pared for the press? I was answered in the affirmative;
but one bookseller took it into his head to ask at the same time, what
number of copies his lordship had caused to be printed of his Psalter?
and was an∣swered only five hundred; one half of which had been presented
by his Lordship to his learned friends, both in and out of England, and
most of the rest were still unsold, there being but few among the
learned, that were curious in such matters; the performance having been
disapproved by all that had seen it. This news so cooled the
booksellers eagerness after my answer, <PB N="356" REF="358"/> that, upon
my coming to town, and their acquainting me with the state of the case, I
was quite discouraged from printing it. For they concluded from what Mr.
Bowyer had said, that it would be dangerous to print above three hundred of
mine, the charge of which being deducted, the profit, upon a supposition
that they were all sold, would be so small, that they could not af∣ford
me above two or three guineas for my copy (which would have made about seven
or eight sheets of a middling octavo) with∣out being losers. This was their
way of computing the matter, against which hav∣ing nothing to object, I
locked up the pa∣pers in my cabinet, where they have lain ever since. They
did indeed offer me better terms, and to print a greater number of copies, if I
would be at the trouble of print∣ing it in English, which they thought would
be more universally read, out of dislike to the bishop; but, besides
that I cared not to be at the pains of Englishing it, I thought it below the
subject to print it in any other language, but that in which his was wrote,
and so wholly declined it.</P>
<P>I lodged then with the curate of the <PB N="357" REF="359"/>
parish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Luke's, Old-street.</NOTE>, who, upon my
coming from Hampshire, told me the following story, which I give on his
authority, for I never enquired farther into it—That his rector, the
reverend Dr. Nichols, acquaint∣ed the bishop, that he had a gentleman in his
parish, who designed shortly to publish a confutation of his Hebrew
metre. The bishop asked whether he was equal to the task? and was
answered, that he was thought so by all that knew him, and that he was the
person who had wrote the Jewish history, wherein he had given a greater
character of the He∣brew poetry than his lordship seemed to do in his book,
and that he was one of the persons concerned in the writing of the
Universal History. The bishop then asked his name, and being told that
he called himself Psalmanazar, expressed himself with some warmth
to the company, that there was never a Jew of them all that understood any
thing of Hebrew, much less of the sacred poetry; and being told that I was
no Jew, but in all appearance an honest and strict churchman, who would
doubtless use his lordship with the respect due to 
<PB N="358" REF="360"/> his character; he appeared a little better
sa∣tisfied, and willing to suspend his judgment, till he saw what I
had to say against him.</P>
<P>And here I cannot forbear making an ob∣servation, or two, on his
lordship's speech, taking the story for true, which I am the more
inclined to believe to be so, because he was always known to have a
singular contempt of the Jews, so far as related to their knowledge of the
Hebrew tongue. The one is, that his mean opinion of them must be owing to his
small acquaintance with them; otherwise he might have found in London
several of them very learned in that tongue, (besides a much greater
num∣ber abroad, especially among the northern ones) and who, bating their
different interpretations of those main prophecies which relate to the
Messiah, could have displayed to him a much greater and deeper skill in
that sacred tongue, than he appears to have had, by any thing one can find in
his book. The other is, how his lordship came to take Salmanazar for a
Jewish, instead of an Assyrian name; for as the monarch so called,
was one of those monarchs who carried away part of Israel 
<PB N="359" REF="361"/> captives into Assyria; a Jew would as soon call a
son of his Beelzebub, as Salmanazar, or Nabuchadnezzar.</P>
<P>However, the abovementioned story, as well as the expectation
which my friends in Hampshire, Surry, and London, were in, to see my
answer to him, gave me no small regret, lest my not publishing it
should be interpreted in favour of his per∣formance, or as my yielding the
point to him, as not being able to confute him. And could I have afforded it, I
would have run the hazard of printing it at my own charge; for I was above
doing it by sub∣scription, it being so small a thing as a pamphlet of
at most eight octavo sheets; and much more loth was I, all the above things
considered, to let a work seemingly calculated to depreciate the excellence
of the sacred poetry of the Old Testament, to go uncensured; especially
as I had so many strong objections ready levelled against it. At length a
thought came into my mind, as I was then preparing new materials for the
second part of the Jewish history, to resume that subject there. And
this I thought, I was so much better intitled to <PB N="360" REF="362"/> do,
if it were but in defence of what I had said in the first part in praise
of the Hebrew poetry, and which was, in most cases, quite opposite to the
character, which his lordship gave of it in his book. The collecting, and
compleating of the canon of the sacred books by Ezra, and other inspired
writers, and their appointing of the proper lessons, psalms, &amp;c. for
the divine worship, gave me a fair opportunity for it, which I was the more
ready to take, as I knew that it would be read by many more people in such a
work as that, than in a Latin pamphlet, and would of course more effectually
expose the absurdity of his pretended new-found metre, as well as the
unseemly freedom he hath given himself in altering and mutilating the
sacred text for the sake of it. I therefore resolved to take notice, in
justice to his lordship, of all just, laudable, and useful
discoveries he had made on that subject in the text, and to throw the main
part of my objections against the rest of his book in a long note, in the
most succinct and impartial manner I could, in hopes that the setting
both forth, as it were, in one view, might probably <PB N="361" REF="363"/>
excite some who had more learning and leisure than I, to follow the hints
there given, as the most likely means for compleating the desired
discovery, to which his lordship had in a great measure opened the way,
though he had so unhappily miscarried in the end. The difficulty was how to
con∣tract my materials so as not to over-swell that part of the work, as it
must have done if I had brought every thing into it, which I had wrote on
that subject, and this obliged me to strike off near two thirds of them,
and to confine myself to the most material points, such as would most
effectually an∣swer the two main ends I had in view, viz. the exploding the
bishop's new metre, and giving the curious reader, that would go about it, a
clue to find out the original one of the sacred books; for as to what I
designed to have said in praise of the Hebrew poetry, had the subject
been printed separately, it was the less necessary here, as I had
already expatiated so much upon it in the first volume. Some of the
pro∣prietors and authors were indeed against my design, not only as it
would swell the chapter beyond its length, but likewise as 
<PB N="362" REF="364"/> the subject in question appeared to them, foreign to
the rest of its contents; but I had the pleasure not only to carry my point
against them, but likewise to have the performance commended by several
learned men as well as by all my friends; insomuch that upon my consult∣ing
several of them, whether I might not in the second or octavo edition (in
which we were obliged to contract our materials, in order to reduce the whole
within the proposed limits) either wholly omit or content myself with a
short men∣tion of what I had done more at large in the folio; they advised
me by no means to curtail the main subject, though I might, they thought,
eraze here and there an ex∣planatory or critical note, which I readily complied
with.</P>
<P>Soon after I had concluded my last part of the Ancient
History, the proprietors and authors had some meetings together to
consult upon the going on with the Mo∣dern, and several plans were
proposed by different persons of learning and capacity. The misfortune was,
that this part likewise was to be confined within the compass of 
<PB N="363" REF="365"/> twenty volumes, of the same bulk with the Ancient, and
these gentlemen differed so much in the proportion they allowed to each
respective country or kingdom, that we could see but little likelihood of
mak∣ing any tolerable computation, either of what the whole might reasonably
amount to, or of what number of sheets might be properly allowed to each
history. As for me, the more I considered the great ex∣tent of the work,
and the number of em∣pires and kingdoms which had not so much as been touched
upon in the Ancient part, such as Turkey, India, the great Mogul, Tartary,
China, Japan, &amp;c. the greatest part of Africa, and the whole tract of
America, to say nothing of Russia and several other northern countries
in Europe; the more I was persuaded of the impos∣sibility of reducing the
whole within so small a number of volumes, unless it was done rather by
way of epitome, than of compleat, though ever so succinct, a his∣tory.
But though this appeared still more visible by the small number of
sheets which these plans, however different, allotted to most parts of
the work, and must have <PB N="364" REF="366" MS="y"/> received by almost
every reader, at the first view, yet the proprietors who had their particular
reasons for fixing upon that number of volumes, would by no means consent
to have it exceeded. This how∣ever occasioned some demur, during which
some of the best judges in this kingdom, and out of it, were consulted,
as well as about the properest method of beginning and pursuing this modern
part.</P>
